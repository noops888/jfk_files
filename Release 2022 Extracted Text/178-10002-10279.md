Most of my operations were run out of Europe.

Run out of --

A

Europe. Some were run out of Miami but the big ones

were run out of Europe.

Well, in the course of your activities with respect

to Cuba did you have occasion to become familiar with the

operations of the Miami base?

Yes.

And the situation in the Cuban community in Miami?

A

Yes, sir.

During the nine years you were with DDO's. Cuban

operations, who was -- who were the chiefs of the Miami

Station?

A

I think in 1963 Ted Shackley was the Chief and he

was followed by -- I can't think of his name. I should know

it.. Well, I will come back to that.

Then, the next Chief of Station was Paul Henze.

What years was he Chief?

I think Paul was there about a year and a half.

He

left in 1968 when we reduced the size of the Station. Let's

say Henze was there from 1966 to 1968. And then Jake Esterline.

He was Chief of Station from 1968 to 1973.

Now, what was the formal title of the group to which

you were assigned for the 9-year period?

well, when I first came in it was known as the

Special Activities Staff. It was headed by Desmond Fitzgerald.

And then, I believe after that it became the Cuban Operations

Group.

Now, was this a special group within the DDO of was

it attached to one of the area divisions?

A

No.

Foliowing the Bay of Pigs, they created a thing

called Task Force W which was headed by Bill Harvey. And

that -- when Harvey left, he went to Chief of station, Rome..

and Fitzgerald took over, it became Special Activities Staff.

It vasn't attached to anything except - it reported to the

Deputy Director, Plans.

And that was Mr. Karamessines?

A

Yes.

well, it was Helms at that time back when it

was first created. Heims was DDP at that time.

Q

And Task Force W was created immediately after the

Bay of Pigs?

Well, not immediately. I think sometime around

in the Bay of Pigs was in April. 'I think this was created in

September, something like that, 1961.

And that subsequently became the Special Activities

Staff?

Special Activities Staff and consequently became the

Cuban Operations Group. As the Cuban Operations Group it went

back into the Western Hemisphere Division.

And what was the date of that reorganization?

Yes, some place around there. It is in the midwest,

well, after the Bay of Pigs when Task Force l was

A

Yes.

Or was that shared with the Miami base, Miami

No. The Miami Station was under Task Force W.

All right.

Would that also be true of the Special

Activities Staff, the Cuban Operations Group?

Right, except that at the present time the Station

has no Cuban operations.

I understand that. When were Cuban operations termi-

At the Station? Let's see. Sternfield went down

there in 1972.

It was during fiscal year '72. I think it was

in early 1973.

it was a gradual reduction.

And have those operations been terminated entirely

or are they now run out of the washington area?

A

All Cuban operations are run out of washington.

strong a word.

well, the first knowledge I had of any discussions,

I was on IDY and this was October, November, 1963, with Fitzgerald

in Paris.

And I knew that he was going to meet - let ne put

it another way. I had overheard that discussions were going on

with a

member of Castro's military but that he wanted, as

I recall, he wanted some British -- I mean Belgian rifles and

I didn't participate in it because I was there for another

reason. And I know that subsequent to that time that Fitzgerald

met with him again and

I recall, as the personal representa-

tive of the Attorney Ceneral, Bobby Kennedy.

I provided all those files. There are 19 volumes that

we gave to your people. But I don't know who was reviewing

them.. I think Belin was going to do it himself.

Yes. He is. He is doing it himself:

You said there were

19 volumes of documents with

respect to this.

And Mr. Fitzgerald?

A

Yes, and I really can't recall some of the other

people. We were -- we had just moved the Station at that time,

in. Paris, out of the Embassy into the old Rothschild Palace

and we felt that it was probably bugged, so all conversations

took place -- we waiked around the garden and tyat type of

thing, and, you know, I was walking with somebody, somebody

was in front of me, and you just overhear conversations.

This was in Paris?

A

Yes.

I see.

Mr. Sanchez -- was he a member of the military?

No. Mr. Sanchez was in the Special Activities Staff.

He was stationed in Washington. And he was in contact with

Cuban military-type.

Was it your understanding that the Agency had received

instructions with respect to this activity from another

component of the Government?

A

Well, let me put it this way. I don't know whether

they received instructions. I have to assume, and I am pretty

positive, that this was a result of a Special Group decision.

And at this time you have to remember that Bobby Kennedy was

The only other thing that came to my attention was

that the decision was made not to provide him with this sight

Whether that is right of wrong, I don't know,

Agency?

A

Not to my knowledge.

Do you know whether or not Mi. Sturgis ever partici-

pated in any type of paramilitary or other operation against

Cuba?

A

On his own behalf he did, not on behalf of this

Agency.

2

How did you learn of those operations?

Through the newspaper. And through FBI reports.

Now, are these recent FBI reports?

A

Oh, no. These go back -- I know at one time, the

thing that comes to mind, I think he made a leaflet drop

over Cuba and this was subsequently reported in the press and

by the Bureau office in Miami.

Do you know who financed his activities?

A

I have no idea.

Is it possible that Mr. Sturgis' activities were

indirectly financed by the Agency through -

I don't see how. Frank Sturgis is a soldier of

fortune; has been. He has constantly tried to associate himself

with the Agency. When I went through his file they wanted me

to classify the file and the way I classified it was "don't

destroy it, he is an intelligence nuisance."

2. Have you caused the Agency records with respect to Mri.

Sturgis to be assembled in any one location?

Yes. Thave custody of them.

And what is the volume of that material?

As I recall, there are five volumes. Your Committee

called for them the other day after the article in the paper,

I guess it was last Saturday. They called for them Monday and

• ...

they returned them Monday afternoon.

Do you know who examined those files?

A

No, I don't.

You indicated a moment ago that Mr. Sturgis contacts

the DCD office in Miami with some freguency, is that correct?

A

well, not great frequency but he does with tidbits

of so-called information.

Is this information limited to narcotics, alleged

narcotics traffic?

A

Recently it has been.

Has Mr. Sturgis been encouraged by the DCD office

in Miami?

A

Mr. Sturgis has been told by the DCD office in Miami

to take his information to the Drug Enforcement Agency or the

FBI.'

Do you know whether

No manner.

Do they have any - do they periodically seek to

collect information from Mr. Sturgis?

A

I can't speak to

that but the records that we have

don't reflect. anything

like that. Before they would contact

somebody in that context, knowing that there is a 201 file

on Sturgis, they would have to coordinate with the Latin

American Division before they did anything since we do hoid

the file.

Would you briefly explain what a 201 file is?

A

A 201 file is a personnel file. It consists of any

information relating to an individual appearing in the press

as a result of other agency reporting and that type of thing.

Personnel or personality file?

A

Personality file, I should say. Excuse me.

Do you know whether of not there is any connection

or relationship between Eugenio Martinez and Mr. Sturgis?

A

well, I will say this. Obviously, they do know

each other. They have to know each other from their days

in Cuba.

pated with Martinez in raids against Cuba?

A

No. As I recall, we employed Martinez around 1961,

I guess, and he was in our maritime activities. He was a

boat captain eventually. And he did participate in infiltrations

and exfiltrations and perhaps one or two raids, hit and run,

sabotage-type actions against Cuba. Sturgis never engaged in

any of these things. He never did it for us nor did he ever

do it on any of our boats, planes, or - anything that belongs :

to the Agency.

When artinez would run such an operation of captain

a boat on such an operation, would he be charged with putting

together his own crew?

No. he had

an assigned crew and every boat had a

Case Officer operating either.out of the -- probably out of

the Miami Station. Sometimes I would assume that we did have

some people in the Key west base. But he, Martinez, would receive

his instructions and briefings from his Case Officer.

So it is likely that he could have brought Sturgis

along on any of these operations?

Absolutely unlikely. Oh, the guy whose name I was

trying to think oi, Chief of Station, John Dimmer.

And that would be.for a period of time between

Shackley and Henze?

Yes.

1964 to 1966?

Something like that.

activities conducted by the Special Activities Staff during

your -- and

subsequently the Cuban Operations Group during

your 9-year tenure with those groups.

A

Weil, there was - it was an across-the-board

intelligence operation consisting of collection of foreign

positive intelligence,

counterintelligence, paramilitary

activities, covert action, economic activities. That is about

the breadth of the thing.

Now, these were all conducted through the DDO?

Right.

Now, let's speak for a moment about the paramilitary

operations.

Were these operations run out of southern

Florida?

A.

Right.

2

And in particular out of the Miami Station?

A

Yes.

Were there any other CIA facilities in that area of

the country that participated in these activities?

A

Not to my knowledge..

Were there any southern harbors other than Miami

that were used in these activities?

A

well, we had activities down in the Keys also. As

I said, we did have a Key West base.

Here there any other bases in that area of the

country that were utilized in these operations?

I frankly don't know. They were down along the Keys,

along that long peninsula going down there. There were a

number of sites. I really can't recall them.

Were there any other sites within the United States

in which paramilitary training was conducted, for people

participating in these activities?

A

Not to my knowledge.

where were these people trained?

Well, Cubans who participated in these activities.

We trained them at these places we had in the keys.

Now, there also -- some of them were brought up here and trained

at the Domestic Training Station.

Where is that located?

That is down in Virginia.

Were any CIA personnel actually involved in these

raids?

A

Occasionally, I would think that - you have got to

understand at this time that we had a great many contract

Most of the paramilitary operations and the training was

conducted by the Special Operations Group which is another

entity of the --

DDO?

A

DDO.

Now, the facilities that we have been talking about,

training facilities, were manned, then, by the Special

Operations Group, or at least supervised by the Special

Operations. Group, is that correct?

vell, supervised, yes, and I would think that probably

some of the training was given by their people. The Domestic

Training Station is under the Office. of Training and -- but I

would think that in the paramilitary field that the SOG would

probably staif the training facility with their people who have

the expertise in paramilitary operations.

Now, were the people that were being trained at

these facilities basically Cuban refugees?

A

Yes.

And at the outset i take it not many of those people

were American citizens?

well, it is extremely large. I would think it is

probably - I was trying to think. I would say up towaras a

military people.

You spoke about paramilitary operations and covert

action. How do you distinguish between those two categories

of activities?

Well, actually one can fall into the other. The

paramilitary could fall into covert action but in those days

we did distinguish somewhat. A lot of the covert action was

media placement. We had a number of operations at -- legal-

type operations, harassment operations. For instance, Fidel

seized a great many art treasures ard in particular he had a

Napoleonic collection which was supposed to be the finest in

the world that he sold to dealers in Europe. He had paintings

that were immensely valuable that he tried to have auctioned

in London and the London auctioneer would not accept them

because he obviously didn't have clear title to them. He was

- they were stolen, in the eyes of the auctioneer. He was

forced to auction them in Toronto, Canada.

We ran legal operations, got the owners and had them

hire attorneys and bring them to court and this type of thing.

He seized these race horses. He tried to peddle them

in Europe and up in Canada. We ran opposition against that

Yes.

What other types of harassment activities did you

run that would fall under this covert

Would economic warfare be --

That was sort of something separate unto itself.

This was -- the economic warfare aspect of this thing was a

decision of the Special Group to enforce an economic blockade.

What special group is that?

It is now called the Forty Committee.

Is that 302 Committee?

A

Well, it was a 302 at one time,

too. First of all,

it was called the Special Group, CI, Counterinsurgency. Then

it went to the 302 and then it had another name in between

there and now it is the Forty Committee.

particularly when they were countries that we had treaties

Let's talk about each of those in turn. You said

you used moral suasion. what kind of activities are you

referring to?

A. Well, in the moral suasion field we - actually, we

were the catalyst in this whole thing and we had the legal

activities, the legal -- weil, I don't know how you would

phrase it, but we operated under the Cuban access control

regulations of the Treasury Department, the Trading with the

Enemy Act, and we aiso used the facilities of the Department of

Commerce, the Export Control people.

I guess as you are aware, Cuban industry was totally

U.S.-oriented. As parts began wearing out and this type of

We had

manufacturers and ask them to cooperate with them in denying

any spare parts to the Cubans. This was a fairly concentrated

effort to really isolate then.

All right. And that is what you were referring to

Yes.

Anything else in that category?

Not really. None that I can think of.

melted tar, and it can be cut into additives, lubricants, this

type of thing, and this was critical to the Cuban economy. So

we had an oil firm purchase this Bright Stock from a dealer for

which we reimbursed the guy and the Bright Stock was eventually

soid in Africa.

Do you know of any sales of such materials that

were made within the United States?

Resales, I should say.

Right.

Let's taik about economic warfare for a couple of

moments. Could you describe for me briefly the type of

economic activities that were conducted against Castro?

A

Well, first of all, we wanted to denigrate the

regime, his credit vorthiness, and this type of thing. We

worked very closely with the Coordinator of Cuban Affairs in

the State Department and, well, for instance, in those days, I

guess it was back in 1964, the price of sugar had jumped from

about a penny a pound to 13 cents a pound, something

like

that, and we couldn't understand why. So we kept -- Fidel kept

saying that he had such a

poor crop and this type of thing

and

we just couldn't figure out why he had such a poor crop because

some of our own island assets

told us they were out there cutting

this cane like mad and the mills were working 24 hours a day,

this type of thing. So subsequently, we found out that he was

lying and he was storing the raw cane in the schools, any

place. He had no storage lacilities and put it any place he

could.

So in cooperation with a couple of sugar brokers in

New York, we surfaced this lact and the price of sugar took a

real tumble and all of a sudden then Cuba started exporting.

It was this type of thing that obviously he was

trying to build up the worid price because he didn't have any

money, he was so short on his exchange, and obviously we didn't

want him to get the exchange.

So it was those types of

activities.

Was the assistance of any U.S. businessmen or U.s.

companies enlisted in that effort?

Oh, yes.

In what manner

did you use U.S. companies and

businessmen?

Well,

ie simply used them as the experts. A great

many - the sugar industry in Cuba was controlled by the

American community, by American bankers, and obviously they

lost everything when they had to pull out. Sugar is the

lifeline of Cuba as far

as any exchange, foreign exchange, this

type of thing, and it was

naturally our Number 1 target. So it

was only natural that we would go to the American businessmen.

What kind of assistance did you seek or obtain from

these businessmen?

A

well,

we sinply talked with them about why - you

know, the market conditions. were, why the price was

rising, if

ve could find out that fidel has plenty of sugar, what would

happen to the market price. This type of thing.

They were used as consultants, basically.

probably have people on detail from other - from the military

branches in the Government, but other than that I don't think

that - of course, during the Bay of Pigs operation we also

had people detailed into the Agency.

Now, the training of persons involved in maritime

operations, I take it, was conducted in part within the

United States and in part outside of the United States.

that correct?

Well, the infiltration operations, infiltrating

agents into Cuba, exfiltrating agents, hit and run sabotage

raids. That is about the extent of it.

shortly after the Bay of. Pigs?

I would - I think these operations were probably

at their height during the period about 1963 through, say,

1967. The program was terminated in 1968, I think in December

1968, something like that.

Why was the program terminated?

First of all, it was too expensive. It wasn't provid-

ing enough intelligence and it simply wasn't -- economically,

it wasn't feasible to continue these things. The agents were

getting wrapped up. We were - we just felt that the return

wasn't sufficient for what the investment was.

You say the agents were getting wrapped up.

A

Yes.

What do you mean by that?

When we infiltrated an agent, Cubans would identify

him and capture him.

were conducted by the Agency I trust were approved by the

Forty Committee?

Every operation received a specific approval from

the Forty Committee.

frequently - they would either approve the operation or say

no. These operations had to be planned well in advance because

the tides had to be right, the moon had to be in the proper

phase for communications and this type of thing. And these

things, all these were coordinated with the Joint Chiefs of

Staff, the Navy, the Coast Guard, the FBI. If we were

exiltrating people, the Immigration and Naturalization Service.

Every Government agency or enforcement agency or military

agency that had any involvement whatsoever, and the entire

thing was coordinated.

of these operations, you know, you would have to have a mother

ship in place and rubber boats and the UDI people to go in to

see if there were mines and this type of thing on the shore

before you go. So he may have considered that all these train-

ing exercises were operations but no way did he ever partici-

pate in any three or 400 active operations into Cuba.

operations launched?

A

They were mostly launched from the Keys.

Not to my knowledge.

a successful operation. By that, I mean they didn't do as

much damage as they wanted to because they had to get out

because the Cuban defense came after them. It was that type

of operation that we did.

As I recall, another time we took a team in to burn

some cane fields. Reaily, the classical operations that we

did in the maritime activities were the infiltrations and

exfiltrations.

Were any CIA operations run out of Guantanamo?

Are there any other categories of sabotage run out

well, we did lay down a cache, if you will, sabotage

kits to be used by our own island agents. They contained

sugar to dump into gas tanks and metal fragments to put down

crank cases. Things of this nature.

all the oil. We did that with a big operation. We made our

own oil, substandard. Additives, I should say, not oil. We

contracted with an American firm for that. And we shipped

it in through third countries in Europe. It did hit the target.!

The thing we wanted to get at was the oil and the

automotive machinery on the island. We knew it was breaking

down and if we could get a complete breakdown we would have

everything at a standstill because in those days the automotive

equipment wasn't coming in that rapidly from Europe because

Castro didn't ive the money to buy it and they weren't going

ta

extend the credit.

The railroad system was in total disaster. The

Soviets had such a long logistics line, supply line, plus

the fact that the Cubans didn't like the Soviet equipment

because they were used to good American equipment. And these

were principal targets that we were trying to get to.

In your experience at the Agency can you think of

any other analogus or similar paramilitary operations run

from a base in the United States?

No.

in the United States.

oh, yes.

As far as I am concerned, it is, yes.

Now, how large a Navy was actually organized in

Miami? On a previous occasion you described this to me as

the third largest Navy in the Caribbean.

That is right.

What kind of equipment did these people have?

A

Well, we had - honestly, everything from a canoe

up to three to 500 foot mother ship. We had Boston whalers,

rubber boats. We had a number of craft in, say, the 27 to

45 foot. length. And they looked like real tubs. They were

painted and they looked like they wouldn't even float but

they had the fastest engines in them. They could outrun any-

thing. They were extremely well armed. We had our under

water demolition teams. We had a pretty good Navy.

• Did these craft operate under non-official cover

in the Miami area?

A

Yes.

Were there a variety of covers or was there one

firm?

No. Variety.

Well, fishing companies, Geodetic Survey, marine

and these other entities were under commercial cover, of non-

official cover, I think we had 100 so cover companies.

Did any of these companies actually engage in any

legitimate commercial activities?

A

Not to my knowledge, no.

None of them - were any of them in competition with

firms in that area?

A

These are probably what we would call devised

facilities. They were probably registered with the State of

Florida and they paid taxes

and this type of thing, but if one

was. blown or became known, we just crossed that out of

existence and started up a new one.

What did Eugenio Martinez do when he wasn't running

these operations?

A

Well, he was down -- this is one of the reasons, as

I told you before, we brought him back and put him under that

contract, that retainer; because of the years that he spent

under such strict operational discipline down in the Keys.

Obviously, he didn't stay down there all the time. He

came back -- he might come back once a month,. or something

like that, to see his family, perhaps once every two weeks

if he got some time off.

I see. So some of these boats and personnel were

actually stationed full-time in the Keys.

A

Oh, yes. Oh, sure.

Were there any operations run out of the United

States which involved destruction of crops of poisoning of

sugar of anything of that sort?

What did you have in mind specifically? You mean the

Puerto Rican thing?

A

well, that is one of the things I had in mind.

10

11

Would you describe that for me?

A

well, this is, I guess you could term it a target of

opportunity. This was where a vessel was carrying Cuban sugar

to the Soviet Union and I forget exactly now what happened to

14 il

it but I know that it got a hole below the waterline, or

15

16

17

18

something, and had to put into Puerto Rico for repairs.

In order to repair it, I guess, and get it in the

drydock or wherever it

was, they had to remove the sugar and

put it in the warehouse and at that time I guess somebody came

up with a plan to try to widen the rift between -- there was

20

a rift at that time between the Soviets and Cubans and to

21

put a harmless substance into the sugar that would make it

22

acid, sour tasting, and it wouldn't harm the sugar or the

No. No.

In Cuban products?

Yes.

No.

Not that I recall. You see, Cuba really -- in

those days the only thing, Cuba was exporting sugar and nickel.

The agriculture sector of the economy was in absolutely total,

chaos. God, they didn't have any citrus, they didn't have

anything, and the poor people in Cuba were literally starving.

There just wasn't anything to eat. And Fidel was going around

with this big plan -- of course, there were a number of

experimental cattle ranches in Cuba. King Ranch had one there.

I forget - several other European and American companies that

had experimental cattle ranches there and they were experiment-

ing with the, you know, cross-breeding and this type of thing.

Fidel was preoccupied with this. He went up to

Canada and paid $100,000 for a bull and -- so he just put it

Operating stations, no.

Yes.

Yes, and in support of Cuban activity and other

couple hundred staffers there, full-time employees of the

Well, they were located on the south campus of the

the old Richmond Naval Air Station. It was a self-contained

unit. It was pretty well off the beaten path, in fact, damn

well off the beaten path. It was about four miles from the

Dixie Highway inland. We had our own guard force.

Official cover?

No. Non-official.

Engaging in any business?

No.

Now, in a community of that type, Cuban community,

how long could a non-official cover last?

A

Well, obviously it didn't, but it was research

activities. Funded -- it is a giant mechanism when you put

one of these things in for the funding and this type of thing,

• for your ostensible customers, establishing bank accounts.

Yes, I understand.

So it was a research activity and the only people that

ever paid any attention to the place were the newspapers. You

know, somebody would make an inquiry, you know, we can't accept

any work, we are loaded with Government contracts and this

type of thing, and it held up reasonably well. And out of

this one thing, of course, then we were running these innumera-

ble other covers with different activities. The guard

force, of course, were like -- well, they wore uniforms, similat

to the Pinkerton people and this type of thing. And I think

that there was -- in the later days at that site I think the

Department of Agriculture had offices in there and some other

Government agencies, in other buildings, of course.

And this particular Station, then, was under the

supervision of the group we have been discussing?

When did the Western Hemisphere Division resume

responsibilities for the Miami Station?

Well, when Des. Fitzgerald left as Chief of the

Special Activities Staff and became Chief of the Western

Hemisphere Division, he brought it back into the Division.

Is there presently a Miami Station?

A

Oh, yes.

And how large is it at the present time?

Well, since we -- I think when we closed down the

Cuban Operations, I don't know how large it is at the present

time because we are in one of these periods where we-are

reassigning people,.but I think by the end of this fiscal year

there are going to be between 11 and 14 people.

When you joined the group in 1963, what functions

were being performed by the Miami Station?

A

Well, all the classical intelligence functions.

I

think I have lined them out at one time - collection of

positive intelligence, counterintelligence, paramilitary, this

type of thing. Covert action.

This is the list of things you gave me earlier in

the deposition?

Yes.

So the Agency was conducting counterintelligence

activities in the Miami area?

Yes, sir.

Can you give me an example of the kinds of counter-

intelligence activities that the Agency would be conducting

Well, we had a number of joint operations, as I

recall, with the Bureau. We had identified a Castro agent that

came in by small boat and when she was -- she came in with a

number of other people. When she hit the -- they had a recep-

tion center up in Opa Loca that was really a HEW operation.

The Domestic Contact Division office had people out there and.

we did, too. Our people from the DDo were under

cover. When the lew people did the

preliminary interrogation of these people they had to fill

out forms, where were you born, this type of thing, biographic-

type thing. These forms would be passed to our people who

would.

look at the forms and based on previous experience or what

they might have been doing, ad they felt that perhaps they

might have some information of intelligence value, they would

reinterrogate them.

It was in this manner that this gal came to our

knowledge. We surveilled her for a long time and determined

that obviously she was receiving messages and she was

sending messages. So along with the Bureau we put a surveillande

on her and we obtained a van with DE equipment in it and

indeed, she went on the air in the morning at 5:00 o'clock

or 4:30 or whatever it was, and the direction finder found

it was being beamed toward Cuba, this type of thing, and that

was oen of the examples of the CI activities we were involved

in.

Were there many activities of that type?

Not really. You have got to remember that the

Bureau's Cuban squad was fairly small. I mean, it was a large

squad in terms of FBI squads. It had 36 people on it, some-

thing like that, but 36 people trying to follow a couple of

hundred thousand Cubans around, you know, it is pretty nega-

tive. This was one of the reasons that obviously from

in those days when we had formed these revolutionary fronts

which were being run by the Cuban exiles, they were reporting

to Case Officers and they would report on things in the

community, of people they thought were suspect and this type

of thing. These leads in turn were then given to the Bureau

and it was to this extent that we got ourselves involved

in CI activity.

Would it be fair to say that the involvement in CI

activities in that area was primarily a function of the over-

whelming number of these people and the Bureau's inability

to properly staff the thing?

Yes, yes. You have got to remember, too, that a lot

of the people on that Cuban squad were in the legal section

of the Embassy in Havana. You know, the FBI overseas is

known as Legal Attaches, obviously working out of the Embassy

the same as our Station was, and a lot of our Station officers

from Havana were down in Miami at that time. So there was a

relationship there that had gone over a period of years

between the Agency and the Bureau.

largest CIA station in the world?

The largest CIA station in the world.

At its height?

A.

Nothing comes anyplace close to it.

I wonder if you could describe briefly for the record

what the mors were.

A.

Well, the AMÖTS were Cuban a Cuban intelligence

organization in exile. We full intended - this was part of the

overall contingency plan that US Government had. Should Castro

ever be overthrown, these people would be the nucleus to go into

Cuba and form a new Ministry of the Interior.

Now, Ministry of the Interior, is that a euphemism

for Security Agency?

A.

Well, in most countries of the world the Ministry of

Interior, unlike ours, is the security force, internal and.

I am referring to debriefings of newly arrived exiles

or perhaps exiles that had been in the country whom during their

time here had acquired new information.

How were those - how and where were those debriefings

conducted?

A.

A.

Well, normally the debriefings were conducted at Opa

That is the Air Base?

That is the old Air Base there but that is where the

reception center was for all the Cuban refugees coming in.

Sometimes if there was going to be a lengthy debriefing, we had

a residence which we rented and the interior was changed into.

small rooms like this where you could bring people in, sit them

down, under controlled conditions, and debrief them without any

interference and this type of thing.

For how long a period did these debriefings go on?

A.

You mean in terms of vears?

Yes.

A.

Well, I would think that I would probably say from

about 1962, and I think the debriefings as such, of course --

we relied principally on the airlift for the people coming out

and when the airlift was cut off, which Castro did -- cut off

about, I quess about 1970 or '71, in that timeframe --

I see.

A.

_ that stooped the flow of the refugees, so we just

terminated that part of the activity.

Well, in addition to debriefing refugees that came

in in the airlift, did the smaller group of AMOTS have any other

intelligence gathering functions -

A.

NO.

In the community?

A.

Well, I can't give you a real yes or no to that. I

would suppose that there is an outside possibility they could

have been used to debrief people within the community, within

the Cuban community, but we had in the organization - all these

people were Cuban with the exception of we had what we call an

On-Site Case Officer, who was a fulltime staff employee and he

had a couple of assistants; including a secretary. These people

were directly under his control. Though the organization as it

was set up, they had their own chief and this type of thing,

but the chief took his instructions from the On-Site Case Officer.

of course, if these people went out and did something on

their own, they could do things we were not aware of, obviously.

You can't - you know what they are doing during their eight or

ten hours that they are going to work everyday but once they

leave, we don't know what they are up to.

Did they have CIA credentials?

A.

No sir, because

they were proprietary hires of this

commercial cover.

Did CIA levy any intelligence requirements upon these !

people other than in their duties - in their debriefing

capacity, I should say?

A.

No. When -- there were - obviously there was a

standard debriefing form that covered questions of intelligence

interest or a battle, you know, anything - economic questions.

morale, and this type of thing. When these questions - when.

these people were cebriefed and the debriefer wrote up the

report, it would be sent from the AMOTS over. to the Station.

If the debriefing report contained something of positive

intelligence, of that nature, the Case Officer - well, not the

Case Officer but a staffer in the Station may or may not jot

down some additional requirements and ask that that person be

recontacted and asked specific questions.

Now, in addition to debriefing, what else did this

smaller broup of AMOIS do for the Agency in the Miami area?

A.

This was their prime purpose.

which would be secretaries, translators, strictly administrative

types.

I don't think there were more than probably 12 or 15

in that group, if there were that many.

MR. MANFRADI: Off the record.

(Off the record discussion)

BY MR. MANFREDI: Back on the record.

Before we move on to further discussion of the AMOTS

could you briefly describe for me what role the CIA plays in

resettling Cuban emigres?

À.

CIA doesn't resettle Cuban emigres.

What Agency is charged with that responsibility?

A.

Health, Education and Welfare.

Does CIA play any role in that process?

A.

We may assist if we are. asked but the idea of the whole

airlift was having relatives here. for somebody to claim you when

you came in so you wouldn't become a ward of the State of the

Government, and normally when

these refugees came in, they were

processed through the center and then they had a place down

on

Biscayne Boulevard they called. Freedom House and this was, of

course, all run by HEW, and they - if need be and they had to

stay overnight or stay several days, HEW would put them up and

care for them in Freedom House.

Then as soon as they could, of course, they would move them

to the areas where they wanted to resettle them, where the

relatives were, this type of thing, and we had nothing to do

with that whatsoever.

Turning back. to the AMOTS, and to the larger of the

two groups, what was the name of that group again?

A.

We can call them

for short?

A.

Really, they are both -- the only reason we separated

the two groups was for security because we had one group housed

over here and the smaller groun was over here. Obviously we

couldn't bring these refugees into the larger establishment, so

that is why we took the smaller establishment to preserve some

cover.

Well, the larger group was engaged in the collection

of intelligence.

They compiled dossiers on the principals

inside Cuba. They carded - they kept card files on every

refugee that came through the reception center.

They provided

they did do economic and social reporting. They put out a

monthly newsletter based on the information they collected.

The information these people collected as opposed to the

information we collected, ther's was all unclassified. That

came from -- all the information they had came from human sources

We subscribed - well, the proprietary

subscribed to a number, a great many newspapers, periodicals,

Spanish language type things.

Well, they were doing clandestine collections as well,

weren't they?

A.

I don't know if you could call it clandestine. What

did you have in mind?

Well, would they run agents in the community?

A.

Well, ves, there were penetrations of the Cuban

community, yes.

And that is clandestine collection, isn't it?

A.

WEll, I call that human resources.

D.

All right. Where are these files now?

A.

They are in the Headquarters here. A great many of

them were really destroyed. It got to be rather comic. We

went down there several years ago just looking through the files

to see what kind of shape they were in and they had such great

information for intelligence value in there as a picture of a

gal who might be the daughter of a Cuban refugee who just won

a swimming meet. It got rather ridiculous. So we purged those

files and took out that material, you know, which just didn't

have any pertinancy at all.

How are the files organized? You indicated before that

23

there is a card, index card for each Cuban refugee?

24

A.

Right.

25

Are there. soft cover files as well?

course, we had targets for recruitment. It could range from

anything from a first mate, a captain or chief engineer of a

Cuban maritime vessel to Fidel. When we targeted these people

as possible recruitments, for possible recruitment, we would ask

that all the information on that individual be assembled so that

we could do a complete target study -- habits, you know,

everything right down the line. In case of some of the more

important ones, of course, we had psychological studies prepared

where we had enough information. But this is one of the things!

these people did. If we said we want everything you have on the

first mate of the - one of the Cuban ships, then they would

start looking through the papers or anything else to come up

with anything they could on what the guy's current activities

are, his background, his life habits, this type of thing.

service of Cuba?

Well -

For example, let me ask you this. Were any of these

files on Cubans who were

suspected or thought to be a possible

internal security problem?

A.

No. No. They didn't keep those types of files.

We

would simply task them

with through your sources what do you

have on so and so. They would not be told the reason why we

wanted the information on anybody.

Well, I quess with several million fiels or several

million cards and tens of thousands of files it is difficult to

make generalizations about the kind of information that is in

those files?

Well, that is right.

So I guess I won't ask you to do so, but I want to ask

you this. I trust that there is the possibility that some of

these files do contain what you in the trade refer to as deroga-

tory information?

A.

I would assume so.

And that so much of them may - some of the subjects

of those files may now be American citizens?

A.

Right.

And finally I take it that no effort has been made to

study that particular situation?

A.

WEll, we did make an effort to do it at one time.

whether they are on an island of perhaps other places, their

names turn up on manifests and this type of thing. Well, these

were all transferred back here in Miami, we did go through them

What else did they do, this larger group of AMOTS that

was not doing debriefings?

A.

Well, when they were trained in trade craft we would

send them to other countries, in Europe and within the Hemisphere

to train some of the local services in those countries. They

served as safe housekeepers in other countries. They served in

listening posts where we had audio -

Foreign listening posts?

Oh, yes, foreign.

No, no.

conducted by them.

conduct in the Cuban community in Miami?

community, as I said earlier, were some of the militant anti-

up the wall and, of course, I guess it was around - the

Government allowed a lot of this to go on for awhile but I guess

about 1965 or 1964 they got a little tired of it and they

started to tighten up.

I am sure the AMOTS were in part responsible for proposing

alerting us and in turn we alerted the enforcement agencies when

there was going to be a raid against Cuba by one of these

militant groups.

A number. of times raids were aborted, picked

up by the Coast Guard or Florida Coastal Patrol or the Bureau,

this type of thing.

These people were arrested?

A.

Oh, yes.

Not really.

are still after this Masferrer and this guy Donestevez. I don't

know if they ever did get him in jail but they had him up on

so many charges and he was a Cuban exile that made it big here.

He was a boat manufacturer, small boats, but whether he ever

well, originally they were set up to assist with the

As we phased down the maritime activities, they were made

available to intercept Cuban communications. NSA tasks them with

the frequencies they wanted covered and the Cuban Communications

nets they wanted covered, such as the border guards. Another

important one was the sugar network. We had the border guards,

sugar, transportation, maritime. I think there was an interior

network they covered too.

But all electronic intercept coverage.

Now, since they belong to us we could levy ceratin require

ments on them if we wanted to, which we did very infrequently

because the common interests, - we have a common interest in

what NSA has an interest in and unless there were one particular

operation going that they wanted to cover exactly what the Cubanis

were doing, then we would task our people with that.

For instance, we knew a Cuban vessel was taking arms into

Africa and our operators

saw the thing leave Havana and then

there was absolute silence. So nobody knew where the thing was.

But we knew arms were being loaded and we finally located the •

boat in an African port, I mean the intercept operators did, when

The Agency subsidized these fronts in an effort to

that the records were not available as to how much sick leave

A

No. There was but there isn't any more.

There

hasn't been one there for years.

When was it disbanded?

A

I think the station was established around 1958

and -- perhaps it was

established before that. I think it

went out of existence in 1958.

Do you know why it went out of existence?

No, I don't.

I don't have any idea.

2

Do you now what function it was performing?

A

(dods in negative.)

2

You mentioned earlier that Bernard Barker worked

in the Cuban community for the CIA?

He worked with these fronts, too.

Was he periorming any intelligence function in the

community?

Intelligence functions. Well --

Was he coilecting information?

A

sure. Is he got information that he thought was

worthwhile he wouid pass it on.

Now, ould ie have been considered one of the three

or 500 persons empioved or assigned to the Miami Station?

xes. He was a contract employee.

And vere intelligence requirements levied on such

contract

employees?

Normally, the requirements are pretty standard,

or they were at that time.

But here again, you always have

ad hoc type things that pop up from time to time, and have to

be surfaced.

Some of these contract employees were, then, in

the business of coilecting intelligence information in the

Cuban communities in Miami.

A

Right.

Now, I thinks ive

• Einished with the AMOTS but can

you think of any other functions performed by the AMOTS that

we have not discussed in the course of the afternoon?

io, not really.

I think you previously described them for me as the

eyes and ears into the Cuban community.

Right.

And they actually had a physical facility in Miami

which was their headquarters, did they not?

Exactly.

Ind there was a CIA Case Officer who managed to super-

vise that facility.

A

Yes.

Now, what has happened to the AMOTS?

The AMOTS were craduaily phased down and will go

out of existence -- the AMOTS are out of existence, aren't

they? Isn't it the AMDUKEs or - these are the radio people.

The AlDUKES are AMOTS but they are radio people.

They are the ones that conducted the intercept

Yes. The only reason we use two different names

is that in each of these things in those days we had to have

a project which nad to be renewed every year to get the

Now, turning to the Miami Station's involvement for

assistance to the Secret Service in connection with the

political conventions in 1968 and 1972, would you briefly

describe for me the nature of the assistance provided by

the Agency to the Secret Service?

At the request of the Secret Service we conducted

name traces on individuals whom the Secret Service wanted

traced. These ircludedthe employees of all hotels in Miami

employees of catering services, linosine service, employees

is a big auditorium down there. I forget what they call it.

Foreign news people and media, television, radio people.

Were these people on whom name traces were requested

all foreign nationals?

A

2

All foreign nationals.

Was there any check made to determine whether

any of them were American citizens?

We levied on the Secret Service as a requirement

that they have identified these people by nationality before

we would run a name trace. Inadvertently, at one time

they did submit a list, a rather long list of American citizens

which we promptly sent

back to them and told them we could

not trace.

And this practice was followed both in 1968 and

1972?

The

here. In the case of Cubans, probably the Miami Station had

more information on the Cubans than we would have back here.

But the names were traced through Agency files?

all the names that have been traced.

2

Why have

those records been maintained?

there

any reason those

records have been maintained?

Hell, because we were told to maintain them when

Ok.

Jre you aware of any picketing at various

places in the country that has been conducted by Cuban

groups?

I was not

aware of it until I was told of it.

I still don't know whether this was a spontaneous action on

the part of these

people of whether they were instructed to

do it. I tried to run that down and I have been unable to.

At what locations has it been reported that pickets

were located?

Airline offices in New York, Miami. I think another

place. I forget where it was.

Have you in fact been able to verify that these

persons were Cubans?

and I think they were carried

in the Anderson column but we

made file checks and this type of thing. One particular

activity was supposed to have been carried out in Rockefeller

Center in New York and i turns out it was taken out of

There are no domestic activities at all in the

here to Headquarters. The lami Station now is completely

and solely involved in the intelligence in the Caribbean.

2

Does the liami Station - I beg your pardon --

does the Headquarters component that now handles the Cuban

situation in Miami run any agents in the Cuban community?

No. Well, let me explain that to you. ile do have

a career agent who has

been with us for a good many years.

in Miami and we do use him to contact relatives of Cubans

who are still in Cuba. I mean, relatives who are in the u.s.

who have relatives in Cuba.

Now, this is cone principally with the idea of a

recruitment target, determine weaknesses of strengths, this

type of thing. lle does contact these people all over the

United States. If we come across an individual that. looks like

he might be recruitable, or yerhaps we could even double him,

we will, after we make our reliminary assessment, and we

find out where relatives ans these types of people are, we

will ask this career agent er instruct him to go contact

these people, be it jew for:, New Jersey, Chicago, or what-

ever.

So you use Cuban, row citizens or aliens in this

county,

as access agents.
