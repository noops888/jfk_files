A Europe. Some were run out of Miami but the big ones
were run out of Europe.
Q Well, in the course of your activities with respect

to Cuba did you have occasion to become familiar with the

operations of the Miami base?

A Yes.

Q And the situation in the Cuban community in Miami?

A Yes, sir.

Q During the nine years you were with ppo's Cuban
operations, who was -- who were the chiefs of the Miami
Station?

A : I think in 1963 Ted Shackley was the Chief and he
was followed by -- I can’t think of his name. I should know

it..Well, I will come back to that.
Then, the next Chief of Station was Paul Henze.
Q What years was he Chief?

‘Baul was there about a year and a half. He

A I think
left in 1969 when we reduced the size of the Station. Let's
say Hende was there from 1966 to 1968.
He was Chief of Station from 1968 to 1973.

established contact?

A No manner.

Q Do they have any -- do they periodically seek to

collect information from Mr. Sturgis?
A I can't speak to that but the records that we have

don't reflect.anything like that. Before they would contact

somebody in that context, knowing that there is a 201 file
on sturgis, they would have to coordinate with the Latin
American Division before they did anything since we do held
the file.

Q Would you briefly explain what a 201 file is?

A : A 201 file is a personnel file. It consists of any

information relating to an individual appearing in the press

as a result of other agency reporting and that type of thing.

Q Personnel or personality file?
A Personality file, I should say. Excuse me.
Q De you know whether or not there is any connection

or relationship between Eugenio Martinez and Mr. Sturgis?

A Well, I will say this. Obviously, they do know

each other. They have to know each other from their days

in Cuba.

pated with Martinez in raids against Cuba?

A Weil, first of all, we wanted to denigrate the

regime, his credit worthiness, and this type of thing. We

worked very closely with the Coordinator of Cuban Affairs in

the State Department and, well, for instance, in those days, I

guess it was back in 1964, the price of sugar had jumped from

about a

&
=

penny a pound to 13 cents a pound, something like
that, and we couldn't understand why. So we kept -- Fidel kept

saying that he had such a zoor crop and this type of thing and

we just couldn't figure out why he had such a poor crop becauset

128 some of cur own island assets told us they were out there cuttihg

dike mad and the mills were working 24 hours a day,

Tt was this type of thing that obviously he was

trying to build up the world price because he didn't have any |

money, he was so short on his exchange, and obviously we didn' :

want him to get the exchange, So it was those types of

activities.

9 Was the assistance of any U.S. businessmen or U.S.

companies enlisted in that effort?

A oh, yes.

2 In what manner cid you use U.S. companies and i
businessmen?

A Well, we simply used them as the experts. A great
many ~- the sugar industry in Cuba was controlled by the

American community, by American bankers, and obviously they !
lost everything when they had to pull out. Sugar is the :

{
* : . : .

type of thing, and it was naturally our Number 1 target. So it :

was only natural that we would go to the American businessmen.

agents into Cuba, exfiltrating agents, hit and run sabotage
raids. That is about the extent of it.

shortly after the Bay of. Rigs?

A r would -- I think these operations were probably

at their height during the period about 1963 through, say,

1967. The program was terminated in 1968, I think in December

1968, something like that.

Q Why was the program terminated?

no. These operations had to be planned well in advance because
the tides had to be right, the moon had to be in the proper
phase for communications and this type of thing. And these
things, all these were coordinated with the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, the Navy, the Coast Guard, the FBI. If we were
exiltrating people, the Immigration and Naturalization Service,
Every Government agency or enforcement agency or military
agency that had any~involvement whatsoever, and the entire
thing was coordinated.

Q Do you know of any such paramilitary operations

that were run unbeknownst to the Forty Committee?

A No.

Q What kind of volume of operations are-we talking
about?

A You are not talking about a very big volume of

operations because of the planning that had to go into these
things. I would say that probably at the height of the thing
they may be running three or four a month. No more than that.

Q You have heard Eugenio Martinez refer to having

run 300 operations.

A I have seen that.
Q Is that inaccurate?

something, and had to put into Puerto Rico for repairs.

In order to repair it, I guess, and get it in the

up with a plan to try to widen the rift between ~~ there was

put a harmless substance into the sugar that would make it
acid, sour tasting, and it wouldn’t harm the sugar or the

Q Which of these activities, if any of them were
actually being conducted within the Cuban community in Miami?

A Well, the collection of foreign positive and probably
counterintelligence. : /

Q So the Agency was conducting counterintelligence
activities in the Miami area?

A Yes, sir.

Q Can you give me an example of the kinds of counter-
intelligence activities that the Agency would be conducting
in that area or was conducting in the area at that time?

A Well, we had a number of joint operations, as I
recall, with the Bureau. We had identified a Castro agent that

came in by small boat and when she was -- she came in witha |
number of other people. When she hit the -- they had a recep- i
tion center up in Opa Loca that was really a HEW operation.

The Domestic Contact Division office had people out there. and

we did, too. Our people from the DDO were under

cover. When the people did the

preliminary interrogation of these people they had to. fill

cut forms, where. were you born, this type of thing, biegraphic+
type thimg. These forms would be passed to our-peopte who would
look at the forms and based on previous experience or what
they might have been doing, md they felt that perhaps they
might have some information of intelligence value, they would

reinterrogate them. ,

It was in this manner that this gal came to our
knowledge. We surveilled her for a long time and determined
that obviously she was receiving messages and she was
sending messages. So along with the Bureau we put a surveillante
on her and we obtained a van with DF equipment in it and
indeed, she went on the air in the morning at 5:00 o'clock
or 4:30 or whatever it was, and the direction finder found
it was being beamed toward Cuba, this type of thing, and that
was cen of the examples of the CI activities we were involved i

in.

Q Were there many activities of that type?

A Not really. You have got to remember that the
Bureau's Cuban squad was fairly smali. I mean, it was a large H
squad in terms of FBI squads. It had 36 people on it, some-
thing like that, but 36 people trying to follow a couple of
hundred thousand Cubans around, you know, it is pretty nega-
tive. This was one of the reasons that obviously from. --
in those days when we had formed these revolutionary fronts
which were being run by the Cuban exiles, they were reporting
to Case Officers and they would report on things in the |
community, of people they thought were suspect and this type
of thing. These leads in turn were then given to the Bureau
and it was to this extent that we got ourselves involved
in CI activity.

Q Would it be fair to say that the involvement in CI

to properly staff the thing? :

A : ‘Yes, yes. You have got to remember, too, that a lot
of the people on that Cuban squad were in the legal section
of the Embassy in Havana. You know, the FBI overseas is
known aS Legal Attaches, obviously working out of the Embassy

the same as our Station was, and a lot of our Station officers

from Havana were down in Miami at that time. So there was a

A You mean in terms of vears?
Oo Yes.
A Well, I would think that I would probably say from

about 1962, and I think the debriefings as such, of course --
we relied principally on the airlift for the people coming out
and when the airlift was cut off, which Castro did -- cut off
about, I guess about 19709 or '71, in that timeframe --

A -~ that stopped the flow of the refuqees, so we just

in in the airlift, did the smaller group of AMOTS have any othe

A Well, I can't give you a real yes or no-to that. I

would suppose that there is an outside possibility they could

have been used to debrief people within the-community, within

the Cuban community, but we had in the organization -- all these

people were Cuban-with the exception-of we had what we call an

On-Site Case Officer, who was a fulltime staff: emplovee and he

had a couple of assistants; including a-secretarv. ‘These people

A. No sir, because they were proprietary hires of this
commercial cover,

Oo Did CIA levy any intelligence requirements upon these |
people other than in their duties -- in their debriefing H
capacity, I should say?

A No, When -~ there were -~ obviously there was a
standard debriefing form that covered questions of intelligence
interest or a battle, you know, anything -- economic questions,
morale, and this type of thing. When these questions -~ when.
these people were cebriefed and the. debriefer wrote up the
report, it would be sent from the AMOTS over. to the Station.

If the debriefing report contained something of positive
intelligence, of that nature, the Case Officer -- well, not the
Case Officer but a staffer in the Station may or may not jot
down some additional requirements and.ask that that person be
recontacted and asked specific. questions.

A

ion We can call them for short? i
A. Really, they are both -~ the onlv reason we separated

the two groups was for security because we had one group housed |

over here and the smailer group was over here. Obviously we |

couldn't bring these refugees into the larger establishment, so

that is why we-took the smaller establishment to preserve some

cover. i
Q : Okay. What activities was the larger group engaged | -
in?
A WE11, the larger group was engaged in the collection

of intelligence, Shey compiled dossiers on the principals
inside Cuba. They carded -= they kept card files on every
refugee that came through the reception center. They provided 7-
they did do economic and social reporting, They put out a
monthly newsletter based on the information they collected.

Cuban maritime vessel to Fidel. When we targeted these people
as possible recruitments, for possible recruitment,we would ask
that all the information on that individual be assembled so that
we could do a complete target studv -- habits, you know, |
