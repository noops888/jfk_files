holiday, with Doris MULLER (to whom he is now married) to HARTENSTEIN

The trip was arranged under the auspices of the

FDGB and McLANE obtained a concessional fare rate. They stayed with

an aunt of Doris MULLER (a sister of her mother) who lives in or near

HARTENSTEIN.

MCLANE wanted to start work in HARTENSTEIN, but

permission was refused.

and MULLER returned to BAUTZEN on

24 Nov 57 and MeLANE

in the BAUTZEN Schlaohthof on 25

Nov 57, where he is still employed.

No estimate.of his income could

be obtained.

Doris MULLER is not at present working.

MCLANE is

still living at Grosse Brudergasse.

MCLANE and MULLER appear to be

living quite happily together and MULLER has not been involved in any

immoral escapades with other men for some time.

MCLANE i8 a quiet

sort of person,

who does not drink

very much and cause trouble and is

quite well thought of by

the DDR authorities.

He is not politically

is not-pregnant, as was previously reported.

McLANE has now started

wearing spectaoles,

but for reading only.

MCLANE was at one time

friendly with HEMMINGS, but now seems to have transferred his friend-

ship back to DOWNIE and MCLANE assisted DOWNIE to move into the latter's

new flat in BAUTZEN.

It wais not known if Doris MULLER had been

employed by the MfS in any capacity whilst she was in BERLIN, but

thought quite likely. that she was being used as a casual informant by

the MfS in BAUTZEN.

No further information available.

from a holiday on

coast at KUHLUNGSBORN is now history.

Anni snu,

was. soon discarded and she is at present still living in BAUTZEN,

DOWNIE and Margot GOTTSCHALK are always at

loggerheads, which is often caused by GOTTSCHALK's sexual habits.

They often fight and GOTTSCHALK hits DOWNIE with household articles

and she, in turn, is usually beaten-up' by DOWNIE.

These fights

often take place

in the presence of other defectors.

Although they

are always fighting amongst themselves,

no permanent

separation ever

takes place and they stick together

against outsiders.

They are NOT

yet married.

Margot GOTTSCHALK's mother (Frau Martha LEHMANN) has

to her daughter to the effect that the family now disown their

daughter and that she (the mother) does not wish to

see her daughter

Frau LEHMANN has also written to other members of the renegade

colony in BAUTZEN to the same effect with the request that these

inform the daughter and DOWNIE what the mother has written.

During the evening of 22 Nor 57, Mrs MURPHY (wife

RA 14479240 Clifford MURPHY, AWOL wef 14 Nov 53) and Mrs MURPHY's

left BAUTZEN for a visit to BERLIN..

They returned to BAUTZEN

the early morning of 25 Nov 57.

BERLIN they

visited GOTTSCHALK'S

mother in BERLIN-SPANDAU and told her about the

life DOWNIE and GOTTSCHALK are leading.

They were given messages

of abuse to pass on to DOWNIE/GOTTSCHALK upon their return to BAUTZEN.

It was believed that anonymous letters have been sent to Frau LEHMANN

about the behaviour of DOWNIE/GOTTSCHALK and it was suspected in

BAUTZEN that these letters had been written by Doris MULLER (wife of

McLANE as GOTISCHALK and MULLER were, at one time, not on speaking

terms with öne another.

The returned BRITISH defector POWELL wrote

to DOWNIE on one or two occasions after his return to the WEST and

suggested that DOWNIE too might try to return.

DOWNIE showed these

letters to SCHATTEL (Club-leader)..

DOWNIE is at present 2nd 'secretary

of the FDJ, although reputed not to be very politically minded.

He is quite friendly with Wolfgang NOACK (teacher and interpreter at

the club-house) and it was not thought likely that DOWNIE will return

to the WEST at the moment, however, DOWNIE's actions were described

as being completely unpredictable.

No further

information available.
