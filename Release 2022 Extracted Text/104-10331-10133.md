NOTE FOR: (Thomas J, Rallwe}-C- @ DCI

FROM: John F, Pereira
DATE: 01/24/97 10:42:39 AM
SUBJECT: Seventh Floor View on JFK Board Extension

Tom,
| would appreciate your advice on the following:

The Executive Director (David Marwell) of the JFK Assassination Records Review Board called
me to say that he is drafting a letter to Senator Specter proposing a one-year extension for the Board.
The Board's charter expires on 30 September 1997 unless Congress grants an extension. (This was the
subject of a memo, dated 2 January, that | sent to the ADCI via the EXDIR.)

Marwell wants to include in the letter something about CIA's view, or-likely view, on the extension.
Is there anyone on the 7th floor who might want to provide a response that | could pass to Marwell ? (in
the absence of a response, Marwell probably will say something like, â€œthe Board has no reason to
believe that CIA would object to an extension."

cc:
