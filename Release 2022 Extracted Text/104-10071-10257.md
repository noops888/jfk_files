During a recent training period on interrogation with

a (HUGLI8) Case Officer, the point of getting information from

suspects on their international contacts or information that

might help other services was stressed.

Apparently, as a result,

# the, HUGLIB Cage Officer dug into his notes on the interrogation

of Ricardo Ismael VALLECILLO Perez, Guatemalan FAR member, and

came up with the

following, information which he thought woFIRM

might want to pass to the

2.

VALLECILLOS stated (the Interrogation took place in

December, 1967) that FAR was awasting the arrival of new type

machine-pistol called the Red Star (Estrella Roja) from Cuba.

He stated that it was a 28 shot weapon and would be issued to

commanders of Guerrilla Groups to replace the present Browning

semi-autos.

He then added that the individuals in charge of

Diaz and Adelo (or Abeldo)

to a sarcastic remark made by the Case Officer about the

efficacy of the FAR gun-running mechantam.

EUGLIB-10 has diven his permission to pass this infor-

to the

if it 1s considered of any

by HOFIRM.
