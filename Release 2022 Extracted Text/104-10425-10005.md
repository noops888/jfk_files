We don't have to do research and

create a document for this requester.

Is such a "list" in existence?

I questioned Scott Breckinridge

about it. He said that the IG

Staff did not have a list, and

he doubted whether CI Ops did.

(FYI: D'Unger has requested

Warren Commission documents from

NARS. NARS has steered him toward

the Agency re a couple of classified

Items, so we can expect other re-

quests.)

RETUPH TO:

I have

attached a copy of Mr

Crooks' speed letter, which

provides an informative and

responsive answer to Mr. D'Unger.

We should hold the line on the

proper classification of the

documents.

, This should then be

extended to the list of docu-

ments, since the subject

entries were deliberately made

as informative as possible.

Thus we cite exemptions (b) (1)

(properly classified) and

(b) (3) (sources and methods).
