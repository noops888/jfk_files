the Congolese Government way rapidly weakening.

First,

WIROGUE had endorsed sending one o. the advisors with the congolese Alr

Force to surope to purchase planes and later lound WIuaRu/4 was at leagt

cognizant of e second GOS rapresentative

sent to jurope on the gane mission.

NIROGUE nado vague references to some 2,000,000 Congolese Frines of the

40,000,000 available for airplane purchases

"going. into soneone's pocket."

¡L#OGE vag inconsed at the move of the tou in sending a parallel m18810

to Europe and not informing hin of it.

He saw WIZARD/2 and Baked abou

this other mission.

WIZARD/2 apparently Inforrod HIZARD/4 about

WIROGUS'& visit and since then, for a period of the last livo days,

"IZaRD/4 has refusod

to see or talk to HIdodus.

The GOd has also ajparently proposed sending HIROGUE on an

intelligence gathering mission to Katanga.

HIROGUS aaked if KUBARK were

interested in this undertiking.

He advised him strongly ajainat this

move and added we hid no interest whatsoever in the projoot.

HIROTUS has also net the ODOATE representative and showed him

the model subrarine which was the subjact of ACLi-630.

representative ovinced interest in this nodel and through the ODIT

representative, whoin i IROGUS has seen on several occasions and discussed

the probler of purchasing planes for tho GOt, the ODOATH representative

was avaro that HIkOCUS has an Ordre de Misaion signed by WIZARD/2 to

travel to PBP.aG.

He said for "IPOJJB to inform him when he was ready

to depart and he would arrange for kIROGUE to conteot appropriate ODOATH

paople in PEPRILE to discusa the nodel.

4. KIROGUE approached GUTEZiAl on Movember 24 and SALVACK on November

a request whether he might be of use to KUBARK oither in Afrioa

or elsewbore in the world; and that he would like to be taken back into

He is obviously concerned about his position in the COC at this

time and feels with the diploatic relations being estauliabed between

Belgium and the GOC that his position will becone increasingly weaker. To

reenphasize past assessmerts of HIROGUE, he is far too disorganized an

individual to be

an effective FI agent but would probably be useful where

action is required but detailed accurate reporting is not. Ihe station

Bgrees with

an early statenent made concerning NIHOCUS that he has a

peculiar turn of mind which lends itself remarkably to nefarious and

extra-legal activities but would add that these activities should be of
