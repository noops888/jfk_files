_ Be ACLA 630 dated 19 Ootober.1961

“WIROGUS's visit and since then, for @ period of the last five daya,

ay

DIB: 25730 ~~”

: 0n.'29 Novabber 1961~i:I20GUS told the undersigned that he felt bis
position’ vii Governzent. way rapidly weakening. Firat,

n vis the -Yongole:
WIROGUS-had endorsed sénding on the advisors with'the-Congolese Air
and later found WIiaRb/4 was at least

Forcéto Surope: to purciase plan
gnizant of @.sdcond GOS representative sent to-Surope on the eame mission.
to sone 2,000,000 Congolese Frincs of the

0 4,000 available for aifplane piirchasea "going. into sone0né’s pocket.”

WIHOGUE was incensed ‘at the move of the GOC in sending a parallel mission

to Burope and not informing hin of it. He saw WIZARD/2 and asked about

this other mission. wWIZARD/2 apparently informed WI4ARD/4 about

w1ZeRD/4 hea refused to ave or talk to WIXOGUE. 7

2. The GOC has also apjarently proposed sending HIXOGUS on an
intelligence gathering mission to Katanga. WIROGUe asked if KUBARK were
interested in this undertuking. We advised him strongly avainat thia
move and added we hid no interest whatsoever in the project.

3. HILOGUY has also net the ODOATH representative and shoved hin
the model subrarine which was the subject of ACLA-630. The ODCATH
representative evinced interest in this model’ and through the ODUNIT
representative, who WIROGUE has seen on several occasions and discuased
the probler of purchasing planes for tho GOS, the ODOATH representative
was aware that WIHOCGUS has an Ordre de Hisaion aigned bj WIZARD/2 to
travel to PAP.IMS. ‘He said for’ ¥I20GUR to inform him when he was ready
to depart and he would urrange for WIROGUE to contgot appropriate ODOaTE
people in P3PRIKE to discuss tho model.

4. WIROGUS approached GUTENAN on November 24 ‘and SALVACK on November
29 with a request whether he aight be of use to KUBARK oither in africa
or elsewhere in the worlds and that he would like to be taken: back into
the fold. He 1e obviously conce=ned about his position in the GOU at this
tine and feels with the diplouatic relations being established between
Belgium and the GOC that his position will become increasingly wecker. To
Yeenphasize past assessments of AIXCSUE, he ia far too disorganized an
individual to be an effective FI agent but would probably be useful where
action is required bet detailed accurate reporting is not. ‘The station
agrees with an early statement made concerning WIHOGUS that he has a
peculiar turn of mind which lends itself remarkably to nefarious and
extra-legal activities but would add that these activities should be of

an action type.
