Re: AMPHODARCH/Arthur G, VAIVADA -

CI Staff notes that training for VAIVADA ig scheduled to commence on
date in the same city as the training scheduled for! .
| This situation seons inherently
dangerous and unvarranted by the circtmstances ag known to CI Starr,
Pending further Justification CI Staff cannot’ ‘concur in the training ag
requested; but would of course concur in the training for VAIVADA if the.
locale vere ‘shifted to another city such as New York. .

(This is, basically an operational or an operational security mtter,
cr/ therefore urges thet CI/0"S/WH and CI/OA discuss the problem
with the deak, and resolve it if possible. CI/R&A/TRB vill of course
defer to CI/OPS AND CI/OA in this matter.)



Crfors/ ai does not concur with the CI/R:&-A recommendations as set forth for
the following reasons:

1, The security compromise would only stem from tke two BRAC officers
identifyirg the ValVaDa affiliation and trainirg on tetalf of this azency.
This arsears extremely renote as the desk advised there is no indication
that the FRAC officers know VAIVADs either ty nane or sight.

2, ‘while VAIVADA is being trained, his wife will be attending citizen
ship classes in D.C. preparing for her citizenship examination before
returning to:Cuba, Consequently, it would be a financial drain for 7alVaDA
to stay in New York City and his wife in D.c. In addition, certain. jer diem
costs would be incurred by the Case, Officer traveling to New York City to.
fonitor ‘sone of the OTR training,

3. The desk will instruct OTR of this joint training aspect and as °
a Freesutionary measure, request that training sites, hours, ete, do not
overlap, ?
