REPORT OF FINDINGS

(C) (LOCAL AGENCY) On 31 March 1967, a responsible official of the
Landesamt fuer Verfassungsschutz (State Office for the Protection of the
Constitution - LfV), Land North Rhine Westphalia (NRW), Duesseldorf (LB4577);
German Federal Republic (GFR), furnished the following information, regarding

Hans Dieter KAMINSKI, to James C. Gerhart, Land Liaison Officer, NRW:

In May 1966, KAMINSKI entered an office of the Bundesnachrichtendienst
(Federal Intelligence Service - BND), no further information (nfi), to offer .
HIS services as an intelligence agent. The subsequent LfV investigation
regarding SUBJECT revealed that in February 1964, HE had. immigrated to Canada.

In September 1964, HE contacted the Canadian Police and volunteered to work

as an intelligence agent, stating that HE had previously worked for the
Ministerium fuer Staatssicherheitsdienst (Ministry for State Security - MfS),
Soviet Zone of Occupied Germany, The Canadian authorities rejected HIS offer

of services. HE then allegedly contacted the Soviet Hmbassy, Ottawa, Canada, nfi.
In February 1965, HE was arrested as a vagrant and placed in a sanitarium, nfi,
until September 1965, No further details of SUBJECT'S activities in Canada

were disclosed in the course of LfV's investigation, No derogatory information
is on file with LfV regarding SUBJECT prior to HIS return to GFR. There was

no evidence that SUBJECT had ever engaged in any intelligence activities. The
LfV investigation concluded that SUBJECT should be regarded as being mentally
unbalanced, and therefore, unsuitable for any intelligence work,

AGENT'S NOTES: The above information was obtained unofficially from
Lf£V files and may not be released to SUBJECT or used in proceedings against
HIM without first having obtained HIS written permission to obtain this inform-
ation or having obtained official permission from the German courts to obtain
this information, Improper release of this information to HIM could result

in HIS instituting legal proceedings against the German Government for redress
and cause embarrassment to the US Army.
