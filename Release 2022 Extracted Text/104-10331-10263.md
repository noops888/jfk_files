Mr. Chairman, I am Steven D. Tilley, Chiefiof the Access and Freedom of Information Act Steff

of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). I wish to thank you for the

opportunity to testify today on behalf of NARA in support of H.R. 1553, which will extend the

September 30, 1998. I am appearing today In my cupusity zs NARA's Chief of tho Presidant John

F. Keanedy Assassination Records Collection. In that role I am charged with implementing
NARA‘s responsibilities under the Act and I serve as NARA's fiaison to the Assassination
Records Review Board (ARRB). This aftemoon I would like to tell you a little bit of my
background concerning records of the accacsinatian af President Kennedy, explain the role of
NAXA in impleménting the Act, and outline why the National Archives end Records
Administration supports passage of this important piece of legislation. -

Mr, Chairman, my career ae an archivist has involved working with some of the most sensitive

and highly classified records of our Govemment. | aversaw the closing of the office of the

Watergate Special Prosecution Force (WSPF) and supervised tho tranafer of theee records to the |

National Archives in 1977. 1 worked with the records of the WSPF for more than i! years,

serving for most of that tine as the senior archivist for those records. I also eerved ac the senior
archivist for the records of the National Security Council (NSC) following the transfer of the NSC
records of the Truman and Eisenhower Administrations in 1983. In 1989 I joined the staff of the
National Security Council, where I scrved as Director of Freedom of Information AcU/Privacy Act
Activities and later ax NSC’s Director of laformation Disclosure with responsibility for all
disclosure sctivitios of the NSC. In 1993, I retired to NARA to become the Chief of the JFK
Collection, and } have served in thet capacity ever since. I became the Chief of the Acucss wud

FOIA Staff in January of this year.

Under the JFK Act, NARA had several major responsibilities. Three of these requirements,
lmswever, proved to be central to the work of the Assassination Records Reviaw Roard. Our first
responsibility was to formally establish the President John F. Kennedy Assussination Records
Collection which we accomplished with the publication of an announcement in the Federal
Register on December 21, 1992. As established on that date, the Collection only consisted of
open records already in NARA‘s custody, primarily the records of the Warren Commission.
Sccondly, within 45 dayc of the etatute being signed, NARA was required to prepare and make
available standard identification forms for use by all government offices in describing assassination
records and to create « database of these forms to serve as an electronic finding aid to the JEK
Collection. Our third responsibility, which we shared with other government offices, was to
identify, review, and make available to the public ell aesassination recorde thet could be disclosed _
under the provisions of the law within s 300 day review periad Descriptions of all records
reviewed were required to be entered into the database where they would be mado widely

available to the public.

PS, (%)
At the end of the revicw poriod in August 1993, newly released records were made availahle for

research, including most of Lee Harvey Oswald's 201 Personality file, part of the Coutral

Intelligence Agency's “segregated collection” of assassination related documents, and the records

of the House Select Committee on Assassinations. The database was also available for use by

researchers on that day.

When the ARRB members were confirmed by the Senate in April, 1994, ary staff and I bogen to
work with the Board and later with the Board’s staff, to provide information on the records in
the Collection at that time, the development and use of the database, our contacts and discussions
with other agencies involved in searches for assassination related documents, and the existence of
assessination records in the custady of private repasitaries ar individuals, The ARRB and NARA
have maintained an excellent working relstionship Uwough the 3 years of the Board’s existence,
and I would like to think that this close relationship hus in some way contributed to the success of
the ARRB.

NARA enthusiastically supports passage of H.R. 1553 to extend the ARRB's authorization. Our
mission is not unlike that of the ARRB . to casure roady access to cssontial dooumentary
evidence. In the Boerd’s case the essential evidence is any records Telating to the assassination of
Presidept Kennedy. In our case escential evidence consists of all federal and presidential records
that documoat the rights of American citizens, the actions of federal officials, and the national
oxperieace. The Review Bostd needs the time designated in this bill to complete its important

work in making available as complete us historical recoed as possible concerning the

assassination of President Kennady. We would like to offer for your consideration some statistics

and facts to demonstrate the success of the Hoard and support its onc-year exteasion.

The John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection today bears little resemblance to the
Collection that was established in December 1992, At that timc, the Collection consisted of
approximately 450 oubia fact of records fram a few agencies. Today, the Collection has grown to
raore then 1,600 aubic feet of' records or 3.75 million pages from more than 30 different
government offices. Those numbers are a testament to the work of the Review Board in

obtaining the cooperation of the entire Federal government in this important task,

The ARRB bas not only succeeded in obtaining the cooperation of the Federal agencies but has
also negotiated the donation of very important recards that were previously held in private hands.
Donations have included the related papers of James Garrison and Edward Wegmann, the
prosecutor and defense attomey in the conspiracy trial of Clay Shaw, and the papers of J. Lee
Rankin, the General Counsel and Chiaf of Staff of the Warren Commission. Copies of the papers
of Senator Richard Russell, a member of the Warren Commission, that were donated to the
University of Georgia are being reviewed nud wa hope will be made part of the Collection ia the
near future with the agreement of the University. For the information of the Committes, Mr.
Chairman, I have attached to my testimony a copy of the Register of the Collection, which lists

the major groups of Federal recorde and private papers, along with the supplemental listing of FBI '

files.

Not only tus the Collection increased dramatically in sizc, the significance of the recorde in the
Collection cannot be overestimated. In addition to the recards of numerous Executive branch
agencies and offices, the records of relevant Congressional committees, related court cases, and
records donated by private entities arc available in the Collection. This rich documentation is
searchable electronically, giving researchers the ability to sock out documents concerning a topic, '
Porson, ui cycut, or even individual documents, not oaly at NARA‘c College Park facility, but
from their own personal computer through the Lmemot. Kqually important, the Collection
provides researchers with a view of how our goverament worked during this period in history, as
the documents reficct not only the operations of government as the offices and agencies reacted to
the death of the President but also how thase 6ffices and agencies were operating in regard to
other cvents that arc rclated to tho assassination, such as the campaign to destabilize the
government of Cuba or the FB1's mvestigation of various organized crime figures. Pethups Uds
unique window on the operations of these agencies may be the most important result of the

development of the Collection.

Furthermore, the Collection continues to grow. Additional FBI records will he added in the
weeks and months ahead. Kecords of the Departments of the Army and Nuvy and the Joint
Chiefs of Staff are currently under reviow. The addition of these records will only add to the

richness of the Collection and increase its value to the genoral research community.

Public demand for those records is the ultimate evidence of the the value of the Collection.

Recforence requests have risen in umber every year since the Culleutivu ypcued with new records

in August 1993. This year we have already received close to 600 written inquiries, an increase of”

30% over this time last year. The number of inquiries an aur computer website is also steadily
increasing. Since March, 1996 when the Collection was made available through tho NARA.
website, the assassination recarda have bean accessed over 100,000 times by the public. Many of
the written inquiries we reccive include copies of record identification forms taken from the
database, showing that the researcher has accessed our website and downloaded information. The
availability of the databace via the Intemet remaing one of the most important developments that

have come from this process.

Due to the exceptional work of the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Review Board, great
progress bas been made on making eveilable as complete a record as possible on the history of the
aceaccmation of John Kennedy. Without the focus, integrity, and exportice of the ARBB, the
Collection wuuld uot have the size, quality, or public demond witncesed today. However, there ic
still much to do. NARA supports passage of H.R. 1553 so that this important work can be

coraplected.
