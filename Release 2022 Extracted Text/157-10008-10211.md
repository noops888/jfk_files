on the local scene, and on his conduct with AMLASH shen they met. The

‘7 meeting lasted about one and a half hours.

Later the same day we called AMWHIP at his hotel to report
no progress in locating AMLASH. Feeling it advisable to keep AMMHIP
cccupied, we took him out to dinner at Fisketorpet, located in the
suburbs of Helsinki. The evening lasted until 1200, terminating witha

dranic at the roof bar of the. Yaakuna. During the six hours, we had an

opportunity to. lly to AMWHIP that in order for us to help

his friend, AMLASH must. be" willing to follow our directions’ and agree to

certain. condi. (albeady agreed upon by interested Hqs. parties).

AMWHIP realized: that this was necessary, and agreed with our ideas. However,

have only the briefest effect on the Soviet control of Cuba.)

ile we were making no

collection, etc., wera necessary prerequisites to ensure the value and success
