2022 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992

9 June 1973

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Possible Additional Agency Support Furnished Howard Hunt

1.. We have reported earlier an out-of-channel request by

Howard Hunt for a name trace in December 1971 on a Costa Rican.

This was put back in channels by forwarding the name trace report

to Peter Jessup, who then held the position of senior Agency officer

with the NSC Staff in EOB:

2. Jessup has submitted a memorandum dated 31 May 1973

(received in O/IG on 6 June) stating that Howard Hunt,

"submitted various names for Headquarters traces

of certain Latin Americans, not in a sealed envelope.

This was hadled orally and by telephone I advised the

chief of the appropriate division that they were being

forwarded and to consult with the DDP about the

propriety of responding. I also telephoned the DDP.

I then wrote my own memo to General HAIG calling

his attention to the fact that an individual--I named

HUNT--was tracing foreign nationals without reference

to the NSC Staff. "

Haig is reported by Jessup as returning the memorandum with the

word "thanks" noted on its face.

3. We have spoken with Rob Roy Ratliffe, Jessup's successor

with the NSC Staff, who states (in conversations on 6 and ? June)

that it was not customary for Jessup to keep records of this sort

of transaction, and that a search of the files does not disclose a

copy of the memorandum to General Haig. Mrs. Evelyn De Pue

(Jessup's secretary at the time and now Ratliffe's) spoke with Mrs.

Anne Wallace)at Headquarters, who reported a memorandum from

Chief, WH Division, in December 1971 forwarding to Jessup a

name trace on a Costa Rican (the one noted above) for Hunt. No

other such records were found.

4. Jessup is now on TDY at Headquarters and was interviewed

(7 June by telephone and 8 June in person). He first recalled that

"shortly after" Hunt was appointed to the White House--he thinks

before the plumber unit was formed, although this is ex post facto

reconstruction--Hunt made a request for name traces on Latin

Ame ricans.

He thinks this involved Guatemalans and Costa Ricans.

I pointed out that Hunt's White House appointment was 6 July 1971.

As Jessup discussed it he placed the time the last couple of months

of 1971 or the first month of 1972. He cannot recall how many name

traces were involved, but is certain that the total was more than

one--"just a few; five, three, two or four.". He enclosed Hunt's

request in an envelope and forwarded it with a note that someone

had best check with Tom Karamessines as Hunt was no longer an

Agency employee. Jessup says he didn't know what Hunt was doing

or what he had in mind, and was concerned that Hunt might make

Agency. Secret name trace material available to outsiders. : Jessup's

office routinely handled a low volume of name trace requests from the

NSC Staff, but always in such instances he knew who it was for and how

it was to be used.

5. Jessup said that his office had little other contact with Hunt.

He saw him in the elevator in EOB once or twice, but never had

occasion to discuss business matters. Once someone phoned asking

for Hunt's telephone extension (which was difficult to get, as the

White House switchboard did not give out numbers freely). Out of

curiosity he also got Hunt's room number and wandered down (he

recalls it as Room 106 EOB) where he found a sign on the door

saying "'Plumber, " very much as it might have said "Janitor." He

attached no significance to it at the time,' the term "Plumber" meaning

nothing to him.

6. On one occasion Jessup took his daughter to Blues Alley, and

saw Hunt there with some well-to-do Californians. He thought Hunt

had some association with the place as a public relations man, although

he thinks it would have to be a very small account. I told him of Hunt's

reported interest in jazz, which was news to Jessup. To forestall

Hunt's thinking that he (Jessup) might be playing around with teenagers

he took his daughter over to introduce her. His daughter felt that

Hunt was a man very pleased with himself. Jessup had no other

recollections.

7. Mr. Broe (then Chief, WH Division) has no recollection of any

name traces handled for Hunt other than the one forwarded over his

(Broe's) name on 13 December 1971. He recalls discussing that with

his deputy, Jim Flannery. He has discussed this with Flannery, who

has checked the records of WH and has found no other such records.

At this time it seems unlikely that we will answer the questions this

presents.

Was Hunt's out-of-channel request (which WH put back in

channel) the one Jessup recalls, with embellishments? Or did Hunt

make additional requests, through channels, that were not serviced?

We have the one recorded name trace, on a Costa Rican, and no others.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Executive Secretary, CIA Management Committee

SUBJECT

: Addendum to Chronologies on "Watergate"

1. On 8 December 1971 Mr. Howard Hunt requested a CIA employee

known to him personally, Miss Elizabeth McIntosh, to assist in a name

trace on a Costa Rican citizen, Jorge GONZALEZ Marten, who claimed

to be head of the Costa Rican National Independent Party. On 13 December

1971 the report was forwarded to Peter Jessup, Senior Staff Officer;

National Security Council, from the Chief, WH Division. Gonzalez was

reported to be a millionaire, with various holdings in Costa Rica, and an

unidentified connection with IBM. He had lived in the U.S. for a number

of years and seems to have formed his party in December 1971.

2. The genesis of the requested name trace is not known, and

subsequent use of the information is not known.
