MEMO FOR THE RECORD

1. At 0900 this morning I talked with Frank Friberg recently

returned COS Helsinki re Warren Commission inquiry concerning

the timetable of Oswald's stay in Finland in October 1959, including

his contact with the Soviet Consulate there. (Copy of the Commission

letter of 25 May 64 and State Cable of 22 May 64 attached.)

2. Friberg gave me the following information:

a. It takes 25 minutes to drive from the airport to

downtown Helsinki;

b. By taxi, it would take no more than 5 minutes to

reach the Soviet consulate;

c. The Soviet consulate probably closed at 1300 hours local

time on Saturdays in 1959;

d. Passenger lists (manifests) at the U.S. Consulate in

Helsinki are retained for six months only and then are destroyed.

Mr. Robert Fulton (CIA)

there at

the time.

e. A copy of State's cable inquiry would go to the Helsinki

Station and they would assist in preparation of a reply.

3. MI. Friberg agreed that it would be worthwhile to cable the

Station concerning points not covered by State in their inquiry. He

suggested changes incorporated into the cable sent to Helsinki.
