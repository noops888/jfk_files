The following represents the writer's ‘recollection
of testimony given this date before the Senate Select Committee
(SSC) pursuant to subpoena. The session commenced at 10 a.m.
5/21/75 in Room 607, Caroll Arms Hotel. . Present was Senator
Robert Morgan (North Carolina); Lester B, Seidel, Staff Member;
Mr. Jack Smith, Staff Member; Mr. John Bailey, Assistant
Minority Counsel, and a male reporter. Senator Morgan placed
the writer under oath. Approximately four or five minutes later
‘Senator Morgan excused himself with a general statement to
the effect he had other pressing matters. The entire proceedings
with only two exceptions were conducted by Lester B, Seidel.

| ak maa Seidel explained the writer was entitled to counsel,

= had the privilege of invoking provisions of the Fifth Amendment,
i
& and would have the privilege of making an opening and closing

o statement. Seidel inquired whether the writer understood his
—

to constitute a grand jury and in the absence of any charges
or allegations of a violation of law on his part, he did not
insist on the presence of counsel.

Seidel was advised as a former Special Agent the
writer had contacted the Bureau's Legal Counsel Division and
as of this date had been advised by Mr, Paul Daly thereof that
he had been cleared by the Attorney General (AG) to testify
to matters relating to investigation of Martin luther King, Jr.,
Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), and Stanley
Levison. .

“Seidel was advised that during his interview of the
writer in Atlanta, Georgia, on 5/12/75 he had asked a question
as to how long after the assassination of King did the telephone
surveillance continue on the King residence. On 5/12/75 the

weiter responded it was his recollection this-coverage continued
until a short time subsequent to the assassination. Following
that interview, the writer recalled that either shortly before
or shortly after that case was assigned to the writer, the King
family had moved from one residence to another and that
continuation of the telephone surveillance from the former
residence to the latter one was not authorized. Secondly,

Seidel on 5/12/75 had asked when the King and SCLC cases were

NW 65360 Docld:32989606 Page 3


assigned to the writer, the writer recalled such assignment
was in the early part of 1965; that it was now the writer's
recollection this assignment was made in May, 1965.

wSet forth below are questions asked by Seidel (unless
otherwise indicated) and the writer's answers. These questions
and answers are not set forth chronologically.

during the period of time with which we are concerned. Ore WEM Ze

Of attacked poogen

“a, Did a former Bureau official William Sullivan visit Atlanta
during this period?

“A. There were two Sullivans in an official eapacity with the
Bureau.

"a. Supposing an Agent wanted some item from either location

to use against King or SCLC. Would he not have made a surreptitious

entry to obtain it?

this very firmly because the Bureau policy before the late

had changed? i

2

“AL During my period with the Bureau,from the beginning such

thereto.

SCLC? .
ta, To determine possible communist influence of King and SCLC.

ha, If, as you state, you did not develop information that King

-waS a communist, was not this investigation in vain?

“A. Not in my opinion. It is correct it did not establish that

King was a CP member. It did establish that he was in contact

with individuals then having past or present CP affiliation which

was the objective of the investigation, S<t /7&M HE of HR, 7

dense as to the utilization of this phrase COINIELPRO. If it

time he advised that under no circumstances would he testify
in public to the information which he originally furnished to
the FBI on a confidential basis. He further advised that
under no circumstances would he reveal the identity of his

NOTE:

Concurrence to pass the 2/26/70 letter, with Secret
enclosures, from Richard Helms, then Director of CIA, to J. Edgar
Hoover, then Director of FBI, was obtained by Liaison Officer
Leon F. Schwartz from Walter Elder, CIA on 6/10/75. The response
to requests set forth in Appendix C, Part I, Item numbers 7 and

duplication since the severing of liaison with CIA grew out of

THOMAS RIHA yee a
eee traci é

On the late afternoon of February 10, 1870, I was
called by MIKE oronorayi ce who is in charge of the CIA office
ner iin peters at structions, _fro:

jharital matter and
{TODOROVICH “thén “tol

i dutold TODOROVICH -_ give
“tAgent and he statéa7he “ do.
F :

“I very” ‘emphatically told TODOROVICH that ‘until he gave me
ve’ name of the Agent who supposedly gave him and FRITZ this in-,
formation, that I would not believe that either he or FRITZ had
‘|}been given any information such as this by any Agent of this
}Bureau and this was based on the fact that no Agent would have
z any reason whatsoever to make such a statement sinee we had
not conducted any investigation in this matter nor did we
have any information concerning RIHA and, therefore, we would
not be in a position to make such a statement as to whether or
not RIHA was all right. - y eeeeee . : _:Sssaaee

I then also pointed out to Mr. TODOROVICH that if he
. fgave the information to Mr, MC KEVITT and advised Mr KEVITT
the information had come from an FBI Agent and if Mr. MC KEVITT
contacted me I would certainly advise him that thé information ;
did: et come from anyone in the PBI. for the same peasons as
‘Iset“forth above. |

Iam enclosing, for the Bureau's information, an
article which appeared in the February 11, 1970, issue of The
Rocky Mountain News, a Denver newspaper. ‘The article is
captioned Bolder housewife Sure she talked to Rina. "

Towards the end of the article it reports that

MC KEVITT had received an official denial from "a Washington source"
¢that any of the official agencies which have been named in
connection with the RIHA case actually had any knowledge of
where RIHA is now. , The source, according to the article which

MC KEVITT refused to identify, also said RIHA was not involved

in espionage of any sort and that none of these agencies

ave ever told anyone in Boulder, Denver, or elsewhere that

RIHA was alive and well.

The article points out the most frequently mentioned
agencies have been the FBI, CIA, Military Intelligence agencies
and the U. S. INS. - 7

Also enclosed is an article which appeared in the
Rocky Mountain News for February 12, 1970. This article is

captioned "Riha case investigators' theories might be altered."

For the information of the Bureau, we only hve two
resident agents in Boulder, Colorado, and I have personally
contacted each of them and each has assured me both verbally

aid by memvcaudun het they have nol made Such statements
as were attributed to them by TODOROVICH. Not only that,
neither of the two has ever had any contact personally or
otherwise with JOHN D. FRITZ, the CIA representative in Boulder.

. This information is being forwarded to the Bureau only
ee information in view of CIA's actions in connection with

this matter.

This information regarding the disappearance of oné Omas_Riha was
in turn passed to Dr. Joseph Smiley, then President of Co
University, Boulder, Colorado, now President of a university in El

Mr. Todorovich to report to me in person. tee.

i,

Ihave reviewed this complicated case in detail with Mr. Todorovich
oy. and have requested him to reveal the identity of his source. As a point
om of honor and personal integrity, Mr. Todorovich was adamant that he

7 could not disclose the identity of his source. Under further pressure
from me, Mr. Todorovich maintained his position, stating that in de-
fense of it he was prepared to submit his resignation immediately.

~

: Mr. Todorovich éxplained that the Riha/Galya Tannenbaum cases
had been given extensive news coverage, much of it being sensational
in nature. He stressed that there was embarrassing public speculation
as to the possible involvement of the CIA and the FBI in Riha's

While the following is not pertinent to your request, my review
of this case suggests the advisability of a re-examination of Riha's
disappearance and past activities and, necessarily, the Tannenbaum
case. Briefly, since 1958 we have communicated to your Bureau
significant information which relates to Riha's involvement with
Czech and Soviet intelligence services, when he was behind the Iron
Curtain, lattach for your information and convenience copies of
pertinent reports regarding this aspect of the case,

Ihope sincerely that this recent incident will not impair our
mutual efforts in making certain that we have not overlooked factors
possibly having a significant bearing on U.S. intelligence and internal
security interests, I shall pursue this matter through our respective
liaison offices,

cl closing, M: _Hoover, 1 I wish . to si state that this Agency can only,
fully, perform its a ties in the furtherance “of the national security when

it has the closest coordination and teamwork with the Federal Bureau Of
Investigation. Furthermore, it is necessary that we continue to con-
duct our business in an ‘atmosphere of mutual ‘Tespect, I trust that we
can coordinate’ closely any future developments or actions in these cases,
in order to prevent the airing in public of conflicts or differences between
the two agencies. I feel strongly that there are representatives of the
news media who are eager to exploit alleged differences on a national
scale, Disturbing as this experience has been, I wish to thank you in
the interests of our common cause for having communicated with me

in such a forthright and candid manner,

this Agency,

2. In 1958 and 1959 you were provided information
that RIHA, when transitting Prague en route to Moscow, '
was contacted by Czech Intelligence and asked to remain in
the CSR. Later in 1958 Czech Intelligence introduced RIHA
to the KGB in Moscow and our source reported RIHA accepted
certain privileges from the KGB while asserting he would not
become a spy for the Soviets. Details reported by our source
about RIHA's KGB contacts did not emerge during a 1960 FBI
interview of RIHA,

°
1. The following report concerning an attempt by a

member of Czech Intelligence to effect the repatriation of

Subject, a naturalized American East-West Exchange student, .

to his country of origin was recently submitted by a source Peecoeauee

of this office. ee

2. Source first became acquainted with Subject during: arin
the past year at The Russian Research Center, Harvard University.
On 10 September 1958 he ran into Subject by chance at the SAS
office in Vienna as the two boarded a SAS flight to Copenhagen
via Duesseldorf. During the trip Subject disclosed the
following to source which has been supplemented from
‘a information from our files.

i 3. RIHA, who was born in Prague, Uzechosiovakia

: 17 April 1929, is one of the twenty American students
selected for the East-West Exchange Program and will be
studying in the USSR for the 1958-59 academic year. Files

in this Agency indicate that RIHA arrived in the U. ot on
‘15 July 1947 and became a citizen in 1952.

7 June of this year, to see his father and other” relatives. His

2) RIHA told our source that when he arrived in Prague
he was put into a Government hotel for three days before he
was allowed to stay with his relatives and friends. During
this time, and perhaps later, RIHA was accompanied through
the city by a guide whom he described as a "Government
Official" name unknown, who attempted to effect Subject's
repatriation to Czechoslovakia. RIHA told our source that
this man has set up an appointment (date and address unknown)
. to meet him in Moscow to talk further. :

6. Subject told our source that this "Government
| Official" did not mention Czech Intelligence or Security
' Forces as such and that he (RIHA) is not too worried
concerning this contact. RIHA apparently feels that it
is the price he must pay in order to study in the Soviet
ee Union and once he gets deeply into his studies in Moscow
“v-~he feels that he can plead that he is too busy with his
academic work to have contact with any officials. Our
source also stated that RIHA is in some kind of correspondence
with the Czech official. We have no description or name for
the Czech official.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director
Federal Bureau of Investigation

SUBJECT : RIHA, Thomas

°

1. Reference is made to our CS CI 3/751,690 of
27 October 1958 concerning an attempt by a member of Czech
Intelligence to effect Subject's repatriation while the
latter was in Prague in June of 1958 visiting relatives
en route to study in Moscow during 1958-59 as an East-West
Exchange Student. The following report describes further
action taken by the KGB in Moscow to cultivate Subject, and
was recently submitted by a sensitive and reliable source.

2. Sometime in December 1958, Subject again met the
Czech Gflicial wlio had tried to have Subject repatcidate to
the CSR in Prague last summer. According to our source, it
was apparently an accidental meeting at a Moscow railroad
station as the Czech was returning to Prague. The Czech was
delighted to see Subject, and introduced him to a Soviet
official. This Soviet identified himself only by a first
name and a telephone number, both unknown to our source,

The Soviet described his work as being in the American
Section of the MVD.

3. This Soviet Official has been cultivating Subject
(trying to see him as often as possible, sometimes twice a
week) since their introduction in December, by offering such
blandishments as trips in a chauffered private limousine
into forbidden areas outside Moscow, tickets to any enter-
tainment, access to material from previously inaccessible
archives, the use of private country villas and all the
"beautiful, interesting and intelligent girls" he might want.
Subject has further ‘been promised the opportunity of returning
to the Soviet Union for as long as he wants at any future
date. He would have to pay only his way over there; his
expenses and return trip to the US would be paid by the
Soviets.

4. Subject has taken: advantage of this offer to take
several trips for sightseeing into forbidden areas around
Moscow in a private car with the Soviet Official, and has
also taken up a few offers for entertainment. Subject visited
one of these villas, but refused the girls on the ground that
he wants a woman to like him for himself, and not because she
has been told to do so. The Soviet answered that "some of
them will really learn to like you for yourself, as well as
work for us," but Subject still declined to get involved.
However, Subject has recently been taken up by a Soviet girl
who had previously tried to seduce another American student
and subsequently blurted out that she was put onto the latter
American by the MVD, which she has also told Subject. Subject
is reported to be responding warmly to her approaches although
he has flatly told her he doesn't trust her nor any Russian
completely. He claims he enjoys her company but will not
have a serious affair with her, and suspects she may be tied
up with the other women offered him by the Soviet Official.

5. In his relaiionsnip with the Suvicet Officiaz, Subject
is reportedly aware that he is playing a risky game, and is
only utilizing the situation for the comfort and convenience
it brings him. He has told the Soviet frankly that he cannot
be wom over ideologically. Subject says he feels that the
Soviets' interest in him is to cultivate him as a scholar of
possible future importance to insure that he will always be
sympathetic to the Soviet Union. Subject has reportedly told
“several other American students of his relationship with the
Soviet Official in order to cover himself "in case anything
happened".

6. This Soviet Official has evinced an interest to
Subject in many of the American Exchange students, with the
explanation that some would undoubtedly be back in Moscow
within two years as Diplomats and that since this is his
area of responsibility, he wants to know as much as possible
about them. The Soviet indicated that he was quite aware of
the pattern of the American Exchange students' trips to the
US Embassy and what they de in the university buildings, but
is not so sure of their activities around the city. To
demonstrate to Subject his knowledge about the American
students, the Soviet Official mentioned an affair going on
within the American group of which Subject had been unaware.
The Soviet's information turned out to be true.

_NW 65360 Docld:32989606 Page 69 af



7. Subject was described by a reliable source, who
knows him from group social gatherings at Harvard, as mature
and socially vivacious with a warm personality. Subject is
a clever and humorous conversationalist who likes to be
surrounded by people, make new acquaintances, and develop
friendships. Subject's patriotic motivation was not known
to our source, but the latter felt that Subject was completely
"Americanized" in manners and interests. Our source would
guess that Subject has courage.

8. It is requested that no further dissemination be
made of this information without prior clearance from this
office. It is further requested that such clearance be

obtained if Subject is to be contacted by you either before
or after his return to the United States.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director, Subject to Criminal Sanctions

SUBJECT: RIHA, Thomas :

1. Reference is made to our CSCI 3/751,690 of 27 October
1958, and our CSCI 3/754,303 of 14 April 1959 in which are re-
ported the attempt by Czech Intelligence to induce Subject, a
Czech-born naturalized American, to repatriate to Czechoslovakia,
and the further cultivation of Subject by the KGB in Moscow
where Subject is an Exchange Student during 1958-59. The
following report describes further action by the KGB to recruit
Subject, and his adamant refusal of any such offer. This latest
information was recentiy received from RIHA by a sensitive
and reliable source. Fa e

2. During April 1959, the Soviet Ofticiar-who-said-iie~-~
was from the American Section of the MVD (sic) and who had been
cultivating Subject, allegedly asked the-lattér to make complete
and regular reports on Michael Martin*LUTHER,“one of the other
American Exchange Students at Moscow‘University. Subject was
asked to spend as much time as possible with LUTHER, and to
report where he goes, what he does and with whom he associates.
If Subject were to do this reporting, the Soviet Official

said he would make available certain material from Archives
which Subject has been unable to get permission to use although
research in this material is vital to his having a successful
year academically in Moscow.

3. Subject alleges he flatly refused this "deal", saying
that if he ever got mixed up in such a dirty business, it would
be for his own side and not for the Communists. The Soviet
Official then told Subject he should engage in such observation
and reporting to the Soviets to lose some 'naivete" about how
the United States is exploiting the Cultural Exchange Program
for intelligence purposes. To back up this assertion, the
Soviet Official told Subjoct about a “spy nest where spies deposit,
things for one another" which he said had recently been uncovered
near a universityentrance frequented by still another American
student, Walter-iC NS, who, the Soviet implied, was not engaged
in academic work only while studying at Moscow University.

#



Subject reportedly again adamantly refused to cooperate with
the Soviet Official. ae

; 4, In paragraph 4 of CSCI 3/754,303, reference!was.made - .
‘to a Soviet girl who had become interested in Subject, and whom
Subject viewed with suspicion although continuing to see her

for her companionship. Her name is Lida (Y JROVA. Subject

has now reportedly been alienated by~her-ufidependable personality
and has pretty well broken up with her. This girl may have

left, or soon be leaving, for Prague to join her husband.

”

5. It is requested that no further dissemination of this
information be made without prior clearance from this office.
It is further requested that such clearance be obtained if
Subject is to be contacted by you.

a Heat

At 4:35 p.m., today I telephonically contacted ASAC
Morley, Denver, and advised him that an article concerning the
Riha case had appeared in the Sunday News (New York) 4-3~70.
This article was a general rehashing of the Riha case.

I told him that the Bureau desired that SAC Werner
contact the District Attorney to determine the developments ae
of his investigation in this case and also determine what | 7
conclusions had been reached. Morley said this would be done. {dt

Morley was asked if Detiver: had information concerning
a professor who had gone to El Paso, Texas, or New Orleans,
Louisiana, and he advised this probably referred to
Dr. Joseph Smiley, former President at Colorado University
who was there when Riha disappeared. He said that Smiley
is now President of the University of Texas, at El Paso, Texas.
He said Denver had no information that Dr. Smiley has any
current information concerning this matter.

. SAC Werner called at 5:30 p.m., today to advise-
that he had been unable to get in touch with the District
Attorney but also was following up on this and would contact
the District Attorney today and get in a teletype tonight.

bribe investigation at standstill, all leads being exhausted. He

4 After leaving Boulder, SNILEY was advised by

| Dean WILLIAM HE, BRIGGS, College of Arts and Sciences,

‘University of Colorado, Boulder, that a letter was
received by the University purportedly written by RIJA

- din which he stated that he would not be returning to

~~... the University, BRIGGS advised S:ILEY that in his

“~ opinion, the letter was a forgery, since the signature

did not compare with that of RIJA,

°

-After the disappearance, SMILEY began, receiving
a great many inquiries from the news media and he was
pressed for a statement regarding his knowledge of RIJA
and whether or not he was alive.

: -. TRE FOLLOWING WAS FURNISHED BY DR, SMILEY
IN THE STRICTEST OF CONFIDENCE WITH THE UNDERSTANDING
THAT IT WAS FOR THE INFORMATION OF THE FBI AND NOT
FOR DISSEMINATION TO ANY CUTSIDZ AGENCY SINCE HE WAS
BREAKING A CONFIDENCE WITH AN ASSOCIATE IN THE DENVER
OFFICE OF THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY:

Being hounded by the press for a statement,
.he contacted a source in the CIA Office at Denver since
he, SMILEY, was formerly a member of the Office of Naval
Intelligence, thinking that perhaps that agency could
asSist hin off the record with any information it might
-;+- possess, SMILEY was aware that the CIA had interviewed
: ‘' .RIJA following a trip by RIJA to the Soviet Union, The
“ CIA source subsequently told Dr, SMILEY to merely advise -
dl the press that he had information to the effect that
atten RIJA was “alive and well”. This information was subsequently
released by Dr, SMILEY to the student press at the University
of Colorado, and it appeared in print.

: When the Office of: the District Attorney in
Denver instituted investigation into the disappearance

of RIJA, SMILEY was contacted by the DA's Office regarding
the source of his statement, Dr. SMILEY again contacted
the Denver CIA Office source and was advised that he

was to state nothing and that he would be phecchdchan ted,

Sone days later, the CIA sovrce recontacted
him and told hin that he would be receiving an inquiry -
{from .the Office of the DA in the form of a statement,
and that he should agreé With "the statement even thouga
4t “was not quite the truth", SMILEY did not question

inti stenereanantSsS esse seienntgseneusianaetl
NW 65360 Docid:32989606 Page 34 HEHE



these instructions, since he felt that CIA knew what
Should be done ia this type of case. He received a
» telephone call from the DA's Office and a statement
was read to him to the effect that the information
. which he had received and made public to the effect
i. that RIJA was alive and well was in error, SHILEY
‘|. told the caller that he agreed with the statement and
nothing further came of this.

SHEE Dr, SMILEY does not know what part, if any,
“~~~-the CIA has in’ this case, but since ho, SMILEY, is
himself a former intelligence agent he did not feel
that he had the right to question something which
night be of vital importance to his country. —

DR. SHILEY REQUESTED THAT NO HINT’ OR
“INFERENCE BE GIVEN TO THE CIA WHICH WOULD INDICATE
‘THAT HE HAS REVEALED TO THE FBI HIS CONTACTS REGARDING
THIS HATTER WITH THE DENVER OFFICE OF THE CiA.

He stated that though he has no evidence to
substantiate his belief, he cannot get it out of his
mind that RIJA may have been a double agent for the
Buvivts or the Czceheslavak He is aware that ono
Hrs, TANNENBAUM, a wonan indicted for a number of frauds
and a suspect in two arsenic poisonings, is considered

Eases a suspect in the disappearance of RIJA, He never knew
RIJA to be associated with any such woman, but stated
that he was not acquainted with the personal life of
RIJA who was sonewhat of a "loner",

. RIJA, when he joined the staff of the University
of Colorado, was single but in 8/68, an individual came
to visit RIJA ostensibly for the purpose of arranging
a marriage between RIJA and the man's sister. The
intended bride was a Czechoslovakian girl who was born in
Prague, Czechoslovakia, and this "brother-in-law" was
- entertained by a member and colleague of RIJA in the
History Departnent. This individual indicated to SMILEY
that although the “brother-in-law” supposedly did rot
speak any English, and had RIJA translate every statement
into Czech, it was apparent from the gestures anc expressicns
of the "brother-in-law" that he understood more than he
: let on. Three weeks after the visit of this wan, the woran
a who became Mrs, RIJA cane to Boulder, Colorado, where ste
and RIJA were married, The marriage resulted in divorce -
a@ short tice later and the girl reportedly returned to
“the East Coast from whence she.came. .... Sabuanyanusenent

: ‘Dr. SUILEY indicated that he has no further
information regarding this matter, but that Dean WILLIAM E,
BRIGGS, College of Arts and Sciences, University of
Colorado, Boulder, should be in possession of the letter

‘purportedly written from.Canada by RIJA, and may be in
& position to assist in answering any question the Bureau
might have regarding RIJA's association with the University
of Colorado, since BRIGGS would have possession of these
records. He stated BRIGGS is a trusted confidant of his
and Dr. SMILEY's name should be used as an introduction
should the Bureau desire any information of BRIGGS.

Attached is a proposed memorandum to the Attorney
General with a letterhead memorandum attached enclosing a copy °
of a memorandum J. H. Gale to Mr. Tolson dated July 30, 1964, .
captioned Investigation of Ku “Kiux Klan and other Hate Groups. en Ace
It appears that we are proposing to give the copy of the Gale AY
memorandum to the Senate Select Committee in response to their (he
request by letter dated May 14, 1975, for a memorandum prepare we Jey"
Gale relative to the subject matter of the 1964 memorandum.

Ye \
My reading of the memorandum revealed that it is a purely py :

A
deliberative document which quotes personal views of Mr. Sullivan, © c
ir. Rosen, Mr. mont, and Mr. Gale. Iam concerned that the Ta
release of such 2 memorandum containing not only the personal views of

Bureau officials, but also identifying them by name could have an impact

on individuals in the future who may be asked to furnish their opinions
concerning policy matters in the FBI. As indicated by the Attorney General
in his speech in New York, it is essential that the Executive Branch have a
degree of privacy concerning policy discussions and expressions of
personal views by officials in order for the Executive to function properly.

I do recognize that we may not be able to resist giving the
Committee access to material documents that bear on particular issues
under investigation, however, I do reconmmend that when we are required
to produce deliberative documents, the names and other identifying data
relating ps furnishing views be deleted.

Former Special Agent Richard H. Davis of the piecter see
Atlanta Office telephonically contacted SA Paul V. Daly of this a
Division on 6-4-75 at which time he explained that he had been
contacted. by Michael Epstein of captioned Committee at which time
Epstein requested that Davis make himself available for interview in
either Atlanta, Georgia, or travel to Washington, D. C. Davis informed
Epstein that he would have to obtain Bureau approval prior to submitting
to interview inasmuch as he had to obtain a release from his employment

=
Face,

secrecy agreement. } Va
Mr. Davis informed SA Daly that he was reluctant. yy

to agree to being interviewed by captioned Committee concerning his

activities as an Agent. It was pointed out to Mr. Davis that. the

decision as to whether to agree to interview was his, but he was

advised that captioned Committee has subpoena power and might attempt

to force him to furnish information through the use of a, subpoena.

He was informed that the Bureau was cooperating with=captioned Committee

and their inquiry into FBI operations.

It was explained to Mr. Davis that if he desired to
allow himself to be interviewed, the Bureau would make available
an employee at his request to be available but not present during
interview. He was also advised that this Agent would not represent
him as private counsel. Mr. Davis was advised that the Bureau's
concern was not of matters of historical fact but rather testimony
might be required which could impair the Bureau's efforts to discharge
its responsibilities. It was. also explained that the Bureau representative
would assist him in making determination whether his response to a
particular question would ifldentify confidential informants, impair on-
going investigations, divulge information derived from other Government
agencies or foreign sources or expose sensitive investigative technique;
and, therefore, a response should not be given. mM

Re: SENSTUDY 75

Mr. Davis indicated that he desired a Bureau

the interview take place in Atlanta, Georgia. Additionally, he stated
Epstein had indicated that the topic of discussion in the interview
would be the Bureau's investigation of Martin Luther King, Stanley
David Levison, and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.

Mr. Davis stated he would recontact FBI Headquarters as soon as

a date and place of interview had been determined. He indicated he
would set the date for interview so that the Bureau would have ample
opportunity-to.have an Agent available. We have separately requested
Bureau Govrova} for the release of Davis from his employment agreement

ACTION: (ertee Hideo

y Reference is made to Bureau letter to The Attorne wee

General 6/20/75 captioned "United States Senate Select
Committee on Intelligence Activities (SSC)," forwarding
letterhead memorandum for approval and forwarding to SSC.

The Director asked if we have any amplification of a
this instruction (to submit items with unusual twist or
concerning prominent personalities for dissemination to the
President under the INLET Program) or do we know of any
submission responsive to this which illustrates interpretation?

There has been no amplification of this instruction,
nor any submission under INLET of an item on prominent
personalities that would show the interpretation of this
point,

With respect to the observation that this matter
should cause a congressional furor, it is noted that INLET
has already been afforded considerable publicity, beginning
in February, 1973, after an office memorandum on the subject
reached the news media, This publicity is why the Senate
Committee asked for documents on INLET, The White House and
Senator Bob Packwood inquired about the Program, A detailed
defense of INLET appeared in the Congressional Record,

By way of background, the INLET instruction that has
received the most publicity--items with an unusual twist or
concerning prominent personalities-~-was recalled by the author \
of the INLET Program initiating letter as having been :
specifically dictated by then Assistant Director W. C. Sullivan.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: SENSTUDY

While we cannot say exactly what former Assistant
Director W. C. Sullivan had in mind when he added the
instruction about items with an unusual twist, we can
speculate with a hypothetical example.

If we learned that a trusted assistant to an
important government official--an official who had taken
a “hard line" with respect to dealings with the Soviet Union,
for example--was under development by Soviet intelligence,
this would be an unusual twist to an item of intelligence
interest to the President involving a prominent person,

In such a hypothetical case, we would, of course,
advise the government official involved, and The Attorney
General and the President. We would have done this under
INLET and we would still disseminate this type of data.
INLET was only a vehicle for special dissemination.

Director Sec’y

John Elliff of captioned Committee's task force on
Domestic Intelligencé Activities advised on 6-9-75, that the
Committee is pkanning to have a Bureat representative testify f
concerning the FBI's authority to conduct investigations in the ,
domestic and counterintelligence areas in late June or éarly ~
July. Mr. E1liff stated that this testimony would be before the ”
Senators and will be a general exploration of jurisdictional
authority. Mr. E1liff also volunteered that he had told K. William
O'Connor, Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination of.the .
Department, that the Committee wanted to be furnished a copy of:
the T. J. Smith Memorandum dated 7-31-72 concerning FBI's investi-
gative jurisdiction in domestic and cotifiterintelligence matters.
Elliff£ stated that at this point, a summary of such documents ~
would not be an acceptable subst4tute. E1liff desired such a
document be made available to the Committee prior to the afore-
mentioned testimony. With regards to testimony, EL1if£f£ indicated
that it would not necessarily have to be the Director giving a

testimony. ‘

EL1if£ stated as he finalizes his plans concerning
the testimony concerning FBI investigative jurisdiction, he
would recontact SA Paul V. Daly of this Division and give more
details concerning this matter.

BLACK PANTHER PARTY

I. FOUNDING

The Black Panther Party, with head-
quarters in Oakland, California, was
founded in 1966 by two Oakland Negroes
— Huey Percy Newton and Bobby George
Seale — both at that time at Merritt Col-
lege in Oakland. The name and symbol
of the new party were taken from the
Lowndes County Freedom Organization,
an Alabama political party known infor-
mally in 1965 as the Black Panther Party.

From the writings of communists,
revolutionaries, and black militants,
Newton and Seale allegedly selected
ideas around which they could build a
revolutionary frame that suited the needs
of their party. Influential writings in-
cluded those of Mao Tse-tung, Chinese Communist
leader; Frantz Fanon, West Indian psychiatrist who
advocated violence for Algerian nationalists;
Emesto ‘‘Che’’ Guevara, one-time lieutenant of
Cuba’s Fidel Castro and a principal architect of 20th
century guerrilla warfare; Malcolm X, American black
nationalist who advocated violence to obtain Negro
‘freedom’; and W. E. B. DuBois, Negro educator who
became a member of the Communist Party, USA, at
the age of 93.

The organization was at first called the Black
Panther Party for Self-Defense; however, the ‘Self-
Defense’? was removed in 1968 in an effort to project
a more politically oriented image to prospective
sympathizers and supporters.

As head of the new Black Panther Party, Newton assumed the title Minister of
Defense, and Seale was named Chairman. When questioned about the membership
of their organization, Newton and Seale gave the since oft-repeated reply: ‘Those
who know don’t say. Those who say don’t know.” The militancy of the group,
however, had an immediate appeal to the discontented, restless youth of Oakland’s
ghettos.

Il. BLACK PANTHER OBJECTIVES

The Black Panther Party ‘Platform and Program’ is repeated in each issue of
the official Party publication, The Black Panther.

October 1966

Black Panther Party
Platform and Program

What We Want
What We Believe

1, We want freedom. We want power to determine the destiny of our
Black Community.

We believe that black people will not be free until we are able to deter-
mine our destiny.

2. We want full employment for our people.

We believe that the federal government is responsible and obligated to
give every man employment or a guaranteed income. We believe that if
the white American businessmen will not give full employment. then the
means of production should be taken from the businessmen and placed in
the community so that the people of the community can organize and em-
ploy all of its people and give a high standard of living.

IW 65360 Docld:32989606 Page 126 _



3. We want an end to the robbery by the CAPITALIST of our Black
Community.

We believe that this racist government has robbed us and now we are
demanding the overdue debt of forty acres and. two mules. Forty acres
and two mules was promised 100 years ago as restitution for slave labor
and mass murder of black people. We will accept the payment in currency
which will be distributed to our many communities. The Germans are now
aiding the Jews in Israe) for the genocide of the Jewish people. The Ger-
mans murdered six million Jews. The American racist has taken part in
the slaughter of over fifty million black people; therefore, we feel that this
is a modest demand that we make.

4. We want decent housing, fit for shelter of human beings.

We believe that if the white landlords will not give decent housing to
our black community. then the housing and the land should be made into
cooperatives so that our community, with government aid, can build and
make decent housing for its people.

5. We want education for our people that exposes the true nature of this
decadent American society. We want education that teaches us our true
history and our role in the present-day society.

We believe in an educational system that will give to our people a knowl-
edge of self. If a man does not have knowledge of himself and his position
in society and the world, then he has little chance to relate to anything
else.

6. We want all black men to be exempt from military service.

We believe that Black people, should not be forced to fight in the mili-
tary service to defend a racist government that does not protect us. We
will not fight and kill other people of color in the world who, like black
people, are being victimized by the white racist government of America.
We will protect ourselves from the force and violence of the racist police
and the racist military, by whatever means necessary.

7. We want an immediate end to POLICE BRUTALITY and MURDER
of black people.

We believe we can end police brutality in our black community by or-
ganizing black self-defense groups that dre dedicated to defending our
black community from racist police oppression and brutality. The Second
Amendment to the Constitution of the United States gives a right to bear
arms. We thetefore believe that all black people should arm themselves
for self-defense.

8. We want freedom for all black men held in federal, state, county
and city prisons and jails.

We believe that all black people should be released from the many
jails and prisons because they have not received a fair and impartial trial.

NW 65360 Docld:32989606 Page 127


9. We want all black people when brought to trial to be tried in court by
a jury of their peer group or people from their black communities, as
defined by the Constitution of the United States.

We believe that the courts should follow the United States Constitution
so that black people will receive fair trials. The 14th Amendment of the
US. Constitution gives a man a right to be tried by his peer group. A peer
is a person from a similar economic, social, religious, geographical, en-
vironmental, historical and racial background. To do this the court will be
forced to select a jury from thé black community from which the black
defendant came. We have been, and are being tried by all-white juries
that have no understanding of the “average reasoning rian” of the black
community.

10. We want land, bread, housing, education, clothing, justice and peace,
And as our major political objective, a United Nations-supervised plebis-
cite to be held throughout the black colony in which only black colonial
subjects will be allowed to participate, for the purpose of determining the
will of black people as to their national destiny.

When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one
people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with
another, and to assume, among the powers of the earth, the separate and
equal station to which the laws of nature and nature’s God entitle them, a
decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare
the causes which impel them to the separation.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, thatall men are created equal;
that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights;
that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That, to
secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their
just powers from the consent of the governed; that, whenever any form of
government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people
to alter or to abolish it, and to institute a new government, laying its
foundation on such principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as
to them shall scem most likely to effect their safety and happiness. Pru-
dence. indeed. will dictate that governments long established should not
be changed for light and transient causes; and, accordingly, all experience
hath shown, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are
sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they
are accustomed. But, when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pur-
suing invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce them under ab-
solute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such govern-
ment, and to provide new guards for their future security.

BLACK PANTHER PARTY

Ill. RISE OF BLACK PANTHER PARTY

Proclaiming a legal right to bear arms, the Panthers by early 1967 had begun to
appear in public wearing black leather jackets and black berets, openly carrying
shotguns, rifles, or pistols, and shouldering bandoliers of ammunition.

Calling the police ‘‘pigs,’”’ the Panthers began a buildup in Negro areas of the
idea that police departments, especially that in Oakland, were dedicated to the
brutalization and harassment of minority groups, and, acting as an appendage of
white government authority, were working toward the eventual annihilation (geno-
cide) of the Negro race.

Invasion of California State Legislature

The first incident that brought national attention to this group occurred on May
2, 1967, as the California Legislature was in session in Sacramento. Approximately
40 members of the Black Panther Party, carrying loaded rifles, pistols, and shotguns,
and some wearing bandoliers of ammunition about their waists or draped over their
shoulders, burst into the Chamber. They were protesting a bill being introduced on
that date outlawing the carrying of loaded weapons in public and were proclaiming
their right to bear arms and criticize the police. Before they were arrested, they
passed out mimeographed leaflets calling on all Negroes to end the “terrorist”
oppression of colored races by white America and referring to the preparation of
concentration camps in the United States as a beginning of genocide.

Police Officer Meets Panthers--and Death

The Panthers became more militant with the passing of time. At 5:00 a.m.,
October 28, 1967, two Oakland, California, patrol officers, John F. Frey and Herbert
C. Heanes, made a routine traffic violation car stop. While the officers were a-
waiting the results of the car registration check by radio, the driver, Huey Newton,
got out of the car. Suddenly, shooting broke out. Officer Frey was killed; Officer
Heanes was wounded critically; and Newton received a stomach wound, He stopped
a passing automobile and had the driver take him to a hospital where he was taken
into custody and hospitalized. After a state trial, which began July 15, 1968,
Newton was sentenced on September 27, 1968, to serve from 2 to 15 years on a
charge of voluntary manslaughter.*

“Free Huey” Campaign

Two days after Patrolman Frey’s death, the Huey Newton Defense Fund was
established at a meeting of a section of the Negro community of Oakland.

The cry of ‘‘Free Huey”? became a clarion call. The imprisoned Newton was
built up in the public eye as “black and bold in defense of his people.’’ Each

*It was ruled later that the presiding judge in this trial erred in instructions to the jury.
Newton was released August 5, 1970, and scheduled for retrial.

bringing. its own axe to x J such organizations
as the anarchist New Left group named Students
for a Democratic Society; the Trotskyist Socialist
Workers Party and its youth group, the Young
Socialist Alliance; the Communist Chinese-
oriented Progressive Labor Party; the Communist
Party, USA, and its youth affiliate, the W. E. B.
DuBois Clubs of America; and militant campus
groups, black and white, began to gather in sup-
port of the Panthers, who were willing not only
to defy the establishment, but to destroy it.

' Enter Leroy Eldridge Cleaver
LEROY ELDRIDGE CLEAVER Early in 1967, the Panthers were joined by a
recent parolee from the California prison system,
author of a best-selling autobiography, Sou! On Ice, staff writer for the magazine
Ramparts, and admitted Marxist — Leroy Eldridge Cleaver.

In Soul On Ice, Cleaver wrote: ‘1 sought out his (Marx’s) books...It was like
taking medicine for me to find that, indeed, American Capitalism deserved all the
hatred and contempt that | felt for it in my heart....’”

After Newton was jailed, although he remained the undisputed leader, it soon
became apparent that Cleaver, designated Minister of Information, was projecting
a major leadership image. The Party began to further widen its publicity, nation-
ally and internationally, and enlarge its radical support and revolutionary intent.

As an example of this spreading influence of the Panther Party, the 1968
National Election ticket of the Peace and Freedom Party, a coalition of radical
groups, included Cleaver as candidate for the Presidential nomination; Newton as
candidate for the 7th Congressional District of Alameda County, California; Kath-
leen Cleaver, 18th Assembly District, California State Legislature; Bobby Seale,
17th Assembly District, California State Legislature. Cleaver received a national
total of almost 200,000 votes. Only a small percentage of the California elector-
ate cast their votes for Newton, Seale, and Kathleen Cleaver.

On the evening of April 6, 1968, Cleaver and several Panthers became involved
in a shoot-out with Oakland police officers. The incident resulted in the death of
a Panther, the wounding of two police officers, and the wounding and arrest of
Cleaver. Cleaver’s parole was revoked immediately and he was returned to prison.
After much publicity, he was later released on bail by a Superior Court Judge who
tuled that the jeopardy of his parole status stemmed “from his undue eloquence in
pursuing political goals...offensive to many of his contemporaries.’ This decision
was overtuled by the District Court of Appeals and upheld by the California Court
of Appeals. Cleaver was ordered to return to prison by November 27, 1968. Elect-
ing to become a Federal fugitive, he disappeared in late November, 1968, going
first to Havana, Cuba, and later to Algiers, where he has established residence.

International Committee to Defend Eldridge Cleaver

Soon after Cleaver’s arrest in the spring of 1968, approximately 150 prominent
individuals sponsored the establishment of an International Committee to Defend
Eldridge Cleaver. The committee intended to dispatch a team to Europe to gain

Rise of the Black Panther Party

In May, 1968, the hard-core membership of the Black Panther Party was esti-
mated at only 125, and Panther activity was confined largely to the San Francisco-
Oakland, California, area. However, because of the dramatic shoot-outs, the
“Free Huey’’ Campaign, the funds established for the defense of both Newton and
Cleaver, the widespread publicity, and the support given readily by white radical
groups and individual sympathizers, the Black Panther Party began to grow rapidly,
not only in membership but in militancy and influence. | Chapters began to appear
in major cities throughout the country. By the end of 1968, the membership had
reached nearly 2,000, with additional thousands of sympathizers and supporters.

National Committee to Combat Fascism

Set. up to coexist with Black Panther Party branches in various cities in the
United States are chapters of another organization called National Committee to
Combat Fascism. In actuality, there is little difference between the two. This
group, a Panther Party front, was set up as the result of a revolutionary conference,
called National Conference for a United Front Against Fascism, held in Oakland,
California, in July, 1969. The conference, sponsored by the Black Panther Party
and assisted by the anarchist Students for a Democratic Society and the Communist
Party, USA, was called to form a coalition of black and white radicals, described
as ‘oppressed people.’”

The National Committee to Combat Fascism is considered by Party leaders to
be the “political organizing bureau’’ of the Black Panther Party. Its specific task
allegedly is to raise the political level of the people and educate them against
the system.

International Section

On September 13, 1970, the International Section of the Black Panther Party
officially opened in Algiers. Joining Cleaver on the staff were his wife, Kathleen,
and Field Marshal Donald Lee Cox, a fugitive from justice. Cox faces charges
of unlawful flight to avoid prosecution for conspiracy to commit murder, based on a
warrant issued on April 20, 1970, at Baltimore, Maryland. He also failed to appear
on May 14, 1970, in San Francisco, to answer Federal firearms charges.

This section, in its entirety, was expelled from the Black Panther Party by
Huey Newton on February 27, 1971. The expulsion resulted from tensions and
differences between Party hierarchy which led to disruptive factionalism.

V. FUNDS

The money by which the Black Panther Party operates comes from a number of
sources. There are substantial private contributions; fees for public appearances,
such as campus speeches, radio, and television appearances; payments for mag-
azine articles; collections for trials and bai} funds in this country and abroad;
subscriptions and individual sales of the Party’s official organ, The Black Panther;
fund-raising activities sponsored by sympathizers and supporters; sales of record-
ings of interviews and speeches; and financial aid from radicals and extremists.

According to the press, there is reason to believe that the Panthers, to obtain
additional funds, are engaging in criminal activities, such as burglaries and
robberies.

BLACK PANTHER PARTY

VI. “SOCIALISTIC” PROGRAMS

Panther Party leaders insist their primary aim is to serve the “people,’”’
meaning ghetto blacks. To establish good intent, Party officials have set up a se-
ties of community services aimed at recruiting members and sympathizers and
building Party influence in ghetto areas. These programs, described by the Pan-
thers as “‘socialistic’’ programs, are suppos_ “to be carried out by all Party
branches and include: “liberation schools” to give. “our people a knowledge of
self’; free health clinics, with money, medical supplies and professional serv-
ices donated by laymen and professionals in the community; free clothing programs,
with clothing donated by the community; Community Information Centers, to ‘an-
swer the basic needs of the people’’; and a monthly free shuttle bus service for
families of blacks in prison. Few of these programs actually are carried out, and
those that have been attempted have been mostly unsuccessful.

The program that has received the most publicity is the “breakfast program,’”’
devised as a further means of indoctrinating Negro youth in Panther teachings of
racism and rebellion. As expressed in The Black Panther, June 14, 1969, “The
youth we are feeding will surely feed the revolution.’’ Breakfasts are held for
ghetto children either at churches, housing projects, Panther Community Informa-
tion Centers, or other space that can be obtained: free of charge. Panthers usually
ask local businessmen to donate food or money to this program, boycotting stores
that refuse to participate. At these functions, children have been known to sing
such chants as: “I am a revolutionary. | am a revolutionary. There’s going to be
some barbecue if Huey’s not set free. Power to the people.”

In 1969, Panther “Coloring Books’’ were printed and given out at these break-
fasts. The books contained 22 pages of drawings teaching the children to distrust,
hate, and kill police officers.

BLACK PANTHER PARTY

Vil. TACTICS

The Black Panther Party is a violent revolutionary group whose members pro-
voke confrontations with law enforcement officers and whose leaders incite racial
hatred and preach urban guerrilla warfare.

Target: Police

Panthers claim that black communities are occupied by the police in the same
way and for the same purpose that foreign troops occupy conquered territory and
that these forces, operating under ‘establishment’ orders, are engaged in gradual
annihilation of the black race. Blacks, according to the Panthers, must, through
urban guerrilla warfare, use guns to liberate themselves from the ever-present
repressive enemy. Children in Panther ‘‘schools’’ do their exercises to the rhythm
of: “There is a pig upon the hill — if you don’t kill him the Panthers will.”

Numerous claims have been made that the Black Panther Party is an innocent
victim of police persecution and genocide. This charge is rendered absurd by fact,
During 1970, 6 police officers were killed and 22 wounded through acts of violence
traced to the Panthers. One officer, in 1969, was killed by a Panther with a shot-
gun blast at point-blank range as the officer lay wounded and helpless on the
ground,

Out of 20 members named by the Panther Party as “killed in cold blood’’ by
the police, four were killed by members of a rival black extremist group on the
west coast; one died of barbiturate intoxication; one was shot and killed by
a store owner during a robbery attempt; one was killed by his wife over a love
affair he was having with a female Black Panther; and another was allegedly tor-
tured and killed by Panther Party members. Of the remaining twelve, two were
found dead on the street, the victims of unknown assailants, and ten were involved
in shoot-outs with police officers.

Attacks on Others

Panther attacks have not been limited to the police. While claiming their
intent to protect the black community, Panthers have assaulted and threatened
citizens who have tried to assist the police.

Neighborhood stores have been forced to ‘‘contribute’’ food supplies and
money under fear of Panther violence. Many other persons have also been victim-
ized, as shown by the fact that in 1969 alone 348 Panther members were arrested
for serious crimes, including murder, armed robbery, rape, bank robbery, and
burglary.

On April 21, 1969, 21 members of the Black Panther Party were charged in New
York in a 30-count indictment with conspiring to bomb public places and murder
policemen and with possessing dangerous weapons.

Weapons Caches

Stockpiles of machine guns, sawed-off shotguns, rifles, hand grenades, thou-
sands of rounds of ammunition, Molotov cocktails, gunpowder, and accumulations
of bayonets, swords, and machetes have been confiscated from Panther offices.

“Revolutionary Suicide’’

On August 7, 1970, Superior Court Judge Harold Haley, the Deputy District
Attorney, and three other persons were tied together with piano wire and dragged
from a San Rafael, California, courtroom and taken as hostages by three armed
Negro convicts, one of whom was standing trial for stabbing a San Quentin prison
guard. The escapees were assisted by the defendant’s 17-year-old brother who
supplied them with weapons for the escapade. Judge Haley, who had a sawed-off
shotgun taped to his neck, and the other hostages were forced into a waiting van.
When the authorities tried to stop the kidnappers, the judge was brutally murdered;
the Deputy District Attorney was injured seriously; and another hostage was
slightly wounded. Three Negroes were slain and one was wounded.

Immediately thereafter, Huey Newton declared the killing of Judge Haley as
being of ‘historical’ importance to the Black Panther Party. This declaration was
based on the Panther belief that all black prisoners, regardless of their crimes, are
political prisoners and should be released.

CONFISCATED PANTHER WEAPONS

The perpetrators of the courtroom incident were lauded by the Panthers as
setting another “revolutionary example for black people.’’ In commenting further,
The Black Panther of August 15, 1970, stated:

“The example that these brothers have set will be followed by
many and many will rise to choose revolutionary suicide rather
than reactionary suicide, Black people will unleash in great
numbers the Black kamakazi...’”
In his eulogy at services for the slain Negroes, Newton said: ‘Our comrades
have taught us all a revolutionary lesson. They have intensified the struggle and
placed. it on a higher level.’”

Panther ‘Justice’

Recalcitrant members of the Black Panther Party are sometimes victims of
Panther “justice.” As one example, Panther Chairman Bobby Seale was brought
to trial in New Haven, Connecticut, for the torture-murder of Panther Alex Rackley.
Rackley, a Panther suspected of being an informant, was scalded, murdered, and
dumped in a swamp.

For a variety of reasons, many members have been purged from the Party.
These incidents are usually written up in The Black Panther in special articles
accompanied by photographs.

“THE BLACK PANTHER, SATURDAY, MARCH 191 PAGE?

STATEMENT BY HUEY P. NEWTON, MINISTER
OF DEFENSE OF THE BLACK PANTHER PARTY

AND SUPREME SERVANT OF THE PEOPLE, ON
THE OCCASION OF REVOLUTIONARY
INTERCOMMUNAL DAY OF SOLIDARITY-

Power to the People, Brothers and
Sisters,

First of all I would like to thank alt
of you for my very presence here, be-
cause if i weren't Jor the Power of
the People, I wouldn't be here tonight,
I'm not here because of the Black
Panther Party; P'm not here because of
‘any grout, fm not here because of a
group of kamakazis, I'm here because
of the Power of the People,

We must remember that Revolution
is a process. It's not a conclusion
because once we conclude, then we be~
come cowter-revolutionary, And that
means even with the gun in our hands,
because fascism also has a gun, And
I would tike to say tonight that the Black
Ponther Party stands against alt forms
of fascism, including sexual fascism,
That we are against all kinds of chau-
vinism, including racial chawvinism;
we're | against sexual chauvinism,
national chowwinism, We're intercom-
munalists, Before I went to prison,
most of you Imow, you are aware, that
Tnever made any Speeches, yousee, be-
cause f'm not a very eloquent man,
Bm better Inown by the actions. And
the Party was built upon the actions,
And the action itself is a process.
‘And we're not ever fixated, We haven't
‘accepted ony dogma, And we will not.

‘And 1 would tike to say this, that
from now on the Party itself will be
‘etter known by éts contributions to the
People, for the simple reason that some
people around us seemto want to be
Inown through the Media, But the Party
can only judge itself through establich-
‘ng certain survival brograms, pending
Revolution, Because remember, you
make the Revolution, We can't free
political prisoners, only the people can
‘free political prisoners, And a people
who are not free cannot free their pri-
soners, canpot free the prisoners that
fascism makes. So 1 would like to soy
‘that we must work very hard in order
{o lift the consciousness of the people.
We inust free our Chairman Bobby
Seale, Angela Davis, Ruckell Magee,
the Soledad Brothers, the seven and
the Ueree, ard all other political pri-
soners. Randy. We have to free all of
them.

Bul we must remember that we must
‘exhaust every possible tactic. And we
must fet it be known that never broad~

cast military tactics for military rea~
sons. It’s perfectly correct to broad~
‘cast military tactics for political rea-
‘sons, That's what Uncle Ho said, and
Tagree with kim, So we would like for
the people to know that there are mony
‘things that we will not discuss in public,
Bul ‘what you can do is watch the fruits
of our work, And we would like to say
that our Party became an intercommunal

to be able to fight in a protracted
war, And that is why it is necessary
for us to develop the correct ideology,
which is a system of thinking, And we
must not rely upon and conclude with
the Philosophy, which isn’t necessarily

‘So we're ideologically revolutionists,
We're in a constant state of change.
And we fight with alt people who want

must pay more attention to what is

people, free the woman and also the happening, The news media has at-

man, that we have to get together in
tunity by substituting verbal expressions
for action, The final test of the pie is
‘the action, We'll stand on the Black
Panther Party, The Black Panther Party
From 1966 when it was formed will
stand on ifs record, will stand on the
‘ection. We won't claim to beultra-
eftists; we won't claim to be infan
tle lefists, What wo'll do is act in
accordance with the particular set of
‘conditions and the particular problem
Yiat we have at a time, So please judge
us upon our actions and we will develop
Uke. that, We will not develop with tip
service coming fromanyone. And some-
times Pm very thankful that I don't
{alk too well, because that"s only one
sway of communication, We say that a
Picture is worth a thousand words, but
‘action és supreme,

‘But what Rind of action you take will
depend upon the particular set of con-
ditions, And I say all of this, because
‘you know the Party ond the world to-
day is vader turmoil, And this is very
Good. We always have welcomed ail
forms of contradictions. Because with-
‘out the contradiction there is no trans-
formation, So fromthe contradiction that
has developed now in the world and in
the Party, we hope to have a qualita
tive leap. If this leop eliminates some
of us, then, of course, we'll weep for
that, ‘Bul vse must not stop the Revo-
lution, 1 will not stop the Revolution,
You should not stop it. And, for all
that i's worth, we know that words
will never stop it, Words will not start
the Revolution either. Only action,
‘Sisty-six hicked off the armed mani
festation of Revolution in this country,
Decause it focused upon the need for
the People not only to aefend them-
selves, but also to develop a conscious
ness necessary lo perform and to act

21

tempied fo discredit the Party by saying
that it’s over, because they don't see
‘anyone, I think our programs are better
than the Party, The commuities are
involved in forty-four cities. We must
support these; we must expand them,
Because 1 read an article, recently, a
Jew months ago, where Che had some
broblems in Bolivia, because the peas~
‘ants were so unconscious tatil he could
not rally them even with the “focos”.
They did not widerstand why the mili
tary, the regular military was dropping,
So what did he do, He attempted to
form. certain programs that he called
‘survival programs. He attempted to
form a free health program in order
to get the peasants inside, to help
them, and also to provide things for his
Soces, He also took to form a free
breakfast program, « free shoe factory,
‘and a sporting good store (for obvious
reasons), So programs are good, Be~
cause an act that might be revolutionary
might be counter-revohitionary, if the
correct preparations are not made,

So to be & serious revolulionist, we
must know that we are involved in a
Process, and not a set of principles
‘or conclusions that are of face-valye
‘evolutionary, I do not kmow one thing
that is revolutionary in itself, And oli
things might be revolutionary in con
text. In other words, capitalism was
revolutionary when it kicked out feudal
dsm, And now we have a situation where
the capitalists have become the imper-
ialists, and the people of the world,
of the communities of the world wilt
have to kick them out. So in order to
‘Sree Angela, Bobby, Ruchell Magee
‘and all other political prisoners, we
must hick the fascists out, And we can=
not do it with lip service,

BOBBY SEALE :

HACK PANTIE, SATURDAY, APRIL, PLUNGE 2

“| AM THE CHAIRMAN OF
ONLY ONE PARTY.”

March, 1971
This is Brother Bobby Seale, from
the New Haven Courthouse, back in jail,
back here, And I just wanted to say te
the people, the masses of people, toall
the brothers and sisters, Women's Lib-
eration Movement, Black brothers: and
fers, Chicano brothers, the Puerto
Rican ‘brothers, the young revolu-
Hionary White youth in Ameriéa, and
especially, all the Black brothers and
isters in the Black community, that
Tve seen a lot of things happening;
and Uve took time to analyse what's
happening, And [see presently that
there’resome divisionary , counter-
revolutionary actions goingon, Now the
Party accepts constructive criticism,
Constructive criticism! But thedi
sionary, counter-revolutionary actions
and jive tactics of Eldridge Cleaver is
doing nothing but aiding the pig power
structure, Aiding the pig power struc-
ture in their attempt to putin gas cham~
bers and jails over 130 political prison-
ers, who are presently, like myself and
Ericka, caught up in these jails, and are
being railroaded to the gas chamber,
where we're fighting for our lives in
these trials. And this is the only thing
that Eldridge’s actions are doing. This
is the only thing that can see that is
going on, And my analysis shows this,
‘There is no splitin the Black Panther
Party, at all, But the mainthing that we
‘want to get across, | want ro get across,
to the people is that the Party is based
on Survival Programs to serve the peo-
ple, and these survival programs -
from Breakfast for Children to the
recent programs that I'm designing
right here in jail, in my time that 'm
not in court, which is a decent housing
fit for shelter of human beings program
= these are survival programs -and
this program andall other programs
that all other revolutionary organiza-
tions have are survival programs, that
must sustain the people so the people
can wage a revolutionary struggle,
And Eldridge Cleaver, who's de-
nouncing these types of programs and
carrying on with all those other divi-

sionary Jive tactics, is negating the real
meaning of a People’s revolutionary
struggle, That's why the Black Panther
Party belongs to the people, because the
survival programs come forth, and we
set up the survival programs to sustain
the people’s revolutionary struggle,
Even the Vietnamese people, if one
would check it out, have their survival
programs; they have their cooperative,
functional survival programs throughout
their land, amongst their people. The
people just don’t have guns alone fight~
ing their battle, The people over there
have actual everyday, functional, con-
structive survival programs. In their
countries, in their lands, and in their
everyday operations in fighting the
capitalist pigs who accupy thetr coun-
try, they have survival programs, And
those survival programs sustain the
revolutionary struggle there, Of
course, our sucvival programs will be
directly related tohere in America, But
1, myself, send solidarity and support to
all the socialistic, revolutionary peo-
ples of the world, and the socialistic
countries and lands - and the different
war zones, where the people, the mass-
es in those lands, are fighting against
the capitalistic, imperialistic ruling
class circles.

‘And Eldridge Cleaver - who negates
the very survival programs. that the
Party is trying to set forth, that the
Central Committee is trying to set
forth, and all the real dedicated, hard-
working brothers in the Party aretry-
ing to set forth to educate the people
and serve the people, these survival
programs ( that) sustain the people’s



NW 65360 Docld:3298:

to the gas chambers, He's aiding the
power structure and causing ustobein
the prisons, because the political pri-
soners are the ones who really initiate
and work hard to maintain the survival
Programs for the revolution, the peo-
ple’s revolutionary struggle.

Only the masses of the people can
really {ree political prisoners, And the
people must see the value and the vali-
dity of the survival programs, And get-
ting on down to it, sothe people can un-
derstand where it’s at, so thatthe peo
ple, even the supporters that we have all
over Furope, all the solidarity com-
mittees that are in Rurope, that're in
‘Sweden, that arein Denmark, andother
countries over there, who support the
freedom of political prisoners in this
country, who support the survival pro~
grams of the poor oppressed people in
this country, and the revolutionary
movement (who are initiating these
programs), {am trying myself to get
people to understand, that we are heau-
tifully behind them and we are glad and
send’ greetings to them and praise the
People who are in the solidarity com~
mittees in other countries, and in fact
here in America, here | in Ameri-
KKK-a, U think that the people really
have to understand who and what the
Black Panther Party is, so that these
reactionary, counter-revolutionary ,
divisionary tactics will not be misun-
derstood, The Party is not falling apart,
{t's just that Bldridge Cleaver has per
sonally defected his own self from the
Party, He defected from the Party.

And 1, Bobby Seate, am theChairman
of only one Party. And that Party isthe
Party that Brother Huey P. Newton is
the Minister of Defenseof and oneof the
supreme, top servants of the people;
that Brother David {lilliard is the Chief
of Staff of; that Brother June !lilliard is,
the Assistant Chief of Staff of; that
Bobby {lutton was a member of, before
the pigs murdered him, Lam the Chair-
man of only one Party, that Brother
Fred Hampton, who loved the survival
programs for the people, was Deputy
Chairman of, I'm the Chairman ofonly
one Party, who Brothers Jonathan
Jackson and George Jackson are mem~
bers of, I’m the Chairman of only one
Party, of the Central Committee of the
Black Panther Party, with Huey, David,
and the rest of the brothers and sisters
‘on the Central Committee, where the
Central Headquarters-happensto belo-
cated on Peralta Street in Oakland,

(California), So All Power to the Peo-
Pie, Right On, And we're going tostick
together, We ain't coming up with no
Jive. We have to free Brothers Ruchell
Magee, George Jackson; we have to free
Sister Angela Davis; we have to free
these brothers and sisters, | am the
Chairman of only onePacty, theParty
that Brother Huey is the Minister of
Defense, with David Hilliard, June Fil-
Hard, etc, And we're going to free po-
litical prisoners; and, we're going to
keep these survival programs going;
and, we're going to wage a People’s
revolutionary struggle, and not no
jive, individualistic, defecting actions,
by Some individual who wants to play
power games, I am theChairman ofthe
Party of which the San Quentin Cadre
is apart and parcel of the sameParty.
The San Quentin Cadre of the Black
Panther Party.

So all T have to say to the people is
that you know where it’s at, We're go-
ing to stick in solidarity. There’re a
bunch of jive renegades and jack-a-
hapes around, But later for that, Just
later for that, Let that ride, cause we
got survival to get onwith, and aPeo-
Ple’s revolution to mobilize, And we got
political prisoners tofree allover this
land,

ALL POWER TO THE PROPLEL
RIGHT ON!

the weapons of the pig army, M-1
rifles, 43 caliber pistols and .30
caliber sniper carbines, but were not
able to do so, The act was accom-
plished in one fast motion, and the
heroes escaped capture and one week
later, “law enforcement offictals"* are
‘still scratching their heads in wonder-
ment,

And although the weapons, them-
selves, tools of our liberation were not
liberated from the oppressor, the
‘Success of this action cannot be denied,

As has been the case in liberation
‘movements all over the world, the guns
and arms made by and for the op-
pressor eventuallyends up in the hands
of the oppressed. Move important, the
unknown people who accomplished this
act, obtained hundreds of rounds of
desperately needed ammunition, Again,
bast experiences has shoun that while
the guns themselves can be obtained
in ample supply, the ammunition, the
bullets, that actually inflicts deathupon
our enemy, becomes very scarce. One
of the necessities of our struggle is
our ability to liberate, stockpile, and
then accurately use the ammunition of
‘our oppressor upon our oppressor.

As for the military personnal
records, they can obviously be put to
good use, Our oppressors must be
harassed and intimidated day andnight,
They must not sleep, nor vest, these
are the devils who plot the genocide
of Black people. The National Guard
Armory in the small town of New-
buryport, like other small time tows
surrounding the Black colony in Bos-
ton is designed to be used against us
in the fascist genocidal plot devised
by the treacherous minds ofthe Nixon~
Agnew-Mitchell clique, It is to be
carried out by those men whosenames
and addresses are now in the hands of
the people. Unknown members of the
fascist majority now appear beforethe
people's tritunat and will be judged
according to their actions,

This action is just one of many blows
which will be dealt out to the op-
pressor. If this action was intended
to help and serve the people, we wel-
come their help to our just liberation
struggle against the Babylonian
Empire.

“Revolutionary Art’

The most prominent artist on The Black Panther staff is Minister of Culture
Emory Douglas. Although he prepares a large number of cartoons, other Panther
artists are also represented. These cartoons characterize the Government. and
local law enforcement as ‘‘pigs’’ and call for the overthrow of the Government
and the killing of Government officials, as well as police officers.

International News

Panthers profess to believe that American Negroes comprise isolated ‘col-
onies” in the heart of the ‘‘mother’’ country, and are part of the Third World,
defined as the noriwhite, undeveloped, and underdeveloped countries of the world.
The 10-Point Program of the Black Panther Party includes, as a major political
objective, a United-Nations-supervised plebiscite to be held throughout the
black colony to determine the national destiny of American Negroes.

To internationalize their Party and enlarge their importance, Panther leaders
have sought acceptance, support, and funds from sources abroad. They have made
numerous trips to foreign countries, including Canada, Mexico, Cuba, Palestine,
Germany, France, England, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Soviet Union, North Korea,
North Vietnam, and the Chinese Mainland.

Both at home and abroad, Panther leaders loudly proclaim anti-American
sentiments and align themselves politically with the aims and tactics of enemy
lands. The international contacts most important to the Panthers are made with
revolutionary groups and communist countries, especially those that more closely
follow Maoist thinking. The international news section of The Black Panther
reflects attempts by the Black Panther Party to attract such attention, support,
and aid.

TELEGRAM TO
COMRADE KIM IL SUNG

KIM IL SUNG

PREMIER OF THE CABINET
DEMOCRATIC PEOPLES RE-
PUBLIC OF KOREA

June 25th marks the 20thanniver-
sary of the U.S, imperialist ag-
Bressive invasion of the DPRK in

The Black Panther Party takes
this occasion to salute the DPRK
and the wise and brave leader of the
40 million Korean people, Com-
rade Kim Il Sung.

We recognize and respect the
tong history of resistance and vic-
tory that Comrade Kim Il Sung
and the 40 million Korean people
have contributed to the world wide
struggle against imperialism and
fascism; the shining examples of
socialist construction while under
severe conditions of U.S, pro-
vocation and aggression, the many
brilliant ideological contributions
you have made to the socialist
camp and in particular the con
cept of “Juche”,

Because of our historical ex-
perience in America; because we
are faced with no alternatives but
genocide or liberation we under=
stand the criminal nature and
gangster logic of the U.S, ruling

class, Black people are increas-
ingly the victims of overtmitlitary
aggression and U.S, plots to sub
vert our struggle for national sal-
vation, Under these conditions we
have an increasing awareness that
the expulsion of the US, imper-
ialist burglars from Korean soil
and the reunification ofKorea will
be a victory for the Korean peo-
ple and a victory for oppressed
people the world over,

We see clearly that the reuni-
fication of Korea is not seperate
from the salvation of Black and
other oppressed people in fascist
America, As gang boss Nixon and
his mob of criminals intensify
their attempts to loot Asia they
are intensifying their murderous
repression of Black people in
America, These attacks will be
met with revolutionary solidarity
manifested in action, both around
the world and in the gangsters
lair, and with one-beat-a-hundred
fighters in Africa, Asia, Latin
America, and North America; the
U.S.A. will surely be brought tothe
peoples JUSTICE,

ON CHAIRMAN MAO TSE TUNG’S DECLARATION
OF 20 MAY, 1970

In this declaration, Chairman Mao
Tse Tung has set forth a brilliant
and timely analysis of the qualita~
tively new situation that exists in the
world as a result of the treacherous
new acts of aggression launched by
the fascist, imperialist Néxon-

Chinesepeoples,

This declaration pulls together into
clear focus the revolutionary struggles
and the liberation struggles of the peo-
le of the whole world, including the
revolutionary struggle ofthe American
people themselves,

Speaking specifically for the Black
Panther Party, dut reflecting the
Sentiments of millions of oppressed
People inside the United States, it has
become crystal clear to us that

rampant imperialist aggression onthe
international scale and vicious fascist

repression on the domestic scale are
the two faces of the criminal govern-
ment of the United States and the
calculated policy of the American
ruling, circles. For 400 years now,
Black people inside the United States
have been the long-suffering victims
of fascist violence and repression,
But under the Nixon-Pentagon clique,
this reactionary violence and repres-
sion has been escalated to newheights
of barbaric crusity. At the sametime,
in order to put down the already gi-
gontic and still growing mass move-
‘ment among White Americans against
the wreckless and sanguinary poli-
cies and imperialist adventures of
the U.S. government, the cowardly
\Nixon-Pentagon clique has unleashed
a bloodbath against the Americanpeo-
ple as a whole, creating for itself
new enemies who have joined hands
with those who were already deter-
mined to carry out a struggle to the
bitter end against an economic, polit-
ical, and social system that is do-
minated by the madmen in the
Pentagon and that is responsible for
the misery and bloodshed all over the
world today,

Chairman Mao Tse Tung captures
the truth of the situation when he
points out the unprecedented isula-

IW 65360 Docid:32989606 Page 160

37

tion of the Nixon-Pentagon clique.
Never before have these criminals
been so exposed and isolated as they
are today. And never before has it
been so clear that this criminality
can only be ended by the people rising
up to seize their own destiny from
the handfull of willful exploiters and
murderers that now have the power
in their hands,

Coupling a revolutionary call to
arms with revolutionary optimism in
the assurance of victory, Chairman
Mao Tse Tung, the great leader of
the Chinese Revolution, hero and tea-
cher of the revolutionary people of
the world, has performed an inval-
uable service to all mankind by step-
ping forward at this time to renew
the people's indictment of the common
enemy of us all--U.S. Fascism and
Imperialist Aggression. These coura-
geous words of Chairman Mao Tse
Tung will give new heart to the peo
ples in their lonely anddifficult strug-
gles to throw off the shackles and
chains of oppression now being held
in place by U.S, Fascism and Im-
berialism,

Lastly, we wish to point out that
only the enemies of the people and
those who shirk their revolutionary
duties and who are afraid of their
‘own shadows will find fault with Chair-
man Mao Tse Tung’s declaration. For
our part, we welcome it, because we
have learned, by shedding our blood,
that only through relentless struggle,
by resorting to arms inside the very
house of U.S. Fascism and Imperial-
ism itself, can we gain our freedom
and liberation, This is what our ex-
perience has taught us and this is
the faith that will sustain us as we
push forward our struggle.

LONG LIVE CHAIRMAN MAOTSETUNG!
LONG LIVE THE VICTORY OF THE
PEOPLES’ WAR!

DEATH TO THE U.S, FASCISM AND
IMPERIALIST AGGRESSION!

Atkinson, Unit Chiefs Homer A. Newman, Jr., David Ryan, Garnett T.
Tunstall, and Special Agent Paul Daly of the Legal Counsel Divisio
met with Jack Smith and Lester B. _ Seidel of the SSC staff.

At the outset Mr. Seidel indicated that SSC would do case .
studies on various organizations against which the COINTELPRO was
directed, Black Panther Party (BPP) had been chosen for the start
because many BPP members had been involved in and convicted of
criminal activity. He distributed copies of a document (a copy of
which is attached) outlining the purpose of the meeting and setting
out requests that will be made of the Bureau through appropriate
channels in connection with this Gase study. TIneludéd in this’
document, along with requests for various Bureau documents regarding
COINTELERO as it pertains to the BPP, were requests for a list of
all local police departments and personnel contacted, a list of all
media persons contacted and pieeent locations. > a

See ~ % Set

The investigative responsibilities of 2 Buréau, as
relates to the BPP, were described generally to Messrs. Seidel and
Smith highlighting the origin of this violence-prone organization
and the series of violent confrontations in which it participated in
the late 1960s. Mr, Seidel stated that he was specifically interested

Memorandum to Mr. W. R, Wannall
Re: SENSTUDY 75
62-116395

instances of institution of counterintelligence activities were
discussed, and it was indicated that these activities were minor as
far as the overall BPP investigation was concerned.

In connection with COINTELPRO, the Bureau letter to
SAC, San Francisco dated 5/11/70 captioned "Counterintelligence and
Special Operations" was discussed. Basically, this better suggests
San Francisco consider a proposal that through the use of documents
subtly incorporating false information, attempt to give the BPP
the impression that the documents were stolen by a disgruntled
police employee who is sympathetic to the Panthers. This
document was presented to the House of Representatives Committee on
Internal Security in 1974 and was included in their publication of
hearings conducted by that Committee. Messrs. Seidel and Smith
wanted to know if the activities outlined in this letter had been
implemented by the San Francisco or Los Angeles Offices. He was
advised that this letter was not implemented as it had requested
comments and recommendations of the San Francisco Office, and that
Office had recommended against the proposals contained therein.

Mr. Seidel asked the identity of the SAC who recommended
against this proposal and was advised that the SAC there, at that
time, would not necessarily have had personal knowledge of the matter.
He then asked identity of supervisor who recommended against proposal
and was advised this information was available in the field office.
Concerning COINTELPRO in general, he inquired as to specific
techniques used against the BPP and whether forgery and wiretaps
had been a part of the program. He was advised that we were unable
to furnish that information without extensive file review.

. Mr. Seidel attempted to discuss Special Operations but
he was advised that the matter was not within the purview of the
current meeting.

Mr. Seidel explained that they would be traveling to
San Francisco and intended to interrogate personnel in that Office
as well as unspecified outsiders who may have been involved in
COINTELPRO. Mr. Seidel stated that he had asked for the meeting
with Bureau personnel to obtain background data to aid them in these |

interrogations. Both Messrs. Seidel and Smith expressed
appreciation for the assistance given them at this meeting and
both additionally expressed their feeling that the Bureau had
done a good and proper job in its investigation.

During the course of this meeting a monograph on the
BPP prepared by the Bureau in March of 1971'was used for back-
ground data. Mr. Seidel expressed a desire to have a copy of this

document. This document, which is prepared from public source

The purpose of this memorandum is to advise that ¥
a representative of captioned Committee requested to be given a i ia
briefing concerning counterintelligence programs as applied to our y

investigation of the Black Panther Party in San Francisco.

Lester Seidel, staff member of captioned Committee a
who is assigned the area of COINTELPROS, advised that the A
Committee is preparing what he termed case studies on COINTELPROS +._.4,-
in four separate areas. He defined these areas as the Black Panther

Party in San Francisco, White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan of Mississippi,
the Professor Morris J. Starsky incident, and the Fred Hampton case
(Black Panther Party leader in Chicago who was killed during a police

raid in Chicago, Illinois).

Seidel previously had requested the Bureau arrange
interviews of various Bureau personnel whom he considered familiar
with the San Francisco Black Panther Party investigation, and at that
time stated he intended to interview these individuals in two or three
weeks. Mr. Seidel requested that prior to conducting interviews
concerning this particular area, he desired to be briefed during the , |
week of June 8 concerning the Bureau's general overall investigation
of the Black Panther Party in San Francisco, along with the use of
: counterintelligence proposals against that organization, In this regard
aS he desired that someone knowledgeable in this aspect be made availabl

to brief him concerning this matter.

On 6/9/75, Mr. K. William O'Connor telephonically bditiedetttons

advised me that the Committee is interested in information concerning

certain electronic surveillance coverage instituted at the request of the

White House concerning seventeen individuals. Mr. O'Connor said that

he understands that a letter was addressed to the White House by the f
Bureau furnishing copies of documents that summarized the information Vie
available to the Bureau concerning the alleged seventeen wiretaps. t fi
Mr. O'Connor requested that he be briefed concerning this matter 4

in order for him to discuss the Committee's requests.

It appears that Mr. O'Connor may be referring to a letter
dated July 23, 1974, that was addressed to Mr. George P. Williams,
Associate Counsel to the President, at the White House. A memorandum
was addressed to the Attorney General also dated July 23, 1974, captioned
"Electronic Coverage Placed At The Request of the White House," which
advised the Department that pursuant to the authorization of the Deputy

Attorney General certain documents had been furnished to Mr. Williams
at the White House.

7 That the Intelligence Division identify the materials involved
in Mr. O'Connor's request and provide him with an appropriate briefing.

In my letter to you dated April 21, 1975, I recommended
against release of these exhibits to the Senate Select Committee as they

deliberative process for ar in-house Department investigation. I
strongly object to the release of these exhibits. In the event you deem
it necessary to release these exhibits to the Senate Select Committee,

T request the enckeed copies, which have been excised in an attempt to
avoid intrusions upon individuals' right of privacy and compromise of

FROM

SU,

6/4/75,
/SENSTUDY 7:

On 6/4/75, Mrs, Dorothy Skillman, former Executive
Assistant..te. Mr.. Clyde Tolson, was interviewed by Mr. Mark H.
Gittenstein and Miss Mary Deoreo of the Senate Select Committee
Staff. Mrs. Skillman was escorted to the interview by former
Assistant to the Director John P, Mohr who remained outside
the interview room during the interview. Prior to the interview,
Mrs. Skillman was met by SA L. F, Schwartz at which time she
advised that she had been advised by Mr. John Hotis, Office j ie
of Legal Counsel, that the interview was to be concerning Ca
Mr. Hoover's Official and Confidential (OC) files and that if
questions came up during the interview on other matters whieh
might impinge on Sensitive sources and methods, current Bureau
investigations, etc., she was free to request an interruption
of the interview to consult with Mr. Schwartz.

The interview of Mrs, Skillman commenced at 2:30 p.m.,
and it was terminated at approximately 4:30 p.m. On only one
occasion toward the end of the interview, Mrs. Skillman asked
to consult with Mr. Mohr and Mr. Schwartz. She advised that
the interviewers had asked her concerning her knowledge of
what might have been in certain cartons which were reportedly
stored in the recreation room area of the late Director's
residence. Mrs. Skillman stated that she thought these cartons
contained many of the gifts and mementos that had been collected
by Mr. Hoover over a period of years. After consulting with
Mr. Mohr, she realized that she knew this only from comments
that had been made to her by Mr. Mohr and had no firsthand
knowledge of the contents of the cartons. On Mr. Mohr's advice,
she advised the interviewers that she had no firsthand
knowledge of what was in the cartons but that she knew that
Mr. Mohr was aware of what was in them because he was present
when the appraisers of Mr. Tolson's estate inventoried the
entire house including these cartons. At the conelusion of
jthe interview, Mr, Gittenstein commented to Mr, Mohr that he
might have further questions to ask him concerning the contents
lof the cartons but would probably handle Biers a Ges call

Re: Interview of Mrs, Dorothy Skillman
6/4/75
Senstudy 75

After the completion of the interview, Mrs, Skillman
advised Mr. Mohr and Mr. Schwartz that the interviewers had
asked her a great number of questions concerning her knowledge
of the OC files which she said was very limited, the layout
of Mr. Hoover's house and the work that Mrs. Skillman and
Miss Gandy had done at the residence subsequent to Mr. Hoover's
death, She stated that the interviewers were quite courteous
and in no way antagonistic, Mr. Mohr requested Mrs, Skillman
to type up an informal memorandum concerning the interview
and he indicated that when this was done, he would provide
a copy to the Bureau.

the Department and White House had instructed that they not
be made available until such time as the Committee decides
to allow Bureau representatives to be present during inter-
view.

By way of background, you will recall that these
employees were released from the Employment Agreement and
were made available for interview on May 20, 1975, by
captioned Committee. However, the Department in objection
stated that they were desirous that a Bureau representative
be present during the interview. The topic of the interview
was to have been their dufies and responsibilities during
the period of July to September, 1964, in connection with the
Democratic National Convention, Atlantic City, New Jersey. _
Ultimately, neither the Department nor the White House could
reach agreement concerning the interviews and the employees Ly
did not submit to interview.

On June 3, 1975, Michael Epstein, staff member
of captioned Committee again requested these employees be
made available for interview on June 5, 1975, at 10:00 a.m.
The scope of the interview would be the responsibilities and
duties performed during the period of July to September, 1964,
in connection with the Democratic National Convention in
Atlantic City, New Jersey.

Memo from Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams
SENSTUDY 75

Mr. Epstein classified the interview as an "abuse"
type and agreed to allow agents to be available but not present
during interview.

On June 3, 1975, K. William O'Conngr, Special Counsel
to the Deputy Attorney General for Intelligence Coordination,
was advised of the request and of the fact that an agent could
not be present during interview. He stated that the Department's
position was that unless the Committee consented to allow Bureau
personnel to be present, the interview would not go forth, and
that he would advise Epstein and F. A. 0. Shwartz, Chief Counsel
of the Committee, of this d@cision.

Mr. O'Conner telephonically recontacted Special Agent
Daly and advised that he discussed the matter with assistant
to the Counsel $ the President, James A. Wilderotter.
Wilderotter told O'Conner it was the White House position that
these girls should not be made available for interview unless
the Committee allows Bureau personnel to be present. Wilderotter
stated these two employees had been cited as examples wherein
the White House felt interviews should not be conducted without
representatives of the particular agency or Bureau being present
as they are service personnel. According to Wilderotter, Shwaréz
agreed to this position.

O'Conner telephonically contacted Special Agent Daly
on June 4, 1975, at which time he advised that he had discussed
the interview with Shwargz, Epstein, and staff member Mark
Gitenstein, and they would hold in abeyance the request to
interview the employees pending a review of documents the Bureau
is making available .concerning 1964 lantic City Convention as
stated in the Committees request of pe 14, 1975.

Dear Mr. Jones:

As you are aware, I have been concerned for some time about the nature of the
Bureau's involvement in local law enforcement affairs. This concern has been
heightened by my appointment to the House Select Committee to Investigate the
U. S. Intelligence Community. In this light, I am requesting answers to the
following questions concerning FBI activity in Berkeley:

1. What is the size.of the contingent of agents in the Berkeley field office?

2. What are the functional responsibilities in the field office, and what are
the percentages of agents involved in each, i.e., political, drug abuse,
criminal, etc.?

3. What are the titles of the agents, and how do these relate to their
involvement in category two?

4, What is the ethnic and sexual breakdown of the staff and agents in the
Berkeley field office?

5, What are the interactions and working relationships between the field
office, the Berkeley Police Department, the University of California
Police Department, private security agencies and informers? How many
informers are utilized by the field office?

6. Recent disclosures have raised serious questions regarding the Bureau's
involvement in political surveillance activities of organizations and
individuals over the past several years. What actions has the local
field office taken to correct the abuses of these actions, and what
political surveillance is being undertaken?

Honorable Ronald V. Dellums
House of Representatives
Washington, D. €. 20515

Dear Congressman Dellums:

This is in response te your letter dated
May 28, 1975, sent to the Seniox Resident Agent
of the Berkeley, California, TBI Resident Agency.

To clarify your inquiries, it should be noted
the Resident Asency at Berkeley, California, operates
under the general supervision of the FBI's
San Franciseo Office.

There are currently nineteen Special Agents
assigned to the Berkeley Resident Agency. All are white
males. The function of a resident agency is to handle

| all FBI matters within its specific geographical
=| territory, This includes crininal, security and

applicant investigations. The FBI docs not have primary

‘| Jurisdiction regarding drug mattexs and does not

conduct “political” investigations.

AS _a matter of policy, the FBI advises other
governmental lav enforcement agoneles of matters coming
to our attention which are within the investigative
jurisdiction“of those agencies. In some cases there is
concurrent jiirisdiction and a joint investigation may
be conducted; however, local law enforcement agencies
do not have access to FBI files. Representatives
of private security agencies may be contacted from
tine to time in the course of discharging our official
responsibilities just as any other citizens nay be
contacted. The FRI also utilizes the services of
informants to develop information concerning matters
within this Bureau's investigative jurisdiction; hovever,
it would be inappropriate for me to discuss rore
specifically the number of such informants or the manner
in which they are utilized. wy) fe

Honorable Ronald V. Dellums

As I have already indicated, the FBI does not
conduct "political” investigations, nor do we conduct
“political surveillances." We do, of course, have a
responsibility for conducting domestic intelligence
investigations authorized under legislative enactments,
Presidential Directives and instructions of the
Attorney General. These matters relate to espionage,
sabotage, treason, sedition, and other activities
involving the internal security of the United States.
The policies relating to such investigations are
not made on an ad hoc basis by individual
Agents or individual offices, but conform with broad
policy applicable to all offices.

The FBI offers a variety of courses of
instruction for law, enforcement personnel throughout
the United States, including such subjects as
anti-sniper and survival training and special weapons and
tactics, commonly known as "SWAT", The basic purpose
of this training is to provide well prepared
teams capable of resoiving highly dangerous situations
with a minimum of risk to innocent bystanders, the law
enforcement personnel involved and the subjects of the
investigation.

Enclosed is a newsclipping describing some
of the training of our own personnel in this field.
The article appeared on June 1, 1975, in the
“Washington Star News."

Sincerely yours,

Ge ML Molicy

Chairman, Security Committee, U. S. Intelligence Board, who advised
that the draft had been reviewed by CIA and by the Security

that the draft be revised in order to recognize the need for certain

(a procedure already being followed by the Church Committee) and i}
the desire of the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) that it ,

By referenced memorandum dated 3/12/75, Legal Counsel
recommended that the Intelligence Division (INTD) discuss with
representatives of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and other !
members of the intelligence community procedures for clearing
staff members of captioned committees for access to classified
information when questions as to the individual's trustworthiness
have arisen in the course of the FBI's background investigation. Ea
Following such discussions, Legal Counsel recommended that a
Memorandum of Understanding concerning these matters be prepared
by the INTD which might be used by both Senate and House U/

SS,

Committees,

By memorandum 3/25/75, the INTD submitted for approval
a draft of a proposed Memorandum of Understanding concerning
clearance procedures for staff members of captioned committees.
Special Investigative Division disagreed with several features
of our draft memorandum and has prepared a revised memorandum,
which is attached for approval.

UNRECORDED COBX EER ES

The INTD has coordinated this matter with the Special
Investigative Division and interposes no objection to the text
of the revised memorandum; however, it is suggested that considera-
tion be given to adding the words "by the FBI" at the end of
paragraph five on page one. Paragraph five, thus modified, would
read: "Where there is a question of trustworthiness for access
to classified information, the Committee Chairman will have the
summary memorandum ‘furnished to the Director of Central

On 3/7/75 Mr. Mintz and I called on Senator Church and his
staff director, Bill Miller, to further discuss the procedures for
investigating and clearing ‘stat employéés ‘of the Coiimittéee, particularly
wheré information might be developed raising a question as to the propriety
of a clearance. It had previously béen approved that the FBI would conduct
the background investigations, furnishing the results to Senator Church,
and after his determination that the individuals met the required criteria
for access to classified information he would notify CIA of his determination
and intent to employ the individual involved, at which time CIA would grant
the necessary clearance based on the certification by Senator Church,

oh ‘fy eo

In discussions between CIA and FBI representatives, we raised
the question as to whether CIA would review the results of the investigation
prior to granting clearances and CIA representatives indicated they did
not intend to and were reluctant to inquire of Senator Church as to whether
they could be furnished the results of any investigations involving derogatory
information.

if tds poss

In discussing‘this matter with Senator Church, I inquired whether
he had any objection to our bringing to the attention of CIA any questionable
cases in order that CIA representatives, who have the responsibility of
granting the actual clearances, would be in a position to advise and counsel
with Senator Church on those individual cases. He had absolutely no objection
to this and, in fact, felt there should be an open communication between
FBI, CIA and his Committee to insure that no one was appointed and cleared
who did not measure up in every respect from a security standpoint.

Memorandum for Mr. Callahan
Re: SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON
INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

formerly employed by CIA and resigned in December, 1974, after his
clearance for sensitive compartmented information had been lifted as a
result of his marrying an alien. This marriage would not preclude him
from clearance for access to lesser degrees of sensitive material but

only for the more sophisticated clearances. Mr. Miller advised that Sloan
had not been appointed and was not going to be appointed because of other
reasons unrelated to a security clearance.

Senator Church indicated that he felt it would be wise to prepare
a memorandum outlining our security clearance procedures and his staff
would be glad to prepare such a document.

Following the meeting with Senator Church, Mr. Mintz and I
dropped by to see Congressman Nedzi, Chairman of the House Committee,
and delivered to him Mr. Kelley's letter congratulating him and offering
him our complete cooperation. Chairman Nedzi stated that he was very
appreciative of this offer and would consider Mr. Kelley's request to confer
with him as an open invitation and as soon as things had shaken down he would
be in touch with us.

We discussed with him the investigative and clearance procedures
we were following with the Senate Committee and Chairman Nedzi agreed
the same procedures should be followed with his Committee, including our
making available to CIA any derogatory information which might be pertinent to
a clearance determination. At first, he suggested that we send the results
of our investigations to CIA before coming to the Committee but then
concluded that it would be more appropriate for them to come to him first
since some of the applicants under consideration would probably not be i
appointed. He specifically asked that we prepare a memorandum of under- i
standing to be approved by CIA, FBI and himself.

Iasked Mr. Nedzi whether he felt the formulation of his Committee
would serve to trim down the number of requests for information being received
from various House committees and it was his opinion that if would help in
some instances; however, in others committee chairmen would pursue their
own inquiries. He personally did not feel he had the clout nor the desire to
try to preempt this area entirely for his Committee. He also stated he
felt that CIA's problems had in the main been fully exposed and would soon be

of less concern, whereas the concern over domestic security policies of
the FBI would undoubtedly be greater in the future. He expressed his
appreciation for our cooperation and indicated he was striving for a
responsible approach to the inquiry.

Following the meeting with Mr. Nedzi, Mr. Mintz and I agreed
that it would be best for us to prepare a proposed memorandum of under -
standing concerning the investigative and clearance procedures for both
Committees in order to try to insure uniformity, and Mr. Mintz will get -
in touch with Bill Miller to seek his concurrence in that regard. Our efforts
will be coordinated with CIA and the proposed memoratidum as drawn up
will be submitted for the Director's approval.

ACTION:

Information only.

By memorandum dated 5-22-75 you were advised that
former SA Robert Nichols had been contacted by Lester B. Seidel, staff
member of captioned Committee, at which time Seidel attempted to
arrange an interview of Nichols. Nichols was advised by Deputy Assistant
Director Jack E. Herington of the provisions of Attorney General R
Order 501-73 pertaining to Departmental approval prior to furnishing

- information from Bureau files. He was also reminded that he had signed
an employee agreement with the Bureau agreeing to maintain confidentiality
of the information contained in Bureau files. He was advised if he requested,
the Bureau would make available a representative to accompany him
should he be interviewed by the Committee.

Former SA Nichols telephonically contacted SA Paul V.
Daly of this Division on 5-28-75 and advised he had been recontacted by
Mr, Seidel. Seidel requested and Nichols agreed to travel to Washitigton,
D. C., on the morning of 5-30-75 for an interview at the Committee's
offices. Nichols stated that Seidel indicated the scope of the interview
would be concerning Martin Luther King, Stanley David Levinson, and
related matters. Nichols was unable to advise whether this was to be a
staff interview or an appearance for testimony purposes before an
executive session of the Committee. He stated he was not told by Seidel
that his appearance would be pursuant to a subpoena. eras requested

Bureau by other Government agencies and/or foreign intelligence sources

or adversely affecting an ongoing investigation. It was pointed out to

Mr. Nichols that if he so desires, he could, of course, obtain the services

of private counsel. He indicated it was his intention to arrive in

Washington Thursday night, 5-29-75. He was requested to appear in

the Office of Legal Analysis, Room 4513, at approximately 8:15 a.m.

on the morning of 5-30-75 so that arrangements might be made to brief him by
the Office of Legal Analysis and subsequently by the Intelligence Division.
Nichols stated he would do so.

The Office of Legal Analysis is attempting to obtain from
Committee representatives further information as to the circumstances
and exact time of interview of Nichols.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1) Intelligence Division representative be made available
to accompany Nichols to his interview with captioned Committee.

2) That Nichols be released from his employment agreement
to respond to questions concerning our investigation of Martin Luther King,
Stanley David Levinson, and related matters.

On May 27, 1975, James A. Wilderotter, Associate Courlgel
to the President, requested me and representatives of other agencies interested
in the arrangements concerning interviews of witnesses by the Senate Select
Committee to confer with him and Roderick Hills at 2:30 p.m. that date
at the White House. Mr. K. William O'Connor, Deputy Assistant Attorney
General, Inspector John B. Hotis and I represented the Department and the
FBI. Roderick Hills and James A. Wilderotter represented the President's
counsel; Bob Andrews represented the Defense Department; John Warner,
General Counsel, CIA; Roy Banner, General Counsel of NSA, and Mr. Hyland
from State Department as well as John Clark, Deputy to the Director of
CIA, attended.

The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the } latest v version of
proposed procedures to be followed by the Committee staff investigators
during interviews of former and curren' employees. Roderick Hills presented a
document (copy attached) which he described as a counteroffer by Frederick vd
Schwarz, Counsel to the Committee. He called for general discussion of the Ye
document after indicating that he had discussed this matter with Mr. Schwarz
at lunch on May 27th and felt that it was a workable document. I pointed out to
Mr. Hills that the document provides that there would be notice to the agencies
of the identity of witnesses a: reasonable time prior to interviews or taking of
sworn testimony except where "the committee or its appropriate delegee”
determines that prior notice should not be given. I told him that I was concerned
that that provision would be used by the Committee staff to permit individual

| staff inves tieergd? make that determination and I was confident they would

do so 7 Whe Gs” 23

Memorandum to Mr. Adams
Re: Senate Select Committee, etc.

Mr. Hills was reluctant to seek a modification of the language
indicating that he had an understanding with Mr. Schwarz that the authority
would be limited to the senior counsel and to members of the Committee.

I told Mr. Hills I would request that the language be modified in writing

so that the authority would be conferred on specific representatives of the
Committee to avoid having staff authority which I thought would be abused.
Mr. Hils finally agreed that the language would be modified so that the
authority would be available only to both Committee senior counsel and/or
a combination of senior counsel and a Committee member. Further, the
language would be modified to require that the determination that an agency
would not be given prior notice of a pending witness interview would be
recorded in writing for the Committee’s records.

Iasked Mr. Wilderotter and Mr. Hills whether this agreement
was to be made between the staff and the agencies or whether it in fact would be
accepted by the Committee. After some discussion, we were advised by
Mr. Hills and Mr. Wilderotter that the document would be submiited to the
full Committee for their approval and incorporated into the Committee's
records.

I pointed out that I believed it was necessary for the understanding
to be made between the Committee and the Executive in order for there to be
some basis for restraining Committee staff investigators who may not
be inclined to follow the rules.

Other proposed changes discussed would require the Committee
represatative to furnish to a witness a copy of the Committee's rules which
includes advice concerning the right to counsel and a copy of the proposed
guidelines for. witness interviews.

I recommended that the guidelines be expanded to address the
problem of existing secrecy agreements with former and present employees
and the procedural problem involved in Attorney General Order 501-73
which requires prior Departmental approval in order for a witness to
respond to a subpoena. As a result, Mr. Wilderotter advised on the
morning of May 28, 1975, that he would recommend the addition of a sentence
in the opening paragraph that would indicate the guidelines would not be
understood to impair the constitutional rights of individual witnesses, agency
agreements with employees or former employees, existing Departmental
orders or the Committee's own rules.

Memorandum to Mr. Adams
Re: Senate Select Committee, etc.

Other minor changes were considered and an effort will be made
to correct the language so that the agencies will be obliged to make reasonable
efforts to comply with all Committee requests instead of being required to
furnish “all information” absolutely.

Mr. Wilderotter advised on the morning of May 28th that the
comments described above will be discussed with Frederick Schwarz in an
effort to finally resolve this matter.

RECOMMENDATION:

For information.

OUTLINE FOR INQUIRY PROCEDURES -

aes

It is hoped that these voluntary guidelines will permit the
Select Committee investigation to proceed without undue delay,

but it is also recognized that these guidelines do rot cover all

points or anticipate all problems and that, therefore, either the
Select Committee or some agency under investigation may have
reason not to follow these suggested guidelines.

Also, it is recognized that this ouiline is without prejudice
to the respective legal positions of the agencies and the Select

Committee as to the Pod aE Ep acdepee information by way of

A. Classification of pn pear e Testimony

The parties to this investigation by the. Select Committee
recognize that interviews/preliminary testimony to be conducted
by the Committee staff will generally be of two separate and
distinct natures.

(1) Those primariiy seeking information con-~
cerning (A) the overall structure and functions
of any agency or its relationship with other
agencies or the Executive branch; (B) the
substantive work beitig done by the agency,
including the legal bases relied upon and the
requisite approval levels for authorization;
and (C) the capacities of each agency and the
responsibilities to provide information for, |,
other governmental entities.

An agency representative will be present, as a general rule

at interviews/preliminary testimony in the first category for the
purpose of assisting the Committee's investigation and facilitating
the protection of information important to the national interest which
is pertinent to the investigation. Similarly, as a general rule,
agency representatives will not be present at interviews [preliminary
testimony in the second category. The parties recognize, however,
that for special reasons exceptions can be made in either case: i.e.,
when good reason exists, endorsed by the Select Committee, agency
représentatives may not be present for interviews/preliminary
testimony falling under the first category, and for good and sufficient
reason the agency may[seek to|have a representative present in the
second category subject to the approval, of course, of the Select
Committee. : .

with all information and materials that it has on the subject. There

In abuse or impropriety interviews/preliminary testimony,
the following proceduves will prevail,

(1) Witnesses wili be identified to the agency a reasonable
time prior to interviews or taking sworn testimony. This general
rule includes current employees, former employees or others who
have or have had a relationship with the agency,

(3) Whenever they are not present at interviews or the
taking of sworn statements, agency representatives will be
available for consultations, regarding the handling of special
security matters. 7

(4) Whether or not an agency kas notice of an interview
or sworn statement. the Committee will inform the agency of the
general substantive points covered as soon as possible thereafter,
unless disclosure of the substance of a particular interview would
make.discernible the identity of a confidential source, In such
cases, the Committee shall, 2 the extent feasible without under-
cutting that decision, notify the agency in general terms of the
points or, areas covered, and the fact that it has interviewed a
witness on such matters.

(5) Whenever an agency receives prior notice of a particular

interview or taking of a sworn statement, it will also be notified

NW.65360. Docld:32989606" Page 243


of the general subject areas and periods of employment in which
the Committee is primarily interested. The agency will then check
the subject's personnel history file and advise the Committee of

any exceptionally sensitive aspects of the subject's employment

ox activity which require special handling,

(6) te because detec about security of sensitive infor-
mation, a witness feels unable to give a responsive answer to a

(7) The Committee is responsible for providing special
handling of interview notes and other working notes in a manner
which will protect sensitive material. At the conclusion of the
Committee's inquiry, the Cornmittee will consult with the agencies

concerned regarding the appropriate disposition of any such notes

which have not been destroyed following the preparation-of finished
