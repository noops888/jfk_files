: 7 July 11, 1972

On June 5, 1972 a reliable source was

advised by WU, Chun (Attache, P.R.C. Embassy, Ottawa)

that the China Peoples' Friendship Association in
Peking would like to invite three or four of the
leading members of Susan WARREN's group to visit China
‘in June or July 1972 or any other time convenient to
them. WARREN apparently had no previous knowledge of
‘ this invitation. WU did not identify the individuals
who would possibly participate in the trip to China.
