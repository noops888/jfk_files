MEMORANDUM FCR THE PRESIDENT

vega

Subject: Your Meeting with President Lopez Mateos Ou

We do not expect to make any major political decisions

but want to give new emphasis to the friendly relations

which exsist between Mexiço and the United States.

These

relations are now at an äll-time high. Mexico felt it had

a real friend in President Kennedy. They feel the same

relationship exsists with you but want to be reassured.

A warm Texas handshake and abrazo when you greet Lopez Mateos

at Los Angeles would symbolize the continuance of that

relationship.

We want to stress the identity of interests of our

two countries and our ability to work out in the "spirit

of El Chamizal" any problems that may arise between us.

Despite the informal atmosphere of the visit, we

should give scrupulous attention to Mexico's extreme

sensitivity on sovereign equality and Mexico's strong

desire to avoid any appearance of subservience to the

United States

Lopez Mateos speaks for the Mexican Government

and no important decision is made without his approval.

He has followed an "independent" foreign policy but

knows that good relations with us, especially in the

economic

sphere, are essential to his country. At times

i good relations

his foreign policy has been too independent--for

example on Cuba and in commercial and cultural rela-

tions with Communist China. But when fundamental issues i

are at stake we have usually found him understanding

and willing to be helpful--controlling travel of

Castro agents, non-recognition of Red China, offering

help

on Panama.

Lopez Mateos has chosen his successor, Gustavo DIAZ

Ordaz, who will take office in December 1964 after

elections in July. Power is therefore drifting toward

Diaz Ordaz.

MAJOR POINTS OF INTEREST TO THE UNITED STATES

1: General Information and Hemisphere Relations

We desire to continue close working relations with

Mexico both within and outside the OAS and the UN.

We hope Mexico will continueto use its key political

and geographic position to help control Castro Communism.

Mexico is very sensitive about publicizing its cooperation

and we have carerully avoided any. public comment on Mexican

control measures.

Mexico has offered its assistance on Panama. Mexico

is not aware of the role of President Orlich of Costa Rica

in mediation efforts and we do not desire that this come to

Mexico's attention. We welcome Mexico's assistance within

an OAS context.

2: Red China

The coming visit of De Gaulle to Mexico and Brazil in

March has prompted speculation that these two countries

are about to recognize Red China. Lovez Mateos has given

us secret assurances,

• that he has

no intention of recognizing ked China.

We do not desire

to raise this issue, but if Lopez Mateos raises it, we

should let him know we are aware of his assurances.

3. Mexico's Role in the Alliance for Progress

Mexico's participation in the Alliance is essential

to its success. Mexico has played a leading role in IA-

ECOSOC and has named the Director General of the Bank of

Mexico as its representative to CIAP.: It has cooperated

with us in providing extensive training facilities for

Latin American technicians. We want to encourage Mexico to

make a greater contribution. Mexico is making renewed efforts

to promote private enterprise and we also want to encourage

Mexico along this line.

We should continue to cooperate

with Mexico in maintaining financial stability and promoting

economic development.

4. Disputed Tracts on Rio Grande

There remain several tracts on the Rio Grande over

which sovereignty is in dispute.

We desire to have the

International Boundary and Water Commission study these

problems and recommend a solution.

5. Control of Narcotics

cooperation in the mutual interest of both countries.

We

hope therefore that Mexico will agree to periodic meetings

of the highest law enforcement officers of the two countries.

6. Desalinization Plant at Tijuana

An appraisal report by Interior shows that this is

the most economical way to supply water to Tijuana.

are prepared to go ahead with a feasibility study if

We

Mexico desire and will share the cost.

MAJOR. POINTS LOPEZ MATEOS IS EXPECTED TO RAISE

1. Salinity Problem on Lower Colorado

The Mexican President wants a reaffirmation of

President Kennedy's commitment "to reach a permanent änd

effective solution at the earliest possible time" of the

salinity problem.

we can agree but should avoid any commit-

ment on timing. If Lopez Mateos raises the related problem

of the groundwater recovery program at Yuma, we agree that

the Boundary Commission should study the problem.

in the lower Rio Grande Valley are seriously concerned

about saline drainage discharged to the river by Mexico and

want the Boundary Commission to achieve an early solution to

this problem.

2. Bracero Program

The Mexican Government is privately seriously

disturbed about the termination of this program.

congressional oppostion to it is strong and we cannot

commit ourselves to continue the program.

into the problem to

interested.

3.

Mexico's Concern about U.S. Trade Policies

Mexico is concerned about United States restrictions

of threatened restrictions on textiles, lead, zinc and

meat and other products and United States cotton policies

which it claims hurt

Mexican cotton exports to the world

market.

We recognize that we are natural markets for

each other.

We desire to expand trade,

promote competi-

tion and develop markets.

We want to

maintain or expand the

present level of access to each other's market but we would

not be able to guarantee Mexico its present share of our

market in each commodity of a share in increased consumption.

4. Chamizal Settlement

Lopez Mateos wants to be recorded in history as the

man who returned te Mexican flag to the Chamizal. He

wants a ceremony at the Presidential level at El Paso-

Cludad Juarez before December 1964 to symbolize the Chamizal

settlement.

We should only agree to consult later in the

year on an appropriate ceremony and a possible date.
