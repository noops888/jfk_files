MEMORANDUM FCR THE PRESIDENT oe

Subject: Your Meeting with President Lopez Mateos oon

S

We do not expect to make any major political decisions
but want to give new emphasis to the friendly relations
which exsist between Mexico and the United States. These
relations are now at an all-time high. Mexico felt it had
a real friend in President Kennedy. They feel the same
relationship exsists with you but want to be reassured.

A warm Texas handshake and abrazo when you greet Lopez Mateos
at Los Angeles would symbolize the continuance of that
relationship. : et tiae

We want to stress the identity of interests of our

two countries and our ability to work out in the “spirit
of El Chamizal" any problems that may arise between us.

Despite the informal atmosphere of the visit, we

should give scrupulous attention to Mexico's extreme

sensitivity on sovereign equality and Mexico's strong
desire to avoid any appearance of subservience to. the
United States : : : eet

Lopez Mateos speaks for the Mexican Government

and no important decision is made without his approval’.
He‘has followed an "independent" foreign policy but

knows that good relations with us, especially in the
economic sphere, are essential to his country... At. times
his foreign policy has. been too independent+-for
example-on Cuba and in’ commercial and cultural rela-

tions with Communist China. But when fundamental issues 3
are at stake we have usually found him understanding

and willing to be helpful--controlling travel of

Castro agents, non-recognition of Red China, offering

help on Panama. ae

"..,. Lopez Mateos has chosen his successor, Gustavo DIAZ
Ordaz, who Will take office in December 1964 after

elections in July. Power is therefore drifting toward

Diaz Ordaz.

We ‘desire to continue close working reiations with
Mexico both within and outside the OAS and the UN. -

and geographic position to help control Castro Communism.
Mexico is ver Sensitive about publicizing its cooperation

and we have carefully avoided any public comment on Mexican
control measures. y E ,
see easures

Mexico has offered its assistance on Panama. Mexico

is not aware of the role of President Orlich of Costa Rica

in_ mediation efforts and we do not desire that this come to

Mexico's attention. We welcome Mexico's assistance within
an OAS context. 7

2s: Red China : :
The coming visit of De Gaulle to Mexico and Brazil.in
March has prompted speculation that! these two countries
are about to recognize Red China. ateos has given
us secret assurances, , that he has

to raise this issue, but if Lopez Mateos raises t, we
shou et him know we are aware of his assurances.

with us in providing extensive training facilities for
Latin’ American technicians. ' We want to encourage Mexico to

4. Disputed Tracts on Rio Grande

There remain several tracts on the Rio Grande over
which sovereignty is in dispute. We desire to have the
International Boundary and Water Commission study these
problems and recommend a solution.

5. Control of Narcotics

Mexico and the United States are cooperating in
controlling the importation of narcotics and dangerous
drugs itito the United States. We should strengthen this
cooperation in the mutual interest of both countries. We
hope therefore that Mexico will agree to periodic meetings
of the highest law eriforcement officers of the two countries.

6. Desalinization Plant at Tijuana

An appraisal report by Interior shows that this is
the most economical way to supply water to Tijuana. We
are prepared to go ahead with a feasibility study if
Mexico desire and will share the cost.

MAJOR POINTS LOPEZ MATEOS IS EXPECTED TO RAISE

1. Salinity Problem on Lower Colorado

The Mexican President wants a reaffirmation of
President Kennedy's commitment "to reach a permanent and
effective solution at the earliest possible time" of the
salinity problem. We can agree but should avoid any commit-
ment _on.timing. If Lopez Mateos raises the related problem
Of the groundwater recovery program at Yuma, we agree that
the Boundary Commission should study the problem. Farmers
in the lower Rio Grande Valley are seriously coneernéd
about saline drainage discharged to the river by Mexico and
want the Boundary Commission to achieve an early solution. to
this problem.

2. Bracero Program

The Mexican Government is privately seriously
disturbed about the termination of this program.
Congressional oppostion to it is strong and we cannot
Commit ourselves to continue the program. We are Looking
into the problem to see if anything can be done to help
Mexico. One possibility is an expanded community develop-
ment program in Mexico through private channels (P.L. 480

foodstuffs through U.S. voluntary agencies) if Mexico is
interested.

3. Mexico's Concern about U.S. Trade Policies

Mexico is concerned about United States restrictions
or threatened restrictions on textiles, lead, zinc’ and
meat and other products and United States cotton policies
which it claims hurt Mexican cotton exports to the world
market. We recognize that we are natural markets for
each other. We desire to expand trade, promote competi-
tion and develop markets. We want to maintain or expand the
present level of access to each other's market but we would
not be able to guarantee Mexico its present share of our
narket_in each commodity or a share in increased consumption.

4, Chamizal Settlement

Lopez Mateos wants to be recorded in history as the
man who returned * Se Mexican flag to the Chamizal. He
wants a ceremony gat the Presidential level at El Paso-
Ciudad Juarez before December 1964 to symbolize the Chamizal
settlement. We should only agree to consult later in the
year an an appropriate cérémony and a possible date.
