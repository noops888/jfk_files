20. (Confidential - LLM) LIAISON Called Sam Hoskinson, NSC

staff, 're Don Sanders', Senate Select Committee on Intelligence staff,

request for access to NSC documents related to the Australian investigation.

Hoskinson said he would see what could be done to speed up the NSC deter-

mination on Sanders' access in light of the interest to provide Sanders with

all information needed so that the investigation could be wound up.

21. (Confidential - LLM) LIAISON Called Don Sanders, Senate

Select Committee on Intelligence staff, and explained our efforts to assure

hat he has the remaining material in his hands no later than tomorrow

so that he can finish writing up his report on the (Australian)investigation

but suggested that he call Sam Hoskinson, NSC staff, directly (I had

previously told Hoskinson that I would do this) on the NSC documents

since we were really not in control of the situation and our role has

been to see what we could do to facilitate resolution of the problem on

the documents. Mr. Sanders was most understanding.

22. (Internal Use Only - LLM) LIAISON Tom Latimer, Staff

Director, House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, called

concerning an inquiry by Representative Jim Mattox (D., Texas) on

whether the Agency has any interest in the training of Ugandans in

Texas by Bell Helicopter. Latimer would prefer that we handle this

directly with Representative Mattox, stressing their policy of not

acting as an intermediary between the Agency and congressional inquiries.

I told Latimer I was sure we had no interest in this training but I would

check and if I had a problem I would reserve the option to get him involved.

He also said that Representative Les Aspin (D., Wis.), in light

of the publicity on the activities of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police), 29

is interested in our liaison minimization procedures" to prevent, for

23. (Unclassified - RSG) LIAISON Called Jackie Hess, Researcher,

House Select Committee on Assassinations and gave her a status report on

all actions received from the Committee.
