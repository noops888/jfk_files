| August 10, 1961 and August 16, 1961, the last interview
being under oath. During the interviews, SCHEER stated
that while in college he attended a few meetings which he
felt were run by someone who could Have been in the Labor
Youth League (LYL) and had attended one social event
which he felt was definitely sponsored by LYL, but explained
that he had gone to this affair to meet a girl. He said he
never attended a political meetings of LYL and added that
he has never been a member of the CP or any organization
cited by the Attorney General. SCHEER admitted having
read the "Communist Manifesto" frequently and studied it
as an example of ideological development.

SCHEER said under oath that he did not consider
the CP, USA to be a threat to the United States and had no
reason to believe that a person who joins the CP swears
allegiance to a foreign power or advocates the overthrow of
the United States Government. He said he believes that the
CP is not subversive because it claims to be interested in
bringing about its-program through democratic process.
SCHEER refused to discuss his trip to Cuba in 1960 and
refused to discuss his membership, activities or associations
with the Student Fair Play for Cuba Committee (SFPCC) under
protection of the First and Fifth Amendments.

G. Birth of a Child

Records of the Department of Health, Alameda
County Courthouse, Oakland, were checked on April 29, 1968
by IC ROBERT L. GIBSON and a record was found of a birth
of ‘a son named CHRISTOPHER WARREN SCHEER, born September
8, 1967 at Berkeley, California to ANNE BUTTERFIELD WEILLS
SCHEER and ROBERT SCHEER, 6468 Benvenue Avenue, Oakland,
California.

H. Marital Discord

ROBERT SCHEER has been living at his home, 6468
Benvenue Avenue, Oakland, California, since about September
7, 1968. On September 26, 1968, Mrs. ANNE SCHEER told, some
of the neighbors that she and ROBERT SCHEER were separating
because they live different kinds of lives. ANNE SCHEER
said she was moving to an apartment somewhere near the
Oakland-Berkeley border where she planned to live with a
man named TOM, not further identified, whom she expected to
marry eventually. Mrs. SCHEER was busy removing her
belongings from the residence at 6468 Benvenue Avenue,
Oakland, on September 26, 1968.

ROBERT SCHEER was at his residence, 6468 Benvenue
Avenue, Oakland, on October 19, 1968 and had his infant son
with him. He also has a new girl friend who looks like a
"hippie" who has been at this residence quite a lot in
recent weeks. It is understood that SCHEER's son has been
residing with his mother at a different location.

Mrs. JOHN G. GWILLIAM,
6480. Benvenue Avenue,
Oakland, California
October 21, 1968

Mrs. GEORGIA SWILLIAM, 6480 Benvenue Avenue, Oakland,
California, reported October. 14, 1968 that ANNE SCHEER had
been living with THOMAS HAYDEN while ROBERT SCHEER was away
on trips for "Ramparts" magazine and now appears to have
taken their child and both are residing with HAYDEN full
time at HAYDEN's apartment. {The SCHEERs reportedly had
reached a mutual agreement to get a divorce.

ROBERT and ANNE SCHEER reside at 6468 Benvenue
Avenue, Oakland, California, and most of the neighbors refuse
to associate with them. There has never been any sign of
emotion or warmth exhibited between them. When THOMAS HAYDEN
arrived in early September 1968, it became very evident that
ANNE SCHEER was very strongly attracted to him in a physical
way. ANNE is believed to have met HAYDEN in Hanoi, North
Vietnam during the summer of 1968. When ROBERT SCHEER made
trips away from home, HAYDEN would move into the SCHEER
residence. During October 1968, ANNE SCHEER indicated she
intended to seek a divorce from ROBERT SCHEER and would move
into the apartment of THOMAS HAYDEN. Beginning about
Christmas, 1968, ANNE SCHEER returned home with the SCHEER
baby. and has remained with ROBERT SCHEFR for the past month
or more. THOMAS HAYDEN has not been observed in the~company
of ANNE SCHEER or visiting the SCHEER residence in more than
one month. There are numerous visitors to the SCHEER
residence. and it would appear that several men were living
at this residence regularly in _addition to the SCHEERs.
While ANNE SCHEER was in Hanoi, ROBERT SCHEER received a
threat to his life that frightened him greatly.. He moved

NW 64954

Docld:34517445 Page 8


SF 100-46 832
WEH :4

out of the house immediately and hired a private investigator
who moved into the house “armed to the teeth". It appears
that ROBERT SCHEER has been somewhat frightened ever since
this threat.

SF T-6
January 16, 1969

THOMAS EMMET HAYDEN was the original
organizer of the Students for a
Democratic Society (SDS) and, according
to the "New York Daily News" of January.
10, 1968, was one of a party of three
who travelled to North Vietnam in
defiance of US Department of State ban
on such travel, ™.

A characterization of the
SDS is. contained in the

MRAMPARTSY - MAGAZINE:

"Pamparts" in a letter to subscribers dated

May 1, 1968, announced that beginning June 1,
1968, it would be published biweekly at a

yearly. subscription price of $15. In this

letter "Ramparts" described itself as follows:
"\..the first national. publication to consis-
tently reveal the ribbon of lies supporting
America's involvement in Vietnam; we stripped
the curtain from America's ‘invisible. government!
by exposing CIA's unlicensed intrusion into our
domestic lives; we dared to write about the
applications of the Catholic Church's political
power; we warned, vears before the Kerner
report, that white racism was the base of
America's racial problems; we blasted away at

the corroded institutions of Cold War liberalism.
" 'Ramparts' is now the largest left-of-center
commercial magazine in the history of the United
States..."

I. Burning of Draft Card

The. cover of the December 1967 issue of "Ramparts"
magazine contains a photograph of four right hands. each
holding. a burning Selective Service card. One of the. cards
is a duplicate issued December 3, 1958 of the "Selective
Service Registration Certificate" for ROBERT SCHEER, 653
Britton Street, New York 67, Bronx.

The San Francisco "Examiner," daily newspaper
published in San Francisco, California, in its issue of
November 16, 1967, carried an article headlined "Ramparts
Editors Burn Draft Cards" which quoted "Publisher MARC
STONE" of "Ramparts" as saying the magazine cover is'a

-very serious editorial statement," adding "there is a very.

serious political crisis in this country and we want to
show that the bureaucracy of the Selective Service System
is unfair."

The San Francisco "Examiner" daily newspaper,
issue of June 13, 1968, carried a news article "3 Ramparts
Officers Before Jury in NY." This article stated that three
top officers of "Ramparts" magazine were called to appear
before a Federal Grand Jury in New York City, June 13, 1968
to testify at an inquiry described only as "having to do with
Selective Service." The article continued by stating that
there was speculation that the investigation dealt with the
cover photograph of the December 1967 issue of "Ramparts"
which pictured the flaming draft cards of 3 top officials.
(Should be four officials.) ~

The August 24, 1968 issue of "Ramparts" magazine
earried a column entitled, "Apologia," which carried a.
reprint of a news article from the "New York Times" news-
paper, issue of July 18, 1968. The article stated that
WARREN HINCKLE, III, ROBERT SCHEER, DUGALD STERMER, and
SOL STEIN, all officials of "Ramparts", appeared before a
Grand Jury in New York City on June 17, 1968, as a result
of the December 1967 cover of "Ramparts" containing a photo-
graph of four hands holding burning draft cards containing
the names of these four men.

J. Threat to Subject's Life

ROBERT SCHEER telephoned the San Francisco FBI
Office on July 8, 1968, to state the receptionist at
"Ramparts" magazine, San Francisco, received the following
telephone message from an anonymous male at 4:45 pm that
day:

"I just want to inform you that we
plan to destroy the Managing Editor,
BOB SCHEER, tomorrow night at 9:00."

SCHEER stated that the New York City Office of
"Ramparts" had received a threat about July 3, 1968 and
he felt that this call resulted from a recent article in
"Ramparts" regarding Cuban refugees. He said he had no
indication that the call was interstate.

The San Francisco "Examiner" newspaper, San
Francisco, California, in its issue of July 9, 1968,
earried a news article headlined, "Ramparts Threatened 7
By Bombs." The article stated that both the San Francisco bs
and New York City offices of "Ramparts" had been threatened
by bombs and "Associate Editor ROBERT SCHEER had received
ealls threatening his life."

SCHEER advised SA CHARLES E. GALVIN on July 10,
1968, that no one had carried out the threat and that
he would immediately contact the FBI if any future threats
were made. .

Records of the Bureau of Criminal Identification
and Investigation (CII), Sacramento, California, reveal
that a .25 calibre Beretta automatic pistol, serial number
415984, was sold to ROBERT SCHEER, 6468 Benvenue Avenue,
Oakland, California, on January 27, 1968, and that this gun
was purchased in Oakland.

Records of the Oakland Police Department were
searched October 17, 1968 by IC ROBERT L. GIBSON and it
was determined that ROBERT SCHEER did not possess a permit
to carry a gun.

L. Passport Information

Files of the Passport Office, US Department of
State, Washington, D. C., were reviewed by SA DOUGLAS M.
BROWN. on January 26, 1968 and reflected the following.

On January 28, 1966, Passport number G 41559 was
issued at the San Francisco Passport Agency to ROBERT SCHEER,
based on his application, January 27, 1966.. SCHEER stated
he was born April 4, 1936 at Bronx, New York, was a writer
by occupation, residing a& 228 Milvia Street, Berkeley,
Californa.

His last passport, number D 163804, was issued
February 5, 1963. It was cancelled and returned to SCHEER
when the above application was submitted. His parents
were identified as FRED SCHEER, born in Germany, May 5,
1898, and IDA KURAN, born in Russia, April 24, 1900. His
father was a United States citizen, but his mother was not
a citizen. He was last married in 1965 to ANNE BUTTERFIELD
WEILLS, born Eureka, California, March 14, 1942. She was
designated as the person to be notified in an emergency at
the above address. SCHEER stated in the application that he
planned to depart San Francisco via Japan Airlines for a trip
of one month to Japan, Cambodia and Hong Kong for journalistic
purposes.

On November 29, 1967, SCHEER wrote a letter on
the letterhead of "Ramparts" magazine and signed the letter
as Managing Editor.of that publication, which he sent to the
Visa Department, US Department of State, Washington, D. C.,
stating he had been invited to attend a cultural conference
in Havana, Cuba, in January 1968, by the Cuban Commission to

the United Nations. He stated he found it necessary in his
position to accept this invitation and requested a visa for
this purpose.

The Department of State advised SCHEER by letter
dated December 18, 1967 that provided he would execute the
enclosed affidavit stating that he desired to attend the

‘conference as a professional reporter and would not par-

ticipate in the conference in any manner, his application
would appear to qualify under existing regulations.

On December 20, 1967, SCHEER returned the affidavit
which was executed on that date before a notary public in
San Francisco. On December 27, 1967, the San Francisco
Passport Office was authorized by the State Department to
validate SCHEER's passport for’ one Pound trip to Cuba.
The State Department files reflect that the passport was
so validated at San Francisco on December 29, 1967.

Miss MADELINE EBINGER, Clerk, Passport Office,
US Department of State, 450 Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco,
advised March 20, 1968 that her office received authoriza-
tion from the State Department, Washington, D. C. on March
19, 1968 to validate the passport of ROBERT SCHEER, DUGALD
STERMER and FREDERICK C. MITCHELL, all of "Ramparts" magazine
for one round trip to Cuba, each for journalistic purposes.
STERMER is art director of "Ramparts" magazine and MITCHELL
a senior editor of "Ramparts". Miss EBINGER expected SCHEER
to appear in the immediate future for this validation since
she stated he has been telephoning the passport office
daily for the past week to determine if the validation of his
passport had been authorized.

On April 16, 1968, ROBERT SCHEER was observed by
a Special Agent of the FBI to visit the Passport Office of
the State Department in San Francisco, where he had his
passport validated for one round trip to Cuba. This was
confirmed by MADELINE EBINGER the same day.

Mrs. DOROTHY GIBBS, Passport Office, US Department
of State (USDS), Washington, D. C., stated on August 29,

1968 to SE ROBERT P. LYNCH that the State Department wired
the San Francisco Passport Agency instructing, "You are
authorzied to validate passport G 041559, issued to ROBERT
SCHEER of ‘Ramparts} valid for one round trip to Cuba."

Miss MADELINE EBINGER advised on September 18, 1968
that records of that office reflect that the passport of
ROBERT SCHEER was validated for one round trip to Cuba on
August 22, 1968. She said she recalled that an unknown man
appeared at the Passport Office a few minutes before
closing time on August 22, 1968 and insisted that the
passport be validated that evening since ROBERT SCHEER intended
to depart that evening.

Vietnam and stated that it was a problem for the Vietnamese
people to decide. SCHEER stated that the United States
rationalized its killing of Vietnamese civilians by saying
that the Viet Cong commit horrible atrocities. SCHEER

said that although the Viet Cong may kill some civilians,

the United States Government's statements on their atrocities
are, on the whole, a lie.

pointing out that Congressman JEFFREY COHELAN had failed
to take a stand in opposition to United States participation
in the war in Vietnam, and enclosed cards addressed to
Congressman COHELAN appealing to COHELAN to speak out

negotiations through the United Nations. The cards also
stated that unless COHELAN took such action, he would be
opposed for re-election. By August 1965, there had been
750. cards processed and returned to Dr. SIMON. When
Congressman COHELAN failed to speak out in Congress opposing
US involvement in Vietnam, certain people began searching
for .a candidate to oppose him. ROBERT SCHEER agreed to
Oppose COHELAN. Some of hi. supporters left the organization
because SCHEER refused to shave off his beard and others
left the organization because SCHEER refused to exclude Communists fro
-his campaign committee. ‘The article stated ROBERT SCHEER
had the .endorsement of the VDC as well as a sizeable portion
of the community, and was not centered among the college
students.

In early 1966, two functionaries of the CP discussed

quoted SCHEER as stating “From now on I'm the shadow Congressman
in this District." He added that he would be a write-in candidate
for U. S. Congressman in the November, 1966 election unless
Congressman JEFFREY COHELAN stopped supporting the Vietnam war
and unless COHELAN faced up to the serious social problems
in the U. S. SCHEER added that. he and his backers were *building
a political movement in this District and this campaign was
only the opening wedge."

During the interview; SCHEER said the cost of running
his campaign had been $35,000 to $40,000, most of it being -
donated by "students, housewives, longshoremen and what-have-you,"
and none of it coming from his own pocket. He said, "When I
started this campaign I didn't have a dime."

article it was stated "Author ROBERT SCHEER announced last
week he was withdrawing from contention, although some
political observers say he may be courting a possible draft

run for the US Senate on the PFP ticket. SCHEER was quoted
as saying, "I can be more helpful without being a candidate.

I want to work hard for PFP without being accused of. doing
it for personal advantage.

"I will.also be free of the petty in- -fighting that
goes on too much in PFP. I am talking about PFP in Berkeley.

SCHEER was also quoted as being critical of his
critics in the 1966 Congressional campaign as follows:

"Without those 1966 peace campaigns, there wonld
be no PFP today. In this area, my campaign gave rise
to CNP (Community for New Politics) and CNP formed the
base for PFP here. I made the motion in a CNP meeting
to form PFP. 7 :

"That Congressicnal campaign did give rise to

"Our campaign was founded on assump-
tions which are at odds with mainstream
American polities. We are concerned with
issues and not personalities.

"We were committed to development of
community dialogue and involvement and not
merely to electoral victory. The fact
that we obtained an unexpectedly large vote
does not change this commitment but rather
reinforces it. 'The Community for New
Politics’ was formed to carry out this
commitment. “We are, in fact, in a very
favorable position to implement a’ 'new

community. ties and the beginnings of a
serious program. If we succeed in new
politics it will serve as a much needed model
for American political life. If we fail
to seriously attempt it we betray not
only the larger community but our most
significant hopes as well.

"This will be a more difficult periad

I. Peace and Freddom Party and

Black Panther Party

The "San Francisco Examiner," a daily newspaper
published at San Francisco, California, in its issue of
October 3, 1967, carried a news article headlined “New
Peace Party's Aim - Beat LBJ.“ The article explained that
"the newly formed Peace and Freedom Party is out to beat
President Johnson in 1968 even at the expense of electing
his Republican opponent."

The article continued by saying that the new
Peace and Freedom Party was recertly formed in an effort
to promote peace candidates and had initiated a drive for
the 67,000 signatures needed to put a Peace and Freedom
Party candidate on the ballot. ROBERT SCHEER was listed as
one of the founders of the Peace and Freedom Party.

The "Berkeley Barb," a weekly newspaper of the
left, published at Berkeley, California, in its issue of
March 15-21, 1968, carried an article headlined, "Differs
but Will Fight for Party." This article explained that
ROBERT SCHEER's decision to withdraw as a Peace and Freedom
Party (PFP) candidate for nomination as U.S. Senator, was
based primarily on differences with the PFP leadership
over how to conduct the campaign. SCHEER was quoted as

saying, "I think it is possible to conduct a radical campaign

and at the same time reach out to bring people in. I don't
agree that there is a conflict between educating people and
running a principled campaign. There are purists in PFP who
will be talking only to small meetings of convinced people.
Some of the purists seem to want a small, left wing,
vegetarian-type party." SCHEER also objected to being asked
for loyalty to the PFP program before it had been adopted.

SCHEER said he expects to campaign very actively for PFP, but
stated his position with "Ramparts" Magazine also ereates demands

on his time.

The article added that SCHEER said he wanted to
work hard for PFP without being accused of doing it for
personal advantage. SCHEER also said he wanted to be free

of the petty in-fighting that goes on too much in the Berkeley PFP.

SCHEER also claimed that his unsuccessful campaign for
nomination as U. S. Congressman from the 7th Congressional
District of California gave rise to the Community for New

for his leadership in anti-draft activities. The article

lined "Scheer supports Newton." This article stated "Bob
S¢Ch&SE endorsed Huey Newton for Congress last week." It
quoted Scheer as saying, "I.ran against Cohelan in 1966
because the assumptions that he shared with the democratic
establishment and the powerful interests behind it led him
to support the war in Vietnam and to ignore the increasingly
desperate crisis in our cities, including the miserable conditions
right here in Oakland."

The article pointed out that HUEY P.: NEWTON was
running against JEFFREY COHELAN as the PFP candidate in the
California 7th Congressional District, COHELAN being the Democratic
Party candidate and the incumbent. The article continued by
quoting ROBERT SCHEER as saying, "I have come to know and

America must pull out of Vietnam because it is
essentially wrong. The dominant political institutions are
responsible for the U. S. involvement in Vietnam. We must
reject the emotion of racial evil by studying the war in
Vietnam. America is fundamentally racist and must come to
grips with itself about racism. Relations are unwholesome between
white radicals and black panthers. The Panthers are becoming
better organized and can reach more people than white people
can reach. The Panthers wrote a book to obtain money with
which to purchase guns.

At the same meeting, GEORGE MURRAY, Minister of

III FOREIGN TRAVEL

Trip to Indonesia, February, 1965

An American by the name of SHEA (phonetic),
who claims that he is an ex-professor of a California
University, visited Japan about February 11, 1965. He
went to visit the office of the National Harbor and Ports
Labor Union in Tokyo. The Japan labor union put up SHEA
in one of their dormitories and had him live there until
three days ago, when he left Japan and went to Indonesia
on a ten-day trip. Before he left Japan for Indonesia,
he claimed that he strongly desired to go to Communist
China. He was complaining to the Japanese labor union
officials about the discrimination problem in the U. S.
and made derogatory remarks about the U.S. The Japanese
labor union official, after listening to his desire to go
to Communist China, asked the Chinese Communists now staying
in Tokyo about the possibility of SHEA's trip to the Chinese
mainland. The Chinese did not give a decisive answer. Although
SHEA is expected to return to Japan after his trip from Indo-
nesia, he may go to China directly from Indonesia. It is
said that SHEA had to quit his university job due to an
article he wrote after he came back from a trip to Cuba.
The article contained some derogatory remarks about the

taken to Cambodia, which he described as "one of the few
neutral governments in the world, very jealous of its
prerogatives." SCHEER said he visited Cambodia at the
invitation of its government and was sent there by "Ramparts"
Magazine, of which he is Foreign Editor. He said he was
accompanied by STANLEY SCHEINBAUM, "an adviser to the Diem
Government in Vietnam from 1955 to 1961." SCHEER asserted
that after exploring the entire frontier between Cambodia

and South Vietnam, he concluded that “Cambodia was not being
used in any significant way, to support the fighting in South
Vietnam." He explained that by any significant way he meant
that Cambodia was not a "major staging area for the Viet Cong."

A CP contact class was held February 4, 1966, at

The "San Francisco Examiner" newspaper, issue of

“Ramparts Editor at Prague Meet" by CARL ROWAN. This article
explained that “a few days ago a brief, cryptic report out of
Prague, Czechoslovakia, was passed among a handful of top officials

in Washington." The wport said that an editor of “Ramparts”
magazine had visited Prague and held “a long, secret session”
with officers of the Communist controlled International Union
of Students (I8S).

The article continued by stating that "Ramparts"
is the magazine that exposed the fact that the Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) had been financing the National
Student Association (NSA), which in turn had worked for
several years to prevent IUS from dominating the youth of the
world. The article questioned what relationship there was
between "Ramparts" and the IUS.

ROWAN telephoned ROBERT SCHEER, Managing Editor of

"Ramparts" in San Francisco and SCHEER admitted that he had

met with representatives of the National Liberation Front,
political arm of the Communist Viet Cong, in South Vietnam,
“and also with IUS officers in Prague "several weeks ago"

for two days. In response to a question as to who controlled
IUS, SCHEER replied, "It is essentially an organ of the

foreign policy of the Soviet Union." SCHEER emphasized

that he had visited IUS headquarters strictly for journalistic
reasons and that he was in Europe writing a story for "Ramparts"
on Bertrand Russell, "(94 year old British philosopher who
plans a Vietnam 'war crimes trial' of President Johnson)", so
he continued on to Prague to check the international implications
of the "Ramparts" article on the NSA. SCHEER volunteered, "We
don't truck with Communism in Ramparts. We cempare the U.S.
position in Vietnam with the actions of the Soviet Union in
Hungary. _Both are intolerable and:we make no-bones about it.
Any attempt to smear us at Ramparts is libelous and we'll sue.

I warned the same thing when they were muttering about me ‘
being a Communist when I ran for Congress."

ROBERT SCHEER traveled to Prague, Czechoslovakia
during the first week of February, 1967, to contact the Inter-
national Union of Students (IUS)and was an official guest of
the Czechoslovakian Government with his lodging being furnished
at the best hotel in Prague. SCHEER requested and received

This editorial described SCHEER as Managing Editor of
“Ramparts” magazine and an unsuccessful candidate in the
primary election of 1966.

The editorial stated SCHEER had recently returned
from a trip to Cairo and Israel and then spoke at a meeting
in Berkeley, California, August 25, 1967, when he told his
audience about his trip. In his speech, SCHEER claimed he had
been accused of being an anti-Semite and an anti-Arab because
of what he said on the matter of Arab-Israel relations, The
editorial said that SCHEER referred constantly to the people
of Israel and the American Jews as the "Zionists" and uses
this term constantly when criticizing action of the Israelis,

The editorial continued by stating that SCHEER
accused the Zionists of being imperialistic, of being excess-
ively hard on the poor Arabs they defeated, of provoking the
war - in short, of doing everything the Arabs and the Soviets
accused them of and SCHEER attributed these lies to Israel's
subservience to the United States." In his speech, SCHEER
was further accused of using the term, "American Grand Concourse
Zionists," the “Anti-Semites favorite euphemism for Jew."

ROBERT SCHEER is the author of a pamphlet written
for the Center for the Study 6f Democratic Institutions,
which he later condensed into an article for "Ramparts"

to show how various Americans worked to misinform the public
about Vietnam. The persons whom SCHEER holds responsible

A feature article datelined Cairo, July 31,
1967, entitled, "Egypt" which is described as "A Special
Report from Managing Fditor ROBERT SCHEER in Cairo", was
published in the September 1967. issue of "Ramparts"
magazine. In this article, SCHEER tried to explain the
current situation in Egypt. He laid the blame for the Arabs
losing the six-day war to the Israelis on "cowardly
or traitorous officers" in the Arab. Army.

‘The article also stated that many in the NASSER
Goverment say that most of the blame for starting the
Arab-Israel war should be charged to the Syrians for
having provided the Israelis with a pretext for attack.
The article stated the Egyptian people were not at this

time in a warlike mood and NASSER was doing his best
to discourage his people from warlike aspirations and
to encourage continuance of the Social Fevolution in
Egypt.

SCHEER concluded that "ASSER must break with L
the rightists in the Arab world and make his primary
commitment to the Arab social revolution in order to
survive. He concluded also that NASSER's most dangerous
enemy is the "Moslem Brotherhood" who could take control
of Egypt’ and become embroiled in another war in as little
as one year's time.

The November 1967 issue of "Ramparts" magazine
contains a 13-page article entitled, "A NASSER
Thesis" by ROBERT SCHEEP. . In this article, SCHEER
analyzes the Middle East situation from 1952 to the
present, giving his recital of the velationship of the
various countries to each other, the rise to power by
GAMAL ABDUL NASSEP, the Suez war in the middle 1950's,
and the six-day Arab-Israel war in June, 1967.

The article lays great stress on NASSEF being
unsuccessful in some of his ventures because while he
nationalized many businesses and industries and distributed
the proceeds to the poor, he allowed the Army to remain
an elite, privileged class which was not loyal to either
NASSER or Egypt. SCHEER also blamed NASSER's failure
to develop a political party with its own aims set forth
for his lack of success in communicating with his people
and obtaining their full support.

("Ramparts", November, 1967) include BOB AVAKIAN, JIM HAWLEY,
DAVID KOLODNEY and JOHN SPITZER." ‘ ’

The article states the thesis that the Middle East
is “of paramount strategic importance to this Country”. because
the Persian Gulf. produces 27% of the world's petroleum and has
proved global reserves of 60%. In addition the Mideast. is. the
trade crossroads between Asia and Europe and an important cultural
bridge between Africa and Asia and the center of the Islam world.

The article explains that 27% of the oil used through-
cout the world comes from the Middle East and, since oil is in-
dispensable to industrial and military potential it is no wonder
that continued control of this resource is a major focus of the
Nestern. powers. It adds that if control of this oil is important
to the West it is absolutely critical to the Arabs, since it is
the only source of the cash needed to break out of the cycle of
underdevelopment and poverty in which their countries are trapped.
It pointed out that the profits from the oil go to the “wrong”
states, those with the least population .(12% of the Arab population)
and therefore the least need. The article stated. the Arabs could
repay, the total investment of Yestern powers of $5 billion in
two years with the oil removed from Arab wells except for the
fact that Western Countries are ina position. to force the Arabs
to deal with them or to have no market. whatever for “this uli.
The article cited how Iranian Prime Minister MOSSADEGH nationaliz-
ed his country's oil production May 1, 1951 and the U. S. pro-
ceeded to crush him so totally that the example has served as 3
chilling model for other would-be nationalists - no major oil
poducing country in the Mideast has dared to repeat MOSSADEGH's
attempt." The Western Powers were said to have accomplished
this by imposing a total boycott of Iranian oil.

The article explained that the Baghdad Pact was an in-
tegral part of a global containment policy which was put’ into
effect by the U.S. in the early 1950s but SSER refused to a-
lien himself with it. NASSER was caid to be a threat to the
Western powers by being consciously and arrogantly expansionist ,

and by holding the position that oil in the underpopulated oil
producing countries must be the basis of the development of the
entire region. It stated that the U.S. response to NASSER was
principally by propping up the economy and military machines of

the monarchies while alternately mollifying through grants or the
withholding of grants to the more leftist tendencies as they appear-
ed in Egypt and other Arab regimes. The article added “Intensive
CIA operations even involved founding the American Friznds of the
Middle East -.a-pro-Arab Organization in the U.S. - as well as
widespread. meddling in internal Arab politics."

The article continued that Soviet support of the Arabs

began in 1955, which caused the U. S. to be more careful not to i
cause an anti-Western Arab union to be formed that might topple
America's right-wing Arab allies. NASSER was said to have steered
clear of any major direct confrontation with the U.S. and "the U.S.
has never attempted. to really clamp down on him." Thus the Arab
revolutionary impulse, fearful of challenging the West, turned to
‘challenging Israel as a Western tool" and condemned "Israeli im-
‘perialism.". This hostility to Israel provided a kind of anti-
imperialism that was able to appeal to both progressive leftists

and traditional monarchies in the Arab world. In 1956 Israel

joined the British and French attempt to reestablish by force
Western control over the Suez Canal after NASSER nationalized it,
and Israel also supported the French in the Algerian war. To ‘the
Arabs it seemed that Israel had aligned herself with the exploiters.
This signalled the Russians to begin helpins the Arabs to get as
many friends as possible amorg the non-aligned. countries even while
local communists in Egypt, Algeria and Syria were beine jaiiud.R
feit that the Arabs were moving to the left to justify Pus n

support.

The article said the social changesin Algeria and Egypt
were Significant but also inadequate because “they destroyed the
power of the traditional upper class without.in anv significant sense
passing power on to that very broad base of the Arab pyramid. The
reforms in Syria and Egypt came about. as a result of military coups
dietet which placed men in power who were willing to introduce re-

orms.

The article continued by. stating "The identification of
Israel-vather than the oil companies and their monarchies-as the
serious extension of imperialism has allowed Arab progressives to
play at revolution, through periodic anti-Israel tirades, without

taking essential revolutionary action." In reference to the

six day Arab-Israel war the article stated “the Soviets were clearly
unprepared to assess its implications," in reference to with-

drawal of UN troops from Gaza and Aqoba. It added "The Soviets
continuously underestimated the emotional depth and political
intensity of the Arab-Israeli conflict.” It added that Russia
began immediately to rearm Eghpt and Syria after the defeat,
specifying only that their weapons be better used.

The article stated "The Central Thesis of this. essay
is that the Great Powers cannot be expected to be concerned, on any
consistent basis, with the interests and needs of the Arabs and
Jews who live in the Mideast,” but are preoccupied with their
own prestige and security needs. It added that both the Arabs and
the Jews identify their opposition with the nation of iaperialism
supported by the American oil companies.

The article added that “The Arab denial of legitimate
Jewish nationhood as the basis of Israel is the subject of deserved
ridicule. But that the mainstream of Zionism hes, in like fashion,
denied the existence of a legitimate Arab quest for nationhood is
not commonly admitted. This factor has been of great significance
in the formation and sustaining of Arab hostility towards. Israel.
The Arabs will never be able to turn their energies from opposing
Israel to the development of an Arab nation so long as the Israelis
hold the existence of an Arab nation to be a threat.". The Israelis
viewed the drive toward Arab unity and independence as a threat
to them. ABBA EBAN. conferred upon Israel the very nationhood that
Israel denied to the Arabs. The Arabs find this position most
difficult to accept when the Jews deny them the same positicn.
The article stated thut “7sraelis must come to accept the fact that
nationhood is an aspiration which. some Arabs hold without beinz
conned into it by NASSER; and that an Arab State - if it became a
reality (as a confederation or a nation) - is not necessarily a
threat to Israel." S

The article concluded that "The Arab Nation and the
Jewish Nation are both legitimate concepts which can survive to-
gether only if they exist as part of the same social revolution
to meet the needs of the people of the Mideast."

ROBERT SCHEER had delivered a speech at the Raymond College
High Table, University of the Pacific, Stockton, California,
on September 7, 1966. SCHEER maintained that the concept
of an international communist conspiracy was false and the
U. S. is mistaken in considering it a unified, ever-growing
force that. can only be contained by force. He stated that
the communist conspiracy is a movement that does not hold
together because of nationalistic interests. He cited
the Sino-Soviet dispute and the international squabbling
between satellite countries and the major communist powers.
He said the Vietnam conflict began as an internal dispute
and if the U. S. withdrew from the conflict this. withdrawal
would reaffirm the communists' confidence in the possibility
of peaceful co-existence.

He concluded. that if anyone is genuinely concerned
about American security, he is going to have to work to
reverse American foreign policy.

a meeting December 2, 1966, in the auditorium of Los Angeles
Trade College, 700 block, Washington Boulevard, Los Angeles,
with from 1,000 to 1,500 people in attendance. The topic of
the discussion was "What Will the New Development on the Left
Be?" ROBERT SCHEER from "Ramparts" magazine, EUGENE GENOVESE

. from Rutgers College in New Jersey, and DOROTHY HEALEY from

Southern California District CP were the speakers. HEALEY

spoke first, stating that the most important things for the
groups on the left to do today were to unite on common grounds
and to be critical on grounds where they cannot agree, as well
as to give allegiance to the other 14 socialist countries in
the world. She described these countries as the hope of the
future. ROBERT SCHEER attacked her bitterly, his main contention
being that he felt he could not even say he was a socialist

“because of all-the crimes that are committed in the name of

socialism. He said he could not align himself with other
countries in the socialist world because of the barbaric
deeds committed by some of these countries.

He led a vicious attack against the Soviet Union,
against the STALIN era, against the crimes that were committed
in the Soviet Union against Jewish people and Jewish culture,
and against other religious people and intellectuals in the
Soviet Union. He made reference to the two writers who had
been recently jailed in Russia. In a rebuttal and question
and answer period the attack went back and forth, mainly
between GENOVESE and HEALEY against SCHEER for his anti-Soviet
Union position. SCHEER constantly brought up Hungary, stating
that the oppression that went on in Hungary is no different
than the oppression of the Untted States in Vietnam. He also
said the Soviet Union is a sick society just as the U. S. is
a sick society, and he is quite sure that the workers in each
society are not much aware of or care about the relative
difference of the sickness.

than rebellion,' he said,’ ‘but I am intérested in
what a revolution will lead to....Soviet society is
vicious....I want a revolution that means the. right
of a man to control his own life.’

“Referring to Marxism, Scheer said, 'The theories
don't work. The working class is not getting poorer
and poorer.

"'It is true,’ he said, 'that the 'New Left! ;
has no ideology, (but. because of that) it does not
follow that it should accept the old ones...Why is
there a New Left?

"'The old Left was tired, cynical, frightened...
LSD is more important than (considered by the 'Old

"‘Anti-Communism is what holds thé American people
together, not the Judaeo-Christian ethic,‘ radical
author Robert Scheer told 500 people in the Social
Science building Thursday.

"He argued that the United States is attempting
to impose on the Southeast Asian crisis the 'myth!
of a monolithic Communism and the, policy of 'contain-
ment' that developed out of the post-World War II
Eastern European situation 20 years ago.

“He said that America has become 'so imbued
with the anti-Communist mythology’ that it has become
the over-riding criteria for all, and especially
foreign policy decision-making. _ |

“He cited the investigations of philosopher
Bertrand Russell's Vietnam ‘War Crimes Tribunal‘
which purports to show American use of 'fragmentation
bombs! that are not effective militarily, bu: which
demoralize the population. 'And these bombs. are
designed not’ so much to kill as to torture.'

"'What is frighteningly horrible about this whole
policy,' he said, ‘is that it works. It succeeds
militarily even where it fails politically.'

“He urged his listeners to 'support the Vietcong,
or National Liberation Front...given the fact that
. they are the only ones standing up to the American
'intrusion". over there.'

“He said that it is not the North Vietnamese
who have shown ‘bad faith' in efforts to negotiate,
‘but us.' They have already offered concessions, ~
he said, ‘even though it is we who are bombing them."

“Russian and Chinese foreign policies, before
and after the death of Stalin, he said, 'have been
essentially conservative, and not aggressive.’ He
cited as evidence the Trotsky-Stalin conflict and
Mao Tse-tung's early differences with the regular
Chinese Communist Party apparatus over this issue.”

they could always blame CIA for their failures.

then spoke of a trip he had taken to France and Belgium. He
said he had talked to important officials in these countries
and gained the impression that these officials were opposed to
.the war policy of President JOHNSON, particularly the bombing
of North Vietnam.. SCHEER alleged that there were more bombs
dropped in Vietnam than were dropped during World War II. He
¢@laimed that the reason the U. S. was using anti-personnel bombs
against the people of North Vietnam was because they did not
agree with the U. S. and the use of anti-personnel bomb was of

The "Daily Utah Chronicle," issue of October 18,

was looking into the possibility of bringing a libel suit
against the "Daily Utah Chronicle" for using slanderous misquotes
attributed to him in the coverage in the Spectrum Vietnam,
October 7, 1967. This article explained that the night editor
of this paper rewrote the story at a time when he could not

the arrogant American myth that "we are always g 20d guys
fighting on, the side with angels with amonopoly on deinocracy,
peace and freedom."

The article said "he contended the mood of communism
is now nationalism, not world expansion and that the Communists
are now more concerned with internal problems than presenting
a united front to defeat democracy." The article added "Mr.
Scheer and Mr. Oglesby charged that the U.S. is supporting the
wrong side in Vietnam because of its economic interest... The
real issue in Vietnam and other troubled areas of the world is
poverty, according to Scheer and Oglesby."

is only the extension. of this unhealthy American character-
istic, not an isolated example of mistaken policy. It is
an integral part of a policy of corrupt self-seeking
deception." After explaining that LOBERT SCHEER ‘visited
South Vietnam twice, the article quoted SCHEER as saying,
"I think we have to realize that the Vietnamese are indeed
fighting for their freedom - but their freedom from us.
They are nationalists trying to create a national revolution,
and they can't be explained away with a: label.”

SCHEER alleged that the United States was in
the Vietnam war to make a profit. He called for staged
withdrawal of U.S. troops over a period of years.

In reference to the domestic scene, SCHFFF warned
that sterner msasures against dissent were coming and that
President JOHNSON's talk about peace was a "con job."
SCHEER said people were rioting in America because "they
have no legitimate avenue of dissent." In summary, SCHEEP.
urged concerned youth not to become complacent but to
remain aware of the problems and refuse to conspire with
liberal politicians who try to make dissent irrelevant
SCHERF told the group, "Block the hills and block the
airports. This may be one of the times when to behave
reasonably is to behave irresponsibly."

The "Seattle Post Intelligencer". newspaper, Seattle,
Washington, in its issue of November 22, 1967, reported that
ROBERT SCHEER spoke to an overflow audience at the University
of ashington, Hub Auditorium, November 21, 1967. The article
stated that SCHEER said it was arrogant for Americans to
decide what is best for the Vietnam people. SCHEER said
it-was an “obscene argument that withdrawal of American
forces from Vietnam would result in a blood bath. He

claimed the United States was operating on a war economy
and suggested that our loss of pre-eminence in world
trade as well as in jobs which rely on military contracts
accounts for much of our reluctance to pull out of Asia.
SCHEER predicted that 1968 may be the "last democratic
election" for this nation. He predicted that the far
left and the far right would grow as Americans seek
alternatives. SCHEER advocated taking the billions spent
on the Vietnam war and applying them to domestic problems.
He alleged that unless this is done, there would be more
violence and more riots in American cities.

Center Ballroom before a crowd of 250, The article stated

Vietnam and not worry about the fate of that country.

In speaking about the means of demonstration, SCHEB? was
quoted as saying "Use your bodies imaginatively. Block
railway tracks and government buildings. Violence is the
only serious alternative." “ith regard to opposition to
the war, SCHEER blamed the rowdy character of recent
demonstrations which have been blocked by the economic
and. political. power structure. Ye said "I support these
tactics out of desperation, though I would like to see

the growth of a serious left to challenge the people in

involved in a type of debate with “ILLIAM F. BUCKLEY,

the un-American attitude of SCHEER and.also of "Ramparts"

the exact topic but.in any case could not speak for
"Ramparts" since he is only one member of the editorial
board. SCHEER then became evasive,~claiming he wanted
a definition of "un-American" before he could answer
BUCKLEY. During this show, SCNEEP stated that "National
Review" Magazine had maligned SCHEER when it stated he
traveled to Cuba in violation of State Department vegu-
lations and SCHEER requested a retraction be printed.
SCHEER did not state that he had traveled to CUBA illegally
in 1960 and legally in 1968, but such is the case. SCHEER
was very glib but was very evasive in answering BUCKLEY! 3

Television, February 23,.1968

ROBERT SCHEER was interviewed by BRANT FRAYNE
and PAUL SALTZMAN at the Expo '67 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada,
in June, 1967, and the results of this interview were shown
on Canadian Broadcasting Company television network on, February
23, 1968. Some of the points emphasized by SCHEER. in this inter-
view are as follows:

"Ramparts" magazine, of which SCHEER is Editor, tries
“o be exciting and to fill a void in American life. It tries
to handle the stories the other magazines do not have the guts
to handle and to give some diversity of opinion in the mass media
of America. It isan experiment in seeing whether American
freedom and democracy really works. Other magazines are locked
into the establishment because of the funding required to start a
magazine and the income received from advertisers, while "Ramparts"
_is probably the only large circulation magazine in America that
does not depend on advertising.

"Ramparts" made a decision to challenge the big
magazines and to turn to a secular monthly magazine two anda
half years ago (about January, 1965) and it no longer has any
eonnection with or particular interest in the Catholic Church.
It is aimed a challenging the establishment and its readers >»
who are primarily in the 15 to 40 year age group.

“Ramparts" has been called a muckraker and
left-wing. It is on the left of the political spectrum since
it opposes the war in Vietnam and is interested in removing the
ghettos in American life. "Ramperts" is based as a left-wing
opposition to "Time" magazine but "Time" is biased toward the
establishment and toward maintaining the status quo. ."Ramparts"
has never been sued for libel or had a serious challenge to its
factual accuracy. "Ramparts" has a small staff of only 30 and
has. successfully challenged the other big magazines with exten-
sive advertising revenue and has done a more factual reporting
job on the Vietnam War, its casualties, civil rights stories
and stories on such topics as the children of suburbia rebelling
against suburban community and its values.

"Ramparts" magazine is largely staff produced and has
nothing to offer but the guts and freedom of its reporters to
report facts as they see them. "Ramparts" does not edit the
reporters' articles for opinion or value of concept. These
articles are only edited for size and possible emphasis for. a
particular issue so that there would not be four articles on
Vietnam in a single issue, for instance. When "Ramparts" sends
a reporter to do a story it prints what the reporter writes
even though the Editor does not necessarily agree with that
peporter's viewpoint.

SCHEER feels that the United States is more
afflicted with an-extremely biased press because in the United
States we have the illusion of freedom and Americans are raised
to believe that we have a free press while in fact the press is
controlled through "an interlocking. directorate of big business,
big military and big government" that effectively manages the
news so that it is not troubling or upsetting to their interests. |

SCHEER believes that the honest reporting. of news. by
"Ramparts" is doing “an awful lot of good" because a generation
is being raised in the United States that knows how to be free
for a change and "is not going to buy the nonsense that comes
out of Washington". The youths are asking some very searching
questions about American society and are not satisfied with the
usual glibness so they are willing to go on marches because
they do not buy these answers. This is a very large minority
of youths.

Most of the American soldiers in Vietnam have been
raised to believe that their country always does right and have
an implicit racism. They realize that the Vietnamese do not
really share United States objectives. For instance "There
is a 650,000 man Vietnamese army that never does any fighting".
“It is’ very clear that the Viet Cong has considerable support
from the countryside and has done some very fine things in the
countryside."

There are some cracks in the brainwashing and some

disillusionment with the war in-Vietnam even among American troops.
were people have refused to fight and more people in the army

have taken those critical steps rather than go along with the
fighting. It is not a significant number yet, but SCHEER
believes it is growing. "We have to figure. out whether the
United States is Rome on the rise or Rome in decay and hopefully
America's empire is on the verge of cracking up."

When asked if he could make a generalization about the
American housewife and American’ married life, SCHEER stated,
“The average American is drunk most of the time." SCHEER
explained that the average American has a couple of drinks before
starting home and several more when he arrives at home. The
eocktail hour is all about getting "yourself numb enough that
you can take your wife and kids and then you usually fall asleep
in front of the television." ~

The "Albion Pleiad," Albion College weekly newspaper,
Albion, Michigan, in its issue of March 1, 1968, carried an
article headlined, "SCHEER Rips NORRIS, College." The article
stated SCHEER was scheduled to speak on the "relevance of
academe in response to cultural needs," but abandoned this
topic and instead dissected the speech given by Albion College
President LOUIS W. NORRIS to freshmen at this school in the fall
of 1967. SCHEER said Dr. NORRIS' speech stressed the importance
of vicarious learning and the central role of the "great
conversation." ‘SCHEER said the "great conversation is:a bore."
SCHEER stated that: white middle class Americans want to make a
revolution without doing anything revolutionary. SCHEER said
Dr. NORRIS stated in his speech "hippies" did not belong on
Albion's campus. SCHEER replied to this "with these ideas he
shouldn't be president of a university, and I wouldn't have to
make these statements if he hadn't given such a speech to the
freshmen." He said that America can no longer engage in foreign
aggression in the guise of extending freedom." SCHEER concluded
his speech by stating that to alleviate these crises America
should dismantle the defense apparatus, turn to a peace economy
and get out of Vietnam.

One of the critics of SCHEER's speech was quoted in
this article as saying, "Some of what. he said was admirable, but
he was.so irrational and so boorish and had excruciating bag

serious struggle for independence and fought the French who they
considered as foreign aggressors. Both Diem and Ky, South
Vietnamese leaders, worked for the French and thus the Viet Cong
consider them traitors to their people. Since the U.S. supnorts
¥v and formerly supported Diem, it was natural for the Viet Cong
to fight against the U.S." SCHEER said “the U.S. should settle

main speakers talking on American imperialism, stating it
was exhibited through the history of this country and was’
now being shown in Vietnam. SCHEER criticized the California
Board of Regents for having refused ELDRIDGE CLEAVER the
opportunity to lecture at a class at the University of
California, Berkeley, California (UCB). SCHEER defended —
HUEY P. NEWTON, Founder of the Black Panther Party (BPP)
(characterization to be found in the appendix), and stated
that becuase of all of the problems there had evolved a
close coalition between the BPP and the Peace and Freedom
Party (PFP).. SCHEER praised ELDRIDGE CLEAVER as the best
choice among the presidential candidates.(running on’ the PFP
ticket). SCHEER said this is a racist society in which we
live and the government's efforts to "control" the black man
is causing opposition to the government. He said we were
forced into the streets in Chicago and society blocked our
demands. SCHEER claimed "we must oppose that force."

At the same meeting, ELDRIDGE CLEAVER, Minister of
Information of the BPP and PFP presidential candidate, also

challenging the institution that is manipulating your life™".
SCHEER reportedly added, "the spots closest at heart are where
you can best challenge the manipulators. I Suggest you get
busy at task". He added, "even in the woods at Dartmouth,
where there aren't any girls, the elements for a confrontation
exist. I told a similar group at Columbia this, but they
wouldn't believe it, But look what happened". The article

VI. WRITINGS ABOUT SCHEER

“Human Events publication, Washington, D.C., in its
issue of April 8, 1967, carried a story headlined, “The Inside
Story of "Ramparts' Magazine". A portion of this story,

“Scheer's Radicalism", reads as follows:

“Probably the best known nationally of Ramparts’
staffers is Managing Editor Robert Scheer, who, at
30, has made a career of New Leftism. A former .member
of tne pro-Castro Fair Play for Cuba Committee, he
is the most articulate of the Ramparts crew and con-
tends that he is an anti-Communist.

“Last year Scheer ran for the Democratic nomi-~
nation for U. S. Congress in Berkeley, hinging his
entire campaign on getting out of the Liab in Viet
Nam and getting into the 'War on Poverty. Several
weeks ago, Scheer traveled to Prague, Glechoal wearia,
to meet with the Communist-controlled International
Union of Students and representatives of the National
Liberation Front, the political arm of the Communist
Viet Cong in South Viet Nam.

*Not publicized in his race for Congress but
revealed later was the fact that Scheer's campaign
coordinator was Carl Bloice, a 28-year-old Communist
party member. Bloice's CP inembership was hardly a
secret, for several years he had been a by-lined staff
writer. for People's World, the Communist’ weekly on
the West Coast, and then he was publications director
of the Communist-controlled W.E.B. DuBois Clubs. -

battlefield in Washington, D.C., where he will be a
correspondent for People's World-and The Worker... At
a farewell party December 23 at the home of Mr. and
Mrs. Robert Scheer, Carl was presented with several
going-away gifts, including a larger than life poster
of Mao-Tse Tung....Carl has indicated he will be an |
occasional. correspondent [for the Scheer newsletter]....
We all wish him the best of luck in Washington and
we feel. fully comforted by the fact that we are not
losing a coordinator, but gaining a spy.'

"Tax Money Helped

"The portrait of Mao probably brought a gust
of laughter when it was unveiled and presented to the
Moscow-line Bloice, and the ‘gaining a spy’ phrase was
simply New Left humor. The story makes two important
points: 1). Scheer's campaign manager was a Communist;
and 2). The Capital correspondent for two.Communist
newspapers will contribute occasional articles to
Scheer's campaign organization.

"Scheer has told Human Events that he hired Bloice
"for his technical competence’; that he likes him as
a person, but violently disagrees with his’ politics.

"Communist. Bloice, however, was only one of Scheer's
supporters. Another backer was the U.S. Treasury,

which channeled funds into Scheer's campaign. It
worked this way. During his campaign one of his
workers was Mrs. Phyllis Haberman O'Donnell, who has
been chairman of the Fist Bay DuRois Club. Mrs. O'Donnell
worked on a work-study program directed by. the
University of California's Department of Criminology
(which is now practically another Sociology Department)
and-was assigned to-a leftist group called Welfare

[Ae Rights Organization as a case worker. In truth, she
worked for the Scheer. campaign and reported on it

| at WRO meetings.

"The work-study program was originally funded
through the Office of Economic Oppertunity, receives
its funds through the National Defense Education Act
and is overseen by the Department of Health, Education
and Welfare." ;

An. article by IVAN SHARPE appeared in the San
Francisco Bay Guardian daily newspaper published at San Francisco,
California, in its issue of March 27, 1969, entitled "Ramparts -
revolution with limousine service." This article reflects
numerous interviews with present and former officials of Ramparts —
magazine and analyzes factors that led to this magazine's financial
difficulties. The article places primary blame for the bankruptcy
on WARREN HINCKLE and ROBERT SCHEER for their extragavant spending, |
such as taking their wives on trips for Ramparts and spending huge*
sums of money. Most of the blame was placed on WARREN HINCKLE*
because frequently his expense account would be more than the
money he raised on promotional trips. The article gave most of
the credit for the sensational stories and exposes to ROBERT
SCHEER, who obtained them from his new left contacts. It reported
that HINCKLE had destroyed Ramparts. and SCHEER was angry about
this. .SCHEER decided to stay on as Editor-In-Chief of Ramparts
and his salary has been reduced from $15,000 to $10,000 per year
in an effort to help the magazine out of its financial problems.

between Communist Party (CP) and Socialist Workers Party (SWP)
elements to exert their power within the FPCC and thereby

past year there had been a successful effort by FPCC leadership
to minimize the role of these and other. organizations in the
FPCC’so that their influence as of May, 1963, was negligible.

The SWP has been designated by the Attorney
General of the United States pursuant to
Executive Order 10450.

interference from other nations. LEE did not advocate
supporting the Cuban revolution per se.

STUDENTS FOR A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY

The Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), as it
is known today, came into being at a founding convention held
at Port Huron, Michigan, in June, 1962. The SDS is an association
of young people on the left and has a current progrem of pro-
| testing the draft, promoting a campaign for youth to develop
a conscientious objector status, denouncing United States in-
tervention in the war in Vietnam and to "radically transform"
the university community, and provide for its complete control
by students. GUS HALL, General Secretary, Communist Party, USA,
when interviewed by a representative of United Press International
in San Francisco, California, on May_14, 1965, described the
SDS as a part of the "responsible left" which the Party has
"going for us." At the June, 1965 SDS National Convention, an
anti-communist proviso was. removed from the: SDS constitution.
In the October 7, 1966 issue of "New Left Notes," the official
publication of SDS, an SDS spokesman stated that there are some
communists in SDS and they are welcome. The National Head-
quarters of this organization as of April 18,1967, was located
in Room 206,.1608 West Madison Street, Chicago, Illinois.

YOUNG SOCIALIST ALLIANCE

The May, 1960 issue of the "Young Socialist” (YS),
page 1, column 3, disclosed that during April 15-17, 1960, a
national organization entitled "The Young Socialist Alliance"
(YSA) was established at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This issue
stated that this organization was formed by the nation-wide
supporter clubs of the publication YS.

The above issue, page 6, set forth the Founding Declara-
tion of YSA. This declaration stated that the YSA recognizes the
Socialist Workers Party (SWP) as the only existing political
leadership on class struggle principles, and that the supporters
of the YS have come into basic political solidarity with the SWP
on the principles of revolutionary socialism.

A source advised on May 23, 1966, that the original YSA
was an organization formed during Ocfdber, 1957, in New York City
by youth of various left socialist tendencies, particularly members
and followers of the SWP. The leaders of this group were the
guiding forces in the establishment of the national organization.

The source further advised on May 23, 1966, that the YSA
is dominated and controlled on a national basis by the SWP through
having SWP members comprise exclusively the National Executive
Committee (NEC). The YSA, in reality, is the youth and training
section of the SWP and the main source of new SWP members.

. The headquarters of the YSA are located in Room 535,
| 41 Union Square West, New York City.

The SWP has been designated pursuant to
Executive Order 10450.
