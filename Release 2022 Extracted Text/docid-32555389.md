ALEX: I°ll talk te him and have him go to JOE and
let JOE send him in. Or, I could send him
’ to the lawyer, but I’m just trying to
avoid that question if it came up.
: HUMPHREYS: : I don't think it will, but it’s good.
ALEX: We got to got another witness.
HUMPHREYS: Another one; We got to get a lot of them!
ALEX: And we got to get them before they get them.
HUMPHREYS: Yeah. You know who we could get to be a
: witness? He'd be a hell of a witness.
ALEX: Who?
HUMPHREYS: CLAIR.

The reference of ALEX to MONAGHAN is probably a
reference to ROBERT F. MOKAGHAN, an Assistant United States
Attorney in Chicago. The reference to CLINTON
is a reference to STANFORD CLINTON, who is an attorney in Chicago,
and who is ome of the attorneys representing ANTHONY ACCARDO in
his pending trial. It is obvious that the conversation concerns
the trial of ACCARDO, who has been indicted for fraudulently
charging expenses for the use of his autemobile which he claims
he used to sell “Foxhead Fourhundred" beer for the Premium
Beer Sales, Imcorporated. It is apparemt that ALEX. and
HUMPHREYS are concerned with finding witmesses whe will back
up ACCARDO's claim that~he used the car during the course
of selling "Foxhead Fourbundred.” 4

The Yorkshire referred to is believed to be the
Yorkshire Room Restaurant located at 2842 North Sheridan Road
in Chicago. ‘ :

The reference to STEVE by ALEX midway im the conversation
is probably a reference to STEVE DE KOSTA. It is noted
that DE KOSTA is ostensibly the owner and mamager of the Huckster's—
Restaurant in Chicago, According to PCI TURA SATANA, a
” burlesque dancer, who is intimately friendly. with HENRY SUSK
and alse well acquainted with GUS ALEX, the Huckster's is operated

all right. But he talked to some other
fellow there. Apout a month ago. And
I know we don't like this guy so I spoke to
VITO and told him I might have to make a trip.
He said whenever you're ready. I didn't
want to make it too soon. Because then a
lot of time lapses. I'd rather make it
as close as possible. So that's. about
it. i

FERRARO: OK GEORGIE, :

It is noted. that FERRARO referred to SAVARESE as
GEORGIE, however, GEORGIE is in-all probability a common

exists that this may be VITO GENOVESE, New York.top hoodlum.
