it etat 8, on pose 6, that:

“Contributions vill be recetved vithout conpraaising the
responsibility for decisions and orponization of the plans. ‘Thie dows
not rule out our search for eomselling and coartication vith other
foctas. preeent, but vithout svor curremiering the responsibility and
absolute ecntral-of the erations.” (Uinierlintug added)”

4. ‘The operations contemplated by the :RP aro not too dissimilar
from those proposed by the Mi/l/PN dection for Fr 1962. They inelute
the operution of maritime assete copabie of reaching nll Cuban coasts,
the operetion of aerial supniy craft (fra: tvo bases), the training and
infiltration of 8/T operators end intelligence agents, supzart of internal
guerrillas, and the treining of eight or tea 15)-mn gramps for introduction
into Cuba at the right time. (there is alno conaiderabis tress given to
the mounting of extensive psychological warfare). The HkP plan vould pose
