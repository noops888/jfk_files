Final Determination Notification

AGENCY : HSCA
RECORD NUMBER : 180-10068-10322
RECORD SERIES : STAFF PAYROLL RECORDS
AGENCY FILE NUMBER :

December 8, 1995
Status of Document: Postponed in Part

Number of releases of previously postponed information: 14

Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors
including: (a) the significant historical interest in the document in question; (b) the
absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United
States or to any individual.

Number of Postponements: 5

Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.

Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could.
reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that invasion of
privacy would be so substantial that it outweighs the public interest.

Serving the Greater Philadelphia and South Jersey Area 3

November 18, 1976

pear Dick:

I've been following the progress of the House Select
Committee on Assassinations and its chief counsel as well as
newspaper and wire service stories permit.

I gather, at least from a Newhouse News Service report,
that the committee unanimously has agreed to support your
request for a staff of 170 but that the actual funding will not
follow until after January 1.

If that's the case, and you can use me now, I'd like
to come to Washington and get involved as early as possible.
I think I can be more effective in the role of press
liaison officer if I arrive on the scene before the great
bulk of the staff.

I have received a formal letter from Bulletin management
confirming an extended lewve of absence. But this does not
preclude a short-term leave. Even if Congress ultimately
refuses to fund the investigations fully and they are cut
short, I feel I could return to the Bulletin without loss
of face or funds. The experience of working for even a few
weeks or ‘months with the committee would be worth the effort.

Also, even though I would move to Washington immediately,

Shirley and Sharon would remain in Philadelphia to June 30.

I, therefore, would not get involved with a long-term # lease
until the summer. So, if the investigations are terminated

early, there would be little financial hardship on my part.

I understand that you are extremely busy at this point,
preparing a budget and interviewing prospective staff members.
But I would appreciate a call at your convenience.

I am somewhat anxious since several of the AP stories
mention "a spokesman for Sprague." I recall that you mentioned
Thomas N. Downing.

a temporary press secretary, aide to Rep.

My concern is that he may become permanent.

Dear Dick:

Here is my resume.

I'm also happy to tell you that The Bulletin has granted
me an extended leave of absence. In fact, management, I am told,
was "thrilled" with the idea.

The leave was granted in record time. This was a surprise.
I thought it would take weeks of negotiation. That's why gi
went ahead and requested it now instead of waiting.

Of course, I explained in writing to The Bulletin that
if for some reason the House does not provide sufficient funds
for the dual investigation, the deal is off.

Now that The Bulletin has been apprised of the situation,
I feel very little notice is required. This means I could start
as your press secretary soon after things are worked out with
the House committee.

I hope that is soon. I am anxious to get involved as
early as possible.

Meanwhile, I'm reading extensively in the Kennedy-King
literature. I'm also meeting with an old friend, the press
officer for the Federal Energy Administration here, to get
some ideas about dealing with the media from the other side
of the fence.

I will be in Washington, Monday and Tuesday, Nov. 8 and 9,

Georgetown, American or George Washington.

If it's all right with you, I'd like to stop into
the temporary offices of the House Select Committee on

Assassinations when I'm down there.
