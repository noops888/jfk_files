SUBJECT: Summary of the Meeting with William Miller, . Staff duce

Director, Senate Select Committee on Intelligence,
re Foreign Liaison

1... During the meeting today with Bill Miller with Messrs. Knoche,
Wells, Waller and Cary in attendance, Miller tried to elaborate on the
interest and concern of the Committee which prompted Ghairman Daniél
Inouye's letter of 11 November with regard to activities of foreign
intelligence organizations in the United States with whom. we have liaison
contacts, Miller touched on what he referred to as "parity in operations"
--implicit understandings or at least results in parity between our
intelligence operations and those of foreign governments,

2. The question of the quid pro quo, that is, an understanding
with a foreign intelligence service that the U.S. would be permitted to
conduct intelligence operations within the country if. they were given
comparable. opportunities, in the U.S. :

3. The question of support of foreign governments and what this
might entail -- in this connection Miller mentioned Senator Gary Hart's
(D., Colo.) interest and concern in the overgll impact of the(IBEX. program
+A Gn Iran.) Relationships with(SAVAK, Dina) tc., were touched on in this
ontext and with respect to the latter organization, Miller expressed concern _
about the possible long-range consequences of our (that is, the U. S.) providing
early training for foreign intelligence officers who may subsequently wind :
up in operations against the U.S. or activities in the U.S. In this connection,
Miller said he would be interested in.what Mr. Knoche referred to as the
. constraints on our training of these individuals.

4. In the areas of penetration of foreign intelligence services,
the question arose as to why if we can penetrate a foreign intelligence
service, we can't learn what that foreign service has in mind as far as
plans for activities within the U.S. are concerned. Mr. Wells pointed

out that we had never targeted against American sections of foreign
intelligence services on the basis that their activities within the U.S.
were not within our overall charter, Miller said the Committee would
be interested in some discussion about possible future capabilities in
this regard. It was agreed that Mr. Wells, with the assistance of the IG,
would prepare a rough outline or paper on a presentation which would
originally be given to the Chairman and Vice Chairman which we.would
review with Miller before any meetings with even the leadership or the
Committee are scheduled. Once that has been run by Miller it could
then be fleshed out to the leadership and ultimately to the Committee,

5. As Miller was leaving, I told him I would be meeting with

. Richard Sprague, Acting Director, House Select Committee on Assassinations,

this afternoon, I told him while I was not prying into the Committee's
business, I was hopeful that the Assassinations Committee would be in
touch with the Select Committee. I said we were particularly concerned
about establishing firm security procedures with the Assassinations
Committee, Miller said they had been contacted by the Assassinations
Committee for access to their records and Miller had indicated to them
that they would’ be willing to provide access to their records so long as
the Assassinations Committee agreed to abide by the disclosure provisions
ef S. Res. 400. To date the Assassinations Committee has not ot xesponded

it offer, Siiereetenriseereeeeeeemmeeceeconareze® \

6. also mentioned to Miller that the Office of Security was issuing

Be sae badges and tightening up on Headquarters security procedures
ince we are having a number of congressional staff people from
va Ss committees coming into the building, we propose to modify the’
badging procedures previously used with the Select Committee staffers
to © the extent that we would like to have prior notification from staff
personnel of their visits to Headquarters before badges are issued, Miller
said.this would pose no problems for them,
