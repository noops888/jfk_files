6. Notwithstanding the negative finding about the

handwriting, we have compared the typing in the 'LIFE

Mom in letter with theny, an in the severan letters

that the "LIFE. Magazine" letter was typed on the same

machine (KATONA) has been using to write letters io

Agency personnel? 3

7. Furthermore, there are several similaritics

in the construction and lay-out, phraseology, and

general theme of the "'LIFE Magazine" letter and

03

KATONA's letters to lead to the conclusion that (KATONA)

typed thr "LIFE Magazine" letter on his own typewriter.

8. Some of these similarities, among others: are:

(1) All the paragraphs are indented five spaces in both the

questioned and known letters; (2) the use of hyphenated

phrases and clauses in the middle of sentences, (3) the use

of "SPY OUT IN THE COLD"' in at least two instances, and

(1) several instances of appellations such as "701 Class of

''62" 0- "Agent 701".

9. SUMMARY: It is our opinion that KIMSEY can

be eliminated as a suspect in this matter. It is our

opinion that the "LIFE Magazine" letter was typed or

KATONA's)typewriter by KATONA

might bear additional evi-

dence: he sared for examination with as little handling as

possiple, and (2) that a minimum number of persons

cossed for latent fingerprints. The copy of the "LIFE

Magazine" letter is a Xerox copy made through a screen,

which indicates that it was probably produced by a Xerox

System mass production printer.

This leads to the specu-

lation that many other copies might have been produced.

tions regarding this matter should be directed to Lon
