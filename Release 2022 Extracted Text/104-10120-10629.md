2. The Official Personnel Folder o{ Gaza Andrew
KATONA)containing several typewritten letters and a
small amount of cursive handwriting, and handwriting
specimens of Herman Edward KIMSEY were also for-
warded with the request that an examination and compari-
son be made to determine if eithe( KATONA pr KIMSEY
wrote the note to Mr. Helms. °

3. In addition to the handwriting specimens of
KIMSEY, which you submitted, numerous other speci-
mens of his handwriting on file in TSD/AB/QDS, where
he was formerly employed, were used in the examination.

4. It is our opinion that the handwritten note

erences in the writing habits of both of these
men and the questioned note.

The handwriting in the "Helm note"
some exjdgnce as having been written by a person not as
mature 2s(SATONASor KIMSEY. perhaps an adolescent.
It is noted that(KATONMhas two sons about 22 years of
age and once about l? years old.

6. Notwithstanding the negative finding about the

handwriting, we have compared the typing in the "LIFE
Magazine), letter with the typing in the several letters
from (KATONAStO the Agency, and it is our conclusion
that the "LIFE Magazine" letter was typed on the same
machine (KATONA) has been using to write letters to

Agency personnel.

7. Furthermore, there are several similarities
in the construction and lay-out, phraseology, @
general theme of the "LIFE Magazine" letter and 63
KATONA's letters to lead to the conclusion that(KATONA)
typed the "LIFE Magazine" letter on his own typewriter.

8. Some of these similarities, among others. are:
Q) All the paragraphs are indented five spaces in both the
questioned and known letters; (2) the use of hyphenated
phrases and clauses in the middle of sentences, (3) the use
of "SPY OUT IN THE COLD" in at least two instances, and
(4) several instances of appellations such as "701 Class of
162" or "Agent 701".

9. SUMMARY: It is our opinion that KIMSEY can
pe eliminated as a suspect in thig matter. It is our
opinion that the "LIFE Magazine" letter was typed on

(KATONA's)typewriter by CATONS.

handle the letter (enclosures) in order that it may be pro-
cessed for latent fingerprints. ‘The copy of the "LIFE
Magazine" letter is a Xerox copy made through a screen,
which indicates that it was probably produced by a Xerox
System mass production printer. This leads to the specu-
lation that many other. copies might have been produced.
