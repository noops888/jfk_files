In regard to the letter postmarked August 11, 1958,

which she sent to LOUIS MARTINEZ, C/O Ponce de Leon Hotel,

Miami, Florida, regarding an "$800 deal", KRAJCIK informed

that letter referred to a personal matter in which MARTINEZ

was not personally involved. She said the letter had nothing

to do with the issue at hand in this case, namely the theit

of the weapons from the canton Armory, and she stated she dia

not want to disclose the facts to which she referred in the

letter.

She added that no one that has ever been previously

mentioned by her or to her in this case has anything to do

with the "deal"

In regard to MARTINEZ, KRAJCIK stated that from

January 4, 1959, to approximately January 30, 1959, he

was staying in Cuba at the Havana Hilton Hotel.

say "hello".

She stated that she had no other contact with

him during that period but recalled that on March 17, 1959,

mentator mention that LOUIS MARTINEZ Of Canton, Ohio, was in

jail in Havana, Cuba, because of failing to pay his hotel

bill at the Havana Hilton.

She said this news was a surprise to her, and the

next day she went to see MARTINEZ' brother in Canton, 0h10,

o Iind out more about it. His brother said he didn't know

any of the details and was going to try to find out what had

happened.

Continuing, KRAJCIK informed that on March 22, 1959,

at 11:00 PM, she received a call from MARTINEZ asking her to.

pick him up

, at the Cleveland airport at 6:00 AM on March 23,

1959, as he was returning to the United States on that flight.

She said she met him as he asked and returned to Wooster, Ohio,

where MARTINEZ borrowed her car to go to Canton,

Ohio.

that time he explained to her that someone named "MORGAN" from

somewhere in Ohio, who was in Cuba when MARTINEZ was there,

and

who evidently

had some connection with the present Cuban

administration, had reported MARTINEZ as a "phony" and traitor

to CASTRO, thereby causing him to be jailed and charged as

being anti-CASTRO.

He also informed her that CASTRO himself

got him out of the trouble, and somehow MARTINEZ was able to

raise the money for the hotel bill.

Continuing, KRAJCIK informed MARTINEZ stayed in

Canton until the following Wednesday, March 25, 1959, when

supposedly on "business"

he went to New York City' (phonetic). She said she again

continued to stay in Canton and contact her periodically.

She said she last heard from him by phone on the evening of

April 1, 1959, at which time he said he

would be going to

New York City at 3:00 PM On April 2, 1959, again on business.

KRAJCIK said she now feels that MARTINEZ is probably

not involved in the theft of the weapons from the Canton Armory,

as she felt that had he been so involved, he would have certainly

confided in her about the theft by this time.

on March 20, 1959, PCI PETE SCHRUM advised that he

had received no additional information concerning LOUIS MARTINEZ

or his connection with the theft from the Ohio National Guard

Armory in Canton. He stated that he tried to find out from

"STRETCH" MYERS what MARTINEZ wanted SCHRUM to do but MYERS

said it was none of his business and "took a swing at me".

On April 3, 1959, PCI PETE SCHRUM stated that he

was recently at the Hi-Life Cafe in Canton, Ohio, and EUGENE

MITCHELL, 1451 Garfield Avenue, S.W., mentioned that he did

sell him

an Ml rifle. SCHRUM stated that he professed interest

in such a purchase, but MITCHELL made no further mention of

the rifle.

SCHRUM stated that MITCHELL he believes is

acquainted with LOUIS MARTINEZ and was married just before

Christmas of 1958 and held his

wedding reception at the

Spanish-American Center in Canton.

MARTINEZ, who was at the

reception, brought up in conversation his interest in Bars

and Ml rifles, asking SCHRUM if he would know a good weapon

when he saw one.

SCHRUM stated that he told MARTINEZ that

he could tell a good Bar or Ml rifle if he saw one.

PCI SCHRUM stated that "STRETCH" MYERS had commented

on a recent night at the Hi-Life Cafe that it would be easy

to get into the Ohio National Guard Armory in Canton: SCHRUM

stated that he made no additional statements in this regard

and didn't know whether he was just making conversation or

whether he was referring to the theft of the weapons from the

armory.

On February 26, 1959, the Chicago Office advisea

that SA JOSEPH L. SYLVESTER had made several recontacts with
