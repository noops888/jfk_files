1. Station fully agrees with Headquarters concerning the value of

concentrating LIFEAT or LIENVOY coverage on suspected and/or known

Soviet, Satellite and Cuban agents residing in Mexico City.

The Station

in the paot has undertaien this type coverage and will continue such

coverage in the future as LIFEAI and LIENVOY facilities become avail-

able for assignment to these targets. As lieadquarters is awarc, tia Station

can and will cover any possible target Headquarters considors of high

enough priority to cover.

2. For example, Carmen BRUFAU Civit was covered for 1950, 1957,

1960 and 1901; the results were not considered of sufficient value to continue

the coverage.

PROJECT REVIEW

1. Produce of the Project

A. Sovict Coverage

As nored li last year's Project LIFEAT renewal request, LIFEAT coverage

of the officlal Soviet Installatton was discontinued on 22 June 1960 when the

parallel lalson projeci LIENVOY assumed coverage of this target. In erly

January 1962 LIFEAT undertook coverage of the home phones of three of the

most active Soviet Intelligence offleers.

This wis in response to the con-

tinuing Station Cl program which includes the monitoring of Sor let comtacts,

and the guidance recelved from KUDESK Staff at the time of the last LIFEAT

renewal. As of this date, this coverage has not been active for sufficlent

tIne to fully evaluate its usefulness. However, lt la sellered that such

field. Although not designed to provide positive Intelligence, some by-product

of this type has been obtained. Samples are as follows:

HMM-6364, 8 May 1902 (Briefing of Mexican Pro-Marxist Journallst

by sovier Embassy)

HMM-6382, 15 May 1962 (Mexican Traveller to the USSR)

HMM-6376, 11 May 1962 (Refutation of Rumors that Soviet Cosmonaut

TITOV will visit Mexico)

B. Pullsh Embassy

C. Cuban Coverage

LIFEAT was abie to provide coverage of major firms dealing In U.S: goods

transshipment via Mexico to Cuba.

This technical operation not only pro-

vided Initlal leads whitch alerted the Statlon to these companies, but also

wad able to provide continuing Information on the dally actlvities of the com-

panles Involveu. Coverage of certain Cuban personages arranging for Illegal

transshipment of U.S. goods to Cuba was also provided including their con-

tacts and general activities.

Samples of the positive intelligence production

from this Cuban commercial coverage are as follows:

D. American Communists in Mexico

As in the past, most of the targets in this group have been covered at the

uring the period uly 1901 through May 1y02

take were passed io local ODENVY for their processing. The most valuable

information gleaned from the targets in this fleld cont lnues to deal with con-

tacts, travel, and general activities of the American Communist Group in

Mexico (ACGM).

E. Exile and Revolutlonary Activitles

LIFEAT continues to provide information on the exile and revolutionary groups

• active in Mexico, which informatlon is of the greatest value to the Statlon and

not avallable from other sources. The emphasis of the LIFEAT effort in this

area has been directed toward coverage of Nicaraguan, Guatemalan, and more

recently Spanish Republican exiles.

The product has been most rewarding in this

coverage. Examples of productivity in this past project year:

HMMA - 17489, 4 August 1961 (Alejandro GALINDO)

HMMA - 18420, 5 January 1962 (Teodora MARTEN Rodriguez)

P. Counter- Intelligence Information

By Its latest Related Mission Directive, Mexico City Station's major respon-

sibilitles continue to lie in the field of CI/CE matters. LIFEAT was able io

provide a valuable contribution in the attainment of the Station's objectives. in

thts fleld.

'Coverage included that on Carlos Humberto ILLESCAS, who is

acting In a covert liaison capacity between the CP and the Soviet Embassy in

Mexico City. Besides the continuing operational support in the CI/CE field,

the following informational reporting was provided:

HMNi-5742, 7 July 1961 (Travel of Mexican Leftists Behind Iron

Curtain)

HMM-5836, 18 August 1961 (Activities of Mexican Student of the

UnIversity of Peoples' Friendship)

HMM-6377, 11 May 1962 (Scholarship for Study in Warsaw lo Jorge

G. Operational Support and Leads Provided other Station Operations

During the past project year LIFEAT continued actively supporting Mexico City

Station through production of leads unobtainable through other assets and gen-

erally providing other Station operations the secure support only available

through a unilateral telephone tap operation. The following is a selected list,

together with a brief description, of major contributions of operational suppor

and leads provided through LIFEAT:

---

## Page 16

14-01100

- 5

LIFEAT/Cuban: The mos: noteworthy LIFEAT contribution to Station efforts

In the Cuban operations field was that of providing leads pinpointing the acti-

vities of Transcontiriental, S. A. in the illegal transshipment of U.S. materials

LIFEAT was able to continue coverage of the activities

of this company despite the efforts of the company to lose itself in the Mexican

business community by changing the name it operated under to Inversiones

Mexicanas, S. A. and changing its location and telephone number. Valuable

information on the commercial commodities needed by the Castro regime,

methods and contacts used in their procurement. and information on the con

tacts of the Cuban Embassy in Mexico were obtained.

LIFEAT/Czechoslovakian: LIFEAT coverage of the home phones of two Czech

Intelligence officers provided some leads to their contacts, but more impor-

tantly, provided greater security to KUBARK when one of their CIS officers,

Miloslav CECH, was singled out for a defection attempt.. Through LIFEAT

"Ilvemonitoring" of boih the original and followup defection attempts, the

KUBARK assets were provided maximum protecion from possible attempts

by CECH to alert his coworkers or arrange entrapme. of the KUBARK per-

sonnel Involved.

LIFEAT/Polish: Probably the mos: "classic" example of the use of a telephone

cap in providing a leid which could deveiop into a vial penetration of the Polish

intelligence occurred recently in the BEKNAVE/BECHICK operation. LIFEAT

provided the initial leads which made the Station aware of the possibilities of an

operation and has continued to provide vital information for Station's develop-

ment of the operation. It is the Siation's opinion that this one instance of service

by LIFEAT was well worth the cost of the entire projeci for the year. (Full

information forwarded in MEXI 0462 and MEXI 0463). Also of great interest

to the Station were the LIFEAT provided leads which revealed Jan SLUSARZ,

Attache of the Pulish Embassy in Mexico, had purchased an automobile which

had been stolen in the U.S. and driven to Mexico. In this operation, in whick

a defection attempt was considered, LIFEAT provided no: only the initial leads,

bur also daily operational information vital to the Scarion's efforts in this case.

LIFEAT/Yugoslavian: In this coverage of the Yugoslavian Embassy LIFEAT is

providing the basic Jata necessary in establishing operations against this targes.

Since the Station is expanding its coverage of Yugoslavian acrivities, much vital

data on personalities, contacis. and services obtained by the target establish-

inent must be provided. It is chis exact type of coverage that LIFEAT is geared

to provide in addition to the operational leads which will be forthcoming as this

coverage progresses. The interested case officer, noting LIFEAT is his only

present source of information, feels the take which LIFEAT provides and wul

---

## Page 17

6

continue to provide in this area is vital and basic to the mounting öf any

operations against the Yugoslay target.

LIFEAT/Soviet/Double Agent: LIFEAT support has provided needed sup-

porting information in backing Station double agent operations.

In this ared

the success of the operation is obviously dependent upon the veracity of the

agent. LIFEAT provides information which enables the interested case

officer to determine the veracity of the ageni involved. LIFEAT also provides

a needed check upon the activities of the double agent.

LIFEAT/Spanish Republican: LIFEAT coverage of Spanish Republican exiles

in Mexico City have enabled the Station to monitor the activitles of the various

groupings of the exiles, including the projected attempt on the life of the

senior ODACID official in Mexico, LIFEAT has covered personalities of exile

factions both involved in planning this attempt and those opposed to it. Coverage

of targets in this area also enables the Station to keep abreast of the plans and

activities ofte varlous groups which make up the Spanish Republican exile

community in Mexico City.

LIFEAT/CI-CE Coverage: LIFEAT leads in this area are exploited in the re-

porting of travel of important Communists, particularly to Cuba and Iron ?:

Curtain countries, and the travel of U.S. citizens, especially Communists and

Leftists, so Cuba.

Through coverage of the American Communist Group in

Mexico (ACGM) LIFEAT has provided ODENVY with an increasing amount of

information on the leftist activities of relatives and friends of the ACGM who

reside in the U.S. One of the noteable items in this regard is providing data

on the overt and covert efforts of the blacklisted "Hollywood Ten" to rega in their

former status in the U.S. film indusiry.

Finally, and certainly not of least importance, Station security has been enhanced

through LIFEAT perlodic coverage of former Station assets, like LIVESTOCK-1

and LIVESTUCK-2, who could be a danger to particular Station operations or

personnel. Monitoring of certain terminated agents is considered especially

valuable where these agents were involved in the more sensitive operations.

to the liaison forces, well justify the expenditure of funds, time, personnel,

and security risk. 'As it has been noted in the past, that even with the Station's

envolvement in the parallel; bur liaison, LIENVOY operation, a change in

atritude by the present local government administration or a change in govern-

ment administrations could end KUBARK participation in that liaison project.

For that reason, LIFEAT, in addition to maintaining its present heavy coverage,

must be available to once again undertake coveräge of the official Sovlet and

Czech official targets in Mexico City. Therefore, LIFEAT's present orientation,

though toward supporting Station operationa and Cl/CE mission rather than toward

argets which would provide positive intelligence, leaves it readily avalluble for

recall into the Sovlet-Czech coverage: It is the Station's firm opinion that the

LIFEAT project provides a substantial and vital contribution in fulfilling the

several priority objectives of the Station's Related Mission Directive.

I. Thère is attached a list of the HMMs produced from LIFEAT provided material

during the period July 1961 through May 1962 as a by-product of the project's

prime responsibility of providing support to Station operations.

Il. Progress of the Operation

The objectives of the LIFEAT Project are of a continuing nature and are there-

fore not considered for fulfillment during any given period of time.

For this

reason percentage figures as to compleiion uf projeci objectives cannor be drawn.

However, an indication of the coverage provided in working toward fulfillment

of the objectives can be noted in that 14, 000 pages of raw text were produced

in the period july 1yol through May lyo. Lifeat has been in datly operatior

turing the review period with the average number of lines covered per month

being 20, wich a high in March 1962 of 28 lines covered.

III. Planning for the Future

As was indicated at the time of the last project renewal, LIFEAT hopes to re-

main uncommitted to coverages that require the expenditure of a great portion

of LIFEAT resources but provide coverage of but one target... such as Soviet

Embassy coverage.

It is added emphatically, however, that should the need arise

for LIFEAT to again assume such responsibilities, it is fully able to do so.

Until such time LIFEAT will continue to enjoy greater flexibility in the employ-

ment of its assets, especially in the areas in which the Station does not wish to

reveal its interest or operations to the liaison-forces involved in the LIENVOY

As to particular areas of operations, the Station has hopes of employing

LIFEAT assers in "hot mike operations which require access to telephone

centrals and cables. The feasibility of using LIFEAT in this type of operation

has already been proven, In a recent operation with the LIERODE installation

as a target. Seven reels öf "hot mike"

take were obtalied in test runs on

checking both the operation (including installation of the "miked" Instrument

in the office of the head of the LIERODE official Installation) and the equipment

which was of radical design and conceived and built by the KURIOT technlelan

assigned to Mexico City Station under deep cover. Unfortunately, before con-

tinuous operation could get underway, the LIERODE installation decided upon

complete renovation of its telephone system, including the Installällon of a

switchboard. This, at least temporarily, precludes further operation against

this particular target, unlesy a direct line is installed there. However, it is

the intention of the Station to attempt coverage of other targets of Interest. In

these plans LIFEAT plays the key role in installation, line and serles cross.

maintenance, basehouse procurement and maintenance, and processing of také.

From the brief test runs via the LIERODE operation noted above, it is believed

that "hot mike" operations, supported and maintained by LIFEAT, can greatly ald

the Station in Its coverage of responsibilities under its present Related Mission

Directive.

IV: Performance of Agents

The overall performance of all agents employed in the LIFEAT complex con-

tinued to be good during the period of the project review, wich security being

stressed in all phases of the operation. No security problems were encountered

which were not solved by the personnel involved. Since the success of the

LIFEAT operation depends largely upon the security of its personnel, Head-

quarters clearances and evaluation of now personnel will continue to le soughi

on those new additions who pass a strict field assessment.

V. Expenditures

Approval for renewal of Project LIFEsT was granted 8 Sepiember 1961 for FY

1962 in the amount of $98, 973.03. The proposed budget for FY 1953 is broken

PROJECT LIFEAT

PROJECT OUTLINE, PART I

1: Aréa of Operations

This operation ls run from Mexico City Station and is concerned wlth targets

located within Mexico City.

2. Purpose

The purpose of thia project Is to provide, unilatcrally, dally Information on the

acilvities of offlelal foreign installations in Mexico and the personnel thereof,

as well as coverage of the activities of selecied Individuals and groups In response

to böth Station needs and Hendquarters requests. Presently, LIFEAT stresses

Mexibility of coverage with support of Station operations and Cl/CE coverage

recelving he greatest emphasis.

3. Background

Project LIFENT was originated on 3. October 1950 as a unilateral telephone tap

operation. Actual initiation of operations under this authority occurred on 18

January 1951, and the operation has run continuou. ly from that date.

The pro-

Ject was opened with the Installatlon of a single tap ard has grown in the past

eleven years to coverage of as many as thirty lines In a glven month.

The LIFEAT Project Is a unilateral operation completely independent from any

Ilalson arrangement. It ls staffed by KUBARK contract employees with the ma.

jority of personnel being Indigenous controlled agents.

During the past eleven years, Project LIFEAT has produced more than 83, 500

(estimate) pages uf operational and Intelligence information In direct support of

Mexico City Station's specific objectives, and contributed materlally to the in-

telligence gathering activities connected with the Sovlet-Satellite Bloc and more

recently with the Cuban representatives in Mexico. In addition, LIFEAT has

been of considerable value in monitoringte acrivities of the American Communist

Group in Mexico (ACGM), ag well as the activitles of the exile groups and local

Communists.

With the LIENVOY's assumption of coverage of the Sovlet and Czechoslovaklan

officil Installations in July 1960, LIFEAT assets were recased from continuous

coverage: of these two targers.

These asscts were then employed in direct

support of Station operationg--a role Ideally sulted for a unilateral operation

such as LIFEAT, and extremely Important to the security and success of

Station operatlong, LIFEAT, after spending muels of Project Year 1961 - 1962

programing to this new role and redirecting lis assets, has now adjusted to

this role and ls fully employed in this vital assignment.

Station. No operatonal coordination Is required with any oiher geographical

area," but they are advised of any information produced by LIFEAT which may

be of interest to them.

b. Project LINOC which supports the principal "ourslie" Case Officer,

Duvid M. WILSTED, Is eifecied In coordination with Project LIFEAT.

c. Coordination with the parallel, but llaison project - LIENVOY, Is

closely coordinated between the responsible Case Officers of both projects,

particularly relating to the division of coverage between the two operatlong,

thereby assuring that the unilateral LIFEAT operation will nor be endangered

by the indigenous personnel of the LIENVOY operation.

9. Personnel

a. Career and Contract Agents

(1) David M. WILSTED (201-009195), principal "outside" Case Officer.

(2) Wayne C. DRABAND (201-255095), outside assisiant to David

M. WILSTED. DRABAND was introduced into the LIFEAT opera-

tion in November 1961 as a replacement for Ralph B. RAFANELLI

ho was transferred from Mexico PCS in the fall of 1961. His Ol

vas amended 14 November 1961 to cover his use in the LIFEA

Project. Although DRABAND possessed only limited knowledge of

clandestine activity when first employed, under WILSTED's Instruc-

tion and Case Officer guidance, plus his own willingness and capacity

for work, it appears he will prove a valuable addition to the

LIFEAT complex.

c.

During the past project year the following personnel were dropped

from Project LIFEAT:

(1) Ralph B. RAFANELLI (201-175295), staff agent, was reassigned

PCS after completing his second tour in Mixico on 8 October

1961.

(2) OlIvIA N. GLADMON (201-117751), LIFEAT processor, has given

notice that due to her planned return to the Unlted States for

necessary eye surgery during June 1962, her employment with

LIFEAT must be terminated.

Agent quit-claim and secrecy

agreement have been executed.

(3) Leona C. GANDARA (201-225710), employed by LIFEAT only

for standby support during the pass year and une half, now

is employed for support and clerical work fur MKCHARITY.

(*) LIFEUD-20, (formerly LIMITATION-5), (201- 10230$), and

LIFEUD-21, formerly LIMITA TON-6 (201-117981) will be ter-

minated as of the end of the present LIFEAT project year (30

June 1962). Plans for use of this couple as baschousekerpers

were cancelled when LIFEUD 22 and LIFEUD-23, who are nore

desirable cholces, became avallable for LIFEAT use. Ter-

mination has been discussed fully with these indigenous agents,

and ¿erminat lon arrangements were accomplished on a friendly

and mutually agrocable basis (as in all LIFEAT terminatlons,

separation Is made on the basto of Mexican custom and/or law).

10. Operational Clearances

See Section 9 above.

11. Cover

There are no changes in the cover of personnel who have been previously em-

ployed in the LIFEAT operation. With the new agents employed since the last

project renewal, cover is as follows: …

b. LIEMBR.1CE-8 has natural oover of a retired U.S. businegsman

uf many years residence in Mexico City.

c. LIFEUD-22 has natural cover of a Cuban exile employed by a

Mexican firm In Moxico City. He works regular hours at hla

cover employment und partakes in LIFEAT activides before

and after work and during lunch hours.

d. LIFEUD-23, she mother of LIFEUD-22, has natural cover of

housekeeper for her.son and performs her LIPEAT dulles

only lu their home.

12. Contact and Communicatlong

Daily contact la malmained berween the Case Officer and the agenis employed in

the project.

These contacia are made in a clandeetine manner with varying

patterns established for car pickups, foot contacte, and emergency meetings.

Pre-arranged signals are employed in serting and accomplishing the meetings. .

When heavy or bulky materlal is to do passed, meerings are heid at nighi. En-

france to the busehouses by other than the baschousekeepers la made only on the

bagis of siric necessity; such as need for equipment repalo, installation for

now line coverages, or line coverage cut off.

Telephone contact concerning the project and with the agents is lept to a min-

Imum. Pre-arranged open code Is used for phone conversations between Case

Officers and agents. Alternate and emergency communications have been arranged

and are reviewed frequently by the personnel using them.

These systeing of contact and communication appear suitable for the project

and function adiquately from the security and utility standpoinis. Locations and

times of meerings are reviewed periodically and are changed frequenily to decrease

the possibility of arousing the suspicions of the residcnis of areas in which meet-

ings are held.

## Page 28

14-00000

13. Control and MotIvation

Control and motivation are primarlly based ón two factors: ideology and

financial galn.

A secondary factor is the fear of reprisal from the local

police should discovery occur.

14. Securlty

During the pas: project year there were no incidents which were beyond the

capability of the personnel Immediately Involved to Isolate and remedy im-

mediately. In contrast to previous years, there was no instance of telephone

work crews approaching a bagehouse to check or reinove the tap lines running

ro that baschouse.

Some of the "crosses" made in the telephone centrals

have been removed by the central's workinen, but these are of no danger 1o

the operation unless a full investigation is made of one of these unusual con-

nections.

During the past project years no such Investigation has been under-

raken, and no susplcion of the LIFEAT themen has been revealed to date.

As for the past few years the telephone company is continuing its efforts toward

modernizatlos of the Mexico City telephone sysiem. This effort includes

chunging from overhead lines io underground cables, cleaning off of the

unused overhead "dead lines" and Installation of new equipment throughout

the city.

These innovations will continue to cause security problems for the

LIFEAT complex, but it is belleyed that theie problems are rot insurmountable.

To meet this challange lo LIFEAT security and to propare for the day when

access to ¿elephone distribution lines Is further reduced by their placement

in underground cables, LIFEAT has recently succeeded in having one of its

IInenien (LIFEUD-2) selected to arrend a four month special course in cable

work. When he completes this course (in July 1962), LIFEUD-2 will have

working access to all cableways and cable termination boards in Mexico City.

This access will be Invaluable from both the present security and operational

standpoints as well as for the future when LIFEAT will be forced to tap directly

from the underground telephone cables. Ay a standard procedure the LIFEAT

personnel continuously work to devise new methods to Increase security, as

well as train in security procedures, so as to continue the high level of security

•15.

Training

Initial training of new personnel and continuing refresher training for the ex-

perienced personnel are handled primarily by the "outside" case officer, David

M. WILSTED. Minor repair aud maintenance of equipnient as well as emergency

security procedures are stressed and continually reviewed with the agents.

16. Equipment and Support

As noted in last year's renewal request, LIFEAT equipment la generally old

and much of lt is now obsolete.

With funds provided in last year's renewal,

LIFEAT (within the past mont:) has begun to acquire some new equipment,

particularly audio recorderg. A revlew of the equipment situation in the

LIFEAT setup has convincid both WILSTED and the sesponsible Case Officer

that a near-complete.moderntzation.program uf the equipment used In

LIFEAT must be undertaken during the coming project year.

The local

KURIOT technician has on a number of ocasslong expressed his amazement

at the superlor product produced by LIFEAT with the nut moded and anclent

equipment (In terma of use hours) which the LIFEAT complex had to rely on.

Therefore, with the funds requested In Part Il of this renewal request.

LIFEAT should be completely equipped with adequate gear, particularly audio

and dial tape recorders, by the expiration of PY 1953. Admittedly, there ls

Involved large, one-time expenses In complete replacement of such expenalve

"emy during a single project year. However, It la a necessary move. due

entlrely o great wear borne by the cquipment. This wear is now causing such

a rash of breakdowns that the outside principal agent must spend a dlspropor-

Ilonate amount of his time in maintenance work.

17. Timetable

LIFEAT has been in almost constant operation since lis Incepilon in January

1951, and u8 a vital Station operational support asset, lt is planned to continue

I8 Indefinitely.

18. Estimated Costa

Tie following are the estimated costa for Piscal Year 1962.

All figures are

U.S, dollars por year ($US 1.00 equals 12, 50 Mexican pesos). Changes In

cailmated costs for parulcular lica will be nured. Thege reflect not only the

continued Inflarionary trend in the Mexican economy, but also the shift in op-

erational emphasis from prime coverage of sover/Satellice activities lo sup-

pore of Station operatlong. In this latter case particular line coverage ls of

shorter duration, causing greater expense in Installation and removal of tap

Ilner and crosses. In the agent salary category toral expense In contract

agent salartes has been reduced somewhat, due primarily to dropping certain

contract agents, while expenses for fleld agent category has risen, due to

the granting during past project year of long overdue salary raises to all but

shree LIFEAT fleld agents.

H. Counter-Intelligence Inforination

CI/CE matters continued to constitute a major potion of the

Mexico City Station's priority objectives during the review period.

Projec LIFEAT was able to provide a substantial contribution to the

attainment of these objectives. Of particular note in this respect has

been coverage provided on known Communist Party members,

especially valuable being thai provided on Juan Luis CAJPOS Villalobos.

1. Operational Leads and Support Provided Other Starion Operarions

During the period covered by this project review, LIFEAT. continued

to support the Mexico City Station through its timely production of leads

which were especially useful, and in most cases essential, in assuring

the success of other Station operations.. The following is a list,

necessarily selective, of the use made of leads from, and support of

other projects rendered by Project LIFEAT.

*: LIFEAT/LIMERICK: 1) Of special note is the support pro-

vided to the Station's AEIMPULSE operation. Leads and

information rendered by LIFEAT enabled the responsible

Case Officer to prepare adequately for this recruitment attempt

of an officer of the Soviet Embassy. Following the actual

attempt, LIFEAT/LIMERICK was used as a security device

to protect the Scation assets employed in the operation.

2) As

notcd in 11. (5) above, Project LIMES. was provided with

continuing support by Project LIFEAT. Notabie a mong the

Information and leads provided were those concerning specific

properties which the Soviets were interested in renting and/or

3) LIFEAT has provided a check on double-agent

LITARDY-l, giving verifica: ion of his acrivities and contacts.

A similar check has also been provided on the activities of

Informant LIPAGAN-1.

LIFEAT/LIVERY: 1) This phase of LIFEAT closely

supported the projected LITACIT physical pene ration operation

almed at the LIVERY establishment in Mexico City. LIFEAT

provided essential information on the rosiers of night duty

officers as well as background information on the target.

2) LIFEAT/LIVERY provided support for the inscallation of

rechnical survelllance againsi LITACH. Withou the information

rovided by LIFEAT, this operation would have been extremel

azardous at best, and probably would have been entirel

impossible..

## Page 72

-@-

LIFEAT/LITMUS: 1) LIFEAT provided information which

lead to the successiul recrultment of agent BEYAN who was

in a position to provide Informacion on BESOOT. 2) LITMUS

leads also lead to the attempted, but unsuccessfu!, recruit-

ment of one

I, belteved to have been a contact of

Polish officials in Mexico. 3) LIFEAT leads also lead to the

surveillance of a clandestine meering of Alexander BEKIER,

Polish Counselor uf Legation in Mexico. Due to the advance

notice of the meeting given by LIFEAT, MKCHARITY was

given time to plan technical coverage of the mecting and

prepare especially fabricated equipment for this coverage.

4) LIFEAT was also responsible for the discovery of the

location of a Polish Intelligence basehouse.

This information

was operationally important to the responsible Case Officer.

LIFEAT/LIERODE: In this phase of the LIFEAT project

leads have been most rewarding in terns of agents actually..

recruited and operations supported by LIFEAT provided

information. !:) LIERODE produced leads which were

directly responsible for the recruitment of agents LITANCO-1 "

and LITAMIL-3, while providing security check and information

which have increased the value of agent LITANGO. 2) The

defections of LITAINT-1 and LITAG- 1 were greatly aided by

LIFEAT leads and information.

The internal reaction to

the defections in the target establishment were also readily

available through LIFEAT, 3) At present LIERODE is

providing coverage, both from a security and informational

activities.

successful in providing information which has enabled the

Station to identify nearly all the Cuban agents operating in

Mexico.

. Due to the increasing importance of the Cuban target,

inese revelations are of utmost importance.

Coverage of a Cl/CE natue was provided by LIFEAT targeted

against a recruited member of the Mexican Communis: Party,

and has produced leads on semi-clandestine travel of party

members behind the Iron Curtain, as well as providing a check

on the veracity of the agent.

Project LIFEAT has been emploved also in supwart a che car

highly sensitive LIEMIT operation.

J. Conclusion

It is the opinion of the Mexico City Station that the support provided

to other Station operations, the CE informa: ion obtained, and the positive

intelligence gathered by Project LIFEAT well justify the expenditure of

KUBARK assets in terms of funds, personnel, time ad security risk.

The information produced by this operation has materiaily contributed to

several priority objectives of the Station's Related Mission Directive.

K. There is a tached herewith a complete list of HMMs produced from

LIFEAT provided material during the period July 1959 through May 1960.

(See attached sheet.)

Progress of the Operation

Since the Project LIFEAT objectives are unique in that they are of

a continuing najure and not designed to he fulfilled within a given period,

no statistics can be cited from which a percentage of coverage on each

objective can be calculated. A general indication can be given of the

coverage provided by the projeci when it is noted that approximately

15, 000 pages of raw texi were provided in the July 1959 to May 1900 period.

LIFEAT has been in daily operation during the review period with the

number of lines covered varying from 12 to 18. Generally, these can be

broken down as follows:

Soviet Embassy

§ lines

Polish Legation and Polish

Counseler

Czech Legation (Embassy)

2 lines (Coverage suspended

January '60 for reason

given in I. B above)

American Communists

2 lines

Cuban Emcassy

3 lines

Targets of Opportunity

3 lines

Planning for the Future

Following the suggestion and guidance provided by Headquarters when

renewing Project LIFEAT for FY 1950, the Station plans to limit its

overage to no more than twenty lines at any given time, with the possible

xception of targets of opportunity which could be covered for short periods

STONET / KAPC.

Iv.

Vi.

in addition to the normal coverage.

The coverage of Soviet and Satellite

installaions wili remain basic to LIFEAT and will be exploited to the

maximum degree possible. Due to the increased importance of Information

on Cuban acrivities, coverage of the Cuban Embassy and personnel staffing

the Embassy will be increased during the coming project year. Targets of

Opportunity will continue to be exploited as permitted by personnel,

equipment, and access limitations

Performance of Agents

The general overall performance of the agents employed under LIFEAT

continued to be good with security being stressed in all phases of the

operation, No security problems were encountered which were not readily

solved by the personnel concerned, Since a high degree of security is

required for the operation of LIFEAT, It, is planned that any possible

agent candidaies will be thoroughly screened and Headquarters clearance

obtained before they are in any way approached for operational use.

Expenditures During the Period Under Revlew

Approval for the renewal of Project LIFEAT was granted on 16 July

1959, for the period 1 July 1959 through 30 June 1960, In the amount of

$123, 830. Th its continuing atompi to provide practied ecuany without

teerersing operationat efficienty, Station Meried yu'its the itemized

proposed LIFEAT budget for Fy 1961 fenntained in the tached Fleld

Project Outrine, Part H) in the imount of StH, AH, a recherton of approx

knately $19,000 from the previono year'o typroved budget.

Status of Commitments

There are no commitments other than those provided for in the

project outline submitted herewith and the individual contracts of several

LIFEAT personnel.

Ideology and financial galn.

A secondary factor is the fear of reprisal

from the local police should discovery aceur.

Training.

Initial training of new personnel and refresher training for

experienced agents is handled primarily by the outside case officer, David
