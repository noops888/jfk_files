1, Station fully agrees with Headquarters concerning the value of
concentrating LIFEAT or LIENVOY coverage on suspected and/or known
Soviet, Satellite and Cuban agents residing in Mexico City, The Station
in the pact has undertaxen this type coverage and will continue such
coverage in the future as LIFEAT and LIENVOY facilities become avail
able for assignment to these targets. As Headquarters is aware, thie Station
can and will cover any possible target Headquarters considers of high
enough priority to cover.

2. For éxample, Carmen BRUFAU Civit was covered for 1956, 1957,
1960 and 1901; the results were not considered of sufficient value to continue

the coverage.

PROJECT REVIEW

L. Product of the Project

A, Soviet Coverage : o

As noted In last year's Project LIFEAT renewal request, LIFEAT coverage
of the offictal Sovict Lastallation was discontinued on 22 June 1960 when the
parallel llalson project LIENVOY assumed coverage of this target, In early
January 1962 LIFEAT undertook coverage of the home phones of three of the
most active Soviet Intelligence officers, This wis in response to the con-
tinuing Station Cl program which includes the monitoring of Sov let contacts,
i and the guidance recetved from KUDESK Staff at the time of the last LIFEAT
renewal, As of this date, thls coverage bas not been active for sufficlent
ume to fully evaluate Its usefulness, However, It is belleved that such
coverage has the potential to add matertally to the Station's effort tn the Cl
field, Although not designed to provide positive intelligence, some by-product
of this type has been obtained, Samples are as follows:

HMM-6364, 8 May 1962 (Briefing of Mexican Pro-Marxist Journallst
by Soviet Embassy)

HMM-6382, 15 May 1962 (Mexican Traveller to the USSR)

HMM-6376, 11 May 1962(Refutation of Rumors that Soviet Cosmonaut

TITOV will visit Mexico)

B, Polish Embassy

LIFEAT has remained the primary source of information on this target and the
only successful,. continuing penetration of the target, The information provided
to the Interested Case Officer has in the pas: been described as “unique” and
“Invaluable”, This description holds with equal emphasis for the present ag
well as the past, Selective examples of the valuable positive intelligence pro-
duct of this coverage are: a

C. Cuban Coverage

LIFEAT was able to provide coverage of major firms dealing in U,S. goods
transshipment via Mexico to Cuba, This technical operation not only pro-
vided initlal leads which alerted the Statlon to these companies, but also
was able to provide continuing {Information on the daily activities of the com-
panies Involved, Coverage of certain Cubin personages arranging for Ulegal

D. ‘American Communists in Mexico

‘As in the past, most of the targets in this group have been covered at the
‘request of ODENVY, and the raw-take has been partially processed by them,
During the period Juty 1961 through May 1962, approximately 680 reels of
take were passed <o local ODENVY for their processing. The most valuable
information gleaned from the targets in this field continues to deal with con-
tacts, travel, and general activities of the American Communist Group in

Mexico (ACGM).

E, Exile and Revolutionary Activities

LIFEAT continues to provide information on the exile and revolutionary groups

- active in Mexico, which information is of the greatest value to the Station and
not available from other sources, The emphasis of the LIFEAT effort in this
area has been directed toward coverage of Nicaraguan, Guatemalan, and more
recently Spanish Republican exiles, The product has been most rewarding in this
coverage, Examples of productivity in this past project year:

By its latest Related Mission Directlve, Mexico City Station's major respon-

- provide a-valuable contribution in the attainment of the Station's objectives. in
~ this ‘field. ‘Coverage included that on Carlos Humberto ILLESCAS, who is

. Operational Support and Leads Provided other Station Operations

During the past project year LIFEAT continued actively supporting Mexico City
Station through production of leads unobtainable through other assets and gen-
erally providing other Station operations the secure support only available
through a unilateral telephone tap operation, Th2 following Is a selected List,
together with a brief description, of major contributions of operational support
and leads provided through LIFEAT:

“She”



LUFEAT/Cuban: The,mos: noteworthy LIFEAT. contribution to Station efforts
in the Cuban operations field was that of providing leads pinpointing the acti-
vities of Transcontinental, S.A, in the illegal transshipment of U.S, materials
to Cuba via Mexico, LIFEAT was able to continue coverage of the activities
of this company despite the efforts of the company to lose itself in the Mexican
business community by changing the name ‘It operated under to Inversiones
Mexicanas, ‘S.A. and changing its location and telephone number, Valuable
information on the commercial commodities needed by the Castro regime,
methods and contacts used in their procurement, and ‘information on the con-
tacts of the Cuban Embassy in Mexico were obtained,

LIFEAT/Czechoslovakian: LIFEAT coverage of the home phones of two Czech
intelligence officers provided some leads to their contacts, but more impor-
tantly, provided greater security to KUBAR K when oité of tleir CIS officers,
Miloslav CECH, was sirigled out for a defection attempt, . Through LIFEAT
“Livemonttoring” cf both the original and followup defection attempts, the “
KUBARK assets were provided maximum protection from possible attempts

by CECH to alert his coworkers or arrange entrapmeat of the KUBARK per-
sonnel Involved,

LIFEAT/Polish: Probably the mos: "classic" example of the use of a telephone
tap in providing a tead which could develop into a vital peaetration of the Polish
intelligence occurred recently in the BEKNAVE/BECHICK operation, LIFEAT
provided the initial leads ‘which made the Station aware of the possibilities of an
operation and has continued to provide vital information for Station's develop-

ment of the operation, It is the Station's opinion that this one instance of service

by LIFEAT was well worth the cost of the entire project for the year, (Full
information forwarded in MEX1 0462 and MEXI 0463), Also of great interest
to the Station were the LIFEAT provided leads which revealed Jan SLUSARZ,
Attache of the Polish Embassy in Mexico, had purchased an automobile which
had been stolen in the U.S, and driven to Mexico, In this operation, in which
a defection attempt was considered, LIFEAT provided aot only the initial leads,
but also daily operational information vital to the S:ation's efforts in this case.

LIFEAT/ Yugoslavian: In this coverage of the Yugoslavian Embassy LIFEAT is
providing the basic data necessary in establishing operations against this target,
Since the Station is expanding its coverage of Yugoslavian activities, much vital
data on personalities, contacis, and services obtained by the target establish-
ment must be provided, It is this exact type of coverage that LIFEAT is geared
to provide in addition to the operational leads which will be forthcoming as this
coverage progresses. The interested case officer, noting LIFEAT is his only
present source of information, feels the take which LIFEAT provides and wil

>

s


pees

continue to.provide in this area is vital and basic to the mounting of any

operations ’against the Yugoslav target.

LIFEAT/Soviet/Double Agent: LIFEAT support has provided needed sup-
porting information in backing Stat ion double agent operations, In this area
the success of the operation is obviously dependent upon the veracity of the
agent. CIFEAT provides information which enables the interested case ~
officer to determine the veracity of the agent involved, LIFEAT also provides
a needed check upon the activities of the double agent,

LIFEAT/Spanish Republican: LIFEAT coverage of Spanish Republican exiles

in Mexico City have enabled the Station to monitor the activities of the various
groupings of the exiles, including the projected attempt on the life of the

senior ODACID official in Mexico, LIFEAT has covered personalities of exile
factions both involves in planning this attempt and those opposed to it. Coverage
of targets in this area also enables che Station to keep abreast of the plans and
activities ofthe various groups which make up the Spanish i rachael exile
community In Mexico City.

LIFEAT/CI-CE Coverage: LIFEAT leads in this area are exploited in the-re-
porting of travel of important Communists, particularly to Cuba and Iron ==
Curtain countries, and the travel of U.S, citizens, cspecially Communists and
Leftists, to Cuba, Through coverage of the American Communist Group in
Mexico (ACGM) LIFEAT has provided ODENVY with an increasing amount of
information on the leftist activitles of relatives and friends of the ACGM who
reside inthe U.S. One of the noteable items in this regard is providing data

on the overt and covert efforts of the blacklisted “Hollywood Ten" to regain their
former status in the U.S, film industry,

Finally, and certainly not of least importance, Station security has beenenhanced
through LIFEAT periodic coverage cf-former Station assets, like LIVESTOCK-1
and LIVESTOCK-2, who could be a danger to particular Station operations or
personnel, Monitoring of certain terminated agents is considered especially
valuable where these agents were involved in the more sensitive operations,

Conclusion

It is the opinion of the Mexico City Station that the support provided other Station
operations, the Cl/CE tnformation and leads, and the ability of the unilateral
LIFEAT operation to cover sensitive targets without revealing Station interest



“has ‘besn joted in the past, that even with the Station's ‘8
el; but liaison, LIENVOY operation, a change in
aitieude by the:present cic government administration or a change-in govern-
ment adminiscrations. could end KUBARK participation tn that liaison project,

For that reason, ‘EAT, in addition to maintaining its present-heavy coverage,
must be‘available’to once again undertake’ coverage of the official Soviet and
Czech official targets tn “Mexico City. Therefore, LIFEAT's present orientation,
though toward supporting Station Operations and CI/CE mission rather than toward
targets which would provide positive intelligence, leaves it readily available for™
recall into the Soviet-Czech coverage. * It is the Station's firm opinion that the
LIFEAT pr oject provides a’stbstantlal and vital contribution in fulfilling the
several priority objectives of the Station's Related Mission Directive,

‘I. “ Thére tg attached a lst of the HMMs produced from LIFEAT provided material

prime responsibility of providing support to Station operations, 7

IL Progress of the Operation

The objectives of the LIFEAT Project are of a continuing nature and are there-
fore not considered for fulfillment during any given period of time, For this
reason percentage figures as to compleilon of project objectives cannot be drawn,
However, an indication of the coverage provided in working toward fulfillment
of the objectives can be noted in that 14,000 pages of raw text were produced
in the period July 1961 through May 1962, LIFEAT has been in daily operation

’ during the review period with the average number of lines covered per month
being 20, with a high in March 1962 of 28 lines covered,

U1. Planning for the Future

As was indicated at the time of the last project renewal, LIFEAT hopes to re-
main uncommitted to coverages that require the expenditure of 4 great portion

of LIFEAT resources but provide coverage of but one target... such as Soviet
Embassy coverage. It is added emphatically, however, that should the need arise
for LIFEAT to again assume such responsibilities, it is fully able to do so,

Uatil' such time LIFEAT will continue to enjoy greater flexibility in the employ-
ment of its assets, especially ia the areas in which the Station does not wish to
reveal its interest or operations to the-liaison: forces involved in the LIENVOY

operation,

As to particular areas of operations, the Station has hopes of employing
LIFEAT assets in “hot mike operations which require access to telephone

— i



centrals afd cables, The feasibility of using LIFEAT in this type of operation

- has already been proven, tna recent operation with the LIERODE installation

~ "ag a'target. Seven reels of "hat mike" take were obraliied in test runs on
checking both the operation (Including installation of the "miked" instrument
in the:office-of the ‘head of the LIERODE official installation) and che equipment
which was of radical-design and conceived and bullt’ by the KURIOT techni¢lan
assigned to Mexico City Station under deep cover. Unfortunately, before con-
tinuous operation could'get underway, the LIERODE installation decided upon
complete renovation of its telephone system, including the Installation of a
switchboard, This, at least temporarily, precludes further operation against
this particular target, unless a direct line ig inscalled there, However, it is
the Intention of the Station to attempt coverage of other targets of Interest, In
these plans LIFEAT plays the key role in installation, line and serles cross.

* maintenance, bas¢ehouse procurément and maintenance, and Pproceasing of take,
From the brief test runs vila the LIERODE operation noted above, it is believed
that "hot mike" operations, supported and maintained by LIFEAT, can greatly ald
the Station in its coverage of responsibilities under its present Related Mission

Directive,

IV, Performance of Agents

The overall performance of all agents employed in the LIFEAT complex con-
tinued to be good during the pertod of the project review, with security being
stressed In all phases of the operation, No security problems were encountered
which were not solved by the personncl involved, Since the success of the
LIFEAT operation depends largely upon the security of its personnel, Head-
quarters clearances and evaluation of new personnct will continue to be sought
on those new additions who pass a strict ficld assessment.

Vv. Expenditures

Approval for renewal of Project LIFEAT was granted 8 September 1961 for F¥
1962 in the amount of $98,973.09, The proposed budget for FY 1963 is broken

down in the attached Field Project Outline Renewal Request, Part II, and totals
HOR 65-08 FPR-OD! yy oe eo

Vi. Status of Commitments

There are no commitments other than those noted in the project outline submitted
herewith and in the individuals contracts and oral agreements (memoranda of
oral agreements were forwarded as necessary) of the various LIFEAT personnel,



Even .aow «with the shift of operational emphasts to Station ‘operations support,
» tt ig thought significant to include a ‘list of HMM's produced through April
1962 (10 months of the project year) as a by-product in the LIFEAT operation,

LD Area of Operations

This operation ig run-from' Mexico City Station and is concerned with targets
located within Mexico City,

; 2. Purpose

The purpose of this project Is to provide, unilaterally, daily Informacion on the 7
: activities of offictal foreign installations In Mexico and the personnel thereof, ae
as well as coverage of the activities of sclecied Individuals and groups In response
“te 9 Fg Both Station needs and Headquarters requests, Presently, LIFEAT stresses
flexibility of coverage with support of Station operationg and C//CE coverage | pent ok

receiving the greatest emphasis,

3. Background

Project LIFEAT was ortginated on 3-October 1950 as a unilateral telephoné'tap
operation, Actual Initiation of operations under this authority occurred on 18
January 1951, and the operation has run continuow..ly from that date, The pro-
Ject was opened with the ins:allation of a single tap and has grown In the past
eleven years to coverage of as, many as thirty lines in.a given month,

The LIFEAT Project ts a unilateral operation completely independent from any
llalgon arrangement. It ts staffed by KUBARK contract employees with the ma-
jority of personnel betng Indigenous controlled agents,

During the past eleven years, Project LIFEAT has prodiiced more than 83, 500
(estimate) pages of operational and intelligence Information ta direct support of
Mexico City Station's specific objectives, and contributed matertally to the in-
telligence gathering activities connected with the Sovlet-Satellite Bloc and more
recently with the Cuban representatives in Mexico, In addition, LIFEAT has
been of considerable value in monitoring the activities of the American Communtst
Group in Mexico (ACGM), as well as the activitles of the exile groups and local

Communists,


With the ‘LIENVOY’ 8 assumption, of coverage of. the “Soviet and Czechoslovakian
official installations in July 1960, LIFEAT assets were released from continuous
coverage:of.these two-targets, These asséts. were then employed tn direct
support of Station operations--a role: {deally suited for a unilateral operation
such a8 LIFEAT, and extremely important to the security and success of
Station operations, LIFEAT, after spending much of Project Year 1961 - 1962
programing to this new role and redirecting Its assets, has now ddjusted to

this role and ls fully employed in this vital assignment, °

Personnel
a, Career and Contract Agents

(1) David M, WILSTED (201-009195), principal "outside" Case Officer.

(2) Wayne C, DRABAND-(201-255095), outside assistant to David

M. WILSTED, DRABAND was introduced into the LIFEAT opera-

tion in Noveniber 1961 as a replacement for Ralph B, RAFANELLI

who was transferred from Mexico PCS in the fall of 1961. His OA

was amended 14 November 1961 to cover his use in the LIFEAT

Project, Although DRABAND possessed only limited knowledge of

clandestine activity when first employed, under WILSTED's instruc-

tion and Case Officer guidance, plus his own willingness and capacity

for work, it appears he will prove a valuable eae to the

LIFEAT complex, a

Olivia N, GLADMON (201-117751), LIFEAT processor, has given
notice that duc to her planned return to the Untted States for
necessary eye surgery during June 1962, her employment with
LIFEAT must be terminated, Agent quit-claim and secrecy
agreement have been executed,

Leona C, GANDARA (201-225710), employed by LIFEAT only
for standby support during the past year and one half, now
* is employed for support and clerical work for MKCHARITY,

LIFEUD-20, (formerly LIMITATION-5), (201- 102308), and
LIFEUD-21, formerly LIMI'TA'TION-6 (201-117981) will be-ter-
minated as of the end of the present LIFEAT project year (30
June 1962), Plans for use of this couple as haschousekeepers
were cancelled when LIFEUD- 22 and LIFEUD-23, who are more
desirable chotces, became avatlable for LIFEAT use, Ter-
mination has been discussed fully with these indigenous agents,
and cermination arrangements were accomplished on a friendly
and mutually agreeable basis (as in all LIFEAT terminations,
separation ty made on the basis of Mexican custom and/or law).

. Operational Clearances

See Section 9 above,

Cover

There are no changes in the cover of personnel who have been previously em- _
ployed tn the LIFEAT operation, With the new agents employed since the last

Project renewa.

}

-16-

la retired U.S. civil
servant presently in Mexico with his wife, an employee of
aU.S. government agency,

b, LIEMBRACE-8 has natural cover of a retired U.S. businesaman
of many years residence in Mexico City,

¢, LIFEUD-22 has natural cover of a Cuban extle employed by a
Mexican firm tn Mexico City, He works regular hours at his
cover employment und partakes in LIFEAT activitles before
and after work and during lunch hours,

d, LIFEUD-23, the mother of LIFEUD-22, has natural cover of
housekeeper for her.son and performs her LIFEAT dutles ~
only in their home,

12, Contact and Communications

Daily contact Is maintained between the Case Officer and the agents employed in
the project, These contacts are made in a clandeetine manner with varying
patterns established for car pickups, foot contucta, and cmergency meetings,
Pre-arranged signals are employed in setting and accomplishing the mectings, |
When heavy or bulky matertal is to be passed, mectings are held at night, En-"
trance to the basehouses by other than the basehousekeeperg is made only on the
basis of strict necessity; such as need for equipment repatr, installation for
new line coverages, or ne coverage cut off,

Telephone contact concerning the project and with the agents ts kept to a min-
imum, Pre-arranged open code Is used for phone conversations between Case
Officers and agenta, Alternate and emergency communications have becn arranged
and are reviewed frequently by the personnel using them,

These systems of contact and communication appear suitable for the project
and function adequately from the security and utility standpoints, Locations and
tlmes of meetings are reviewed periodically and are changed frequently to decrease
the possibility of arousing the suspicions of the residenis of areas in which meet-

ings are held,

Control and Motivation

Control and motivation are primarily based on two factors: ideology and
financial gain, A secondary factor Is the fear of reprisal from the local
police should discovery occur,

Security LO

During the pas: project year there were no Incidents which were beyond the
capability of the personnel Immediately involved to isolate and remedy tm-
mediately, In contrast to previous years, there was no instance of telephone
work crews approaching a basehouse to check or reinove the tap lines running
to that baschouse, Some of the "crosses" made In the telephone centrala
have been removed by the central's workinen, but these are of no danger to
the operation unlegs a full Investigation ls made of one of these unusual con-
nections, During the past project years no such Investigation has been under-
taken, and no suspicton of the LIFEAT iinemea has been revealed to date.

As for the past few years the telephone company Is continulng its efforts toward
modernization of the Mexico City telephone system, This effort includes
changing from overhead lines :o underground cables, cleaning off of the

unused overhead “dead lines" and Installation of new equipment throughout

the city, These Innovations will continue to cause security problems for the
LIFEAT complex, but it is belleved that these problems are rot insurmountable,
To meet this challange to LIFEAT security and to prepare for the day whea
access to telephone distribution lines (s further reduced by their placement

in underground cables, LIFEAT has recently succeeded In having one of its
linemen (LIFEUD-2) selected to attend a four month special course In cable
work, When he completes this course (in July 1962), LIFEUD-2 will have
working access to all cableways and cable termination boards in Mexico City,
This access will be tnvaluable from both the present security and operational
standpoints as well as for the future when LIFEAT will be forced to tap directly
from the underground telephone cables, As a standard procedure the LIFEAT
personnel continuously work to devise new methods to increase security, as
well as train in security procedures, so as to continue ihe high level of security

enjoyed by LIFEAT in the past.

Training

Initial tratning of new personnel and continuing refresher training for the ex-
perienced personnel are handled primarily by the “outside” case officer, David
M, WILSTED, Minor repair aud maintenance of equipment as well as emergency
security procedures are stressed and continually reviewed with the agents,

2:16. Equipment .and Support

As noted In last year's renewal request, LIFEAT equipment tsa generally old
and much of it is now obsolete, With funds provided in last year's renewal,
LIPEAT (within the past month) has begun to acquire some new equipment,
particularly audio recorders, A review of the cquipment situation In the
LIFEAT sctup has convinced both WILSTED and the responsible Case Officer
that a near-complete-modernization.program of the cquipment used tn
LIFEAT must be undertaken during the coming project year, The tocal
KURIOT technician has on a number of ocasslons expressed his amazement
atthe supertor product produced by LIFEAT with the outmoded and anclent
equipment (in terms of use hours) which the LIFEA‘T complex had to rely on,
Therefore, with the funds requested in Part II of this renewal request, :
~ ou ss = = L TREAT should Be Gompletély equipped with adequate gear, particularly audio
and dial tape recorders, by the expiration of PY 1963, Admittedly, there ts
Involved large, one-time expenses {n complete replacement of such expensive ~~ °
ttems during a single project year, However, It is a necessary move, due”
entirely to great wear borne by the equipment, This wear ts now causing such
a rash of breakdowns that the outside principal agent must spend a dlspropor-
Uonate amount of his time in maintenance work,

2. Staff comments on the Project renewal request were:

a) WUTVEE/OPS eaid that the Staticn is to be commended on its hand-
ling of the requested Bloc coverage by LIENVOY while maintaining LIFEAT
capability and limiting coverage to those lines most profitable. KUTUBE _
noted tho increased exphasis on exploitation of operational information.
In order to continue this sspect of the operation, tho Station is faced
with the difficult problem of selectivity in targeting and processing
take from these tvo lerge projects. Evory possible effort should be mde
to inerease the efficiency of processing to maintain LIFEAT at ite present
'8E/OPS'a opinion, LIFEAT personnel and capability must
maintained in fsce of. the easier but less secure LIENVOT.

b) KUDESK atated that this unilateral asset should be continued do-
spite the fact that wo are runing a ainiler operation with the local gov-
ermmont. : It is hoped that the Station 111 soon be able to use this asset
in the investigation ‘of individuals know to be in clandestine contact
with tho RIS, for the purpose of determining whether or not they may be
recruited. é

c) KUTUBE/D notes that the project has been of high value.

3. Attached for the information of the Station is,a copy of the memorandum

I, Operational Leads and Support Provided Other Statioa Operations

During the period covered by this project review, LIFEAT.continued
to support the Mexico City Station through its timely production of leads
which were especially useful, and in most cases essential, in assuring
the success of other Station operations, . The following is a list,
necessarily selective, of the use made of leads from, and support of
other projects rendered by Project LIFEAT,

~ cee steers ot EEPEAT/LIMERICK? 1) Of special note is the support pro-
vided to the Station's AEIMPULSE operation. Leads and
information rendered by LIFEAT enabled the responsible
Case Officer to prepare adequately for this recruitment attempt
of an officer of the Soviet Embassy, Following the actual
attempt, LIFEAT/LIMERICK was used as a security device
to protect the Scation assets employed in the operation. 2) AS
noted in LA. (5) above, Project LIMESA was provided with
continuing support by Project LIFEAT, Notable amoag the
information and leads provided were those concerning specific
properties which the Soviets were interested in renting and/or
buying, 3) LIFEAT has provided a check on doudle-agent
LITARDY-I, giving verification of his activities and contacts,
A similar check has also been provided on the activities of
informant LIPAGAN-L,

LIFEAT/LIVERY: 1) This phase of LIFEAT closely
supported the projected LITACIT physical penetratioa operation
aimed at the LIVERY establishment in Mexico City, LIFEAT
provided essential information on the rosters of night duty
officers as well as background information on the target,
2) LIFEAT/LIVERY provided support for the installation of

1 technical survetllauce against LITACH, Withou: the information
provided by LIFEAT, this operation would have been extremely
hazardous at best, and a> veut have been entirely
impossible. ih ne



PN eee eae eeierteL ‘ i

LIFE f T/LITMUS:: 1) LIFEAT provided information which,
lead to the successiul:récrultment of ageiit BEYAN who:was"

. ina position.to provide Informazion on BESOOT, 2) LITMUS -
ae ae leads‘also-lead to the attempted, but unsuccessful, recruit-
aaa + ment of ore! |, bélleved to have been a'contact of
Polish officials in Mexico, 3) LIFEAT leads also lead to the
surveillance of a clandestine meeting of Alexander BEKIER,
Polish Counselor of Legation in Mexico, Due to the advance
notice of the meeting given by LIFEAT, MKCHARITY was.
given time to plana technical coverage of the mecting ant
prepare especially fabricated equipment for this coverage,

4) LIFEAT was also responsible for the discovery of the wt
location of a Polish Intelligence basehouse, This information
was operationally important to the responsible Case Officer,

LIFEAT/LIERODE: In this phase of the LIFEAT project

leads have been most rewarding in terms of agents actually.
recruited and operations supported by LIFEAT provided
information, -}) LIERODE produced leads which were
directly responsible for the recruitment of agents LITANGO-1
aad LITAMIL-3, while providing security check and information
which have increased the valuc of agent LITANGO. 2) The
defections of LITAINT-1 aad LITAG-1 were greatly aided by
LIFEAT leads and information. The internal reaction to

the defections in the target establishment were also readily
available through LIFEAT, 3) At present LIERODE is
providing coverage, both from a security and informational
standpoint, of the attempt to place a recruited agent as
Mexico-based advisor to a high official of the Cuban Intelli-
gence, This operation is largely dependent upon LIFEAT
leads and support for security coverage of the agent's
activities. 4) LIFEAT/LIERODE has been unusually
successful in providing information which has enabled the
Station to identify nearly all the Cuban agents operating 'n
Mexico, Due to the increasing importance of the Cuban target,
these revelations are of utmost importance,

Coverage of a CI/CE nature was provided by LIFEAT targeted’
against a recruited member of the Mexican Commuaist Party,
aad has produced leads on semi-clandestine travel of patty
members behind the Iron Curtain, a3 well as providing a check
on the veracity of the agent.

Project LIFEAT has been employed also in syppact of tha rye -y

~ J. “Conclusion *

~ It is-the opinion of the Mexico City Station that the support provided
to other Station operations, the CE informa:ton obtained, and the positive
intelligence gathered by Project LIFEAT well justify the expenditure of
KUBARK assets in terms of funds, personnel, time aad security risk,
The information produced by this operation has materiaily corrributed to
several priority objectives of the Station's Related Mission Directive,

K. There is a:tached herewith a complete list of HMMs produced from
LIFEAT provided material during the period July 1959 through May 1960,

. (See attached sheet.)

Progress of the ration

Since the Project LIFEAT objectives are untque in that they are.of
@ continuing nature and not designed to be fulfilled within a given period,
no statistics can be cited from which a percentage of coverage on each
objective can be calculated. A general indication can be given of the
coverage provided by the project when it is noted that approximately
15, COO pages of raw tex: were provided in the July 1959 to May 1960 period,
LIFEAT has been in daily operation during the review period with the
number of lines covered varying from 12 to 18. Generally, these can be
broken down as follows:

Soviet Embassy 5 lines
Polish Legation and Polish .
Counselor 3 lines

Czech Legation (Embassy) 2lines (Coverage suspended
January '60 for reason
given in 1, B above)

Americaa Communists 2 linea

Cubaa Embassy 3 lines

Targets of Opportunity 3 tines

Planning for the Future

Following the suggestion and guidance provided by Headquarters when
renewing Project LIFEAT for FY 1950, the Station plans to limit its
coverage to no more than twenty lines at any given time, with the possible
exception of targets of opportunity which could be covered for short periods

equipment, and access limitations, - eect

Performance of Agents

The general overall performance of the agents employed under LIFEAT
continued to be good with security being stressed in all phases of the
operation, No security problems were encountered which were not readily
solved by the personnel concemed, Since-a high degree of sécurity is
¥equired for the operation of LIFEAT, tt, is planned that any possible
agent candidates will be thoroughly screened and Headquarters clearance
obtained before they are in any way approached for operational use,

~ Expenditures During the Period Under Review

Approval for the renewal of Project LIFEAT was granted on 16 July

any Halson arrangement, It is staffed by KUBARK staff and contract employees a
with a substantial number of local indigenous controlled agents, !

During the past nine years, Pcoject LIFEAT has produced more thin
64, 000 pages of operational and intelligence information in direct support of the
Mexico City Station's objectives spectiically, and has contributed materially to the
intelligence gathering activities connected with the Soviet and Satellite Bioc, In
addition,.Project LIFEAT has been of considerable value and assistance in
monitoring the activities of the American Communist community residing in Mexicu

Ctty as well as activities of Cubans and exiles in Mexico,

12, Contact and Communicattons

a, Daily contact is matntatned between the Case Officers and the
agents in this project. These contacts are made. in a clandestine manner
with varing patterns established tor car pickups, foot contacts, and
emergency meetings. Pre-arranged signals are employed in setting and .
accomplishing the meetings, When heavy or bulky material is to be passed,
meetings are held at night, All movement in and out of the basehouses by
the Case Officers and Principle Agents is done in cars ostensibly owned by
agents, except in the case of LIVERY basehouse where the agents are too
old to drive, One of the ind:genous agents is used to contact LIVERY base,

made only in great eméryencies.

_.. b,* Telephone contact conc eming the project and with the agents
ts kept toa minimum, Pre-arranged open code is used for phone
conversations between Case Officers aad agents,

c, Alternate and emergency signals have been arranged and are
reviewed frequently by the personnel using them, .

d, These systems of contact and communication appear suitable
for the project and function adequately from a security viewpoint,
Locations and times of meetings are reviewed periodically and are

Control and motivation are primarily based on two factors:
Ideology and financial gain. A secondary factor Is the fear of reprisal
from the local police should discovery occur,

Tratning

Initial tratning of new personel and refresher traning for
experlenced agents is handled primarily by the outside case officer, David
M, WILSTED, Minor repair and maintainaace of equipment as well as
emergency security procedures are stressed and continually reviewed
with the agents,

Equipment and Support _

It la believed that much of the technical equipment upon which the
continued successful collection of LIFEAT material depends will require
replacement in the near future, The !argest percentage of this equipment
has been in nearly conztnuous operation from the initiation of the project
in January 195! and much of this equipment ts no longer being manufactured.
When present limited commercial stecks of replacement parts are
exhausted, new units will be required for LIFEAT,

- 1. The LLFEAT Project renew subnttted in HA-12936 was approved on

“16 July 1959 for the period 1-July 3959 through 30 June 1960 for a total of

~ $123,830 for fiscal year. 1960... The Station will-note that monies requested

for the support of “oodrdw D.-GABBOT? (pa) were subtracted from the raquest

made by the Station for pfoject funds. cAB Oi; is suprorted by the 3€S400TH
Projest, an BB suport project.

2. The following staff coments were nade when the iruject was submitted
for apcrovalt

f a. "ROM has continued its rating of "C" on the disseminated positive
information frua the Froject, noting a slight increase in the disseminations,
and comenting that it provides interesting information to customers on the
nature ana extent of Bloe comercial activities in Kidco, data useful in
economic ausiyscs, and reports on exile activities in Haxico.

b. *KUTUBE/D recomended renewal of LIFZAT observing that the leads
produced by the operaticn have been of operational value to LAURICLE
activitivs conducted in Mexico Ulty in the pas’ year. KUTUDS/D comments
alco that the Project hae afforded acd can be expected to continue to afford
C% rrotection from time to time for activities of particular LAURICL! interest.

c. “KYTUDH/IPS has observed that Froject LIF“AT has been a most useful
operational assut in the Mexico City Station for the rast nine years,
gontinuously providing KUSAR( with a window into inportant targets. KUTUSE/OP3
requests that the next project renewal coint out what agent recruitments by
the Station favo resulted from or been supported by the operational information|
secured by the project. ce

4. "KUDESK commented tiat 1t well known that Mexico is being used by
the x15 as a base for third country operations directed against the United
States. Over a ceriod of years LIFEAT has supplied valuable leads which
have resulted in the identification of a large nunber of persons in elandestino
contact with RIS officers; further investigation in several cases produced
information whieh strongly indicated that the persons involved wore
actively assisting the RIS, hile such information is, of itself, of. interest
and importance, cur respcnsibil:ty in the CI field imposes the obligation to
determine wiint those persons are doing for the RIS and this can ce done only
by recruitiny, and-doubling thes. it 1a-therefore sugrested that LIFFAT leads
and reports of investigations based on tien be reviewed for the purpose of
selecting a limited number of the nore promising targets. liereafter, Station
acsets including LIF'AT should be used to obtain the overat ional, data
necessary to determine that a target is recruitable, and then a pitch should
be made. Much tire and effort will be required for such a program, but the
potential rewards fully justify it, and the value of LIFrAT, as a CI asset,
will be materially increased. :

3. Chief, KUTUMR, in recomending the Project for reneval to Deputy Director,

—- KUBARK;- requested: that-at-the-tina of the next: Project’ renewal; the Division stoula”|~
review the relationshin and coordination of Project LIfy:AT operations with those

b. The lack of development and exploitation of leads from LIFEAT

to Headquartere on the exploitation of operational leads, it has been
difficult to state whether the leeds are being fol:owed up, who the
targets are, and whether consideration is beirg given to recruitment
aporoaches. Headquarters requests that in each monthly sumary. the
Station supely aore info under the secticu labeled "Exvloitation of

followed up by other Station assets” is meaningless vithout some
exolanatinn of the lead follow ups. iiead.uarters would like to now

Conclusion

the uexico city station believes that the produt of the LIFEAT
Project measured against the expenditure of KUBARK assets in terms
of personne?, tim, security risks and funds well justifies its
renewal. Tne inforsation produced by this operation has materially
contributed to several priority objectives of the Station's Related
Mission pirective. eden

2 Progress af the operation

Definite progress nas been made in reporting cn the cbJoctives of the
LIFEAT Project. However, since LIFEAT objectives are of a continuing nature
and ere not designed to be achieved, no statistics can be cited as to the
porventage of coverage on each objective. a general indication of the
‘coverage can be derived wien it is realized that some 10,000 pages uf raw
text: in 10 months are the direct result of the operation from which the
‘statistics cited above were derived. Except for a period in July snd
Avgust 1958, following the ternination af members of the James O- AYCALL
family, LIFEAT has been in daily operation with’ some 17-16 lines being
covered. These my be broken dom as follows,

Soviot Enbassy 5 lines
Czech Legation 2 lines(movac during this period and only in
operation for approimtely 2 months)
Polish Legation 3 linee(third installed in april 1959)
American Communists 3 lines
