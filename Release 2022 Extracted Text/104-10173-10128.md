SUBJECT: Peport of It. Hunt on Hest Coast Training

TO:

The Directör, oss

Rial

The report of lt. E. No Hunt, Jr:, Als of the Secretariat; on

the west coast trainine has been analyzed and the statements rade therein

thoroughly irvestigated.

2. The report will be discussed by paragraphs:

A. (1) The complaint of lack of coordination in arrivals at

the vest coast cannot be laid at the door of Schools li Trainine.

Branches

are notified when and there personnel must report and arrangements for

transportaiion are made by them.

(2) le (3) At the time of It funtes ráriva? at the west coast.

there was a certain amount. of confusion.

This has now been corrected and

clothing is issued to students on Friday night if they arrive in time for

thia to be done..

(4) ? (5)

The situation referred to in these tro paragraphs

with the boat crews presentls available, it 1s not

possible to run a boat on Sundays.. It may be pessible to sent departing:

students to the mainland on Saturday afternoons after they conplete their

"course.

This rould necessitate getting rooms for them for Saturday night

1n los Angeles; which is complicated by the fact that the los Angeles office

closes at three o'clock on Saturday afternoons. It is desirable that new

students arrive at the island on Saturdys in order to set orlented over the

weekend and be ready to atart training on londay morning. The croided con

ditions over the week-end referred to by It. Hunt were not due to the fact

that departin students do not leave unil Londay, as the turnover is not

creat enough; the crowding la cased by the fact that the schocl 1s runung

at full capacity and because shortage of station complement personnel makes "

the allocation of quarters to ner arrivals difficult. & hotel locetor

sisten has now been instituted miich has to some extent remedied the

situation

e. (1) It. Huntes suzgestion that the baste course could be cut by

several days gives no specific recommendations. an examiration of the

schedule of the course shows that the trainiro is as concentrated as possible.

Ve prefer to accept the jurinent of the trcinine officers os the various'

branches on this point rather than a general' statement by

one junior officer

of a non-operatinal brarch.

(8) 2(9)

It is necessary to have both officers and enlisted

sen in the same class and it is curlously impossible to design a course to

meet all intellectual levels.

Every effort has been made to strike a happy

redius that will do the greatest bood to the createst number...

He feel It

only fair to the school to say that It. Hunt has demonstrated hirself to be

very rank conscloug in these and other coments in his report.

It. ghould

also be noted that in this clags there mere a number of jedburghs (both

officers and men) nho had lived together at achool and in the field for

caiy months.

laturally there was a cameraderle among officers and men,

which apparently It. lunt could not understard, It has

also hech reported

that he was subjected to a good deal of malading" by the son. and s.lo

nethers of the class because he was non operational.

His complaints about

the conduct of officers and men and his objection to associating with

onlisted men doubtless spring from these sources.

c. (1) It is adaitted trat the recreational lecilsties are limited

but there is not much time for recreation and what facilitles there are are

uned to the best novantege. schools& Training feels that we were very son

tunate in being able to establish (after long regotiationg) a brench of the

¡ny Lotion Picture Service at Me.

The result is that a small store is maintained of whatever

necessities can be purchased in the market.

There are ample rediro facilities for all personnel with s

sufficient supply of newspapers and ragazines.

(2) The situation with reference to the condition of the harracks

has been remedied by daily inspections. Offenders are required to climb the

Fountain in off hours.

:...?

(3): This paragraph again reflects It. Junt's rank conscicusness;

his lack of understanding of the relationship

of officers and men who have

been on operations together, and his discomfort at the "kicding" he received.

(li) It 1s the policy of the school that there be no saluting with-

in the ares.

The arei. is small and too crowded for any benefit to accrue

fron the continuous arm waving which mould to necessary if saluting were

required.

(5)

This complaint is definitely just. Steps have been taken to

insure the privacy of mail in the future.

3.

In conclusion I wish to state. that the Schools& Treining Branch

velcomes ary constructive eriticisa and regularly receives reports from other

branches prepared by their students. He then sit down with the branch repre

sentatives and endeavor to iron out difficulties and improve courses and

conditions at the school in line with constructive suggestions.

1: I would like to suggest that in the case of art future reports,

Er. Sulloway take them un first with tlie Schools and Träining Branch as is

the custon of the other branches.

Bo Curriculum

1) Based on my experiance with the "14 day" basie

course, it appears that a re-examination

of the student schedule,

aimed at a more concentrated schooling and a decrease in the over-

lapping nature of subjects taught, could cut the basic period by

several days.

This resulted in a splitting of the class into

sections; and confusion of schedules among the instruetors, caus-

ing their non-appearance at scheduled hours - not an Infrequent

occurrence:

On several occasions; instructors spoke for as

little as 10 minutes

of a scheduled hour, dismissing the class

for the reminder of the hour. (This lecture material might be

coordinated with other lectures, thus cutting down on the number

of training hours scheduled on paper.)

Officers were bored in many cases by elementary methods of
