WCIC, the curriculum at Santa Catalina (Detachment. WA), and _
general coments concerning the Detachment.

: 1) There séens-to be a. lack of coordination con=
H cerning the arrival and departure -of officers and EM at. Los
Angeles, Newport Beach, and WA. Navy enlisted men (5 in number) , ;
were flow to Los ‘Angeles from Washington while the majority of ~*~
: argy aa Navy officers ‘made the trip by slow train (londay=

quarters without regard.to ranks {

»from 0700 until departure: of the boat at approximately

aot

: morning:
0900,° causing crowding and confusion at a difficult time. Friday
evening would perhaps be a better period for such issue.

See 4) -Although. classes are not :scheduled’ to begin *
- Until Monday, student groups spend the weekend on Catalina. under

‘crowded conditions, because previous student groups. do not. leave
“until Monday.. “This situation is brought. about by: abserice of
boat transportation to and from the Astand on Sunday. a

(although academics end. on‘Saturdays) it is‘necessary to spénd

an additional 24 hours in Los -Afigéles waiting for scheduled train

-estimated 6 days of tudent time might be saved ‘the gvernnont.

1) . Based on ny experience with the “a4 day" basic. zi
course, it appears that: a re-examination of the student schedule, aa
aimed at a more concentrated schooling and a decrease in the over= E :

3) | This’ resulted th a splitting of the class into wee
sections, and conftision of schedules among the instructors, caus-
ing their non-appearance at ‘scheduled hours = not an infrequent
occurrence. \

4) On several: occasions; instructors spoxe for as yor
little as 10 minutes of a scheduled hour, dismissing the class = ©
for the resainder of the hour, (This lecture. material might be |
coordinated with other lectures, thus cutting down on the number
_of ‘training ‘hours scheduled on: paper.) i i i

5) Training films, shown each evening broke’ up
student leisure time to such an extent that many students ex-
pressed a desire to attend classes in the evenings as well,
perhaps from 1900-2100 or even) later, 7

sereeet 6) The physical ‘hardening program came abruptly
and then was abandoned for as much as two days, only to be under= \o-
taken again with greater vigor... Many ‘students suggested that
the hardening phase be. administered every day in the form of a

dndiscriminately with EM, which had a deleterious effect upon
the already low standard or military discipline,

unknown. This is eithér a result of Detachment. policy, or lack- + .
of concern on the part of the responsible officers. é

5) censoring of officers’ mail had an adverse.

: considerably when the censor: (as gp) punished a group of officers’
whohad. written their wives.that they were avoiding PT in the z
mornings. -This information was used by the officer as OD from
