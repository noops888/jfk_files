1. Per instruction of the Deputy Chief, Security Research
Staff, the following is a summary of information concerning several
individuals who had been PNG'd from the USSK. This information
was extracted from a FIOB memorandum dated 20 January 1971,
Subject: TOON, Malcalm, #412 916, (A-226).

2. One paragraph in the referenced memorandum reflects
that various news media such as the Sunday Star, dated 30 May 1965,
as well as the wire services publicised the naming of two American
diplomats in Moscow as CIA spies by Nedelya, the illustrated weekly
supplement of Izvestia. Nedelya contained an article entitled "Spy -
Mania and Naked Kings" on American Embassy spy activities. The article
concentrated its attack on Mr. Malcolm TOON as the supervisor of sev-
eral individuals who are known to be PNG'd from the USSR. These indi-
viduals are listed as follows:
