On 5/5/69, source advised that CARLOS MARCELLO

had raceived a letter from CONNIE CAROLLO requesting money

from CARLOS and he instructed his secretary to make out a

$500 check to some church or religious order and had her

send it to the CAROLLOS.

He then tore up the letter froin

CAROLLO so source did not have a chance to examine it.

On. 5/15/69 source advised that on 5/13/69 CARLOS

MARCELLO had gone to Baton Rouge, La., for an important meeting

with unknown individuals and source does not know the purpose

SMITH's extradition order to California yesterday and NOFIO

sur the extra tien

He noted that the Governor had signed DALTON

PECORA had requested CARLOS to intercede for DALTON SMITH to

prevent extradition, and this may have been the reason for the

trip.

However, CARLOS told source that he only called

MARSHALL BROWN

and BROWN told him there was nothing he could

do for SMITH.

Source advised that yesterday CARLOS went with his

CPA, JOHN CONNALLY, to meet with some people about the

prospective purchase of Commander's Palace.

Source advised that they are making a deal with the

successors to the Churchhill Farms Estate to buy approximately

500 acres of land adjacent to Churchhill Farms, and all of

the neirs stock in Churchhill Farms Estates were $100,000.

CARLOS is getting a loan from WILSON ABRAHAM for $100,000

which

amounts to advance payment by WILSON ABRAHAM of some 200,000

odd dollars, which represents the purchase price of a piece of

land that he recently bought from CARLOS MARCELLO.

Source advised that JACK WASSERMAN has reservations

at the Royal Orleans Hotel for 6/1/69 and has requested a

complete transcript of the comments made by KOHN and NEFF at

the Metropolitan Crime Commission luncheon, as he is conten-

plating suing one or both.
