i Subject was far less interested in explanation than a decision. He rhetorically
asked whether he was acceptable, adding he was obliged to assume he was not, and
commenting that although there are "many two legged people in America also” he
thought he was probably a unique perscm from the point cf view of language ability,
experience as an.cperator in dangerous situations, etc. We replied thus: One man
(the psychologist) ‘has already come’all! the way from the States Just to see Subject
and another was cn:his way.: From this subject could fairly conclude the importance
“Headquarters” attaches to Subject's candidature and that far from being a dead
isSue, Subject's prospects were good, although all depended on him. ‘

we then turned to the matter of Subject coming to Paris. Subject explained
that Paul ( : ) had’been sent by. the Paris. station
to Annick: and had not done very well. He had failed to convince Annick ‘that he was
sent by Mike (Friganza).and apparently although we did net go incc the details of
this, he did net get the message straight. In any case Subject imiediately said
that he could come to Paris anytime although he would be cbliged to travel
illegally. Tats bepause he hae peraltted his Identity document to expire as of 14
February 1959 ever, Subject feit could make the Journey by train without
being caught because thé police are not checking most trains, He did not want to

a personal ideal. He regards his father as a very independent person,
‘kind but profoundly selfish, but who would nevertheless give you the

family and was happy when he saw others happy. However, Subject is con-

brother learnéd that. subject was seeing a girl whom he knew. The brother

that it was often necessary in life to “swallow” a gréat:deal ‘of useless

stuff" so that thereafter certain essential ‘problems’ could be more easily
digested. Subject feels that these professors were superior and that he
understood them, whereas he regarded’ the others as apparentiy idiotic

or worthless.

23. Subject was’ influenced by heroes whom he heard about such a3
Lindbergh, Edison, Hitler, Einstein, and several others. He realized that
tf such people existed, it meant that the possibility to act either for
go0d or for evil alsé existed. -He did not identify with any one hero in
particular but: aivays wished that he’ could have been one of them. He did
not actually want to be one of them, but wanted to resemble heroes in
general. Subject always retaine-- remembers certain great men mentioned
in history. He feéls that these great men gave him the concept that a
certain order was necessary for the level of the people. However, 1t
appears He was distllusioried-in these men and his ideals-were shaken be-
cause he later. earned to his:dismay that they could: commit “abject or
mofistrous acts. “Subject feels he has Gade many wistakes in life but how~
ever big these mistakes may be, he does not feel they have reflected his
basic character.. He feels that his character was basically based by the

as regards his relationship with his mother. He regards women as allogical

and to be determined by a psycho-feminine education. This 1s enough to

27. Subject claims he has learned from his personal experience in
life rather than from the experience of others. In other words he has
educated himself: in the school of life and has derived little from ‘the
actual formal schéol situation. For example, he claims his mother's _ -‘
opinions had importance only at the time she was rendering Hier opinténs;

thereafter they were not influential as far as he was concerned. This

wanted to withdraw from the whole deal by saying "if my mother learned of
this, she would dié." They postponed the Job indefinitely. However, his
mother died-in the meantime and his triend again approached him and told
him that now that his mother was dead, there was no longer such a danger.

Subsequently they knocked over the jewelry store.

Sequence. If he were’to find himself again In the same situation, he would
Prepare an escape even.if it were only necessary for the satisfactory
planning of the project.
39. However, the question which arises in this examiner's mind is
why Subject panicked in his flight. It could have been that he un.
consciously wanted to.get caught and to be punished in. order to relieve
his guilt. If this 1s so;.then tmportant cons!deration should be given
spect of Subject’s personality as regards planning the project.

Consequently, even when he was. broke, Subject always ‘believed there was a

and optimism,
43. As regards his philosophy on the two projects which involved
Liberating French priscners and the bank attack, he was betrayed by

that his mistakes have seriously reduced his circumstances of life, but he

‘Him. Consequently, it isftkely that she did things for him, but she did
“things ‘with him-for herself. In other words, she wanted him to-be perfect
é that he cdilld be worthy of her love. He was not perfect, probably did
not obtain her love, and consequently 1s continually seeking the love of
other persons. However, he cannot accept this fact as regards his mother
and denies she did not act in his interest. one of his chief defenses ia

48. Subject's actions are often impulsive: and unreasoned. Such

irrational behaviour usually takes place with another perscn despite the

fact that ‘there may be no particular tie or.afféction-between him aid the | 7

from what he'1s ‘now. However, he feelé his material situation will have
improved. He does not mean financially but socially. He ‘naively hopes
that the workd w.11 change and there will be no discrimination, He also
hopes to acquire, if necessary, a nationality in which case he will feel

Sl. Despite’the fact that this man ts motivated by rather vivid
ideals, he still strikes the examiner as a‘ practical real{st who thinks

To illustrate his feeling further.he {s of the opinion th

55. In describing himself Subject reveals that he always tries his
hardest to Keep his promises. He also:feels that he sometimes appears to
talk somewhat rashly- but ne feels this Is.due to-the fact ‘that he thinks’
fast’ and-he is able to seg quickly the components and the essence of. a

69... This man'dehies that’ he has ony interest’ or emotional
attachment to France at this time. Homevér, it 1s likely he was patriotic
at the time of the war. Since he has been branded @ criminal. and has
been deprived of certain rights and privileges, he now perhaps feels re-
Jected and in turn ts rejecting France as his fatherland. Nevertheless,
he strikes the examinér’as’ a true Frenchman -- he thinks and feels tke a
Frenchman and 18 certainly not a Russian‘in his personality. It is likely
that he identifies the French authorities with the police. He cannot
tolerate rejecting attitudes. He is like an outsider who {s looting in. : oa
It may be: he has the "sour grapes” attitude by. which he feels that since

fie cannot have what he wants, it is not too good anyway.

60. Subject is not a planner. Despite his interest in invention =;
and the fact that-he has pulled off a number of capers, he is.more of an
instigator, a leader, and ai-executor. In order for him to be successful

in future projects, it 1s hecessary. that someone else plan and then tell
him exactly what to. do. :

61. Subject is currently involved in the invention business which
he started alone. He 18 the owner and exploiter of several patents and
certain persons are financially and’technically interested in his in-
ventions. He is faced witha problem at this time. He is involved in
the initial and preliminary phases with us and consequently-{s put on

66. Subject is a narcissistic character who féels that because’ others

love with himself and acts accordingly.
= 67. Subject tends to rationalize and to offer socially acceptable
reasons for his individualistic behavior.

68. subject strives chiefly for emotional satisfaction.

6. Subject is Af altruistic but at the same time he 1s selfish. He
will do things for the community with the hope of getting. something out of
it for himself. Both.of these drives merge in a unitary fashion. He 1s
motivated by both at the samé time. :

70. Subject denies nationalistic motives for his acttons and prefers

to regard them as being primarily himanttarian. "Subject 1s action-oriented
and loves to take risk and gets a kick out of excitement and adventure



dtionalities, ‘tut ‘are determined by a vague desire'to help others who’
need.it. This combination can mislead him and get him into difficulty;
for example, his accomplice in the bank robbery. .

75. Subject is a rank individualist. He is a non-conformist.
However, he realizes he must cope with the community, must sacrifice for
the of the community, and must not harm others. In this
regard it 1a unlikely that Subject has ever conmitted:physical assault,
nor is it likely that he would in the future. No matter what the‘ other :
person is or represents to Subject, he is still a human being whom i

Subject respects.
76. Although Subject is basically an exhibitionist, he 1s not
nelined to bragging or to exhibit himself in a transparent or patent
fashion, He 13 too sophisticated. However, he needs attention end ts

71. .AS was previously mentioned, Subject helped French. prisoners
get back: to France during the war. He thought it was the right thing to
do but did not do it Just for France. , He was paid for it but he gave
his money to help the prisoners. In terms of his hierarchy of motives,
it 1s likely that this person acts according to what he considers to be

in onder to have others feel greatful to him. Ho haa thé’ attitude he
should be punished for deing wrong, but should not be degraiied for doing
right. Subject has always ‘realized that-he has needed help as regards

hia emotional problems. He Likes to be helped matertally, not asvand it~
self.(?) but because material help involves ‘the implication of moral

help. For example, a dentist in Gap offerfed to help Subject in his in-
Ventions without asking for advantages. This means a lot to Subject. He
attaches small importance to money and he derives a tremendous satisfaction

out of helping others or being helped.

84. Subject reflects a tremendous vitality that. has, in the past,
expressed itself through false attempts such as the bank robbery, etc.
He-feels he is not being used as he should and that there isa power
within himself, a creative urge of movement, a power of realization.
‘Its highly emotionally charged and he feels he is. capable. of doing much
more than he has in the past. Although he feels he is’ a, duplicated
person, he.does’ not feel he ts difficult, to understand.

85. Subject likes to act intelligently and’ sensibly. He strives

for effictency. For exampie, haxtaxx if-a‘persoh were to ask him to open
a window, he féels it is up to him to décide as regards the proper method.

‘The efficiency plus the results are his rewards. Consequently, he likes

practical work which involves an intellectual effort.



He’ needs:the guiding influence of

88. ‘Another important aspect of his relationship with us appears to
be the fact that he consciously or unconsciously feels he has "arrived"
and ia-acceptable to us. In otlier. words he feels that perhaps a decision
has-been made which is in his favor. This réflects hia om desire to'be
accepted together with his estimation of the situation,

89. This individual, despite his past exploits, is not necessarily.
a hostile person. In other words he will not: do harm nor will he hurt
others who are weaker than himself. He will act.out of exigency but he
will deliberately avoid being sadistic or wantonly cruel.

90. - For some reason Subject’ exhibits
and isolation at this tim

marked degree of loneliness
He ‘seems to be seeking ccupsntonship,

91. Subject prefers to work alone as regards technical research, but
as regards the execution of an operation he prefers to be with someone or
Bart of an organization. He knows he can‘rely upon himself when he is
alone and that others had been unreliable in his:past. However, if it is
necessary for him to work with two or more individuals, he will accept it.

92. Subject -admits of physical inferiority feelings by virtue of his
size and strength but he denies he has feelings of intellectual inferiority.
He. depends more upon his mental faculties than upon his physical. "I have
no fear of an elephant if I have a gun.”

complemented by training.

97. Subject relies quite heavily upon humor for relief of tension
and as_a defense: against the development of anxiety and inter-personal
relationshfps.

98. An important aspect of this man's personality and history would
appear to be his so-called accident pronéness. He 1s like the cat in the
Disney film who, while chasing thé mouse and having his entire attention
directed to the catching and incorporation of the mouse, inadvertantly
His first reaction to being splattered

gets himself run over by a truck.
by the truck is one of disappointment as regards not. arriving’ at the goal;
1 eatching the-mouse.- He thereupon acts“upon feelings of revenge on

the’ mouse for having caused -his unfortunate accident. . In addition, this

“example signifies that subject is likely to keep his eye too much upon the

geal: and- insufficiently upon the hazards involved in reaching the goal. It
may be argued that Subject's philospphy in his past operations are related
in some manner to his lack of attention to such details. His history is
that of the unlucky cat who manages to get himself run over successfully.

99. This person can be quite discomposed by the surprise of un-
expected occurrences.

100. Despite defeat Subject 1s able to pick himself up, figure things
out, start all over in a more systematic way, and continue. in his pursuit
of his-goal. Consequently, he does learn by experience. His mistakes are

102, Subject is likely to be loyal to a superior and may even be:
critical of himself in relation to. the supericr. ‘In other words, he wotild
Like to be as useful as possible in order to-express his loyalty, but may

feel inadequate in that he requires the protection of his superior.

103. This person puts no stock in‘emblems or signs of rank or
reputation. He regards such signs as identifying labels only and is not
impressed or motivated for glory symbols. If he were to accomplish an
outstanding feat, he would not want a medal -- all he would want ‘was a
remark’ from. an important figure to the effect "well done, thank you.”

He feels it is sufficient only for him to know he has ‘done wells -

104. Subject will attempt to assume leadership on the team but
it may be that if his partner is ‘superior, he would be a better follower
than he would bea leader of a.less adequate person. He is-more of a
dependent than independent person in terms.of his inter-personal relation-
ships; furthermore, he acts on sentiment and impulse and consequently

his judgment is questionable. This would indicate thst he would work
better with a more soher-minded, calculating-individual. He is likely

from AEPADDIE. Ee vas recruited in April 1959 by the Frankfurt Station,

sone unlmown ‘reason he.was moved. from jail to jail, conéerftration camp to
concentration camp. While in prison he resorted to a "ruse de guerre"
and told the Germans his father had invented a motor that could.run ~

“without gasoline. He offeréd to draw the designs of the motor and was

able to stall long enough to be berated by components of the advan-
cing U.S. Army. :

B. In 1946-47 subject and an accomplice committed two robberies of
Jewelry stores.

C, In 1949. subject robbed a tank of 1,000,000 Fr. fr. His accomplice

5. Security:

Tae agent 1s very security conscious and will folloy auy direction
in the interest of secuirty i

6. Control:

On this point here are several aspects for consideration. He is
under contract to us and &lthough'he 48 not too interested in money, he
does enjoy ite benefits and realizes that it will continue so long as
he does.a good Job. The more. important built in control is the fact
that he will be under. false documents, and being stateless, he is com-
pletely dependent ‘on KUBARK to: perpetuate his quasi legal existence ana
to eventually legalize his status. Added to this is the control vhich
stems from the prospect of: resettlement in ancther country. This vould
give hin status as a citizen. Realizing these points, subject is nore
than willing to play ball with us.

7. Prior contacts with any security service:

As stated in 3B (2) above, the only brush subject hac had in the
Past.was with Gestapo and French police. - These were prior to his re-
cruitment by KUBARK and vere not as a result of I.S. activity.

8. Training of agent:

fe -had received training in covert black border operations. In ad-
dition, he is being trained in small arns and demolition.

: paid off, WIROGUE is to keep the profits he may nake.

He will initially transfer $1000.00 to a bank in Leopoldville. we
are certain that he will not sbscond with the funds, since hie docu-
mentation will be false and his ray and allowances total $8500 per
cnun, he would therefore stand to lose a great deal more than he would
gain.

Being a contract agent, there is ample control if he shows signs of
spending too much tine in the pursult of profits from his cover business.

ae His salary and allowances will be paid in part to a personal account
in Switzerland (separate from his-business account). This money will
ostensibly also represent his savings. The remainder vill be paid
directly atthe station.

C. Security Estimate:

WIROGUE had beén recruited in France and exfiltrated black from West
een ra _ Germany to SR/DOB. fe has had no known I.S. connections in the past. He
. willbe eurfaced in West Geranny and will proceed to Leopoldville. He
will be documented as an Austrian .

4. Background

The need for various technicians to stabilize the chaotic conditions in
Leoroldville coupled vith an urgent need for controlled assets in that city gave
rise to this project.. WIROGUB's particular talents, experience, ability and
training open up a wide varietyof possibilities.

anticipated to take several month; Hence he-will become operational in carly
191. However, it fs’ reasonable to expect that the station will undoubtedly
place him'in covert role mich éooner. Nonetheless, we do not anticipate any FI

take prior to inid i961.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD.

SUBJECT: ° Mexican Resettlement Arrangements for AESENTINEL
agent, AEASPIC -

1, At 1400 hours, 19 August, SR/DOB ¢ase officer;

Fred Kirkpatrick and from Defection Coordinators
: Officé.of CLA met with Clay Calendar ___ lof TSD/1B
re-documentations arrangements and travél routing for possible”
resettlement of AESENTINEL agent AEASPIC. The following
arrangements were proposed by Mr. Calendar,
for SR/DOB's consideration. TSD/IB suggested that Subject be
sent by black flight from here to West Germany, and there
surfaced with an altered Greck passport which TSD/IB now has
available. A suitable cover story would of course be incorporated
re the possession of a Greek passport-by Subject, while Subject
has no Greek language capability. Since this passport is a valid
one, (and was, in fact, purchased by TSD/IB) and is therefore

. backstopped in name, Subject could apply at the Mexican Embassy
in West Germany for a Mexican tourist visa by presenting this
passport. Once in Mexico, Subject could request emigration
action upon declaration of intent ‘to become a Mexican citizen and
upon submitting proof of sponsorship by an employer in Mexico

_ City.

2, Upon your concurrence,|_______]will arrange for
Mr. Kirkpatrick to meet with _____], the CIA contact used
for introducing agency designees into Mexican private industry.
has already talked. with on two occasions
and has passed him Subject's file. From their talks,
has assured me that this arrangement is entirely feasible, Gillete
Company of Mexico City being cited as one possibility.

3.. AEASPIC would then openly proceed to purchase plane
tickets in West Germany for Mexico City and upon arrival there,
would be waiting for him: The time table for this entire operation
was estimated at about five weeks. Of course we did not discuss
Subject's monetary maintenance for the interim period of travel,
hor until Subject could begin earning his own living.

FAL 235477


-2-

4.0 expressed his concern and the concern
of Mr. Pennington of Alien Affairs Staff about the knowledgibility
of Subject re pass. Agency tie-in and. Agency assets. It will of
course be our job to assure Security that Subject is not knowledgable
. and Will entail‘a minimum of.risk,to-trahsport and to resettle in
“Mexico.” In-view of this\concern; all arrangements offered fer
DOB's consideration by TSD/IB were tailored to afford step by
:Step denial or participation by.the U. S. Government. In effect,
‘all items procured by Subject for resettiement could just-as
. ‘easily.be-obtained:on:the European black market ag well as from
this‘Government. «Subject will in effect be briefed and taken by
i eet _ -German:Station asset to. obtain his documents ostensibly on the
: a ~ Black market. Monies due Subject would be. withheld pending
destination arrival. The letter head and Supporting sponsorship
documents to be used by. hit for ultimate employment in Mexico
would be prepared in such a manner.as to be either legitimate or
forged. In addition it was suggested that Subject be closely
handled and advised by someone known to him to ensure the
security aspect both'to Subject and to this agency.

oe 5. The meeting was closed by TSD/IB's request to be
informed whether these arrangements in theory meet with the
i approval of SR/DOB, and Office of Security, Mr. Kirkpatrick
was assured that Documentation aspects by TSD/IB could be
accomplished within one week upon authorization by SR/DOB.
With your permission Fred Kirkpatrick will proceed to affirm
Mexican employment arrangements for AEASPIC,

quickly except for the beach == and still we could not. go very far because of the
guerrilless In short, apart from going out to lunch, I stayed,so to speak, :

shuttered up in ny room waiting for the return of my lord and moter, T tried :
to Go awinming-alone,lut the city and the beach vere full of soldiere ond I gave
up quickly. You cannot imagine,I think what 1t's like to eat clone as a vonan
