April 23, 1955, Vancouver, British Columbia, to Frederick W.

They resided, as of July, 1955, at 3717 - 2oth Place,

Seattle, Washington.

According to the same source, Valentina Belobrodski

was employed by the Soviet Purchasing Commission in Vancouver,

from May 31, 1946, until February, 1947. She performed secre-

tarial duties for

three Soviet officials, oneof whom (S. G

[ukianov) has been subsequently positively identifed as a

Soviet intelligence agent.

The source reported in November,

1946, that the Belobrodski family had long been connected

with

the Russian Workers and Farmers Club and its successor

the Federation of Russian Canadians. Belobrodski was report

ed to be on the Board of Directors of the Canadian Soviet

Friendship Council.

In 1950, source reported that

Miss Belobrodski was secretary in the sales branch of the

American Can Company. Her brother Walter was reportedly a

member of the Polish Democratic Association, a Communist

controlled organization.

Her parents, John and Pauline

were also reportedly active in the same organization.

was reported that Miss

Belobrodski admitted former membership

In the Canadian Soviet Friendship League and also the Federation

of Russian Canadians for cultural and social purposes, in 1950.

She denied connection with the Canadian Soviet Friendship

League at that time.

She also denied knowledge of Lukianov's

intelligence activities.

that Walter' Belobrodski is a member of the Labor-Progressive

Party (Communist).

Valentina Belobrodski applied for permission to

enter the United States in 1946. In 1950 she visited the

United States at the death of her brother, John Thomas

Bielobrocki in Chicago, Illinois, May 30, 1950.
