Our files reflect that according to a source which
has furnished reliable information in the past, Valentina
Belobrodski was born February 12, 1923, and was married
April 23, 1955, Vancouver, British Columbia, to Frederick WwW.
Onick. They resided, as of July, 1955, at 3717 - 26th Place,
Seattle, Washington.

According to the same source, Valentina Belobrodski
was employed by the Soviet Purchasing Commission in Vancouver,
from May 31, 1946, until February, 1947. She performed secre-
tarial duties for three Soviet officials, oneof whom
Lukianov) has been subsequently positively identifed as a
Sovtet intelligence agent. The source reported in November,
194.6, that the Belobrodski family. had long been connected
with the Russian Workers and Farmers Club and its successor
the Federation of Russian Canadians. Belobrodski was report-
ed to be on the Board of Directors of the Canadian Soviet
Friendship Council. In 1950, source reported that
Miss Belobrodski was secretary in the sales branch of the
American Can Company. Her brother Walter was reportedly a
member of the Polish Democratic Association, a Communist
controlled organization. Her parents, John and Pauline
were also reportedly active in the same organization. It
was reported that Miss Belobrodski admitted former membership
in the Canadian Soviet Friendship League and also the Federation
of Russian Canadians for cultural and social purposes, in 1950.
She denied connection with the Canadian Soviet Friendship
League at that time. She also denied knowledge of Lukianov's
intelligence activities. In 1955 the same source reported
that Walter’ Belobrodski is a member of the Labor-Progressive
Party (Communist).

Valentina Belobrodski applied for permission to
enter the United States in 1946. In 1950 she visited the
| United States at the death of her brother, John Thomas
| Bielobrocki in Chicago, Illinois, May 30, 1950.
