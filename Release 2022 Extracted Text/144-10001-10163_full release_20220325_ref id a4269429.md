MEMORAÑDUM FOR THE RECORD

13 December 1978

SUBJECT-

Records Search for the Select Committee on Assassinations.

1:

C(1 Pm men 1978 133. (Mr. Baldwin) received a call fron G8

(Mr. Parish) concerning retrieval of Information from Stored Records

(1142) In the discussion with Mr. Harold Parish, Chief, G809, it was

learned that he was preparing a response to Mr. Sapp, Legislative Affairs

(D]), concerning information given to the House Assassinations Committee.

According to Parish, thescommittee was reviewing a claim by a former Air

Force sergeant that traffic from international commercial links eminating

out of Portugal was intercepted and was forwarded in 1963 from his

assigned duty station at USA-55 (Kirknewton, Scotland) to NSA; that he •

recalls a 1963 intercepted item reflecting a possible assassination

attempt on President Kennedy. The Committee Staff requested NSA to make a :

search to determine if the 1963 files on the alleged message exists.

2:

(U) According to Mr. Parish traffic from USA-55 would not have

been forwarded for retirement to the Agency Records Center. (This eliminates

that organization as a possible file location.)

3.

(U) Ms. Joanne Stepp (B109) was requested to, and did provide

the Bl Stored Records Listing (Bl listings were to be searched because.

that organization is the predecessor of G8, and traffic from USA-55

would have been received by Bl during 1963. • This procedure takes into

consideration the possibility that files stored under the Bl designator

in 1962 may not have been redesignated.)

4.

(U) On this same date, a brief meeting was held in the Legislative

Affairs Office to review the status and discuss the appropriate procedures

for this records search effort..

Those in

attendance were:

Eugene Yeates, Chief, Legislative Affairs

Edwin Sapp, Legislative Affairs

Don Wigglesworth, Chief, N33. Agency Records Officer

Carrol Baldwin, N33

Jack Butler, G809

The following points were made at. this meeting:

. 1

a.

(U) Retired Records Storage was ruled out as a possible

location since intercept traffic is not forwarded to the center as

record material for long term or permanent retention.

b. (U) Bl Stored Records. Listings have been reviewed. While

no specific description relating to subject/station location appears

in the listings of 1963 files, there were three boxes of 1963 files not

identified by

subject.

C.

(U) It was agreed by-those present that a review of the documents

these three unidentified boxes would constitute a reasonable effort to

ind the alleged record!

(0) On 13 November,

Mr. Butler-and Mr. Baldwin reviewed the contents

of the three 1963 boxes, specifically looking for 1963 messages from USA-55: 2

There were no files that directly or indirectly referred in any way to

President Kennedy.:

The latest date in the box was 1962. This information

was passed on to the Legislative Affairs Office.

6. (U) On 16 November 1978 Mr. Sapp discussed with Mr. Wigglesworth

the proposed written response to the Committee.

This response reflects

that a reasonable search was made and no such record was found.

(U) On 21 November 1978 Mr. Sapp requested that an additional

search be made of materials dated later than 1963. The reason for this

search is that most materials in the unidentified boxes are dated 1961

and 1962, but the box listing says it contains 1963 files. The BI

records listing was again reviewed for any 1964 boxes that might be

- appropriate for searching for 1963 files.

According to Mr. Butler's

phone conversation with the undersigned on 22 November 1978, nothing on

the list merits such a search.
