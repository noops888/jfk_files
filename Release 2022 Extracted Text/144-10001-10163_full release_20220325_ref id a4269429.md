assig duty station at USA-55 (Kirknewton, Scotland) to NSA; that he ~
.recalls a 1963 intercepted item reflecting a possible assassination . :
“attempt on President Kennedy. The Committee Staff requested NSA to make a- _
: search: to determine if the 1963 files’ on | the alleged message exists.
"2: (u) ‘Acéording ‘to Mr. Parish traffic from USA-55 would ’ not have
been forwarded. for retirement to the Agency Records Center. (This eliminates
that organization as a possible file location.)

3. (U) Ms. Joanne Stepp (B109) was requested to, and did provide
| the Bl Stored Records Listing (Bl listings were to be searched because
that organization is the predecessor of G8, and traffic from USA-55
would have been received ‘by Bl during 1963. ‘ This procedure takes into
consideration the possibility that files stored under the Bl designator
in 1962 may not have been redesignated.)

4, (U) On this same date, a brief meeting was held in the Legislative
Affairs Office to review the status and discuss the appropriate procedures
for this records search effort.. Those in attendance were: > 7

“6. (vu) on 16 November 1978 Me. Sapp discussed with Mr. Wigglesworth
fe “the. proposed written.response to the Committee. This response reflects
.that a reasonable search was made and no such record was found.

: « w) On 21 ‘Novenber i978 Mr. Sapp requested that an additional a
‘search be made of materials dated later than 1963. The reason for this ~

search is that most materials in the unidentified boxes are dated 1961 .°

and 1962, but-the box listing says it contains 1963 files. The Bl i
records listing was again reviewed for any 1964 boxes that.might. be
'- appropriate for searching for 1963 files. According to Mr. Butler"
“phone conversation with the undersigned on 22 November 1978, nothing on ' 3 aieee
the jist merits such a search. i ° :
