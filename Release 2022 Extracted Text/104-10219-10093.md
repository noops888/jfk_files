Tanya (Tatyana) and AGTOLTY (LMU). Subject considers Tanya an informer
(stukach) for the KGB. Officially, Tanya works sczewhere on the
Plosi:chad Nagina. Her husband, Anatoliy (Tolya) is the sca of an
icportant Party man who is the Head of a trust. The father gets good
joss for Anatoliy. Anatoliy was in Iran froa about 1972-73 as a

Soviet Union. Si2 had no interest in underground literature (sazizdat)

and never read any, nor did che ever recd Russian-language cocks
published abroad. Ic is unlikely Subject would have “read such material

or participated in dissident activities even had she had the chance to do
so, as Subject and her husband dained the efforts of the
dissidents as foolish and pointless. Subject hers:
educaticn and limited mentality. She is not interested in i

read much of anything, forbidccen or otherwise.

5. INFORMATICN CONCERNING SOVIET NATIONALISM FROSLES:

None. Subject has difficulty differentiating between the
nationalities of the Soviet Union and tends to lump
certain of then together under convenient generic terms, such as
"Siriytsy" (Syrians) for Soviets of Turkic or other Moslea nationality
descent. Subject had no interest in the plight of rinority nationalities
in the USSR. She recognized it was her Jewish ancestry which helped

her to cnigrate legally from the USSR, but that is as far as it went.
