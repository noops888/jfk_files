She recalled that the registration number of

the plane contained the numerals 37 or 47.

Mrs. GUTIERREZ stated she was aware of the

recent news release by the MIRR concerning the three

members of the MiRi and Comandos L who were reportedly

captured in Oriente Province, Cuba. She stated that

heare по подов о

although she knew several members of the MIRR and had

heard the names of others mentioned in conversation at

her house, she had never heard of the three individuals who

were reportedly captured in Oriente Province.

On December 7, 1966, MM T-1, a former Cuban

official now resident of Miami, who keeps closely informed

of news reports emanating from Cuba, advised that Cuban

radio stations have made no mention

of the capture of

three infiltrators in Oriente Province as announced by

DI. ORLANDO BOSCH of the MIRR. He pointed out that the

Cuban radio had announced the

airplane attack on the

chemical plant at Matanzas on November 13, 1966, which

mission was subsequently announced by ORLANDO BOSCH at

Miami.

On December 7, 1966, MM T-2, a Cuban exile at

Miami active in anti-CASTRO organizations, advised that

no one that he or his associates had spoken to seemed to

know the three individuals who were identified in the

press release by the MIRR as captured in Oriente Province.

He stated that consensus of opinion is that this press

release 1s a fictitious story by BOSCH or at the very least

the three names furnished by BOSCH are not correct names.
