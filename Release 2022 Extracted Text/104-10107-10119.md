advised Mr. Houston that the FBI office in New York stated that

Herbert Itkin was reluctant to make a guilty plea in the two mis-

demeanor cases pending before the New York State court.

It was

the opinion of the FBI agents that Itkin could be persuaded to

accept this course of action but was merely negotiating at this

time for federal assistance in the custody hearing in the family

court in

• Westchester County. Mr. Papich also stated that a

hearing was anticipated on the custody question, and Itkin at this

point was suggesting that CIA's name be interjected into the

hearing to bolster his stature with the court.

2.

We have not been advised that the State of New York has

withdrawn its motion to remand from the United States District

Court for the Southern District of New York, nor has any date

been set for Itkin to appear before the New York State court.

that Thomas L. Roberts) mother had suffered a massive heart

attack and was in a coma in a Boston hospital.° Roberts) had been

advised of his mother's illness and was scheduled to arrive in

Boston on the afternoon of 1 April. I explained to Mr. Heinonen

was not likely to be subpoenaed at this time to appear in any New

York litigation, it would be advisable for Roberts) to stay away

from New York
