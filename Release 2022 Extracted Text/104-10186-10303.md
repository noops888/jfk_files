26th of July Revolutionary Muvement and whose responsib=
ility it was to effect unity among Cuban political © °
opposition groups, was arrested at the Santiago central
check point when a soldier identified him as a former
rebel; he was réturning- from a meeting with Raul CASTRO.
The Cuban army was unaware of CHAIN's connection with the

26th of July Movement. :

-On 11 September. 1958, after prolonged interrogation by
military authorities, CHAIN confessed he had been a

_ commander in the: forces of Raul CASTRO, but did not

zt confess his connection with the rebel moverent. Members
of the 26th of July Moverent fered CHAIN would be-gut
to death by the authorities.

3. A usually rettable source in a report dated § January 1963 stated
that Carlos CHAIN Soler departed Cuba by air for Mexico City on

1 22 February 1962.

4. During a debriefing of a Cuban source on 19 December 1962 the
following information was provided on Carlos CHAIN Soler, First
7 Secretary of the Cuban delegation to the Organization of American
States (OAS) in Washington, D.C., until February 1962 when Cuba
was expelled from the OAS:

CHAIN, who held the rank of captain, was a security officer
(sic) from the Cuban Ministry of Interior. He acted as

HN deputy to Carlos LECHUGA Hevia, the head of the Cuban

: delegation to the OAS. One of his duties involved the
sending of messages from the Delegation to Cuba. Eugenio
ESCARRA, a Third Secretary to the Delegation, was the code
clerk who received his orders for sending messrges from CHAIN.

a.

CHAIN sent coded messages by teletype or by a machine at

. the Delegation which transmitted messages directly to the

i Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MINREX) in Habana. Both open
and coded messages were sent in this manner. Messages were
also relayed through the Mackay radio system. A machine

at the Delegation relayed the message to the Mackay radio
system. CHAIN often sent messages via the Mackay radio which
were not known to LECHUGA, ESCARRA told Source that the

code systems used for MINREX messages and for the Presidential
Palace messages were quite different. He said the Mackay
radio system was a more secure system which the Soviets had
assisted in providing and Nad also given the instructions for
its use. CHAIN. used the name "Augusto" in signing messages.

arse ¢,. CHAIN was in con act with an Austraiian (name unknown)
‘ 7 . in Washington, D.C,, whose friend was allegedly the head
i ae of an anti-Castro organization. On one occasion in 1961
: CHAIN gave Source $100.00 to give to the Australian to-
travel to Coral Gables, Florida, to meet a contact
reporting on-anti-Castro activities. When the Australian
returned to Washington, D.C., he gave Source a large
envelope which Source turned over to CHAIN. The oy
Australian turned over similar material to a contact in
the Cuban’ Enbassy.-

d, CHAIN worked closely with Jose MOLEON Carreras, the Cuban
delegate to the Inter-American Defense Staff of the OAS
in Washington, D.C, MOLEON was actively engaged in
gathering information and in buying publications concern-
ing southerf U.S. ports, U.S. Defense Department books,

, ete. ‘Source was not sure if MOLEON worked under the‘ - -

direction of CHAIN. .

e. Source recalled that CHAIN often appeared as though he
were afraid of ESCARRA who was a "Vieja Guardia" (Old
Guard Corrunist)., Source felt that CHAIN was not a

member of the Party.

£. CHAIN graduated from high school in Santiago de Cuba,
t and, although he entered the University there as an
engineering student, he did not complete his studies. :
He worked.in his father's grocery store in Palma
Soriano, Oriente Province and was a school teacher at
the Escuela de Cuadres Femeninos in Habana, In 1957
he was in the Sierra Maestra mountains as a captain in
the Rebel Army. In 1958 he was in the Isle of Pines
prison. In early 1959 he was appointed "Coordinator
Provincial de Oriente." In this position he maltreated
the people of Santiago de Cuba, and an appeal was made
directly to Fidel CASTRO who made a trip to Santiago ae
: Cuba to personally investigate the trouble. As a result
' of CASTRO's visit, CHAIN was transferred from Santiagb
de Cuba to a rempte location in the eastern part of
Oriente Province. The transfer was made only to appease
the populace of Santiago de Cuba and did not mean that
CHAIN claims to be close friends with Fidel CASTRO and
: Carlos Rafael RODRIGUEZ Rodriguez.
