Re:

Status of CIA Responses to Assassination Records Review Board's Requests for

Additional Information and Records

Dear John:

I am writing to follow-up on our telephone call earlier today and to convey my serious

concern about the status of CLA's responses to the Review Board's requests for

additional information and records. Although CLA has completed its responses to

several requests, and many others have been answered in part, a significant number of

requests have not been answered - including some that were made more than two

years ago. On many occasions we have been assured that responses would be

forthcoming, only to have promised dates come and go without answers. It is now

extremely important that these requests be answered promptly so that we may conduct

a proper follow-up if necessary. The issues that we can now identify as being of the

highest priority are identified in the text below by double asterisks (**)' and we request

that they be answered within the next month. We request that the remaining requests

be answered by April 1, 1998.

The remainder of this letter is divided into two parts: first, a listing of the formal

requests tor information and records

guest for ind mection Perecortme wond, ul underst and informal requests fol

following points differs from ours so that we can resolve any potential discrepancies.

(C)

In response to the AMWOLD follow-up questions posed by the AARB:

"Was part of the program to put in place a government in exile?

"Was there ever a government in exile?

I would offer the following as some suggested language.

(C) "Based on file reviews and recollections from officers involved in the Cuban program, there was never

a Cuban Government in Exile. During the planning for the Bay of Pigs operation it was envisaged that

after the invasion site had been secured, Miro Cardona and the Cuban Revolutionary Council would be

flown to the area to establish a new Cuban Government. The invasion site was never secured.

(C) "The AMWORLD Project, begun well after the failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion and after the release

of Manuel Artime Buesa and other Bay of Pigs veterans from Cuban prisons, was designed to support

and unite several Cuban exile groups under the control of Artime in an effort to enhance the cohesion of

the exiles and augment Artime's capability to launch propaganda and paramilitary attacks against the

Cuban mainland. The overall mission of AMWORLD was to foment a popular unrising in Cuba which

could lead to the ultimate overthrow of Fidel Castro. There is no evidence that AMWORLD's mission

even remotely came close to fruition and no evidence that a projected government in exile was ever

considered as a viable option."

MEMORANDUM FOR:

Laura Denk

Executive Director, ARRB

FROM:

J. Barry Harrelson

JFK Project Officer, HRP/OIM

SUBJECT:

ARRB Request CIA-IR-32, AMWORLD

1.

The following is responsive to referent request.

2. AMWORLD was a project designed to support and unite

several Cuban exile groups under the control of Manuel

Artime Buesa.

Its purpose was to try to enhance the

cohesion of the various exile groups and provide Artime more

capability to launch propaganda and paramilitary attacks

against the Cuban mainland, the ultimate goal being to cause

a popular uprising in Cuba

which would overthrow Fidel

Castro's communist oriented dictatorship.

3.

Pigs

AMWORLD did not start until after the failed Bay of

invasion and after the release of Artime and other

invasion veterans from Cuban prisons.

The goals and mission

Of AMWORLD, of course,

were never fully recognized and the

idea of Cuban government in exile not realized.

4. This completes our work on this request. If you

have any questions, please advise.

J. Barry Harrelson
