SUBJECT . :

famea W., Jr.-Emp. Ser, No, $8124
Fitness Report :

1. This is an annual fitnews report covering the period
1 April 1969 through 31 March 1970, Me, McCord completed
his firet full year as Chief, Physical Security Division, During
1969 the Division underwent many changes, a direct rewult of the
personal efforts of this employee, Ie has shown the initiative
to seek out new ways and means to harden the security of our
domestic and overseas facilities by tapping all possible tech-
nological sources both in and out of Government, His efforts
have produced tangible results and in my judgment, our posture
in the physical security field ig far Superior to any of our con-
temporaries,

2. With the spiraling costs of manpower, Mr. McCord
has concentrated on the potential for use of technical devices to
replace the human asset, He has made remarkable inroads into
this field by way of imagination, ingenuity and drive.

. 3: Mr. McCord has the quality w inspire his subordinates
He ie demanding, but understanding. On mare than one occasion
he waa asked to take under his wing employees who were labeled
"problems." Through personal interest and effort, he has salvaged
the majority of theve individuals to a Point where they are performing
in a highly satisfactory manner,

4. “In the previous fitness report, f alluded to the fact that
employee has a tendency to find it difficult to wes another person's
Point of view, This, I feel, is attributablo to'an innate stubbornness
which obviously is difficult to overcome, Mr. McCord is a very



principled individual who once convinced he haw hit upon the proper
course of action will usually yield only by direction, We've discussed
this, and I've noted a determined effort on hin part to broaden his
tolerance for other opinions.

5. Overall, the employee has made a substantial contribution
to the Office of Security by his dedication tu hie job, his tenacious
attitude toward upgrading our physical security standards, a curious
and inventive mind ever searching for better waya to solve a problem
in his area of responsibility, and & cast consciousness in the admini-
stration of his division, I rate him an vverall "Strong."

néss Report

1, This tean annual fitness report covering the period
| April 1968 throcgh 31 March 1969, During the firat period of

thia report, Mr, McCord served as the Chief, Te
* PTOS. and continued to display a very high degr

thnical Division/
of profeasionaliam

in administering the Agency's world-wide Audi Countermensuces
(ACM) program, Under his guidance, several new devices and
techniques were developed which have helped the Agency and the
intelligence community to maintain pace with the wophisticated

advances by the opposition in

the field of positive audio,

- 2. Mr. McCord initlated the necessary planning for the
activation of the Interagency Training Center (ITC) which provides
ACM instruction to.all members of the community in the latest of

equipment and techniqu

3. On 14 October 1968, he was reassigned to the position
of Chief, Physical Security Division. Although he had relatively

little experience in this particular fiel
the necessary detaila to manage this
steps toward the development,

id, he has quickly assimilated
Agency effort. He has taken
and use of the most advanced

|to protect the Agency, Under

{ne supervision of Mr, McCord, the Agency Security Command

Center operations have been expanded a

assigned the renponsibility to
relating to the Protection of A

ndimproved. He has been
organize and direct the Security efforts
gency asscts in time of demonstrations,

riots, and other civil disturbances, Me courdinated the Agency

Security effort with the U.S,
President of the-United States
Headquarters,

Seerct Service in Protection of the
during his recent visit to the CIA



gretce
ae

4, Mr. McCord is considered to be economical in his use

of equipment, manpower and funds.

5. Perhaps one of the stronger attributes thie employee
possceses is his ability lo organize, Ina relativ
he has deliberated the Physical Security Division
already taken steps to restructure it within existing manpower
limitations to more effectively react te. its responsibilities,

6. He inspires hia subordinates and bas the respect of his
superiors, There have been instances, however, when Mr. McCord
has exhibited a certain intolerance with individuals who do not agree
with his point of view, resulting in some friction in their working
relations, There has been much improvement in this regard, and
I do not feel it will present any problem in the future,

7: anticipate this employee will continue to absorb know-
ledge and experience in the physical security field at the rapid rate
he hae during his short tenure and am confident his efforts will
result in a major contribution to the Office and Agency. I rate
Mr, McCord a high "Strong."

3. Cormments of Reviewing Official

J concur thoroughly with[ | evaluation of Mr. McCord's

vigor ard enthusiasm, skill and judgment. I would add to this that he
has demonstrated extraordinary ingenuity and leadership in supervising
the development of several new and valuable techniques sa the counter -
measures field. However, I would rate him only "Proficient" in
Specific Duty Number 6, for I believe that he has not been as effective
as he znight be in liaison and coordination with other components of
the Ietclligence Community represexted on the Technical Committee.
This ie unfortunate, for it detracts from his outstanding performance
in all cther elements of his assigned responsibilities, He must woek
on improving these relationships and he has been counseled to thie
effect by his current supervisor,

The plane, while en route to Teheran fron Nicosia and as a regult
of bad weather and navigation error, went off ite plotted coures cot
¢roased into Soviet Armenia. There it was intercepted and fired on by
{nree MI0-17!s and caught fire in the left wing. Fivo of the erew bated
gut and the other four rode the aircraft dom to a safe landing on a
fnall airstrip at Genfarvh in Sovict Azerbaijan, The crew mensers who
had remained on the plane to ita landing got out safely and the plane
vas burning fiercely when tho crew last saw it, The part of the cree
that parachuted was surrounded by Soviet peagonts, auma of whon teat and
struck at the crew menbers, One of the nen, [

vas taken by the mob'to a telephone pole and narrowly escaped
hanging before being rescued by the: Soviet military,

~ | _____iand the remainder of the crew were turned over to the
Sovie tary, and efter an overnizht stay in a Soviel military
garrison near Stepanakert were taken to a city bolieved to be Yevlakh,.
and then flown to Baku, Russia, There they underwent interrogation by
Soviet intelligence officers, at least one of whom had served in the
United States, as a Soviet Purchasing Comiasion employac 1943—45, and
jator in Canada in 1919-65 a Firat Secretary of the Soviet Enbasay,
This RIS officer, Vladinir Bourdine, later served in 1955 as a personal
interpreter for Miruchchey in a meeting with Prime Minioter Nehru of
a. Bourdine interrogated at considerable
length during the period 20 June - 3 July 1958, while the ree was ine
Prisoned in the MVD Headquarters building in Baku. Following their
individual interroratiors, the crew manters were Tequired to appear
peparately before a Cormission of Soviet. officials at the Bakw KD
Headquarters who questioned them about the bordor violation by the

was begun, ard vhore initial press interviews were held, following

about the address book and ita contents, We assume that the Sovieto

their wallets relating to a few other CIA personnel.

We have received no:indicetions that| | or the other

gnd aome of the others did receive shota the first nicht and second day
fron the Soviet military for their wounds end burns; however, these
shoto are believed to have been for legitimate medical reasons,

The substance of the questioning, treatment and techniques of

in the courao of. the detriefinze. “In sumation, the interrogations

CONCLUSIONS:

Cc.

compromises occurred,

That the Soviets "ntased" on tho true nature of the flight
personnel of the C-118,

and

That tho reasons the crew members wore given an early release

were as follows:

1, Primarily, the Soviet interrogators failed
of the leads at their commind, particularly
addrosa book, and failed to break tho crewmen through
interrogation.

2. The crew did not inadvertently disclose through ine

terrogations, the purpose of their flight, its relation

to the Agency and that of lof its crew to ClA..

3. The Soviets apparently failed to check out the names
and other data in addreaa book through their
files prior to release of the crew.

4. No incriminating information or material was immediately

recovered fram the burned aircraft,

5. Several of the crew destroyed incriminating building
passes and notations in Uwir wallets while on their
way down in their parachutes, or immediately after
landing in thetr chutes.

6. There were either no leaks or insufficient leaks of
incriminating information through any room conversa=
tions at Baku among the crew, which may have beon moni-
tored by the Soviets, or such conversations as there
may have been were not properly interpreted, or inter-
preted soon’enough to tip the Soviets that there was

9. A factor that protably hod an inportant bearing was the
early acknovledgrent by the Sovie Fcreign Office of
the downing of the aircraft and the attempte by the
Soviets in the early stares to mae this appear as a
deliberate violazicn of the Soviet sir frontier, This
tended to take tie "play" avay fron the MVD and military

: up the pressure fur the release of the nine Army person= .

Soviets probably nad no desire to create a duplicate of a
this incident.

10. Safeguards taken ty the Agency ani the Air Force were
such that there was no leak to the press, during the
crew's internment, of the fact that there was an in-
telligence conrection of the flight amt crew of the

D. That it is not believed, based on the evidence at hand, that
the crew was drugged or otherwise tampered with medically.

Z, That there are valuatle points of guidance from a cover, opera-
tions, policy and code of conduct etanipvint which can be
gathered irom experiences of these creunen in the hands of tho
Soviets and can aid the Agency and its rersonnel in any future
situation of a eilmlar nature in which the Soviet military and
