Memo for the Record

Soo tor the Record

TO s Mr. William Sturbitts
FROM: Wade E, Thomas

SUBJECT: Reinol GONZALEZ Vonzales - Conzents on Interview
in May 1979 in Miami,

1. This Subject was interviewed on the occasionof both our

visits to Miami and we spent at least some 6 hours with him and
still haven't finished. He told us on the occasion of the last
visit that hesetill wants to tell. us about some things going

-on in the Cuban exile comaunisty: in Miami, that some Cubans ares
ibuying ares and planning actions against CASTRO,-etc, He wants to
tell us, he said, tha we'll know and won't be surprised but he
denies all part for himself in any such illegal actions. He does
not believe it possible, given internal and external conditions
ow prevailing, to overthrow CASTRO anytime soon but says if it
sere nossible, he would be the first to Start preparations for

thet purpose. When we next go to Miami we will listen to what
additional he has to say,

2. Subject was for the writer the most interesting and perhaps
she most oroductive of the peonle we were assigned to interview,
this guy is cut from a different mold from the other 7. He is
‘ough, dAntelligent,. cunning, ‘shrend-, lacking in formal education,
wut a real toughin-fighter who knows what he wants and knows how
‘0 go about it. He is, too, I think, a real opportunist, and this
way explain in part his:reason foryputting on the 6 Nov 61. Tve
‘wogram, I had the fe@ling repeatedly that ha was not really
owing clean on many of our questions, but the only two questions.
© which he reacted noticeably:were the ones about the TV programs
ond ‘Octavio -BARROSO, These tno visibly upset him:eventho I feel
e knew or thought they would be thrown at him and hetad his
nswers prepared. More about the TV Program and BARROSO later,

ry-geperal of the Union

» at one point belonged to the ARD( an
sociation of young democratic people), the MRP for a while,etc.

n 1959 he was named foreign relations secretary of the Confederation
£ Cuban Workers (CTC) however,

at the election of officers in late
959 CASTRO showed up and imposed his slate, a Communist slate for
he most part on the congress,

Subject was required to turn over

his post as foreign relations secretary to-Grien-ALVAREZ, He
and ALVAREZ had been on opposite ends politically in previous
years, when ALVAREZ was working at the Chase Manhattan. Bank in
Ravana and representing the bank workers union, but they had
put aside their differences to work together against BATISTA,
Then, when CASTRO came along he propelled ALVAREZ to the post in
the CIC to which Subject had democratically been chosen, The
imposition of CASTRO’s slate took place at a CIC congress in Nov
1960, He claims that he has never seen ALVAREZ since the business
iles to ALVAREZ was done in 1960, He knows
of course that ALVAREZ went on to other jobs, eventually to the
Cuban Embassy in Madrid, and eventually defected to the US. He

Slaims to have no use for ALVAREZ, he's a \ dedicated Commie and he

5. So far as he's a wa re there was only one Octavio BARROSO so
the one you're talking about is the same one known to him, the

(Subject) didn't
do it. There were others in jail at that time, also, he Says, who

could have told G-2 about BARROSO's revolutionary activities. As-
stated, that question, as did the one on the TV program, visibly
fupset him-so I'm not at all sure that we got the truth.

6. Subject was arrested on 11 October 1961 in a raid on the
Cesar Odio Farm, along with a number of other People. On 30 Septaber
1961 a woman belonging to his unit, Dalia JORGE, was arrested,
allegedly placing a bomb in a company there in Havana called CIA.
Subject was carrying documentation in alias but almost immediately
he was coafronted with Dalia who identified him to G.2, But, the
most irportant evédence is the fact that over the next few days
and weeks those known to Dalia in that organization were arresteds

7. The TV program - why? It was the first such appearance by anyone
arrested that could be called in favor of CASTRO.

VALDEZ told him that the decision had already been nade not
to shoot him ( Subject) but that some or most of the military
Section people of his organization (MRP) in jail wouldhave to

pay with their lives for what they, Subject and others of the

RP had done. The only way he could Save them, VALDEZ said, would
be to go on Tv and tell the nation what his organization had been
doing, tell them how useless resistance to CAST¥O was, and at the

Same time condem the US for its complicity in anti-CASTRO efforts,

Now, Subject claims that some of this fitted after a fashion into
thinking and size up of the state of things, He claims that

t) he had decided some time earlier that internat resistance of the
sort the MRP was dorducting was useless, and 2) that it woula be
etter to leave the country and fight from abroad, and 3) that he
