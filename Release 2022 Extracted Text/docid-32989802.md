SUBJECT: COUNTERINTELLIGENCE PROGRAM
BLACK NATIONALIST - HATE GROUPS —
RACIAL INTELLIGENCE

ReBuairtel to Albany aeons offices, 3/4/68.

(1) SA EDWARD U. CRIM has been designated by. the
Atlanta Office as coordinating agent for this program.

(2) The Atlanta Division has two main black national.
ist movements. They are: SNCC, with approximately 15 activé”
members and possibly 25-35 partially active members; and NOT,,
which maintains a Mosque in Atlanta having membership of about
75 to 125, with as many as 160 to 160 people appearing for some
of the open meetings.

It is estimated that Atlanta SNCC office has very
great potential, and that NOI has very little potential, for
7 violence, based on information available to Atlanta at .this
> - time,

The following subjects of the Agitator Index are
“considered militant black nationalists and might, in the”
future, be considered targets for counterintelligence action
because of their propensity for violence:

(3) SNCC is considered of such potential danger
7 as to warrant consideration for current counterintelligence
action. This is based on information received concerning
SNCC's purposes, which have been flatly stated as "to cheate
chaos within the Unitéd States so that the une Population .
can be brought to its knees."

(4) Atlanta is submitting no overall sugge: estions’
for counterintelligence action at this time. a

(5) Atlanta will submit by separate letter sug-

Re Bureau teletype to. Atlanta, Los Angeles, and
Memphis, 3/29/78; Bureau telephone call to Atlanta, 3/31/78;
and Atlanta letter to FBIHQ, 4/11/78.

By ‘separate package, Atlanta is sending FBIHQ xeroxed
copies of 74 volumes of documents that were in the Atlanta
file on MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR., 100-5586 as requested by
FBIHQ.

Referenced Bureau teletype had indicated that in
connection with the investigation into the assassination of
MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR., the HSCA had requested access to
various field office files, including the entire Atlanta
sécurity file concerning MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR., (Atlanta
file 100-5586). One legible copy of each documént in this
Atlanta file was to be furnished to FBIHQ.

The Bureau also advised Atlanta in referenced
Bureau telephone call, that the HSCA wanted Atlanta to
first furnish those documents in KING's Atlanta security.
file that covered the period 1/1/68 through 4/30/68, and
when these were xeroxed, they were to be sent to FBIHQ right
away. When this phase was completed, then the remaining
documents in KING's Atlanta file were to be xeroxed and sent
to FBIHQ.

The Atlanta file on MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.,
consisted of 81 volumes and the documents in this file
covering the period 1/1/68 through 4/30/68 were in volumes
74 through 80. Since the KING file only contained 81 volumes,
Atlanta submitted volumes 74 through 81 with referenced Atlanta
letter to FBIHQ, 4/11/78.

One xerox copy of the following volumes of the
Atlanta file on MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR., are being sent
to FBIHQ at this time:

As the Bureau will note in the above list, ina
number of volumes of the KING file, there are many serials
Listed that cannot be accounted for. For the information
of the Bureau, back in 1977, Atlanta had a massive project
of retrieving communications containing electronic surveillance |
(elsur) information regarding MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR., and
the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) pera
court order in the case captioned, "BERNARD S. LEE v.
CLARENCE M. KELLEY: ET AL (U.S.D.C., D.C.) CIVIL ACTION

- NO. 76+1185 AND SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE
(SCLC) v. CLARENCE M. KELLEY; ET AL (U.S.D.C., D.C.),
CIVIL ACTION NO. 76-1186", In this project, Atlanta had to
review hundreds of volumes of Atlanta files and retrieve
thousands of communications containing this elsur information
‘so these communications could be sent to FBIHQ, for eventual

-8-

transfer to the National Archives per the court order.
Atlanta. in carrying out this project, had to use a large
number .of Atlanta personnel, many being unfamiliar with
. Security type work and communications. 4

These people had been instructed to list each serial
removed from the file on a form that Atlanta devised for each .
volume reviewed in project, however, it was felt that in many
instances where a cover airtel and LHM were removed from the
files, both these items would be stapled together, resulting
in only the cover airtel serial number being Listed on thé
form; thé LHM serial number would not be noted by the person
removing this communication and as a result it was not recorded.
Atlanta feels this accounts for the bulk of the unaccounted
for serials.

Enclosed for the Bureau is one xerox copy
each of 14 documents, plus one envelope of latent
prints, which were taken from the Atlanta MURKIN file,
as requested by FBIHQ in referenced teletype.

Referenced teletype indicated that the HSCA
had requested that the FBI furnish "all original
transparent latent lifts of value and of no value in
the possession of FBIHQ or field offices which were
collected during the course of the MURKIN investigation".
FBIHQ has pulled photographs of all latents of value
submitted by field offices from the FBIHQ MURKIN file.

The Bureau requested Atlanta to review its
MURKIN file for any latent fingerprint lifts obtained
during the course of the MURKIN investigation and if
feasible, submit photographs of those lifts. If not,
the actual lifts were to be submitted to FBIHQ, which
would be returned to Atlanta after copying by FBIHQ.
Atlanta reviewed the 1A Section of Atlanta's MURKIN
file (44-2386) as well as the bulkyexhibit sheets and
noted there were 124 1A exhibits and five bulky
exhibit sheets. Only four 1A envelopes and one bulky
exhibit pertained to latent fingerprints obtained during
the course of the Atlanta MURKIN investigation and all of
these were previously sent to FBIHQ in 1968. Only

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE
ON ASSASSINATIONS
(HSCA)

Special Agent (SA) Richard D. Rackleff,
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Atlanta
Division, was contacted telephonically on Friday,
March 17, 1978 by Robert Walker who identified
himself as a Staff Investigator for the House Select
Committee on Assassinations (HSCA). Walker made
arrangements to meet with SA Rackleff at the
intersection of North Avenue and Spring Street, Atlanta,
Georgia, at 11:00 AM on Monday ; March 20, 1978.
Walker stated he would be in the company of a_second
Staff Investigator whom he identified as Mr. Reeves,
a black male.

At 11:00 AM on March 20, 1978, SA Racklef£_
met with Robert Walker and Floyd Reeves, both of
whom displayed credentials identifying themselves
to be members of the Investigative Staff of the U. S.
Congress. Reeves conducted the questioning and requested
the information relating to the neighborhood canvassing
conducted by SA Rackleff in the vicinity of North
Highland Street and Ponce de Leon Avenue in April,
1968. Reeves inquired as to the person or persons
coordinating the investigation conducted in the Atlanta
Division and specifically asked whether other areas

of Atlanta were canvassed in addition to this one
particular area. Reeves specifically asked if other
areas which were identified by markings on a map
recovered from the apartment of James Earl Ray were
canvassed in addition to this one area near North
Highland Avenue and Ponce de Leon.

SA Rackleff explained he could not recall
specifically how many markings were on the map, but
believed there were basically four areas marked.

He stated three of these markings were identifiable
as being significant to the approximate location
of the home and church of Doctor Martin Luther King,
Jr. and the apartment of James Earl Ray. The fourth
marking on the map as recalled by SA Rackleff was
not significant or identifiable with any known activity
of either James Earl Ray or Dr. King, and therefore
an extremely thorough, door-to-door survey was conducted
in an area well beyond the boundaries of the fourth
marking on the map. Each and every adult member
of each household was contacted and interviewed concerning
any knowkedge or association with James Earl Ray
or Dr. Martin Luther King. Photographs of Ray were
displayed and as best as could be recalled, there
was no pertinent information developed specifically
identifying any associates of either James Earl Ray

Ageee or Dr. King.

The Special Agent in Charge of the Atlanta
Division was identified as Frank Hitt, and the Assistant
- Special Agent in Charge at that time was identified
as Jack Keith, Jr.

Mr. Reeves requested an additional interview
“of SA Rackleff in the Conference Room at the Headquarters
of the Atlanta Police Department at 3:00 PM on that
same date for the purpose of displaying a replica

NW 65360 Dodid:32989802 Page 105



HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE
ON ASSASSINATIONS
(HSCA)

of the map recovered from Ray's apartment. At 3:00
PM, a second interview was conducted by Mr. Reeves
and Mr. Walker. Mr. Reeves displayed what he
identified to be a replica of the map recovered from
Ray's apartment in April, 1968 and also displayed

a legal sized handwritten paper showing separate
investigations conducted by SA Harry Lee, SA James
Riordan, and SA Rackleff in 1968. The investigation
by SA Rackleff identified the streets and addresses
canvassed during the neighborhood investigation.

SA Rackleff explained that he reported to the Atlanta
Office in about January 1968, and at the time of

the investigation of the King assassination, he was
not familiar with the streets and locations. SA
Rackleff was unable to recall specifically observing
the map displayed by Mr. Reeves, however, did
identify three of the general areas marked as being
the approximate location of the home and church of
Dr. King and the apartment of JameS Earl Ray near
14th Street and Peachtree Street, N.E. The fourth
marking on the map was identified as the area in
which SA Racklef£ conducted the above described
neighborhood investigation. i

SA Rackleff expressed his full and complete
cooperation with the investigation of Mr. Walker
and Mr. Reeves and Mr. Reeves stated they were very
much appreciative and might request additional
interviews at a later date.

Re Bureau airtel to Atlanta, Birmingham, Chicago,
Cincinnati, and Louisville, 2/16/78.

Enclosed for the Bureau is one xerox copy each
of 193 Atlanta logs and communications relative to cap-
tioned matter.

Referenced Bureau airtel pointed out that the
HSCA was currently conducting investigation into the assas-
sSination of President JOHN F, KENNEDY and MARTIN LUTHER
KING, JR. In connection with the KING matter, the HSCA
had been advised that the National States Rights Party
(NSRP), JESSE B. STONER, and Dr. EDWARD FIELDS, were sub-_
jects of electronic surveillance (Elsur) by the FBI. The
HSCA, by letter dated 2/8/78, requested access to FBI
materials pertaining to the Elsurs of these subjects during
the period 1956 to 1965.

The Bureau airtel went on that appropriate records
at FBI Headquarters were checked and disclosed that JESSE B.
STONER had been the subject of a télephone surveillance by
the Atlanta Office from 10/10/63 to 2/18/64, at 100% Hunter
Street, Atlanta, Georgia. This coverage was also in connec
tion with the Bapbom caSe and the Elsur was assigned the
symbol numbers, AT 1377-S* and AT 1378-S*.

Atlanta noted in conducting this review, that
a few of the original Elsur logs had several entries made
with a light blue ink and as a result., these entities were
somewhat faint on the xerox copies. BEforts to improve
the quality of these particular copies of the Elsur logs
btae unsuccessful as the light blue ink does not copy
well.

It is noted that Atlanta has placed a three by
five card as a flag on the serials listed below, namely:

Atlanta Serials 157-582 A-33

as these serials had information in various paragraphs,

that by its nature, identified a former confidential source
of the Atlanta Office and this information should be deleted
prior to being furnished to the HSCA. These three by five
card flags set forth the appropriate paragraphs that should
be deleted in these sérials.

Attached is a copyof a three-page news release
which was made by Attorney General Griffin B. Bell on
2/18/77 pertaining to the report prepared by the Department ~
of Justice Task Force which conducted a review of our
Security investigation, as: well as our investigation
regarding the assassination, of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.

There also is attached a copy of the Task Force's
report, together with its exhibits. Copies of this report,
including its exhibits, have been made available to news
media by the Department of Justice.

7 I have made the following statement in response
to inquiries regarding the Task Force’ s report which have
been received at FBIHQ:

"I noted with .great satisfaction the conclusions
of the task force that the FBI's assassination probe
of the Martin Luther King slaying was ‘credible and
thorough'; that there was no evidence of a conspiracy;
and that the report clearly indicates no complicity
on the part of the FBI in this assassination.

RE: DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TASK FORCE REPORT
ON FBI INVESTIGATIONS INVOLVING
DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

"There are portions of the report which describe
objectionable actions on the part of the FBI.

"Guidelines, procedures and our determination
to be completely observant of civil rights and the
dignity of man will prevent a recurrence of these

activities."
If requested to comment regarding any of the
conclusions of the Task Force or concerning the contents
of its report, you should feel free to quote my above-cited
statement. However, you should not expand on my statement if
or volunteer observations of your own.

In addition, you should not hesitate to refer news
media representatives who make inquiries about matters covered
in the Task Force report to the Press Services Unit (Ext. 3691)
of the External Affairs Division.

Should you receive inquiries regarding the
availability of copies of the Task Force report, you should
state that the report was released by the Department of
Justice and that the FBI has been advised that copies of
the report are being printed and will be available for
purchase through the Superintendent of Documents, U. S.
Government Printing Office, Washington, D. C. 20402.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Hot : "AG
FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 18, 1977 202-739-2028

The FBI conducted a thorough investigation of the
assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., a Department
of Justice task force concluded in a report released today by
Attorney General Griffin B. Bell.

The 149-page report was submitted by the task force
of the Office of Professional Responsibility following an
eight-month intensive review of FBI files and interview of
witnesses. The purpose of the study was to examine FBI
activities involving Dr. King and to evaluate the effectiveness
of the assassination investigation.

The report concluded that the FBI had conducted a 7
painstaking and successful investigation of the 1968
assassination in Memphis, Tennessee. j

The task force also found no evidence of FBI

complicity in the murder.
The only new evidence that was developed related to
details that did not affect the ultimate conclusion that James

Earl Ray was the properly convicted murderer,

On April 26, 1976, then Attorney General Edward H.

Levi directed the Office of Professional Responsibility, headed

by Michael E. Shaheen, Jr., to review Department files to
determine:

(1) Whether the FBI investigation of Dr. King's
murdet on April 4, 1968, at Memphis, Tennessee, was thorough
and honest; seeece

\ (2) Whether thére was any evidence of FBI A
involvement in Dr. King's death;

: (3) Whether any new evidence had’come to the
attention of the Department bearing on the assassination which
should be dealt with by the proper authorities; and

(4) Whether the relationship between the FBI and
Dr. King called for criminal prosecution, disciplinary
proceedings, or other appropriate action.

After reviewing the murder investigation, the task
force turned to the pre-assassination security investigation of
Dr. King. The task force found that there may have been an

* arguable basis for the FBI ‘to initiate a security investigation
on Dr. King, but continued that the security investigation should
have been ended in 1963 and not continued until his death five

years later.

The FBI's GOINTELPRO-type harassment of Dr. King and
efforts to drive him out of the civil rights movement were found
to have heen clearly improper.

Mr. Shaheen's report concluded that any criminal
action against FBI participants in the harassment campaign was
barred by the statute of limitations. The task force
recommended no disciplinary action because the chief FBI
officials responsible for the harassment are dead or retired.

The task force submitted recommendations for tighter
supervision of the FBI's domestic intelligence activities and
endorsed the Department's new guidelines in this area. The
task force also proposed outright prohibition of COINTELPRO~-type

activities against domestic intelligence subjects.

I. INTRODUCTION

A. The Mission Of The Task Force
1. The Problem

Qn November 1, 1975, William C. Sullivan, former
Assistant Director, Domestic Intelligence Division,
Federal Bureau of Investigation, testified before the
Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations
with Respect to Intelligence Activities. He related that
from late 1963 and continuing util the assassination of
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jx., King was the target of an
intensive campaign by the F.B.I. to neutralize him as an
effective civil rights leader. Sullivan stated that in
the war against King '"'No holds were barred." (Senate
Report No. 94-755, Final Report of the Select Committee
to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to
“Intelligence Activities, Book IZ, p. 11). This and other
testimony describing this F.B.I. coumterintelligence
campaign against King reached the public through the
news media, As a consequence there was a regeneration of
the widespread speculation on the possibility that the
Bureau may have had some responsibility in Dr. King's
death and may not have done an impartial and thorough
investigation of the assassination.

2. The Attorney General's Directive

On Novenber 24, 1975, the.Attorney General of the
United States directed the Civil Rights Division of the

Department of Justice to wmdertake a review of the files
of the Department and its Federal Bureau of Investigation
to determine whether. the investigation of the. assassinaticn
of Dr, Martin Luther King, Je. should-be redperied. More
particularly it was sought to:be determined: .(1) whether
any action taken in relation to Dr. .Kirig by the FBI before
the assassination had, or may have had; -an effect, direct
or indirect, on that event, and (2) whether any action was
taken by the: FBI which had, or may’have had, any other
adverse effect.on Dr. King. Recormendaticns for criminal,

disciplinary .or.other appropriate action were réquested.
3, The Review up to April 26, 1976

In the next four mnths, the Assistant Attorney
General in charge of the Civil Rights Divisitn, his
principal Deputy Assistant Attorney Ceneral. end the
Chief of the Criminal Section of the Civil Rights
Division, acting as a review staff, variously read portions

of the FBI headquarters file en a person

NW 65360 Docld:32989802 Page 186


who served as. an adviser to Dr, King, portions of the FBI

headquarters security file on Dr. King himself, portions
of the FBI headquarters file on the assassination investi-
gation, some Department (as opposed to FBI) files relating
to Dr. King, and other Bureau documents including everything
on Martin Luther King, Jr., held in the late J. Edgar Hoover's
official, confidential and personal files. ;

By a memorandum to the Attorney General dated April
9, 1976, the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the
Civil Rights Division submitted a 51 page report of the
Chief of the Civil Rights Division's Criminal Section dated
March 31, 1976, embodying the results of the three-man study,
limited to the above listed files, and concentrating almost
exclusively on the pre-assassination surveillance of, and
counterintelligence activities against, Dr. King.

The Assistant Attorney General recommended the

* creation of a Departmental Task Force to complete the

review he and his team had beg. He also recommended an
Advisory Committee of distinguished citizens to advise with
the task force. The further review proposed included inter-
rogation of material witnesses, reading all the pertinent
field office files and reviewing all of the headquarters
files relating to Dr. King and possibly to other civil rights
activists. A recommendation was made to review tapes secured

NW 65360 Docld:32989802 Page 187



by electronic surveillance with a view to determining
which of such mterials should ‘be and could be legally
destroyed. The Assistant Attorney. General felt that
the FBI should assess the ‘culpability of ‘its: agents
involved in the wrongdoing by the ‘principals named in
the report. His memorandum to the Attorney General
concluded that probably criminal redress was time-
barred, that civil remedies might be available to

the King family but might also be more embarrassing
than helpful, and hence that consideration be given
to a direct payment by the settlement process or by

a private bill to compensate the King survivors, or
‘with the survivors’ concurrence; the King: Foundation;
if this last issue were left to the task force or an
Advisory Commission, it should consider the pros and
cons. and recommend as it sees fit.

The Attorney General forwarded the Civil Rights
Division memoranda (and comments thereon fran the Deputy
Attorney General, the Solicitor General, and from staff
members and the Assistant. Attomey General of the Criminal
Division) to the Cosel, Office of Professional Respon-
sibility. The Attomey General charged the Office of
Professional Respmsibility with the work of completing
the review. begun by the Civil Rights Division. His memo-

randum states:

NW 65360 Docld:32989802 Page 188



"My request for the review
involved four matters. First, whether
the FBI investigation of the Dr. Martin
Lather King's assassination was thorough
and honest; second, whether there was
any evidence that the FBI was involved
in the assassination of Dr, King; third,
in light of the first two questions,
whether there is any new evidence which
has come to the attention of the Depart-
ment concerning the assassination of Dr.
King which should be dealt with by the.
appropriate authorities; fourth, whether
the nature of the relationship between
the Bureau and Dr. King calls for criminal
prosecution, disciplinary proceedings, or
other appropriate action.

As the fourth point, I again note
that from the partial review which has
been made, Mr. Pottinger concludes 'we
have found that the FBI umdertook a system
atic program of harassment of Martin Luther
King, by means both legal and illegal, in
order to discredit him and harm both him
and the movement he led.' Assuming that
the major statutory violations relevant

i to this conduct would be 18 U.S.C. Section
241 and Section 242, Mr. Pottinger’s mamo-
randum..concludes..that any: prosecution -con-
templated under those acts would now be
barred by the five-year statute of limita-
tions with the possible exception which
would exist if there were proof of a con~
tinuing conspiracy,

As to the matter of new evidence
with respect to the assassination my under-
standing is that the Department has never
closed the Martin Luther King file and
that numerous allegations of the possible
involvement of co-conspirators are promptly
investigated. The thrust of the review which
I requested, however, was to determine
whether a new look at what was done by the
Bureau in investigating the assassination
or in the relationship between the Bureau

NW 65360 Docld:32989802 Page 189



O oO

and Dr. King might give a different
emphasis or new clues in any way to
the questi of involvement in that”
erime. At this point in the. review,
as I read the memoranda, nothing has
tumed up relevant on this latter
point.

The review is not complete.
Mr. Pottinger and all those who have
commented upon his memorandum recommend
that the review be completed. Mr.
Pottinger also: has made other recompen-
dations upon which there is some differ-
ence of opinion. In ny view, it is
essential that the review be completed
as soon as possible and in as thorough
a tamer as is required to answer the
basic questions. In view of what has
already been done, and the tentative
conclusions reached, special emphasis
should be given to the fourth question.
Tn conducting this review-you should
eall upon the Department to fimnish
‘to you the staff you need.

My conclusio as to the’ review *
conducted by the Civil Rights Divisio
is that it has now show that this
complete review is necessary, particu-
larly in view of the cmclusion as to

* the systemitic program of harassment.

I£ your review turns up matters for
specific action, we should discuss ‘the
best way to proceed on each such case."

B. The Task Force And Thé Method Of Review

The Counsel of the Office of Professimal Responsi-~
bility selected three attorneys from the Civil Rights Division,
Joseph F. Gross, Jr., James R, Kieckhefer and William D. White,
one attorney from the Criminal Section of the Tax Division,

NW 65360 Docld:32989802 Page 190


NW 65360 Docld:32989802 Page 191

James F, Walker, and a retired attomey Fred G. Folsom,
who is currently a consultant to the Tax Division with
37 years of experience in Civil Rights Division (which
included homocide cases), Criminal Division and Tax
Divisio prosecutions. As the senior mm the latter
was designated to head the task force. This committee
or task force began its work on May 4, 1976. ‘The committee
was further staffed by the addition of two-regearch analysts,
Ms. Hope Byrme and Mr. Geoffrey Covert, two secretaries,
Ms. Veronica Keith and Mrs. Renee Holmes, and two clerk-
typists, Mrs. Leroylyne Murray and Ms. Dana Boyd.
Consideration of a tentative outline for an eventual
report based on the chronology of events in the relationship
between Dr. Martin Luther Kirig and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation brought the task force up against the fact
that the field of the history before the assassination had
just ‘been plowed twice: once by the Civil Rights Division
memoranda of March 31, 1976, and April 9, 1976 and once
* (among other kindred subjects) by the Senate Select Committee
to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence
Activities (Senate Report, No. 94-155 94th Congress, 2d
Session, Books II and IIT).
By way of contrast, however, the matter of the assas-

sination of Dr. King and the ensuing investigation had been



O Oo

judged by the Civil Rights Division's Assistant Attorney
General and his two assistants primarily o their famili-
arity with the Department file on the investigation as it
had progressed since 1968, The Civil Rights Division's
Martin Luther King, “Ir, ,» review memoranda reflected that
a study had been made of only the first 10 sections of the
FBI headquarters file on the assassination investigation
and only a random inSpection was done of some of the remin-
ing 74 sections. There was no factual discussion or analysis.
The conclusion was reached by the Civil Rights Division staff
that "the. Bureau's investigation was comprehensive, thorough
and professional" (Mirphy memorandum'of March 31, 1976, p. 6).
It was determined. therefore to begin the task force's study
with a complete review of the files on the FBI's investigation
of the assassination. It was the consensus of the review
team that by approaching the whole task by first examining
the character and completeness of the murder. investigation
an. answer could be made to .the Attorney General's question
as to the Bureau's performance in that regard and. also 2
answer could be indicated to his question going to the Bureau's
possible responsibility, if any, direct or indirect, for
Dr. King's death,

After the examination of the FBI's investigation of
the mirder of Dr. King, the review team proceeded to go

~8-

NW 65360 Docld:32989802 Page 192



nw 65360 Docld:32989802 Page 193

back and complete the inquixy into the Bureau's pre-
assassination relationship with Dr, King, Necessarily’
included again in this second stage of our review was
the consideration of whether the FBI was in any way
implicated in the murder directly or indirectly.

The task force made a particular point of looking
at all the material in the FBI headquarters and field
office files on the Assassination Investigation, the so-
called "Murkin File" @urkin being an acronym for Mader
of King) 1/; the Martin Luther King Security File 2/ 3 the
Cominfil-SCLC File (Cominfil being an acronym for Commmist
infiltration; $.C.L.C., the initials for the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference) 3/; the file on Commmist Influence
in Racial Matters 4/ and the advisor to King File 5/.
The "Murkin" file was solely concerned with the murder investi-
gation. The other four files provided a milti-focal view

of the Bureau's intelligence and counterintelligence
activities with respect to Dr, Martin Luther King, Jr.
The scheme of citation hereinafter used will be to
minimize footnotes, place the source citation in the
body of the writing, and designate headquarters files
by "HQ" and number and serial. and Field Office files
by city and number and serial, e.g.: (Memphis 44-1987-
153). Exceptions to this scheme will be explained when
made. i

The more voluminous of the pertinent files in
addition to the FBI héadquarters files and the Washington
Field Office files were located in Memphis, Atlanta,
Baltimore, Charlotte, Birmirigham, New Orleans, Los Angeles,
San Francisco, Kansas City, St. Louis, Omha, Chicago,
Springfield (I11.), Milwaukee and New York. These were
examined in place by visits by task force personnel. The
remaining files were xeroxed and forwarded for review in
Washington. Pertinent newspaper clipping files maintained . .:
by the Department and by the Bureau and its field offices
were scanned.

In tems of papers examined, more than 200,000
entries, many with mmerous pages concerning both the
murder investigation and the security investigation were

- covered. The five attorneys sitting together originally

-10-

NW 65360 Docld:32989802 Page 194


and later, as the work progressed, splitting up to

work singly or in teams together with the research
personnel, considered separate sections of each file
compiling notes, camenting on, or reading aloud, or
noting for reading by all of the committee, items of
significance. Notes were taken, when pertinent items
were encountered, on a serial~by-serial basis ("serials"
being each separate document entry of one or more pages
in the file). The resulting books of notes were then
xeviewed and used in conjunction with the original-source
serials for the development of the statements of fact
herein. In addition witness interviews were reflected

in contemporaneous memoranda which aided in the development
of the facts recited.

7 Selected portions of the so-called Official and
Confidential files which had been kept in the office of
the late J. Edgar Hoover, some sensitive files in the
office of a Section Chief in the FBI Security Division,
and the files of former Assistant Director William
Sullivan were reviewed. So also were the pertinent
files of the Attorneys General. The task force attorneys
reviewed the transcripts of key intercepted telephone
and microphone overheard conversations of Dr. King

‘and his associates. These were spot checked

-11-

| NW 65360 Docid:32989802 Page 195


oO O

for accuracy against the tapes of those surveillances.

A canvass of other investigative agencies was made to
determine whether their files reflected that intelligence

or counterintelligence requests had been made upon them

by the FBI in relation to Dr. King ‘This included the
Defense Department, the State Department, the U.S.
Information Agency, the C.1.A., the Secret Service, the
Postal Inspection Service, the Internal Revenue Service's
Intelligence Division and the Treasury Department's Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. The material tumed up
by these agencies was examined, albeit little of consequence
oe aeeereds Relevant portions of the investigation reports
of the Memphis Police Department on the King murder were
xeroxed and studied.

In addition to official files, the task force personnel
considered published material from the public sector dealing
with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr,, and his assassination.
Included in this category were a viewing of the Columbia
Broadcasting System 's program on the death of King in its series
"The Assassins,"' a National Broadcasting Company ''Tonorrow’

program of April 4, 1974, and perusal. of books and articles
on the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the role
of the FBI in relation to the mirder of Dr. King (see
Bibliography, App. A, Ex. 6). This lead to some valuable

-12-

NW 65360 Docld:32989802 Page 196


evidentiary material - principally the oral and written

statements of James Earl Ray - which was used to buttress
the reconstruction of the facts of the mrder and of the
FBI investigation.

Some 30 interviews were conducted, principally in
the assassination phase of the task force study. They were
helpful in supplementing the results of interviews done
during the murder investigation.

During the review of the Menphis Field Office files,
an on-site inspection of the crime scene was conducted and

* the exhibits in the office of the Clerk of the County Court

for Shelby Coty, Termessee, were examined.

TI. ‘THE ASSASSINATION INVESTIGATION

A. Events Surrounding April 4, 1968

1. The Poor People's Campaign

To understand the movements of Dr. King during this
critical period, it is necessary to briefly discuss the
Poor People's Campaign (POCAM), originally called the
Washington Spring Project in which he and the SCLC were involved.
POCAM was scheduled to begin the first week of April 1968,
and involved recruiting some 3,000 poor unemployed blacks
from 16 localities in the United States for the purpose of
going to Washington, D.C., and petitioning the government to-
improve their economic status (HQ 157-8428-51).

The plan was to camp on the Washington Monument or
Lincoln Memorial grounds (HQ 157-8428-132). During the first
and second weeks, demands would be made of congressmen and
heads of departments, such as the Secretary of Labor. If the
demands were not met, nonviolent demonstrations were to be
conducted (HQ. 157-8428--109) .

Dr. King's planned travel schedule for February and
March included trips to 9 major cities and visits to various
points in Mississippi, Alabama, South Carolina, North Carolina
and Virginia (HQ 157 8428-75). By mid February Dr. King had

become discouraged with the lack of progress in recruiting and

-14-

NW 65360 Docid:32989802 Page 198



training demonstrators (HQ 157-8428-206). During this low
point in the POCAM Dr. King was pursuaded to alter his plans
and to go to Memphis, Termessee, in support of a strike involving

the city's sanitation workers.

2. Memphis Sanitation Worker's Strike ad

On February 12, 1968, approximately 1,000 sanitation
workers employed by the city of Memphis called a wildcat
strike. The strikers were represented by Local 1733 of the
émerican Federation of State, County and Mmicipal Employees
who demanded exclusive recognition of the union as bargaining
agent, setting up grievance procedures, wage improvements,
payroll deduction of wmion dues, and a pramtion system as well
as a pension, hospitalization and life insurance hoon
(HQ 157-9146-X1) .

The NAACP intervened in the strike because all of
the sanitation workers, excluding drivers, were black. A.
militant young black power group known as the Invaders was
similarly interested in the strike. The group consisted of
about 15 members, mostly high school dropouts, and was a cell
of a larger group known as Black Organizing Power (BOP) headed
by Charles L. Cabbage and Join B. Smith. The alleged purpose
of BOP was to stimilate a sense of black identity, black pride
and black consciousness in young blacks.

-15-

NW 65360 Docld:32989802 Page 199



.@) oO

The strikers were also supported by a group of black
ministers, comected with the Memphis Interdenominational.
Ministerial Alliance, who, adopted the name OOME (Commmity on
the Move for Equality). It was members .of this group that
were instrumental in bringing Dr. King to Memphis. On March 3,
1968, the Reverend James M. Lawson, Jr., pastor of the
Centenary Methodist Church, Memphis, and menber of OOME, stated
on a television program (WHBQ-TV) that he wanted to bring
Dr. King (and other heads of civil rights organizations) to
Memphis in an effort to unify the entire black comunity
behind the demands of the strikers (HQ 157-9146-X23). The
intervention of these various black commmity organizations
caused the city of Memphis to be concerned about the racial
overtones of the strike and the possibility of violence
(HQ 157-9146-X1).

Dr. King made his first visit to Memphis in support
of the strike on the.night of March 18, 1968. On that occasion,
in addressing an estimated crowd of 9,000 to 12,000 people at
a rally ‘sponsored by COME at the Mason Temple, he called for
a general protest-.day on March 22, 1968. All blacks were asked
not to go to work or school on that day and were urged to
participate in a massive downtown march. Dr. King and his
party stayed at the Lorraine Notel, 406 Mulberry Street, on

-16-

NW 65360 Docld:32989802 Page 200


the night of March 18, 1968 and left Memphis shortly before

noon on March 19, 1968, ostensibly to go to the State of
Mississippi in connection with the POCAM (HQ 157-9146-X39) .

The City of Memphis was virtually. paralyzed bya
16-inch snowfall on March 22, 1968, resulting in the post
ponement of the planned mass march to March 28, 1968. Dr. King
retumed to Memphis on the 28th, arriving at the. airport at
approximately 10:22a.m. By ‘that time approximately 5,000 to
6,000 people, about half of whom were of school age, had
congregated at the Clayborn Temple (located at 280 Hernando St.)
for the start of the march. According to the plan of the march,
the sanitation workers were in front with the remainder of the
people following behind. The march was to proceed north on
Hernando to-Beale Street, thence west on Beale Street to
Main Street and north on Main Street to City Hall.

‘The march ‘got ‘underway at approximately 11:00a.m. and
had proceeded to Hemando and Beale before it was joined by
‘Dr. King. When the front of the march (led by Dr. King)
reached Main Street, teenagers and young adults at the rear
of the march near Third and Beale (two blocks from the front
of the march) ripped the signs off.their poles and began
breaking store windows and looting. Mass confusion developed
and the police moved in to quell the disturbance. The

disruption of the march caused be. King's aides to comandeer
an automobile, and Dr. King and his party were escorted by
police to the Rivermont Hotel operated by Holiday Inns of
América. (HQ 157-9146-45). Dr. King left the march at
11:15a.m. and checked into the Rivermont Hotel at 11:24a.m.
where he stayed until March 29, 1968. Dr. King and his party
were scheduled to retum to Atlanta on'Mirch 28, 1968, at
9:05p.m. via Eastern Airlines and were ‘scheduled to leave
Atlanta the morning of March 29, 1968, for Baltimore
(HQ. 157-9146-45). ‘Thus, enaining in Meiphis on the night
of the ‘28th was. a change in plans. Het

The city ordered a’ 7:00p.m. curfew and approximately

. 3,500 member's of the Tennéssee National Guard were called out

to end the violence. During the disturbance four blacks were
7 shot, one fatally; approximately 150 fires were set; and over

300 persons were arrested. Approximately one percent of the
Marchers engaged in looting and violence and many of these were
people who were criminally inclined ahd who had been in previous

“trouble. The March 29, 1968, issue of the Manphis "Comercial
Appeal" reported that many of the looters and window breakers
were black power advocates, and that several wore jackets of
the "Invaders". However, other sources, including Lieutenant

E.H. Arkin of the Memphis Police Department, indicated that

-18-

many high school age students had put the word "Invaders" on

their jackets for effect and were not necessarily affiliated
with the BOP movement (HQ 157-9146-45). The violence and
disruption of the march was of great concern to Dr, King
because of the possible effect it might have on the planned
POCAM. Therefore, ‘he vowed to return to Memphis and
‘demonstrate that he had not lost his effectiveness in
| leading nonviolent marches. inneat
Dr. King, together with his SCLC staff, returned to
Memphis on April 3, 1968, at 10:33a.m. After a press
conference at the airport, the group proceeded to the Lorraine
Motel, arriving there at approximately 11:20a.m. At about’
12:05p.m. Dr. King left the Lorraine Motel for a meeting at
the Centenary Methodist Church (Security and SurvetLlance Rept.
of G.P. Tines, Inspector, Memphis Police Department, dated
July 17, 1968). Dr. King anounced at this meeting that his
purpose in returning to Memphis was to lead a mass march on
April 8, 1968 (HQ 157-9146-9 p.8).

However, on April 3, 1968, United States District
Court Judge Bailey Brown issued a temporary restraining order
against further marches in Memphis (HQ 157-9146-9, p.1).
Dr. King returned to the Lorraine Motel at 2:25p.m. and sometime
that afternoon Federal: Marshals served him and his aides with

the restraining order. (Security and Surveillance Rept. of
G.P. Tines, Inspector, Memphis Police Department, dated
July 17, 1968). .

At approximately 4:00p.m. Dr. King and the SCLC staff
met with the BOP group at which time Charles Cabbage requested
money to institute BOP plans to start a "Liberation School"
and a "Black Co-op’. Dr. King agreed to use his influence
to secure funds for BOP and Rev. Andrew Young agreed to help
write up a plan. It is believed these concessions were made
to BOP in order to keep them in line and prevent then fron
following a violent pattern. (HQ 157-9146-9, p.9)

* Qn the night of April 3, 1968, Dr. King spoke to
+ approximately 2,000 persons at the Mason Temple. He emphasized
that the scheduled mass march must be held on April 8, 1968,
to re-focus attention on the eight-week old sanitation workers

strike.

After the speech, Solomon Jones, in, serving as
Dr. King's chauffeur drove him back to the Lorraine Motel.
Dr. King told Jones to report back on Thursday morning,
April 4, 1968, at 8:30a.m. because he had to appear in court
in connection with a restraining order. (Memphis 4-1987-2522

's Activities on April 4, 1968

According to Mrs. Georgia M. Davis of Louisville,
Kentucky (FBI interview: HQ File 44-38861-2634, p.20) she,
Rev. A.D. Williams King, (Dr. King's brother) and Mrs. Lucie
Ward arrived in Manphis on April 4, 1968, from Florida and
registered at the Lorraine Motel at approximately 1:00a.m.
Upon inquiring about Dr. King, they were told that he wes
attending a strategy meeting at a church, ‘The ttiree’ then

- went to the church, but Dr. King was not there.

Returning to the mtel, Dr. King's brother,
Mrs. Davis and Mrs. Ward conversed in room 207 until they
observed Dr. King, along with Reverends Ralph Abernathy
and Bernard Lee, getting out of a taxicab in the motel
courtyard at about 4:30a.m. Dr. King was invited to room 207
woere he visited with his brother, Mrs. Davis and Mrs. Ward
until about 5:00a.m. He then went to room 306 where he .and_
Rev. Abernathy were registered. About a half hour later
Dr. King went to room 201 where he visited with Mrs. Davis
for approximately one hour. Afterwards he returned to room
306 for a strategy meeting scheduled for 8:00a.m.

Solomon Jones, Jr., Dr. King's chauffer, returned
to the Lorraine Motel at about 8:30a.m. to take him to court.

~21-



O O
However, Rev. Andrew Young advised Jones that he was going to
court instead of Dr. King. Therefore Jones was requested
to remain at the motel. (HQ 44-38861-2322, p.51).

Dr. King remained at the motel the entire day,
returning to room 201 at about 1:30p.m. to visit Mrs. Davis.
He was later joined in room 201 by his brother, Mrs. Ward,
Abernathy, Lee, Young, and Attorney Chauncey Eskridge.

The group conversed until about 5:45p.m. when Dr. King
amounced they were going to dinner at the hane of

Rev. Billy Kyles (HQ 44-38861-2634, p.23). */ Enroute to
room 306 to dress, Dr. King saw Solomon Jones, Jr. in the
motel courtyard and told him to start the car as they were
preparing to go to dinner (HQ 44-38861-2322, p.52).

%*/ There is a discrepancy in the exact time Dr. King returned

fo room 30. Mrs. Davis places the time at 5:45p.m. However,

in an FBI interview, Rev. Abermathy stated that on April 4,

1968, he and Dr. King did not leave the motel and spent most

of the day in room 306. He further stated that he and Dr. King

had been gone from their room for approximately one hour or

less when they returned to the room at about 5:30p.m. to get

ee. ne dimer at the home of Rev. Billy Kyles. (HQ i-30861~
P

~22-

NW 65360 Docld:32989802 Page 206



At approximately 6:00p.m. Dr. King and Rev. Abemathy

started to leave room 306. Rev. Abernathy stopped for a
moment and Dr. King walked out ‘onto the balcony just outside
the door to the room (HQ 44~-38861-2322, p.46). He saw Jones
standing beside the car on the ground level and began a
conversation about the weather. Jones advised Dr. King

that he should put on a topcoat as-it was cool outside.

During this conversation, Dr. King was facing west and Jones
was facing east and looking up at Dr. King fron the ground
level. As Dr. King acknowledged Jones' concern about getting
his topcoat, Jones heard a sound which he thought was a fire
eracker and Dr. King fell to the floor of the balcony in front
of room 306. Jones immediately called for help and a number
of Dr. King's aides, who were either in their rooms or standing
in the courtyard, rushed to his side (HQ 44-38861-2322, p.52). 2/

%/ Some critics of the FBI investigation have speculated that
Solomon Jones, Jr. set Dr. King up for the assassination by
unduly detaining him on the balcony. Nothing in the evidence
reviewed by the task force lends any credence to such speculation.

4. ° Intelligence and Local seis pints

a. FBI Informants. Robert G. Jensen, the Special
Agent in Charge of the Memphis Field Office, and Joseph
Hester, case agent for MURKIN, have unequivocally assured
the task force that there was no electronic surveillance of
Dr. King in Memphis. It was explained that.Memphis was not in
the mainstream of Dr. King's SCLC activities (Interview
of Special Agent Joe Hester, June 23, 1976, App.B).

However, FBI agents did observe the sanitation worker's -
strike activities for intelligence purposes and the Memphis
Police Department (MPD) and confidential paid informants did
supply. information to the field office (Interview of former
SAC Robert Jensen, July 7, 1976, App.B).

Our investigation disclosed that there were five paid
confidential informants providing intelligence regarding the
racial situation to the Memphis Field Office on a continuing
basis. The intelligence coverage provided by these individuals
related to the activities of the Nation of Islam, Black Students
Association of MSU, Students for a Democratic Society, Black ;
Organizing Power, Black United Front, Afro-American Brother-

hood, Invaders and the sanitation workers strike. There is

-24-

NW 65360 Docld:32989802 Page 208


no evidence that the activities of these informants related

directly to Dr. King. Moreover, there is no evidence
that would suggest that these informants were connected in
any way with the assassination of Dr.. King. HQ 134-11867;
170-1841; 170-1922; 170-2530 and 137-4885.)

b. MPD Infiltration of the Invaders. In addition
to the paid FBL informants, an officer of the MPD’ infiltrated
the Invaders in an undercover operation. The officer who was
later exposed and is no longer with the MPD, was interviewed .
by the task force. ‘The undercover assignment began in
February of 1968 for the specific purpose of infiltrating
the Invaders who became active about the same time of the
sanitation workers strike. According to the officer the
MPD was primarily interested in the Invaders, not Dr. King,
because the MPD was concerned about what they might do. The
police officer was, in fact, accepted as a member of the
Invaders and participated in their activities. On the
evening of April 4, 1968, when Dr. King was shot, the informant
had been on a shopping trip with Reverend James Bevel and
Reverend James Orange. The informant said he returned
to the Lorraine Motel at approximately 5:00p.m. and was
standing in the motel courtyard at the time Dr. King was
shot. He is positive that the shot that killed Dr. King

came from the rear of the buildings which front on South
Main Street.

c. MPD Surveillance Detail and Removal of Detective
Redditt from Duty. 2/ Brom the time of Dr. Ring's return
to Memphis on April 3, 1968, until the time of his
assassination, he was under physical surveillance by the
MPD. Upon leaming of Dr. King's flight schedule, Inspector
G.P. Tines of the MPD Inspectional Bureau instructed two
black plainclothes officers, Detective Edward E. Redditt-and
Patrolman Willie B, Richmond, to go to the airport to observé
the arrival of Dr. King and to keep him under continuous
surveillance in order to see with whom he came in contact.
According to Inspector Tines, the surveillance was ordered
because Dr. King was a controversial figure and had met with
local black militants on his prior visit to Memphis. While
at the airport a Mrs. Thomas Matthews pointed her finger at
Redditt and told him that she was going to get him. (Report
of G.P. Tines, July 17, 1968, Re: Security and Surveillance
of Dr. King, App. B.)

*/ The renoval of Redditt from. duty was cited as one of the

bases for the House Select Committee to investigate the
assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.

~26-

NW 65360 Docld:32989802 Page 210


In addition to the surveillance detail, Assistant
Chief of Police W.P. Huston ordered a detail of four men,
commanded by Inspector Don H. Smith, to go to the airport
for the purpose of providing security for Dr. King. While
waiting for Dr. King to arrive, Mrs. Thomas Matthews
advised Lieutenant George K. Davis that she had come to the
airport to pick up Dr. King and that no one had asked for
police to be assigned to him. Inspector Smith also asked
Reverend James Lawson where they were going when they left
the airport and he replied: "We have not fully made up our
minds.'' Nevertheless, when Dr, King and his party left the
airport, Inspector Smith and his men followed then to the
Lorraine Motel, arriving there at approximately 11:20a.m.
With the assistance of Inspector J.S. Gaglian and two other
officers, Inspector Smith and his men secured the entrances
to the mtel.

"Dr, King and his party left the Lorraine Motel at
approximately 12:05pm. and were followed by the security
detail to the Centenary Methodist Church where a meeting
was held. The detail secured the front and rear entrances
of the Church until approximately 2:15p.m. when Dr. King and
his group returned to the motel. The security detail then
returned to the motel area and resumed their positions until

they were ordered to headquarters by Chief J.C, Macdonald

-27-

NW 65360 Docld:32989802 Page 211



O O

at approximately 5:05p.m. Inspector G.P. Tines stated in
his report that he was not conferred with and has no idea
why the security detail was removed from Dr. King after
5:05p.m. Former Chief Macdonald has no present recollection
of the security detail (interview of James C. Macdonald,
former Chief MPD, December 22, 1976, App. B.) ‘The security
detail was not resumed on April 4, 1968, (Reports of
Inspectors Don H. Smith and J.S. Gagliano as incorporated
in Report of Inspector G.P. Tines, supra.)

As a separate activity fran the security detail,
Detective Redditt and Patrolman Richmond went to the airport
on April 3rd and observed Dr. King's arrival. When Dr. King
left the airport they followed him to the Lorraine Motel
and learned that he was registered in room 306. Redditt
telephoned headquarters and informed Inspector Tines where
Dr. King was staying. At approximately 12:05p.m. Redditt
and Richmond followed Dr. King and his party to the
Centenary Methodist Church where a closed meeting of
approximately 30 black ministers was scheduled. Redditt
again called headquarters and advised his superiors of his
location. Redditt was instructed to leave Richmond at the
church and for him to return to the area of the Lorraine
Motel for the purpose of finding a suitable place where
close surveillance could be kept on the motel. Richmond
remained at the Centenary Methodist Church until the

-28-

| NW 65360 Docld:32989802 Page 212


meeting was over at approximitely 2:15p.m. Richmond then

went to Clayborn Temple where he thought Dr. King would
address the sanitation workers prior to a scheduled 3:00p.m.
march. However, Dr. King did not make an appearance there.
Richmond telephoned headquarters at about 3:30p.m. and was =e
advised that Dr. King had returned. to the motel and that =
Redditt had set up a surveillance post at Fire Station No. 2,
located at South Main and Butler streets. Richmond
immediately left Clayborn Temple and joined Redditt at the
fire station. (Interview of Patrolman W.B. Richmond,
April 9, 1968, MPD Statements, State v. James Earl Ray
p. 1444).

The rear of Fire Station No. 2 overlooks the Lorraine
Motel and provided an excellent vantage point where Redditt
and Richmond could observe Dr. King and his associates as
they entered and left the motel. On April 3, 1968, Redditt
and Richnond remained at theix observation post until 6:35p.m.
at which time they were relieved by Lieutenant E.H. Arkin
and Lieutenant J.V. Papia of the MPD Internal Security Bureau.
(Statement of Edward E. Redditt, April 10, 1968, MPD Statements,
State vs. James Far] Ray p. 1453).

After leaving their observation post, Redditt and
Richmond went to the Mason Temple where Dr. King was

~29-

NW 65360 Docld:32989802 Page 213



O oO

scheduled to address a mass meeting. Shortly after they
arrived at the temple, Redditt was approached by Reverend
Malcomb D, Blackburn and told that the word was out that

he was’ over in the fire station near the Lorraine Yotel

spying with binoculars. Reverend: Blackburn also advised
Richnond that the temple was the wrong place for him

because the tension was too high. Fearing they would be
exposed, Redditt and Richmond left the.meeting at approximately
8:50p.m. (Report of Inspector G.P. Tines.)

Redditt and Richrond resumed their surveillance
of the Lorraine Motel from Fire Station No. 2 on April 4,
1968, at 10:30a.m. At approximately 12:50p.m. Reddite
received a threatening telephone call from a.fanale ‘who
stated that he was doing the black people wrong, and they
were going to do him seonsi=| (Interview of Edward E. Redditt,
April 10, 1968.)

At approximately 4:00p.m.., Redditt was ordered by
telephone to leave the fire station and report to headquarters
where he was advised that: threats had been made on his life.
He was, therefore, ordered to move his family into a mtel
under ‘an assumed name by Frank Holloman, former Director
of Police and Fire, Memphis, Tenn. (Interview of Frank
Holloman, September 15, 1976, App. B.) Redditt was taken

~30-

NW 65360 Docid:32989802 Page 214


NW 65360 Docld:32989802 Page 215

home in a squad car, but refused to move his family because

of a sick relative. At about the.time the squad car arrived
in front of Redditt's residence, it was announced on the
radio that Dr. King had been shot. After a couple of days,
Redditt did not hear any more about the threat on his life.
(Interview of Edward E. Redditt, July 8, 1976, App. B.)

In our efforts to trace the Source of the threat, we
have found that Philip R. Mamel, an investigator with the
Senate Investigating Comittee, chaired .by Senator McClellan
was in Memphis on april 4, 1968. While at the MPD Manuel
advised then based on a telephone call to his office in
Washington, that the Senate Committee Staff had information
from an informant in Mississippi that the Mississippi
Freedom Democratic Party had made plans to kill a "Negro

_ lieutenant" in Memphis. Manuel left Memphis on a 5:50p.m.
£light to Washington and the next day (April 5, 1968) he.
telephoned the MPD and. advised them that the threat was on
the life of a "Negro lieutenant" in Knoxville rather than
Memphis. (Report of Inspector G.P. Tines, July 17, 1968,
supra.)

Philip R. Mamiel neither has a, present recollection
of providing the information regarding the threat to the MPD, ,

nor does he have a memorandum of the event. However, he

~31-



O O

confirmed that he was in Memphis and visited the MPD at
the time stated and that his office did have a Mississippi
source. Moreover, he said the events sounded familar and
he believed the MPD records were correct. (Interview of
Philip R. Manuel, September 28, 1976, App. B.)

Although Redditt was relieved fron duty at Fire
Station No. 2, Richmond remained there and continued to
observe who entered and left the motel. At approximately
6:00p.m. Richmond saw Dr. King leave his room and walk °
to the handrail on the balcony. ‘The Reverend Billy Kyles
was standing off to Dr. King's right. An instant later
Richmond heard a loud sound similar to a shot and saw
Dr. King fall back from the handrail and put his hand up
to his head. at approximately 6:01p.m. Richmond telephoned
headquarters and reported that Dr. King had been shot.

He was instructed to remain at the fire station. Richmond
then yelled to wenbers of a MPD tactical squad (which had
stopped at the station a few moments earlier) that he
believed Dr. King had been shot. He then ran to the front

of the fire station and looked north and south on South Main ,
Street, but did not see anyone running or walking, except

the men in the tactical squad who left the fire station
running in different directions. Shortly thereafter,

Captain J.G, Ray arrived at the fire station and instructed
Richmond to go to headquarters and make a detailed report
of what he had seen. (Interview of Patrolman W.B. Richmond,
April 9, 1968, supra.)
ad. Details of Two Black Firemen fron Fire Station
No. 2.*/ As of April 3, 1968, Norvell E. Wallace and Floyd E.
Newsum were the only black firemen assigned to Fire Station
No. 2 of the Memphis Fire Department (MFD). Wallace was
working the night shift on April 3rd and Newsum was scheduled
to report for the day shift on April 4th. Both of these
individuals actively supported the sanitation workers strike,
attending their rallies and making financial contributions.
In our interview of Wallace (Interview July 8, 1976
App. B.) he stated that at about 10:00 or 10:30 on the night
of April 3rd his captain told him that a call had come, in
requesting that a-man be detailed to Fire Station No. 33.
He was immediately detailed to No. 33 although it was raining :
and he was preparing to go to bed. Wallace further stated
that while Fire Station No. 33 was understaffed as a whole,
there was no shortage of personnel for the pump truck on which
he worked. Otherwise, he does not know why he was detailed.

Also, on the night of April 3rd Fireman Newsun, in
a wholly personal capacity, attended a rally at the Mason
Temple where Dr. King made his last speech. When he retumed
home (about 10:30p.m.) there was a message for him to call
Lt. J. Smith at the fire department. When he called,

Lt. J. Smith ordered him to report to Fire Station No. 31
on the morning of April 4th rather than Fire Station No. 2.
Newsum claims that Fire Station No. 31 was overstrength at
the time and his detail made his company short. Moreover,
he says he never has received a satisfactory explanation
why he was detailed. However, he did say that Lt. Barnett
at one time told him he was detailed at the request ofthe
police. (Interview of Floyd E. Newsum, July 8, 1976,

App. B.)

Interviews of past and present members of the MFD have
failed to disclose the individual who initiated the order or
the reason for detailing Wallace and Newsun. According to
former Lt. Jack Smith, he received a telephone call between
3:00p.m. and 5:00p.m. on April 3, 1968, fran either Captain
James T. Baity.or former Assistant Chief Arthur J. Rivalto
in the personnel department specifically requesting that
Newsum be detailed. No reason was given for the detail.

Smith said he inmediately called Newsum, but Newsum was not

home. ‘Therefore, Smith left a message for Newsum to call

the fire station. Newsum called about 10:30p.m. and Smith
advised him of the detail (Interview of Jack Smith, dated
September 27, 1976).

Wallace's commanding officer, then Captain R.T.
Johnson, likewise stated that he received a telephone
call fran someone in the persormmel department requesting
him to detail Wallace. However, Johnson has no present
recollection of who the individual was ‘that made the
request. (Interview of R.T. Johmson, Deputy Chief, Memphis
Fire Department, December 21, 1976, App. B.)

Neither Captain Baity nor former Assistant Chief
Rivalto has any present recollection of the detail of
Wallace or Newsum. Captain Baity indicated that any
district chief could have ordered the men moved (Interview
of James T. Baity, September 27, 1976, App. B). Also,
former Assistant Chief Rivalto said the fire department
shifted people around all the time when a company became
understrength because of sickness, etc. (Interview of
Arthur J. Rivalto, September 27, 1976, App. 8).

Similarly, the former Chief of the MFD, Edward A.
Hamilton, has no recollection of the details. He speculated
that the men could have been detailed for a "fill in" to
bring a company up to strength (Interview of Edward A.
Hamilton, September 27, 1976, App. B).

The MFD Strenth Report-Firefighting Personnel for
Shift "A", Battalions One and Eight, dated April 3, 1968
(attached to Reinterview of James R. Boatwright, October 20,
1976, App. B) show that Wallace's Company No. 2 at Fire
Station No. 2 was operating at minimm strength (five men)
after he was detailed; whereas Company No. 33 to which he
was detailed operated at one over the minimm strength
(four men) after the detail. Likewise, the Strength Report
for Shift "B" for Battalions One and Two, dated April 4,
1968 (Also attached to the Boatwright interview of October 20,
1976) show that Newsum's Company No. 55 at Fire Station No. 2
was Operating at minimm strength (five men) after the detail,
but Company 31 to witich he was detailed operated at one over
the minima strength (four men) after the detail.

However, former Deputy Chief James 0. Barnett stated
that the people on the security detail operating out of
the fire station probably felt better without Wallace and
Newsum around (Interview of James 0. Barnett, September 27,
1976.) On the other hand, Assistant Chief James R. Boatwright
explained that they were having a very tense situation at
the time; that a number of threatening calls had been
received at Fire Station No. 2; and that the consensus of
opinion was that Wallace and Newsum were detailed for their
own protection, since they were the only black firemen assigned
to that station (Interview of James R. Boatwright, September 23,
1976).

NW 65360 Docid:32989802 Page 220



Jn this connection MPD Patrolman Willie B. Richrond

and former Detective Edward E. Redditt, who conducted the
surveillance of Dr. King and his associates from the fire
station, were recontacted and specifically asked whether
they had’ requested that Wallace and Newsum be detailed.
Both Richmond and Redditt denied that they made such a
wequést or had knowledge of any one else in the police
department making such a request (Reinterviews of Richmond
and Redditt, September 28, 1976, App. B).

Our investigation has not disclosed any evidence
that the detail of Wallace and Newsum was in any way
connected with the assassination of Dr. King. However,
the circumstances surrounding the details strongly suggest
that both men were detailed because they supported the
sanitation workers and were considered to be.a threat to
the security of the surveillance of Dr. King conducted fron
the fire station by Patrolman Richmond and Detective Redditt.

e. MPD Tactical Units- Their Deployment and

Activities on the Evening of April. 4, 1968. When the sanitation

workers of Memphis began their strike in February of 1968, the
MPD either organized.or beefed up various tactical units.
Generally, each. of these units consisted of 12 law enforcement

officers fron the MPD and the Shelby County Sheriff's Department.

These units were organized for the purpose of avoiding riots
which other cities, such as Detroit, had experienced (Interview
of Frank Holloman, former Director of Fire and Police for the
City of Memphis, September 15, 1976, App. B). Documents
obtained from the State's Attorney General (Item 9 from MPD
Miscellaneous Records) show that on the evening of April 4,
1968, at the time Dr. King was shot, there were nine tactical

units in service at various locations as follows:

In addition to the tactical units, the documents
obtained from the State's Attorney General show that there
were ten regular police cars (with 3 to 4 men per car) in
the general area of the Lorraine Motel. These cars were

at the following locations at the time Dr. King was shot:

shooting. On the afternoon of April 4, 1968, Tact Unit 10,
consisting of three cars and 12 mn stopped at Fire Station
No. 2 for a rest break at approximately 5:50p.m. The unit
was commanded by Lt. Judson E, Ghormley of the Shelby County
Sheriff's Department. The other members of the unit included
Deputies W.A, DuFour, W.J. Berry, Vernon Dollahite, R.N. Baker
and Ronald Maley of the sheriff's department; and Patrolmen
Carroll Dunn, William Gross, Jason Morris, Barney Wright,
Emmett Douglass and Torrance Landers of the MPD.

Interviews of the above named men indicate that when
the unit arrived at the fire station, the cars were parked
on the north side of the fire station entrance with the lead
car actually obstructing the sidewalk. The second car was
parked directly behind the lead car and the third car was
double parked alongside these two cars. (MPD Statements,
State v. James Earl Ray, DuFour p.1449; Berry p.1450;
Ghommley pp.1451 and 1532; Dollahite pp.1455 and 1505;
Dun p.1457; Gross p.1460; Morris p.1463; Wright p.1466;
Baker p.1468; Douglass p.1469; Landers p.1471 and Maley
p. 1480.)

While Patrolman Douglass remained with the lead car
to monitor the radio, all of the other men went into the fire
station to take a break. When the shot was fired that killed

Dr. King (at approximately 6:0lp.m.), these men were at various
~40-

NW 65360 Docld:32989802 Page 224 t



locations in the fire station drinking coffee, making telephone

calls, etc. Patrolman Richmond, who was manning the surveillance
post in the rear of the station, yelled throughout the station
that Dr. King had been shot. The members of the tact unit,
some of whom had heard the shot, all ran out the north side
of the fire station and then east toward the rear of the fire
station and the Lorraine Motel. (See diagram of ‘crime scene,
App. A. Ex. 2).

Patrolman Douglass, who had remained in the lead car
to monitor the radio, heard the shot when it was fired, He
immediately got out of the car and ran toward the rear of the
fire station with the other men, After Patrolman Douglass
realized what had happened, he returned to the lead car, along
with Patrolman Wright, and radioed the dispatcher that Dr. King
had been shot. Douglass and Wright then dtove the lead car
south on §. Main to E. Butler, east on E. Butler to Mulberry
and north on Mulberry to the entrance of the Lorraine Motel.
Douglass and Wright later drove the car, accompanied by one
or two other unidentified officers, north on Mulberry to
Huling, west on Huling to S. Main and south on S. Main to the

front of the buildings located just north of the fire station. */

%*/ There are conflicts in the statements of Douglass, Wright

and Ghormley: Douglass stated that Ghormley and other unidentified
officers got in the car with him at the fire station and they drove
to the Lorraine Motel. According to Wright's version, he and
Douglass left the fire station together and picked up one or two
other unidentified officers at the Lorraine Motel. On the other
hand, Ghormley claims he turned around at the concrete wall at the
rear of the fire station and ran to the front of the station and
then north on S. Main Street.

O O

The other men in the tact uit continued to the rear
of the fire station to a concrete retaining wall abutting
Mulberry Street. DuFour, Dollahite, Morris, Baker, Landers,
Maley and Dum climbed down the concrete wall and ran across
Mulberry Street to the Lorraine Motel. DuFour and Morris ran
up the stairs to the balcony where Dr. King's body lay.

The people there said the shot had come from a red brick
building north of the fire station on S. Main Street. While
DuFour remained-with Dr. King's body until the ambulance came,
Morris ran north on Mulberry to Huling and west on Huling to
the north side of the buildings facing S. Main Street. Another
officer (probably Maley or Dunn) was already at that point,

and Morris stopped there to assist him in securing that area.

Baker ran to the Motel balcony where DuFour was standing
beside Dr. King's body. He then ran back to Mulberry St. and
ran north for a distance to an alley. Baker ran into the
alley looking for anything suspicious. He noticed that
other members of the tact unit were securing a building
(probably the building with its north end on Huling).
Therefore, Baker went to the corner of Mulberry and E. Butler
and took up a position there.

After Landers learned the direction the shot came
from, he found a 55-gallon drum and climbed back up the

conerete retaining wall on Mulberry St. into the lot on

~42-

NW 65360 Docld:32989802 Page 226



which the. building where the shot was fired is located. Landers

observed that the bathroom window was partially opened and
he saw an elderly white male come up to the window and look out ,
He ordered him to get back fran the window. Landers also saw
an elderly white female looking out a window ‘directly south
of the bathroom window. He ordered her to get away from the
window. Landers also checked the bushes on the lot for
evidence and checked the entire area for footprints. After
other officers arrived, Landers and another ‘MPD officer
climbed onto the roof of a one story building which backs
up to Milberry St. This building runs along the north side
of the building whence the shot was fired. Finding nothing
on the roof, they came dow and started up an alley leading
to a basement. About 10 feet up the alley they found two
fresh footprints in the mud. Landers guarded these footprints
until homicide detectives arrived on the scene. Subsequently,
a plaster case was made of each footprint . However, the
footprints were never positively identified by either the
‘MPD or the FBI.

Upon learning where the shot was fired from, Dollahite
and Maley ran out of the motel courtyard, tumed north on
Mulberry to Huling and west on Huling toward S. Main. Maley
stopped in the center of the block and began guarding the

~43-

NW 65360 Docld:32989802 Page 227



north end of the building. However, Dollahite continued mmning
(with gun draw) to S. Main and turned south on S. Main.
Dollahite noticed a mmber of patrons in Jim's Grill at 418

S. Main. He ran into the cafe and ordered everyone to remain
seated and not to leave. Dollahite then stopped momentarily
at Canipe's Amusement Company located at 424 S. Main where

he observed a green bed spread lying in the doorway partially
covering a blue suitcase and a box containing a rifle. As he
continued down S. Main a short distance near a fenced-in
parking area, Dollahite observed Lt. Ghormley and another
officer coming north on S. Main. Dollahite turned around

at that point and walked back to Canipe's store ahead of

Lt. Ghormlley and then crossed the street for the purpose of
securing the front of the building. After he took up his
position, Douglass and Wright drove up in the lead car.

Other officers who did not climb down the retaining
wall at the rear of the fire station and run to the motel
are Ghomley, Gross and Berry. After rumning to the
retaining wall and observing the people pointing to the
building on S. Main St., Berry came back to the fire station
entrance, jumped in a cruiser and drove north on S. Main to
the first intersection at Huling where he stopped the car -
in the street and secured that area.

~4h-

NW 65360 Docld:32989802 Page 228


Ghomley and Gross also returned to the front of”
the fire station after first rmming to the retaining wall.
They both turned north on S. Main and ran toward Huling.
Ghormley stopped at Canipe’s Amisement Co. where he observed
what: appeared to be a blanket partially covering a blue
suitcase and a Browning rifle box with about a foot of the
barrel of a rifle exposed. ,
The apparent discrepancies in the statements of
Ghommley and Dollahite can be accounted for only by the
7 mass confusion which must have occurred immediately after
the shooting. However, it appears that Dollahite first
observed the bimdle while ruming south on s. Main with
his gun drawn. But, he contimed past Canipe's Amusement
Company and after he saw Ghormley and the other officer
coming north he turned around and took up a position on the
opposite side of the street from Canipe's.

Guy H. canipe, the owner of Canipe's Amusement Co.,
infonmed Ghommley that a white male had just dropped the
bundle in front of his door a minute or two earlier and had
run south on S. Main. Ghormley radioed this information to
headquarters and stood guard over the articles. Shortly there-
after, Canipe told Ghormley that a white Mustang automobile
had left the area at a high rate of speed after the bundle was
dropped. Ghormley also radioed this information to headquarters.

According to the transcript of the MPD radio tapes
(MPD James Earl Ray Supplements, Attomey General's copy,
Supplement 79, p.1714) Tact Unit 10 advised the dispatcher
that Dr. King had been shot at the lorraine Motel at 6:03p.m.
By 6:06p.m., the dispatcher had ordered a circle formed
around the Lorraine Motel and the buildings west of the
motel on S. Main. Moreover, patrol cars and other Tact
Units had begun to arrive on the scene. At 6:07p.m. Tact
Unit 10 advised the dispatcher that the weapon was in front
of 424 S. Main and that the subject ran south on S. Main.

At 6:08p.m. the subject was described as a well-dressed, young,
white’male. At 6:l0p.m. the dispatcher relayed information
from Tact Unit 10, that the subject had left the area in a
late model white Mustang.

The men in the Tact Units and patrol cars kept the
area sealed off, directed traffic, and checked out suspicious
individuals while detectives from the Homicide Squad investi-
gated the scene. Inspector Nevelyn E. Zachary of the MPD
Homicide Squad arrived at the Lorraine Motel at approximately
6:15p.m., and by 6:30p.m. he had taken custody of the bundle
of articles found in thie doorway of Canipe's Amusement.
Zachary. turned the bundle, except for a tee shirt and pair
of shorts, over to the FBI at about 9:30 or 10:00p.m. The
tee shirt and shorts were also turned over to the FBI after
the laundry marks were checked with local laundries (Interview
of former Inspector Nevelyn E. Zachary, September 15, 1976,

App. B).

B. ‘The FBI Investigation Of The Assassination

1. The. Department of Justice’ Response _and FBI

‘errormance

_a. The Murder. At approximately 6:00 p.m. on
April 4, 1968, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., was standing
on the balcony outside of his room at the Lorraine Motel
in Memphis, Tennessee. Moments later, Dr. King was shot
by a high power rifle and then rushed to St. Joséph's
Hospital. At 7:05 p.m. he was pronounced dead. The
cause of death was a bullet wound which tore the major
neck blood vessels and severed the spinal cord at the
root of the neck (Memphis 44-1987 Sub sec. 1-13, and see
aitopsy report, App. A, Ex. 3).

b. Top Priority Investigation Ordered. ‘The Memphis
Police Department was immediately awate of the King assault
and promptly notified the FBI Memphis Field Office headed by
SAC Robert G, Jensen. SAC Jensen telephonically relayed the
information to Washington where Director Hoover and Attorney
General Clark were informed. The Memphis Field Office was
directed on the evening of April 4, 1968 to immediately conduct
a full investigation of the matter as a possible violation
of 18 U.S.C. 241, the civil rights conspiracy statute (HQ 44-
38861-109) .

~47-

NW 65360 Docld:32989802 Page 231



O O

This directive soon became national, in scope with
SAC's in all FBI Field Offices being ordered by teletype
on April 7, 1968, to participate and conduct a top priority
investigation under their personal supervision. .This meant
all .leads were to be afforded immediate, thorough and
imaginative attention and all possibilities from such leads
exhausted. Also, 24 hours was set as the period after receipt
of a lead within which the investigation and reporting must
be completed. All SAC's were to bear personal responsibility
for any failure to handle the investigation (HQ 44-38861-153).

c. Progress of the Investigation. The breadth of
this top priority investigation 1s repeatedly evidenced in
the Murkin files. All informant sources - racial, security
and criminal - were immediately alerted and contacted for
information. ‘The KKK and other hate groups as well as
individuals know to have violent proclivities were checked.
The files were checked for prior threats against Martin Luther
King, Jr. (HQ 44-38861-2649). Name checks were continuously
being made on Selective Service records, city and telephone
directories, drivers license bureaus, motor vehicle divisions,
financial institutions, credit records, criminal and civil
records, marriage licenses, public utility rolls, wions,
common carrier passenger lists and more (e.g. HQ 44-38861-233).

(1) Bessie Brewer's Rooming House. Key information
was developed early at Bessie Brewer's Roaming House whence

~48-

NW 65360 Docld:32989802 Page 232



the shot was fired. Bessie Brewer, Charles A. Stephens

and William C. Anchutz were interviewed and a physical
description of a suspect was obtained.

Bessie Brewer, resident. manager of the rooming house,
explained that a "John Willard” registered with her April 4,
between 3:00 p.m. and 3:30 p.m. He was first directed to
Room 8, but rejected it because it had a stove and refrig-
erator. Instead, he aeeet for a sleeping room only and
accepted Room 5-B in the rear of the hostelry. This room
provided a window with a view of Dr. King's room at the
Lorraine Motel. Mrs. Brewer! described the new tenant as
awhite male approximately 35 years of age, 5'11" to 6' tall,
weighing 180 pounds with a mediun build and presenting a neat
clean appearance (Memphis 44-1987 Sub Sec. 1-15).

Stephens, who was in his room on the afternoon of
April 4, remetbers hearing footsteps between Room 5-B
and the bathroom. He also remenbers the bathroom being
occupied for considerable periods of time - 20 to 30 minutes -
without water munning or the toilet being flushed except for
the last visit. ‘This last visit ended when he heard what
he is certain was a gun shot. Interrupted by the shot,
| Stephens opened his door to the hallway to see a mn uming
down the hallway carrying a large wrapped bundle. As this
man ran down the hall in the direction of Anchutz, Stephens

| -NW-65360_Docld:32989802 Page 233



oO oO

recalls believing that he had seen this person earlier

that aftermoon with Mrs. Brewer. Stephens described him

as a white male of average build, in his 30's, 5'10" to 11"
tall, weighing 165 pounds and wearing a dark suit presenting
a neat clean appearance (Memphis 44-1987 Sub A sec. 1).

Like Stephens, Anchutz was a resident of the rooming

, house and in his room at the time of the shooting. Also

like Stephens, Anchutz occupied a room adjacent to 'John
Willard." He recalls watching television in his room that
afternoon when he heard.a gun shot. Inmediately, he went

to the door and as he opened it saw a man running toward him.
‘This man covered his face as he ran and carried a blanket
wrapped bundle. Anchutz addressed the man, saying: "I
thought ‘I heard a shot." The man responded: "Yeh, it was a
shot." Anchutz described the man as 6' tall. with a slim
‘build and in his 30's (Memphis 44-1987 Sub A sec. 1).

(2) Canipe Amusement Company. ‘Thé Canipe Amisément
“Company is located at 424 South Main Street and is just a
short distance from Bessie Brewer's Rooming House at 422%
South Main Street. In the recessed entrance to Canipe Company
a blanket wrapped bundle (presumably ‘the bundle Stephens
and Anchutz saw) containing valuable pieces of physical

evidence was recovered shortly after the shooting.

-50-

NW 65360 Docid:32989802 Page 234


The store omer, Guy W. Canipe, and two customers,

Bernell Finley and Julius L. Graham, were in the store at the
time of the assassination. Each was interviewed by the
FBI and described hearing a "thud" which drew their attention,
and as they looked to see what had happened, they observed
the blanket wrapped bundle in the entrance. At the same
time, they saw a man dressed in a dark suit walking rapidly
south on the sidewalk avay from the bundle. A few moments
later, they said, a white compact autanobile - possibly a
Mustang - proceeded north on South Main Street at a high
rate of speed. The male was described as white, approximately
30 years of age with 7 medium build, 5'10" to 6' tall and
weighing 160 to 180 pounds. (Memphis 44-1987 Sub A sec 1).
The bundle, after being discovered at Canipe's doorway
by a member of a Memphis Police Department Tactical Squad,
first came into the custody of Inspector Zachary of the
Memphis Police Department's Homicide Bureau. Later in the
evening of April 4, 1968, between 9:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m.,
Inspector Zachary delivered the bundle to SAC Jensen who
immediately had it flown by agent courier to Washington for
laboratory examination (Memphis 44-1987-610). The bundle
contained a Model 760 Remington Gamemaster rifle, 30-06
Springfield caliber, and a blue zipper bag. The bag contained

various toilet articles along with a pair of men's underwear’

-51-

with laundry tags, a pair of binoculars, two cans of

beer, and a paper bag bearing an advertisement for York
Arms Company, Memphis, Tennessee, with. a York Arms Campany
cash sales receipt dated April 4, 1968 (Memphis 44-1987
Sub A sec 1).

(3) Information and Physical Evidence Tracked. The
investigation continued with emphasis on tracing all physical
evidence and information received. To this end a search
of all Memphis area hotels and motels was initiated for
the source of the blanket and bar of soap found in the blue
zipper bag. Also, registrations at area inns were examined
for the unknown suspect who fled the rooming house and who .
might be driving a white compact automobile. At the same

, time, the rifle, scope, binoculars, cans of beer, laundry
tags and other items were tracked (HQ 44-38861-139) . :

The rifle and scope were quickly traced to the Aero
Marine Supply Company in Birmingham, Alabama. The rifle
was sold to a "Harvey Lowmyer'' March 30, 1968. The scope, _
along with a second rifle, was purchased March 29, 1968,
but "Lownyer'' exchanged this rifle the following day for
the one recovered at the Canipe Amisement Company. Accord-
ing to the Aero Marine salesman, "Lownyer" explained that
he talked: with his brother and was advised a more powerful

rifle was necessary for deer hunting in Wisconsin. However,

~52-

NW 65360 Docld:32989802 Page 236 H


a laboratory examination of this retuned rifle revealed

that it was clogged with cosmoline (a heavy grease firearm
preservative) and could not be loaded and readied to fire
(HQ 44-38861-432). The salesman also provided a physical
description of "Lownyer™ which matched those previously
obtained (HQ 44-38861-180) .

The paper bag and the sales receipt from York Ams
Company led agents to the Memphis tore where the binoculars
were purchased. The York Arms salesman explained that he
sold the pair of binoculars at approximately 4:00 p.m.

April 4, 1968, to a white male matching the descriptions
previously obtained (Memphis 44-1987 Sub A sec. 1). By
checking the manufacturer's can codes and distribution records,
the two beer cans were traced to Southhaven Mirmow Shop,
Southhaven, Mississippi (HQ 44-38861-1360).

The center of the investigation shifted from Memphis
to Birmingham on April 9, when the search of Memphis inns.
focused on the Rebel Motel and the April 3 registration
record of an Eric Starvo Galt. It was already known that
the rifle and scope were purchased in Birmingham and the
Galt registration also pointed to Birmingham. The registra-
tion record aroused interest because Galt registered for the
night of April 3 only, listed a Birmingham address and drove a
Mustang with Alabama licensé, plates, (HQ 44-38861-1180) .

-53-

NW 65360 Docld:32989802 Page 237



oO oO

The possibility of a link between Eric Starvo
Galt and the unknown subject was pursued in Alabama by the
Birmingham and Mobile offices. In their pursuit they
learned that on August 29, 1967, Galt purchased a 1966
white Mustang automobile. The Bureau agents also learned
that the State of Alabama issued a motor vehicle operator's
license in October 1967 to Eric Starvo Galt, 2608 Highland
Avenue, Birmingham, Alabama. The physical description
obtained from this license matched those previously received:
white male, born July 20, 1931, 5'11" tall, 175 pounds with
blue eyes and brown hair (HQ 44-38861-1180).

When the investigation moved to Galt's Birmingham
address it was learned that Galt lived there in late August
until early October 1967. Because of the length of this
contact, emphasis was placed on developing information on
‘Galt's background. Significantly, it was learned that during
his Birmingham sojoum Galt expressed an enthusiastic
interest in dancing and attended dancing school there
(HQ 44-38861-607).

(4) Los Angeles. Soon after the Birmingham connection
was uncovered Los Angeles became a focal point in the investi-
gation. The significance of Los Angeles became apparent
April 11, with the knowledge of four facts.

One, when on April 11, 1968, the Bureau located Galt's
abandoned Mustang in Atlanta a search of it indicated that

“54+

NW 65360 Docid:32989802 Page 238


Galt had had it serviced twice in the Los Angelés area
(HQ 44-38861-989) .

Two, also incident to the search of the Mustang a
fragment of cardboard torn fron a Kleenex box was found.

On it were the names and Los Angeles addresses of Anita :
Katzwinkel and Ginger Nance (HQ 44-38861-989) . :

Three, latmdry markings from the recovered underwear
were tracked to Home Service Laundry and Dry Cleaning,
Hollywood, California (HQ 44-38861-885). The following
day agents learned that the name Eric Starvo Galt appeared
in the lamdry's records. -

Lastly, a pair of pliers recovered from ‘the blue
zipper bag were traced to the Rompagé Hardware Store which
is within five blocks of Home Service Laundry and Dry
Cleaning (HQ 44 38861-11 74).

Since it was know that while in Bimnitigham Galt
pursued an interest in dancing, all dance schools in.the
Los Angeles area were checked. Galt's name appeared in
the records of the National Dance: Studio, Los Angeles.
(44-38861- 1293).

Eventually, the dance studio contact proved to be
most important because it was through an interview with the
dance studio ae that a photograph of Eric Staxvo Galt was
finally obtained. The ower keyed the agents to an interest

~55-

|. NW 65360 Docld:32989802 Page 239


O O

Galt had expressed in attending a bartending school

(HQ 44-38861-1066). Checking the area, the International
School of Bartending was located and it provided Galt's
graduation photograph. For the first time, agents were

able to see and distribute a photo of their subject. To be
sure of maximm dissemination, the photo was circulated among
the news media (HQ 44-38861-967).

While in Los Angeles Galt first lived at the Serrano
Apartments and later at the St. Francis Hotel. Persons
contacted at these locations called him a "loner" and
described him as a person who-kept to himself. A departure
from this characterization, however, was reported by Charles
Stein who, at no expense to himself, rode with Galt in the
Mustang from Los Angeles to New Orleans and return.

Stein explained that he and his sister Rita Stein met
Galt through their cousin Marie Martin who was working as a
bar maid at the’Sultan Bar located in the St. Francis Hotel.
Galt had mentioned to Martin that he was planning to drive
to New Orleans and she asked if he would be willing to give -
her cousin a ride there in order to pick up her children.

He agreed, but it was Charles and not Rita who went along
with Galt (HQ 44-38861-1117).
Notwithstanding the information Stein provided, the

investigation moved no closer to locating Galt. New Orleans

-56-

NW 65360 Docld:32989802 Page 241

was scoured for clues and although Galt's hotel and room

were located the effort was fruitless (HQ 44-38861-1197) .
Stein also stated Galt made several telephone: calls fran
pay telephones along the way but an exhaustive search of
countless telephone records, mumbers and subscribers
produced nothing (e.g. HQ. 44-38861-3857). Lastly, Stein
explained that Galt conditioned the ride to New Orleans
an Charles Stein, Rita Stein and Marie Martin joining
George Wallace's American Independent Party. Each joined
but again the ensuing investigation of this lead learned
nothing (HQ 44-38861-1003) . i

(5) Atlanta. On April 11, 1968, a citizen call came
through to the Atlanta Police Department reporting the missing
white Mustang. According to this caller and another person,
both interviewed by the FBI, the abandoned Mustang was parked
shortly before 9:00 a.m. April 5, 1968, by a lone man matching
Galt's description. The discovery of Galt's Mustang immediately
caused agents to seek out any additional contacts by Galt in
Atlanta (HQ 44-38861-989) .

Because Galt was believed to use low cost rooming houses
all such establishments were contacted for any sign of him.
Success was found at Jimmie Dalton Gardner's Rooming House
where Galt registered March 24, 1968. Although Galt was
nowhere to be found, he had left evidence behind. Found

smithing" and a collection of maps. One of these maps
was of the city of Atlanta with the residence of Martin
Luther King, Jr., arid the headquarters of SCLC circled
(HQ 44-38861-967) .

Other evidence of Galt's presence in Atlanta was
received from the Piedmont Laudry where records showed
he picked up laundry April 5, 1968 (HQ 44-38861-3627).

(6) Galt Identified as James Earl Ray. Knowing that
Galt returned to Atlanta after the assassination all con-
ceivable modes of transportation in, around and out of
Atlanta were checked (HQ 44-38861-907). However, Galt's
trail was cold; there was no evidence as to where he fled
fran Atlanta.

The Bureau became worried because with each passing
hour Galt's chances of avoiding capture became better and
better. Therefore, the investigative emphasis shifted from
following Galt's trail to identifying Galt. In an effort
to accomplish this the Bureau initiated a comparative search
of three identical latent fingerprints believed to be Galt's
(one fingerprint was recovered from the rifle; a second from
the binoculars; and a third from the map of Atlanta found
in Galt's room) against fingerprints of white male fugitives.
To be sure, the limitation to fugitives was purely speculative.

~58-

NW 65360 Docid:32989802 Page 242


However, the speculation paid off when on April 19, 1968,

James Earl Ray's fingerprint card compared identically
GQ 44-38861-1575). ;

With the discovery that Eric Starvo Galt was James
Earl Ray, the investigation was redirected to a search
of Ray's whereabouts since the time of his April 23, 1967,
escape fron Missouri State Prison. Through the months of
April and May the Ray-Galt steps were traced. Eventually,
the Bureau was able to account for Ray's whereabouts almost
continuously since his escape. Nevertheless, his trail
remained cold beyond Atlanta.on April 5, 1968 (HQ 44-38861-
3509; and see Chronology infra) 5

In connection with their search, Ray's fanily was
identified, located, physically surveilled and periodically
interviewed for information (E.G., HQ 44-38861-3987). Also,
prison inmates and associates were queried (e.g. HQ 44-38861-
3502) as well as his military record perused (HQ 44-38861-1616) .
But, no clues developed. Ray's family said they knew nothing;
they had not heard fran nor been in contact with James and did

" not know of his whereabouts (Chicago 44-1114-27). Prison

inmates and associates told talés of bounties offered for
‘the death of Dr. King but exhaustive investigations could not
substantiate their claims (e.g., HQ 44-38861-3767).

Frustrated, the Director prepared a memorandum for the

-59-

NW 65360 Docld:32989802 Page 243


oO oO
Attorney General dated May 13, 1968 in which he explains
that extensive investigation has not resulted in any new
developments beyond Atlanta, April 5. Therefore, the
Director requested authorization for telephone and micro-
phone surveillance on Ray family members. ‘The request,
however, was never acted upon (HQ 44~38861-3509).

(7) Passport Search. From an interview with a former
cellmate of Ray's at Missouri State Prison it was learned
that Ray appreciated the ease with which a person living
in Canada could obtain a false passport (HQ 44-38861-3889) .
Though it is not clear that the cellmate's comments pre-
cipitated a search of Canadian passports issued since Ray's
April 23, 1967. escape, it is known that on the request of
the FBI Legat in Canada such a search was conducted by the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police. A passport search was also
conducted in Mexico and the United States (HQ 44-38861-4445) .

Though the search went through a staggering number
of applications and was based on the comparison of Ray's

‘ photograph to those submitted with the application, it proved
to be the necessary break in picking up Ray's trail. At
9:30 p.m. June 1, 1968, The Legal attache, Ottawa,
Canada, called the Bureau to advise that after reviewing

some 175,000 applications the RCMP located a passport issued

-60-

NW 65360 Docid:32989802 Page 244



jocld:32989802 Page 245

April 24, 1968 under the name Ramon George Sneyd which .

contained a photograph very definitely similar to Ray
(HQ 44-38861-4190) .

The passport was filed by the Kermedy Travel
Agency in Toronto, Canada. Incident to their investi-
gation, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police contacted the
travel agency and obtained a hand printed note from Srieyd
concerning his application. The note together with the
passport photo and a latent palm print were ‘forwarded to
the Bureau for laboratory examination which concluded that
Ray and Sneyd were the same person (HQ 44-38861-4262, 4263).

(8) Ray Apprehended. The Kermédy Travel. Agency also
provided information that ‘Sneyd purchased a round trip air
ticket from Toronto to London departing May 6 and returning
May 21, 1968. But New Scotland Yard determined that Sneyd
tumed in the xeturn portion of the fare aid received a
May 7, 1968 ticket to Lisbon, Portugal plus a $14.60 voucher
(HQ 44-38861-4319) .

Inmigration authorities in Lisbon were immediately
contacted. It was learned that Ray had entered Lisbon
May 7 but had exited for London May 17, 1968 (HQ 44-38861-
4725).

Stops were issued by New Scotland Yard for Sneyd. At
11:15 a.m., Jue 8, 1968, Ray wes apprehended by officers of

New Scotland Yard while he was passing through British
immigration offices in the London Airport. At the time
he was planning a flight to Brussels, Belgium (HQ 44-38861-
4616).

2, Alleged Conspiracies

Literally scores of alleged conspiracies were
commmicated to the Bureau. From the date of the assas-
sination in April, 1968, even up to this.date, the FBI
has been approached by numerous persons with stories
which purport to identify a conspixacy to kill King.
These stories involved the widest range of perpetrators
and participants as well as motives. To the extent
that these leads were pursued, the Bureau was put in
the rather difficult position of conducting an investi-
gation which ranged far beyond the concrete evidence
that had already been obtained. When the leads were
in fact bogus ones, the FBI was attempting to prove a
negative in each reported case. With a controversial
figure, such as Dr. King, the possibilities of conspiracy
were-numerous. .Consequently, the Bureau's credibility
would necessarily be strained, given its past relation-
ship with the civil rights leader, unless each story was
disproved. Yet the Bureau attempted to cover each lead.

-62-

NW 65360 Docid:32989802 Page 246 . |


As previously stated, each SAC was held pérsonally
responsible for an expedited and thorough review.

Based on our review of the files, the task force
is satisfied that the FBI did a credible and thorough
job in attempting to identify any possible conspiracy
or persons who could have been involved in the murder.
In each of the allegations received, the Bureau immediately
interviewed the person who was the source of the allegation
where this was possible (i.e. where the source was not
anonymous). In situations where the complaint was not an
obvious hoax the Bureau then attempted immediately to
identify the alleged participants and interview then.
Where there was not a satisfactory explanation to dispel
the allegation concerning such matters as whereabouts or
associations, the Bureau then would check further. This
does not mean that every allegation was pursued to the
ultimate degree. Judgment based on experience dictated
many of the decisions. f

These judgments were also tempered by a critical
factor. Within fifteen days after the murder, the FBI
was convinced that Galt and Ray were the same person,

that this individual purchased the rifle, rented the

room across from the Lorraine Motel, and fired’ the shot

that killed Dr. King. While there were many other people

-63-

. NW 65360 Docid:32989802 Page 247


O oO

who were antagonistic toward Dr. King and many who

had apparently discussed killing him, any successful
conspiracy would have to have involved Ray based on the
evidence at hand. In all the years following the assas-
sination, the investigation has failed to reveal any
comection between any alleged conspirator(s) and James
Earl Ray including those alleged by Ray himself. Indeed,
the overwhelming evidence indicates that Ray was almost
totally alone during the year after his escape fran the
Missouri State Prison.

We have not addressed here the Bureau's handling of
particular conspiracy leads because of the large munber of
allegations involved. Bureau filés can be checked for each
reported lead and the resulting investigation on that lead

traced to its conclusion.

C. The Story of James Earl Ray

1. Chronology of Ray's Activities On and
After April 23, 1967 =

On Sunday, the 23rd of April 1967, after he had

; April 23, 1967

served seven years of a twenty year sentence for armed

robbery in the Missouri State Penitentiary at Jefferson

City, James Earl Ray escaped. When a truck appeared at

the prison bakery where Ray worked, a bread box was

carried onto the truck to be delivered to a nearby prison

farm. Ray had concealed himself inside the bread box,

end later fled from the prison truck at a stop prior to its ©

reaching the Renz prison fann. (3503; Huie, pp.24-27.) */
Ray allegedly headed first toward Kansas City

(luie, p.27). On’ the third day he burglarized a

trailer sitting by the Missouri River. taking a blanket

April 24-28

and food (Huie, p.27). For the next three nights he made
his way along the railroad in the direction of Kansas City

*/ Ray has provided varying accounts of his escape from
prison and of his subsequent activities prior to apprehension.
The task force's mst credible view of his statements has

been used here. These admissions of Ray are found in He Slew
the Dreamer, Huie, William Bradford, Delacorte Press, New York,
TS (hereinafter, Huie); All other citations herein’ are for
serials in the Bureau's MURKIN file, HQ 44-38861. The task
force has obtained xerox copies of Ray's correspondence with
Mr. Huie which reflect the admissions cited by Huie.

to a city large enough so he would not be noticed and
took a train to St. Louis. He then took a taxicab to
East St. Louis, called a friend who drove him to Edwards-
ville whence he caught a bus for Chicago (Huie, p.28).
On May 3rd, Ray secured work for the next eight

May 3
weeks as a dishwasher and cook's helper at the Indian
Trail Restaurant in Winnetka, Illinois, and resided at
2731 North Sheffield in Chicago under the name John L. :
: June
Rayns. He purchased a 1959 Chrysler automobile fron
a private ower on June 5th for $200 (5448). Om 9
June
June 9th, he failed a driver's test, but passed the
June 12
test on June 12th (5394). Ray moved from his
Sheffield address to 1648 Lamt Street on June 17th
” June 17
where he paid one week's rent (5118). Ray was issued
a driver's permit in the name of John L. Rayns for the
June 21
State of Illinois on Jume 21st (5394). During the week
of June 19th Ray left his job, and requested that his
final paycheck be forwarded to the Lunt Street address,
which it was (5118).
Thereafter, on July 14, Ray purchased a 1962
July 14

Plymouth automobile from a commercial dealer in East

St. Louis, Illinois, and transferred the licensed
plates from the Chrysler to the Plymouth (5413; Huie,
p.39). Leaving East St. Louis on July 15, Ray proceeded

-66- f

NW 65360 Docld:32989802 Page 250


NW 65360 Docid:32989802 Page 251

to Montreal, Canada, via Indianapolis, Detroit and July 15

Windsor (Huie, p.40). His prime objective was
allegedly to secure a Canadian passport (iden p.41).
As John L: Rayns, he registered for an overnight
stay at the Bourgard Motel in Dorion, just west of
Montreal (idem, p.43; 5437x).
Next, Ray first used the alias Eric S$. Galt July 19
when he signed a six month lease for an apartment
in the Harkay Apartments, 2589 Notre Dame East, in
Montreal (2192; Huie, p.43). Ray then allegedly
held up a food store stealing $1700 (Huie, p.47).
The following day he spent $300 for new clothes at the
Tip Top Tailors, 488 St. Catherine West, had his hair
cut and a manicure at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel (Huie,
p.48). He also ordered on July 21st a $75 tailor-made
suit at the English and Scotch Woolen Company (4692).
(A month and a half later, by a letter fron Birmingham
dated September 6, 1967, this tailoring company was
instructed by Ray to send the finished garment to him
at his then Birmingham address.) Three days later Ray July 24
ordered three sex books from Futura Books, Inc., in
Inglewood, California, (2192), and on July 28th, he July 28

enrolled in a correspondence course at the Locksmithing
Institute, Little Falls, New Jersey (2068). Both matters

were paid by Canadian money orders.

Ray vacationed, beginning July 30th, at the July 30-
Gray Rocks Inn on Lake Ouvixmet in the Laurentian August 5
Mountains ‘seeking, according to Ray, contact with
a respectable woman to: vouch for him on a passport
application. He was "picked up" by a. female Canadian ~
Government employee and her girlfriend and spent the +
“next few days with them before Leaving on August 7th;
The two women followed, stayed overnight with Ray in August 7
Montreal on August 7th, and then returned to their
residences in Ottawa (Huie, pp.51-53; 5402). On
August 9th, he purchased by money order a formila for August 9
making glass for a two-way mirror (2192). ‘Then, on August 19
August 19th, Ray visited the government employee in
Ottawa, but did not importume her to assist him on his’
passport application (Huie, p.54).
During the approximately two and-oné-half "Raoul"
months of Ray's stay in Canada.he relates meeting an Sates July 18-
Aug. 8 & through
underworld character named "Raoul. After negotiations, -Aug. 18 -

brother at Northbrooke, Illinois, gave his Plymouth

car to his brother Jerry Ryan, (5413), proceeded

from Northbrooke or Chicago to Bimmingham, stayed
: August 26th at the Granada Hotel, 2230 Fourth j August 26
Averme as John L. Rayns (5400; Huie; p.61), and that

same day also took a room in the name Eric S. Galt

at the Economy Rooms, 2608 Highland Averme . (2324). August 28
Two days later Ray, as Galt, giving the Highland

Avenue address, rented safety deposit box No. 5517

at the Main Office, Birmingham Trust National Bank

(2323; Huie, p.62). The access record on this - ‘

box shows entries at 2:32p.m. on August 28; from

1:52p.m. to 1:56p.m. on September 5; from 11:05

to 11:08a.m. on September 21; and fram 10:l6a.m.

to 10:19a.m. on September 28 (2323).

The purchase of a white 1966 Ford Mustang was August 29-30

accomplished at the end. of August by answering a

newspaper ad on the 29th of August and paying $1995 in

cash to William D. Paisley on the 30th (628). All

this checks with the car purchase chronology Ray

himself admitted to author William Bradford Huie

(Huie, pp.61-63; Ray's self-serving attribution of

"Raoul" as the one who directed him to buy the car

and who supplied the cash is uncorroborated).

Ray as Eric Starvo Galt, applied for and was September 6
issued Alabama driver's license No.2848947 (4143).
The signature matches the other handwritings of the
same name (4143). At. some point during his stay in
Bimningham, Ray purchased a .38 revolver which was
found on his person on his arrest in Heathrow Airport,
London, England (1422).
On Septenber 12th, Ray enrolled for 5 weekly September 12
dance classes at the Continental Dance Club Studios
(2324). The Moder Photographic Book Publishing
Co. Inc., of New York City received a coupon order September 26
from Eric S. Galt for a photo book (633) and a letter
by Ray as Galt written September 26, asking that the
book not be sent as he was moving and would give the
changed address later (4143). The handwriting was
identical with Ray's (4143).
Ray purchased a bank draft from the Exchange September 28
Security Bank, 5 points’ South Branch, Birmingham
payable to the Superior Bulk Film Co. of Chicago and
this accompanied an order on that company for a Kodak
Super 8 movie camera, a projector, a splicer and a 20
foot remote control cable; price $337.24 (1135). Then
Ray typed a note to the film company seven days

later in which he acknowledged receipt of the ‘items

he had ordered but returned the movie camera as the
wrong one; he stated he was leaving for Mexico on
October 7, and would send a new address to which

" the correct movie camera could be forwarded (4143).
On September 30th, Ray paid only for his room (2118).-

Ray, as Galt, was issued Alabama license tags October 6

No.1-38993 for 1968. He left Birmingham for Mexico
on October 6 (ute, p.66). On the 8th of October, October 8
Ray purchased a 30 day Mexican auto insurance policy October 10
(1904). He xeached Acapulco on October 10th, proceeded October 15
‘to Guadalajara on October 15th and left there on :
the 18th for Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco, Mexico, October 18
-arriving in Puerto Vallarta on the 19th (5496). He
registered in Room 212 of the Hotel Rio at Morelos 86

October 19

on this date; his "Galt" signature and writings match October 22
his other Galt writings (4143). Galt typed a letter :

to the. film company to ask for a refund to the Puerto

Vallarta address in lieu of the Kodak movie camera

which had been mailed meanwhile to his vacated

Birmingham address (4143). Again the written signature

on this note matched the. string of "Galt" signatures.

beach.) (Huie, p.81), Ray switched hotels, going
from the Rio to the Hotel Tropicana (1219). He
spent most of-his time in the period from October
19 to November 13, 1967, with a girlfriend, Irma
Morales, whose true name is Manuela Aguirre Medrano
(1219), and possibly another female named Nina
(Huie, p.8). :

Ray left Puerto Vallarta and drove to Los
Angeles where he rented an apartment at 1535 North
Serrano Avenue on the 19th of November. (668; Huie,
p.85). He then wrote a typed letter to the Superior
Bulk Film Company, Chicago, to forward to his new
address the refund due him for the undelivered Kodak

" movie camera; the signature on this letter matches
the other "Galt" signatures. (4143).

In this second week of his stay in Los Angeles,
Ray began a series of six visits to a clinical
psychologist, Dr. Mark 0. Freeman, in hopes of
overcoming his shyness, gaining social confidence,
learning self-hypnosis to gain relaxation, sleep and
remember things better.

Apparently, in a further self-improvement step,
Ray enrolled in a course of dancing instructions with December 5
the ower of the National Dance Studio, 2026 Pacific
Avenue, Long Beach, California (4143). On December
13th, Ray wrote his Birmingham bank to close his December 13
safety deposit box (2323). He paid $100 on the December 14
dancing lesson contract on the 14th of December, left
laundry at the Avalon Cleaners & Laundry, Inc.,
5662, Hollywood Blvd., Los Angeles, on the following December 15
day-ticket No.31053 and laundry mark "'20R-3" made
by a Thermo Seal marking machine (4143); and also
on December 15th Ray, as Galt still, began a round
trip drive with Charles J. Stein, 5666 Franklin
Avenue, Los Angeles, to New Orleans in Ray's white
Mustang to pick up Stein's sister's two small children
(4143). Stein and Ray arrived in New Orleans on the December 17
17th, the latter registering at the Provincial Hotel,
1024 Chartes Street, Room 126 (5399). The "Galt"
registration card signature matched the string of
such signatures in Ray's odyssey and he further
recorded that he was driving a Mustang with Alabama
license No.1-38993 and gave his address as 2608
Highland Avenue, Birmingham (4143).

Ray checked out before the 1:00p.m. checkout December 19
time on the 19th and, with the two children and
Charles Stein, made the return trip to Los Angeles
arriving by the 21st of December when he took the December: 21
first of the series of dancing lessons he had December 22
signed up for. The next day he picked up his
laundry. Four'more dancing lessons are recorded December 25,

26 27828
next (4143).

On December 28, 1967, Ray first indicated
his interest in immigrating ‘to Africa, and more
particularly to a white ruled area, by writing a
letter of inquiry to Mr. Jotm Acord, Chairman,
American-Southern African Council, 800 Fourth St.,
S.W., Washington, D.C.; the signature of Galt
matched up with the other Galt writings. (4143).

1968
Ray said he visited Las Vegas on New Year's January 1,283
Day. (Huie, p.96). Dance: lessons are documented
on the 2nd and 3rd days of 1968 (2325). Galt January 8

bought Bank of America money order No.0799 18037

in the amount of $15 from the Hollywood Western

Branch payable to the Locksmithing Institute (2325).

The FBI lab made the usual writing match up on the

signature (4143). Meanwhile Ray showed up regularly January 9,11,15,

16818
for dance lessons (2325). On. January 19th Ray signed

up for a bartending course at the International School

of Bartending 2125 Sunset Boulevard (2325); his
application signature fits his other Galt signatures
(4143). He left his laumdry at the Home Service
Laundry and Dry Cleaning Co. at 5280 Hollywood Boulevard
(2325, cites laundry list No. 3065 in E. Galt's name
with Thermo Seal sticker 02B-6, the marking on the
T-shirt and shorts in the bag abandoned at the front

On January 21, 1968, Ray changed his lodgings
to Room 403 of the St. Francis Hotel, 5533 Hollywood

29th, 30th, 31st, February 1, 5, 6, 8 and 12, Ray
regularly attended dance lessons (2325). He attended
bartending school through to March 2, 1968. He bought January 29
two Bank of America mney orders on the 29th of January,
one to place an ad in the Free Press soliciting a
female pen pal and the second to pay for a mil
forwarding service (1500). Each transaction created

Ray attempted to increase his social life by February 17 *
writing and sending his photograph to a wonan listed
by "The Local Swinger" which listing was secured for
$1.00; Ray in fact wrote 5 such letters (4143). The
Galt signature was added to the FBI's matchups and February 26
Ray's photograph secured. For reading material,
Ray ordered books from Futura Books paying by money
order No.0799 19430 on the 26th. (1500). ‘The
signature matchup was made (4143). On this same day
Ray made a money order payment No.0799 19701 to the
Locksmithing Institute (2325). He sent another,
No.0799 19704, for the "Locksmith's Ledger" with
matching signature (2325); he sent two money orders,
Nos.0799 19702 and 0799 19703, and a letter order to
Tiffany Enterprises, 8512 Whitworth Drive in Los Angeles,
a mail order house, for one pair of Japanese handcuffs
(1500), with signatures matchable on two of the three
documents (4143).

At intervals in his stay in Los Angeles, Ray
had plastic surgery done to change his appearance
(author Huie puts this treatment as on March 3, 7 and”
11, 1968, Huie, pp.107-8); he visited a psychologist-
hypnotist, Reverend Von Koss on January 4, 1968
(Huie, p.102), and allegedly sane seven other :
psychiatrists, hypnotists or scientologists.
According to author Huie, he frequented a bar known
as the Rabbit's Foot Club and on one night became
involved in a racial argument followed by a mugging in
which he had his wallet stolen and lost his suit jacket,
car keys and driver's license (Huie, p.96-98). According
to author Huie citing Ray as his source, Ray telephoned
Alabama and had a duplicate license issued; this was
forwarded fran his former Birmingham address to California
and received there about March 10, 1968 (iuie, p.98).
"Galt" was graduated from the bartending school March 2
on the 2nd of March. His picture was taken’ with the

Ray listed a change of address on March 17
with the St. Francis Hotel, giving his forwarding
address as General Delivery, Main Post Office
Atlanta, Georgia (4143). Presumably“he left
Los Angeles in his white Mustang on this date,
proceeding to New Orleans where he left a box
of clothing for Marie Martin's little daughter,
Marian de Grassee, at Charles Stein's cousin
Theresa Stone's residence, 4019 Royal Street (4143;
Huie, p. 108). :
"Fran New Orleans, Ray drove to Selma, Alabama March 22
(5502), (where Ray began to stalk Dr. King according
to Huie's statement of Ray's admission on this) and, March 23
after an overnight stay there, he went on to. Montgomery, March 24
to Bixmingham and finally to Atlanta, Georgia (Huie, p.

In Atlanta, Ray rented room No.2 in a rooming March 24
house at 113-14th Street, N.E. from ‘the operator,
Jimmy Delton Garner (1033). He stayed there util March 28
March 28 on which day, while still in Atlanta, he
purchased U.S. Postal money order No.5,615, 057,923 pay-
able to the Locksmithing Institute (1428). The Galt
signature was a matchup (4143).

On the 29th Ray appeared at the Aeromarine Supply
Company, 5701 Aixport Highway: in Birmingham, Alabama,
and using the alias Harvey Lownyer purchased a Remington
.243 caliber rifle, Yodel 700 with a 2x-7x Redfield
telescopic sight mounted on it (432). Almost certainly
because the breech of the .243 caliber weapon was-caked
with a hardened preservative (cosmoline) and could not
be loaded, Ray returned it the following day (mot having
fired it). He explained that his "brother'' didn't like
it, and exchanged the .243 rifle for a Model 760, 30-06
caliber Remington. The scope was transferred to the
latter rifle. Throughout these transactions the package
for either rifle was a Browning shotgun carton which was
large enough to hold the scope-equipped Remingtons (432).

The Atlanta rooming house operator, Jimmy Delton
Garner stated he had Ray print his name (Eric S. Galt) on
an old envelope at Garner's request so that Garner could
transfer the name properly to his official records; the,
handprinting is a matchup with other Galt-Ray printing
samples (1033).

Using the name Eric Calc, Ray Left his laumdry april 1
and dry cleaning at the Piedmont Laundry pickup
station, 1168 Peachtree, N.W. in Atlanta (4143). ‘Two April 3
days later, as Eric S, Galt, Ray on April 3 registered
into Room 34 at the Rebel Motor Hotel, 3466 Lamar
Avenue, Memphis, Tennessee (the distance between Atlanta
and Memphis by the most convenient route is 398 miles);
he gave 2608 Highland Avenue, Birmingham as his address
.and he noted on the registration card that he was driving
a Mustang with Alabama license No. 1-38993 (4143). His
signature was a match to the other identified Galt sigha-
tures (4143). On this same day, Ray purchased’a safety April 3 .
razor and shaving supplies at the Rexall Drug Store in
the Whitehaven suburb of Memphis (Memphis 44-1987 Sub A-

Sec. 1; Hule, p.129). ; ;

Ray left the Rébel Motel before the lpm. April 4.
checkout time on April 4th (4143). At some point 3-3:30p.m.
between 3p.m. and 3:30p.m. onthe 4th, a man :
generally answering Ray's description rented Room 5-B
at 422 1/2 South Main Street, Memphis, in the name of
John Willard (idem. 33). Ray admits to having been in
the room with "Raoul" whom he first said rented the
room using the "Willard" alias he, Ray, supplied (uie,

p.115). In another letter to Huie, Ray states he himself 4:00p.m.

rented the room using the alias John Willard (Huie, p.
30). Ray went out to the York Ams Company Store then
located at 162 South Main Street and purchased a pair
of Bushnell binoculars for a total of $41.55 (4143);
Ray was identified by the salesman at York Arms and
Ray admits to having been to the sports store and to
having made the purchase of the binoculars (Huie, p.
115). By 5p.m. at the latest, Ray had returned to
the rooming house, parked his Mistang and had taken
his zipper bag and bedspread to Room 5-B (Huie, p.115);
" by necessary inference, because it was admittedly
brought down from there. and dropped on the sidewalk,
the 30-06 rifle had been taken up to Room 5-B at this
time or just before Ray's trip to the York Amns Co.
Store (See Huie, p.114 and p.131; 4143).

As detailed in the discussion of the course of
the FBI investigation ante at pp. 48-50, the assassin fled
fron the common bathroom at the rear of the rooning
house after firing the shot that killed Dr. King. The
assassin could have cleared and undoubtedly did clear 6:03 :50p.m.
the corridor and the stairs to the street in about 45
seconds. In another 15 seconds at the outside he could
have reached and undoubtedly did reach Ray's white

and bearing only his fingerprints and the bedspread which
Ray admits taking up to Room 5-B (Staff reenactment;
Huie, p.115). According to a post-conviction statement. by
Ray to then Special Agent in Charge of the Menphis Field
Office, Robert. Jensen, roomer Charles Stephens had a
good look at Ray in the rooming house (5622; Interview of
Robert Jensen, July 7, 1976, App. B).
On the street Guy Warren Canipe, Jr., in his place
; of business, Canipe Amsement Co., at 424 South Main Street
heard @ thud near the front door of his store, looked w
to see a white male walk rapidly past his store going
south (right to left to someone inside the store) and,,

a letter about South Africa from the John Birch Society
in California and a copy of the Free Press fromlos |

Angeles to divert the FBI's attention to Califomia
while he fled to Canada (Huie, p.133). Ray picked up .

his laundry at the Piedmont Laundry pick-up station at

1168 Peachtree N.E. in Atlanta on the Sth of April (4697).

He then took a bus departing Atlanta just after noon on
the 5th and arrived in Cincirmati at about 1:30a.m. on
the 6th of April. After a one hour layover which he
stated he spent in a tavern near the bus depot, Ray
continued by bus to Detroit where he arrived at about
8a.m. (Huie, p.135). He crossed by taxi into Canada
arriving in Windsor an hour or so before noon and
proceeded from there to Toronto by train arriving at
about 5:00p.m. (Huie, p.135). He rented a room at

102 Ossington Avenue without giving his name (5502;
Huie, p.135).

On the 8th of April Ray began the process of
securing a Canadian passport. -He picked two names,
Paul Edward Bridgman and Ramon George Sneyd, from the
_anmouncements of births in newspapers for the year

1932 at the public library (Huie, p.137). He made an

a passport picture taken in the name of Bridgman and
then to provide a separate mailing address for the
expected replies as to Sneyd, he rented a room at
962 Dundas Street in the name of Sneyd on April 16th
(5502; Huie, p.141). On the same day he executed an
application in the.name Paul Bridgman with his, Ray's
102 Ossington Avenue address as: the person to be
notified in case of emergency (Huie, p.143). ‘The
Kennedy Travel Agency of Toronto handled the processing:
of the application for Ray (5502). ‘On the 19th Ray
moved to the Dmdas Street address (5502).

The fingerprints-of "Eric S. Galt" were found to
be a match with those of James Earl Ray after a search
of the print file on Fugitive Felons.

According to author Huie he gleaned from Ray that.

Ray visited four bars on the 21st in order to watch the

“TV show "The FBI" (luie, p.147). He found the show tuned

in at the fourth place he tried and learried that he had

made the Ten Most Wanted List with an international '"'look-

On April 24 the Canadian passport in the name of April 24,
Ramon George Sneya was issued to Ray (Huie, p.148). Ray _ i
purchased a round trip ticket to London and departed Tee"
on May 6, 1968 (Huie, p.149). Fron London Ray took a
plane to Lisbon where he spent-10 days looking for a -
passage to Angola (Huie, p.150). When he was unable
to do so he retumed to London after first getting his
Passport replaced at the Canadian Embassy in Lisbon to May 16,
correct the spelling of the name Sneyd (instead of Sneya) wae
(5502; Huie, p.150).

Ray returned to London and spent his time trying May 17,
to find a way to join a mercenary force (Huie, p.150). an
To this end he bought a plane ticket to Brussels and was
in the process of meeting his plane at the Heathrow Airport June 8,
when he was apprehended on June 8, 1968, by detectives fron te
New Scotland Yard (4346,4368; Huie, p.150-151). The arrest
was made on the basis of use of a fradulent passport and
carrying a concealed weapon, i.e., the loaded .38 caliber
Japanese-inake revolver found on his person at Heathrow
(4346, 4368; Huie, p.151).

This chronology has been compiled from data in FBI
reports and Ray's letters to author William Bradford Huie.

It was hoped by the task force that we would have an

opvorsmizy co Zo over the facts with James Earl Ray
himself. Accordingly, after the United States Supreme
Court denied his petition for a writ of certiorari, on
December 13, 1976, a verbal request was made to Ray's
Attorney, James H. Lesar, for an opportumity to interview
Ray. Lesar stated that he was writing Ray a letter that
day and would advise him of our desire to interview him
and leave the matter up to him (Interview of James H.
Lesar, December 14, 1976, App. B). Also, the task force
sent Ray a letter on December 15, 1976, via his attorney
requesting an interview (See letter to James Earl Ray,
December 15, 1976, App. A, Ex.14). While no answer to
our letter was received, Ray sent the task force a copy of
a letter addressed to his attorney. Ray attached a copy
of a complaint he recently filed in a civil action and
stated in the letter to his attorney that: "I agree with
your advice opposing the interview. It would appear that
this would only be in the interest of the J.D. and their
book writing collaborators, e.g., Gerold Frank, George
McMillian, et al." (See letter to James H. Lesar, December 20,
1976, App. A, Ex.15).

Absent a statement to us fran Ray, four existing Ray

explanations were compared and are here briefly noted.

-86-

NW 65360 Docid:32989802 Page 270



First, ro one, other than his attorneys talked with
Ray before the plea bargaining resulted in his conviction
of the First Degree murder of Martin Luther King, Jr., and
sentencing in open court on March 10, 1969, before Judge
VW. Preston Battle, .Criminal Court of Shelby County,

: Tennessee (See Transcript App. A, Ex.16). At that. time,

on voir dire, Judge Battle asked Ray: "Are you pleading
guilty to Murder in the First Degree in this case because
you killed Dr. Martin Luther King under such circumstances
that would maké you legally guilty of Murder in the First
Degree under the law as explainéd to you by your lawyers?"

Ray answered: "Yes."

Ray then acknowledged that he was pleading guilty
freely, voluntarily and understandingly. He and his
attorney, Percy Foreman, initialed the copy of these
questions and answers. Ray also signed a detailed
stipulation confessing ‘that he fired the fatal shot (5506).

The task force observes that the only way one can
be "legally guilty" of first degree murder is when one
accomplishes, or aids or assists in the accomplishment, of
the wrongful killing of a human being with premeditation
and malice aforethought. Thus, Ray has judicially confessed
that he intended to and did kill Dr. King.

NW 65360 Docld:32989802 Page 271



oO oO

Second, Ray related in writing to author Hute a
story of his odyssey from Missouri State Prison to Memphis
which acknowledged that he bought the murder weapon, made
his way to Memphis, rented the room there at 422 South
Main on April 4, 1968, using the alias "John Willard,"
waited in the white Mustang, and drove "Raoul" away fron
the crime scene after the murder wholly unaware of the
killing of Dr. King. In this version "Raoul", or "'Roual"',
is the mysterious killer whom Ray thought to be an
international gun-rumner; Ray bought the murder weapon for
"Raoul" thinking it was to be displayed to prospective
Mexican buyers in Room 5-B of the "flop house" on South
Main Street (uie, p.130-131).

Third, in a statement read on a progran of Station
KMOX-TV St. Louis, Missouri, in August of 1969 by his
brother Jerry, James Earl Ray was quoted as alleging that
he was the innocent victim, "the fall guy" of a schane by
the FBI (Memphis 44-1987 Sub M-665). ‘This description of
the crime contains no reference to Raoul.

Fourth, the most recent story available to the
task force is reported as the result of a four hour interview
by Wayne Chastain, Jr., for the Pacific News Service,
October 20, 1974. It is to the effect that Ray was "set up

NW 65360 Docid:32989802 Page 272



NW 65360 Docld:32989802 Page 273

@ @
as a patsy'' for "Raoul." It proceeds along the same lines
as the tale told by Ray to author Huie that there was to
be a meeting at the rooming house at 6p.m. with an
international gum rumer. Ray was instructed by Raoul to
have the white Mustang at the curb for "Raoul's" use that
evening. Ray, however, drove away from the area at about
6:00p.m. to get air in a low tire and found police swaming
all over the place when he tried to return at 7:05p.m. He
could not park, was turned back by police and learned only
after driving 100 miles into Mississippi that he had been
associated with the men who killed Dr: King (he Assassinations,
Dallas and Beyond, Edited by Peter Dale Scott, Paul L. Hock
and Russell Stetler, Random House, 1976, pp.315-317).

The task force views the exculpatory content of these
varying and patently self-serving tales to be unbelievable.
The varying details are materially self-refuting. Ray first
admits full guilt. He then says he waited innocently at the
curb and took off after the shot with "Raoul" as a passenger.
He next says he was the catspaw of the FBI. And finally,
he and the Mistang were_nét in the area when the shot was
fired and he never saw "Raoul" after the event.

The eye witnesses to the "get away", saw only one
man vio resenbled Ray. ‘he man left in a hurry in a white
Mustang as Ray admitted doing in version mmber two. We
concluded Ray was lying about the existence of a "Raoul",

Ray's stipulated judicial confession comports in
detail with the facts disclosed by the investigation and
the failute of the self-serving ‘stories persuasively
undemines the likelihood of any conspiracy.

2. Motive

James Earl Ray, born 1928, was raised under
difficult circumstances. His parents were poor, unedu-
cated and generally resided in areas surromded by
criminal activity. Ray did not achieve a high school
education, nor did he attend any vocational institution*

" After enlisting in the amy in 1946, Ray did not meet the
military's standards and was discharged in 1948 for lack .
of adaptability. “(HQ 44-38861-3333, 3987).

Thus, at the age of twenty-one, he had a very limited
education, was not trained or skilled at any particular job,
and was a reject of the military establishment. ‘Thereafter,
he proceeded to participate in and be apprehended for a
number of criminal actions for which he would be incarcerated
for fourteen of the next eighteen years until his escape from
the Missouri State Penitentiary in April 1967. Ray's criminal
activities included robbery, forgery and burglary (HQ 44-38861-
4143). He was not known to have been involved in crimes where
victims or witnesses were physically harmed.

*EBI files disclosed that James Earl Ray has an IQ of 105

NW 65360 Docld:32989802 Page 275



O 0 -

In March 1968, James Earl Ray was forty years
old and was never known to have had a serious relation-
ship with a man or woman during his adult life. Although
he was about to commit a very infamous crime of assassina-
tion, neither his childhood, his military years nor his
adult life of crime and imprisonment signaled such action.
His criminal activities were not those.of a hired or self-
accomplished premeditated murderer. Why then would James
Earl Ray murder Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.?

An analysis of Ray's: prison records and interviews
with his prison inmates reveals some probative facts with
respect to a motive. For example, in 1955 Ray was incar-
cerated in the federal penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas,
‘for forgery of post office money orders. On September 12,
1957, Ray was approved for the honor farm at Leavenworth,
but was never transferred there because he refused to live
in the integrated dormitory at the farm (HQ 44~38861~1678) «
Thus, he was supposedly willing to sacrifice this benefit
and its accampanying privileges to avoid association with
black prisoners.

An inmate with Ray at Missouri State Penitentiary
for approximately three years, stated that Ray hated
Negroes. He further stated that Ray had said that

all the Negro prisoners inside the penitentiary should

NW 65360 Docld:32989802 Page 276 -92- }


be killed. He also responded that on several occasions

" Ray had said he would kill Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.,
if the price were right. In 1966, there was a riot at
the penitentiary. Three blacks were killed. The inmate
would not state whether Ray had participated in the
killings. He did say that, if Ray had not, he would
definitely know who had killed the prisoners. He also
said that he would not be surprised if he acted without,
being paid for the killing. It should be noted that another

: prisoner who was a chef at MSP and Ray's boss for six years,
stated that this inmate was a good friend of Ray and he also
hated Negroes. (HO 44-38861-4443).

A second inmate with Ray at the Missouri State

Penitentiary from 1960 until 1965, claimed that he
recalls that Ray was glad when President Kennedy was killed
and stated "that is one nigger~loving S.0.B that got shot".
The prisoner also advised that Ray disliked Negroes. During
the time period when King was leading demonstrations and
marches Ray would became aggravated ”and upset when reading
this information in a eeeees to the point that he would

_ curse King and the Negroes. He further stated he had heard
prison rumors that Ray was supposed to have killed three
black prisoners at the penitentiary. Finally, he related

-93~

| NW 65360 Docid:32989802 Page 277



fe) fe)
that in 1963 Ray mace the remark that he was going to
get Martin Luther King when he got out of prison.
(BQ 44~38861-2678, 2791).

A third inmate at MSP from 1962 until 1965,
described Ray as a "lone wolf" who never trusted
anyone. He stated that Ray was a racist and was heard
many times discussing his dislike of Negroes. Another
prisoner became acquainted with Ray in 1965 and said that’
Ray commented if he ever got out of jail he was going to
make himself a "bunch of money," and Ray further said a
"Businessmen's Association" had offered $100,000 for
killing Martin Luther King. This prisoner said that
Ray did not know what the "Businessmen's Association"
was, but he intended to find out. (HQ 44-38861-4143).°

A cellmate with Ray in 1955 at Kansas City who
later served prison time with Ray at Leavenworth, Kansas,
was also incarcerated with Ray at MSP, He stated that
during the period when President Kennedy was- assassinated
the movements of Dr. Martin Luther King became the topic
o£ conversation at the penitentiary. Many prisoners heard
that businessmen had raised a considerable amount of money,
about one million dollars, as a bounty on King's head. He
further stated that Ray mentioned a dozen times that had he
known about the bounty on John F. Kennedy's head and
had-he been free he would have collected it; and, if he

~94-

INW 65360 Docld:32989802 Page 278


got cut in time and King were still alive, he would get

the bounty on King (HQ 44~-38861-4143). A prisoner

who was at MSP from 1958 through 1965 stated Ray did
not like Negroes and was capable of killing Dr. Martin .
Luther King, Jr. (HQ 44-38861~4143). HH :

Ray's psychological background is also a very
important avenue of review. As a result of a voluntary
psychiatric examinatidn in 1966, Ray was described as
having a sociopathic personality, antisocial type with
anxiety and depressive features (HQ 44-38861-3505). In
1954, a prison sociologist stated that Ray's delinquencies
seem due to impulsive behavior, especially when drinking
(—BQ 44+38861-3335). These characteristics and caments
about Ray ‘support the opinion of psychologist Dr. Mark
Freeman. While Ray was in Los Angeles he was a patient
of Dr. Freeman. Dr. Freeman believes that Ray was potentially
capable of assassination, was a self-motivated person who
could act alone, and likely fantasized on being someone
important.

There were two matters involving Ray and blacks
while outside prison which shed some light on whether his
hatred of blacks and need for importance and profit could
have motivated him to murder. While in Mexico in the fall

-95-

NW 65360 Docld:32989802 Page 279



O oO

of 1967, Pay asscciatad with 7 Mexican woman, Ima

Morales, in the City of Puerto Vallarta. Morales admitted
spending considerable time with him and recalls an incident
that took place on Sunday, October 29th. She and Ray were

_ Seated at a table in a bar and were drinking when four

blacks and several white persons arrived and were Seated
at another table. She stated that Ray kept goading the
blacks for some reason. Thereafter, Ray left his table
to go to his car, and when he retumed he asked her to
feel his pocket. Morales did and felt a pistol in his
pocket. Ray stated to Morales that he wanted to kill the
blacks. He then continued to be insulting and when the
blacks left he stated he wanted to go after them. Morales,
however, a him it was time for the police to arrive to
check the establishment and Ray stated he wanted nothing to
do with the police, thereby terminating ‘the incident (HQ‘44-
38861-2073) .

A second incident took place during Ray's stay in
Los Angeles. James E. Morrison, a bartender at the Rabbit's
Foot Club there, identified Ray as a frequent customer.
Morrison said that on one occasion Ray became engaged in a
political discussion with him regarding Robert Kennedy and
George Wallace. Ray became rather incensed and vehemently
supported Wallace. On another occasion, Ray had had a

~96-

NW 65360 Docld:32989802 Page 280



discussion with Pat Goodsell, a frequent female customer,

concerning blacks and the civil rights movement. Ray became
very involved and began dragging Goodsell towards the door
saying, "I'll drop you off in Watts and we'll see how you
like it there’ -(HQ 44-38861-3557). Ray then supposedly went
outside and had to fight two persons, one being black (Huie,
Pp. 96-98). :

Thus, it seams clear that Ray openly displayed a
strong racist attitude towards blacks. ‘ While in prison,
Ray stated he would kill Dr. King if given the opportunity
and Ray was prepared to threaten or attack black persons
in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, with a weapon for apparently
a racial reason. These events and occurrences leading to
the assassination of Dr. King and the assassination itself
certainly do not illustrate a single, conclusive motive.
Yet, Ray's apparent hatred for the civil rights movement,
his possible yearning for recognition, and a desire for a
potential quick profit may have, as a whole, provided

sufficient impetus for him to act, and to act alone.

3. Sources Of Amds

.

Shortly after the search for Ray began, it was
recognized that he had traveled extensively following his
escape from the Missouri Penitentiary. Moreover, in addition

~97-

O O

to normal iiving aqenses, Ray had made Several sub-
stantial purchases, e.g., cars, photo equipment, dance
lessons (See, List of known expenditures, App. A, Ex. 4).
These expenditures suggested that he had financial assist-

' ance and hence possible co-conspirators. Therefore, the
Bureau was particularly interested in determining his
sources of income. On April 23, 1968, the Director advised
all field divisions to consider Ray as a suspect in any
unsolved bank robberies, burglaries or armed robberies
occurring after April 23, 1967. ‘The results were negative.

On April 29, 1968, the Director in a teletype to
all SAC's ordered that all law enforcement agencies which
maintained midentified latent fingerprints be contacted
and requested that fingerprints of Ray be compared in order
to determine his past whereabouts and possibly establish
his source of fimds. Again, negative results were obtained.
The Dizector, on May 14, 1968, reminded all field divisions
that Ray had spent“a considerable amount of money from April
23, 1967 until April 4, 1968, and advised that a source for
these monies had not been determined. The Director ordered
that photographs of Ray be displayed to appropriate witnesses
in unsolved bank robberies and bank burglaries. These efforts
and all others to date, with one exception, have proved
fruitless.

~98-

As a result of one of Huie's Look articles, the -

Bureau did ascertain that Ray had been employed at a
restaurant in Winnetka, Illinois, for approximately eight
weeks. As a dishwasher and cook's helper, Ray had received
checks totaling $664 from May 7, 1967 through June 25, 1967
(See, List of known income, App. A, Ex. 5). This is the
only known source of incom for Ray following his prison
escape. Reports from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police
indicated no known robberies or burglaries which could be
conmected with Ray, nor did Mexican authorities notify
the Bureau of any criminal activity which could be associ-
ated with Ray. The Bureau investigated the possibility
that Ray participated in a bank robbery at Alton, Illinois,
in 1967, but it was established that he was not a partici-
pant.
Ray related to author Huie that he robbed a food

* store in Canada, and that an individual named "Raoul"
furnished him fumds on a continuous basis for various
undertakings. ‘These matters were actively pursued by the
Bureau but have never been corroborated by then. Nor have
they been corroborated by private inquiries of writers and
joumalists. It is the Bureau's opinion that Ray mst likely
committed on a periodic basis several robberies or burglaries
during this period in order to support himself. Ray's criminal

background does lend credence to this theory.

The task force interviewed Ray's brother, Jerry
Ray (See, Interview of Jerry Ray, December 20, 1976, App.
B). He stated that to his knowledge family members did
not provide James with any funds. Jerry admitted he met
with his brother two or three times during his employment
at the Winnetka restaurant and advised that he, not Jams,
paid for their eating and drinking expenses. However,
when Jerry again saw his brother on his return from Canada
in August, 1967, James did have some money because it was
he who paid for their expenses which included a motel room.
Jerry added that James also gave him his car commenting
that he would purchase a more expensive car in Alabama.
Jerry stated he was unaware of where his brother had
obtained his money as well as the amount of money he had
at this time.

Accordingly, ‘the sources for Ray's fimds still

remain a mystery today.

4. Family Contacts and Assistance

Our review of the files indicated that the FBI
had no hard evidence linking James Ray to any conspiracy
to kill Dr. King. Absent such evidence, the Bureau
apparently discounted the significance of any contact
between Ray and his family. As the Chicago case agent
told us, it is not unusual for a fugitive or a person
who has committed a given crime to be in touch with
family members. While such contact may render the actions
of the family member criminally liable, it is not generally
pursued absent some evidence of direct participation in the
crime.

However, in light of the fact that a good deal
of mystery still surrounds James Ray and the assassination,
particularly the means by which he financed his life style
and. travels, we concluded that on the basis of the infor-
mation which was uncovered, the Bureau should have pursued
this line of the investigation more thoroughly.

The connection of the Ray family to the crime against
Dr. King may have been nonexistent. This does not alter the
fact, however, that the FBI discovered that the subject of -
the largest manhunt in history had been aided in his fugitive
status by at least one family member. This and other facts
suggestive of family assistance became clear as the Bureau's

investigation progressed.

-101-



‘e) Q

First, John and verry Ray nad significance contacts
with James while he was in Missouri State Penitentiary
(MSP) at Jefferson City, Missouri. Jerry Ray visited
James three or four times and had borrowed money from
James on at least one occasion during his confinement
(Chicago 44-1144 Sub G-17). John Ray visited or attempted
to visit James Ray while at MSP on at least nine occasions.
The last visit took place on April 22, 1967, the day before
Ray escaped (HQ 44-338861-4503). The Bureau also discovered.
that while in prison at MSP James Ray hada fellow inmate
send a money order to a fictitiobs company (Albert J. Pepper
Stationary Co.) in St. Louis, Missouri. The money was sent
to the address of Carol Pepper (sister and business partner
of John Ray) where she resided with her husband Albert.
Jemes Ray had told the inmate who sent the money that it was
a way of getting money out of the prison (HQ 44~38861-2614).

Second, James Earl Ray was seen by several people in
both the St. Louis and Chicago areas during the period
immediately after his escape. In St. Louis (where John
Ray was living) two former inmates at MSP, stated that they
had seen James Ray on separate occasions. One stated that
he had seen Ray three times between May 10 and 17, 1967 (Kansas
City, 44-760-786). The other saw Ray entering a bank with
Jimmie Owens and spoke briefly with Ray as they entered

-102-

NW 65360 Docld:32989802 Page 286 |


(HQ 442388613483). Th the Chicago axea where Jecry Ray

was living, the Bureau discovered that James Ray had
‘purchased a car on Jime 5, 1967 (Chicago, 44-1114 Sub D
; Ex. 85) and had worked in Winnetka, Illinois. Ray's
employers also told Bureau agents that Jamés Ray had
received Several calls. fron a man claiming to be Ray's
brother immediately prior to James' departure from his
job. They stated that these calls had a visibly disturbing
effect on James Ray (Chicago 44-1114 Sub G-37). Jerry
Raynes, father of the Ray brothers, told the FBI that he
overheard John and Jerry méntion that James had been in
Chicago. during the summer of 1967 (Chicago 44-1114-508).
Third, in California, the FBI discovered two facts
which pointed toward possible contact between James Ray
and his brothers. Richard Gonzales who was a fellow
student with Ray at the bartending school in Los Angeles
told Bureau agents that Ray had told him upon completion
of the course that he (Ray) was going to visit a brother
in Birmingham for two weeks (HQ 44-38861-1233). The FBI
also interviewed Marie Martin,. cousin of Charles Stein.
She stated that for some time before March 17, 1968, (the
date when Ray left Los Angeles) James Ray had been stating
that he was in need of funds and was waiting for his brother
‘to send him some money. ;

~103-

oO O

Fourth, through an informant the Bureau discovered
that Jerry Ray may not have been entirely candid with the
special agents during his several interviews. The informant
disclosed to Bureau agents on June 7, 1968, that Jerry Ray
stated he had: seen his brother (James) at least once at 7
pre-arranged meeting place in St. Louis shortly after his
escape. Jerry also allegedly stated to the informant that
he had recognized the photograph of Eric Starvo Galt as
being identical with his brother James prior to the time
the FBI had first contacted him in. connection with the
assassination. He did not want to tell the FBI everything
he knew out of fear that James would be caught. (HQ 44-38861-
4594.) s

Correspondence recovered by the Bureau indicated
that Jexry may have heard from James in Canada in June of
1968 (HQ 44~38861-4517 and 4518). James Ray was in Canada
during April and May of 1968 prior to his departure for
London on May 7, 1968. (HQ 44-38861-4595). It is also noted
that Jerry had earlier told’ agents that he had received mail

from James, while James was in prison, at Post Office Box 22

-104-

NW 65360 Docid:32989802 Page 288



Wheeling, Iliinois (Chicago 44-lit Sub G-26).

Finally, in November, ‘1968 it became clear that
James Ray had been in touch with his brother Jerry. Illinois
motor vehicle records showed that on August 25, 1967 James
Ray (using the name of John L. Rayns) transferred his 1962
Plymouth to Jerry (re) 44-38861-5413). This was during the
period when James Ray was making his way from Canada to
Birmingham, Alabama. It has continued to be a mystery
as to why Ray went to Alabama, how he traveled there, and
where he obtained the several thousand dollars he had when
he arrived.

Thus, at least one family member, Jerry, had lied

’ : to the FBI and had became subject to federal criminal charges

for aiding a fugitive. He was never confronted with these

: facts by the Bureau. In the task force interview of Jerry
Ray, he confinned the fact that he had lied to the Bureau and
had seen his brother James on several occasions.*/ Jerry
denied knowing anything about James' travels or his source |
of funds (Interview of Jerry Ray, December 20, 1976, App. B).

However, the task force found the credibility of Jerry's

but an interview was refused in both instances.

O ol

denials to be suspect. In light of this low credibilicy
and critical passage of time which has allowed the statute |
of limitations to run, we concluded that the FBI abandoned
a significant opportunity to obtain answers fran family:
members conceming some of the important questions about
James Earl Ray which still remain.

D. Critical Evaluation Of The Assassination Investigation

As this report reflects, there was a wealth of

information in the files developed by the FBI mmrder

investigation. We have been able to dig up some additioal

data. Only a small part of any of this information has

been made a matter of any official public record. Some of

it was embodied in the stipulation agreed to by James Earl

Ray and judicially acknowledged in open court by him (with

a stated reservation as to agreeing to the wording indicating

a lack of a conspiracy). Sowe emerged in Ray's post-conviction

efforts to get a new trial. A quantity of the "umofficial"

evidentiary data and a great deal of mis-information was

gleaned by the news media and by professional writers. It

is understandable therefore that many suspicions have been

generated and, because of Justice Department rules against

disclosures of raw investigative files, have gone unanswered.
First, the task force has concluded that the investi-

| gation by the FBI to ascertain and capture the murderer of

~106-

NW 65360 Docld:32989802 Page 290 i


NW 65360 Docld:32989802 Page 291 \

Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., was thoroughly, honestly
and successfully conducted. We submit that the mimute
details compacted in this report amply support this con-
clusion.

At the very outset of the investigation telegrams
went to all field offices of the Bureau instructing the
Special Agents in Charge to take personal supervision’ of
the investigation, to check out all leads in 24 hours, and
noting that they would be held personally responsible.

HQ 44-38861-153). The files we reviewed show that this
directive was conscientiously followed. The Bureau sought
first to identify and locate the murderer using the obvious
leads. They checked out aliases, tracked the traces left
under the Galt alias, and used the knowm fingerprints from
the murder weapon and the contents of the blue zipper bag
‘left on South Main Street to eliminate suspects. ‘this
backtracking ended in Atlanta. At this point the Bureau
initiated a check of the crime site fingerprints against
the white male "wanted fugitive" print file. This produced
the almost "instant" discovery that the wanted man, Galt,
was James Earl Ray, oy escapee from Missouri State Prison.
In fact the "instant" discovery was a tedious hand search
started in a file of some 20,000 prints. That it took only
two hours to make a match is said by the Bureau experts to

-107-



oO O
be largely sheez luck; it could have taken days. We
accept the explanation that the fingerprint search was a
normal next resort after nommal lead procedures were
exhausted.
Second, the task force views the evidence pointing
to the guilt of James Earl Ray as the man who purchased
the murder gun and who fired the fatal shot to be conclusive.
It was possible for the task force to create a well
documented history of James Earl Ray from the moment of
his escape to his capture in England, using the investigation
reports in the FBI files-and to corroborate and fill in
essential details with Ray's own statements (admissions)
in his letters to author William Bradford Huie. From this
chronology, from the laboratory proof, and fran Ray's
judicial admissions it was concluded that he was the assassin,
and that he acted alone. We saw no credible evidence pro-

s bative of the possibility that Ray and any co-conspirator
were together at the scene of the assassination. Ray's
assertions that someone else pulled. the trigger are so
patently self-serving and so varied as to be wholly unbeliev-
able. They becom, in fact, a part of the evidence of his
guilt by self-refutation.

Third, we found that conspiracy leads (aliunde Ray's

versions) had been conscientiously mm down by the FBI even

-108-

NW 65360 Docld:32989802 Page, 292


@ @
though they had no possible relation to Ray's stories
or to the know facts. The results wera negative.

We found no evidence of any complicity on the part
of the Memphis Police Department or of the FBI.

We acknowledge that proof of the negative, i.e.,
proof that others were not involved, is here as elusive
and difficult as it has universally been in criminal law.
But the sum of all of the evidence of Ray's guilt points
to him so exclusively that it most effectively makes the
point that no one else was involved. Of course, someone
could conceivably have provided him with logistics, or
even paid him to commit the crime. However, we have
found no competent evidence upon which to base such a
theory.

Fourth, it is true that the task force unearthed
some new data - data which answers some persistent questions
and which the FBI did not seek. But the Bureau concentrated
on the principal in the case and much was not considered
important to his discovery and apprehension. We find no

‘ dishonesty in this. A lead suggesting that one or both
of James Earl Ray's brothers were in contact with him after,
and in aid of, his escape in 1967 from the Missouri State
Prison, and before the murder of Dr. King, was not followed.
It was not unearthed until after Ray's capture in England

on June 8, 1968; it was then apparently deemed a lead made

~109-

‘
NW 65360 Docid:32989802 Page 293 {



sterile by supervening events. By hindsight the task
force believes Jerry and John Ray could have been
effectively interrogated further to learn their knowledge,
if any, of James Earl Ray's plans, his finances and whether
they helped him after King's death.

Finally, the task force observed instances of FBI
headquarter's reluctance to provide the Civil Rights
Division and the Attorney General with timely reports on
the course of the murder investigation. For example,
early in the investigation in a reaction to a press report
of Attorney General Clark's expectation of making a progress
report to the nation, FBI Director Hoover wrote: "We are
not going to.make any progress reports" (HQ 44-38861-1061) .

The Bureau files reflect a significant degree of
disdain for the supervisory responsibilities of the Attorney
General and the operating Divisions of the Department. For
example, the Attorney Géneral authorized the institution of
prosecutive action against the suspect "Galt" (Birmingham
44-1740-1005). But then, apparently without fucther consul-
tation with the Attorney-General or the Civil Rights
Division, the Bureau prepared’ and filed a criminal complaint.
‘The Bureau selected Binningham as the venue in which to
file the complaint in preference to Memphis because the
Bureau could not rely, on the U.S. Attorney at Memphis"

-110-

Docld:32989802 Page 294



and "would lose control of the situation" (HQ 44-38861-1555) .

The Bureau scenario called for then advising the Attormey
_ General "that circumstances have required the action taken"
(HQ 44-38861-1555) .

We submit that in this sensitive case the Departmental
officials in Washington should have been consulted.

As another example, at the extradition stage of the
case, marked discourtesy was exhibited to the Attomey
General and to Assistant Attorney General Fred Vinson. In
a telephone discussion with the Attorney General who
complained of being "kept in the dark", an Assistant to
‘the Director accused the Attorney General of falsifications
and “hung up the phone". Again, when Assistant Attorney
General Vinson was detailed to England to arrange for the
extradition of James Earl Ray, the Legal Attache was ordered
to be "diplomatic but fixm with Vinson and that under no
circumstances should Vinson be allowed to push our personnel
around" (HQ 44~38861-4447) .

The task force views this lack of coordination and
cooperation as highly improper. The Attorney General and
the Division of the Department having prosecutorial
responsibility for an offense being investigated should be
kept fully abreast of developments. The responsible

-lll-

6) | 6)

Division, moreover, should have sufficient control of the
Bureau's investigations to insure that the legal necessities
of pleading and proof are met

In fairness to the Bureau it has to be observed
that it is the obligation of. the Department to insist on
these perogatives. We do not think it effectively did so
in the King murder case.

TIL. THE SECURITY INVESTIGATION

A. FBI Surveillance And Harassment Of Dr. King

1. Initiation of Technical Surveillance and
@: RO Type Activities

In order to reconstruct the actions taken by
menbers of the FBI toward Dr. King, the task force
scrutinized the basis for the initiation by the Bureau
of any action with respect to Dr. King. During the review
it was revealed that on May 22, 1961, Mr. Alex Rosen, then
Assistant Director of the General Investigative Division
(Division 6), advised Director Hoover in an information
memorandum, per his request on Dr. King and four other
individuals in conection with the "Freedom Riders,"
that "King has not been investigated by the FBI" (Meno
from Scatterday to Rosen, May 22, 1961, App. A, Ex. 7).
The memorandum contained few references on Dr. King. The
Director commented, with regard to the omission of a subject
matter investigation on Dr. King: "Why not?" The substance
of the report was forwarded to Attorney General Kennedy, and
the FBI did not pursue the King matter at this time. Thus,
FBI persormel did not have nardid they assume a personal
interest in the activities of Dr. King through May, 1961.
Furthermore, in 1961, information in the Bureau files on

-113-

NW 65360 Docld:32989802 Page 297



Dr. King had only been gleaned from sporadic reports,
and this particular report to the Director was provided
by Division 6 which had responsibility for civil rights
matters. ‘

In the beginning of 1962, the FBI started and
rapidly continued to gravitate toward Dr. King. The
sequence of events has already been reported in some
detail by the Senate Select Committee as well as in the
Robert Murphy Report which you received in March, 1976.

The task force in its review of pertinent documents con-
fizms these reports, 7

In essence, the Director conmmicated to Attorney
General Kennedy during 1962. and 1963 a host of memoranda
concerning the interest of the Commmist Party in the
civil rights movement, and, in particular, Dr. King's

_xelationship with two frequently consulted advisors whom
the FBI had tabbed as members of the Commnist Party. As
a result of the deep interest in civil rights affairs by the
Attorney General and by the Kennedy Administration, these FBI
reports had the effect of alarming Robert Kennedy and affecting
his decisions on the national level.

The net effect of the Bureau memoranda nearly
culminated in the summer of 1963 when Attorney General

-114-

NW 65360 Docid:32989802 Page 298


NW 65360 Docld:32989802 Page 299°

Kennedy suggested consideration of technical surveillance
on King and the SCLC (HQ 100-106670-3631). Previously,
the bulk of FBI intelligence on Dr. King was secured by
technical surveillance of one of his advisors and from
informants close to his associates. However, when Attorney
General Kermedy was confronted shortly thereafter with the
Director's request for such surveillances, he reconsidered
his suggestion and denied the request (HQ 100-106670-165,
171). Attorney General Kennedy as well as several other
Department officials were sincerely concerned with King's
association with alleged commmist members since proposed
civil rights legislation was then very vulnerable to the
attack that commmists were influencing the direction of the
civil rights movement. Yet, an affirmative program to
gather intelligence with King as the subject was still
considered ill-advised. However, a significant turn of
events within the circles of the FBI hierarchy would soon
reverse the Attorney General's decision, and without his
knowledge the FBI would also launch an illegal counter-
intelligence program directed to discredit and neutralize
the civil rights leader.

Director Hoover's demeanor toward Dr. King has been
well publicized and is summarized below. Certainly, as

the task force determined, this played a vital role in

-115-



oO oO

FBI affairs, as did tne Director's attitude toward the
Communist Party. On-August 23, 1963, then Assistant
Director. of the Domestic Intelligence Division, William

¢. Sullivan, pursuant to the Director's request, presented

a seventy-page analysis of exploitation and influence by

the Commmist Party on the American Negro population since
1919 (HQ 100-3-116-253X). ‘This report and Mr. Sullivan's
synopsis showed ‘a failure of the Commmist Party in achieving
any significant inroads into the Negro Population, and the :
civil rights movement. Director Hoovér responded: :

"This memo reminds me vividly

of those I received when -Castro.
took over Cuba. ‘You contended

then that Castro and his. cohorts
were not Commmists and not
influenced by Commmists:. Time
alone proved you wrong. TI for

oné can't ignore the memos

as having only an infinitesimal
effect on the efforts to exploit the
American Negro by Commmists" (HQ 100-
3-116-253X) . .

The Director's cament had a resounding effect
on Mr. Sullivan. Seven days later, ‘he replied:

"The Director is correct. We
were completely wrong.about
believing the evidence was not
sufficient to determine some
years ago: that Fidel Castro was
not a commmist or under communist
influence. In investigating and

-116-

NW 65360 Docld:32989802 Page 300


writing about commmism and the
American Negro, we had better
remember this and profit by the
lesson it should teach us."" (Memo
from Sullivan to Belmont, August
30, 1963, App. A, Ex. 8). ~

Even more importantly, Mr. Sullivan also said

in response to the action that he now believed was

necessitated in determining commmist influence in the

civil rights movement:

"Therefore, it may be unrealistic

to limit ourselves as we have been
doing to legalistic proof or definite-
ly conclusive evidence that would
stand up in testimony in court or
before Congressional committees that
the Commist Party, USA, does wield
substantial influence over Negroes
which one day could becane decisive."
(iden. ) .

The FBI hierarchy had no written comments on this memo-

randum either supporting or negating the Assistant Director's

proposed line of action.

Then, in September, 1963, Mr. Sullivan recommended

"increased coverage of commmist influence on the Negro’

QYemo from Baumgardner to Sullivan, September 16, 1963,
App. A, Ex. 9). The Director refused and commented:

NW 65360 Docid:32989802 Page 301

"No I can't understand how you

can so agilely switch your think-
ing and evaluatio. Just a few
weeks ago you contended that the
Commmist influehce in the racial
movement was ineffective and infin-
itesimal. This - notwithstanding

-117-



many memos of specific instances

of infilrracion, Now you want

to load the field dom with more
coverage in spite of your recent t
memo depreciating CP influence

in racial movenent. I don't intend

to waste time and money until you

‘can make up your minds what the
situation really is" (idem.)

In commenting on a cover memo to the above Sulliyan
request; Director Hoover also stated, "I have certainly
been misled by previous metios which clearly showed
communist, penetration of the racial movement. The
attached is contradictory of all that. We are wasting
manpower and money investigating CP effect in racial
movement if the attached is correct'' (Memo for the Director
fran Tolson; September 18, 1963, App. A, Ex. 10).

By now the Domestic Intelligence Division was
feeling. the full weight of the Director's dissatisfaction
with ‘their work product. Mr. Sullivan again replied on
September 25, 1963, in a humble mamer that Division 5

‘had failed in its interpretation of commmist infiltration

in the Negro movement (Memo from Sullivan to Belmont,
September 25, 1963, App. A, Ex. 11). The Assistant Director
asked the Director's forgiveness and requested. the oppor-
tunity to approach this grave matter in the light of the
Director's interpretation. Director Hoover sanctioned

this request but again reprimanded Mr. Sullivan for stating

-118-

NM 65360 Docld:32989802 Page 302


that commist infiltration “has not reached the point

of control or domination." The Director curtly commented
that "Certainly this is not true with respect to the
King connection" (idem). One could now foresee that
Dr. King would be closely watched by FBI persomel.
In October, 1963, the Director forwarded a request
to the Attorney General for technical surveillance of
Dr. King's residence and the SCLC office in New York City.
This time the FBI received authorization for technical
surveillance and it was instituted almost immediately.
In addition, the FBI had prepared a new analysis on
“ commmist involvement in the Negro movement (Communism
and the Negro Movement, October 16, 1963, App. A, Ex. 12).
A cover memorandum of this analysis written by Assistant
to the Director A.H. Belmont to Associate Director Clyde
A. Tolson reads:
"The attached analysis of Communism
and the Negro Movement is highly
explosive. It can be regarded as a
personal attack on Martin Luther
King. There is no doubt it will
have a heavy impact on the Attorney
General and anyone else to whom we
disseminate it ... This memorandum
may startle the Attorney General,
particularly in view of his past
association with King, and the fact
that we are disseminating this out-
side the Department"’ (Memo fron

Belmont to Tolson, October 17, 1963
App. A, Ex. 13).

-119-

NW 65360 Docld:32989802 Page 303



oO O

To the latter pert, the Director wrote, "We must do our
duty." Mr. Belmont further said:

"Nevertheless, the memorandum is a

powerful warning against Commmist

influence in the Negro movement ..."
The Director issued his feeling to this position and
added, "I am glad that you recognize at last that there
exists such influence."

2, Predicate for the Security Investigation

The security investigation of Dr. Martin Juther King,
Jr., and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC)
was predicated on the belief that they were under the
influence of the Commmist Party, United States of America
(CPUSA). The basis for this belief was that Dr. King relied
upon one particular advisor who was tabbed by the FBI as a
ranking Commmist Party member (HQ 100-392452-133).

This characterization of the advisor was provided by
‘sources the Bureau considered reliable. The task force was
privy to this characterization through both our file review
and our September 2, 1976, conferencé with representatives
of the Bureau's Intelligence Division. For security
purposes the sources were not fully identified to the
task force. Therefore, the veracity of the sources and the
characterization are remaining questions.

The advisor's relationship to King and the SCLC
is amply evidenced in the files and the task forcé
concludes that he was a most trusted advisor. The files
are replete with instances of his counseling King and

his organization on matters pertaining to organization,

examples follow:
i The advisor organized, in King's name, a fund
raising society (HQ 100-106670-47, 48). This organization
and the SCLC were in large measure financed by concerts
arranged by this person (HQ 100-106670-30). He also
lent counsel to King and the SCLC on the tax consequences
of charitable gifts.
On political strategy, he suggested King make a‘
public statement calling for the appointment of a black
to the Supreme Court (HQ 100-106670-32, 33). This person
advised against accepting a movie offer from a movie
: director and against approaching Attorney General Kennedy
on behalf of a labor leader (HQ 100-106670-24). In each
instance his advice was accepted.
King's speech before ‘the AFL-CIO National Convention
in December, 1961 was written by this advisor (HQ 100-392452-
131). He also. prepared King's May 1962. speech before the
United Packing House Workers Convention (HQ 100-106670-119).
In 1965 he prepared responses to press questions directed
to Dr. King from a Los Angeles radio station regarding
the Los Angeles racial riots and from the "New York Times'"
regarding the Vietnam War.

The relationship between King and his advisor,
as indicated, is clear to the task force. What is not
clear is whether this relationship ought to have been
considered either a possible national security threat or
CPUSA directed. We conclude that justification may have
existed for the opening of King's security investigation
but, its protracted continuation was unwarranted.

Our conclusion that the investigation's opening
may have been justified is primarily based on memoranda,
sumnarized below, written during the first six months of
1962. It is pointed out that in October, 1962 the Bureau
ordered the CCMINFIL SCLC investigation (HQ 100-438794-9).

: In January the Director wrote the Attorney General
‘and told him that one of King's advisors was a commmist.
At this time he also pointed out that the advisor wrote
King's December, 1961 AFL-CIO speech and assisted King in
SCLC matters (HQ 100-392452-131).

In March the Attorney General was advised that a
March 3, 1962 issue of "The Nation'' magazine carried an

~123-

NW 65360 Docld:32989802 Page 307



O O

article critical of the administration's handling of
civil rights. The article was ostensibly written by
Martin Luther King but in fact the true author was
another advisor characterized by the FBI as a ranking
member of the Commmist Party (HQ 100-106670-30, 31).

Tn May the Attorney General learned that the CPUSA
considered King and the SCLC its most important work because
the Kennedy Administration was politically dependent upon
King (HQ 100-106670-58) .

lastly, in, June, 1962 the Attorney General became
aware that King's alleged Commmist advisor had recommended
the second ranking Commmist to be one of King's principal
assistants (HQ 100-106670-79, 80). Later King accepted
the recommendation. ;

The conclusion that the investigation's continuance
was unwarranted is based on the following task force finding:

The Bureau to date has no evidence whatsoever that
Dr. King was ever a commmist ox affiliated with the CPUSA. -
This was so stated to us by representatives of the Bureau's
Intelligence Division during our September 2, 1976 conference.
This admission is supported by our perusal of files, which
included infortants' memoranda and physical, microphone and
telephone surveillance memoranda, in which we found no such

indication concerning Dr. King.
-124-

NW 65360 Docld:32989802 Page 308



The Bureau provided us with no documentation
that the SCLC under Dr. King was anything other than a
legitimate organization devoted to the civil rights mve-
ment. '

The Bureau files that we examined lacked eny infor-
mation that the alleged Commmists' advice was dictated by
the CPUSA or inimical to the interests of the United States.
Indeed, in early 1963 the Bureau learned through reliable
sources the principal advisor had disassociated himself
from the CPUSA. His reason was the CPUSA was not suffi-
ciently involving itself in race relations and the civil
rights movement (HQ 100-392452-195).

3. Kin ig-Hoover Dispute

The flames of Director Hoover's antipathy for
Dr. King were fanned into open hostility in late 1962 when
Dr. King criticized the Bureau's performance during an
investigation of a racial disturbance in Albany, Georgia.
Efforts to interview King by the Bureau were not successful
(HQ 157-6-2-965) and the matter lay dormant for a time.

The controversy was publicly rekindled in early 1964
when the Director testified before a House appropriations

subcommittee that he believed commmist influence existed

~125-

NW 65360 Docld:32989802 Page 309



O O

in the Negro movement. King countered by accusing the
Directoy of ahetting racists and right wingers (HQ 100-3
116-1291). During November of 1964, the Director told

a group of Washington women reporters that King was "the
most notorious liar in the. country." A week later, Director
Hoover referred to "sexual degenerates in pressure groups"
in a speech at Loyola University (HQ 162-7827-16).

Dr. King and his immediate staff requested a meeting
with Director Hoover to clear up the misunderstanding. The
meeting was held on December 1, 1964. Hoover claimed that
"he had taken the ball away from King at the beginning,"
explaining the Bureau's function and doing most of the
talking. On the other hand, King apologized for remarks
attributed to him and praised the work of the Bureau. Thus,
an uneasy truce was momentarily reached. (HQ 100-106670-563,
607.)

However, the controversy flared again when a letter
was circulated by the Southem Christian Educational Find
(SCEF) which referred to the criticism of Dr. King by the’
Director and urged the recipients of the letter to write
or wire the President to remove Hoover from office. Ina
memo from Sullivan to Belmont on December 14, 1964, ‘Sullivan
stated:

~126-

prudent step that we can take to emerge ©
completely victoriously In this conflict,

We should not take any ineffective or

half-way measures, nor blind .curselves

_ to the realities of the situation,”

(HQ 100-106670-627.)

We believe the persistent controversy between Dr.

King and Director Hoover was a major factor in the Bureau's
detennination to discredit Dr. King and ultimately destroy
his leadership role in the civil rights movement,

4. Technical Surveillance

Our review of FBI files and interviews with Bureau
personnel substantially confirms with a few additions the
findings which have. already been reported by Mr. Murphy
and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence with respect
to the electronic surveillance of Dr. xing and his associates.

We found that some microphone surveillances were
installed in New York City against Dr. King and his associates
which have not thus far been reported. These installations
were as follows:

Americana Hotel (HQ 100-106670-2224, 4048)

4/2-3/65 ( symbol)

Peas J ol)

Sheraton Atlantic (NY 100-136585 Sub-Files 7-8)
12/10-11/65 (sybol)

New York Hilton ae 100-136585 Sub Files 11-12)
10/25-27/65 (symbol)

~127-


O O

“All of these installations with the exception of
the placement at the Americana Hotel in January, 1966
appear to have been unproductive ‘ether because Dr. King
did not reside at the hotel as planned or the recordings
‘made did not pick up any significant information,

The installation by the New York Field Office at
the Americana Hotel on Jamary 21, to 24, 1966, caused
some consternation within the FBI hierarchy and is
illustrative of how the Bureau apparatus could,on rare
occasion, continue- to fumctién even contrary to the wishes
of the Director. ‘The installation was made at the Americana
on January 21, 1966, pursuant to the request of SAC Rooney
in New York. Assistant Director William Sullivan authorized
the coverage. Bureau files indicate that Associate ~
Director ClydeTolson, upon being informed of the coverage,
wrote back on the same day in a rather perturbed fashion to
have the microphone removed "at once." Tolson advised the
Director that "no one here’ approved the coverage and that ©
he had again instructed Sullivan to have no microphone
installations without the Director's approval, Hoover
confirmed Tolson's directive. (HQ 100-106670-2224x).

No symbol number was ever attached to this coverage
as was the standard practice. This was apparently due to
the strong disapproval voiced by Headquarters. Yet, despite

~128-

NW 65360 Docid:32989802 Page 312



Hoover's orders, the coverage was maintained and a good

deal of intelligence on King's personal activities was

obtained and transcribed. These activities are ‘reflected

in a six page memorandum. (HQ 100-106670-4048.)
Irrespective of the level of Bureau approval

which was required for electronic surveillance installa-

tions during the King years, our review reinforced the

conclusions of the Senate Select Committee that the purposes

behind this intelligence gathering became twisted. Several

instances of Bureau correspondence are instructive. Section

Chief Baumgardner in recommending coverage of King in

Honolulu urged an exposure of King's "moral wealness"
so that he could be "for the security of the nation, com-
pletely discredited" (HQ 100-106670 June File, Memo Baumgardner
to Sullivan, January 28, 1964). Tn a similar meno fram
Sullivan to Belmont recommending coverage in Milwaukee at
the Schroeder Hotel, the expressed purpose was to gather
information on "entertainment" in which King might be engaging
similar to that "uncovered at the Willard Hotel" (HQ 100-
106670 Jume File, Memo Sullivan to Belmont, January 17, 1964).
Director Hoover, upon being informed of the results
of the surveillance, ordered that they all be immediately
transcribed despite DeLoach's recommendation that the tran-
scribirig be done later (HQ 100-106670-1024). As each of the

re) oO

file reviews has shown, portions of summaries of the
transcripts were widely disseminated among governmental
officials. These disseminations included a rather
comprehensive six volume transmittal by the Bureau in
June, 1968. This was at the apparent request of the
President through Special Counsel Larry Temple for all
information concerning Dr. King, including the instructions
and approval of former Attorney General Kennedy regarding
the electronic surveillance of King (Mem R. W. Smith to
‘William Sullivan, June 2, 1968, referring to memo DeLoach
to Tolson, May 24, 1968, setting forth the President's
request). Included with the transcripts were several
summaries, previously disseminated, and several hundred
pages of Bureau commmications to the White House from
1962 to 1968 regarding King and his associates. The
purpose of the White House request was not stated, but it
was the Most complete accumulation of transmitted informa-
tion on the electronic surveillance of King which we
encountered during our review of Bureau files. The task
force noted the timing of the alleged White House request

and subsequent transmittal particularly iri light of

-130-

INW 65360 Docld:32989802 Page 314



Director Hoover's commmication to the White House on ~
March 26, 1968 (included in the transmittal) which
advised that Robert Kenedy had attempted to contact
Dr. King before announcing his candidacy for the
Presidency (HQ 100-106670-3262).

The task force reviewed selected portions of all
of the transcripts in the King file as well as selected
portions of several tapes from which the transcripts
were obtained. An inventory of the tapes reviewed is
set forth below:

1) Washington, D.C., 1/5-6/64 (Willard Hotel,
15 reels) - Reel Nos. 1-6, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 14

2) Atlanta Tape (symbol) ‘(one reel)
3) Composite Tape 12/15/64
.Track No. 1 - Washington, D.C. recordings
(edited. version of 15. reels)
Essentially, we reviewed the tapes by listening to the
beginning, middle, and end of each tape and compared it to
the corresponding transcript. They were basically accurate
transcriptions in the sense that what was in the transcripts
was also on the tapes. However, some material on the tapes
was not put on the transcripts apparently because either

that portion of the recording was garbled or unclear or

it was considered unimportant.

-131-

NW 65360 Docld:32989802 Page 315



Our review of the composite tape, the Atlanta
tape and the agents handwritten notes included in the
box with the recordings from the Willard Hotel gave an

additional indication of where the Bureau's interest
lay with respect to Dr. King. ‘The composite tape contained
"highlights" of the fifteen reels of tape from the Willard
Hotel and appeared to consist of little more than episodes
of private conversations and activities which the Bureau
chose to extract from the original recordings. The

7 Atlanta tape was obtained from the telephone tap on the
King residence and consisted ofsseveral of Dr. King's

conversations. Thése included conversations of Dr. King
with his wife regarding his personal life and had nothing
to do with-his political ‘or civil rights activities. The
handwritten notes from the original: Willard tapes contained
notations-as to what point in the tape a particular personal
. activity or conversation took placé. :

5. COINTEIPRO-Type and Other ‘Tllegal Activities

The task force has documented an extensive program
within the FBI during the years 1964 to 1968. to discredit
Dr. King. Pursuant to a Bureau meeting on Decenber 23, 1963:
to plan a King strategy and the Sullivan proposal in January,
1964 to promote a new black leader, the FBI accelerated its

~132-

NW 65360 Docld:32989802 Page 316


program of disseminating derogatory information, which
was heavily fraught with the Bureau's ow characteriza-
tions of King, to various individuals and organizations
who were in critical positions vis-a-vis the civil rights
leader. Our review has essentially confixméd those already
performed by the Civil Rights Division and the Senate Select
‘Committee and we, therefore, do not dwell on those areas
which they have already covered. We did find, however,
additional proposed activities against Dr. King, some of
which were approved by the Director. They are instructive
not only in revealing the extent to which the Bureau was
willing to carry its efforts but also in showing the
atmosphere among some of the rank and file which this
program against King created.

In November, 1964, the Bureau discovered ‘that
Dr. King was desirous of meeting with high British officials
while in England during King's planned trip to Europe.
Section Chief Baumgardner recommended a briefing for the
purpose of informing British officials concerning King's
purported commmist affiliations and private life
(HO 100-106670-522, 523). Within three days the briefings
had been completed (HQ 100-106670-525, 534, 535).

-133-

NW 65360 Docld:32989802 Page 317



O O

One particular dissenination, the contents of which
was not revealed in the files, was apparently. initiated
and carried-out personally by the Director. On.January 22,

1965, the SAC in Atlanta advised Mr,. Sullivan that,

pursuant to their electronic surveillance, the Bureau
learned that King had phoned Ralph Abernathy: and complained
that Hoover had had a meeting with a particular Atlanta
official while in Washington attending the. Inauguration.
According to King, when this official returned.to

Atlanta he contacted Dr. King senior and passed on.a

"good deal" of information. According to Sullivan's.

memo to Belmont, Dr. King, Jz.. was very upset (HQ.100-
106670-768). The files did not reveal any formal proposal
for this briefing but Section Chief Baumgardner later speculated
that the Atlanta official was Chief of Police. Jenkins
since the Director -had met with him on January.18, 1965
(HQ 100-106670-780). The files do-not indicate whether
the Director suggested that the information. be passed on
to Dr. King's father’. :

NW 65360 Docld:32989802 Page 318


In conection with the post-assassination

efforts to declaré a national holiday in memory of
Dr. King the Senate Select Committee has outlined
in its report the attempts by the Bureau to prevent
such a declaration by briefing various members of
Congress on King's background (HQ 100~106670-3586) .
We discovered that the Bureau also sent a monograph
on King to the President and the Attorney General.
in 1969 for this same purpose (HQ 100-106670-3559).
The Bureau's efforts to discredit Dr. King's
movement also included attempts to damage the
reputation of King's family and friends. The Bureau
looked. -very..closely..at. Coretta King although. a
security investigation was never opened. This
included scrutinizing her travels in an attempt
to uncover possible facts embarrassing to her.

These attempts also included a plan, proposed

-135-

NW 65360 Docld:32989802 Page 319



O oO

by Assistant to the Director DeLoach and approved

by Hoover to leak information to the press that Coretta
King and Ralph Abernathy were deliberately plotting to

keep the assassination in the news by claiming a conspiracy
existed in order to keep monetary contributions flowing
for their benefit (HQ 44-38861-5654).

Ralph Abernathy and Andrew Young also became Bureau
targets. Shortly after the assassination the field was
instructed to report any information on possible ''immral
activities" of King's two associates (HQ 62-108052-Unrecorded
serial, Atlanta to Director, April 29, 1968). Presumably
there were COINTELPRO type purposes behind this request.

The Atlanta Field Office in attempting to demonstrate
the initiative and imagination demanded by Headquarters
proposed additional measures against Ralph Abernathy. The
Bureau leamed that after Dr. King's death, Rev. Abernathy
may have voiced some concern over possible assassination
attempts on-his om life. The Atlanta office proposed that.
the Bureau begin notifying Abernathy directly (instead of
only informing the police) of.all threats against him in
order to confuse and worry him (HQ 62-108052-Unrecorded
serial, Atlanta to Director, March 28, 1969). This activity

“was not approved by Headquarters,

-136-.

NW 65360 Docld:32989802 Page 320



NW 65360 Docld:32989802 Page 321

e : e

Bureau files indicate that the FBI may have also
attempted to help the executive branch in its efforts
to deal with Abernathy after King's death. In a memo
to Associate Director Tolson, Director Hoover related
a telephone conversation with former Vice President
Agnew in which Mr. Agnew expressed concern over the
"inflamnatory'' statements which Abernathy had made.

The Vice President was seeking information from Hoover
which could be useful in destroying the credibility of
Rev. Abernathy. Hoover agreed to the request (HQ 100-
106670-Unrecorded serial, Hoover to Tolsm, May 18, 1970).
We did not find what information, if any, was forwarded
to the Vice President.

Finally, we discovered that a series of illegal
surreptitious entries was conducted by the FBI. Some
of these entries had as one purpose, among others, the
obtaining of information about Dr. King. The FBI in
the review of its indices was unable to locate records

of any entries onto the premises of Dr. King or the SCLC.

-137-


The agents began to retrieve information about
Dr. King during these entries through the use of photo-
graphs. In one instance a supervisor in the appropriate
field office requested authority to conduct an entry
for the express purpose of obtaining information about
‘Dr. King. ‘The proposed entry was approved at Head-
quarters pursuant toa telephone call by an Inspector
and was later conducted, :

Qn four subsequent occasions the Bureau again
conducted entries and obtained information concerning
King and the SCLC. On one such occasion a specimen of
King's handwriting was obtained. The purpose of
gathering this piece of intelligence was not revealed.

a policy at the time of these eritries
required "che approval of such field requests by
Director Hoover or Associate Director Tolson (Memo
Director, FBI, to Attorney General, Septenber 23, 1975).

We assume that such approval was granted. Handwritten

notatioris on the field office memos. indicaté that

the Bureau was advised of the entries in each case.

We also raise the issue of .these illegal entries
because aside from being violative of Fourth Amendment
rights the entries ran the risk of invading a privileged
relationship.

We note in passing that the FBI continued’ to-
employ an informant in the SCLC despite the fact that
the informant conceded to agents that the informant: had
embezzled some SCLC funds. The Bureau voiced ‘strong _
disapproval of these activities. Yet, no legal or
disciplinary action was ever taken with respect to

the informant, (HQ. 134-11126-56,, 57).
B. Critical Evaluation of the Security Investigation

; In the area of domestic intelligence the ‘mandate ;
-of the FBI has been both broadly and vaguely defined.

It is stated in the Code .of Federal Regulations as: follows:

~139-

NW 65360 Docld:32989802 Page 323


(The FBI -shall:) carry out the Presidential

directive of Septerber 6, 1939, as reaffimned

by Presidential directives of January 8,, 1943,

July 24, 1950 and December 15, 1953, designating

the Federal Bureau of Investigation to take

charge of investigative work in matters relating
to espionage, sabotage, subversive activities,

and related matters (28 CFR 0.85 (d)).

Given this charter and the history of the sometimes
overpowering influence of the’ views of the late Director
J. Edgar Hoover on his subordinates and on succesive
Attomeys General, it was understandable that a security
‘investigation should be initiated into the possible
influence of thé Camunist Party, U.S.A., on Dr. Martin
‘Luther King, Jr. ‘wo of King's. close advisors, at the
outset of the ‘security matter, were reported to: be-
Communist ‘Party members by ‘sources relied upon by the
Bureau.

The security investigation continued for almost
six years until Dr. King's death. It. verified, in our
view, that.one alleged Cammunist was a very influential
advisor to Dr. King (and hence the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference) on the strategy and tactics of
King's leadership of the black civil rights movement of
the early and mid-sixties. Another had no such weight
although he seemed to be of use to King. But this

very lengthy investigative concentration on King and on

-140-

NW 65360 Docld:32989802 Page 324


the principal advisor established, in our opinion, :

that ‘he did not "sell" Dr.’ King any course of conduct

or of advocacy which can be identified as commmist or
"Party line". King, himself never varied publicly or
privately from his commitment to non-violence and did

not advocate the overthrow of the government of the
United States by violence or subversion. To the contrary,
he advocated an end to the discrimination and disenfran-
chisement of minority groups which the Constitution and
the courts denounced in terms as strong as his. We ;
concluded that Dr. King was no threat to domestic security.

And the Bureau's continued intense surveillance
and investigation of the advisor clearly developed that
he had disassociated himself from the Commmist Party
in 1963 because the felt it failed adequately to serve
the civil rights movement. Thus the linch-pin of the
security investigation of Dr. King had pulled himself
out.

We think the security investigation which included
both physical and technical surveillance, should have been
terminated on the basis of what was learned in 1963.

That it was intensified and augmented by a COINTELPRO type
campaign against Dr. King was unwarranted; the COINTELPRO

type campaign, moreover, was ultra vires and very probably
in violation of 18 U.S.C. 241 (and 242), i.e. felonious.

-141-
NW 65360 Docid:32989802 Page 325 :



The continuing security investigation reflects also
that the Attorney General and the Division charged with
xesponsibility for internal security matters failed badly
in what should have been firm supervision of the FBI's

internal security activities.

‘TV. RECOMMENDATIONS

A. As To The Mirder Investigation

The task force does not fault the technical
competence of the investigation conducted into the
death of Dr. King. We found no new evidence which
calls fot action by State or Federal Authorities.
Our concern has developed over administrative
concomitants of the crime detection tactics.

1. The progress of such sensitive cases
as the King murder investigation and the development
of legally sufficient évidence to sustain prosecution
are- properly the ultimate xesporisibility of the Division
of the Department having supervision of the kind of
criminal prosecution involved. The Division head should

delineate what progress r hé wishes. “Thé Buréau

should not be permitted to manipulate its submission of
reports to serve its purposes, such as the protection

of its public relation efforts, or the prevention of the
responsible Division of the Department from causing the
Bureau to pursue a line of inquiry which the Bureau does
not approve. The Attorney General and his Assistants are
the officers most accountable to the electorate and they,

not the police agency, must maintain effective supervision.
-143-

NW 65360 Docid:32989802 Page 327


oO oO

2. As a corollary of our espousal of ‘tighter
Department authority over the FBI, we recommend that the
Bureau's public relations activities and press relations
be controlled by the.Attorney General's Office of Public
Information. Clear directives to prevent the development
of personality cults around particular Bureau Directors
and officials should be dram. Bureau press releases should
be cleared through the Office of Public Information.

3. The task force recommends that in sensitive

cases no criminal action be instituted by the Bureau without

the closest coordination and consultation with the supervising
Division of the Department. This supervision by the Depart-
‘pent should be as tight as the control and consultation the
Bureau had with its Field Offices as exhibited in our review
of the assassination investigation. ;

4, It was observed that almst no blacks were in
the FBI special, agent's corps in the 1960's and none in
the Bureau's hierarchy. This undoubtedly had the -effect
of limiting not only the. dutlock and understanding of the
problems of. race relations, but also must have hindered the
ability of investigators to commmicate fully with blacks
during thé murder investigation.. By way of illustration
had there been black agents in the Memphis Field Office
participating fully in the investigation of Dr. King's
murder, it is mlikely that the interviews with

-144-

NW 65360 Docld:32989802 Page 328


at least three black members of the Menphis Police and Fire
Department would have been ovérlooked. It is also very
probable that black citizen "Iead" input would have been

greater.

B. As To The Security Investigation

The task force was charged to address itself
particularly to the question’ of whether the nature of the
relationship between the Bureau and Dr. King called for
criminal prosecution, disciplinary proceedings, or other
appropriate action. Our responses follow.

1. Because the five year statute of limitations
has long since mm we carmot recommend criminal prosecution
of any Bureau persormel, past or present, responsible for
the possible criminal harrassment of Dr. King. (18 U.S.C.
3282). No evidence of a continuing conspiracy was found.

2. The responsibility for initiating and prolonging
the security investigation rested on the deceased Director
of the Bureau and his immediate lieutenants, some of whom
are also deceased and the remainder of whon _ retired.
They are beyond the reach of disciplinary action. The few
Bureau personnel who had anything to do with the King security
investigation and who are still in active service, did not

make. command decisions and merely followed orders. We do not

-145-

__ NW 65360 Docld:32989802 Page 329



oO oO

think they are the proper sudjects of any disciplinary
‘action. Some of the activities conducted, such as the
technical electronic surveillance, had the approval of
the then Attorney General. The Courts had not adequately
dealt with what authority rested in the executive branch
to initiate such surveillance in the interest of "national
security’. We do not think the "leg men" in ‘the Bureau ~
should ‘be held to an undefined standard of behavior, much
less a standard not observed “by the highest legal officer
of the governinent. ;

The Bureau's OOINTELPRO-type activities, ‘the illicit
dissemination of raw investigative data to discredit
Dr. King, the efforts to intimidate him, to: break up’ his
marriage, and the explicit and implicit efforts to black-
mail him, were not fully knowm to'the Department, but were
none-the-less ordéred and directed by Director Hoover,
Assistant to the Director DeLoach, Assistant Director
Sullivan and the Section Chief under him.

In- our view their subordinates were far removed
from decision responsibility. Moreover, we think the
subordinates clearly felt that, by’ reason. of Director
Hoover's ‘overpoweririg and intimidating domination of the
Bureau, they had no choice’ but to ‘implement the Bureau's

directions. Pumitive action against the very few

-146-

NW 65360 Docid:32989802 Page 330



remaining subordinate agents would seen to the task force

to be inappropriate in these circumstances and at this
very late date.

3. The Bureau's illicit surveillance produced .
tapes and transcripts concerning King and many others.
These may be sought by King's heirs and representatives ot
Worse still, they may be sought by members of the public
.at Large under the Freedom of Information Act. We
recommend that these tapes and transcripts be sealed and
sent to the National Archives and that the Congress be
asked to pass legislation denying any access to then
whatever and authorizing and directing their total
destruction along with the destruction of material in
reports and memoranda derived from then.

4. The potential for abuse by the individual
occupying the office of Ditector of the FBI thas beer
amply demonstrated by our investigation. We think it is
a responsibility of the Department in the first instance
and, secondarily, of the Corigress to oversee the conduct
of the FBI (and the other police agencies of the govern-
ment). We endorse the establishment by the Attorney
General of the Office of Professional Responsibility on
December 9, 1975, as an effective means for intra-departmental

policing of the Bureau. We also think the pexmanent

-147-

“NW 65360 Docid:32989802_Page 331



O 0

Senate Select Committee on Intelligence is an appro-
priate agency of the legislative arm to oversee the ;
performance of the Bureau. Both ‘the Office of Pro-
fessional Responsibility and the Senate Select Comittee
should be expressly designated in their respective
enabling regulations and resolutions to be a place to
which Bureau subordinates may complain, confidentially
and with impunity, of orders. which they believe to
threaten a violation of the civil rights and Liberties
of citizens and inhabitants of the United States.

5. It, seems to us. that the unauthorized malicious
dissemination of investigative data from FBI files should
be.more than the presently prescribed misdemeanor (5 USC
552a(i)(1)). A felony penalty should be added.

Parenthetically, it should be noted here that it
should be made clear that it is improper (but not criminal)

-148- -

‘NW 65360 Docid:32989802 Page 332



for the Bureau to by-pass the Attorney General and deal

directly with the White House.
6. The task force recommends that the FBI have no
| authority to engage in COINTELPRO type activities which
involve affirmative punitive action following Star

Chamber decisions with respect to citizens or inhabitants

(See 18 U.S.C. 241 and 242). We believe that the guide-
lines which the present Attorney General has established
to govern the FBI's domestic security investigations
effectively preclude these activities. Those guidelines
moreover, appear to us to permit only strictly legal
investigative techniques to be employed in full scale
damestic security investigations. ‘This too we endorse.
The foregoing comprises our report and recommenda-

tions. It is respectfully submitted.

Memorandum

H. Belmont
a <

Co
SUBJECT: “Cowunr st PARTY, USA

Reference is made to.the enclosed material: on which the
. Director has written: "This memo reminds me vividly of those I
received when Castro took over Cuba’ ‘Yop contended then that Castro and
. his cohorts were not Communists and not influenced by’ Communists, ‘Time
‘alone proved you wrong. I for one can't ignore the memos re King
et al as, having only an infinitesimal
etzect on the efforts fi exploit the American Negro by the Communists
| The Director is correct, We were completely wrong about
believing the evidence was not sufficient to determine Some years ago
that Fidel Castro was not a communist or tnder communist influence, On
‘investigating ‘and writing about communism and the American Negro, we cl
had better remember this and profit by the lesson it should teach us. ~
i do think that much of the difficulty ‘relating to the memorar
‘dum vightly questioned by the Director is to be found centered in the
word "influence," We do not have, and no Government agency or private
(Sees has) any yardstick which can accurately measure "influence" |
this particular context, even when we know it does ist such as in
jhe case of the obvious influence of
over Martin Luther King and King's™
Senders." Personally, I believe in the light of King's powerful
“‘demagogic speech yesterday he stands head and shoulders over all other
Negro leaders put together when it comes to influencing great masses of
Negroes. We must nark him now, if we have not done so before, as the
most dangerous Neg: t e_in this jNation fron. the.standpoiry” )

1 ” On determining membership of Negroes in the Communtst Fatty,

we are. not confronted with the same problem. We do have here ‘accurate
yardsticks for establishing membership. Of ¢ourse, our standards are
very exacting. This means there are many Negroes who are fellow-
ttravellers, sympathizers or who aid the Party, knowingly or unknowingly,
put do not qualify as members, These we must not ignore, The old
;communist pring}ple still holds: "Conmunism mustbe, byilt with non-
‘communist hapds/" ‘Therefore, it may be unrealistic to limit durscives as

COMMUNEST PARTY, USA

NEGRO QUESTION iad
100-375

that would stand up in testimony in, court or before Congressional
| committees that the Communist Party, USA, does’ wield substantial
‘Influence over Negroes which one day could become decisive. +
‘ The memorandum which the Director penetratively questioned,
while showing in the details the communist impact on Negroes, did
{ suffer from such limitations. .These limitations we will make every
effort to lift in the future. The great amount of attention this
‘Division is giving to communist activities directed toward the Negro
should enable us. fo do this.. =aabe
For example, here at the Seat of Governnent, the Negro -
communist question takes up as a whole the time of one supervisor and
-during the past few weeks four men have been so occupied. Additionally,
(1) specialized instructions are regularly given the field on communist
infiltration of the Negro; (2) monographs have been written on the
. subject and widely disseminated; (3) regularly disseminated are memoranda
and reports; (4) August 21, 1963, we devoted the entire Current Intelli~
gence Analysis to the communist Plans for the Negro March of August 22,
1963, (149 copies of this- Analysis were disseminated to 44 agencies of
the Government) (5) much material on the issue is given to Agents at
In-Service; and (6) an SAC Letter is under preparation in this Division
now giving the field the benefit of what we learned from the Negro March
on Washington and issuing instructions for increased coverage of
communist influence on the Negro. |

: . As the memorandum pointed out, "this Nation is involved in a.
form of facial reyolution and the-time hi n_SO. right. for
exploitation “of. the Negroes. by.. communist “Nineteen millior
Negroes constitute the greatest single cial target ‘of the Communist
Party, USA. This is a sombre reality we must never lose sight of. tie
, Will do everything possible in the troublea future to develop for the
"Director all available facts relating to Negro membership in the Communis:
'party, plus the more complex and presse eult to ascertain influence

ree communist organizations and officials over the leaders and masses of

1 Negroes

- We regret greatiy that the memorandum did not measure up to
what the Director has a right to expect from our analysis,

Predication: 7 _

Reference is made to the enclosed memorandum dated 9/16/63

ae ,to ‘the attached proposed SAC Letter.

oa

On returning from a few days leave I have been advised of
the Director's continued dissatisZaction with the manner in which *
we prepared a Brief on the above-captioned matter and subsequent.
memoranda on the same subject matter, This situation is very
disturbing to those of us in the Domestic Intelligence Division faa
responsible for this area of work, and we certainly want to de .
everything possible to correct our shortcomings. We absolutely will
not be stubborn about admitting any mistakes we have made or be
stiff-necked and untending concerning our analysis of this matter.
The Director indicated he would not approve our last SAC Letter :
until there was ea clarification and a meeting of minds relative to
the question of tie extent of communist influence over Negroes and
their leaders. In this memorandum I will seriously and sincerely.
try to clarify a‘most regretable situation. It is prepared not on

official office memorandum but rather on plain bond believing that

ie a matter of official record.

e “

Common Agreement:

cae A First, I am sure we all are “Gn agreement.on the following
which was in both the cover memorandum and the detailed brief
attached: (1) for the past 44 years the Communist Party, USA, has
spent enormous sums of money and ceaseless efforts to influence
Negroes and to make communists out of them; (2) the 19 million
Negroes in the country today constitute the greatest single racial
target of the Communist Party, USA; (3) Negro leader Martin Luther
King, _does have aS an extremely important
advisor (4) we
are right now in this nation engaged in a form.of social revolution
and the time has never been so right for exploitation of the
Negroes by communist propagandists; and (5). the Communist Party

“could in the future make prodigious strides and great successes with

the American Negro to the serious detriment of our national security.

showing communist involvement in Negro racial matters in this nation,
relative to which we can all agreo. : ,
Essence of the Situation:

The essence of the situation scems to be this: We
presented what facts there dre in our files in the Brief in question
and I know that the Director certainly would not want us to’ do other
than this. «The position taken at the tine the: Brict was writton was
that, while there is communist influence being ‘exerved. on Negroes
and Negro leaders, it has_not_ xeached ‘the point cf control or
domination. This bi “been. t

orically bas been. the “position ‘of the Bureau
in this matter in light of file reviews going back ten to cwenty

years, Conky Oita Oy mee X Tre iin peep
rentiies er one?
The Historical Position: So? obs OZ i:

For example, in a detailed docunent prepared on causes
“Party and the Negro in 1953, we find the statement. referring to “the
failure of the Communist Party to attract even a significant number
" of Negroes in the United States to its number." -Anothér example is
to be found in aa analysis in this sane field prepared by the Buresu
in 1956 to the effect that comaunist efforts have been "unsuccessful
on 2 state or national level" in infiltrating "legitizxate Negro~
+ fraternal, protest and improvement organizations," although they made
limited success in some "isolated chapters," The Director's book,
Hasters of Deceit, published in 19 States: "It became obvious
that the Party, despite great ef ts, had failed to win over even
a significant minority of Negroes." In 1960 the Director's statement
to The Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate, reads:
"“Y4is no secret that one O1 .the bitverest disappointments of
conmunistic efforts in this Nation has been their failure to lure
our Negro citizens into thé Party." {n 1962 similar public statements
were made. On page seven of the Bricf submitted to the Director
under the date of August 23, 1963, this historical position was
restated and it was said, “One of the bitterest disappointments of
the communists has been their single f£adilure to luxe any significant
minber of our Negro citizens into the Patty." This statement was
set forth again in, the cover memorandum ‘which the Director marked.

The point I wish to eake here is this: The fact that this
[rea been our historical position in the Bureau Zor many years is no

reason to assume that it 15 t ct position at this time, as the
ivector has clearly exp! G aid conditions change and, as
the evidence mounts, naturally we need to change our position along
“ith this evidence. .

Memorandum for Mr, Belmont
RE: COMMUNIST PARTY, USA
NEGRO QUESTION
COMMUNLST INFLUENCE IN RACIAL MATTERS

I would like to set forth here briefly why I think that
the enclosed SAC Letter, which was. returned to us by the Director,
should be sent to the field offices. My first reason is this:
We need to renew our efforts and keep the pressure on and leave

ry And all facts, which exist
facts may not yet have been
“our field oftieee, and will not be unless we
follow up this matter evermore closely with them. My second
reason why I think the SAC Letter should be sent is.related
to the present changing situation inthe ‘Communist Party ~ Negro’
-vrelations area, During the’ past two weeks in particular there
have been sharp stepped-up activities on the part of communist
-officials to infiltrate and to..dominate Negzo developments in
_this country. Further ,.. they are. meeting with successes, This
should be no surprise. to us because since thé Negro march on.
Eee eerod on August 28. communist officials have. been doing, all.
ossible to ex! éploit the very troubled racial situation. As’
they aid weeks ago, the end of the Negro march would be the
beginning of evermore systematic activities on their part to
penetrate and influence. Negroes. and Negro leaders, They are
now in full force acting upon this intention of theirs expressed
weeks ago, The field should be alerted to this fact and given
instructions to investigate exhaustively new communist —- Negro
activities, The SAC Letter in question will be a great help
toward this end, and it should result in our developing important
. facts relating tothe current changes and pertinent activities
. going on during the past few weeks in this.entire field.

Subject of Deep Concern: : a

May I repeat that.our failure to measure up to what the
Director expected of us in the area of, communist - Negro relations
\is a subject of yery, deep concern to us in the Domestic Intelligence

Division, We are disturbed by this and ought to,be, I want him

" RECOMMENDATIONS ¢ :
(i) That the Director reconsider giving approval for sending

(2) In order that other agencies and proninent government

Dear Jim:

In respect to your letter saying that a justice department attorney, Mr.
James F. Walker, would like to interview me concerning the above indict~
ment, I agree with your advice opposing the interview. It would appear
that this would only be in the interest of the J.D. and their book writing
collaborators,e.5., Gerold Frank, George McMillian, st al.

If they had wanted to interview the defendant, under oath, justice had
anple epportunity in the 1974 H.C. hearing in Kenphie, Tennessee, through
their surrogate, W. Henry Halle; anti I understand no representative from
justice appeared as a witness at the hearing.

At the present I believe the only body I should testify before is a jury.

T understand you to say justice has not read any of the trs. of prior
hearings & suits. Thercfore I'll include in the cc copy of this letter
to justice a copy of a Complaint that speaks to the MLK jr. matter with
ettached_Ex--A, althoe I doubt if justice or their publishing associates
will be interested in the Complaint contents. i"
