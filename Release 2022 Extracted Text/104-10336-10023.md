MEMORANDUM FOR: J. Barry Harrelson
Historical Review Group
Center for the Study of Intelligence

FROM: Janet A. Ecklun?
Chief, Information Management Branch
Office of Personnel Security

SUBJECT: Request No. CIA-16 from JFK Board

REFERENCE: CSI 97-062 dated 31 January 1997

1. (U) The Office of Personnel Security has researched
this request from the Assassination Records Review Board
relating to the existence of pre-assassination files on Lee
Harvey Oswald.

2. (U) In response to the specific questions listed
in Mr. Marwell’s letter to the Historical Review Group, the
following responses are provided to those three questions
pertaining to the Office of Personnel Security (OPS). These
responses are the best reasonable answers based on available
information. Please note OPS was known as the Office of
Security prior to 1 October 1994.

Question 1: (U) Please identify, as specifically as
possible, each file held by CIA on Oswald at the time
of the assassination of President Kennedy.

Response: (U) At the time of the assassination, the
Office of Security (OS) held two files which contained
information on Lee Harvey Oswald. A file entitled Defectors
File (#0341008) contained a reference to Lee Harvey Oswald,

and the Office of Security also had a subject file on Lee
Harvey Oswald (#0351164). This information was reflected in
the automated security database known as the Management Data
Program/Personnel Security (MDP/PS). These files were
originally miscellaneous files which were converted to the
above numbers circa 1964. A hand search was also conducted
of microfiche records which were superseded by the automated
system. This hand search produced the same results as the
automated search of MDP/PS.

(U) In your request specific mention is made of an
HTLINGUAL file. MDP/PS reflects OS maintained four official
files under this project--#0077826 (an administrative file),
#0090079, #0093466 (a general file), and #0119144. All of
the HTLINGUAL files were destroyed on 8 April 1994 along
with numerous soft files. Since this material has been
destroyed, OPS cannot definitively state whether these files
contained any information on Lee Harvey Oswald. A search of
Oswald’s name did not produce an index reference to any of
these files.

(U) Attached is all of the available information
regarding the destruction of the HTLINGUAL files. This
information was retrieved from of the
Information. Management Branch/Récords COnEYOl Section and
from a review of general office administrative files.

Question 2: (U) Other than for the 201-289248 file
on Oswald, please explain when each Oswald file was
opened, the purpose for the opening of the file, and
the documents that were in the file at the time of the
assassination.

Response: (U) As noted above, all HTLINGUAL files have
been destroyed. Since OS files are usually set up in
chronological sequence, a search of files with numbers in
close proximity to those recorded for HTLINGUAL was
undertaken. This search revealed the approximate opening
dates for the four official HTLINGUAL files as:

#0077826 Opened approximately July 1952
#0090079 Opened approximately February 1953
#0093466 Opened approximately July 1953
#0119144 Opened approximately May 1955

(U) HTLINGUAL was a Directorate of Operations project
that involved opening incoming and outgoing mail destined to
and from the Soviet Union, (China, Pakistan) and South
America, In OS this project was known as SRPOINTER with
subprojects identified as WESTPOINTER, INDIAN, BANJO, and
SETTER. OS conducted the actual opening and monitoring of
mail with the acquired information referred to the
Directorate of Operations.

(U) The Defectors File (#0341008) was established circa
1950 for the purpose of recording information on US citizens
defecting to other countries and information regarding
foreign nationals considering defection to the United States.
This compilation of information was received from press
clippings, Directorate of Operations reporting, the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, the Department of State, and the
various armed services. The pre-assassination documents.
located in this file relative to Lee Harvey Oswald-are:

a. Washington Star press clipping of 26 November 1959
entitled “U.S. Defector to Reds Turned to Marx at
15”

b. Department of State memorandum dated 25 October
1960 with attached list of American “defectors”

(U) The index reference to the Defectors File
identifies a list dated 13 September 1966 which was known as
the Defector Machine Listing. This listing was a computer
printout of defectors which reflected limited biographic
data on each name. This listing was maintained separately
from the actual Defectors File; notations within the
Defectors File show the Defector Machine Listing as
permanently charged to the Security Analysis Group of OS.
Efforts to locate this listing or determine the disposition
have been unsuccessful.

(U) Information regarding the purpose of the Defectors

File was gleaned from a quick review of selected holdings.

Security Analysis Group and recalls the Defector Machine
Listing. From her recollection, this machine listing was
approximately one and one-half inches thick and was in two
parts. One part consisted of an alphabetical index of
defector names with assigned numbers. The second part
listed the assigned numbers in numerical order and contained
limited information on each name.

The subject file pertaining to Lee Harvey Oswald

(#0351164) was established circa 1960. It appears this file
was created as a separate repository for the numerous press
clippings and reports received from other government
agencies on the defection of Lee Harvey Oswald to the USSR
and his activities following his return to the United

States.

The first volume of this file appears to have been

preserved as the pre-assassination file, and the documents
contained in this file are as follows:

a.

Question 4: (U) To the extent that Counterintelligence
and the Office of Security maintained pre-assassination
files on Oswald, please explain why those offices
maintained files on Oswald prior to the assassination.
In answering this question, please make appropriate
references to the Clandestine Services Handbook (CSHB)
and to any other materials (including organizational... .
charts) that would help explain the jurisdictional and
organization reasons for which CI and OS would have
maintained such files.

Response: (U) It is believed that OS holdings. on. Lee
Harvey Oswald began in 1959 with his travel to.Russia during
which he renounced his US citizenship. Oswald was in
contact with the American Embassy in Moscow, and the
Department of State prepared reports on these contacts.

Most likely because of counterintelligence concerns, the
Central Intelligence Agency was included in the distribution
of these reports. In the beginning this material was
probably retained in the Defectors File. As the number of
documents on this person increased, a separate file was
created to be the repository of information on the alleged
American defector. There is a notation in the Defectors
File that a separate file exists on Oswald.

(U) Both the Defectors File (#0341008) and the file of
Lee Harvey Oswald (#0351164) were handled by Marguerite D.
Stevens of the O0S/Security Research Staff during the pre-
assassination time frame. Of the documents listed above, a
majority of them contain a notation or the initials of
Marguerite D. Stevens, leading one to believe she was the
officer responsible for the collection, analysis, and filing
of this information.

domestic organizations or individuals. SRS conducted
research in connection with employee loyalty cases and
maintained records identifying personalities, environments,
and personal traits of individuals who had been of
counterintelligence interest over the years. SRS maintained
liaison with various government agencies in connection with
counterintelligence activities and coordinated the
counterintelligence effort throughout OS. Using
organizational charts of this time period, SRS reported
directly to the office of the, Director of Security.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

FROM:  Janét_A._Ecklund/
Chief, Information Management Branch
Office of Personnel Security

SUBJECT: OSWALD, LEE HARVEY
AIN: 0351164

1. The Office of Personnel Security was tasked on 31
January 1997 by the Historical Review Group/Center for the Study
of Intelligence (HRG/CSI), via the Directorate of
Administration/Information Review Office, with researching pre-
assassination files on Lee Harvey Oswald. The tasking was.
generated by the John F. Kennedy Board’s desire to review and
declassify relevant material. The results of this review were
forwarded to the HRG/CSI'on 27 February 1997.

2. During the Information Management Branch’s
(IMB)research in response to the. above tasking it was noted that
Volume V of the Oswald files was not on the shelf where Volumes
I-IV and VI-VII were located. A search of the entire area where
the volumes had been maintained failed to locate Volume V. The
IMB Files Section was subsequently charged with conducting an
all out search for the missing volume. The search failed to find
Volume V.

3. In July 1997, the Oswald files were reviewed page by
page prior to being turned over to HRG/CSI and another attempt
was Thade to locate Volume V or to locate persons who might know
what happened to it. Volume V was not located nor were any
persons located who were knowledgeable of its status.

4. During the complete review of the Oswald files no

“time gap was apparent and no one was located who could recall

ever seeing Volume V. This would suggest that either Volume V
had been consolidated into other volumes or that Volume V never
existed, but that a numbering error resulted in what should have
been Volume V being labeled as Volume VI. The use of Roman
numerals on the cover of the volumes might have caused this
error to occur. i

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

1. Pursuant to ARRB “Request No. CIA-16,the Office of
Personnel Security conducted research for and existing pre-
assassination files on Lee Harvey Oswald. The following
responses are provided to those questions which pertain. to
the Office of Personnel Security (OPS). These responses are
the best reasonable answers based on avaijable information.
Please note OPS was known as the Office of Security prior to
1 October 1994.

Question 1: Please identify, as specifically as
possible, each file held by CIA on Oswald at the time
of the assassination of President Kennedy.

Response: At the time of the assassination, the Office

on Lee Harvey Oswald. One file entitled “Defectors File”
(#0341008), contained a reference to Lee Harvey Oswald, and
the second file was Office of Security subject file on Lee
Harvey Oswald (#0351164). This information was reflected in
the automated security database known as the Management Data
Program/Personnel Security (MDP/PS).- These files were
originally miscellaneous files which were converted to the
above numbers circa 1964. A hand search was also conducted
of microfiche records which were superseded by the automated
system. This hand search produced the same results as the
automated search of MDP/PS.

2. Within the ARRB request is specific mention of an
HTLINGUAL file. MDP/PS reflects OS maintained four official
files under this project--#0077826 (an administrative file),
#0090079, #0093466 (a general file), and #0119144. All of
the HTLINGUAL files were destroyed on 8 April 1994 along
with numerous soft files. Since this material has been
destroyed, OPS cannot definitively state whether these files
contained any information on Lee Harvey Oswald. The search
of Oswald’s name did not produce an index reference to any
of these files. Attached is all of the available
information regarding the destruction of the HTLINGUAL
files. This information was retrieved from the Information
Management Branch/Records Control Section and from a review
of general office administrative files.

Oswald, please explain when each Oswald file was opened, the
purpose for the opening of the file, and the documents that
were in the file at the time of the assassination.

Response: As noted above, all HTLINGUAL files have been
destroyed. Since OS files are usually set up in
chronological sequence, a search of files with numbers in
close proximity to those recorded for HTLINGUAL was
undertaken. This search revealed the approximate opening
dates for the four official HTLINGUAL files as:

#0077826 Opened approximately July 1952
#0090079 Opened approximately February 1953
#0093466 Opened approximately July 1953
#0119144 Opened approximately May 1955

Re: _ Status of CIA Responses to Assassination Records Review Board's Requests for
Additional Information and Records

Dear John:

Iam writing to follow-up on our telephone call earlier today and to convey my serious
concern about the status of CIA‘s responses to the Review Board’s requests for
additional information and records. Although CIA has completed its responses to
several requests, and many others have been answered in part, a significant number of
requests have not been answered — including some that were made more than two
years ago. On many occasions we have been assured that responses would be
forthcoming, only to have promised dates come and go without answers. It is now
extremely important that these requests be answered promptly so that we may conduct -
a proper follow-up if necessary. The issues that we can now identify as being of the
highest priority are identified in the text below by double asterisks (**)' and we request
that they be answered within the next month. We request that the remaining requests
be answered by April-1, 1998.

The remainder of this letter is divided into two parts: first, a listing of the formal
requests for information and records, and second, a listing of the informal requests for
information and records. Please let me know if your understanding of any of the
following points differs from ours so that we can resolve any potential discrepancies.

‘As identified more fully below, the issues are: CLA-1 Organizational Material,
CIA-6 Cables and Dispatches, CIA-13 Backchannel Communications, CIA-IR-03
HTLINGUAL Documents, CIA-IR-04 Disposition of Angleton Files, CLA-IR-07 Claude
Barnes Capehart, CIA-IR-15 Electronic “take” from Mexico City, CLA-IR-21 DRE
Monthly Operational Reports, CIA-IR-22 “A” Files on Clay Shaw and Jim Garrison.

“*CIA-IR-22 “A” File on Clay Shaw and Jim Garrison.

In July 1997, the ARRB staff-was shown an “A” file on Clay Shaw which pre-
dated a 201 file. We were also told that an “A” file on Jim Garrison also existed.
The Shaw file was declared to be an assassination record and it was our
understanding that both files were to be sent to HRG for processing. We have
not yet received confirmation from HRG that the files are in process as
assassination records.

CIA-IR-23 Watch Committee Files.

In his memoirs, George Ball reports that upon first hearing of the shots in Dallas
he called DCI John McCone and asked him to activate the Watch Committee.
McCone replied that he already had. The Review Board requests the files of the
Watch Committee for the period January 1963-May 1964.

GIASIR-24 Defector File.

The ARRB staff has identified documents on Lee Harvey Oswald from the Office
of Security’s “Defector File.” It is our understanding that these documents are
now being processed as assassination records. No further tasking on this subject
is anticipated.

CIAIR-25 Zapruder Film.

The Board has requested any and all records, not previously located in the
Sequestered Collection, on any handling by the CIA of the Zapruder film. In
particular, we are interested in any records of NPIC’s handling of the Zapruder
film or copies of the Zapruder film in November and December 1963. Any log
books or indexes which would indicate the individuals involved in the

Re: Request for Additional Information and Records
No. CIA-16 (Oswald Pre-Assassination Files)
No. CIA-IR-24 (Defector File)

This is in response to the ARRB's referent request for
pre-Assassination files this Agency may have had on Lee
Harvey Oswald. It is believed that the following comments
and two enclosed documents respond fully to your request.

1. At'Tab A is a 22 December 1997 memorandum
containing information from the Agency's Office of Personnel
Security which provides details about the files it had on
Oswald prior to the assassination plus when and why they
were created. These include the Office of Security file on
Oswald, a general file on -Americans who had defected to
another country and information about HTLINGUAL files.

2. Also enclosed at Tab B is a 27 October 1977
memorandum from the Office of Personal Security which
explains the numbering of that Office's file on Oswald. In
particular, it explains why the “missing” volume V may never
have existed.

3. An ARRB staff member has reviewed the Oswald
Security file and the file on American defectors.

4. The Oswald Office of Personnel Security file and
those pages of the defector file deemed relevant by the ARRB
staff member have been forwarded to Historical Review, Group
for review and will be processed according to current JFK
release guidelines.

If you have any questions about this response, please

advise.

Sincerely,

J. Barry Harrelson
