Author of Anonymous Letter

1. Recently the attached anonymous letter was received

- by the Deputy Director, Mr. HELMS. Unfortunately the envelope,

which presumably the letter was delivered in was destroyed or

Jost.

Mr. HELMS' secretary who has had occasion to observe

other such guestionable correspondence directed to Mr. HELMS

in the past, thought it a matter for the Office of Security to investi-

gate and if possible through specialized personnel of the Technical

Services Division, attempt to analyse the handwriting as a means

of possibly identifying the author.

2. This suggestion is of course quite valid, consequently

after conducting certain research and discussing the matter with

the Special Activities Staff/Office of Personnel, two "Surplus

Employees* (701's) were considerad as possibilities as the author

of the aforementioned anonymous letter.

3. However, in all fairness it is to be emphasized that

such tentative consideration is at this time based on purely cir-

cumstantial and coincidental factors--namely in the first instance

that one individual was, according to the Special Activities Staff,

an applicant for the Peace Corps about a year ago, and in the

second instance that the other individual had in August 1964 used

the name identifying title as that appearing on the bottom of the

attachment.

4. Those employees referred to are a Mr. Herman

Edward Klisat who was released 20 September 196z after his

services were declared no longer required and a Gaza Andrew OS

KATONA who was terminated on 12 July 1962 for the same

TeaSOn.

5. In seeking the assistance of your office, you will

also find attached in individually named envelopes available

handwriting specimens of Mr. KIMSEY and Mr. (KATONA,

• It

would be appreciated if these persons handwriting would be ?3

compared with the handwritten notation addressed to Mr. HELMS.

It is of course realised that such an analyais based on the little

comparative material available will prove to be difficult but your

efforta and evaluations will be appreciated.

6. Since the attached handwriting specimens are origi-

nals from Security and Personnel files, we would appreciate upon

completion of your need for them that they be returned to this

Office.
