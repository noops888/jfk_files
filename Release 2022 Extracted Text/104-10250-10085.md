SUBJECT : Unknown Subject

Author of Anonymous Letter

1. Recently the attached anonymous letter was received

by: the Deputy Director; Mr. HELMS.- Unfortunately the envelope,- ss

which presumably the letter was delivered in waa destroyed or
lost. Mr. HELMS' secretary who has had occasion to observe
other such questionable correspondence directed to Mr. HELMS

in the past, thought it a matter for the Office of Security to investi-
gate and if possible through specialized personnel of the Technical
Services Division, attempt to analyse the handwriting as a means
of possibly identifying the author.

2. This suggestion is of course quite valid, consequently
after conducting certain research and discussing the matter with
the Special Activities Stafi/Office of Personnel, two "Surplus
Employeesâ€™ (701's) were considered as possibilities as the author
of the aforementioned anonymous letter.

3. However, in all fairness it is to be emphasized that
such tentative consideration is at this time based on purely cir-
cumstantial and coincidental factors--namely in the first instance
that one individual was, according to the Special Activities Staff,
an applicant for the Peace Corps about a year ago, and in the
second instance that the other individual had in August 1964 used
the same identifying title as that appearing on the bottom of the
attachment.
