5F T8 advised that he did not believe that VERA ORLOFF
was a member of the CP or particularly sympathetic to Communism or
that she was particularly interested in any form of government. He
observed that he believed that she associated with Russian groups
because of her parents! association with these organizations and that
they had developed friends among the Russian people in the San Francisco
area mainly because of their common background. | He observed that
VERA ORLOFF'S parents were both born in Russia and that her parents
enjoyed their association with other Russian people and in speaking
the Russian language.

SF 18 stated that based-upon various conversations
Which he had with VERA ORLOFF'S father, he had concluded that her
father was pro-Commnist. . He was unable to recall the exact state~
ments of JOHN ORLOFF, but advised that JOHN ORLOFF was continually
upholding Commnism and the Soviet form of government. He advised
that he had never seen a CP membership card in the possession of JOHN
ORLOFF .

One of the principal reasons for VERA ORLOFF'S divorce
from FREDERICK WILLIAM ONICK, according to SF T-8, was the great influence
over her by her parents. He explained that VERA ORLOFF was married to
ONICK for five or six months; that ONICK was a veteran of World war ITs
that ONICK continued his National Service Life Insurance with ONICK'S
parents listed as beneficiaries. ONICK had planned to have his berefi~
ciaries changed, but VERA ONICK!S father made an issue over the matter
and had given ONICK a definite period of time in which to change the
beneficiaries, SF T~8 advised that ONICK resented this attitude by
his father~in-law and refused to change the beneficiaries at that time.
JOHN ORLOFF thereupon instructed VERA ONICK to leave ONICK, which she
did, and she shortly thereafter instituted proceedings for divorce,

SF T8 advised that there were probably other differences between VERA
ONICK and her husband which might have caused them to separate but he

expressed the feeling that if VERA ONICK had defied her father on that
matter, there would have been no divorce.

Hee He advised that the ONICKS had a daughter, born December ly
