SF T-8 advised that he did not believe that VERA ORLOFF

was a member of the CP or particularly sympathetic to Communism or

that she was particularly interested in any form of government. He

observed that he believed that she associated with Russian groups

because of her parents' association with these organizations and that

they had developed friends among the Russian people in the San francisco

area mainly because of their common background.

He observed that

VERA ORLOFT'S parents were both born in Russia and that her parents

enjoyed their association with other Russian people and in speaking

the Russian language.

he was unable to recall the exact state-

ments of JOHN ORLOFT, but advised that JOHN ORLOFF was continually

upholding Communism and the Soviet form of government. He advised

that he had never seen a CP membership card in the possession of JOHN

ORLOFF.

One of the principal reasons for VERA ORLOFF'S divorce

from FREDERICK WILLIAM ONICK, according to SF T-8, was the great influence

over her by her parents. He

explained that VERA ORLOFF was married to

ONICK for five or six months; that ONICK was a veteran of World War IT;

that ONICK continued his National Service Life Insurance with ONICK'S

parents listed as beneficlaries.

ONICK had planned to have his berefi-

claries changed, but VERA ONICK'S father made an issue over the matter

and had given ONICK a definite period of time in which to change the

beneficiaries.

SF I-8 advised that ONICK resented this attitude by

his father-in-law and refused to change the beneficiaries at that time.

JOHN ORLOFT thereupon instructed VERA ONICK to leave ONICK, which she

did, and she shortly thereafter instituted proceedings for

divorce.

SF T-8 advised that there were probably other differences between VERA

ONICK and her husband which might have caused them to separate but he

expressed the feeling that if VERA ONICK had defied her father on that

matter, there would have been no divorce.
