DirNSAGMS]] (Mr Lear)

Dear Jim

‘I am forwarding a letter from a former Security Service member to you.
It was furnished to us by the recipient, through his commander, at one
of our subordinate units. (e)

(After realizing the implications, true or otherwise,]|we immediately
notified our unit commander to turn it over to the OSI in Florida,
believing they would contact the Federal Bureau of Investigation,
since the writer is a civilian now.

Yesterday, this office was contacted by an OSI agent at Lowry AFB, CO;
this agent happens to be an ex-Security Service man. He was instructed
by his headquarters to interview the writer of the letter to determine
the names of other individuals he had tontacted. Apparently Mr. Christen-
sen has a long history of alcoholism, family problems and now wants to
see a "cleared psychiatrist" as he attributes all of his problems from
Oct 1963, per the OSI agent. In addition, he has indicated to the OSI
that he now fears for his life.

1 am furnishing this to you as I feel the implication in the letter
should best be handled at the national level and that you are in the
best position to contact the Bureau. I have no knowledge that OSI has
not done this, but in view of the fact the subject was interviewed as

‘ 7 a civilian by an AF agent, rather than an FBI agent, leads me to doubt
r this. In addition, you are in a much better position to determine where
caer the nearest psychiatrist, with access, is located. For your information,
ge 2 we placed the classification markings on the letter.
z& é We were told by Mr. Coombs, the OSI agent at OSI District 14, that the
£29 doctor to contact at the VA hospital in Cheyenne, WY is a Dr Sedel,

commercial telephone number 778-7550, extension 273.

Nick,

Well after 13 1/2 years I finally found out your whereabouts, Dam, its
been a long time since(Kirknewton, Scotland] and the beer we drank on the €]
beach and the club. Had to get your address from the outfit in Texas.

: Nick, whatever happened to Sgt Prater? If you know his whereabouts please
send me his address. How in the hell have you been doing?

Nick, I had a nervous breakdown. Plus in 74 my leg shattered in over a
hundred places. Things have really gone to hell for me. I'm working with
the vets benefits counseler, who is a ex 203. Speaking of 203's where the hell
is Frenchy? You know the little guy. What I’m going to say is no longer
classified, so don't get all shit shook. I've done checked it out.

Christ, you remember the position I worked at, in Sgt Praters section, don't
you? You remember about a month or 6 weeks before I left Scotland, when I picked
up a link mentioning the assassination df President Kennedy. How hard I tried
to get it sent out, and because of that fuckin Forney and Delaughter they wouldn't
send it to NSA. Since I have learned that the man's name, most mentioned was
number 4 in a certain branch of organized crime at fhe time. Was number 2 last
year. I will send you a form for proof of claim. This guy here "the 203" says
I_should be getting a service connected disability for my nerves. The "link was"
you remember. How I got my ass chewed for not dropping the

nk. ive Tearned that this branch of crime often will put out a feeler of
forthcoming things. By sending it as a practice message.(@)}

Chick it really broke me up after Nov. 22, 63. Especially when I had it all
before hand. It was first like the 202's said, Ha. I was nuts when the Russians
first came out with the ITI & B's. Later proved them wrong didn't I. That was
another first for us as I recall. Duane Bruntz from Baker trick put up a good
support of my clain.} I'm sending you this certified so to make sure you get it fel

- As I recall you should be able to B.S. them good enough to help me. I know it
cost me a divorce and every thing from my wife. Christ, you remember Marlene,
don't you? That good looking little 1/2 Indian girl from N. Dak. Nick when
you get this form send it back to me and I'll let the vets benefits guy to send
it in. Being a M.Sgt 1 think you know how to bull shit pretty good. Also do
you know Sgt Harley and Sgt Willy Hendrickson's address. I guess old Garnett K.
Tatum retired. Wonder what gehto, he is living in, Ha!
