Subject: Background on Mexico Stetion Support Assets
(Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Enbassies)

1, (Unilateral coverage. From the tine the

xico Stetion was opened in
April 1947 \(by Bill Doyle) until arrival of Win Scott as COS in 1956, Charles
Anderson TIT (still in LA/HQ) had developed a support apparatus to aE
exploit leads from the Soviet Enbassy. This unbrella type project (LIFEAT)
consisted of multi line phone taps, three photo sites, a mobile surveillance

team and a mail intercept operation,

a. Fhone taps were placed by! an employee of the telerhone company
Wate ol we Areata,
Who was) handled by David WILSTED (pseudo). The number of lines
oy
ow
tapped was linked by availability of a listening post nearby
(since the taps were not rade in the nain central) and English/
Spanish (Soviet, Polish, Czech, etc) transcribers. Generally
these agents (mostly Mexican or Mexican American) were related

(which the station at that time felt was good security in that

if they telked about shop, they would talk to each other.)

b. Three photo sites were handled by Anderson with the help ’
of Harry Mahoney (retired, living in Chicago) and TDY TSD
people checking the best type of camera, film, and concealment
devices. These hed sub-cripts under LIFEAT (LIMITED, LILYRIc,
and LICALIA), LIMITED was a fixed site oang opposite across

the street from the front gate of the Soviet Enbassy which had

both a vehicle and foot entrance. The Soviet gate was on the

Northlest corner.of their compound and L’

that block. LINIT©D was the first bese and it operated strictly on an

rinestel basis in the early stages, I think the ifexi Station bought
one storey
this property (2/Sranish Colonial stone house) through LIMOUSIIE (check to

be sure), Later this house began to fall apart. Tais base was closed when
the Station got word thet the photo of "uniden man" vas being released to the
public by the Warren Coamission, The photo operators vere moved to another apt
nearby. The property was sold (under an operational agreement with LIMOUSINE
for a long term lease on the top floor of a new apartment blding to be built
on this site), " LILYRIC was planned as an alternate photo base to LIMITED.

It was in an upper storey (3rd floor check) on the sane side of the street

as LIMITED but in the middle of the block South. It had a slanted view of

the front gate of the Soviet Esbassy, The agents in LIMITED and LILYRIC (both
Mexican fanilies) as far as we knew, were not acquainted with each other.
LILYRIC was a rented apartzent, LICALLA, the third photo site, was located

in one of a’row of four houses on the South side of the Soviet Exbassy compound
which the Mexico Station purchased in about 1958 (check date), also using
LIMOUSINE as the purchaser (check). This site overlooked the back garden of
the Soviet Enbassy compound. The purpose of this operetion wes to get good
identification photographs of the Soviet personnel (vho at thet time vere largely
unidentified in Mexico Station récords). The three photo sites vere handled by
Renon Alvarez\(iexican citizen of U.S. nother.vho taught elecestary level at
‘the American School). \Ranon collected the film oplentmintiewmttins from LIMITED
and LILYRIC three times a week. His sister's husbend,)Carlos (Mexican doctor)
developed and printed the film into 8x10 re af print strips. The master plan
was for LICALLA film to ve, processed, taste, i nan from 1957 to 1959: (Harper
“Holt - resigned) could not handle the volume and as the unprocessed film’ began
to accumilate, the inside co (vahoney) became disgusted and took the filn out
for; Ramon's’ brother-in-law to process (probably early 1959). Thus’ Raxon becane

the handler for all three photo heses. A sensitive staff D monitoring operation

vas run out of another che of these houses (erypt for the four houses wes

1, ete), This was hazdled by Glen WIDDEN (outside TSD officer) and

Mahoney using HQ TDY teems for monitoring. This operation vas also separate

from LICALLA, Tre two houses in between were rented to unsusvecting tenants.

©, Hobile surveillance wes developed by Anderson and later placed
under ‘akoney and Joseph Sancho. This teen consisted of a half
dozen or so agents who used three to four late nodel cars end a

panel truck (which could be used on stake_outs for photo covere--e).

The plan was to activate this group by radio (fron LIKITED 34Sz)
when soneone of interest left ae gate and stay with then
until they nade their meetings. ‘These agents knew ebout the LEITED
BASE tegause they had LDWTED photos for identification purposes.
This worked fairly well until about the middle of 1958 (check date)
When one of the surveillance egents got too close to his target and

was arrested by the Mexican transit police and turned over to the

Mexican Secret Service, By the time the Stetion could arrange through

a cleared attorney to bail hin out (Judd Austin of the Goodrich; )

Little and Riquelme firm), the agent. had identified Sancho (vho ves

evacuated across the border at Nogales by Bob Shaw) and the inside——

phone nunber of Mshoney (ho vas subsequently replaced by Louis
Puckett). As a result of this flap, the LIFFAT project was broken
up into several others. The agents vere not changed but vere given

of the Mexican services at thet tine. (The Mexican DFS (Direction of Federal
Security) with which ve dealt vas s hip pocket group run out of the Ministry

Of Government. This Ministry spent a major part of its time on control of }

During 1958, Win Scott met socially some ofthe

Miexican President elect, Adolfo Lopez Kateos? During this period, the U.S.

Ambassador Robert C. Hill (reflecting the policy of then Sec State J.F, Dulles)
was energetic in orgenizing groups to "fight communism”, One of these seeds *
grew into a proposal ‘Miguel Alewan (jr. son of forner Hexi President), acting ’

3. My menory is a little vague about the origins of the Cuban Exbassy but I
think the staff first developed from a pro-Castro group celebrating on New
Years eve 1959. As I recall, it vas a nakeshift arrangenent of volunteers

through most of 1960 and 61 with Tom Hazlitt producing voluminous reports on

their activities end recruitirg agents right end left auong Cuban netionals in
