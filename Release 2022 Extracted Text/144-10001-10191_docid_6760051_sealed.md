CUBAN AGENT ACTIVITY IN THE WESTERN ‘HEMISPHERE 1959-31 DECEMBER 1974

Cuba used agents for intelligence_and subversion in North, Central,
and South America; Africa; and Asia.

In the Western Hemisphere during the early sixties, diplomatic
cover became less available to the ‘Cubans, and by spring of 1962,
Cuba had diplomatic redations with ‘only one-third of the Latin American
countries. Cuba's interest in foménting discord and promoting revolu-
tion obviously grew as she became more isolated officially from the
rest of the hemispheré, and the Cukan General Directorate of Intelli-
gence (DGI) inevitably increased its reliance on illegal/clandestine
agents. By the time Of the Cuban ‘missile crisis" in October 1962,
Cuba was known to be

By the end of 1964, Cuba enjoyed formal relations in the hemisphere
with only Canada, Mexico, Jamaica, ‘and the United Nations in New York.

A primary target for penetration was ALPHA 66, a Florida-based
exile organization reputed to have near-legendary powers and resources.

The Cuban government still claims U.S. government direction and funding «

of the organization whose claimed activities included night raids
along the Cuban coast, infiltration of agents into Cuba, harassment

of the Cuban armed forces, and weapons drops to counter-revolutionary
groups on the island.

ANY MATERIAL RELEVANT TO THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY OR
ANY INVESTIGATION INTO THE ASSASSINATION.

We have reviewed the Cuban materials previously compiled to
respond to SSCI and Church Committee hearings. The only information
regarding the KENNEDY assassination which surfaced might be termed
reactive; that is, it reflects some of the reactions of the Cuban
government to the assassination. Army and Navy elements in Eastern
Cuba were placed on alert status on 22 November, apparently in
reaction to news of the President's:death. This action was probably
a reflection of the Cuban government's paranoia over a possible
military action against Cuba, possibly originating from the U. S.
Navy Base at Guantanamo. That the Cubans were sensitive to suggestions
that they might be implicated in the KENNEDY assassination is very
evident in the following 25 November press release from the Cuban
Foreign Ministry:

"With relation to the information published today ((25 November) )
in the newspaper EXCELSIOR in Mexico City, affirming that
LEE HARVEY OSWALD had requested a transit visa for travel to the
Soviet Union at the Cuban Consulate in Mexico in September, the Cuban
Government requested information from the officials of our Consulate
in that city confirming that it is certain that Mr. LEE HARVEY OSWALD
requested the transit visa for travel to the Soviet Union on
27 September in the said consulate.

"On being informed by the consular officials that their office
could not grant such a visa without the authorization of the Cuban
Ministry of Foreign Relations, which likewise would not grant it if
it was not previously authorized by the country of destination,

Mr. Oswald left the Consulate visibly disgusted.

"The said visa was never granted.

“This detail, in connection with the other circumstances that
surrounds the facts, confirm our suspicion that the assassination of
KENNEDY was a provocation against world peace, perfectly and thoroughly
planned by the most reactionary sectors of the United States.

"It is evident that these sectors planned beforehand to involve
Cuba and the Soviet Union in these deeds.

“The inconceivable and inexplicable impunity with which an
individual of known penal antecedents assassinated OSWALD, the
principal accused of the assassination of President KENNEDY, in
the presence of the police themselves and in the basement of a
prison, demonstrates in a scandalous and indisputable manner that
the powerful reactionary political forces within the United States
are making use of all their resources and influences in order to
conceal those who master-minded KENNEDY's assassination, and the
true motives for it.

"World public opinion demands the enlightening of the deeds.
It is absurd that the political authorities and the prosecuting
attorney of Dallas have declared that the case is closed when hardly
48 hours have passed since a deed of so great a result as the
assassination of the President of the United States."
