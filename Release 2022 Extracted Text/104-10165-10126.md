CITATION
CAPTAIN LUCIEN E CONEIN, 62300769, infertry, Ammyp-of-ttre-Unived-Stavee~te~awrrded

the-Bnonee-cheemovt? for meritorious service during the period 1 August 1945 to

the cessation of hostilities on 15 August 1945, when he conmanded a commando :
ean cotiposed of iuerican, Prench and Chinese:personnel with the mission of ;
gathering intelligence aud harassing the enemy in French Indo-China. Captain :

Cooein was responsible for the selecting, training and organizing of thisteam

as well as the plaming cf the attacks on Japanese headquarters and garrisons,

of French Indo China, and the successful execution of the mission, Captain ;

Conein in planning the mission made, sevea days pricr to the operation, a

reconnaissance of the route to be taken by his team through territory heavily

covered:b; Japanese patrois su¢ garrisons. The intelligence which he gathered

on this reconnaissance was of inestimable value to the success of the mission

and in the minimizing of casualities in his forces. when he was threatened by
attack from Japanese forces and advised to abandon this area by local military

camanders, he chose to remain end defend his position against advancing colums,
of: Japanese cooming fron the north and west. His achievements reflect grest
¢redit. upon himself and.the Armed Forces of the United States.
