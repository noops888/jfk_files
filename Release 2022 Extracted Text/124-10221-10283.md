writing and painting, She said he told her he
was a physigian and owned a clinic in Miami,
Florida, Re

‘His son, ORLANDO, 15, of Miami, visited him

in Chile for about 20.days in October 1975, she

said, She said BOSCH left Chile for about five days :

around the middle of last, year, but she did not
say where he went,

"Referring to BOSCH's reasons for being in
Chile, she said: ‘He told me that he was here in Chile
because, I don't know, it was more peaceful, because
he liked it . . .« I uyderstood that he didntttwant to
talk about that.’ 753)

"She said she did not know of any contacts other
than casual ones that he might have had with: Chileans,
tand I prefer, not to know at this time.' XW)

"She emphasized: *He is a very correct person who
loves his fatherland very much--that is his only defect

“BOSCH was. detained in Venezuela for questioning
about the explosion of a Cuban airliner that killed 73
persons two weeks ago. Sal \

"The Washington Post said Thursday that he was expelled
from Costa Rica in May for using a, false Chilean passer iy

Obviously DELGADO would- have “valuable information concernil
Cuban exile contacts who visited BOSCH in Santiago during the year
he resided in that city. When photographs of all known Cuban exile
members in the continental United States and Puerto Rico knowa to
have visitéd BOSCH in Chile are received by Legat, Buenos Aires,
arrangements will be made for an in-depth interview with DELGADO
during which the photographs will be displayed in an effort ‘to

The attention 4 d interested offices is
invited to Section XXVI ch contains a partial

text of a report dated prepared by the Ad Hoc Working
Group on situations of human rights in Chile, United Nations

General Assembly, This report contained information concerning
DINA, which in some instances is obviously incorrect and based

on rumors and heresay. For example, Page 296 of rerep indicates

that DINA Headquarters and office of DINA Director was located

on Marcoleta Street in Santiago at the former offices of the

Chilean Communist Youth, As previously reported, DINA Headquarters
and the DINA Director's Office are located at \ll Calle Belgrado,.
This fact is well known in Santiago and probably any taxi driver

in Santiago would be able to take a passenger to DINA Headquarters
on request, From the nature ofinformation contained in this

report, it appears that the Ad Hoc Working Group compiled information
volunteered by various Chilean dissidents concerning DINA operations
in Chile. Nonetheless, an extremely intoresting piece of informa-
tion is contained. on Page 300 of rerep, which identifies various
DINA premises in Santiago. One of the locations identified as a
DINA situs is listed in Paragraph (D) as an apartment in the San
Borja Housing Project. As noted in the above Associated Press
dispatch, BOSCH AVILA resided with his Chilean mistress at the

San Borja Towers Housing Development. (wv)

It would be extremely significant if it could be established
with any degree of certainty that BOSCH’?s apartment, was in fact
a location utilized by DINA, Accordingly, it is suggested that WFO
or the New York Office give consideration to ascertaining from
the Ad Hoc Committee Working Group whether the exact location of
the alleged DINA apartment in the San Borja Housing Project can be
identified and if possible the source, who identified the apartment
as a DINA location be located and interviewed. Gs)

Oe show e noted that[the CIA Station in Santiago|adviset

that invéstigatio: sclosed the exact address of BOSCH AVI. and
his Chilean mistr@$s‘s apartment as Building #1, Apartment #24,
Torres de San Borja, Alameda, Santiago, Chile. (ox) i|
