18 October 1961

1. The following report has been received by CAS, Washington from
CAS, Saigon:

"a/ Dr. Tran Kim Tuyen raised the issues stated in_TDCS-3/490,238.
(18 October 1961) himself with CAS representative and made a

very strong pleaj:that it be handled discreetly but to determine
what action could be undertaken. As alternative proposal to
sending Ngo Dinh’ Nhu to talk with President Kennedy and bring
“back gospel, Dr. Tuyen suggested that General Lansdale in
capacity ‘of former old friend suggest to President Diem the
desired measures,’ especially the delegation of authority in a
friendly but firm heart-to-heart talk. ‘Dr. Tuyen expressly

' stated that President Diem would not take such advice from

' ‘Ambassador, and cited the example of the serious breach
; :

between Ambassador Durbrow and President Diem which was
occasioned by the former's blunt, insistence on the need for
govermnent reforms. -Dr. Tuyen yen Also ruled out any such récam-
! mendations by General Taylor as’-inappropriate and unacceptable
. to President Diem. sates a said that only the Presidential ~
level should be used.. (sic : :

"B. Anbecsador and political counselor briefed immediately
following the:conversation on. the above as well as the inform-
ation in TDCS-3/490, 238.

"C, In view of TDCS-3/490,238 and the close link of political.
viewpoint of Dr..Tuyen and Col. Nguyen Van Chau, believe both
may be singing different versions ofthe same tune. Will try
to find out how President Diem's declaration of national *

- emergency of 18 October, and particularly the means of imple-
mentation, affect both." .

NOT COUNT ON ANY GUARANTEES OF CIVIL LIBERTIES AND ARE AT MERCY
OF SECURITY ORGANS OF. THE REGIME,

( - ,
WITH REGARD TO REFURBISHING GVN IMAGE THROUGH. BROADENING OF
GOVERNMENT, ETC; NO CONCRETE ACTIONS HAVE BEEN TAKEN, RUMORS
PERSIST THAT DIEM WILL ANNOUNCE CABINET CHANGES AND REALIGNMENT
CERTAIN GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONS, HOWEVER, SHOULD THIS OCCUR. IT
LIKELY TO BE MERE. WINDOW DRESSING SINCE MOST UNLIKELY. DIEM NOW
CONTEMPLATES ANY ACTION WHICH MIGHT UNDERMINE POWER POSITION
AND SOLIDARITY OF NGO FAMILY, WHILE WE CANNOT DISCOUNT POSSIBILITY
OF CABINET SHUFFLE FOR OPTICAL PURPOSES, WE SEE NO SIGNS THAT
ANY REDUCTION OF INFLUENCE OF THE NHU'S IS IN THE OFF ING,
IN FACT, HARASSMENT OF AMERICANS BOTH THROUGH NEWSPAPER ATTACKS,
ARRESTS .OF EMBASSY AND USOM LOCAL EMPLOYEES, AND GENERAL
FREEZE ON NORMAL CONTACTS BETWEEN AMERICANS AND THEIR VIETNAMESE
COUNTERPARTS WOULD INDICATE THAT FAMILY STILL BELIEVES IT
HAS STRONG CARDS TO PLAY,

AT THIS JUNCTURE LITTLE PROSPECT FOR PUBLIC AND OFFICIAL
STATEMENT BY DIEM BEFORE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY SETTING NEW TONE FOR
GOVERNMENT, .DIEM?S SPEECH ON OCTOBER 7 CHARACTERIZED BY AMB|GUOUS
POSITION TOWARD US, A CALL FOR SELF-SUFFICIENCY WITH XENOPHOBIC
OVERTONES, A CATALOGUE OF NATIONAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS, AND AN
EFFORT.TO BLAME NEGATIVE. FACTORS ON COMMUNISTS AND OTHER ,
MACHINATIONS FROM OUTSIDE. SVN,

6. US/GVN RELATIONS: NO RPT NO GENERAL IMPROVEMENT HAS BEEN
NOTED IN GVN CAMPAIGN OF DIVISIVE PRESS ATTACKS ON CIA, USIS,
EMBASSY, ETC, RECENT TREND 1S TO PLACE: BLAME ON ‘US GOVERNMENT.
RATHER THAN SINGLING OUT SPECIFIC AGENCIES, .WHILE. CAMPAIGN
WAXES AND WANES, MAJOR THRUST IS STILL ONE OF CONFRONTATION
WITH US POLICY AS GVN WISHES TO INTERPRET IT,

GVN. APPEARS TO HAVE FOCUSED ON PARAGRAPH IN WHITE HOUSE

STATEMENT OF OCTOBER 3 ON SERIOUSNESS OF POLITICAL SITUATION

AS INDICATION US WILL CONTINUE APPLY PRESSURE FOR POLITICAL

CHANGES WHICH THEY NOT PREPARED GRANT, WE BELIEVE US PROGRAM

OF PRESSURES HAVE PUT DIEM/NHU OFFeBALANCE AND THEY ATTEMPTING

ASSESS STRENGTH OF US RESOLVE; HOWEVER TOO EARLY JUDGE ULTIMATE
