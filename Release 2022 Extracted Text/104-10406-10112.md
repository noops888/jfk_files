Mexico Station Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Embassies (1963)

:.:

1. (Unilateral Coverage:

From the time the Mexico Station was opened in April 1947) until

the arrival of Mr. Win Scott as Chief of Station in(1955, the Station had

developed a support apparatus to exploit leads from the Soviet Embassy in

Mexico City. This umbrella type project (LIPSTICK

cons

isted of multiline

phone taps, three photographic sites, a mobie

ferveillance team and a

mail intercept operation.

Telephone taps (LIFEAT)

e placed by lan employee of the local

(telephone company whor

landled by a Station case officer. The number

of lines tapped was yinited only by the availability of a listening post

nearby and the availability of langauge (English, Spanish, Soviet, Polish,

Czech, etc.) transcribers. Generally, these were Mexican or Mexican-

American recruited agents.

Three photographic sites were handled by a Station case officer

:

assisted by technicians on TDY from Headquarters who advised the Station

on the best types of cameras, films, and concealment devices. These

operations had sub-crypts under project LIPSTICK (namely: LIMITED, LILYRIC

and LICALLA). LIMITED was a fixed site directly opposite the Soviet Em-

bassy (across the street) which had both a vehicle and a pedestrian en-

trance.

The gate to the Soviet Embassy was on the northwest corner of the

Soviet compound and the LIMITED site was diagonally across a double laned

street on the southeast corner of' that block. (See attached diagram).

LIMITED was the first photo base and operated strictly on an experimental

basis in the early stages. This base, however, was closed when the Sta-

tion received word that the photograph of the "unidentified man" was

being released by the Warren Commission. LILYRIC was an alternate photo-

graphic base.

It was located in an upper story of an apartment building

on the same side of the street as the LIMITED site bu

the middle of

gate of

the Soviet

the block south. It had a planted view of the

Embassy. LICALLA, the third photograph

was located in one of a

row of four houses on the south

Of the Soviet Embassy compound.

This site overlooked

the

den of the Soviet Embassy compound. The

purpose of this opera

was to get good identification photographs of

Soviet personnel. The three photographic sites were managed by a re-

cruited agent who was a Mexican citizen, the son of an American mother

and Mexican father (deceased). This agent collected the film from the

LIMITED and LILYRIC sites three times a week. The film was then de-

veloped and printed into 8 x 10 contact print strips. LICALLA film was

originally processed in the Station but in early 1959, due to the resig-

nation of a technician, this film like that of LIMITED and LILYRIC was

processed on the outside by a recruited agent.

Mobile surveillance was conducted by two American staff officers.

These two officers organized a surveillance team of six recruited agents

which used late model cars and a panel truck for surveillance. The team

could be activated by radio from the LIMITED site whenever someone of

interest left the gate of the Soviet Embassy. These agents were aware of

the LIMITED site since they had been issued LIMITED photographs for

identification purposes.

The Station also conducted a unilateral) ma

itercept operation,

of Federal Security (DFS), with which we conducted liaison, was a hip-

was. principally occupied with political investigations and control of

foreigners. Their agents were wished Test, and corrupt. (A Station)

officer trained a number of them in name tracing and travel control.

In

1958, at the instigation of a Mexican official, a joint telephone tap

operation came into existence. The operation, which became known as?

(LIENVOY, was run by a Mexican officer. The listening post had 30 lines

connected at one time. The transcription room was staffed by Mexican

Army officers. In 1961, because of mismanagement by the Mexican prin-

cipals, the Station chief, himself, became the project case officer. A

Station officer assisted him in the daily supervision of the listening

post, and in picking up the transcripts and the tapes. There was also

an American technician inside the listening post.

3. Oswald Coverage:

In mid-1962, (the Mexican officer in charge of LIENVOY (the)

Joint tap operation) asked the American officer at the LIENVOY listening

post for the telephone numbers of the Soviet, Cuban and Satellite Em-

bassies in anticipation of possible coverage the station immediately

disconnected all of the unilateral telen

hone taps on these Embassies so)

(that they would not be disce

when the Mexicans hooked up their

taps. (The Mexicans) sa

ceafter connected five Cuban lines, five

Soviet lines, three

Czech lines, two Polish lines, and one Yugoslav

line. At the listening post, a live monitor made short summaries of

conversations of interest which were then included in a daily resume

for the Chief of Station. Later, when a reel was completely recorded,

full transcripts were typed and passed to the Station; however, there

was usually a time lag of a day or two. Reels which contained Russian

in a language other than Spanish or English were taken to another location

for translation and typing. Mr. Boris Tarasoff did the Russian transla-

tions but because of the volume of Russian conversations, the translations

usually ran about a week behind the date of the conversation.

As soon

as the Station learned that an American identifying him-

self

as Lee Oswald phoned the Soviet Embassy, Miss Ann Goodpasture of the

Station started screening all photographs. However, here

again,

there

was a backlog because the photographs were picked up

a week

but those picked up were usually for dates a fe

Further, photographs were not made

until a complete roll of

film was used. Later this wast

The instructions were to cover the entire work day (office hours) and to

photograph all Soviets, their fanilies, all foreigners, and cars with

foreign license plates. Human error did occur but generally the agents

were conscientious. The Cuban Embassy coverage had more sophisticated

equipment using a pulsé camera which frequently developed mechanical

dif-

ficulties.

Oswald came to the attention of the listening post operators

from a tap of the Soviet line.: It was picked up and taken to Mr. Boris

Background

on Mexico Station Support Assets

(Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Enbassies)

1. (Unsláteral) coverage. From the time the liexico Station was opened (in,

(April 1947 (by Bill Doyle)) until arrival of Win Scott as COS in 1955, Charles

Anderson III (still in LA/H2) had developed a support apparatus to Fe

exoloit leads from the Soviet Embassy. This umbrella type project (LIFEAT)

consisted of multi line phone taps, three photo sites, a mobile surveillance

team and a mail intercept operation.

a. Thone taps were placed by an employee of the telephone company

who was hardled by David WILSTED (pseudo). The nunber of lines

tayped was linted by availability of a Ilstening post nearby

(since the taps were not made in the main cent

and English/

Spanish (Soriet, Polish, Crech, ete) transcribers. Generally

these esents (nose de vesten decen) vote relatad

(which the he

It that time felt was good security in that

if they sailed about shop, they would talk to each other.)

bo. Three photo sites were handled by Anderson with the help

of Harry Mahoney (retired, living in Chicago) and TDY ISD

people checking the best type of carera, film, and concealment

devices. These had sub-cripts under LIFEAT (LINITED, LILYRIC,

and LICALLA). LINITED was a fixed site bang opposite across

the street from the front gate of the Soviet Enbassy which had

both a vehicle and foot entrance. The Soviet gate was on the

Northlest corner of their compound and LINITED was diagonally.

that block. LIIID was the first base aid it cherated

strictly on an

si crimental basis in the esrly stages. : I think the lexi Station bought

one storey

this property (a/Spanish Colorial stone house) through LINOUSIE (check to

be sure). Later this house began to fall apart. This base was closed when

the Station got word that the photo of "uniden man" was being releasea to the

public by the Warren Commission. The photo operators were moved to another apt

nearby. The property was sold (under an operational agreement with LIMOUSIE

for a long term lease. on the top floor of a new apartment biding to be built

on this site). LILYRIC was planned as an alternate photo base to LINITED.

It was in an upper storey (3rd floor -check) on the sare side of the street

as LIMITED but in the middle of the block South. It had a slanted view of

the front gate of the Soviet Erbassy. The agents in LIMITED and LILYRIC (both

Vexican farilies) as far as we knew, were not acquainted with each other.

LILYRIC was a rented apartment. LICALIA, the third photo site, was located

in one of a row of four houses on the South sigeles the Soviet Embassy compound

which the lexico Station purchased in

about 1958 (check date), also using

LOUS IT as the jurongger lorent).

This site overlooked the back garden of

the Soviet Embassy compouna.

The purpose of this operation was to get good

identification photographs of the Soviet personnel (who at thet time were largely

unidentified in Mexico Station records). The three photo sites vere handled by

Ramon Alvarez (ilexican citizen of U.S, mother who taught elecentary level at

the American School). (Ramon collected the film entende

SO from LnITED

and LILYRIC three times a week. His sister's husband, (Carlos (ilexican doctor))

developed and printed the film into 8x10 contact print strips. The master plan

tuit

was for LICALIA film to ve processed inside, ISD man from 1957 to 1959 (Harper)

to accumulate, the inside Co (l'ahoney) becane disgusted and took the film out

for (Ramon 'S) broüher-in-law to crocess (probably early 1959). Thus (Ramon became

by Glen HIDDEN (outside ISD officer) ana

Mahoney using HQ IDY teams for monitoring. This opsration was also separate

from LICALLA. The two houses in between were rented to unsusrecting tenants.

c. Mobile surveillance was developed by. Anderson and later placed

under Mahoney and Joseph Sancho. This team consisted of a half

dozen

or so agents who used three to for late model cars aná a

panel truck (which could be used on stake_outs for photo covera e).

However,

as I recall, the Mexicans connected 5 Cuban lines, 5 Soviet lines,

3 Czech,

2 Polish, and 1 Iugoslav line. The baserouse listening post had a live

nonitor lico made short summaries of interesting conversations for a daily

resume which was

received each day arourd 8 a.". (passed by Flick) to Goodrasture

to get to Scott before 9.a.i.) Later (when the reel was completely recorded)

full transcripts were typed and passed to the station in the same way, however,

there was usually a time lag of a day or so.: Those transcripts which had

Russian or another language besides Spanish or English vent out of the listening

post the day after the transcript (of other conversations on the reel)was

tiped. These reels wore taisen to another Location where they were trenslated

and typed. In the case of the Russian trans.

ations, Boris Tarasoff usually ran

about a week behind the date ani

Russian conversations an

"embers of the Soviet Eubassy. During this

period: (fall of 1963) the reels were probably being brought into the station

and carried to Boris by one of the people from the Soviet Section or they may

have been carried to him by Flick but I think I brought the reel in and gave

it to Herbert lanel) to take to Boris. (Herbert Kanell and his wife Berbara

the photographs as soon as we learned that the man calling hinself Oswald was

probably an American. However, here again there was a backlag because the

for dates a few days pretiously because the doctor processed the film on a

night time basis.

Just after 1600 hours,

the Soviet Consulate received a call from the

Cuban Consulate (Sylvia DURAN) who said she had there a U.S. citizen

who had requested a transit visa to Cuba because he is going to the

USSR. DURAN wants to know with whom he spoke at the Soviet Embassy

because she sent him over to them telling him that if the Soviets

approved the visa then the Cubans would give him one without anything

more, advising the (Department of) Immigration in Cuba. She wants

to know with whom he spoke because he says that he doesn't know

either with what person and who told him that certainly there would

be no problem.

The Soviet asks DURAN to wait a minute.

After a

short wait DURAN explains the same thing to another Soviet.

This

Soviet

tells her to leave her telephone (number) and her name and

someone will return the call.

DURAN gives her name and telephone

number 11-28-47 then says as a personal thing, she has moved and

has not advised them of a change of address

so will not receive their

Bulletin and can give it to them now.

The Soviet asks her to call

KOUKHARENKO in order to change that address and asks for the name

of the (Cuban) Cultural Attache.

DURAN says it is Teresa PROENZA

whose number is 14-13-26.

The Soviet thanks her.

DEPARTMENT OF STATE

THE DIRECTOR OF INTELLIGENCE AND RESEARCH

WASHINGTON

SECRET

OCT 25 1960

Dear Dick:

Our efforts to answer recent informal inquiries, including some

from the White House Staff, have revealed that, though CIA and the

FBI have detailed records

concerning Americans who have been recruited

as intelligence agents by Bloc countries,

there does not appear to be

a complete listing of those Americans now living in Bloc countries

who might be called "defectors".

Using the definitions of DOID 4/2,

these persons might be described as those who have either been

capable of provicing ussful intelligence to the Bloc or those whose

desire to resettle in Bloc countries has been significantly exploited

for communist propaganda purposes.

This would mean that no attention

need be paid to Americans whose resettlement within the Bloc had no

counter-intelligence implications or had attracted no particular

attention; for instance, this definition would not cover individual

US citizens of East European or Chinese origin who returned to the

"homeland" because they had never been completely assimilated into

the American society.

There is attached a list of such persons, covering the last 18

months,

and it would be appreciated if the Agency could verify and

possibly expand this list for the use of interested Bureaus of, the

Department.

Sincerely yours,

Hugh S. Cunning, Jx.
