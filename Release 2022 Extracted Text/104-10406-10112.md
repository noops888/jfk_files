SU"JECT: Telay in sending the first cable about
OSWALD

1. Much has been written about the delay (ly the Mexico H
Station) ins ending the first cable requesting traces on the
name Lee OSWALD. It was discussed in Dave Phillips book asa
case of laziness on the part of the Soviet case officer (which
in my view was unjust and unnecessary and indicates that Dave
didn't know what he was’ talking about).

contra

2. Normally, the Spanish transcript for the 1 October
convers ation would have been picked up on the morning of mye
2nd of October. ‘The Russian language portion would:have.gone
to the Russ ian/English transcriber on the 3rd ober. ‘the
trans lation would have been returned the follawing:day (4th)
at vhich time, the Soviet case officer woyhd haves ked for
the photographic coverage. That coverags rule not have been
in the station before the 7th since thi m was still in the
camera on the 3rd of October and i405 <ked up probably on
the 4th, processed and-passed tation on the next work
day which would have been M ictober.

3. Later the film was \tWken out of the camera every day
but at that time, the film stayed in the camera until a full 8
rotl was completed which might take three or four dys.

4. A name trace could have been requested on the bas is 2
of the name alone but that wasn't the wy Win Scott ran that
Station. He wanted the photographic coverage tied in with the
telephone coverage ..sometimesthere_was..a U.S. automobile
license number. It was also part of the "numbers game" of :
jus tify ing a project ty the number of dis patches, cables or |
Teports produced.

Mexico Station Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Embassies (1963) |

1. (Unilateral) Coverage: :
From the time the Nexico Station was opened inCApriT1947) unti1

the arrival of Mr. Win Scott as Chief of Station in(1955} the Station had
developed a support apparatus to exploit leads from the Soviet Embassy in
Mexico City. This umbrella type project carsTiget sed of. multitine
phone taps, three photographic sites, a ar team and a

mail intercept operation.

4 Telephone taps wag by(an employee of 2e of the Tocal
“+ (teTephone~ company” vi ed by a Station case officer. The number 4
of lines tapped wa! ed only by the availability of a listening post

nearby and the availability of langauge (English, Spanish, Soviet, Polish,

Czech, etc.) transcribers. Generally, these were Mexican or Mexican-

- American recruited agents.

Three photographic sites were handled by a Station case officer

* assisted by technicians on TDY from Headquarters who advised the Station
on the best types of cameras, films, and concealment devices. These
operations had sub-crypts under project LIPSTICK (namely: LIMITED, LILYRiC
and LICALLA). LIMITED was a fixed site directly opposite the Soviet Em-
bassy (across the street) which had both a vehicle and a pedestrian en-

trance. The gate to the Soviet Embassy was ‘on the northwest corner of the

Soviet compound and the LIMITED site was diagonally across a double Taned
street on the southeast corner of’ that block. (See attached diagram).
LIMITED was the first Photo base and operated strictly on an experimental
basis in the early stages. This base, however, was closed when the Sta-
tion received word that the photograph of the “unidentified man" was
being released by ‘the Warren Commission. LILYRIC was an alternate photo-
“ graphic base. It was located in an upper story of an apartment building
on the same side of the street as the LIMITED ae bi Se middle of
the block south. It had a Planted view of t! Spite of the Soviet
Embassy. LICALLA, the third SS ae is located in. one of a
row of four houses on the mae Soviet Embassy compound.
This site overlooked the oe of the Soviet Embassy compound. The
Purpose of this operag was to get good identification photographs of
Soviet personnel. The three Photographic sites were managed by a re-
cruited agent who was a Mexican citizen, the son of an American mother
and Mexican. father (deceased). This agent collected the film from the
LIMITED and LILYRIC sites three times a week. The film was then de-
veloped and printed into 8 x 10 contact print strips. LICALLA film was
originally processed ‘in the Station but in early(1959} due to the resig-
nation of a technician, this film Tike that of LIMITED and LILYRIC was

Processed on the outside by a recruited agent.

Item 295, page 3

At 1626 hours, A Soviet calls from the Soviet Embassy Chancery
to the Cuban Consulate and asks for Sylvia DURAN. He asks

DURAN if the american has been there.

DURAN: Yes, he is still here.

SOVIET: According to the letters that he showed them from the (Soviet)
Consulate in Washington, he wants to go to the USSR to stay
a long time with his wife who is Russian, but also the
answer had not been received (by him) regarding his problem.
That accordingly these transactions take 4 or § months but
without prior approval from the USSR, they have to request
and even then, they could not issue the visa hene: (in Mexico
City) without asking Washington. Yet accordingly ‘this man
(the American), “> showed him a letter inmwhichshe”(the
American) is a member of an organizati¢i
and said that the Cubans could not pive*hinf the visa without
the Russian visa and now the SeMet’ Mpesn't know what to do
with him, because he has £5 ‘the answer from
Washington.

DURAN: ..with them also, be problem with him (the American)

is that he doesnis] ie in Cuba and in that case it
is very she Ne him a visa, because he was

thinking of sing his visa, because he knew it was
going to take siong time waiting for the Russian visa in
Cuba, and then go on to the USSR.

SOVIET: ..that the thing is that if his (the American) wife were

~ now in Washington (and) going to receive the visa right now

or the permission from the USSR to retum to her country, (if)
she is going to receive her visa in Washington, then having
this visa, she can communicate to whatever place, this
permission, for example, here or in any other place (he) can
receive it, but right now they do not have them.

DURAN: ..certainly and neither can (the Cubans) give him a letter
because they do not know if the visa will be approved.

SOVIET: They can-only give the visa according to instructions.

DURAN: Then that is what she will put on his application.

SOVIET: Neither can I give him any letter of recommendation because
I don't. know him and pardon me for bothering you.

DURAN: It was no bother, thank you very much.

Item 74, page 2

An unidentified man (speaking Spanish) calls the Soviet Embassy
Consulate at 1037 hours and asks for the Consul. He is told that
the Consul is not there. The unidentified man asked what is needed
to get visas to go to Odessa. He is told to call back at 1130 hours.

Item 137, page 2

At 1238 hours a man named ALATRISTE (not a Soviet) from inside the
Soviet Enbassy Consulate calls out to number 45-37-72 (Colonial
America, probably a pension or hotel but number not listed in the
telephone directory) and speaks with a man named SAN ROMAN.
ALATRISTE says that he is in the Russian Embassy and they need to
know what day the boat "KALONIA" will arrive in Odessa, that the
Soviets will also need copies of the passenger manifest...

(One concludes that ALATRISTE and SAN ROMAN are shipping-fepresentatives
for the boat "KALONIA", and needed routine visa infomation.¥’First

a call was made to the first listing for the Soyiet Embassy in the
Mexican telephone directory (which turned out=to ‘be the Military Attache).
They got the phone number for the Consulate andthe address. After

making a call to the Consulate and Learning that it would not be open
until 1130 hours, ALATRISTE went.t@the&adtress to get the needed
information.)

.
Just after 1600 hours, ‘the Soviet Consulate received a call from the
Cuban Consulate (Sylvia DURAN) who said she had there a U.S. citizen
who had requested a transit visa to Cuba because he is going to the
USSR. DURAN wants to know with whom he spoke at the Soviet Enbassy
because she sent him over to them telling him that if the Soviets
approved the visa then the Cubans would give him one without anything
more, advising the (Department of) Immigration in Cuba. She wants
to know with whom he spoke because he says that he doesn't know
either with what person and who told him that certainly there would
be no problem. ‘The Soviet asks DURAN to wait a minute. After a
short wait DURAN explains the same thing to another Soviet. ‘This
Soviet tells her to leave her telephone (number) and her name and
someone will Tetum the call. DURAN gives her nane and telephone
number 11-28-47 then says as a personal thing, she has moved and

has not advised them of a change of address so will not receive their
Bulletin and can give it to them now. The Soviet asks her to call
KOUKHARENKO in order to change that address and asks for the name

of the (Guban) Cultural Attache. DURAN says it is Teresa PROENZA
whose number is 14-13-26. The Soviet thanks her.

is. Dear Dicks

f ry Our efforts to answer recent informal inquiries, including some

: from the White House Staff, have revealed that, though CIA and the

wht > FBE have detailed records concemning Americans who have been recruited
i cic as intelligence agents by Bloc countries, there does not appear to be
8 |’... a complete listing of those Americans now living in Bloc countries

| * *. who might be called "defectors". Using the definitions of DCID h/2,

these persons might be described as those who have either been
capable of providing useful intelligence to the Bloc or those whose :
y desire to resettle in Bloc countries has been significantly exploited“: .;!
| ° £or communist propaganda purposes. This would mean that no attention -:
I 17. meed be paid to Anericans whose resettloment within the Bloc had no
h re counter-intelligence implications or had attracted no particular ‘.,/
+i... attention; for instance, this definition would not cover individual ;
'"." US citizens of East European or Chinese origin who retumed to the «,
homeland” because they had never been conpletely assimilated into

. the American society.

Thera is attached a list of such persons, covering the last 18
nonths, and it would be appreciated if the Agency could verify and
possibly expand thia list for the use of inkerested Bureaus of. the a
