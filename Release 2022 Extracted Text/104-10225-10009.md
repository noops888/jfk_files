2. ANSTALK-1 said the (ndividual in the photo was
definitely not "Guillermo", He said that if the individual
was one of. tho two'ho had mot with, it would have to bo tho
second man, who used no name but gave the impresston of
boing a bodyguard, However, he said the second man had
‘garker.skin tones; lookod like an Arab or Lebanese; appeared
to have some Negro blood, although he would not classify him
as a mullato; and had curly hatr which was almost kinny.
The oyes, Ups and roceding hairline are very similar, but
the individual ho mot had a large bushy mustache.

proposal to AMSTALK-1 requesting a mooting to be held in

certainly not warranted by the circumstances. If the
i purpose wore only to get a message to AMSTALK-1, a
simple typed letter in a sealed onvolop would have dono
the job, Tne use of strip film which necessitates
special equipment for reading, also suggests the possibility
that tho entire operation 1s designed for ‘the purpose of
opening a channel to WOFACT, PINIERO would probably assume
| AMSTALK-1 would report the incident to WOFACT and the
: utilization of professional techniques might be a means of
establishing bona fides in order that WOFACT not dismiss the
mossago as other than genuine, Also attached for Headquarters

Marta had applied for exit from Cuba some time ago, but it
wasn't until she wrote a letter to Manuel’ PINEINO,}) aka

“Barba Roja, Director of the DG] and close:family friend of
the ISALGUE's prior to the Revolution, that she had any —
-inkIing that her cxit request would be honored. Following
dispatch of the letter, she was telephoned by PINEIRO who

. said thet he had taken her case under his personal supervision,
and that she would be visited by someone from his office in
tha near future, The following day, PINEINO's secretary
called on Marta to discuss the situation, and obtain necessary
additional details. Not hearing anything concrete for about
one month, Marta again wrote to PINEIRO, who again telephoned
her saying that immediate action would be taken, The follow~
ing day she was visited by two men who claimed to be from
PINEIRO's office. One identified himself as MENENCEZ and said
that he was a former close friend of ANSTALK-1, They gave
Marta a definite date for her departure from Cuba, and
promised to return again to insure that the plans were working
smoothly. Just prior to leaving Cuba, Marta was revisited hy

2. AMSTALK~1 avoided meoting Marta at the airport for
reasons of socurity, and saw her for the firut timo on the
following night,.12 April, but thoro were so many frionds and
family present that thoy bad no chance to talk alone, Marta
did indicate, however, that she wantod to have a long talk
with AM:TALK-1, ‘The following day, Marta loft for Wost Palo
Leach vbero sho stayed with rolatives for about one weok. She
returned to Miami and telephoned AMSTALK-1 on 24 April, at
which time 4 meeting was arranged for the same evoning, It

oriented ANTRI (BTEAMER) project as Team Leader and
Principal Agent zince his restgzation from AMICE.

request, the cryptonym AMICE-!4 will be cancelled effective
