It is to be further noted the LHM concerning

merely supplemental to information previasly furnished to the
USA's Office, Chicago. (¥)

The information contained in the second sections of the
LHMs cannot be utilized for a substantive case which could go
to trial for reasons which are apparent to the Bureau. These
sections could be used, however, on which to base questions
before a Federal Grand Jury (FGJ) when considering utilization
of the immunity technique. Without the second sections it is
recognized that it probably would be difficult to question
individuals before the FGJ successfully. Chicago is, however,
reluctant to furnish the second sections to the Department and/or
the USA in Chicago at this time in view of the current
controversy in the RUBY KOLOD matter. Chicago recommends that
only the first section of each LHM be disseminated at this time (U/

Re: BENJAMIN JACOBSON

If.

. Information was received in October 1963, that

during the early part of that month Buddy Jacobson personally

met with Sam Giancana and Paul De Lucia, also known as Paul

"the waiter" Ricca. This information indicated that at that

time Sam Giancana was the top leader of organized crime in the
Chicago area, and that Paul De Lucia was one of his predecessors
in this position. They advised Jacobson during their meeting with
him that they were extremely satisfied with the way the members

of the Regular Democratic Organization of the First Ward were
handling the favors requested of them by Giancana and were
particularly satisfied with the way Pat Marcy was conducting
himself. Although they indicated that conditions were bad \
for organized crime in view of the intensified investigations t
of the Federal Government, they did not blame the members of i
the First Ward and Regular Democratic Organization for this
condition. During the meeting Ricca told Jacobson that the
organization must be patient and wait for the pressure to tate(U)

In late September, 1964, a misunderstanding arose
between Pat Marcy and Cook County Circuit Judge Daniel A.
Covelli. Information was received that Judge Covelli indicated

Jacobson to re-contact Judge Covelli and make very clear to
him that the instructions given to him were from Sam Giancana
and that they were to be followed without any argument. Shortly
thereafter it was learned that Judge Covelli presented no further
arguments concerning the matter of interest which never became

On November 29, 1962, Special Agents Ralph R.
Hill, Jvr., Marshall E, Rutland, and William F. Roemer observed
Samuel Giancana meet with John D'Arco, then the Alderman and
Democratic Ward Committee of the First Ward of Chicago at
the Czech Lodge in North Riverside, Illinois. These agents
observed Benjamin "Buddy" Jacobson standing approximately twenty
feet from the booth in which the conference between Giancana
and D'Arco took place, Jacobson was requested to join the
above agents in the bar area of the Czech Lodge outside the
earshot of .Giancana and D'Arco. He was engaged in conversation
and advised that he is "the political expert and kingmaker" of
the First Ward, and commented "I am the fixer in the First Ward
and I've been the fixer in the First Ward for 44 years. I take
care of everybody, including policemen, politians and judges.
Everybody who needs anything comes to me for favors in my Ward.
This is my function." During the interview he indicated that
he is acquainted with Giancana, but denied that the association
as close or that he or D'Arco take orders from Giancana. He
also advised that he has been in the company of Murray Humphreys,
but advised that his association with Humphreys was not close
in any degree and stated that he had not seen Humphreys for a
long time. He also advised that he is acquainted with Gus Alex,
but has no business or political connections with him and only
sees him approximately three times a year. Jacobson commented
concerning his excellent physical condition and noted that he
works out every afternoon at Postl's Health Club, 188 West

In February, 1964, Anthony Tisci discussed with
Sam Giancana the possibility that. Andrew Euzzino, State
Representative, might be replaced by Nunzio Tisci, the brother
of Anthony Tisci. It was the feeli of Tisci that
Giancana should order this change.)

(CG 6486-C*)

In March, 1964, Sam Giancana met with Anthony Tisci
due to the fact that Giancana became aware that the Federal
Bureau of Investigation learned of a meeting recently attended
by Giancana., Giancana told Tisci that he feels strongly that
there is an informant close to the Giancana organization./\)

As of September, 1964, Tisci continued to be the

come, to him, aS a man in a position of public trust, in order
that the significance of this list might be determined. D!'Arco
replied that he had no idea as to the meaning of this list.
He stated thatthis was the first he had heard about it.
He declined to speculate as to the Significance of the
list. D'Arco advised that although he knew Giancana in his
youth, Since Giancana grew up in the old 20th Ward, he has
not seen Giancana for a "long time," and does not associate
with Giancana, He refused comment on four occasions when
he was informed that information had been developed that he
is a close associate of Gus Alex. He indicated that he did
not feel, even as a public spirited citizen, that he should
talk to Alex or Giancana concerning the Significance of the
list. When he was asked whether he would desire that Agents
hold off making inquiries until he had a chance to learn
the Sgnificance of the list, he replied that the Agents had
a job to do and they should do it as theysmw fit. When
he was advised that if the FBI could perform’ their functions
discreetly without embarrassment to him if“he would show any
inclination to be of assistance, D'Arco made the following
statement: . "You guys can't embarrass me in this town, I'm
a big man here and if my constituents are satisfied with. the
way I wayreeen them, I don't have to worry about nobody

Charles Postl, now deceased, owner of Postl's
Health Club, 188 West Randolph Street, Chicago, Illinois,
advised in 1962 thatat that time Gus Alex and Edward Vogel,
both leaders of organized crime in the Chicago area, frequented
the health club on an average of two, three or four times a
week, Postl advised that while at the club he observed
them frequently in conversation with John D'Arco and Pat
Marcy. (e)

Information was received in 1962 that at that time
Louis Briatta worked as a collector from handbooks in the
First Ward of Chicago. Information received indicated that
Briatta, a brother-in-law of D'Arco, was given this position

returned to Chicago on February 22, 1963 he was scheduled to
meet with Joh D'Arco and Marcy concerning the campaign for
Alderman of the First Ward of the City of chicago. /U)

(CG 6576-C*)

John D'Arco made reservations for Sam Giancana at
the King Cole Hotel in Miami, Florida in February, 1963.
These reservations were made by D'Arco with Lou Koren, then
the manager of the King Cole.Hotel. Information. was received
that in early December, 1963, John D'Arco met with Sam Giancana
and was advised by Giancana that Giancana had someone who could
"control" Frank Annunzio, who had been selected by Giancana
to run for the position of Congressman from the Seventh Poy
Congressional District of Illinois, This information indicated \
that it was the decision of Giancana to replace Roland V. :
Libonati with Annunzio. Giancana informed D'Arco that the
person to whom he referred is Cook County Circuit Court Judge
Daniel A, Covelli. Giancana indicated that there was no
doubt in his mind that he could control Annunzio through
Covelli. The meeting between Giancana and D‘Arco took place
on the west side of Chicago on the evening of December 11,
1963, 4 v

Information was received that although John D'Arco
had a meeting scheduled with Sam Giancana for May 25, 1964
this meeting was cancelled by Giancana who intended to leave
town instead. /) .

\(CG 6576-C*)

In mid-December, 1964, John D'Arco met with |
Sam Giancana due to the fact that D‘Arco had heard rumors i
to the effect that he and his associates in the Regular
Democratic Organization of the First Ward no longer had the

Om

influence with Giancana which they previously enjoyed. hoy
Information was received that at that time Giancana was

conSidering decreasing his influence and possibly stepping
down as the top leader of organized crime in Chicago. Since

it was a matter of concern with D'Arco and his associates,

Marcy, and Jacobson that they would loose the power which

they enjoyed under Giancana, D'Arco met with Giancana

who advised him that there was abSolutely no change in the

Situation concerning the activity of D'Arco, Marcy and

Jacobson and that they were to continue to act in the manner

in which they were accustomed. (v

(CG 6576-C*)

Information was received in December, 1964 that
John D'Arco was given two packages containing sums of money
which were to be delivered to Sam Giancana. It was specifically
noted that one of the packages contained the sum of $10,000.
However, the specific amount contained in the second package
and the source of this money was not determined. /1/)

(CG 6576-C*)

. In May, 1965, information was received that John
D'Arco was making every effort which he could to influence
United States Attorney Edward V. Hanrahan to lay off Chicago
Democratic politicians in any further Grand Jury proceedings.
It was learned that D'Arco approached Mayor Richard J. Daley
| of Chicago in this regard but that he received no assistance
whatsoever from Mayor Daley who indicated to him that it
was Mayor Daley's feeling that it was D'Arco's fault for
: creating this Situation. It was also the information of
this source that Mayor Daley was highly critical of D'Arco
for his activities which caused he and his associates to be
subpoenaed before the Federal Grand Jury in Chicago. No
information was received indicating that D*'Arco was successful
in influencing United States Attorney Hanrahan to cease his
investigation of D'Arco and his associates and it is noted
that D'Arco, Marcy and Jacobson and Tisci were all subpoenaed
before the,Federal Grand Jury of the Northern District of
Illinois in the early summer of 1965, v)

As an example the "Chicago Daily News" in its Red Strea,
edition of July 16, 1963, carried such a photograph. 0

At approximately 9:20 AM, On June 25, 1963, Special
Agents Joseph H. Servel and Dennis W. Shanahan noticed that they
were being followed by a 1959 Ford. Special Agent Shanahan
therefore stopped the government car in which, he was riding and
inquired of the driver of the 1959 Ford, "Who.are you? What
can we do for you?" The driver of this car -replied, "I'm
Anthony Tisci, Attorney. I'm collecting evidence." When
Special Agent Shanahan inquired as ‘to what type of evidence
he was collecting, Tisci replied, "I'm not going to say since
this is privileged information between attorney and client."
On the same date at approximately 11:00 AM, Tisci again approached
the automobile occupied by Special Agents Servel and Shanahan,
this time at the Fresh Meadows Golf Course in Hillside, Illinois.
Tisci complained tht the civil rights of Sam Giancana were
being violated. He blamed the Federal Bureau of Investigation
for Giancana's present difficulties. Tisci advised that he
worked for the government himself and was familiar with
government ye He remarked he “had his hump up and

would fight."

Roland V. Libonati, then a United States Congressman
representing the Seventh Congressional ,District of Illinois,
advised on September 26, 1963 that he wasaware that when Sam
Giancana sought an injunction against the Federal Bureau of
Investigation in Federal Court in Chicago Anthony Tisci
appeared at the Giancana hearing in Federal Court... Congressman
Libonati stated that it was his understanding that Tisci
appeared as a witness for Sam Giancana inasmuch as Tisci
was in a position to testify since he had visited his father-in-
law's home on many occaSions and could testify as to what he
observed at the time Tisci made these visits. ngressman
Libonati identified Tisci as being his crerk. (Uf

A review of transcripts of proceedings before Federal
Judge Richard B, Austin in the case entitled Sam Giancana
versus J. Edgar Hoover, Director, Federal Bureau of Investig tion,
and Marlin W. Johnson, Agent in Charge, Chicago, Office of
the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Docket 63C1145, reflected



that during the course of these proceedings Charles English,
1131 North Latrobe, River Forest, Illinois, testified that on
the evening. of June 25, 1963 he met Giancana and Mr. and Mrs,
Anthony Tisci at the Armory Lounge in Forest Park, Illinois.
This foursome went to the Czech Lodge where they had dinner
and then returned to the Armory Lounge. English then testified
that he and Tisci engaged in conversation with two Federal
Bureau of Investigation Agents who he identified as “Roamer"
and "Marshall", (¥)

In regard to the above Special Agents Marshall E.
Rutland and William F, Roemer conversed with Charles English
at the Armory Lounge in Forest Park, Illinois on June 25,
1963. At one point during the conversation, English attempted
to engage the Agents in a discussion as to the laws, both
local and federal, regarding gambling and what exactly constituted
a gambling violation. The Agents pointed out to English that
for a legal opinion as to what constitutes a violation of
gambling laws, he should consult with Anthony Tisci, who
was observed to be sitting at a table with Dominic "Butch"
Vlasi in another portion of the room, At this point English
turned and hailed Tisci and requested that he joint the group,
which Tisci did. Tisci's initial remarks concerned the surveillance
which was then being conducted by Federal Bureau of Investigation
Agents of Giancana and without prompting he began a conversation
pointing out to the Agents that he felt that through the use
of binoculars the Agents were in actuality spying into the
household of Giancana. After several minutes conversation,
Tisci admitted the reason behind Giancana's Court proceedings
were for the purpose of trying to do away with Federal Bureau
of Investigation investigation into Giancana's activities.
According to Tisci, "we are putting all our eggs in one basket .*(u)

Lieutenant Joseph Morris, Director of the Scotland
Yard Detail, Chicago Police Department, advised on July 5, 1954
that Anthony Accardo, then the top leader of organized crine
in the Chicago area, entertained at a barbeque party at his
home at 915 North Franklin Street, River Forest, Illinois, on
July 4, 1954, Lieutenant Morris advised that members of his

He advised that one such person attended in a car bearing 1954
license number 18670960, which he advised he had found to

Lieutenant Morris advised on May 21, 1955, that his
officers observed visitors to the wake of the mother of
Samuel M. Giancana at the Rago Funeral Home, 5132 West Fullerton
Avenue, in August, 1964. Lieutenant’ Morris advised that his

cars to attend this wake. He advised that one of these
cars bore a license number 1867-960, which he advised to be 5
listed to,A,P. Tisci, 1512 South Wisconsin Avenue, Berwyn,
Illinois. )

Captain William J. Duffy, Director, Intelligence
Unit, Bureau of Inspectional Services, Chicago Police Department,
advised that his files contain the information that an
investigation of his unit determined that Charles English

the son-in-law of Sam "Mooney" Giancana, Captain Duffy advised
that his file showed that Tisci had previously resided at

his associates, Ralph Pierce, Frank Ferraro, and Hy Godfrey,
all of whom are active with Humphreys in the affairs of
organized crime in the Chicago area. Also present on this
occasion, as observed by Special Agents Rutland and Roemer,
was Pat Marcy of the regular Democratic organization of the

sation, Ferraro and Marcy split from the rest of the group

a déal" for a girl "no matter how much it costs", and to

"get back" to Ferraro. Marcy was overheard informing Ferraro
‘you have.to establish residency first", Lhater, after part
of the conversation went unheard by the Agents, Marcy informed
Ferraro, apparently concerning another subject, "I know we
have a lot of joints available" and "T?]1 check on this and
let you know." At 12:45 p.m., Humphreys, Ferraro, and Marcy
entered the barber shop located on the extreme east end of
the lower arcade of the Palmer House Hotel. They were not
thereafter observed. lo)

On September 12, 1962, Pat Marcy was contacted in
Room 2306 at 100 North La Salle Street, Chicago, Illinois,
in the offices of the regular Democratic organization of the
First Ward by Special Agents William F. Roemer, Jr. and
Marshall E. Rutland. Marcy advised the agents that he refused
to discuss any situation whatsoever concerning his association

is aware that he was observed with the above individuals by
Special Agents Roemer and Rutland. He referred Special Agent
Roemer to the fact that Special Agent Roemer had contacted

of organized crime in the Chicago area, frequented the
health club on an average of three or four times a week and
that while at the club, they were observed frequently by
him in conversation with John D'Arco and Pat Marcy. (ul

is a close associate of Gus Alex and of other leaders of
organized crime in the Chicago area and that he takes orders
from Alex and his associates in regard to any requests or
favorable treatment which they desire from public officials

contact with members of the judiciary, law enforcement offices,
and other public officials in the Chicago area.

various State Street strip tease operations had been paid to

Pat Marcy in the offices of the regular Democratic organization

upon the strip tease operations at the request of the First

that this "first-of-the-month" payment had absolutely nothing
to do with the profits which was split between organized
crime and the operators of the strip tease joints. The
informant advised that each strip operation was assessed

$300 a month for this tribute. All moneys to be paid to
Marcy were to be paid in one hundved-dollar bills according

First District Policemen of the Chicago Police Department,
which moneys are obtained from strip tease operations in
the First Ward of Chicago, for August, 1963, amounted to
$3,220.00. Of this amount, $150 was made to Lieutenant
Mark Conlin, the police officer in the First District who
acts as the go-between Pat Marcy and the First District of
the Chicago Police Department. The source of this information
noted that this sum is approximately only 75 per cent of
that figure which was the total pay-off for the month. of
February, 1963, and the specific pay-off to Lieutenant
Conlin also amounted only to approximately 75 per cent of
his monthly payment in February, 1963. It was the opinion

Information was received in March of 1964, that
Pat Marcy made contact with one Romeo Nappi, an influential
member of organized crime in the Chicago area, inasmuch as
Nappi had contacts with certain police officers in the
Chicago area who had access to files of the Chicago Police
Department. Marcy made arrangements with Nappi to receive
from Nappi the names of the police officers who were described
in a memorandum furnished Police Superintendent O. W. Wilson
by the Department of Justice shortly prior to March of 1964.
During these preliminary arrangements with Nappi, Marcy was

Riordan frequently met with Marcy in the basement of Maxims
Restaurant on North Clark Street in the Loop area of Chicago
and that arrangements were made by Marcy to telephonically
contact Captain Riordan at any time using a code name.
One of the things which Marcy discussed with Captain Riordan
was the possibility of transferring vice-officer Marvin Mandel,
above, from the First District. It was Marcy's position that
he did not want to do anything to embarras Captain Riordan
in view of the close relationship which he enjoyed with
Riordan so as not to jeopardize the position of Riordan. (U

Porcaro as a salesman. This information indicated that
Porcaro, at that time the Republican Ward Committeeman of
the 28th Ward of Chicago, had the strong backing of Giancana.
However, Marcy and his associates in Anco were apprehensive
because of a recent investigation which they believe had been
conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation into the
affairs of the insurance company. They felt that to keep
Porearo on the payrobl would lend. adverse publicity to
Anco and they felt for this reason, Giancana should be

During late November and early December or 1964,

The nature of the rift concerned the fact that Marcy felt
that certain contacts being made by Neistein in the First
Ward of Chicago should more properly be handled by Marcy

and his associates. As a result of this, Marcy requested
Anthony Tisci to advise Sam Giancana and received a ruling
from Giancana as to whether Neistein should continue to

A. great number of checks were pnotos tabed TERM
Verdone was writing checks totalling thousands of dollar: er a
period of a couple of years and on occasion was writing checks
amounting to $300 and $400 apiece several times a day, These
checks were made. out to various individuals, some known to be
hoodlums or hoodlum associates, ‘and an overwhelmingly number of
them were cashed at the a0 dale Restaurant in Chicago which is

a known hoodlum hangout. |{J nA

Several of these checks weye endorsed by Aldrich and

Company, @ produce company in Chicago owned and run by Frank Alesia.
In this regard Alesia was interviewed September 12, 1963, by Special
Agents Elliott W. Anderson and John H. Wilmes, He claimed that
besides being a close friend of Déctor Verdone, Verdone assisted
Alesia's daughter in giving birth'a child, making him very grateful
to Verdone, He said they met frequently at Arlington Park Race
Track and Verdone was an avid bettor making $20 bets across the
board. (¥)

In connection with this betting Verdone frequently
used to call long distance from Milwaukee to Alesia at his business
telephone CHesapeake 3-8500, He said these calls were usually
made by 11:00 AM and he never reversed the charges, These calls
were usually made once or twice a week because he knew that Alesia
went to the track on Wednesday or Saturday. Verdone's stated
purpose in calling was to have Alesia place bets for him which
was always done on credit and he apparently trusted Alesia
completely. Alesia stated he used to bet on horses himself and
although he never bets more than $20 a race, he too is an avid
pettor, Apparently Verdone sought him out pecause of their similar
likes, When Alesia was asked why Verdone chose to bet with him
and not a bookie i! ilwaukee, he said he had no knowledge of why
he had done this. 1D)

He said Verdone would often ask him to cash checks and
Sometimes they were not his own and Alesia assumed these were checks
written by his customers, Alesia said he would always honor this
request and gave Verdone the money, even loaning him money on
occasions «

; He claims to have first met Verdone through a friend who
owns horses; however, he. refused to identify him or furnish any

gambles at the dice table. (v)

Alesia stated that Verdone owned him $1,181.00 in payment ©
of horse betting debts and he paid this by giving Alesia a check
for $700 which he believes was a cashiers check, then following up
with another $200 cashiers check and subsequently paying him $281 H
in cash at Christmas of 1962, Alesia said he kept no records of
his debt stating that they were good friends and he saw no need |
to do so, feeling sure that Verdone had no record of this debt \
either, Alesia said he is willing to testify as to the above
information because he wants to keep his name clean, He said he
had never been in any trouble and will not get into any trouble
over something like this, He adSo said his company does a ite
of government business and he does not want to lose any of it, (u)

In regard to the above on June 21, 1965, Dr, Anthony J.

believes the Dalitz group also had a hidden interest in

the Riviera Hotel in Las Vegas. - This-.source advised he
obtained information indicating that during all of 1960 Eugene
c.."Jimmy James", formerly the Secretary-Treasurer of the
Laundry, Cleaning and Dye House Workers International Union
(AFL-CIO), and formerly an official of Local 46 of the above
union, with offices at 1640-West Van Buren Street, Chicago,
was working on behalf.of Alex, Humphreys, Giancana and

their associates in order to obtain a financial interest

in the above-mentioned hotels and gambling casinos in Las
vegas. (V,

This source also advised that Ross Miller was also
utilized by Alex and his associates in this regard, as was
Nick Civella of Kansas City. This source also advised he is
aware Alex was in occasional contact during this period
with Sidney R. Korshak, Chicago attorney -(y) .

Source also advised Alex used Paul "Red" Dorfman
in a light capacity in this regard. Also used by Alex as an
intermediary between the Dalitz group was John Drew. Source
further related Charles "Babe" Baron represented the interest
of Alex regarding their transactions in Las Vegas but he
didn't have any specific information tending to indicate
that Baron was involved in this situation. He was unable
to provide any information, however, concerning the nature )
of the roles played by the above individual in the negotiations.(V.

Source advised the individuals involved in the

negotiations in Las Vegas were Morris Dalitz and two other
individuals whom he could not identify. He stated these
indiviials were originally from Cleveland and that one of
them probably was Morris Kleinman who was financially
associated with the Desert Inn and Stardust Hotels. He
advised he cannot be absolutely certain as to the identity
of hotel or hotels involved in the negotiations but he
believed that the Riviera Hotel was involved and believed
further that the deal must have also included the Desert Inn
and Stardust Hotels. Source advised it is his understanding

the ground work for these negotiations was laid several

_ years ago by Tony Accafdo and Paul Ricca. He advised from

information which he had received that it appeared Giancana
probably was more active in the final steps of the negotiations
then was Alex. Source was unable to specifically state

the amount of money involved in the transactions. He stated,
however, it appeared to him that the investment made by the
Chicago group approximated $36,000 per month. He provided
additional information that during the negotiations in 1960,
prior to the consumation of the transaction in approximately
February, 1961, the "hoodlums" were attempting to obtain

five points in the hotel or hotels they were interested

in in Las te S. He noted that one point is issued approximately
$125,000. y

He stated that this’ was in addition another
point which was obtained in behalf of Jimmy James, which
was to take care of James’ family while le was in jail
in New Jersey for embezzlement of Laundry Union funds.
Source stated from information he had obtained, it appeared
that Nick Civella and James made an arrangement whereby
Civella was to retain the income from the one point unless
James could not beat his case in New Jersey and was
incarcerated in which event the wife of James was to receive
a monthly income from the one point. In the latter case,
Civella was to receive $6,000 a month from the Chicago
group after they obtained their income from the five points
which they obtained in the Las Vegas hotel or hotels.
It is noted James began serving sentence on November 17, 1960.(y)

This confidential source advised it is his opinion
Mo Dalitz was in Chicago on the weekend of November’ 5 and 6,
1960, and while in Chicago, he had a meeting with Alex,
Giancana and other m ers of the Chicago group whovere
in this transaction xc)

This sourcéeprovided information in February, 1961,
that the above transaction was practially completed as of
that time. “He ‘stated from information he received, that
Alex and his Chicago associates wre successful in obtaining
a financial interest in-the hotel-or hotels they were interested
in and that’ the transaction was "sealed" for all practical

purposes as of that timed| (CG 6343#¢%)

strip joints and shylocking activities conducted in the
lst Ward, Chicago. According to this source, Alex receives
this income from approximately 15 different sources usually
during the first part of each month. Most of his sources
of income are bookmakers located in the 1st Ward, however,
some are bookmakers located outside of the 1st Ward. Two of
his sources of income, such as Louie Arger and Louie Tornebene,
obtain their income from such night clubs as the Brass
Rail, the Santa Fe Hotel Lounge, the 606 Club and Eddie. Foy's.
Other sources are "shylockers" who usually loan out money
on a six for five basis" and it is apparently the money of
the Alex organization which they, loan out. As a result, Alex
receives a cut of this money. (4
