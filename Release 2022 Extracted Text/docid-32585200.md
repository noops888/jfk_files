The information contained in the second sections of the

Without the second sections it is

recognized that it probably would be difficult to question

individuals before the FGJ successfully. Chicago is, however,

reluctant to furnish the second sections to the Department and/or

Information was received in October 1963, that

during the early part of

that month Buddy Jacobson

personally

met with Sam Giancana and Paul De Lucia, also known as

Paul

"the waiter" Ricca. This information indicated that at that

time Sam Giancana was the top leader of organized crime in the

Chicago area,

and

that Paul De Lucia was one of his predecessors

in this position.

They advised Jacobson during their meeting with

him that they were extremely satisfied with the way

the members

of the Regular Democratic Organization of the First Ward were

handling the favors requested of them by Giancana and were

particularly satisfied with the way Pat Marcy was conducting

himself.

Although they indicated that conditions were bad

for organized crime in view of the intensified investigations

of the federal Government, they did not blame the members of

the First Ward and Regular Democratic Organization for

this

condition. During the meeting Ricca told Jacobson that the

organization must be patient and wait for the pressure to liftly)

(CG 6576-C*)

In late September, 1964, a misunderstanding arose

between Pat Marcy and Cook County Circuit Judge Daniel A.

Covelli. Information was received that Judge Covelli indicated

that he did not desire to grant a favor requested of him either

by Marcy or by Buddy Jacobson.

Marcy thereupon instructed

Jacobson to re-contact Judge Covelli and make very clear to

him that the instructions given to him were from Sam Giancana

and that they were to be followed without any argument.

thereafter it was learned that Judge Covelli presented no further

arguments concerning the matter of interest which

never became

apparent. (v)

the Czech Lodge in North Riverside, Illinois.

These agents

observed Benjamin "Buddy" Jacobson

standing approximately twenty

feet from the booth in which the conference between Giancana

and D'Arco took place. Jacobson was requested to join the

he is acquainted

is close or that he or D'Arco

take orders from Giancana.

He

also advised that he has been in the company of Murray Humphreys,

but advised that his association with Humphreys was not close

He also advised that he is acquainted with Gus Alex,

• In March, 1964, Sam Giancana met with Anthony Tisci

that the significance of this list might be determined. D'Arco

replied that he had no idea as to the meaning of this list.

He stated thatthis was the first he had heard about it.

He declined to speculate as to the significance of the

list. D'Arco advised that although he knew Giancana in his

youth, since Giancana grew up in the old 20th Ward, he has

not seen Giancana for a

"long time," and does not associate

with Giancana.

He refused comment on four occasions when

he was informed that information had been

developed that he

is a close associate of Gus Alex.

He indicated that he did

talk to

not feel, even as a public spirited citizen, that he should

talk to Alex or Giancana concerning the significance of the

list. When he was asked whether he would desire that Agents

hold off making inquiries until he had a chance to learn

the significance of the list, he replied that the Agents had

a job to do and they should do it as they saw

Charles Postl, now deceased, owner of Postl's

Health Club, 188 West Randolph Street, Chicago, Illinois,

advised in 1962 thatat that time Gus Alex and

Edward Vogel,

both leaders of organized crime in the Chicago area, frequented

the health club on an average of two, three or four

times a

week.

Postl advised that while at the club he observed

them frequently in conversation with John D'Arco and Pat

Marcy. (U)

Information was received in 1962 that at that time

Louis Briatta worked as a collector from handbooks in the

First Ward of Chicago.

Information received indicated that

Briatta, a brother-in-law of D'Arco, was given this position

Special Agent Roemer

made his presence known to Glancana and D'Arco. Shortly.

thereafter Giancana departed from the Czech Lodge and an

attempt was made by Special Agents Romer and Rutland to

interview D'Arco.

However, D'Arco, in a very heated manner,

advised that he was busy and that the Agents had

"a lot of

nerve" interrupting him. D'Arco insisted that the Agents had

no right approaching him and that he was aware of his Constitutional

guarantees.

He stated tlat it was extremely rude of Special

Agent Roemer to interrupt his conversation with Giancana.

Information was received that when Sam Giancana

returned to Chicago on February 22, 1963 he was scheduled to

leet with Joh D'Arco and Marcy concerning the campa

for

iderman of the First Ward of the City of Chicago. (U

(CG 6576-C*)

John D'Arco made reservations for Sam Giancana at

the King Cole Hotel in Miami, Florida in February, 1963.

These reservations were made by D'Arco with Lou Koren, then

the manager of the King Cole Hotel.

Information was received

that in early December, 1963, John D'Arco met with Sam Giancana

and was advised by Giancana that Giancana had someone who could

"control" Frank Annunzio, who had been selected by Giancana

to run for the position of Congressman from the Seventh

This information indicated

that it was the decision of Giancana to replace Roland V.

Libonati with Annunzio. Giancana informed D'Arco that the

person to whom he referred is Cook County Circuit Court Judge

Daniel A. Covelli. Giancana indicated that there was no

doubt in his mind

that he could control Annunzio through

Covelli. The meeting between Giancana and D'Arco took place

between canca na

on the

west side of Chicago on the evening of December 11,

1963. (U)

(CG 6486-**)

Information was received that although John D'Arco

had a meeting scheduled with Sam Giancana for May 25, 1964

this meeting was

cancelled by Giancana who intended to leave

town

instead.

(CG 6576-C*)

In mid-December, 1964, John D'Arco met with

Sam Giancana due to the fact that D'Arco had heard rumors

to the effect that he and his associates in the Regular

Democratic Organization of the First Ward no longer had the

//

influence with Giancana which they previously enjoyed.

Information was received that at that time Giancana was

considering decreasing his influence and possibly stepping

down as the top leader of organized crime in Chicago.

Since

it was a matter of concern with D'Arco and his associates,

Marcy, and Jacobson that they would loose the power which

they enjoyed under Giancana, D'Arco met with Giancana

who advised him that there was absolutely no change in the

situation concerning the activity of D'Arco, Marcy and

Jacobson and that they were to continue to act in the manner

in which they were accustomed. (U

(CG 6576-C*)

Information was received in December, 1964 that

John D'Arco was given two packages containing sums of money

which were to be delivered to Sam Giancana. It was specifically

noted that one of the packages contained the sum of $10,000.

However, the specific amount contained in the second package

and the

source of this money was not determined. (Ul

(CG 6576-C*)

In May, 1965, information was received that John

D'Arco was making every effort which he could to influence

United States Attorney Edward V. Hanrahan to lay off Chicago

Democratic politicians in any further Grand Jury proceedings.

It was learned that D'Arco approached Mayor Richard J. Daley

of Chicago in this regard but that he received no assistance

whatsoever from Mayor Daley who indicated to him that it

was Mayor Daley's feeling that it was D'Arco's fault for

creating this situation.

It was also the information of

this source that Mayor Daley was highly critical of D'Arco

for his activities which caused he and his associates to be

subpoenaed before the Federal Grand Jury in Chicago. No

information was received indicating that D'Arco was successful

in influencing United States Attorney Hanrahan to cease his

investigation of D'Arco and his associates and it is noted

that D'Arco, Marcy and Jacobson and Tisci were all subpoenaed

before the Federal Grand Jury of the Northern District of

Illinois in the early summer of 1965. (U)

During late June and early July, 1963, Special Agents

of the Federal Bureau of Investigation observed

Sam Giancana on

almost a continuous basis. During this time it was observed

that he was in the company of Anthony Tisci on several occasions. (U)

In July, 1963, Samuel Giancana filed a suit in Federal

Court in the Northern District of Illinois to enjoin the surveil-

lances of him by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

It is a

matter of public knowledge that Anthony Tisci accompanied Giancana

to the courtroom during the appearances of Giancana in court in

connection with his suit.

Several

photographs of Tisci in the

company of Giancana appeared in the public press in Chicago, at

As an example the "Chicago Daily News" in its Red streak

edition

of July 16, 1963, carried such a photograph. (U

At approximately 9:20 AM, On June 25, 1963, Special

Agents Joseph H. Servel and Dennis W. Shanahan

noticed that they

were being followed by a 1959 Ford. Special Agent Shanahan

therefore stopped the government car in which, he was riding and

inquired of the driver of the 1959 Ford, "Who are you?

What

can we do for you?" The driver of this car replied, "I'm

Anthony Tisci, Attorney. I'm collecting evidence."

When

Special Agent Shanahan inquired as to what type of evidence

"I'm not going to say since

this is privileged information between attorney and client."

On the same date at approximately 11:00 AM, Tisci again approached

the automobile occupied by special Agents Servel and shanahan,

this time at the Fresh Meadows Golf Course in Hillside, Illinois.

Tisci complained tht the civil rights of Sam Giancana were

being violated. He blamed the Federal Bureau of Investigation

for Giancana's present difficulties.

Tisci advised that he

worked for the government himself and was familiar with

government procedures. He remarked he "had his hump up and

would fight."V)

Roland V. Libonati, then a United States Congressman

representing the Seventh Congressional District of Illinois,

advised on September 26, 1963 that he wasaware that when Sam

Giancana sought an injunction against the Federal Bureau of

Investigation in Federal Court in Chicago Anthony Tisci

appeared at the Giancana hearing in Federal Court. Congressman

Libonati stated that it was his understanding that Tisci

appeared as a witness for Sam Giancana inasmuch as Tisci

in a position to testify since he had visited his father-in-

law's home on many occasions and could testify as to what he

bserved at the time visci made these visits.

¿bonati identified Tisci as being his Clerk. (Uongressman

that during the course of thése proceedings Charles English,

1131 North Latrobe, River Forest, Illinois, testified that

On

the evening of June 25, 1963 he met Giancana and Mr. and Mrs.

Anthony Tisci at the Armory Lounge in Forest Park, Illinois.

This foursome went to the Czech Lodge where they had dinner

and then returned to the Armory Lounge. English then testified

that he and Tisci engaged in conversation with two Federal

Bureau of Investigation Agents who he identified as

"Roamer"

and "Marshall". (U)

In regard to the above Special Agents Marshall E.

Rutland and William F. Roemer conversed with Charles English

at the Armory Lounge in Forest Park, Illinois on June 25,

1963.

At one point during the conversation, English attempted

to engage the Agents in a discussion as to the laws, both

local and federal, regarding gambling and what exactly constituted

a gambling violation.

The Agents pointed out to English that

for a legal opinion as to what constitutes a violation of

gambling laws, he should consult with Anthony fisch Butch"

was observed to be sitting at a table with Dominic

Vlasi in another portion of

turned and hailed Tisci and the room. At this point English

requested that he joint the group,

which Tisci did.

Tisci's initial remarks concerned the surveillance

which was then being conducted by Federal Bureau of Investigation

Agents of Giancana and without prompting he began a conversation

pointing out to the Agents that he felt

that through the use

of binoculars the Agents were in actuality spying into the

household of Giancana. After several minutes conversation,

Tisci admitted the reason behind Giancana's Court proceedings

were for the purpose of trying to do away with Federal Bureau

of Investigation investigation into Giancana's activities.

According to risci, 'we are putting all our esgs in one basket. "(u)

Lieutenant Joseph Morris, Director of the Scotland

Yard Detail, Chicago Police Department, advised on July 5, 1954

Marcy informed

Ferraro, apparently concerning

another subject,

"I know we

have a lot of joints available" and "I'll check

on this and

let you know."

At 12:45 p.m., Humphreys, Ferraro, and Marcy

entered the barber shop located on the extreme east end of

the lower arcade of the Palmer House Hotel. They were not

thereafter observed. U

On September 12, 1962, Pat Marcy was contacted in

Room 2306 at 100 North La Salle

Street, Chicago, Illinois,

in the offices of the regular Democratic organization of

the

First Ward by Special Agents William F. Roemer, Jr. and

Marshall E. Rutland.

Marcy advised the agents that he refused

to discuss

any situation whatsoever concerning his association

with anyone or concerning anyone else.

He indicated that he

is aware that he was observed with the above individuals by

Special Agents Roemer and Rutland. He referred Special Agent

Roemer to the fact that Special Agent Roemer had contacted

him approximately two years previously and to the fact that

he had then referred Special Agent Roemer to his attorney,

Joseph Borenstein. Marcy advised on September 12, 1962, that

his position remained exactly the same as it did

two years

go and that the interviewing Agents should contact Borenstell

in the event

they wanted any questions answered by Marcy.

Charles Postl, now deceased, the former owner of

Postl's Health Club, 188 West Randolph Street, advised in

1962 that at that time Gus Alex and Edward Vogel, leaders

of organized crime in the Chicago area, frequented the

health club on an average of three or four times a week and

that while at the club, they were observed trequently oy

him in conversation with John D'Arco and Pat Marcy. U

Information has been received on numerous occasions

during the past five years from one informant that Pat Marcy

is a close associate of Gus Alex and of other leaders of

organized crime in the Chicago area and that he takes orders

from Alex and his associates in regard to any requests or

favorable treatment which they desire from public officials

in the Chicago area. This informant has advised that Marcy

carries out the orders.of Alex and his associates by making

contact with members of the judiciary, law enforcement offices,

in the Loop area of Chicago, made a pay-off in late September

or early October, 1961, to Pat Marcy in a building in the

vicinity of Van Buren and Federal

Illinois.

This informant stated that Tornabene was paying the

he had learned that the first-of-the-month collections from

various State Street strip tease operations had been paid to

Pat Marcy in the offices of the regular Democratic organization

of the First Ward at 100 North La Salle Street in Chicago.

This informant advised that the "first-of-the-months" collections

would be utilized for police fixes and other favors bestowed

upon the strip tease operations at the request of the First

Ward regular democratic organization..

This informant advised

that this "first-of-the-month" payment had absolutely nothing

to do with the profits which was split between organized

crime and the operators of the strip tease joints. The

informant advised that each strip operation was assessed

$300 a month for this tribute.

All moneys to be paid to

Marcy were to be paid in one hundred-dollar bills according

to his orders. On or about November 1, 1yb1, six strip tease

the Lieutenant of Gus Alex

in the operation of strip tease joints in the First Ward, to

close down all strip joints in the First Ward due to the

that Marcy place Accardo's son-in-law, Palmer Pyle, With the

Anco Insurance Company at a salary of

$400 per week. Marcy

did not indicate to Giancana that he did not desire that Pyle

be employed by Anco. Giancana also instructed Marcy that

Giancana desired that Andrew Flando, Jr. be slated to run

for the State Legislature in the Seventeenth Legislative

District of Illinois to replace Anthony Euzzino and that

Fred Roti be slated to fill the vacancy of Anthony De Tolve

for the State Senate. Giancana also made arrangements to

meet with Marcy again on the afternoon of January 25, 1963.

This source identified Giancana as being the top leader of

organized crime in the Chicago area and Accardo as being the

predecessor of Giancana in this position.

Information was received indicating that for several

years Pat Marcy had been able to receive favors from Richard

when Cain became the Chief Investigator of the Cook County

Sheriff's Office following the election of Richard Ogilvie.

that when

Marcy met on the weekend previous to December 19,

1962, Giancana gave Marcy complete responsibility for the

handling of the First Ward regular Democratic organization

and told him to continue in his work as he had in the past.

Giancana informed Marcy that all decisions were to be passed

to Marcy through Anthony Tisci, the son-in-law of Giancana,

which

moneys are obtained from strip

the First Ward of Chicago, for August, 1963, amounted to

The source of this information

February, 1963, and the specific pay-off to Lieutenant

Conlin also amounted only to approximately 75 per cent of

his monthly payment in February, 1963. It was the opinion

25 per cent loss in revenue, both to the strip tease operators

Re: PATRICK MARCIANO

as the disruption of hoodlum activities by police officers

was concerned, Giancana continued to have complete confidence

in Pat Marcy

and indicated to Jacobson that in his opinion

Marcy was doing the best job possible under the circumstances.

Giancana informed Jacobson that he did not hold Marcy at all

responsible for the above situation and knew that he was doing

all in his power for Giancana. U

Information was received in March of 1964, that

Pat Marcy made contact with one Romeo Nappi, an influential

member of organized crime in the Chicago area, inasmuch as

Nappi had contacts with certain police officers in the

Chicago area who had access to files of the Chicago Police

Department. Marcy made arrangements with Nappi to receive

from Nappi

the names of the police officers who were described

in a memorandum furnished Police Superintendent O. W. Wilson

by the Department of Justice shortly prior to March of 1964.

During these preliminary arrangements with Nappi, Marcy was

Police

Department, with whom he

enjoyed a very close relation-

Ship. Information was obtained indicating that Captain

Riordan frequently met with Marcy in the basement of Maxims

Restaurant on North Clark Street in the Loop area of Chicago

and that arrangements were made by Marcy to telephonically

contact Captain Riordan at any time using a code name.

One of the things which Marcy discussed with Captain Riordan

was the possibility of transferring vice-officer Marvin Mandel,

above, from the First District. It was Marcy's position that

he did not want to do anything to embarras Captain Riordan

in view of the close relationship which he enjoyed with

Riordan so as not to jeopardize the position ot Riordan. (V)

In March, 1964, information was received that Pat

Marcy, John D'Arco, and Buddy Jacobson intended to meet with

Sam Giancana due to the fact that Giancana had ordered that

their insurance firm, Anco, Incorporated, employ Joseph

Porcaro as a salesman. This information

indicated that

Porcaro, at that time

the Republican Ward Committeeman of

the 28th Ward of Chicago, had the strong backing of Giancana.

However, Marcy and his associates in Anco were apprehensive

because of a recent investigation which they believe had been

conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation into the

affairs of the insurance company.

They felt that to keep

Porcaro on the payroll would

lend adverse publicity to

Anco and they felt for this reason, Giancana should
