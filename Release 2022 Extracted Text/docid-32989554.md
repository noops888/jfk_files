Senator Frank Church

United States Senate

Washington, D.C. 20510

Dear Senator Church:

Taking the liberty of presuming on our short past acquain-

tance, I am writing you to express my leep concern over the

tragic adverse criticism being levelled at the FBI in the

news media as a result of current congressional inquiries

into United States intelligence operations.

As you well know, ninety per cent (90%) of the work of

the Bureau is concentrated on the investigation of violations

of U. S. criminal statutes over which the FBI has primary

investigative jurisdiction. Your committee and the other

committees of the Congress now looking into the activities of

the Bureau are therefore examining and criticizing the work

which constitutes a very small percentage of their overall

responsibility.

Not to stress the long and successful history

of the Bureau along with the few mistakes (the Congress itself

as had its share) they have made over the years is, I think,

unfair and not in the national interest.

Just one example of

the effect these stories are having occured Sunday, November 30th,

when the Washington Post carried a letter to the Editor entitled

"The FBI Discredited"

That letter followed testimony before

perations against the FBl and its officials.

Secondly, you know and I know,

as a former congressional

investigator,

that each and every witness is interviewed by

committee staff members long before he formally appears before

the committee.

For the life of me I

cannot understand why

a reputable and responsible congressional committee would

allow testimony to be put on the record when it had already

been denied by officials of the FBI and was, in fact, untrue.

I refer, for

example, to statements made by Mr. Rowe

last week.

This

Nation is in grave danger of having its greatest

law enforcement agency (FBI) unnecessarily destroyed based

at least partially, untrue and/or unsubstantiated statements

of witnesses.

•I urge you, Senator, to be fair and judicious. To my

mind the current rash of congressional hearings have not been

that.

Proper and effective law enforcement cannot be realized

without the full voluntary cooperation of the citizens of this

country.

Congressional hearings and the news media are dis-

troying that bond sometimes for nothing more than political

ambition, financial reward or basic dislike of law enforcement

agencies

themselves.

I am taking the liberty of forwarding a copy of this

letter to Senator Tower, my two Senators and my Congressman.

QUESTIONS AND RISCONSES RE: FIONAS RIHA

1. Q. Was Mrs. Moria (Calya) Tannenbaum of Denver and Coulder,

Colarado, ever employed directly or indirectly by the INS?

When?

In what eapacity?

A. A thorough search of all retrievable personnel records for

the U. S. Inmigration and Naturalization Service (INS) dis-

closed no record of a lirs. Cloria (Calya) Tannenbaum nee

Forest, having ever been employed directly or indirectly by

2. Q. l'as Nirs. Jannenbaun ever hired by INS in connection with the

visa status of Riha's wife, Mrs. Hann Riha, formerly lana

Frushkava or licuahkovnova?

A. Hirs. Tannenbaum was never hired by INS In connection with the

visa status of Riha's wife, Mrs. Hana Riha nee Trushkova.

3. Q.

What inquiry was made by John I. Todd, INS District Director

in Denver, after he received a call early on the morning

of larch 9, 1969, involving s disturbance et the Thomas Riho

home in Boulder, Colorado?

The disturbance involved Pila,

I'rs. Trinenboun and Mirs. Inna Riha and ether placed in Mrs. Riha's

bedrcom, apparently to overcone her.

A thorough review of officinl Jarvice files C-7 105 013 (Thomas

Riha) and A14 627 222 (lana Riha) contains no written materini

indicating that then District Director John L. Todd (now retired)

had received a call early on the morning of Farch 9, 1969, rela-

ting to a disturbance occurring at the home of Thomas Rihn, involv-

ing Mrs. Tannenbaum, Mrs. Unna Riha and her husband Thomas.

This

does not necessarily mean that he did not receive such a enll but

merely that he made no written record of sume, if in fact he

received such & call.

Irrespective of such a call, the immigration status of Mrs. Mena

Itha was already a matter of Service inquiry initiated by the

New York office of INS predicated upon a sixth preference petition

filed in her behalf as a secretary, to sustain an application she

filed seeking to adjust her imnigration status to that of a lawful

permanent resident alien,

During the pendency of processing this

application, Mrs. liha had received an extension of her temporary

stay to October 20, 1968, to complete a period of prectical training.

## Page 23

- 2 .

On January 23, 1969, the New York offfce of this Service

addresaed a request

to Hana Riha to appear for an inter-

view on February 5, 1969.

This letter was returned to the

New York office bearing an endorsement by flana Riha's aunt

advising of Hena's marriage to a U. 3. citizen on October 13,

1968, and her current address in Boulder, Golorado. Accord-

ingly, the Service file was transferred to the Denver office

for continuance of this inquiry.

The Service file of Mrs, lana Rtha contains a hand written

memorandum dated March 7, 1969, indicating a Mrs. Tonnenbnum

had called regarding this case.

Tannenbaum wanted to know

whit was necessary for approval of an Immediate relative visa

petition.

tannenbaum wonted to get it done right away since

the husband (Thomas Riha) was getting a divorce from the niten

(lana Riha), Also of record in this file are typewritten let-

ters addressed to the Denver office dated March & and 2, 1969,

respectively and bearing a signature "Hana Riha" in which the

wilter, among other matters, designates Mrs. Tannenbaum as the

person she desires to handle her business with the Immigration

Service and that all correspondence relating thereto be directed

to Tannenbaum's home address.

Cumulatively these letters allege that her marriage to Thomas

Riha was induced by her Aunt, Mrs. Gressnan, as i reans of

circumventing the immigration laws and establishing permanent

residence status in the U. S. although she cleims she is un-

decided as to whether in fact she desires to remain in the

United States.

4. Q. What were the findings of Todds inquiry?

A. Iredicated upon the referenced letters (supra) and the fact

that Mrs. Riha had overstayed her lawful admission, to wit,

October 20, 1968, Mistrict Director Todd approved an ep, lies-

tion for an Order to Show Cause prepared by a Service invas-

tigator on March 10, 1969, and on March Il, 1969, issued and

signed an Order to Show Cause and Notice of Hearing on Mrs. Niha

charging her with being subject to deportation pursuent to the

provisions of Section 241(a)(2) of the Immigration and Nationa-

Ifty Act, in that, after admission as # nonimmigrant, she had

remained in the United States for a longer time than permitted.

This Order and Notice were served on Mrs. Riha by registered

mail on March 11, 1969, directing her to appear for a hearing

before a Special Inquiry Office on the charges, to be held at

the Denver INS office at 2:00 P.M., Tuesday, March 25, 1969.

March 21, 1969, the Denver office received a registered letter

dated March 20, 1969, with enclosure in the form of a Notice

of Appearance as attorney for lana Riha, in which a continuance

of the scheduled deportation hearing was requested and granted.

The file of Hana Rihe contains & menorendum dated April 10,

1969, prepared for the file by then District Director Todd

reporting that at 10:30 P.M. in the evening of April 9, 1969,

he was telephonically contacted at his home by a reporter fron

the staff of the Colorado Daily, Colorado University, Boulder,

Colorado, who advised he was preparing an article for his paper

and desired some assistance.

The reporter stated that a

Mrs. Tannenbaum had informed him that she was employed in some

capacity by the Immigration and Naturalization Service and that

she had the authority to direct what disposition of Mrs. Riha's

case.

The reporter also stated that Professor Riha had disap-

peared two or three weeks before from the University and that

Mrs. Tannenbaum had stated his disapearance was the result of

activities by the secret police of three (3) foreign countries;

that Mes. Tannenbaum also claimed to have access to certain

intelligence information in possession of the military author-

In response to specific inquiries she reporter was ad-

vised: by listrict Director Todd to the effect that (1) a

iirs. Gerald lannenbaum is not and has never been, to his knowl

edge, an employec of INs (2) that he (Todd) had no idea of what

her employment might be and (3) th'it he could give him (the re-

porter) no specific infornation regarding a Professor Riha, the

alleged husband of subject liana kiha.

In conclusion, the memo-

randun suggests that the reporter might desire to contact Mrs. Riha's

attorney since he had already mentioned the name of Mrs. Riha's

attorney during the course of the conversation.

5. Qo Were these findings cormunicated to the GIA and the FBI?

1. A menorandur dated April 11, 1969, prepared by then Deputy Dis-

trict Director Lloyd D. Frowell and addressed to the file of

Jana Riha reports that on April 10, 1969, Provell telephonically

contacted the Assistant gent in Charge of the Danver office of

the Federal Bureau of Investigation and provided him with the

substance of the information contained in District Director Todd's

memorendum of April 10, 1969, (supra) and implies that such agent

was requested to advise whether a contemplated investigation by

INS would interfere with any actions which might be under consideration

by the FBI.

On April 11, 1969, the Assistant Agent in Charge of the

Denver FBI office

telephonically edvised Mr. Prowell that

his office had a pending investigation on les. Tennenbaun

for alleged numerous impersonations of federnl officials,

but that investigation by IlS would not interfere with their

operations in this matter. He requested, however, that upon

completion of any investigation by IN3, his office be fur-

nished a copy of the teport.

Investigation was initinted on Eans Niha the same dato.

(April 11, 1969) A report of this investigation was prepared

on April 23, 1969, and a copy of same wes provided to the Den-

ver office of the FBI pursuant to their request. No distri-

bution of this report was made to the CIA.

TOPIC: SEPARATION OF INTELLIGENCE GATHERING FROM LAW

ENFORCEMENT FUNCTIONS

The question has been raised regarding the

feasibility of separating the intelligence gathering function of

the FBI from the law enforcement function of the FBI.

The functions of the FBI do not neatly fall within

"intelligence" and "law enforcement" categories. Internal security

cases are both intelligence and law enforcement operations and

counterintelligence sometimes involves arrests and prosecutions,

i.e., law enforcement. Thus, the functions of the FBI can more

accurately be broken down into three general missions - law

enforcement, internal security (domestic), and counterintelligence

(foreign). These missions are separate, distinct, and distinguishable

functions, even though each partakes a little of each other.

While counterintelligence could adequately, and with

more success in some cases, be handled by an organization totally

separate from one with law enforcement powers, internal security

work in many cases, is directly related to criminal prosecution.

Complete separation, at least of the internal security function from

law enforcement, does not appear to be practically feasible.

## Page 37

Separation of the internal security function also

presents serious political considerations. Internal security is

the most controversial of government's intelligence collection

activities. In the U.S., this function was originally given to the

FBI which had established for itself a reputation for being respon-

sible, competent, and most importantly, politically neutral and had

the confidence of most Americans. It is to the advantage of an

internal security agency, which is subjected to political pressures,

to be somewhat insulated by being part of a larger, respected

organization which has a high profile as a competent and fair

investigative agency in the less politically complex law enforcement

and counterintelligence fields. Adding to this insulation is the

tradition of FBI political independence, and the new Congressional

concern with keeping the FBI politically independent. While the law

enforcement and counterintelligence wings of the FBI dislike the

controversies into which its internal security wings drag the FBI name,

separation of internal security into a separate agency would probably

subject it to more intense political pressures, both from within the

administration and without, which pressures it might not be capable

of withstanding. Such separation appears politically unfeasible and

undesirable.

NW 65360 Docld:32989554 Page 37

---

## Page 38

Separation of the counterintelligence function would be

more practically feasible; however, the commingling of counterintelli-

gence and internal security interests and the threat of a merger of

the counterintelligence function with the positive foreign intelligence

collection agency, especially in the U.S., are both practical and

political reasons militating against this course.

Practical considerations against divestiture of the

counterintelligence and internal security functions from the FBI are

that: basic criminal investigative experience equips men in many

areas to be intelligence officers; a pool of trained criminal investi-

gators is available to the intelligence missions to draw from, either on

an ad hoc emergency basis, e. g., seizure of an embassy or political

kidnapping or skyjacking, or as candidates for the position of intelli-

gence officer; a divestiture might result in the loss to the counterintelli-

gence and internal security wings of the effective use of the FBI name,

reputation, and contacts/sources built-up over the years using the FBI

name.

All members of the intelligence community have specific

responsibilities defined by statutes and executive orders. The FBI

maintains close daily liaison with other agencies to insure against

repetition or overlapping activities. The Congress and the Executive

Branch, in establishing intelligence agencies such as the Central

Intelligence Agency (CIA), National Security Agency, FBI, etc., must

have considered the need to keep each agency's functions separate.

The CIA, for example, is specifically prohibited from having any

internal security or law enforcement functions. For this reason, in

addition to consideration of experience, efficiency and economy, the

FBI recommends that all three missions of law enforcement, internal

security, and counterintelligence remain with the FBI.

TOPIC:

THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE FBI DIRECTOR

TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

The FBI, through Congressional enactment, Executive Order,

and directive of the Attorney General has been charged with the responsi-

bility of performing certain duties subject to the general supervision and

direction of the Attorney General. The Director of the FBI, a Bureau chief

within the Department, having been granted enormous responsibility, must

attain a proper balance between independence and responsiveness in order

to properly discharge this responsibility.

The Director of the FBI must be permitted to discharge his

responsibilities free from political or unethical pressure. This must be

balanced with his responsibility to remain responsive to the Attorney

General's leadership and direction. A Congressional oversight committee,

available to give the FBI counsel, guidance, and direction, can greatly

assist the FBI in achieving and maintaining this balance.

DATEILIS

There must be an efficient working relationship, with free and

open channels of communication, between the Director and the Attorney

General. However, the FBI Director must also on occasion communicate

directly with the President and members of the Congressional oversight

committee. The Director must be in a position to register reasoned

disagreement with the Attorney General and if the situation dictates, to

take up important matters of disagreement with the President and the

Congressional over sight committee.

TOPIC:

THE ASSIGNMENT OF FBI AGENTS TO FOREIGN

LIAISON POSTS

The FBI has had FBI Agents serving in foreign liaison posts

since 1940. They are known as Legal Attaches and are regularly called

upon to secure in-depth cooperation from foreign agencies on criminal

and security matters which are frequently of a complicated and sensitive

nature. In order to handle such matters effectively, it is often required

that a Legal. Attache be proficient in the language of the foreign country

involved and should have some familiarity with the culture, customs and

judicial processes. Simultaneously, it is obviously advantageous to have

a thorough knowledge of FBI jurisdiction, regulations, and policies. This

knowledge can only be achieved through years of experience as an FBI

Agent.

In order to maintain the cooperation of foreign agencies, Legal

Attaches assist these agencies by having investigations conducted in the

United States concerning matters of interest to the foreign countries

involved.

Several options in lieu of maintaining FBI Agents in foreign

countries have been suggested. These include the assignment of Embassy

personnel to handle FBI work, to have FBI interests abroad handled by

other law enforcement agencies which maintain foreign liaison offices,

NW 65360 Docld:32989554 Page 41

## Page 42

and the discontinuance of FBI pursuit of foreign ramifications in criminal

and security responsibilities.by FBI personnel and conduct the investigations

through direct communications. All of these alternatives pose serious

problems including security risks, lack of expertise and knowledge of

FBI procedures and policies, etc.

The FBI has found it necessary and, in fact, through experience

it has been demonstrated it is invaluable to have a man stationed abroad

who can insure that prompt and efficient action is taken and that cooperative

relationships are nurtured and protected. Accomplishments attained by

the FBI through the liaison activities of the Legal Attaches with foreign

law enforcement agencies have been numerous, and it is firmly believed

that these successes would not have occurred in the absence of personal

and direct FBI liaison with foreign police agencies.

The FBI currently has Agents stationed in 15 American

diplomatic establishments outside the United States.

TOPIC:

THE FBI AS AN INDEPENDENT AGENCY

The proposal to make the FBI an independent agency within

the Executive Branch has been voiced on several occasions in Congress.

Approximately one year ago, two bills were introduced in the Senate to

achieve this aim.

Proponents of this proposal indicate their basis for supporting

this approach is because of their concern to have the FBI free from political

influence. They cite as an argument the fact the Attorney General is almost

always a political appointee of the President whose views generally conform

with his own.

The question arises whether removal of the FBI from the

Department of Justice is the proper means of assuring a justifiable degree

of independence and freedom from undue political pressure. The FBI as

an independent agency would simply mean the Director would no longer

report to the Attorney General but instead would be responsible directly

to the White House.

Opponents of the proposed Senate bills suggest that some danger

does exist in the FBI's reporting to a political appointee, but a far greater

danger may exist if the FBI, performing as an independent agency, became

the arm of a politically motivated Director who was primarily responsible

to the White House.

Blaine K. Katz, Richard G. Kinsey, William J. Lander,

Rodney K. McHargue, William F. Moran, Altred K. Nicholas, Jr.,

Richard H. Ross,

. John P. Thomas, and John A. Van Wagenen.

At approximately 7:00 p.m. on Saturday evening,

10/4/75, I received a call from Special Agent Paul V. Daly

of the

Legal Counsel Division. Mr. Daly advised that the

Attorney General (AG) had requested the Bureau immediately

prepare a list of electronic surveillances conducted by the

Bureau from 1/1/70 until 6/30/75. In addition, the AG

requested that the supportive documents underlying these

electronic surveillance requests also be provided him. Both

the list and supportive documents were to be on the desk of

the AG by 9:00 a.m., 10/6/75.

After a series of calls, arrangements were made

with the Files and Communications Division to begin pulling

the necessary files needed to prepare the list and provide

the supportive documents.

At 9:30 a.m., the above-named

Bureau supervisors reported to the Intelligence Division

where they worked steadily, without taking time out for lunch

or dinner until approximately 9:00 p.m., developing the

necessary information and documents responsive to the AG's

request.

Miss Winslow and Miss Dodge, secretaries in the

Intelligence Division, along with Miss Simmons and Mrs. Weldon,

typists in the Intelligence Division, reported for work at

approximately 11:00 a.m. These 4 young ladies worked contin-

uously through the afternoon and well into the evening hours

preparing the necessary communications for the AG. Not only

did they perform in an admirable fashion but they exhibited

an outstanding attitude and suffered considerable physical

exhaustion prior to their departure for the day at approximately

Re: Senstudy 75

10:00 p.m. Without the outstanding performance of these

4 young ladies, it would have been impossible for this

Division to meet the AG's deadline.

It is interesting to note that the Intelligence

Division was successful in meeting the deadline and had

the necessary material available for the AG at 9:00 a.M.,

on the morning of 10/6/75.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

In view of the outstanding manner in which

L. Patricia

• Simmons, Christine A. Weldon, Gerry L. Winslow

and Mary E. Dodge performed, it is recommended that each

receive a letter of commendation from the Director.

2. That a general letter of commendation be sent

the Assistant Director, Intelligence Division, for the manner

in which Bureau supervisors in the Intelligence Division

performed and that a copy of that general letter be designated

for the personnel files of those Bureau supervisors mentioned

in the first paragraph of this memorandum.

"In such case there are several courses of action open

to the people.

Political organization to vote out the traitors

and vote in the patriots is one.

Pressure by personal appeals;:

petitions, letters and telegrams is another. But the time cones

when the enemy, feeling strong and secure enough, shamelessly

ignores these efforts o the people, and makes ready to replace

constitutional governuent with socialistic tyranny openly and

quickly.

Then there is yet another course of action left:

the

organization of a poweriul, armed resistance force to defeat the

aims of the usurpers and bring about a return of constitutional

government.

"The formation of such a nation-wide force, under the

SECONd ELLiOLE OI the

purpose of preventing a communistic takeover of their beloved

country, with the to.al loss of their freedon, cannot fail to

At their reguest,

I met today (12/5/75) with

"Dallas Times Herald" Staff Writers Hugh Aynesworth and

Bob: Dudney.

luring a discussion on another mattes, the

subject of Martin luther King, Jr., came up and they referred

to two general allegations about King: (1) Allegedly, King

received money from a man in New Jersey who was connected

with the Communist Party, USA (CPUSA), tho had received

money from the Soviet Union of had other Soviet connections.

(2) King may have been in the posture of submitting speeches

he intended to give to high CPUSA officers In New York Clty

prior to his making the speeches. The writers asked me

for any official comment I could make on this matter.

On the basis of the sparse information stated

by the writers, it appears likely that they were referring

to the following two situations which were documented in

our files:

(1) King's principal advisor

was the secret

CPUSA member, Stanley David Levison, who lived and had

business connections in the New York-New Jersey area and

who was deeply involved in the funds operations of

che CPUSA,

including funds from the Soviet Union.

(2) King received

advice and help from levison and other comministsin respect

to verious aspects of king's work,

Re:

Particularly concerning speeches, Levison was frequently

assisting and may have actually written some of King's

speeches,

and he also counseled King on acceptence or

nonacceptence of speech commitments.

There have also been

Indications that other CPUSA officials nay have assisted

King on speech matters in a like manner.

It should be noted that most all information in

these to areas originated from our Solo

formants and

we have closely guarded such information

Ahese matters

were part of our recent (11/5/75) very special briefing of

Senator Church of the Senate Select Committee (SSC) and

selected of his Steff Members.

He should also recognize

that over the years there have been many press accounts

relating to King's communist connections and some of the

information discussed above might well have been publicized;

but perhaps in modified form.

For example, Levison's name

hes beeri publicized as being the person who was an

important advisor to King.

During my testiltony before the SSC on 11/19/75,

I responded to a question from Senator Church, when

discussing the King Investigation, as follows:

Re:

Martin Lucher King,

Jr.

100-106670

OBSERVATIONS:

We may anticipate that the current injuiry from

the "Dallas Times Herald

writers is but one of many

sinilar inquiries ve will be receiving concerning our king

investigation. Because of the very sensitive aspects involved,

It is belteved that we should make no public comments

concerning the king Investigation but merely refer eny.

inquiries to the already public record of my testimony.

In other words,

we need only to refer laquiztes to that

testimony which in substance says,

,"*Ve had a firm basis

for the investigation of King.

However, fox reasons of

national security and ongoing investigations, we are unable

to provide any specifics."

RECOMMENDATION:

Accordingly, it is recommended that in respect

o the current inquiry and future similar ones, we respond

as suggested immediately above under observations. Upon

approval, this memorandum should be returned to me and I

will appropriately advise the "Dallas Tines Herald" vriters.

Attorney General's February 27, 1975 Testimony

regarding iBi Operations

In his february Ll, 1915 testimony before the Edwards •

Committee regarding FBI intormation-gathering practices, the

Attorney General gave certain assurances, most of which

seem to

be addressed by the FBI guidelines. These include assucances

that:

1. An examination would be made of the practice. of

collecting information on individuals, including Congressmen

(TI. p. 6) .

2. An attempt would be made to devise a procedure to

screen unsolicited materials to be retained by the TBI, or

to periodically review them to determine whether they should

be setained (Ir. 16-17).

3. Director Kelley and his associates do not maintain

files on specific individuals in their offices which might be

considered "dossiers"

(Ir. 24). Conficmation that this remains

true today might be obtained.

4. Measures would be taken to minimize the opportunity

for the FBI to be misused (Ir. 24).

5. Director Kelley was directed to report to the Attor-

ney General practices of requests to the FBI which are or may

appear to be improper (IT. 27-23).

This direction was repeated

in July, 1975.

The FBI documents informing the Bureau of this

policy

should be obtained.

Instances in which matters con-

cerning actual or apparent impropriety have been reported to

the Attorney General should be listed.

6. Consideration would be given to an Executive Order

to limit the authority in the White House to make requests

(Ty. 28) to the EBI to a few highly placed White House officials

7. Consideration would be given to the scope and effect

of the Executive Order which requires the FBI to report to the

heads of executive departments and the Civil Service Com-

mission unverified allegations relevant to the character

of government employees (Is. 29).

8. If the guidelines were complete, the Attorney

General would be delighted to announce them (Ir. 35).

9. Consideration would be given to whether a member

of Congress should be

permitted to review FBI files concern-

ing him not compiled in an investigation authorized by statute

and, if he wishes, order the destruction of those files (Ir. 86).

SUBjECT: Attorney General's SSC testimony regaräing the FBI --

Meeting with SSC Staff

• On November 24, 1975 Doug Marvin, Jack Fuller, Mike Shaheen,

Ray Hornblower and I net with John Ellift and Mark Gittenstein

of the SSC staff to discuss tha Attorney General's testimony

regarding the FBI now scheduled for December 10, 1975.

The SSC has already had public testimony concerning the

FBI from its staff and Jim Adams. It plans to have two days

of relevant hearings next week, one on the F3. informant pro-

gram and another on Department of Justice supervision of

the

FBI. On the latter subject, the SSC hopes to have as witnesses

former FBI officials Sullivan and DeLoach and former Attorneys

General. Rogers, Katzenbach and Clark.

During the week of December 1, 1975, the SSC proposes to

hear public testinony from Williams Ruckelshaus, Henry Petersen,

and Joseph Califano on FBI domestic intelligence activities,

Clarence Kelley on the impace certain proposals would have on

the FBI, and the Attorney General on controlling the FBI. The

SSC may also request executive

session

testimony from the Altor-

ney General on the FBI's activities relating to foreign intelli-

gence.

Gittenstein and Elliff described 5 areas which the SSC would

like to discuss publicly with the Attorney General. These are:

1. The legal authority for FBI domestic intelligence activities,

including whether President Roosevelt had the authority to

initiate the program and, if so, whether his authorization

was properly construed by the FBI.

King, and whether the FBI manual or the proposed guidelines

would permit activities directed against such groups today

or in the future. ALI INFORMATION CONTAINED

nou

3.

Whether "preventive action" is ever appropriate and, if so,

how it should be controlled.

4..

Whether the Department, the President or Congress has given

the FBI adequate guidance on what individuals or groups

constitute internal security threats with which it should

be concerned and whether there is regular review by anyone

to reevaluate the current danger presented by an individual

or group previously designated as an internal security threat.

5.

Whether guidance given to the FBI is being followed and how

this can be assured. Related quastions include whether the

IBI can properly investigate itself, whether the Department

of Justice should have an Inspector

General, and whether GAO

should be involved in regularly auditing FBI activities.

In the course of discussion, Elliff and Gittenstein alluded

to several other questions which might be raised. These include:

1. Should internal security activities be permitted at all, or

can what Elliff called the "Stone Standard" be readopted?

2. The question raised by the Martin Luther King case of what

degree of suspected or actual connection with a foreign

government should be required to trigger surveillance or

investigation of a domestic group? How should "infiltration"

be defined?

3. How does a domestic intelligence investigation differ from

a criminal investigation and can

the differences be justified?

4. Should there be a statute explicitly authorizing and limit-

ing domestic intelligence activities? If so, what should be

authorized?

5.

What happens to information compiled in the course of unlaw

ful surveillances or activities initiated on the basis of

reasonable beliefs which prove to be unfounded?

Elliff asked whether the proposed FBI guidelines could be dis-.

tributed to members of the SSC and used as a basis for discussion

at the hearings.

We indicated we would consider this request.

SUBJECT:

Questions suggested by FBI testimony of SSC

Staff and Jin Adams

-

Mika Shaheen's office is preparing a synopsis of the

testimony regarding the fBl presented on November 18 and 19,

1975 by the SSC staff and Jim Adams.

In my view, the staff

testimony suggests several areas of interest to the SSC, listed

below, which may be discussed with the Attorney General when

he testifies.

1. The SSC questions the value of investigation and sur-

veillance of domestic groups believed to be extremist or sub-

versive.

According to its staff, the GAO attempted to evaluate

activities (Ir. 1605).

They found that of 675

cases

reviewed, oniy 16 had been

referred for prosecution; resulting

in 4 convictions.

In addition, in only 12 of these cores did

the GAO find "that the FBT gained

any advance knowledge of

planned activities,

and 51 percent of those cases revealed no

association with objectionable organizations or no illegal

objectionable activities" (Tr. 1605). Thus,

the

staff concludes

that surveillance of domestic groups has had little prosecutorial

or intelligence value and questions whether such activities should

ever be conducted in view of the costs and risk of abuse they

involve.

2.

The SSC staff believes

that important FBI documents

were included in the

• "personal files" of J. Edgar Hoover which

were destroyed after his death (Tr. 1608). They believe that

Hoover had reviewed the personai tiles lettered A to C and

transferred some official documents from these to the OC files.

However, files lettered D through 2 were not reviewed in this

manner

and the staff presumes that some official documents were

lost when these files were destroyed. The SSC believes that

the FBI unintentionally gave the Attorney General an incom-

plete report on this matter which suggested that no FBI docu-

ments were destroyed. This report was later transmitted to

• the SSC.

3. Senator Tower believes that attention should be paid

to the use of informants, a form of information-gathering which

does not require judicial or Department of Justice approval

(Tr. 1617).

-2 .

4. Interest has been expressed in whether the counter-

espionage and internal security functions of the Bureau should

be separated within the FBI or handled by different organiza-

tions to reduce the risk that techniques appropriate to counter-

espionage will be improperly employed against domestic groups

(TI. 1636).

5. The 1971 FBI document ending Cointellpro stated that

"In exceptional instances where it is considered counter-

intelligence action is warranted, recommendation should be

submitted to the Bureau under the individual case caption" (Ir.

1651). Thus, it may be asked whether there have been any such

requests since 1971 and, if so, whether any were aprpoved.

6. The SSC staff believes that the history of the "Security

Index" is an excellent example of the problems of oversight and

relationships between the FBI, the Department and Congress

• (Tr. 1663).

7. In 1973 the FBI asked the Department to seek statu-

tory authorization for domestic intelligence activities and

such authority has not to date been sought (Tr. 1675).

8.

The FBI procedure of reporting by an "INLET" letter

items with an unusual twist or concerning prominent individuals

was discontinued because there were better means of communicating

"dirt" to headquarters for dissemination to the White House

(Tr. 1707) .

This

raises the question of whether agents are

still

expected to furnish such information to

wha, If not, when it was stopped. If it has

headquarters

not been stopped,

type of information is now forwarded and what is done with

it?

The Prosidont's Commission on Campos Throt in dotailing "the las enforce-

are men and women who plot, all too often successlulls, to burn and bomb, and

sometimes to maim and kill. The police must attempt to determine whether or

not such a plot is in progress, and, if it is, they thurt attempt to thwart it."

Finally, Allan C. Brownfold, a faculty member at the Cniversity of Maryland.

writing in

"Christian Economics," February 11, 1970, on "The New Loft and

the Polities of Confrontation" noted that "in many instances, those extremists

tho hare fomented disorder have bern in violation of state and Federal statutes."

But, Air. Brosmoid noted. What is ofien missing is the will to prose aud

to bring such individuals betore the bar of justice." Air. Brownfed's article

was subcaptioned "A Society Which Will Not Defend Itself Against Anachists

Cannot Long Surrire."

IY, APPROPRIATIONS TESTIMOXY

On February 10, 1966, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover testified regarding the

Ku Klux Klan, saying that "the Bureau continues its brogram of penetrating

the Klan at all levels and, i may say,

has bean quite successiul in doing so.

The Bureau's role in penetrating the Klan has receired public attention due to

the solution of the brutal murders of Viola

Luisao in Alabama, Lieutenant

Colonel Lemuel A. Penn in Georgia and the three civil sights workers in Mis-

sissippi. We have achieved a number of other tangible accomplishments in ihis

held, most of which are not publicly knewu but are most signilicant." Discussion

oft the record followed.

V. PUBLIC SUPPONT OF TILE CUCNTERINTELTIGENCE PROGRAM

Folloning acknowledgement that the FBI had a connierintelligence program,

syndicated columnist Victor Kiesel wrote on June 15, 1973, "no apolozies are due

from those in the hirhost arthority for secretly developing a damoric counter-

revolutionary intellicence stratarom in carly 1970." Mr. Riesel derailen the record

of "dead students," ' university libraries la flames," and "insensate taurdering o1

cops," and concluded "it would have been wrone not to nave are satra to contier

the sheer off-fue-rall terrorism of the 1939-70 bomb sassons. And it would be

wrong today. No one need apologize for counterrevolctionary acticl."

On June 1S, 1074. Eugeno al. Mothrin, Sonior Eritor. "The Reader's Digest,"

testifed before the House Committre on Forcion Affairs regrading terrorism and

noted, ".

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE: INTERVIEW OF FORMER FBI ASSISTANT DIRECTOR THOMAS E. BISHOP

BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS

NOTE:

Mr. Bishop's report of the interview was set

out in his personal letter of 12/4/75 to Supervisor Seymor

Phillips of the Senstudy 75 Project. Mr. Bishop asked

that the letter be carefully edited. This was done to

omit those portions which were irrelevant to the interview

nt were personal comments to Mr. Phillips. In those

instances where it was unclear as to whether Mr. Bishop

was reporting what he said during the interview

or was

merely commenting parenthetically, the portions were also

omitted. Legal Counsel memorandum to Mr. J. B. Adams

11/28/75 captioned "Senstudy 75" prepared by PVD:dkg

recommended releasing Bishop from any existing employment

agreements for purposes of the SSC interview.

In his letter to Mr. Phillips, Mr. Bishop, under

that portion captioned "The Ehrlichman Teletype," also

wrote, ".. this was the matter in which Pat Gray tried

to shaft me by telling the newspapers that the handling of

this matter had been done by me without authority, without

action on it by felt and that felt, David Kinley and

Pat Gray had all approved the handling of it. Of course,

when 'Life' Magazine printed a critical story about it,

on me. I challenged him on it quite vigorously and, in fact,

this was the thing that finally made me realize that I

should retire from the Bureau because Gray was playing

politics and using the Bureau to do so."

On 11-25-75 Gordon Rhea, staff member of the

Senate Select Committee, requested that former Assistant

Director of the Crime Records Division, Thomas E. Bishop,

be released from existing employment agreements for the

purpose of a staff interview by that Committee relating to

• the operations of the Crime Records Division and the "mass

media program."

Rhea stated he had obtained the current

address for Mr. Bishop and was going to contact him immediately.

Rhea indicated that the current intentions of the Committee

are to have Cartha DeLoach testify on the 3rd of December

publicly before that Committee and they desired to interview

Bishop prior to that appearance.

On 11-26-75 former Assistant Director Bishop

telephonically advised SA Paul V. Daly of this Division

Committee and requested to appear at that Committee's offices

for interview. Bishop stated he told Rhea he agreed to

appear on the evening. of 12-1-75 and the day of 12-2-75.

to appear in public session before captioned Committee with

former Assistant to the Director Cartha DeLoach.

He stated,

however, that no decision had been made at that time regaraing

such an appearance. Mr. Bishop was advised of the fact that

the Bureau had pledged cooperation to this Committee and

the request would be made for the Assistant Director to be

released from existing employment agreements for purposes of the

interview by that Committee. Additionally, he was informed

that his appearance was, of course, a voluntary one and that

if he felt there was a need for legal representation, he

should so advise the Bureau.

He was generally advised of the

San Diego, Cal.

December 4, 1975

Mr. Seymour Phillips

FBI

Washington, DO

Dear Seymour:

In accordance with your request, I am going to try

to set down - very briefly -- some of the items dealt with during

my appearance before the Senate Select Committee in Intelligence

Avtivities on December 2, 1975. I am a very poor typist and can't

possibly remember all the

matters discussed with me, so you will

have to bear with me.

First of all, I Mas sworn in by sen. Schweiker, who

only stayod for a very brief time. I was interviewed froa 9AM

to a bout 5 PM, with Gordon Rhea, Assistant to the Chief Counsel,

Frederick Baron, Assistant to the Chief Counsel, and Barbara

Banoff, Counsel, present during the entire questioning, and with

Joseph diGenora, Counsel, participating during the morning session,

and John ElifI, Head of the Domestic Task Force, participating

in the afternoon.

Let me say at the outset that it was a protty grueling

experience, not because I couldn't handle the questions they

threw at me, but because of the sheer length of the session and

because I had absolutely no prior knowledge of what memos, docu

ments, ete they were to throw at me. I do think that the Bureau

• doos

a disservice to former employees who have been out of the Bureau

for some tine and who have to appear before the Commityee, by not

giving them some idea of the areas of questioning that will be juni

facod with and some clues as to what old memos, ete thay will be

callod upon to explain.

Now, gotting back to my questioning -- they first

wanted me to give them a detailed acoount of just what duties the

Crime records Division periormed. this included every function

performed by the front office, as well as each and every thing that

each of the sctions ind did. They were particularly Interested

In the handling of press matters -- whether we played any favorites

among papers in giving out news stories, exactly what type of in-

formation we gave out to the press, etc. Naturally, I told them

we playod no favoritos but that I naturally knew personally what

papers and reportes were favorably disposed toward the Bureau and

which were prejudiced against us and that this was in my mind

in dealing with the press. I stressed to them that we always

strictly followed the Attorney General's Guidelines on what

could and could not be given to the news media on criminal cases

and that only information of a strictly public source naturo was

over given to any newsman in other types of cases. I carefully

explained to them what public source data is and diffarentiated

It from Information developed by interviews, or info from

techniques.

I also stressed to them that we never withheld

Irom any newspaper, reporter, radio or IV network any info

which they had a right to know about no matter how antagonistic

or anti-FBI the paper, IV or radio ntework ar the reporter

might be.

Now getting to some of the topics which they went into

in depth.

MASS MEDIA PROGRAM

The showed me dozens of memos pfepared by the Dom. Intell.

Dit, under this program

all of which recommended that the Crime

Records Div. give Info to tar selected newspapers or publications

which Info reflocted unfavorably on certain individuals or

organizations. Many of these memos related to M.L. King, other

racial leaders, and racial organizations. It was obvious that

they didn't think much of this program and thought of it as

harrassment. Theu wanted me to justify each of the memos. I pointod

out to them that they dod not originate in the Crime Records

Div. and that I therefore did not think that it was up to me to

justify them. I pointed out the the role of the Crime Reoords Div

was to merely serve as a condult to get the infonation prepared

by the Dom Intell Div to the reporter, that the infonation

to bo passed by us to a reporter was compiled by the Dom Intell

Div and that the approval of the action proposed by the memos

was in most sages complotod beforo the memo oven came to us. I

also pointed out that, in sach of the memos thaey showed me, the

tout that, In cada

Information to be passed to the press was of a strictly public

source nature, and that none of the information could be considered

confidential

_CONINTELPRO

They showed me a lot of memos prepared by the Dom Intel

Div under this program which also recommended giving certain into

to certain reporters abour selocted Individuals and groups. I told

them that, as far as the Crime Records Div was concerned, these

were handled the same as these under the Mass Media Program and

that all of my replies and explanations ubder that

caption (above)

also applied to this program.

DO NOT CONTACT LIST

They wanted to know all about the handling of this.

I told them, and also explained there was nothing sinister about

it and that it was merely to keep our agents from wasting their

time contacting people during investigations who had clearly

indicated that they did not wish to be contacted, and also to keep

our agents from being insulted or vilifled repeatedly by people &

They seemed satistied thi the DNA list was in no was a

SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTS LIST

I had to explain this in detail - its purpose, how a

person got included on the list, han what publications, eto, were

sent to people on the list, etc. It appeared my explanations satis-

fied them.

WHITE HOUSE NAME CHECKS

This was gone into pretty thondaghly. In answer to a

question, I told them that we generally knew from the list of names

on which checks were being asked what was the reason for the name

check request (because the list whold generally indicate a date on

which a function was being hold at the White Hous to whith the y

people on the list had been invited; I told them, however, that we

would still handle the name check even tuzzk though we did not

know why it was requested. They tried to make something out of that

but gave up after I pointed out how ridiculous it would be 1f the

FBIrefused to give the President a summary of data in a our files

on a person unless he first told us why he wanted it.

CONGRESSIONAL FILES

I had to give them a detailed explation of this -- what

Info we collected from the field offices on newly elected

gressmen and Senators, what we did with the info, what we used it

for, otc. I frankly thought that they would go into this in even

more detail than they did. They seemed to back off from it when

I explained that the chief purpose of the Congressional Files was

to assist me in handling liaison with the Senate and House-- that

I wanted to know which Congressmen and Senators were crooks, lushes,

libertines, ete because I certainly wouldn't trust anyone like

that. I said I could give them some specitio, horrible examples,

- the record.

LEONARD BOUDIN

He was the attornet for dr, Spock during the latter's

trial. He has a long history of CP Associations • During the trial

a memo was written setting out all the public source data known

on him and it was recormended that it be given to a friendly news-

man. they want ted to know why this was proposed, whother the info

In lact given to a newsman at that time, and it we made a

practice oi giving out derogatory data on attorneys for defendants

in Bureau cases. I told them we must have been askod for public

source data by a newsman and that's why the memo was written, I also

showed them notations written on the mamo which specifically

prohibited tha data beibg given out while the trial was in progres

or even until after all appeals in the Spock case were concluded.

THE ERLICHMAN TELERYPE

While I was being interviewed, the Administrative Assistant

to Sen. Phillip Hart, called the staff and asked that I be

requested to make a detailed statement on the record. concerning the

above matter. I was delighted to dos so because trace,, this was

the matter in

which Pat Gray tried to shaft me by telling the

newspapers that the hanaling of this matter had been done by mo

without authority, without the approval of my superiors. The

truth of the metter wast that I had objected to Mark Felt that

the Bureau shouldn't even handle this, I had been specifically

ordered to initiate action on it by Felt, and that Felt, David XX

Kinley and Pat Gray had all appoured the handling of 1t. of

course, when 'Ille Magazine printed a critical story about it, then

B so , ana that o about

Gray started to get scared and tried to dump the blame on me. I

challenged him on it quite vigorously and, in fact, this was

thing that finally made me realize that I should retißo from

the Bureau because Gray was playing politics and using the Bureau

to do so.. Anyway, I put on the record a deatiled explanation

of the handling of this matter and clearly placed the respon-

sibility for It where it belonged. The reason Ses Hart wanted to

got my side of 1t on the record is because Gray, during his con-

firmation hearing, had triod to slip and dodge questions about

this and Sen Haft thought he may have come close to perjury.

BOS ANGELES TIMES AND JACK NELSON

I was

questioned in great detail concerning the Bureau's

relations with the above paper and with Jack Nelson, one of 1t's

Washington based reporters who for some time had been carrying on

a vendetto against.Mc. Hoover and who, on several occasions had

claimed he was out

"get" Mr. Hoover. In 1971 or 1972 the

General Manager of the LA Times came to see Mr. Hooverx and,

before he went in , the Crime Records Division prepared a

detailed memo on our relations with the TIMES and on what we

had in our files on Nelson.

The staff was in possession of

this memo and questioned me intensively about it. I explained why

it was prepared, that it was for interbal use only( I emphasized

this because the staff seemed to think we had planned to give it

to someone outside the Bureau, and explained the whole background

of the Situation. In doing so, I must admit, I took advantage of

the situation to get on the record several times my descriptior

of Nelson as a "drunken s.0.B."

Please elt this cosfylly if you ntend to posse

Well, Seymour, that's about as much as I can recall. &

Besides, my wife is waiting for me to play golg with her. As I

said, It was a long session. I did not, however, on any occasion

over

admit that anything that was done by me, Mr. Hoover or the

Bureau was wrong or improper, even with 20/20 hindsight. I only

wish that some of the Bureau

people who has testified would have

expressed themselves the same way,

RE:

REQUEST FOR INFORJATION CONCERNING

THIS BUREAU'S OPERAXION OF INFORHANTS

IN THE INTERNAE SECURITY FIELD

Reterence is nade to sse letter dated November 1,

1970, requesting a nonorandun on this Bureau's operation of

Informants in the internal secuxity field.

An informant, according to the dictionary, is

"one who gives infornation," In light of this definition,

it is cleax that very few persons, if any, have not at one

time or another been informants.

To give information is an

inseparable part of life. To give accurate, sound and

helpful infornation for a worthy cause is to make one's

Ille more useful and valuable to society.

Infornants of the FBI are persons who furnisa

as a means of attaining justice.

Intoruants clear the

innocent as well as convict the quilty. They serve of their

LAST MON

rong

own free will.

None are forced.

Informants are as old as

the human race.

Their use is international. History is

studded with many and varied examples of the uses of intormants.

No goverment or organized society has been without theil.

Informants provide one of the best and nost complete

forms at coverage to the law enforcement officer. Sonetimes

they are the only means of penetrating subversive or extreaist

organizations.

Informante ate valuable because they obtain

intornation more directly and thus save time and money;

OPERATIONE FITH RESPICT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

The developuent of informants is one of the most

dificult, unique and specialized assignments. Despite

the obstacles encountered in informant development, Bureau

Agents have net and are continuing to meet with steady and

remarkable successes.

They regularly denonstrate vision,

daring and commendable resourcefulness in this work. The

Bureau today we believe has the best infornant coverage in

its history.

When infornation is receivod

or develoged that a

person has background qualifications indicative of Informant

potential, in an area where coverage is needed, a case is

Offico and Headquarters indices are reviowed and

other logical discreet checks are made, including canvass oi

to preliminarily establish the individurl's

backyround, reliability, stability and integrity It the

checke are favorable, the individual

would be

interviowed to establich a personal assessnent by a

Special Agent as to the person's qualifications, potential,

and willingness to assist this Bureau.

If the interview is

positive, additional background investigation is conducted

to establish the persons reliability, stability, and

integrity.

Upon satisfactory conpletion of this investigation,

the individual begins a developuent period with the handling

Agent and alter establishing a proven record of reliability,

stability

and productiveness, becones a leadquarters approved

informant.

The Bureau's informants, particularly in the internal

security tield, have many restrictions imposed upon their

relationship with the sureau.

For example, they are impressed

with the confidential nature of their relationship with the

FBI, that their actions are strictly voluntary and that they

not employees.

If they are connected in any way with a

Labor union, they are informed that the Bureau is not

interested in an emplovee-employer reLationship or 11

connected with an institution of learning, they are specifically

advised that the suroau is not interested in the legitimate

activities of educational institutions, In particular, all

Informants are instructed to avoid knowledge of desense plans

and stratery or discussion thereos with attorneys, subjecis

or other individuals in any prosecution arising fron intelligence

or criminal investigations.

In the event an Informant is

unable to avoid obtaining such inforuation, this infornation

possible, is obtained iron each informant so that the informant

¿s aware of the Burea's position in these natters. (A copy

of the signed stateuent appears herein as Attachment number

one.)

Fron the time Snocial Agents enter New Agent's

Class they are indoctrinated and trained in the legal

aspects of the Bureau's work as well as the scope and

liuits of their authority. The Manual of Rules and

Regulations spocifically addresses the conduct of Special

Agents in their investigative duties.

(see Manual ot Rules

and Regulations Attachment number two.

Training

continues in their offices of assignment, each office having

a Legal Ofticer available for training, consultation and

guidance.

Freguent, extensive in-service retraining

programs

further bolster the special Agents' knowledge and

utilization of the law in the conduct of their official

dutios. Specifically, Infoxmant development and handling

are extensively discussed in the FBI's training prograne

and there is no question as to Special Agents being aware

that informants cannot be directed to perform a function

that the Special Agent may not legally perford.

Special

Agents are particularly reminded of the need to be alert

to plants, potential agent provocateurs to be used against

Law enforcement in a variety of ways, so as to avoid

unfounded allegations of impropriety which may jeopardize

Investigations or prosecutions as well as result in highly

publicized contrived incidents reflecting adversely on

law enforcement.

Hony of our informants furnish needed and valuable

infornation on a gratuitous basis. Many are also paid for

their services. Payments to informants are one of the most

highly supervised areas within Bureau operations, When

a payment is made to an informant, the handling Agent must

make a realistle deteruination as

to the value of theservices

performed by the informant. Established Bureau procedure

requires that payments made to intormants, upon recommendation

of handling Agent and approval of appropriate supervisory

personnel, originate fron the office Field Support Account

and are drawn from this account by check made out to the

handling Agent for the anount authorized. The handling

Informant the authorized anount in cash for which a receipt

Is received from the informant and maintained in FBI

files. Although there is no overall menorandua of instruction

or document dealing with cost efsectiveness an it relates to

inforuants, this factor is considered by the Spechl Agent

Paynents to informants for services are made

U.S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE TO STUDY GOVERNMENTAL

OPERATIONS WITH RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

Concerning warrants, a warrant requizonent for

the use of informants appears

impractical and way be

unconstitutional.

It is impractical because probable cause

usually is not available when the informant technique is

Initiated and the submission of an affidavit in application

Joy a warrant would increase the hazard of exposure of the

infornant's identity. Such a linitation night be unconstitutional

because it would limit the First Amendnent rights of the

Intormant to conmunicate with the Government. Existing Legal

reStriCtions requile guidod Intormants to recognize the sane

Legal limitations as would be applicable, in tile saile CrCu™

stances, to those directing the informants.

An informant can

legally do no more than an Agent is permitted to do.

Tho Bureau in the domestic intelligence area has under

investigation organizations, most of wich have nuerous districts,

regions, offices, sections,

chapters and clubs.

These organiza-

tions and their subdivisions total over 1100, which receive

investigative attention to some extent.

These investigations

are afforded coverage by less than 1100 internal security

Inforuants.

It nust be recognized, however, that there aro

other individuals who aro in various stages of development in

this fleld. Concerning payments, onc-half of one percont (,54)

of the Bureau's budget (fiscal 1975) was utilized to pay nil

typos of security inforwants including those in the foreign

counterintelligence field.

As noted, the bureau's utilization of informante

involves a high degree of care and supervision. It is a

specific Bureau policy that an inforannt nay only be

tcrgeted against individuals or organientions of investigative

intercst to the FBI. It must be recognized, however,

infornants furnisi. a wealth of related intornation vhich

comes to their attention during the course of their assigned

duties.

While operating against assigned targets, the

associations necessary to maintain credibility may lead to

apprehended. Additionally the FBI located 442 persons

and other federal agencies located 21 individuals.

Local and state law enforcement authorities located 94

persons.

During the same time frame, internal security

informants provided information which led directly to

the recovery of property valued at approximatoly one half

million dollars. It must be further recognized that a

warrant reguirement for use of informants would virtually

eliminate access of law enforcenent to this collateral

infornation resulting in many crimes going unsolved or

not prevented.

The FBI believes the elements of close

supervision, restraint,

latitude and judgnent are

essential in an infornant progran and it is further

believed that the proper balance of these elements is

being utilized by the FBI successfully in the operation

of informants in the security field.

Illegal Activities

Illegal activities on the part of any employee, in addition to being

unlawful, reflect on the integrity of the FBI and betray the trust and

confidence placed in it by the American people. Furthermore, unlawful

activities can disqualify him for employment by the Government of the

United States.

It is, therefore, expected that employees will obey not only

the spirit of the law as well whether they be

engaged in transactions of a personal or official nature. With respect to

investigative activities, this admonition particularly applies to entrap-

ment or the use of any other improper, illegal, or unethical tactics in the

procurement of evidence. In this regard; it should be especially noted that,

in securing information concerning mail matter, the Bureau will not

tolerate a violation of law (Iitle 18, USC, $$ 1702, 1703, 1708, and 1709).

Furthermore, employees must not tamper with, interfere with, or

in violation of law nor aid, abet or condone

the opening of

mail illegally

by any employee of the U. S. Postal Service.

As members of a Federal investigative agency, FBI employees must at all

times zealously guard and defend the rights

and liberties guaranteed to

all individuals by the Constitution• Therefore; FBI employees must not

engage in any investigative activity which could abridge in any way the

rights guaranteed to a citizen of the United States by the Constitution

and under no circumstances shall employees of the FBI engage in any con-

duct which may result in defaming the character,

reputation, integrity,

or dignity of any citizen or organization of citizens of the United States.

Employees must not install secret telephone systems or microphones without

Bureau authority.

No brutality, physical violence, duress of intimidation of individuals by

our employees will be countenanced nor will force be used greater than

that necessary to effect arrest or for self-defense.

7 SECURITY INFORMANT PROGRAM

BASIC REVOLUTIONARY AND NEW LEFT ORGANIZATIONS

4-7•

-...

-At the time of the last inspection in January,

-1971, the Internal

Security Section handled informants

-only in the basic revolutionary organizations and related

groups.

There was no Security Informant Unit as such,

informants being handled on subversive organization

desks.

On June 16, 1971, a Security Informant Unit was

formed

and this Unit now

handles informants in the

New Left field as well as in basic revolutionary

organizations

and related groups.

At last inspection there were (264) member informants

225, a cocrease of 35.

member informants in

at present there are so acrest of Party (swe)

July 31, 1971, date of latest monthly tabulation, the

security informant unit nandied d iciai vi 79õ securiiy

informants and 671 potential security informants, a total

of 1,466. This includes(630 informant cases transferred

from

the New Leit Section

to the Security Informant Unit

in the Internal Security Section on June 16, 1971.

There has been continuing recognition of the

fact there must be no letdown in maintiining adequate

• informant coverage.

However, economy has increasingly

become a primary factor.

In line with the President's

message on August 15, 1971, tightening economic controls

and our continuing efforts

to hold down expenditures, the

field is being instructed by letter to all offices to cut

down payments to security and extremist informants and

sources by five percent.

To assure uniformity and fairness

in the application of thiscutback throughout the field,

each office was instructed to follow this formula:

Total expenditures. for all such informants and sources

for the six month period ending July 31, 1971; reduce

this total by five percent; divide the resulting figure

by six (months).

The resulting figure is to be the

guideline for each office.

EXTREMIST INFORMANTS

4-H

The prime purpose of development and utilization

of extremist informants and sources is to provide intelligence

and evidenciary information concerning black and white

extremist organizations and individuals. These sources are

also called upon to furnish information concerning situations

affecting civil unrest in all parts of the country.

Supervision of extremist informants at the Seat of

Government includes review and approval of new informants

and confidential sources, review of progress of informants,

review of payments being

; made to informants, analysis of

informant coverage in each field office, analysis of nation-

wide informant coverage of the various extremist organizations,

coordination of informant coverage of specific functions such

as Black Panther Party (BPP) and other extremist groups:

conventions, supervision of operations for the development of

top™echelon BPP informants, and other special projects such as

development of information concerning black extremist under-

ground escape routes and coordinating utilization of informants

abroad with other agencies.

All procedures are constantly

•evaluated, in an effort to increase the efficiency of our

operation and to provide the field with the necessary supervision

with a minimum of paper work.

As of 7/31/71 we are operating a total of 7,477

extremist informants compared with a total of Z,184 at the

time of the last Inspection. This is an increase of 293

informants. Concerning the above informants, 583 informants

report on black extremist organizations and 353, informants

report on white extremist organizations such as the klan.

We

are operating 6,541)ghetto informants who provide general

information within the black ghetto areas of our cities as

compared to (6,224)ghetto informants at the time of the last

Inspection which represents an increase of (317)ghetto informants.
