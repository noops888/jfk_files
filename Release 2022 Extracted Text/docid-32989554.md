As a result of this information developed and other
investigation, two of the BPP leaders in Washington and three
RIC leaders in Richmond, Virginia, were subsequently indicted
by a Federal Grand Jury. Subsequent trial resulted in the
conviction of the two Washington, D. C., leaders and two of the
RIC leaders,

Retroit extremist informants advised that a BPP member
was involved in a holdup killing in Detroit. He also advised
that this individual was carrying the same pistol used in the
killing, which enabled the Detroit police to arrest the BPP
member, recover the pistol, and determine that this weapon was
used in the killing referred to above.

A Detroit informant provided information which saved
two lives. This informant, who was a merber of the BPP, was
instrumental in saving the lives of two BPP members who were
being disciplined by the BPP. His information, when furnished
to local police, was responsible for the arrest of seven BPP mem-
bers, who were charged with kidnapping and assault to do bodily
harm less than murder.

A Memphis informant furnished information which prevented
a shoot~out Bétweéén members of the BPP chapter and the Memphis
Police Department.

In duly, 1971, a then recently developed member informant
of the black extremist “Afro Set," headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio,
furnished us extensive information concerning criminal activities
by this group, including information related to several murders
of whites which occurred in 1970. We furnished this information
to local authorities in Cleveland. Working in conjunction with
our Cleveland Office, the Cleveland Police Department instituted
an intensive investigation and in October, 1971, a local grand
jury returned secret indictments against six members of
“Afro Set," including its leader, Harellel RB. Jones. In
March, 1972, Jones received a life sentence following a trial
in which our informant was a key witness. Two other "Afro Set"
functionaries who had been involved in this murder plot pleaded
guilty and received life sentences.

December 9, 1975

Senator Frank Church
United States Senate
Washington, D.C. 20510

Dear Senator Church:

Taking the liberty of presuming on our short past acquain-
tance, I am writing you to express my deep concern over the
tragic adverse criticism being levelled at the FBI in the
news media as a result of current congressional inquiries

| into United States intelligence operations.

As you well know, ninety per cent (90%) of the work of
the Bureau is concentrated on the investigation of violations
of U. S. criminal statutes over which the FBI has primary
investigative jurisdiction. Your committee and the other
committees of the Congress now looking into the activities of
the Bureau are therefore examining and criticizing the work
which constitutes a very small percentage of their overall
‘responsibility. Not to stress the long and successful history
of the Bureau along with the few mistakes (the Congress itself
has had its share) they have made over the years is, I think,
unfair and not in the national interest. Just one example of
the effect these stories are having occured Sunday, November 30th,
when the Washington Post carried a letter to the Editor entitled
"The FBI Discredited". That letter followed testimony before
Congressional committees relative to the FBI, ‘much of which was
unfair and misleading. The letter itself, I'm sure you will
agree, contained not one fact but was filled with personal vitu-
perations against the FBI and its officials.

Secondly, you know and I know, as a former congressional
investigator, that each and every witness is interviewed by
committee staff members long before he’ formally appears before
the committee. For the life of me I cannot understand why
a reputable and responsible congressional committee would
allow testimony to be put on the record when it. had already
been denied by officials of the FBI and was, in fact, untrue.

I refer, for example, to statements made by Mr. Rowe last week.

This Nation is in grave danger of having its greatest
law enforcement agency (FBI) peaeceecemeed destroyed based on,

at least partially, untrue and/or unsubstantiated statements
of witnesses.

“I urge you, Senator, to be fair and judicious. To my

_mIind the current rash of congressional hearings have not been
that.

Proper and effective law enforcement cannot be realized
without the full voluntary cooperation of the citizens of this
country. Congressional hearings and the news media are dis-
troying that bond sometimes for nothing more than political
ambition, financial reward or basic dislike of law enforcement
agencies themselves.

I am taking the liberty of forwarding a copy of this
letter to Senator Tower, my two Senators and my Congressman.

Rrushkova or Hrushkevnova?

Mrs. Tannenbeum was never hired by INS in connection with the
visa statuc of Riha's wife, Mrs. Hana Riha nee Hrushkova.

What inquiry was made by Jobn L. Todd, INS District Director

in Denver, after he received a call early on the morning

of March 9, 1969, involving « disturbance at the Thomas Rihe

home in Roulder, Colorado? The disturbance involved Riba,

les. Tomtenbeva and Hrs. Tana Riha ond ether placed in Mrs. Riha's
bedreom, apparently to overcome her.

4 thorough review of official Sarvice Files C-7 105 013 (Thomas
Riba) and Al4 427 222 (Yana Rita) contains no written material
indicatinn that then District Director John L. Todd (now retired)
had received a cell early on the morning of March 9, 1969, rela-
ting to 4 disturbencte occurring at the home of Thomas Rihn, involy-
ing Mrs. Tannenbaum, Mrs. Wana Riba and her busbend Thomas. This
does not necessarily mean that he did not receive such « call but
merely that he made no written record of same, if in fact he
received such a cail.

Irrespective of such a call, the immigration status of Mre. Mena
Riha was already a matter of Service inquiry initiated by the

Rew York office of INS predicated upon a sixth preference petition
filed in her behalf as a secretary, to sustain an application she
filed seeking to adjust her immigration status te thet of a lawful
permanent resident alien, During the pendency of processing this
application, Mrs. Riha had received an extension of her temporary
gtoy to October 20, 1968, te complete a period of prectical training.

On January 28, 1969, the New York office of this Service
addressed a request to Hana Riha to appear for an inter-
view on February 5, 1969. This Letter was returned to the
New York office bearing an endorsement by Hena Riha’s aunt
advising of Hena‘'s marriage to a U. 8. citizen on October 13,
1968, and her current address in Boulder, Colorade. Accord-
ingly, the Service file was transferred to the Denver office
for continuance of this inquiry.

The Service file of Mrs, Hana Riha contains a hand written
memorandum dated March 7, 1969, indicating a Mrs. Tennenbsum
had called reparding this case. Tannenbaum wanted to know
whit was necessary for approval of an immediate relative visa
petition. Tennenbaum wanted to get it done right away since
the husband (Thomas Rika} was getting a divoree from the alien
(Hana Rika}. Also of record in this file are typewritten let-
ters addressed to the Denver office dated March 8 and 9, 1969,
respectively and bearing a signature “Hana Riha" in which the
writer, among other matters, designates Mrs. Tanenbaum as the
person she desires to handie her business with the Immigration
Service and that all correspondence relating thereto be directed
to Tannenbaum's home address.

Cumulatively these letters allege that her marriage te Thomes
Riha was induced by her Aunt, Mrs. Gressman, as « ceans of
circumventing the immigration laws and establishing permanent
residence status in the U. S. although she claims she is un-
decided as to whether in fact she desires to remain in the
United States.

4 Q. What were the findings of Toddts inquiry?

A. Predicated upon the referenced Ietterg (supra} and the fact
that Mrs. Riha had overstayed her lawful admission, to vit,
October 20, 1968, Pistrict Director Tedd approved an ep, ‘lies-
‘tion for an Order to Show Cause prepared by a Servize inves-
tigator on March 10, 1969, and on March LL, 1969, issued and
signed an Order to Show Cause and Notice of Hearing on Mrs. Riha
charging her with being subject to deportation pursuant to the
provisions of Section 241(a)}(2) of the Immigration and Nationa-
lity Act, in that, after admission as « nonimmigrant, she had
remiined in the United States for a longer time than permitted.
Thig Order and Notice were served on Mrs. Riha by registered
mail on March 11, 1969, directing her to appear for a hearing
before d Special Inquiry Office on the charges, to be held at
the Denver INS office at 2:06 P.M., Tuesday, March 25, 1969. On

~

March 21, 1969, the Denver office received a registered letter
dated March 20, 1969, with enclosure in the form of a Notiee

of Appearance as attorney for Hana Riha, in which a continuance
of the scheduled deportation hearing was requested and granted.

The file of Hana @iha contains @ memorondum dated April 10,
1969, prepared for the file by then District Director Todd
reporting that at 10:30 P.M. in the evening of April 9, 1969,
he was telephonically contacted at his home by a reporter from
the staff of the Colorado Daily, Colorado University, Boulder,
Colorado, who advised he was preparing an article for his paper
and desired some assistance. The reporter stated that a

Mes. Tannenbaum had informed him that she was employed in some
capacity by the Immigration and Naturalization Service and that
she had the authority toe direct what disposition of Mrs. Riha's
ease. The reporter also stated that Professor Riha had disap-
peared two or three weeks before from the University and that
Mrs. Tannenbaum had stated his disappearance was the result of
activities by the secret police of three (3) foreign countries;
that Mrs. Tannenbaum also claimed to have access to certain
intelligence information in possession of the military author~
ities. In response to specific inquiries che reporter was ad-
vised: by Mistrict Director Todd to the effect that (1) a

Mrs. Gerald Tannenbaum is not and has never been, to his knowl~
edge, an employee of INS (2) that he (Todd) had no idea of what
her enployment might be and (3) thit he could give him (the re-
porter) no specific information rezarding a Professor Riha, the
alleged husband of subject Hana Riha. Im conclusion, the memo-
randum suggests that the reporter might desire to contact Mrs. Rihats
attorney since he had already mentioned the name of Mrs. Riha’s
attorney during the course of the conversation.

5. Q. Were these findings communicated to the CIA and the FBI?

A. A memorandum dated April 11, 1969, prepared by thon Deputy Dis-
trict Director Lioyd D. Proweli and addressed to the file of
ana Riha reports that on April 10, 1969, Prowell telephonically
contacted the Assistant Agent in Charge of the Denver office of
the Federal Bureau of Investigation and provided him with the
substance of the information contained in District Director Todd's
memorandum of April 10, 1969, (supra) and implies that such agent
was requested to advise whether a contemplated investigation by
INS would interfere with any actions which might be under consideration
by the EBI.

NW 65360 Docid:32989554 Page 24

On Aprii 11, 1969, the Assistant Agent in Cherge of the
Denver FBL office telephonicaliy edvised Mr. Prowell that
his office had a pending investigation on Mes. Tannenbaum
for alleged numerous impersonations of federal officisle,
but that investigation by INS would not interfere with their
operations in this matter. Ue requested, however, that upon
completion of any investigétion by INS, his office be fur-
nished a copy of the report.

TOPIC: SEPARATION OF INTELLIGENCE GATHERING FROM LAW
ENFORCEMENT FUNCTIONS

The question has been raised regarding the
feasibility of separating the intelligence gathering function of
the FBI from the law enforcement function of the FBI.

The functions of the FBI do not neatly fall within
"intelligence" and "law enforcement" categories, Internal security
cases are both intelligence and law enforcement operations and
counterintelligence sometimes involves arrests and prosecutions,
i,e., law enforcement. Thus, the functions of the FBI can more
accurately be broken down into three general missions - law
enforcement, internal security (domestic), and counterintelligence
(foreign), These missions are separate, distinct, and distinguishable
functions, even though each partakes a little of each other,

While counterintelligence could adequately, and with
more success in some cases, be handled by an organization totally
separate from one with law enforcement powers, internal security
work in many cases, is directly related to criminal prosecution.
Complete separation, at least of the internal security function from

law enforcement, does not appear to be practically feasible.

NW 65360 Docld:32989554 Page 36



a) e-
A

Separation of the internal security function also
presents serious political considerations. Internal security is
the most controversial of government's intelligence collection
activities. In the U.S., this function was originally given to the
FBI which had established for itself a reputation for being respon-
sible, competent, and most importantly, politically neutral and had
the confidence of most Americans. It is to the advantage of an
internal security agency, which is subjected to political pressures,
to be somewhat insulated by being part of a larger, respected
organization which has a high profile as a competent and fair
investigative agency in the less politically complex law enforcement
and counterintelligence fields. Adding to this insulation is the
tradition of FBI political independence, and the new Congressional
concern with keeping the FBI politically independent, While the law
enforcement and counterintelligence wings of the FBI dislike the
controversies into which its internal security wings drag the FBI name,
separation of internal security into a separate agency would probably
subject it to more intense political pressures, both from within the
administration and without, which pressures it might not be capable
of withstanding. Such separation appears politically unfeasible and

undesirable.

NW 65360 Docld:32989554 Page 37



@ eo
. e

Separation of the counterintelligence function would be
more practically feasible; however, the commingling of counterintelli-
gence and internal security interests and the threat of a merger of
the counterintelligence function with the positive foreign intelligence
collection agency, especially in the U.S., are both practical and
political reasons militating against this course,

Practical considerations against divestiture of the
counterintelligence and internal security functions from the FBI are
that: basic criminal investigative experience equips men in many
areas to be intelligence officers; a pool of trained criminal investi-
gators is available to.the intelligence missions to draw from, either on
an ad hoc emergency basis, e.g., seizure of an embassy or political
kidnapping or skyjacking, or as candidates for the position of intelli-
gence officer; a divestiture might result in the loss to the counterintelli-
gence and internal security wings of the effective use of the FBI name,
reputation, and contacts/sources built-up over the years using the FBI
name.

All members of the intelligence community have specific
responsibilities defined by statutes and executive orders, The FBI

maintains close daily liaison with other agencies to insure against

NW 65360 Docld:32989554 Page 38



e .
° e

repetition or overlapping activities. The Congress and the Executive

Branch, in establishing intelligence agencies such as the Central

| Intelligence Agency (CIA), National Security Agency, FBI, etc. , must
have considered the need to keep each agency's functions separate.
The CIA, for example, is specifically prohibited from having any
internal security or law enforcement functions. For this reason, in

addition to consideration of experience, efficiency and economy, the

FBI recommends that all three missions of law enforcement, internal

security, and counterintelligence remain with the FBI,

TOPIC: THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE FBI DIRECTOR

TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

The FBI, through Congressional enactment, Executive Order,
and directive of the Attorney General has been charged with the responsi-
bility of performing certain duties subject to the general supervision and
direction of the Attorney General. The Director of the FBI, a Bureau chief
within the Department, having been granted enormous responsibility, must
attain a proper balance between independence and responsiveness in order
to properly discharge this responsibility.

The Director of the FBI must be permitted to discharge his
responsibilities free from political or unethical pressure. This must be
balanced with his responsibility to remain responsive to the Attorney
General's leadership and direction. A Congressional oversight committee,
available to give the FBI counsel, guidance, and direction, can greatly
assist the FBI in achieving and maintaining this balance.

There must be an efficient working relationship, with free and

open channels of communication, between the Director and the Attorney

TOPIC: THE ASSIGNMENT OF FBI AGENTS TO FOREIGN

LIAISON POSTS

The FBI has had FBI Agents serving in foreign liaison posts
since 1940. They are known as Legal Attaches and are regularly called
upon to secure in-depth cooperation from foreign agencies on criminal
and security matters which are frequently of a complicated and sensitive
nature. In order to handle such matters effectively, it is often required
that a Legal.Attache be proficient in the language of the foreign country
involved and should have some familiarity with the culture, customs and
judicial processes. Simultaneously, it is obviously advantageous to have
a thorough knowledge of FBI jurisdiction, regulations, and policies. This
knowledge can only be achieved through years of experience as an FBI
Agent.

In order to maintain the cooperation of foreign agencies, Legal
Attaches assist these agencies by having investigations conducted in the
United States concerning matters of interest to the foreign countries
involved.

Several options in lieu of maintaining FBI Agents in foreign
countries have been suggested. These include the assignment of Embassy
personnel to handle FBI work, to have FBI interests abroad handled by

other law enforcement agencies which maintain foreign liaison offices,



roe : : e ae
e e

and the discontinuance of FBI pursuit of foreign ramifications in criminal
and security responsibilities.by FBI personnel and conduct the investigations
through direct communications. All of these alternatives pose serious
problems including security risks, lack of expertise and knowledge of

FBI procedures and policies, etc.

The FBI has found it necessary and, in fact, through experience
it has been demonstrated it is invaluable to have a man stationed abroad
who can insure that prompt and efficient action is taken and that cooperative
relationships are nurtured and protected. Accomplishments attained by
the FBI through the liaison activities of the Legal Attaches with foreign
law enforcement agencies have been numerous, and it is firmly believed
that these successes would not have occurred in the absence of personal
and direct FBI liaison with foreign police agencies.

The FBI currently has Agents stationed in 15 American

diplomatic establishments outside the United States.

TOPIC: THE FBI AS AN INDEPENDENT AGENCY

The proposal to make the FBI an independent agency within
the Executive Branch has been voiced on several occasions in Congress.
Approximately one year ago, two bills were introduced in the Senate to
achieve this aim.

Proponents of this proposal indicate their basis for supporting
this approach is because of their concern to have the FBI free from political
influence. ‘They cite as an argument the fact the Attorney General is almost
always a political appointee of the President whose views generally conform
with his own.

The question arises whether removal of the FBI from the
Department of Justice is the proper means of assuring a justifiable degree
of independence and freedom from undue political pressure. The FBI as
an independent agency would simply mean the Director would no longer
report to the Attorney General but instead would be responsible directly
to the White House.

Opponents of the proposed Senate bills suggest that some danger
does exist in the FBI's reporting to a political appointee, but a far greater
danger may exist if the FBI, performing as an independent agency, became
the arm of a politically motivated Director who was primarily responsible

. to the White House.

It is the FBI's position the FBI should remain a Bureau within
the Department of Justice where it can properly perform its functions to
investigate violations of various Federal laws and report its impartial
findings to those who will conduct the prosecution of these violations in

our judicial system.

Re: Senstudy 75
62-116395

Blaine K, Katz, Richard G. Kinsey, William J. Lander,
Rodney K, McHargue, William F, Moran, Alfred K, Nicholas, Jr.,
Richard H. Ross, . John P, Thomas, and John A, Van Wagenen.

At approximately 7:00 p.m. on Saturday evening,
10/4/75, I received a call from Special Agent Paul V. Daly
of the Legal Counsel Division. Mr. Daly advised that the
Attorney General (AG) had requested the Bureau immediately
prepare a list of electronic surveillances conducted by the
Bureau from 1/1/70 until 6/30/75. In addition, the AG
requested that the supportive documents underlying these
electronic surveillance requests also be provided him. Both
the list and supportive documents were to be on the desk of
the AG by 9:00 a.m., 10/6/75.

After a series of calls, arrangements were made
with the Files and Communications Division to begin pulling
the necessary files needed to prepare the list and provide
the supportive documents. At 9:30 a.m., the above-named
Bureau supervisors reported to the Intelligence Division
where they worked steadily, without taking time out for lunch
or dinner until approximately 9:00 p.m., developing the
necessary information and documents responsive to the AG's
request.

Miss Winslow and Miss Dodge, secretaries in the
Intelligence Division, along with Miss Simmons and Mrs, Weldon,
typists in the Intelligence Division, reported for work at
approximately 11:00 a.m. These 4 young ladies worked contin-
uously through the afternoon and well into the evening hours
preparing the necessary communications for the AG. Not only
did they perform in an admirable fashion but they exhibited
an outstanding attitude and suffered considerable physical
exhaustion prior to their departure for the day at approximately

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: Senstudy 75
62-116395

10:00 p.m. Without the outstanding performance of these
4 young ladies, it would have been impossible for this
Division to meet the AG's deadline.

It is interesting to note that the Intelligence
Division was successful in meeting the deadline and had
the necessary material available for the AG at 9:00 a.m.,
on the morning of 10/6/75.

RECOMMENDATIONS :

1. In view of the outstanding manner in which
L. Patricia Simmons, Christine A. Weldon, Gerry L. Winslow
and Mary E. Dodge performed, it is recommended that each
receive a letter of commendation from the Director,

2. That a general letter of commendation be sent
the Assistant Director, Intelligence Division, for the manner
in which Bureau supervisors in the Intelligence Division
performed and that a copy of that general letter be designated
for the personnel files of those Bureau supervisors mentioned
in the first paragraph of this memorandum.

The Select Committee requests that limited staff

the FBI and the Justice Department reflecting the dissemi-
nation of information by the FBI from the wiretaps Authoriz—
ed by Attorney General Robert Kennedy in connection with
the investigation of lobbying activities in 1961 and 1962.
The procedures will be the same as those used for staff
access to similar materials pertaining to the so-called
"17 wiretaps" under the Nixon Administration.

This request should be handled on a priority basis
and expedited accordingly.

"When a free and severeign pecple find theixy elected
servants in government, and their appointed advisors, following a
course of action contrary to their cath ef office, destructive
ef the Constitution they have sworn to uphold, and leading
rekentiessiy to the loss of their freedom and their sovereignty,
they must perforce take the most effective action to restore sane,
constitutional government, or perish as a free and sovereign people,

“A government that aids and abets the enemies of freedom
at home and abroad; recklessly spends the substance of the nation
in the purchase of votes and in the pursuit of a pro=communist
policy; punishes patriots who dare defy the communist enemy they
are trying to shield, while giving positions of power and peif
to those traitors who give aid and confort to this enemy; employs
the power of the press and all other communications media to
deceive the peoplé as to their real aims and objectives; behaves
as though this nation were already but a province of the illegally
joined United Nations; is willing or unable to meet the constant
flow of crises provided by an arrogant enemy, yielding piece by |.
piece the entire world into their ruthless hands; shows every sign
of having ylelded their powers to an unseen, irresponsible and
thoroughly rapacious government within the government; then even
the bread and circuses no longezx can hold the people in check,
They must take matters into their own hands and force the traitors
aut of power and oblige their elected representatives to honor
their oath of office. : :

‘in such case there are several course of action open
to the people, Bolitical organization to vote out the traitors
and vote in the patriots is one. Pressure by personal appeais,,

: petitions, letters and telegrams is another, But the time cones

, When the enemy, feeling strong and secure enough, shamelessly

| ignores these efforts cf the people, and makes ready to replace
‘ constitutional government with socialistic tyranny openly and

‘ .quickiy. Then there is yet another .course of action left: The

| organization of a powerful, armed resistance force to defeat the
‘aims of the usurpers and bring about a return of constitutional

| government. I

"The formation of such a nation-wide force, under the
second article of the Bill of Rights, and for the legitimate
purpose of preventing a communistic takeover of their beloved
country, with the to.al loss of their freedom, cannot fail to
bring into being again that sovereignty which, under our form of
government, is based upon the psople. Government rules by the
consent of the governed, and, when the governed refuse further to
consent to being betrayed, then beware! Those in government who
have been loyal need have ne fear, But when the day comes that

’ the people, in the exercise of their constitutional rights and
povereignty once more take up arms as they did in 1776, then must

7 the traiters take flight. .For the wrath of a free and mighty .

people, a Ged fearing fied oar Ie against atheistic tyrants can be 4
terrible and swift. I-pray te Ged that courses one and two will

JIMMY GEORGE ROBINSON, 200 Second Avenue, Garland, Texas,
was interviewed and furnished the following signed statement:

"Garland, Texas
June 24, 1963

"I, Jimmy George Robinson, make the following voluntary
statement to James P, Hosty, Jr., and Donald J. Cesare, who have
identified themselves to me as Special Agents of the F.B.I. I.

have been advised that this statement may used in a court of
law. No force, threats, or promises were uséd to obtain this
statement.

"I was born June 24, 1938, Bonham, Texas, I completed
eighth grade in school.

“On June 20, 1963, I was arrested by the Garland, Texas,
police for assaulting my wife, Pauline Robinson. I was arrested
at 9:35 AM, and released at 2:00 PM. & later learned from my
half brother Donald Kaiser that at about 1:30 PM, two Garland
police officers and one Garland detective, names ” unknown, accoupanted
_ my wife to our residence at 200 Second Aves, Garland, Texas. a
“The Garland Police then searched my office and removed
some of my literature I had concerning racial integration and the
dewish conspiracy. They also took my membership list for the
National States Rights Party. I am the organizer for the National
States Rights Party in the Dallas, Texas, area,

"My office is a separate building behind my house. The
National States Rights Party rents this office from me for one
dollar a month. Wy wife had no right to let the police search
this office as it was not under her control, My membership list
was returned, but they kept my literature. They also took pictures
of my office and some of the signs I had.

"{ feel that my civil rights have been violated because

the Garland Police searched the office of National States Rights
Party, of which I am the head in the Dallas area, without my consent.

in furnishing Capell this classified information, plus Capell's

Attorney General's February 27, 1975 Testimony ~-
cegarding FBI Operations

In his February 27, 1975 testimony before. the Edwards
Committee regarding FBI information-gathering practices, the
Attorney General gave certain assurances, most of which seem to
be addressed by the FBI guidelines. These include assurances
that:

1. An examination would be made of the practice. of
collecting information on individuals, _including Congressmen
(Tr. op. 6). :

. 2. An attempt would be made to devise a procedure to
. sereen unsolicited materials to be retained by the FBI, or
to periodically review them to determine whether they’ should
be retained (Tr. 16-17). 7

3. Director Kelley and his associates do not maintain
files on specific individuals in their offices which might be
considered "dossiers" (Tr. 24). Confixrmacion that this remains
‘true today might be obtained.

4. Measures would be taken to minimize the opportunity
or the FBI to be misused (Tr. 24).

st Dizectoz Kelley was directed to report to the Attor-
ney General practices or requests to the FBI which are or may
appear to be improper (Ir. 27-23). This direction was repeated
in July, 1975. The FBI documents informing the Bureau of this
. policy should be obtained. Instances in which matters con-
cerning actual or apparent impropriety have been reported to
the Attorney General should be listed.

6. Consideration would be given to an Executive Order
to limit the authority in the White House to make requests
directly to the FBI to a few highly placed White House officials
(Tr. 28).

7. Consideration would be given to the scope and effect
of the Executive Order which requires the FBI to report to the

ALL INFORMATION conranren



heads of executive departments and the Civil Service Com-
mission unverified allegations relevent to the character
of government employees (Tr. 29).

8. If the guidelines were complete, the Attorney
General would be delighted to announce them (Tr. 35).

9. Consideration would be given to whether a member _
of Congress should be permitted to review FBI files concern-
ing him not compiled in an investigation authori by statute
and, if he wishes, order the destruction of those files (Tr. 86).

SUBJECT. Attorney General’s SSC testimony regarding the FBI --.

Meeting with SSC Staff

- On November 24, 1975 Doug Marvin, Jack Fuller, Mike Shaheen,
Ray Hornblower and I met with John E11iff£ and Mark Gittenstein
of the SSC staff to discuss the Attorney General's testimony
regarding the FBI now scheduled for December 10, 1975.

The SSC has already had public testimony concerning
FBI from its staff and Jim Adams. It plans to
of relevant hearings next week, one on the Fv
gram and another on Department of Justice supervision of
FBI. On the latter subject, the SSC hopes to have as witnesses
former FBI officials Sullivan and DeLoach and former Attorneys
General Rogers, Katzenbach and Clack.

During the week of December 1, 1975, the SSC proposes to
hear public testimony from’ Williams Ruckelshaus, Henry Petersen,
and Joseph Califano on FBI domestic intelligence activities,
Clarence Kelley on the impact certain proposals would have on
the FBI, and the Attorney General on controlling the FBI. The
SSC may also request executive session t mony from the Attor-
ney General on the FBI's activities rei ating to foreign intelli-
gence.

Gittenstein and ELLiff described 5 areas which the SSC would
like to discuss publicly with the Attorney General. These are:

1. The legal authority for FBI domestic intelligence activities,
including whether President Rooseveit had the authority to
initiate the program and, if so, whether his authorization
was properly construed by the FBI.

2. The breadth of the FBI's domestic intelligence operations,
which included women's liberation groups and Martin Luther
King, and whether the FBI manual or the pr roposed guidelines
would permit activities directed against such groups today
or in the future. ary, FORMATION CONTAINED

3. Whether "preventive action" is‘ ever appropriate and, if so,
how it should be controlled.

‘
4, Whether the Department, the President or Gongress has given
the FBI adequate guidance on what individuals or groups
constitute internal security threats with which it should
be concerned and whether there is regular review by anyone
to reevaluate the current danger presented by an individual
or group previously designated as an internal security threat.

5. Whether guidance given to the FBI is being followed and how
this can be assured. Related qvustions include whether the
FBI can properly investigate itsel£, whether the Department
‘ of Justice should have an Inspector General, and whether GAO
should be involved in regularly auditing FBI activities.

In the course of discussion, E11iff and Gittenstein alluded
to several other’ questions which might be raised. These include:

1. Should internal security activities be permitted at ell, or
can what E11iff called the “Stone Standard” be readopted?

2. The question raised by the Martin Luther King case of what
degree of' suspected or actual connection with a foreign
government should be required to trigger surveillance or
investigation of a domestic group? How should "infiltration"
be defined? ‘

3. How does a domestic intelligence inves tion differ from
a criminal investigation and can the differences be justified?

4. Should there be a statute explicitly authorizing and limit-
ing domestic intelligence activities? If so, what should be
authorized?

5. What happens to information compiled in the course of unlaw-
ful surveillances or activities initiated on the basis of
reasonable beliefs which prove to be unfounded?

Elliff asked whether the proposed FBI guidelines could be dis-
tributed to members of the SSC and used as a basis for discussion
at the hearings. We indicated we would consider this request.

Questions suggested by FBI testimony of SSC
Staff and Jin Adams.

Mike Shaheen's office is preparing a synopsis of the
testimony regarding the FBI presented on November 18 and 19,
1975 by the SSC staff and Jim Adams. In my view, the staff
testimony suggests several areas of interest to the SSC, listed
below, which may be discussed with the Attorney General when
he testifies.

1. The SSC questions the value of investigation and sur-
veillance of domestic groups believed to be extremist or sub-
versive. According to its staff, the GAO attempted to evaluate
these activities (Tr. 1605). They found that of 675 cases
reviewed, only 16 had been referred for prosecution; resulting
in 4 convictions. In addition, in only 12 of these .ccwes did
the GAQ find "that the FBI gained any advance knowledge of
planned activities, and 51 percent of those cases revealed no
association with objectionable organizations or no illegal
objectionable ac ities" (Tr. 1605). Thus, the staff concludes
that surveillance of domestic groups has had little prosecutorial
or intelligence value and questions whether such activities shoulda
ever be conducted in view of the costs and risk of abuse they ‘
involve.

2, The SSC staff believes that important FBI documents
were included in the "personal files" of J. Edgar Hoover which
were destroyed after his death (Tr. 1608). They believe that
Hoover had reviewed the personal files lettered A to C and
transferred some official documents frem these to the OC files.
However, files lettered D through Z were not reviewed in this
manner and the staff presumes that some official documents were
lost when these files were destroyed. The SSC believes that
the FBI unintentionally gave the Attorney General an incom-
plete report on this matter which suggested that no FBI docu-
ments were destroyed. This report was later transmitted to

* the SSC.

3. Senator Tower believes that attention should be paid
to the use of informants, a form of information-gathering which
does not require judicial or Department of Justice approval
(Tr. 1617).

4, ‘Interest has been expressed in whether the counter-
espionage and internal security functions of the Bureau should
be separated within the FBI or handled by different organiza-
tions to reduce the risk that techniques appropriate to counter-
espionage will-be improperly employed against domestic groups
(Tr. 1636).

5. The 1971 FBI document ending Cointellpro stated that
"In exceptional instances where it is considered counter-
intelligence action is warranted, recommendation should be
submitted to the Bureau under the individual case caption" (fr.
1651). Thus, it may be asked whether there have been any such
requests since 1971 and, if so, whether any were aprpoved.

6. The SSC staff believes that the history of the "Security
Index" is an excellent example of the problems of oversight and
relationships between the FBI, the Department and: Congress
(Tr. 1663).

7. In 1973 the FBI asked the Department to seek statu~
tory ‘authorization for domestic intelligence ectivities and
such authority has not to date been sought (Tr. 1675).

8. The FBI procedure of reporting by an "INLET" letter

‘items with an unusual twist or concerning prominent individuals

was discontinued because there were better means of communicating
“dirt" to headquarters for dissemination to the White House

(Ir. 1707). This raises the question of whether agents are
still expected to furnish such informarion to headquarters

and, if not, when it was stcpped. If it has not been stopped,
what type of information is now forwarded and what is done with
it? 7

of the seetions did. ‘they were particularly interested
in the handling of press matters--whethcer we played any
favorites among papers in giving out nevs storics, exactly

what type of information ve gave out tn the press, et cotera,

I told them we played no favorites, but that I naturally
knew personally what papers and reporters were favorably
disposed toward the Bureau and which were prejudiced against
us and that this was in my mind in dealing with the press,
I stressed te them that we always strictly folloved the
iiterney General's guidelines on vhat could und enuld not
be given te the news media en criminal cases and that only
information of a strictly public source nature was ever
given tn any nevsman in other types of cases. I carefully-
explained te them what public seurce information is and
differentiated it from information developed by intervieus,
or infarmation from informants or seurces, or infnrmation
gotten through other investigetive techniques, I also
strossed ta them that ve never withheld from any newspaper,
reporter, radia or television network any information
which they had a right toe know about, no matter hwy
ontagonistic or anti-FBI the paper, television or radio
netiinrk or the reporter might be.

The Eollewing are some of the topics which they
vent inca in depth:

‘they wanted me te justify each of the memoranda. I pointed
nut to them that they did not originate in the Ciw and that
I, therefore, did net think that it was up ta me to justify
then. I pointed eut that the mole of the Cad vas to merely

I also pointed ovt that, in each of the mompranda they
shoved me, the information to be passed ta the press vas

of a strictly public source nature and that none nf the

RE: INTERVIEW OF FORMER FBI ASSISTANT DIRECTOR THOMAS E, BISHOP
BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS

NOTE:

Mr. Bishop's report of the interview was set
out in his personal letter of 12/4/75 to Supervisor Seymor
Phillips of the Senstudy 75 Project. Mr. Bishop asked
that the letter be carefully edited, This was done to
omit these portions which were irrelevant to the interview
or were personal comments to Mr. Phillips. In those
instances where it was unclear as to whether Mr, Bishop
was reporting what he said during the interview or was
merely commenting parenthetically, the portions were also
omitted, Legal Counsel memorandum to Mr, J. B. Adams
11/28/75 captioned "Senstudy 75" prepared by PVD:dkg
recommended releasing Bishop from any existing employment
agreements for purposes of the SSC interview.

In his letter to Mr, Phillips, Mr, Bishop, under
that portion, captioned "The Ehrlichman Teletype," also
wrote, ". . . this was the matter in which Pat Gray tried
to shaft me by telling the newspapers that the handling of
this matter had been done by me without authority, without
the approval of my superiors. The truth of the matter was
that I had objected to Mark Felt that the Bureau shouldn't
even handle this, I had been specifically ordered to initiate
action on it by Felt and that Felt, David Kinley and
Pat Gray had all approved the handling of it. Of course,
when 'Life’ Magazine printed a critical story about it,
then Gray started to get scared and tried to dump the blame
onme, I challenged him on it quite vigorously and, in fact,
this was the thing that finally made me realize that I
should retire from the Bureau because Gray was playing
politics and using the Bureau to do so."

December 4, 1975

Mr. Seymour Phillips
FBI
Washington, DC

Dear Seymour:

In accordance with your request, I am going to try
to set down -- very briefly -- some of the items dealt with during
my appearance before the Senate Select Committee an Intelligence
Avtivities on December 2, 1975. I am a very poor typist and can't
possibly remember all the matters discussed with me, so you will
have to bear with mo.

First of all, I was sworn in by Sen. Schweiker, who
only stayed for a very brief time. I was interviewed fro& 9AM
to a bout 5 PM, with Gordon Rhea, Assistant to the Chie Counsel,
Frederick Baron, Assistant to the Chief Counsel, and Barbara
Banoff, Counsel, present during the entire questioning, and with
Joseph diGenoza, Counsel, participating during the morning session,
and John Bliff, Head of the Domestic Task Force, participating
in the afternoone

Let me say at the outset that it was a pretty grueling
experience, not because I veouldn't handle the questions they
threw at me, but because of the sheer length of the session and
because I had absolutely no prior knowledge of what memos, docu-~
ments, ete they were to throw at me. I do think that the Bureau does
a disservice to former employees who have been out of the Bureau
for some time and who have to appear before the Commityee, by not
giving them some idea of the areas of questioning that will be fuma
faced with and some clues as to what old memos, ete thay will be
called upon to explain.

Now, getting back to my questioning --- they first
wanted me to give them a detailed account of just what duties the
Crime Records Division performed. This included every function
performed by the Front Office, as well as each and every thing that
each of the Sctions mm did. They were particularly interested
in the handling of press matters -- whether we played any favorites
among papers in giving out news stories, exactly what type of in-
formation we gave out to the press, etc. Naturally , I told them
we played no favorites but that I naturally knew personally what
papers and reportes were favorably disposed toward the Bureau and
which were prejudiced against us and that this was in my mind
in dealing with the press. I stressed to them that we always
strictly followed the ATgornoey General's Guidelines on what
could and could not be given to the news media on criminal cases
and that only information of a-strictly public source nature was
ever given to any newsman in other types of cases. I carefully
explained to them what public source data is and diffdrentiated
it from information developed by interviews, or info from

Aut BROMARES, OF Sources, or info gotten through other investigative

techniquese I also stressed to them that we never withheld
from any newspaper, reporter, radio or TV network any info
which they had a right to know about no matter how antagonistic
or anti-FBI the paper, TV or radio ntework er the reporter
might be.

Now getting to some of the topics which they went into
in depth.
MASS MEDIA PROGRAM_

The showed me dozens of memos pfepared by the Dom. Intell.
Divy under this program , all of which recommended that the Crime
Records Div. give info to sam selected newspapers or publications
which info reflected unfavorably on certain individuals or
organizations. Many of these memos related to M.L. King, other
racial leaders , and racial organbzationse It was obvious that
they didn't think much of this program and thought of it as
harrassment. Theu wanted me to justify each of the memos. I pointed
out to them that they déd not originate in the Crime Records
Div. and that I therefare did not think that it was up to me to
justify them. I pointed out the the role of the Crime Records Div
was to merely serve as a conduit to get the infomation prepared
by the Dom Intell Div to the reporter, that the infomation
to be passed by us to a reporter was compiled by the Dom Intell
Div and that the approval of the action proposed by the memos
was in most gases completed before the memo even cams to use I
also pointed out that, in each of the memos thaey showed me, the
information to be passed to the press was of a strictly public
source nature, and that none of the information Could be considered
confidential

_CONINTELPRO

They showed me a lot of memos prepared by the Dom Intel
Div under this program which also recommended giving certain info
to certain reporters abour selected individuals and groups. I told
them that, as far as the Crime Records Div was connerned, these
were handled the same as these under the Mass Media Program and
that all of my replies and explanations ubder that captkon (above)
also applied to this programe

DO _NoT GoNTACT List

They wanted to know all about the handling of this.
I told them , and also explained there was nothing sinister about
it and that it was merely to keep our agents from wasting their
time contacting people during investigations who had clearly
indicated that they did not wish to be contacted, and also to keep
our agents from heing insulted or vilified repeatedly by people £
who made a prac tice of doing this whenever contacted by an Agent.
They seemed satisfied tht the DNA list was in no was a " Blacklist"

v SPECIAL, CORRESPONDENTS LIST

I had to explain this in detail -- its purpose, how'a
person got included on the list, mmm what publications, etc, were
sent to péople on the list, etc. It appeared my explanations satis-
fied them.

WHITE HOUSE NAME CHECKS

This was gone into pretty thonpughly. In answer to a
question, I told them that we generally knew from the list of names
on which checks were being asked what was the reason for the name
check request (because the list whuld generally indicate a date on
which a function was being held at the White Housw to whieh the x
people on the list had been invited; I told them, however, that we
would still handle the neme check even xkmugu though we did not
know why it was requested . They tried to make something out of that
but gave up after I pointed out how ridiculous it would be if the
FBIrefused to give the President a summary of data in a our files
on a person unless he first told us why he wanted it.

CONGRESSIONAL FILES

I had to give them a detailed explation of this -- what
info we collected from the field offices on newly elected Con-
gressmen and Senators, what we did with the info, what we used it
for, etc. I frankly thought that they would go into this in even
more detail than they did. They seemed to back off from it when
I explained that the chief purpose of the Congressional Files was
to assist me in handling liaison with the Senate and House-- that
I wamted to know which Congressmen and Senators were crooks, lushes,
libertknes, etc because I certainly wouldn't trust anyone like
that. I said I could give them some specific, horrible examples,
but they didn't want me to put the names gn the records

LEONARD BOUBIN

He was the attornef for Dr, Spock during the latter's
trial. He has a long history of CP’ associations . During the trial
a memo was written setting out all the public source data known
on him and it was recommended that it be given to a friendly news-
mane They wan ted to know why this was proposed, whether the info
was in fact given to a newsman at that time, and if we made a
practice of giving out derogatory data on attorneys for defendants
in Bureau caseSe I told them we must have been asked for public
source data by a newsman and that's why the memo was written, I also
showed them nokations written on the mmamo which specifically
prohibited tha data beibg given out while the trial was in progres
or even until after all appeals in the Spock case were concluded.

THE ERLICHMAN TELETYPE

While I was being interviewed, the Admknistrative Assistant
to Sen. Phillip Hart, called the staff and asked that I be
requested to make a detailed statement on the record.concerning the
above matters I was delighted to dom so because xmuksz,/ this was
the matter in which Pat Gray tried to shaft me by telling the
newspapers thst the handling of this matter had been done by mo
without authority, without the approval of my superiorse The
truth of the metter wask that I had objected to Mark Felt that
the Bureau shouldn't even handle this, I had been specifically
ordered to initiate action on it by Felt, and that Felt, David x
Kinley and Pat Gray had all apppuwed the handling of it. Of
course, when ‘Life’Magazine printed a critical story about it, then
Gray started to get scared and tried to dump the blame on me. I
challenged him on it quite vigorausly and, in fact, this was the 8
thing that finally made me realize that I should retiBe from
the Bureau because Gray was playing politics and using the Bureau
to do soel Anyway, I put on the record a deatiled explanation
of the hahdling of this matter and clearly placed the respon-
sibility for it where it belonged. The reason Sem Hart wanted to |}
get my side of it’on the record is because Gray, during his con-
firmation hearing, had tried to slip and dodge questions about
this and Sen Haft thought he may have come close to perjurye

BOS ANGELES TIMES AWD JACK NELSON Pa

I was questioned in great detail concerning the Bureau's
relations with the above paper and with Jack Nelson, one of it's
Washington based reporters who for some time had been carrying on
a vendette against.Mre Hoover and who, on several occasions had
claimed he was out to & "get" Mr. Hoover. In 1971 or 1972 the
General Manager of the LA Times came to see Mr. Hooverm and,
before he went in , the Crime Records Division prepared a ‘i
detailed memo on our relations with the TIMES and on what we
had in our files on Nelsbne The staff was in possession of
this memo and questioned me intensively about it. I explained why =
it was prepared, that it was for interhal use only( I emphasized 3
this because the staff seemed to think we had planned to give it
to someone outside the Bureau), and explained the whole background &
of the Situation. In doing so, I must admit, I took advantage of
the situation to get on the record several times my description
of Nelson as a “drunken S.0.B."

Well, Seymour, that's about as mich as I can recall. & Y
Besides, my wife is waiting for me to play golg with her. As I

said, It was a long session. I did not, however, on any occasion (
ever admit that anything that was done by me, Mr. Hoover or the ©)
Bureau was wrong or improper, even with 20/20 hindsight. I only

wish that some of the Bureau people who has testified would have
expressed themselves the same way,

RE: REQUEST FOR INFORUATION CONCERNING
THIS BUREAU'S OPERATION OF INFORMANTS
IN THE INTERNAL SECURITY FIELD

we De

Reference is made to SSC letter dated November 7,
1975, requesting a weyorandum on this Bureau's operation of
infornants in the internal security field,

‘. An informant, according to the dictionary, is

nae “one who gives information.” In Light of this definition,
it is clenx that very gew persons, if any, have not at one
time or another been informants. To give information is an
inseparable part of life, To give accurate, sound and ~
helpful information for a worthy cause is to make one's
iige more useful and yaluabie to society.

infornants of the FBE are persons who furnish
necessary and vital iniormation~--information which is used
as 2 means of attaining justice. Inforaants clear the
annocent as well as convict the yuilty. They serve of their
own free will. None are forced. Informants are as old as
the human race. Their use is international. History is
studded with wany and varied examples of the uses of infornants.
No government or organized society has been without thea.

U. S, SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE TO STUDY GOVERNMENTAL :
OPERATIONS WITH RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC) i

The developuent of informants is one of the most
difzieult, unique and specialized assignments. Despite
the obstacles encountered in informant development, Bureau
Agents have met and ayo continuing to meet with steady and
remarkable successes, They regularly denonstrate vision,
daring and commendable resourcefulness in this work, The
Bureau today we believe has the best informant coverage in
its history.

When information is recelyed or developed that a
person hag background qualifications indicative of informant
potential, in an area where coverace is needed, a ease is
opened, Office and Headquarters indices are reviewed and
other logical discreet checks are made, including canvass of
logical sources, to prelininarily establish the individual's
background, reliability, stability and integrity. If the
prelininary checks are favorable, the individual would be
interviewed to establish a personal assessment by a
Special Agent as to the person's qualifications, potential,
and willingness to assist this Bureau, If the interview is
positive, additional background investigation is conducted
to establish the persons reliability, stability, and
integrity. Upon satisfactory completion of this investigation,
the individual begins a developuent period with the handling
Agent and after establishing a proven record of veliabliity,
siebllity and productiveness, becomes a Headquarters approved

nformant.

The Bureau's informants, particularly in the internal
security field, have uany restrictions imposed upon their
relationship with the Bureau. For example, they are impressed
with the confidential nature of thelr relationship with the
BBX, that their actions are strictly voluntary and that they
ave not employees, If they are connected in any way with a
labor union, they are informed that the Bureau is not
interested in an employee-enployer relationship or if
connected with an institution of learning, they ave specifically
advised that the Bureau is not interested in the legitinate
activities of educational institutions, In particular, all
informants are instructed to avoid knowledze of defense plans
and strategy or discussion thereof with attorneys, subjects
or other individuals in any prosecution arising fron intelligence
or ¢rininal investigations. In the event an informant is_
unable to avoid obtaining such inforuation, this inforaation

is not to be reported te the FBI, A signed statement, if
possible, is obtained from each informant so that the informant
is aware of the Bureai's position in these matters. {A copy
of bet Signed statement appears herein as Attachment number
one.

Fron the time Snecial Agents enter New Agent's
Clase they are indoctrinated and trained in the legal
aapects of the Bureau's work ag well as the scope and
linlts of their authority, The Manual of Rules and
Regulations spécifically addresses the conduct of Special
ASgents in their investigative duties, Gee Manual of Rules
and Regulations Attachment number two.) Training
continues in their offices of assignnent, each office having
a Legal Officer available for training, consultation and
guidance, Frequent, extensive In-Service retraining
programs further bolster the Special Agents' knowledge and
utilization of the law in the conduct of theix official
duties. Specifically, informant development and handling
are extensively discussed in the FBI's training programa
and there is no quéstion as to Special Agents being aware
that informants cannot be directed to perform 3 function
that the Special Agent may not legally perform. Special
Agents are particularly reminded of the need to he alert
to plants, potential agent provocateurs to be used against
Zay enforcement in a variety of ways, so as to avoid
unfounded allegations of impropriety which may jeapardize
investigations ox prosecutions as well as result in highly
publicized contrived incidents reflecting adversely on
iaw enforcement. 5

Heny of our informants furnish needed and valuable
information on a gratuitous basis, Many are also paid for
their services. Payments to informants are one of the most
highly supervised areas within Bureau operations, When
@ payment ig made to an informant, the handling Agent must
mak@ a realistic determination as to the value of theservices
performed by the informant, Established Bureau procedure
requires that payments made to informants, upon recommendation
of handling Agent and approval of appropriate supervisory
personnel, originate from the office Field Support Account
and are drawn from this account by check made out to the
handling Agent for the amount authorized, The handling

Agent cashes the check at a local bavk and then pays the
informant the authorized amount in cash for which a reevipt
is received from the informant and maintained in FBI

files, Although there is no overall memorandum of instruction
ox document dealing with cost effectivencss as it relates to
informants, this factor is considered by the Spedsl Agent
handling the inforaant, his supervisor, and the Special Agent
in Charge. Payuents to informants for services are made
commensurate with the value of information furnished and

for actual expenses incurred in connection with obtaining
information for the FBI. Recommendations concerning

paynents to informants on a regukay basis receive cavetul
consideration at Headquarters leyel, Aiter analysis and
couparison with peynents currently being nade to other
anforaants operated under similar circumstances and providing
Sinilar-type information, outhority ig extended nt Headquerters
to pay informants for services and expenses within prescribed
limits, When payuents are authorized by Headquarters, it

is the personal responsibility of each Special Agent in
Charge to definitely assure that full value is being received.
His review is on an individual basis wherein he evaluates the
information received and the amount being recommended by

the handling Agent for payment for this specific inforantion,
Additionally, instructions provide that each Cpecial Acent

in Charge is to insure that all pending informant files

are reviewed pexsonally by appropriate supervisory personnel
on a veguiar periodic basis not to exceed 2 period of 60 days,
This review includes, but is not limited to, assurance that
full value bas been received for ali paywents made to
informants, Also the entive informant prosrvan is subject

to annual review by our Inspection Staff which physically
examines informant files to assure that they are being
handled properly and that paynents are being nado
commensurate with the value of information received,

In addition to the above controls and restrictions,
information furnished from informants is constantly
sifted, analyzed, recorded and disseminated, The inforuation
is verified where possible through other sources and
individual investigation, A system of checks is constantly
involved to prevent an informant from producing erroneous
information by accident or design.

the use of informants appears impractical and nay be
unconstitutional, Ft is impractical because probable cause
usually is not available when the informant technique is
initiated and the submission of an affidavit in spplication |
for a warrant would increase the hazard of exposure of the
infornant's identity, Such a limitation might be unconstitutional
because it would Limit the First Amendment rights of the
informant to communicate with the Government, Existing legal
restrictions require guided informants to recognize the sane
legal limitations ag would be applicable, in the same circun-
stances, to those directing the informants. An informant can
legally do no move than an Agent is permitted te do.

The Bureau in the domestic intelligence area has under
investigation organizations, most of which have nuuecrous districts,
regions, offices, sections, chapters and clubs. These organiza~
tions and their subdivisions total over 1100, which receive |
investigative attention to some extent, These investigations
aye afforded coverage by less than 1100 internal security
infornants, Et nust be recognized, however, that there are
other individuals whe are in various stages of development in
this field, Concerning payaeuts, one-half of one percont (,07)
of the Bureau's budget (fiscal 1076) was utiliized to pay ail
types of security infornants including those in the toreign

Ag noted, the Bureau's utilization of informants

inforuants furnish a wealth of related information which

and other federal agencies Located 21 individuais.

Local and state law enforcement authorities loceted 94
persons, Duxing the same time frame, internal security
informants provided information which led directly to
the recovery of property valued at approximately one-half
milion dollars, It must be further recognized that 2
warrant requirenent for use of informants would virtually
e@lininate access of law enforcement to this collateral
information xvesulting in uany crimes going unsolved or

The FBI believes the elements of close
supervision, restraint, Latitude and judgment are

being utilized by the FBI successfully in the operation

NOTE:

SSC, by letter dated 11/7/75, invited the Bureau
to submit a memorandum on our intelligence informant program
that could be inserted in the record of the testimony of
Bureau representatives at the proposed hearing, The hearing
on informants is tentatively scheduled for 12/2/75, Pursuant
to SSC request in the ahove referenced letter and as a result
of a conference with SSC Staf£ Member, Bob Kelley, the above

ATTACHMENT NO. 2

illegal Activities

Illegal activities on the part of any employee, in addition to being
unlawful, reflect on the integrity of the FBI and betray the trust and
confidence placed in it by the American people. Furthermore, unlawful
activities can disqualify him for employment by the Government of the
United States. It is, therefore, expected that employees will obey not only
the letter of the law but the spirit of the law as well whether they be
engaged in transactions of a personal or official naturee With respect to
investigative activities, this admonition particularly applies to entrap-
ment or the use of any other improper, illegal, or unethical tactics in the
procurement of evidence. In this regard, it should be especially noted that,
in securing information concerning mail matter, the Bureau will not

tolerate a violation of law (Title 18, USC, §§ 1702, 1703, 1708, and 1709).
Furthermore, employees must not tamper with, interfere with, or open mail

in violation of law nor aid, abet or condone the opening of mail illegally
by any employee of the U. S. Postal Service.

As members of a Federal investigative agency, FBI employees must at all
times zealously guard and defend the rights and liberties guaranteed to

all individuals by the Constitution. Therefore, FBI employees must not
engage in any investigative activity which could abridge in any way the
rights guaranteed to a citizen of the United States by the Constitution
and under no circumstances shall employees of the FBI engage in any con-
duct which may result in defaming the character, reputation, integrity,

or dignity of any citizen or organization of citizens of the United States.

Employees must not install secret telephone systems or microphones without
Bureau authority.

No brutality, physical violence, duress or intimidation of individuals by

our employees will be countenanced nor will force be used greater than
that necessary to effect arrest or for self-defense.
