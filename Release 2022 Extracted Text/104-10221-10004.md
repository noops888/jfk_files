as a Cuban "agent" (degree of Cuban control unknown). Subjort was a
foanding menbor of tho MIN. In an article in Sterpre in Merch 1953 ho
advoeated tha foundation of a new political psrty reflecting tho tdsolozy
ef General Laxero Cardenas, leftist former President of Mexico. This

weuld have provided, in his helfe?, tho Mextean left a political organt-
ustion trely responsive te tho radics) tendancies ef the 1919 revolation,
This vas msesusary because tho MLH, wnoas membership covers the spectrum
of Hexiean Coszunis’ Party to PAI, could not take open politiesl stands
without antagonining sone of the teabership. Tho new party would have
represented a "third position", sesialisa in internal affairs ard inde~
pendence of any bloo in international affairs. With a party such ca this
an ite political sotion ara, the ALA would have developed naterally into
a bread national movewont such ag tho FRAP in Chile. (Sexo aperioas

1. (Summary: Popular Socinlist Party (PPS) attitudes toward the
arrest of Victor Rico Galan and othora on charges of conspiring

intends to stay outside the entire matter although PPS Sec-
retary General Vicente Lombardo Toledano may seize the oppor-
tunity to strike back at some of his enemies by issuing a
statement condemning the plans attributed to Rico Galan,
Within tho Party there ie considerable skopticium about the
truth of the published charges. While several Party leaders
do not doubt that there is some truth to the charges they aro
quite convinced that there was no danger of imminent rebellion
and that Mexican institutions stood in no peril from Rico
Galan snd his friends, Given the enorgy and efficiency with
which the Mexican Government has dealt with less selodramatic
threata in the past, une cannot but suspect that it is merely
a tried end truc Government maneuver. Also, it is believed in
the PPG that police accounts of their role in the matter have
been ezaggerated to enhance the reputation of the police both
with the President ond with the public, The rumor that the
Guatesalan Governzont may hove asked the Mexican Government
to silence Hico Galan because of his violent attacks against
the pew Guatezalan administretion ia generally discounted

t wince the complaints of Guatemalan officials are certainly

of no concern to Mexico.)

COMYIDENTIAL/NO FOREIGN DISSEM
fe -2-

Victor Rico Galan ond bis essociates can expect neither syn-
pathy nor help from the Popular Socialist Party (PPS - Partido
Popular Socialiats). Although no official decision haa yet
been made by the Prrty, PPS iesdors who have comsented un-  -
officially on the natter have said that for tho momont the .
Party vill no doubt stay completely outside the whole effeir,
thus proving its total lnck of interest in this type of revo-
lutionary activity,. It 1a of course possible that PPS Secretary
General Vicente Lombardo Toledano will soize tho opportunity to
issue 2 statement condemning the entire affsir ag Trotskyist,
criminal, and utopian. Lombardo may decide to uso this oppor=
tunity to strike beck at tho National Liberation Movement

(MLK - Movinionto de Liberacion Mactqanee and others who have

attackod hin.

Among leaders of both the PPS and the General Union of Workers
and Peasants of Hexico (UGOCM - Union General de Obreros. y
Campesinos de Mexico), there is s certain skeptician about the-
truth of the matter as it has been presented in the press. -
It 1s probebly true that arms and materials for manufacturing
explosives 'e confiscated. It is probably true that indoc-
trination sessions’ on political and revolutionary matters
probably were held in thes houses where the arrests were made.
And probably the group did have some kind of plan for action.
But, it {8 Simply not true that there was the slightest danger
of inmediate ‘and formidable rebellion from Rico Galan and his

friends,

This latter conclusion is based on the fact that Rico Galan

is no guerrille leader, He ig an aggrossive intellectual, a
radical, but he is not in ja: for what he hoe done but for

hia ideas. As for‘Roul Ugal Alvarez, named with Rico Galan

as one of the leaders of the group, he has tho reputation of
being fuzzy-minded, a leftist advonturer and certainly neither
brave nor dedicated. Further, and Rico Galan is well aware

of this, popular support 1s essential to the success of rebellion.
None exists. The peamanty are divided. The workers are controlled
by tho Governnent, and the middle-clans ts content with tho way
things are. Also, there is the formidable precedent of Govorn-
ment action ageinst any kind of rebellion, trade union, armed,
and particularly any sort of activity which is Cuban-connected.

“The Governnent has always moved with energy, speed, and effi-

ciency to coabat such threste as, for oxample, during the
Railway Yorkers Strike of 1959, Several leaders of that strike
ere still in jail and likely to remain there. Anothor example
is the September 1965 attack on a military camp st Ciudad Maderc,
Chihuahua, While the Governuent did not feel that his incident
posed any real. threat to it, it did not want the bad interna-
tional publicity, so vigilance waa increased, activities of
would-be guerrillas were blocked, some vere bought off with
money, others with prowlses and the astter was promptly and
efficiently controlled.

There no doubt 1s a degree of truth to police charges, but

the melodramatic, slucst childish character given to the Rico
Galan movement, the lack of any proven connection between the
movesent and jestist/Communist organizations, Rico G-lan's
open sad woll-Xnown connections with Guatemalan guerrilla
leadore and his public support of the Cuban revolution, make
4t very hard to discount the suspicion that thie is simply a
Government asnouver. Also, while the police no doubt did
confiscate ores snd other materials, the suspicion exists that
the police have inflated their role in order to wake theaselves
look goud both to the President and to public opinion.

CONFIDENTIAL/NO FOREIGN DIBSEY



CONFIDENTIAL/NO FOREIGN DISSEN
3-0

Thore {@ even a rumor that because of Rico Galan'’s harsh attacks
on the new Guatomalan administration, the Guatemslan Governsent
asked the Mexican Governuent to deal with Rico Galan. This
rumor howover ia regarded o# rather ridiculous sinco the

Mexican Government certainly cares Ue for tho opinion

of Guatemalan officials.

3. ON 15 AUGUST JULIAN LOPEZ DIAZ, CUBAN PRESS AND CULTURAL

matters of great importance to him ond to Mexican Prosidont
Gustavo Diaz .Ordaz, Or, he added, was it that Jphnson had
come to gf instructions, or orders, to continuo his policy
of oppression of the pooplo, in this instance Moxico,

Calderon criticized sharply tho Mexican Governmgnt for its
methods in organizing the olaborate reception for President
Johnson, Tho system of hording together the populace is
accomplished, among othor means, through threats mado by
union leaders. to workers that they will lose a Way's pay or
suffer othér losses if thoy do not participate in welcoming
ceremonies. Calderon denounced officials of the Ministry
of Foreign Relations for having remained silent in tho face

“ ef a proposal by Sccrotary of State Dean Rusk fo¢ tho creation

of an international police force - "the typo of gecurity
forcé that has in‘the past protected countries ffom North

American aggression".

Again on 28 April the MLN hold a meeting in observanco of
Dominican Week, this one attended by approximately twenty-
five persons. It was announced at the last moment that the
journalist Alberto Domingo, who was to have attended tho
meeting, would not be present because of a moro pressing

engagement. In his absence Armando Castillejos Ortiz. .
Castillejos -

and the poetosa Norma Corrasco improvised a program,
expressed regret. that the’MLN does not possess adequate
publishing facilities to keep the Mexican public informed

of the existing situation in the Dominican Republic. Ho
recommended that those present take advantage of every oppor~
tunity, in their places of work and at gatherings elsewhere,
to disseminate by word of mouth the facts of North American
domination over the weaker nutions of the world, io noted
that ninety percent of the citizens of the United States

are not in accord with U.S, foreign policy.

Norma Carrasco'’s contribution to the mecting consisted of
the reading of pootry which sho had composed depicting the

gréficc: de una cinta magnetofénica grabada por mf. Como existié, en
efecto, una cinta que yo grabé, y como en el “pastiche” publicado por
B Heraldo se utilizan frases que pronuncié realment», creo necesario
explicar Ia historia de todé ello.

Visité por primera vez Guatemala en octubre dot%63: En ol nimero
do SIEMPRE! dei 30 de‘ean mes y aio, aparecié publiccida una entrovis-
ta mia con el coronel Enrique Peralta Azurdia, que ae iniciaba con esta
descripcién de su porsona: “E# coronel Enrique Peralta: Azurdia, “hom-
bre {uerte” de Guatemala, 90 da de ninguna manera la impresion de ser
fuerte. Por el contrario; és oscuro, de hablar premiceo, con una cons-
tonte actitud tmida 7 sin brillanter olguna. No tieno exe tono decidido

el objeto de obtener una fetegratia”. -

Esa discrota sugerencia de su tortennudez mental enfurer6 al coro:

rae que dake haber hecho cuands el colega thilens publicé cu propio

ior coronel!

Lo cierto es que ol hombre intenté en reiteradas ocasiones cumplit
su promesa. Con motive de su informe de gebierno, tunzmitid2 por ta-
dio y televisign a toda Guatemala, me acusé de haber ido a ete pals a
organizar “grupos de choque”, y la AP y Ia UPi se encargaron de difun-
dir la noticia, que la porriols, nacionelista y solidaria prensa mancana
publied profusamente. El coronal “se vengaba”, y yo eallé por no dar
impertancia a Ia irritacién de un perscnaje tan menor, ietacién que,
por otra parte, me explicaba perfectamente.

Regresé a Guctemala un afio deseués, precisamente en octubre
de 1964. Y, olectivemerte, grabé un mensaje en cinta magnetoténica,
dectinados a varios guerniieros a los que no pude ver Nad tenia de

es también importante hacer notar: Prensa Libro, tun oficialista que aco

A Portrait of a Castro-Commuanlet avs ple
Agent

. :
Victor Rico Galan waa born 6 Fobruary 1928 in El Ferrol, Spain. He is

Spanieh by birth, bocame a Mexican citizen by naturalization in March 1949.

He {s married to'Ingeborg Diener de Rico Galan, born 11 May 1929 in Med co

City.. Ho reaidos at Ernostina Larrainzar 19-B, Col, del Valle in Mexico City.

He'writes for both Slempra, Mexico City leftiet newo-waekly, and Politica,

pro-Communtst bi-weekly newomagazino. :

VRG reportedly talked to Fidel Castro and Cho Guevara in 1961 regarding
the formation of the Movimiento de Liberacion Nac: (MLN) in Meteo,
With their approval ho beaamo one of the founding members of the MLN and
later headed tho MLN Prees and Propaganda Committas, Ina speech to tho
MLN in April 1962 he stated, ‘Tho government muct be made to uaderatand that
only the people havo tho right te violonco,” (Thie was in reference to the
Mexican governmont repression of the Coramuniot Party and ite arrect of

David Alvaro Siqaioros.)

In an article tn Slempro in Mazch 1963 VRG advocated the formation of a
now political party reflocting the {deology of General Lazaro Cardenas, former
Preaidont of Mexico. VRG eaid thie new political party waa nsoded to traly
ropresont the radical tendencles of the 1910 revolution. VRC conceived this new
party ag tha political arm of tha racently-furmed MLN, which could nus develop
into a bread natlonal pro-Communist movement Mio the FRAP ia Chile,

VRG hag always been very close ond syrmpathotte to the Castre-Cukan
revolution, In i961 he was a member of the Pexjolsjas Mexicanos Amigos dy
Gute. Also in 1961 he was reportad to be a member of the Commitiss for
Solidarity with the Cyban Revolution, la March 1942 ha waa reportedly a
raembor of a group of four pro-Castroites who made an abortive physical attack
on Emilio Uranga, writer for Slamprg-who has written siiti-Caatro fiems, Ae
the group converged on Uranga other mernbera of the Slompra stadt intervened
and tha matter waa settlad without violence.

“From October to December 1962 VRG waz in Cuba, aa a correspondent

of Fidel Castro. In an article written for Sigmpre while ho waa in Cuba
(Sigmpre 31 Oct 62) be extols tho grost Cuban revolution and the advantages
Castroism has brought to the lowor cl: . Ina later article (Siempre

14 Nov 62) he attacke the Soviet Union and Khrushchev for their weakness during
tho Cuban missile crisis, Ho refers to Fidel Castro ae being the vanguard of
the revolution against Colonialiem,

2

From Iate.May to mid Juno 1963 VRG was again in Cuba, thie time to
interview Fidel Castro following tho latter's return {rom the Seviet Union,
VRG reportedly spent 8 days with Fidel Caétro, five of thain aboard the Cuban
leados's yacht, and also interviewed other Cuban leaders, including Blas Roca,
Secrotary-General of the Partido Socialista Popular (PSP + Cuban Communist
Party); Ernesto "Cha" Guevara Serna, Minietor of Industries; Oswaldo
Dorticos Torrado, Cuban President; and Raul Roa Garcia, Minister of Foraign

Rolations,

Tt was during this May-June 1963 contact with Fidol Castro and othar Cuten
leaders that VRG received a major operational assignment. He was given the
mission of traveling through Contral acd South America tu contact local
Commanfot and guerrilla leaders, Hie Job was to persuade these groups to begin
campaigns of violence and terror immediately in order to take the prossura off.
the FALN tn Venosueia, whose program of terror, heavily subsidized by Castro,
waa beginaing to run inte increased zesiatance from the Veneauslan governmont
forces, On this trip VAG alao had the mission of bringing about greater unity
among the varicus Gammunist and terrorist groupa.

In lato 1963 VRG undertook his assigned mission, He traveled to Panama,
Guatemala, Costa Rica, Vaenesuela, Nicavagua and Brasil aod contacted key
Communists in each of theea countrias,

Among the Commualet leader which VRG contacted an this trip were
Hugo Victer, Prosidont of the Partido de! Puoble (PDP - Peogla's Party,
a Communist group) and David Turner, a leader of the ard of National
Agtign (VAN - a pro-Cuban, radical revolutionary organisation) in Panama;
Gomes Ayay, a guerriiia leader tn Cuateniala; ant Francisco Juliao, the

_ tevolutiomazy peasant leader, {n Brasil,

In Nicaragua VRG snot several timee with Alvaro Ramirea Gonzales,
Secrotary-Ganoral of the Moyilizacion Rapublicana (MR - Cowununtet Political
Freon who wae also 5 membor of the Central Cammittes af tho
in Nicaragua (PEN), the Nicaraguan Communist Party, VRG's



Bs,

=3-

Ramiren was given considerable radio and press publicity in Nicaragua, The
procs referred to "secret meetings" in VRG's hotel room betwen Ramires
and VRG, Ramires-anewered by writing letters to the newgpapers, saying he
met VRG quite openly in his office and that VRG had called on him because ho
{VRG) wao a logitimate journalist who was seoking interviews with various
political figures, On 24 October Ramirez was interviewed on radio and
finally reluctantly admitted that he had gone to VRG's hotel room. He said
ble purpose in going thore was to take VRG to his (Ramirez's) office, :

tn Panama VRG stayed at the Hotel International. While in Panama he
visited US installations and was seen taking many pictures, Ile talke with
Hugo Victor and David Turner wore aimed at getting the VAN and the PDP to
resolve their differences and to unite. Turner briefed VRG on VAN's preparations
to establish an armed movement in Panama, Victor, on the other hand,
opurnod VRG'a to unify the two groaps.

Following thie trip in late 1963, VRG returned to Cuba (in January 1964)
aad visited Fidel Castro again and to report on the results of hia contacts with
Central and Latin American Comzauntst leadors.

In late March 1965 VRG (with hia wife) again traveled to Cuba to scport
to Cuban leaders. ile raturned to Mexico in aarly April 1965.

In May 1964 VRG was invited to visit Red China, ostensibly as a gucet of
the All-China Journalisto Association, which indicated it would be willing to
pay all costs, including transportation, Because of other preasing work In
connection with hid assignments on behalf of Castro, VRG did not accept this

invitation,

Over the yeara 1961 to 1965 VRG's contacts with the Cuban Enibaasy in
Mexico have ineroased steadily. He meets frequently and regularly with
various officials of the Cuban Embassy, asually at his hore, at the Sempra
offices or at the hames of the Cuban officials in Mexico City.

Hie rnost frequont contact is with Manuel Eugenio Voga Peres, Third
Secretary of the Cuban Embaeoy and chiof representative of the Dirrecion Gonaral
da Intoligeacia (DGI - Cuban Intelligence Service) in Moxico, Obese and outwardly
jolly, Yoga Pores waa the driver of a beer truck in Havana prior to the Cuban
Revolution which launched him on his intelligence caraor. :



“4°

Another VRG Cuban intelligence contact is Ramon Sinobas Casado, Counselor
of the Cuban Embassy. Sinobas is Voga's assistant in’handling" VRG. It io
apparent that these contacts are primarily for the purpose of channeling VRG's
roporte and instructions to and from Cuba. In the course of hie work as an
agent for Castro and the DGI, VRG is known to have acted as a courier, carrying
material and large sume of money to pro-Cuban groups in Central and Latin
American countries,

In October 1964 VRG received another important assignment fram hie
Cuban masters. VRG was requested to travel to Guatemala to make a personal
survey of the otrength and weaknesses of Marco Antonio Yon Sova's guerrilla
forces and to lay the basis for a mora energetic implemontation in Guatemala
of the tactical principles for guorrilla warfare laid down by "Gho" Guevara,
This was, in effect, a follow-up to his varllar vicit to Yon Sosa during his
swing through Contral American countriee in late 1963, At that timo, VRG
attempted to perouade Yon Sosa to align himself more closely with Castro's
objectives in Latin America, The rooutto of thie vieit to Guatemala ware
written up by VRG ina special report to Castro, VRG's conclusions at that
tine were not completely favorable to Castro,

Yon Sosa in known to do a forceful and indopendent guerrilla loader who
pridao himself on his ability to maintain aimseli and hin followers independently
of ideological gadance from either Havana, Paking or Moscow, although he le
quite willing to eccept arma and financial support from xny of theee Communist
capitals. In the past Castro's efforta to bring Yon Sona te hoel have bean
thwarted mainly by tha iniluance tha Chinose Communists have bean able to
exert over the Guaterialan guerriiia leader. In additlon to the direct afd
provided by Peking to Yon So hip guerrillas in Northaastera Guatomala,
thare fe the fact cf Yon Sova'a Chinose background (Yon Soaa's father was
Chinese) which has sexved to tle him emotlonally to the Red Chinave.

It wap tho continuing recalcitrant attitude of Yon Sowa which apparently
prompted VRG'a second misoion ta Guatemala in Qctober of 1964. VRG was
inatructed not only to talk to Yon Sosa but also to try to influency Yon Sosa's
gaerrilla forcea directly in line with Castro's objectives. In addition to prapared
matarial which VRG uaed for locturing the guerrillas he Lrought with him special
propaganda films for indoctrination purposes,

In late October 1944 the Guatemalan authorities captured number of tape
recordings from Yon Sosa's guerrillas following a guerrilla attack on a government



garrison, Included in these tapeo wae one made by VRG for delivary to the
guerrillas during hic carly October vioit with thom, A copy of this tapo is
attached. The tape concfsts mainly of an oxhortation by VRG for unity (between
the Partido Guatemalteco del Trabajo (PGT) and the 13 November Group}

and 4 plea not to permit ideological argumonts to replace action, In this epeech
VRG reveals himself to be a hard-headed revolutionary activist, not merely an
intellectual loftiot, His approach to revolution is completely practical, not the >

oretical,

To cover hio miosion as a Castro political action agent to Yon Sosa, VRG
later published an “intorviow" with the latter (In Siempre No. 593, 4 November

1964),

YRG'o involvement in the recent Dominican crisis io the latest example of
his work on behalf of Castro. In early January 1944 VRG travalled to Santo
Domingo, returning « week later to Mexico, Ostensthly this trip wae to report
on Dorniniean Kopublic affairs for Slamprg, Actually this was merely 8 cover
for a Communist propaganda ausignment, Shortly after VIG left Santo Domingo,
thousands of copies of a pro-Cuatro brochure, entitled "Sieaprg visita lo
Dominicana" and signed VRG, wore dietriimted among Cornrauniote and
Communist sympathizers in the Dominican Republic. A copy of thia brochure

iu attached,

During hie January 1964 tsip VAG contacted both the Moviraiento Popular
Reminicans (MPD), a terroriotic revolutionary Marxiet-Leniatot snd atrong
pro~Chicom group, and the l4th of Juna Movement, the Agrupacton Politica
Gatorca do Junio (APCJ), a militant, revolutionary pyo-Gastro group, Hie
contact with the MPD resuited in his furnishing matarial to the subversive
MPD publication, Libertad, But his principal contact, ous that developed
rapidly into a very active relationship in tho period proceeding the Dominican
crisia, wae with Juan B, Majia, leader’of the APCJ, These two have maintains:
eloso and {roquent contact over the past yaar, Durlag the Dominican crisis VRG
sarved aa A relay point for material and inatructions from Cubs to the APCI
and also acted a@ a reporting channel from Mejia to the DGI and the APCJ's

Castro-Cuban lsadership in Cuba,

' Ag in previous operations of thio xind, VAG cloaked his relationship
with Mojia under a journaliotic cover, An "Intarview" he conductad with Mejia
Appoared in tha 2 May 1965 issue of the Cuban aewopaper Moy, A copy of
tho text of that article fe attached,



‘known in journalistic circles in Max:

In mid-May 1965 a gaffa by Mejias and VRG's Cuban superiors exposed the
Mejia-VRG-Cuba channol publicly, In an article carried by Porto Alegre
(Brasil) nowopaper Gorreio do Povo on 20 May, datalined New York 19 May
by Loule Wisniaer, a Radio Havana broadcast of 18 May was reported to have
mentioned a declaration by Juan Mojia sont from Santo Domingo to VRG in Mexico,
who then sent the declaration to Radio Havana, After citing this channel by
which it received tho Mejia statement, Radio Havana proceeded to broadcaet
the following excerpts from the declaration: "Numerous leaders of tho 14 June
Party have disappeared but I (Majia) know that they are now in the mountaing :
leading guerrillas, The 14 Jung Party haa control of the situation in Santo :
Domingo," The Correig do Povg noted editorially that the Radio Havana broadcast
seeme to nogate the Castro effort to deny that the l4th June Movement in the
Dominican Republic ia tled to him, Tho article concludes by noting that Mejia
was one of the 58 Communists Heted by the Americana, and that thia confession
by Havana puts new Hight on the quaatioa af Ameriean intorvention in the
Dominican Republic. Not noted {x the article is the fact that YRG'e role as f
an intermediary between Mojla and Castro ie claarly exposed hy the Radio :
Havana broadcast. A copy of tha Gortals do Povo article Lo attacked.

When she Dominican rebellion erupted VRG began to agitate with the Slamapre_
staff for outright and total suppert to the pro-Castvo forces in the rabel camp,
Those offorts began to bear fruit whea VAG was sllowed to parsonally brief and
dispatch a Slempre cerrsepumont~photograpier tpam to the Dominican Republic
in early May 1965 to repore on tha crisia, The correagondent waa Luis Suarez
Lopoz; the photographer waa Lais Redrigo Moya Mozono, ‘the resulting articles
in Siempre produced by this VRG-Suaroz-Moya team ware violently anti-US and
pro-Castro Communiet in thely intoyprotation of the crisis -~ 80 much so that

- thay apparantly touched off a bitter dispute betwoos VRG and Jove Pagan Liergo,

Siempre director, who prefera to sitch to the traditional Siempre role of a
peoudo-indopendant outlet for a variety of le(tist causes. VRG's afforts to

reorient Siempra along more militant pro-~Commauntat Mnes has long beon
co and the Suares-Moye Incident appeara

to have precipitated an open fight between the two, WRC ia apparently aiming
for a showdown with Pages Liergo over this tasuc, since several Siempre
writers are known to Ia ve deen individually approached by VRG over the past
weeks to onllot their support against the provent Sleaipzg editorial policy,
which VRG regards aa too “opportunistic. '

: of 2 May replayed through hie friond.Hauro LUGENTINI of ANSA, Hew York, It ~
: wae felt that this approach would be nore desirable than using k/l _Girectdy,
in view of his offorte to appear as a liberal journalist. During the
meeting ¥/1 attempted to contact Lucentini, but’ ascertained that he had gone
eff on a holiday for the weekend. Upon learning that Lucentint would return
to Bow York City during the evening of 16 stay, it was agreed that ¥/1 would
contact him at that tine in an effort to havo tho story transaitted on 17
May. In addition to the major.capitala in Latin America, t/1.aleo thought,

that the story would be sent to Rone.

b. Follewing a ‘phone call from the KH Desk, KUTHENYOHD subsequently
briofed 4/1 on the fact that tha sano etery Lad heen carried in the 2 Hay
edition of Hoy in Havana, (UO-MENT: NUTIREFORD pointed out to the Head~
quartars rep that, da his opinion, it utgit not ba advisable to inform
Lucontini of the Hoy article ds it might raise an objection in his mind cone

of Lusentini, tald him that the radio broadcast. had urred on 13 Hay.
He did not mention the Hoy article, According wo u/1, Leceatint was lose
than enthusiastic alout transaitting the story throwh his facilities,
pointing out that 1t was no longer new. After some persuasion, according
to t/1, Lucentint finally ayrwai te cond the fojloving athreviated story
to Busnos Alres either the ovening of 15 May or early 17 My!

"Qn Friday, Hay 13, hadlo-Havann cited Juan 2, Majia leader of
foninican '14 of Juno’ party who bad given an intorvisw to Mexican
Jownslist Victor Lico Galan in vhich he declared over the talephone that

Finally gete thtough to Fundor: VaG ote that they talked to
Bosch lost night - at 2330. VkG couldn't cali him because line was out
to Cuba, Bosch madé sensations! declarations. MO will record it,

They change phones. They asked Bosch what hig opinion was of
the O.8.A. Commisaion. VkG did not talk, but a Dominican friend talked
to Bosch, However, theyr@corded the conversation, Bosch said sone
important thinga, Thig friead asked Bosch what he thought of OFA Con-
mision. Bosch said that 0.2.4. and nothém are tho sane thing. who
talked to Bosch. Marcio Mejia Xicart, They then asked Sosch if they
the U.S. marines had occupied the city, He said they hod and they
bad gotten as fax aga Avenida Nella, near downtown sea, but that the
armed civilians forced thea back until Avenida Haxino Gomez, about
3-1/2 Kilometera back. Ave. Maxiso Gomes is what one might call”
theis combat line since it ia the zone where the U.S, Embassy ia.

So, they asda them return to theie original pat pesitions, This took
place yesterday afternoon. But the sost important thing - they asked
Bogch what political solution Bosch saw. He answered "textually -

‘It appears that in Washington they are thinking of converting Santo
Domingo ina Fideicomigo.’ Then he commented ironically, 30 "we get

out of colonialism into independence.” VG says, that this is of course
very grave. Aa FP. kuows there are 2 of 3 Jeft in the world - of #
Pideicoaigog ~ in Southern Africa, This would be unprecedented cage -
that they convest an independent country into a country under Fidei-
comizo (Protectorates). When ejie xicart asked if they (U.S.) want

to convert "ug into a colony.’ Bogch replied. that - Yeo, into a colony
but with 23,000 armed sen, Civilians, of course. Bosch furthers anid
that “what. the people had done was something extracddinary and that he
hod complete fsither in the people," i, did not want to say eaything
to provoke the uprising of the people because he (Soseh) is ont of the
country “and from outside, this ia 4 comfertabie role. If 1 were inside
I would tuke up the cesponaibi lites,”

VxG had to pay the call since Pundore did net coll hia. VRC

VxG wAil let hin knoy when he has anything new.
