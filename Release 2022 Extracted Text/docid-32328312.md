- ADMINISTRATIVE -

: Information obtained from MM 794-C, an
inactive source, has been carefully paraphrased and included
in the body of this report in order that a more cohesive
picture may be had concerning YARAS' criminal activities,
particularly while in the Miami area.

CG 6758-C* advised that on May 28, 1964,
FELIX ALDERISIO, a Chicago. top hoodlum, JOHN D'ARCO,
former alderman, first ward, Chicago, MICHAEL BRODKIN,
Chicago attorney, discussed the fact that D'ARCO's son
was involved in an automobile accident in the Miami area,
which could result in his being expelled from the University
of Miami. According to this source,a payoff was or is
being made from Miami and the money for this payoff is
being sent from Chicago through MICHAEL BRODKIN to DAVE
YARAS. YARAS was then to pass this money on to the proper
individuals. It is noted that the person to be contacted
in Miami relative to YARAS' known whereabouts is MAX
LURIE, well known Miami criminal attorney, who represents

“DAVE YARAS.

It was ascertained by CG 6758-C* that YARAS was
ceSpected in the Chicago area sometime around the first of
June ,1964. This would give credence to information wherein
it was reported that YARAS makes monthly trips from Miami
to Chicago, said journeys being made around the first part
of each month.

These individuals related that they are in the
business of the home improvement field in Chicago, which
operates in interstate commerce. They advised that on
the advice of their attorney, whose name they refused to
divulge, they contacted the FBI and related the following
story:

They stated that approximately 5 to 6 weeks ago
they were approached by LEONARD PATRICK and DAVE YARAS.
They said that these individuals told them that they would
have to start making payoffs amounting to $1,000.00 per week.
They advised that PATRICK and YARAS made no indication as
to the reason for the payoff, but knowing the reputation
of these two, they were fearful of them. The complainants
stated that after some negotiation with YARAS and PATRICK
they agreed to make a payment of $1,250.00 per month
commencing Saturday, April 6, 1957.

They stated that they had discussed this payoff
with other individuals in the home improvement industry and
found that they too had been approached and some were
actually making payoffs.

These unknown complainants refused to furnish their
names, the name of their company or the name of their attorney.
They stated they did.not want to get mixed up in any investi-
gation in which they might become potential government
witnesses against YARAS and PATRICK.

In February, 1964, MM T- ] advised of the following:

In the early part of 1963 informant obtained an
‘option for the operation, of a gambling casino at the Normandy
Hotel, San ‘Juan, Puerto Rico, where informant has other
business interests.

Informant was anxious to obtain financial backing on a
partnership basis in this venture and in July, 1963, he

read an article in the magazine section of a Miami,

Florida newspaper indicating that SAM GIANCANA, the well
known Chicago hoodlum, was seeking partnership arrangements
with American businessmen who could operate or obtain
gambling concessions in the Caribbean area and South America,
which article indicated that GIANCANA was interested in
investment in such ventures.

Subsequently, the informant made a contact with
a friend of his and asked how GIANCANA could be approached.
The friend told the informant that he knew one of GIANCANA's ~
close business associates and would arrange a contact.

Sometime later informant received a telephone call
from one DAVE (LNU) and TEDDY (LNU), who claimed to be
GIANCANA's business associates and desired a meeting to
discuss this matter.

Informant met with DAVE and TEDDY in Miami and they
“seemed to know considerable information concerning informant's
financial standing, the fact that his resources were
committed and the fact that the’brother of informant was
a principal controller of their business interests.

On or about October 19, 1963, the informant. met’
TEDDY and DAVE at the Americana Hotel, New York City. At
this meeting DAVE and TEDDY began talking about "protection"
and the ability of GIANCANA and: his syndieate to furnish
slot machines for the gambling operation. With this turn
in the negotiations, based upon the informant's original
understanding that GIANCANA desired to invest money, ‘the
informant insisted upon seeing GIANCANA, DAVE and TEDDY
gave him no encouragement along this line and told informant .
it was not necessary to contact them but that they would
contact him, always from a pay phone from wherever they were
calling. i‘.
