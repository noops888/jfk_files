MEMCRANDUM FOR: Mr. James &. Hunt, Jr.,
Deputy Chief, Cl Staff

SUBJECT: Micanst.C, SUMAN (201-308566)
7 Mutual Contact of William Hamiltoa MARTIN
and of AEMUSICAL

REVERENCE: Your Memorandum dated 13 Cctober 1961
BEE => wet “Phe M i 4 Caso"

‘ 1. Thank you very much for your memorandum of 13 October,
referenced above, and for the enclosed contact report, including
ALMUSICAL'o report on the information he acquired from Subject
eoncerning the latter's iutcrview by OXI and contact with Willlam
Hamilton MARTIN, Noither the Mographic data on SUMAN contained
therein, nox hio close scsoclation with beth MARTIN and Bernea
Forgusen MITCHELL were known to us hitherto. Neither were we

-aware of his apparently extensive correspondence with MARTIN. It
has net been ible to date to verify through special sources whether
Sabject'e coveespondenca- with MARTIN continued after MARTIN's
diseppearance from tho United States. We-have not au yot received
the latest NSA report of investigation, which would include the CRI
seport of istervicw of Subject, since thio document spparently bas
bees delayed in publication and transmittal, Howevar, we have been
eévised that the document in question should be available im spprozi-
mately one week to ten days, at which time we shall provide you —
the ONJ report of their interview of Subject. ;

2, In repty to the query outlined in paragraph 3 of your memo-
Fandum, we seo Uitle point in attompting te discourage AEMUSICAL
from passing this information te the Soviets, both on basis of his past
performance in reporting, and because the KGB undoubtedly already is
aware of SUMAN‘s rolationship to MARTIN, MITCHELL and AEMUSICAL.
As a consequence, if would not appear necessary to request ONI to
clear thie information for passage to the Soviets by AZMUSICAL, par-
ticularly since it must be assumed thet the KGB is monitoriag all mail
sent and received in the USSR by MAATIN and MITCHELL. la order
to simplify the handling of this information both within thie Agency and
the customer agencies involved, it is suggested that a straight CSCI

4. Your particular attontion 1o invited to the fact that review of
the TIDRAMA Operational Files revoaled that the buik of the reporting
oa this case, including the identities of TIDRAMA=1/ALMUSICAL's
persenai acquaintances, contacts, and operational reporting targets oH
on whom he has passed information to the KGB, have never been
indexed into RID indices, and therefore are not reflected in a name
chsck submitted by other desks or divisions to the Central RID/Index i
Section. Ae a consequence such same check will not ia any manner

reflect to the requestor that there is any information on such individual
hold ip WE/1, even though extensive information may be available, and
even iudexed in WE/1 card files. This velume of uniodexed reporting
ingludes ioterzal CIA communications between Headquarters and Field

@ copy of the momorandum itself, or of the information relayed thereia
wae made gvailable to UNI by NSA prior tc actual ONI contact and tnter-
view of SUMAN, Ao a result of our receipt of the information forwarded
with your referenced memorandum, a physical recheck was conducted
ea 19 October 1961 of all RID/Index cards on file in Central A1D/Index
in the surname of SUMAN, This exercise revealed that ae of that date
thore vere absolutely ao carda filed under the naine of Michael C,
SUMAN as ef that date. This check was made prior to our contacting
ef Mr. Granguist tater that day or shortly thereaftor, with regard to
poseible prior reporting un SUMAN, which may have been provided by
the agent in advasce of the latest report. Mr. Granquiot readily
admitted that there had been some previous reporting, but otated that
none of these references had been indexed in or for HJD/Index, since
he docen't believe in indexing every name that appears in operational
Yaporting a3 a contact of the agent, that is “unlese.we have some
operational izterest in. such person, and heretofore wa have never had - pa sted
aay euch Interest in SUMAN, ' He also indicated that SUMAN's name
had been passed to the AGS by ALMUSICAL - some time ago, probably
around ths turn of the year, '' but was. not ablo to-come up. immediately
with a epocific- date or reference tn which details uf this report te the
MGB was recorded, He alee indicated.that despite passage some time
ago (actually about 18 months prior to the report forwarded with refer
ence) by AEMUSICAL. of Michasl.C. SUMAN's mme to the KGB ae an
individual with whom the agent maintained personal contact, he did not
fool that thio fact, por sa, traneformed SUMAN into the category of
persore “ol eperational interest to us.” When queriad for further
Geile on such reporting, Granquist indicated “thet he thought he knew

. Just about where these reports were located in the file, " and volunteered
to extract the pertinent informaticn and forward same to this office,
However, he indicated that he did not believe he would be able to lot
us borrow ths actual 201 file, which is on permanent charge to W E/1,
and to permit us further detailed etudy of the material therein, since
the files were in constant use at the desk, However, he went on to stato
that he would be perfectly willing to let us borrow the earlier TIDRAMA
files held by tira, Wecker, if we preierrod to. conduct such review
eureetves, rather than relying upon his:review and extracting of pertinent

materiale from these files, This offer was accepted, and Mrs. Potochi
subsequently borrowed the files held by Mrs. Wecker; the recults of
this check raveated the details of ALMUSICAL's reporting en his cone
tacts with SULMAN, insofar as such details are roflected in the TIDRAMA
operational files, and are summarised in Enclosure A. -- -

$. It is obvious from even a rolatively superficial review cf theese
materials, that AEMUSICAL has never been questioned in detail by his
CLA case officers on hio relattonohip with or te SUMAN and a number of
other individuals, whose names appear throughout this correspondence.
either docs he appear to have beon debricfed in depth on the substance
of the information he passed to the Soviets on ouch persons during the
individual meetings he had with the KGH, much lese regarding the
reactica of the KGB handler to any of the names, or the follow-up
querice put to him by tho Soviet Case Cificer orally during the course
of any particular meeting whon such information was passed. This
statement, of coarse, is based upon tho operational reporting prepared
by the Case Officer in Stockholm, and 1s obvieuely subject to pocsible
correcticn in the event euch details are covored in the individual cone
tact reports prepared after cach meeting by the CIA handler, such
veporto not having bocn scanned or read in the course cf thie review,
Uni such dotails do appear in the contact reports, it would appoar
that eourre has withbeld much of the detail of his conversations with
Bde Soviet handler, elther ca s uitting baste the motivation for which
must be cotchlished, or unwittingly, poosibly because he-wan not asked
for these details, Under the circumstances, you may wish to consider -
undertabicg.a thorough Ci review of the entire AEMUSICAL case, in
order that a detailed debriefing of the agent may be undertaken upon
bie return to the United Stateo, and prior te hie re-traasfer to the con-
trol of tha FEI. We noto that despite indications to tho field that the
dosk was proparing traces on AEMUSICAL's multitudinous contacts,
the files reviewed reflect the rasults of such Iracing efforts on oaly a
small propertion of the agent's asvociates and contacts.

6. It io requested that the writer be kept advised of any further
ection contemplated in thia case, ao well as of any further information
developed about source's contact with SUMAN or any other persons

ENCLOSURE A

Reconstructed Chronology of KGB Knowledge of Michael C. SUMAN's
Connection with AR MUSICAL and with Z2GRACE Principaie:

1, Per CSCI-3/760, 672, dated 12 July 1960, addressed to the
FBI, oz p.uge 11 there te rnentioned « “general questioning by SLABOV
of AEMUBICAL with regard to hie contacte in the U.S, during the
meoting between SLASOV and AEMUSICAL on 15 itay 1959, It must
be presumed that SUMAN's name likely came up at thia time, .in tight.
of information developed at a later date ahowing 5U MAN (to bave been
the person who exerted tho most influence over AZ MUSICAL ia his
youth, according to ALMUSICAL's own admission.

2, Atthe 16 July 1959 meeting with SLABOV, his KGB handler,
AEMUSICAL was instructed by SLAZCV to prepare and submit to
SLABOY at ths next meeting a “very complete Iie history’ of himself.
(cf para. 9 OSSA-8B14, dtd 24 July 1959) According to the eame
reference, the CIA Case Cifieer, Timothy F. Noggle met with
AEMUSICAL oa IT July, at which tims he obtained ths above info, and
in para 17 tho CIA handler states:

“3%. We gave T/1 the green light on bis life history telling
hira to furnish a complete.and truthful report.to. TIDRAMA/3.
The portent of 1/3's ‘high-level’ schome lor T/1 ie hard to deduce
and harder yet to accopt at face value. For the time being it
soeins dest to maintain our wait-and-see policy, particularly
Because the. Sovict trip should produce:s firm.decision on the
Soviat side as to whether or not T/1 is worth all thie bother...."

Siace the next AEMUSICAL (then still TLORAMA/1) contact with the
KGB was ochedoled:for'3 August 1959, to be followed by a meeting with
Noggle on 6 August, it must be presumed that at least at thie time
AEMUSICAL's close friendship and continuing contact with Michael C.
SUMAN was brought to the attention of the KGB. However, it Le note-
worthy that throughout the operation, there is very little detailed
Foporting from the field on the exact details of what AXMUSICAL told
the KGB handior at each meeting regarding each of his personal con-
tacts. Subject's caso is a perfect example. Actually there is no
@otailed record of exactly when or what AEMUSICAL told the KGB
about his (riendship with Subject, cthor than the items contained in

this chronology. Neither does there appear to be any reporting of the
probed inte thie relationship, the
Feaction shown by tho KGB handler whon ALMUSICAL first indicated he



Anges atetossume a £

was a friend of SUMAN's, etc, Since AEMUSICAL (then TIDRAMA)
actually was in contact with the KG Resident in stockholm, Ivan

BORISOV in 1957 prior to his contact with KU BARK through the local
ODACID installation, there always remains the possibility that SUMAN

may in soms-yet unexplained manner have played seme role in BORISOV’s
contact with AENUSICAL ef which source either is wiiting but to which

he dees not admit, or of which the agent is entirely wawitting.

3. C9C1-3/756, 896 addrevsed te the FBI under date of 9.Ccteber
19599 page 5, pora 5, indicates thet TIDRAMA did in fact provide
SLABCY with tho requested detailed personal biographic history ctate=
most, such information presumably having been passed, as planned,
on 3 August 1959, If SUMAN‘'® name bad not previously come up in the
oval questioning of AEMUSICAL referred to in para Lt, above, it surely
Taust have come out on this occasion.

4. Inzomueh as SLABGV requested AEMUSICAL to provide him
with an addreso at which he could be reached while in the U.S. in the
fall of 1959, although the record indicates merely that he thereupon
Gapplied SLABOV with bis mother's addrese in Califoraia, in view of
the {information reported to hie headquarters bandiers in Cetober 1939
prior to leaving Washington, it must be prosumed that ARNUSCAL
aloo provided SUMAN‘s name and address to the KGS, 35 one of the
persone he planned to contact and vicit with while in the U.S.

5. WE/L and the FBI were aware, .ir.advance, of TIDRAMA's
. plans to cantaet SUMAN while on the West:Coaet during the pertod~~
27 Cetober through $ November 1959, according to the original plans,
28 tedicated in attached memorandum dated 29 October 1959, addressed
by WE/1 to Mr. Milor of Cl/Opa/Soveat. (Encl, D) The original ofthis
dscument was found interfiled in tha TIDRAMA Operational Files held
by SR/CL/RED.

6.- Following TIDRAMA's return from above referenced Woot
Coast trip in October-November 1959, during which time he was
attempting to obtain certain clacsified information from hie California
contacts in order to comply with the KGB roquiremenis gives him by
SLABCV before he left Stockholm, TIDRAMA was again debriefed and
briefed by the headquarters case officers of WE/1, with report of hie
U.S. trip forwarded to the field as OSSW-6379, under date of 13 November
1959. Apparently this pouch was not-coordinated with Mr. Miler, and
it is apparent that no copies of the complete pouch were provided to him
following dispatch to the field, in light of various memoranda referring
to OSSW 6379, all of which are addreseed to Cl/Upse Sovest and begin
with a memo dated 9 August 1960 concerning SUMAN. Copies of these

trary to the impression conveyed in Amidon's memorandum-of 9'Auguat” °
1960, a clossz reading-of COSSW-6379 reveals that hic visit with SUMAN
occupied the entire period of bis stay in Celifornia, t.@. from 27 Ceteber

would have"been able to get off with ac superficial « report to his KGB
handler as ho appoaro to have done with reapect to the WE/1 case
officers reeponsible for his handling at the time,

7, As Enclosure G, please find a copy of the report TIDRAMA
propared on his contacts in Callfornta, which was prepared by the Deek
and paoecd te Mr. Ludium for clearance by appropriate U.S, Agencies
for pasoogo. This memorandum was made available to this office by
Mer. Ludlum during the week of 30 Cctoder 1961, Tho memorandum

tion was.ahown te the PBI on that date, and eubsequestly returned on
3 December 1959, Please note SUMAN's name to included.

6. According to Mr, Granquist's memo to Mrs. Potockh, (cf.
Encl, B) there allogedty ts no further miention of SUMAN ta the
TIDBAMA/AEMUSICAL file othor than that forwarded by Granquict
with hie note, and the report forwarded to us with referenced memo-

from this Agency, NSA made availablein early August: 1960 photocopies
d tho PHS forme completed by MARTIN and MITCHELL for omployment
with NSA, euch forme being dated 1] July 1957, three days after they
feported for duty at Fort Meade. Zxamination of MARTIN‘ employ-
mont application reveled that he had listed Michael C, SUMAN of
Slorra Madre, Califora, oa a personal reference in one case, and as
& credit referonce in another place, indicating that he had known him
for a period of four years, i.e. since 1953, However, inasmuch as
thore wae no indication that SUMAN had been connectod in any way
with MARTIN's military service is Japan, it was assumed that SUMAN
