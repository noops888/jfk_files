ELLIOT MAXWELL, BILL BADER.

APRIL 10, 1975

VISIT TO THE CIA AGENCY, LANGLEY

APRIL 10, 1975

Bill Bader and Elliot Maxwell were at the Central

SENSITIVE

Intelligence Agency from roughly 11:00 a.m. until 2:00 p.m.

on

April 10, 1975. While there we met with John Clarke,

Harriet Mowitt, Lyle Miller of the Officé of the General

Counsel, and Lewis Elder, historian for the CIA.

We reviewed with Lewis Elder a list of historical

studies now in his custody. Attached is a list of the

historical studies

and other materials which

we requested

pursuant to our agreement with John Clarke that requests

made while at the Agency would be treated as formal requests

of the Committee.

It did not seem profitable to ask that the

Agency provide

all of the historical studies which were listed. We chose

works because they dealt with either an overview of the

Agency, or a particular Directorate, or they provided inform-

ation about policies and practices with which the Committee

may be concerned. Some reliance was placed on Mr. Elder's

suggestions as to the quality of the work and the value of the

information which it provided. Elder cautioned us to be

somewhat sceptical about a number of the studies, as the

chors ranged from professional historians to station chiefs

che quality varied from very good to awful. We reserved

se right to ask for other studies later. These include the

following:

1.

A 17-volume history of the Office of Special Activities,

(the U-t project) .

2. A study of personnel records and reports.

3. A study of security programs of the CIA: the Domestic

Field Office.

4. A study of Western European operations directed against

Cuba.

5. A history of Cuban refugee exploitation.

It is not clear how soon we will receive the material, or

if we will receive it at all. Elder suggested that there were

ubstantial third-agency questions involved; for instance, the

study of the U-2 would require approval from numerous govern-.

ment agencies as well as seventeen foreign governments.

Elliot also met with Lyle Miller of the General Counsel's

staff about the material provided in response to the Committee's

request for comments on proposed legislation. The material

provided included comments on legislation proposed in 1974,

plus a comment on PL 90-331, which allows the Director of the

Secret Service to request support from other agencies of the

Government. Elliot indicated to MI. Miller that the lack of

material on other legislation in other years was unacceptable.

FILES

The following files are requested. In order to expedite

their location, the Committee has indicated offices which

appear to be the best starting point for a search.

This does

not limit, nor supersede the general guideline that all files

throughout the CIA relating to a project be procured. If pro-

jects herein identified are not CIA projects, but are identi-

fiable as projects of other agencies with which CIA had some

connection, the request is for all CIA files regarding such

projects.

In the first instance, all of the specified material will

be reviewed in unsanitized form by staff at CIA headquarters.

The Committee will continue to select particular documents to

be transmitted to the Committee's offices in Washington to be

used in preparing for hearings and the Committee's report.
