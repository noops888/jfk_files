' declares that— i
E me 1) all Government records related to’ the assassination

disclosed to enable the public to become fully informed about
the history surrounding the assassination;

(3) legislation is necessary to create an enforceable,
independent, and accountable process for the public disclosure
of such records; 7

(4) legislation is necessary because cont ional records
related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy
would not otherwise be subject to public disclosure until at
least the year 2029; = - --

(5) legislation is necessary because the Freedom of Informa-
tion Act, as implemented by the executive branch, has pre-
vented the timely public disclosure of records relating to the

classified information across government and has prevented
the timely public disclosure of records relating to the assassina-
tion of President John F. Kennedy; and

President John F. Kennedy are almost 30 years old, and only

gravity that it outweighs the public intérest, and such public

isclosure would reveal—

requires protection; v

utilized, or reasonably expected to be utilized, by the United

States Government and which has not been officially dis-

closed, the disclosure of which would interfere with the

conduct of intelligence activities; or

(C) any other matter currently relating to the military
defense, intelligence operations or conduct of foreign rela-
tions of the United States, the disclosure of which would
demonstrably impair the national security of the United

States;

(2) the public disclosure of the assassination record would
reveal the name or identity of a living person who provided
confidential information to the United States and would pose
a substantial risk of harm to that person;

(3) the public disclosure of the assassination record could
reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion
of personal privacy, and that invasion of privacy is so substan-
tial that it outweighs the public interest;

(4) the public disclosure of the assassination record would
compromise the existence of an understanding of confidentiality
currently requiring protection between a Government agent
and a cooperating individual or a foreign government, and
public disclosure would be so harmful that it outweighs the
public interest; or

reveal a security or protective procedure currently utilized,
or reasonably expected to be utilized, by the Secret Service
or another Government agency responsible for protecting Gov-
ernment officials, and public disclosure would be so harmful
that it outweighs the public interest.

PRESIDENT JOHN F, KENNEDY ASSASSINATION
RECORDS DISCLOSURE: AN OVERVIEW

SUMMARY

The assassination of President John F. Kennedy in Dallas, Texas, on
November 22, 1963, resulted in various investigations of the incident and
surrounding circumstances by Federal, State, and local authorities as well as
some special inquiry bodies, such as the Presidentially-appointed commission
chaired by Chief Justice Earl Warren. Later, other official entities, such as the
House Select Committee on Assassinations, probed the assassination anew.
From all of these investigations and examinations there resulted a cache of data,
records, files, and, in some instances, electronic and multi-media material.
Access to these holdings was sought by various elements of the public for a
multiplicity of reasons. Over time, some unpublished documents were disclosed.
Other holdings, however, for reasons of security classification, law enforcement
investigation, and personal privacy, remained officially sequestered. In 1991, a
filmed dramatization of President Kennedy’s assassination heightened public
interest in the tragedy and explanations of its occurrence. Various conspiracy
theories, contentions, and unsubstantiated stories about the event have arisen
during the past 30 years. Because these were troubling to many Americans,
Congress legislated procedures and conditions for the independent review and
expeditious disclosure of heretofore unreleased official records relevant to the
assassination of President Kennedy. This was accomplished with the President
John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 which established
a review board to examine all relevant materials with a view to their public
disclosure and maintenance at the National Archives and Records
Administration for public examination.


PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION
RECORDS DISCLOSURE: AN OVERVIEW

The tragic loss of President John F. Kennedy in a Dallas, Texas,
assassination on November 22, 1963, resulted in various investigations of the
incident and surrounding circumstances by Federal, State, and local authorities.
Some special inquiry bodies, such as the Presidentially-appointed commission
chaired by Chief Justice Earl Warren also conducted inquiries. In subsequent
years, as some law enforcement agencies continued their investigations of the ~
case, other official entities probed the assassination anew. For some, such as the
House Select Committee on Assassinations, initially mandated in 1976, the
assassination was a major aspect of the panel’s fact-finding mission. For others,
such as the Commission to Investigate CIA Activities Within the United States,
created in 1975, the assassination was tangentially related to or only a part of
their focus. From all of these investigations and examinations there resulted a
cache of data, records, files, and a small quantity of electronic and multi-media
material. Access to these holdings was sought by various elements of the public
for a multiplicity of reasons. Over time, some unpublished documents were
disclosed. Almost all of the Warren Commission records, for example, have been
released. Other holdings, however, for reasons of security classification, law
enforcement investigation, and personal privacy, remained officially sequestered.

A 1991 filmed dramatization of President Kennedy’s assassination and
surrounding circumstances heightened public interest in the tragedy and
explanations of its occurrence. Subsequently, former President Gerald Ford, the
only surviving member of the Warren Commission, publicly asked leaders of the
House of Representatives to seek release of all records concerning the
assassination.! Furthermore, various conspiracy theories, contentions, and
unsubstantiated stories about the event and those involved in its perpetration,
which had arisen during the past 30 years, were troubling to many Americans.”
In response, Congress legislated procedures and conditions for the independent
review and expeditious disclosure of heretofore unreleased official records
relevant to the assassination of President Kennedy. The vehicle for these
arrangements was the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records
Collection Act of 1992.°

A PRESIDENTIAL ASSASSINATION

The thirty-fifth President of the United States, John Fitzgerald Kennedy,
was shot at approximately 12:30 p.m. on November 22, 1963, while riding in a
motorcade through Dealey Plaza in downtown Dallas, Texas. President
Kennedy was fatally wounded; Texas Governor John Connally, riding in the
same open automobile with the President, Mrs. Kennedy, and his own wife, was
injured. Doctors at Parkland Memorial Hospital, to which the wounded
President was rushed, quickly discovered he had suffered a massive wound in
the rear portion of his head. Shortly thereafter, at 1:00 p.m. (C.S.T), after all
heart activity had ceased and the Last Rites of the Roman Catholic Church were
administered by a priest, John F. Kennedy was pronounced dead and his demise
was reported by the news media. Most Americans near or at adult age on that
historic and tragic day would forever remember their personal circumstances at
the time of learning about the President’s assassination.

Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson and his wife were accompanying
President and Mrs. Kennedy on their Dallas visit. At Parkland, the Vice
President was informed of the President’s death. Thereafter, he left the hospital
under close guard, and proceeded to the Presidential aircraft, Air Force One,
located at Love Field. On the plane, Lyndon Johnson took the Presidential oath
at 2:38 p.m. (C.S.T.). The aircraft soon departed for Washington, D. C., with
Mrs. Kennedy and the body of the late President aboard.

Air Force One arrived at Andrews Air Force Base outside of Washington at
5:58 p.m. (E.S.T.) and President Kennedy’s body was transported to the
National Naval Medical Center in nearby Bethesda, Maryland, where an autopsy
was performed. The following day, the President’s body lay in state in the East
Room of the White House. The casket was moved the next day, a Sunday, to
the Capitol where an estimated 300,000 people passed through the Rotunda in
tribute to the fallen Chief Executive. On Monday, in a procession with full
honors, the President’s body was moved to Saint Matthew’s Roman Catholic
Cathedral for a Pontifical Requiem Mass, and then to Arlington National
Cemetery for burial.

Meanwhile, on the day of the President’s assassination, Dallas Police
arrested a suspect in the killing, Lee Harvey Oswald, who was also a suspect in
the shooting of a patrolman. When questioned by Dallas officers,as well as
agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the United States Secret
Service, Oswald denied having anything to do with the murder of President
Kennedy or the Dallas policeman. He was subsequently advised formally at 7:10
p.m. on November 22 that he was charged with the slaying of the patrolman.
Several hours later, shortly after 1:30 a.m. on the following day, Oswald was
also charged with assassinating President Kennedy. The next day, Sunday, as
Oswald was being transferred from the city jail to an armored truck which was
to transport him to the Dallas County Jail, he was suddenly shot by an assailant.
at approximately 11:20 a.m., in the glaring light of television news cameras. He
quickly lost consciousness, was rushed to Parkland Memorial Hospital, and was
pronounced dead at 1:07 p.m.


CRS-3

Oswald’s assassin was Jack Ruby, a local nightclub operator. Arrested at
the scene and jailed by Dallas police, Ruby told interrogators that he had killed
Oswald in a temporary fit of depression and rage over President Kennedy’s
death. He denied having any prior connection with Oswald or any involvement
in the President’s killing. Indicted by the State of Texas for Oswald’s murder
on November 26, 1963, Ruby was found guilty on March 14, 1964, and was
sentenced to death. On appeal, the verdict was reversed and a new trial was
ordered by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals on October 5, 1966. However,
while awaiting retrial, Jack Ruby died of cancer at Parkland Memorial Hospital
on January 3, 1967.

OFFICIAL INVESTIGATIONS

The assassination of President Kennedy was investigated or examined
immediately by Texas police authorities as well as the Federal Bureau of
Investigation and the United States Secret Service, and, subsequently, other
Federal entities. A special study commission, chaired by Chief Justice Earl
Warren, was impaneled by President Johnson with a directive, E.O. 11130 of
November 30, 1963.4 At least one other such body—the Commission to
Investigate CIA Activities Within the United States, chaired by Vice President
Nelson Rockefeller and established with E.O. 11828 of January 4, 1975°—also
explored aspects of the Kennedy assassination. Between 1975 and 1978, two
special congressional committees—the Senate Select Committee to Study
Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities, which was
chaired by Senator Frank Church, and the House Select Committee on
Assassinations, which was principally chaired by Representative Louis
Stokes—also reviewed the Kennedy assassination.

The various investigations, examinations, and reviews of the assassination
of President Kennedy resulted in the production and collection of a vast
quantity of records and evidentiary materials by Federal entities. The Warren
Commission, for example, generated its own original records and received
pertinent materials from Federal agencies, such as the F.B.I. The Commission’s
research, records, and evidence were later reviewed by the House Select
Committee on Assassinations, which itself generated original records and
received additional material from other official and unofficial sources.
Consequently, due to the manner and timeframes in which Federal inquiries
into and reviews of President Kennedy’s assassination were conducted, most
collections of records on the matter held by Federal entities contained
documentary materials that were produced by sources other than themselves.
In brief, there were Federal records that were shared on both an inter- and
intra-branch basis.

According to material supplementing congressional testimony by the
Archivist of the United States,° and other sources,” the following collections of
Federal records pertaining to the assassination of President Kennedy existed at
the time a subcommittee of the House Committee on the Judiciary was
considering proposed legislation providing for the expeditious disclosure of
records relevant to the Kennedy assassination.

Federal Bureau of Investigation. The F.B.I. holdings include 499,431 pages
of pertinent documents, 223,689 pages of which have been made available to the
public. During congressional testimony in May of 1992, the Bureau’s Deputy
Director indicated that a special task force had been created a few weeks earlier
to expedite greater disclosure of records relating to the assassination.’ He also
provided the following breakdown of F.B.I. records "relating in some way to the
assassination."

1. The FBI has four "core files" that relate directly to the investigation
of the assassination, our cooperation with the Warren Commission,
and the investigations of Lee Harvey Oswald and Jack Ruby. There
are approximately 499,000 pages in these files. Because of the very
liberal standards used for processing these documents, most of the
information in these files was released pursuant to the Freedom of
Information Act in 1978 and is available in the FBI’s public reading
room....

2. In addition, the FBI has several other much smaller files as a result
of other related investigations such as the investigation of Marina
Oswald [the wife of Lee Harvey Oswald]. These files comprise
approximately 22,000 pages. ... (M)uch of this information has
already been released to the public.®

United States Secret Service. The Secret Service collection consists of
approximately 11,000 pages of records, as well as several audio-visual items,
almost all of which are duplicated in the publicly available holdings of the
Warren Commission. Scattered records have been exempted from disclosure
under the Freedom of Information Act in the past for reasons of security
classification, personal privacy, and law enforcement investigation.’

Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Intelligence Community. The
C.LA. compiled a file on Lee Harvey Oswald before the assassination of
President Kennedy. That material was made public in mid-May of 1992."' The
C.LA. has approximately 250,000 to 300,000 pages of additional pertinent
material, about 11,000 pages of which have been made public through F.O.L. Act
requests. In his May 1992, testimony before the Senate Committee on
Governmental Affairs concerning proposed legislation providing for the
expeditious disclosure of records pertaining to the assassination of President
Kennedy, the Director of Central Intelligence summarized relevant actions he
had recently taken, saying:

Two months ago, I announced the establishment of a new unit within
CIA that will be responsible for declassifying as many historical
documents as possible consistent with the protection of intelligence
sources and methods.'?

This new unit, the Historical Review Group, in the Agency’s
Center for the Study of Intelligence, will review for declassification
documents 30 years old or older and national intelligence estimates on
the former Soviet Union that are 10 years old or older.'®

In addition to the systematic review of 30-year-old documents, I
have directed the history staff in the Center for the Study of
Intelligence to assemble CIA records focusing on particular events of
historical importance, including the assassination of President
Kennedy. The Historical Review Group will then examine the
documents for the purpose of declassifying the records.

Because of high interest in the JFK papers, I am not waiting for
legislation or other agencies to start declassifying documents belonging
to CIA. The Historical Review Group, at my direction, already has
begun its review of the documents related to the assassination of
President Kennedy, and I am happy to report that the first group of
these records, including all CLA documents on Lee Harvey Oswald
prior to the assassination, has been declassified with quite minimal

deletions and is being transferred to the National Archives for release
to the public.

Describing the Agency’s assassination records holdings in a prepared
statement, the Deputy Director of Central Intelligence told a House
subcommittee:

This includes 64 boxes of copies and originals of information provided
to the Warren Commission and the House Select Committee on
Assassinations and 17 boxes of material on Lee Harvey Oswald
accumulated after President Kennedy’s assassination. Unfortunately,
what we are dealing with is a mass of material that is not indexed, is
uncatalogued, and is highly disorganized—all of which makes the
review process more difficult. The material contains everything from
the most sensitive intelligence sources.to the most mundane news
clippings.'®

Concerning other agencies of the Federal Intelligence Community, the
Deputy Director’s statement: said:

The FBI will describe its holdings separately, which I assume include
both intelligence and law enforcement records. The National Security
Agency and the State Department’s Bureau of Intelligence and
Research report, after a preliminary search, that they have identified
a relatively small amount of material responsive to previous inquiries
by the Warren Commission, the Church Committee, and the House
Select Committee on Assassinations. The Defense Intelligence Agency,
which did not come into existence until 1961, has identified no
assassination material to date, and it anticipates that any holdings it
might have would be minimal because its mission at the time of the
Kennedy assassination focused upon foreign order of battle.'®

Department of State. According to supplemental material accompanying the
Archivist’s May, 1992, testimony before a subcommittee of the House Committee
on the Judiciary, some 7,000 pages of pertinent records in two case files had
been recently transferred to the National Archives and Records Administration
by the Department of State. Although this collection had not been
systematically reviewed at the time of his testimony, the account indicated that
the transferred documents appeared to be duplicates of those in the publicly
available holdings of the Warren Commission."

Department of Justice. Apart from the records of the F.B.I. noted earlier,
case files of the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice reportedly
contain approximately 65,000 pages of material. According to the supplemental
account accompanying the Archivist’s prepared statement for a subcommittee
of the House Committee on the Judiciary, "Most of these records are letters from
the general public, constituent mail forwarded by members of Congress, and
responses from the Department and the FBI." Some 11,000 pages of this
material have been previously exempted from disclosure for reasons of personal
privacy and law enforcement investigation when sought pursuant to the F.O.1.
Act.

President’s Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy. The
Warren Commission presented its report and 26 volumes of appendices to
President Johnson on September 24, 1964. These documents were published by
the Government Printing Office and made available for public purchase. The
Commission ceased operations and its records—363 cubic feet of material,
including audio-visual items—were transferred to the National Archives.
Approximately 98 percent of this collection subsequently has become open to the
public. Records exempted from disclosure under the F.O.L. Act were protected
for reasons of security classification, specific statutory restrictions, personal
privacy, and law enforcement investigation.

Commission to Investigate CIA Activities Within the United States.
Mandated to determine whether any C.1A. domestic activities exceeded the
Agency’s statutory authority, the Rockefeller Commission was tasked, within its
general mission, to investigate allegations concerning the presence of C.I.A.
employees or agents in Dallas at the time of President Kennedy’s assassination
or of their involvement in the murder. The panel’s June 16, 1975, report, while
indicating that a staff inquiry had been made concerning the allegations, noted
that "a full review" of the report of the Warren Commission had not been
undertaken. "Such a task,” in the panel’s view, "would have been outside of the
scope of the Executive Order establishing this Commission, and would have
diverted the time of the Commission from its proper function." Consequently,
the panel limited itself "to determining whether there was any credible evidence
pointing to CIA involvement in the assassination of President Kennedy. It
coneluded that "there was no credible evidence of any CIA involvement."?!

Upon presenting its report to the President, the Rockefeller Commission
ceased operations. Its records, most of which were highly classified, were

retained by President Ford and, in accordance with prevailing practice at the
time, were taken away by him as part of his Presidential papers when he left the

White House.” They were subsequently returned to the custody of the Federal
Government in accordance with a December 13, 1976, deed of gift in which
President Ford donated his congressional, Vice Presidential, and Presidential
papers to a Presidential library created in his name on the campus of the
University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and operated by the National Archives.”
The deposited Rockefeller Commission collection consisted of 23 linear feet of
materials, 2,500 pages of which related to the panel’s investigation into matters
surrounding the Kennedy assassination. Public access to these highly classified
records has been limited by the Ford deed of gift.*

Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to
Intelligence Activities (The Church Committee), Established by S. Res. 21 on
January 27, 1975, the Church Committee was tasked with conducting an
investigation of the extent, if any, of improper or unethical activities engaged
in by Federal intelligence agencies. In carrying out its mandate, the Committee
assessed the performance of the intelligence community in examining
circumstances surrounding the assassination of President Kennedy. The
Committee subsequently "developed evidence which impeaches the process by
which the intelligence agencies arrived at their own conclusions about the
assassination” and found that the intelligence agencies were "deficient" in their
support of the Warren Commission.” When the Church Committee went out
of existence on May 31, 1976, its records came under the custody and into the
possession of the successor Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.
Approximately 5,000 papers in the Church Committee collection pertain to the
Kennedy assassination, but have not previously been made available for public
examination by the Senate.

House Select Committee on Assassinations, Initially chartered by H. Res.
1540 on September 17, 1976, the Assassinations Committee was mandated to
conduct a broad investigation of the circumstances surrounding the death of
President Kennedy in 1963-and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., in 1968. In the
former case, much of the Committee’s efforts centered on reviewing the findings
of the Warren Commission and evaluating the evidence presented to it by official
entities. A number of findings and recommendations were subsequently offered

by the Select Committee.” When the Committee went out of existence at the
end of the 95th Congress, custody of its records passed to the Clerk of the
House. Approximately 414,000 pages of the Committee’s 747,000-page collection
were created or collected by the panel’s Kennedy task force. The operative
House standard at the time of the expiration of the Assassinations Committee
sealed all unpublished committee records for 50 years. A 1983 effort by five
former members of the Assassinations Committee to accelerate the release of the
panel’s files was unsuccessful due to the failure of their reform resolution (H.
Res. 160) to be reported from committee.

RECORDS ACCESS BARRIERS

Efforts by the public to gain access to records deriving from Federal
investigations and examinations of the assassination of President Kennedy and
surrounding events have been frustrated by several complications. Operative
since July of 1967, the Freedom of Information Act provides any
person—individual or corporate, regardless of citizenship—with access to
identifiable, unpublished, existing records of the Federal departments and
agencies without having to demonstrate a need or even a reason for such a
request.” The burden of proof for withholding material sought by the public
is placed upon the Government. However, the statute specifies nine categories
of information which may be withheld from disclosure.” Among these stated
exemptions to the rule of disclosure are protections for: (1) information properly
classified for national defense or foreign policy purposes as secret under criteria
established by an executive order; (2) data specifically excepted from disclosure
by a statute which either requires that matters be withheld in a non-
discretionary manner or which establishes particular criteria for withholding or
refers to particular types of matters to be withheld; (3) personnel, medical, and
similar files the disclosure of which would constitute an unwarranted invasion
of personal privacy; and (4) certain kinds of investigatory records compiled for
law enforcement purposes.” These four exemptions tended to be the ones
most often invoked by the agencies in support of their withholding of
assassination materials sought pursuant to the F.O.I. Act. Disputes over the
accessibility of records may be ultimately settled in Federal court.

Among those testifying before the Senate Committee on Governmental
Affairs during that panel’s consideration of legislation providing for the
expeditious disclosure of records relevant to the assassination of President
Kennedy was James H. Lesar, an F.O.1LA. attorney and president of the
Assassination Archives and Research Center located in Washington, D. C.
Describing the Center as "a private, non-profit organization which collects,
preserves, and disseminates information and materials on _ political
assassinations, ... which is funded by membership dues and donations from the
public,” Mr. Lesar identified the security classification of assassination records
as a major obstacle to their release under the F.O.I. Act. He also gave some
illustrations from his practice showing "the inadequacies of the FOIA and the
enormous frustration which accrues to those who attempt to use it to obtain
information about the Kennedy assassination. These examples," he told the
Committee, "reveal a pattern of delay, costly litigation, and untrue
representations by the Government." In conclusion, he said:

These stories that I have related are unusual only because the
requesters actually went to court to fight the CIA and FBI. Most
requesters cannot afford the time or money to litigate their FOIA
requests against these agencies. You might be tempted to conclude
from the general absence of litigation that the FOIA is working just
fine. The opposite is true. The FOIA has been severely
the 1984 amendments eliminating access to CIA operational files*!
and by the 1986 amendments to Exemption 7 which applies ‘to law
enforcement records,*? as well as by a string of decisions in the
Supreme Court and the U. S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia which have greatly expanded the amount of material which
can be withheld from the public.

Public access to unpublished congressional records was also very limited.
The House Select Committee on Assassinations went out of existence at the
expiration of the 95th Congress. During its two-year investigation, the Select
Committee amassed approximately 414,000 pages of records pertaining to the

Kennedy assassination.“ Transcripts of its open hearings and a final report
were published by the Government Printing Office. However, its other records
remained unavailable to the public. These materials were transferred to the
National Archives and were sealed from public access for 50 years, until the year
2029, in accordance with the operative standards of the House of
Representatives at that time.

Despite this time restriction on public access to the Select Committee’s
unpublished records, interested persons could request to see them by writing to
the Clerk of the House. Although there was—unlike the provisions of the F.O.I.
Act—no temporal requirement concerning a response deadline, it was at least
the Clerk’s policy to reply in a timely manner, whether the response was
positive or negative. However, because security classified material and agency
records were a large part of this reserved collection, access was accordingly
limited. Furthermore, there was a logistical question of permitting access at the
legislative reference branch of the National Archives or retrieving the records
for examination on Capitol Hill, with appropriate supervision in either case. In
brief, it was not a satisfying experience for many requestors.

> In 1983, a former member of the Select Committee, Representative Stewart
McKinney, citing the public’s right to know about the circumstances
surrounding the death of President Kennedy, introduced a resolution, H. Res.
160, providing for the accelerated release of the panel’s files.*° Four other
members of the Select Committee—Representatives Robert Edgar, Harold S.
Sawyer, Walter Fauntroy, and Harold Ford—co-sponsored the resolution.

In the Senate, the Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations

was established on January 27, 1975—examined various aspects of intelligence
community operations, including its performance in assisting in investigations
of the assassination of President Kennedy. Specifically, the Church Committee

studied the extent to which the intelligence agencies assisted the Warren
Commission by providing information necessary to conduct its investigation.

The Church Committee found that the intelligence community did not
provide sufficient data to the Warren Commission about U.S. operations against
Cuba. Furthermore, it recommended that its successor, the Senate Select
Committee on Intelligence, investigate the possibility that senior officials of the
C.LA. and F.B.I. might have made a conscious decision not to disclose potentially
important information in this area to the Warren Commission. Before the
Church Committee went out of existence on May 31, 1976, it forwarded all of
its files pertaining to this aspect of its investigation—approximately 5,000 pages
of records—to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.®”

When the Church Committee concluded its investigation and published its
hearing transcripts and final report, there was no Senate rule governing the
disposition of committee records. In practice, each committee had its own
agreement with the National Archives concerning noncurrent materials. On
June 24, 1980, the Senate adopted a resolution, S. Res. 474, which provided that
any records of the Senate, or of any Senate committee, shall not be available to
the public for 20 years and, in the case of investigative files, for 50 years.

Athird area of access difficulties concerns donated papers—records provided
to the Federal Government under a deed of gift setting temporal or other access
conditions which restrict their availability to the general public. In testimony
before a subcommittee of the House Committee on the Judiciary, the Archivist
of the United States offered the following pertinent remarks:

Tn accordance with 44 U.S.C. 2107 and 2111, the National Archives
has accepted under deed of gift a wide variety of historical, donated
historical materials. The Kennedy autopsy photographs and x-rays are
in this category. So are the files of the Rockefeller Commission held
by the Gerald R. Ford Library.’ This donation was in keeping with
legal practices prior to 1978 when the Presidential commissions were
regarded as personal to the President because they provided advice
directly to him.

The deed of gift for this highly classified Rockefeller Commission
file specifies that access will be granted for any legitimate
governmental function. Access has been granted for at least three
previous governmental investigations. . . .

In addition, there are collections of personal papers in some of the
Presidential libraries received under the authority of 44 U.S.C. 2107
and 2111, and they may contain documentary materials falling within
the broad definition of assassination materials.*

The Library of Congress also had relevant donated papers in its manuscript
collections, some of which were accessible to the public only with the permission
of the donor.®®

While the difficulties of gaining donor permission to examine private
records deposited in public institutions were well understood, the Archivist
offered a caution concerning access legislation which might override donor
agreements involving assassination materials. The National Archives, he said,
"is concerned that unless existing donation agreements are honored and donors
are consulted before access and publication, the Congress may inadvertently
discourage future donations of similar historical material and thereby damage
compilation of the complete and accurate historical record."

CREATING A NEW PROCEDURE

Legislation providing for the expeditious disclosure of records relevant to
the: assassination of President Kennedy was introduced in the House as H. J.
Res; 454 on March 26, 1992, by Representative Louis Stokes, former chairman
of the House Select Committee on Assassinations, with 40 initial co-sponsors.‘!
In testimony before a subcommittee of the House Committee on the Judiciary
considering the proposal, Representative Stokes explained his reasons for
offering the legislation.

This resolution was introduced because of the renewed public
interest and concern over the records pertaining to the assassination
of President John F. Kennedy.

The House committee which I chaired, in the course of its
investigation, had at one time or the other in its possession
approximately 370 cubic feet of files. Among the materials contained
in these files were classified and unclassified materials on loan from
Federal agencies, materials generated by committee staff, materials on
loan from private individuals, transcripts of committee open session
hearings and meetings, and from executive sessions hearings and
meetings.

There has been considerable debate about these records, including
accusations that these records, if released, would contain evidence of
@ government coverup or complicity of government agencies in the
assassination of President Kennedy.

I can assure you, Mr. Chairman, members of this committee, that
nothing could be further from the truth. No member of our committee
nor member of our staff participated in any coverup of the truth.

Mr. Chairman, I am committed to the principle that Americans
are entitled to know the truth about the assassination of President
Kennedy and feel that Congress should do its best to allay fears of the
American people in this regard. The American public deserves to
know the factual truth about this important event in this Nation’s
history.”

An identical companion measure was introduced in the Senate as S. J. Res.
282 on March 26, 1992, by Senator David Boren, chairman of the Select
Committee on Intelligence, with nine initial co-sponsors.“ Among these was
Senator Arlen Specter, who had been a staff member of the Warren Commission.
In sponsoring the legislation, Senator Boren said, in both his floor statement
introducing the measure and later committee hearings on it, he felt, as a general
principle, that "the intelligence community should make available its records
after the passage of a reasonable amount of time when current sources and
methods would no longer be compromised."

As introduced, the Assassination Materials Disclosure Act provided for the
creation of a temporary Assassination Materials Review Board. It was to be
composed of five "distinguished and impartial private citizens," who were to be
selected by the division of the United States Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia established under 28 U.S.C. 49. This section originally mandated
the selection of so-called Independent Counsels or Special Prosecutors, such as
the ones who lately have pursued illegalities stemming from the Watergate
incident and the Iran-Contra affair. According to the Stokes-Boren proposal,
members of the Review Board were to be deemed to be inferior officers of the
United States within the meaning of section 2 of Article II of the
Constitution.’ Furthermore, the Review Board was authorized to, "without
regard to the civil service laws and regulations, appoint and terminate an
Executive Director and such other additional personnel as are necessary to
enable the Review Board to perform its duties.”

CRS-15

The Assassination Materials Disclosure Act prescribed that all relevant
records and materials pertinent to the assassination of President Kennedy would
be initially reviewed by the Executive Director of the Review Board. This
official would determine if items (1) could be publicly released; (2) should be
referred to the Board, for reasons of privacy or other complex conditions, for a
determination as to their public availability; or (3) should be postponed for
release, subject to Review Board approval. In the first instance, decisions by the
Executive Director to release materials could be appealed by agencies to the
Review Board for reconsideration. Ultimately, the Review Board would decide
(1) the disclosure of materials, subject to a Presidential override, with notice to
the public and Congress; and (2) postponement of release to a specific date, with
notice to the public and Congress.

. In the House, H. J. Res. 454 was referred jointly to the Committees on
House Administration, Government Operations, Rules, and the Judiciary. ‘Two
panels, the Committees on Government Operations and the Judiciary, held
public hearings, conducted mark-ups, and issued reports on differing versions
of the original proposal. In the Senate, S. J. Res. 282 was referred only to
the.Committee on Governmental Affairs, which held a hearing on the measure,
revised and expanded it, and reported this new version (S. 3006).“7 Various
objections to the original text of the joint resolution were heard by the
committees, including those of the Department of Justice, which indicated the
proposal, as introduced, "would not be consistent with the objectives of the
Administration."® Among the criticisms of the proposal that were offered by
witnesses were the following:

“avoids the chief constitutional problems raised by earlier versions of the bill,”
the President noted that "it still raises, several constitutional questions." These

were enumerated as follows:

First, S. 3006 sets forth the grounds on which the release of
documents may be postponed, but this list does not contemplate
nondisclosure of executive branch deliberations or law enforcement
information of the executive branch ..., and it provides only a narrow
basis for nondisclosure of national security information. My authority
to protect these categories of information comes from the Constitution
and cannot be limited by statute. Although only the most
extraordinary circumstances would require postponement of the
disclosure of documents for reasons other than those recognized in the
bill, I cannot abdicate my constitutional responsibility to take such
- action when necessary. The same applies to the provision purporting
to give certain congressional committees "access to any records held or
created by the Review Board.” This provision will be interpreted

. consistently with my authority under the Constitution to protect

+ confidential executive branch materials and to supervise and guide
executive branch officials.

Second, S. 3006 requires the Board to report to the President and
the Congress. If the bill were interpreted to require simultaneous
reports, S. 3006 would intrude upon the President’s authority to
supervise subordinate officials in the executive branch. I will construe
the provisions to require that the Board report to the President before
it reports to the Congress.

Third, the bill purports to set the qualifications for Board
members, to require the President to review lists supplied by specified
organizations, and to direct the timing of nominations.. These
provisions conflict with the constitutional division of responsibility
between the President and the Congress. The President has the sole
power of nomination; the Senate has the sole power of consent.

I note also that S. 3006 provides that, upon request of the Board,
courts may enforce subpoenas that the Attorney General has issued at
the Board’s urging. I sign this bill on the understanding that this
provision does not encroach upon the Attorney General’s usual,
plenary authority to represent the agencies of the United States,
including the Board, whenever they appear in court.

STATUTE OVERVIEW

As enacted into law, the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records

Collection Act of 1992 generally provides for the independent review of

55 Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents, v. 28, November 2, 1992,

pp. 2134-2135.


CRS-18

government records relating to the assassination of President Kennedy with a
view to their public release. Furthermore, it requires the assembly of copies of
allsuch records, whether available for public examination now or at a later time,
in a special collection maintained by the National Archives and Records
Administration. However, it does not take precedence over deeds governing
access to, or transfer or release of, gifts and donations of records to the United
States Government. The Archivist is directed to begin establishing the Kennedy
assassination records collection not later than 60 days after the enactment of the
statute, and is responsible for ensuring the physical integrity, original
provenance, and security of all records within it. Continuing oversight
jurisdiction with respect to this records collection is vested in the House
Committee on Government Operations and the Senate Committee on
Governmental Affairs.

The statute indicates that, as soon as practicable after its enactment, each
Government office shall begin identifying and organizing their records relating
to the assassination of President Kennedy and preparing for their transmission
to the Archivist for inclusion in the special collection. In so doing, offices are
directed not to destroy, alter, or mutilate any such record or withhold, react,
postpone for subsequent disclosure, or reclassify any assassination record
previously made available or disclosed to the public. However, not later than
300 days after the enactment of the statute, Government offices shall begin a
review to identify records in their custody or possession which are actually
assassination records. Of these, they are also to determine which ones have
been previously disclosed officially or made available publicly in a complete and
unredacted form, which ones were produced by a third agency or another
Government office (and transmit same or copies of same to these parties), and
which ones are covered by the standards for postponement of public disclosure
under the Kennedy assassination records collection statute. Previously released
assassination records and information are provided to the Archivist for the
special collection. Materials which are of uncertain status as to being
assassination records or which a Government office has determined are
assassination records which may be postponed, in whole or in part, for public
disclosure, are to be organized and made available to the Assassination Records
Review Board established by the statute.

The disclosure of assassination records, in whole or in part, may be
postponed "if there is clear and convincing evidence that—"

(1) the threat to the military defense, intelligence
operations, of conduct of foreign relations of the United
States posed by the public disclosure of the assassination

interest, and such public disclosure would reveal—

currently requires protection;

@) an intelligence source or method which is

disclosure of which would demonstrably impair the
national security of the United States;

provided confidential information to the United States and
would pose a substantial risk of harm to that person;

invasion of personal privacy, and that invasion of privacy is
so substantial that it outweighs the public interest;

confidentiality currently requiring protection between a
Government agent and a cooperating individual or a foreign
government, and public disclosure would be so harmful that
it outweighs the public interest; or

(6) the public disclosure of the assassination record
would reveal a security or protective procedure currently
utilized, or reasonably expected to be utilized, by the Secret
Service or another Government agency responsible for
protecting Government officials, and the public disclosure
would be so harmful that it outweighs the public interest.

The statute establishes a temporary independent agency, to be known as
the Assassination Records Review Board. This panel is composed of five
citizens, who are to be appointed by the President "after considering persons
recommended by the American Historical Association, the Organization of
American Historians, the Society of American Archivists, and the American Bar
Association." These appointees are subject to Senate confirmation, "shall be
granted the necessary security clearances in an accelerated manner subject to
the standard procedures for granting such clearances," and "shall qualify for the
necessary security clearance prior to being considered for confirmation by the
Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate."*” A vacancy on the Board
is to be filled in the same manner as an original appointment. Board members

may be removed only for specific cause; a removed member may obtain judicial
review of the action through civil suit in the District Court for the District of
Columbia and may be reinstated or granted other appropriate relief by order of
the court.

Board members elect a chair from among themselves at their initial
meeting. They serve for the total period of the Board’s functioning—two years
from the date of the enactment of the Kennedy assassination records collection
statute, with a possible one-year extension of this mandate if the Board
members, by majority vote, determine that such additional time is needed in
order to complete their work. In general, the duties of the Review Board are to
“consider and render decisions" on determinations by Government offices as to
whether or not materials constitute assassination records and whether or not
fn assassination record, in whole or in part, qualifies for postponement of
disclosure under the statute. In performing these duties, the Board is
empowered to exercise certain authority, including: directing Government offices
to complete records identification aids and to organize assassination records;
obtaining access to assassination records that have been identified and organized
by a Government office; requiring a Government office to account in writing for
the destruction of assassination records; and obtaining from Government offices
and the public such additional information, records, or testimony as may be
needed to fulfill the Board’s functions and responsibilities under the statute.
‘The Board is authorized to hold hearings, administer oaths, subpoena witnesses
and documents, and issue interpretive regulations.

The Review Board appoints and is assisted by an Executive Director and a
staff. Each of these individuals "shall be a private citizen of integrity and
impartiality who is not a present employee of any branch of the Government
and who has had no previous involvement with any official investigation or
inquiry relating to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy." In addition,
the Executive Director is to be "a distinguished professional."* All supporting
personnel must satisfy the requirements for necessary security clearances. The
Executive Director may be removed by the Board for specific cause. Other staff
members, who may be hired without regard to civil service law and regulation
for competitive service, apparently may be removed by the Board as it deems
necessary. The Board is also authorized to create such advisory committees as
it may need to assist it in fulfilling its responsibilities.

Not later than 90 days after its members are appointed, the Review Board
must publish in the Federal Register a schedule for the review of all
assassination records and, not later than 180 days after the enactment of the
Kennedy assassination records collection statute, must begin its review
operations. In all cases where the Board approves the postponement of public
disclosure of an assassination record, it is directed to seek the disclosure of
segregable portions, substitutes, or summaries of the document. These efforts
are to be reported to the Archivist.

58 106 Stat. 3453.


CRS-21

Upon determining that an assassination record shall be publicly disclosed,
contrary to the judgment of a Government office, or postponed for disclosure
and held in protected status within the special collection maintained by the
National Archives, the Review Board notifies the head of the originating body
of its determination and publishes a copy of its ruling in the Federal Register
within 14 days after making its decision. Contemporaneous notice of the
determination is also made to the President regarding executive branch records
and to the statute’s oversight committees in the case of legislative branch
materials, This notice is to include a written, unclassified justification for public
disclosure or postponement of disclosure, including an explanation of the
application of any of the postponement standards specified in the statute.

Within 30 days after receiving the Review Board’s determination and
notice, the President may override the Board’s decision regarding executive
branch records—probably by imposing a postponement of disclosure or setting
a longer postponement period than prescribed by the Board. In so doing, the
President provides the Review Board with an unclassified, written certification
of his action and the justification for same, including the applicable grounds for
postponement as specified in the Kennedy assassination records collection
statute. The Review Board subsequently publishes this Presidential
certification, upon receipt, in the Federal Register along with any accompanying
statement or other materials transmitted by or on behalf of the President with
regard to postponement of the disclosure of assassination records.

The Review Board is required to publish periodic notices in the Federal
Register summarizing postponements of assassination records disclosures. It is
also obligated to issue approximately yearly reports concerning its activities and
operations. The statute also indicates that the Board may enlist the assistance
of the Attorney General in pursuit of the release of information relevant to the
assassination of President Kennedy that is held under court seal or an
injunction of secrecy of a grand jury. Another provision states that the
Secretary of State should contact the government of the Republic of Russia "and
any other foreign government that may hold information relevant to the
assassination of President Kennedy and seek disclosure of such information."

IMPLEMENTATION

By the time of the inauguration of President William Jefferson Clinton,
only modest efforts had been made to implement the Kennedy Assassination
Records Collection Act. President Bush left the task of appointing the members
of the Assassination Records Review Board to his successor. Preliminary efforts
by the National Archives and Records Administration to begin assembling the
special collection of Kennedy assassination records were slowed somewhat by
management changes at the agency late in 1992 and the announced departure
of Archivist Don Wilson in early 1993.5

Elsewhere, at the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library, archivists,
responding to former President Ford’s public statements on the need to open
materials in government custody relating to the assassination of President
Kennedy, reportedly have processed pertinent portions of the records of the
Commission on CIA Activities Within the United States. As a result, "most of
the materials directly related to the Kennedy assassination are available" for
examination.” :

Coincidently, the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library, responding to calls
for greater disclosure of its holdings pertaining to the assassinated President,
reportedly is in the process of releasing information contained in 248 hours of
secretly taped Oval Office conversations and 12 hours of recorded telephone
conversations to which President Kennedy was a party. This action was
prompted, in part, by recent complaints by British author Nigel Hamilton, who
published the first of a projected three-volume biography of John F. Kennedy in
1992:

Further developments in implementation of the Kennedy Assassination
Records Collection Act will occur in the months ahead.

(a) Fonpines.—The Congress finds the following:

(1) Legitimate confidentiality concerns based
upon national security, personal privacy, law en-
foreement, and other recognized interests diminish
over time.

(2) There is a compelling public interest that all
government records be eventually made available to
the public.

(3) There is a compelling public interest that all
materials concerning the assassination of President
John F, Kennedy be made available to the public at
the earliest possible date.

(4) Executive Order 12356, National Security

Information, as implemented by the executive _

branch, has precluded the timely release of materials
relating to the assassination of President Kennedy.

(5) Section 552 of title 5, United States Code
(popularly known as the “Freedom of Information
Act”), as implemented by the executive branch, has
failed to secure the timely release of materials relat-
ing to the assassination of President Kennedy.

(6) The President’s Commission on the Assas-
sination of President Kennedy and the President’s
Commission on CIA Activities in the United States
were Federal agencies whose records are subject to
Federal records laws.

(7) Only in the rarest cases is there any legiti-
mate need for continued secrecy or classification of
materials relating to the assassination of President
Kennedy.

(8) The legitimacy of any government in a free
society depends on the consent of the people.

(9) The ability of a government in a free society
to obtain the consent of the people is undermined to
the degree that the people do not trust their govern-

“ment.

(10) The disclosure of records in the possession
of the Government relevant to the assassination of
President John F. Kennedy will contribute to the
trust of the people in their government. '

(b) Purpose.—The purpose of this joint resolution

21 is to make available to the public all materials relating
22 to the assassination of President Kennedy at the earliest
23 possible date.

material could reasonably be expected to constitute
an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and
that invasion of privacy is so substantial that it out-
weighs the public interest in disclosure of the assas-

(4) The public availability of the assassination
material would constitute an unjustified violation of
an express, documented understanding of con-
fidentiality between a Government agent and a co-

(5) The public availability of the assassination
material would disclose a security or protective pro-

MEMORANDUM FOR: General Counsel
Chief, DCI History Staff
Vice Chairman/NIC
Chief/IMS/DO

FROM: David M. Pearline
Deputy Director for Legislation
Office of Congressional Affairs

SUBJECT: Assassination Disclosure Act of 1992

1. Attached for your review and comment is the Joint
Resolution introduced yesterday by Congressman Stokes and
Senator Boren that would establish procedures for declassifying
records related to the assassination of JFK. The Resolution in
the House will be referred to the Rules Committee, Government
Operations Committee and the Judiciary Committee. In the
Senate, the Resolution will be referred to Government Affairs
Committee.

2. The Resolution has the following key elements:

/ a. It establishes an Assassination Material Review
Board composed of five private citizens, appointed by the
D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, and mandates that all
executive agencies’ turn any assassination material they may
possess over to the Executive Director of the Board.

Unless there is clear and convincing evidence that the
material falls within certain stated exemptions, the
Executive Director would then turn the material over to the
Archivist for release to the public. An executive agency
may appeal to the Review Board the decision by the
Exetutive Director to release assassination material.

b. Disclosure of information may be postponed if it
would reveal an intelligence agent; an intelligence source
or method -which is currently utilized or reasonably
expected to be utilized, by the US Government; or any
matter currently relating to military defense, intelligence

- operations or the conduct of foreign relations of the US
and the threat posed by disclosure of such information
outweighs any public interest in the disclosure. Other


SUBJECT: Assassination Disclosure Act of 1992

grounds for postponing disclosure include invasion of the
privacy of a living person, breach of a promise of
confidentiality, and disclosure of a security or protective
procedure used by the Secret Service.

c. Any material that falls within the above stated
categories would be referred by the Executive Director to
the Review Board which would then make a decision whether
to release the document in full or in part. The
presumption would be in favor of releasing the documents,
unless the Board determined that there was clear and
convincing evidence that the document was protected by the
exemptions. The Review Board would also have the option of
releasing to the public a summary of the document, or
inserting substitutions for information that otherwise
could not be released.

d. An executive agency is given 60 days to appeal to
the President a decision by the Review Board to release a
record, particular information in a record, a summary of a
record or a substitution for particular information. The
President may prevent the Review Board from releasing the
material if he certifies that the materials falls within
exemptions described above. The President may not delegate
this authority, and must submit to the appropriate
committee in the House and to the SSCI a written statement
setting forth the reasons for denying release of the
information and a complete copy of the material at issue.
In addition, the President must publish in the Federal
Register a notice that he has taken such action, and a
description of the size and nature of assassination
material at issue. The Executive Branch is not given any
opportunity to appeal a decision to release material
originated by the House, Senate or Warren Commission.

e. Whenever a final decision has been made to
postpone release of material, the Review Board is required
to-turn the information over to the Archivist along with a
statement as to a specific time or specific occurrence that
would trigger reconsideration of the decision not to
release the material. The Archivist would then be placed
under a continuing duty to review the material for release
to the public. :

f. The Review Board may subpoena assassination
material from agencies and compel the attendance of
witnesses at hearings. Subpoenas may be enforced in


SUBJECT: Assassination Disclosure Act of 1992

Federal court by the Department of Justice acting pursuant
to the request of the Board. At the request of the Review
Board, executive agencies are required to detail to the
Board such employees as may be necessary to carry out the
functions of the Board. Oversight of Board activities is
to be carried out by the SSCI and by an appropriate
committee of the House. The term of the Review Board shall
be two years, with an option to extend for another year.

3. We are in the process of analyzing this Resolution and
putting together comments that we can use in discussing the
Resolution with the staff of the relevant committees. I would,
therefore, appreciate receiving any comments you have on the
Resolution by 2 April.

Washington 0 ¢ 20505

CIA SPECIAL COLLECTIONS
RELEASE IN FULL

Te 2000 a

Mr. Bernard H. Martin
Assistant Director for

Legislative Reference -
Office of Management and Budget i
Washington, D.C. 20503

Dear Mr. Martin:

This is in response to your request for the views of the
Central Intelligence Agency on Senate Joint Resolution 282, the
“Assassination Materials Disclosure Act of 1992", and the
corresponding House Joint Resolution 454 ("the resolutions").

The Central Intelligence Agency fully supports the
fundamental premise underlying this legislation--that efforts
should be made to declassify and make available to the public
as expeditiously as possible government dociments relating to
the assassination of President Kennedy. In fact, the Director
of Central Intelligence (DCI) has recently established and
staffed a new unit within CIA responsible for review and
declassification of documents of historical interest, including
the JFK-related files, as part of the Agency's program of
increased openness. However, several provisions of the
resolutions raise serious concerns, as outlined below, and CIA
cannot support them as currently drafted. Our comments will
focus upon specific CIA concerns; many general issues raised by
the resolutions are better addressed by the White House or the
Department of Justice.

Initially, the resolutions are focussed on “records” rather
than the information contained in them. We are concerned that
the Agency would not have the opportunity to object to release
of CIA information contained in documents originated by
Congress or the Warren Commission. Under the resolutions,
documents originated by these entities can be released by the
Executive Director of the Assassination Materials Review Board
without any review by the President or other Executive Branch
agencies. Similarly, there is no mechanism that would allow


Letter to Mr. Bernard H. Martin

the Agency to object to release of its information contained in
documents originated by other agencies or departments. The
resolutions should provide that the agencies which originate
information have the opportunity to review that information
prior to its release. Otherwise, an anomalous situation could
be created in which documents originated by the Executive
Branch would be withheld while documents originated by Congress
containing the same Executive branch information would be
released.

The resolutions' broad definition of “assassination
material" is also troublesome. The resolutions define
“assassination material" as a record that relates “in any
manner or degree to the assassination." This unbounded
definition could cover a range of material beyond that which
has been traditionally associated with the JFK assassination.
This broad definition, coupled with the Review Board's powers
to request additional information from Executive agencies, and
the fact that the Board makes the determination of what is
assassination material, could lead to a new investigation of
the assassination, rather than review of existing files for
declassification purposes. Such an inquiry could well stray
into sensitive areas that are unrelated to the assassination.

The question of proper scope of the Review Board's charter
is a difficult one, and we do not mean bi ot abe that
reasonable requests for materials shouldydenied simply because
they were not made by a previous Presidential Commission or
Congressional Committee. However, there should be a provision
whereby Board requests for additional materials that an agency
believes are unrelated to the assassination could be .
appealed--perhaps to the President.

The resolutions contain no provision requiring security
clearances or secure document handling by the Assassination
Materials Review Board or its Executive Director/staff
elements. Absent security procedures and facilities that met
Executive branch standards, agencies would be unable to provide
classified assassination materials to the new body or its staff.

The resolutions provide a 30 day period for appealing
decisions by the Executive Director to release information.
This may not provide sufficient time for meaningful review of
what could prove to be large volumes of material at one
time--particularly where some documents may require
coordination with other agencies. We suggest that the


Letter to Mr. Bernard H. Martin

resolutions be amended to provide that agencies may file for an
automatic 30 day extension to consider whether an appeal is
necessary before material is publicly disclosed.

We believe that the Executive Director of the Review Board

‘ should have substantive expertise with respect to protection of

intelligence or law enforcement information readily available
so that the initial decisions on whether to release documents
are made on an informed basis. Under the resolutions, neither
Board members nor the Executive Director may be government
employees or have any background in the assassination
investigations. Because of this restriction, these individuals
are unlikely to have any familiarity with the documents at
issue and may well have no expertise in intelligence or law
enforcement equities. While the Executive Director may request
detailees from Executive agencies and may consult with
originating agencies, there is no requirement that he do so.
An Executive branch agency with knowledge of the information at
stake and potential harms (or lack thereof) likely to result
from release of the information may have no involvement in the
process until after an initial determination has been made to
disclose the information. Requiring that the staff informally
consult with agencies originating the information or mandating
detailees from the affected agencies (within reasonable
limits--particularly if details are to be nonreimbursable)
would ensure that relevant expertise is brought to bear as part
of the initial decision-making process.

The Board's broad powers to subpoena witnesses and
documents and hold hearings under the resolutions could
conflict with the DCI's statutory duty to protect sensitive
intelligence sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure.
We believe the Board should be required to consult with the DCI
on issues like whether a hearing should be closed, or whether a
subpoena could be narrowed, if intelligence equities are
involved. Disagreements could be appealed to the President.

Section 6 of the resolutions, which outlines the grounds
for postponement of public release of a document, may not be
adequate to protect Agency interests in certain respects. For
example there is no provision for postponing release of
Executive privilege/deliberative process, attorney-client, or
attorney work-product information. Such privileges could
always be waived in the public interest, but as the resolutions
are currently drafted, they would be wholly unavailable. ©


Letter to Mr. Bernard H. Martin

While such privileges are not likely to arise with respect to
factual information directly related to the JFK assassination,
they could well arise with respect to other documents swept up
in the resolutions' broad definition of assassination
materials. We also believe that “intelligence agent" under
section 6(1)(A) of the resolutions should be defined with
reference to the Intelligence Identities Protection Act so as
to protect the identity of covert employees of the Agency.

The Congressional oversight mechanism established for Board
activities also may conflict with the existing rules for
oversight of intelligence activities. The resolutions provide
for congressional oversight of the Review Board and its
activities by the “appropriate” House committee and the SSCI,
although we have reason to believe that the resolutions may be
amended to remove the SSCI from oversight responsibilities.
Under the resolutions, the committees would obtain copies of
all material that were not released. Thus, the resolutions are
likely to involve non-intelligence oversight committees in the
review of sensitive CIA information that would not be released
to the public. Congress enacted the Intelligence Oversight Act
of 1980 in part to reduce the number of congressional
committees with access to sensitive CIA information. Expanding
the number of committees with access to our information would
be of concern, especially if the Review Board seeks new
documents minimally-related to the assassination.

Finally, each resolution specifically provides that it does
not affect FOIA actions. We would suggest that the resolution
explicitly stay responses to FOIA requests related to
assassination materials while the Review Board is conducting
its business. The resolutions clearly have a more liberal
standards for public disclosure of information than does the
FOIA, and the public is likely to get assassination materials
more expeditiously if agencies are permitted to focus their
resources on supporting the work of the Review Board.

We appreciate the opportunity to comment on the
assassination materials resolutions. Please contact
Vicki Pepper of my staff at (703) 482-6126 with any
questions or comments concerning the Agency's position
on these resolutions.

Sincerely,

Stanley M. Moskowitz

DCI_TESTIMONY AT JFK ASSASSINATION HEARING

The DCI testified yesterday at a Senate Governmental
Affairs Committee hearing on the Assassination Materials
Disclosure Act of 1992. This is a joint resolution sponsored
by Senator David Boren and aimed at providing a comprehensive
process ultimately leading to the release of all materials
held by the United States Government regarding the
assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The DCI will
essentially repeat this testimony on 15 May for a similar
joint resolution sponsored in the House of Representatives
by Congressman Louis Stokes. i

Perhaps no public event in our lifetime has had the
impact of the murder of President Kennedy. We have all heard
reckless accusations against the Agency in connection with
that terrible event, and we all have an interest in an
accurate history of it. For that reason we are circulating
the full text of the DCI's testimony.

At the end of the attached text, you will also find a
reply by the DCI during the ensuing question-and-answer
period when Senator William Cohen asked about the jeopardy i
that might be caused by revealing the identity of a source i
so long after the fact or even if the source were deceased.

STATEMENT OF
ROBERT M. GATES
DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE
BEFORE THE COMMITTEE ON
GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS
UNITED STATES SENATE

12 May 1992



Mr. Chairman, I am here today at your request to provide my views on
Senate Joint Resolution 282, “The Assassination Materials Disclosure Act of
1992,” and to describe the nature of documents held by the CIA that relate to the
assassination of John F. Kennedy. I very much appreciate the opportunity to
speak on this important matter.

Let me begin by stating that I am in complete agreement with the purpose
underlying the joint resolution—that efforts should be made to declassify and
make available to the public as quickly as possible government documents
relating to the assassination of John F. Kennedy. We hope that opening up and
giving journalists, historians and, most importantly, the public access to
governmental files will help to resolve questions that still linger over 28 years
after the assassination. Further, I believe that maximum disclosure will discredit
the theory that CIA had anything to do with the murder of John F. Kennedy.

Even before introduction of this joint resolution, I recognized the need for
greater public access to CIA documents of historical importance. Tvo months
ago, I announced the establishment of a new unit within CIA that will be
responsible for declassifying as many historical documents as possible consistent
with the protection of intelligence sources and methods. This new unit, the
Historical Review Group, in the Agency’s Center for the Study of Intelligence,
will review for declassification documents 30 years old or older, and national
intelligence estimates on the former Soviet Union that are 10 years old or older.
In addition to the systematic review of 30-year-old documents, I have directed
the History Staff in the Center for the Study of Intelligence to assemble CIA
records focusing on particular events of historical importance, including the
assassination of President Kennedy. The Historical Review Group will then
examine the documents for the purpose of declassifying the records.

Because of high interest in the JFK papers, J am not waiting for legislation
or other agencies to start declassifying documents belonging to CIA. The
Historical Review Group, at my direction, already has begun its review of the
documents related to the assassination of President Kennedy, and I am glad to
report that the first group of these records, including all CIA documents on Lee
Harvey Oswald prior to the assassination, has been declassified with quite
minimal deletions and is being transferred to the National Archives for release to
the public. This is, I acknowledge, a small fraction of what we have, but it is an
earnest of my commitment to begin review for declassification immediately of
this material. And, indeed, as I speak, the reviewers are going through a
substantial number of documents, and I anticipate that many of these will be
released shortly.



fi €
As we carry out our program to declassify Kennedy assassination documents,
our goal will be to release as many documents as possible. In fact, I recently
approved new CIA declassification guidelines for our Historical Review Program
which specifically direct a presumption in favor of declassification. I believe we
can be very forward leaning in making these documents available to the public,
and I have instructed the Historical Review Group to take this attitude to heart.

To understand the magnitude of the effort involved in reviewing these
documents for declassification, it is important to place them in some context. The
CIA’s collection of documents related to the assassination of President Kennedy
consists of approximately 250,000-300,000 pages of material. This includes 64
boxes of copies and originals of information provided to the Warren Commission
and the House Select Committee on Assassinations and 17 boxes of material on
Lee Harvey Oswald accumulated after President Kennedy’s assassination.
Unfortunately, and for reasons I do not know, what we are dealing with is a mass
of material that is not indexed, is uncatalogued, and is highly disorganized—all
of which makes the review process more difficult. The material contains
everything from the most sensitive intelligence sources to the most mundane
news clippings.

These records include documents that CIA had in its files before the
assassination, a large number of records that CIA received later as routine
disseminations from other agencies, as well as the reports, correspondence, and
other papers that CIA prepared in the course of the assassination investigations. I
should emphasize that these records were assembled into the present collection as
a result of specific inquiries received from the Warren Commission or the House
Select Committee on Assassinations. I have prepared a chart that illustrates this

_ point.

As you can see, prior to President Kennedy’s assassination CIA held only a
small file on Lee Harvey Oswald that consisted of 33 documents (approximately
110 pages), some of which originated with the FBI, State Department, the Navy,
and newspaper clippings. Only 11 documents originated with the CIA. I have
brought along a copy of Oswald’s file as it existed before the assassination so
that you can see first-hand how slender it was at the time. As I have already
noted, we have declassified the CIA documents in this file with quite minimal
deletions, and we are providing them to the National Archives. The records in
this file dealt with Oswald’s defection to the Soviet Union in 1959 and his
activities after his return in 1962. By contrast, it was only after the assassination
that CIA accumulated the rest of the material on Oswald—some 33,000 pages—
most of which CIA received from other agencies after November 22, 1963.

( ¢

You have asked about documents in our possession generated by other
agencies. In fact, much of the material held by CIA originated with other
agencies or departments. For example, in the 17 boxes of Oswald records,
approximately 40% of the documents originated with the FBI, and about 20%
originated from the State Department or elsewhere. Our staff is still going
through the material compiled at the request of the Warren Commission and the
House Select Committee on Assassinations, which includes 63 boxes of paper
records and one box that contains 73 reels of microfilm. The microfilms in part /
overlap material in other parts of the collection. We estimate that within the 63
boxes of paper records, approximately 27% of the documents originated with a
variety of other U.S. government agencies, private organizations, and foreign and
American press. :

Although our holdings do include many documents from other agencies, we
nonetheless have a substantial collection of CIA documents that will require a
considerable effort to review and, as I said earlier, at my direction, this review
for declassification is now underway. A preliminary survey of these files has
provided us some indications of what they contain. Although the records cover a
wide variety of topics, they principally focus on CIA activities concerning Cuba
and Castro, Oswald’s defection to the Soviet Union, and Oswald’s subsequent
activities in Mexico City and New Orleans. They also include a large number of
name traces requested by the staff of the House Select Committee on
Assassinations, as well as material relating to the Garrison investigation and
Cuban exile activities.

The CIA cannot release a number of documents unilaterally because of the
limits in the Privacy Act (which protects the names of American citizens against
unauthorized disclosure), the sequestration of many documents by the House
Select Committee on Assassinations, and the fact that many of the documents
belong to agencies other than the CIA. However, we have already taken the
necessary steps to lift the sequestration, coordinate with other agencies and begin
the process of declassification. If necessary, I will ask the House for a resolution
permitting CIA to release the results of the declassification effort on the
sequestered documents.

While I expect a large amount of material can be declassified under our
program, I assume that there still will be information that cannot be released to ff
the public for a variety of reasons, including privacy concerns or the exposure of
intelligence sources and methods. Let me take a moment to give examples of this
type of material. During the investigation by the House Select Committee on
Assassinations, I understand that security and personnel files were requested on a
number of Agency employees. These files contain fitness reports (performance
evaluations), medical evaluations and credit checks on individual CIA officers.

( ¢€

Although irrelevant to the question of who killed President Kennedy, these and
other personal documents ultimately ended up in the sequestered collection of
documents. I do not believe that the benefit to the public of disclosure of this
information outweighs the clear privacy interest of the individuals in keeping this
information confidential. Similar privacy concerns exist with documents
containing derogatory information on particular individuals where the

information is based on gossip or rumor. Our files also contain names of
individuals who provided us intelligence information on a promise of
confidentiality. We would not disclose their names in breach of such a promise.
Where we cannot disclose such information to the public, the Agency will make
redactions and summarize the information in order to ensure that the maximum
amount of information is released while still protecting the identity of an agent or
the privacy of an individual.

If legislation is not passed by Congress and signed by the President
regarding the JFK papers, to enhance public confidence and provide reassurance
that CIA has not held back any information relevant to the assassination, I will
appoint a panel of distinguished Americans from outside of government to
examine whatever documents we have redacted or kept classified. They would
then issue an unclassified public report on their findings.

The effort required to declassify the documents related to the assassination of
President Kennedy will be daunting. However, it is an important program, and I
am personally committed to making it work. Even in this time of diminishing
resources within the Intelligence Community, I have directed the allocation of 15
full-time positions to expand the History Staff and to form the Historical Review
Group that will review the JFK documents and other documents of historical
interest.

I believe these actions attest to the seriousness of our intent to get these
papers declassified and released, and to open what remains classified to outside,
non-governmental review. It is against this background that, in response to this
Committee’s request, I cite our technical reservations about the mechanism
established by the joint resolution to achieve this same result. I intend to address
only Intelligence Community concerns; I will defer to the Department of Justice
on any additional problems posed by the joint resolution.

First, vesting in an outside body the determination as to whether CIA
materials related to the assassination can be released to the public is inconsistent
with my statutory responsibility to protect intelligence sources and methods.

Second, I am concemed that the joint resolution contains no provision
requiring security clearances or secure document handling by the Assassination
Materials Review Board or its staff.



€ C

Third, I am concerned that the joint resolution does not provide the Agency
with the opportunity to object to the release of CIA information contained in
documents originated by Congress or the Warren Commission. Under the joint
resolution, documents originated by these entities can be released directly by the
Executive Director of the Assassination Materials Review Board without any
review by the President or other Executive Branch agencies.

Fourth, the joint resolution provision for a 30-day period for agencies or
departments to appeal decisions by the Executive Director to release information
may not provide sufficient time for meaningful review of what could prove to be
a large volume of material at one time.

Fifth and finally, section 6 of the joint resolution, which outlines the grounds
for postponement of public release of a document, makes no provision for
postponing release of documents that may contain Executive privilege or
deliberative process, attomey-client, or attorney work-product information. While
such privileges could be waived in the public interest and are not likely to arise
with respect to factual information directly related to the JFK assassination, they
would be unavailable under the joint resolution in the rare case that they might
be needed.

These are technical problems that I believe can be solved in ways that will,
in fact, expedite the release of documents bearing on the assassination of
President Kennedy.

But, again, whatever the future course of the legislation, CIA is proceeding
even now to review for declassification the relevant documents under its control.
Further, we will cooperate with any mechanism established by the Congress and
the President to declassify all of this material.



( €

Mr. Chairman, let me close with a comment on why I am personally
committed to get these documents out. Like all Americans old enough to recall
that terrible day in November 1963, as several members of the committee have
alluded to, I also remember where I was and what I was doing. I was a college
student at William and Mary. I can remember how the word spread like wildfire
between classes of that horrible event. I made my way to Washington that
weekend and stood at the intersection of Constitution and Pennsylvania Avenues
where I waited for hours to watch the president’s funeral cortege. I will never
forget it.

I entered public service less than three years later, heeding President
Kennedy’s inaugural call, a call I think many in my generation heard. He said
then: Now the trumpet summons us again, not as a call to bear arms, though
arms we need, not as a call to battle, though in battle we are, but as a cail to bear
the burden of a long twilight struggle, year in and year out, rejoicing in hope,
patient in tribulation, a struggle against the common enemies of man—tyranny,
poverty, disease, and war itself.

Mr. Chairman, the only thing more horrifying to me than the assassination
itself is the insidious perverse notion that elements of the American government,
that my own agency, had some part in it. I am determined personally to make
public or to expose to disinterested eyes every relevant scrap of paper in CIA’s
possession in the hope of helping to dispel this corrosive suspicion. With or
without legislation, I intend to proceed. I believe I owe that to his memory.
Thank you.

SENATOR COHEN: Okay. I’m going to give you a chance in a moment,
Judge Sessions. I just want to move on quickly, because we have Mr. James—I
think, Lazar—who’s going to be testifying shortly and I will not be here for that
either. But he questions the issue of intelligence sources, that the bill provides
that disclosure can be postponed if the release of that information would reveal
an intelligence asset. And Mr. Lazar suggests that number one, that should apply
only if that particular agent is living; and then secondly, even if living, that the
burden would be upon the agency to present by clear and convincing evidence,
that disclosures of the identity of that particular agent would in fact present a
danger to him or to his family, I assume, or serious damage could result from the
disclosure of his identity.

Could you, number one, give us some instance in which disclosure of a
deceased intelligence agent or asset would be contrary to our national security
interests? And then secondly, address the issue of clear and convincing evidence
that the agent being alive, that he might be jeopardized by that disclosure?


€ €

GATES: At the root of effective intelligence work is our ability to deal with
people who are willing to provide us with information and to assure them of
confidentiality and that their identity will be protected. The Congress has
recognized that. The Congress has even recognized the importance of protecting
the covert identities of American case officers dealing with such foreign agents.

I believe that we have an obligation to protect the confidentiality of our
sources, regardless of the amount of time that has passed. And I believe that if
the agent is deceased, that we also have to take into account the potential
considerations for that agent’s family. There are many countries in the world
today, in which despite whatever political changes have taken place, families of
those who have defected-or who have proven to be agents or who are revealed to
have been agents are persecuted or mal-treated or where their life becomes much
more difficult, and I think we have an obligation to these people.

I think you—I think we are not in a position of saying “never.” But I think
that any decision with respect to revealing the identity of a source or an agent,
even 20 or 30 years after the information was reported is one that has to be taken
with enormous care and deliberation, one that must involve knowledge of the
particular circumstances involved, both at the time the information was received
and the circumstances of the agent and his family.

In short, so important is the ability to protect the confidentiality of sources
that a decision to reveal that identity would have to be the result of the most
careful consideration.

_. + OCA 3097-92
7 5 October 1992

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director, CSI
Chief/LIT/OGC

FROM: * David M. Zinn
Legislation Division
Office of Congressional Affairs

SUBJECT: Congress Passes JFK Bill

Congress on 30 September passed the Senate version of
the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records

* Collection Act of 1992, calling for the public disclosure of

government documents related to the assassination of
President Kennedy. The key features of the bill are as
follows:

* The bill requires government agencies, including CIA,
to transmit their. respective JFK assassination records
to the National Archives for public disclosure within
300 days of enactment of the bill unless the records
qualify for "postponement." Government offices that
hold JFK assassination records created by another
office should transmit those records to the originating
office rather than to the Archives.

* Disclosure of an assassination record may be postponed
for various _reasons, including, where there is clear
that disclosure would identify:

(a) an intelligence agent whose identity currently
requires protection;

(b) an intelligence source or method which is
currently utilized or reasonably expected to be
utilized by the USG;" or

(c) a confidential USG source who would face a
substantial risk of harm if exposed.

In many cases, postponement is justified only if the
potential harm to national security also outweighs the
public interest in disclosure.


SUBJECT: Congress Passes JFK Bill

The bill creates a Review Board--composed of 5
individuals appointed by the President with the advice
and consent of the Senate--to review agency decisions
to postpone the disclosure of records. Records
determined by government agencies to qualify for
"postponement" must be made available to the Board
within 300 days of enactment of the legislation. If
the Board agrees with an agency's determination to
postpone disclosure, the records will be forwarded to a
protected collection at the Archives.

The bill authorizes the President to override. a Review
Board decision that executive branch records must be
publicly disclosed:

The Administration has expressed its. support for the

bill, and the President is expected to sign it into law. A
copy. of the bill is attached to this memorandum.

THE WHITE HOUSE DECL ii ANDIOR
a RE FORMATION
office of the Press Secretary jy qiig NOCUN)
(Paducah, Kentucky)
For Immediate Release , October 27, 1992

STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT

Today I am signing into law S. 3006, the "President John F.
Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992." This
legislation provides for the review and, wherever possible, the
release of records about the assassination of President Kennedy
that have not yet been made public. I fully support the goals
of this legislation.

In the minds of many Americans, questions about President
Kennedy's assassination remain unresolved. Although the
Government already has released many thousands of documents,
the existence of additional, undisclosed documents has led to
speculation that these materials might shed important new light
on the assassination. Because of legitimate historical interest
in this tragic event, all documents about the assassination
should now be disclosed, except where the strongest possible
reasons counsel otherwise.

While I am pleased that this legislation avoids the
chief constitutional problems raised by earlier versions of
the bill considered by the Congress, it still raises several
constitutional questions. First, S. 3006 sets forth the
grounds on which the release of documents may be postponed,
but this list does not contemplate nondisclosure of executive
branch. deliberations or law enforcement information of the
executive branch (including the entities listed in
sections 3(2)(G) through (K)), and it provides only a narrow
basis for nondisclosure of national security information. My
authority to protect these categories of information comes
from the Constitution and cannot be limited by statute.
Although only the most extraordinary circumstances would
require postponement of the disclosure of documents for reasons
other than those recognized in the bill, I cannot abdicate my
constitutional responsibility to take such action when
necessary. The same applies to the provision purporting to
give certain congressional committees "access to any records
held or created by the Review Board." This provision will
be interpreted consistently with my authority under. the
Constitution to protect confidential executive branch materials
and to supervise and guide executive branch officials.

Second, S. 3006 requires the Board to report to the
President and the Congress. If the bill were interpreted to
require simultaneous reports, S. 3006 would intrude upon the
President's authority to supervise subordinate officials in the
executive branch. I will construe the provisions to require
that the Board report to the President before it reports to the
Congress.

Third, the bill purports to set the qualifications
for Board members, to require the President to review lists
supplied by specified organizations, and to direct the timing
of nominations. These provisions conflict with the constitu-
tional division of responsibility between the President and the
Congress. ‘The President has the sole power of nomination; the
Senate has the sole power of consent.

(OVER)


2

I note also that S. 3006 provides that, upon request of the
Board, courts may enforce subpoenas that the Attorney General
has issued at the Board's urging. I sign this bill on the
understanding that this provision does not encroach upon the
Attorney General's usual, plenary authority to represent the
agencies of the United States, including the Board, whenever
they appear in court. :

S. 3006 will help put to rest the doubts and suspicions
about the assassination of President Kennedy. I sign the bill
in the hope that it will assist in healing the wounds inflicted
on our Nation almost 3 decades ago.

Introduction

This memorandum analyzes the principal duties, responsibilities, and procedures of the
Assassination Records Review Board (Review Board) and other government offices
under the President John F. Kennedy Records Collection Act of 1992 (the “JFK Act” or
“the Statute”). Because the JFK Act establishes the duties and powers of the
Assassination Records Review Board, it is important to understand the scope of the
Statute's provisions and anticipate its potential pitfalls. This memorandum ~ which is
based principally on an analysis of the JFK Act and its Senate Report’ — identifies: (a)
the statutory provisions governing the Review Board's duties, including all of the
Board’s reporting obligations under the Statute; (b) the Board’s powers under the JFK
Act; (c) the statutory procedures governing the review process; and (d) the
responsibilities of other governmental entities to further the goals of the Statute? -

Part I: Statutory Duties of the Assassination Records Review Board

The JFK Act does not systematically set forth the duties of the Review Board. Rather,
the description of the Board's duties are interspersed among several different statutory

. :

'S. Rep. No. 102-328, 102d Cong., 2d Sess. (1992) (“Senate Report”), reprinted in
part, in 1992 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2965. The Senate Report provides, inter alia, a section-by-
section analysis of the final Senate version of the JFK Act.

*This memorandum does not address the substantive guidelines pertaining to -
postponements that are addressed in Section 6. :

°"This memorandum is designed to identify comprehensively the issues that are
of immediate importance and concern to the Board. Accordingly, some important
statutory provisions that are not of immediate concern are not discussed. For example,
there is no discussion of the qualifications or appointment of Board members (Sec. 7(b)),
removal of Board members (Sec. 7(g)), definitions (unless they pertain to the review
Process or the powers of the Board) (Sec. 3), or provisions pertaining to the hiring of
staff (Sec. 8(b)).


provisions.’ With the exception of the Board's procedural duties related to the review
process, which will be described in Part III below, the remaining duties (including —
reporting obligations) of the Board are as follows:

First, the Board should publish a schedule for review of records in the Federal Register.
“The Review Board shall . . . not later than 90 days after the date of its appointment,
publish a schedule for review of all assassination records in the Federal Register.” Sec.
9(b)(1). The Statute does not disclose the meaning of “schedule” — that is whether it is a
list or a time-frame. Assuming anenactment date of October 6, 1994, a “schedule”
should have been published by January 2, 1995. Although the Review Board does not
have sufficient information to draft or to describe with particularity such a schedule, it
would be advisable to prepare promptly a general schedule so that the Board will come
into compliance as soon as possible with this provision of the Statute.

=-

“The sections of the JFK Act may be described as follows:

Section 1 Short Title

Section 2 Findings, Declarations, and Purposes

Section3 —_ Definitions

Section4 Creation and Implementation of the JFK Collection at NARA

Section 5 Government Office Responsibilities (identify, review, and transfer
records)

Section6 Grounds for Postponement of Assassination Records

Section7 Establishment and Powers of Review Board

Section 8 Review Board Staff z

Section9 — Review of Records by the Review Board

Section10 Records Under Seal; Foreign Records

Section11 Rules of Statutory Construction

Section 12 Termination of the JFK Act

Section 13 Appropriations

Section14 Severability Clause

‘Several of the Board's reporting obligations are triggered by the date of
enactment of the Statute. In addition to the requirement to publish a schedule raised
above, another such example is that the Board's first annual “report shall be issued on
the date that is 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act ....” Sec. 9(f)(2).
Technically, the date of enactment was October 26, 1992, although this memorandum
will assume that the “date of enactment” for the Board's purposes — although not for
the purposes of the obligations of other government offices — was October 6, 1994, the
date the technical amendments were enacted. Pub.L. 103-345 §§ 2 to 5, 108 Stat. 3128-
3130.


-6-

Second, the Board should have begun its review of records by the first week of April,
1995. “The Review Board shall . . . not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of
this Act, begin its review of assassination records under this Act.” Sec. 9(b)(2).
Technically, the Board has begun its review — although it has as of yet made no final
decisions. In order to comply with the “spirit” of the Statute, the Board should begin
making decisions promptly.

Third, the Board must submit four ongoing reports regarding the results of its decisions
to postpone or to release information. The Board has four separate reporting -
requirements for describing the ongoing results of its decisions. First, the Board is
required to report the results of its decisions on a document-by-document basis to the
government office whose records it is reviewing as well as to the President (or to
Congress in the case of legislative records). Second, the results of decisions must be
reported in the Federal Register within 14 days of the date of the decision. Third, the
Board must make a monthly summary report in the Federal Register. Fourth, the Board
must prepare a document-by-document report to be submitted to NARA that describes
the decision-making process for each record. Sec. 9(c)(3).

Fourth, the Board must produce an Annual Report to Congress. The Board must submit
an Annual Report to Congress on the anniversary of the enactment of the legislation.
Thus the Board's first Annual Report is due on or before October 6, 1995. The Annual
Report must include information on the following topics: (a) finances; (b) progress
made on review; (c) estimates for completion of the review; (d) any special problems
(including the degree of cooperation of government agencies); (e) a record of the
volume of records reviewed and a summary of decisions; (f) an explanation of any

additional needs of the Review Board; and (g) an appendix containing copies of reports

of postponed records. Sec. 9(f)(3).

Fifth, the Board must produce a Final Report. “Upon its termination, the Review Board
shall submit reports to the President and the Congress including a complete and
accurate accounting of expenditures during its existence, and shall complete all other
reporting requirements under this Act.” Sec. 7(0)(2). a

Sixth, the Board must inform the President and Congress in advance of the termination
of its activities. The Review Board must give Congress 90 days notice of the anticipated
termination date for its operations. Sec. 9(f)(4).

Seventh, the Board must transfer its own records to NARA. “[A}ll Review Board
records” are to be transferred to NARA. Sec. 4 (a)(2)(C). See also 7(1) and 7(0)(3). The
Statute is silent on the question whether the Review Board must prepare Record
Identification Forms (or Identification Aids) for its own records prior to their


submission to NARA.

Eighth, the Review Board is under the Oversight Jurisdiction of the Appropriate Senate
and House Committees. The Review Board operates under the continuing oversight
jurisdiction of House and Senate committees. Sec. 7(1).

Part II: Statutory Powers of the Review Board.

The powers granted to the Review Board are not listed in any single section of the
Statute, but are instead interspersed throughout. The Review Board's powers will first
be enumerated below, followed by a more detailed discussion of the four most
significant powers: the subpoena power; the power to grant immunity; powers to order
federal agencies to comply with the Statute; and the power to require the transfer of
records to the Review Board.®

Enumeration of powers. The JFK Act grants the Review Board the authority to:

(1) “direct Government offices to complete identification aids and organize
assassination records” Sec. 7(j)(1)(A). :

(2) “direct Government offices to transmit to the Archivist assassination
records” Sec. 7(j)(1)(B); see also Sec. 9(1).

(3) “direct Government offices” to provide “substitutes and summaries of
[postponed] assassination records” Sec. 7(j)(1)(B) (emphasis added).

(4) “obtain access to assassination records that have been identified and
organized by a Government office” Sec. 7(j)(1(C)(i).

(5) “direct a Government office to . . . make available additional information,
records, or testimony from individuals” and, “if necessary[,] investigate
the facts surrounding additional information, records, or testimony from
individuals” provided that the “Review Board has reason to believe” that
obtaining such additional information “is required to fulfill its functions
and responsibilities under this Act.” Sec. 7(j)(1)(C)(ii).

‘The Board is given some additional authority that is not important for present
purposes, such as the power to “receive information from the public,” “use the Federal
Supply Service” and “use the United States mails ....” Sec. 7(j)(E), (G), and (H). The
Review Board also may use the services of GSA. Sec. 7(m).

Board. Sec. 5(b); Sec. 5(c)(2)(B); Sec. 9(a) (see discussion below).

“request the Attorney General to petition any court in the United States or
abroad to release any information relevant to the assassination .. ..” Sec.
10(a)(1) (see discussion in Part IV below). :

“request the Attorney General to petition any court in the United States to ~
release any information relevant to the assassination . . . that is held under
the injunction of secrecy of a grand jury.” Sec. 10(b)(1).® (see discussion in
Part IV below).

Subpoena power. The JFK Act is ambiguous with respect to the Review Board's
subpoena powers. The Statute refers to the subpoena power in two provisions. The
Statute first states that the Review Board has the authority to “request the Attorney
General to subpoena private persons to compel testimony, records, and other
information” Sec. 7(j)(1)(C)(iil) (emphasis added). This provision may be read in one of

"Items (1) through (9) are also identified in the Senate Report 42-43.

‘Such requests are deemed to constitute “a particularized need” under Rule 6 of
the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Sec. 10(a)(2)(B).

two different ways. It could be read to give the Board authority only to request the
assistance of the Attorney General, but not to have the authority to issue subpoenas on
its own behalf. The second way of reading the provision is that the Board has the -
power to issue subpoenas on its own authority and that it may request the Attorney
General to provide assistance to the Board in issuing such subpoenas.

The second provision of the Statute that addresses the subpoena power provides that
the Board may “hold hearings, administer oaths, and subpoena witnesses and
documents.” Sec. 7(j)(1)(F) (emphasis added). This second provision is also ambiguous.
There are at least three different ways that it could be read. First, it could be read in
tandem with the earlier provision, meaning that the Board may issue subpoenas only
with the Attorney General's authorization. Second, it could mean that the Board may
issue subpoenas on its own authority, but only as ancillary to holding hearings. Finally,
the provision could be a simple and direct grant of authority to the Review Board to
issue subpoenas.

Although the Statute on its face does not clearly require or exclude any of these
interpretations, the Senate Report provides useful guidance in its statement that the
Review Board has the full power to issue subpoenas on its own authority and that the
role of the Attorney General is simply to provide additional assistance to the Board.
The Senate Réport interprets the JFK Act as providing that: “[T]he Review Board ...
has the authority to subpoena private persons and to enforce the subpoenas through
the courts.”

Because the Senate Report speaks clearly, and because it can be read consistently with -
the Statute,” the Review Board may reasonably conclude that it may issue subpoenas ~
on its own authority and that the role of the Attorney General is to provide assistance to ~
the Board." However, because there is a degree of ambiguity in the Statute, it would be
prudent for the Board to reach an understanding with the Attorney General prior to the
issuance of its first subpoena.

_ *Senate Report 19 (emphasis added).

"Under federal law, an agency is entitled to “substantial deference” when
interpreting its own enabling legislation, provided that its interpretation is
“reasonable.”

"Moreover, it should perhaps be noted that the grant of the subpoena power to
an agency, such as the Board, implies that the power may be extended to the staff when
acting in accordance with the Board's authority. See Administrative Procedure Act, 5
US.C. 556(c).


-10- °

Immunity power. The Board is granted the power to immunize witnesses from criminal
prosecution. Sec. 7(k). This is an important power that can be very useful in eliciting
testimony from reluctant witnesses. Because granting of immunity may affect the
prosecutorial function, it would be advisable to consult in advance with the Attorney
General regarding the manner and procedures for immunizing witnesses.

Power to order federal offices to comply with the JFK Act. The Board is given the
authority to order government offices within the executive and legislative branches to
comply with the terms of the JFK Act.” Thus the Board may “direct a Government .
office to . .. make availabte additional information, records, or testimony from
individuals” and, “if necessary[,] investigate the facts surrounding additional
information, records, or testimony from individuals” provided that the “Review Board
has reason to believe” that obtaining such additional information “is required to fulfill
its functions and responsibilities under this Act.” Sec. 7(j)(1)(C)(ii).

The Senate Report speaks of this particular power as being “extremely important to the
proper implementation and effectiveness of the Act because it provides the Review
Board with the authority to seek the fullest disclosure possible by. going beyond the
information and records which government offices initially chose to make available to
the public and the Review Board.”® The Report further presumes that all government
offices should “comply expeditiously to satisfy the Review Board's request and need for
access.” The Senate Report summarizes this by stating that: “the Review Board has
the authority to direct any government office to produce additional information and
records which it believes are related to the assassination.”

Although the Board is granted the power to order government offices to comply, there"
remains the question of what measures are available to the Board in order to enforce
compliance. The Statute does not, however, answer this question. Under general
provisions of federal law, one agency does not have the power to seek judicial relief
against another agency unless it is specifically granted power to do so in its enabling

"The Statute defines “government office” as “any office of the Federal
Government that has possession or control of assassination records” (Sec. 5), which
would seem to extend to the judiciary as well. However, the specific examples listed in
Section 5 are all from the executive and legislative branches.

legislation. The JFK Act does not clearly provide the Board with such power. In the
absence of any statutory provision, inter-agency legal disputes are traditionally
resolved by seeking the opinion of the Attorney General.'® “The issuance of an
Attorney General's opinion is frequently used to settle inter-agency disputes ....
Professor Peter Strauss states: ‘Once the agencies have received advice from the
Attorney General, they may lack the means to generate valid litigation that would test
its correctness... .’”"”

Power to require government offices to transfer records to the Review Board.
Government agencies are to maintain custody of their own records during the review
process unless “the Review Board requires the physical transfer of records for purposes
of conducting an independent and impartial review” or “transfer is necessary for an
administrative hearing or other Review Board function. . . .” Sec. 5(b). See also
5(c)(2)(E); Sec. 9(a). Agencies also are instructed to make records available for the
Review Board's inspection. Sec. 5(b) and 5(c)(2)(E-F); 5(c)(2)(H) — including any records
about which there is any uncertainty as to whether they are assassination records. Sec.
5(c)(2)(F). Agencies also must “[mlake available to the Review Board any additional
information and records that the Review Board has reason to believe it requires for
conducting a review under this Act.” Sec. 5(c)(2)(H).

Part III: Statutory Guidance on Review Procedures and Transfer of Records to
NARA.

The JFK Act establishes general guidelines for the procedures to be followed in
reviewing records. The basic procedures are relatively straightforward: government
offices that possess assassination records are to locate and review the records to
determine what can be released and what should be postponed. The postponed records
are then to be made available to the Review Board for its independent assessment. But
there are many questions left unanswered. For example, agencies are allowed to
present “clear and convincing evidence” in order to sustain their postponements, but no

‘The President could, of course, solve the political aspects of an inter-agency
dispute by ordering the relevant agency to comply with his directives.

Peter Strauss, An Introduction to Administrative Justice in the United States 101 n.152
(1989)).

mechanism is established for when and how such evidence should be presented."*

The JFK Act provides two types of guidance relating to the review process. First, the
Statute provides substantive guidance relating to postponements. Second, the Statute
explains the basic procedural steps that follow from the Review Board's decisions. This
memorandum addresses only the procedural steps established by the Statute.”

A. Review Board Quorum and Voting Requirements. : 7
The JEK Act does not directly address quorum or voting requirements for Board
meetings. The sole relevant guidance from the Act is its repeated statement that it
presumes disclosure, which suggests that a majority of the members of the Board would
need to vote for a postponement (rather than requiring a majority to vote for a release)
in order for the postponement to be sustained.”

''Given the absence of clear statutory guidance on the question of when agencies
should be able to present their evidence, it would be appropriate for the Review Board
to consult with the government offices to determine efficient, fair, and reasonable
procedures to afford opportunities to present evidence. The Senate Report offers the
following guidance: “to the extent possible, consultation with the government offices
creates an understanding on each side as to the basis and reasons for their respective
recommendations and determinations.” Senate Report 31.

'SThe substantive rules relating to postponement decisions will be addressed in a
separate memorandum. :

See, for example, “The underlying principles guiding the legislation are
independence, public confidence, efficiency and cost effectiveness, speed of records
disclosure, and enforceability. In order to achieve these objectives, the Act creates a
presumption of disclosure upon the government, and it establishes an expeditious
process for the review and disclosure of the records.” Senate Report 17.

The JFK Act is, however, silent on several procedural issues affecting internal Review
Board decisionmaking, including: (a) whether Board voting must be by a majority or
supermajority; (b) whether the statutory presumption of disclosure necessarily implies
that a majority (or supermajority) must vote against release rather than requiring a
majority (or supermajority) to favor release: (c) whether the statutory presumption
favoring disclosure implies that a “tie vote” requires release of information; (d) what
constitutes a quorum for the purpose of decisions on the release of information and for
other purposes; (e) whether the Board may delegate some or all of its postponement


-13-°

The Administrative Procedures Act, which regulates agency rulemaking and establishes
federal agency notice and publication requirements, does not establish rules governing
agencies’ internal rulemaking and voting requirements, although the Sunshine Act does
establish some limited voting requirements related to decisions on holding meetings.”
Similarly, Executive Order 12,866 (Sept. 30, 1993), exempts from reporting requirements
those rules that “are limited to agency organization, management, or personnel

matters ....”” Accordingly, the significant legal restriction on the Board's internal
voting procedures, quorum requirements, and other internal operating procedures, is
that they be reasonable and rational.”

It would be advisable for the Review Board to establish voting and quorum
requirements as soon as practicable. Although the law does not require the formal
establishment of voting and quorum requirements, it would probably be advisable for
the Board to establish such rules (subject to later revision or amendment) and to make
the rules and procedures available for public inspection in the Reading Room.

B. Statutory Constraints on Postponement Decisions.

The Statute provides that when postponements are sustained in whole or in part, the
Board must nevertheless disclose as much information as possible ~ including through
the use of substitute language. The Statute requires that whenever a record cannot be

decisions to subcommittees of the Board; (f) whether a roll-call is required; and (g)
whether the votes of the individual members must be recorded.

?!The relevant portion of the Administrative Procedure Act provides that the
reporting requirements that pertain to most federal rulemaking procedures do not
apply to an agency's “interpretive rules, general statements of policy, or rules of agency
organization, procedure, or practice . . . .” 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A). The Administrative
Procedures Act contains some quorum and voting requirements with respect to

noticing meetings. 5 U.S.C. 552b.
Exec. Order No. 12,866.

See, forexample, Idaho v. ICC, 939 F.2d 784, 788 (9th Cir. 1991) (“In the absence
of Congress’ explicit direction, the [Interstate Commerce] Commission is empowered to
prescribe regulations and procedures to carry out [its obligations under its enabling
statute]. We need only satisfy ourselves that the Commission set forth a rational basis
for its notational vote counting policy.”)


-14-.

disclosed in its entirety, the Review Board shall attempt to “provide for the disclosure
of segregable parts, substitutes, or summaries of such a record.” Sec. 9(c)(2)(A). These
substitutes shall be performed “in consultation with the originating body and consistent
with the standards for postponement under this Act... .” Sec. 9(c)(2)(B). Although this
language provides that the substitutes shall be drafted in consultation with the
agencies, the Statute does not disclose when, how, or under what circumstances such
consultations should take place.“ The Senate Report nevertheless presumes that
because the Statute mandates broad disclosure, the need for such summaries will be

infrequent.

.
While it is intended that government office[s] shall have the ability to
issue such substitutes or summaries in lieu of an actual record, this
practice should be limited to the rarest cases if ever, with the
understanding that the release of information other than official records
will perpetuate public distrust and undermine public confidence in the
government's responsibility to disclose the assassination records.”

*The Statute requires that:

all postponed assassination records determined to require continued
postponement shall require an unclassified written description of the
reason for such continued postponement. Such description shall be
provided to the Archivist and published in the Federal Register upon
determination. ‘

Sec. 5(g)(2)(B). The Statute does not state which entity bears the responsibility for
drafting written explanations for continued postponements. Because the requirement is
placed in Section 5 of the JFK Act, it would appear that the obligation would belong to
the Government office that was in possession of the records iri question. The specific .
provision in which the requirement appears, Subsection (g), is titled “Periodic review of

- postponed assassination records.” Thus the location of the requirement within the
Statute, the title of the section, and the subtitle of subsection all point to the requirement
of drafting the written description for the reason for the postponement as adhering to
the Government office where the record originated. Although neither the language nor
the location of the subsection obligates the Review Board to undertake the
responsibility, it may, as a practical matter, be advisable for the Review Board to accept
the burden.

Senate Report 45.


-15-.

C. Review Board Reporting Requirements.

Once the Review Board has made its decision, it must report the results to the
government office whose record has been reviewed, to the President (or Congress), to
NARA, and in the Federal Register. (See Part | above.) The Board must not only report
its decisions in a timely manner, but it must report specific types of information about
its decisions.

Timing of reports. After a decision is made to postpone or to release a document, “the
Review Board shall notify the head of the originating body of its determination and
publish a copy of the determination in the Federal Register within 14 days after the
determination is made.” Sec. 9(c)(4)(A). At the same time (i.e., within 14 days), the
Review Board must give notice regarding its decisions to the President (for Executive
Branch records) or to the Congressional oversight committees (for Legislative Branch
records). Sec. 9(c)(4)(B). In addition, there must be ongoing monthly reports to the
Federal Register.

Content of the Reports to the President, Congress, and the originating office. The
Report to the President (or Congress) and to the originating office “shall contain a
written unclassified justification for public disclosure or postponement of disclosure,
including an explanation of the application of any standards contained in section 6.”
Sec. 9(c)(4)(B).

Content of monthly reports in the Federal Register. There must be a “Notice to the
Public” of decisions once every 30 days in Federal Register. (Sec. 9(d)(3)). These notices
must include “a description of the subject, originating agency, length or other physical
description, and each ground for postponement that is relied upon.” Sec. 9(e).

Content of the Report to NARA. For each postponed record, the Boatd must send a
Report to the Archivist containing the following information: (a) a description of
actions; and (b) a specified time or occurrence for the record to be opened. (Although
the Statute requires a form for NARA and for the Agencies, it appears that the forms
could easily be consolidated so as to include the relevant information and prevent
unnecessary duplication.)

D. The Role of the President (Executive Branch Records).
The Statute provides no clear guidance with respect to the mechanics of Presidential

review of Board decisions. It is frequently assumed in discussions of the JFK Act that
the President's role is that of route of appeal for an agency that is displeased with a


-16-.

decision by the Board. This is not, however, what the Statute provides. According to
the Statute, the President possesses the full power and authority to make all decisions
for both postponement and disclosure of executive branch records.* According to the
Statute, once the Board makes a

formal determination ... the President shall have the sole and
nondelegable authority to require the disclosure or postponement of such
record or information under the standards set forth in section 6, and the
President shall provide the Review Board with an unclassified written
certification specifying the President's decision with 30 days . . . stating the
justification for the president's decision, including the applicable grounds
for postponement under section 6, accompanied by a copy of the
identification aid .... :

Sec. 9(d)(1) (emphasis added)” This language clearly suggests that it is not the Board
that makes decisions, subject to appeal by the President, but it is the President that
makes decisions after having been informed of the Board’s “formal determination.”
The Senate Report makes the same point: “the President has the sole and nondelegable
authority to require the disclosure or postponement of such record or information

?6The provision acknowledging presidential authority over executive branch
records intentionally excluded the President from any responsibility over legislative
branch records. Senate Report 32. The Senate Report recognizes that there might be a
dispute between the President and the Congress with respect to identifying records as -
executive or congressional:

For example, within the files of the House Select Committee on
Assassinations (HSCA) there are staff notes [that] rely in part on
information obtained or developed by the CIA. Under the ‘third agency’
rule in the Act, the CIA could choose to recommend that the Review
Board postpone those portions which it identifies as originating at the
CIA. If the Review Board declined the recommendation and the President
sought to override the determination, the President would be limited to
postpone those sentences or words which were originated or developed
by the CIA. The remainder of the document would have to be publicly
disclosed.

Senate Report 32.

"Postponement decisions made by the President continue to be subject to
periodic review and downgrading. Sec. 9(d)(2).


-i7-.

under the standards set forth in section 6, and the President must provide the Review
Board with an unclassified written certification specifying his decision within 30 days
after the Review.””

Although the Statute requires the President to be faithful to the oe of section
6 of the Act when making his decisions, there is no procedural mechanism either to
ensure that the President fulfills this responsibility or that he complies within the
statutorily mandated 30 day period.

Given these constraints, jt would seem advisable for the Review Board to begin
negotiations with the White House for the disposition of records once the Board has
made its “formal determination.” It may be that the White House, which no doubt does
not want to be distracted from its other duties by confronting the task of a document-
by-document review, will be willing adopt a procedure that effectively ratifies the
Board's decision within thirty days unless an agency makes a particularized appeal.

The Statute does not seem to require the President to make such an agreement, but it
would seem to be consistent with the Statute, to be time and effort efficient, and to
spare all parties needless confusion.

Once the Review Board is notified of the President's decision, it must memorialize that
decision on the record form that it forwards to NARA. Sec. 9(d)(3).

E. The Role of the Congress (Legislative Branch Records).

Unlike Executive Branch records, where the President retains final decisionmaking
authority, legislative records are not subject to further procedural review by Congress.
Although Congress must be notified of the Board's decisions, it does not have a role
comparable to that which the President retains for executive branch documents. The
Review Board's decisions are thus automatic, with one important exception: Congress
retains the power to pass a resolution in both houses to limit the Review Board's
actions. The Senate Report explains that “[flor congressional records, in the event that
the Congress disagrees with a determination by the Review Board, each House would
be required to adopt a resolution to change or create a rule governing the disposition of
its records at issue.” This suggests that Congress will remove itself from the

Senate Report 46.

?° Senate Report 18. Elsewhere the Report explains this in somewhat different
terms: when documents contain both executive and legislative equities, the President
may protect only executive branch interests. “The remainder of the document would


-18-.

document-by-document review process, but could undercut the Review Board's
decisions if it becomes sufficiently disturbed by the Board's decisions.

F. Transfer of Records to NARA.

Once the executive and legislative branch records decisions are final, the Board is
required to transfer the original records and identification forms directly to NARA.
Sec. 4 (d)(2). The Senate Report clearly anticipates that all originals will be transferred
to the JFK Collection, regardless of whether there are continuing postponements. “The
Committee believes that such review should occur at a single facility. That will be most
effectively achieved by bringing the review committee to the documents and not vice
versa. ... [TJhere is less likelihood of loss or destruction, and therefore ease of access at
a single central location.”

The records at NARA will be subject to periodic and continuing review, even after the
Review Board ceases to operate. The periodic review will be conducted jointly by
NARA and the originating body. “All postponed or redacted records shall be reviewed
periodically by the originating agency and the Archivist consistent with the
recommendations of the Review Board under section 9(c)(3)(B).” Sec. 5(g)(1)..For - -..-
congressional records, the House and Senate committees “shall have continuing
oversight jurisdiction with respect to . . . the disposition of postponed records after
termination of the Review Board.” Sec. 7(1). The Act “shall continue in effect until such
time as the Archivist certifies to the President and the Congress that all assassination
records have been made available to the public in accordance with the Act.” Sec. 12(b).

Part IV: Statutory Responsibilities of Government Offices under the JFK Act

Obligations of all Government offices possessing assassination records. The Statute
required all government offices possessing assassination records to “review, identify
and organize each assassination record in its custody or possession for disclosure to the
public, review by the Review Board, and transmission to the Archivist.” Sec. 5(c)(1).
This provision effectively ordered agencies to have completed the review process by
August, 1993. The Senate Report is even more explicit: “Government offices holding
assassination records are required to begin organizing and reviewing such records

have to be publicly disclosed.” Senate Report 32.

Senate Report 25.


-19-

upon enactment and have this work completed within ten months of enactment.”

Specific Obligation of Presidential and Other Libraries to Comply with JFK Act.

The Statute instructs Presidential libraries to give priority to processing assassination
records. Sec. 5(c)(3). According to the Senate Report, the JFK Act “specifically requires
. the directors of presidential libraries to expedite the review of all assassination records
and make them available to the Review Board as required by this Act. It is incumbent
on the presidential libraries to determine which of its records may qualify as
‘assassination records’, regardless of whether the records were conveyed to the
government by a deed or gift or donation... . 7

General Obligations to Cooperate With the Review Board. In addition to their
statutory obligations to identify and review assassination records, it is the sense of
Congress that “all Executive agencies should cooperate in full with the Review Board to
seek the disclosure of all information relevant to the assassination of President John F.
Kennedy consistent with the public interest.” Sec. 10(b)(3).

Specific Obligations of Justice and State to Cooperate With the Review Board. The
Department of Justice and the Department of State are given particularized
responsibilities to assist the Review Board. The Attorney General is to assist in issuing
subpoenas, obtaining court records, and obtaining Grand Jury testimony under seal.
Sec. 10(a)(1)-(2) and 10(b)(1). The Statute also provides that it is “the sense of Congress”
that the Secretary of State should assist the Review Board in obtaining records from
foreign governments. Sec. 10(b)(2).

Senate Report 18. See also ibid at 38, 39 (300. days).

ADMINISTRATIVE - INTERNAL USE ONLY

From the Desk of Robert J. Eatinger

NOTE FOR: J. Barry Harrelson @ DA
FROM: Robert J. Eatinger @ DCI
DATE: 06/14/95 06:14:47 PM
SUBJECT: ARRB Questions

The JFK Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) has indicated that they wish to take possession of the original records from CIA in
order to conduct their review of the postponements sought by the Agency those records. Further, the ARRB has stated that the JFK Act
(44 USC 2107 note) gives them the responsibility for transferring records to the National Archives and Records Administration, not the
originating agency. You asked me to review the JFK Act and comment on these positions.

The JFK Act provides that the original records are to be held by the originating agency unless physical transfer is required to let the Board
do its job. The Act states at section S{a):

Pending the outcome of the Review Board's review activity, a Government
office shall retain custody of assassination records for purposes of preservation,
security, and efficiency, unless~

(1) the Review Board requires the physical transfer of records for reasons of
conducting an independent and impartial review; or

{2} such transfer is necessary for an administrative hearing or other official
Review Board function.

You should see also Section 5(b) of the Act which reposes in the originating agencies the responsibility to retain assassination records
pending review activity by the ARRB.

Junderstand that the Board believes that the process of it coming to CIA to review the records may not be working well. It may then be
arguing that it cannot adequately perform its function of reviewing unless it has the records. Unfortunately, if the Agency disagrees for
security reasons, there is no arbiter set forth in the Act.

‘On the second issue, the JFK Act is clear. The Board does not transfer records to NARA. The powers of the Board are set forth in
section 7() of the Act. In that section, the Board has the power to “direct Government offices to transmit to the Archivist assassination
records as required under this Act...” Further, Section 9(c), which discusses determinations of the Board provides that "(1) The Review
Board shall direct that all assassination records be transmitted to the Archivist and disclosed to the public in the Collection in the absence
of clear and convincing evidence that ..." Section 5{e) of the JFK Act provides the actual responsibility to transfer records to NARA to the
originating agencies, not to the ARRB.

Section 7(i) sets forth the duties of the Review Board and it does not list the transfer of assassination records to NARA. Its duties are
only to render decisions whether records are assassination records under the Act, and whether information in an assassination record
qualifies for postponement under the Act.

Thus, if the ARRB is arguing that it must take custody of the original records in order to meet its duty to transfer those records to NARA

itis wrong. The statute clearly contemplates that the records remain with the originating agency in normal circumstances and only that
the ARRB can direct its transfer once it has ruled on postponements.

‘SUPPLEMCNTARY INFORMATION:

Background and Statutory Authority

The President John F. Kennedy

Kennedy As wstion Records
Collection UFK Assassination Records

Records Administration (NARA). In
establishing a process fur public
disclosure of all records relating to the
assassination, Congress crnated an
independant Federal eganc y, the
Assassination Records Review Board,
that consists af five citizens appuinted
by tho President and confirmed by thy
Sonate in 1494. Under the JFK Act, thy
Roview Hoard is unipowotad to decide
“whether a record constitutes an
assassination record “44 U S.C
2107.7(i)(Z)(A). Congress intended that
the Raview Board “iss lance to
assist in articulating the scope or
universe af assassination records.”

with that mandate.

The Review Board's goal in issuing
this guidance 1s to implement
congressional mtent that the JFK

comprehensive disclosurewf records -
related to the assassinetion of Prasidant
Kennedy.” S. Rep. 102-328,

anstruction that the Board.apply 3
“broad and encompassing” working
definition of “assassination record” in
order to achiove the goal of assembling
the fullest historical record on this
tragic eventin Aruerican history and on
the investigations that were undertaken,
in the assassination’s ahermath. The
Board recognizas that many ayencies
began to urpanizu and review records
fesponsive to the JFK Act even before
the Board was appointed and began its
work. Nevertheless. the Board's aim 1s

that this guidance will aid in the

of the fullest possible historical record
on this tregedy and on subsequent
investigations and ies into it.

‘The final interpretive regulations are

Notice and Comment Process

‘Tbe Keview Board sought public
comment on its proposed interpretive
segulatious and set a thirty-day period,
which ended on March 10, 1995, for the
purpose of receiving written comments.
The Keview Board also heard testimony
at public hearings on aspects of the
proposed interpreuve regulations. In
addition, the Review Board sent copies
of the proposed inierp: regulations
to agencies kinuwn to have an interest in
and tu be affacted by the Review Board's
work, partcularly thoso that either
Created or now hold assassination
records, and to the appropasate oversight
committees in Congress The Review
Board also sent notices of the proposed
intucpretive regulations and request for
comments to many organizations and
individuals who have denunstiated an
interest in the release of maturials under
the JFK Act ur who have engaged in
research into the assassination of
President Kennedy.

The Keview Board recuwed written
comments on the propused «nterpretive
regulations from four Federal aysncies,
thee state and Joval yovernment
enhties, and twenty-one private
individuals and organizations with an
interest in the Review Board's work.
Federal agencies providing writin
comments include the Fyderal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI), the Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA). NARA, and
the Department of State State or local
government entities providing written
Counts include the Dallas (fexas) *

and the City of Dallas Recurds
Management Division of the Office of
the Caty Secratary.

Prior to publication of the proposed
anterpretva regulations, the Review
Board heard testimony at a public
hearing beld at the Review Hoard’s

offices on Decembur 14, 1994, froin
representatives af NARA on the
question of including artifacts in the
scope of the term “assassination
record." After publicatiun of the
proposed interpretive regulations and
bufore expiration of the comment
period, the Review Board heard
testimony ate public hearing on March
7, 1995, from the FBI end from several
individuals and representatives of
prvate organizations on their views
fegarding the taxa of the propased

Jod to the assascinstion of Prosidunt

Response’ A nunber of commentators
put forward citicisins along these lines.
Same of these commentators suggested
that same form of a “reasonably related”
stondand bo substituted for the “nay
have led to” language, while others
suggested alternative formulations (eg.
“that may shed light on the
assassination"). Ln adapung and
eventually applying a “reasonably
related” standard, the Review Board
does nut seok to endorse or reject any
particular theory of the assassination of
President Kennedy, although such
theories may inform (he Review Baard’s
soarch for records reasonably related to
tho assassination and investigatious into
it. The Keview Board beluvus that
§ 1400.1(a), as now warded, advances
that elfart and will promote a consistent
broad interpretation and
iunplemeutation of the JFK Act.

mment: The proposed language of
§ 1400.1(a) is tuo broad snd open-ended.
A mov specific nexus to tho
assassination of Prusidont Kennedy
should be required.

Response. As {ts text and legislative
history make clear, the JFK Act
conturnplates that the Review Board
extend its search for relevant records
beyond what has buen compiled or
roviowod by previous investigations. It
is inuvituble. thorefore, that the Renew
Board oust exercise judgment in
determining whether such records
‘assassination records.” The
Review Board regarde its “reasonably
related” standard a: sufficient to ensure
that agencies are not overburdened with
identifying and reviewing records that,
af addud to the JFK Assassinations
kecords Collection, wuuld not advance
the purposes of the JFK Act.

Conuncat: Svcuon 1400.1 should
specifically include as assassination
rocurds any records pertaining to
particularly identified individuals,
organizttons, events, ete.

lesponse: The Review Board
doiermined that, in almost every case.
the types uf records commentators
sought to odd were already adequately
covered by § 1400.1 as proposed.
Accordingly. the Review Board declined
to include records or record groups et
the luvol of specilicity urged by these
commontatars because doing fo right
limnit the scopy of tho Interpret
regulations as applied initially by other
agenctys, or otherwise might prove
duplicative or confusing Howsver. the
Review Boani welcarnes and encourages
suggestiuns frum the public as to
specific records or record groups that
may constitute assassination records,
and intends to pursue such leads,

including those provided in thy written
communts to the proposed interpretive
regulatiuns

Comment: Section 1406.2(a) is vague
and ovarly broad in describing the scupe
of additional records and informatiun

Nesponse: The Review Buard has
added languaye to clarify that the
purpose of requesting additonal records
and information under §1400.2(e) is to
identify, evaluaty, or mtorpret
assassination records, uicluding
aseassination records that may not
initially have been identified as such by
an agency The Review Hoard also has
addod language to indicate that it
inteuds tu unplement this section
through written requests signed by its
Executive Director. The Review Boand
contemplates that, with rogard to such

requests, its staff will work closely with ©

entities to which such requests are

addressed to implement the JFK Act

vffoctively and efficiently.

‘Comment. The scope of addational
rocords ond information should
specifically include records and
information that:

—describe agoncies’ methods of
svarching for records:

—describe reclassification, trausfer,
destruction, ar uther disposition of
records; or

—do not constitute assassination
records, but have the potential to.
enhance, enrich, and liueden the
historical record of the assa tion:
Response: To the eatent that the

inclusion of records and information of

tho types described would assist the

Review Board in meeting its

respunsibilities under the JFK Act, the

Review Board has adapted the suggested

an tecards” under § 1400.1
and “additional records and

information” under § 1400.2 should not ~

extend to state and.Jocal govurnmunt or
to privete records that ara not in the
possession of the Federal xovernment.

Response: The Review Board
considered such comments caretully.
but concluded that the terms of the JFK
Act preclude the narrower reading a
the Review Bourd’s respunsibilities
urged by such comments. Section
1400.6 allows the Review Board, in its
discretion, to accept cupies in hyu of
otignals The Review Board believes
that this Hleaibility addresses the
concerns of sume commentators about
the removal uf original records already
housed. for exampla, an stata or local
archives

Comment: Section 1400.3 should
include as sources of assassinauan
records and additions! records and

‘remain in the JFK Ass.

information individuals and
corporations that possess such aaterial
vvwn af not obtained from courcus
identified in paragraphs (a) through (6)
thereof, and should specifically wclude
individuals and corporations that
cuntracted lo provide goods or services
to the government.

Response: The Review Board has
added paragraph (0 to this section in
response to thuco comments. The
Review Board hus coucluded that, in
viaw of patograph (, specifically
identifying government conuactors or
other private persans would be
unnecessary end redundant.

Comment. NARA contended that -

§ 1400.4 should not includy artifacts
among the types of materials included
an the term “record.”* Trwating artifacts
as “records” would be contrary to
NARA’s accustomed practice and the
usage uf the lenn “records” in ather
areas of Federal records law aud would
result {n substantial practical
difGculties.

Response: The Review Board hus
carofully considered NARA’s objections
to the inclusion of arttfacts as “recards,”
but decided that this inclusion is
nevessary to achieve the purposes of the
JFK Act. Tha Review Board notes that
artifacts that bocame exhibits to the
proceedings of the Warren Coinnusston
have lang twen in the custady uf NAKA,
and decided that these artifacts shuuld i

Collection. The Review Hoard further

hyhovos that thé unique issties of public

trust and credibility uf government
Processes that prompted enactment of
the JFK Act require that artifacts be
included within tha JFK Assassination
Records Collectiun. Tho strong support
that commenting members of the public
gave to this position reinforces this
conclusion. The Review Board included
in its proposed regulations, and retained
an § 1400.7(b)-{c) of the final
interpretive regulauons, language
intended to address NARA’s concurs
about potential copying requirements
and preservation issues unique to
artifacts.

Comment: Section 1400.5 should be
modified to allow agencies to withhold
from the JFK Assassination Records.

. Collection material that is not rulated ta

the assassination of President Kennedy,
oven though it appears in 4 record that
cuntains other material that is related to
the wssassinetion of President Kennedy.
Response: It remains the intent of this
section to make clyar to agencies that, 6
a rule, entire racords, and not parts
thereat, are to become part af the JFK
Assassination Records Collection. The
purpose of requiring that records be

greater internal consistency. The Review
Board's intent in this section is to
expruss its strong preference for
including original records in tho JFK

also its understanding that, for a vorioty
of reasons, there muy be situations
where a copy instead of the original of
an assasainatton record may be more
appropmisty for inclusion in the

Comment: Section 1400.6 should be
clarified as ta whether “record cupies”

received regarding the pruposed

For this reason, tho Ruvieww Board
decided to replace tho term “Catalog of

12 December, 1998
Memo for the Record
Subject: JFK Records Review Project and Lessons Learned

The CIA's JFK Collection is made up primarily of
records pulled together for the Warren Commission, House
Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) and the
Assassinations Records Review Board (ARRB). It contains a
significant amount of duplication and non-JFK related
material. The current index is flawed and contains gaps.
Release standards were liberal; basically only source
identities and information, names of agents, employees under
cover, Agency locations and foreign liaison activities were
redacted. There is no evidence in the Collection to indicate
that the Warren Commission conclusions were wrong.

I. Background (1992-1995)

The setting up of the Historical Review Program by DCI
Gates in early 1992 coincided with growing interest in
Congress to require federal agencies to declassify records
related to the assassination of President Kennedy. DCI Gates
decided to start declassification process before Congress
passed legislation:

* testified before Congress on 12 May 1992 about CIA‘s
new openness policy and announced the declassification
of the first folder of Oswald's 201 (also known as the
pre-assassination file).

* six boxes of the Oswald's 201 were reviewed and
transferred to NARA by Oct. 1992.

The John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection
Act of 1992 (JFK Act) was signed 26 October 1992:

* it called for Presidential-appointed Assassination
Records Review Board composed of non-government
individuals;

* established “a presumption of immediate disclosure”

for records relating to the assassination.

For first two years of its existence, ‘the Historical
Review Program focused primarily on the review of JFK
assassination records:

TIONS


* there were two major releases of Agency records (August
°1993 and August 1994)of approximately 227,000 pages;

* joint HRG/DO teams reviewed additional assassination
related collections at National Archives (Warren
Commission), the SSCI (Church Committee and the Ford
Presidential Library (Rockefellow Commission) plus
numerous referrals from other federal agencies (FBI,
State, Army, etc.).

Due to delays in the appointment of its members and the
time required to hire and clear a staff, the ARRB did not
actually begin reviewing documents until May 1995. It became
clear in immediately that the ARRB would require the release
of far more information than the: Agency had released in the
1992-94 review. In mid-1995 HRG began a re-review of the
previously released sanitized documents:

* approximately 80% of the 227, 000 pages release in
1993-94 contained deletions

* resources were taken from other projects and added
to JFK project to meet Board's monthly deadlines.

II. The JFK Act and the ARRB

Mandated review and declassification projects can be
two-edged swords. The JFK Act forced the Agency to review
records that should have been opened years ago. The legal
requirement to presume release, backed up by an independent
review, resulted in the opening of documents that clearly
would not have been released under other programs. However,
the Act and the Review Board created by the Act imposed un-
realistic deadlines, inflexible standards and procedures
which created a major drain on all Agency review resources
and had an over-all negative effect on the Agency's release
program.

Unrealistic Deadlines: The release dates set by the
Act did not take into account the start-up time and costs
(searches, inventorying and indexing) of a project of this
magnitude, nor the time it would then take for a page-by-
page review and sanitization of classified documents. For
example, initial indexing of the collection was done on a
‘crash basis using overtime employees and resulted in a
flawed database. The revising, re-indexing and updating of
that database took several thousand man-hours and continues
today.

Mandated Procedures: NARA's and ARRB's interpretation
of the law created a time-consuming, labor-intensive review
process that meant an inordinate amount of time was spent by


both the Agency and Board staff on issues which were
marginal to the story and to processing decisions by the
Board. For example:

a. Under the JFK Act every piece of paper in the
collection was considered a “unique” assassination record.
The result is a staggering amount of chaff and duplication.
For example, one cable was files and processed 58 times in
the collection.

b. The ARRB required that all sanitized documents be
reviewed by the Board and that each postponement (deletion)
be acted on individually. Even after the Board changed
procedures and accepted staff recommendations instead of
reviewing each document, the detailed tracking, recording
and coding of every deletion within each document required
processing resources well beyond what would be considered
reasonable for such a project. A most sanitized documents
contained multiple deletions (one contained more than 1600
deletions and many over 100).

Inflexible Standards: The level of evidence required
by the Board to postpone what was generally considered
protectable information was extremely high and usually
required documentation of “current harm”. Defenses based on
general principles such as official cover or sources and
methods were not acceptable. This required the Agency to
dedicate significant resources to prepare evidence to
support recommended postponements. Again, much time was
spent on issues that were marginal to the JFK story. For
example, several major evidence packages involving several
offices and presentations by senior agency officers and
officials were needed to secure Board agreement to protect
Agency physical locations and names of employees and other
persons not related to the JFK story.

Three times during the six years of the project, including
most of this past year, the JFK review effectively shut down
all other aspects of the Historical Review Program and had
to borrow additional resources from other offices and review
projects to meet deadlines. The JFK review will continue to
require a significant portion of HRP's resources through
FY99.

III. The Process and Lessons Learned

There are a number of basic lessons from the JFK review
that are applicable to other historical/systematic review
projects:

ied We need reviewers with broad Agency experience, which
can be either managerial or substantive.


* We need to establish early on what information is
already in the public domain and address the issue of
“official release” in the context of each project.

* Develop a strategy/policy with the IROs concerning the
release of information. Be smart about it; do not accept
stonewalling by them on relevant information that can be
released. At the same time, avoid confrontations with them
on marginal or non-relevant information.

bs On-site Directorate reviewers are the most effective
way to handle the internal coordination requirements of a
large project. Without the DO's JFK team on site it would
have been impossible to complete the JFK project.

* Develop guidelines and processes for coordinating Third
Agency documents; include other agencies in discussions; do
not drop documents into the black hole of other agencies’
FOIA offices without this advance discussion.

* Maintain written, up-to-date, project-specific
declassification guidelines. This is no small task. A
“declassification guide” must be flexible; no guide can
anticipate all the issues which will arise in a review.
After six years, we were still revising the JFK guidelines
in the last month of the project.

* In establishing deadlines, allow sufficient time to do

a thorough, professional job as required by the project

activities (see Unrealistic Deadlines above).

* Ensure we have adequate support people for routine

processing tasks; declassification involves both tough

substantive analysis--and a lot of routine processing.

* If possible, inventory/index all materials before the

review and processing begins. Experienced indexers are a

must. Identification of duplicate documents should be a key

part of any inventory or index.

3. How a Request was Worked Following receipt of a
request and HRP tasking the responsible Agency component (s)
to conduct a search, the materials found were first reviewed
by HRP staff members before access was provided to the ARRB
staff. ARRB staff then reviewed the documents and materials
and identified those which it believed were relevant to
their inquiry and these materials were placed in the normal
queue to be reviewed and processed for release. However,
the mere identification of materials did not equate to
automatic release. Rather, if particularly sensitive
information was involved, negotiations took place and, on
occasion, a written statement about the materials was
provided for release vice the actual document(s).

4H. The Agency’s written responses to each request -

" either a letter or memoranda - included, of course, the fact
the materials designated were to be processed for release
according to then current guidelines. The ARRB staff then
wrote its own version of the request, search, and response.
Both of these are a part of the public record on this
project.

Se. Lessons learned: A number of things surfaced as
HRP worked to complete these requests which required
considerable explanation, negotiation, and resolution.

a. First among these was the fact there existed an
outside Board which asked for information and carefully
monitored the responses (a very powerful external Board with
subpoena authority), without doubt caused documents and
information to be found and made available that would not
have been provided to an internal declassification project.

b. Second, for any large project such as JFK to be
successful, there is an absolute requirement that each
directorate and independent office identify two responsible
persons -- a senior management official who can ensure that

deadlines (particularly deadlines established by an external


authority) are met; and, a senior focal point officer, who
has the substantive knowledge and background to both" locate
all relevant material and make decisions on its sensitivity.

c. Third, the individuals identified and appointed
in sub-paragraph “b” next above must be fully versed in the
guidelines which pertain to each specific project. They
cannot rely on FOIA or other guidelines as to the depth of
their searches or the conditions governing release/
redaction/denial of materials.

DRAFT: Section 21, ARRB Requests for Additional
Information and Records

1. Unlike most declassification projects, the Agency’s
involvement in the JFK Project was governed by the dictates
of a Federal statute, the JFK Act, and the powers it vested
in the Board it established -- the Assassination Records
Review Board (ARRB). In particular, under Section 7, the
Act armed the ARRB with the authority to dig for records and
information, specifically:

...(1) The Review Board shall have the authority
to act in a manner prescribed under this Act, in-
cluding authority to --

* * *

(C) (ii) direct a Government office to make
available to the Review Board, and if necessary
investigate the facts surrounding, additional
information, records, or testimony from
individuals, which the Review Board has reason
to believe is required to fulfill its functions
and responsibilities;

* * *
(F) hold hearings, administer oaths, and subpoena
witnesses and documents.

This substantial authority provided the’ARRB and its staff
with almost unlimited access to Agency records and
personnel. It also was the basis for a number of specific
requests from the Board to the Agency for additional
information, document searches and explanatory papers. HRP
designated this ARRB activity, “Special Requests.” During
its existence the ARRB sent to the Agency fifty-three
special requests, CIA 1-16 and CIA-IR fone

2. Categories of Requests: we


Although each request had unique characteristics,
all began as a request by the Board or an ARRB staff member
on behalf of the board for information. The requests fell
generally into five broad categories as follows:

a. Requests for access to basic information which
would help the board understand the CIA, its organizational
structure and how it operated around the time of the
assassination which included: Requests for organizational

charts, briefings, mission statements, etc.; review of over
__. histories of CIA offices and projects; a review of the
so-called “Breckinridge files;” and, a search for an IG
index of Oswald reports.

b. Requests about methodologies which included: How
cable traffic was handled at HQ during the relevant time
period; the existence and use of the inter-agency source
registry; and, the assignment and use of alias’s pseudonyms,
crypts, etc.

c. Requests for subject specific matters which
included: The Mexico City Station annual reports; the
existence of DRE monthly reports; Oswald's pre assassination
files; and, a search for any documents or information
detailing the Agency’s involvement in transporting and
processing the Zapruder film.

d. Requests for project specific information and
files, which included: Requests for information and files on
AMWORLD, QKENCHANT, an index to the HTLINGUAL materials, and
the Mexico City electronic surveillance tapes.

e. Requests for individual specific information
and files, which included both CIA and CIA associated
individuals and non-CIA individuals: Information on
individuals with JMWORLD; detailed information on Sylvia
Duran; a determination of the identify of a particular
“George Bush;” and, the files on William Pawley.

Oswald Files

Pre-assassination file” 201 file -approximately 40 documents that existed at the time of
the assassination. Released in 1992 with minimal deletions.

DO 201 File (Approximately 25,000 pages): Agency's primary file for documents dealing
with the assassination or mentioning Oswald; the file is still active. Contains pre-
assassination documents; materials collected after the assassination and during the
Warren Commission investigation; Mexico City files, Garrison investigation materials
plus other documents related to the assassination or Oswald received over the years. A
microfilm copy of file as it existed in 1978, was sequestered by the House Select
Committee on Assassination (HSCA).

The DO's original (record copy) 201 was transferred to HRG in early 1992; a
declassified version was released in August 1993; it was re-released with fewer
deletions in 1996 under the authority of the ARRB . Additional documents, filed into the
201 after the its transfer to HRG, were released in September 1998.

Office of Security File (__pages): Contained key Oswald documents, FBI investigative

reports, newspaper clipping. This file, primarily duplicative, was reviewed by the HSCA,
but a copy was not sequestered with the rest of the Agency's “JFK” collection. The file

surfaced as a result of an ARRB request in 1997. A declassified version of the file was
released in 1998.

DCD ‘A’ File: A microfilm copy of this file was in the sequestered collection. The ARRB
requested that the original file by reviewed for release.

Marina Oswald's 201 file. A copy of this file was in the sequestered collection. The
ARRB requested that the original file be reviewed for release.

The ARRB directed that the classified originals of all documents from the Oswald files
be transferred to NARA for secure storage. These documents were transferred to
NARA in October 1998.

The Sequestered Collection

At the end of its investigation, the HSCA directed that all materials (files,
documents, memos, notes, tapes, etc.) collected or prepared in response to its
investigation be sequestered. This included files made available for review, but not
reviewed by the HSCA staff.

JFK boxes 1-63 (hardcopy): These boxes are the core of the Agency's JFK collection.
They are the working files/materials of the HSCA staff and reflects the wide range of

~ issues pursued by the Committee. In addition to Agency documents, they include
approximately 30,000 pages of notes, letter and memos created by the HSCA or its
staff. The boxes are a combination of files on subjects and persons of interest to HSCA
including documents prepared by the Agency as a result of the investigation, eight
boxes of security files and Mexico City cable chrono files. The boxes contain a
significant amount of duplication (most of the Oswald 201 documents appear multiple


times in this part of the collection. A declassified version was released in August 1993,
then re-released under ARRB in 1997.

JEK Microfilm (72 reels): These reels are copies of Agency files that were made
available to HSCA staff. Although the HSCA interest usually focused on a small portion
of a file, the Committee sequestered the compete file. The microfilm includes
approximately 25 reels of 201 files, 6 reels of Office of Personnel files, 14 reels of
Anti/Castro - Cuban exile material, extensive files on Nosenko and operational and
production files from Mexico City. The microfilm also contains copies of all the Oswald
files except for the security file.

SUBCOMMITTEE OF THE HOUSE GOVERNMENT REFORM AND
OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE

SUBJECT: ASSASSINATIONS RECORDS REVIEW BOARD REAUTHORIZATION
CHAIRED BY REPRESENTATIVE DENNIS HASTERT (R-IL)

2154 RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING

WASHINGTON, DC

BODY:

REP. HASTERT: The Subcommittee on National Security, International Affairs and
Criminal Justice will come to order. This hearing will focus on a very

important piece of legislation, HR 1553, the John F. Kennedy Assassination

Records Review Board Reauthorization Act. This bill was introduced by Chairman
Dan Burton on May 8, 1997 and included in original cosponsors ranking minority
member Henry Waxman and Congressman Louis Stokes, our first witness for today,
also who chaired the House Select Committee on Assassinations.

In 1992, 30 years after the assassination, nearly one million pages of records
compiled by official investigations still had been not made public. Congress
decided to set up a process for reviewing and releasing to the public the

records surrounding the Kennedy assassination. The result was that on October
26, 1992, President Bush signed into law Public Law 102-526, the President John

F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992.

The original act provided a three-year timetable for the review board to

complete its work. Unfortunately, extensive delays in the appointment of board
members delayed the review board's work from the very beginning. In 1994, the
Congress extended the 1992 law's termination date for one year, until September
30th, 1996. The review board subsequently exercised its authority into the

statute to continue operating for one additional year.

The review process has proved to be more complex and time- consuming than


ip anticipated. And although we believe that Congress should not indefinitely
continue funding federal entities that were intended to be temporary, Chairman
Burton and this subcommittee support the request for a one-year extension of the
board's reauthorization. I believe that by releasing these documents to the

public we serve an important public right to know and advance the cause of total
accountability to the people of this country.

At this time I would like to recognize the gentleman from Wisconsin, Mr.

Barrett.

REP. THOMAS M. BARRETT (D-WI): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm honored to
welcome

my esteemed colleague, Representative Louis Stokes, to testify before this
subcommittee. We are fortunate to be able to draw on your experience in this
area.

Over 30 years ago this country was shocked by the assassination of President
Kennedy ina way that it had not been shocked since the bombing of Pearl Harbor
or the bombing or Hiroshima. Yet today we are still prying papers out of the !
government about that assassination.


PAGE 17
Federal News Service, JUNE 4, 1997 =

The legislation that created the Assassination Review Board broke new ground by
establishing the principle that there should be a presumption of public access

to government information. That legislation was necessary because
administration after administration had failed to release documents. That

should not be. The Assassination Review Board has released millions of pages
that could have otherwise remained locked in government file drawers. We are
here today to extend the authorization of this board because the process of
making government information public has been more complex and time-consuming,
than anticipated. I am not criticizing the work of the board or the dedication

of its members. I am, however, critical of the fact that we are still fighting

with our government to allow public access to government documents.

Congress has passed laws and resolutions reiterating the principles of public
access that were laid down when this country was founded. Administration after
administration has worked to thwart that access. I applaud President Clinton

for his efforts to declassify xdocuments, but we need to do much more.

I hope that every employee at the Office of Management and Budget, and every
agency in the government will pay attention to what this board has accomplished.
It is the refusal to allow public access that breeds suspicion of the

government. It is the thwarting of public access that causes the public to

mistrust government officials. If we are to turn the tide of mistrust and

suspicion, it will be done by opening the doors of access. Today is one step in

that process, but there is much more work to be done.

Thank you.

REP. HASTERT: Are there any other members wishing to make an opening statement?
If not, our first witness this morning is fellow Congressman Lou Stokes, who
served as the chairman of the Héuse Select Committee on Assassinations from 1976
to 1979, and is a cosponsor of this important bill.

And, Mr. Stokes, we want to say welcome, and thank you for your fine work in
this area. And please proceed with your opening statement.

REP. LOUIS STOKES (D-OH): Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Barrett, Mr.
Turner, Mr. LaTourette.

Mr. Chairman, I'd like to submit my written testimony for the record, and if I
may, I'd like to just summarize my testimony. :

REP. HASTERT: Without objection.

REP. STOKES: Thank you.

It seems, Mr. Chairman, it was not as long as it is, but actually it's been 20

years; it was in 1977 when I was appointed as chairman of the House Select
Committee on Assassinations. We were authorized at that time and directed to
complete an investigation surrounding the assassination and the death of
President John F. Kennedy. We completed, as you've already stated, our


investigation in 1979, And on March 28th of that year, we filed our final

report. In addition to it, 12 volumes of evidentiary material, printed by the
Government Printing Office, was made available to the American public. In
addition to this, we conducted 18 days of public hearings and an additional two
days of public policy hearings.

Prior to the committee running out of both time and money, we had released
everything that we had the time and resources to release. All of our other
records were placed in the National Archives, under a House of Representatives
rule which existed at that time, Rule 36, requiring such unpublished records
routinely to be sealed for 30 to 50 years. The records of our committee

relative to this investigation consisted of 935 boxes, which we turned over to
the National Archives. Then, over the years, a considerable public debate about
these records has ensued, including accusations that these records, if released,
would contain evidence of a government cover-up, or complicity of government
agencies in the assassination of President Kennedy.

PAGE 18
Federal News Service, JUNE 4, 1997

A great deal of this was fueled in 1992 by a movie entitled "JFK." That movie
contained many distortions of the facts and circumstances surrounding the death
of our president. As a result of that movie, my office was deluged with
thousands of letters and telegrams by Americans calling for the release of these
sealed files.

As a member of Congress, and a former chairman of that committee, I deemed it
important not to have the good work of our committee impugned by such baseless
accusations. Our committee had attempted to conduct its investigation into the
assassination of the president, and to present the results of that investigation

to the Congress and to the American people in a thorough and dignified manner in
keeping with the memory of this great president.

Consequently, in 1992, I introduced, and the House and Senate passed, PL
102-526, a bill entitled The President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records
Collection Act of 1992. That law created the Assassination Records Review
Board, which mandated and authorized that board to identify, secure, and make
available all records related to the assassination of President Kennedy. It was

our intention, Mr. Chairman, that everything that could be released from every
agency, every court record, anywhere they existed -- that those records be
released to the American people.

Under the law, the board had until October 1, 1996, to fulfill its mandate, plus

an additional year, at the board's discretion.

We were very fortunate to have a very distinguished panel appointed. This panel -
was appointed by President Clinton 18 months after the law was enacted here by
the Congress — a considerable delay in the appointment of this panel. But we
were very fortunate to have persons such as Chairman Tunheim, Dr. Henry Graff,
Dr. Kermit Hall, Dr. William Joyte, Dr. Anna Nelson, and an outstanding
executive director, David Marwell.

Under this panel, they have now released more than 10,000 previously secret
government documents.

They have released a report, which I would urge all the members of the committee
to read, if they have an opportunity, because I think you will see the extensive
amount of work in which they have been involved.

They now need one additional final year in order to complete their work. Their
work during this period of time will be primarily to secure the release of
documents from the CIA and the FBI. Those are the two main agencies left from
which they still have a considerable number of documents to be released.

Mr. Chairman, in closing I think that it's important that we complete this work

in an orderly manner with full and complete disclosure to the American people,
that they will feel that they know everything that their government knows about


the assassination of their president. And I would urge the support and passage
of this legislation sponsored by Chairman Burton, of which I am one of the _
original co-sponsors.

T'd be pleased to answer any questions.

REP. HASTERT: Thank you, Chairman - or, Mr. Stokes. And I really appreciate
the work that you've done here. I have just two brief questions. Actually,

three. Do you believe that the Ford Review Board is up and running smoothly
now?

REP. STOKES: Absolutely. In spite of the delay of 18 months they have done just
a yeoman’'s amount of work. It's just been almost incomparable to realize how
much they have done. And to their credit, they feel that if given just this one
additional year that they will complete the work.

REP. HASTERT: And do you believe that this process is consistent with the goals
of your original legislation in 1992?

REP. STOKES: Yes, I do, Mr. Chairman.


PAGE 19
Federal News Service, JUNE 4, 1997

REP. HASTERT: And then you are confident, as you said before, that the review
board can finish its task by September 30th, 1998.
REP. STOKES: I am just very confident that — in projecting the fact that they... .

can do this work with one year. And when they say themselves as they will say a4

to you when they appear, this'll be one final year.

REP. HASTERT: Thank you very much, and thank you for your testimony.

REP. STOKES: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

REP. HASTERT: The gentleman from Wisconsin.

REP. BARRETT: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

I don't have a lot of questions, either. I just want to compliment you,
Congressman Stokes, for the fine job that you have done.

REP. STOKES: Thank you.

REP. BARRETT: And just one question. Do you think in the unfortunate and
hopefully unlikely scenario that there are future assassinations in the future

that this was a good way to approach this problem, the panel that you served?
Do you think that you have accomplished what you intended. to accomplish?
REP. STOKES: Mr. Barrett, at the time that we undertook this panel and Congress
passed the act to create this panel, 85 percent of the American people believed
that someone other than Lee Harvey Oswald had participated in the assassination
of President Kennedy. A national poll had told us that. There were boundless
rumors and myths. People were writing numerous books and things of that sort.
And as a consequence of it, I think that putting this panel together and
permitting this type of investigation I think was very helpful. I think it

allayed many of the rumors and myths that grew up and abounded around the
assassination of our president.

However, I don't think that it put to bed everything. We uncovered many things.
For instance, we pointed up many of the things that the Warren Commission had
not done properly. And we were able to destroy many of the myths, such as the
umbrella man theory and things of that sort. But we couldn't put everything to
bed. We had begun that investigation 15 years after the assassination of the
president. I think had we been given this type of investigation immediately

after it had occurred, it would have been a different result. But many of the
witnesses had died. Evidence had disappeared. As you can see now, there were
materials which we were not able to get even within that two-year period before
we went out of existence.

And so as a consequence of it, I think we did an outstanding job. No one has

ever been able to refute any of the work that we did. No one has been able thus
far to say anything was ever covered up from the American people. And so to
that degree, I think that it performed a good service for the American people.


REP. HASTERT: Okay, thank you very much.

The gentleman from Ohio.

REP. STEVEN LATOURETTE (R-OH): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman,I ,
want to

thank you for having this hearing today and for also expediting the markup on

1553, and give praise to the co- sponsors, our chairman, Mr. Burton, Mr. Waxman,
and also to Congressman Stokes.

The editorial comment I would make is I'm always amazed each succeeding day that
I serve in Congress at the rich history that a number of our colleagues have,

and to now have our fine colleague from Ohio, Congressman Stokes from Cleveland,
here and talk about his previous work on the House Select Committee on
Assassinations. Although many members in the House remember his service, I would
venture to say there are a number of people back home that don't know all of the
things that you've done during your many years of service to this Congress and

this country. .

Just as an example, the other day I found out — and I don't know if you're a


PAGE 20
Federal News Service, JUNE 4, 1997

lawyer or not, Mr. Chairman, but I found out that Congressman Stokes — well,
you're lucky you're not a lawyer, but I am, and I'm proud to be a lawyer.

I found out that Congressman Stokes was responsible for a ruling called Terry ee
versus Ohio, and you might have heard of a “Terry Frisk and Search," and I

didn’t know that till the other day, that Congressman Stokes had a hand in that,
and so, again, we find Congressman Stokes showing up again, sharing his
expertise with the country.

Lou, the one question I would have, deals with, in both your written testimony,
and then also your observations to Congressman Baird's question. You talked
about the "JFK" movie, and all of the rumors and innuendoes and the public

polls. And you still run into people — as I'm sure — I still run into people

that aren't convinced that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone on that November day in
Dallas.

And part of it has to do, I think, with, after your commission met, and now the
legislation in '92, and a little delay in getting everybody in place in the

teview board. Do you think it was necessary, after you've reviewed the

documents in this case, that we waited, as a government, 34 years to make these
documents available? Was there something impinging upon the national security
that you found or discovered that made it necessary for the government to wait

34 full years before releasing this information, and hopefully dispelling some

of those rumors?

REP. STOKES: Thank you very much, Mr. LaTourette, firstly for your nice remarks.
But it's a good question, because not many people realize that this was not ~

when we sealed these records for the period 30 to 50 years, this was not done
because of anything relative to this particular investigation. That was a House

tule in existence at that time, that applied to any committee that, when it

completed its work and filed its final report, if they had documents which had

not been released publicly, under that House rule, they had to be sealed for 30

to 50 years. The same applied to the other part of that investigation which we
conducted, which was to investigate the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King
Jr., which was a companion part of our investigation. So that applied to that

one also.

But as a result of it, in compliance with the House rule, it just sort of sat

there until things were stirred up by that "JFK" movie and it sort of brought

things to the head.

REP. LATOURETTE: Okay. The principles behind your '92 legislation, the
Assassination Records Collection Act -- obviously, now we collect records
differently than we did before. A lot of them are electronically stored. Do

you think that we can use that act as a vehicle, should another tragedy - God
forbid we should ever have such another tragedy in this country, but should


another tragedy such as this occur, could we use the lessons learned in the
model of this review board to prevent the significant time lag between the date
of event and the eventual release of documents for public review?

REP. STOKES: I would hope, Mr. LaTourette, that we have learned some lessons.
Firstly, here in the Congress we'd no longer have such a rule in effect, and

that will help us, I think, tremendously.

But also, I think, by the agencies now working with a review panel of this sort
and realizing that many of the type of documents which they will cite to you in
their testimony — for instance, there's a very interesting document that they
will talk about, where the whole page, with the exception of just the date and
the name of a country — everything was redacted. And under their work, that
whole page has been released, and everyone can read that.

What you do by that is that you're to allay all the suspicion as to what really
has been redacted and people can really see. And then you can't have the kind
of rumors and myths that grow up around it.


PAGE 21
Federal News Service, JUNE 4, 1997

And I think and hope that in the event of such an occurrence in the future —

which all of us hope would never occur — that our agencies will realize that

this has been a good example of how we could allay some of the fears and

suspicions that the American people have around the manner in which we conduct
this type of thing.

REP. LATOURETTE: Thank you very much, Congressman Stokes, for your expertise --
REP. STOKES: Thank you.

REP. LATOURETTE: — and thank you, Mr. Chairman, for yielding.

REP. HASTERT: Thank you.

And at this time I recognize the gentleman from Texas.

REP. JIM TURNER (D-TX): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

And all I would add is to also compliment you, Mr. Stokes, for your many years
of work on this effort. I too stand somewhat in awe at the number of years of
service and your contributions to this body.

REP. STOKES: Thank you.

REP. TURNER: And I know the Congress and the American people are grateful for
the years of service you've provided not only on this issue, but on many other
issues to which you've contributed. i

And I also want to thank those who've served on this panel, because I'm sure it
is a time-consuming endeavor to carry out this task.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

REP. HASTERT: Thank you, Mr. Turner.

Thank you, Mr. Stokes. ;

REP. STOKES: Thank you. i

REP. HASTERT: The second panel, come forward, please.

Our distinguished second panel includes four witnesses: Mr. John Tunheim, the
chair of the Assassination Records Review Board; Mr. Steven Tilley, the chief of
the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection at the National Archives.
We also have Mr. Max Holland, the author and contributing editor of the Wilson
Quarterly; and Mr. Bruce Hitchcock, an historian and teacher at Noblesville High
School in Indiana, our distinguished chairman's home state.

And [also would say that, at this time, Mr. Burton would have wanted to be here
to make a few comments. He is not here yet. We may entertain that at any time.
So, if you gentlemen would please stand, and -- (witnesses are sworn in). Thank
you. Let the record show that the witnesses answered in the affirmative.

And we start with you, Mr. Tunheim.

JOHN TUNHEIM (Chair, Assassination Records Review Board): Thank you, Mr.
Chairman. I, too, would like to submit my written testimony for the record and


just give a brief summary to members of the subcommittee today.

Td like to thank the subcommittee for this opportunity to testify today in

favor of House bill 1553. And I'd also like to note our thanks to Congressman
Stokes for his leadership on this issue and his guidance in the important effort

to release the records relating to the tragic assassination of President

Kennedy.

The review board is confident that the additional time requested and provided by
Congressman Burton's bill will allow us to complete our work and submit a truly
complete final report to the Congress, to the president and to the American
public. I'd like to thank Chairman Burton for introducing the bill and
Congressman Waxman and Stokes for co-sponsoring the bill that is before the
subcommittee today. And I also appreciate, Mr. Chairman, your role in chairing
this hearing today and assisting in this effort.

One of the other members of the review board is present with us today —I'd

like to introduce her -- Dr. Anna Nelson, who is the distinguished adjunct


PAGE 22
Federal News Service, JUNE 4, 1997

historian in residence at the American University and is seated in the row
directly behind me. Dr. David Marwell, the executive director of the review
board,:is also here, as are a number of staff members who.are very professional
and very dedicated and have done their work for us very well.

The review board, Mr. Chairman, began releasing records in July of 1995,
pursuant to the act passed by Congress. And thus far, the board has acted
specifically to transfer more than 14,000 documents to the JFK collection at the
National Archives. That collection, as Mr. Tilley will tell the subcommittee
shortly, now contains more than 3.7 million pages' worth of material.

Td like to show one brief and rather dramatic example of the work that the
review board is doing. Congressman Stokes mentioned this issue in his
testimony. This involves one particular record. This is the "before" version,

the record that was available to the public up until several years ago. You
probably cannot see it from here, but it is a document that was sent from the
FBI's representative in Paris to Director Hoover on October 12, 1960. That is
indicated at the top of the memorandum. The subject, as indicated, is Lee
Harvey Oswald: Internal Security. And then it says Re: Paris Letter 9-27- 60.
And the remainder of the entire document is blacked out. And not surprisingly,
a document like this dated three years prior to the assassination of President _
Kennedy, a document sent to J. Edgar Hoover attracted a great deal of interest
among researchers who saw it because everything was blacked out underneath. The
speculation that individuals had about this was great.

Well, the board aggressively pursued the release of this information, initially
ordering its release. The FBI appealed that decision to the president.
Subsequently we worked out with them, including an aggressive effort to contact
Swiss authorities who were the subject of this particular document. I met
personally with the Swiss ambassador to the United States to ask for his
assistance in obtaining Swiss approval to release it.

And here is the record that is now released to the American public at the
National Archives. All of the material is released. And what it indicates was

the FBI was interested in whether Oswald was indeed attending a college in
Switzerland during that period of time. And the document tells about the
investigation that Swiss authorities did to determine whether Oswald was,
indeed, enrolled. He was someone who the FBI was following because of his
interest in defecting to the Soviet Union. That's a good example of the type of
work that the review board is doing: pursuing individual releases of information
that has long been redacted from the public.

The board has worked closely with federal agencies. The vast majority of the
records are at the CIA and the FBI. We have completed the review of the core
collections in both of those agencies and significant numbers of materials have



been released.

The board has also been aggressive in identifying and acquiring significant
assassination-related records that have been in the hands of private citizens

and local governments. Just a couple of examples:

The papers of J. Lee Rankin, who was the chief counsel to the Warren Commission,
have now been released through the efforts of the review board. Virtually all

of the records of the prosecution in New Orleans of Clay Shaw was also released.
And I'm announcing for the first time today that the review board has just
acquired the original personal papers of Clay Shaw. He was the individual
prosecuted in New Orleans in 1969, the only individual prosecuted for the
assassination of President Kennedy. That will add another dimension to this
story. This is an example of his diary, which the board has just obtained, and
will be released as soon as we can process the materials. It's very

interesting. It's his diary from the day that he was arrested, on March 1st,

1967 and his feelings about Oswald on that particular day.


PAGE 23
Federal News Service, JUNE 4, 1997

Despite the best estimate, Mr. Chairman, that this job could be done in three
years, we cannot finish our work by the end of this fiscal year. We're

confident that in the additional year we will be able to get through the

records, which will largely involve the sequestered collections at the CIA and

at the FBI — records sequestered by the House Select Committee on
Assassinations. I'd be happy to answer any questions, Mr. Chairman, that you
and the members have.

REP. HASTERT: Thank you. We'll hold all the questions until the end of the
testimony.

MR. TUNHEIM: Very well.

REP. HASTERT: Mr. Tilley?

STEVEN TILLEY (Chief, Access and Freedom of Information Staff, National Archives
and Records Administration): Mr. Chairman, I am Steven Tilley, and I'm the chief
of the Access and Freedom of Information Staff at the National Archives and
Records Administration. And I wish to thank you for the opportunity to testify
today on behalf — for the National Archives in support of HR 1553.

I'm appearing today in my capacity of NARA's chief of the President John F.
Kennedy Assassination Records Collection. In that role, I am charged with
implementing NARA's responsibilities under the act, and I serve as NARA's
liaison to the Assassination Records Review Board. And it's my understanding
that my written statement will be made part of the record, therefore, I'll be

brief in my remarks.

Mr. Chairman, this month marks the 20th anniversary of the closing of the office
of the Watergate Special Prosecution Force. I oversaw the closing of that

office and supervised the transfer of those records to the National Archives.
Most of my career at the National Archives since then has been involved with
working with sensitive records. And in 1993, I became the chief of the JFK
Collection, and I've served in that capacity ever since.

When the review board members were confirmed by the Senate in April of 1994, my
staff and I began to work with the board, and later with the board staff, to
provide information on the records in the JFK Collection, the development and
use of NARA's data base, our contacts and discussions with other agencies
involved in searches for assassination records, and the existence of

assassination records in the custody of private repositories or individuals.

The review board and NARA have maintained an excellent working relationship
through the three years of the board's existence, and I'd like to think that

this close relationship has in some way contributed to the success of the review
board.

NARA enthusiastically supports passage of HR 1553 to extend the review board's
authorization.


The board needs the time designated in this bill to complete its important work
in making available as complete a historical record as possible concerning the
assassination of President Kennedy.

I would like to briefly offer for your consideration some statistics and facts

to demonstrate the success of the board. The JFK Assassination Records
Collection has grown to more than 1,600 cubic feet of records, or approximately
3.75 million pages from more than 30 different government offices. These
numbers are a testament to the work of the board in obtaining the cooperation of
the entire federal government as well as private donors in this important task.
For the information of the committee, Mr. Chairman, I've attached to my
testimony a copy of the register of the collection, which lists the major groups
of federal records and private papers along with a supplemental listing of FBI
records.

Not only has the collection increased dramatically in size; the significance


PAGE 24
Federal News Service, JUNE 4, 1997

of the records in the collection cannot be underestimated. In addition to the
records of numerous executive branch agencies and offices, the records of
relevant congressional committees, related court cases, and records donated by
private entities are also available in the collection.

This rich documentation is searchable electronically, giving researchers the
ability to seek out documents concerning a topic, person or event, or even.
individual documents, not only at NARA's College Park facility but from their
own personal computer through the Internet.

Finally, Mr. Chairman, public demand for these records is the ultimate evidence
of the value of this collection. Reference requests have risen in number every
year since the collection opened with new records in August of 1993. This year
we have already received over 600 written inquiries, an increase of over 30 5
percent from this period of time last year. The number of inquiries on our
computer Web site is also steadily increasing. Since March 1996, when the
assassination records database was made available through the Internet, it has
been accessed over 100,000 times by the public.

Due to the exceptional work of the Assassination Records Review Board, great
progress has been made on making available as complete a record as possible in
the history of the assassination of John Kennedy. Without the focus, integrity
and expertise of the review board, the collection would not have the size,
quality or public demand witnessed today.

However, there is still much to do. NARA supports passage of HR 1553 so this

-important work can be completed.

That concludes my statement, Mr. Chairman. I'll be glad to answer any

questions.

REP. HASTERT: Thank the gentleman.

Mr. Holland?

MAX HOLLAND (Author, contributing editor of Wilson Quarterly): Thank you, Mr.
Chairman. I'd like to make a brief statement summarizing my testimony.

Nearly 75 years after President Lincoln's assassination, a chemist-turned-author
named Otto Eisenschiml provoked a national furor with his 1937 book, "Why Was
Lincoln Murdered?" Eisenschiml claimed one of the most important events in
American history was still a mystery. And Eisenschim! claimed to have uncovered
the truth: President Lincoln was the victim of a conspiracy organized by his
secretary of war, Edwin Stanton, who was allegedly opposed to the president's
program for a charitable post-war reconstruction of the South.

When pressed, Otto Eisenschiml openly admitted that he had no evidence to
support his case. At the same time, it was precisely the documentary record

that enabled critics to prove that Eisenschiml's book was just another in a long

line of lunatic theories about the first assassination of an American president.


Here lies, I submit, the long-term importance of the work being carried out by
the AARB. The meaning of the raw data being unearthed by the review board will
probably not be appreciated any time soon by the generations sentient when
President Kennedy was murdered in Dallas, but if these generations cannot come
to terms with history as it happened in their lifetimes, then at the very least,

they have an obligation to hand over, insofar as possible, a complete and
thorough documentary record. Citizens will need that record to rebut the Otto
Eisenschimls of the next century, not that there is any dearth of them now.

I strongly support without qualification extension of the review board for
another year and full funding of its operations. Bringing its work to an abrupt
end would not only diminish the investment of time and resources already made;
in all likelihood, it would throw the whole initiative into chaos. Not least of

all, gutting the effort now would surely create ineradicable suspicion about the
federal government's intentions in the first place. I'd like to spend the

balance of my time describing the three areas where I thank the review board

t

a


PAGE 25
Federal News Service, JUNE 4, 1997 ,

had made its greatest contributions. The first has to do with the Warren
Commission. The review board's labors have resulted in many new documents that
I believe will eventually remove the stigma that has been attached to the
commission, which is probably the most unfairly reviled and/or ridiculed entity
ever created by the federal government.

These records paint a sobering portrait of our federal government during a very
traumatic time. It's not the idealized versions depicted in civics text books

nor the demonized version featured on talk radio. It's the real federal
government: imperfect, plodding, riven by ambition, distrust, rivalries,
compartmentalized by secrecy, working at cross-purposes or in ignorance,
simultaneously guided by the most banal bureaucratic instincts and the most
elevated national concerns. Somehow, through all of that, it does struggle and ‘
manage to do the right thing.

Besides the Warren Commission, I think the work of the review board has made a
very substantial contribution towards understanding the operations of the
intelligence community. The assassination necessarily caused what could only be
termed a mobilization of the U.S. intelligence community's far-flung resources.
The government had to determine that weekend who was responsible and whether the
assassin or assassins had any co-conspirators either foreign or domestic.
Consequently the records being released now constitute a gold mine of
information about domestic and foreign intelligence operations at the midpoint
of the cold war. These records not only shed new light on what the government
knew 34 years ago; the release is an object lesson in why they were kept secret
forall those years. They do not contradict the federal government's official
conclusion at stated in the Warren report. Rather, the documents were kept
secret because they disclosed or tended to disclose ongoing intelligence sources
and methods.

With the release of these documents, the intelligence community's record in the
wake of the assassination can finally be assessed with some fairness and
thoroughness. The fact is that the information provided by the FBI, CIA and
other agencies was instrumental to preventing the United States government from
overreacting when the circumstantial public evidence was highly suggestive of a
link between Lee Harvey Oswald and a foreign power.

The last area in which the review board has made a -- perhaps its greatest
contribution has to do with whole issue of secrecy and disclosure. The balance
between secrecy and disclosure has always been in favor of secrecy, especially
since World War II, controlled by laws highly deferential to the equities of the
interested government agencies. The five citizens who serve on the review board
decided that if their mandate was to have any meaning it was imperative to
pierce this veil. They had to get at categories that had been classified here


before, including information derived from intelligence sources and methods.
While some historians have been critical of the resources devoted to this
particular effort, I like to believe that a breakthrough had to be achieved Pi
somewhere, and in fact, the records pertaining to President Kennedy's
assassination make an excellent demonstration project of what can now be
released. The lines drawn by the review board should prove helpful as the
government undertakes to declassify the vast body of records generated during
the Cold War.

Finally, I'd like to say the entire history of the federal government's efforts

in the wake of the assassination, including the experience of the review board,
serves as a cautionary tale. Perhaps it will enable the government to strike a
better balance between secrecy and disclosure in the future, for there exists no
better example of the heavy wages of doubt, suspicion and public cynicism
exacted by secrecy than the Kennedy assassination experience.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Federal News Service, JUNE 4, 1997

REP. HASTERT: I thank the gentleman.

And now, Mr. Hitchcock, I'd like to welcome you especially. A gentleman from
Ohio asked me a little while ago if I was an attorney. Indeed, I was not an
attorney, I happened to be a history teacher for 16 years before I ever got into
politics. So it's certainly a noble trade, and happy that you're here. I know

the chairman wanted to introduce you personally, but he couldn't make it this
afternoon.

You have contributed students, I understand, a clerk for this commission, and
have been involved in it at a very high degree. So we welcome you and listen to
your testimony.

BRUCE HITCHCOCK (Teacher, Noblesville High School, Indiana): Thank you, Mr.
Chairman. And I, too, would ask that my written statement be entered into the:
record and I will briefly summarize.

REP. HASTERT: Without objection, all written statements will be entered into the
record.

MR. HITCHCOCK: Thank you.

My name is Bruce Hitchcock and I am a teacher at Noblesville High School located
in Noblesville, Indiana, which is a community approximately 20 miles north of
Indianapolis. I am currently completing my 28th year in secondary education.
My teaching assignment has primarily been in the areas of United States history,
American government, and international relations.

And I want to express my appreciation to the committee for affording me the
honor and privilege of being here today and permitting me to make some brief
remarks concerning an issue about which I have very strong convictions not only
as a citizen, but as an educator.

In the spring of 1994, I assigned my Honors United States history class a

project studying the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. This project
culminated in the students placing the Warren Commission Report on trial. Half
of the class represented the prosecution and half the class defended the Warren
Commission Report. The class became quite interested in, and many would say
obsessed with this subject. The project resulted in a trial which became quite
intense and divisive, so much so that the class had to have a party at the end

of the semester to rekindle friendships. They became so fascinated with the
subject of the assassination that they requested an opportunity to travel to
Washington, DC during the summer following their graduation to do additional
research.

From that modest class assignment developed an internship opportunity with the
JEK Assassination Records Review Board. To date, four student groups from


Noblesville High School have interned with the review board, with the fifth
scheduled for the week of June 16th of this year. When this group completes its
work, a total of 56 of our students will have participated in this unique and
truly educational opportunity.

I might add that except for the first group, succeeding student groups have
studied, researched and prepared for their internship on their own time, outside
normal class meetings. The most recent group to participate did so over spring
break. The fact that students wanted to spend their vacation working with.
government records reflects the interest that the JFK assassination has for
students.

In my 28 years of teaching, I have never had a topic create as much interest as.
the assassination of President Kennedy. It is a mystery, and it provides an
excellent research opportunity, as well as a chance for students to be actively
involved in learning.

Since November 22nd, 1963, there have been many who have believed, and still


PAGE 27
Federal News Service, JUNE 4, 1997

believe the government did conceal, continues to conceal, and will continue to
conceal the truth. If the review board is permitted time to complete its work,

it will assist in defusing the last two charges. We cannot prevent the

speculation that someone did conceal the truth. But the argument that a
cover-up continues, and will continue, can at least be defused, or discouraged.
What has been lost cannot be replaced. However, what still exists can be made
public. We should have access, and our students should have access to the
information and documents still in existence. This is an opportunity for the
United States government to provide a credible response to public interest. The
review board established by the Congress, is actually a group of citizens

telling the government what to do, and what to release. An opportunity exists,
in this era of skepticism, to restore some credibility and trust in the :
government. :

In his recent book, "The Approaching Fury," author Stephen B. Oates quotes John
Furling as saying, "Events by themselves are unimportant. It is the perception
of events that is crucial."

Perhaps in 1997, the most important aspect concerning the assassination of
President Kennedy, is the perception, shared by many, of a conspiracy involving
individuals.and agencies of the United States government. Do we not owe our
young people the opportunity to form the most accurate perception possible? Do
we not owe them the chance to see as much of the truth intact as can be
assembled?

It seems to me that we owe this generation, and all succeeding generations, the
opportunity to question, to study, and to form opinions on the basis of
information they can view independently, without solely relying on the opinions
of others. Oftentimes, while I'm’‘in the classroom, I observe students who have
opinions, but little to substantiate them. Congress has a chance before it in

some small way —- or maybe in some large way ~ to at least provide them with
more information, so that they may have their turn in determining what the JFK
assassination means.

We have been affected by this event. For 34 years we have been affected. The 56
students from Noblesville High School have, as have countless others, been
affected by the events of November 22nd, 1963.

The study of this event has the public interest. It is an event to which the

public and students can relate. It touches people.

As an aside, last week an article was published in the Indianapolis Star. I have

a copy with me today. Regarding our school's ongoing JFK assassination project.
Within a day of its publication I received phone calls from a gentleman offering
500 pages of documents for our use. And from a former teacher calling me with
information regarding some scholarship opportunities. I also received a call


from ABC News Nightline. And yesterday before leaving Noblesville High School
received a call from Atlanta, Georgia offering information.

The subject of the call from Nightline was seeking information as to what
Noblesville High School students were doing with regard to the study of the
assassination. Together I think these calls reflect continued local and national
interest in continuing the probe into what happened in Dallas. Congress has the
opportunity to lay the facts before the American public and permit a more
reasoned, rational and fact-based account and discussion of the assassination.

I would hope that the committee would take into consideration the fact that the
teview board had a one-year delay before truly becoming operational, that it is
making a one-time request for an extension, that the review board has been on
task and on budget, that the review board has conducted its business in a
professional and non-partisan manner, and in 1992, when the act was passed by
this Congress and signed by President Bush, the enormity of the task was not




PAGE 28
Federal News Service, JUNE 4, 1997

and could not be fully appreciated.

An opportunity exists to complete a task which I believe is overwhelmingly
supported by the American public, and it is important that this mission and
mandate authorized by Congress be completed. I would like to end with just a
couple of quotes, one from former Senator Bob Dole, who said in a different
context, this is not about only who we are. It is about have we made a
difference. This is a chance to make a difference. And as former President
Reagan often said, if not us, who, and if not now, when?

After 34 years it is time to let the public know the facts that remain. To do

less would be a tragedy and a travesty. As an educator I believe that our most
important task is to provide our young people the most complete story of who we
are and why we are who we are. We have an opportunity to work towards the :
accomplishment of that goal. It is an opportunity, I believe, we cannot afford

to miss.

In his last speech in Fort Worth on November 22nd, 1963, President Kennedy said,.
we would like to live as we once lived, but history will not permit it. History

can only be served by permitting the public to see the evidence.

Mr. Chairman, as a further aside, if I might just have a few seconds. Reflective

of our students’ interest in this event, I have my honors government classes
perform a project for the model Congress. One of the students this year ~ they
could write a bill on whatever subject they wished, and one student who worked.
with the review board last year introduced House concurrent resolution 1 in
support of the review board, and concludes, after all the whereas's, the

Congress of the United States firmly supports the assassination records review
board in all endeavors leading to the collection, review and release of the
documents regarding the assassination of President Kennedy and supports the
extension of the life of the ARRB for an additional fiscal year.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

REP. HASTERT: We thank the gentleman and thank the panel. Now, I recognize the
gentleman from Wisconsin, Mr. Barrett.

REP. BARRETT: Mr: Hitchcock, can you give us the name of that student so we can.
make him or her an honorary co-sponsor? Might as well get the name in the
record.

MR. HITCHCOCK: Abigail Meyer, M-e-y-e-r.

REP. BARRETT: Judge Tunheim, you mentioned that you were releasing some
materials from Clay Shaw's diary and perhaps other things. Is there any
information in here that you find particularly interesting?

MR. TUNHEIM: Mr. Barrett, I've not had a chance to go through it. We've just
gotten these materials in the last week through some aggressive efforts on our


“ staff. The page that I cited to you is interesting in that he made the notation
in there and it's a portion of it in his own handwriting that it was perhaps
unfortunate that he had never met Oswald because then he might have possibly
been a tiny footnote in history, an ironic statement given the role that he
played in the trial.
We've not had a chance to analyze it thoroughly yet. It does contain his
reactions to events as they were going on around him during the course of the
prosecution and certainly supports his view that he was not involved whatsoever
in the assassination, which ultimately was the view of the jury that acquitted
him.
REP. BARRETT: For my benefit, as a person who has not been immersed in this
issue at all. You just mentioned it took some aggressive work from your staff to
get this released. Can you tell me what that entailed, where it was, why it was
so difficult to get this information?
MR. TUNHEIM: Certainly. Part of this, this is an investigation into where


PAGE 29
Federal News Service, JUNE 4, 1997 i

records are. The bulk of our work has been with federal agencies that hold
assassination records. But we've also, at the direction of Congress in the bill
that was passed, entertained a search for records wherever they might be.
Records that are in private hands are not records that we can subpoena and take
from people, so we have to find where they are.

Staff members go out, talk to people, encourage them to donate those records to
the American public, to the National Archives. That was done in this case. We
received a tip that an individual had records that were left over from Mr. Shaw,
and staff went and talked to the person, spent time with the person, encouraged
them to share those records with the American public, and that's how it was
developed.

REP. BARRETT: How do you determine which assassination records you can disclose
now and which just have to wait?

MR. TUNHEIM: Well, there's a standard that's set up by the act. There's first of
all a presumption that all records should be public. That presumption has
governed what the board has done throughout the process. But then there's a
standard where the board has to weigh the public interest in a particular record
or information with the potential harm that might be caused by release of the
material.

The standards that we look at are, are there national security interests such as
disclosure of an intelligence agent whose name hasn't been disclosed and whether
that person perhaps may be in some danger if that name was released publicly.
Does it disclose a method of protecting the president that is not generally

known today, so therefore it might be a threat to the president. Are there
personal privacy considerations that are involved.

I will tell you that when all is said and done, a very, very tiny percentage of
information gets redacted under the standards that we are applying, and the
process of going through the records has led the board to arrive at a number of
policy decisions which the agencies by and large are now following in their own
review of records, and therefore decisions that we had to make two years ago now
we don't have to make because the agency is following the advice of the board
made on earlier records.

REP. BARRETT: As long as there are some records that are not being released, do
you think that we will inevitably face criticism from some people in the
American public that there is still some sort of cover-up? I make reference to

Mr. Holland's comments about a book being written 75 years after President
Lincoln's assassination.

Will the time ever come, do you think, when all records will be released?


© MR. TUNHEIM: I think it will, Mr. Barrett. The board is releasing every record.
The question is whether certain information on these records gets redacted or
not. For every redaction we are attaching a specific release date. Some of the
dates are five years in the future. The law that was passed which established
the review board provided that all records that are redacted, all information
redacted will be released in 2017 unless whoever is president at that time makes
a specifics determination that the record cannot be released because of some .
continuing national security concern.
So we expect that virtually all of the information by 2017 will be released but
avery high percentage, in the 99.999 range is being released right now.
REP. BARRETT: Mr. Tilley, in your written statement you indicate that the
collections currently consist of 3.75 million pages. What's your estimate of how
many more records need to be reviewed?
MR. TILLEY: Well, it's hard to say because there is still a good deal of
material that's being reviewed by agencies at this time. But we have located


PAGE 30
Federal News Service, JUNE 4, 1997 i‘

some records at the National Archives that are still under review, such as the
Secretary of Army's records dealing with Operation Mongoose, the campaign to
destabilize the Cuban government in the period after the Bay of Pigs.

Other records have been located at other agencies. I received a call from the
Customs Bureau today and they will be turning over their assassination records
to me hopefully this afternoon. After this hearing is over I'll be picking up

the records they've located.

So it's tough to say how much is still out there but I think there's still going

to be another considerable amount of material, probably will be added to the
collection before this process is finished.

REP. BARRETT: Millions of pages?

MR. TILLEY: Oh, no. I would say probably, if we had another half a million
pages, that might be the extent of it. But what's interesting and fascinating

about this process is that we continue to turn up records where we did not know
there were records before. As agencies are aware of this effort, they have come

to the board. And the board is responsible for a lot of this by their aggressive
work with federal agencies. But I don't see us ever doubling the collection

again, but I think we will add a significant amount of material in the weeks and
years ahead.

REP. BARRETT: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

REP. HASTERT: Mr. Tunheim, I have just a very short question. You mentioned the
movie that came out, JFK, and Mr. Oliver Stone's work in there. Did Mr. Stone
ever have any questions of your work at all, or did he do research?

MR. TUNHEIM: Mr. Stone has been very supportive of the work of the review board.
He testified before the Congress when this bill was passed initially,

encouraging broad release of thé records. He sent a representative to one of our
public hearings who testified and spoke very favorably about the work of the
board. So he's been strongly supportive and we've appreciated that support.

REP. HASTERT: Why have you waited to this point in the process to begin
reviewing the CIA and FBI records?

MR. TUNHEIM: Well, we've been reviewing CIA records and FBI records from the
very beginning, Mr. Chairman. The volume of records in those agencies is really
significant. We have completed the entire review of the core collections of

those agencies and those are numbers, between the two agencies, it's more than a
million pages of records.

What we are doing right now are delving into what's called the sequestered
collection in both of these agencies. Within the CIA these are records that the
House Select Committee on Assassinations asked to be sequestered, taken away
from their files and kept in a secure place for future review. The House Select
Committee did not have time to review these records carefully. Some of them are


highly relevant to the assassination, others are not. Within the CIA there are
about 62 boxes of material and 72 reels of microfilm.

In the FBI in the same kind of sequestered collection is about 280,000 pages of
records. Those records are the focus of the review board's work over the next
year, if we get the extension.

REP. HASTERT: Let me ask the same question I asked the previous panel. Do you
think that you can finish your work by the end of the fiscal year 1998?

MR. TILLEY: Mr. Chairman, I'm confident that the board can complete its work.
Members of the review board are confident. We will make every effort to ensure
that it gets done. In fact, we intend to provide to your staff a timeline which

sets out our anticipation of how we will review these records over the next

year.

We have set up a review process that we're working on right now that's moving
quickly and we are confident that the work can be done. We were set up to be a
temporary board and no one on the board wishes this effort to take a long


PAGE 31
Federal News Service, JUNE 4, 1997

time. We need to get the information to the American public.

REP. HASTERT: Thank you very much. Mr. Hitchcock, I want to ask you, bringing
students into the real realm of research and learning in that respect, how -
important is it that records like this be made available to the public so that

folks like yourself can have the availability for students?

MR. HITCHCOCK: I think, Mr. Chairman, it is extremely important for not only
teachers of history and historians but also for future students and future
generations. One of the things so special about our relationship with the review
board has not only been an opportunity for students to travel to Washington, and
they pay their own way and they do their own research on their on time. But it
has helped change opinions in many cases by students about not only the
assassination but about government, politics, agencies and people who work for
the government.

I cannot overstate the importance this has had for the 43 thus far, and soon to

be 56, students from Noblesville High School who have had this research
opportunity, that have been able actually to see, handle original documents, to
work with documents, to see firsthand the evidence that exists. To have that
opportunity is something that no teacher, no classroom, no film, no laser disk,
nothing in the classroom can simulate such interest and focus as this trip to
Washington DC, the review of documents, the working with people that we've had
the opportunity to be with at the review board ona firsthand basis.

It is just something that cannot be duplicated, or as I said, simulated in any
classroom anywhere in the country. It's just been a fantastic opportunity and
will provide students in the future with a place to go to find those records, to
look at the records, to look at the documents, and be at least assured that as
much as is available and is in existence can now be made available to them as
ordinary citizens of this country, whether they be students at a university,
students at a high school, or in their just curiosity and interest as American

I don't think it can be overstated the impact that this will have in helping

bridge that gap of skepticism, if this is the correct way to say it, that

exists. I just cannot imagine what the many conspiracy theorists out there would
think if the review board has to finish its stay without completing its work.

REP. HASTERT: Thank you. The gentleman from Ohio.

-REP. LATOURETTE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

And Mr. Chairman, I would begin by indicating that my earlier query about your
legal training was not meant to be an affront, and I should have recognized that
your learned demeanor was that of a --

REP. HASTERT: Notat all.


REP. LATOURETTE: Mr. Howe, I don't have a question but I'm glad you told the
story of Otto Eisenschiml because somewhere in the back of my mind I remember a
book or movie called the Lincoln conspiracy and I was certain that Secretary
Stanton had something to do with the demise of our sixteenth president, so I'm

glad you brought that up.

Mr. Tunheim, I do want to ask you a follow-up question to what we were talking

to Congressmen Stokes about and I was fascinated by the document that you held
up. When I was in the prosecution business and we had a public records law in
Ohio which was new on the books, we found that law enforcement agencies always
wanted to take a big black magic marker and redact everything. It was my view
that that led to more conjecture, rumor, suspicion than not, and I think this :
document that you brought forward, knowing that it came from the Swiss federal
police, that would give, I think, some cause to believe that Mr. Oswald had some
Swiss bank account and was squirreling away money from foreign nationals as part

of a conspiracy.


PAGE 32
Federal News Service, JUNE 4, 1997 .

When you un-redact it, if that's really a word, you find out like so many other
people he apparently registered for the Albert Schweitzer College for the fall
semester of 1960 and didn't show up. Nothing sinister or unusual in that at all.
The question I have is, when you were testifying you indicated that the FBI
originally appealed the decision to not—or to withdraw the redaction of this
particular document. You also indicated that the vast majority of documents that
you have left to review during this renewal period are located at the CIA and

the FBI in the sequestered section, I assume.

Are you any unusual difficulties with either of those agencies in terms of
cooperation as you attempt to get to a public release of what should be
appropriately publicly released?

MR. TUNHEIM: Well, Mr. LaTourette, the answer — the question is, no, we're not
receiving any degree of difficulty with those agencies right now. They are
comunitted to this process. They are supportive of the effort to keep the process
going for one additional year.

The CIA has not appealed decisions that the review board has made. We've got a ae
good working relationship with the people within that agency who are doing their
work. The FBI appealed a significant number of our decisions, but now all of
those appeals have been withdrawn. And we've got a working relationship with
the FBI that I think has been constructive and professional and is working quite
well.

The FBI initially opposed release of the document that I held up and appealed

the decision because they had contacted, in a general way, the Swiss federal
police and asked whether this record could be released, and the answer was no.
Our follow-up through the ambassador is showing what really this document was
all about, led to some wiser approach to the particular issue. And sometimes it
takes additional work like that to accomplish the release of important

materials.

REP. LATOURETTE: And the last question I would have is Congressman Stokes
expressed the view that perhaps the fine work of this review board — should
another review board setting be required in the future to review another
situation similar to this, that you may be breaking down some of the barriers in
terms of suspicions that the intelligence community may have about do we need
to, you know, stick to the script and have a page that has all black magic

marker on it? Do you find that the lessons learned in this review board will be
instructive to us as we move forward and think of ways of dealing with the
release of documents in the future?

MR. TUNHEIM: I think that's a very good question. And we have found through
this effort, being the first group, an independent group outside of an agency,

to have this degree of control over the declassification process. The process


at first was rough and difficult and fraught with suspicion. That has changed.
There's been a sea change as these agencies have realized that release of this
information is not going to harm our national security, that perhaps it's time
simply to trust the American people with access to important information about
their government. And I think everyone has learned important lessons from this
process. It's a process that, while time- consuming, has worked very well for
this set of records. :

REP. LATOURETTE: And in that regard and in that vein, have you at the review
board put together sort of an instruction or an operating manual to be left
behind for future such endeavors?

MR. TUNHEIM: Well, we certainly will. We have - virtually all of our work has
been computerized so that we have an extensive record of exactly how we've
approached all these issues. We do intend, in our final report, to make
recommendations on how this effort can be extended in the future to other areas
if the Congress so wishes.


PAGE 33
Federal News Service, JUNE 4, 1997

REP. LATOURETTE: Thank you for answering my questions. Thank you! for your fine
work. And thank you, Mr. Chairman.

REP. : Thank you. I had a couple of questions. I read your testimony as I was
listening to the other two. I'm sorry I was late. I wanted to ask Mr. Holland;

were there credible historians who at this point were still questioning the
assassination in the Warren Commission and the information that came out before
this commission existed, before these documents came out?

MR. HOLLAND: Basically, most historians have stayed away from it because they
regard it as a tar baby. So there are actually surprisingly few. By

historians, you mean professors at universities. Surprisingly few have written
about it, because they just see it as a morass, and how are you going to

possibly figure out what happened? So my answer would be -- and, you know,
credible is in the eye of the beholder.

But there's actually remarkably few, and that's one of my arguments is that you
have to — it is time to insert it back into history. It did happen during the

Cold War, and that exerted a tremendous influence over what the government did.
Right after the assassination, it was a precipitating element of the formation

of the Warren Commission that the Cold War was ongoing, and they worried about
~ to be frank, they worried about congressional committees holding hearings and
disclosure of sources and methods, such as the fact that Oswald had gone to
Mexico City and been observed by photographic surveillance, and how was that -
going to be handled by a congressional committee? So I do believe it has to be
inserted into historical context. That's probably been the element that's been
missing all this time.

REP. : So you believe one of the élements of this commission is it'll bring out

of pulp -- pop culture -- pulp culture was a bad choice of words — pop culture

and in more mainstream because more documents are there, less questions. It can
now be analyzed. And also, you seem to hint that we'll gain as much, not
necessarily that there's a lot of new information on the assassination, but that

we're going to learn a lot about how our government worked and a lot of the
interrelationships, and that may be, in fact, more use to the historians than

any questions they had remaining about the assassination.

MR. HOLLAND: I think ~ my own particular view is that besides, you know, being
an investigation of three crimes — the murder of President Kennedy, the assault

on Governor Connally and the murder of Officer Tippett (sp), and then the murder
of Oswald, so four crimes -- the Warren Commission is a fantastic lens to view

the operation of the government circa 1963-64, because they had an overriding
mandate.

But yet they were going up against agencies such as the FBI and CIA with


entrenched interests, and especially Hoover's FBI was sort of a wonder to

behold. You dealt with it very gingerly. So it's a great— andthe FBIlhad

not been second-guessed since Hoover became director. This was the first time.
And you can't underestimate what that meant in terms of the difficulties it

posed for the commission. Now, I maintain they still came to the right

conclusion, but the fact is that they had a lot of trouble with the FBI.

: REP. : One of the questions here is it took so many years to get to this point.

In looking at what future commissions might do, how much of that, do you think,
can be overcome? In other words, how much of this was the Hoover FBI, say, and
how much of this is institutional that in the first 10 years you'd have so many
agents active in the field, ongoing operations, in the first 20 years there's

still some — can we accelerate the process? °
What have we learned from this as to - obviously this is one that particularly
anybody in the '60s era was a defining event, so it's an extraordinary

assassination. But what have we learned for investigations in the future? Do


PAGE 34
Federal News Service, JUNE 4, 1997

you believe the CIA and FBI will release information sooner? And if so,
presumably they'll still be redacted, which still could lead to Oliver Stone

movies and Lincoln conspiracy books and all sorts ofthings, == --—-------
MR. HOLLAND: Mr. Chairman, I think that the fact that these records are 30 years
old has helped in obtaining their release. It's not information about the
assassination per se that agencies have objected to releasing. It's more who

said what to who, who's an intelligence agent and who's an informant for the

FBI, those kinds of issues. And there will still be institutional reluctance to
release any of that information.

Ihope that through this process we can demonstrate to the public and to these
agencies that this information can be released to the public, that the public

can be trusted with information like this. There will still be a need for

secrecy to a certain extent, but certainly not with the broad brush/black pen
approach of the past.

REP. : We first learned -- I was elected in ‘94, and our first experience in

this committee was with Waco, where we had similar questions and still had some
information that wasn’t able to be released. We're certainly having that

ongoing debate with the administration right now, because it gets far beyond the
initial investigation. In the course of Travelgate we discovered the data bank.
And, of course, with the data bank you discover the code, and then you find out
that the code leads to this. Pretty soon you're off into other investigations.

That's going to be an ongoing problem. Do you believe, in the erd, that this

will have silenced most critics?

MR. HOLLAND: In my view, Mr. Chairman, it will silence some. It will perhaps
provoke others.

We're many years after an event that was investigated in a different era. There
were many mistakes made at the time that cannot be corrected at this stage in
time. But I think when the review board is done with its work, one thing we
should be able to prove to the American people is that the federal government is
no longer keeping secrets from them relative to the Kennedy assassination. I
think that will be a very significant development.

Whether all the questions will be resolved or not, that's a question for
historians in the future who will review these materials and will make their
determinations. This is like a gigantic puzzle with a lot of pieces missing.
Weare putting some of those pieces in, small pieces and large pieces. But
there's a lot of pieces of the puzzle that will never be found.

REP. : I want to ask one last question, and that's options of dealing with
acquiring the Zapruder film. Is that going to be a cost additional to what
you're requesting? Do you have options on how to pay for that? What's the


status of that?

MR. HOLLAND: Well, the Zapruder film, as the chairman is aware, the review board
designated that as an assassination record about a month or so ago. We felt

that that decision was determined by the Congress in the passage of the JFK
Records Collection Act when it said that all records in the possession of the
National Archives are assassination records and should be included in this
collection. :

Recognizing the potential cost of a film like this, we did set forth a 16-month
period before the taking would take place, so that the Congress could address
this issue and make appropriate determinations that the Congress wished to make
those determinations. The board did feel that that decision had been made for it
by the Congress in the earlier act and that it is the most significant piece of
evidence of one of the most significant crimes in our nation's history. So,
therefore, the original has an intrinsic value, and it should belong forever to

the American public.


PAGE 35
Federal News Service, JUNE 4, 1997

We are hopeful that the Zapruder family will agree eventually to donate that

film to the American public. We have no assurances of that at this point. But

we did set the time frame far out in the future so that the Congress can review

this issue and make its own determinations if it so wishes. REP. : Do you have

any additional questions? With that, I thank you all for ~

REP. LATOURETTE: Mr. Chairman, if I could beg your indulgence and just ask one
more question, if I may.

Mr. Tunheim, if I might, my previous question about difficulty with the CIA and
FBI. Sometimes I don't make things broad enough. And I guess my query would be,
it's been brought to my attention that perhaps there's been some difficulty in
obtaining records from the other body. Is there any agency within the federal
government that you're having difficulty in terms of cooperation that would
impede your ability to complete your work in a timely fashion, as envisioned by
this legislation?

MR. TUNHEIM: Mr. LaTourette, I have not seen any evidence currently that anyone
is deliberately stonewalling us, so that when we go away, they will put the

records back into the files. We had some significant problems early in the

process, just really because agencies didn't understand what this was all about

and didn't understand what the law really provided for. So it took some time.

It's taken some time, for example, with the Secret Service to get them to the

point of realizing their obligations under the act. They do now, and they've

been very cooperative and easy to work with. But this has been a learning

process for all of the agencies, and I feel at the current time there are no
impediments among any of the agency partners that we're dealing with to
completing the review of the records on a timely basis.

REP. LATOURETTE: Thank you: I thank the chair for your indulgence.

REP. : I thank you all for your testimony and appreciate your coming today. For
procedural purposes, I'll now close this hearing -- the hearing is adjourned —

and open a subcommittee markup on HR 1553, markup of the John F. Kennedy Record
Review Board Reauthorization Act. The hearing is now open.

If there are no opening statements, the subcommittee will now proceed to the
consideration of the bill as amended. Without objection, the first reading of

the bill is dispensed with and the bill will be considered for amendment at any
point. Do any members wish to be recognized to offer an amendment? Hearing
none, the question is on favorable reporting of the bill, HR 1553, the John F.
Kennedy Assassination Records Review Board Reauthorization Act. All those in
favor say “Aye.”

MEMBERS: Aye.

REP. : Opposed, "No." In the opinion of the chair, the ayes have it. It goes

fast. The question now comes, will the subcommittee report the bill to the full


committee? All those in favor, say “Aye.” MEMBERS: Aye.

REP. : Opposed, "No." In the opinion of the chair, the ayes have it. The bill _
moves forward to the full committee. There is no other business before the
subcommittee. We now stand adjourned. Thank you all for your hard work.

Judge John R. Tunheim
Chairman
Assassination Records Review Board.

Prepared Testimony In Support of
HR. 1553,
To amend the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992
to extend the authorization of the Assassination Records Review Board
until September 30, 1998.

Before the
National Security, International Affairs and Criminal Justice Subcommittee,
House Government Reform and Oversight Committee

June 4, 1997

I. Introduction

Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee, I would like to thank you for the
opportunity to testify on behalf of the Assassination Records Review Board in support
of HLR. 1553, which would extend the authorization of the Review Board for one final
year. The Board acknowledges that all of the issues surrounding the assassination of
President Kennedy will likely never be fully resolved, however, this additional time
‘will allow us to complete our work, including the review and public release of critical
FBI and CIA records, submit a comprehensive and complete final report to the
Congress and the President, and make available to the American publicas much
information as possible on the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.

I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Chairman Burton for introducing
HiR. 1553, and Congressmen Waxman and Stokes for cosponsoring this bill. These
Members have exhibited an admirable bipartisan spirit and an understanding that we
as a government, and as a nation, must bring closure to a sad chapter of our history,
and that we must seize this opportunity to do itnow. In addition, we would like to
express our appreciation to Chairman Hastert for chairing this hearing today. It
provides an opportunity to explain what the Review Board has accomplished to date
and discuss how we could finish our work in Fiscal Year 1998, if given the opportunity.

Please allow me to introduce the other members of the Review Board with whom I have
had the professional honor and personal pleasure to work: Dr. Henry F. Graff,
Professor Emeritus of History, Columbia University; Dr. Kermit L. Hall, Dean, College
of Humanities, and Professor of History and Law, The Ohio State University; Dr.
William L. Joyce, Associate University Librarian for Rare Books and Special Collections,
Princeton University; and Dr. Anna K. Nelson, Distinguished Adjunct Historian in


_ Residence, The American University. We have been honored to engage in this
important effort to make the history of the Kennedy assassination available to the
American public and I am pleased to be here today to testify before this Subcommittee
and answer any of your questions.

I would also like to describe briefly the professional staff that we are fortunate to have
hired. The Executive Director is.Dr. David G. Marwell, a professional historian who
gained vast experience dealing with large numbers of important historical documents
with the Office of Special Investigations at the Department of Justice and later as the
Director of the Berlin Document Center. He leads a staff of 28 full-time employees, who
have varied backgrounds as historians, lawyers, analysts, investigators, and
administrators. The members of the staff have approached their unique task with
seriousness of purpose, creativity, professionalism, and competence, and have assisted
us in shedding new light on the assassination through the release of thousands of
Federal Government records, and the acquisition of records in private hands and local
governments that were not previously available to the American public. -I believe that --
we assembled exactly the typéof:professional and diversified staff that Congress. <
envisioned would be necessary to accomplish this difficult assignment.

II. Accomplishments to Date

As I know you are aware, the Review Board was created by The President John F.
Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 (JFK Act) as an independent
Federal agency to oversee the identification and release of records related to the
assassination of President Kennedy. I know that certain members of this subcommittee
played a role in crafting and passing the JFK Act—a unique piece of legislation
designed to remove doubt and speculation about the content of government records
telated to the assassination of President Kennedy. As a result of these lingering
suspicions, Congress determined that an independent board was the most effective and
efficient vehicle to make all assassination records available to the public.

The Review Board has accomplished much since we began releasing previously secret
records in June of 1995. The Board, has acted to transfer more than 14,000 documents to
the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection (JFK Collection) at the
National Archiyes and Records Administration. We would not have been successful in
our efforts without the significant assistance of the National Archives. The JFK
Collection currently totals approximately 3.7 million pages and is used aa by
researchers from all over the United States.

By the end of Fiscal Year 1997, the Review Board will have reviewed and processed
nearly all of the assassination records that have been identified by the more than 30
different government offices believed to be in possession of relevant records, with the


. important exception of the FBI and the CIA. I will elaborate on the status of records
held by these two agencies later. The overwhelming majority of previously redacted
information will have been made public by the Review Board.

Before discussing what we will accomplish with one final year, I would like to highlight
for the Members of the Subcommittee some of the important records that the Board has
made public. They include:

* Thousands of CIA documents on Lee Harvey Oswald and the assassination of
President Kennedy that made up the CIA’s Oswald File and detail the agency's
investigative activities following the assassination;

* Thousands of once-secret records from the investigation by the House Select
Committee on Assassinations, chaired-by-Gongressman Stokes, includin th
controversial Staff Report on Oswald's trip'té‘Mexico City; ° 5

i! Thousands of records from the FBI's core and related assassination files that
document the FBI's interest in Oswald from 1959-63, after he had defected to the
Soviet Union, three years before the assassination; and

The extensive FBI files on its investigation of the assassination.

The important work in which the Review Board has been engaged can be best and most
graphically demonstrated by showing you the “before” and “after” versions of one of
the pre-assassiriation FBI documents to which I just referred and that the Board has
released to the public. Prior to the Review Board’s review, this FBI document (JFK
Collection Record Number: 124-10023-10236, Attachment Number 1) was available to
the public as you see it on the left. As you can see, it is heavily redacted. The only
information that was not secret was the daté of the memorandum, “October 12, 1960,”
that it was to the “Director, FBI,” from “Legat, Paris” (the FBI representative in Paris),
that the subject was “Lee Harvey Oswald, Internal Security,” and that it had to do with
a “Paris letter 9/27/60.” The rest of the text was blacked out. Obviously, this version
of the document left room for a great deal of speculation among historians and .
researchers regarding what was underneath the black ink on this document with the
provocative subject title.

The Review Board aggressively pursued the release of the redacted information in this
document and several others that relate to the FBI’s interest in Oswald before the
assassination. After protracted negotiations with the FBI, an initial FBI appeal to the
White House in an effort to keep the document secret, and a direct appeal to the Swiss



government, we were able to release the information. The unredacted memorandum
shows that the Swiss Federal Police had been enlisted by the FBI to try to locate Oswald
and to determine whether or not he had enrolled at a school in Switzerland. Now the
public is able to see the document in full and judge its importance. In its redacted state,
the document could have meant anything that a researcher's imagination and
speculation could invent. In its released form, it must be analyzed for what it says.

One of the most important, most difficult, and most time-consuming responsibilities of
the Review Board is to identify and locate additional records-that are relevant to the
assassination. This is a task that to some degree must logically come later in the ©
process, after the Review Board has gained a full understanding of the records that have
already been identified. Although the Review Board has made a significant number of
requests for additional records and information, some of which I would like to outline,
much remains to be done before it can noe confident that it has completed this:«.1<:6 -. 2%. -
responsibility. .

I would like to highlight some of our efforts to identify and locate additional
assassination records. Some examples:

bd Medical Records Inquiry. The Review Board has several ongoing efforts to
identify and locate assassination records involving medical issues. As with any
homicide, the medical records are among the most important pieces of evidence.
As part of its attempt to ensure that the medical records are as complete as
possible, the Review Board staff has deposed the principal pathologists involved ~
in President Kennedy’s autopsy, as well as other individuals who had
knowledge of the autopsy and related photographic records.

Review Board ‘has continued its ae to Tocate. additional FBI assassination
records by making several requests for records and information. The FBI has
assisted in this effort by giving the Review Board members access to requested
files. The JFK Task Force at the FBI has, on the whole, been extremely =~
cooperative and helpful to the Board and has provided the requested
information.

Review Board ‘has initiated a number of ars ‘to ‘the CIA for additional
information and records.-The Review Board expects that these requests will be -
promptly and fully satisfied during the upcoming year.


Information. Time ae and careful r review ‘of Secret Service activities by
the Review Board produced a series of requests for additional records and
information that, in turn, led to the identification of additional relevant
assassination records. For example, in response to the Review Board’s first eight
requests for additional information, the Secret Service has submitted more than
1,500 pages of material.

Department of Defense (including its many components and. ae Taine
services) (collectively “DOD”), identified few assassination records on its own.
initiative. DOD has nevertheless been cooperative with the efforts of the Review
Board to locate assassination records. When such records have been located,

DOD has been willing to release the records with few redactions.

Additional work would be required in‘our‘last year to ensure thatall-" ©:
assassination records in the military archives have been made a part of the JFK: === 2°:
Collection. Fortunately, the diligent efforts of the ARRB staff have set the stage

for accomplishing this task.

V. Release of Private and Local Records

In addition to the release of records in the Federal Government's vast files, and
consistent with the Board’s mandate to make the historical record of the assassination as
complete as possible, we have been aggressive in identifying and acquiring significant
assassination-related records in the possession of private citizens and local
governments, including:

7 The original personal papers of Warren Commission Chief Counsel J. Lee Rankin
that give further insight into the operations of the Commission;

i Copies of the official records of New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison's
. investigation of the assassination;

yi The original papers of New Orleans attorney Edward Wegmann, from his work
as a member of the legal team that successfully defended Clay Shaw in 1969
against a charge of conspiracy to kill President Kennedy.

ie Copies of records from the Metropolitan Crime Commission of New Orleans,
including records on District Attorney Garrison's investigation and prosecution
of Clay Shaw and records regarding New Orleans organized crime figures;


* Long-lost films taken in Dallas on November 22, 1963, that the public had never
seen and that shed new light on the events of that day; and

ei Private collections of records from individuals including Warren Commission
attorney Wesley Liebler, author David Lifton, FBI Special Agent Hosty, Attorney
Frank Ragano, as well as others.

Iam also pleased to announce today that the Review Board has just acquired the
original personal papers of Clay Shaw, the late New Orleans businessman who is the
only person ever tried in connection with the assassination of President Kennedy. Shaw
was acquitted by a jury in 1969 after being charged as part of District Attorney
Garrison’s investigation. The Shaw papers will surely add another dimension to this
particular chapter of the assassination story.

All of these records will enrich the historical record of the assassination for future
generations of Americans. Once these records are- processed and described Pa iat aie
National Archives, they will be available-for'research. -

VI. The Need For Additional Time

Despite our best efforts and significant accomplishments, some of which I have
outlined, the Review Board will not be able to complete its work within the original
three-year timetable set by Congress for the following reasons:

* First, the authors of the original legislation believed that our task would take
three years. That estimate was based on the best available information at the
time, but the legislation established an unprecedented process. There was no
way of knowing the problems of scale and complexity that the Board would
encounter, nor was there any way to factor in the comprehensive approach we
have taken in fulfilling our mandate.

. Second, the Board was not appointed until 18 months after the legislation was
signed into law. Asa result, without the guidance of the Board, Federal agencies
initially defined for themselves the universe of records that should be processed
under The Act and to speculate about the kind of evidence that would be needed
to sustain the redaction of assassination-related information. Once the Board
was in Place, agencies needed to redo a considerable amount of work. In fact,
many agencies have yet to complete their review and the Board is still seeking
their compliance.

ee Third, our enabling legislation imposed several restrictions on the manner in
which the Board could operate. Unlike other temporary agencies, the Board



could not hire or detail experienced federal employees, but rather had to hire
new employees who had to undergo background investigations and be cleared at
the Top Secret level. Locating and renovating space that was suitable for the
storage of classified materials was required. As a result, the Board could not
begin an effective review of records until the third quarter of our first year.

We are pleased and proud that the Review Board and staff have been able to overcome
these obstacles, and that we have developed an efficient and effective process for the
review of records. All involved in this process want to see that the job is done, and do
not want to cease now with a reasonable conclusion in sight. We want to finish the job
we began, and with one additional year we can.

VII. The Job Ahead

The additional year of operations will permit the Review Board to finish its task by
completing several major areas of our-work. Please be. assured that these are
identifiable projects that are'critical to erisuting that the JFK Collection is'ascomiplete as
possible, that relevant Federal agencies have been held accountable, and that all that we
have done is documented in our final report. The Board would focus in our final year
on the following:

* CIA Sequestered Collection. The Review Board has completed its review of the
Oswald “201 file,” the file created and maintained by the CIA on Oswald and the
assassination. The Review Board is now faced with the task of reviewing the
agency’s “Sequestered Collection,” the large collection of files that was
assembled by the CIA in response to requests made by the House Select
Committee on Assassinations, chaired by Congressman Stokes, in the late 1970's.
These records find their relevance to the assassination defined in part by the
course of the HSCA investigation. The Sequestered Collection originally
consisted of 63 boxes of CLA- and HSCA-originated records as well as 72 reels of» ~
microfilm. Unfortunately, these records are in a confused order, poorly
described, and are replete with duplicates. Some of these records are clearly of.
great significance, some are of only marginal interest, and the relevance of others
cannot be identified.

* FBI] Sequestered Collection.“ The FBI divides its assassination records into two
general categories. The first is the “Core and Related Files,” consisting of nearly
600,000 pages of files collected in the course of the massive FBI investigation into
the assassination. The Review Board will complete its review of this significant
collection by the end of FY 1997. The second, which the FBI refers to as its
“HSCA records,” is a large collection of records that were identified as being of
interest to the HSCA and which remain to be reviewed by the Board. Like the


CIA’s Sequestered Collection, this voluminous body of records (approximately
280,000 pages) ranges widely in relevance to the assassination.

Terenay ine will ‘allow the Board to finish its work with everal a agencies,
including the Secret Service, the National Security Agency, and Congressional
Committees, including the Senate Intelligence Committee. . -

bd Search for Additional Records. With one more year of operations, the Board’s
search for additional records held by Federal agencies, private individuals, and
local governments would be concluded with greater confidence. Some of these
records have been identified, but not yet acquired by the Board.

ad Federal Agency Compliance. In November 1996, the Review Board initiated a
compliance program to ensure that Federal agencies have fully cooperated with
the Board in discharging its responsibility of assuring Congress and the
American public that the goals of the JFK Act have beeriaccomplished to th
greatest possible extent. The requests to document compliance with the JFK Act
were sent to 27 U.S. government agencies and departments to confirm that the
U.S. government has identified, located, and released all records relating to the
assassination of President Kennedy. The agencies’ statements of compliance will
be included in the Review Board’s final report to the Congress. The one-year
extension will ensure that the compliance program is completed and fully - -
documented in the final report.

It is important for the Review Board to complete these major projects. The Board.
believes that the completion of the task outlined above, the inclusion of these important
records in the JFK Collection, and the documentation of Federal agency compliance as
part of the final report will mark an appropriate point at which to conclude the Board’s
work. We are confident that all that remains for the Board can be accomplished in an
additional year.

It is clear to the members of the Review Board that there is much work to bedone. The -
review of the remaining CIA and FBI records is a cumbersome and complicated task.
However, the Board and staff have the benefit of our experience to date that sets the
stage for an efficient and effective review of the remaining records. I would like to
briefly describe our early experiences reviewing records and how the past two years set
a firm foundation for the future and would work to our advantage in our last year.


* Our review of records in the early months was slowed by the complexities of the issues

raised in the records. The unprecedented new standards of the JFK Act, which go far
beyond those established under the Freedom of Information Act, required a time-
consuming early phase.

At first, the review process proceeded slowly and the agencies were afforded ample
opportunity to present their evidence. Over time, the Review Board began to
standardize its interpretation of the relevant section of the JFK Act and the issues raised
in the various documents, Now that the Review Board and the agencies are familiar
with the rigorous demands of the JFK Act, the process has accelerated. Ina
progressively increasing number of cases, records that initially contained proposed
postponements can be released through a “consent” process. In this consent process,
the ARRB staff notifies an agency that its proposed postponements are not likely to be
approved by the Review Board and the agency thereupon voluntarily consents to the
telease of the information.

In our review of the FBI’s “Core and Related Files” arid:the CIA’s “Oswald 201 File,”
the records that have been the focus of our attention to date, we subjected every
requested redaction to a rigorous test: did the evidence of the harm that would result
from the release of the information outweigh the public interest in the information?

In considering our review of the CIA and FBI “Sequestered Collections,” the Board
recognized that it needed to develop a different approach, one that would take into
account the varied degree of relevance of individual records to the assassination. Only
in this way could the Board ensure that it would appropriately expend its resources in
its last year. As a first step, the Board carefully analyzed each collection in order to
determine what priority should be assigned to the category of records. In addition, the
Board developed a set of guidelines for the review of these records which recognized
that some categories of records did not require the intensive word-by-word review that
had been the rule for the core collections that have been the subject of the Board’s
attention to date. The development of these guidelines began with the August 6, 1996
Board public hearing and culminated in their adoption at the October 16, 1996 Board
meeting. The ARRB staff will distinguish between records whose relevance to the
assassination is clear and. those not believed to be relevant (or “NBR”). Applying these
new standards will permit the ARRB staff to identify and review the most significant
remaining records in order of priority.

These detailed guidelines will reduce the loss of valuable Review Board and ARRB staff
time expended to review, ona word-by-word basis, those documents that have a
remote relationship, at best, to the Kennedy assassination. Those documents that are
identified as relevant to the assassination will continue to be reviewed word-by-word.
These standards of relevance are designed to ensure that the greatest number of true


assassination records is properly identified, reviewed, and made public in the JFK
Collection at the National Archives.

The fruits of our labor from the first three years would be realized in our last year, one
in which we would be reviewing some of the most difficult records, and potentially
most important records, but with the benefit of our invaluable experience. lam happy .
to report that we have received assurances from the FBI and CIA that they will work
with us in a final year to make sure that the necessary resources are applied so that our
task can be completed.

IX. Conclusion

In making our recommendation for a one-year extension, we, the members of the
Review Board, are fully cognizant of the difficulties inherent in extending a temporary
commission. We are aware of the concern that temporary bodies may have a self-
preserving and self-perpetuating instinct, and-want to assure you in the clearest and
most unambiguous manner that our recommeridation'is motivated strictly by our desire
to complete the job. My colleagues and I were appointed as private citizens and have
many competing claims on our time and energy. It is our collective conviction that the
additional time is necessary and our sincerest commitment that we will complete our
task by the end of Fiscal Year 1998, if given the means.

I would like to note that, as you may be aware, the Administration is supportive of the
one-year extension for the Review Board and has submitted an FY 1998 budget
amendment to allow us to complete our work, close out our operation, and submit our
final report.

Since the Review Board began this effort three years ago, we have witnessed the
widespread and passionate interest that the American public has in the assassination of
President Kennedy. We have received thousands of letters, telephone calls, faxes and
e-mail messages from individuals who care deeply about our history. They come from
all walks of life, from all over the country, and are of all ages. Their interest is of
varying degrees and they do notall agree on what happened in Dallas on November 22,
1963. However, they do agree that the public has the right to see the files on it
assassination.

I believe that what the Review Board is all about can be summed up ina letter we
received from a man from California just last week. The author is not a professional
historian, not a student working on a paper for a history class, but simply a private
citizen interested in learning about this tragic historical event. He wrote the following:

“In my humble opinion, it appears that the ARRB is having a healing effect

10


upon the American public, who may be coming to realize that there may be
closure in sight (in our lifetimes) with regard to the JFK assassination.”

These words capture why the Review Board was created by the Congress and why we
hope that the Review Board will have the additional year to complete our task.

The Assassination Records Review Board was conceived as a means of eliminating
uncertainty and speculation about the contents of government files relating to the
assassination of President Kennedy. We, the members of the Board, believe that a
premature termination of the Review Board would surely generate intensified doubts
within the general public about the commitment of Congress to release all information
that relates to the assassination of President Kennedy, as well as renewed speculation
about the conduct of our government and its institutions and personnel. If appropriate
closure is not reached now, the identical issues will likely have to be addressed again in
the future—at even greater cost. The additional year that we recommend will allow for
a confident conclusion of this important task. as

Mr. Chairman, and Members of the Subcommittee, on behalf of the members of the
Assassination Records Review Board, I thank you for allowing us this opportunity to
discuss our work and our future. We urge you to favorably report H.R. 1553. I would
be happy to answer any questions that the members of the Subcommittee may have for
me. The Board and staff stand ready to provide the Subcommittee with any additional
information that may be required. Thank you.

On November 22, 1963, 3 President John F. Kennedy was
nated. It was a tragic and defining moment in American histo.
The desire by the American un who

records were H.R. 4090, introduced January 3, 1992, and HLR. 4108,
introduced January 24, 1992. Two House resolutions directing the
unsealing of the records of the Select Committee on Assassinations
were H. Res. 825, introduced January 22, 1992, and H. Res. 326, in-
troduced January 24, 1992, °

The Committee shares shares the belief in the importance of disclosing
the records. It believes that all government records related to the
assassination of President Kennedy should be preserved for histori-
cal and governmental purposes; that all such records should carry

@ presumption of immediate disclosure; and that all such records
should be eventually dacosed to enable the public to become fully
informed about the surrounding the assassination.

The Committee also closely examined the issue of whether legis.
lation was necessary and concluded that it was. While disclosure of
the records could be achieved 8 non-statui tory approach—

. In addition, the Committee found that legislation is necessary be-

cause congressional records related to the assassination would not

otherwise be subject to public disclosure until at least the year

2029 (with uncertain disclosure of related classified executive

branch records); because the Freedom of Information 1 ore

mented by the Executive Branch, has impeded the timely

disclosure of the assassination records; Decause Executive Order

ment-wide schedules thee provented the timely public dicloure of

Seo. 11, Rules of construction.

(coction 11 sets forth the rules of construction regarding the stat-
ute.

When the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Col-
lection Act requires transmission of a record to the Archivist or

public disclosure, it js to take precedence over an of
(except section 6108 of the Ini Revenue Code), ju: decision
construing such law, or common law doctrine that would otherwise
prohibit such transmission or disclosure, with the exception of
deeds governing access to or transfer or release of gifts and dona-
tions of records to the United States Government.

Nothing in the statute is to be construed to eliminate or limit
any right to file requests with any executive agency or seek judicial
review of the decisions pursuant to section 552 of title 5, United
States Code, which is the Freedom of Information Act. .

Nothing in the law is to be construed to preclude judicial review,
under chapter 7 of title 5, United States Code, of final actions
taken or required.to be taken under the statute. :

Nothing in the law revokes or limits the existing authority of the
President, any executive agency, the Senate, or the House of Repre-
sentatives, or any other entity of the Government to publicly dis-
close records in its possession. _

Finally, to the extent that any provision of the statute estab-
lishes a procedure to be followed in the Senate or the House of
Representatives, such provision is adopted as an exercise of the
lemaking power of the Senate and House of Re, tatives, re-

‘ively, and is to be deemed to be part of rules of each -

use, respectively, but applicable only with respect to the proce-
dure to be followed in that House, and it supersedes other rul
only to the extent that it is inconsistent with such rules, and with
full recognition of the constitutional right of either House to
change the rules (so far as they relate to the procedure of thal
House) at any time, in the same manner, and to
in the case of any other rule of that House.

Sec. 12. Termination of effect of act.

The section provides that the provisions of the law that pertain-

to the appointment and operation of the Review Board cease to be
effective when the Review Board and the terms of its members
have terminated pursuant to section 7(0). The remaining provisions
of the law, however, continue in effect until such time as

chivist certifies to the President and the Congress that all assassi-
nation records have been made available to the public in accord-
ance with the statute. :

Sec. 19. Authorization of appropriations.

The section authorizes to be appropriated such sums as are nec-

to carry out the law, to remain available until expended.

appropriated pursuant to the forego-

ing proviso, the President is authorized to use such sums as are
available for discretionary use to carry out the law. :

Sec. 1h. Severability. .
Specification is made that, if any provision of the law or the a
plication thereof to m% circumstance i held invalid, the

any person or is
Temainder of the statute and the a ication of that provision to
other persons not similarly situa or to other circumstances is
not af by the invalidation. . .

Vil. REGULATORY IMPACT

Rule 26.11b of the Standing Rules of the Senate requires the
report accompanying each bill or joint resolution of a public char-
acter to contain an evaluation of the regula impact of the legis-
lation. The evaluation must include the four ents listed below.

1, An estimate of the number of individuals and businesses who
would be regulated and a determination of the ips and classes
of such individuals and businesses. S. 3006,
additional regulation to any individuals or businesses.

2. A determination of the economic impact of such regulation on
the individuals, consumers, and businesses affected. Not applicable.

_3. A determination of the impact on the personal privacy of indi-
viduals affected. S. 8006, establishes clear standards for the protec-
tion of persona] . Under Section 6(8), assassination records
may be p disclosure of the record could reasonably
be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal pri-
vacy, and that invasion of pri is so substantial that it out-
weighs the public interest” in disclosure. In addition, the applica-
tion of other n for disclosure may result in the postpone-
ment [under Section 6(1(A)] of “an intelligence agent whose ‘enti.

6(2)] of name or identity of a living person who provid-

cifically intended to reduce- the unwarranted or unreasonable
impact on the personal privacy of individuals in a manner consist-
emia the requirements for public disclosure of records by the
ion.

4. An estimate of the amount of additional paperwork that will
result from the regulations to be promulgated uant to the leg-
islation, including estimates of the amount of time and financial
cost required of affected parties, as well as reasonable estimates of
the Tecordkeeping requirement that may be associated with the
legislation. No itional paperwork is imposed on the public by S.
