FROM:

Executive Director

SUBJECT:

Appointment of Directorate Focal Points

for JFK Assassination Board Requests

1.

I would like each of you to appoint a focal point

officer for your Directorate who would be responsible for

responding to requests for information from the (President

Kennedy) Assassination Records Review Board.

(AIUO)

2. The Agency has received the first (attached) of what

are likely to be many requests from the Board for information

related to the assassination of President Kennedy and to the

investigations into the assassination.

Up to now, the Board

has focused on the "sequestered" records CIA had collected

for the House Assassination Committee's investigation and

documents that had been part of the Oswald 201 file. It is

expected that the new requests will require records searches

to be done for additional information.

(AIVO)

3. The Historical Review Group (HRG) of the Center for

the Study of Intelligence (CSI), which has been the Agency's

principal liaison with the JFK Board, will continue in that

HRG will receive requests from the Board, and then

forward them to the Directorate focal points for action.

Responses

from the Directorates will be coordinated by HRG,

which will make the responses available to the Board. (AIUO)

Please provide the name of your focal point officer to

John Pereira, Chief, HRG (x303737secure) by 13 April.

Dear John:

In order to facilitate and coordinate our efforts, I will be sending to you, from time-

to-time, requests for additional information and records to facilitate the completion of

the ARRB's responsibilities under the JFK Act. We will be numbering these requests,

as shown above, to help us track our queries and your responses. Please do not

hesitate to contact me or Jeremy Gunn if our requests are insufficiently clear or if

they are unduly burdensome.

For our first request, we ask that you make available the following items:

(a)

Comprehensive organizational charts (or the best available substitutes)

of the following entities for the years 1958-1968:'

First, the Directorate of Plans (DDP or DD/P) including:

Special Affairs Staff (DDP/SAS)

Task Force W

'We are of course aware that the names, organizational structure, and reporting

relationships of the entities identified below have changed over time. We have listed some

divisions, offices, and staffs in order to facilitate the identification of organizational charts. If

the Agency refers or referred to these entities by any other names or acronyms, we would of

course intend our request to include those other names or acronyms.
