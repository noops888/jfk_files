1975, against the Department of Defense and this Agency in the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of New York by Eugene B. Dinkin,
Mr. Dinkin is seeking damages based upon a belief that a Warren Commission
document (No. 943) entitled "Allegations of PFC Eugene Dinkin re: Assassina—
tion Plot" is a misrepresentation by GIA and DOD of the facts surrounding his
assertion in 1963 of prior knowledge of the assassination of President Kennedy...

- any files or records on Eugene B. Dinkin by 21 July 1975. Should there be
a delay in complying with this request or should you have any questions, please
