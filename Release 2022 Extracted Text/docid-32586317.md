of the possible locations where the telephone numbers could

in the Miami and Tampa, Florida areas.

Pretext used by SA JOHN P. MC GUIRE, Brunswick,

also disclaims any personal knowledge as to the past or

current membership of this organization.

TP T-21 stated that AL SCAGLIONE has inferred,

however, that if such an organization does exist, in the

Tampa area, then certainly, SANTO TRAFFICANTE would be the

head of any such organization.

On November 4, 1966, Assistant District Attorney

New York, advised that the

appearance of

County Court,

had been postponed from November

9, 1966 to

November 29, 1966, and that the postponement had been

necessitated by the incapacitation of one of the attorneys

representing one of the unidentified attendees.

On November 25, 1966, Chief Assistant District

Attorney, HOWARD CERNY, Queens

County, advised that at the

request of the attorney representing COLOMBO and MIRANDA,

he had requested a continuance from November 29 to December 16,

1966 .

On December 1, 1966, CERNY advised that on November 30,

1966, he had been informed by

Queens County Judge SHAPIRO,

that

he, CERNY, was instructed to inform the respective attor-

date of the hearing scheduled for December 16,

1966, had been changed to December 15, 1966, and that Judge

SHAPIRO had given no explanation for the changed date.

indicated that the attendees with the exception of GAMBINO,

will be ordered to show cause on December 15, 1966, why they

should not be punished for refusing to testify before the

Queens County Grand Jury, after being granted immunity.

D. MISCELLANDOUS

On November 17, 1966, TP T-13 advised that from

continual contact with the Tampa and nearby Polk County

criminal element, he is of the opinion that SANTO TRAFFICANTE's

brother, SAM, is

"Mr. Big" in Florida, and uses SANTO as a

front man. TP T-13 stated that he is of the opinion that

SANTO is on an expense account and is used to divert attention

from the TRAFFICANTE family activity in Tampa, and also to

handle any necessary travel. TP T-13 stated that years ago,

he had been engaged in the numbers racket in Polk County,

and was at that time, part of the TRAFFICANTE operation.

TP T-13 stated that he is on a first-name basis with SAM,

and has entertained SAM in TP T-13's home on several occasions

over the past few years.

Date

December 2, 1966

JACK PARRINO, 4701 Willis, was contacted at his

residence and an attempt was made to advise PARRINO of his

rights and an attempt was made to furnish him with a copy

of his rights for his signature and he refused to accept

the paper and refused to allow SA JOHN A. AMBLER advise

him of his rights.

PARRINO claimed that he was a very busy

man, that he was in the process of cleaning up, including

shaving and that he did not have time to talk to the FBI.

A photograph of ALBERT VALENTI, St. Louis,

Missouri Police Department Number 102329, taken November,

1965, was exhibited to PARRINO by SA AMBLER holding it in

his hand at approximately an arm's length from PARRINO as

PARRINO refused to hold the photograph in his hand. PARRINO

denied that he knew anyone named VALENTI from St. Louis,

Missouri and to the question did he knew anyone named

VALENTI from any locality other than Tampa, he shook his

head negatively. PARRINO at this point began to close the

door of his residence in SA AMBLER and SA PATRICK T. LAFFEY'S

face and therefore the interview was terminated.

• TP 92-1

On November 16, 1966, TP T-21 related that from

association with AL SCAGLIONE, he knows that AL SCAGLIONE

and his brother,

NICK, had formerly been involved in years

past, with SANTO TRAFFICANTE, but is fairly certain that

the SCAGLIONES no longer are a part of any TRAFFICANTE

gambling operation.

TP T-21 added that although TRAFFICANTE

does not appear to be the controlling figure in the active.

Tampa gambling, it is apparent that TRAFFICANTE himself,

gets a piece of the action, both from his brother, SAM's,

operation, and from an operation which is believed to be

that of TRAFFICANTE's associate, GINES "CALIFORNIA" RIVERO.

TP T-21 stated he is of the opinion that SANTO is more

active in other hoodlum activities than gambling, although

TP T-21 has no personal knowledge on which to base this

assumption.

TP T-21 identified TRAFFICANTE'S Tampa close

associate as JIMMY LONGO, and stated that in years past,

HARLAN BLACKBURN,

commonly known as

"The Colonel", was

active in the TRAFFICANTE organization, but that at present

time, there does not appear to be any association at all

between BLACKBURN in Orlando and any of the TRAFFICANTES,

including SANTO. TP T-21 stated that the rumor is that

BLACKBURN apparently fell out with TRAFFICANTE during the

period of time when SANTO was involved in the operation of.

gambling casinos in Havana, Cuba.
