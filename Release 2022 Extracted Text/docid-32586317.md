CANTE's person at the time of his arrest in New York during
9/66, until such time as Tampa completes a review as to all
of the possible locations where the telephone numbers could
exist, as it is believed that from some of the personal
notations made by TRAFFICANTE, they do not apply to indivi-
duals identified as subscribers to the same telephone numbers
in the Miami and Tampa, Florida areas.

Pretext used by SA JOHN P, MC GUIRE, Brunswick,

\ (2) HERMAN SOUTH

On November 16, 1966, TP T~10 advised that he knows

HERMA: UTH as a hoodlum in the Tampa, Florida area, but r
has wever heard it mentioned that SOUTH was involved finan-

cially in any endeavor in which SANTO TRAFFICANTE might also

have had an interest. ce . peo

On November 21, 1966, TP T-12 advised that from his
close association with liquor store operations in the Tampa, '
Florida area, he has never gained any information which would i
indicate that SANTO TRAFFICANTE, JR. and HERMAN SOUTH have |
| ever had any mutual financial.endeavor. TP T-12 stated that
he has never heard of either SOUTH or TRAFFICANTE being
involved in any wholesale liquor distributorship, and that
the only instance in which he is awarethat SOUTH was ever
involved in any type of retail liquor operation was that
of SOUTH's association with former night club operator,
BEN KOLSKY,

no recollection of ever having heard HERMAN SOUTH's name
mentioned in connection with any financial venture with SANTO

TP 92-1

individuals who were associated with TRAFFICANTE, TP T-17
stated he is certain that. HERMAN SOUTH has never been so
involved and since TRAFFICANTE returned to the United States
from Cuba during the beginning of the CASTRO regime, he,

TP T-17, has no personal knowledge that TRAFFICANTE has been
involved in any financial venture with SOUTH. TP T-17

added, however, that from his personal knowledge of TRAFFICANTE
and TRAFFICANTE's close associates, he feels that one of

the last persons that TRAFFICANTE would become involved with
would be a person like HERMAN SOUTH. TP T-17 related that he
has never heard anything concerning TRAFFICANTE that would
indicate that TRAFFICANTE has any financial investment of
any type in any liquor business, other than possibly being
involved in the ownership of the Dream Bar. °

On November 23, 1966, TP T-18 advised that from past
association with SANTO TRAFFICANTE, JR., and from present

never gained any indication that any of the TRAFFICANTEs have,
at any time, been involved in any financial venture with
HERMAN SOUTH, TP T-18 stated that he is not personally
acquainted with SOUTH, although he has, of course, heard of
SOUTH, and doubts that SANTO TRAFFICANTE, JR, has any inore
than a possible mere speaking acquaintance with SOUTH.

On November 23, 1966, TP T~20 advised that although
he is not presently closely associated with SANTO TRAFFICANTE,
he has, in the past, been closely associated with TRAFFICANTE,
and from such association, has absolutely no reason whatso-._
ever to believe that SANTO TRAFFICANTE would ever be involved
in any type of a financial venture with an individual having
the reputation such as HERMAN SOUTH.

On November 30, 1966, TP T-11 advised that from
his own personal acquaintance and association with SANTO
TRAFFICANTE and SANTO's brothers, and from his own associa-
tion with the liquor business, he is absolutely positive
that SANTO TRAFFICANTE has never been involved in any liquor
venture with HERMAN SOUTH. TP T~11 was also of the opinion
that TRAFFICANTE himself was not engaged in any financial
venture involving either a retail or wholesale liquor
organization. TP T-11 stated that SOUTH has a reputation
of being a "petty" hoodlum, and he does. not believe that
TRAFFICANTE would be in any way associated in any manner
with the likes of SOUTH.

C. LA COSA NOSTRA !

On October 26, 1966, TP T-14 advised that ART i
PRICE, true name, ARTURO MISURACA, continues to deny his
own membership in La Cosa Nostra, either in the past or the
present, and also continues to disclaim any personal know-
ledge concerning La Cosa Nostra, and has even gone so far as
to deny any personal knowledge that any of his brothers
have any affiliation with the La Cosa Nostra. TP T-14 added
that PRICE has given no indication of having recently been
in any type of contact with SANTO TRAFFICANTE, JR.

TP T~14 did state. that PRICE had recently been
visited by his brother, JOHN MISURACA, but gave no indication
that JOHN MISURACA is acquainted with SANTO TRAFFICANTE or
had any contact with TRAFFICANTE during JOHN MISURACA's
Stay in the Tampa, Florida area.

On November 16, 1966, TP T~15 advised that ANDRE
DANTE MAGRINI has made the claim that his father, who was a '
barber by trade, and who resided in New York, had been a
member of La Cosa Nostra, and was a "worker" or “button man", \
MAGRINI has mentioned that his father, although obviously ;
a lower echelon member of La Cosa Nostra, had told him prior
to his death that SANTO TRAFFICANTE, JR, was the highest
ranking La Cosa Nostra member in Florida.

On November 16, 1966, TP T-21 related that AL
SCAGLIONE, brother of SANTO TRAFFICANTE associate, NICK
SCAGLIONE, continues to disclaim that either he or his
brother, NICK, were ever members of La Cosa Nostra, and AL
also disclaims any personal knowledge as to the past or
current membership of this organization.

{TP T-21 stated that AL SCAGLIONE has inferred,
however, that if such an organization does exist, in the
Tampa area, then certainly, SANTO TRAFFICANTE would be the
head of any such organization,

On November 4, 1966, Assistant District Attorney
STEPHEN BURGIO, Queens County, New York, advised that the
appearance of the attendees of the La Cosa Nostra meeting
in Queens during September, 1966, before Judge, Queens
County Court, had been postponed from November 9, 1966 to

request of the attorney representing COLOMBO and MIRANDA,
he had requested a continuance from November 29 to December 16,

1966, he had been informed by Queens County Judge SHAPIRO,
that he, CERNY, was instructed to inform the respective attor-
neys that the date of the hearing scheduled for December 16,
1966, had been changed to December 15, 1966, and that Judge
SHAPIRO had given no explanation for the changed date. CERNY
indicated that the attendees with the exception of GAMBINO,
will be ordered to show cause on December 15, 1966, why they
should not be punished for refusing to testify before the
Queens County Grand Jury, after being granted immunity.

D, MISCELLANEOUS

On November 17, 1966, TP T-13 advised that from
continual contact with the Tampa and nearby.Polk County
criminal element, he is of the opinion that SANTO TRAFFICANTE's
prother, SAM, is "Mr. Big" in Florida, and uses, SANTO.as a
front man. TP T-13 stated that he is of the opinion that
SANTO is on an expense account and is used to divert attention
from the TRAFFICANTE family activity in Tampa, and also to
handle any necessary travel. TP T-13 stated that years ago,
he had been engaged in the numbers racket in Polk County,
and was at that time, part of the TRAFFICANTE operation.

TP T-13 stated that he is on a first-name basis with SAM,
and has entertained SAM in TP T-13's home on several occasions
over the past few years.

| association with AL SCAGLIONE, he knows that AL SCAGLIONE
and his brother, NICK, had formerly been involved in years.
past, with SANTO TRAFFICANTE, but is fairly certain that
the SCAGLIONEs no longer are a part of any TRAFFICANTE
gambling operation, TP T-21 added that although TRAFFICANTE
does not appear to be the controlling figure in the active
Tampa gambling, it is apparent that TRAFFICANTE himself,
gets a piece of the action, both from his brother, SAM's,
operation, and from an operation which is believed to be
that of TRAFFICANTE's associate, GINES "CALIFORNIA" RIVERO.
TP T-21 stated he is of the opinion that SANTO is more
active in other hoodlum activities than gambling, although
TP T-21 has no personal knowledge on which to base this
assumption.

TP T-21 identified TRAFFICANTE's Tampa close
associate as JIMMY LONGO, and stated that in years past,
HARLAN BLACKBURN, commonly known as "The Colonel", was
active in the TRAFFICANTE organization, but that at present
