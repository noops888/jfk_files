Peru.

This information was later confirmed by the Chilean

Undersecretary for Foreign Affairs who said that GARCIA told

the governor of Arica that he (GARCIA) was a Chilean journalist

and that he had forgotten his identification documents. GARCLA

was accompanied by the Chilean Communist Deputy, Luis VALENTE

Rossi, who vouched for GARCIA's story.

VALENTE tried to

The two were denied entry into Peru and thus did

dated 25 March 1963.

In another Document dated 25 March 1963 it was reported that

Alfredo GARCIA Almeyda, Second Secretary of the Cuban Embassy
