of anc, he actually scéems to be about 16-years old, He is of slight
stature, has cleancut features and frank grey eyes. He could mix with
any high school group and pass. unnoticed in small or large cities.

4. Me organized Action Sabotage’ teams: in the provinces’ with the
aid of Hans HENGLER, National Milit/ary Coordinator, who has since been|
arrested and reportedly undergoing torture in the headquarters of G-2
in Miramar, (Organization and Operations of these teams are the sub-
ject ofa following dispatch.) FARINAS described their supplies as

depleted. and outdated. He ited one example in which their fragmenta-

tion grenades are dates1952.and during the beach action in Pinar del
Rio when "Juanin"’ (PEREIRA). was: captured and shot, many of the grenades|
did. not explode, ‘Subject. laid the total failure of their defensive

_ operation to the grenade failures since they were attacKed.-by numbers
of militia who did not feel cover and*precautions were necessary after

they observed the first grenade failure.

5. They were also ‘having trouble with the last of their small
stock of "time. pencils” (Firing Device, demolition, M1). Subject,
using a ead pencil; demonstrated how they tested. the safety device
at. last minute ‘just before inserting the pencil in the. shape. charge.
‘In Some pencils the firing pins were faulty and were discarded.

6. Their: most Serious shortages at present are time pencils,
blasting caps and-small arms for personal defense. He described some f g
teams as working. in.cities and having old Springfield rifles as their
only weapon, .This was pointed out as a.double security hazard. since it;

‘could not be concealed by the. carrier on.an.‘operation and it jeopardize
their safehouses by’ its difficult.concealment. é

7._ FARINAS described their stock of explosives upon his departure]
as total of about 120 lbs throughout the Island, and much of this was
the inferior C-3 type; It is distributed roughly as “follows: 60 lbs
in Havana, 25 lbs in Matanzas, 25 lbs in Camaguey, 10 1bs in Oriente
with none in Pinar del Rio and Las Villas. Subject emphasized the
importancé of shipping ‘only the. C-4°type which is more. powerful and
safer to handle because it. is odorless and does not leave the. yllow
stain that: C-3 does.

8,. When queried .as_to where subject received his training with
demolitions he replied that his predecessor had passed on the basic
precautions, but since then they- trained the provincial teams by taking|
the U.S. War Department Demolitions manual and with the aid of HENGLER*
English language capabilities, translated sections and reproduced copie|
in Spanish for distribution to the outlying. provincial teams. :

9. Subject recalled the following operations during his. period:

a, DRE teams destroyed the Internatiojial Harvester Plant with
“White Phosphorous” incendiary charges. :

b. On 31 December 1961, they exploded a bomb in Santiago'de
f Cuba and during this action, ‘the brother (“Pedro”) of the
Provincial Chief of Action was captured.

c. In Havana Province, San Antionio de los Banos, during
April, an undetermined number of beef cattle were péisoned|
by a DRE Action team.” i

d. In Las Villas Province, Camajuani zone, DRE téams are

“10. Concerning PW activities, FARINAS explained that he :seldom
had an opportunity. to:participate, but that he was aware of the dis-
tribution of ‘the DRE organ, “Trinchera". These issues come out spora-
dically, about 10 to 15,000 per issuc for Havana and ‘Havana Province,
Only a few copies are carried out to-the provinces and they are fre-
quently reproduced locally. ‘The two largest and most. popular issues
those known as "Alberto MULLER” (DRE Secretary General ‘currently
imprisoned ‘at Boniato Prison in Oriente) and the “Juanin™ sssue
(dedicated to Juanin PEREIRA, shot by firing squad).
