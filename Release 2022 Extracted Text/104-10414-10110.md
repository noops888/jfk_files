The Station summary of the KDFACTOR Project security is
as follows: :

"There were no known problems of security relating to
the Project. In response to the Headquarters request, we have
reviewed all phases of the operation and believe that Project
security is sound. The Project assets have all been with us for
many years and have established themselves as respectable long-
time residents of the area. All five assets, four in one family
and one in another, are extremely security conscious and have
all been SGSWIRLED. The assets derive a substantial portion
of their livelihood from their Agency employment and would thus
lose a great deal if security factors ever necessitated a termina-
tion of their work for us, As an additional safeguard, the

o2(KDLITERAL and(KDABSINTHE operations are compartmented
from each other, and there has never been any indication that
either segment ofKDFACTOR knows of the other's existence",
a

o& The Headquarters desk has also reviewed the security of the
KDFACTOR Project and agrees with the Station that the security
is sound, In fact, as presently constituted, the(KDFACTOR
Project is well compartmented, and each of the two (SDEACTOR
photo Becenaueee DLITERAL an IABSINTHE) is ruirby long-
term assets who draw a minimum of suspicion in their operational
activities. Terminated assets could possibly expose the existence



of this project, but that seems unlikely from the Headquarters
review of terminated agents witting of present(KDF ‘ACTOR
operational activities. A Soviet investigation of property owner-
ship around the Soviet Embassy and their awareness that the
Soviet Embassy was under photographic surveillance in the past
gue result in a Soviet investigation of the activities and contacts

houses close to the Soviet Embassy, It is doubtful thatQKDABBEY-I's
activities, which do not inter-relate with the activities of the

oY*KDFACTOR agents, would in any way expose the(KDFACTOR

2. A brief history of the(KDFACTOR Project:

z
‘The(KDF ACTOR Project had its origins in the LIJERSEY
and LIPSTICK Projects, both active in the mid-1950}g. In 1959 after
the arrest of two LIPSTICK surveillance team members, it was decided
to break off the more sensitive, uncompromised LIPSTICK assets manning
and supporting two basehouses for photo surveillance of the Soviet Embassy,
These assets were consolidated with one photo basehouse against the Soviet
Embassy and one surveillance team from the LIJERSEY Project into anew ,
project (LIEMPTY), ,which was approved on 16 January 19$9?The LIEMPTY
Project, renamed thé ®DF ACTOR Project in 1971)Iconsisted of three photo
basehouses, two viewing the front of the Soviet Embassy (LIMITED and
LILYRIC) and one viewing the rear garden of the Soviet Embassy (LICALLA).
plus a mobile surveillance team (LIENTRAP) tied closely with the LIMITED
basehouse, which was the radio control point for dispatch of the LIENTRAP,

3h
In 159 the LIENTRAP surveillance vehicle and two team

members were arrested at the scene of a Cuban demonstration in Mexico
City. A Station review of the security implications of this incident stated
that it did not materially affect the security of the project nor expose any

of the LIEMPTY basehouse operations, (Note: As the basehouse operations
were comparimented, the only exposure possible from this incident would
have been of the LIMITED baschouse, which is no longer in existence, )

The LIEMPTY Project operated substantially as above until
the Warren Commission report was published in late 1964. In this publica-
tion was a picture of a person entering the Soviet Embassy taken from the
LIMITED basehouse. The LIMITED photo basehouse was closed in Sept-
ember 1964, and all photographic surveillance was suspended as a.security
precaution. In January 1965 the LIMITED basehouse was relocated, and

HERABSINTHE (formerly LILYRIC) photo basehouse is owned outright by

KDABBEY-1, who has been most cooperative in assisting the Station in
maintaining and occasionally moving (1965 and Long aves basehouses,

ne

later that year the building it had previously been in was razed by the
owners ABBEY-l. From 1964 on it must be assumed that the Soviet
Embassy in Mexico City believes it is under regular photographic sur-
veillance,

_ Further project changes took place in 1966 when the LILYRIC
basehouse was relocated to another apartment with approximately the
same view. In May 1968 the LIMITED basehouse was terminated and
LIEMPTY-6, the basehouse keeper, retired. This affected the LIENTRAP
coverage of Soviet vehicular movement monitored and directed from the
LIMITED basehouse. With the closing of LIMITED and the Station decision
to replace Raymond H. GERENDE, Mexican national contract agent who
handled the LIEMPTY Project since its inception, the LIENTRAP mobile
surveillance team was underemployed, and the decision was made to move
it to the LIEMBRACE Project. This was done in early 1970}"soon after
GERENDE had been relieved of operational responsibilities in December
1969.

rr :
The photo processing of the «DFACTOR (formerly LIEMPTY)

film take is now being done by the Station. In the past, it was done by
the Station, by GERENDE, and by KDFACTOR-1,,awho was terminated
amicably in early 194)°? The building housing the KDLITERAL (formerly

house for FID's AULT Project. The apartment building housing the

The LIMITED photo basehouse was also located on BBEY-l's property
when it was active. z

The individual basehouse operations are and have always been
compartmented one from the other. The only points of breakdown in the
compartmentation have been: (a) the LIMITED basehouse was linked to
the LIENTRAP mobile surveillance; (b)*&DF ACTOR-1 was processing
films from all the basehouses and could, therefore, be aware, of their
exact locations; (c) GERENDE was aware of all aspects of the Q@DFACTOR
operation, and has since been terminated; (d) Oliver G, SCANTLING,

4, Terminated Agents Possibly Affecting Present Project Security:
A, Raymond H. GERENDE

GERENDE is a Mexican citizen and was a contract agent
until his termination,gn 26 June 1g@dyp? He had been employed by the Station
intermittently since 1965)and was used almost exclusively in support activities,
Since the start of the LIEMPTY Project in 1959), ERENDE had been directly
involved with this project serving as cutout to thé basehouses, carrying and
processing films, and giving general direction to the project as principal
agent. In 1969)after years of excellent service with the Station, GERENDE
had serious marital problems which ended in separation from his wife,

ot(KDFACTOR-7. From December 1969)fo June 1970)GERENDE was not used
operationally but was maintained on half pay-with the hope the divorce pro-
ceedings would be completed quickly. When it became apparent the divorce
would drag on interminably, the Station reluctantly terminated GERENDE
and his wife. Bruce H. FERNALD, career agent, met with GERENDE
monthly from July 1204 rough May 1994 hile paying him his termination
bonus in ten installments. GERENDE is still living in Mexico City, where
he owns some property and has an income as an English teacher to employees
of two local firms. He visited his wife and children in Holland in December
1970, It appears he may now be financially pressed as his Epglish class
schedule has been cut back, The Station as of 10 April 1972) lad no informa-
Gion that would indicale GE RENDE has viokued his secrecy agreement,

There is an indication that GERENDE came to the attention
of the Soviets in 1968. A Mexican walk-in to the FBI office in Mexico City,
who was later interrogated by the Federal Security Police in 1970, said
that in 1968 he had been employed by the Soviet Embassy Second Secretary,
Oleg Masksimovich Nechiporenko (201-305870), to investigate persons
working with the Mexican Olympic Committee. The persons investigated

lp] SECRET


- an]

included GERENDE, who apparently became a Specific target of Soviet
investigation. It is unclear from the report of the Federal Security Police
how far the Soviet investigation of GERENDE had proceeded, Nechiporenko
was PNG'd from Mexico in March 1971, GERENDE's possible exposure to
the Soviets could have been through his work on the Olymipic Committee as
a translator or through his work for the Station, which used him for a wide
range of support tasks against the Soviet and Cuban targets.

on
B. GDFACTOR-7 (wife of GERENDE)

oz
&DFACTOR-7 is a Dutch citizen and the former wife of
GERENDE. She returned to the Netherlands in July 1970 with her children.
She had served as a support agent assisting GERENDE. She is believed
witting, in general terms, of GERENDE's activities regarding the KDEACTOR
Project. She was terminated on 26 June. 1970)Shd signed both a secrecy
agreement and quit claim. After termination it became apparent that she
had considerable hard feelings toward both the Agency and GERENDE over
financial problems between her family and GERENDE. While the Station
was not directly involved in all the financial problems, the Station was
involved in regard to her divorce claims against GERENDE's salary, a
large part of which came covertly from the Station. In July 1970 @DEACTOR-'
came to the Agency Headquarters and complained about her financial settle-
ment, In September and November 1970 she wrote two letters directly to
the Agency on the same subject. In late 1970 she also asked a Hague Embassy
political officer to put her in contact with the Agency; however, she did not
tell him the nature of her business, In January 1971 the Agency contacted
°2(KDFACTOR-T's brother, a U. S. Army civilian with a "Top Secret" clearance
living in Alexandria, Virginia, and was able to resolve the financial mis-
understandings with(KDFACTOR-7. In January 1971(fhe Hague Station 19-6
reported(KDFACTOR had, withoutGtation)influence, “obtained.a job as/social
secretary with the Department of Stafé &t the Embassy, . It is believed that
this job has probably solved many-of her financial problems and should also
inhibit her from exposing her past work with the Mexico City Station, as
such exposure could jeopardize her job, The Embassy in the Hague was
briefed in general terms on KDE ACTOR-7's background,

Project. Je

F. LIEMPTY-6

LIEMPTY-6, 2 Mexican cilizen and long-term Station
asset, was retired in May 1968. He had manned the LIMITED photo base-
house with his wife and son assisting him, He had been working with the
Station since 1954pAbut age and ill health had reduced his efficiency.
LIEMPTY-6 knows GERENDE and SCANTLING, but is not aware of the
names or locations of any of the preset K)FACTOR agents and basehouses,
While he could give information on his participation in ‘ACTOR activities
up to 1968, he has no motive to do this and is apparently happily retired on
his Agency termination bonus plus some financial assistance from his son-
in-law. He is not considered a threat to the security of this Project.

There was one indication that the Soviets were seeking
out the LIMITED photo basehouse ayd may-have had suspicions concerning
LIEMPTY-6. This was a report by(KDADAGE-10 that in mid-1966 Stanislav
Sergeyevich Silnikov (201-271103), a Soviet Embassy guard, asked KDADAGE
10 to report on his neighbors near the Soviet Embassy. Silnikov expressed
interest in all the occupants of the new apartment building which houses the

e2{KDABSINTHE photo basehouse, but did not mention the(XDABSINTHE base-

house keepers by name, Silnikov did name specific persons he was inter-
‘ested in and these included LIEMPTY-6.°“KDADAGE-10, of unknown
reliability, said he did not give Silnikov any information, but added that,
between himself and the Station, he suspected LIEMPTY-6 and had heard
it rumored he worked for the Americans. In 1966 Headquarters already
assumed the Soviets were aware of the LIMITED basehouse because it was
used for radio direction of the LIENTRAP mobile surveillance. In any case,
the Soviets apparently took no action prior to the closing of the LIMITED
basehouse and the relocation of LIEMPTY-6 in May 1968. It is believed
this incident has no implications that would threaten the security of current
(KDFACTOR assets,

5, Current &DFACTOR Security Practices:
od ot
The two photo basehouses, (KDLITERAL and(KDABSINTHE
remain compartmented, as they have been throughout the history of the
Project.,, The Station case officer responsible for the project meets weekly *
withKDFACTOR-2, responsible for the (DLITERAL basehouse, and with

02 (KDFACTOR-5, responsible for thé KDABSINTHE basehouse. In these

meetings he picks up the product, provides new.supplies, pays salaries

and handles miscellaneous administrative matters. These are car meetings
usually held in early morning or at night and the pickup points are changed
regularly. Meeting time is kept to a minimum and meetings are pre-
scheduled whenever possible. The photographic product is processed in

the Station, thus increasing the security and timeliness of its handling

over the past practice of having (KDFACTOR-I process it in his office,
darkroom. The case officer only’meets with EDF ACTOR-2 and KDFACTOR
however, in emergencies other witting family members of either basehouse
can be contacted and met. In case the present sites or personnel are com-
promised, the Station has rented another apartment in the building housing
the BSINTHE basehouse and has installed members of the GDCALVERT
Project‘as residents, This new apartment offers as good a vantage point
