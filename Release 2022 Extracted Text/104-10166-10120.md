MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, WH/COG

SUBJECT: James C. Wray,

1, Lealled Mr. James C. Wray today to determine his reason
for having called the Agency on 27 February regarding Antonio CUESTA
Del Vallets patent application. At that time Wray had stated that as a
patent attorney he was representing CUESTA who had an application
pending on which some $140 in fees was due. :

2. Wray advised that he had been retained by CUESTA several
years ago to file an application c* neerned with a high speed boat on
Thich a patent was ready to issue upon payment of $140 in filing fees.

He stated further that as a consequence of CUESTA's subsequent capture
“tne had been unable to communicate with him, and that he had failed in his
efforts to interest CUESTA's friends in assuming responsibility for the
fees. Wray readily accepted my representations that the Agency had no
- responsibility in the matter. According to him, he had called us inerely

=as a matter of last resort. : : 5 ie

“9. Zfound Wray's description of the boat's configuration and
attributes to be interesting. While emphasizing that we had no re~
sponsibility for ais client's present situation or for his fees, I suggested
that he might want to provide me with the boat's specifications, Wray
- accepted this-suggvetion, My thought here was that an item of this nature
~ might be of interest to SOD/Maritime Branch. : :

the hit-and-run raid conducted in Havana Harbor ares in November
1965. In this connection, you requested our comments relative to any
past or current interest this Agency might have bad or has in Antonio

ef prosecution would be detrimental to {ts operations. In addition, you
also requested to be advised whether this Agency has of over had an
Operational interest in Jorge MAS Canosa or his anti-Cactro organi-
sation, the Cuban Represemation In Exile (RECE).

‘This Agency hoc no present operational interest in CUESTA. or
