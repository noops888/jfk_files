1. Nooting /Tine/Place/ Purpose. This moeting was held
in the offices roa fO until 1130 and from 1230
until 1515. Lunch was taken at the office. It is noted that

2. Details of veoting.

a. Alberto BLANCO Romariz - Through a telephone call
to AMLASH72 In Madrid, ABWHIP/1 determined that BLANCO vas
4n fact "El Loco Blanco", who was exyected some time last
Spring to bring out a message from AMLASH/1. This rested
our minds somewhat as it had been thought that it wes
possible Alberto BLANCO Rozmariz might have been a DGI
attempt to establish the fact beyond doubt that AMLASH/1
was in touch with KUBARK. AMWHIP/1 was instructed to pro~
ceed with caution in any discussions with BLANCO, and not
to acknowledge the fact that he and AMLASH/1 were in fact
in touch with KUBARX. This restriction could be changed
at he -was ‘éertain of BLANCO's bona fides and checked with
the Station first. (See cable traffic in AMWHIP/1 and

- AMLASH/1 files.)

7 was usual]; Bogert Bert or
q *Coamunist, friendly to AMLASH/1, a friend of ‘AMLASH/2's

Counselor of the Cuban Embassy, Madrid. According *

j + to AMWHIP, ALVAREZ who was usually known by his first

} of what it had done to Cuba. AMiHIP stated he had

{ of Hava wn queried, s

» Who was mentioned in the operational traffic
from Madrid as being fully witting of AMLASH's Plans
(this according to statement by Aéberto BLANCO in Madrid).
AMWHIP stated he thought he knew a Luis SOTO but did not
recall any details about the man, nor could he identity
this man with the Subject Luis SOTO.

d. A Letter from Jose de Jesus JINJAUMA to Carlos
ZARRAGA etter In question was received by GA
from JINJAUMA, stated that certain dissident and pri-
marily DR types vere ready to take action against Castro
provided their personal safety and future means of sub-
| Sistence were guaranteed. It named AMWHIP/1's friend i

Marcelo (Marzo) ARTIME Vega as the channel for trans= 4

i of AMWHIP/1 and AMLASH/1, AMWHIP/1 may be allowing
| AMLASH/1 the benefit of the doubt in this case.)
5’ AMWHIP/1 stated that he mew all of the poople in
: at 4 the letter except Captain (fnu) GIRON. He stated
i 6 v that it had been quite likely for JINJAUMA to write
| Carrs to%allerrotta as thoy had been, as vere all the
i fe? ethers mentioned in the letter, had-eeen menbers of
i ™ a the old VIR group which functioned as a counter
(\., “terrorist element against Batista’s first regime circa
y 1944, AMVHIP/1 stated that, in fact, Fidel Castro
ta himself had been a member of the UIR. AMWHIP further
S statod that there was no dcubt in his mind that Fidel,
Imoving these men as he did, was well aware of their
antagonism towards his regime. Other members of the
VIR which AMWHIP/1 could recall were as follows:

| ¢,, Marin DAPICO Antonio ‘
Gunde! Rerninio Haz (friend of AYMEGEIRAS)
Laureano ALVAREZ (presently in N.Y.C., Tel. LUdlow
90209)

Armando CORREA (presently in Miami)

Jesus DIEGUEZ (presently in Miami)

two PARSONS brothers (presentiy in Miami -
Other data unknown)

| ZARRAGA of course was also a member of the UIR. AMWHIP/1
stated that the most influential menbers of this group
were had been JINJAUMA, Fernandes de 1s CAMARA,
Billik: , and possibly Marin DAPICO. AMWHIP/1 stated
that these people were action types and were reasonably
close3#-knit so far as their loyalty to each other and
in ture the organization was concerned.

@. AMWHIP/1 was also asked to elicit from AMLASH/2
any information which the latter might have concerning
Cuban officials with their bands "in the till" or other-
| wise knocking down on the Government, and/or putting money
i away in foreign banks.

3. Finances.

AMWHIP/1 was given a token gift of a box of 50 cigars
in appreciation for the amount of time he freely devotes to
KUBARK business. He reluctantly accepted the sum of $500 against
his ops exrenses in the past and for the coming trip to Europe.
It was thought, by the wagy mat A $1000 or more would have been

a much more realistic figure to have given him, Howeverg as he
bas alvays in the past, he is reluctant to accept money for i
his services or for his expenses inc :rred. on. KUBARX's behalf. i
He did admit, however, that he would probably again be touched i
for a "lean" by AMLASH/2 and as he laughingly stated these “loans” }
Weta habitually (2>:.4/ forever. We also estimated that the 5
various transocsi ong Calis he has made in his. bebslt, the. 2
expenses he will incur in entertaining AMLASH/2, Robe: BLANCO,
UNSNAYU/19 and others will easily exceed the $500 he has ry
advanced. A signed receipt was obtained. .

4. Securit Glbate
There wore no incidents of a security nature to report :

as stated above. There were very few people in the offices due
to the fact that today was You Kippgr.
