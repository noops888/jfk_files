COMMISSION ON CIA ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE UNITED STATES
Washington, DC 20500

. April 15, 1975
MEMORANDUM

TO : The File
FROM : David W. Belin

SUBJECT : Interview with Secretary Robert McNamara

Belin: Secretary McNamara, we've had a brief interview

in your office on - late this afternoon - which
is April 15, 1975, and I have asked you a number of questions
and you have given me your best recollection for your answers,
and I'd like to get a summary of our discussion on this tape
and then send you a transcript for your editing, and then we
will either prepare an affidavit or perhaps we will still ask
you to come before the Commission, but I understand it is your
preference not to testify formally before the Commission,
because of the nature of your present job. Is that correct?

McNamara: That is correct. I wish to cooperate with the
Commission in every way. If necessary, of course,

I would testify before them, but I would much prefer to present

whatever information I have in the form of an affidavit.

B: Fine. During the Administration of President
Kennedy, .you were Secretary of Defense. Is that

correct?

Mi That is correct.

Br And were you Secretary of Defense commencing at the

time of the inauguration of President Kennedy?

M: Yes. Starting January 20, 1961.

B: And you were Secretary of Defense throughout the
Kennedy Administration. Is that right?

M: I was.

Bs -~and into the Administration of Lyndon Johnson.

M: until approximately March 1, 1968.

B: During that time you were personally close with both

the President and his brother, Robert Kennedy, is
that correct?

B: And you also were close to McGeorge Bundy?
M: Yes.
Br. ° AS I understand it there was what I am going

to call a “camaderie" in the relationship among
some of the top people in the Kennedy Administration.

M: Yes. That is correct.

B: At any time during the Kennedy Administration did

you hear any person ever discuss a plan known as
an “executive action plan" which in substance was defined i
as a capability plan for possibly assassinating any foreign
leader?

ever
M: I have no recollection of/hearing anyone discuss
such a plan.
B: Did you ever hear anyone. discuss any particular

plan concerning the possible assassination of
Castro in Cuba?

M: No. I have no recollection of such a discussion.

Br Did you everserve in any group known as either
the MONGOOSE group or the Special Group Augmented?
Does that ring a bell with you?

M: No. You mentioned, if I may refer back to our fp
previous conversation, that I was present atleast

one or more meetings of the Special Operations Group, I believe

you called it. I have no recollection of being present at

the meeting. I'm not suggesting I wasn't, but I have no

recollection of it. I do seem to recall that there was such

a group, I doubt very much if I was a’'member of it.

Br You might have been a participant at one or more
of these meetings?

M: I might have been a participant.
B: At any such meetings, did you ever hear anyone

discuss as a possibility the question of possibly
assassinating Castro or any other foreign leader?

M: _No. I should interject here another point I made
earlier, as IT have no notes -- |I did not take notes of
any meetings I attended with rare exceptions, fand I have

no other basisfor refreshing my memory and my memory of those

years is very bad. I'm not saying this to in any way qualify
what I am saying except that it is a fact that my memory is
poor in relation to the period.

Br I asked you whether or not Robert Kennedy ever had
any such discussions with you and you indicated no,
is that correct?

M: --indicated two things. - First that I have no re-

collection whatsoever of him ever having discussed
assassination of anybody with me--or whatever you called it--
the executive .-~

B: executive action capability --

M: ‘executive action capability. Moreover, it is in--
conceivable to me that he would have discussed
such an action with me because I think he would have felt
that it endangered the Presidency and I believe he would
have had moral reasons for not supporting any such action
by the Government of the United States, end I base both of
those points on my appraisal of his evaluation of the Bay of
Pigs and the extent to which it weakened the presidency and
the ability of the President to govern and his behavior
during the Cuban missile crisis when he strongly opposed
action which he considered contrary to the moral traditions
of this society.

B: Do you have any other comments with regard to this

whole question of possibly assassinating foreign
leaders?
M: You told me that you understand a plan to assassinate

: one or more foreign leaders was in existence for
an extended period of time, during 1961-2-3. I said (a) I

have no recollection of any such plan, (b) I find it very
difficult to believe that if sucha plan had existed its
existence wouldn't have been known to the' top officials of

the CIA, and certainly if I had known of it TI am positive I
would have made my knowledge known to the President ,4Robert
Kennedy, neither of whom obviously can testify now, bet to

Mac Bundy, to my deputy, Ros Gilpatric, and probably to

Dean Rusk, and I would strongly urge that you check those

three individuals. In addition, Max Taylor was very close

to Robert Kennedy at the time. He was brought in by President
Kennedy to examine the decision-making process of the Government
that could have led to such a failure as the Bay of Pigs.

He was very~-Max was very close to both Robert Kennedy and

the President at the time. He was very close to the whole

‘problem of Cuban relations. He played a major part in the
Cuban missile crisis discussions because of his association
with the Kennedys and his work with the Bay of Pigs follow-on.
So T would urge you to talk to him about this as well. And
iff Mac didn't know about it, and Max doesn't know about it
and Dean Rusk doesn't and Ros Rilpatrick doesn't and I have
no memory of it, I very much doubt that any such plan was
known to the top officials of the Kennedy Administration.

B: Well, assume for the moment that one of those people

did know about such a plan, and assume for the

moment.that the CIA documents show that such a plan might
“have been directed to be instituted by someone in the White
House, who in.the White House do you think would have had

‘the authority to institute such a plan?

M: Well, I have said before that I felt the attacks
on the CIA -- CIA's covert operations, were unjustified
insofar as they assessed the primary responsibilities for
those operations against the senior officials in CIA and
absolve the rest of the senior officials in the Government
of responsibility. I said that because it was my experience
that all major CIA operations were approved by a gnoup that
subsequently became known as the 303 Group. I don't know
what it was called during its early period, whteh)included
’ yepresentatives of the -- the highest level representatives --
of the Secretaries of State and Defense, as well as the
President's Security Adviser.

EB: That was Mr. Bundy.

M: That was Mr. Bundy, during the period you are

talking about, sethat I am almost certain that
were an assassination contemplated, which.seems to me, as I say,
extremely unlikely, if it were contemplated or any action been
taken to move in that direction, it would have had to have
received the approval of not just Mr. Bundy but other .
officials at that same level, including my Deputy, I think, and &
Deputy never would) have approved anything like that without
discussing it with me.

B: What. you. are saying--at least if it came through
the White HOuse, certainly Mr. Bundy would have -
known about it.

Mr Z think he would have both known about it, and IT
don't believe. that he would have approved it. by

himself. I think it would have been discussed with Dean

Rusk and me or my deputy and Dean Rusk's undersecretary.

B: And if Mr. Bundy did not know about it, then the

only other person in the White House that might
have known about it, I assume, would have been the President.
Is that a fair statement?

M: That's a fair statement but I think that's extremely
unlikely. I can't imagine that anything relating

to the CIA operation of this kind would be known to the

President and not Mr. Bundy. JI never knew of any such thing.

B: So if it would have been known to Mr. Bundy it wonld ha
been known to the President. And vice versa?

M: No, nono. I didn't say that, I said I couldn't
imagine anything relating to’'a CIA_operation that wes

known to the President and was not known to Mr. Bundy. I can |

imagine somethingswith respect to CIA known to Mr. Bundy,

not known to the President either because they weren't that

important or conceivably because it was thought desirable

to protect the President from certain knowledge.

B: With regard to the --

M: If I may -- add one word to that. I can't imagine
Mr. Bundy himself supporting assassination. I

can't imagine him supporting assassination of a foreign

leader, without mentioning it to the President, even though

“to do so would by that action involve the President. I say

I can't imagine him supporting assassination of a foreign
leader without the President's knowledge because it is the .
President who would pay if that action were undertaken and it
ever became known. Mr. Bundy recognized, more than the rest

of us, the importance of protecting the Presidency as well as

a particular president, and particularly protecting his ability
to govern.

B: I want to correct one thing on the record. You
referred to my statement about one or more assassi-

nation plans. The only particular plan’ of assassination that

you and I discussed that I said I knew anything about as to

be concrete affirmative plans involved just Castro. I said

there might have been indirect involvement in one other area, but

the only direct involvement thus far that I know of at this

time and that I discussed with you pertained to Castro. i

M: Yes, yes, you are quite right.

B: Anything else you want to add for the record?

M: No, except I'm horrified by the whole discussion,

Shocked by it and I just hope you will pursue all
these leads some of which you may already have--I am saddened
by it too. :

B: As a citizen I am horrified by it and I am saddened
by it, that my country which at one time became the

land of the free and the home of the brave would be involved

in situations of this kind, but we are trying to find out

what the facts are and hopefully it will not happen again.

Thank you very much, Sir.

M: Thank you.

COMMISSION ON CIA ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE UNITEO STATES
Washington, DC 20500

MEMORANDUM

To : The File
FROM : David W. Belin

SUBJECT : Interview with General Maxwell Taylor

Belin: General Taylor, we're here on the 16th day of May ‘

1975 at the offices of the CIA Commission in Washington
and I have had an opportunity to review with you certain mat- .
ters relating to your participation during the Kennedy Adminis—
tration in matters involving Cuba, and I've asked you a number
of questions and we've talked informally and now what I would
like to do is to have it in question and answer form. Is that
correct?

Taylor: Right.

B: All right. First of all, you might tell me when you
came down to Washington to first serve with the Kennedy
Administration in 1961.

T: I came down at the end of April at the invitation of

the President to chair a group of four in the investi-
gation of the Bay of Pigs--to analyze the causes of its failure
and why it failed and whatever lessons that we decided the Presi-
dent--should be called to the President's attention. My collea-
gues were Bob Kennedy, Allen Dulles and arleigh Burke. We worked !
on that report from the--the end~-through the end of April and
May--as I recall they got a final report to the President some—
what after the middle of June.

B: All right. If we can stop this tape a minute, I think
I have a document upstairs which will give us the exact

date which it was done. So I'm going to stop the tape now and

check to see if it's recording and then I'll be right back down.

I'm going to continue now, General Taylor, and according to the
notes I have you report~-your memory is very good, by the way,
for events that took place nearly fourteen years ago--your re—
port was dated June 13, 1961 by way of a letter sent to Presi-
dent Kennedy, and it refers to an April 22, 1961 letter from
President Kennedy to you directing you, together with Robert
Kennedy, Admiral Arley, Burke, and Allen Dulles as Director of

Central Intelligence, to undertake a study with regard to the
Bay of Pigs, and also certain recommendations. According to
this document, President-elect Kennedy--or President Kennedy--
first learned about the existence of plans for the overthrow
of the Castro Government because of the call on him at Palm
Beach by Allen Dulles and Richard Bissell, who was the Deputy
Director of Plans of the CIA and who had overall coordinating
supervision of the Bay of Pigs operation, and according to ©
your--the document that you prepared which I assume was based
upon your study of the facts, that the first formal briefing
of President Kennedy was on January 28, 1961 with Vice Presi-
dent Lyndon Johnson, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of
Defense, Director of Central Intelligence, Chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff and others present at that briefing.
Does that sound like perhaps it might be accurate so far as
to what the events were?

Tr It sounds correct. Obviously T don't recall speci-
fically the details you mentioned.

B: I also noted that one section which I happened to note
had language along the lines of this. It said "We also

feel that the occasion offers the President the opportunity to

express to his principal assistants and advisers his sense of

the need of a changed attitude on the part of the Government

and of the people toward the emergency which confronts us. The

first requirement of such a charge is to recognize that’ we are

in a life-death struggle which we may be losing and will lose —

unless we change our way and marshall our resources with an in~
tensity--(I can't read my own writing here)--intensity associated
in the pase iy times of war." And then the remaining part of

the paragraph it said the Director of Central Intelligence had
not participated in it says "To effect this change we must give
immediate consideration to taking such measures as announcement
of a limited national emergency, the review of any treaties or
international agreements which restrain the full use of our.re-
sources in the cold war and the determination to seek the respect
of our neighbors without the criterion of international popularity
and the policy being taken into account the proportioning of
foreign aid to the attitudes shown us by our neighbors. In the
light of the strained situation in Laos and the potential crisis
building up over Berlin, we should consider at once affirmative
programs to cope with the threat in both areas. I don't know

if you remember that that- might have been part of it at all

or not? :

T: Well, yes. Again, I don't recall the specific language,
but I would say that was rather consistent with our
frame of mind. This was not the height--at least one of the high
points--in the Cold War and the Khruschev threat on Berlin was
very much on our minds, the question of whether Castro and the

activities in the Caribbean were related in any way to the
pressure being placed on Berlin. All these things were in our
mind, plus the fact that we had demonstrated in the Bay of Pigs
operations that here in Washington we just had never thought
through the problem of utilizing resources from numer-~several
departments for purposes such as this--the Cold War purposes.

B: Now, during the time that you prepared this paper,

were you aware of any assassination plots against
the lives of Castro or anyone else that might have been under-
taken by the CIA?

T: I was not.

B: Were you ever aware of the existence of any plans to
assassinate Castro?

T: I was not.

B: Did you ever have any discussions with either the

President or the Attorney General or the Director
of Central Intelligence, concerning the possibility or the
existence of plans to assassinate Castro--either the possi-
bility or the existance?

T: Certainly not with the President. Now in the case of

Bob Kennedy and Allen Dulles we talked about so many

things during the Bay of Pigs as one sits around the table, [

couldn't say that--that the desirability of the disappearance

“of Castro or what would happen if he were assassinated in Cuba
--that was not raised, I don't recall.

B: You don't recall any specific conversation one way
ox the other?

T: No.

Br Did you ever have any conversations with McGeorge Bundy
or Walt. Rostow about it?

T: No. None of those officials. Again, under the same
terms as I indicated in the case of Bob and Allen Dulles,
that they -- in the course of the daily work, we see men constantly

and you're thinking so much about the Cuba problem, I couldn't
Say that assassination in the abstract--"Wouldn't it be a nice
thing if someone bumped Castro off"+-that could well have been
said, but I just don't recall it.

B: Do you recall the existence of any approval to have
the CIA undertake such a --

T: Never!”

B:. Did you ever hear the phrase “executive action
capability" which was defined as a standby capability

of assassinating foreign leaders. Did you ever hear

T: ~cthat's a code phrase, meaning like you indicate?

B: Well, a phrase called and which refers to the capability
of assassinating foreign leaders?

T: No.

B: Now, you also told me that you attended a meeting of

the Special Group (Augmented) that occurred on or
about August 10, 1962 at the Department of State.

T: I assumed that I did, I don't specifically remember ©
that date or what the agenda might be, but by looking

at the documents you have shown me I was the Chairman of the

Mongoose aspect of the Special Group and I assume I was there.

B: General Lansdale worked with you?

T: He did.

B: In what capacity?

T: He was in charge of putting together a feasible programs

--program or programs--which would include ways and means of
restraining Castro. We were very much concerned whether in
the ebullience of victory at the Bay of Pigs he might not intan-
sify a campaign already begun as a matter of fact, to infiltrate
agents in Latin America, as the saying was, to export Communism
‘to Latin America, so we were thinking of ways and means and pro-
grams that might be devised to prevent that.

B: Do you have any recollection of what might have been
said at a meeting that might have occurred in August

of 1962?

T: No. I couldn't recall any specific meeting. If you

had the minutes or something I'm sure it might suggest

B: Do you have any recollection as to whether or not
someone at that meeting might have raised the possi-
bility of the liquidation of Castro?

T: Well, as you say, it might have possibly occurred, it
might possibly have occurred, but if it did, I don't
recall it.

B: Do you recall any conversations that might have occurred
at any such meeting?

stimulate my memory.

Bi How long did you stay in Washington in your service |
with the Kennedy Administration?

T: Well I stayed in the White House as the Military

Representative of the President in which capacity I
was generally his alter ego if you will for military and intel-
ligence matters. On October 1, 1962 he designated me to become
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and moved out of the
White House and gave up the White House~related position.

B: You took over from General Lemnitzer?
T: Yes.
B: And then you remained as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs

of staff until when?
T: Until -July 1964 when I went to Vietnam as Ambassador.

B: Do you have any information that you think might in

any way be relevant to the investigation of this Com-
mission so far as possible unlawful domestic activities of the
CIA is concerned?

T: No, I really don't, except as I mentioned to you before
we started to tape this that there was a mass of Cubans
_in the United States based generally in the Miami area who cer-
tainly had many of them there who would like to see Castro dead
and would be--would have been very happy to collaborate with
getting him that way. Whether or not, conceivably low-level CIA
agents, as is sometimes the case, overzealous subordinates ever
encouraged any or talked to them or made any propositions to them,
I don't know, but clearly it's a possibility. But I certainly
never saw anything in my relations with the senior CIA officials
to suggest that they this as a proposition, as something they
were recommending or supporting or advising the President to do.
