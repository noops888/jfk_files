MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Contact with Department of Justice

On 4 November 1975 I was called by Mr. Ron Malone (phone 187 - 4637),

one of the three people from the bepartmens, of Justice who were brieted

on cl Project matters by Nr. Usikerdanos Jand me. Before returning his

call, I checked with Mr? Isikerdanos office (he was on a TDY) and

• (Mr: 0'Re1119, CI/EXO. Mr. O'Reilly) Instructed me to refer Mr. Malone

• Mr.. Haller.

¿ called Mr. waller to advise him, and was instructes

to carry on with the original briefing if that was what Mr. Malone wanted.

When I returned Mr. Malone's call, he told me that the "file" on

Lee Harvey Oswald had "escaped" them.

(I assume that this means they

have misplaced their notes on Oswald.) Ms Hope Byrne (spelling?) would

be in. HQS that afternoon, and would like to see the file again. I told

Mr. Malone to have her contact Mr. O'Refly), and I so informed

Mr. O'Retlly.) 3
