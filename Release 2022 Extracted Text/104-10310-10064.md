MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Contact with Department of Justice

On 4 November 1975 I was called by Mr. Ron Malone (phone 187 - 4637),
one of the three people from the Department, of Justice who were briefed
on CI Project matters by. Mr. [sikerdanos\and me. Before returning his
call, I checked with My?JIsikerdanos'| office (he was on a TDY) and

03 Ur O'REN119, CI/EXO. (Mr. O'Reilly) instructed me to refer Mr. Malone

Mr. Waller. I called Mr. Waller;to advise him, and was instructed

to carry on with the original briefing if that was what Mr. Malone wanted.
When I returned Mr. Malone's call, he told me that the “file” on :
Lee Harvey Oswald had “escaped” them. (I assume that this means they
have misplaced their notes on Oswald.) Ms Hope Byrne (spelling?) would
be in. HQS that afternoon, and would like to see the file again. I told

. Malone have her contact (ir. Reilly, and I so informed

as
