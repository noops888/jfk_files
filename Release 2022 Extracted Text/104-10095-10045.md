IN VIOLATION OF OUR OBLIGATION TO PROTECT SOURCES AND METHODS.

IF AGENCY CAN RELEASE INFO ON SENSITIVE SOURCES AND METHODS,

AND PUBLICIZE PASY OPERATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH SPECIFIC

INDIVIDUALS, IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE ON WHAT GROUNDS WE COULD

GRITIZE THOSE WHD MAKE SIMILAR PUBLICATIONS FOR PHEIR OWN..
