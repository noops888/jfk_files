SUBJECT: LATIN AMERICA SOLIDARITY ORGANIZATION
B8ORGANIZATION OF LATIN AMERICAN SOLIDARITY
1. The Latin American Solidarity Organization (LASO)
was an off-shoot of the first Tri-Continental Conference which
was held in January 1966 in Havana, Cuba under the auspices
of the Cairo based Afro-Asian Peoples’ Solidarity Organiza- i
tion. The main outcome of the conference was a series : id
of militant resolutions that brought protests from most of
the Latin American republics except Mexico. The 27 Latin
American delegates to that conference then formed the LASO.
From 7-11 August 1967, the organization held its
first conference in Havana, Cuba. The stated aim of this ce
conference was "...to unite, coordinate, and step up the

struggle against the United States imperialism on the part

of all the exploited peoples of Latin America." The slogan

of the conference was "the duty of every revolutionary is

propaganda. The propaganda was pointed up by the election

of Ernesto ‘Che' GUEVARA as honorary chairman "in absentia".
The Cuban insistance on the supremacy of “armed struggle" as
the only valid course to achieve "national liberation"

helped shatter the early ostensible unity between pro-Castra

and pro-Soviet Communist Party delegates to the conference.

Also adding to the split was the Cuban resolution condemning
by implication the Soviet trade and aid policy toward Latin
America. The conference was expected to end with ringing de-
clarations in favor of guerrilla warfare not only in Latin
America but also in the Negro ghettoes of the United States :
and anywhere else that seemed appropriate. It was the in- ie
tention of the militants to develop a strategy, partly in-
spired by the war in Vietnam, which aimed at drawling the
United States into as many scattered committments as possible
in support of governments harassed by guerrilla warfare, in-
cluding state and city governments in the United States it-
self. It was theorized that the real significance of the
conference may have been the way in which the militants were
determined to link the struggles in Latin America with those
in Vietnam and the United States.
The agenda of the conference included the follow-
ing: points:
1. The revolutionary anti-imperialist struggle,
including armed insurrection in Latin America; i
2. Joint action against political and economic inter-
ventation by imperialism in Latin America, in-
cluding a need for a common strategy for all
Latin American revolutionary movements;
3. Solidarity of Latin American peoples with
national liberation struggles; including sup-

port for the American Negro and the defense



14-00000

of the Cuban revolution against United States
aggression. ‘i
The tone of the conference was set by Cuban Pre-
sident DORTICOS in his opening speech, he said that an at-
mosphere of "continental upheaval" was prevalent in the
United States as well as in Latin America. Due to racial :
strife in the United States her capacity to give financial
“aid to the oligarchy governments in Latin America has been
limited. The people must take advantage of conflicts and ¥
contradications in the United States to "...strike with
daring and vigor".
One of the highlights of the conference was the
presentation of a group of six alleged CIA agents who were
captured by.the Cuban Army in July 1967, The members of
4 the news media who were present at the conference were
permitted to question the prisoners, The questioning was
done, for the most part, through a.Cuban security officer who

acted as an interpreter.

The delegates to the conference were chosen by

“national committeés of the LASO that were formed partly to
avoid the problem of rival delegations arriving from the

same country. Some represented established communist parties,
some extreme nationalist splinter groups, and some guerrilla
movements. Observers from many countries and organizations
were present at the conference. Delegations arrived from:

Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Czechoslovakia, Columbia, Domini-

ane

The following is the proclamation that as issued

at the Conference.



14-00000

Proclamation of the General Declaration of the first Con-_

ference of the Organization of Latin American Solidarity.

August 10, 1967.

1, That making the Revolution constitutes a right and a
duty of the peoples of Latin America.

2. That the Revolution in Latin America has its deepest

ie historical roots in the liberation movement against
European colonialism of the 19th century. and against
imperialism of this century. The epic of the peoples
of America and the great class battles that our peoples
have carried out against imperialism in earlier decades
constitute the source of historical inspiration of the.
Latin American revolutionary movement. i : :

3. That the essential content of the revolution in Latin
America is to be found in its confrontation with in-
perialism and the bourgeois and landowner oligarchies,
Consequently, the character of the revolution is the

struggle for national independence, emancipation from

the oligarchies, and the socialist road for its complete

economic and social development.
4. That the principles of Marxism-Leninism guide the re-

volutionary.movement of Latin America.

5. That armed revolutionary struggle constitutes the fundi-

mental course of revolution in Latin America.

6, That all other forms of struggle must serve to advance


14-00000

and not to retard the development of this fundamental
‘course, which is armed struggle.

7. That, for the majority of the countries of the con-
tinent, the problems of organizing, initiating, develop-
ing and crowning the armed struggle at present con-
stitutes the immediate and fundamental task éf the

" revolutionary movement. :

8. That those countries in which this task has not yet
been undertaken nevertheiess will regard it as an in-
evitable sequence in the development. of revolutionary
struggle in their countries.

9, That the historic responsibility of furthering vi
volution in each one of these countries belongs to the
‘people and to their revolutionary vanguards in each
country. i

10... That the guerrilla is the nucleus. of the liberation arnies,
‘and guerrilla warfare constitutes the most effective -

, “method of initiating and developing the revolutionary
‘struggle in most of our countries. :

7 That the leadership of the revolution demands, as as or- i‘

ganizational principle, the existance of a unified
+ politico-military command as a guarantee of success,

12. That the most effective solidarity that the revolutionary
movements may practice among themselves, is the further-
ing and the culmination of their own struggle in their

respective countries.

13. That the solidarity with Cuba and the collaboration and

17,

cooperation with the armed revolutionary movement is an
undeferable international duty of every anti-imperia-
list organization of our continent.

The Cuban revolution, as a symbol of triumph of the
armed revolutionary movement, constitutes the vanguard
of the Latin American anti-imperialist movement. The -_
peoples that develop the armed struggle, as they ad-

vance along this road put themselves in the vanguard.

That the people who have been directly subjected by
colonialism of the European countries, in order to achieve
their liberation, must have an immediate and basic
objective: that of struggling for independence, and
uniting with the general struggle of the continent

as the only means of being absorbed into U.S. neo-
colonialism.

That the Second Declaration of Havana that expressed the
beautiful. and glorious revolutionary tradition of the
past 160 years of American history, constitutes the pré-—

gram of the Latin American Revolution which has been

‘confirmed, deepened, enriched, and made more radical by

the peoples of this continent during the last five years. ae
That the peoples of Latin America have no 4ifferences
with any other peoples in the world and extend their
hand of friendship also to the peoples of the United
States, whom they exhort to undertake the struggle a-

gainst the repressive policy carried out by imperia-


14-09000

list monopolies.

18. ‘That the Latin American struggle strengthens its ties
of solidarity with the peoples of Asia and Africa and
those of the socialist countries, the workers of the cap-
italist nations, and especially with the black popula-
tion of the United States which suffers class exploita-

- tion, poverty, unemployment, racial discrimination and
the denial of their most elementary human rights, and
which constitutes an important force with in the revolu-
tionary struggle. :

19, That the heroic struggle waged by the people of Viet
Nam gives valuable aid to all revolutionary peoples who
are fighting imperialism, and constitutes an inspiring

ae example to peoples of Latin America.

20. That we have approved the Statutes and created the Per-
manent Committee, in Havana, of the Organization of
Latin American Solidarity, which constitutes the genuine
representation of the Latin American peoples.

:We, the revolutionaries of our America, the America south of

the Rio Grande, Successors of the men who gave us our first

independence, armed with an undaunted will to fight, and i

with revolutionary and scientific guidance, and with nothing

to lose but the chains which oppress us assert: That our
struggle constitutes a decisive contribution to the historic
struggle of humanity to liberate itself ‘from slavery and ex-

ploitation. +r
