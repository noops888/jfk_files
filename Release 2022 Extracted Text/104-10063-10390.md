SUBJECT: LATIN AMERICA SOLIDARITY ORGANIZATION

@ORGANIZATION OF LATIN AMERICAN SOLIDARITY

I.

The Latin American Solidarity Organization (LASO)

was an off-shoot of the first Tri-Continental Conference which

was held in January 1966 in Havana, Cuba under the auspices

of the Cairo based Afro-Asian Peoples' Solidarity Organiza-

tion. The main outcome of the conference was a series

of militant resolutions that brought protests from most of

the Latin American republics except Mexico. The 27 iatin

American delegates to that conference then formed the Laso.

From 7-11 August 1967, the organization held its

first conference in Havana, Cuba. The stated aim of this

conference was "...to unite, coordinate, and step up the

struggle against the United States imperialism on the part

of all the exploited peogles of Latin America." The slogan

of the conference was "the duty of every revolutionary is

,to make revolution." This slogan was the center of the Cuban

propaganda.. The propaganda was pointed up by the election

of Ernesto 'Che' GUEVARA as honorary chairman "in absentia".

The Cuban insistance on the supremacy of "armed struggle"

as

the only valid course to achieve "national liberation"

helped shatter the early ostensible unity between pro-Castro

and pro-Soviet Communist Party delegates to the conference.

Also adding to the split was the Cuban resolution condemning

by implication the Soviet trade and aid policy toward Latin

America. The conference was expected to end with ringing de-

clarations in favor of guerrilla warfare not only in Latin

America but also in the Negro ghettoes of the United States

and anywhere else that seemed appropriate. It was the in-

tention of the militants to develop a strategy, partly in-

spired by the war in Vietnam, which ained at drawling the

United States into as nany scattered committments as possible

in support of governnents harassed by guerrilla warfare, in-

cluding state

and city governments in the United States it-

self. It was theorized that the real significance of the

conference may have been the way in which the militants were

determined to link the struggles in Latin America with those

in Vietnam and the United States.

The agenda of the conference included the follow-

ing points:

1. The revolutionary anti-imperialist struggle,

including armed insurrection in Latin America;

2. Joint action against political and econonic inter-

ventation by imperialism in Latin America, in-

cluding a need for a common strategy for all

Latin American revolutionary movements;

3. Solidarity of Latin American peoples with

national liberation struggles; including sup-

port for the American Negro and the defense

of the Cuban revolution against United States

aggression.

The tone of the conference was set by Cuban Pre-

sident DORTICOS in his opening speech, he said that an at-

mosphere of "continental upheaval" was prevalent in the

United States as well as in Latin America. Due to racial

strife in the United States her capacity to give financial

aid to the oligarchy governnents in Latin America has been

limited. The people must take advantage of conflicts and

contradications in the United Statos to "

...strike with

daring and vigor".

One of the highlights of the conference was the

presentation of a group of six alleged CIA agents who were

captured by the Cuban Army in July 1967. The members of

the news media who were present at the conference were.

permitted to question the prisoners. The questioning was

done, for the most part, through a Cuban security officer who

acted as an interpreter.

The delegates to the conference were chosen by

national connittees of the LASO that were formed partly to

avoid the problem of rival delegations arriving from the

same country. Some represented established communist parties,

some extreme nationalist splinter groups, and some guerrilla

wovenents. Observers from many countries and organizations

were present at the conference. Delegations arrived from:

Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Czechoslovakia, Columbia, Domini-

at the Conference.

SEGRET

14-00000

Proclamation of the General Declaration of the first Con-

ference of the Organization of Latin American Solidarity.

August 10, 1967.

1. That making the Revolution constitutes a right and a

duty of the peoples of Latin America.

2. That the Revolution in Latin America has its deepest

-

historical roots in the liberation movenent against

European colonialisn of the 19th century. and against

imperialism of this century. The epic of the peoples

of America and the great class battles that our peoples

have carried out against imperialism in earlier decades

constitute the source of historical inspiration of the

Latin American revolutionary movement.

3. That the essential content of the revolution in Latin

America is to be found in its confrontation with im-

perialism and the bourgeois and landowner oligarchies.

Consequently, the character of the revolution is the.

struggle for national independence, emancipation fron

the oligarchies, and the socialist road for its complete

economic and social development.

4.

That the principles of Marxisn-Leninism guide the re-

volutionary movement of Latin America.

5. That armed revolutionary struggle constitutes the fundi-

mental course of revolution in Latin America.

6. That all other forms of struggle must serve to advance

and not to retard the development of this fundamental

course, which is armed struggle.

7.

That, for the majority of the countries of the con-

tinent, the problems of organizing, initiating, develop-

ing and crowning the armed struggle at present con-

stitutes the innediate and fundamental task if the

revolutionary novement.

8. That those countries in which this task has not yet

been undertaken nevertheiess will regard it as an in-

evitable sequence in the developnent of revolutionary

struggle in their countries.

9. That the historic responsibility of furthering re-

volution in each one of these countries belongs to the

people and to their revolutionary vanguards in each

country:

10. That the guerrilla is the nucleus of the liberation armies,

and guerrilla warfare constitutes the most effective

method of initiating and developing the revolutionary

struggle in most of our countries.

11.

That the leadership of the revolution demands, as as of-

ganizational principle, the existance of a unified

politico-military command as a guarantee of success.

12. That the most effective solidarity that the revolutionary

movements may practice among tlienselves, is the further-

ing and the culmination of their own struggle in their

respective countries.

13. That the solidarity with Cuba and the collaboration and

---

## Page 8

14-00000

cooperation with the arned revolutionary movement is an

undeferable international duty of every anti-imperia-

list organization of our continent.

14.

The Cuban revolution, as a symbol of triumph of the

arned revolutionary movenent, constitutes the vanguard

of the Latin American anti-imperialist novement. The

peoples that develop the armed struggle, as they ad-

vance along this road put themselves in the vanguard.

15. That the people who have been directly subjected by

colonialism of the European countries, in order to achieve

their liberation, must have an immediate and basic

objective: that of struggling for independence, and

uniting with the general struggle of the continent

as the only means of being absorbed into U.S. neo-

colonialism.

16. That the Second Declaration of Havana that expressed the

beautiful and glorious revolutionary tradition of the

past 160 years of American history, constitutes the pr√¥-

gram of the Latin Anerican Revolution which has been

confirmed, deepened, enriched, and made nore radical by

the peoples of this continent during the last five years.

17. That the peoples of Latin America have no differences

with any other peoples in the world and extend their

hand of friendship also to the peoples of the United

States, whom they exhort to undertake the struggle a-

gainst the repressive policy carried out by imperia-

list nonopolies.

18.

That the Latin American struggle strengthens its ties

of solidarity with the peoples of Asia and Africa and

those of the socialist countries, the workers of

the cap-

italist nations, and especially with the black popula-

tion of the United States which suffers class exploita-

tion, poverty, unemployment, racial discrimination and

the denial of their most elementary human rights, and

which constitutes an important force with in the revolu-

tionary struggle...

19. That the heroic struggle waged by the people of Viet

Nam gives valuable aid to all revolutionary peoples who

are fighting imperialisn, and constitutes an inspiring

example to peoples of Latin America.

20. That we have approved the Statutes and created the Per-

manent Conmittee, in Havana, of the Organization of

Latin American Solidarity, which constitutes the genuine

representation of the Latin American peoples.

Ne, the revolutionaries of our America, the America south of

the Rio Grande, Successors of the men who

gave us out first

independence, armed with an undaunted will to fight, and

with revolutionary and scientific guidance, and with nothing

to lose

but the chains which oppress us assert: That our

struggle constitutes a decisive contribution to the historic

struggle of humanity to liberate itself from slavery and ex-

ploitation.
