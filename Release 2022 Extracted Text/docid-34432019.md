TRANSLATION of the postscript written by Margot GOTTSCHALK,

Dear Brother-heart !

As you have not let us hear anything from you, we are trying
once again. If this (letter) does not get a reply I will leave
you in peace. " Jimmie says that we live.our lives here and Moma
should live her life. I hope you will not bo angry with Jimmie
because he had written this lotter. .We know that it is not your
fault. Jimmie said that I should ask you if you are coming for
Christmas. We do-hope so. This week we move into new
accomodation, 2 rooms and a kitchen. So we have bought new
curtains, a large dining-room table; 4 chairs and a gas-cooker.
You see, we are getting forward. ‘We also have a budgerigar.

He is called Peter.. Today he gave Jimmie a kiss. You should
have seen it. And in the morning, if I do not get up at once,
he makes a noise until I do get up and talk to hin.

Iwill close now,
; Many Greetings and a Kiss

. From your sister Maggie.
Write again soon, yes 7 . .
