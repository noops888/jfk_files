THE UNQDD STRONGHOLD. THE TYPT: ALTHOUGH COMPOSED ENTIRELY OF FORMER

VNQDD MEMBERS, WAS ESTABLISHED ESSENTIALLY AS A BUDDHIST ASSOCIATION.

AND HAS BEEN LEGALLY ENGAGED IN CIVIC AND SOCIAL ACTIVITIES SINCE

ITS FORMATION. CLANDESTINE POLITICAL ORGMIZATION HAS PROCLEDED

FOR THE PURPOSE OF DEVELOPING NEW, YOUNGER LEADERS, ANU OF DENTING

THE OLDER PASSIVE TENETS OF BUDDHISM AS WELL AS THE OLDER LEADERS

OF THE UNQDD, THE ULTIMATE INTENT BEING A REVITALIZED REVOLUTIONARY

SPIRIT. (FIELD COMMENT. LUE IS THE FATHER SUD ACCOMPLICE OF NEUYEN

VAN CU, ONE OF THE TWO PILOTS WHO DONBED TEN PRISOOOIEGGLACE

ON 27 FEBRUARY 1962.)

2. THE TXPT CENTRAL COMMITTEE REMINDED LUG THAT THE ORGANI-

ZATION WAS IN A POSITION TO HANDLE A COUP ACTION IN CENTRAL VIETNAM

EFFECTIVELY, POINTING OUT THAT THOSE MILITARY UNITS NOT CONTROLLED

COULD BE NEUTRALIZED AND THAT THE AIR BASE AT DA MANG COULD BE

•CONTROLLED THROUGH THE AIR FORCE. THE COMMITTEE STATED THAT, AFTER

I THE ANTI-BUDDHIST ACTIONS OF THE GOVERNMENT, THE PEOPLE WERE READY

FOR AN UPRISING. BY TAKING NGO DINH CAN AND ARCHBISHOR: NGO DINH

THUC INTO CUSTODY AND BY GAINING MILITARY CONTROL OVER THUA THIEN

AND QUẠNG NAM PROVINCES, SUCCESS COULD BE ASSURED IN CENTRAL VIETNAM.

THIS WOULD PLACE THE TXPT IN A POSITION OF USING PRESIDENT DIEM'S

TACTICS OF NEGOTIATIONS AGAINST HIM, 1.E., HAVING GAINED CONTROL

OVER CENTRAL VIETNAM, THEY WOULD OFFER TO NEGOTIATE WITH DIEM

AND , AT. THE SAME TIME, THEY WOULD BE MOUNTING A COUP AGAINST THE

REGIME IN SAIGON, WHICH WOULD TAKE PLACE NO LATER THAN THREE DAYS

AFTER THE ONE IN CENTRAL VIETNAM.

3. LUC SENT A TRUSTED FOLLOWER, ONE VIET, TO SAIGON TO DISCUSS

THE PLẠN WITH AN OPPOSITIONIST SYMPATHIZER AND GET HIS VIEWPOINT.

VIET WAS ADVISED TO TELL LUC THAT ANY SUCH ACTION WAS PRECIPITATE

AND DANGEROUS. ALTHOUGH IT WAS PROBABLY TRUE THAT THE FORMER VNQDD

MEMBERS IN CENTRAL VIETNAM HAD THE POWER CLAIMED, A COUP THERE,

WITHOUT SIMULTANEOUS ACTION IN SAIGON, WOULD LEAVE A VAÇUUM WHICH

THE VIET CONG (VE) COULD IMMEDIATELY USE TO THEIR OWN ADVANTAGE.

VC REACTION PROBABLY WOULD TAKE THE FORM OF GAINING CONTROL OF ALL

AREAS NOT EFFECTIVELY CONTROLLED BY THE COUP GROUP, WITH THE •

ULTIMATE POSSIBILITY OF PARTITIONING CENTRAL VIETNAM, OF BEING IN A

POSITION TO FORM A REVOLUTIONARY GOVERNMENT, AND FINALLY, OF BEING

ABLE TO CALL FOR NEGOTIATIONS: THEMSELVES. ACCORDING TO VIET, THIS

FOLLOWED LUC'S THINKING, PARTICULARLY BECAUSE HIS FOLLOWERS WERE NOT

IN A POSITION TO ACT IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE COUNTRY. VIET

THOUGHT THAT LUC WOULD INSTRUCT THE TXPT CENTRAL COMMITTEE IN.

CENTRAL VIETNAM TO TAKE NO ACTION AT THIS TIME, AND THAT LUC'S

ADVICE WOULD BE ACCEPTED.
