‘ZATION WAS IN A POSITION TO HANDLE A COUP ACTION IM CENTRAL VIETNAM
: EFFECTIVELY, POINTING OUT THAT THOSE MILITARY UNITS NOT CONTROLLED

COULD BE NEUTRALIZED AND THAT THE AIR BASE AT DA NANG COULD BE

THE ANTI-BUDDHIST ACTIONS OF THE GOVERNMENT, THE PEOPLE WERE READY

FOR AN UPRISING. BY TAKING NGO DINH CAN AND ARCHBISHOP NGO DINH

AND , AT THE-SAME TIME, THEY WOULD: BE MOUNTING A COUP AGAINST THE
REGIME. tN ‘SAIGON; WHICH WOULD TAKE PLACE NO LATER THAN THREE DAYS
AFTER THE: ONE IN CENTRAL VIETNAM.
3. LUC SENT A TRUSTED FOLLOWER, oNe VIET , To SAIGON To DISCUSS

THE PLAN WITH AN OPPOSITIONIST SYMPATHIZER AND GET HIS VIEWPOINT.
VIET WAS ADVISED TO TELL Luc THAT ANY SUCH ACT JON WAS PRECIPITATE
AND DANGEROUS. ALTHOUGH 'T WAS | PROBABLY TRUE THAT THE FORMER VNQOD

i MEMBERS ‘IN CENTRAL VIETNAM HAD THE POWER CLAIMED, A COUP THERE,

| wiTHOUT SIMULTANEOUS ACTION IN SAIGON, WOULD LEAVE A VACUUM WHICH
THE VIET CONG (VC) COULD IMMEDIATELY USE To THEIR OWN ADVANTAGE.
vc REACTION PROBABLY WOULD TAKE THE FORM OF GAINING CONTROL OF ALL
AREAS Not EFFECTIVELY CONTROLLED BY THE COUP GROUP, WITH THE

: ULTIMATE’ POSSIBILITY OF PARTITIONING CENTRAL VIETNAM, OF BEING INA
POSITION 7) FORM A REVOLUTIONARY GOVERNMENT, AND FINALLY, OF BEING
ABLE To CALL FOR NEGOTIATIONS. THEMSELVES. ACCORDING TO VIET, THIS

FOLLOWED LUC'S THINKING, PARTICULARLY BECAUSE H1S FOLLOWERS WERE NOT
IN A POSITION TO ACT IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE COUNTRY. VIET

THOUGHT THAT LUC WOULD INSTRUCT THE TXPT CENTRAL COMMITTEE IN
CENTRAL VIETNAM TO TAKE NO ACTION AT THIS TIME, AND THAT LUC'S

ADVICE WOULD BE ACCEPTED.
