sequently asked Special Agent DAVIS to contact Mrs. VALENTINER
for the purpose of determining what she had overheard, refrain

caution ber friends whon she had told of the incident to do lite-
vise. ;

Special Agent DAVIS mentioned that Mrs. VALBIFIINEN bed
returned to her room, 210, at the University Court Resort Hotel
at 1130 hours, 19 July 1960, and noticed bellows of cigar amoke
emanating from underneath her kitchen door. Upon exauining the
situation, she overheard lowl conversing in the connecting roan.
In listening further, Mrs. VALENTINER was able to record the
conversation in Rean 209 by taking copious notes. Mrs. VALENTINER
belteved there were three Cubans present together with two other
individuals whose nationality she could not determine but whose
names she established to be Frank HEIDER and “Jimaie." One of .

tinct Germanic. accent. Mrs. VALENTINER told DAVIS that Hr. BENDER

sions not noted). He further declared that she had mentioned to

ledge of Spanish. DAVIS replied that she advised him that she
possesses fluent lmowledge of Spanish after having resided in Cuba

* for ten years. Her husband has lived in Cuba for thirty years.

While at the motel, DAVIS cbserved that she had notes of the
conversation which she referred to during the interview. It should
be noted that these notes were not confiscated by DAVIS.

lies. VALENTINER, accordimg to DAVIS, did a Mittle investigating
on her own. After the meeting, of the group was over, Frank BENDER
called Gational Airlines to comfirm his reservations for 19 July
1960. Shortly thereafter, Mrs. VALENTINER called National Airlines
and dersermined that BENDER wes destined for Washington, D.C, She

condueed no further investigation.

Smeeial Agent DAVIS descx-ibed Mra. .VALENTINER as discreet,
cooperxacive, intelligent, anti-CASTRO, and anti-Commmist, DAVIS
feels spat this varticular incident will "@tesa natural death”
and the: the people who have iiecene knowledgeable to sane extent
of our activity are discreet enough to not discuss it further.
Dering bis discussion with Mes. VALENTINER, DAVIS at no time divulged
any United Statea Goverment mponsorship of this matter.

Accling Special Agent in Charge Richani BAKER concluded that

...28 far as the local FBI Office was concerned, this was a closed
matter. Ee added that any otiuer participation by his offtce woula

have tx be approved by FAL Headquarters,

At Corm2, Gables, Florida

Ax 1200 hours, 24 Jaly 15550, the Reporting Agent, under alias,
moved ito roan 206 at the University Court Resort Motel. A
physics. survey at the motel was made on this day. Attention is
invited to Exhibit 76. Butlaimg "Cc" vhere the meetings were con-
ducted sve completely equipped connecting dinette kitchens. Mea.
Clark WALSNTINER currently occupies roca 210 at this motel where,

hed she elected to Go so,woula be able to cvezhear the entire -
converszscion in room 209 from ther kitchenette. As will be noted

on the rege 7 diegraa of Ethibtt 46, her kitchen extends three to
four feet (actual measurement) into roa 209. The kitchen door

is of plywood construction. Im building C there is a 3/4 to 1 inch
Gap between the floor end the mase of the Kitchen doors to a

allew =o: to vall ting. Eetween reons 209 and £09 there

ia a steel reinforced plastered wall. It 4s the writer's opinion

that i= 1s impossible to monit:or conversation talking place in 209
fran 205 without the use of proper Ustening devices. According



#219000 ieee 2 August 1950

to Mie. EROWN, previously identified in this report, the windows
were closed and the air conditioing vas on when the meatings
were conducted. _

It would be difficult for anyones to monitor the conversation
in roan 209 from either the back or front doors as they are of
smoked glass construction thereby affording the occupants of the
room to note anyone standing in front of then.
