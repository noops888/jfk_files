the past

month period. During this time he spent time with PHIL

MATTUCCI, a local gambler, and he frequented a newly opened

gambling establishment known as the Rainbow Gardens located

just out of town.

that CICCARELLI was interested in working up some kind of

local

"deal"

..in the gambling business in town.

was not successful as he is reported to have returned to

Florida.

On recontact on 3/16/59 this informant advised

that he has not seen CICCARELLI since he left last year and

as gambling in town is having. a hard time, he probably felt

he could do better back in Florida.

SUBJECT IS SAID TO CARRY SMALL CALIBER GUN AND WAS

ARRESTED IN 1943 FOR CARRYING A •38 CALIBER REVOLVER; SHOULD
