,2i'a. LNCUFF records show that KORENGOLD was born on 4 September 1929, is

aU. S. citizen,

and is married to a French citizen named Marie Christine nee

DAVIRON, born 23 October 1937 in France.

They reside at 10 Onslow Gardens,

"London, S. W.7, and they have at least one child, Kevin Lloyd KORENGOLD, born

on 15 September 1968 in London, KORENGOLD is listed in Station records as head

of the Newsweck bureau in London and as a member of the Foreign Press Associa=

tion (to which a number of Soviet press and radio correspondents belong)

Kenreth N: RACOLIN (p), who served with KORENGOLD in Moscow and who

is still known to him as having been an LNYATE official there, has told us the follow-

a) KORENGOLD has twice been stationed in Moscow, first with UPI in

about 1961-62 and then with Newsweek in about 1963-65.

Between these two

assignments, he took a course in Russian studies at Harvard under a Nieman

Fellowship, He does, of course, speak Russian.

b) Having excellent contacts in Soviet intellectual circles; KORENGOLD

wa's one of the best sources of information for LNYATE and LNCUFF press

personnel in Moscow. On more than one occasion KORENGOLD ran into diffi

culties with the Soviet authorities; he along with an LNCUFF officer were in the

apartment of the author AMALRIk when it was raided.

c) KORENGOLD probably maitinüäs nic cortic: as lie can mich hig

circle of Soviet acquaintances from his Moscow day's, and since he is an ag-

gresaive and well-informed man, he probably also is widely acquainted among

Eastern and Western press circles in London.

d) In RACOLIN's opinion, KORENGOLD rould cooperate with JKLANCE il,

after suitable cultivation, requests for assisance were made.

e) RACOLIN and his wife were personal friends of the KORENGOLD's,

and on one of his TDYs to London, it would be natural for RACOLIN to contact

KORENGOLD; then of later RACOLIN could introduce a Station officer to him.

3. We are cognizant of not only the security reservations which might arise

from KORENGOLD's years in Moscow and his haring a French wifc, and we are like-

wise cognizant of Section 5b, CSI-F 50-10:

Nevertheless, we would appreciate re-.

ceiving Headquartèrs and LNERGO traces on the KORENGOLD couple.

also welcome jour comments as to the practicaliti of our considering him as a pos

sible future source reporting on Soviets in London.
