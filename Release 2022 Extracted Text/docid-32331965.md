Re Chicago te1,5/25/59, concerning possibility of
conspiracy indivtment being returned by Federal Grand ~
dury against Pittsburgh national top heodium SAMUEL

MANNARINO, FBE # 115840,

Since the beginning of the Top How.dlum Progrém numerous physical
surveillances have been conducted in an effort to obtain

an identifiable photograph of MANNARINO, but the project

has been complicated because MANNARINO never appears in

public without dark glasses. As an example, while waiting

to testify before a Federal Grand Jury in Pittsburgh

during Merch, 1959, MANNARINO wore dark giasses, covered

his face completely with a handkerchief and finally

hid in a clothes closet to avoid news photographers.
