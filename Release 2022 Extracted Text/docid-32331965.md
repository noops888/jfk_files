BERNARD i. EZHAYA, et al

(00: New York)

Re Chicago tel,5/25/59, concerning possibility of

conspiracy indiument being returned by Federal Grand

jury against Plttsburgh national top hoodium sAMuEl

MANNARINO, FBI # 115840.

Since the beginning of the Top Hoodlum Progrem numerous physical

surveillances have been conducted in an effort to obtain

an identiflable photograph of MANNARINO, but the project

has been complicated because MANNARINO never appears in

public without dark glasses. As an example, while waiting

to testify before a Federal Grand Jury In Fittsburgh

during March, 1959, MANNARINO wore dark giasses, covered

his face completely with a handkerchief and finally

hid in a clothes closet to avold news photographers.
