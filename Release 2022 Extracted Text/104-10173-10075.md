KHWYACLAOV told xin to b= discreet nbous their contacts,
he allexedly told his fitands in Conenhagon that he vas

he was boing pushod,but since he had a stronz desire to
ro to the USs2 and did not provicée to KHXYACHXOV any "sub-

attcnted a nisor presaure was Georriy HOSHALOV. He told
FaaR once that if he did not collsborate,ne visa for

a Kw ndnitted candidly that his desire
to study tire ssian lancuage was so strony in 1950 and
see lg9se that if at that tine tao Coviets had oftered hin
an onvortunity to attend a soviet university,he wd
have accentec,even if he had been discourared by tho
Us. authorities, xorever,artcr his experience in 195
he allevedly changed his view rudically and just wanted
to be left al « sith all that, Gees could not yrovide
ené pleusitle exnlanution why he did not cone
to the w..5. thorities and renort everything. When
guestionsa -b ey. rather sharply on this voiat, he
becane criotio: and stated that "if he really wanted
