1958, he had a telephone call from NATIE MARTIN concerning
two hustlers who got themselves into some trouble and
MARTIN requested PG T-16's help in the matter.

PG T-16 said MARTIN was calling about ELIZABETH and ANN who
once worked for a madam known as RENEE and a pimp named BUTCH
or PHIL. According to MARTIN, these persons were giving

the girls a hard time and PG T-16 assured MARTIN that he would
call RENEE and. straighten the situation out if possible.

PG T-16 said that MARTIN did not elaborate as to the nature
of the trouble in which the girls were involved.

PG T-16 said that a few days later he was able to reach RENEE
at telephone number Churchill 2-2127 and in conversation RENEE
made the statement that ELIZABETH and ANN are. either related
to JOHN FONTANA or working for him, According to PG T-16,

the girls now live in New Kensington somewhere over a.club
and are hustling out of the Jacktown Hotel in the evening.

PG T-16 said that JACKIE, the head waiter at the Jacktown
Hotel, is acquainted with the girls and might be able to fully
identify them. PG T-16 also said that RENEE also commented
that FONTANA had called her regarding the girls sometime ago.

PG T+16 said it is possible that ELIZABETH:and ANN could be
identical with GINA and VICKIE who. once worked -for RENEE

in the 5700 block of Fifth Avenue, Pittsburgh. PG T-16 recalled
that at that time GINA and VICKIE claimed to be sisters.

PG T-17, who has furnished reliable information in the past
on October 24, 1958, stated that telephone number Churchill
2-2127.is an unpublished number listed to RENEE LEVITT, 1696
Monongahela Avenue, Pittsburgh 18, Pa.

PG T-5 on November 17, 1958, stated that JOHN FONTANA is
operating a craps game at the White Star Hotel and Tavern

in Kinloch, Pa., a suburb of New Kensington, fronted by JIM
AMARAS (phonetic). According to PG T-5, AMARAS was arrested
by Special Agents of the Internal Revenue Service in New
Kensington, several months ago for being involved in a numbers
violation at 1002 Second Avenue, New Kensington. PG T-5
said that the craps game operates on the second floor of

the hotel and two prostitutes are hustling out of the room
next door, one of whom is believed to be from West Virginia.

as JACK PERRONE of Springdale, Pa. After leaving the office
HANNA drove his car to the rear of the motel and entered a room
directly behind and to the left of the motel office accompanied
by the blonde. When HANNA left the office, NAFFAH advised

SA FORSYTH that it was obvious to him that HANNA recognized

SA FORSYTH because HANNA did a "double take".and winked at

NAFFAH several times while registering. NAFFAH advised that he
has had HANNA. as a paying guest in the past on the average of once
every ten days, always in the afternoon but added that he did

not. know HANNA personally.

HANNA and the young woman were still in the motel room when
SA FORSYTH left the premises at approximately 6:00 p.m.,
November, 18, 1958.

PG T-5 on December 9, 1958, stated that on December 7, 1958,
HANNA told him he was "broke" and wanted to borrow some
money. PG T-5 asked HANNA why he did not obtain the money
from the MANNARINO organization and HANNA indicated that he
is in the midst of a "falling out" with the gang. PG T-5
loaned HANNA $10.

PG T-5 pointed out that HANNA's father, ALEX HANNA, told him
that his son was wounded in the hand and leg while serving
with the U. S, Marine Corps in the Okinawa campaign during
World War II.

PG T-5. stated that he also learned that about a year ago one of
his friends cashed a U. S. Government disability check for
HANNA that exceeded $100.

The Department of Health, Bureau of Vital Statistics,
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, on December 8, 1958, advised that

racket is opening up again in New Kensington, Pa.,-on the
authority of newly appointed Chief of Police JOHN: BORDONARO.

PG T-20 said that two New.Kensington pimps named NIP
VURDEN and HORACE JARNIGAN have been allowed to re-open
their- business at 1151 Fourth Avenue and that a hustler
known as "JACKIE" is working for them at. that address.

PG T-5 on November 17, 1958, stated that five prostitutes
are now hustling on the second floor of a house on Barnes
Street, not further described, near the Kenmar Hotel in
New Kensington and are required to pay newly appointed
Chief of Police BORDONARO and Mayor RAYMOND GARDLOCK $75
a week each for protection. 7 .
The "Pittsburgh Post Gazette" in an article dated October 28,
1958, reported that JOHN BORDONARO, Chief of Police,

New Kensington, Pa., testified for 33 minutes before the
Federal Grand Jury on October 27,1958. The press
speculated that BORDONARO was. called before the Grand Jury
along with other gamblers in New Kensington in connection
with the gambling losses of JOHN KONOWAL, JR., at the
Triangle Billiards gambling casino. : é

DANIEL J.. ZELOYLE
Former Chief of Police.
New Kensington, Pa. (deceased a

PG T-5 on October 14, 1958, stated that approximately

two weeks ago DANIEL ZELOYLE's widow telephoned PG ‘T-21,

of unknown reliability,. and, requested PG T-21 to.come

to the ZELOYLE farm immediately on a matter of importance.
LPG T-5 said that when PG T-21 arrived Mrs. ZELOYLE, ay

her daughter, and son-in-law told_him that they had been
looking all over the farm to find. ZELOYLE's money but had
absolutely no luck and asked PG T-21 how much he. would
estimate that he paid ZELOYLE when the latter was Chief

of Police of New Kensington. PG.T-5 pointed out that during
‘|the period 1944 to 1950 when PG T-21 was operating a house
of prostitution in New Kensington with ZELOYLE's permission
PG T-21 paid ZELOYLE.in excess of $250,000. PG T-5

\
It is recalled that during February, 1958, PG T-4 stated that
SAMUEL MANNARINO in early 1957 purchased |a hunting lodge surrounded
by 200 acres of land. At the time PG ?-4 understood MANNARINO
to say the lodge was located in Somerset County, Pa., and
extensive investigation was conducted to identify the lodge
in an effort to locate GABRIEL MANNARINO who might logically
be expected to be hiding there.

PG T-4 on October 28, 1958, learned through JACK KRUPA,

New Kensington, Pa., councilman and long-time hunting companion

of the MANNARINO brothers, that the hunting lodge is not

located in Somerset County, Pa., but is actually a twenty

room farm house generally referred to .as a hunting lodge

surrounded by approximately 200 acres of densely wooded land

in Pennsylvania near the Pennsylvania Maryland. border approximately
a fifteen minute drive by automobile from Hagerstown, Maryland,-

PG T-4 was unable to, obtain any additional. information because

of the likelihood of arousing KRUPA's suspicions.

Examination of road maps of the area indicate that the hunting
lodge could be located in Franklin County probably in the
general vicinity of Waynesboro and Greencastle, Pa.

PG T-4 on October 28, 1958, recalled that he was in SAM
MANNARINO's office at the Ken Iron and Steel Company during
December, 1957, when the press and radio carried the first
accounts of GABRIEL MANNARINO's being.called before the Federal
Grand Jury in New York. PG T-4 stated that while he was

at the office Deputy Marshals were then attempting to locate
GABRIEL MANNARINO when his brother, SAM, réceived a phone call
from GABRIEL and hurriedly told him "They are trying to

serve you. with a subpoena, take off for the brush." PG T-4
said that in view of MANNARINO's prolonged disappearance

it would seem logical to assume that if SAM MANNARINO's

remarks were interpreted literally his advice "take off for the
prush" could have been his subtle way of telling GABRIE!

to hide out at the hunting lodge.

By way of background information. PG T-4 pointed out on
October 28, 1958, that the lodge or farm house near the
Maryland border has several four.wheel drive trucks parked
on the property that are used from time to time by local
residents. PG T-4 said that according to KRUPA the area

is thickly populated with whiskey stills and that local game
wardens are reluctant to enter the area apparently because

NW 68262 Docld:32298176 Page 12


PG 92-228; 92-236

that MANNARINO and LA ROCCA could be in Youngstown,
Ohio.

PG T-35 went on to say that several years ago MIKE GABLE

was sent to Youngstown, Ohio, by VALENTI and hide out. for
several months with. ANTHONY. CORBI... PG T-35. described
himself as a former close associate of CORBI in a venture

in Youngstown and added that CORBI. has a brother named FRANK
CORBI who is a well known racket. figure in Baltimore,
Maryland.

In conclusion PG T-35 stated that if either MANNARINO or
LA ROCCA is in Youngstown, Ohio, or Warren, Ohio, he feels
that he can locate them,

It is noted that the information furnished by PG-T-35 confirms
information given by PG T-36, who has: furnished reliable
information in the past, on August 25, 1958.

PG T-37, with whom-contact has been insufficient to determine

degree of reliability, on November 9, 1958, furnished

additional information concerning GABRIEL MANNARINO and !
JOHN LA ROCCA's possible presence in Warren,- Ohio, with

CHARLES -MURGIE:

"I could not find out about that party yet, as
that crew are very secretive, I have an Idea that
they may be in Warren, Ohio again. -I think it-
would be worth a try to watch that Charlie Murgie,
from the Sunrise inn again, or watch his house

at 753 Wildwood N.E, as he had them hidden down
there, then he took them to Florida, but I think
they must be there again, as I know they like to
stay close to home as John, jLaroce's Wife is going
to have an operation soon."

It is noted that Mrs. LA ROCCA did undergo surgery recently
in Pittsburgh, Pa.

Hot Springs, Arkansas

PG T-38, another Government agency conducting intelligence
investigations, on November 12, 1958, stated that a oct
or letter was sent to GABRIEL MANNARINO's home at 540
Charles Avenue, New. Kensington, postmarked October 31, 1958,
addressed to PAT CORSO from the Buck Staff Bathhouse,

Hot Springs, Arkansas. PG T-38 considered it likely that

PG 92-228; 92-236

would estimate that at the time of his death ZELOYLE should
have had over a half million dollars considering the huge
amount of money he had received from the MANNARINO brothers
while in office as Chief of Police.

PG T-5 said that Mrs. ZELOYLE told PG T-21 that her husband

never discussed his business dealings with her when he was j
alive but that she was not blind to his corrupt activities and

shared the knowledge that he had puried at least one-half

million dollars but he would not share the secret of the

hiding place with her. : \

PG T-5 went on to say that Mrs. ZELOYLE mentioned that even t
though her husband left several income properties in his

F estate on which she could live comfortably the remainder

of her life that she was very disappointed that she could not
find the money, especially sincé her husband's savings account
at the bank contained only $400. According to PG T-5,

Mrs, ZELOYLE also said that. ZELOYLE's personal effects

! yielded a number of shares of stock purchased some years

Bgo for $8,000 and now worth $35,000 but that the stock

was not in her husband's name but in the name of another
woman her husband had apparently been living with for a
number of years. PG T-5 said that Mrs. ZELOYLE left

the impression with PG T-21 that she and her son assisted

by her daughter and‘ son-in-law have been digging holes

all over the ZELOYLE farm especially around the barn.in

a desparate effort to locate the money that they believe

‘is buried in a milk can.

|
i

In conclusion PG T-5 said that Mrs. ZELOYLE's daughter told
PG T-21 that the night pefore her father passed avay he
practically had to be tied to nis bed in the hospital
because he kept repeating that he had to get up and go

out’ to the farm to do something he considered very

important.
