1958, he had a telephone call from NATIE MARTIN concerning

two hustlers who got themselves into some trouble and

MARTIN requested PG I-16's help in the matter.

PG I-16 said MARTIN

was calling about ELIZABETH and ANN who

once worked for a madam known as RENEE and a pimp named BUTCH

or PHIL.

According to MARTIN, these persons were giving

the girls a hard time and PG T-16 assured MARTIN that he would

call RENEE and straighten the situation out if possible.

PG T-16 said that MARTIN did not elaborate as to the nature

of the trouble in which the girls were involved.

PG. T-16 said that a few days later he was able to reach RENEE

at telephone number Churchill 2-2127 and in conversation RENEE

made the statement that ELIZABETH and ANN are either related

to JOHN FONTANA or working for him.

According to PG I-16,

the girls now live in New Kensington somewhere over a club

and are hustling out of the Jacktown Hotel in the evening.

PG T-16 said that JACKIE, the head waiter at the Jacktown

Hotel, is acquainted with the girls and might be able to fully

identify them.

PG. T-16 also said that RENEE also commented

that FONTANA had called her regarding the girls sometime ago.

PG .I-16 said it is possible that ELIZABETH and ANN could be

identical with GINA and VICKIE who once worked for RENEE

in the 5700 block of Fifth Avenue, Pittsburgh.

PG T-16 recalled

that at that time GINA and VICKIE claimed to be sisters.

PG T-17, who has furnished reliable information in the past

on October 24, 1958, stated that telephone number Churchill

2-2127 is an unpublished number listed to RENEE LEVITT, 1696

Monongahela Avenue, Pittsburgh 18, Pa.

PG I-5 on November i7, 1958, stated that JOHN FONTANA 1S

HANNA and the young woman were still in the motel room when

SA FORSYTH left the premises at approximately 6:00 p.m.,

PG T-5 on December 9, 1958, stated that on December 7, 1958,

PG T-20 said that two. New Kensington pimps named NIP

VURDEN and HORACE JARNIGAN have been allowed to re-open

their business at 1151 Fourth Avenue and that a hustler

known as

"JACKIE" is working for them at that address.

1 PG T-5 on November 17, 1958, stated that five prostitutes

Street, not further described, near the Kenmar Hotel in

New Kensington and are required to pay newly appointea

Chief of Police BORDONARO and Mayor RAYMOND GARDLOCK. $75

The "Pittsburgh Post Gazette" in an article dated October 20,

1950, reported that JOHN BORDONARO, Chief of Police,

New Kensington, Pa., testified for 33 minutes before the

Federal Grand Jury on October 27, 1958.

The press

speculated that BORDONARO was called before the Grand Jury

along with other gamblers in New Kensington in connection

with the gambling losses of JOHN. KONOWAL, JR., at the.

Triangle Billiards gambling casino.

PG 92-228; 92-236

It is recalled that during February, 1958, PG I-4 stated that

SAMUEL MANNARINO in early 1957 purchased a hunting lodge surrounded

by 200 acres of land.

At the time PG T-4 understood MANNARINO

to say the lodge was

located in somerset county, fa.

and

extensive investigation was conducted to identify the lodge

in an effort to locate GABRIEL MANNARINO who might logically

be expected to be hiding there..

PG T-4 on October 28, 1958, learned

through JACK KRUPA,

New Kensington, Pa.,

councilman and long-time hunting companion

of the MANNARINO brothers, that the hunting lodge is not

located in Somerset County, Pa., but is actually a twenty

room farm house generally referred to as a hunting lodge

surrounded by approximately 200 acres of densely wooded land

in Pennsylvania near the Pennsylvania Maryland border approximately

a fifteen minute drive by automobile from Hagerstown, Maryland.

PG I-4 was unable to obtain any additional information because

of the likelihood of arousing KRUPA's suspicions.

Examination of road maps of the area indicate that the hunting

lodge could be located in Franklin County probably in the

general vicinity of Waynesboro and Greencastle, Pa.

PG T-4 on

October 28, 1958, recalled that he was in SAM

MANNARINO's office at the Ken Iron and Steel Company during

December, 1957, when the press and radio carried the first

accounts of GABRIEL MANNARINO's being called before the Federal

Grand Jury in New York.

PG T-4 stated that while he was

at the office Deputy Marshals were then attempting to locate

GABRIEL MANNARINO when his brother, SAM, received a phone call

from GaBRIEL and hurriedly told him

"They are trying to

serve you with a subpoena, take off for the brush."

PG T-4

said that in view of MANNARINO's prolonged disappearance.

it would seem logical to assume that if SAM MANNARINO'S

remarks were interpreted literally his advice "take off for the

brush" could have been his subtle way of telling GABRIEL

to hide out at the hunting lodge.

By way of background information PG I-4 pointed out on

October 20, 1950, that the loage

or farm house near the

Maryland border has several four wheel drive trucks parked

on the property that are used from time to time by local

residents. PG T-4 said that according to KRUPA the area

is thickly populated with whiskey stills and that local game

wardens are reluctant to enter the area apparently because

- 51 -

PG 92-228; 92-236

that MANNARINO and LA ROCCA could be in Youngstown,

Ohio.

PG T-35 went on to say that several years ago MIKE GABLE

was sent to Youngstown, Ohio, by VALENTI and hide out for

several months with ANTHONY. CORBI.' PG T-35 described

himself as a former close associate of CORBI in a venture

in Youngstown and added that CORBI has a brother named FRANK

CORBI who is a well known racket figure in Baltimore,

Maryland.

In conclusion PG T-35 stated that if either MANNARINO OF

LA ROCCA is in Youngstown, Ohio, or Warren, Ohio, he feels

that he can locate them.

It is noted that the information furnished by PG T-35 confirms

information given by PG I-36, who has furnished reliable

information in the past, on August 25, 1958.

PG T-37, with whom contact has been insufficient to determine

degree of reliability, on November 9, 1958, furnished

additional information concerning GABRIEL MANNARINO and

JOHN LA ROCCA's possible presence in Warren, Ohio, with

CHARLES MURGIE:

"I could not find out about that party yet, as

that crew are very secretive, I have an Idea that

they may be in Warren, Ohio again. 'I think it

would be worth a try to watch that Charlie Murgie,

from the Sunrise inn again, or watch his house...

at 753 Wildwood N.E. as he had them hidden down

there, then he took them to Florida, but I think

they must be there again, as I know

they like to

stay close to home as John Laroco's Wife is going

to have an operation soon."

It is noted that Mrs. LA ROCCA did undergo surgery recently

in Pittsburgh, Pa.

Hot Springs, Arkansas

PG T-38, another Government agency conducting intelligence

investigations, on November 12, 1958, stated that a postcard

or letter was sent to GABRIEL MANNARINO'S home at 540

Charles Avenue, New Kensington, postmarked October 31, 1958,

addressed to PAT CORSO from the Buck Staff Bathhouse,

Hot Springs, Arkansas. PG T-38 considered it likely that
