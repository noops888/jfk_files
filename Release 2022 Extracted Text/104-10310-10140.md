3. The article does not make clear whether or not
NAGELL is back in Germany at the moment, nor do we have any
information regarding his: present whereabouts, other than
‘the statement in the article that he is probably now in the
United States, |The Public Safety Officer/USBER advises us,
however, that subsequent to his release from prison: in East
Germany in October 1968 he again visited West Berlin and con-

tacted the Public Safety Office where he complained about
not being able to locate his children.:- -

4, There are no Berlin Base traces on the author of
the article, Thomas C, LUCEY, Since the article appears to
be an effort. to discredit the U.S. Government and certain
officials of the government we would appreciate receiving
any traces which Headquarters or the,German Station may have.
