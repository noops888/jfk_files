Orozco, a ‘ding to his we, went to Cuba to rescue Jose i
cee and three others who were hiding in the \
ome of a woman named aE who iivad at No, 72 Lt

O's Capture, if s captured, presents an \
indirect threat to the security of AMLASH-1 and a more i
direct threat to the security of AMTRUNK-10 Since Orozco :
in Jan 1964 oxfiltrated throug the rat line established i
by AMICE-14 (Miguelito), Upon his return to Cuba, H
AMLASH-2 will check the above with AMTRUNK-10; and, if :
Orozco is under the control of the security service, will
decide and communicate with Miami whether AMLASH-1 and
AMTRUNK-10 believe it neceBsary to exfiltrate ANTRUNK-10,
AMLASH-1 was briefed to send a letter to UNSNAFU-9 to
indicate whether Orozco has been arrested or whether he is
still in hiding. If the letter to UNSNAFU-9 Bentions a
good and pleasant return trip, this will mean that Orozco
is not under the control of the security service. If the
letter talks abou: long, tiring trip, this will indicate
that Orozco has n arrested, AMLASH-1 was also requested
to send a report on the above and any complications which
have developed or may develop from Orozco's infiltration.

Db. AMLASE-1 suggested that his nom de guerre "Charles,"
which we have been using for the past three years, be
changed to "Gerardo,"

out and pass to the Paris Station through UNSNAFU-9 the
mames of the Cuban techs training at La Rochelle.

sickness in the country. seen

m. AMLASE-1 did not believe that Aragones had invited
him to fly back to Havana with him in order to get him
back because of any serious security matter. AMLASH-1
did state that Aragones was concerned that AMLASH-1 may not
return to Cuba. Since Aragones cleared AMLASH-1 for his
trip abroad, he is in a way responsible that AMLASH-1 does
not defect and returns to Cuba. AMLASH-1 feels Aragones
does not want any problems with Fidel in case AMLASH-1
decides to stay out.

the political developments in Cuba in mid-November and

p. Rank of Cuban officials under Fidel in teras of
their influence-in making national policy, Rseul is still
the heir apparent to Fidel. Next to Raul is Che Guevara,
After that, no other official, according to AHLASH-1, has
apy great influence in the making of Cuban national policy.
President Dorticos’ relationehip with Fidel is gvod since
be is ® herd and serious worker, has good administrative
ability and is able to work within the general outline laid
down by Fidel, Raul Castro has some political influence |
and control in Oriente where he has placed his men in
positions of influence, but only Fidel personally has any
poBtical influence in the rest of Cuba. Even within the
military Fidel selects and appoints high army officers.

Che Guevara is still strong in the economic field and

has not suffered a decline in his influence and authority
because of his eurlier policy of industrialization,

Guevara restricts himself to the economic field and plays

@ very small role in the political field. He is serious
and very hard worker, one of the few, according to AMLASH-1,
who has worked geven days a week without leave since the
revolution, Emilio Aragones holds an important posttion

as the organizational secretary of the PURS, He is the
official who was always at the office of the National
Directorate of the Party and has contact with all the
officials in the regime. He plays an important coordinating
role, Faure Chomon has been.accused of organizing former
13th of Harch Revolutionary Directorate people, but,
according to AMLASH-1, this probably based on the fact that
Chomon always gives jobs in the ministry he heads to DR
people. Because of this Chomon today controls to 3 large
degree the Ministry of Transportation. Of all the ainistries,
the DR's stronghold is in the Ministry of Transportation,
Other DR people who continue to hold important positions

in the regime are Alberto Mora, Ambassador Carrillo and
Jose Naranjo. Herrero tae

q. AMLASH-1 and AMWHIP-1 were unable to develop any
specifics, but from their conversations with Ambassador
Carrillo got the impression that Carrillo would prefer and
welcome a transfer from the Embassy in Paris to the
Enbassy.in Madrid,

x. According to Emilio Aragones, Anibal Escalante
is being considered for a job outside Cuba. The job will
probably be in the commercial/economic field, but a
decision had not been made as of Noverber 1964 as to
location,
