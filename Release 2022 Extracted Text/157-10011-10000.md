- Mr. Barnes

replied that the CIA believes what is required is enough individuals to serve as

a rallying point for the anti-Castro elements in Cuba and thus 600 is as useful as

3,000. The CIA justified the request for 38 military men because it now believed

it was necessary to train the Cubans in infantry tactics involved in a defense, in

addition to the guerrilla warfare training previously contemplated.

A similar project was noted for jet fuel storage tanks in Cuba.

Lansdale noted that the CIA had concluded that its realistic role should be to at least

create the illusion of a popular movement, to win external support for it, to improve

CIA operational capability, and to help create a climate which will permit provocative

actions in support of a shift to overaction. Lansdale wanted them to reevaluate
