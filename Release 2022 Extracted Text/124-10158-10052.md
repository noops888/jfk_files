advised that his office had received information thatxh

BUCHANAN reportedly is presently employed on an installation

of Bull office machines being used by the Frefecture of

Police in Paris®

This information has

been turnished to the

Prefecture of police, and while their inguiry is continuing,

preliminary results would indicate that the report is untrue.

In this connection, a copy of the memorandum captioned

TRONAS GITTINGS BUCHANAN, JR•9

which sets forth background

intornation concerning him

appearing in Bufiles, and which

was transmitted to the Paris Office by Bulet to

Baltimore

it appears that the information contained in the memorandum

would be of

interest to the Ambassador, RALPH SMITH Of the

local office o1 U.S.I.S, che Direction de la Surveillance

du territoire (DSt), French domestic counterespionage service,

We are theretore turnishing

copies of that memorandun to then

As mentioned previously,

we will continue/to

follow this matter closely and promptly transnit to tbe

Bureau any pertinent information of interest.
