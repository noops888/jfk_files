April 1977

SUBJECT: Theory re MOSKALEV, Yuriy Ivanovich and

Unidentified Man

That Yuriy Ivanovich MOSKALEV might be identifiable with

the "unidentified man" going into and coming out of the Soviet

Embassy in Mexico City in October 1963. The "unidentified man"

was recently identified by SLIPSTREAM as a KGB type by name of

"Yuri" whom he knew in Moscow in 1964.

According to travel records MOSKALEV was in the

USSR in 1964.; in the U.S. in Otober 1963 .

-

MOSKALEV functions officially as a Soviet scientist

and often attends international conferences. He

has been in contact with known GRU Soviet diplomat in

the U.S.

MOSKALEV bears a striking resemblance to composite of

"Saul" in book Appointment in Dallas who claims he was involved

in the assassination of President. Kennedy. "Saul" claims:

he crossed border into U.S. illegally and was in

Dallas on 20 November.

- That he had been to Mexico City, had a contact in

Soviet Embassy there, in 1963, and that he knew the

identity of OSWALD because he (OSWALD) had been

fingered to him in Mexico City.

---

## Page 7

: 2 .

that OSWALD was involved in the Kennedy assassination

plot, but that he, "Saul", fired shots that killed

Kennedy.

that two hours after the assassination he, "Saul",

was out of the U.S. That he used limp as a

disguise.

QUESTIONS

1. Could MOSKALEV be "Saul"?

2. Could MOSKALEV, therefore, be mystery man who

boarded plane in Mexico City for Havana on 22

November 1963?

3. Was assassination a Soviet comspiracy without

Cuban knowledge?

RECOMMENDATION

1. Can we obtain voice tape of MOSKALEV, since he

has delivered speeches at scientific conferences

in U.S. and abroad?

2.

If so, could we arrange to have McDonald (unwittingly)

hear it, to see if he recognizes it as that of "Saul"?

Get photos and check out MOISEEV and BABKOV.

Via CI Staff, find out if we can show photo to DERYABIN

and ROSTVOROFF?

Could MOSKALEV be Dept 13? Could OSWALD have met with

him in Mexico City clandestinely in 1963?

REFERENCES: A. Photos Taken in Mexico City by Mexico City

Station

B. Paperback Book "Appointment in Dallas"

C. Soft File, Headquarters Information on

Yuriy Ivanovich MOSKALIV, Possible

"Unidentified Man"

1. Photographs of the unidentified nan were taken by

our Mexico City Station on 2,3,4, and 15 October 1963, going

into or coming out of both the Cuban and Soviet Embassies in

Mexico City. Copies were provided to the FBI in Dallas.

Texas on 22 November 1963. Although cropped copies have

appeared in various works, including Volume XX, page 691, of

the Warren Commission Report, and the book "Appointment in

Dallas", to our knowledge the individual has never beeni

identified.

2. On 17 March 1977, a former member of the Cuban General

Directorate of Intelligence (DGI) recognized photographs of

the unidentifie man as Yuri LNU, a KGB officer, whom he met

in Moscow in 1964 while attending an intelligence course

there. He said that Yuri, a fluent English and Spanish

speaker, was acting as a trouble shooter for the Cukan groud.

the Cuban and Bulgarian groups quartered in the same bu:lding

in Moscow. Any time the Cubans had a problem, Yuri would solve

it for them. Yuri was a good friend of Juan (pseudo) a KGB

officer who taught the Cubans about the Agency (CIA) and the

West German intelligence apparatus. Juan told the DGI member

that he had served in Mexico for about 20 years and in the U.S.

' clandestinely for about 10 years (specific dates unknown). Yuri

was entrusted with their welfare only, and did not attend classes

with the Cuban group.

3. SE/X travel records were reviewed in search of an

individual by the name of Yuri who possibly fit the description

of the unidentified man. This lead to an individual by the

name of Yuriy Ivanovich MOSKALEV, a Soviet, reportedly a Doctor

of Medical Sciences, who has participated in international

scientific conferences for the USSR since 1962 or earlier.

Although there is no official 201 file on MOSKALEV, there is a

sizable dossier on him in the Central Reference Service. Many

of the documents in his dossier are 00 reports from U.S.

scientists concerning MOSKALEV's attendance and behavior at

scientific meetings. It is obvious that he has a much greater

knowledge of the English language than he admits. His capability

is said to improve greatly after a few drinks; however, it is

noted that he rarely, if ever, drank at the scientific meetings.

It is also noted that on

• occasions he reportedly was not

qualified to represent the Soviets at a particular conference.

His papers rarely, if ever, were specific, or presented new data.

Following are items of interest from selected documents in

MOSKALEV'S CRS dossier:

a. In 1961 PENKOVSKY identified a photo (with no

name provided) as that of Col. Yuriy Ivanovich NOSKALEVSKIY,.

Air Force Col.and GRU officer in the Information Directorate

of the GRU.

In December 1963 the FBI reported •

In October 1963 MOSKALEV was a

delegate

to

the

IAEA Symposium on Neutron Irradiation, Brookhaven, Long Island,

New York.

Described by U.S. scientists as very sharp, MOSKALEV

was a frequent commentator on other people's work and made

a practice of denigrating their reports with respect to

radiation lethality.

d.

In October 1967 MOSKALEV participated in the Second

International Symposium on Delayed Effects of Bone Seeking Radio

Nuclides, Sun Valley, Idaho, arriving two days early.

He

travelled ai

•o Sun Valley and appare . . was able to use

his knowledge of the English language to get along on his own.

Although he complained about not I-nowing much English. he

admitted writing the English version of the paper he presented.

MOSKALEV attempted to make propaganda of a paper by a West

German scientist. A respected U.S. scientist said he fran'-ly

did not believe MOSKALEV's findings. MOSKALEV took copious

notes on all papers, which indicated he understood what was

going on. He also took many pictures with a 35 mm camera.

From questions MOSKALEV asked, it was obvious that he "new

English quite well. Although considerable time was spent

arranging for MOSKALEV to visit a U.S. laboratory en route

to

his home, he took a different route,

without telling anyone

of his plans, and did not visit the lat.

4. On 23 March 1977 several identification experts of

the Disguise and Identification Section of OTS/GAD compared

photos of the unidentified man with photos of Msay Yuriy

Ivanovich MOSKALEV from the FBI, British Liaison, and CRS.

It was their opinion that MOSKALEV could very likely ke

identifiable with the unidentified man.

5. Page 59 of the book "Appointment in Dallas," shows an

Identi-Kit Model composite of an individual who told the

author in London in 1972 that he was involved in the assassination

of President Kennedy. The composite of that individual (code

name "Saul"), whose real name is unknown to the author, kears

a striking resemblance to the photos of Yuri! Ivanovich

MOSKALEV. According to the author "Saul"identified the

picture shown in the Warren Commission Exhilit #237 as

having been taken at the Russian Embassy in Mexico City,

either in the foyer or just outside.

is the inventor of the Identi-kit and at one time was under

contract to CIA in regard to the Identi-Kit. McDonald claims

in his book that he met "Saul" at an office in CIA Headquarters

sometime after the Bay of Pigs invasion, and that a colleague

of McDonald told him that "Saul" was an assassin.

7. There are striking parallels between the backgrounds

of "Saul" as given in McDonald's book, and MOSKALEV.

For example:

of Saul. McDonald said he first

met Saul in CIA Has. CIA took

CIA in relation to his Identi-Kit.

It is true that Mexico City Station

claimed started his investigation.

composite of "Saul".

CDH comment: See photos of

Yuriy Ivanovich MOSKALEV. He

bears striking resemblance to

"Saul."

Helms, the DDP testified under oath

that he didn't know "Saul."

Pg• 60/61 - McDonald states it

was obvious that FBI and CIA

were compromised at the very

top since both Agencies denied

knowledge of "Saul". Noone wanted

: DDO/LA Division Memo, dated 25 March 1977

On 23 March, Chris Hopkins of Latin America Division handcarried

photographs to OTS/GAD for identification comparison. These photos were

examined by the undersigned and two identification experts of the Disguise

and Identification Section.

2. The results of the comparison is as follows:

differences Fach a se probably see to surites aghduh rences are slight

B. Chin - Fair similarities-the loss of muscletone due to ageing

is most apparent here.

C. Hair Line - Again good similarity with the natural ravages of

time factored in.

D. Set and Proportion of Eyes and Eyebrows - Close similarities.

(Comparison of eye detail is not possible due to poor photo quality)

E. Nose and Caliper Lines - Close similarities in the nose but

the younger man has no sign of the distinctive caliper lines which extend

from the nose to either side of the mouth on the known Soviet.

This could

be explained by loss of muscletone and/or differences in lighting.

Mouth - The shape, proportion and expression of the mouth anc

the whole area from the tip of the nose to the tip of the chin is perhaps

the most distinctive characteristic of both subjects.

Here the similarities

are very close.

He stated that his

training is in health physics and that his job

in the USSK is to be

informed at all times of the status of US health physics and radiation

protection programs.

He said that he reads the IS joumal "Health

Physies" regularly as well as other lester radiation research journals.

Although in discussions with loiseev he appeared to be technically

competent, he kept very close to Moskalev and rarely let him out of

his sight. If Molseer 13 Moskalev's

The two visitors presented the Soviet papers in English (Dr. Moiseev

speaks English quite well)

ana participated su the discussior of

other papers.

The visitors were already acguinted with man

attending the Symposium so informal discussions were very common and

apparently productive.

Representatives from all major U. S. labor~

atories working oh.dia transuranium elements and from the Atomic Eneray

Commission were able to meet with the Soviet visitors.

The visitus

related current status of their studies on biological

effects of

plutonium in their formal presentations and in their discussions.

Their manuscripts have been received and will be published in the

Symposium proceedings.

During the week, they met with Dr. p. C.

Thompson, Symposium Co-chairman, to discuss editing of their

manuscripts.

Visit to Life Sciences Laboratory

On October 1, Drs. Moskalev and Moiseev were escorted to the 331

Building by W. J. Bair.

Discussions with the staff occurred during

the day in the conference room with visits to various laboratory

facilities occurring as necessary.

have reported biological effects of inhaled plutonium in experimental

and logic in making their recommendations was very useful.

Dr. V. H. Smith - Drs. Moiseev and Moskalev were reasonably well

acquainted with the field of therapy for plutonium poisoning but

not intimately in terms of details or recent Soviet literature; the

former because his field was more on the

ecological side, and the

Lunch was attended by Dr. Hardin Jones, the four guests, Drs. Van Dyke and

Parker, and Dr. Patricia Durbin, who acted as hostess and guide through

the day.

Topics discussed at lunch were centered about the Transuranium

symposium. The efficacy of two new techniques to remove lung contamina-

The two techniques are

charged with the responsibility of setting the plutonfun protectiön stándards

and removal techniques after exposure to plutonium for all of France. Lafuna's

most impressive work involves the success he has had in removing copious

amounts of plutonium and other transuranium products from humans using DIPA.

Lafuma explained that from his point of view he was concemed with only

two primary aspects of human contact with plutonium, inhalation and wounds.

His studies have shown, of course, that the earlier ticatment is begun the

better the results; but also he has found it casier to decontaminate an

area of the body exposed to plutonium through contact or a wound than to

remove It from the lungs.

Lafuma has used

intravenous injection exclusively

for the treatment of wounds and finds that a very significant amount of the

transuranium particles are discharged from the body in urine.

For the treatment

of inhaled particles, Lafuma has used both DIPA aerosola and

injection.

his results

from injection are better than the use of aerosols, even in lung

decontamination.

The nature of the Sutton mecting was such that few simificant scientific

positions were taken: however, in general, the quality of the panera

The countries represented were UK (26), Italy (5), Exance (1), Sweden (2),

Poland (1), South Africa (1), and the US (7).

To the extent that the proper "half-life for lead in nan" was discussed,

the consensus appeared to be that (a) the loss rate can not he Icpresented

as a single exponential; (b) the presently avallable data on baboons and

beagle dogs does not extend for a sufficient period of time to provide a

were undoubtedly meant to impress his western associates.

A very poor

reading marked the presentation of the paper prepared by A Tumanyan of the

Sciences of the USSR.

The paper was given in a hurried and garbled fashion

by a person who obviously was not a scientist. After the session ended,

2. It appears to me that the Soviets have a strong tendency toward expert-

ments that enable them to study radiation effects on large animals.

They do not seem interested in radiation response - the effect on tissue;

on the other hand, they concern themselves with metabolic effects; which

are important, because they are related to the ability to suppress immunity

mechanisms.

They stress Immunology and transplants.

The International Committee of Photobiology had an executive cormittee

symposium in the late sumer of 1967 on the Island of ivar, Yugoslavia.

The symposium will emphasize photosynthesis.: The general plan calls

for participation by about 100 scientists, with emphasis being placed

on Invitations to the jounger scientists in the Sov Bloc. The chief

Did Symposium contributions include significant advancements in research

on controlled thernonuclear reactions that nay be useful in determining

the feasibility of initiating uncontrolled thermonuclear reactions solely

without the use of fissionable materials which would produce large amounts.

of energy, on the order of one kiloton or greater?

To the best of my knowledge there was no formal discussion of any

nuclear reactions, as such.

The great majority of the material presented

had to do with biological effects, and the physicists at the Symposium,

were using high energy machines largely to produce the radiation that'

would be comparable to solar flare radiation..

Was anything presented on effects of space radiation on the human body?

I can recall no Soviet references to the Vostok flights.:

The two Soviet

speakers confined their references to purely laboratory observations.

I'here was a number of. US papers, and as I recall one from France,

Were there results in the use of drugs in radiation protection?

I do not recall anyone's discussing drugs-Soviet or other.

And I think

that although research in drugs is continuing many radiobiologists are

not very optinistic about their value.: This is something many of us

have reservations about.

ins conclusions presented on determining the relative biologic effective-

urs, factor of biologic material when exposed to radiation from nuclear

casting?

:in, I can speak with some certitude.

•There is so conclusion about the

¿Jativo biological effect of this, factor.

People will argue about it,

st there is no conclusion. fithe soviets had some things to say about it,

*"was thoroughly confused about their position.. There are two ways

.. wiring about the RBE factor.

One is Iron the: viewpoint of theoretical

Diatory which is interested in the why of differences of biological

afractivoness, and this becones one of the parameters of experiment.

The

oter is the question of an empirical nunber that one. can use in handling

Justiono of judgment about radiation exposure in man.

With regard to the

wotion of judgment, I think that most biologists would agree

that we

ir not love any reliable and valuable RBE factors.

We have numbers that

roscit what via might be afraid of, more than anything else.

Did the inriets say anything bearing on physical measurements of radia-

¿iri in space in terms of relativo biological effectiveness factor and

in plientions for future manned space flights?

camwas a frequent commentator

of denigrating the reports

is test people with respect to radiation lethairty.

Hi's comment was to

une arrect that the stuces of radiation lethality done usually in small

insanls sure not to the point, were not germane to problems in the

lirion case, and that to be useful these studies should be done in animals

closer to man.

¿o What is your critique of his argument?

'oll, a nass of work has been done with the smaller animals in variuos

liboratories and ive are beginning to get certain generalities

nature of radiation injury, or at least certain kinds of radiation

injury, ind therefore I think it is worthwhile to pursue it.:" As you

jigit singine, I presented a paper on radiation lethality and was among

toie to whose work Moskalev objected.

o yu wink Moskaler's objections were motivated from anything more thar

a genuine scientific position?

in can say? In their published work the Soviets show a lot of attention

to effects in the central nervous system--they ure very interested in

this and US people have tended to ignore this area..

So conceivably

oskalsv is oriented to CiS work and physiological functions, I do not

ino:. But quite a lot of the Sovist work las a different orientation?

fron western work--at least their published stuff.

loskalev, both from the papers he gave and his questions and comments

In discussion,

Indicated lat to was vesy slars,

very duvanced in his

Knowladge of the biological effects of radiation, particularly with

respect to distinguishing among the effects of various energies of

neutrons and the techniques for neasuring these energies.

I think it

may be safely assumed that the Russians are using very advanced methods

for detecting and measuring the various energies of neutrons--the

dosintry of neutrons. In the biological effect, I think they are

way behind us.

But they are much involvei in the potentials of neutron

irradiation and their objectives are, I am sure, the effects of space

radiation

on human beings.

25.

Actually, IV PJ Afanas'yev, who is a physicist, was even more sophisticated

Afanas'yev's paper was entitled "Production and Investiga-

tion of Dose Fields

for Irradiation of Ixperimental Animals with Protons

of High Energy".

His paper showed that both their production of high

energy protons in the laboratory and the measurements of these protons

with respect to animal work is sophisticated. They are 'advanced in this.

I think this is the distinction to be made: they are more advanced in

the technology of producing high energy radiations and the measurement

of these than they are in biological effects of radiation.

Q.. Was anything reported on offects of radiation on non-regenerative tissues

such as the brain? "'

Áo

The Russians are very much involved in CNS effects of radiation, but they

presented no data at the Symposium.

a survey of Russian research work on biological action

CiS as I recall.

27.

One, gets the impression that whereas Russians physics is mechanistic

and quite indistinguishable fron ours in that respect,

Russian biology

is. Impregnated with philosophy.

ioskaleva for example, spoke of how

• the body

"adapts" to radiation in the sense that a single animal adapts.

Most biologists will reserve this word to changes in a species over a

very long period. I suppose you could consider wound healing as:

adaptation in a sense. But wester biology: sees certain events:

occuring in an organisn as the consequence ofin wound which can be

described withuut resort to notims of teleological adaptation.

philosophical tendency has been a damaging element in Russian biology,

-..-

23. Q. Here there resuits in the use

of drugs in radiation: protection?

I can, recall nothing on protective drugs from'anybody.

There was here

and there a reporting of drigs used to enhance the effect of radiation

with respect to tumor treatrent..

29. {:

Has anything presented on the characteristics of a bio-element used for

space radiation detection including the number required for an extended •

space probe and the method of transmitting information?

I am afraid I do not understand the question.

30. Q.

Vas there anything on biological indicators at

Low ranges of radiation

doses?

A.

There is a tremendous amount öf interest in such indicators everywhere.

loskalay' presentations did not say anythink specific except that the

Russians are working on longster effects of small doses of radiation

mostly as regards tumors. So they ars interested in carcinogenesis and

of low doses of radiation,

so prosumably they are not concerned with these.

Piople from other countries, and particularly the US, reported work

irving to do with low dose effects and reliable biological indicators

For low ranges of dose using the chromosome aberration methods in human

.cills. But the Russians had nothing to say about this particular thing

mind seem not to be working on it as yet.

In your opinior; what is the level of accomplishment, worldwide, in this

latter of getting reliable indicators of biological damage?

Insofar as I know, the most sensitive and reliable biological index for

amage at low dose rates involves the study

Tie approach was developed in the US and is being used extensively here

and in england, and ether countries are takina it up. Moreover, I tbiti.

that in radichiology in general, in almost any question you could ask,

the west

and particulariy the us

and England are very much in the forer

firont.

From what I kio of Russian radi biology from

¡ranslations and

Icarsay, the Russians are years behind us, but I

exclude their reiated

physical work from this judgment.

Has there reporting from the Soviets on types of radiation detection

equipment used in the Vostox flights?

Did they report findings on the

relative biological effectiveness factor values for neutrons, protons

and cosmic ray attenuations?

ell, erain, there was no specific mention of this, but the interest in

tha rolative biological effectiveness factor for neutrons and cosnic

was a major concern of the whole Symposium:

the attempt to

slucidute the FBI factor and particularly the problem with respect to

lunge anirals, like humans, where in the case of neutrons you have a

change in the

type of radiation in the interior of the animale • You do

not save this change with x- ganma rays, but you do have it with fast

34. lo low is this neutron change manifested in large animals?

in The neutrons become moderated.. As they proceed through the tissue, the

rydrogen

in the tissue reacts

with the poutrons and there is a change

in this encrgies taker up.

At some point you have gammise.

So, the First.

fer layers of hydrogenous material on the outside of the animal tend to

change the dose, and in the interior, where the important effects occurs

you do not know what the dose is.

We talk about mid-line doses,

average doses, but the actual dose in the cells of the bone marrow or the

gut,

do

not know yet.

This is öne of the problems of the RBE and a

very big one.

nautrons in mice finding that there were as many if not more mutations

with low dose rate neutrons than with high dose rate neutrons.

is the first direct evidence of the cumulative effect of a prolonged;

or fractionated, low dose of neutrons.

You do not have such an effect

with x- or garma rays.

If you prolong the dose with these, the effect

will be very nuch less than it would be if you gave the sane total dose

in a single fast pulse.

30.

Q.

The neutron dose given gradually might have an even more damaging effect

than if given all at once, is that it?

At least. But the matter is still delicate,

for Searle's experiment

they are playing around with it, you see.

ness factor of biologic material when exposed to radiation from nuclear

1. Well, this kind of interest is implied in work with neutrons.

neutrons there is this question of RE and it was one of the major

points of discussion at the Symposium.

39. Q. Did the Soviets say

anything bearing on physical measurements of

radiation in space in terms of relative biological effectiveness factor

and implications for future manned space flights?

A.

All I can say is that it is logical to suppose that this is what they

are after:

good physical measurements of radiation of a type that

might be anticipated in space.

40. Q. Was there anything said on mapping and profiles for space radiation?.

i.A. There was nothing on this.

41. Q. What intarest have the Soviets shown in development and testing of nuclear

power sources

for thermionic pover generators?

Are the Soviets now

applying such generators?

A. There was nothing on this.

42. Q. Did the Soviets report progress in radiation resistant materials and

components for application to long space flight

electronic equipment?

1. This Symposium was all biological, so there was nothing on this.

1:3: Q. Was thare anything from the Soviets on methods of radiation shielding?

.. No.

It was there by implication. The fact that they were talking about the

of dose fields, the radiation of

experimental

protons of high energy, implies that they would be using some kind of

shielding to get the animal exposed.

44. Q.

This contribution would have been in Afanas"yev's paper "Production and

Invastigation of Dose Fields for Irradiation

of Experimental Animals

with Protons of High Energy"?

Aa. Yes.
