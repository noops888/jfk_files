April 1977

Theory re MOSKALEV, Yuriy Ivanovich and

Unidentified Man

That Yuriy Ivanovich MOSKALEV might be identifiable with

the "unidentified man" going into and coming out of the Soviet

Embassy in Mexico City in October 1963. The “unidentified man"

was recently identified by SLIPSTREAM as a KGB type by name of

"Yuri" whom he knew in Moscow in 1964.

According to travel records MOSKALEV was in the

USSR in 19645 in the U.S. in October 1963

MOSKALEV functions officially as a Soviet scientist
and often attends international conferences. He
has been in contact with known GRU Soviet diplomat in

the U.S.

MOSKALEV bears a striking resemblance to composite of

"Saul" in book Appointment in Dallas who claims he was involved

in the assassination of President Kennedy. "Saul" claims:

he crossed border into U.S. illegally and was in
Dallas on 20 November.

That he had been to Mexico City, had a contact in
Soviet Embassy there, in 1963, and that he knew the
identity of OSWALD because he (OSWALD) had been

fingered to him in Mexico City.


- that OSWALD was involved in the Kennedy assassination

plot, but that he, "Saul", fired shots that killed

Kennedy.

- that two hours after the assassination he, "Saul",
was out of the U.S. That he used limp as a

disguise.

QUESTIONS
1. Could MOSKALEV be "Saul"?

2. Could MOSKALEV, therefore, be mystery man who
boarded plane in Mexico City for Havana on 22
November 1963?

3. Was assassination a Soviet comspiracy without

Cuban knowledge?

RECOMMENDATION
1. Can we obtain voice tape of MOSKALEV, since he
has delivered speeches at scientific conferences
in U.S. and abroad?
2. If so, could we arrange to have McDonald (unwittingly)

hear it, to see if he recognizes it as that of "Saul"?

van we find ,hotc that PENKOVSKY identified of

MOSKALEVSKIY.
May I see PENKOVSKIY's 201 file for period 61-63?
Get photos and check dut MOISEEV and BABKOV.

Via CI Staff, find out if we can show photo to DERYABIN
and ROSTVOROFF?

Could MOSKALEV be Dept 13? Could OSWALD have met with

him in Mexico City clandestinely in 1963?

interesting aspect of meeting was conduct
ad contributions of Prof. MOSKALEV of
USSR Academy of Sciences. His subject was
listed as "Uptake and Retention of
Plutonium in Man"; no abstract was
presented. When he spoke he changed the
title to "Problems of Kenetics of Uptake
and Retention of Radioisotopes." His
paper presented nothing new and can be
described as elementary. He apparently
spoke no English.

work and made a practice of denigrating
their reports with respect to radiation

Sources (3 U.S. scientists) were asked

if they thought MOSKALEV's objectives
were motivated from anything more than
genuine scientific position. They
responded - "Who can say?" MOSKALEY,

both from papers he gave and his questions

was yery sharp, The paper he gave
presented no new data. His paper said
nothing specific.

had travelled alone to Sun Valley and
apparently was able to use his knowledge
of English language to get along on his
own. However, he complained to Chairman
of conference that he did not know enough
English to read his paper which also
required condensation because it was too
long for the time allowed. A colleague
who had known MOSKALEV from previous meet-
N.B. ings said MOSKALEV's knowledge of English
improved greatly after a few drinks.
However, he did not drink at all during
; this conference. He did mention that he
had written the English version of the
paper he presented himself. A respected
U.S. scientisi with nore exper ence
than MOSKALEV said he frankly did not
believe MOSKALEV's findings. (Said this
in private.) MOSKALEV atzempted to
make propaganda of a report by a West
German. MOSKALEV left the conference a
N.B. little upset. He took copious notes on
all papers, which indicated he understood
What was going on. He also took many
pictures with a 35 mm camera, From questions
he-asked in private, it was obvious he

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Possible Identity of the "Unidentified Man”
Photographed in Mexico City in October 1963
REFERENCES: A. Photos Taken in Mexico City by Mexico City
Station
B. Paperback Boot “Appointment in Dallas"
C. Soft File, Headquarters Information on
Yuriy Ivanovich MOSKALEV, Possible

“Unidentified Man"

1. Photographs of the unidentified man were taken by
our Mexico City Station on 2,3,4, and 15 October 1963, going
into or coming out of both the Cuban and Soviet Embassies in
Mexico City. Copies were provided to the FBI in Dallas,
Texas on 22 November 1963. Although cropped copies have
appeared in various works, including Volume XX, page 691, of
the Warren Commission Report, and the book "Appointment in
Dallas", to our knowledge the individual has never beeni
identified.

2. On 17 March 1977, a former member of the Cuban General
Directorate of Intelligence (DGI) recognized photographs of
the unidentifid man as Yuri LNU, a KGB officer, whom he met
in Moscow in 1964 while attending an intelligence course
there. He said that Yuri, a fluent English and Spanish
Speaker, was acting as a trouble shooter for the Cuban group,

about 15, attending the course. Yuri lived with


oe
the Cuban and Bulgarian groups quartered in the same bu: lding
in Moscow, Any time the Cubans had a problem, Yuri would solve
it for them, Yuri was a good friend of Juan (pseudo) a KGB
officer who taught the Cubans about the Agency (CIA) and the
West German intelligence apparatus. Juan told the DGI member
that he had served in Mexico for about 20 years and in the U.S.

- elandestinely for about 10 years (specific dates unknown). yuri
was entrusted with their welfare only, and.did not attend classes
with the Cuban group.

3.  SE/X travel records were reviewed in search of an
individual by the name of Yuri who possibly fit the description
of the unidentified man, This lead to an individual by the
name of Yuriy Ivanovich MOSKALEV, a Soviet, reportedly a Doctor
of Medical Sciences, who has participated in international
scientific conferences for the USSR since 1962 or earlier.
Although there is no official 201 file on MOSKALEV, there is a
sizable dossier on him in the Central Reference Service. Many
of the documents in his dossier are OO reports from U.S.
scientists concerning MOSKALEV's attendance and behavior at
scientific meetings. It is obvious that he has a much greater
knowledge of the English language than he admits. His capability
is said to improve greatly after a few drinks; however, it is
noted that he rarely, if ever, drank at the scientific meetings.
It is also noted that on _ occasions he reportedly was not
qualified to represent the Soviets at a particular conference,

His papers rarely, if ever, were specific, or presented new data.


a eee iniarii

Following are items of interest from selected documents in
MOSKALEV's CRS dossier:

a. In 1961 PENKOVSKY identified a photo (with no
name provided) as that of Col. Yuriy Ivanovich MOSKALEVSKIY,
Air Force Col,and GRU officer in the Information Directorate
of the GRU,

b, [In December 1963 the FBI reported *

c. In October 1963 MOSKALEV was a delegate to the
IAEA Symposium on Neutron Irradiation, Brookhaven, Long Island,
New York, Described by U.S. scientists as very sharp, MOSKALEV
was a frequent commentator on other people's work and made
a practice of denigrating their reports with respect to
radiation lethality.

d. In October 1967 MOSKALEV participated in the Second
International Symposium on Delayed Effects of Bone Seeking Radio

Nuclides, Sun Valley, Idaho, arriving two days early, He


travelled’ a4 ae Sun Valley and apnare . | was able to use
his Dicwieda of the English language to get along on his ow.
Although he complained about not !nowing much English, he
admitted writing the English version of the paper he presented.
MOSKALEV attempted to make propaganda of a paper by a West
German scientist. A respected U.S. scientist said he fran‘ly
did not believe MOSKALEV's findings. MOSKALEV took copious
notes on all papers, which indicated he understood what was
going on. He also took many pictures with a 35 mm camera.
From questions MOSKALEV asked, it was obvious that he new
English quite well. Although considerable time was spent
arranging for MOSKALEV to visit a U.S. laboratory en route to
his home, he took a different route, without telling anyone

[a7
of his plans, and did not visit the lab.


4. On 23 March 1977 several identification experts of |
the Disguise and Identification Section of OTS/GAD compared
photos of the unidentified man with photos of MX Yuriy

Ivanovich MOSKALEV from the FBI, British Liaison, and CRS.

_It was their opinion that MOSKALEV could very likely ke

identifiable with the unidentified man.
5. Page 59 of the book "Appointment in Dallas," shows an

Identi-Kit Model composite of an individual who told the

author in London in 1972 that he was involved in the assassination

of President Kennedy. The composite of that individual (code
name "Saul"), whose real name is unknown to the author, kears
a striking resemblance to the photos of Yuriy Ivanovich
MOSKALEV. According to the author "Saul"identified the
picture shown in the Warren Commission Exhitit #237 as

having been taken at the Russian Embassy in Mexico City,

either in the foyer or just outside.


6.

he author of the aforementioned book, Hugh C. McDonald,

is the inventor of the Identi-Kit and at one time was under

contract to CIA in regard to the

Identi-Kit. McDonald claims

in his book that he met "Saul" at an office in CIA Headquarters

sometime after the Bay of Pigs invasion,

and that a colleague

of "Saul" in 1970, It began, he
said, with a call from an uniden

the Aral Sea. McDonald obtained

CIA approval to make contact.

Pg. 70 - In Germany in 1945
McDonald knew of 12 people
(Poles, Czechs, Rumanians,
Germans, Scandinavians, 2 Russiaws)
who feared and hated Russia. They

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Chief, Latin America Division

ATTN : Chris Hopkins
FROM : Graphics and Authentication Division/Senior Operations Officer
SUBJECT : Photo Comparison

REFERENCE : DDO/LA Division Memo, dated 25 March 1977

1. On 23 March,Chris Hopkins of Latin America Division handcarried
photographs to OTS/GAD for identification comparison. These photos were
examined by the undersigned and two identification experts of the Disguise
and Identification Section.

2. The results of the comparison is as follows:

A. Facial Shape - Close similarities, although there are slight
differences which are probably due to subject's age differences.

: B. Chin - Fair similarities-the loss of muscletone due to ageing
is most apparent here.

C. Hair Line - Again good similarity with the natural ravages of
time factored in.

D. Set and Proportion of Eyes and Eyebrows - Close similarities.
(Comparison of eye detail is not possible due to poor photo quality)

E. Nose and Caliper Lines - Close similarities in the nose but
the younger man has no sign of the distinctive caliper lines which extend
from the nose to either side of the mouth on the known Soviet. This could
be explained by loss of muscletone and/or differences in lighting.

F. Mouth - The shape, proportion and expression of the mouth and
the whole area from the tip of the nose to the tip of the chin is perhaps
the most distinctive characteristic of both subjects. Here the similarities
are very close.

SECRET


SUBJECT: Photo Comaprison
PAGE -2-

G. The proportions of the head, check bones and the body style of
the younger man tend to indicate he is of slavic origin.

3. The results of this type comparison are rarely absolute and are
usually limited by poor photo quality or differences in viewing angle.
With that understood it is our opinion the two subjects of the forementioned
photo comparison could very likely be the same person. If additional
photographs of the subjects, particularly if they are of better quality,
are obtained, we would be happy to examine those as well.

source US biophysicist who had conversations with Yu I Moskalev and Alex
Moiseev during the visit of the two Soviets to the US in October 1971.

1. In October 192% dead of Biophysics, Ministry
of Public Healtl—voscow Jods tral Advance:
Institute for Training of Physicians, Moncow, visited several US
biological and biophysical research facilities. During one of these
visits it was learned from Moskalev that ie is the Chairman of the
USSR equivalent to the US National Council on Radiation Protection.
In this position, Moiseev is Noskalev's secretary.

2._ Motssev was a difficult individual to figure out, He stated that his
~“"Eraining is in health physics and that bis job in the USSK is to be
informed at all times of the status of US health physics and radiation
protection programs. He said that he reads the US journal "Health
Physics" regularly as well as other Western radiation research journals.
Although in discussions with Moiseev he appeared to be technically
competent, he kept very close to Moskalev and rarely let him out of
his sight. If Moiseev is Moskalev's "guardian" (as he appeared to be)
he let his om guard down during a cocktail party hosted by Dr David it
Taylor, Department of Biophysics, Institute of Cancer Research, Belmont,
UK. During the course of the evening Moiseev consumed countless gin
and tonics util he could barely articulate. MNoskalev, on the other
hand, sipped one or two drinks all evening.

3. Moskalev was a very adept diplomat. He finds it easy and
t to adopt his conversation to wiatever kind of group he is
with. We talked at considerable length about the role of women in the
Soviet economy and mentioned that his own vife is a pathologist. He
was always much freer in is conversation vhen Moiseev was out of
hearing.

4. In terns of his professional work, Moskalev stated that he has a
program in the USSR of exposing dogs to various doves of radiation
to learn the biomedical effects of radiation. it is a program quite

5 similar to that at the Lovelace Foundation in Albuquerque, New Mexico. 5
4 The major difference being that whereas the Lovelace inhilation a
3 experiments involve only the beagle dog, the Soviets do not use a 3
2 controlled breed, but rather use mongrels. Moskalev's budget, which 2

he implied was sufficient, comes from the Soviet Ministry of Health.
The actual Soviet work with the dogs is virtually parallel that in
the US. It involves studying the lov level effects of radiation
from inhaled or injected materials.

Moskalev's work appears to be very good as far as it has gone.

But he has only vorked with nitrates and chlorides of plutonium,

not with plutonium oxide. Oxides (solid components) should be of
interest to anyone vorking in this field because the chemical forms
of plutonium are quite useful to know about when doing accident type
studies — to understand plutonium metals it is essential to know
about plutonium oxide. Whether the Soviets are working only with
solutions rather than oxides is not known. It is alvays possible,
of course, that Soviet work with plutonium oxides is classified.

The two visitors presented the Soviet papers in English (Dr. Moiseev
speaks English quite well) and participated in the discussions of
ether papers, The visitors were already acq:
attending the Symposium so informal discussions were very common and
apparently productive. Representatives from all major U. S. labor~
atories working cn-the transuranium elements and from the Atomic Eneroy
Commission were able to meet with the Soviet visitors. The visitus
related current status of their studies on biological effects of
plutonium in their formal presentations and in their discussions.

Their manuscripts hve been received and will be published in the
Symposium proceedings. During the week, they met with Dr. R. C.
Thompson, Symposium Co-chairman, to discuss editing of their
manuscripts.

Visit to Life Sciences Laboratory

On October 1, Drs. Moskalev and Moiseev were escorted to the 331
Building by WV. J. Bair. Discussions with the staff occurred during

the day in-the conference room with visits to various laboratory -
facilities occurring as necessary.



D. G. Willians -3- Letober 29, 19/1

Dr. J. F. Park - Past, present, and future riments on the
biological effects of inhaled plutonium in laboratory animals;
therapeutic removal of inhaled plutonium, and USSR recommendations
to the ICRP to lower plutonium MPC's were discussed. ‘These Scvict
scientists have completed more work on the biological effects of
inhaled plutonium in animals than any other research group except
our own laboratory, The interchange of experizental F
and concepts was valuable for planning our future res
evaluating the results of past and present research. Since they
have reported biological effects of inhaled plutonium in experim
animals at extremely low exposyre levels and recommended to the ICR?
that limits of exposure should be lowered, the opportunity to
understand and evaluate their experimental results, interpretation,
and logic in making their recommendations was very useful.

ia

Dr. V. H. Smith - Drs, Moiseev and Moskalev were reasonably well
acquainted with the field of therapy for plutonium poisoning but

not intimately in terms of details or recent Soviet literature; the
former because his field was more on the ecological side, and the
latter because he has concentrated on radiation effects and ceased
active work on removal about ten years ago. Dr. Moskalev was inter> }
ested in our plans to test phosphorothioic acids as removal agents

and mentioned his own work on the removal of Ce with DTPA as an
evamnle of re rimind of treatment. Hu svated DIPA was diven lov

to humans in the USSR, not by inhalation, ana that Zn-DuPA was not
used or being experimented with. The latter is difficult to believe,
due to his former close relationship with Dr. Catsch. He was not
Batisfied with the lack of side effects of multiplé"prPa treatments
and said that some problems with bone in long-term experiments could
be due to DTPA but he wasn't aware of the details. Answers te ques
about other treatments than DTPA, experience in treating humans, or
future plans were now obtained because presuucbly this was not a
primary research concern of Dr. Moskaley, although he did state
there was considerable research effort in this field.

Dr. C. L. Sanders discussed our low-level inhaled ??8puv, studies
(ige-span), metabolism of plutonium and cellular interaction with
PuOg particles. The Russians were particularly informative in
describing their low-level life span studies with 29Pu. It was
learned that Dr. Moiseev is primarily a radioecologist who worked
in Siberia and is familiar with oil pipe lines and associated
ecological problems such as arctic and lake pollution problens.

Dr. J. E. Ballou discussed their studies with soluble plutonium
compounds, comparative metabolism and effects of DTPA, and our
americium, plutonium, and cerium work. Dr. Moskalev had tricd
inhaled EDTA therapy many years ago to no avail. He was intere:
in our work with age effects on gut absorption and wanted to kn
why the very young absorb more plutonium. He agreed there is _
prolonged gut transit time and different intestinal morphology in

He was familiar with the mail order concept bnt we could not é@ster
for certain that it is common in the USSR. _Both Drs. Moskalev and

The visitors also expressed interest in our standard of living. ‘the
visits to our homes seemed to dispel some doubts they might have had

Dr. R. Hasse,; CEA as above,

Hrs, Anng Low-Beer picked up the four guests in Sm Francisco and brought
them to the Donner Laboratory where they were greeted by Dr. John Lawrence,
Drs. Donald Van Dyke, James MoRae, and Howard Parker took them on a short.
tour of the Anger camera facility and whole-body counting and scanning
equipment. The current uses and potential in medical diagnosis were dis-
cussed. Major questions concerned the use of these instruments in monit-
oring and assessing the extent of persons contaminated with radionuclides
in industrial accidents.

Lunch was attended by Dr. Hardin Jones, the four guests, Drs. Van Dyke and
Parker, and Dr. Patricia Durbin, who acted as hostess and guide through
the day. Topics discussed at lunch were centered about the Transuranium
symposium. The efficacy of two new techniques to remove lung contamina-
tion by-alpha-emitting isotopes yas considered. The two techniques are
lung lavage and aerosolized chdghting agents, particularly DTPA.

A tour of Bldg. 74 followed lunch. Three of the visitors are biclogists-~

Bes ligsialiey and Nénot arguphysicians.end Dr. Masse is a veterinarian -~

ie animal experiments or the interpretation of the results

of animal experiments. They were much interested in how one achieved
and managed a "biologically clean" rodent colony, in the minimum mainte=
nance rabbit rooms, and tho cage-washing facilities. There was some
discussion about the 90-Sr-injected monkeys, ther exposure levels, years
of follow-up, and the essential absence of biological effects at the

~ dose levels in the study.

A two-hour general discussion between and among the four guests and Dr.
Durbin followed the building tour. The chief topics discussed were how
to explain the observed differences in the metabolism of the transuranic
elements among species. The usefulness and vorifiability of models of
human Pu metabélism were considered at great length, New areas of re=
search in internal emitters problems were considered including the influ-
ence of age on local dose and ultimate biological end-points; the useful~
ness of common experiments with various species particularly those with
known variations in iron metabolism, bone formation rates and liver func~
Gob i


&

Dr. Durbin proposed a collaborative effort with two of Dr.
colleagues. They have collected data on human skeleton wei; 5
now do not have the time or interest to write up their material.

Dr.
Durbin has collected all of the 19th century and early 20th century
human bone weight data and would like to add the modern Russian material
to the set. Dr, Moskalev agreed to propose a joint article with his
colleagues looking "towards publication in an international journal. He
sus ested that the original data would be forwarded in any case as soon
as it could be copied.

In the late afternoon the visitors toured (briefly) the Bevatron guided
‘by Ralph Thomas; the californium separation facility guided by Francis
McCarty; and the Hi-lac guided by Al Ghiorso, Dr. Moiseev, who is a
physicist, was very much intrigued by the proposal to make an advanced
scientific instrument by joining the Bevatron and the Hi-lac.

Dr, Moska~
lev was not intereste how the orked, "physics was not his
ut what he t might do in the nature

of radiobiology experiments with such machines.

Dr. Hoskaley regretted that it had not been possible to visit with Dr.
ee Could probably have fit in a few minutes or made arrange-
nents for the following day, but I had run them ragged with sight-seeing
the day before, Monday was very full, and frankly they were exhausted
and needed rest. pwd). They would also have liked to visit the Medical
Services group. Mrs. Low-Beor tried to fill them in on the duties and
routine of that group.

Comments on money, budgets, problems of communication, demands on timc

such as committees, etc, ran thpough all of the conversations. Dr. Nénot

and Dr. Noiseev spoke English and understood it well. Dr. Nokkaloy and |
Dr. Nasse understood more eoplish than they could speck. ALL Tour are .

chiefly odcupied with radiation protection and especially with problems

- raised by internal emitters. | Dr. Moskalev is his, country's representa-

ithe overriding interest in Pu and its transplutonium contaminants.

The Russian visitors will be guests of the AEC Division of Biology and
Medicine in Washington. (I fcel certain we will roceive good marks as
hosts ond as scientists. pwd).

One further point needs to be added. Although nuclear medicine is not
a cuurent specialty in either country, and the use of nuclear medical

techniques, especially as diagnostic tools, is very limited, the two

physicians indicated thay they personally were much interested, end there

was a definite trend in both countries towards more and more use of

such tools. "It is’ coming", they said.

near Kalinin. In 1922 hic family moved to Leningrad. He has Lived
in Hoscow since 1948. In 1958 he became the head of a divieion
comprised of approximately 30 people at tha Institute of Biophysics,
Soviet Ministry of Public Health, Moscow. He is the best known
investigator of the metabolism and toxicity of radioelemente in the
Soviet Union and has published a number of papers and reviews on
this subject. During his visit, he outlined his as yet unpublished
experiment on skia carcinogenesis in rate (dosage administered to
the body surface by sr°9 -y90 plaques on the sides of the cage) and

reported two percent tunors of the ekin aud soma mammary tumors
after a 245 rad‘exposure. Jt is obvious that he is a careful and

trustworthy worker.

2. Moskalev is conversant with English but not fluent, and has

some difficulty in finding the correct English words; however, with i

a little patience, scientific commnication is very satisfactory. :

Re is genial, frank, and possesses a good sense of humor. Ne prefers

Leningrad to Moscow, considering the former to be a wore traditional

1. The Soviet delegation to the Second International Congress on Radiation

tation from the USSR personally attended was a paper: entitled, "Disorders
in Enbryonal Development of Rats after Injection of 131z," by A M Lyaginskayay>
Y D Parev and S x Sinitsyana. Since this same experiment has been conducted
on the human enbryo, there was really nothing new or even interesting in

3, The most interesting work presented at the meeting from a personal point
of view was that of Professor J Lafuma, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France. He is
charged with the responsibility of setting the’ plutdnfum proteétién’ standards’ |
and removal techniques after exposure to plutonium for all of France. Lafima's

most impressive work involves the success he has had in removing copious
amounts of plutonium and other transuranium products from humans using DIPA.

Lafuma explained that from his point of view he was concerned with only

two primary aspects of human contact with plutonium, inhalation and wounds.

His studies have shown, of course, that the earlier treatment is begun the
better the results; but also he has found it easier to decontaminate an

area of the body exposed to plutonium through contact or a wound than to

remove it from the lungs. Lafuma has used intravenous injection exclusively
for the treatment of wounds and finds that a very significant amount of the
transuranium particles are discharged from the body in urine. For the treatment
of inhaled particles, Lafuma has used both DIPA aerosols and injection. He find
his results from injection are better than the use of aerosols, even in lung
decontamination.

1. AUS radiation biology researcher attended both the Biology and Ecology. of
Polonium and Radiolead Conference, Sutton, UK, 30 Aoril -1 Nay 1970, and
the Second Congress of i Radiation Protection Association,

Brighton, UK May 1970.

2, The nature of the Sutton meeting was such that few significant scientific ue
positions were taken: however, in general, the-qiiality of the paners
very high. The scheduled Soviet participants/ P V Ramzayev and/FNU,
were presumably not permitted by the USSR to attend; D Panov (Yugosla

eee ee syand B hjurte ROO OR Ce for unknown reasons.

The countries represented were UK (26), Italy (5), France (1), Sweden (2),
Poland (1), South Africa (1), and the US (7).

3. To the extent that the proper "half-life for lead in man" was discussed,
the consensus appeared to be that (a) the loss rate can not be represented
as a single exponential; (b) the presently available data on baboons and
beagle dogs does not extend for a sufficient period of time to provide a
measure of the "last slow rate loss constant"; (c) it is likely that lead
and radium loss rates will differ because of thé selective reutilization of
Pb dn bone. D Barltrop (UK) and US-researchers have been performing ;
experiments which indicate that lead is not bound’by red cell membranes,
but at sites in the cell interior. \ \ 7

4. CR HLLL (UK) provided a useful summary of the contribution of polonium
to human radiation dose. MWe stipulated that the distribution of polonium
will depend on whether it is administered as polonium per se or is allowed
to grow in an animal as the daughter of an ingested parent. This is a
significant consideration to biological researchers engaged in dose
calculation work.

2, Moskalev's paper concerned the results of a series of experiments utilizing of
an unusually large number of rats and mice. The numbers he used were far in
excess of those that would be used in a western laboratory, These figures
were undoubtedly meant to impress his western associates. The data he pre-
sented was primarily on Strontium 90, His findings indicated that Strontium
90 was mich more toxic than had been reported anywhere in western literature 1
and that it was more carcinogenic than has been previously reported. His u
technique was almost exclusively injections of radio nuclides. The control .
he had on hie animale was not explained, but very likely was very poor. He
claims to have been able to induce cancer in laboratory animals at permissible
exposure levels for atomic workers in the US. The animals were not examined

for radioactivity, only-for the existence of cancer. A respected US scien- :

that they are a few years behind the US in biology and radioisotope

knowing the effects and using them accordingly. In other words, we
are through with his reported work, feeling that it is completed; ap-

It appears to me that the Soviets have a strong tendency toward cxperi-
ments that enable them to study radiation effects on large animals.

They do not seem interested in radiation response — the effect on tissue;
on the other hand, they concern themselves with metabolic effects, which
are important because they are related to the ability to suppress immunity

Did Symposium contributions include significant advancements in research
on controlled thermonuclear reactions that nay be useful in determining
the feasibility of initiating uncontrolled thermonuclear reactions solely
without the use of fissionable materials which would produce large anounts,
of energy,.on the order of one kiloton or greater?

‘to the best of my knowledge there was no formal discussion ‘of any
nuclear reactions, as such. The great majority of the material presented
had to do-with biological effects, and the physicists at the Symposium
were using high energy machines largely to produce the radiation that’
Would be comparable to solar flare radiation.

“Was anything Proseaited on effects (of space Padietion on the human body?

speakers confined their references to purely laboratory observations.

have reservations about.

respect ‘to distinguishing among the effects of various energies of
neutrons and the techniques for neasuring these energies. I think it
amay be safely assumed that the Russians are using very advanced methods
for detecting and measuring the various energies of neutrons--the
dosimetry of neutrons.’ “In the biological effect, I think they are
way behind us. But they are much involved in the potentials of neutron
irradiation and their objectives are, I am sure, the effects of space

‘ radiation on human beings.

Actually, [V P] Afanastyev, who is a physicist, was even more sophisticated
than Hoskalev. <Afanas'yev's paper was entitled "Production and investiga-

11, azaia, there was no specific mention of this, but the interest ii

paciation was a major concern of the whole Symposium: the attempt to
ucidcte the FBZ factor and particularly the problem with respect to
aninals, like humans, where in the case of neutrons you have a

not have this change with x- gamma rays, but you do have it with fast
neutrons.

fiow is this neutron change manifested in large animals?

neutrons become soderated,. As they proceed through the tissue, the °
‘vonen in the tissue reacts with the ncutrons and there is a chanpe

very big one.

[A G] Searle of Harwell reported genetic effects of. low dose rate it

neutrons in mice finding that there were as many if not more mutations

get into cells in the interior of a large animal, such as a human being,
or will be moderated and changed into gamma rays. The neutron RBE for
rortality in dogs, as reported from my laboratory and Brookhaven, is
around 1. For small animals like mice it is more like three or four. So
there is this discrepancy, and it may be promising for large animal
research. Harwell, my laboratory, and the Argonne National Laboratory
near Chicago are now setting up to apply low dose rate neutrons in

sheep. This will be new work: and should have important results.

Were results presented on cosmic and Van Allon belt radiation effects
oa test organisms in such areas as lethal, metabolic, developmental and
genetic? :

There was nothing on this as far as I know, except for a paper fron the
Donner Laboratory people at the University of California, Berkeley
entitled "Some Biological Effects of 730 Mev Protons". This may
simulate the kind of radiation that occurs in space and this is why
they are playing around with it, you see.

Were .conclusions presented on determining the relative biologic effective
ness factor of biologic material when exposed to radiation from nuclear
testing?

Well, this kind of interest is implied in work with neutrons, | With e
neutrons there is this question of RBE and it was one of the major
points of discussion at the Symposium,

Did the Soviets say anything bearing on physical measurements of
radiation in space in teras of relative biological effectiveness factor
and implications for future manned space flights?

ALL I can say is that it is logical to suppose that this is what they
are after: good physical measurements of radiation of a type that
might be anticipated in space.

Was there anything said on mapping and profiles for space radiation?

There was nothing on’ this. \

What interest have thé Soviets shown in development and testing of nuclear
power: sources for thermionic power generators? Are the Soviets now
applying such generators?

There was nothing on this.

Did the’Soviets report progress in radiation resistant materials and
components for application to long space flight electronic equipment?

This Symposium was all biological, so there was nothing on this.

Was there anything from the Soviets on methods of radiation shielding?

' It was there by implication. The fact that they were talking about the

investigation of dose fields, the radiation of experimental animals with
protons of high. energy, implies that they would be-using some kind of

shielding to get the animal exposed. 5

ligucver., he changed. the title to "Problems of Kineticsof "ptake and Retention
of Radioisotopes, uring his presentation, it was suggested that the retention

he apparently spoke no » we concluded meant by this ie ra’

ts a continually changing aniral. In any event, his paper presented nothing
ew and could by described as bee ates er_ elementary.
In contrast, Prof Moskalev's questions throughout the four day meeting covered
a wide range of topics, and left one with the impression that he was a competent

individual. In response to questions, however, his answers were far from
satisfactory. He have no specific answers to questions regarding Soviet ex-

perience with radioisotopes in ran.
