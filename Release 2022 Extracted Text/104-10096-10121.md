SUBJECT + SLHORTZON-1 Report Mentioning Cuban
Minister-Counsellor Statement on the
Assassination of President Kennedy

REFERENCE : a. Kingston 22950 (IN 416072)

: b. New York Daily News Article, dated
20 September 1977

1. Reference: <A ZRWAHOO intelligence report, mentioned
that the Minister Counsellor (MC) of the Cuban Embassy in
Kingston, Jamaica addressed the regular monthly meeting of the
Communist Party of Cuba members assigned to Jamaica on 24 Sep-
tember 1977, The MC said, among other things, that Cuban exiles
such as FNU DIAZ LAN and others had been. involved in the
assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The MC did not
further elaborate.

2. Latin America Division believes that the basis for S
the MC's statement was, probably, an article which appeared in
the New York Dailv News on 20 September 1977. This article,
which is attached, quoted Maritza LORENZ as saying she, Orlando
BOSCH, Frank STURGIS, Pedro DIAZ Lanz, two unnamed Cuban exile
brothers and Lee Harvey OSWALD formed an assassination squad

which went to Dallas to assassinate President Kennedy. We know
of no information in Agency files to substantiate that state-
ment.

that Ms. LORENZ was a CIA agent. There is no official file on
M LORENZ, nor is there any information indicating that she
wits an agent er employee of this Agency.

4. we have asked Station Kingston to obtain more
information on the MC's statement and source, if possible.
We will prepare memoranda for the FBI, the Inspector General,
and the Office of the Legislative Counsel concerning this case
and include any additional information obtained by our Station
in Kingston. The memorandum to the OLC will be for passage to
