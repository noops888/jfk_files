MEMORANDUM
SUBJECT: Garrison Investigation of Kennedy Assassination:
Marshall Wilson HOUTS

1. HOUTS is the author of the article "President Kennedy's
Autopsy Was Bungled", which appeared in the 4 March 1968 issue of
Medical Economics. The article is condensed from the book Where
Death Delights: The Story of Dr. Milton Helpern and Forensic Medici
Dr. Helpern, the Medical Examiner of the City of New York, is the
actual source of the information. (There is no identifiable record of
Dr. Helpern in RID.) HOUTS is the writer.

2. HOUTS is also the source of the following biographic
information about himself:

28 June 1919, born in Chattanooga, Tennessee.

1935-1937, attended Brevard Junior College, Brevard, N.C.

1937-1941, attended University of Minnesota (received B.S.
and L.L.B.).

May 1941 -- September 1941, PFC, USMC Reserve. (He was
attending an OCS, was discharged at his own request to
become an aviation cadet, and then was not appointed
because of defective color perception.)

October 1941 -- December 1943, Special Agent, FBI (February
1943 to August 1943 in Rio de Janeiro under newspaperman
cover. October 1943.-- November 1943 in Havana as
an Assistant Legal Attache).

December 1943 -- February 1944, Unemployed.

February 1944 -- March 1944, Operations Agent, Eastern Air Lines.

April 1944 -- March 1946, in U.S. Army (served with OSS).

May 1946 -- October 1946, Special Agent, War Assets Administratio:

November 1946 -- July 1951, member of firm of Palmer and Houts,
Piperstone, Minnesota.

July 1951 -- June 1952, self-employed in Tulsa, Oklahoma, as
a salesman and investigator.

3. HOUTS unsuccessfully applied for employment with this
Agency in 1952.



SECRET

4. According to the description of the author in Medical
Economics, HOUTS is the writer of nine other books on legal matters,
including an eight-volume work on trauma.

5. HOUTS served with OSS in the China-Burma-India Theater.
[white in Burma he was asked by his Commanding Officer to participate 94

in illegal activity, because as a former FBI agent he could advise the
others involved. HOUTS agreed and actively participated in misappropriation
of weapons which were government property. He claimed later to the
OSS investigating officer that he had participated in the illegal activity
to obtain evidence. However, this claim is weakened by the facts that at
one point he deliberately destroyed some receipts which were evidence and
he actively participated in the action. The investigating officer recommended
that HOUTS be charged with conspiracy, larceny, and misapplication of
government property. There is no indication in the record, however,
that HOUTS was ever court martialed. |
