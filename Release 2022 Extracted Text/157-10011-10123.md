1.

Attached is Mr. Vasaly's examination of the

"'S"' or

Saroyan fund as it pertains to the request con-

tained in Mr. Kane's nemorandum of 12 April 1974.

2. I concur with Mr. Vasaly's analysis and rationale

that there does not appear to be any legal or moral grounds

upon which Wiley can base a claim for reimbursement of the

"'S" fund deficit.

However,

if Vasaly's suspicions are true,

1.e., Wiley is using the "s" funa deficit as a vehicle to

obtain a better settlement, then I feel that the additional

incromental payment to wiley would he money well spent.

3.

smalier or larger than the amount he claims and he be told

the new amount is an increase in his termination bonus and

not

a payment for the "s" fund.

MEMORANDUM TO: Chief,

RB/CD

SUBJECT

WILEY, Charles W.

#343 589

REFERENCE

: Director of Security Memorandum for the

Record, dated 12 April 1974 on the same

Subject.

1. Referenced memorandum concerns the termination pro-

cecdings relating to Subject and to his apparent claim for reimburse-

ment for an alleged deficit of $7, 475. 01 in the so-called "SARO!AN"

(or "S") Fund. The Director's memorandum indicated that a review

of the "S" fund will be undertaken in an effort to determine the

validity of WILEY's claim so that proper consideration may be given

2.

Instant memorandum attempts to relate some of the sig-

nificant factors which should be considered in arriving at an appro.

priate decision in this matter. Attached hereto are certain research

papers for reference in conjunction with this commentary. A recom-

mendation is contained in the final paragraph herein.

3. WILEY is a Contract Agent of the Office of Security and

functions under the terms of a contract, which has several amend-

ments relating to salary only, effective 1 July 1959. Review of the

contract discloses it to be essentially the standard form for a Contract

Agent. Nowhere does it specifically refer to or even contemplate :

the utilization of such a financial accounting device as a "SAROYAN"

fund. "Chester E. SAROYAN" is the pseudonym furnished by the

Agency Pseudonym Register for use in the covert handling of WILEY's

records. The contract preamble states that the U.S. Government

contracts with WILEY as an independent contractor for the submission

of certain information and related services of a confidential nature.

In the paragraph on Status, WILEY is advised that he is not an

employeeng the U.S. Government under this agreement and is not

entitled tohny benefits normally incident to an employee status.

addition to his basic compensation he was to receive 5% additional

salary in lieu of insurance, retirement, medical and health pro-

grams, etc. Regarding Travel, the contract states that WILEY

will be advanced oi reimbursed funds for necessary expenses incur-

red in connection with such operational travel as may be directed

or authorized by the Government.

This may include per diem in

lieu of subsistence in the course of such travel and while on tempor-

ary duty away from New York, N.Y. Payment and accounting for

such expenses will be in substantial conformance with applicable

Government regulations. As to Operational Expenses, it states

that WILEY will be advanced of reimbursed funds for necessary

operational expenses as specifically approved and financially

limited by the Government. Such funds will be subject to payment

and accounting in substantial conformance with applicable Govern-

ment regulations. A standard paragraph on Offset reflects that if

WILEY should receive any financial emoluments required under the

terms of this agreement from or through a cover facility, such

emoluments will be used to offset those due WILEY under this agree-

ment by the Government. Such emoluments thus received from or

thrangh a anger tacility sen erinemerged and agreed to be payerce!

by the Government within the provisions of this contract. It is the

opinion of this writer that this proviso does not refer to the type of

activity engaged in by WILEY whercin he operated independently and

not for a cover firm. It could not be reasonably maintained that it

was the intention of the Office that his income for the last thirteen

years was to be limited to the maximum of his salary. Another

standard paragraph covers Unauthorized Commitments and states

that no promises or commitments pertaining to rights, privileges

or benefits other than those expressly stipulated in writing in this

agreement or any amendment thereto shall be binding on the Govern-

ment.

4. The aforementioned contract is broad enough and flexible

enough to permit the payment of such expense claims as WILEY sub-

mitted and were approved and authorized by this Office.

It is some-

what difficult to trace the evolution of the "S" fund through its various

stages.

There does not appear to have ever been any firm set of

instructions established and/or conveyed to WILEY--certainly not in

written form. The fund's handling changed through the years as did

WILEY's activities and his headquarters handlers. It was intended,

HEuE candipogsulted, that WILEX would establish his own cover as an

independent researcher, writer, lecturer, etc. This obviously

would and did generate income.

In

order to build his natural

cover and increase his capability and potential value to the Office,

in the carly years overseas travel was not only permitted but was

encouraged. Separate travel allowances were authorized and in

several instances advances were given to enable WILEY to under-

take the trips.

No advance for overscas travel nor any sepalate

travel vouchers were approved and paid by the Finance Division

after 1904.

He either secured separate funding from other out-

side sources, including foreign governments, for at least part of

his expenses

or covered them himself and charged all or part of

the expense off against his outside income as reported in his "S"

fund accountings.

5. The first rendition of an "S" fund was for the period,

12/59-6/60 and it indicates he had had no prior outside income.

It should be noted that this pre-dates establishment of his firm,

World News Analysis (WNA). WNA, when established in January

1961, supplied WILEY only a portion of his cover. In addition to

this largely nominal nows service, he operated as a lecturer, photo-

grapher, writer, and in the years alei 1966, as an organtor any

public relations promoter, also.

6. From October 1959 to February 1964, travel vouchers

were submitted to this Office, authorized, and payment made in

cash to an SRS representative for transmittal to WILEY. These

vouchers covered primarily stateside travel, phones, operational

lunches, etc. In June 1964, the system was changed to enable

direct payment into WILEY's New York bank account and the first

such payment made covered his travel voucher for the period, 2/1-

5/30, 1964.

7.

No "S" fund accounting was rendered for the fiscal

years 7/62-6/63 and 7/63-6/64; however, commencing with the

calendar year 1964, annual calendar year accountings were re-

ceived. In April 1965, a travel voucher for the period 7/1-11/15,

In A 1965.

1964 was received. After some discussion about its merits be-

tween E. MENDOZA and C/SRS, WILEY was told to take reimburse-

ment from the "S" fund. Apparently WILEY had no advance warning

that this change was to occur. After some further discussion and

hold-uppf his travel vouchers for the first six months in 1965, they

were all approved by Morse ALLEN and paid by Finance Division

to WILEY's bank account. Subsequent to June 1965, all expenses

incurred, and/or claimed by WILEY, domestic and overseas, have

been charged against the "S" fund income and no separate reimburse-

ments have been made from Agency funds. The records reflect,

however, an intention that WILEY would submit these expense claims

frequently and regularly for approval. By 1967 this had disintegrated

into merely an annual return and WILEY's figures were not seriously

questioned. The rationale would seem to have been that he was going

through an exercise which involved pretty much an

accounting for

his own income and expenditures.

8. The figures utilized herein were necessarily essentially

supplied by WILEY, either in receipts, vouchers or reports. There

is and was apparently little opportunity for either pre-expenditure or

post-expenditure confirmation or approval of most expenses listed.

WILEY had a natural cover and worked under uncontrolled conditions

in an area remote from Agency Headquarters. This was particularly

true after 1966 when he submitted only annual accountings.

While the

nonentires may have actuair boce made, there was then, mad threr

is even less now, little real possibility lo determine the reason for

the expenditures and for whose benefit they were undertaken, It would

seem that his figures were accepted and deemed to be part of his

general activities and therefore part and parcel of his natural cover.

Some could have been purely personal and non-business related in any

sense, but to assume this is to question WILEY's honesty.

9. WILEY's income tax returns were assumed to be, hopefully,

honest and reasonably accurate. His federal return (Form 1040)

Schedule C- Profit or Loss From Business or Profession (Sole Pro-

prietorship) generally reflects his business activity to be "Writer,

Photographer, Broadcaster, Lecturer. " No business name is listeci.

His business

address is his home. In 1967 and carlier he also in-

cluded "Research" as an activity and showed the business name to be

his own name.

10. As his charges as expenses were left largely to his own

discretion, so was his

rendering of his "income" necessarily accepted

at face value. There is and was little possibility to audit or check

these figures. Various receipts and papers were submitted to support

RECEl, i manyin Mpse listed but there is and was no way to confirm whether all

income was shown. Nor was there any way of ascertaining whether

or not he made any genuine effort to produce "outside" income. An

Office memorandum in June 1967 states that WILEY said his wife

told him that he could make a million dollars in public relations work

if he promoted

something in which he was rcally interested. Also,

that WILEY said that that was true because he had not had his heart

in his recent work for us and, now, he plans to start selling America.

It is believed that much of his time since 1967 was expended in

domestic activities of the nature of those being generated by or

actively supported by the National Committee For Responsible

Patriotism (NCRP), of which WILEY has been the prime mover.

It

is understood that for at least some of his work with NCRP, he drew

remuneration. This does not appear in the "S" fund income (WILEY

has stated that he didn't feel that we would consider it appropriate

for him to include it therein) and it is impossible for this office to

ascertain whether he included it on his federal income tax returns

as he just shows a gross income figure on his Schedule C.

WILEY

was specifically advised on at least one occasion, by letter on 27

January 1964, that his taxable income should include all checks

incuired iron CRS/OS, as veil as his salary and in pridition the

return must include all outside income.

We have no knowleage

whatsoever relative to any income tax return accounting at other

than the federal level. On those occasions where overseas travel

was

involved after 1965, while WILEY was not denied permission

to travel, he was told that financing would be his own problem. It

should be noted that overseas trips have resulted in expenses being

charged to the "S" fund.

In most cases, the trips were followed by

articles in the media and he has continued to give lectures through

the years, obviously drawing on these trips for background. Income

was generated, therefore, from his travels but it would be well-nigh

impossible to render a valid cost-accounting on any specific trip to

determine whether it ultimately resulted in an expense.

11. It is believed that WILEY has no "paper" which would

reflect that this Office has any legal obligation to reimburse him for

the deficit he now shows in his Final SAROYAN Fund accounting, noi

does there appear to be any such paper in office records. As an in-

dependent contractor, he has been almost completely free of control

by this office. He has on: umber of occasions indicated in advance,

some/undertakings that he contemplated such as oveiseas trips.

must be conceded that had this Office made strong objection, he would

have altered his plans, to comply with Office considerations. On

an Official Routing Slip in July 1971, C/SRS noted "WILEY has

established a certain image as part of his cover which makes his

participation in these things almost mandatory. In other words

he can't be a 'little bit pregnant'." The foregoing was in refer-

ence to some of WILEY's stateside activities but is believed repre-

sentative of the Office attitude. As to the fund balances and deficits,

it seems highly unlikely that had WILEY shown a large plus final

balance, that this Office would have given any consideration as to

whether we had either a legal or moral claim to such a balance but

would have deemed the balance to be rightfully WILEY's. Mr. Edwin

REETZ, Budget and Fiscal Branch, Office of Security has indicated

that such is his opinion.

12. The same reasoning as stated above applies to any Office

moral obligation to reimburse WILEY for his alleged deficit "SAROYAN"

fund balance.

It is believed, but this is conjectural, that WILEY does

not really believe that he is entitled io such a payment but merely

hopes that this claim has enough reason and stature to give him more

Joreange toward a better termination setlemeni. He hao vicily

acknowledged that he probably has no legal claim. It is believed

that, despite the fairly substantial size of the alleged deficit in recent

years, at no time did WILEY prior to the termination discussiors,

request that the Office provide funds to climinate the deficit nor did

he even inquire as to the feasibility of such an action. An added

factor, however, which may have some significance is that, although

these

"S" fund accountings have been received annually, there does

not seem to have been any direct comment to WILEY regarding either

their character or the plus and minus balances he has shown therein.

13. Consideration must be given to the actual or apparent

significance of tendering WILEY any amount which is or would seem

to be, in response to his alleged claim. Should an amount closely

approximating his claimed deficit be offered WILEY, unless it were

carefully delineated in writing to be other than restitution for the

alleged "S" fund deficit and so acknowledged by WILEY that it repre-

sented a termination bonus and that he had no other claims against

the Agency, the Agency might be placed in the position of secming

to have honored his claim.

This would be unwise in that it might at

MeRceast appear that the Agency had villfully supported some of those

mdependently undertaken domestic activities and overseas trips that

Cabinet

would be embarrassing to the Agency if publicly surfaced. It is also

possible that WILEY then might seck to also garner the $4, 000.00

terminal bonus first offered him.

14.

It is the writer's belief that WILEY's reluctance to accept

the previously offered termination bonus is primarily motivated by

his desire to obtain as favorable a settlement as he can possible

maneuver out of the Agency, and, while he fully understands that

revelation of his past relationship with the Agency could be a source

of some embarrassment and concern, he does not have any intention

or desire to make any public disclosure of same. The writer cannot

assess what WILEY's mood and reaction will be, if at some time in

the future, it becomes patently evident to him that the Agency has

surfaced him to Congressional Committees. It is suggested that an

offer of some figure between $7, 000.00 to $10, 000.00 could be nego-

tiated for a total final relcase of all claims by WILEY at the present

time.

Fie could also be advised that no claim will be made by this

Office for any of the office equipment, fixtures, library materials,

and photo equipment which he may have and to which there may be a

ralid agency claim.

I have no records,

but as far as

I can recall, the only items covered were certain long distance

phone calls and a subscription for a specific newsyayer that

I'd been ordered to watch for particular information. in any

case, the amount of money involved was quite small.

UNITED SINTES & VERNMENT

Memorandum

TO

: Chief, Security Research Staff

FROM : E. Mendoza

.!'

DATE: 12 April 1965

SUBJECT: Saroyan

Telephone conversation on 9 April 1965 covered the following

matters:

1.

Tax and Saroyan Fund

Clarified items appearing in Saroyan Fund annual

statement, which is attached hereto, along with rough statement on

1965-activity in-Fund-Saroyan was advised that all finance-statemants

appear acceptable. Deficit figure carried over from 1963 has to be

accepted--no annual statement was received by me.

Note present

balance in Fund is $1257.

In view of Subject's plan to attend the Youth festivai

in August, I suggested Saroyan not repay us the $1000 advance for the

China trip, but keep it until he is assured of complete outside financing

for the Algiers trip. He would, as in the past, utilize this fund to

cover any deficit for his own travel costs, not for any of the group

which he supervises at the Festival.

2. Overseas Trip

Subject asked what the reaction would be to his ex-

tending his travel in August, to spend perhaps a month in South America.

I asked about the financing and he, as usual, refers to the Saroyan Fund.

He says that he hopes to secure further returns from his work in con-

nection with the China trip and he feels he could cover all expenses.

He mentioned taking what would be considered his "two weeks leave"'

while on this travel, so the entire travel period would be six weeks.

I told him to discuss this with you further if time

Permits on Wednesday or to set out details in writing.

SUBJECI:

Saroyan - Travel Vouchers

Attached is #b is the series of travel vouchers, covering period

1 January - 30 June 1905, nich I feel need some approval other

than mine.

On this particular voucher, there are four separate items for

reimbursement for encertainent or operational meals, totaling $15.00,

with"details"thereon shom on 5x8 attachment.

My comments belor

on Voucher Ho apply similarly to the other five still-unprocessed

vouchers:

1. Re Oliver Davidson

I have no idea what the comment "see several previous detailed

reports"is supposed to refer to. In 1963 Saroyan wrote one

meno recomending Davidson as prime candidate for Agency under-

cover intelligence position - like Saroyan's.

(FYI, this was

ding th poring sarojan vas out recruiting for a perconal

assistant,

and trying us conrince SPS that he needed an

assistant.

Agency information snow Davidson to hea piu

fessional bum who wants a caraer in soying, as Davidson hinsol

indicated in his correspordence with CIA.

I advised saroyan

to stay away from Davidson as he apreared to have nothing irom

which Saroyan could benefit.

To date I have seen nothing which

would change my opinion. It might be interesting to see some

current reports on Davidson or some detail on what he and Sazoyan

are involved in.

2. Re entertainment of YAF crowd

Since I levied requirement on Saroyan that he furnish us the

names of persons being wined and dined (larch 1965), it is

interesting to note that the saine people turn up on

the lists.

Good example is the YAf crowd, described by Saroyan as "leaders"'

I question the description since none of thepersons listad have

any position in lY lAr in any material i have seen. Furtner,

Bill Cardiner is a long-time personal friend of Saroyan who is

employed on one of the railroads and who is used by Saroyan in

developing photographs, etc. when Saroyan is busy. (Gardiner

RECEIVED FROMcidentally is avare of Saroyan's CIi eployment.)

SEP 30 1975 I would question whether the repeated entertaining of YAP people

is worth the aroenditure to either Saroyan or do sis. Furbhar,

CIA

in view of Saroyan's cover as "frea lancer", is this wise?

## Page 22

3. Increase in expenditures for entertaining

Since the beginning of 1965, Saroyan has a sudden increase in

clains for reimbursemant lor entertaining.

Up to this tine

he averaged one item for a 30-day period (exceot for overseas

trips) and such clain usually ran about $3.00.

During 1905

the clains suddenly jung to t, 6 and 8 itens per so day perioa,

and several of them ars lor amouats betreen 310 - 15.C0.

As you knoir, when SiS initiates the

processing on Saroyan's

travel vouchers, we automatically assume the responsibility for

authorizing payment, ard certify that all payments are in line

with Saroyan's assigments and in compliance with the usual re

quirements for expording Agency furds.

I don't feel I should

continue to process varoyan's vouchers as has been done in the

past, since I could not possibly explein the expenditures to

either OS/Bie or to CF/Contract Agents Section.

An undated memorandum titled SAROYAN, seems to have been written

either by Mendoza or Iighe apparently very early in Jan. 1900. Ivo

sections are pertinent to this financial sunnary.

"Travel Vouchers

No monthly travel vouchers have been approved for payment since

July 1965.

In view of fact that Saro yan had close to $1000 in Compari

funds, he was told to deduct expenses fron the fund rather than submit

vouchers for reimbursement.

In addition to vouchers, there are other minor expenses (purchase

certain items, certain telephone expenses) which were usually paid

Besides the SS tax problem, in the event Saroyan is used in

Washington, or is used in a very clandestine fashion, the present

metliou of depositing salary and voucher raimbursements into a dor tort

A copy of a 15 March 1966 lettez to Wiley from C. Tighe contains a

paragraph which states:

"Future vouchers for travel and expenses should be submitted

promptly as they occur.

For instance, any voucher received after May

30 for expenses incurred prior to that date cannot be reimbursed to you

under the arrangement which has

now bean setup.

Reflection on this

instruction to wiley indicates it to be an impossible one to follo: a3

it would require instantaneous submission of expense claims.

You may recall that in Dar. 1965 Viley rectived approval that
