FROM : L, L. Curran

SUBJECT: BAKER, Bruce Arman

On 7 Fepruary, this gentleman telephoned my office. His address is:

379 President Drive, N. E.
Blaine Village, Minnesota

Mr. Baker stated that he has been in contact with a Mr. MITCHELL
WERBELL, III of Powder Springs, Georgia. \

Mr. Baker says that Mr. Werbell is in the business of manufacturing

weapons and delivering them by air throughout the world. Mr. Baker

: understands that Mr. Werbell does this for the Central Intelligence

. Agency.

Mr. Baker says that Mr. Werbell is a supposedly reputable man.
Baker understands, from Werbell, that Baker will have to get a
CIA security clearance to fly for Werbell.

Mr. Baker has served in the military. He has had some paramilitary
training. He belongs in a "jump club" and now participates in
"freefali", etc. He has a Morse Code proficiency and a Radio

Z : .. License Second Class. He has Spanish language proficiency and would
be willing to collect for us.

This man persists-on pursuing me re this CIA/Werbell relationship.

I tell him I don't Imow a thing about it. It seems he has a smuggling
record when he was 17 and he's afraid this may keep him from getting
this Werbell "CIA" clearance.
