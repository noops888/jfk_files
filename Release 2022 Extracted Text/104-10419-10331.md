ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT
JOHN FITZGERALD KENNEDY
NOVEMBER 22, 1963, DALLAS, TEXAS .

: cet Ey :
On the evening of March 20, 1967, Attorney Edward Morgan,

+ 300. ). Farragut Building, Washington, Ds c., furnished the following ane

information relating to the assassination of President John F, Kennedy.

He advised that while this covered a wide range or field, it

probably arose as.the result of comments he made during conversations

_ in which he suggested Lee Harvey Oswald wzs_not the only person
involved in the crime. He stated that he did have information pertaining
to the assassination which he considered pertinent and relevant. He
said it was necessary for him, in his capacity of.attorney, ‘to. invoke the

_ attorney-client privilege, since the information in his possession was
derived as a result of that relationship. He added that it was. still’ :

- Possible for his clients to be prosecuted.” He pointed out that he was not: *
stating or implying his:clients were either directly or indirectly involved"
in the death of President Kennedy or could be prosecuted in this regard.
However, they definitely face possible prosecution for a crime not

_ related to the assassination of Kennedy. Due to their participation in--.
this crime, his clients learned of information pertaining to the President's
assassination. Mr. Morgan said he represented these clients on this”

specific matter. He did not elaborate on when they. sought his legal counsel. ..-

and he indicated he could.not fulfill his responsibility and identify them.
He said he gave considerable thought: to finding some way to make.this
- information available to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, but. as yet
had not:come.up with a solution. _He considered a possible waiver from
his clients but decided against. this because the type of protection they...
- needed: was for some competent authority to grant them complete immunity,
not only from prosecution but from the publicity that would surely follow.

~ If in the future it becomes possible to overcome all legal obstacles, he will

immediately make this information available to the Government and, more
particularly, the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

ASS ASSINATION OF PRESIDENT JOHN
FITZGERALD KENNEDY)

He related that when he fir.t heard the story from his clients
he did not believe it, but conducted enough inquiry to.satisfy himself
that his clients had some basis.in fact for their position and he felt they
were telling the truth. He pointed out he represented substantial citizens;
people who loved their country and had a high regard for the then President.
If their story came out now, they would be damaged bythe resultant’
publicity, and some prosecutor of the same type as District Attorney
Garrison of New Orleans could conceivably attempt to initiate prosecution
against them. At this point he noted that the charge against them might
well be conspiracy to kill, which is a crime, and in the case of his. clients
the Statute of Limitations "has not run.

In explaining this remark he pointed out that if he were a
Government investigator assigned to unravel all facets of the assassination

of President Kennedy, he would first concern himself with reading the.

newspaper articles dealing with the topic of.a Castro plot... He said he would
examine the Castro plot to.determine precisely. what. bearing it had.on the
assassination of the President. He indicated the newspaper articles had
considerable merit and were.on.the right track in regard to. the theory of
the assassination.

Without making any factual: representations, ‘ and- scouting: :

to theorize, he went on to relate that his clients, whom he again characterized
“as réspectable citizens, were called upon by a Governmental. agency a

assist in a project which was said to have.the highest: Governmental
approval. The project had as.its purpose the assassination of “Fidel Cast Astro,
Premier of Cuba, Elaborate plans involving many people were made.
These plans included the infiltration of the Cuban Government and the

’ placing of informants in key posts within Cuba. The project almost reached

fruition when Castro became aware of it and arrested a number of suspects.
By pressuring captured suspects he was able to learn the full details.

of the plot against him and decided "if that was the way President Kennedy
wanted it, he too could engage in the same tactics."' Castro thereafter
employed teams of individuals who were dispatched to the United States for
the purpose of assassinating President Kennedy. Mr. Morgan further

explained that his cliente (here noting that he, Morgan, was employed
by more than one of those involved) obtained information concerning
Castro's dispatch of these assassins from "feed back" furnished by
sources close to Castro. Continuing, he said‘his clients were aware 6f
the identity of some of the individuals who came to the United States for
this purpose and he understood that two such individuals were now in
the State of New Jersey. :

Mr. Morgan further noted that one of the clients he represented
was a high type individual of the Catholic faith. Morgan said he queried
him as to why a person with his high ethical standard had ever become
involved in such a project as the assassination of Fidel Castro. The
client indicated that his conscience bothered him; however, the. project

.. was so ‘highly patriotically motivated that this, in his mind, over-

rode personal ethical.or moral considerations.. He further described
how one client, when hearing the statement that Lee Harvey Oswald was
the sole assassin of President Kennedy, "laughs with tears in his eyes
and rial his head in apparent oe ie

» . “Mr. Morgan said if he'were free of the: attorney-client privilege.
to furnish full details,. the information that he would be able to supply
would not directly identify the alleged conspirators to kill President
Kennedy. However, because of the project to kill Fidel Castro, those.
participating in the project whom he represents developed through feed
back information that would identify Fidel Castro's counter-assassins in
this country, who could very well be considered suspects in such a
conspiracy. Morgan pointed out that from the information available to

him from his clients he could not declare or conclude that Lee Harvey
Oswald could not have committed this assassination alone.

Mr. Morgan pointed out that it was inconceivable to him that
an agency of the Government which engages in the type of operations
which he has described has not come forth to make this most important
data available to the Warren Commission. He declined to identify the

name of the agency but indirectly described it as the investigative agency
which conducts intelligence-type investigations cutside the United States.

- In conclusion, Mr. Morgan reiterated that he would immediately
contact the Federal Bureau of Investigation if he discovered ahy way to
reveal the full details of this matter.

In connection with the above it may be of interest to note that
during 1961, an investigation was conducted concerning a violation of
the Unauthorized Publication or Use of Communications Statute on the part
of Arthur James-Balletti, who had been arrested by local authorities in
Las Vegas, Nevada, on a wire tapping charge. ees course of the
-Balletti investigation it was ascertained that Robert Av“Maheu, a private
detective, was ‘involved./ Maheu claimed he placed wire taps in behalf
‘of CIA'S efforts to obtain intelligence information in Cuba through the \
jhoodlum element including SamGiancana, Maheu said he was placed in
{contact with Gighcana in connection with these intelligence activities
i {through John, n Roselli, a Los Angeles hoodlum. a

ee A representative of the CIA stated he personally contacted Maheu
during the Fall of 1960 for the purpose of using Maheu as a "'cutout" in
i contacts with Sam Giancana in connection with-CIA's clandestine efforts

{ {_ against Castro. Rok eee

7 ocala On May 9, 1962, former Attorney General Kennedy advised that
] afew days prior thereto he had been advised by CIA that Robert A. Maheu

. had been hired by CIA to approach Sam Giancana with a proposition of paying\

$150, 000 to hire some gunmen to go into Cuba and kill Castro. He further
stated CIA admitted having assisted Maheu in making the "bugging" installa-
tion in Las Vegas (referred to above) which uncovered this clandestine
operation and for this reason CIA could not afford to have any action taken
against Giancana or Maheu. Mr. Kennedy stated that upon learning CIA had
not cleared its action in hiring Maheu and Giancana with the Department of

Justice he issued orders that CIA should never again take such steps without

first checking with the Department of Justice.
