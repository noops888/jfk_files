Memo for File

Subject: ARRB request re "slug line" deletions

The policy of deleting ALL crypts & designators in the slug

line was questioned by ARRB members at the 18 May meeting:

with CIA.

The DO representatives present (Sander? & MCNair)

deferred to the Office of Communications.

Per 6 June 1995 discussion with (Don Hatch), DA/IRO, "the slug

line is strictly an internal distribution line", and the

release of crypts or other designators in the slug line is

not a communications issue; slug crypts are not "commo.

generated".

The DA has no objection to the release óf

otherwise releasable crypts in the slug line of CIA cables.:

The DA response was provide to J. Gunn, ARRB staff, and Bill

McNair, DO/IRO, via phone on

6 June 1995
