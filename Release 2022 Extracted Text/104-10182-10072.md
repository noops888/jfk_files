MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Operations

ATTENTION. - + Associate Deputy Director for Operations
FROM : Walter T. Lloyd i
: Associate General Counsel
Mitchell Livingston Werbell, IMT

SUBJECT”

“1, As:you are-aware, on the instruction of United States
District Judge Peter Fay (Miami, Florida Division), incident to
the Drug Enforcement Administration's prosecution of Subject
for conspiracy to import and distribute multi-ton loads of
marijuana, the undersigned made a detailed review of the files
of this Agency concerning Subject in August 1976. This exami-
nation was to ascertain any data that ran to Werbell's guilt or
innocence of the offense charged and any other data reflecting the
nature of the relationship between Werbell and the U.S. Government.
This latter requirement was grounded on the Court's view that
Wwerbell's voluntary reporting to the Agency and any government
condonation of his activities might be exculpatory in the eyes of the

jury.

2. In response, we reviewed the files, identified Agericy
contacts with Subject and prepared two affidavits: ont regarding
fon-employment by Mr, B. DeFelice and the second regarding
Werbell's relationship to the Agency by the undersigned. Copies
are attached. During the trial the first affidavit was shown to
counsel for Werbell by DEA counsel, Mr. Sam Sheres, at which
point defendant's counsel stipulated that Werbell was never 2 -
ve emal employee of the Central Intelligence Agency Sheres
subsequently returnied the affidavits to the undersigned at the
conclusion of the trial.

3, Regarding the relationship of Werbell ta the Agency, as’

"approved by the-Deputy Director, the undersigned appeared before

Judge Fay in his chambers on 31 August and under oath answered
questions of the Court concerning Werbell. A copy of thé transcript

of that proceeding is attached. You will note that Judge Fay requested
that all pertinent government records be made available to the Court

for its inspection. Accordingly, copies of Agency files were reproduced,
culled for "Brady-type" documents, excised to protect sources and
methods under the "SWP case criteria” and reviewed and approved by
Assistant DD/O-on the evening of | September. These processed
documents Were then handcarried to Miami by the undersigned on

2 September. :

4... The undersigned advised Judge Fay at 0830 hours on
2'September that'I had in my possession copies of all of the Agency

files of Werbell, "had culled them as to possible "Brady" documents
; sand was prepared to ¥eview them with the Judge at his convenience.

.|He was on the bench with a tight schedule and zsked that the possible

Brady documents first be reviewed by Karen Atkinson, the principal
counsel for the prosecution. The undersigned subsequently briefed
Atkinson on the nature of data in the possible Brady documents. This
resulted in a significant reduction in the number of possibles. The
undersigned gave Atkinson copies of the four unclassified OGC
documents related to the DOD revocation of Werbell's security clearance
in 1971. In addition, Office of Security documents edited and approved
for release to Werbell under his Freedom of Information and Privacy
Act.request.(Tabs A-and B of OS response), consisting of media
publications and security investigative data, were also provided
Atkinson. Due to counsel for Werbell raising an issue on Werbell's

use of a boat named "Venus" belonging to CIA, 2 declassified copy

of the OS skort investigative report outlining data concerning Werbell's
use of the Veniis to transport arms was also provided Atkinson. The
related OS Headquarters assignment document was rot provided.
Related DDO documents on the ownership-of Venus by the "JURE"
Cuban group were mentioned to Atkinson but not made available.

5. While the above dccuments were provided the Department of
Justice with the undérstanding they could be passed to Counsel for
Werbell due to subsequent events noted below, it is not certain that
this occurred. Specifically, the undersigned declined to release
additional "Brady® documents without consultation and instructions

Ory
Ue.



(=) oh aay

from the Court. The requested meeting was put off by Judge Fay and
@efendante subsequently rested their case. ‘The DOJ had little else

_ato add and the case went to the jury about noon on 3 Sept: mber. All
* the remaining copies of Agency ducuments were returned te Headquarters

by the undersigned the evening of 3 September. On 4 September the
jury. returned_a verdict of "not guilty." As a result, the bulk of
"Brady-type" Agency documents or Werbell was not provided to
counsel for:Werbell and Judge Fay reviewed no Agency documents.

It should be noted all copies of documents taken to Miami were excised
in-accord with the *SWP case criteria" and on return to Headquarters,

these were destroyed by the undersigned.

6. Asa related matter, on 16 November Mr. Arthur Egbert
of the Interna! Security Division of. the DEA contacted the undersigned

~-seeking background information on Werbell. TFe undersigned suggested

Fabé ‘st-review the files of the FBI on Werbell as’most of the data
“we have is contained in FBI reports. Should FBI data be insufficient
for his needs I-siiggested he seek access to our files in DDO and Office
of Security via the normal DEA Department of Justice liaison channels.

MEMORANDUM'FOR: Chief, SOG

SUBJECT + Mitchell Livingston Werbel II

: «1. twa advised by the Justice Department on 23 February that
Werbel has been! indicted and the trial is scheduled to begin on. 29 March
in Miami, Florida’) The charges relate to importing and distributing
qiiantitics of marijuana. With Werbel's propensity to raise his past :
affiliations with the Agency, we can anticipate problems during this trial.
An additional problem is presented because Werbel is defended by Edwin
Marger who was tié‘défense attorney for John Hawk in the B-26.case in
Buffalo, New Yerk in 1966. It was Edwin Marger who subpoenaed the CIA _

General Counsel a3 a-defense witness.

| 2. The Justice Department has.received information that a person
either currently or formerly affiliated with the CIA has been participating
[ in Werbel's meetings with his attorney. It would be appreciated if all
addressees could review their holdings on Werbel and determine if there
is any validity to any recent contacts with him. I would urge that instruc-
tions be sent to Miami that no, repeat no, contact with Werbel take place
between now and the beginning of the trial.

3. It would be helpful if each addressee could prepare a summary
of the various contacts Werbel has had with CIA in the past. Please check
to see if you have any information on a Colonel Bayard who was ki!led in

: Auanta, Georgia during the summer of 1975, Bayard, reportedly an
Hes associate of Werbél's, had previous contacts with the ‘Agency. It would
be appreciated if your responses could he received by close of business
‘ 2 March,

A flow K. Greand

MEMORANDUM FOR. THE RECORD, -
SUBJECT?” Alleged Activities of. Walter Mackem

1. ‘During. the week: of March 9, I lunched with Mr. Wesley
Dyckmam,  Oyckman isa former ‘Agency staffer currently employed
by the. Drug Enforcement Agency. During the course of our Junch-
@on: conversation,’ the name: of Walter Mackem came up.- Oyckman
told me that Mackem,. a JOT classmate of ours, had been fired by

-the -Agency.:« According ‘to “Dyckman, Mackem is now employed, in the

Washington area asa private investigator. In addition, accord-
ing to Dyckman, Macken is involved with a paramilitary activity
funded by some unnamed British source. The activity, which
Dyckman referred to as “the new land project" seeks to establish
a tax shelter on one of the out-islands of the Caribbean by
forcefully taking over the island and establishing a government
there. Mackem is supposedly involved in paramilitary training

of forces who would participate in this paramilitary adventure
again. According to Dyckman, the paramilitary training suoposedly

takes place in Georgia not far from Atlanta.

2. This is the extent of my conversation with Dyckman~on-tne~*~

above subject and I have no further information or details concern-

ing this.

SUBJECT: Press Reports of Ex-CIA Employees Involvement with
.. Persons under Congressional Investigation

1, Press reports of Sontator Lowell P. Weicker's investigation of

CIA's involvement with othe r government agencies surfaced the contact
of Lucien Conein of DEA, a former employee, with an electronic manu-
facturer named Michael Morrisey. The same reports have also tied
Morrisey with a Mr. Mitchell L. WerBell, Ill, who, according'to our
files, has claimed United States Government and ‘CfA connections in
the past. According to DEA, WerBell recently invoked the Fifth Amend.
ment when apsearing before Senator Jackson's Subcommittee investigating
DEA on whether or not he supplied arms to Robert Vesco. “Also, while -
not mentioned in the press, at least one retired CIA staffer and possibly -
two others may have been involved with Conein and Morriscy. The ex«
staffer is John P, Muldoon, a friend of Conein's, who currently is a
Private security specialist who has dealt with Morrisey in the purchase
of audio sweeping devices for kis business. Muldoon was resained by
WerBell curing first half of 1974. ‘The other two, Walter J, Macken,
-an-acquainiance of Conein's, anda Theodore J. Roussos, ‘bath of whom
were in contact with WerBell for possible employment ina scheme to

“publicized in February 1975 issue of Esquire by Andrew St. George.

was working on a story to the effect that the late Bernard Spindel, former
vowner of the Fox Company, was previously involved in “wire tapping for

Although Mr, Smith did not allege that cither CIA or DEA were associated
with the Fox Company or Svindel, our DEA source said that Mr. Smith had
no intention of dropping the story and we can expect

rther press coverage.

In conclusion, there has Leen no GIA involvement with the
B. R, Fox Company or with Michael Morrisey. Morcover, Mr. WerBell's
claims of CIA affiliation or suppurt over the years are simply not true.

SUBJECT: Mitchell Livingston WerBell HI (201-259910) .

1, Mitchell Livingston WetBell, who appeared in recent press
reports has for over a period of ten years been claiming to be a
répreseritative of the United States Government-and of CLA. The. facts
do not support this contention.

2. .CIA first learned of WerBell in July of 1959 when he contacted
General Cabel indicating knowledge of Cuban and Dominican affairs.
Mr. Thomas J.. Flores of LA Division was put in contact with WerBell
onsidered using him as an Fl assct. A POA was granted on
that he
dig not have the access to information as hoped and he apparently looked
upon his association with CLA as a means of furthering his various
business schemes, All contact was then severed,

3. From that time until the present Mr. WerBell has cropped up
in a number of nefarious activities whereby he inferred he had CIA connections
or support. He was reported to have been involved in arms sales to
Nicaragua and Guatemala, in efforts to gain recognition by certain
South American countries of the Cuban Government in Exile, and in an
abortive scheme to invade the Republic of Haiti in 1966. He also turne:
up in Thailand where he contacted the COS purporting “to” Counter-
insurgency expert. In 1971 the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense
queried thé Agency re Mr. Werkell, asking if WerBell ha¢ a contractual
agreement or association with the Agency, as Werheil was awaiting a hearing
before a Department of Defense Examiner related to his participation in
the aboritve Haiti invasion, The Office of the General Counsel placed the
matter in perspective. Subsequently, he contacted the Agency to request
intercession on his behalf to have his security clearance reinstated which
DoD revoked because of his Haitian caper. ‘He was told this, cculd not be
done. In-1971 he again appeared in Thailand attempting to scil arms: In
he Was under investigation by U.S. Treasury Bure: Aleenal,
Tobacco and Firearms and by the United States Customs Service for activities
relating to possible mercenary activities in Abaco Island, B s. In
this connection WerBell contacted three ex-CIA employees, John P, Muldoon,

3.32 aa



All three inviduals reported their involvement with the WerBell group
and had sought guidance from the Agency. In May and June they were
advised to break all ties with WerBell. On 27-June 1974 the FBI was
formally apprised of WerBell's overtures for their collaboration in

the effort'to bring:Abaco's seéession. In September 1974 WerBell
reportedly went to Greece to sell arms to the Greek Government,

Most recently WerBell reportedly appeared before Senator Jackson's
"Sub-Committee investigating DEA and had taken the Fifth Amendment
‘on the question of whether or not he had supplied arms to Robert Vesco.

MEMORANDUM FOR-THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Meeting with Theodore Roussos on 31, August 1974 :

af During subject meeting Mr. Roussos told me that
Mr. Mitchell Livingston WERBELL ILI called him from Atlanta
on 29 August and. again. on 30 August. Werbell told Roussos
‘twat he-was-leaving. for Athens on Saturday, 31 August in
order to try to sell arms to the Greek government. Werbell
~ wanted. Roussos. to be his advisor in this venture. and to
go to Athens; Werbell indicated -that ‘the total-deal could
reach $5,000,000, Roussos told Werbell that, he would
check with his “friends” (the Agency) before: giving
Werbell an answer. Werbell asked Roussos to see if his
“friends” were in favor of such arms deals or not. Roussos
had generally explained this call to me on the telephone
on 29 August. My reaction on the telephone was negative
cto Roussos’ participation in such a deal, and he had
conveyed this: negative reply to Werbell by telephone
before: Roussos and I met personally on 31 August.

2. During our personal meeting, Roussos explained
that Werbell intended to pursue arms sales legally and
via the required U.S. Government channels. He said that
Werbell does have ‘the capabilities to design and produce
weapons Decause of his access to arms factories. I told
Roussos that. Werbell's businesssactivities were his own
concern. i Strongly advised against his getting involved
in this deal. I explained to him the problems which the

_U,S, Government was having in Greece and the current wave
of anti-Americanism and press attacks against the CIA.
If Roussos.as a former CIA officer well known in Greece
became involved in sucn a venture, 2 flap of substantial
proportions was likely complete with widespread press
play. Roussos understood and agreed not to get involved.

Werbell.planned to meet.with Greek Defense Minister
Averoff. Roussos said that.:if, the U.S. wanted to stop

From what Werbel] said, Roussos believes. the arms-

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence
VIA: | Deputy Director for Operations —
SUBJECT: Mitchell Livingston Werbell III

‘ 1. Mitchell Livingston Werbell III, who served briefly
With the OSS in WHIT, has been engaged for the past several
years. in arms: dealings and swash-buckling promutional
Lactivities which have brought him tothe attention of various
ie agencies.. He has always remained within the

aw by’a-fine “edge: His latest scheme involves a. Movement
for the Independence of Abaco, an island to the East of the
Bahamas. For.this :he has»obtained apparently substantial
financial support from wealthy Americans and from a British

- Lord. :

2. Werbell operates through a number of front businesses
in Washington, D.C. and in Marietta, Georgia, where he owns
‘one outfit named Central Information Agency (CIA}. In all
his dealings, Werbell broadly hints that he has current id
connections with the Agency. we have just learned that
Werbell may be in possession of a one-line note from you,
stemming from a chance meeting with you at an OSS alumni
dinner, reading something like “gocd to see you again.”

3. Three retired Agency employees are currently employed
by Werbell in various capacities. This past spring these
employees sought contact with tne Agency basically to report
their concern over the legality o: Werbell's activities. We
quickly established that the matter was outside our charter
and asked these retirees to report directly to the Federa
Bureau of Investigation.. we also f:rnished the Bureau with
all the pertinent. information in ou: files. ‘It is to be
noted that somewhere in Werbell'’s scheme of things there
appears the ubiquitous Andrew St. George, who plans to write
a story on Abaco for True magazine. ie

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Telephone Call from John MULDOON

1. Approximately 1655 hours, 13 August 1974, a call
was received on C/wH/7's extension, 351-4221 by the Secre-
tary, She answered the extension
by number and the male voice asked to speak to Mr. McTighe.
The secretary. asked who'was calling and the caller replied
john ‘MUCDOON." = The secretary then replied that she was

“-sorry but. Mr. MéTighe couldn't.be reached. In response to

‘MULDOON's..query, "Why not?" and before the secretary could
reply, MULDOON became obstinate and asked who he was speak-
ing to. replied "his secretary" and then
added that Mr. McTighe was away. When MULDOON asked where
he was, the secretary replied that she was not at liberty
to discuss that. “Then MULDOON asked to speak to McTighe's
deputy and was told that there was no one around whom
MULDOON could speak to. (C/WH/7 was on leave and AC/WH/7
was in the PMC meeting.) MULDOON apparently didn't believe
this reply but then asked when McTighe was expected to
return. The secretary replied “within a few weeks"
(NcTighe is on TDY) and then asked if she could take a
message te give to McTighe upon his return. MULDOON
became belligerent at this point, apparently thinking he
was getting the ‘run around’ and replied, “just tell him
to talk to Jack Anderson“ and hung up.

2. AC/WHD was briefed on the above telephone call at
1740 hours, 13 August. He decided no action should be taken
on 13. August, but would like to meet with C/WH/7, Al Spera,
on 14 August.

3. At 0950 hours, the following met with AC/WHO:

Mr. Natzke, Mr. Wedemeyer, Mr. Spera and Miss Lehman. In
view of C/WHD's previous decision that no further Agency
contact should be made with MULDOON, RUSSOS, or NACKEM it
was decided that no one would return MULDOON's call. How-
ever, AC/WHD would brief ADDO, Mr. Blee., on the above threat,
and WH/7 would ask OPS/LIAISON to telephonically pass to the
FBI the fact that MULDOON again contacted the Agency and
threatened to’ go to “Jack Anderson." A copy of this memoran-

dum is being sent to OPS/LIAISON. for this ‘purpose.

that.-he was nominal Vice President of a Was! ngton-based
firm called “Security Consultants International He presented _
yg the essential data he
cher menbe £:FOA’ whom

x gra
sd tobe. contingent on .Abacan independence.
oMre Mul ported that at least on two occasions WER BELL
“madé a. Con€erted effort to involve ‘persons formerly affiliated
with the Agency in the activities of the FOA in support: of

its independence. On. several occasions, WER.BELL introduced

Mr: Muldoon and“Mr. “Roussos as active Agency. officials, implying.
“that either the. Agency or the United States Government supported
vthe.aims of the FOA. ‘WER BELL also proposed. to Messrs. Muldoon:
-and Roussos. in Separate conversations that they. conduct a study,’
. involving. a visit to Abaco;-to- determine the feasibility of -
‘Abace’s independence in political and economic ‘terms. -The

study was to include interviews with citizens of Abaco prior
- to an aileged "plebiscite" on independence to take place in
Abaco on 28 June 1974. In default of the collaboration of
~either..Muldoon or Roussos, WER BELL hired Mr. Walter Joseph
Macken,..aforner.Agency:~ friend -of ‘both Muldoon and Roussos.
“According to WER RELL's file, Nackem later in 1974 contacted

the Agency in am attempt to get an official policy on the
activities of the FOA. Mackem was informed that the case

comes under FBI jurisdiction, that this Agency has no official
involvement, and that all information we had on the matter had
been made available to the FBI. He was advistd at that time

to report his. contacts and any information he had to the FBI.

7. On 24 March 1975, Mr. Joseph P. Hayes, assigned to
SE/PCH, rcported that during the weck of 9 March 1975, he
talked with Mr. Wesley Dyckman. Mr. Dyckman is a former Agency
cnployee employed by the Prug Enforcement Agency. According
to Dyckman; former Agency employee Walter Mackem was employed
in the shington.area as a private investigator. He is also
involved with a paramilitary activity funded by ‘some unnamed
British ‘source. .The activity, which Dycknan referred to as

“whe Rew Vand’ project" sought to establish a tax sheiter on

one of the ous-asianas ot the Caribbean b forcefully taking
over the. island and establishing a. goves nt there. -Mackem

gs supposedly involved in the paranilitary training of forces
who would participate in this adventure, -Actording ‘to Dyckman, |
the paramilitary ‘trai ing supposedly was to take place in’
Georgia, where WER BELL is ‘based. - \ :

&. On 31 August 1974, Mr. ‘Roussos met with Mr. K. Michsel
-Absher, who at that. tite wae AC/E/GC,.and told him that

WER.BELL was Teaving-for Athens..on 31.August to sell arms to

the Greek Government.“ anted Roussos to be’ his

advisor in this: venture and to go to Athens. Roussos-told

WER BELL that -he‘would check with CIA before giving him an answer.
WER “BELL “asked Roussos ‘to see if the Agency, was in favor of

Such an arms deal or not, Mr. Absher strongly advised against
Roussos* getting involved in this deal. Rousse: 's
that he, understood and-agreed not to get involved. Roussos
gaid that WER BELL would probably ‘call him from Athens and he

“would give WER BELL a final negative reply. -

9.08.22. July 1974, the -FBI reported that WER BELL may
be. in possession of a one-iine note from former CIA Director >
William Colby. stemming from a chance meeting sith the Director
at an OSS alumni dinner, reading something like ‘Good to see
you again." -This note was apparently used by NER BELL to
Yoggest that he and Nr. Colby were good friends. This infor-
cotton was passed on to Nr. Colby on 9 August 1974. :

10. According to reporting from several Stations, WER BELL
and Arthur L. Smith (a cohort of WER BELL's) were in several
Central Americ. countries during August and early. September... .-
1962. Their principal activity appeared to be contact ing
officials of the governments of Guatemala, Nicaragua, and
£1 Salvador for the purpose of obtaining recos ition of a
de facto Cuban Government in exile called the "United
Organization for the Liberation of Cuba." In discussions with
Nicaraguan Government representatives, WER BELL claimed the
proposed Cuban Government in exile had the support of 90
Ecparate Cuban exile organizations and 186,000 Cuban exiles.
WER BELL offered 2 representative of the Nicaraguan Go’ ernment
$100,000 to obtain that government's recognition of the Cuban
government in exile. The group clained to have its headquarters
oe 1028 Connecticut Avenue, Ni, in Sashingtony p.c. While in
Guatemala, Smith claimed that the croup had a man in the
Department of State in Washinston, D.C., whom they pay $6,000

per year “to, Keep, them advis

generators that supply electricity to Havana, Cuba. WER BELL,
Sethe time, stated that he was trying to get a "green light

mission would be called off if such approval was not obtained.
on 7 February 1966 the Milani office of the FBI :
thateKER BELL shad. been in contact with various news
agencies concerning. an alleged plan to. assassinate Fidel Castro,

Memorandum for the Record

7 Subject: Agency Retiree's Involvement. with
‘Abaco Independence Group 7 E

1.. Through the intermediary of Robert Brown,. DC/EA,
and retired staffer Jack "Red" Stent, I was put in-touch
» ‘on 22 May 1974 with Johh MULDOON, another retired staffer
who is now noninal vice-president of a Washingtor -based
firm.called "Security Consultants International.”
Be : . Muldoon made the contact with me apparently..on ‘the
breeReras advice of-Bob: Brown and Red Stent whose’ counsel he
° foo. |; Sought. invan ‘effort to protect himself from the possible
Hee : implications ‘of h nvolvement with a group promoting:
# the leperidence: eBahanian Commonwealth~island- of -
Abaco. We met at 1100 hours at "Tony's" on L street.
and 18th N.W. in downtown Nashington, Red Stent- was
there to introduce me to Muldooa but he did not Participate

in the discussion.

2. Muldoon presented me with a typewritten report
containing the essential data he possessed concerning
a group of individuals with whom-he had met on Friday,
: 12,May 1974 -in Washington. Attending the mecting with

‘ : : Muldoon on that occasion were Mitchel! WERBELL III (aka
zs : iacesnetereiaacid "Mitch Three"), Lord and Lady BELLHAVEN (alleged British
peers), Mike OLIVER (a wealthy clectronics tycoon of
European, ‘possibly French, origin who currently resides
in Carson City, Nevada) , Howard HANDELMAN (1 shington
correspondent of "U.S. News and World Report Renee
(inu) (the evening's object of Werbell's seomingly
voracious affections) and an employe of the Library of
Congress whom-Muldoon chose not to identify to me. At
a subsequent meeting on Monday, 26 May 1974, Muldoon
had lunch with WERBELL and free lance writer Andrew St.
GEORGE who is also involved with WERBELL in the Abaco
independence enterprise. ‘The Werbell. group is known
as the "Friends of Abaco” (already documented as such

in our files).

e seney

\ Mrowtodge of the background of the principals

Se A Aree bodge

ig essential to a comprehension of the affair as recounted
by Muldoon: aes i

a. Island of Abaco - From available file |,
information we know that Abaco is.a small island at the
north end of the Bahamas.archipelago a short distance.
off the Florida coast, which was populated in 1785 by
British Loyalists and their Black.slaves fleeing the
United“States following independence. The island remains
about'S0% white. Opénly apprehensive in. anticipation of
‘the Bahamas’ independence from Great Britain, the residents
of Abaco, both.white and black, have found themselves -
since :independence - the object of apparent antagonism

.and, adiinistrative neglect on the. part of the Pindling
“government, which Nas fueled talk of secession fron

Nassau rule. © This talk has ‘been institutionalized in an

“indigenous organization headed by a white, Charles "Chuck"
“HALL, ‘and.calTed“the:.Abaco’ Independence Movenent “(ATM).

HALb is a resident of Marsh Grove, the country cross roads
which poses as the metropolitan capital of Abaco; he
frequently visits Miami where he meets with Werbell.

b.. Mitchell WERBELL III - A PhiJadelphian,
WERBELL was a member of OSS in the Far East during World
War II where, according to Muldoon, he came to know the ©
Director and Lou Conein. Werbell currently a resident
of Atlanta, now is president of an international arms
peddling firn called Defense Systems International (DSI).
in addition to industrial security systems, according to
MULDOON, DSI sells automatic weapons (including a ninia-
ture machine pistol with a silencer) and bomb=booby- trapped
items of various sorts (e.g., a tennis ball with a fuse.
which is automatically activated when you stop playing)
and other Ja Bondian accessories. Werbell hopes to
establish ing casinos, hotels and other tourist
facilities in Abaco catering to the U.S. tourist crowd
available for easy ferrying from nearby Miami. As a
consequence of some run-in with Prime nister Michael
Pindling, hoxever, Werbell is apparently’ permanently
persona non grata in the Bahamas; hence his ambitions
appear to be contingent on Abacan independence.

“Eriends of Abaco," Oliver's origins and auspices are
somewhat obscure to Muldoon. OLIVER claims to have spent

che speaks excellent French; he has a pet political
theory which he has published. He is seeking some
political entity where he can put his theory into
Practice to illustrate to the U.S. government that it
is worth practicing’ in this country. In contrast to
this colleague Mitch Three Werbell, however, he seems
adamantly opposed to establishing: a gambling empire.

““d. Lord and‘Lady BELLHAVEN - A member of
the British House of Lords, .RELLHAVED plans to’ make

Ann Brown of E/BC

e. Howard HANDELMAN - The ‘us. News and
World Report Correspondent also has contacts with the
Agency, a fact which concerns Muldoon.

f. Central Investigation Agency - An Atlanta
detective Agency established a few vears ago by Howard
COSGROVE, a former Georgia police officer specialized
in narcotics operations who was apparently fired from
the force for reasons unknown to Muldoon. COSGROVE
retains a 26% terest in the CIA (sic); Mitchell |
WERBELL IV ("Mitch Four") holds another-26% and a re-
maining 6% interest is held by the nominal president of
"CIA," a retired Army colonel named Byer or Briar. The
"CIA" has in turn established Security Consultants Inter-
Rational, as a Washington-based wholly owned subsidiary.
SCI's specialities are anti-audio sweeps and electronic
surveillance using devices developed by one David MORISSEY,
an electronics engineer who collaborates with MULDOON &

“CIA.”

4, The incident which alarmed Muldoon occurred
during the Friday guthering of the individuals mentioned
in’ paragraph two. Muldoon palned-off by Nerbell at
this gathering as an “official of the CIA (Central



at

Intelligence Agency, in this instance)" vho was there
to attest to the fact that neither the CIA nor the U.S.
Government is. oppesed to Abacan independence. His
interlocutors, despite Muldoon's protests that he was
retired from.CIA and in no way represented U.S. government
interests respecting Abaco, seemed anxious - he felt -

to accept his: presence there as evidence of U.S.
government,-cndorésement of the Abacan independence .novement.

$< ..Muldoon took some pains to gain reassurance that
he wo not be pinpointed by Werbdell as the source of
this ‘information if any action were taken on it. IJ
assured. him that, apart’ fromthe particular incident on
17. May 1974, the general outlines of WERBELL and his
activities. and-aspirations for Abaco have already been
reportéd. by two-or three other sources... Since there is

“nothing the Acency can plausibly do’ at this juncture.

about WERBELL’S. apparent effort. to con ‘his supporters
into thinking that the CIA was backing the Abaco c
andependence. venture, I told Muldoon. I planned merely ~~
S side of ‘this story. a matter of record and

Tet it go at that. peeistatiiise a é siites

6. To.cap.off the story, Red Stent invited us to:
lunch at, the Class’ Reunion on Eye Street ard 18th. When
Muldoon and I’ arrived to meet Stent we found him ensconced
at a-corner table with three other people. Red rushed

over to inform us that he would be introducing me as a

colleague of his from AEROJET. He then presented me to
WERBELL, Werbell's date Patricia BOTOND and Cecil BROWNLOW.
of "Aviation Weekly." WERBELL, looking for all the world
like Jerry Colonna, was intent on the task of seducing

Miss, BOTOND, who happened to be promoting a convention

for the Atlantic Union organization, a political enterprise

which is an offshoot of the World Federalists Movement.

Miss BOTOND, as it turned ott was reared in Sh nyhai, China,
at the same time as Stent. Red had attended school with
her brothér.- the German Schowl in Shanghai. Miss BOTOND
had been expelled fro: he. German school in the late 1930s
for having had anti-N. doodles in her copybook.

Brownlow had helped Red obtain acrial photos of the

ChiCom consulate conpound in Geneva in the early 1960s
when Red was stationed in Paris. When Werbell had

wearied of the reminisences of Stent and Botond and had
managed to hustle his prey off to a private table, Stent
revealed to BROWNLOK that [ was not AEROJET but CIA.
Fortunately ‘my name was mumbled at the introduction so that
No one could have repeated it. No one in fact seemed
interested. ..

7, Following lunch Muldoon left witn a culleague

for a necting at the Justice Department ‘to. determine

whether in sweeping Enbassy buildings in Washington he
must register .as en agent of a foreign government
(whichever it aight be). Brownlow went about his
business. Stent paid for the lunch. I returned to
what Stent whimsically refers to as the "Funny Farm.”
My only regret is that George Orwell could not have
joined us’ for that lunch. is

The. following people were contacted by the writer:

day Mallin (December. 3, 1973;) Mallin states that to the
best of his knowledge there are ‘only two groups known to be active fn the
“Abaco Movement--the, group that ‘Kergel (Mitchell Livingston Wer8el III) fs
associated with and a group being headed up by a Bob Brown.

to occur Brown would certainly be fn the Miami area.

Brown is a white American and an ex-Special Forces type. He has
formed & group of. ex-Special Forces Specialists that-in Mallin's opinion
"could really raise Hell." Brom, according to Mallin, has been working for
‘Chuck Hall. However, Hall 1s alse aligned with Wesel.
