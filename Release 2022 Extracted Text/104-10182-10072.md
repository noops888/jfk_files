MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Operations

ATTENTION.

.: Associate Deputy Director for Operations

FROM

: Walter T. Lloyd

Associate General Counsel

SUBJECT

: Mitchell Livingston Werbell, II

I: - As you are aware, on the instruction of United States

District Judge Peter Fay (Miami, Florida Division), incident to

the Drug Enforcement Administration's prosecution of Subject

for conspiracy to import and distribute multi-ton loads of

marijuana, the undersigned made a detailed review of the files

of this Agency concerning Subject in August 1976. This exami-

nation was to ascertain any data that ran to Werbell's guilt or

innocence of the offense charged and any other data reflecting the

nature of the relationship between Werbell and the U.S. Government..

This latter requirement was grounded on the Court's vicw that

Werbell's voluntary reporting to the Agency and any government

cordonation of his activities might be exculpatory in the eyes of the

jury.

2. In response, we reviewed the files, identified Agency

contacts with Subject and prepared two affidavits: one regarding

non-employment by Mr. B. DeFelice and the second regarding

Werbell's relationship to the Agency by the undersigned. Copies

arc attached. During the trial the first affidavit was shown to

counsel for Werbell by DEA counsel, Mr. Sam Sheres, at which

point defendant's counsel stipulated that lerbell was never a

formal employee of the Central Intelligence Agency. Sheres

subsequently returned the affidavits to the undersigned at the

conclusion of the trial.

3: Regarding the relationship o! Verbell to the Agency, as

approved by the Deputy Director, the undersigned appeared before

Judge Fay in his chambers on 31 August and under oath answered

questions of the Court concerning l'erbell. A copy of the transcript

of that procceding is attached. You will note that judge Fay requested

that all pertinent government records be made a:zilable to the Court

for its inspection. Accordingly, copies of Ageney files were reproduced.

culled for "Brady-type" documents, excised to protect sources and

methods under the "SWP case criteria" and reviewed and approved by

Assistant DD/O on the evening of l September.

These processed

documents were then handcarried to Miami by the undersigned on

2 September.

4. The urdersigned advised Judge Fay at 0830 hours on

2 September that I had in my possession copies of all of the Agency

files on lerbel!, had culled them as io possible "Brady." documents

and was prepared to review them with the Judge at his convenience.

He was on the bench with a tight schedule and asked that the possible

Erady documents first be reviewed by Karen Atkinson, the principal

counsel for the prosecution. The undersigned subsequently briefed

Atkinson on the nature of data in the possible Brady documents. This

resulted in a significant redurtion in the number of possibles. The

undersigned gave Atkinson copies of the four unclassified OGC

documents related to the DOD revocation of Werbell's security clearance

in 1971. In addition, Office of Security documents edited and approved

for release to Werbell under his Freedom of Information and Privacy

Act.request (Tabs Aand B of OS response), consisting of media

publications and security investigative data, were also provided

Atkinson. Due to counsel for Werbell raising an issue on Werbell's

use of a boat named "Venus" belonging to ClA, a declassified copy

of the OS short investigative report outlining data concerning Werbell's

use of the Venus to transport arms was also provided Atkinson. The

related OS Headquarters assignment document was not provided.

Related DDO documents on the ownership of Venus by the "JURE"

Cuban group were mentioned to Atkinson but rot rade available.

5. While the above documents were provided the Department of

Justice with the understanding they could be passed to Counsel for

lierbell due to subsequent events noied below, it is not certain that

this occurred. Specifically, the undersigned declined to release

additional "Brady" documents without consultation and instructions

CS.

from the Court. The requested mecting was put off by Judge Fay and

defondante subsed sently rested their case. 'The DOJ had little else

to add and the cise: went to the jury about noon on 3 Sept mber. All

the remaining copies of Agency ducumenis were returned to licadqualters

by the undersigned the evering of 3 September, On 4 Septenber the

juy returned a verdict of "not quilty." As a result, the bulk of

"Brady-type" Agency documents or Werbell was not provided lo

counsel for Werbell and Judge Fay reviewed no Agency documents.

It should be notüd all copies of documents taken to Miani were excised

in accord with the "SWP case criteria" and on return to Headquarters,

these were destroyed by the undersigned.

.

As a related matter, on 16 November Mr. Arthur Egbert

of the Interna! Security Division of the DEA contacted the undersigned

seeking background information on Werbell. The undersigned suggested

Egbeft first review the files of the FBI on Werbell as most of the data

we have is contained in FBI reports. Should FBl data be insufficient

for his needs I süggested he seek access to our files in DDO and Office

of Security via the normal DEA Department of Justice liaison channels.

SUBJECT

: Mitchell Livingston Werbel III

114003

•1. I was advised by the Justice Department on 23 February that

Werbel has been indicted and the trial is scheduled to begin on 29 March

in Miami, Florida. The charges relate to importing and distributing

quantities of marijuana. With Werbel's propensity to raise his past

affiliations with the Agency, we can anticipate problems during this trial.

An additional problem is presented because Werbel is defended by Edwin

Marger who was the defense attorney for John Hawk in the B-26 case in

Buffalo, New York in 1966. It was Edwin Marger who subpoenaed the CIA

General Counsel as a'defense witness.

2. The Justice Department has received information that a person

either currently or formerly affiliated with the CIA has been participating

in lierbel's meetings with his attorney. It would be appreciated if all

addressees could review their holdings on Werbel and determine if there

is any validity to any recent contacts with him. I would urge that instruc-

tions be sent to Miami that no, repeat no, contact with Werbel take place

between now and the beginning of the trial.

It would be helpful if each addressee could prepare a summary

of the various contacts Werbel has had with ClA in the past. Please check

to see if you have any information on a Colonel Bayard who was ki!led irs

Atlanta, Georgia during the summer of 1975. Bayard, reportedly an

associale of Werbel's, had previous contacts with the Agency. It would

be appreciated if your responses could be received by close of business

MEMORANDUM FOR. THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Alleged Activities of. Walter Mackem

1.

During the weck: of March 9, 1 lunched with Mr. Wesley

Dyckman:

Dyckman is a

former Agency staffer currently employed

by the Drug Enforcement Agency.

During the course of our lunch-

eón conversation, the name of Walter Mackem came up.. Dyckman

told me that Mackem, a JOT classmate of ours, had been fired by

the Agency. • According to Dyckman, Mackem is now employed in the

Washington

area as a private investigator.

In

addition, accord-

ing to

Dyckman, Mackem is involved with a paramilitary activity

funded by some

unramed British source.

The activity, which

Dyckman. referred to

as "the new land project" seeks

to establish

a tax

shelter on one

of the out-islands of the Caribbean by

forcefully

taking over the island and establishing a government

there.

Mackem is supposedly involved in paramilitary training

forces who would participate in this paramilitary adventure

again.

According

to Dyckman, the paramilitary training supppsedly

taxes

place in Georgia not far from Atlanta.

This is the extent of my conversation with Dyckman on-the.

subject and I have no further information or details concern-

ing this.

SUBJECT: Press Reports of Ex-CIA Employces Involvement with

Persons under Congressional Investigation

1. Press reporis of Sentator Lowell P. Weicker's investigation.of

ClA's involvement with other government agencies surfaced the contact

of Lucien Conein of DEA, a former employce, with an electronic maru-

facturer named Michael Morrisey. The same reports have also tied

Morrisey with a Mr. Mitchell L. WerBell, Ill, who, according to our

files, has claimed United States Government and CIA connections in

the past. According to DEA, WerBell recently invoked the Filth Ameni.

ment whea appearing before Senator Jackson's Subcomminice investigating

DEA on whetrer or not he supplied armis to Robert Vesco. 'Also, while

not mentioned in the press, at least one retired CLA staffor and possibly

two others may have been involved with Concin and Morriscy. The ex-

staffer is John P. Muldoon, a friend of Conein's, who currently is a

private security specialist who has dealt with Morrisey in the purchase

of audio sweeping devices for his business.

Muldoon was resined by

WerBell during first half of 1974. The otier two. Walter j. Mackem,.

an acquainiance of Concin's, and a Theodore J. Roussos. both of wrom

were in contact with WerBell for possible employment in a scheme to

promote tre-secessión of the Bahamian Islard of Abaco, an enterprise

publicized in February 1975 issue of Esquire by Ardrew St. George.

2.

We have no information in our files on the B. R. Fox Coinpuny

or the fox Company principals mertioned in the press accounts.

We were,

however, told by DEA that Mr. Sardy Smith, Time magazine reporter.

was working on a story to the effect that the late Bornard Spindel, former

owner of the Fox Company, was previously involved in "wire tapping tor

the Teamsiers Union and providing explosive devices for organized crinic.".

Although Air. Smith did not allege that cither ClA oF DEA were associated

with the Fos Company or Suindel, our DEA source said that Vir. Smith rad

no intention oi dropping the story and ve can expect further press coverage.

3. In conclusion, there has been no CLA involvement with the

B. R. Fox Company or with Michael Morrisey.

Moreover, Mr. WerBell's

clairns oi ClA affiliation or suppurt over the years aro simply not true.

25 Jarsary 1975

SUBJECT: Mitchell Livingston WerBell III (201-259910)

1. Mitchell Livingston WerBell, who appeared in recent press

reports has for over a period of ten years been claiming to be a

representative of the United States Government and of CLA.. The facts

do not support this contention.

2. CLA first learned of WerBell in July of 1959 when he contacted

General Cabel indicating knowledge of Cuban and Dominican affairs.

Mr. Thomas J. Flores of LA Division was put in contact with WerBell

'and considered using him as an Fl asset.

• A POA was granted on

7 July 1959 for this purpose. By October 1959 it was apparent that he

did not have the access to information as hoped and he apparently looked

upon his association with CLA as a means of furthering his various

business schemes. All contact was then severed.

3.

From that time until the present Mr. WerBell has cropped up

in a number of nefarious activities whereby he inferred he had ClA connections

or support.

He was reported to have been involved in armis sales to

Nicaragua and Guatemala, in efforts to gain recognition by certain

South American countries of the Cuban Government in Exile, and in an

abortive scheme to invade the Republic of Haiti in 19o6.

He also turned

up in Thailand where he contacted the COS purporting to be a counter-

insurgency expert. In 1971 the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense

queried the agency re Mr. Werbell, asking if WerBell har a contractual

agreement or association with the Agency, as Werbeil was awaiting a hearing

before a Department of Defense Examiner related to his participation in

the aboritve Haiti invasion.. The Office of the General Counsel placed the

maiter in perspective. Subsequenily, he contacted the Agency to request

intercession on his behalf to have his security clearance reinstated which

DoD revoked because of his Haitian caper.

He was told this could not bei

done. In 1971 he again appeared in Thailand attempting to seil arms. In

1973 te was under investigation by U.S. Treasury Burea: c! alcoro!,

Tobacco and Fircarms and by the United States Customs Servico ior activities

relating lo possiblo morcenary activities in Abaco Island, Banamas.

In!

this connection WerBell contacted three ex-ClA cmployees, john i. duläcen,

Walter ji Mackern and Theodore Roussos in a scheme to loviro theid ind

the activities of an organization callud the Friends co Anaco toni whichlis

advocating the secession of the island from the Commonwealth of Bahamas.

All three inviduals repurted their involvement with the WerBell group

and had sought guidance from th. Agency. In May and June they were

advised to break all ties with Wer Bell.

On 27. June 1974 the FBI was

formally apprised of WerBell's overtures for their collaboration in

the effort to bring: Abaço's secession.

In September 1974 Wer Bell

reportedly went to Greece to sell arms to the Greek Government.

Most recently WerBell reportedly appeared before Senator Jackson's

Sub-Committee investigating DEA and had taken the Fifth Amendment

on the question of whether or not he had supplied arms to Robert Vesco.

Mitchell Livingston Herbell Ill

1.

Mitchell Livingston Herbell Ill, who served briefly

with the OSs in WWIl, has been

engaged

for the past several

years in arms dealings and swash-buckling promutional

activities which have brought him to the attention of various

"goveroment agencies.: He has

law by a fine edge.

His latest scheme involves a Movement

for the Independence of Abaço, an island to the East of the

Bahamas.

For.this.hehas..obtained apparently substantial

financial support from wealthy Americans and from a British

Lord.

2.

Werbell operates through a number of front businesses

Georgia, where he owns

one outfit named

Central Information Agency (CIA).

In all

his dealings, Werbell broadly hints that he has current

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Telephone Call from John MULDOON

1.

Approximately 1655 hours, 13 August 1974, a call

was received on

C/hH/7's extension,

351-4221 by the Secre-

tary al

She

answered the extension

by number and the male voice asked to speak to Mr. McTighe.

The secretary.

asked who was calling and the caller replied

"John MULDOON.": The secretary then replied that she was

sorry but Mr. McTighe couldn't be reached.

In response to

MULDOON's query:

"Why not?" and before the secretary could

reply, MULDOON became obstinate and asked who he was speak-

ing to.

replied "his secretary"

and then

added that Mr. MiTighe was away.

When MULDOON asked where

he was, the secretary replied

that she was not at liberty

to discuss that.

•Then MULDOON asked to speak to McTighe's

deputy and was told that there was no one around whom

MULDOON .could speak to.

(C/WH/7 was on leave and AC/WH/7

was in the PMC meeting.)

MULDOON apparently didn't believe

this reply but then asked when McTighe was expected to

return.

The secretary replied

"within a few weeks"

(McTighe is on TDY) and then asked if she could take a

message

to give to MeTighe upon his return.

MULDOON

became belligerent at this point, apparently thinking he

was getting

the

'run around' and

replied, "just tell him

to talk to Jack Anderson" and hung up.

2.

AC/WHD was briefed on the above telephone call at

1740 hours, 13 August.

He decided no

action should be taken

on 13. August, but would like to meet with C/WH/7, Al Spera,

on 14 August.

3.

At 0950 hours, the following met with. AC/WHD:

Mr. Natzke, Mr. Wedemeyer, Mr. Spera and Miss Lehman.

In

view of C/HD's previous decision that no further Agency

contact should be made with MULDOON, RUSSOS, or MACKEM

it

was decided that no one would return MULDOON's call. How-

ever, AC/WHD would brief ADDO, Mr. Blee, on the above threat,

and HH/7 would

aSk OPS/LIAISON

to telephonically pass

to the

FBI the fact that MULDOON again contacted

the Agency

threatened

to go

"Jack Anderson.".

and

A copy of

this

memoran

dum

is

being sent to OPS/LIAISON

for this purpose.

to Mr. Muldoon, NER BELL had hopes ofestablishing gaming

casinos, hotel and other tourist facilities in Abaco catering

to?the U.

tourist crond.

"As a consequence of some run-it

ambitions appeared to be contingent on Ahacan independence.

Mr. Muldoon reported that at least on two occasions hER BELL

made a concerted effort to involve persons formerly affiliated

with the Agency in the activities of the FOA in support of

its independence.

Onseveral occasions, wER BELi

introduced

Mr. Nuidoon and Mr. Roussos as active Agency officials, implying

that either the. Agency or the United States Government supported

the ains of the FOA.

WER BELL also proposed to Messrs:

In default of the collaboration of

WER BELL asked Roussos to see if the Agency was in favor of

such an

arms deal or not:

Mr.

Absher strongly advised against

Roussos' getting involved in this deal.

Rousses told Mr.

Absher

that he understood and agreed not to get involred.

Rous sos

said that HER BELL would probably call him fron Athens and he

would give WER BELL a final negative reply.

On 22. July 1974, the FBI reported that WER BELL may

be.

in

possession of a one-line note from

former ClA Director:

Willian Colby stemming fron a chance meeting with the Director

at an OSS alumni dinner,

reading sonething like "Good to see

suggest that he and Mr.

Colby were good friends.

This infor-

mation was passed on to Mr. Colby on 9 August 1974.

Arthur L.

Smith (a cohort of HER BELL's)

here in

"United

Organization for the Liberation of Cuba."

In discussions with

Nicaraguan Government representatives;

WER BELL claimed the

proposed Cuban Government in exile had the support of 90

separate Cuban exile organizations and 186,000 Cuban exiles..

KER BELL offered

a representative of the Nicaraguan Government

$100,000 to obtain that government's recognition of the Cuban

inside Cuba, to perform a connardo operation in Cuba during

carl! Januar! 1966..

Their prinary nission has the assassination

of Fidel. Castro, with the

secordary mission of bloking

up. the

generators that

supply electricity to Havana, Cuba.

WER BELL,

at the time, stated

that he was trying to get a "green light"

from ClA to

proceed with

the cission,

and

inferred that the

mission would be called off if such approval was not obtained.

On 7 February 1966 the Viani office of ihe FBI

reported that. HER BELL had beer in contact with

various new's

agencies concerning an alleged plan to assassinate Fidel Castro,

and reportedly.

also had discussed the plan

with Mr. Richard

Phillips,

Publie Affairs Officer, Department of State, Washington,

FR BELL claimed to have a group of some 500 men infiltrated

into Cuba and said that they were ready for action

to overthrow

the regine immediately following the assassination of Castro.

According to the FBI, WER BELL gave the impression

that he is

acquaiated with

many high goverarent officials,

the U.S.

and other countries,

and implied that his assassination plan

According to a memorardum in KER BELL's file, on 7

February 1968, one Bruce Arman

Saker telephoned an employee

of this Agency and said he had been

in contact with WER BELL.

Mr. Baker said that WER BELL was in the weapons manufacturing

business and delivered them by air throughout the world.

himself as a counterinsurgency copert,

encouraging a group of sahanian citisons on the island

of Abaco who seck to secede from the Rahanian Connonwealth.

In this affair HERbiLL has been collaborating with a

group based in liani called the "Friends of Ahaco."

Active in the friends of Abaco is Michel OLiVER, carson Chey.

cstablish a prototyne government based on princinies of

free enterprise expounded in a paperiaci bour which he

has authored

called "A Now Constitution for a New Country"'

(Fine Arts Press, Reno, liev. - 1969).

HERBELL, on the

other hand, has privately expressed a desire to establish

a torrist mecca on. Abaco to include hotels, recreation

facilities

and gambling casinos. Officials of loliday

with HERBELL in Washington in late May.

Despite the scening innocene of the enterprise,

with this agency in the activities of the

Friends of Abaco, in support of Avaco's independence:

On several occasions,

officers of this orianization,

Agency officials in such a fashion as to imply, according

to the persons involved, that either this agency or the

United States Government supports the aiss of the

6.

sost recently, HERDELl has proposed to both

retired officers in separate conversations that they

conduct a study, involving a visit to baco, to deternine

the feasibility of Abaco's independence in political and

economic terns.

The study would include interviers with

citizens on baco prior to an alleged "plebiscite" on

independence to take place in Maco on ¿s June 1974.

To be included in the investigation is rescarch on the

probable reaction in the United Nations Organization to

a petition fron political groups in Abaco for support on

independence, notably any parallels to be found in

precedents such. as the Biafra secession iron tigeria.

Subject:

Agency Retiree's

Involvement with

Abaco Independence Groun

1..

Through the intermediary of Robert Brown, DC/EA,

and retired staffer Jack "Red" Stent,

I was put

in- touch

on 2? May 1974 with Jonn MULDOON, another retired staffer

who is now nominal vice-president of a Washington-based

firm called "Security Consultants International."

Muldoon made the contact with me apparently on the

advice of Bob Brown and Red Stent whose counsel he

sought in an effort to protect himself from the possible

implications of his involvement with a group promoting

the independerce of the Bahamian Commonwealth island of

Abaco.

We met at 1100 hours at "Tony's" on l street

and 18th N.l. in downtown Washington.

Red Stent was-

there to

introduce me to Muldoon but he did

in the discussion.

not participate

2.

Muldoon presented me with a typerritten report

containing the essential data he possessed concerning

a

group of individuals with whom he had met on Friday,

17 May 1974 in Washington.

Attending the mecting with

Muldoon on that occasion were Mitchell WERBELL III (aka

"Nitch Three"), Lord and Lady BELLHWEN (alleged British

peers), Mike OLIVER (a wealthy electronics tycoon of

European, possibly French,

origin who currently resides

in Carson City, Nevada), Howard HANDELMAN (Kachington

correspondent

of "u.s. News and world Report"), Rence

(lnu)

(the evening's object of Herbell's secningly

voracious affections) and an employe of the Library of

Congress whom Muldoon chose not to identify to me.

At.

a subsequent megting on Monday,

20 May 1974, Muldoon

had lunch with WERBELL and free lance writer Andrew st.

GEORGE who is also involved with WERBELL in the Abaco

independence enterprisc.

as the "Friends of Abaco" (already documented as such

in our files).

by Muldoon:

indigenous organization headed by a white, Charles

Since there is

Into thinking that the ClA was backing the Abaco

let it so at that.

When

Muldoon and I arrived to meet Stent we found him ensconced

at a corner table with

Red rushed

over to inform

us that he would be introducing me as a

colleague of his from AEROJET.

He then presented me to

WERBELL, Werbell's date Patricia BOTOND and Cecil BROMYLOW

WERBELL, looking for all the world

like Jerry Colonna, was intent

on the task of seducing

Miss BOTOND, who happened to be promoting a convention

for the Atlantic Union organization,

a political

enterprise

which is an offshoot of the world Federalists Movement.

Miss BOTOND, as it turned out was reared in

Red had attended school with

her brother - the German Schoul in Shanghai.

Miss BOTOND

had been expelled from the German school in the late 1950s

for having had anti-Nazi doodles in her copybook.

Brownlow had helped Red obtain acrial photos of the

ChiCom consulate compound in Geneva in the early 1960s

when Red was stationed in Paris.

when Herbell had

wearied of the reminisences of Stent and Botond and had

managed to hustle nis prey off to a private table,

Deceiber 9, 1973

Interim Report - Perlod of

12/3/73 - 12/9/73

;.i

RE: Current Bahamian Situation

At Miami, Florida

Resuits of the Inquiry:

The following people were contacted by the writer:

Jay Mallin (December. 3, 1973.) Mallin states that to the..

best of his knowledge there are only two groups known to be active in the

Abaço Movement--the. group that Herßel (Mitchell Livingston Herßel III) Is

associated with and a group being headed up by a Bob Brown.

Brown is currently in Hashington and is about to return to his home

which is in Boulder, Colorado. Mallin indicated that if anything mere ahout

to occur Brown would certainly be in the Miami area.

Brown 1s a white Amertcan and an ex-Special Forces type. He has

formed a group of ex-Special Forces Specialists that in Mallin's opinion

"could really ralse Hell." Brown, according to Mallin, has been working. for

Chuck Hali, However, Hall is alse aligned with Herßel.

3.2

---

## Page 106

Mallin states : : all of the planning sessions

r Browni's group

have been held in the iiving room of Mallin's Coral Gables home.

Brown's 'group 1s all white but he has been in contact with some of

the local Blacks in Abaco. The Blacks have had no formal training nor do

they possess the proper weapons for any sizable operation. In order to

obtain weapons and training the Blacks have made friendly overtures to Brown's

group.

Mallin stated that some of the local 8lacks could move on their own

but he believes that it would be highly unlikely.

Hallin speculated that U.S. Maffa-money may be being spent in the

Bahamas in order to finance the overthron of Pindling's goverment to stop

the seizure of the casinos. He did not have ary evidence to substantiate the

theory.

In answer to a direct question from the writer Mallin further commented

-that Paul Bethal is totally out of the Abaco situation. Bethal's only role,
