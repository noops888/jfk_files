MEMORANDUM FOR:

Chief, External Activities Branch

Office of Security

FROM

SUBJECT

John H. Stein

Deputy Chief, Soviet/East European Division.

: Manuscript by David Phillips.

1. At the risk of tilting continually at windmills, it

is the undersigned's view,

and that of innumerable colleagues,

that Mr. Phillips' book should not be published.

In the first

instance, those portions we have read are superficial and give

the reader the impression that the profession which Mr. Phillips

practiced so well is one of derring-do, frivolity and foolishness.

More seriously, the entire book is based on knowledge acquired

by Mr. Phillips during his career in the Agency. Whether a

iven sentence is in the public domain or not, Mr. Phillips

should not put his stamp of authenticity on that sentence.

If publish Mr. Phillips must, and if the Agency cannot legally

stop him, then so be it.

Hopefully, while there is still time,

someone

will push for appropriate legislation to stop this

foolishness.

2.

While it is perhaps fruitless, we have attempted to

identify some of the more damaging items in the text as

drafted. These are cited below:

Page 15: Discussion of back channel communi-

cations used to circumvent the Secretary of State seems

to be

ill-advised and not designed to enhance Agency

relations with State.

b.

Page 23: There begins here a discussion of the

use of women

by the DDO.

While I understand

Mr. Phillips' desire to indicate that the DDO does in

fact hire women and minorities, this section causes

some anguish.

At the present time, certainly in the

Near East, Eastern Europe, and the

Soviet Union, the

•use of women provides us an operational

flexibility

which we would not otherwise have.

It is quite

evident, furthermore, that the local security services

have not focused

on the extent to which we do use

We would like to keep it that way as long

we possibly can, and it is the undersigned's firm

belief that statements from Mr. Phillips, obviously

authentic, will rather quickly bring the

women we do

use under

increased

scrutiny of hostile intelligence

services.

Further, in opening the Pandora's box of

the use of women and minorities in the DDO, Mr. Phillips

hiring

enough of them; similarly the minorities.

are others elsewhere in the government and probably

outside who

are knowledgeable about the incident.

The

girl, now a lovely lady, is about to be dispatched under

very sensitive cover abroad. Mr.

Phillips would do well

to

delete reference to her

as being an Agency employee.

d.

Page 26: I think it is unwise for Mr. Phillips

to conjecture on the reason why there are few blacks

employed in the DDO. His reasoning may be correct,

but I would venture that not everyone who reads his

book will believe

50, and

the Agency may come under

unfortunate pressure

because of it. The specific

black cited on page 27 as having removed a flag from

the hands of demonstrators is a personal friend of

mine phillips flag a5

He is under cover. By citing the

incident,

Mr. Phillips removes that cover, for the black re-

trieved the flag as an American

citizen, not as a CIA

officer.

In sum, I would suggest the deletion of the

involving

women and minorities because it

opens a

• Pandora's box and because

as written, the

cover of two highly effective officers is placed in

Jeopardy.
