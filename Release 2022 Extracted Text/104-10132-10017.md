in the allegations. Information in Security files Teflects that
ORLOFF very possibly 46 identical with a "Gount, FF of the

the Commercial Counselor for the Bulgarian Legation in securing

Paris who was living with and was engaged to marry Kiril VASSIIEV, ~.
who was believed to ‘be an agent of the Bulgarian Military Intelligence
Service. "Count ORLOFF" also helped arrange OTTAI's entrance into
the United States. Alexander S. ORLOFF and "Count ORLOFF" may well
pe identical with Klexander ORLOFF, Di-2861, a highly suspect
{individual of Russian birth, and a former MVORG employee who was

a 1943 OSS investigation, was mown as "The Count®s :

as a character reference by one Vladimir Vasily IVASHKOFF. (IVASHKO!

of the Russian Inni.grant Association in Tsingtao, China, accord=
