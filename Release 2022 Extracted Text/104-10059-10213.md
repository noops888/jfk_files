THAT THESE CONTACTS BE MADE IN THE MOST SECURE MANNER.

IT DEFINITELY DOES NOT PRECLUDE CONTACTS SUCH AS REPORTED

IN SANTIAGO 544 WHICH WAS A MASTERFUL PIECE OF WORK.

3.: AFTER THE MOST CAREFUL CONSIDERATION IT WAS

DETERMINED THAT A VIAUX COUP ATTEMPT CARRIED OUT BY

FAIL. THUS, IT WOULD BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO OUR

OBJECTIVES. IT WAS DECIDED THAT

GET A MESSAGE TO VIAUX WARNING HIM AGAINST PRECIPITATE

ACTION. IN ESSENCE OUR MESSAGE IS TO STATE, "WE HAVE

REVIEWED YOUR PLANS, AND BASED ON YOUR INFORMATION

AND OURS, WE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT YOUR PLANS

FOR A COUP AT THIS TIME CANNOT SUCCEED. FAILING, THEY

MAY REDUCE YOUR CAPABILITIES FOR THE FUTURE. PRESERVE

YOUR ASSETS. WE WILL STAY IN TOUCH. THE TIME WILL COME
