1. ' Events of 30 July 1962:

AWhIP arrived in Helsinki on 30 July 1962. He called HBFINCH.

according to plan, and after his second call (due to his hotel porter's

abysinal understanding of Inglish), Fallucci established contact. with

AWWHTP vithout further difficulty. The mesting took place in the

restaurant of his hotel, the Vaakuna, and later in his room. He had

not at this time located AMLASH, so the time was spent briefing AMWHIP

on the local scene, and on his conduct with AMLASH whan they met. The

meeting lasted

about one and a half hours.

Later the

same day we called AMwHIP at his hotel to report

no progress in locating AMIASH.

Feeling. It advisable to keep AM.HIP

occupted, we took him out to dinner at Fisketorpet, located in the

subuchs of Helsinki.

The evening lasted until 1200, terminating with a

drink at the tool par of the vaakuna.

suring the six hours, we nad an

opportunity to explain carefully to AWHIP that in order for us to help

his friend, ALASH must be willing to follow our directions and agree to

certain sonditiong (elready agreed upon by interested Has. parties).

AND realized that this was necessary, and agreed with our ideas. However,

he est aed to AMIASH, and will continue to look upon him in the most

benevfient and subjective manner. This being rather far removed fron our

intended approach to, and opinion of AMLASH: AWHIP will require handling

of a close nature in order that he fully understands and is aware of our

We met AMWHIP at 2100

at, our hotel, the lamo, and proceeded to the Royal Restaurant for dinner..

AWHIP was obviously getting on pins and needles because we had not found

his friend. He suggested that we call up the Cuban Festival delegation,

or try some notals that evening. We persuaded him that it was not the

test idea jet; and to give other people more time to locate him. He

agreed, but kept coming up with ideas all evening for ways to locate AMASH

He suggested that AMLASH liked night clubs; and that after dinner we could

perhaps try several. We agreed, more to placate him that with any thoughts

of success.

We tried several, the Bransparken and the Theater Crili,

both of which vere filled with drinking finns, but no signs of AMLASH. The

Finns, engaging in their national pastime, obviously irritated AMWHIP, and

he thought this was a waste of time. We agreed, grabbed a taxi and went

home. During the evening, we told AMWHIP that tomorrow morning, if nothing

had tumed up, we would start by calling the better hotels in town ourselves,

and try this rather laborious method to locate AMLASH. We agreed to meot

had suggested to us that the discussions shouid be merely devoted to

getting acquainted the first evening,. AMLASt commenced almost inmediately

As reported In our cable, (Hels 1609) AMASH was quite intense, and showed

the strein of his unexpected meeting with AMWHIP. Although obviously

under notional strain, AMASH presented his feelings in a relatively calm

AlLash said he had had plans to blow up an oil refinery, as he felt that

the continuing existence.of a semolenco of noral functioning in Cuba

depended upona continuing supply of petroiem, supplies of which, as we

know; are at a critical stage today.

He also wanted to plan the execution

of Carlos Rodriguez and the Soviet Ambassador, and also to eliminate Fidel,

by execution if necessary. He feels that If fidel is eliminated, it would

be much easier to effect a take-over. (We listened for the most part, but

at this point tried to esplain to AMASH that men like Rodrigue? could easily

be replaced by Moscow, and that the killing of the Soviet Ambassador, would

have only the briefest effect on the Soviet control of Cuba. AMLASH was

not too interested in listening at this point, and continued by saying that

if he could achieve all these actions, plus others, in one master stroke,

a take-over, during the ensuing confusion, would be much facilitated.. He

did not feei that Raul or Che would be able to rally the people in sufficient

tine to prevent, oposition forces frum forming. His arguments and pians had

many flaws, but AMWHIP could not help admiring (to himself) AMLASH!'s

professed desire for vigorous and, hopefully, effective actions, designed

to alter the situation in no uncertain terms. While we were making no

committments or plans, we pointed out to AMASH that schemes like he envisioned

certainly had their place, but that a lot of coordination, planning, information-

collection, etc., were necessary prerequisites to ensure the value and success

of such plans. AMlASH said he agreed with this, but we weren titoo sure just

impression that A'LAST feels that he did not get his share of the spoils

AMHIP stated that he did not think it acvisable to reveal any of these

negotiations to AMCONCERI/1, whom AMWHIP has known for many yoars and is

quite friendly, but whom he does not feel can keep a secret of this nature.)

This meeting terminated at 0030 on 2 August. The three participants

took a taxi together back to torn. AMWHIP and AMASH stopped off at a local

right club, Ieater) Grillen, while we continued on to our hotel. no incidents

of a security nature were observed, and it was felt that the meeting was

held without the knowledge or doservation of the opposition.

4.

Meeting of 2 August =962.

We met with AMHIP in his hotel room (No. 142 at the Vaakuna) at

1700 hours on 2 August.

We discussed the events and talks of the preceding

evening for some time. At approximately 1800, AMASH arrived, greeted

us affably, and joined us for a drink. AMLASH used this meeting to re-

state his vosition concerning is desire ior participation in a reäliv

significant action against the Castro regime. Having decided by this time

that further discussions and debrietings of AMASH should take place wit

te porsuaded ANT? and ANiS. that it would be test not. to have

furthe meetings with them in Helsinki, but that we could continue our talks

in greater salety in Stockholm and Paris.

They agreed. AMASH also said

that he felt that he shouldn't see ANHIP too much more in Helsinki, as he

was reginning now to make some public appearances, and his presence was

estatlished to everyone in the city. Incidentally, prior to Thursday,

2 Augist, AlaSH had purposely refrained from making any public appearanses

at the festival because (1) he and the other Cubans had been aware of the

A'SPEll group and their announced intentions, and (2) AMLASH did not feel

very disposed

to play the "Public Relations" man from Cuba and espouse the

"peaca and friendship nonsense", as he called it.

However, AMLASII also said

that he felt that he had better perform this role to some extent, as it was

expected of him by Fidel, and he did not wish to provide any unnecessary

chances for unsatisfactory reports to be sent back home concerning his lach

of cooperation with the Cuban delegation. In making the arrangements for

a Paris meeting and further discussions, AMLASH said, in response to the

question, that it would be quite normal for him to be in Paris, as he had

already cleared this with Fidel, with whom, he remarked caustically, one

had to clear everything these days. He then expressed the idea that he

return to prague for two days at most, in order to pick up his luggage,

then come as soon as possible to Paris.

There, he intended to visit a

nospital or two, as agreed upon with Fidel, and spend a total of at least

a week there. He said that if he was to return to Cuba to begin his

efforts, he did not wish to be away from Cuba any longer than necessary.

AMWHIP's thoughts along this ling.) AWHIP will try to get the stewardess

Meeting arrangements for Stockholm and Falsinki were laid on at

this meeting. AMASH felt he had to stay until the end of the Festivai for

caves purposes.

Other Youth Festival Targets.

The best

aid, actually, only possibility among the participants was Jose Venegas.

However, both AMASH and AWHIP did not want to become involved with him

as they felt that this, in both their cases, might compromise their

intorests in AMLASH's returning to Cuba. AWHIP felt, for example, that

Tenegas would almost certainly connect his presence here with an attemot to

do something with AMLASH. AMLASH also felt that he did not want to disclose

desirable. An approach could then be worked out at that time.

As reported, AMLASH came to the Festival as a "special delegate,"

aiter his request to fidel was approved. AMASH claimed to fidel that ne

was fatigued and sick and needed a good rest in furope. The Festival

provided the excuse, Fidel bit the bait, and AMASH got to Europe to see

service, U/2, or any of the Cuban delegates be asked, could determine the

were told not to tell of his presence to anyone not from their immediate

delegation.

statement, we feel that AMWHIP is a good security risk operationally, and

that with more exposure to the game, will become a good and useful asset

under almost any circumstance. He is, however, somewhat subconsciously

subjective about his evaluations of AMASH. He is completely honest, and is

using a considerable amount of his own money, not to mention time, in this

with him, AMLASH told AMWHIP a little different story, 1. e., that he

This time, however, he hopes to make the "operation"

successful, and never again subject the patient to another such ordeal.

Then when he is sure that the political and social outlook for the

Cuban people and the country are sound, he would like to try once nore

to enter private life as a doctor. He is not sure, however, that this

will ever come about. AMASH was also quite frank, we thought, in his

conversation with us concerning his views on the PBRPIME position vis-a-

vis Latin America. (And, although hẹ had noühing to say which hạs not been

said by many before him, they were interesting to hear from a disenchanted

Cuban revolutionary.) He feels that PBPRIME is simply not getting "through"

to the youth and students of Latin America, as are the Communists, and for

this simple reason alone, the next ten years (when these students become

the political and economic leaders in Latin America) will see us lose

the struggle for latin America. We replied by using the old line that

PBPREE realizes only too well today that there were serious short-comings

in our tatir American policy for a numher nt veers and that nna we are

doing what we can to correct this. However, it is not our policy (said

with tongue in cheek) to attempt to alter these conditions or influence

inerican youch; AliSh said that he understood why we take this point

of view, but nevertheless, if we intended to win the strugale, we must

do as the tomunists do, and disregard the archaic and doemed old-line

governments in Latin America. We agreed that this was undoubtealy the

more agressive way to deal with the problet, but that such methods would

leave us open to the old familiar charges of interference in the internal

affairs of sovereign countries. AMASH smiled and replied that from a

practical viewpoint this didn't make any difference, for if we didn't

act forcefully and soon, there woulon't be any opportunities there for us

to 'be open to anything! He then cited Venezuela as the next obvious

communist victim and thereby a loss of another opportunity for PBPRIME.

Obviously AMLASH was correct in much of his thinking, but rather than stand-

ing still with our shoes untied, we gave him the ball by soliciting from

him, as a former student leader and politician, any ideas he might have

for combating the Communists in the strugzle for the minds of Latin

american youth. He replied that he rould be glad at any time to disucss

this problem and to offer what ideas and suggestions he could.

As a result of the discussions of this evening, we felt that

AMLASH now was genuinely interested in getting Cuba out of its present

predicament with the active diu ui fornn

was a clever man, devious, and ambitious, and not to be taken too

Laraly at his word.

: In dealing with AMLASH, one trait of his which confronts the c/o

it cvery tgun is his tempermental reactions over points which would

gercrally be considered minor. For example, at one time when we were

discussing the various aspects of AMLASH's future role in Cuba; we used

the term "assassinate" :

The use of this term, we later learned from

WHIP and from MIASH himself, was most objectionable to the latter, and

he was visibly upset. It was not the act he objected to, but rather merely

the choice of word used to describe it. "Eliminate" was acceptable, but

obviously the term assassinate" had a distasteful connotation. From

@scussions with AMWHIP, this lable of "assassin" had been given to

ALLASH after some of his escapades against Batista supporters in the

pre-Castro era. Another example, which AWHIP discussed with us, occurred

during a meeting in Mexico City in March 1961, when a KUBARKEP said to

AMAsH, "I'm prepared to help you in any way within my porer". According

to ANWHIP, AMLASH later turned to him, shrugging his shoulders in a manner

of saying, "So I need help from him?" These examples are pointed out

here in ordar to indicato tho degree of pride anu seudiulvily one fina's

in AMLASi, and to note that however tedious this attitude may become to

the c/o, 1t 1s, from personal experience, quite necessary to adjust one's

approach accordingly in order to secure AMLASH's maximum cooperation.

the Paris meetings with peter. Kimington. Thru his good officewe were

able to arrange f95 precautionary survéillance of ANiTe and ANAS,

isa or a Station farehouse, and effect other arrangements as

necessary..

The cooperation and help off the Paris Station was excellent.

Following this meeting, we went to a small bistro near our hotel, phoned

AWHIP, and arranged for a meeting in our hotel room at 1830.

This meeting took place in our hotel room (#41) at the Hotel

Foblin, at 1830. The purpose was merely to acet AWHIP and re-assure him

that arrangements for AMLASH's meeting were laid on.

We also made

arrangements to give him his expenses for the trip and account for same

during a meeting the following day. This will permit him to leave for

Milan without delay at the close of our business with AMLASH. He was

getting "nervous", as he called it, and will be glad to get this business

over and done. We agreed. He wanted to remain until the conclusions of

the talks with AMLASH, however; for he felt that he could be of use in

handling AMLASH. We agreed. He did not, of course, want to be in on

any operational discussions, but just to be on hand to guide his

timpermental "charge

He was very anxious to meet Wallace A. Growerya in order to

point out to him in advance some of the quirks in AMLASH's personally.

In talking to us, AWHIP said that a person with the background of

AMWEIP. told us that while he is of course subjective about AMLASH, he also

realized that he is of a different background and make-up (flattery?)

than either ve or himself, and that in order to get him to produce and

cooperate, the problem must be approached in a certain way.

by personal contact over a period of time or on the recommendation of a

good friond. He felt that while it was necessary for us to spend some tire

becoming acquainted with AMLASH, It also might be necessary for Growery

but that-we felt quite enough time had been spent with AMLASH already,

and that the meetings in Paris were going. to get down to business quickly,

and proceed as necessary to conclude business as rapidly as possible.

ie felt that AMHIP understood our point.

During this talk, AWHIP again expressed the feeling that if

Cuba is not returned to ireedom within two years, he was goine to sei

up business permanently in Paris or Southern California, and forget the

Idea of returning. He was obvious moved by the finality of such a decision:

able to arrive before that afternoon,

and that a meeting with him could not take place before the 16th. Also;

ACHIP was reminded that he himself had stated that it would be best for

him (ANTIP) to talk to Jaime first in order to explain AlASH's personality.

AHIP was unhappy that this meeting could not take piace irmediatey,

but said he would explain the matter to AMASH. This meeting, it is noted,

cook place initially at a small cafe across the street from our hotel.

so that we could finger AMHIP to two surveillants of the Paris Station.

The two principles then retired to or hotel room for the reminder of the

meeting. We said to AMWHIP that we would check in with him by phone the

following day and inform him whether there was any chance of Jaime

arriving on that day, the 15th.

of discouragement and perhaps despondency. He was generally receptive and

Therefore, lu might well be that he is setually so pre-

and treated accordingly. When, on occasion; he "opened ip" a bit with us,

It was obvious that he had done, and was doing, a great deal of thinking

about Cuban problems. It may be that Growery will have much more to say

on this point; as their discussions were in AMASH's native tongue. On

many occasions, WLASH is rather exasperating to deal with, but ive feel

this Is a trait of his which is a normal fact of his personality,

and not assumed to try the metal of his case officers. We may. be wrong,

but doubt it.

27.

Physical Appearance:

AMIASH 18 about 5'11", weighs abont 175 ibs., dark vary hair,

thinring noticably on top and usually needs combing; brown eyes, small,

almost peptulant mouth, small nose, pale complexion, eyes are a little

small for his face and very intense in expression. He prefers dressing

informally, and is prone to wearing Jackets with no tie. (He could

mingle with the typical small town corner-loungers without difficulty.)

When dressed up, he presents a good appearance in a masculine way, and

apparenty iron irwiiris stories, does quite weil with the women. Concerning

the question of his being a homosexual, we cannot say whether he has a

hidden bent in this direction, but if he does, he is not at any rate, a

Language:

Native Spanish, fair to good English, but with limited vocabulary.

He can be successfully conversed with using inglish, out it has to be

done slowly and with bast constructed sentences. It is not possible to

be articulate with him, if he is expected to grasp the full meaning of the

conversation.

AMASE is on good terms with a Pan American stewardess of French

descent who is based in Miami. AWHIP said to us that he thought she was

with us, but we replied we really did not know.

AMLASH also is friendly

with the Cuban dancer Sonia CALERO, whom he telephoned from Paris to give

tie return date to Havana.

31.. Pastimes.

AMIASH likes nightclubbing and darcing. He is also interested

to a limited degree in architecture and historical buildings and sculpture.

It is interesting to note that AwHIP was reluctant to answer

many questions about AlLASH's private affairs. He felt that this was not

obtained by elicitation rather than direct questions.

32. AMLASH's Original Schedule in Paris.

AMIASH was interested in coming to Paris, executing his business

with us in the l'irst three days, then checking into the Cuba House or a

small hotel on the left bank, and soctalizing with the Cubans at their

Embassy in Paris.

He also wanted to spend some time on the Riviera

his taking the Riviera trip, and also postponed his seeing his Cuban

friends. He finally went to the Embassy on Tuesday, 21 August to make.

most of the men were away on vacations, etc., so that his late showing at

entertairment by the Embassy, and no one, it turred out, was expecting

him at any definite time after his leaving Prague. He felt mich better,

AWHIP reported, after he had made the Embassy appearance and learned

the above facts.

33. Money Banked by AMLASH.

At our last meeting with AMWHIP. on 23 August, he said that

AMLASH had given him $500.00 to be banked in Paris or elsewhere against

a rajny day. It is also interesting to note that while AWHIP said that

any offer of money to AMLASH would be an affront to him, AMASH readily

allowed AMMilIf to pick up the tabs for the hotel rooms and all expenses

and the plane tickets to rrague from raris. awact said that wnen they
