1, ‘ Bvents’ of 30°July 1962:
AMGTP arrived in Helsinki on 30 July 1962. He called HBFINCH
according to plan, and after his second call (due to his hotel porter's

aby:

sal understanding of Inglish), Falluccl established contact.with
AUEIP vithout further difficulty. The mesting took place in the
restaurant of his hotel, The Yaaleuna, and.later in his room. we had .
not at thie time located AMLASH, ‘go the time was spent briefing AMMHIP
on the local scene, and on his conduct with AMLASH. vhen they net. ‘The
meeting lasted about one and a half hours.

Later the same day we called AMMHIP at his hotel to report
no progress in locating AMLASH. Feeling it advisable to keép AMWEIP
occupied, we took him out to dinner at Fisketorpet, located in the
suburbs of Helsinki. “The evening lasted until 1200, terminating with a
rink at the roor var or! the jaaquna.--yuring ‘we sixhours, we nad’an
opportunity. to explain carefully ‘to AWHIP that, in order for ‘us to. help
his iriend, AMLASH mst be willing to follow our directions and agree to

catisd us at 1730, he presented us with the fact that he had convinced

{SH to talk with us, and for this purpose, he had arranged a. dinner

meeting that same evening ‘for approxinately 1930, ‘We would have preferred
to talk longer with’ AMAHIP about. AMLASH's reactions, but time did not
permit. We arranged’a dinner for 2100" at "The uhite Lady", a restaurant
gone way irom the center of town, and succeedéd, in obtaining # private
dining room, a'practice not uncommon tai thie Gtation reconménded restaurant,
as it is often used by businessmen to have private dinners and “aftervards,
business discussions. ; ;
We arrived at the thite Lady first, arranged for the dinner, and
awaited AMWRIP and AMLASH, who arrived at 2110 by text. Although AMHIP
had suggested to us that'the diseussions should be merely devoted to
getting acquainted the first evening, AMLASH comenced almost. iniediately
into a discussion of his fpslings’ and, his position condetning Guba today.
As reported in our cable,/ (é ars| 2609) AMLASH a8 quit intense, and’ showed
the strain of his unexpected necting with AMHIP: | Although obviously
under ‘notional strain, AMLASH presented his, feelings. in'a Yelatively caln

miuuicr', aud was ‘giveu wy discussing thei throdghost the mest

was considering not going back to-Cuba, but after talking to ANNIP, he

{| felt that if he could do sonething really significant for the creation of
| a new Guba, he was interested in retuming to carry, on, the fight there.

He said ne was not inveresvea in fisicing wus iiie, for auy duet Wied ed ing

but that if-he could be: given a really larée: art: to, pla ie would use

hinsel? and. several athers in Cuba whom. he could ‘rely span Thesé he said



vrom.he would not name.

SH said he could trust, but

AMLASH said he had had plans to blow up: én of2 refinery,.as he felt that

the continuing existence. of a senblenco of ‘votnal funotioning:in..Giba

depended’ upon a continuing’ supply of petrolem, supplies of which; ae. we
\imox, are at aeritical ‘stage today. “He also wanted to.plan the-execution

be mich easier to effect a take-over! . (We dietencd: for''the most” part; but.

at ain te M

oint tried to ax

be replaced by Moscoir, and that the killing of the'Soviel Ambassador’, would
have only the briefest effect. on the Soviet: control of Cuba.) AMLASH was.

not too interested in listening at this point, and continied by’ saying that
if he could achieve all these actions, plus others, in one: master stroke,

a take-over, during ‘the ensuing confusion, would be much facilitated. He
did not feel that Raul or Che would be able to rally the péoplé in sufficient
time to prevent, oppositiin forces from forming. His argunents-and’ plans had

many flaws,’ but AMVHIP could not help admiring (to himself) AMLASH's

professed desire for vigorous and, hepetully, efféstive actions, designed
to alter:the situation in no. uncertain térms, While we'were making no

cammittments or plans, we pointed out. to -AMLASH that schemés like he-envisioned

certainly -had-their place, but that a lot, of coordination, . planning, “informa

he was _ prepared to work towards that end,’ This time, he said,-he

after the fighting was over, We felt that AMLASH meant that "he was

‘as “imich“toncerned about his (AMLASH's) position -in' the government ‘and

“personal stake in a new Cuba, as he was"about aiything'eleé. Tt is. our

impression that AMLASH feels that he’ didnot get his share of the spoils

Batista. AMLASH is @ complicated personality. It is difficult to fairly

Judge, at this time, AMLASH's degree'of concern for a truly revolutionized

2 August, AMLASH had purposely refrained frow makeing any public’ appearances
at the Festival because (1) he and the other Cubans had been. aware of the
AWSPELL group and their announced intentions, and (2) AMLASH did:not feet :

very disposed to play the "Public Relations" man from Cuba, and espouse the.

"peace and friendship nonsense!', as he called it. However, AMLAGH also’ sai
that he felt that he had-better perform this role*te some extent, as it was
expected 6f him by Fidel, and he did not wish to provide’ any unnecessary
vhances for unsatisfactory reports to be sent back home concerning his lack
of cooperation with the Cuban delegation... Tn naking'the arrangements -for
a Paris meeting and further discussions, AMLASH said,’inresponse to. the

question, that it. would be quite normal for him to be in Paris, as he had

that arrangements for AMLASH's meeting were laid on. We also made

AMHIP continually stressed the point that to work with people |
Like AMLASH, it was necessary to have then fitst ‘accept: person either

by personal contact over a period’ of time or on. the recommendation ofa

but-that-we Jelt quite-enough tims had been spent with’ AMLASH already,

and“that “the tisetings in Paris were. going to gét downto business quickly,

and proceed as necessary to ‘conclude business as rapidly as possible.
We felt that AGHIP understood our point.

During this talk, AMMHIP again expressed the feeling that if
Cuba is not returned to freedom within two Years, he wad going lo seu

up business permanently in Paris or Southern California, and forget the

idea of returning. He was obvious moved by the finality of such 2 decision,

and that a meeting with him could not’ take place. before the 16th. Also,
was reminded that he himself had stated that it would’ be best for
