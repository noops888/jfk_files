AU

Gramatges is working full

time with the captione

organization in an administrative and organizational capacity.

The organization has recently learned that Antonio Guesta Del

alle, former Head of Comandos I, who was apprehended in Cuba

around the end of May, 1966, by the Government! of Cuban Prime

Minister Fidel Castro, was severely injured in the explosiont sA.

of a "PT boat" just off the coast. of Cuba.

Cuesta, according

to sources, inside Cuba, is still in very bad shape and is

confined to a Naval hospital in or near Havana. According to

Gramatges, these sources have reported that Cuesta refuses

to talk to his Cuban captors in Spanish, and speaks only English.

It is not known if this is an act of defiance on his part or

an indication that his injuries have impaired his mental

faculties.

Gramatges related that Cuesta and five other

members of Comandos I were engaged in performing some type

of mission inside Cuba.

They approached the Cuban coast off

Havana and held a position very near the Hotel Comodoro at

the foot of Calle 84, Havana, Cuba.

Four men departed the

boat, landed on the beach and proceeded to a wooded, un-

developed area adjacent to the Hotel Comodoro is

which is

located between the beach and Avenida 5. Cuesta and another

on a mission within the city of Havana.

Incidental to the above, Castro had placed Havana

on the alert. Two apprentice fishermen, 15 or 16 years old,

had been accepted into the Cuban militia that day and a short

time before the landing of the above four Cubans they had

been issued their weapons.

The two boys were walking on

Calle 84 in a direction that carried them away from the beach.

As they approached the intersection of Calle 84 and Avenida 5

they observed the two members of Comandos I leave the wooded

area and challenged them.

The members of Comandos I withdrew

into the woods and the boys very excitedly commenced firing

their weapons into the air. This disturbance brought many

Cuban soldiers into the area and the four Cubans in the

wooded area were killed in the ensuing engagement. * V

The

boat with Cuesta and the other Cuban was

located and attacked by Cuban patrol craft and airplanes.

This attack resulted

in the explosion which injured Cuesta:

Gramatges continued that since cuesta"s taptife

Ramon Font/ Saumel has taken over the leadership of Comandos

d In√§smuch as Cuesta was in possession of plans for addi-

Fional opgrations against the Cuban Government, all such k,S.p.),

plans have been changed.

Comandos I still plans, under Font,

to operate strictly within the laws of the United States

and operate from a base outside the United States.

intends to take no action which would create international

problems for the United States. All efforts will be

directed at establishing a clandestine operation from within

- Cuba.

No action is planned until after the November, elections
