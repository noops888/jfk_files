of a "PT boat"! just off the coast.of Cuba. Cuesta, according——""~
to sources} inside Cuba, is still in very bad shape and is
confined to a Naval Hospital in or near Havana. According to
. Gramatges, * these..sources have reported that Cuesta refuses
- to talk to his Cuban captors in Spanish, ,and-speaks only English.
It is not known if this is an act of defiance on his part or
an indication that his injuries have impaired his mental

1 faculties. ben

Gramatges related that Cuesta and five other
members of Comandos L were engaged in performing some type
of mission inside Cuba. They approached the Cuban coast off
Havana and held a position very near the Hotel Comodoro at
the foot of Calle 84, Havana, Cuba. Four men departed the
boat, landed on the beach and proceeded to a wooded, un-
developed area adjacent to the Hotel Comodoro;; which *Sy

located between the beach and Avenida 5. Cuesta and another
Cuban remained on the boat. Two men remained in the wooded
area for some unknown purpose and the other two left the

q wooded area near the intersection of Avenida 5 and Calle 84
on a mission within the city of Havana, uU :

i Incidental,to the above, Castro had placed Havana

on the alert. Two apprentice fishermen, 15 or 16 years old,

} had been accepted into, the Cuban militia that day and a short
time before the landing of the above four Cubans they had
been issued their weapons. The two boys were walking on
Calle 84 in.a direction that carried them away from the beach.
As they approached the intersection of Calle 84 and Avenida 5

- they observed the two members of Comandos L leave the wooded
area and challenged them. The members of Comandos L withdrew ‘
into the woods and the boys very excitedly commenced firing
their weapons into the air. This disturbance brought many
Cuban soldiers into the area and the four Cubans in the
wooded area were killed in the ensuing engagement. & Vv

The, boat with Cuesta and the other Cuban was
located and attacked by Cuban patrol craft and airplanes.
This attack resulted in the explosion which injured Cuesta, 7

problems for the United States, All efforts will be
directed at establishing a clandestine operation from within
