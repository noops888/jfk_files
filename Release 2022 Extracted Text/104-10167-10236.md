operational work with FIORINI and that it would be necessary

for hin to be cut out of any activities undertaken by CIA

Castro7. Reichhadt said that it would be difficult since

the three Cubams were fond of FIORINI and trusted hin

completely. (See DBA 43686, 21 June 63 in Pedro’ file

saying that Pedro did not consider FIORINI trustworthy.)
UMWA-9, August 59, concerning the above three who. planned

ops against Cuba. Originator of dispatch said that he:

cautioned the three about security; that they should! not

discuss with anyone else their plans and should tell the

writer (Patrick I, KARNLEY) if they did. KARNLEY stated

"however, there is a close and apparently unshakeable i

relationship with people like Frank FIORINI and other!

people with whom they were close during the revolution.

I have repeatedly cautioned them about FIORINI specifically

and they have always responded by recognizing that FIORINI is
3

a threat in that he talks too such, But as f we proceed
er

mae that

FIORINI and others are going to be frequently — this

group and we: will have only the word of these people. that he and
others are not being inforned of their activities.”
