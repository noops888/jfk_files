SW MX. JOHN

DIMMER (covert CIA) very informally

contacted Some of his

press contacts®

and furnished them

information strictly off the record from his own files

about JOESTEN.

He suggested to his

contacts that they

could perhaps discredit JOESTEN.

This

action

Mr. DIMMER

was probably taken

without knowledge of

own headquarters and was furnished,

¿to me on a very personal

basis and is strictly for the

Bureau's information only.
