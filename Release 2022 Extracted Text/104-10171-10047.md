Dias Lanz ‘in May 1959, and was involvod in sabotage activity with.the
Revolutionary Student Directorate. His immediate eupervisor wad SOG

[ known as "Charles" in clandestine ciroles. Alberto xusser,
the leade¥ of this group, arrived olandestinoly in Cuba in Qotobor or
November 1960 and began to organize the various groups of;Birectorate to
bring about an insurrection in the St deen. Eaoetre area, in Oriente Frovince.
These groups were mainly from tha province of Las Villas and Yavana, and
received orders to unite with “uller who was already in the Siegra sestra.
The men went there in small groups, and hed tho seminary in tha Santuario
del Cobre as their destination. Once in that spot, they received final
instructions and militsry equipment. Source's group, whioa vonsisted of two
carloads, entered the Sierra Maestra through Bayamo. Source war. riding in
the first car. When they arrived on thu outskirts of Bayamo, source's car
was. stopped by the militia, but the car wa, allowed tO pass without any
check. ‘A few minutes later thay realized that they were being 1ollowed and
tried to escape. An alara and shots went up, ‘and they were finally ceptured
and taken prisoner. ‘ae second oar, which waa following close behind them
and was warned by the shcta, was able to escape.

later to the Boniato Prison, where they were interrogated ty the G-2.
‘There wore two American prisoners ther2, and althouch source did not know
their nanes, he said that they were from the Guantanamo-Naval Base.

wuller was taxen prisoner a few days lator (shortly after tha ill-fated
invasion of Flaya Giron). ho arme were taken from hia when be was arrested.
Had this insurrection been successful, about 1,000 men would have risen up.


d. Of the tuller croup, which wae called the "127", about WO prisoners were
taken, five of whon, including vource, were eet free. One of theze wai
an infiltrator called Flores, whom no one trusted since they knew that,
he wou not “one of the group.". Another of these wae Rolando Valdes
D'#olf who ia now in prison in the Fortaleza de 1a Cabafia serving a nine~
yoar sentence. He was captured trying to escape ins cer celonging to a
militiuman and wearin,; a militia uniform. He defended himself bravely, but

eived five bullet wounde which incapacitated him. The other two who

wero released were Eduardo Diaz Lanz und Jorge Crus Pojie, a sergeant in
the Rebel Amy who waa with Castro in the Sierra. Tho latter hud actually
not been involved in the groups Source thought that he (source) and vias

Lant wore relensed eo that they’ might be followed and lead the Government

to other groups and individuale in Havana who might be involved in

Fesietance activity. Source had boen in prison six months tefore being

released, and one thing which he could not explain was that on the paper

that he wae given which indicated hie release, no mention was made of any

sentence or penalty.

@. On several ccoasions, Muller had been subjected to false execution
procédures, with the purpose of trying to make him talk, but he did not
weaken. During the trial, "everyone remained firm," and zource was told
that Muller was vory bravo in bis pronouncements against the Fegime and,
at every moment,: abided by his principles. He presented a very brilliant

self—defen:

f. When source was in the Boniato prison, he shured a cell with a Captain
An{bal Rodrf{guez, who belonged to the KR. This officer, aloni with other
rebel officers and soldiers, hud’ staged an uprising in Imias, in Oriente
Province. Later he was sentenoed to deati and shot.

During his last days in Cuba, source avoided all revolutionery activity,
since he wanted to leave Cuba more than anything else. However he knew
that the various resistance groups worked hard, carrying out e great deal -
of independent pabotage activity, although there was not much coordination
among ‘the various:.movements. One movement which had a.large membership,
especially in Orients Provinceywas the !-30-Il. Thio group was planning to
launch an insurréotion in Pinar del Rio in January 1962, but taey could
not carry it‘out since the repression in the area was so great.

hb. Hans, @ mombor of the Revolutionary Student Directorate, was recently
taken prisoner, and it seemed that he was tortured a yreat deal and
talked. As a result. of this, a house in wajay, in Havana Province, was
seized and arms and gelatina were found. The owners of the aouse and other
persons yere arrested.
