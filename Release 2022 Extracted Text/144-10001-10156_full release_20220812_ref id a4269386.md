MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: SSCI Request for Review of Cuban Product

1 February 1977

1.

On 28 January 1977, Tom Moore of the Senate Select

Committee on Intelligence staff came to NSA to review

materials requested by SSCI letter R#6009 dated 30 December

1976.

The material provided by G Group consisted of 485

reports on the Cuban agent problem for the period 1961-1965.

2. Mr. Moore had previously

seen a single message

involving an agent named "Serafin" which the FBI had in

their files and had

referred the Committee to NSA under the

Third Agency rule.

3.

Mr. Moore was extremely interested in the material

on "Serafin."

He volunteered that there was a Cuban agent

by the name of "Serafin" who had defected to the U.s. sometime

in 1965/66. That same person was killed in October 1976 by

persons unknown.

There was

some significant product in

May/June 1963 where "Serafin" was

to gave any cuban diplomata materia sod ene

to travel to Mexico - under

period.

4. Mr. Moore made a few notes of specific events but

did not request any copies of messages or reports for use

by the Committee.

5.

Mr. Moore told me today that he and Mr. Ed Greissing

(from the SSCI research staff) would be out later this week

for an additional review of the material.

This completes action on R/s 0008.
