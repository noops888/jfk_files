MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD 1 February 1977

SUBJECT: SSCI Request for Review of Cuban Product

1. On 28 January 1977, Tom Moore of the Senate Select
Committee on Intelligence staff came to NSA to review
materials requested by SSCI letter R#6009 dated 30 December
1976. The material provided by G Group consisted of 485
reports on the Cuban agent problem for the period 1961-1965.

2. Mr. Moore had previously seen a single message
involving an agent named "Serafin" which the FBI had in

their files and had referred the Committee to NSA under the
Third Agency rule.

3. Mr. Moore was extremely interested in the material
on "Serafin." He volunteered that there was a Cuban agent
by the name of "Serafin" who had defected to the U.S. sometime
in 1965/66. That same person was killed in October 1976 by
persons unknown. There was some significant product in
May/June 1963 where "Serafin" was to travel to Mexico - under
extreme care. Mr. Moore indicated that he would probably

like to review any Cuban diplomatic material for the same
period.

4. Mr. Moore made a few notes of specific events but

did not request any copies of messages or reports for use
by the Committee.

5. Mr. Moore told me today that he and Mr. Ed Greissing
(from the SSCI research staff) would be out later this week st
for an additional review of the material.

Dear General Allen:

The National Security Agency has recently provided the
Select Committee with certain intercept traffic relat-

most helpful to the Committee's efforts and would most
appreciate access to any and all such traffic remain-
ing extant at the National Security Agency.

Thank you for your ongoing assistance and cooperation.

Sincerely,

Eo wre Ne
