2022 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992

SECRET

16 October 1964

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Draft by Chief/CI/R&A for Reply to Army re

DUTKANICZ and SLOBODA

1. Raymond Rocca, Chief/CI/R&A, referred subject drafi

:0 SR/CI/R for comment to insure that our factual material

was properly presented. Jane Curtis of SR/CI/R handcarried

the draft back to him at 1600 on 16 October 64 and suggested

one change. This was in regard to the indications of

SLOBODA's pre-defection connections with the KGB. Jane

Curtis's 2 October memo gave the BEVISION report as our

main reason for stating that SLOBODA had such connections,

with the other facts as supplementary reasons. Mr. Rocca

had reversed the emphasis onto the secondary reasons, but

he readily agreed to change it back. His problem was to

soft-pedal the question of whether the Army had been given

the BEVISION report on SLOBODA, but as he pointed out himself,

the Army had also debriefed BEVISION and would have been

expected to question him about Army defectors.

Mr. Rocca is now discussing the matter with Deputy

Chief/CI, James Hunt. The draft has not yet been shown

to Chief/SR, but the finished product will be coordinated

with him.
