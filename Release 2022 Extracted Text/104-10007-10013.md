MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Draft by Chief/CI/R&A for Reply to Army re
DUTKANICZ and SLOBODA

1. Raymond Rocca, Chief/CI/R&A, referred subject draft
to SR/CI/R for comment to insure that our factual material
was properly presented. Jane Curtis of SR/CI/R handcarried
the draft back to him at 1600 on 16 October 64 and suggested
one change. This was in regard to the indications of
SLOBODA's pre-defection connections with the KGB. Jane
Curtis's 2 October memo gave the BEVISION report as our
main reason for stating that SLOBODA had such connections,
with the other facts as supplementary reasons. Mr. Rocca
had reversed the emphasis onto the secondary reasons, but
he readily agreed to change it back. His problem was to
soft-pedal the question of whether the Army had been given
the BEVISION report on SLOBODA, but as he pointed out himself,
the Army had also debriefed BEVISION and would have been
expected to question him about Army defectors.

2. Mr. Rocca is now discussing the matter with Deputy
Chief/CI, James Hunt. The draft has not yet been shown
to Chief/SR, but the finished product will be coordinated
with him.
