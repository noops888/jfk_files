WASHINGTON POST Request to Talk to an Agency

Specialist on the Kennedy Assassination

cuculatión en

the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the Kennedy

The WASHINGTON POST is preparing a series of articles onl

assassination.

with the help of CIC, we recently arranged for George

Lardner and Walter Pincus

of the WASHINGTON POST to interview

former KGB officer Yuri Nosenko about his knowledge of Lee

Harvey Oswald during the time Oswald lived in the Soviet

Union.

To ensure that Nosenko's resettlement identity and

location would remain protected, I made the arrangements for

Nosenko to come to Washington for the interview.

The POST reimbursed Nosenko for expenses and paid him a

$250 consulting fee.

The interview was done on Wednesday,

3 March, at the POST offices downtown.

I did not remain for

it. Lardner and Pincus also hosted a

lunch for Nosenko which

was attended by Ben Bradlee.

Lardner and Pincus were very

pleased with their session with Nosenko and appreciative of

our making it possible.

I also spoke afterwards with Nosenko

who said he was satisfied with how the interview was

conducted and with the financial arrangements.

Shortly after the interview, Lardner faxed me a list of

the questions that he and Pincus had prepared for themselves

to use in checking out Nosenko's information. They asked if

there was anyone at the Agency they could talk to about the

individuals named.

I told them that developing information

in response to-their questions would probably take a good

deal of research and that I doubted the Agency would be able

to take on such a task at this time for the POST. However. I

said I would take it up with the appropriate offices.

Although I told the POST that I do not believe anyone

would be willing to undertake research on their questions,

I'm wondering if there is anyone around who might be

knowledgeable of Nosenko's information who would be willing

to talk with Lardner and Pincus on background based on

his/her existing knowledge.

I think Lardner and Pincus would

be grateful for making such a person available even if

Dear MI. Summers:

This is in response to your letter of 25 May 1994 to

David Gries regarding

the possible existence of tape

recordings of Oswald's conversations with the Cuban and

Soviet embassies in Mexico City until at least April 1964.

As evidence of this possibility you cite FBI Director

Hoover's statement the day after the assassination that his

agents had listened to the tapes.

You also state that

Messrs. Coleman and Slawson recalled that Winston Scott

arranged for them to listen to a tape recording of Oswald's

conversations during their visit to Mexico City in April

1964 and that a senior CIA officer provided the tape to

them.

In its review of CIA files on Oswald and the

assassination of President Kennedy, the CIA Historical

Review Group (HRG) found no tape recordings of Oswald's

conversations with the Soviet or Cuban embassies.

We did

find transcriptions of such conversations and a number of

documents

stating that the tapes themselves had been

routinely erased prior to the assassination. Nor has any

tape been found in the FBI files.

The inconsistency you point out flows from a number of

misstatements and errors made in documents immediately after

the assassination.

While these were corrected, the original

errors continue to raise questions regarding the tapes.

following excerpts illustrate this point:

nor the photograph pertained to Oswald, ..."

2. FBI Director to the President, 23 November 1963:

"Special Agents of this Bureau... have observed photographs

of the individual referred to above and have listened to a

recording of his voice.

These Special Agents are of the

opinion that the above-referred to individual was not Lee

Harvey Oswald."

3. FBI SAC, Dallas, 23 November 1963 Cable to FBI

Director:

" It should be noted that the actual tape from

which this transcript [of Oswald's call] was made has been

erased."

Legal Attaché (FBI), Mexico City, Cable to FBI

Headquarters, 25 November 1963:

"Tapes obtained by CIA..

here erased after two weeks, following making of typewritten

transcripts of contents of these tapes.

There appears to be

some confusion in that no tapes were taken to Dallas but

only typewritten transcripts supplied by CIA, the tapes not

being available because they had been erased."

5. FBI Memorandum to U:S. Senate Select Committee, 27

February 1976:

"Delivered herewith is material responsive

to that letter pertaining to a voice recording referred to

on page five of an FBI report to the President of the United

States dated November 23, 1963.

As was discussed... on

February 24, 1976, the recording in question was never in

the possession of

With respect to Coleman's and Slawson's recollections,

the CIA file contains a number of internal Warren Commission

documents on their trip to Mexico City.

their visit, they state that in their meeting with Scott,

they were shown original transcripts and translations of

Oswald's telephone conversations.

In a subsequent meeting

with Scott and his deputy, arrangements were made for them

to go through all the transcripts to use them as a basis for

reconstructing Oswald's Mexico City activities concerning

the two embassies.

Slawson then spent considerable time

reviewing and taking notes from the transcripts. None of

these records mentions the existence of tapes of Oswald's

calls or "listening

to taped conversations."

The CIA/HRG review did turn up tapes of Oswald's radio

debate in New Orleans and of a telephone

conversation on

26 November between Cuban President Dorticos and Cuban

Ambassador to Mexico Hernandez Armas. Scott discussed

the

latter tape with Coleman and Slawson, noting that the

connection between the two speakers was very bad, that the

tape was in CIA Headquarters and, that the Warren Commission

might want to have it re-translated.

2. The Agency, he said, told investigators that the

tapes had been erased. Summers said that he understood

erasure as a normal procedure, with no sinister overtones.

However, when he talked with former Warren Commission

that they heard the tapes while in the Station and noted

3. Considering the 1964 date of the Slawson/Coleman

individuals who said they heard the tapes, Summers asked if

our review had turned up the tapes or any documentation

reflecting anything other than standard erasure procedure

that could explain the apparent conflict between the timing

of the Headquarters instruction to the field after the

assassination not to destroy any file material, the date of

the Slawson/Coleman visit and theabsence of the tapes from

the file.

4. I said that, to my knowledge, no one here had found

the tapes nor had they encountered anything that would

affect the conclusion that the tapes had been routinely

erased. I said that no one reviewer here saw every document

in the many archival boxes, but that had someone found

anything to conflict with the previous testimony, it would

have surfaced.

5. I got the impression that, in addition to continuing

to review the material as it is released to NARA, Summers

may seek a formal response to the question he asked me.

RELEASE IN FULL

6 July 1994

Dear Mr. Periera,

Thanks for your letter of June 25, regarding the Kennedy

assassination case, and the matter of tape recordings. I was

aware of virtually all the points you raise, since I recently

took the trouble to visit Washington to peruse all available

released material on the subject.

It does not, however, resolve the problem. while one might

accept that human memory might fail in the case of one person,

or even of two, it is surely astonishing thät two former Warren

Conmission counsel say firmly for the record that in April

1964 they listened to tapes of Oswald contacts with one or

more of the Conmunist missions, courtesy of the local CIA

station chief, and that - in addition - a former senior station

officer confirms that such tapes were played for thei

precisely as they describe. What should the serious scholar

of the case conclude, that all three of these gentlemen have

hopeless memories or are offering false information? Or could

it be that the written record is wrong? Can we be certain

that the CIA was not holding such tapes in 1964, and has not

destroyed such tapes since? And can we be certain the CIA

no longer has such tapes in its possession? I look forward

with interest to your reply.

Sincerely,

RELEASE IN FULL

24 February 1995

To:

C/HRG 2000

Subject: Morley's request

The 10 October 1963 cable (Dir 74830) is a response to the

Station's 9 October 1963 cable (Mexi 6453) which describes

Oswald's contact with the Consul at the Soviet Embassy.

DRAFT

The information on Oswald in the 10 October cable (para. 1 -

3) deals with Oswald citizenship and current status and is

based on State reporting.

The cable is not a complete

report on Oswald based on all information available.

The comment in Para. 3 re "latest HDQS information" appears

to relate to citizenship issue, i.e., as of May 1962 State

had confirmed Oswald's US citizenship.

The statement is

written in "cablese" and poorly worded, however, I don't

believe it was meant to imply that there was no other

information available on Oswald.

Karamessines signed as "releasing officer" and,J.C. King was as

the" authentication officer!

The cable would have been

drafted by another officer, probably someone responding to a

request on Oswald citizenship status.

Background (FYI Only) :

The "Pre-Assassination" 201 file as released to NARA had at

least one FBI document dated after May 1962 (DBA 20883 dated

30 August 1962/ received in the Agency 19 September 1962) .

There is also a 10 September 1963 FBI document that was

received by the Agency on 19 September 1963. Given the

handling of FBI documents (indexing and microfilming prior

to dissemination), I doubt that this document had reached

the 201 file by 10 October 1963.

There are no May 1962 documents reports in the Pre-

Assassination 201 File.

in the "JFK collection"

, however, no way to determined when

there were received by the Agency.

The May 1962 "State report" may refer to a phone call to

State or documents

that were available but not in the 201

file.

INTERA

ONLY

## Page 11

13-00000

The cable referred to in your letter appears to focus

only on the status of Oswald's citizenship.

As such, it

draws on information available from the State Department

that bears on the question of citizenship.

The cable is not

regarded as an attempt to summarize all the information in

CIA files on Oswald at

the time.

Our question:

Does the Agency know why Mr. Karamessines told the Mexico City sta-

Outlook section

7 November 1997

To: George Tenet, Director of Central Intelligence:

From: Jefferson Morley, Washiagton Post

I write to request a briefing about the status of certain CIA records

related to the Kennedy assassination. These records were produced by an

Agency employee known as "Howard" who served as the case officer for a

anti-Castro organization called the Revolutionary Student Directorate, DRE,

From December 5, 1962 to mid-April 1964. In CIA files, the DRE was

known by the cryptonym AMSPELL.

On November 22, 1963; "Howard" knew or should have known

about the pro-Castro activities of accused assassin Lee Harvey Oswald in

1963. "Howard" was also in à position to evaluate public allegations of a

Castroite assassination conspiracy made by his agents in the leadership of

the DRE with whom he had extensive contact. He was obliged to report on

the activities of these agents. Yet virtually all records related to "Howard's"

activities, in 1962-64 are missing from the National Archives. Inquiries to the

JFK Assassination Records Review Board about these records have been

unavailing.

Under the terms of the JFK Assassination Records Act, the director of

the. Agency's archival depository is required to give "expedited review. for

public disclosure of assassination records" in the Agency's possession.

Because the CLA has otherwise shown (in the words of the JFK

Assassination Records Review Board) "a high level of cooperation" and.

"undertaken significant efforts" to satisfy the standards of the JFK Records

Act, the apparent withholding of records by. and about "Howard" is an

anomaly that sbould be clarified and corrected..

P.4 P.3

Background: On November 13, 1962, Deputy Director of Plans

Richard Helms with two leaders.of the DRE at CIA beadquarters. Helms,

according to minutes of the meeting, expressed a "personal interest" in.

developing a "reasonable collaboration" with the DRE. He assigned the

group a new case officet whom he said would "be responsible to him

(Helms) for the relationship:»' According to otber CIA records, this case

officer used the name "Howard" in connection with DRE activities. As of

April 1963, the DRE was receiving an average of $51,000 per month from

the Agency, the most of suy single Cuban exile organization.

"Howard's" handling of the group casts new light on. an old story: the

Warren Commission's report that in August 1963, anti-Castro Cubans

mounted a series of public confrontations with Lee Harvey Oswald. At the

time, the ex-Marine wrote in a "political resume" that he was trying to

harass and "infiltrate" the DRE chapter in New Orleans. When Oswald

handed out pamphlets for the pro-Castro Fair Play for Cuba Committee on

August 9, 1963, the DRE's New Orleams delegate Carlos Bringuier and other

DRE members got into a fight with him. Bringuier notified the group's

national leaders in Miami about the street altercation with Oswald, With the

approval of DRE leaders in Miami, he then put Oswald nder surveillance.

He and a fellow anti-Castro activist also challenged Oswald to a debate on a

local radio station, The DRE delegation taped the radio program and sent a

copy to DRE headquarters in Miami. Finally, Bringuier, in consultation with

DRE leaders in Miami, also put out a press release denouncing Oswald as a

Marxist.

At the time; "Howard" was meeting regularly with DRE leaders in

Miami and assisting their propaganda activities. One former leader of the

DRE says that he is certain that "Howard" was informed of the group's

contacts with Oswald at the time; another says that "Howard" was

"probably" informed. These statements are in potential conflict with the

Agency's longstanding position that none of its employees were

knowledgeable of Oswald's activities in New Orleans in August 1963..

r.s

In any case, there is no doubt that "Howard" was working with the

DRE in the second balf of 1963 to combat pro-Castro forces in the United

States. la September 1963, "Howard" advanced four DRE leaders S660 to

travel to New York City and disrupt a conference of pro-Castro students, an

apparent violation of the ban on CIA activities on U.S. soil.

While reporting regularly to "Howard" in the fall of 1963, the DRE

leaders were stepping up their efforts to obtain weapons and money for an

imminent military effort to liberate Cuba. In October 1963, DRE leader Juan

Manual Salvat traveled, in violation of an administrative order confining him

to Miami; to Dallas. There, FBI documents show that Salvat assigned two

DRE members to negotiate for the purchase of weapons from a Dallas gun

dealer, John Thomas Masen, According to, a March 1964 FBI canvas of

Dallas area gun dealers; Masen was otie of two who soid the type of

Mannlicher-Carcano bullets that struck President Kennedy.

After President Kennedy was killed, & DRE leader sent "Howard" a

copy of a recording of the August 1963 radio debate with Oswald. The

group published a special issue of "Trinchera," its CLA-funded publication,

detailing. Bringuier's contacts with Oswald and alleging that the accused

assassin had acted at the behest of Fidel Castro. The group also launched a

campaign by its Agency-funded delegations in Latin America to blame

Kennedy's murder on the Cuban goverument.

"Howard's" reaction to the DRE's use of CIA funding to promote its

JFK assassination conspiracy theory is unknown, It is known that "Howard"

did riot immediately inform his CLA colleagues investigating Oswald that his

agents in the DRE had previously exposed the acoused assassin as a

sympathizer with the Cuban revolution. "Oswald's involvement with the

pro-Castro movement was not at all surface[dj to us in the first weeks of the

investigation," said "John Scelso," the CIA official in charge of the

Agency's inquiry into Oswald'

The Agency, in compliance with the JFK Records Act, has already

disclosed most aspects of its relationship with the DRE, including the real

names of two case officers who handled the group. (David Phillips and Ross

Crozier). The Agency has released the redacted 201 file of principal

AMSPELL agent, Juan Manual Salvat Roque (201-286051). It has also

released monthly "Operational Progress" reports on AMSPELL/DRE's

activities in September and October 1962-the months right before

"Howard" became the Agency's contact with the group-and'on

AMSPELL/DRE activities in May, June, July, August, September and

October 1964-the months right after "Howard" was relieved of the DRE

assigument.

The nomaly in the CIA records is this: If "Howard"' reported on, the

group in the same fashion that his predecessor and successor did, he would

have generated 17 monthly operational progress reports on AMSPELL/DRE

activities between December 1962 and April 1964. Yet the National

Archives has no such AMSPELL/DRE reports in that period; Nor have such

reports been made available to the Review Board. Yet it is precisely these

reports that are most likely to contain information relevant to the Kennedy

assassination story. Specifically, "Howard"s" reports on AMSPELL/DRE

activities in August and November 1963, if they exist, demonstrably fit the

legal definition of "assassination related records" and thus have the

presumption of "immediste disclosure" according to statute.

Among the questions I would like to discuss with knowledgeable

representatives of the Agency are:

1) Did "Howard" report appropriately through the JMWAVE station

in Miami about his activities on behalf of the CIA concerning the

DRE in the period 1962 to 1964?

3) Were these records made available to the House Select Committee

on Assassinations in 1977-78 in connection with its review of DRE

activities?

4) Does "Howard's" reporting on DRE activities in August and

November 1963 exist today?

S). If so, when will the Agency make these records available to the

Review Board as mandated by law?

6) If these records no longer exist, what was the date and the reason

for their disposition?

7) Does the CIA. have any objection to the publication of "Howard's"

real game?

• I trust that knowledgeable representatives of the Agency will be able

to clarify these issues for readers of the Washington Post

Re:

Bill Haslon

Director of Public Affairs

Poonal at the 205 0 2s Pacon Document

Jefferson Morley of che Washingeon Post is planning to write

a story for the "Outlook" seccion on che goverment-wide JFK

assassination document reviaw. Morley requested a background

briefing wich members of che CIA/CSI review panel to discuss what

he believes are "anomalies" in our disclosures to date.

Specifically, Morley clains that CIA records relating to the

Agency's relationship wich an anti-Cascro group called the

Revolutionary Student Directorate (DRE) are missing from the

National Archives.

In addition, Morley clains that previously

released JFK documents which reference a CIA case officer named

"Howard," who Morley claims was the Agency's contact with the

DRE, are also missing or incomplete.

After consulcing with John Pereira, Chief, CSI/Historical

Review Group, and Barly Harrelson, Chief, JFK Assassination

Review, PAS informed Morley that it would not be appropriate to

conduct a background briefing on che subject at this time because

the Agency's JFK assassination docunent review is still ongoing.

We emphasized to Morley that the CIA maintains an excellent

working relationship wich the Presidential review board and has

been responsive to all inquires and concerns the board has

raised.

Background: At the request of the Presidential JFK

Assassination Records Review Board, CSI is currently conducting a

thorough re-review of all DRE related document to ascertain if

"Howard" existed and to determine if documents are missing. To

date no records containing the name

"Howard" have been identified

and CSI has not determined if there are any missing DRE

documents.

CSI believas the Agency's relationship with the

Presidential board could be jeopardized, or damaged, if MorleY

were to receive a CIA briefing on the very questions the board

has instructed CSI co investigate.

Attached is a copy of Morley's request for the background

briefing.

To: George Tenes, Director Central Intelligence

From: Jefferson Morley

Shortly after the assassination of President Kennedy on Nov. 22,

1963, a CLA case officer learned that his agents in a Miami-based anti-

Castro organization had been in contact with Lee Harvey Oswald, then in

custody as a suspect in the President's murder.

I would like to request an unclassified briefing on the activities and

professional performance of this officer.

This officer was, according to former colleagues, a senior intelligence

officer. He was the CLA's contact with the Revolutionary Student

Directorate (DRE) from December 1962 until April 1964. He used the name

"Howard" in his dealings with the Cuban students. The DRE is identified in

CIA files by the cryptonym AMSPELL; the principle agent in the

AMSPELL operation was Juan Manual Salvat. The Washington Post has

learned that the AMSPELL propaganda operation, funded by the CIA, had a

decisive effect on media coverage of the Kennedy assassination.

Among the questions, I seek to clarify are:

-Did "Howard" report on the activities of the DRE/AMSPELL in

August and November of 1963?

-Did "Howard" report on contacts between the DRE and Oswald in a

timely fashion after the assassination?

- When will copies of "Howard's" reporting on DRE/AMSPELL be

made available to the JFK Records Review Board?

JFK Project Officer

OFFICE:

IMO/HRP

SUBJECT:

FYI - Jeff Morley's Requests re DRE

REFERENCE:

Morley's letters (2) to DCI

Last week Tom Crispell, Public Affairs, call me about a second letter to the DCI from Jeff Morley, Washington Post, re the

DRE (Revolutionary Student Directorate), an anti-Castro organization that figures in the JFK assassination story. Again Morley ask for

an unclassified briefing on the documents that have been made public, and clarification of the AMSPELL (DRE) operation and its "case

officer" Howard.

I told Tom that HRG continued to recommend against a briefing and/or doing research for Morley. However, we are in the

process of preparing a response to the ARRB on the DRE that will answer some of Morley's questions. Tom and I discussed the

possibility of providing Morley a copy of our response to the JFK Board (ARRB) or referring him to the board. I told Tom I would have to

discuss with C/HRG, the DO and board staff.

The DO (Bill McNair and Fred Wickham) are opposed to giving Morley any information. The ARRB Ex Dir. has no objection to

the Agency providing morley the same intormation we are giving the ARRB, however, they would not provide Morley a copy of our

response. The ARRB considers this an open request and does not want to give incomplete information. If Morley is referred to the

ARRB, he will be told that their records would be open to the public when the project is completed: Gunn did request that we make the

DRE files in the sequestered collection a priority in the re-review and ask if we could re-review those documents mentioned in Morley's

requests as soon as possible.

I passed the DO and ARRB responses to Tom. On Friday (16 Jan) Tom received a short note from Morley asking if the Agency

was going to respond to his request; his deadline for the story is next week and needs to include the Agency's response. After further

discussion, Tom said he would talk with Mansfield and recommend that Morley be given the same response as before: no briefing or

written response to specific questions; additional information on the DRE will be made public through the ARRB and NARA as part of the

review of JFK records.

For your information, the DO can find no record of a case office named "Howard". It appears that "Howard" may have been a

routing indicator.

Jeff Morley Request

1. In response to Jeff Morley's request re "Howard" and the DRE in his recent letter to the DCI, OIM/ HRP proposes the

following oral response:

With reference to your request for information on "Howard", we have attempted to identify who he was and if, in fact, he was

an actual person. The phrase, "To Howard" was used as the addressee of several DRE prepared memoranda. A comprehensive search of

appropriate files was made. The name was not found to be a pseudonym or a registered alias. It also is not the true name of any case

officer associated with the DRE operation at the time the DRE documents were written. Knowledgeable officers have suggested that the

use of "To Howard" might have been a routing indicator to ensure that the documents got to the correct CIA office/officer.

2. The above response has been coordinated with Lee Strickland and the DO|IRO's office (Gloria Boyd). If you have any

Subject. CIA-IR-21 DRE Case Officer for December 1962 - April 1964

In response to ARRB's informal request for additional information and records,

CIA-IR-21, CiA provided access to the Office of Personnel file for Mr. George E.

Joannides: I have examined the personnel file for Mr. Joannides for the period 1961-64

and 1978-79. Mr. Joannides appears in documents in the CIA Sequestered Collection

under his pseudonym Walter D. Nesby.

During the period December 1962 to April 1964, Mr. Joannides was assigned as a covert

action officer at IMWAVE, serving as deputy and then chief of the station's covert

action branch. During this time period, Mr. Joannides was the case officer for the

•Cuban exile group Directorio Revolucionario Estudiantil (DRE). The descriptions of his

duties and accomplishments in the personnel file are very general and' contain no

specific reference to his relationship with the DRE, There is no mention of the

assassination of President John F. Kennedy in the file and no information relevant to the

assassination in the file. There is also no indication that Mr. Joannides may have used

or been known by the name "Howard" during his contacts with the DRE, although

persornel files typically would not reveal this information one way or another.

During the period mid-May 1978-January 1979, Mr. Joannides was assigned to work for

Scott Breckinridge, the CIA's principal coordinator to the House Select Committee on

Assassination (HSCA) as a focal person to keep track of the status of HSCA requests,

particularly to the Directorate of Operations. In this role, Mr. Joannides developed and

maintained a log and records of HSCA requests and CIA responses and-handled the

day-to-day follow up to HSCA requests:

Several performance evaluation reports from the 1962-64 time period and a memoranda

from Scott Breckünridge on Mr. Joannides duties during the 1978-1979 time frame were

designated assassination records and are being processed for release.

MEMORANDUM FOR:

FROM:

SUBJECT:

J. Barry Harrelson

Senior Reviewer, HR/OIM

Material For Response to 11 Dec 98 Ltr From Morley

The following information may be helpful in drafting a response to subject letter from Washington Post

reporter, Jefferson Morely.

2. Basic Facts:

(S) a. On 5 December 1962, Walter D. NEWBY, George Joannides, was introduced to a DRE

leader as the new responsible case officer for the AMSPELL project, replacing Harold R.

NOEMAYR. Dispatch UFGA-6891, 10 Dec 62

(S) b. In "the middle of April" 1964, NEWBY was replaced by Keith T. BONGRINO (P),

as the case officer on project AMSPELL. Dispatch UFGA 16,168, 8 June 64

(U) c. Thus, NEWBY'S responsibility for the DRE/AMSPELL project was for the approximate

period - 5 December 1962 - mid-April 1964.

(U) d. The DRE Monthly Operational Reports that can be found end with the one for November

1962 (the month preceding NEWBY assuming responsibility for the project) and commence

again with one for May 1964 (the month after NEWBY left the project).

(U) e. NEWBY'S fitness reports for the periods in question state that his tasks, among other

things, were:

- Case officer for student project involving political action, propaganda, intelligence

collection and hemisphere-wide apparatus. 1 Jan 62 - 31 Dec 62Fitness Report, dtd

19 Jan 63.

- Case officer for student project involving political action, propaganda, intelligence

collection and a hemisphere-wide apparatus. 1 Jan 63- 31 Jul 63 Fitness Report, dto

31 Jul 63.

- Serves as senior case officer for a student project which involves distribution of

printed propaganda, production of radio programs, and the development of political

action programs. I Apr 63 - 31 March 64 Fitness Report, dtd 15 May 64.

(U) f. In all three Fitness Reports, he received a "Strong" for his efforts on the above described

DRE/AMSPELL Project.

---

## Page 31

13-00000

(S) g. Via WAVE-1064, dtd 7 November 1962 - the month of the last Operational Report before the

gap and just a few weeks before NEWBY took over as the case officer, JMWAVE had

recommended for a number of reasons that the AMSPELL project be terminated.

(S) h. The 10 December 1962 Dispatch UFGA-6891 (the last Operational Report before the gap

commenced) is illustrative of the confusion surrounding the project both from the way the

"Subject" of the dispatch is styled and the comments within the dispatch. For example:

The "subject box has two lines. On line one it states, "Operational /GYROSE/KUWOLF/

AMSPELL." On the second line it states, "AMSPELL Status" which is a clear reference to

the problems and uncertainties with the project which are then set out within the report.

The report first notes the station's November recommendation to terminate AMSPELL but

then advises while it would continue to fund salaries and operational expenses, no new

AMSPELL activities would be undertaken pending HQ's response to the proposal to

terminate.

Further, within the body of the report was the statement that "AMSPELL membership was

being instructed to go out and seek other employment as a part of a plan for a 'transition' in

the event of a rupture in relations with KUBARK." It is not clear if this instruction was

being made by Station officers or by AMSPELL leadership.

4. Morley's Allegations: Turning to subject letter, Morley is more than a little disingenuous when he

claims HRP responded to the ARRB "with inaccurate information: to wit, that no 'actual person'

was handling contacts with the DRE in 1963." He alleges in the next paragraph, "(t)hese

statements are now shown to be false and misleading...." HRP's 20 January 1998 memorandum to

the ARRB plainly does not say what Morley alleges. We know who the case officer was before and

after NEWBY and that NEWBY was the case officer in 1963. The Harrelson memorandum simply

says that because of policy differences between the Agency and the DRE during the period in

question, the Agency reduced its level of funding and also replaced the officer designated to deal

with the DRE. The memorandum does not say the Agency withdrew the officer or suggest the

absence of a case officer responsible for the project.

5.

6.

With respect to Morley's claim that a representative of "CIA's public information office" told

him "no 'actual person' was handling contacts with the DRE in 1963,..." HRP's record of that

proposed conversation reflects a different story. The HRP record states that the Agency Public

Affairs officer would recommend: a) that no briefing or written response to specific questions be

given to Morely; and, b) that he be told additional information on the DRE would be made public

through the ARRB and NARA as part of the review of JFK records..

Further, the Agency did not "fail to accurately disclose the activities of one of its case officers in

1963" to the ARRB as Morely claims. Indeed, Michelle Combs' 3 March 1998 memorandum

clearly demonstrates: a)she had access to Joannides' personnel file; b) she was clearly aware he

was NEWBY; and, c) she knew that he was the case officer for the DRE from December 1962 to

April 1964. She knew these things because the Agency provided her full access to his personnel

file and all other relevant materials. Her statement that "(t)he descriptions of his duties and in the

personnel file are very general and contain no specific refrence to his relationship with the DRE," i.

technically correct. The DRE is not mentioned by name within the file. However, the three quoted

duties or tasks set-out above from the three Fitness Reports adequately demonstrate that the project

for which he was a case officer was the DRE.

7.

Where there ever DRE Operational Reports for the months December 1962 through April 1964.

The answer to that question has not been found so far as HRP knows. All evidence and comment

. .

received from the DO during our search on behalf of the ARRB suggests that the reports never

existed. The coincidences of dates between NEWBY'S arrival and departure strongly suggest the

confusion about the go/no-go status of the DRE with Agency sponsorship precipitated some

decision to suspend the reports. Whether that decision was made by NEWBY or senior JMWAVE

personnel is not known.

8.

We have already answered the question about "Howard." Morely states "there is abundant

evidence in CIA and DRE records that Joannides, using the pseudonym "Howard," ...etc. HRP's

20 January 1998 memorandum advised the Executive Director of the ARRB that we did not know

who "Howard" was or if, in act, there was a person using the name "Howard." Further, according

to the DO, the name was not found to be a pseudonym or the true name of an officer the DRE

operation at the time the DRE documents were written.

THIS

DUL

Mr. Jefferson Morley

Staff Writer

The Washington Post

1150 15* Street, NW.

Washington, D.C. 20071

Dear Mr. Morely:

identity of "Howard."

This is in response to your letter of 3 December concerning the DRE, the DRE case officer and the

It appears that there is some confusion about what the Agency has said and not said about the above

subjects. I hope the following facts will clarify matters for you.

First, the Agency has never said there was no case officer for the DRE during 1963. We know the

identify of the case officer before NEWBY/Joannides; we know the case officer following Joannides; and,

we know that Joannides was the DRE case officer for the period 5 December 1962 to mid April 1964. The

20 January 1998 memorandum to the ARRB simply says that differences between the Agency and the

DRE caused the Agency to replace "the officer designated to deal with the DRE."

Second, the gap in DRE/AMSPELL operational reports for the months December 1962 through April

1963 (the so-called "missing reports") coincides almost exactly with NEWBY'S/Joannides' tenure as the

DRE case officer. We do not know if the reports ever existed. We do know that the differences

mentioned above caused JMWAVE to propose to Headquarters in November 1962 that the project be

terminated. This was the month before NEWBY/Joannides assumed responsibility for the DRE and the

last month an Operational Report was written before the gap. We like you can only speculate about why

no reports exist - whether NEWBY/Joannides decided on his own they were no longer necessary, whether

he was told by a superior to stop them, or whether they were in fact written and cannot be found. We do

not know.

Third, I turn to the identity/existence of "Howard." As you note, "To Howard" was used by the DRE

as the apparent addressee on certain correspondence. We refer to our 20 January 1998 letter. "Howard"

could not be found as a registered pseudonym or alias. We have no evidence to suggest "Howard" was ar

identity for Joannides. Lastly, so far as we can determine, "Howard" is not the true name of any officer

associated with the DRE at the time the DRE documents were written.

The Agency has not made false or misleading statements to the ARRB about these matters. In fact,

ARRB staff members thoroughly reviewed all of the materials on the DRE, NEWBY/Joannides, the

"Howard" issue and, the question of the gap in the DRE operational reports.

Sincerely,

XXXXXXXXX

Mr. L. Britt Snider

General Counsel

Central Intelligence Agency

Washington, DC 20505

Dear Mr. Snider.

By way of introduction, my name is Jefferson Morley. I am a reporter for the

Washington Post. Our mutual friend Scott Armstrong suggested that I write to you for

clarification of certain issues related to CIA compliance with the JFK Assassination

Records Act.

As you know, the mandate of the Act was for "immediate disclosure" of all

documents related to the murder of President Kennedy, The purpose of the law was to

re-establish the credibility of govemment institutions in the face of widespread public

doubt and confusion about the events of November 1963. As you also know, the

number three official at the agency, in compliance with the Act, submitted a swom

statement that the Agency has made available all assassination-related records for

review by the JFK Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB).

The attached exchange of memoranda raises questions about the accuracy.of

the ClA's responses to the ARRB on a potentially important question.

At issue are the reporting and performance of George E. Joannides, a ClA case

officer stationed in Miami in 1963 with responsibilities for a once-prominent Cuban exile

group known as the Revolutionary Student Directorate or DRE. The DRE was an anti-

•Castro group whose members had a series of encounters with Lee Harvey Oswald 12

weeks before the Kennedy assassination. The DRE leaders were the very first people to

issue public statements after the assassination about Oswald's pro-Castro activities and

political convictions. A senior official of the Castro government alleged in 1995 that the

DRE was involved in a conspiracy to kill President Kennedy.

The exchange of memoranda demonstrates that when the ARRB inquired last

winter about the identity of the CIA contact for the DRE, the Historical Review office

responded with inaccurate information: to wit, that no "actual person" was handling

contacts with the DRE in 1963. When I posed the same question on behalf of the

Washington Post to Tom Crispell of the ClA's public Information office, I was also told

• DID WE

that the CIA had no records as to the identity of the DRE's case officer.

intent. As Ms. Combs' memo demonstrates, the DRE did have a case officer and that

the fact was recorded in Mr. Joannides Office of Personnel file. Both the DRE and Mr.

Joannides were well known at JM/WAVE. The DRE, known by the cryptonym

AM/SPELL, was receiving $51,000 a month from the agency and Mr. Joannides was

reporting to Ted Shackley among others.

The agency's inaccurate statement about Mr. Joannides logically raises

questions about the agency's statement that it cannot locate any written reports

generated by him. Obviously "knowledgeable officers" who did not know of Mr.

Joannides' relationship with the DRE would not be well positioned to know of his

evidence in CIA and DRE records that Joannides, using the pseudonym "Howard,"

received written communications from and about the DRE, the most reasonable

assumption (absent further explanation) is that he memorialized his activities in 1962-

1964.

If the CIA can find no such records in its files, the question of the disposition of

these records arises. If DRE-AM/SPELL tiles were destroyed according to procedure.

there should be a record of it. If they were not destroyed according to procedure, their _

disposition needs to be accounted for under the spirit, if not the letter, of the JFK

Records Act,

i plus.

My questions are as follows:

1) Why did the ClA make inaccurate statements last January to the ARRB and - We (HAP)

the Washington Post about the DRE's case officer? What are the names of the

did not

"knowledgeable officers" who informed J. Barry Harrelson that the man known to the a

DRE as "Howard" (i.e. George Joannides) was not an "actual person" but merely "a

routing indicator?"

2) What is the ClA's explanation for the complete absence of reporting on the

We (HRA)

DRE and Oswald from He estant les on the ASPELL operation? Ater the DRE made hear

public statements about Lee Harvey Oswald on November 22, 1963, What were Mr.

Joannides reporting obligations, if any, under the procedures and practices of the

Operations Directorate? Did Mr. Joannides, in the view of the Agency today, fulfili those

obligations in all respects?

3) Will the ClA provide a background briefing to me and a colleague to clarity

these and other questions arising from the documentation of the ClA's relationship with

the DRE in 1962-64 and from Mr. Joannides' role in the Agency's response to the HSCA

investigation in 1978-79?

The apparent fallure of the ClA to accurately disclose the activities of one of its

case officers in November 1963 to the JFK records review board is noteworthy. Public

confidence in the ClA's sworn statements about its compliance with the JFK Records

Act depends on verification of those statements. If the Historical Review Office was

misinformed about Mr. Joannides and passed that inaccurate information to the public, it

behooves the agency to correct the error quickly and clarify all questions arising from its

original misstatements of fact.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

FROM:

SUBJECT:

J. Barry Harrelson

Senior Reviewer, HRP/OIM

Material For Response to 11 Dec 98 Lt From Morley

The following background information addresses the questions and accusations made by Washington

Post reporter, Jefferson Morley in his letter to of 11 December 1998 to Britt Snider. It has been

coordinated with the DO JFK Team and DO/IRO (Gloria Boyd).

2. Basic Facts:

a. On 5 December 1962, Walter D. NEWBY, George Joannides, was introduced to a DRE leader

as the new responsible case officer for the AMSPELL project, replacing Harold R.

NOEMAYR. Dispatch UFGA-6891, 10 Dec 62

b. In "the middle of April" 1964, NEWBY was replaced by Keith T. BONGRINO (P),

as the case officer on project AMSPELL. Dispatch UFGA 16,168, 8 June 64.

c. Thus, NEWBY'S responsibility for the DRE/AMSPELL project was for the approximate period

- 5 December 1962 - mid-April 1964.

d. The DRE Monthly Operational Reports that can be found end with the one for November 1962

(the month preceding NEWBY assuming responsibility for the project) and commence again

with one for May 1964 (the month after NEWBY left the project).

e. NEWBY'S fitness reports for the periods in question state that his tasks, among other things,

were:

- Case officer for student project involving political action, propaganda, intelligence

collection and hemisphere-wide apparatus. 1 Jan 62 - 31 Dec 62Fitness Report, dtd

19 Jan 63.

- Case officer for student project involving political action, propaganda, intelligence

collection and a hemisphere-wide apparatus. 1 Jan 63- 31 Jul 63 Fitness Report, did

31 Jul 63.

- Serves as senior case officer for a student project which involves distribution of

arion propaganda, production racio progress pot, de vel Maent of political

f. In all three Fitness Reports, he received a "Strong" for his efforts on the above described

DRE/AMSPELL Project.

g. Via WAVE-1064, did 7 November 1962 - the month of the last Operational Report before the gap

and just a few weeks before NEWBY took over as the case officer, JMWAVE had recommended for a

number of reasons that the AMSPELL project be terminated.

h. The 10 December 1962 Dispatch UFGA-6891 (the last Operational Report before the gap

commenced) is illustrative of the confusion surrounding the project both from the way the

"Subject" of the dispatch is styled and the comments within the dispatch. For example:

The "subject box has two lines. On line one it states, "Operational /GYROSE/KUWOLF/

AMSPELL." On the second line it states, "AMSPELL Status" which is a clear reference to

the problems and uncertainties with the project which are then set out within the report.

The report first notes the station's November recommeidation to terminate AMSPELL but

then advises while it would continue to fund salaries and operational expenses, no new

AMSPELL activities would be undertaken pending HQ's response to the proposal ic

terminate.

Further, within the body of the report was the statement that "AMSPELL membership was

being instructed to go out and seek other employment as a part of a plan for a 'transition' in

the event of a rupture in relations with KUBARK." It is not clear if this instruction was

being made by Station officers or by AMSPELL leadership.

4. Morley's Allegations: Turning to subject letter, Morley is more than a little disingenuous when he

claims HRP responded to the ARRB "with inaccurate information: to wit, that no 'actual person'

was handling contacts with the DRE in 1963." He alleges in the next paragraph, "(t)hese

statements are now shown to be false and misleading...." HRP's 20 January 1998 memorandum to

the ARRB plainly does not say what Morley alleges. We know who the case officer was before and

after NEWBY and that NEWBY was the case officer in 1963. The Harrelson memorandum simply

says that because of policy differences between the Agency and the DRE during the period in

question, the Agency reduced its level of funding and also replaced the officer designated to deal

with the DRE. The memorandum does not say the Agency withdrew the officer or suggest the

absence of a case officer responsible for the project.

5.

6.

With respect to Morley's claim that a representative of "CIA's public information office" told

him "no 'actual person' was handling contacts with the DRE in 1963,..." HRP's record of that

proposed conversation reflects a different story. The HRP record states that the Agency Public

Affairs officer would recommend: a) that no briefing or written response to specific questions be

given to Morley; and, b) that he be told additional information on the DRE would be made public

through the ARRB and NARA as part of the review of JFK records..

1963" to the ARRB as Morley claims. Indeed, Michelle Combs' 3 March 1998 memorandurr

learly demonstrates: a)she had access to Joannides' personnel file; b) she was clearly aware he

7.

for which he was a case officer was the DRE.

Were there ever DRE Operational Reports for the months December 1962 through April 1964.

The answer to that question has not been found so far as HRP knows. All evidence and comment

received from the DO during our search on behalf of the ARRB suggests that the reports never

existed. The coincidences of dates between NEWBY'S arrival and departure strongly suggest the

confusion about the go/no-go status of the DRE with Agency sponsorship precipitated some

decision to suspend the reports. Whether that decision was made by NEWBY or senior JMWAVE

personnel is not known.

We have already answered the question about "Howard." Morley states "there is abundant

evidence in CIA and DRE records that Joannides, using the pseudonym "Howard,"...etc. HRP's

20 January 1998 memorandum advised the Executive Director of the ARRB that we did not know

ho "Howard" was or if, in fact, there was a person using the name "Howard." Further, accordin

o the DO, the name was not found to be a pseudonym or the true name of an officer the DRI

operation at the time the DRE documents were written.

RELEASE AWA WINE IN FILL

Dear Mr. Morley:

2000

This responds to your letter of 3 December 1998 to

Mr. Britt Snider concerning certain records released under

the JFK Assassination Records Act and our representations to

the JFK Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB).

I

believe that a careful review of the actual documents you

cite fi.e.. our 20 January 1998 letter to the ARRB and the

3 March 1998 internal ARRB memorandum) will answer your

concerns. Accordingly, we have addressed your three

principal questions below in this context.

First, you assert that in an exchange with the ARRB

(presumably the 20 January 1998 letter),

"... the Historical

Review office responded with inaccurate information: to wit,

that no 'actual person' was handling contacts with the DRE

in 1963 ..." I believe it is abundantly clear that the

20 January 1998 letter says just the opposite.

For example,

paragraph 3 states that "... [the Agency]... replaced the

officer designated to deal with the DRE. Then, about the

same time, the monthly operational reports trailed off ..."

Moreover, and far from contradicting our 20 January 1998

letter, the 3 March 1998 ARRB memorandum actually confirms

the veracity of the earlier Agency statement.

Second, you assert that "The Agency"s inaccurate

statement about Mr. Joannides logically raises questions

about the agency's statement that it cannot locate any

written reports generated by him." Here, neither the

precondition for

the statement, nor the statement itself, is

accurate. Again, our 20 January letter provides the most

logical explanation for the absence of any written reports

on Mi. Joannides (i.e., AM/SPELL) and that is (a) the Agency

reduced funding for the DRE during this period and (b)

monthly reporting on the project "simply stopped" because of

this reduced involvement.

---

## Page 42

13-00000

And third, you raise the issue of the identity of

existence of "Howard."

As you note, "To Howard," was used

as an apparent addressee on certain

correspondence.

However, as specifically addressed in the 20 January 1998

memorandum, the name "Howard" could not be found in our

listings of registered pseudonyms or aliases and there is no

other evidence to suggest that "Howard" was an identity for

Joannides.

Moreover, so far as we can determine, "Howard"

is not the true name of any officer associated with the DRE

at the time the DRE documents were written. In no way did

J. Barry Harrelson that the man known to DRE as 'Howard'

George Joannides) was not an 'actual person' but

merely 'a routing indicator.'"

In sum, the one fact that

remains today is that we have insufficient evidence as to

who or what the word "Howard" represented and that is

exactly what the 20 January letter says.

In sum, a careful review of the correspondence cited in

your letter does not support an allegation that the Agency

has made "false or misleading statements to the ARRB about

these matters."

In fact, the records on these issues

establish quite clearly that the Agency was candid and

truthful, that the ARRB staff members had access to and

thoroughly reviewed all relevant information on the issues

you raised, and that the ARRB was satisfied with their

detailed review.

I trust that this information satisfies your concerns.

Sincerely,

James Rider

10/26/99 05:09:50 PM

SUBJECT: . ALERT: Call from Moriey, Washington Post

Tom, This is to confirm our telephone conversation of this afternoon.

We have been advised that Jefferson Morley, a staff writer for the Washington Post, phoned Michelle

Combs (an industrial contractor for OlM's 25 Year Declassification program) this morning, to discuss a

Memo for the Record that Ms. Combs had written when she was a staff officer with the JFK Assassination

Records Review Board.

Mr. Morley told Ms. Combs that he was writing an article for the Post (and

possibly for The New Yorker) that involved George Joannides, who was a case officer with JM/WAVE

assigned to work with a Cuban exile group, Revolutionary Student Directorate (DRE) in the 1961-64 time

frame. Ms. Combs responded that she no longer worked for the Board and was currently employed in

private industry. (We do not know if Mr. Morley knows that her contractor is working for the Agency's 25

year program). Mr. Morley offered to send her a draft of the article for her review. She said she would

get back to him after Wednesday afternoon to respond to his proposal and she then reported the phone

call to us.

We have indicated to her that she should gracefully decline the offer to critique the article.

She agreed to this.

You will recall that Mr. Morley wrote to Britt Snider last December asking several questions about Mr.

Joannides and the DRE and asserting that CIA was less than responsive to the Board's requests for

information. He cited two memoranda that had been released by the Board:

• a 20 January 1998 memo from Barry Harrelson to the Board explaining: (a) why there were no DRE

monthly operational reports in the Agency's files and (b) the unexplained references to an addressee,

•

a 3 March 1998 MFR from Ms Combs referencing information on Joannides. Mr. Morley alleged

"inaccurate statements" by CIA to the ARRB and the Post and asked for a briefing on "the CIA's

relationship with the DRE."

Our response, which was coordinated with O/Public Affairs, was provided to Mr. Morley on 18 February

1999 and addressed each of the major "inaccuracies" he alleged (basicly, he had misread the documents).

We did not offer a briefing.

As of this time we do not know what the theme of Mr. Morley's article(s) will be.

While I have no objection to taking portions

to at least geterom this briefing three

attributable statements in responge to these

questions.

•Fabian Escalante, a retired Cuban

intelligence official, has said that

members of the Revolutionary Student

Directorate (DRE) were involved in a

conspiracy to kill President Kennedy. At

the time of Kennedy's death, this group

Will the Agency immediately account for

all records kept by Joannides during his

work with the HSCA in 1978?

• Nora Slatkin, executive director of the

Morley requests

A few points re Morley's questions - ok to share with Tom Crispell with caveat that I would like to

do some follow-up research before we prepare an official written response:

1. Fabian Excalante - I assume we would not comment on Escalante's statement as a matter of policy.

As for the DRE, the documents including DO files are available at NARA; most documents released in full

[Frank or Horace can give you specific re type files and number of document - - remember JFK is full of

duplicates documents, so number of hits will be greater than unique documents]. CIA funding is

acknowledged; no records on a "conspiracy to kill Kennedy" were located.

2. George Joannides -

a. all documents pertaining to Joannides and the DRE that were located in the JFK sequestered collection

and in our special searches were released; at the request of the ARRB four of Joannides' performance

appraisals covering 1962-64 were also released.

b. Joannides served as an assistant to Scott Breckinridge, the Agency's Principal Coordinator for the

HSCA investigation in 1978. A Memorandum on Joannides performance in that role was released at the

request of the ARRB. I am not aware of any records "kept by Joannides". It is unlikely, given his position,

that he would have kept a separate set of records. The ARRB staff had full access to the HSCA and

Breckinridge material that we located; no additional "Joannides" documents were identified.

[Note: Michelle Combs, formerly with the ARRB now a Raytheon contractor with the 25 year program, is

the expect on Joannides. Morley has contacted her in the past but may not be aware that we now works

on Agency projects]

all other documents determined by the ARRB to be assassination-related records were released.

Subject:

CIA-IR-21 DRE Case Officer for December 1962 - April 1964

In response to ARRB's informal request for additional information and records,

CIA-IR-21, CIA provided access to the Office of Personnel file for Mr. George E.

Joannides. I have examined the personnel file for Mr. Joannides for the period 1961-64

and 1978-79. Mr. Joannides appears in documents in the CLA Sequestered Collection

under his pseudonym Walter D. Newby.

During the period December 1952 to April 1964, Mr. Joannides was assigned as a covert

action officer at JMWAVE, serving as deputy and then chief of the station's covert

action branch. During this time period; Mr. Joannides was the case officer for the

.. Cuban exile group Directorio Revolucionario Estudiantil (DRE). The descriptions of his

duties and accomplishments in the personnel file are very general and'contain no ..

specific reference to his relationship with the DRE. There is no mention of the

assassination of President John F. Kennedy in the file and no information relevant to the

assassination in the file. There is also no indication that Mr. Joannides may have used

or been known by the name "Howard" during his contacts with the DRE, although

personnel files typically would not reveal this information one way or another.

During the period mid-May 1978-January 1979, Mr. Joannides was assigned to work for

Scott Breckinridge, the CIA's principal coordinator to the House Select Committee on

Assassination (HSCA) as a focal person do keep track of the status of HSCA requests,

particularly to the Directorate of Operations. In this role, Mr. Joannides developed and

maintained a log and records of HISCA requests and CIA responses and handled the

day-to-day follow up to HSCA requests.

Several performance evaluation reports from the 1962-64 time period and a memoranda

from Scott Breckinridge on Mr. Joannides' duties during the 1978-1979 time frame were

designated assassination records and are being processed for release.

INSPECTOR GENERAL

1998-1531

3 December 1998

Mr. L. Britt Snider

General Counsel

Central Intelligence Agency

Washington, DC 20505

Dear Mr. Snider.

By way of introduction, my name is Jefferson Morley. I am a reporter for the

Washington Post. Our mutual friend Scott Armstrong suggested that I write to you for

clarification of certain issues related to ClA compliance with the JFK Assassination

Records Act.

As you know, the mandate of the Act was for "immediate disclosure" of all

documents related to the murder of President Kennedy, The purpose of the law was to

re-establish the credibility of goverment institutions in the face of widespread public

doubt and confusion about the events of November 1963. As you also know, the

number three official at the agency, in compliance with the Act, submitted a swom

statement that the Agency has made avallable all assassination-related records for

review by the JFK Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB).

The attached exchange of memoranda raises questions about the accuracy. of

the ClA's responses to the ARRB on a potentially important question.

At issue are the reporting and performance of George E. Joannides, a ClA case

officer stationed in Miaml In 1963 with responsibilities for a once-prominent Cuban exile

group known as the Revolutionary Student Directorate or DRE. The DRE was an anti-

Castro group whose members had a series of encounters with Lee Harvey Oswald 12

weeks before the Kennedy assassination. The DRE leaders were the very first people to

issue public statements after the assassination about Oswald's pro-Castro activities and

political convictions. A senlor official of the Castro govemment alleged in 1995 that the

DRE was involved in a conspiracy to kill President Kennedy.

The exchange of memoranda demonstrates that when the ARRB inquired last

winter about the identity of the CIA contact for the DRE, the Historical Review office

responded with inaccurate information: to wit, that no "actual person" was handling

contacts with the DRE in 1963. When I posed the same question on behalf of the

Washington Post to Tom Crispell of the ClA's public information office, I was also told

that the ClA had no records as to the identity of the DRE's case officer.

These statements are now shown to be false and misleading, in effect, if not

intent. As Ms. Combs' memo demonstrates, the DRE did have a case officer and that

the fact was recorded in Mr. Joannides' Office of Personnel file. Both the DRE and Mr.

Joannides were well known at JM/WAVE. The DRE, known by the cryptonym

AM/SPELL, was receiving $51,000 a month from the agency and Mr. Joannides was

reporting to Ted Shackley among others.

The agency's inaccurate statement about Mr. Joannides logically raises

questions about the agency's statement that it cannot locate any written reports

generated by him. Obviously "knowledgeable officers" who did not know of Mr.

Joannides' relationship with the DRE would not be well positioned to know of his

reporting on that relationship. Former colleagues tell me that Mir. Joannides'

professional duties on the AM/SPELL account would have included preparing contact

reports on his meetings with DRE leaders and filing monthly reports to his superiors.

Since Joannides had a reputation as a competent officer and since there is abundant

evidence in CIA and DRE records that Joannides, using the pseudonym "Howard,"

received written communications from and about the DRE, the most reasonable

assumption (absent further explanation) is that he memorialized his activities in 1962-

1964.

If the ClA can find no such records in its files, the question of the disposition of

these records arises. If DRE-AM/SPELL files were destroyed according to procedure.

there should be a record of it. If they were not destroyed according to procedure, their

disposition needs to be accounted for under the spirit, if nof the leffer, of the JFK

Records Act.

My questions are as follows:

1) Why did the ClA make inaccurate statements last January to the ARRB and

the Washington Post about the DRE's case officer? What are the names of the

"knowledgeable officers" who informed J. Barry Harrelson that the man known to the

DRE as "Howard" (i.e. George Joannides) was not an "actual person" but merely *a

routing indicator?"

2) What is the ClA's explanation for the complete absence of reporting on the

DRE and Oswald from its extant files on the AM/SPELL operation? After the DRE made

public statements about Lee Harvey Oswald on November 22, 1963, what were Mr.

Joannides reporting obligations, if any, under the procedures and practices of the

Operations Directorate? Did Mir. Joannides, in the view of the Agency today, fulfill those

obligations in all respects?

3) Will the CIA provide a background briefing to me and a colleague to clarity

these and other questions arising from the documentation of the ClA's relationship with

the DRE in 1962-64 and from Mr. Joannides' role in the Agency's response to the HSCA

investigation in 1978-797

=•"=

The apparent fallure of the ClA to accurately disclose the activities of one of its

case officers in November 1963 to the JFK records review board is noteworthy. Public

confidence in the ClA's swor statements about its compliance with the JFK Records

Act depends on verification of those statements. If the Historical Review Office was

misinformed about Mir. Joannides and passed that inaccurate information to the public, it

behooves the agency to correct the error quickly and clarify all questions arising from its

original misstatements of fact.

I hank you for your attention to this matter.
