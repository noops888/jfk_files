MEMORANDUM FOR : Deputy Director of Central Intelligence
FROM ~ : S.D. Breckinridge
SUBJECT : HSCA Request for Sensitive CIA file

1. Action Requested: That you approve the recommenda-
tion in paragraph ¢ to withhold files on Teresa Proenza
Proenza with a generalized explanation to the HSCA Chief
Counsel of the reasons therefor.

2. Background: The HSCA investigators have come
across references to the name of Teresa Proenza Proenza,
who served in 1963 as the Cultural Attache at the Cuban
Embassy in Mexico City, and have requested her file.

The files concerning this person lead to a very sensitive
deception operation that resulted in the jailing of
certain Cuban officials, including Miss Proenza. The
ramifications of the operation are extensive but do not,

of themselves, relate to the assassination of J.F. Kennedy.

3. The fact that Miss Proenza was ordered back to
Cuba. suddenly in December 1963, shortly after the assassina-
tion.of President Kennedy, may make her of special interest
to the HSCA; however, the cause for the recall was the CIA
operation.

4. -HSCA has not been exposed to the techniques of
deception operations. This particular operation continues
to have considerable sensitivity, without reference to the
techniques that we would wish to not have exposed to this
Committee. Attached at Tab A is a paper summarizing the
nature of the operation. At Tab B is a shorter summary
prepared as a first attempt to get an agreement with the
HSCA investigators to not inquire into this matter further.

5. The Deputy Director for Operations has approved
recommendations of Chief, IAD/CAS, concurred in by Chief

of LA Division, that this matter not be shown ‘Spee Du E*By



13-00000

If you agree, the undersigned will undertake to discuss the
matter with the Chief Counsel of the Committee and seek
agreement, although he may raise the question to the level
of the Committee. chairman.

6. Recommendation: That the Chief Counsel, HSCA, be
briefed in general detail only on the nature of the opera-

tion involved in this matter with the request that the
matter not be pursued further by the Committee.

MEMORANDUM

SUBJECT : Political Action Operations in Cuba - The PROENZA
Case

1. Introduction

This memorandum sets forth information concerning the
conduct of a series of interlocking non-violent political action
operations against the Cuban government, its internal coalition
and its alliance with the Soviet Union mounted in 1963.

2. . Objectives

Pursuant to instructions from the 303 Committee,
during the Kennedy Administration, the CIA established among its
objectives against Cuha the fragmenting of its governing
coalition and exacerbation of its relations with the USSR.
This decision was taken prior to the October 1962 Missile Crisis.
As a result of the decision a number of non-violent operations
were carried out. Those pertaining to the Teresa Proenza Proenza
case are set out below.

3. The Operations
a. On 3 April 1963 a set of spurious documents falsely

ibed to a disaffected CIA agent in Mexico were passed

hrough a A controlled assef to the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City.
he doc S made-r ar. that the Cuban Vice Minister of
Defense, a highly placed and extreme Moscow-line Communist (who
had been in Moscow when the missile build-up, was planned in
early 1962), was actually a CIA agent who had betrayed the build-
up. The purpose of this. disinformation was to cause a great
strain in the relations. between the Cuban Communist Party (then
known as the PSP) and the other partners in the coalition. It
was also hoped that the operation would redound against the USSR
because the Vice Minister of Defense was a senior Moscow-line
member of the PSP. It was calculated that the USSR would

move to defend the Vice Minister, who was probably their chief
agent in the Cuban government, and that a collision between the
Soviets and Cubans could result. The Cubans accepted the
spurious papers and paid for them per our demand.

b. Through the summer of 1963 several further deliveries
of spurious documents were made to the Cubans and several
thousand dollars were received in payment. But results of the
operation from inside Cuba were not yet observed. Therefore
on 13 November 1963, when.a delivery of documents was again

OIG?



13-00000

being made, several were included revealing the presence of another
"CIA agent" in the Cuban government, this time inside the Cuban
Embassy in Mexico. This target was Teresa Proenza Proenza, :
long-time Cuban Communist and contact of the Soviet intelligence

in Mexico, who was acting as Cuban Cultural Attache. She also

was a close contact of the Vice Minister of Defense. On

10 December 1963 Miss Proenza was informed of her sudden | transfer
back to Cuba; she actually departed on 23 January 1964. Her

recall was believed to be a result of the spurious documents and

of her known long-time friendship with the Vice Minister of Defense.

c. The first reaction to the operation inside Cuba
occurred in the week of 14 March 1964. At that time a junior
member of the Communist Party (PSP)swas tried and convicted
of betraying non-Communist leaders of the resistance to the former
government of Cuba which had been overthrown by Fidel Castro.

As the trial wore on it became apparent that since the young
Communist had been the protege of the Vice Minister of Defense
the trial was really a trial of the latter.

d. During 1964 deliveries of documents to the Cubans Sse
were continued and payments received. On 18 November 1964
the Vice Minister of Defense was arrested on charges of treason
and removed from his post, as was his wife who also held cabinet
rank. They were jailed as was Teresa Proenza.

e. After terms in prison all three defendants were
released to house arrest. Proenza was later permitted to work as
a librarian in Havana. The Vice Minister died peacefully in his
bed. several years later. His widow was allowed to leave Cuba
to reside in Spain. This phase of the CIA operation wound
down in March 1966 when the Cubans ceased taking an interest in
it.

4. Concluding Remarks (

The foregoing is but the barest outline of a highly
complex operational system that made use of a wide variety of
techniques and assets which have not been revealed to the public.
The story would make dramatic headlines if it became publicly
known, especially in the present environment. The fact that
several persons were deprived of their freedom as a result of the
operation would attract further attention. Furthermore, this
operation laid the basis for other operations of a similar
nature that were successfully mounted against Cuban and other
hostile targets. In short, this file is a Pandora's box the
opening of which would not only expose the cryptonyms of other
operations of, this type but would attract unfavorable publicity
for the Agency in certain quarters and would expose hitherto
secret techniques and assets. This would make their employment
in the future very difficult. The fact that this series of

SEGRET


13-00000

operations did not begin to register on the Cubans until after
the death of President Kennedy should remove any suspicion that
it could in any way have caused Castro to direct an assassination
attempt against the President.

VIA : Chief, LA/STB

FROM : Charles W. Anderson
Chief, CAS/PAG/COB-

SUBJECT : Maria Teresa P r 0 e n z a Proenza

1. Maria Teresa P r 0 e n z a Proenza, born
11 March 1908 in Havana, Cuba, is a Cuban citizen who
resided in Mexico for a number of years before the coming
te power of Fidel C a s t r o in January 1959. Miss Proenza, >
a member of the Cuban Communist Party in Mexico was an

ftists in intellectual and artistic circles. For °
ample, in 1957 she was the housekeeper of famed Mexican
aunist artist Diego Rivera. She was also well

uainted at the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City.

DOO

2. When the incoming Castro regime took command of
the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City, Miss Proenza was
jocally hired to work there in propaganda affairs.
Eventually-she was given the. title Third Secretary/
Cultural Attache. She maintained her leftist Communist
and Soviet contacts and played an important propaganda
role for the Cuban Government because of them.

3. On 13 November 1963 this Agency initiated an
operation to counter Miss Proenza's effective exploitation.
of her contacts in Mexico, a work which frequently had
strong anti-U.S. overtones. Miss Proenza returned to

Cuba in January 1964.

i 4. At no time has this Agency maintained contact
with Miss Proenza.
