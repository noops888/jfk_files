At_the present time it is believed that. the informant
coverage of POPE is adequate, and it is believed if POPE becomes
active in Dallas are§ such activity will become known to one
ve or more of the above informants.

Dallas Office is placing this matter in pending
inactive status for a period of 90 days. Any investigation
conducted at the present time would be a fugitive-type investi-
gation, and a duplication of efforts presently being conducted
by local Dallas law enforcement agencies, It is also believed
by the Dallas Office, that through contacts with the above
informants, Sheriff BILL DECKER, Dallas Sheriff's Office, and
Lt. JACK REVILL, Criminal Intelligence Section, Dallas PD, and
through the investigation of MARION ROBERT RAIF, aka., Dallas
top local hoodlum and associate of POPE, any pertinent infor-
mation concerning POPE will become known, or ascertained.

DL 92-34

On March 10, 1959, JARRELL LEE CARTER was inter-
viewed by Bureau Agents, at which time he was asked about
POPE's whereabouts. He stated he did not know, but if he did,
he would not tell any law enforcement agency. He left the
impression that POPE. was alive and doing everything possible
to avoid apprehension.

On March 7, 1959, Mrs. RUBY JELSEN, 4515 Swiss Avenue,
Apartment 9, mother of PEGGY FRY, advised her daughter had left
her about two months previously with POPE, and she had not had
any contact with either since. She claimed she had absolutely
no information concerning their present whereabouts.

On March 4, 1959, Mrs. C. W. DICKERSON, landlady at
4515 Swiss Avenue, advised she had never seen POPE at the
apartment rented by RUBY JELSEN and her daughter, PEGGY FRY,
in November, 1958. Mrs. DICKERSON stated she would contact
the FBI if POPE or FRY appeared at the apartment house. She
stated she had not seen PEGGY FRY since early January, 1959.

On March 22, 1959, DL T-1 advised that on March 21,
1959, ex-convict SONNY LEFORS, had contacted DL T-1, attempting
to locate POPE, as LEFORS wanted POPE to join him on a proposed
purglary. DL T-1 stated he has no word from POPE since early
February, 1959. DL T-1 also advised on April 16, 1959, that
POPE's $3,000 bond in Dallas District Court, had been defaulted,
since his failure to appear following the fuling of the state
court of appeals.
