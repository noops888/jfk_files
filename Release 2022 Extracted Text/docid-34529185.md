“REPORT OF FINDINGS

(BIRTH) On 20 September 1968, a check of the birth records concerning
Manuel MARTI was conducted at the Bureau of Demographic Registry, Department of
Health, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Santurce, Puerto Rico. Mrs. Candita Hernandez
de Buxo, Records Supervisor, furnished Certificate 36046, Book 73, for the year
1946, which revealed the following pertinent information:

Name: Manuel Adrian MARTI-BADILLO

Date of Birth: 17 May 1946

Place of Birth: San Juan, Puerto Rico

Father's Name: Manuel Marti

Father's Place of Birth: Utuado, Puerto Rico

Mother's Name: Reyes Badillo

Mother's Place of Birth: Aguadilla, Puerto Rico

Registered By: Manuel Marti

Date Registered: 27 May 1946

Remarks: SUBJECT was born, and was originally
registered, as Manuel Adrian SOTOMAYOR-
BADILLO. HIS father was originally
recorded as Adrian Sotomayor. How-
ever, on 5 March 1963, SUBJECT'S
father changed his name to Manuel
Marti under correction number 249,
and changed his SON'S surname on the
same date.

AGENT'S NOTES: According to Spanish tradition, a person's surname is
sometimes compounded by using the father's surname followed by the mother's
maiden name in hyphenated form. However, many persons now omit the mother's name
in common usage.

Attention is invited to Agent Report, Birth-Father, dated 2h september
1968, reflecting the results of an examination of the Court Order, which effected
correction number 249, dated 5 March 1963 (EXHIBIT -_). =
