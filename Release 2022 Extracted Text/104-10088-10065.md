On the morning of l December 1963, PARMUTH assisted RESCIGNO

in installing audio microphones under the flooring of an LCHARVEST occupied

apartment.

(See HMMA-22608, 1l Dec 63, para 5.d.) Lines leading from the

audio installation to the LP were strung and secured below the flooring which hạd

ample semi-crawling space between the target area and the LP apartment.

RESCIGNO and PARMUTH entered this crawling space by removing a small

section of flooring located inside the LP apartment. There is also a trap door

leading into the crawl space at the front entrance hall of the building although

the curious would be discouraged to enter this area because of stagnant water

six to ten inches deep on the floors at all times, cob webs, bugs, etc., etc...

• Three audio microphones were installed on this operation.

basehouse keeper had a key which worked well for several days previously, the

lock would not open for the agent on the afternoon of 6 December.. PARMUTH

entered the apartment at 0130 hours on 7 December and unlocked the door. It

was found that the throw bolt located inside the lock was broken. For security

purposes, two other locks were removed from other doors located in the same

room to check if these locks were in the same bad condition. In each case,

when the key was inserted into the lock and turned excessively, the throw bolt

snappec. A new lock of the same type manufacture was installed on the closet

door by the basehouse keeper on 7 December 1963.
