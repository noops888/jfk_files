Guorw appresiated the KGB document forwarded with
Reference and have submitted the following comments and
questions: .

1. "We have a number of questions about this document
on which we should be grateful for your comments, and as
bvackground to some of thee we think.it will be useful for

you tohave. an account of (QYNNE-EL}IS) dealings with AELADLE:
eae ol

a. “They date from June 1961 when he was con-
sidering a visit to the U.S.3.R. He mentioned this to the
Soviet Ambassador, whom he met at. the Quee Brthday
Celebration in Helsinki, (he did not realise at first that
it was the Ambassador co whom he was talking). The Ambassador

<"puggested that he should get in touch with Ivan Efimovich
BEROEEV, an identified R.I.S. officer,

ai uv
bd. "Between 5th and 15th July 1961 (onne-zu19)
went to the Consular Section of the Soviet Embassy to seo
about the viea. Apparently he.did not eee SERCFEV but met
AELADLE who showed a good deal of curiosity about him and
asked whether he had ever been to the U.S.3,R. before,
whether he had applied in London for a visa, what he was
doing in Helsinki ste, The possibility of ABLADLE taking
English lessons from WYNNE-ELLIS)was mentigned and AELADLE
paid he would get in°touch wit, IYYNNE=E! Sigpout this. He
asked for a short biogfphy of IE-ELLIS)

co. “He brought the visa application forms and his
biography to AELADLE two daye later and although AELADLE was,
apparently very busy he aeked WYNNE-ELLIS) for olarification

of various details. AELADLE did not; take Saglish lesaona
from (WYNNE-ELLIS Jol, °6 :

a. giat the end of September, or beginning of
Octobes 1961, ivwNE-ELLTS received a letter from AELADLE

nz for the address of’his pen friend in Sizens Stanislav

IN, who had been concerned in (WYNNE-ELLIS}, recruitment
by the R.I.S (QYHNE-ELLIS) telephoned AELADLE to say that
he did not have the new address. AELADLE told him that if
he wanted 4t, he could have a visa ‘tomorrow! to visit
Stalingrad (now Velgogrec) end. in the course of conversation
said 'sometines it is better to visit places but not old
friends', We wondered at the time, and ever more after

AELADLE's defection, whether this remark had any special
significance. j

aa
e. “on 16th November AELADLE invited (W¥NNE-ELLIS)
to attend a Soviet concert, AELADLE toid him that he had
peen granted a tourist viea but that if he wished to vioit
his pen friend he would require a letter of invitation Crom
him, ARLADLE asked about tts Britigh frionds in Helsinki and
said that he would phone (@YNNE-ELLID next week to make a
further appointment, He Ad pot do this, a

o¢ (WYNNE-ELLIS) was never aware that AELADLE wae an R.I.S. officer,

wy

f. “A further development which may be of interest
4s that in early January 1902 (WYNXE-ELLIS) received a further
letter from his Russian pen frYend giving him a fairly
pressing invitation to visit him.o6 @MNKE-ELLIS} who was not
aware of AELADLE'e defecticn, wrote to AELADLE telling him
that he had now receivea the invitation, and inviting hip
to coffee at hie house!

2. "We thought that the arrival of this letter (it
wae dated 25.12.61) so shortly after AELADLE's defection, 06
and after a long gap in the correepondence between(WYNNE-ELLIS)
and his pen friend, might indicate that the R.I.S. suspected —
that INE =ELLI. id had a hand in AELADLE's defection.

3e of "A8 you know from an earlier conversation about
this 8 YNNE-ELLIS)is a most unsatisfactory character
to dec) with, and we believe that the R.I.S. have found him

4, “Our questions on the(WYNNE-ELLIS) docunent aupplied
by AELADLE are a8 follows:

not exolude thi:
exolude the po

a. "What is the manuscript word at the top of the
first page, and what-ia its significance?

bd. “The two typed words, one immediately below
the manuscript word on page 1 and the other to the left, are
not legibie on our copy,

co. “Is there any significance in the date llth
“Movember being in inverted commas, thus "11"?

da. “We are puzzled by what at first sight appeared
to be a date, 22,XII.1961, in the heading immediate)v above
the text on page 1. In fact the Roman numerals 'Xii‘ are
the cyrillic letter X77, but we do not understand their
meaning, Can AELADLE explain this?

e, "What is the name in which the document is
Bigned, and does AELADLE know the true identity of this person?

f.d"We are a little surprised at the oyrillic trans-
literation of GYNNE-ELLIS" name, We should have expected the
KOB to have a system which would enable them to get hack to
the correct English spelling. Admittedly (ANNNE-ELLIS) 8 name
is an awkward one to deal with. oG

g. "We should have expected that ABLADLZ would havo
gent a trace request to his Headquarters shortiy after the
first meeting with (#YNNE-ELLIS) in July 1961, Yet the reply
was apparently sent~only on llth November, Can AELADLE
comment on this? %

5. “We do not wish to suggest by these comments that
WS BuBpect that this document might be a forgery, but we
would be grateful for your confirmation that you do not
consider this a possibility.
