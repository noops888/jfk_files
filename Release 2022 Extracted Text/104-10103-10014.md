In addition to the above information, the

undersigned discussed various aspects of the AlIASI case,

and in particular, guestioned A/1 about A-LASH's frame of

mind and future plans which he may have revealed to A/1

aiter Ontrich departed the scene.

A/l made several points,

which basically boiled down to the fact that AMASH was

still not pleaced with the support he was getting fron the

USG side.

The vistt with DAINOLD, who acted in the capacity

of a representative of high levels of the Govt concernod

with the Cuban problem, satisfied AMASH as far as policyy

was concerned, but he was not at all happy with the fact

that he still was not given the technical assistance for

the operational plan as he saw it. A/1 said that AMLASH

dwelt constantly on this point. He could not understand

why he was denied certain snall pieces of equipsent which

promised a final solution to the problem, while, on the

other hand, the USG gave much equipment and money to exile

groups for

their inflective excursions against Cuban

coastal

targets,

According to A/1, ALASH feels strongly:

on this point, and 1f he does not get advice and materials

and we vill lose whatever progress ve have made to date.

A/1 stated that AMLASI! 207 has his leet wet vis-a-vis:

cooperating with USG and has accepted the fact that he mill

work profitably and accurely with

it. It 1s this that wo

stand to lose with our procrastination.

AMLASH a180

talked about going

to the French terrorist group, the

dAS;

in order to get the naderials and guidance he noeds.

It"

1o belloved that he was talled out of this idoa, after the

dangers involved were discussed with AMLASI.

T, With rocord to the radio gear; AMASI stated

that he did

not feel that he wanted to take one in with

hiu, particularly. In view of the recent arrests in Cuba

oi agents carrying concealed radios. He was not opposed,

however, at this time to having a radio cached for him,

to be recovered by hia later.

8.

According to AMMUIP, if there ls any interest

in having AJASIl link up with other trusted assets in

Cuba, these names would have to be given to him before he

returned; otherwise he gould not trust any other meang

veed later inside to get him to initiate or respond to such

contacts.

A/1 stated that AMASH talked about getting

this was the best idea, since 11 RAY came to Paris while

he (LASH) nas there, people would conclude that there was

sonothing between the tro,. Another spot would be better;

thought AMLiSH.

10. At the time of A/l's departure, AMASH

said that he would contact "Jack" (Red Stent, Paris

statior) upon his return to Paris. (This he subsequently

did on the l5th of November, according to info received

Iron Paris-somewhat belatedly).

11. When AMLASIl, A/l, and VENEGAS were together

in Rome and Italy, VENEGAS

told ANLASH that people were

betting that lashl would not return to Cuba.: Some had also

questioned is wother on this point. AllASh reportedly

told VENEGAS to cover all the bets he could as he would

be a rich nan. (It das at this time, according to A/1,

that AllAst decided that he had better return to lavara

By the way A/1

talked, it is fairly certain that AMASH realized that

this was not the kind of a plan walch could even remotely

be expected to receive USG aid. It 1a hoped that he

does realize

the rest of the island could be wrested from the Fidelistas
