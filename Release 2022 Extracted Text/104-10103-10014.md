8. Fingnees, The undersigned was prepared. to
give AMMTP/1 “snifisicnt funds to cover his expenses and
those of AMLASH during the recent three-week gojourn in :
Europe which A/1 made at our ‘request. However, A/1 refused 2
to accept any renunsration whatsoever, stating that. the :
money we had given hin for hig round-trip ticket (¢950,00).
was enough, This, for the record, represents an outlay
conservatively of some $1200 to $1500 by A/l frou his own
pocket on KUBARK behalf,. not to mention the lost time from
his own business. We believe this. gesture should be
ronenbered in future dealings: with A/1.

4. General. A/l wes feeling poorly as the result
of a flu-type. cold when we met. He stated that he wowld not.
have cone in at all were it not for our scheculed meeting.
Nevertheless, he spent willingly several hours with us,
going over the points in which we were interested. The
meeting terminated at 1530 with no incidents of a security
nature noted.

oe, Wh 2a questioned about the identities of ‘followers
of wajor[Zy ELMS) 4/1 stated that it wonld be better to

reter to ANLASH,. as he (a/1) could: only give information that

was three years oid and hence not very accurate. We did not

press the question, nor. suggest mames, as it was. evident’

that he felt that his answers would simply not. give a true,

current picture.

5. A/l provided the full naue of a possible lead
Bee he had discussed earlier with. Ontrich: Raudel RUIZ,

qfnn LLANUZA,: "Director i sports f ‘or..the National Govt-

6.. In a to the above information, the —
“undersigned discussed: various aspects of the AULASH case,
and in particular, guestioned A/l about AMLASH's frame of
mind: and future plang which he may have revealed to A/1L
aitér Ontrich departed the scene. A/l wade several points, ._
which basically boiled down to the fact that AMLASH was :
still not pleased with the support he was getting from the
USG@ side. The visit with DAINOLD, ‘who acted in the capacity
of a:representative of high levels of the Govt concerned
with the Cuban problem, satisfied AMLASH as far as policyy
was concerned , but he was not af ali happy with the. fact
that he still was not given the technical assistance for.
the operational plan as he saw it. A/1l said that AMLASH
dwelt comstantiy on this point. He could not understand
why he was denied certain small pieces of. equipment which
protiised a final solution to the problem, while, on the
other hand, the USG gave much equipment and iioney to exile
groups for their ineffective excursions against: Cuban
coastal targets, According to A/1, AMLASH fecls strongly:
on this: point, and if he does not .geat advice and materials

frow .USG technician, he will probably become: fed-up again,
and we. will lose whatever progress we have made to date.
4/1 stated that AMLASII now has his: feet wet:vis-a-vis
econerating with USG and has accepted the fact that he will

. work profitably. and securely with it. It is this that.we
- stand to lose with our ‘procrastination. AMLASH ‘also

talked about going to the French terrorist group, the OAS,
in‘order’ to get the waterials and guidance he needs.’ It”

"ig belioved that he was talicd out of this idea, after the

dangers involved were discussed with AMLASI.

@. With revard ‘to the radio. gear, AMLASHD stated
that he did not feel that he wanted to take one in with’
hin, particularly in view of the recent. arrests in. Cuba
of agents carrying concealed radios. .He was not opposed,
however, at. this time to havingsa radio cached for him,
to. be recovered by him later. ~

8.. According to AMVHIP, if there is any. interest
in having .AMLASH link up with other trusted assets in ~
Cuba, these ‘names ‘would: have tobe given to him-before he
returned; otherwise he would not trust any other means
pp aba inside-to get hin. to .initiate or respond to.such
contacts. = : ate ce

2 9. : A/1 stated that AMLASH. talked about: getting
aid from, or at least discussing his position, with

Manolo RAY. Tlowever,; he stated that he questioned whether:

this was the best idea, since-if RAY came to Paris while
he'(LASH) was there, people would. conclude that there was
souething between the two,. Another spot would-be better,
thought AMLASH. . ae : : :

10. At the time of A/l's departure, AMLASH

said that he would contact "Jack" (Red Stent, Paris
. Staffer) “upon his return’ to Paris. (This he. subsequently

did on the 15th of: November,-according to info received
“from Paris-somewhat belatedly). :

11.‘ When AMLASIL, A/1, and VENEGAS. were. together
in Rome and Italy, VENEGAS told ANLASH that people were
betting that LASH would not réturn to Cuba..’ Some had also
questioned his wother on this .point.. AMLASH reportedly
told VENEGAS to cover all the bets he could as he would
be a rich nan, . {It tas at this time, according to A/1,
that AMLASH decided that he had better return to Havana

of re-taking Cuba ~ either thru invasion by US troops, or

not to be evr

yage 4 of Attach. A
a.littie sooner than he intelled,. in fact almost. as scon

a ry AMLASH talked about the “two possibilities:

igered seriously at this tine. Also, AMLASH 4
talked ahowt his ability to take some men into the hills :

. Of-Lus Villas Province and taking the smali towns of

Trinidad sid Topes Je Collaates. He said that he and his:
nen could last no more than 15 days in the hills as the
onti-guerrilla fighters sow enployed by the Regine were
ex-g ins th eo and knew the way to fight,dnd

in the hills. ‘Also the Soviet 6quipuent made the govt
‘forces much more formidable than in Batista'a time. ANLASH
apparently was discussing these ideag with the impression
that this waa the way to set up a provisional rebel govt
and thereby invite and gain US support, By the way A/1
talked, it.is fairly certain that AMLASH realized that

_ this was not the kind of a pian which could even reuotely
‘be expected to receive USG@ aid. It is ‘hoped that he
, does realize that Havana must first be taken... or failing

that, a truely sizable niece of land (say, almost ‘an

“entire province): which could be-a true rallying point and

ataging ground under complete Rebel control, from which

“the rest of the island could be wrested from the Fidelistas
and the Connunists. ee

13. In summary, the talks with A/l led the

. undersigned to believe that AMLASI is again entering

one of his skeptical moods, one which our actions ‘have
done little to dispel. Too little and too late.......
