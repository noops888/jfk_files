ADMINISTRATIVE:

Inasmuch as subject is being contacted under the

TECIP program and since there is no indication that subject

status.

In addition to the information as set forth in

the report furnished on 9/30/70, by NO 1283-PC, this source

who is a member of the State Insurance Board, voted favorably

on a recent rate increase "for the insurance industry in the

State of Louisiana. Source said that in return for this favorable

vote, Mrs. PECORA was able to obtain a loan Â°for $225,000

from an unnamed insurance company or companies in Baton

Rouge, La., to finance the acquisition of the building at

300 Decatur st., New Orleans, La.

This building at 300

Decatur st., is a large apartment building in a very

expensive section of New Orleans known as the French Quarter.
