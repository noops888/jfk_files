2.

We believe that the Italian diplomat on the Cubana

f11ght No. 465 on 22 November 1963 from Mexico City to Havana,

cuba, was Mario Maull who was accompanied by his wife, naria

Antonieta MAURI. We have been mable to determine who trans-

mitted the information contained in DIR 86054 to CIA and we

have not been able to locate any documents relating to this

matter in Latin America Division files or the Ofwald file.

We have been unable to locate any documents which

would indicate that there was a response to DIR 86054 from

Mexico City.

4. Assuming there was no response to DIR 86054, the

originating Headquarters component should have initiated

followup action if a response was not received.

We have been unable to find any further information

relating to DIR 86054 in Latin America Division files.

EZ, IMPDET
