Sudject: Background on iexico Station Support Assets
(Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Enbassies)

ateral, coverage. From the time the Nexico Station was opened in

April 1947; (by Bill Doyle) until arrival of Win Scott es COS in 1956, Charles
Anderson III (still in LA/HQ) had developed a support apparatus to SSE
exploit leads from the Soviet Enbassy. This umbrella type project (LIFEAT)
Gonsisted of milti line phone taps, three photo sites, a mobile surveillance
team and a mail intercept operation,

a. Fhone taps were placed by ‘an’et fan’ expo ot “of the telephone company

tapped vas linked’ by availability of a listening gost nearby

4f they S28%ed about: shop,’ they would talk to each other.)

b. Three photo sites were handled by Anderson with the kelp
of Harry Nehoney (retired, living in Chicago) end TDY TSD
people checking the best type of camera, film, and concealment
devices. These had sub-cripts under LIFEAT (LIMITED, LILYRIC,
and LICALLA), LIMITED was a fixed site bang opposite across
the street from the front gate of the Soviet Enbassy which had
both a vehicle and foot entrance. The Soviet gate ‘vas on the

Northliest corner.of their compound and LIMITED was diagonally

across 2 double barrelled street on the Southeast fo-nsret

the Station got word thet the photo of "uniden man" was being released to the

pudlic by the Warren Cosmission. The fhoto operators were moved to another apt

nearby. The property was sold (under an operational agreement with LIMOUSINE

for a long term lease on the top floor of a new apartment blding to te built

on this site), LILYRIC vas planned es an alternate photo base to LIMITED.

It was in an upper storey (3rd floor -check) on the sane side of the street

as LIMITED but in the middle of the block South. It had a slanted view of

the front gate of the Soviet Enbassy. The agents in LIMITED end LILYRIC (both

Yexican fanilies) as far as ve knew, were not acquainted << each other.

LILYRIC was a rented apartment, LICALLA, the PA Sh ves located

4n one of a row of four houses on the Sout an A Enbassy compound
(check date), also using

LIVOUSINE as the purdl AVS site overlocked the back garden of

the Soviet Enbessy cor; The purpose of this operation wes to get good

identification photographs of the Soviet personnel (uno at thet time vere largely

unidentified in Mexico Station records). The three photo sites were handled by

« Ramon Alvarea: (Nexican citizen of U.S. nother ‘iho taught elerentary level at

the American School). “Ramon collected the film exikeximimtiwntttm from LIMITED

when soneone of interest left the/Eabassy gate and stay with then

‘An unidentified man’ (speaking Spanish) calls the Soviet Embassy
Consulate at 1037 hours and asks for the Consul. He is told that
the Consul is not there. The unidentified man asked what is needed
to get visas to go to Odessa. He is told to call back at 1130 hours.

‘At 1235 hours 4 man named ALATRISTE (not a Soviet) from inside the
Soviet Embassy Consulate calls out to number 45-37-72 (Colonial
America, probably a pension or hotel but number not listed in the
telephone directory) and speaks with a man named SAN ROMAN.
ALATRISTE says that he is in the Russian Embassy and they need to
know what day the boat "KALONIA" will arrive in Odessa, that the
Soviets will also need copies of the passenger manifest...

a call was made to the first listing for the in the

Mexican telephone directory (which turned ouj Military Attache).
They got the phone number for the Consulafe ai address. After
making a call to the Consulate and that it would not be open
until 1130 hours, ALATRISTE went ess to get the needed
information.)

(One concludes that ALATRISTE and SAN ROMAN are shippii
for the boat "KALONIA", and needed routine visa int

Just after 1600 hours, the Soviet Consulate received a call from the
Cuban Consulate (Sylvia DURAN) who said she had there a U.S. citizen
who had requested a transit visa to Cuba because he is going to the
USSR. DURAN wants to know with whom he spoke at the Soviet Embassy
because she sent him over to them telling him that if the Soviets
approved the visa then the Cubans would give him one without anything
more, advising the (Department of) Immigration in Cuba.’ She wants
to know with whom he spoke because he says that lie doesn't know
either with what person and who told him that certainly there would
be no problem. The Soviet asks DURAN to wait a minute. After a
short wait DURAN explains the same thing to another Soviet. This
Soviet tells her to leave her telephone (number) and her name and
someone will return the call. DURAN gives her name and telephone
number 11-28-47 then says as a personal thing, she has moved and

has not advised them of a change of address so will not receive their
Bulletin and can give it to them now. The Soviet asks her to call
KOUKHARENKO in order to change that address and asks for the name

of the (Cuban) Cultural Attache. DURAN says it is Teresa PROENZA
whose number is 14-13-26. The Soviet thanks her.
