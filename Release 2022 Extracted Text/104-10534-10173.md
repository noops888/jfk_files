(FOUNDATIONS

OF NOSENKO'S CLAIMS)

Soviet Officials' Statements About NOSENKO

The portrait of NOSENKO which emerges from soviet

officials'

statements about him since his defection coin-

cides markedly with NOSENKO's self-description. According

to the comments of Soviet officials, principally intelli-

gence officers most likely to be speaking authoritatively,

defector NOSENKO was the son of the deceased ilinister, he

served over a decade in the KGB, his personal shortcomings

were overcome

through the patronage of KGB General GRIBANOV,

and in connection wit operations against Americans he

occupied positions of progressively greater trust and

responsibility, ultimately becoming Deputy Chief

of the

largest department in the key Second (Counterintelligence)

Chief

Directorate.

According to these sources, his defection

wrought

severe damage "for

years to come" to the KGB

because of his krowledge of KGB

operations against American

targets, and his treachery prompted

the expulsion and

disgrace of numerous senior KGB

personnel, the recall of

many others from abroad, the virtual suspension of KGB

operations in the United

States, and extraordinary plans to

assassinate him.

These statements are related in chronological order in

NOSENKO is virtually the sole source of information on

his early life. However, this portion of his claimed

biography is consistent with the NOSENKO family's where-

abouts as publicized in press accounts at the time of his

father's death in 1956, and with the existence of the

schools he claims to have attended.

Allowing for exaggerated claims of boyhood heroics

(fighting at the front, attending the Frunze Academy, and

formal induction in and discharge from the Navy), all of

which NOSENKO has retracted under interrogation, NOSENKO's

claimed identity as the son of Minister Ivan I. NOSENKO

NOSENKO has said at various times that the Institute

course was of four years' duration and

that he entered

the

Naval RU on graduation in 1949; that it was four years'

duration and that because he failed a state examination

he

was graduated later, in 1950; that it was of five years'

duration and he graduated in 1950, on schedule; and that it

was of five years' duration but he failed an examination

which delayed his graduation for three months.

Comment:

See p.367 for report that NOSENKO joined the KGB

upon graduation Irom the Institute In 1y4/.

The duration of the Institute course and the

date of NOSENKO's completion are material to

the plausibility of his claimed Naval

Ru service,

which he said followed almost immediately upon

his departure from the Institute.

Naval RU Service (ca. 1951 - ca. 1953!

NOSENKO claims that upon completion of his studies at

the Institute of International Relations he entered the

Naval RU, serving in the Far Fast and then in a Baltic post,

finally successfully "transferring" to the KGB through the

intervention of his father's friend, KGB General KOBULOV.

A sensitive source

is the sole source also asserting that NOSENKO

served in the RU. According tou

, NOSENKO attended Whis

the Military-Diplomatic Academy and then served in the RU

Information Department for about a year before securing a

transfer to the KGB through his father's influence.

NOSENKO

denies having attended

the Military-Diplomatic Academy and

has never claimed service in the RU Information (Reports)

Department,

A sensitive source

two

mans has quoted /KGB officerse

respectively, as stating NOSENKO joined the KGB in 1947

or 1949.

The significance of NOSENKO's RU service is the fact

that he claims it launched his

intelligence career and

served as the means through which he

secured appointment

to the KGB after once having been rejected. The two or more

years he claimed to have served in the RU represent a

significant period of his adult life for which he should

have no difficulty accounting. Finally, the date of his

actual transfer from the Naval RU to the KGB is critical to

determining the time from which his claims about KGB service

can be judged credible.

NOSENKO volunteered extensive comment on his Naval RU

service at his first meetings with CIA in 1962. After his

1964 defection,

it was the topic on which he made one of

his initial retractions and his first admission that he had

earlier made a false claim. The subject of his Naval

RU

service was consequently prominent in interrogations in

1964, 1965 and 1966.

However, throughout these interrogations,

challenges of his assertions about his RU service prompted

adjustments in his claimed date of graduation from

the

Institute or claimed date of entry into the KGB, just as

challenges on those latter topics prompted amended state-

ments with respect to his RU service.

The extent of the

still-unreconciled discrepancies and

contradictions in

NOSENKO's various accounts is best perceived in comparison

of his statements made in 1962, 1964, 1965 and 1966.

NOSENKO's Information-1982

NOSENKO finished the Institute of International Relations

in 1950 and immediately reported for duty with the RU.

He did not amplify how he drew

such an assignment.l

Moscow, and in the Far East, and he chose the Far East

SHAKHOV "mayhe" häd sone contact with MARK in 1960 or 1961.

but NOSENKO did not know the substarce of it.

A counter-

intelligence officer of the First Chief Directorate, S.M.

GOLUBEV, had once been on a delegation with SHAKHOV

and he

had noted "little details".

While SHAKHOV was in the united

States, earlier, he had been terminated las an agent by

KGB officers who had submitted a report stating that SlAkroy

liked life in the Unites States, American products, and

In that KGB report he was depicted as "not good"

not wanting to worl: as an agent'

NOSENKO stated that SHAKHOV had served with the Ministry

of Foreign Affairs in the United States and that during that

service he acted as an agent-recruiter for the KGB. SHAKHOV

was permitted to travel abroad even though suspected of being

an American agent, because he belonged to the Ministry of

Foreign Affairs,

and "the KGB could do nothing about his

trips abroad'.

•There was no proof, only suspicions, and

furthermore, SHAKHOV was a member of the personal

staff of

the head of the Soviet delegation, S.K. Isarapkin."

Accordin?

to NOSENKO, SHAKHOV was not and never had been a KGB officer.

NOSENKO described the various ways he had tested suspicions

of SHAKHOV in Geneva.

He gave SHAKHOV disinformation and then

watched

for an indication that he passed it on to his American

contacts.

SHAKHOV was told to perform countersurveillance

tasks during a meeting by NOSENKO with an imaginary agent,

while other KGB officers checked for signs that SHAKHOV had

forewained the Americans about the meetirg.

Finally NOSENKO

revealed to SHAKHOV the location of a KGB dead drop and

checked five days later to see whether the specially prepared

materials emplaced had been disturbed in any way. NOSENKO'S

conclusion was that SHAKHOV was absolutely free of suspicion.

and it was his intention to report this finding when he re-

turned to KGB Headquarters from Geneva.

Comment: Currently in the United States, SHAKHOV is still

"under suspicion", according to

a sensitive source.

Security Escort Officer for Soviet Disarmament Delegation

NOSENKO Said that he was the sole KGB officer with the 94-

man

Soviet delegation to the Disarmament Conference and

as

such he was responsible for the security and behavior of the

entire delegation.

(KGB officers I.S. MAYOROV and M.S.

TSYMBAL came with the delegation to Geneva, but they had left

Geneva before NOSENKO nade the foregoing statement to CIA.]

To assist him in carrying out his security functions, NOSENKO

had the services of a number of coopted informants of the KGB

who were serving in the delegation. INOSENKO has never re-

ported what, if any, security checks he ran on the delegates

in his charge, or what, if any, information his informants

provided him.)

NOSENKO has never been precise

about how he spent his days

and nights in Geneva, but he has indicated that he disposed

of his time as he saw fit, and for the most part had little

to do.

He explained in 1962 that he could come and go as he

pleased because Ambassador Zorin knew who he was, as did most

of the delegation.

No one paid him any attention.

It was

known that he

was not really a Ministry of Foreign Affairs

officer, and ne could

absent himself from conference

meetings

at any time.

NOSINKO related in i96? that he and GUK were together neary

every day in Geneva, where they went out to chat and have

of GUK's operations 1a Geneva.

He described his "big. big

friend" GUK as the Deputy Legal Rezident in Geneva and the

only "strong officer" in the residency.

Comment: In 1964 NOSENKO attributed his gaining access

GUK. According to several sources (see Annex A .

because of his friendship with NOSENKO, GUi was

dismissed from the KGB.

M.S. TSYMBAL

In 1962 NOSENKO reported TSYMBAL's presence in Geneva and

identified nim as Chict of the Illegals Directorate of the

IGB First Chief Directorate. He alluded to having spoon with

him, but placed no particular emphasis on their relationshig.

T'SYMBAL since 1960 or

1961, when he was looking foi some

candidates for recruitment aud came across some hose baci-

ground would have made them suitable for the Special (Illegale:

NOSENKO met TSYMBAL in Moscow in the KGB Head-

quarters and TSYMBAL had asked him several times to transfer

to the First Chief Directorate and suggested that he might be

assigned to the United States.

In Geneva, he and TSYMBAL had

dinner together several times

a week, sometimes accompanied

by KISLOV and sometimes alone. It was TSYMBAL's influence,

NOSENKO said, which secured NOSENKO access to the residency

in 1962 and established the precedent from which he was

granted access

in 1961.

NOSENKO's Information

SLESINGER came under suspicion by the KGB First

Chief Directorate because of his business transactions

with a number of Soviets who visited his store and in

whom he seemed to show more than

casual interest.

The

First Chief Directorate was of the opinion that

SLESINGER was trying to become closely acquainted with

some Soviets, to study them.

SLESINGER had visited the

Soviet Union

several times.

Learning SLESINGER planned

another trip to the USSR, the KGB suspected that "he

might make some contacts or do something interesting"

while visiting the Soviet Union.

The KGB wanted to

resolve its suspicions that SLESINGER was possibly an

agent or operational contact of the FBI.

The KGB had

a file on SLESINGER, and a senior case officer in the

American Section of

the Seventh Department, Yu. M.

DVORKIN, was the responsible case officer.

An agent

of the Seventh Department who was director of a photo-

graphic shop in Moscow was instructed to become friendly

with SLESINGER while the latter was visiting the Soviet

Union, and the two men later exchanged correspondence.

SLESINGER went to Odessa to

visit relatives, and DVORKIN.

directed the Odessa KGB to "surround" him with agents. who

could watch his behavior. If there had been any indication

of intelligence activities, the KGB would have attempted

to recruit SLESINGER, but since no evidence was developed,

SLESINGER had travelled to the

Soviet Union before, several times.

Comment:

A sensitive source

* had reported to the

FBI that the KGB suspected SLESINGER to

be an FBI "plant"

and that KGB officer

• "might be trying to develop

SLESINGER to act as a courier or in some

other agent capacity."

NOSENKO's information was substantially

coriect.

Alfred Lazarevich SLESINGER,

reported to the FBI in July 1962 of his

June 1962 visit to Moscow and Odessa.

In Odessa SLESINGER was contacted by a

Soviet official who exhibited "intimate

knowledge" of his business in New York

City and had asked whether SLESINGER had

"ever been bothered by the FBI."

Arrest and the KGB Agent

NOSENKO was

asked in Geneva in 1964 whether he was

involved in the arrest of an American tourist in the

USSR in the fall of 1963. Almost at once, NOSENKO

identified the case as that of Bernard KOTEN, a guide for

Atton Tours In New York City (and hence an employee of

Alexander SVENCHANSKIY, see above) who had been arrested

on homosexual charges in Kiev. NOSENKO said that KOTEN

was involved with an American agent of the KGB Scientific

and Technicäl (S&T) Directorate.

NOSENKO did not know. the

agent's name, but from the description he provided he is

believed identical witho

4 a KGB S&T

agent identified earlier on the basis of a May 1962 report

from

a sensitive source.

NOSENKO's Information

KOTEN was a longtime member of the American Communist

Party and a frequent visitor after the Second World Wär

to the Soviet Union, where he had extensive contacts among

dissident literary figures and other Soviet citizens,

particularly among Russian Jews.

[NOSENKO explained

in

another context that the KGB is wary of foreigners' contacts

with Soviet Jews because the Israeli Intelligence Service

has frequently inspired süch contacts. Because of these

many suspicious contacts, both the KGB First and

Second

Directorates had concluded that (KOTEN might be a

NOSENKO's Information

SHUBIN was a native of California of Russian ex-

traction, a Russian speaker, and a university professor

in New York City.

SHUBIN, who had visited the Soviet

Union twice before, visited the Soviet Union in 1958

or 1959, while NOSENKO was serving his first tour of

duty in

the Seventh Department. At that time, SHUBIN

was the target of Seventh Department case officer

A.A. VETLITSKIY, NOSENKO heard later that SHUBIN was

placed under surveillance, and when the KGB surveillance

observed SHUBIN as a passenger in a llinistry of Defense

automobile, the GRU was asked about the American.

"They

very furtively said that they were interested in him,"

from which the KGB concluded that SHUBIN was a GRU agent.

In 1962 (sic) NOSENKO was reviewing a list of foreign

corn to his sov,

visitors to the Soviet Union and he noted SHUBIN's name

and recalled his earlier identification as a GRU agent.

NOSENKO himself telephoned GRU General SOKOLOV's office

and informed SOKOLOV of SHUBIN's presence (or, according

to another version, SOKOLOV's office was advised by

others).

SOKOLOV's office eventually apologized for

having failed earlier to notify the KGB of the GRU's

interest

in SHUBIN.

a sensitive source

Comment: Earlier, &

miss identified af

agent apparently identical with SHUBIN

and FBI sources reported SHUBIN's travel

to the USSR in summer 1961 and in

September 1963.

SHUBIN had no valid U.S. passport

between 1940 and June 1961; if he visited

the Soviet Union during that period it was

not as an American tourist under his true

name.

Consequently, he could not then have

been the tourist target of the Seventh

Department case officer, as NOSENKO claimed.

If NOSENKO erred, and actually was referring

to SHUBIN's visit in 1961, there is a further

contradiction: NOSENKO could not have

noticed his name while reviewing tourist

lists in the Seventh Department, because

he claims he was in the American Department

at the time.

NOSENKO went to Gorkiy on the fourth day after CHERE-

interrogating him on the plane. He immediately confessed

to having given the documents to the Americans. When asked

why, he said he was

"angry at the KGB, very angry", and

besides, he thought he might ask the Americans for some

money in return for the documents.

4 November he had passed the documents to an American tourist

who was a librarian interested in Russian books.

He said he

had given the documents to the American in the entrance

hallway in the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,

the building in which the Ministry of Foreign Irade was also

housed.

Because CHEREPANOV had

eluded the KGB between the two

fixed surveillance posts which had been established, the

Second Chiet Directorate sufferea considerable criticism

for not putting CHEREPANOV under full, round-the-clock

surveillance.

CHEKEPANOV himself, however, told the KG!

that if he had detected his surveillants he would have

written to the government

and newspapers a letter of protest

against "such an indignity, such persecution", and then

would have cormitted suicide, leaving the KGB

without proof

of his guilt.

NOSENKO's assertions with respect to the

Seventh Department at the time.

NOSENKO'S Eventual Retraction Regarding Recall Telegram

NOSENKO maintained throughout his interrogations

in 1964 and 1965 that there was the recall telegram

and that

it prompted his defection.

In October 1966, however, while

veing questioned again, NOSENKO stated that there had bee::

no telegram recalling him

to Mosco!! from Geneva, and he

signed the following statement:

"On 4 February 1964, I told my CIA contact

in Geneva

that a telegram from Headquarters in

Moscow had been received in the KGB Residency in

Geneva recalling me immediately to Moscow.

I said

at the time that this telegram said that I was

recalled to participate in a conference to plan KGB

activity against tourists for the 1964 season.

I

maintained this story as fact throughout subsequent

interviews and interrogations by American authorities

in 1964 and 1965.

No such telegram ever existed.

No telegram was received in Geneva. I admit that

the story was a lie.

I myself invented this tele-

gran in order to hasten my defection.

I was nervous

and afraid that my

contacts with American Intelli-

gence might be noticed."

Knowledge of Other Seventh Department Operations

The notes NOSENKO brought to CIA in Geneva in 1964

(see p. 319) included brief

reference to thirteen other KGB

operations conducted against what NOSENKO described as

tourists during

the 1962-1963 period. For reasons cited

in the description of these operations in Annex B, these

opcrations are not material to MOSENKO's claim to service

in 1962-1963

as cither Chief of the American-British

Commonwealth Section or as Deputy Chief of the Seventh

Department.

(SEVENTH DEPARTMENT - January. 1962-January 1964)

Operational Activities - July 1962-January 1964: Summary

To substantiate his claims to having served as Deputy

Chief of the Seventh Department during this period, NOSENKO

describes KGB invölvement in the recruitment of SVENCHANSKIY

the arrests of KOTEN and BARGHOORN, and the investigations

Of SLESINGER, OSWALD, and of former KGB officer CHEREPANOV,

his discovery that SHUBIN was a GRU agent, and his aasignment

to Geneva.

Even if NOSENKO learned of the operations as

he described and they were as he described (there are substan-

tial reasons why they might have been conducted by KGe

elements other than the Seventh Department, they are atypical

with respect to NOSENKO's own description of Seventh Depart-

ment

operations. They do not accurately characterize, as

NOSENKO claims, KGB counterintelligence operations against

tourists, and thus do not substantiate his Seventh Department

service.

NOSENKO's explanations for his assignment to

Geneva in 1964 are no more plausible than for his earlier

assignment there in 1962. NOSENKO has asserted that he was

not a lieutenant colonel

as the temporary duty authorization

indicated, but a captain, a rank incongruous with a Deputy

Chief of Department and one from which he presumably would

have been promoted as he assumed the senior KGB positions

which he claimed to have held.

As indicated in Annex A, da

reported

several items of information he stated he obtained from

various KGB colleagues.

According to these reports, GRIBANOV

was expelled from

the KGB as a

i consequence of NOSENKO's

defection, it was rumored that GRIBANOV was to be fired

because he had been NOSINIO's friend and patron, that

GRIBANOV was held responsible for the defection

of his

protege, that GRIBANOV had approved NOSENKO's assignment to

Geneva in 1964 despite knowledge of facts making NOSENKO

Ineligible, that GRIBANOV was a long-time friend of NOSENKO's

father, that NOSENKO had been a deputy to a Department Chief

and been en

dcspite his junior rant because of GRIBANOV's influence,

because he willfully withheld information about NOSENKO's

Immediately following his defection NOSENKO continued to

touched on nearly every aspect of NOSENKO'S KGB

this claim. The extent NOSENKO's statements were retracted

SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS

CONCERNING NOSENKO'S BONA FIDES

NOSENKO claims that he served for a decade in the KGB in

successively senior positions of authority from which he

derived extensive knowledge of the scope, character, and

results of KGB operations against Americans in the Soviet

Union in the perica 1953-1963. To substantiate his claim,

he provides an impressive array of information about KGB

personnel, organization and operations which, to the extent.

ration which, e

that it has been

confirmed, is presumptive evidence of his

bona fides.

Various soviet officials, including intelli-

gence officers, have generally corroborated NOSENKO g

claims.

According to some of these sources, NOSENKO waS

¿ senior KGB officer who occupied a series

of sensitive

positions, who enjoyed considerable authority and trust

despite personal shortcomings, and whose defection,

"the

greatest loss

ever suffered by Soviet Intelligence"

paralyzed

the work of

KGB

The examination has

compared

each element of NOSENKO's

biography relevant to his claimed KGB service with known

facts and reasonable surmise.

The examination reflects

the test to which his accounts were put:

whether his

accounts are internally coherent and consistent with known

fact, and whether he actually gained the information he has

e on oat t2 one

from occupying the KGB positions he claims to have held.

In short, is he what he says he is, according to his own

accounts?

At one

of their final meetings before JOHNSON returned to the United

States, VLASOV told JOliNSON that a Soviel Intelligence officer

had defected to the Americand in Geneva, and chat extreme

caution must therefore be exercised in JOHNSON's contacts

with the KGB. VLASOV said that the defector could. not identify

According to a sensitive source from a KGB officer

The KGB was lucky that the Americans found only

40

microphones in the U.S. Embassy in Moscow.

Actually,

about 200 microphones were concealed by the Soviets in the

Embassy: NOSENKO was responsible for furnishing information

tö the Americans which resulted in the microphones being

found. NOSENKO knew only the general location of the 40

microphones which were found and does not have any knowledge

of the remaining ones.

1.2 June 1964

Professor John M. THOMPSON reported at the American

Embassy in

Moscow that an unnamed Soviet official with whom

he was acquainted told him that NOSENKO was a

NOSENKO is considered to be vastly

more important than either

GOLIISYN Or DERYABIN. This opinion appears to be based on

several factors:, First, NOSENKO worked against personnel

stationed at the American Embassy in Moscow and with his

agents were developed among these Americans.

Second, "It 1s

familiar with the number of

microphones which had been

installed in the

Embassy by the KGB'

and the locationg of

these microphones.

Third, as a Deputy Chiaf of a depart-

ment, NOSENKO would normally have had

a telephone

i8 a formidable one

1n the minds if other KGB employees, 15 that NOSENKO

ravelled in a rather influential circle of friends in

Moscow who were high in the Soviet Government. All these

comments were cited as reasons for NOSENKO being an

"important catch"

for American Intelligence, but no one in

the kGB really knows exactly how much information NOSENKO

had concerning the kGB.

29 June 1964

• GULIISYN (fron personal acquaintance): NOSENKO, the son

of the

former Minister of Shipbuilding, was a KGB officer

who had worked in the American Department and the Seventh

Department of the Second Chief Directorate. GOLITSYN, while

on his owr Flrst Chief Directorate budiness, net NOSENKO two

oI three times in the American Embassy Section In 1953,

and had seen him occasionally at work during 1958 and 1959.

When COLITSYN asked him where he was working in 1959, NOSENKO

replied that he was assigned to the Seventh Department.

NOSENKO served in the American Embasy Section from 1953.

until 1957 oi 1958, and was specifically responsible for

KGB coverage of American military personnel in Moscow during

1953. For the remainder of his service in the Embassy Section

until 1957

or 1958, NOSENKO may have had the same responsi-

bilities or may

have been working against other Embasay

personnel or correspondents, but he was definitely. in the

American Department during the entre perlod. In 1957 or

1958 NOSENKO was

transferred to the Seventh Department, and

was a senior case officer there

as of 1959. NOSENKO did not

work in the American Department

of the Second Chief Directorate

American Department at

any time during 1960; GOLITSYN visited

the Embassy

Section on at least three occagions from early

1960 to early

1961, and would have known if NOSENKO had been

7): An investigating commission of the

CPSU Centräl Committee checking into the circumstances

surrounding NOSENKO's defection has thus far been responsible

for the expulsion from the KGB of 15 Second Chief Directorate

employees.

Thes::

include GRIBANOV, who was also expelled

from the CESU ind was stripped of his rank of lieutenant

general. GRIBANOV has been given a very small pension, 11ke

an ordinary soviet ritizen.

This drastic action was taken

since the piinary responsibility for the defection was placed

on GRIBANOV.

It was realized that, in addition to being Chief

of the second Chief Directorate

at the time of the defection,

GRIDANOV was a personal friend of NOSENKO and had more or :

less treated NOSENKO as a protege and had taken many steps

to further NOSENKO's career within the KGB..

from the KGB,

whom was a Major General BANNIK

NOSENKO, until October 1966, stated that a telegram had been received

in the Geneva Residentura ordering NOSENKO to return to the USSR in

according lo NOSENKO in interviows prior to October 1966, had beer

reccived in the Residentura the morning of the same day he met his

CLA contacts and stated he had defected.

In October 1966, NOSENKO responded to a casual mention oi

the "recall telegram" with a complete retraction of his previous

state-

ments on the subject. NOSENKO stated, and has

subsequently maintained,

that there was not a "recall telegram." He has explained that he invented

the "recall telegram" matter because he was concerned about his personal

safety in remaining "in place" for à longer time. NOSENKO has stated

he thought the aliged "recall telegrara" would be accepted by Cia as

à logical reason íor his precipitate desection.
