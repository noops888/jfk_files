MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD.

SUBJECT:

Telecon with Senate Select Committee Staff

1. ' Mr. Dan Dwyer contacted the undersigned tele-

phonically and referred to comments made by Messrs.

Rocca and Hartman regarding the Garrison investigation.

According to these two gentlemen, there was an individ-

ual within the CI Staff who prepared weekly summaries

of the Garrison investigation.

Mr. Dwyer asked if I

knew who this person might be. I advised that as I

had previously stated to him I was unaware of any such

summaries being prepared nor did I know who might have

prepared them.

Mr. Dwyer then went on to say that

while he was not interested in reviewing the Garrison

201 itself, he wished to know if there was a machine

run on the file available for his perusal when he next

came to Headquarters building. I advised that I was

unaware of the existence of the 201 and if one existed

I had no knowledge to whom it might be charged or what

its contents were.. Regarding a machine run I simply

did not know whether one was available assuming there

was a 201.

Mr. Dwyer asked if I could check into the

machine run and I assured him I would.

2. In response to Mr. Dwyer's query regarding a

G-135A check, I told him that I had reviewed the files

and located such an INS request dated 5 December 1961

and not 13 December 1961 as he had indicated.

Moreover

the document in question was in the Office of Security

file on Oswald which he, Dan Dwyer, had previously

reviewed.

Mr. Dwyer commented that he may have missed

it. However the 13 December 1961 date was the Agency

responses to the Senate investigators. I suggested

that I would double check the files to see if we

have a copy of the response to INS.

If we do not

then I suggest that Mr. Dwyer ask INS to burn a copy

of the document in question and refer it to us.

Once received we will then make it available to the

Select Committee for review.

4. Based on above the undersigned checked with

Mr. Mayo of CI Staff regarding the existence of a

st above

20] on Garrison.

Mr.

Mayo advised on 5 December that

a 201 did indeed exist which contained two documents

and three cross references and that the remainder of

material associated with the Garrison investigation

was in the 100-300-017 file charged to C/CI/R&A.

Efforts are currently underway by MI. Mayo to locate

the 100-300-017 file.
