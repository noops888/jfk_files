MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Career Management Group

SUBJECT:

Promotion of Mr. Calvin W. Hicks

1.. I would solicit Career Management Group and the Promotion Panel

to consider the overall career of Calvin W. Hicks when deciding on the cur-

rent cycle of promotions from GS- 13 to GS-14.

2. After Mr. Hicks EOD in 1950, he advanced rapidly in three years

to GS-11.

He was promoted to GS-12 In 1956, six years later to. GS-13 in

1962, and since then has been almost 12 years In grado.. He has had over-

seas tours with FE and NE Divisions, has served as a training instructor, on

a PM task force, and with Miami Ops and area branches in Wil. In these

assignments he consistently recelved Strong ratings. Despite a largely para-

military background, in 1967 he adjusted to the intelligence production cycle

and developed the skills of an operatións officer doing operations-oriented

reports work in the Intelligence Watch. As of this date he has the longest

continuity in'the Intelligence Watch and is rated as a mature and thoughtful

Individual who exercises excellent professional judgment. He was recom-

mended for promotion from GS-13 to GS-14 in April 1968 and in April 1969.

In 1970 he was recommended for a @SI by FI Chief, Peer deSilva. He was:

again recommended for promotion in March 1971, In November 1972, and in

November 1973.

3.

Admittedly, promotions are competitive and the rankings are rela-

tive and must be adjusted to the headroom available. The overall history of

his career would seem to argue the equity of granting the often recommended

promotion to Mr.. Calvin Hicks as he nears the end of a career. Mr. Hicks is

49 years old and has a family of five children. He has a medical hold which

will not allow him to serve overseas at this time and he therefore, contem-

plates retirement at age 50 (in late 1974). He is and will be until then a

valuable member of the Intelligence Watch.

4. I recommend that the promotion which has escaped him in the last

decade be granted at the time of this year's promotion cycle.

SUBJECT

Recosmendation for the Promotion of Calvin W. Hicks: (056361)

to 65-14

1. I would again like to recommend the promotion of subject officer from

GS-13 to GS-14.

Mr.. Hicks has been with the Intelligence Watch since June 1967

and his performance has been characterized. consistently. by exceptional proficiency.

He serves on a rotating schedule with seven other officers ‹ doing identical work,

some of whom are currently in GS-14.

A medical hold has precluded any further. overseas assignments and for

this reason his stay in IW has been extended until November 1974, when he will

be 50-years-old at which time he plans to retire under the Agency retirement

Mr. Hicks' resourcefulness and ability to apply the multitude

reporting. Instructions and techniques have been convincingly demonstrated in

crisis situations such as the recent Chilean coup ánd the Middle-Eastern crisis.

He has consistently displayed initiative and guod judgment in meeting unforeseen

crisis with rapid. and effective

action and has clearly demonstrated his ability

to continuously adjust to rotating shifts and the irregular flow of traffic.

For his sustained high level of performance in 1972 Mr. Hicks received

a quality step increase in recognition

and as proof of the high esteem in which

he is held by his superiors.

a GS-14 slot. His promotion is again

recommended in recognition of his long years of Agency service.

1. The officers of the Intelligence Watch (IW) perfornied

Intelligence watch Assistance to

European

Division

As I am preparing to leare the European Division,

a note of

appreciation is in order for the services rendered

to us for the four years of my tenure hero by the officers

of the Intelligence Watch.

2.

At a time of increasingly complicated intelligence

collection and reporting problems.. our Agency has come of

•age..

that information often cannot be

allowed. to

wait for attention until sunrise, and that we

must be ablo to respond to national needs and world events

around the

clock.

The Intelligence Watch, moro than any

other single institution,

has made it possible for us to

dó this.

We have

benefited

its coopcration particularly

under

strained reporting conditions - during Presidential.

trips

abroad, for instance - but have

also found If's

presence and judgment helpful at other times.

I know that

my staff relied on IW extensively.

making a point of recognizing this because

the Intelligence Watch

-= a bit like our Agency as a whole

is apt to git more attention with as occasional slip than

with a record of continuing accomplishment and success in

coping with problems.

From what I have been able to observe,

the job' has been well done.

4.

I hope you will bring this renorandum to the

attention.of those concerned.

Awards Panel

Request for Quality Step Increase

Mr.

Calvin W. HICKS,

GS-13

(056361)

I recommend that a Quality Step Increase be

awarded to Mr.. Calvin H. Hicks.

Mr.. Hicks is one of three officers in the intel-

ligence Watch, FI Staff,

on whom identical recommendations

are being submitted.

These officers, all in grade GS-13,

have for several years done responsible and demanding work,

identical to that done in the

same office by live other of-

ficers, GS-14 and 15, and

all' three have been ráted "Strong."

3.

The Intelligence Watch is the primary intelligence

the Clandestine Service.

put .of.over 2,000 reports a month is the chief end-product

of CS collection operations.

Watch Officers serve on a

rotating schedule.. When an officer draws the night shift

he serves alone.

He must make quick, independent dissemina-

•tion decisions.

Mr. Hicks has done well at this work.

is alert and conscientious. and has

a sharp operational sensé

which is extremely useful in the handling of CS intelligence

information. He has been recommended several times for pro-

motion to GS-14.

The high quality of Mr. Hicks's performance has

continued for more than two years.

There is no reason to

expect any decline-in it. His enthusiasm continues,

his tour has recertly been extended for another two years.

5. Consideration has been given to recommending him

for an Honor

and Merit Award, but on balance I believe that

a Quality Step Increase would be more appropriate.

high cnliber.. "ormally six months are required before an officer neuly

assigned to the Intölligence watch is able to handle a shift by himsell.

At least a ycar is required before a Natch Officer can perform at a high

level of proficiency,

However; in the case of this officer, in a little

more than a year he had earned the inting of "Strong" and has mintalned

1t ever since.

Although most of his leency experience had been in para-

military operntions, he adapted quickly to the demands of his new assign

ment.

His keenly developed sense of operntionnl security,

coupled with

his cloar understanding of the relationship between operntions and

Intelligence, has mede him a very fine officer and a valuable asset to

opportunity to observe his performance under conditions of stress. He 1s

these are usually of the clerlinl varlety, rot in matters of judgment. I

contime to be Impressed with his thoroughness in handling information;

with the evidence of his coordinition when the interests of more then one

division are involved. Since operstions have to be subnerged and the

intelligence is the portion of the lceberg which shows to the intelligence

communiy, the performance of tho Watch Officers 1s of great importance.

This factor becomes apparent when it is noted that about so, of all cabled

the l'atch Officers were connended by the Chief, FI Staff ard the Chief,

Europe Division for their performance during the iresident's trip to

liestern Europo.

The simultaneous outbreak of crises in different parts of

the world further added to the burdens of the Watch Office at thet time.

Mo. Hicks made a real contribution during that period and deserves the

commendation personally in a high degree.

CHIEF, FI/INT/IW

ATTACHMENT

I heartily endorse this recommendation that Mr. Hicks be

promoted to GS-14. As his supervisor points out, Mr. Hicks,

when he came to the Intelligence Watch, was essentially a

guerrilla warfare field operational aficer. Positive intelll-

gence information reporting and the handling of reports were

new to hiin, and called for professional skills and other

qualities radically different from those which most of his

previous experience had brought into play.

Yet in a relatively

short time, Mr. Hicks has developed the skills required of a

Watch Officer, and thanks to this and to other strengths has

become one of the most valuable officers in the unit.

He continues to display initiative

resourcefulness and good judgment in the performance of the duttes assigned to an IW

officer.

-Mr. Hicks. has. been with the intelligence Watch since June 1967.

A medical hold has

precluded any turther overseas assignments and for this reason his tour in' IW. has been

extended until he reaches age: 50 (November 1974) at which time he plans to retire under

the Agency retirement system.

Throughout this period he has continuously applied himsel

with diligence and enthuslasm. Even after some protracted sick leave periods he has

returned ready to step. in and pick up where he left off which is the best proof of his

mastery of details and

Since the inception of his IW assignment he has borne the same responsibilities and

carried the same burdens as his colleagues in the GS-14 category and continúes to per-

form at this level. For this sustained high-level of performance in 1972 he received a

quality, step increase in recognition and as proof of the high esteem in which he is

held by his superiors.

* Mr. Hicks:

resourcefulness and ability to apply the myriad of reporting skills and

techniques has been clearly demonstrated in crisis situations such as the recent

Chilean political upheaval and the current Near Eastern crisis.

Mr. Hicks continues to perform with exceptional

proficiency.

In April 1972 he

was granted a Quality' Step Increase: in recognition and as proof of the high esteem

in which he is held by his supervisor in the Clandestine Service.

Mr.'Hicks' services have been particularly valuable during this reporting period

because of DDP's acreased concern regarding the strict maintenance of operational

security in the dissemination of its intelligence information. Mr. Micks has been in-

strumental in referring many reports when in the opinion of tw officers, the authen-

tication statement and the manner in which the report is written would help to pinpoint

the source of the information if the report fell in unauthorized hands.

Mr. Hicks

notations on, the If log cards which record the action taken on each report indicate the

seriousness. in which Mr. Hicks approaches his daily tasks and his contribütions in

reminding Divisional personnel about the essential elements of good reporting and the

need to comply with the prescribed format.

-The exercise of good judgment in referring. or consulting on an Intel: Cable prior to

its dissemination to the Intelligence Community is an essential element in the proper

functioning of this office and upon which depends to a certain extent the Agency's

reputation.

With the retirement and reassignment of several Il officers during this reporting

period, Mr. Hicks

is

now the Il officer with the most experience and continuity on the

job..

This together with his maturity of judgment and ability to withstand the rigors and

pressures. Inherent in an around-the-clock activity, make Mr. Hicks a distinct asset in

the unit.

The assignment carries no supervisory responsibilities and does not require any

COURSE CBJECTIVES AND METHOD.

Course objectives are to aid participants to: learn the managerial theories

contained in the Grid; understand their personal managerial styles in Grid

defms; evaluate convictions about managerial values; develop team action

skills; increase candidness of communication; strengthen the use of critique

for broblem-solving and learning; and acquire an appreciation of Organization

Custure and Development.

The method of learning offers a challenge to all participants regardless of

level or experience.. A Grid Seminar is not "taught" in the usual sense. In

-Grid teams, participants solve complex management problems. Objective

solutions are made available. Individual and team performance is repeatedly

asgessed.

Various measuring instruments are used to evaluate effectiveness.

Critique sessions ässist each participant to understand how he might

change his own behavior to increase his problem-solving effectiveness.

Thus

managers are not told the best way to manage, but they learn by convincing

themselves.

About twenty to thirty hours of study are completed as prework. Insights

gained are deepened and personalized during. the intensive 50-hour Seminar.

ACHIEVEMENT RECORD

This is a certificate of attendance only. No attempt was made to evaluate

student achiavement in this course.

NOTE::

5 January 1967 during which time Mi. Hicks worked

Desk.

This report is being submitted becausó of reassinment of

the rating officer.

Although Mr.

Hicks is an experienced officer with strong

qualifications and abilities, it should be noted that some aspects

o1 his present job were a new experience for him, since his past

'experience has been entirely. in the PM field.

However, Mr. Hicks

adapted well and quickly to the new environment, showed a great

deal of initiative and resourcefulness in familiarizing himself

with the work, and by bringing sound operational and administrative

experience to bear, carried out his duties in a thoroughly competent

manner.

He demonstrated unconmon ability to organize his work,

anticipate problems or requirements, and take effective action

promptly.

In dealings with his associates he exercisod a good

balance of persunsiveness and friendliness which paid dividends

in terms of getting a job done.

He can be relied on absolutely

to carry out a given task promptly and well.

I would welcome any occasion which permitted li. licks to

work with me again.

COMMENTS dO REVIEWINO OFFICIAL

Mr. Hicks is a mature and

thoughtful individual who made

the switch from PM to FI activities at his own volition.

was originally scheduled for a field assignment to a WH Station

in the fall of 1966, but for medical reasons will probably be

staying at Headquarters for some time.

While this restriction

may. limit his ability to get that feel for FI fiold operations

which a Headquarters desk officer should have, he has previous

field experience in a PM capacity to compensate for this.

gence Watch/FI Staff where he has remained up to the present.

Mr. Hicks

has received overall ratings of.strong" from 1968 through 1971, with his

performance characterized as exceptionälly profictent:

Of the seven

officers with whom he serves on a rotating basis;

four are GS-14's:

The

FI Staff has recommended Mr. Hicks for promotion in 1968, 1969, 1971 and

1972, with a recommendation for QSI in 1970. None of these recommenda-

tions were approved.

3.

The Board has noted that Mr. Hicks plans to retire in 1974 at
