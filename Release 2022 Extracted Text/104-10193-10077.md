Proinotion of ad Galvin W: Hicks :

1,. ‘I would solicit Career: Management Group.and the Promotion Panél ee

to consider the overall career of Calvin W. Hicks when deciding on the cur-
rent cycle: of promotions from GS-13 to GS-14,

oe 2. After Mr. Hicks -EOD in 1950;, Ke advanced rapidly in three years

to GS-11. He was promoted to GS-12 In 1956, six years later to.GS-13 in
.1962, and. since then has been almost 12 years In grade...He has had over-
seas tours with FE and NE Divisions, has served 4s a training instructor, on.
a PM task, force, and with Miami Ops and area branches in WH. In these *
“assignments he. consistently received Strong ratings, Despite a largely para~
military background, in 1967 he adjusted 'to.the ‘intelligence production‘cycle
-and developed thé skills. of an operations officer. doing operations~orlented

~ reports work in the Intelligence Watch. As of this date he has the longest

continuity in'the Intelligence Watch and is rated as a mature and thoughtful
individual whe;exercises excellent professional judgment, He was recom=
mended for promotion. from GS-13 to GS-14"in April 1968 and in April 1969.
In 1970 he was: tecommended: for a QSI-by: FI Chief, Peer deSilva. He was,
“again recommended for promotion in March 1971, In November 1972, and tn
November 1973.

3, Admittedly, promotions are competitive and the rankings are rela
‘tive and must be adjusted to the headroom available, The overall history of
his career would seem to argue the.equity of granting the often recommended
Promotion to Mr, Calvin Hicks as he nears ‘the end of a career. Mr. Hicks is
49 years old and has’a. family of five children, He has a medical hold which
will not allow him to serve overseas at this time and he therefore, contem-
plates rétirement at age 50 (in late 1974), He is and will be until then a
valuable member of the Intelligence Watch.

4. Irecommend that the promotion which has escaped him in the last
decade be granted at the time of this year's promotion cycle.

As, I am. preparing to leave the European ‘Divisisa,
a note of ‘appreciation as in order. ‘for the services renderéd
to us for the four years of my ‘tenure’:here by the officers

of the Intelligence Watch.

2, At a time of: increasingly complicated intelligeace

‘age. We have recognized that information often cannot be
allowed. to wait for attention until sunrise, and that we
inust be able \to™ réspond to national needs and world. events
» The «. “Intelligence Watch, more than any
other single institution, has made it possible for us to

do this. We have benefited from its cooperation particularly

‘under strained reporting ‘conditions -- during Presidential.
trips abroad, for instance -- but have also found IW's
presefice and “judgment helpful ati otker times. I know that
my staff relied on IW extensively. : :

3. %I am making a point of recognizing this because
a bit like our Agency as a whole --

with a record of continuing accomplishment and success in
coping with problems. From what I have been able to observe,
the job’has been W611 done.

tep Increase: :
Mr. Calvin W.:HICKS, GS-13." (056361)

I recommend that a Quality Step Increase be

‘awarded to Mr. ‘Calvin W. Hicks.

Be. Mr. Hicks 1s one of three officers in the Intel-
ligence watch, FI Staff, on whom identical recommendations
are. being submitted, These officers, all. in grade GS-13,
have for’ Several‘ years done responsible and demanding work,
identical to that done in;the same office by five other of
‘ficers, GS-14 and “15, and‘all’ three’ have been rated "Strong."

3. The Intelligence’ Watch is the primary intelligence
dissemination office of the Clandestine Service. Its out~
put .of over 2,000 reports''a month is.:the chief ‘end-product
of CS ci Jlection operations, Watch: Officers serve on a
‘rotating schedule... When an officer draws the night. shift
he serves alone. .He must maké quick, independent dissemina-
ir, Hicks has done well at this work. He
is alert and .conscientious~and, has a sharp operational sensé
which 4s extreniely useful in the handling of CS intelligence
information, Hé has been: recommended several times for | pro-

motion to GS-14,

4. The high quality of Mr. Hicks's performance has
continued for more than two years, There is no reason to
expect any decline-in it. His enthusiasm continues, and
his tour has recently been extended for another two years.

8. Consideration has been given to recommending’ him
for an Honor and Merit Award, but on balance I believe that
a Quality Step Increase would be more appropriate.

ATTACHMENT

T heartily endorse this recommendation that-Mr. Hicks be
promoted to GS-14. As his‘supervisor points out, Mr. Hicks,
when he came .to the Intelligence Watch, was essentially a

errilla warfare field. operational officer. Positive intelli-
gence information reporting and the handling of reports were
new to him, and called for professional skills and other
qualities radically different from those which most of his
previous exyerience had brought into play. Yet in a relatively
short time, Mr, Hicks has- developed the skills required af a
Watch Officer, and thanks. to this and to other strengths has
become one of the most valuable officers in the unit.

debriefing and in-exfLltration of agents; supervision of the
infiltration of ‘sipplies and bodies by efr for the Paramilitary
Operations Section; case officer for certain high level agents

and thetr W/T operators inside the ‘target area, Mr. Wicks’ maturity,
common sense and varied experience enabled him to operate with

the minimum of supervision. Ne trained certain agents in trade-

eraft, air and maritime reception, siapping, end guerrilla warfare

with the result that those agents received the only completely
succéssful air drops. In addition, geome of thesa agents handled

and trained by Mr. Hicks became our most trusted and important.

agents, and a large measure of their willingness to go on after
continued frustrations was due to their respect for, and trust

and confidence in, Mr: Hicks.

maturity, common sense, stability, and ability to make decisions

Mr, Hicks is a mature and thoughtful individual who made
the switch from PM to FI activities at his own volition, He
was originally scheduled for a field assignment to a WH Station :
in the fall.of 1966, but for medical reasons will probably be
staying at Headquarters for some time, While this restriction
may. limit his ability to get ‘that feel. for FI ficld operations
‘which a Headquarters desk officer should have, ‘ho has previous
field experience in:a PM capacity to compensate for this.
