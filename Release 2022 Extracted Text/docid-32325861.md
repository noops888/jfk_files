victim out of plus another. $5,000 for all the trouble they had
caused.

As previously reported, PAULDINO's wife, a Denver
stripper, SHILO WILLIAMS left Denver by plane at. the appro-
priate time in January, with a large amount of money, in an .
effort to free’ PAULDINO, her husband, who was telng kept cap-
tive by “The Mafia."

“DN 341-C=TE reported on 2/23/68, that Dallas
hoodlum. JAMES DOLAN set up at the victim in New Orleans for
PAULDINO and WOOLVERTON, and reportedly checked him out
pefore. giving PAULDINO and WOOLVERTON the O.K. to swindle
him. This source said, when DOLAN learned of what happened
to PAULDINO in New Orleans, DOLAN became alarmed and made
sure that he always had a weapon on ‘his person inasmuch
as he thought possibly he could, in the near future, get
a visit from New Orleans or Kansas City hoodlums.

This source, who is in an extremely sensitive
position, advised that DDOLAN has taught WOOLVERTON, and
other Denver hoodlums, how to operate most of the
swindles they have been involved in and also has caused
them to rob other gamblers who reportedly will never
report the robbery to police because of their own illegal
activities.

2 This source stated that approximately two or
three months ago, he saw DOLAN with WOOLVERTON in Denver,
but had no information as to DOLAN's whereabouts other than
he understood he was residing in the Dallas area.

ROBERT WOOLVERTON, who is DOLAN's closest 7
associate in Denver, recently was arrested along with Denver
hoodlum PAULDINO in February, 1968, for the armed robbery
of one LESLY COHEN, of Las Vegas, Nevada, a known gambler,
on 1/15/68. They both are waiting trial on this matter
but. continue to be observed in the Denver area where
both have residences.
