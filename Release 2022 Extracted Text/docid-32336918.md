MULEY in care of ARTURO G. MATA, Poste Restante Central —
Lieges, Belgium. He stated that whén he was about ready to
leave Madrid, Spain, he sent a telegram to the above mentioned
address, and addressed it to ARTURO G. MATA. He stated he
did not know recall the contents of this telegram, but that
he was certain that he did not state that he was leaving
Spain with instructions for MATA. On arriving in Brussels,
Belgium, GUTIERREZ attempted to locate both MATA and MULEY
through the Cuban Embassy located in Brussels, but was un-
successful as no one there appeared to know either of these
individuals. He said he then sent MATA a second telegram
to the Same address in Liegés, Belgitm, but received no
response. The Cuban Ambassador to Bélgium then” “personally ~
drove him to Lieges, Belgium, and the two of them managed
to locate MATA through inquiry in a bar in the Spanish ©
colony in Lieges. GUTIERREZ stated that after he met
MATA, the latter introducéd.him to ADDERRAMAN MULEY, and
he admitted that the threeof them discussed Spain and its
present problems, and that MATA and MULEY both informed
him that (they were actively engaged in fighting against
FRANC! ANCO. GUTIERREZ stated that both ADDERRAMAN
aa “MULEY an@ARTURG G. MATA were members of the Directorio ~
Révolucionario Iberico de Libexmacion (DRIL), and that he
believed ADDERRAMAN MULEY was one of the directors of
DRIL. GUTIBRREZ-said he had no prior knowledge of
ARTURG ©, WATA, and did not know if he had ever been in
Cuba, or whether he had uy with the present

regime of FIDEL CASTRO.

SA T-2, a Confidential Source Abroad, advised on
December 28, 1960, that ELOY GUTIERREZ MENOYO was reported
to be a leader of the organization known as DRIL, and that
he reportedly was sent to Belgium for the purpose of organiz—
ing the Liege Branch of this organization, and that he had
- come to Belgium t find out as much as possible about DRIL

and its real value as a movement capable of overthrowing

the FRANCO government in Spain. SA T-2 further advised

that GUTIERREZ MENOYO arrived in Belgium by air from Madrid

on July 21, 1960, and that since he had entered Belgium
clandestinely, and since his presence was considered to: be
dangerous for the public welfare, GUTIERREZ MENOYO was

the object of an explusion order issued on August 10, 1960 EF

SA T-2 advised that GUTIERREZ MENOYO had been arrested on
August 6, 1960, and that after the issuance of the explusion i
order, hé was released on August 11, 1960, and left Belgium

GUTIERREZ’ MENOYO, and was. expelled from Belgium on August vo
1960. ta : ‘
Continuing the interview, GUTIERREZ MENOYO stated '
that he remained in Lieges, Belgitm, for about three days,
visiting with individuals who lived in the Spanish colony ‘in
that city, when he was suddenly arrested, placed in jail, —
and thrextened with a retwrn to Spain. He said he is certain
- that the FRANCO government in Spain put pressure on the Span- z fe
ish Embassy in Brusséls, Belgium, ,to have Belgium police
arrest him, and place him in jail. He said that after about
three days the government of Cuba lodged an informal com-
Plaint with Belgium, and arrangements were then made to”
expel him from the country. GUTIERREZ said he signed the .
explusion order, but did so under protest, claiming that . _ |
the arrest had been illegal and that his incarceration was pod. ro)

GUTIERREZ stated that he flew from Brussels,-Belgium,
to Paris, France, and remained in Paris about 2 lays, during Hl

‘that when his vacation in Paris was nearly completed, he

7) tickets for a return flight by way of Lilebon, Portugal, ‘
a Santa Maria in the Azores, and from there to Cuba. He said he '
spent six days in Santa Maria, the Azores, waiting for the
Madrid-Havana plane. While there, he stated that Portuguese
: authorities examined him very closely, which was undoubtedly
| performed at the instigation of the FRANCO government in aaa
Spain.

GUTIERREZ, in commenting on his European trip,
stated that the trip had no intelligence nor espionage
aspects or significance and that he had made the trip HY)

MARTINEZ then made a desi with the FRANCO police for his ‘
