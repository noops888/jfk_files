circumstances prevented execution

of this sabotage and he

described the location on the highway between Ciudad

Mante and Ciudad Victoria where the explosives and

the magnets to be used for attaching the explosives

to

the hull of a ship were buried.

He also advised

that FIORINI had received a $200 money order from

ORLANDO BOSCH,

sent by BOSCH from Miami to

Cludad Mante.

As of July 5, 1967, a confidential source

abroad

previously been described by RONALD EDWARD THOMPSON. This

source advised that a money order for $200 had been

received by FRANK FOURGIS, Hotel Mante, Ciudad Mante,

on April 13, 1967, sent by one ALDO HERNANDEZ KOS

When interviewed on May. 1, 1967,

claimed his trip to Mexico in April, 1961, together

-with DONALD ROCHE and his step-son RONNIE THOMPSON, was

he carried any explosives to Mexico in his 1958

Cadillac, which he used on the trip. He denied that

ORLANDO BOSCH had sent him money to Mexico but said a

Cuban friend had sent him $100,00 from Miami.

On July 24, 1967, ALDO FERNANDEZ, 2000

married to the sister of Dr. ORLANDO BOSCH. He denied
