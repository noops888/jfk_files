On September 16, 1970, a representative of the FBI
observed the arrival of the U.S. An Imperialist Delegation
on Aix France flight 707 from Paris, France, at John F.
Kennedy International Airport, New York City, New York.

The delegation was subject to a customs se xch in which a_
box containing letters of American prisoners of war held in
North Vietnam was temporarily seized from SCHEER by customs
officials. On the same date this delegation called a press
conference at John F. Kennedy Airport, New York. A.
representative of the FBI attended this conference in which
the following prepared statement was made by SCHEER:

"the US Peoples Anti~Imperialist Delegation arrived
in New York today after a two month trip to North Korea,
North Vietnam, and China. As a result of this solidarity tour
the American Movement has effectively established warm
relations with the revolutionary mov

gation, which represents a cross section of American Left,
was headed by comrade ELDRIDGE CLEAVER, Minister of the Black

ROBERT SCHEER. This delegation's tour of the capitols of
asia initiated a new policy of peoples‘ diplomacy. This
policy was proven successful because we were officially
received in Pyongyang, the Democratic Peoples Republic of
Korea. We were first delegation of Americans received

in that country since the U.S. war with Russia against that

against the Vietnamese people isnot an isolated war, but
part of the major U.S. policy of:world domination, imperialism

we have as human beings is to hait this move for world
domination by uniting the broad:masses of American people»
