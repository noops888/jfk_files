Most of my operations ware run out of Eurove.

Q Run out of ~-

A Europe. Some were run out of Miami but the big ones

were run out of Europe.

9 Well, in the course of your activities with respect :
i
to Cuba did you have occasion to become familiar with the i
operations of the Miami base? |
A Yes. |
|
Q And the situation in the Cuban community in Miami?
A Yes, sir. |
Q During the nine years you were with ppo's, Cuban
operations, who was ~~ who were the chiefs of the Miami
station?
A 1 think in 1963 Ted Shackley was the Chief and he

was followed by -- I can't think of his name. 1 should know

it. Well, I will come back to that.
Then, the next Chief cf Station was Paul Henze.
Q what years was he Chief?

ul was there about a year and a half. He

A I think
left in 1968 when we reduced the size of the Station. Let's

say Henze was there from 1966 tc 1968. And then Jake Esterline.

He was Chief of Station from 1968 to 1973.

Q Now, what was the formal title of the group to which

you were assigned for the 9-year period?

« . |

: ° Group. |

: “ Q Now, was this a special group within the DDO or was |
5 it attached to one of the area divisions? :

|

8 AB Ne, Following the Bay of Pigs, they created a thing
° . called Task Force W which was headed by Bill Harvey. And
B that -- when Harvey left, he went to ‘Shief of: Station, Rome,. |
8 . and Fitzgerald took over, it became Special ‘Activities Staff.

1c
26 it wasn't attached to anything except ~~ it reported to the

a Deputy Director, Plans.

12 Q And that was Mr. Karamessines?

13 ;

7 A Yes. Well, it was Helms at that time back when it |
1A . :

14 was first created. Helms was DDP at that time. |

ov

Q And Task Force W was created immediately after the

16 Bay of Pigs?
17 A Well, not immediately. I think sometime around --

28 in the Bay of Pigs was in April. “I think this was created in

192 September, something like that, 1961.
|

20 Q And that subsequently became the Special Activities
21. staff?
3 22° aA Special Activities Staff and consequently became the
2 2S Cuban Operations Group. As the Cuban Operations Group it went

A Well, Let's see. I would say that was probably around

1965 because Fitzgerald then became Chief, W.H., and then

later DDP.

Q Now, Mr.Harvey -- do you recall what position Mr.

Harvey held after he left Task Force W? |

A Yes. He was#¢hief of Station, Rome.

Q And is he still with the Agency?

A oh, ne. He retired a long time ago. i
Q Do you know where he lives at the present time? ,
A Frankly, I don't, I have an idea where he lives. i

He went to work for a friend of mine who had a law firm.

Harvey is a lawyer.

Q Indianapolis area?

a Yes, some place around there. It is in the midwest,
Indiana. i
Q What was the role that was assigned to Task Force

/
Ww?
A It was'the overall Cuban operations.
i) Did the Miami -- when was the Miami Station estab~
lished?
A Well, I think they had a forward operatio-s base down

there about 1960 which was small, in. Coral. Gables.

9 This was, then, srior to the Bay of Pigs?
1
A Oh, yes.

7 2 Well, after the Bay of Pigs when Task Force W was
B3 established, did it have sole responsibility for Cuban i
i
operations? |

A Yes. !

: Le A No. The Miami Station was under Task Force W. i

a As Q All right. Would that also be true of the Special

ié Q I understand that. When were Cuban operations termi-
19 nated?
20 4 A At the Station? Let's see. Sternfield went down

there in 1972. it was during fiscal year '72. I think it was

in early 1973. it was a gradual reduction.

2S 5 Q And have those operations been terminated entirely ;
24 | or are they now run out of the Washington area? i

i
Q Have you caused the Agency records with respect to Mri

Sturgis to be assembled in any one location?
A Yes, Ihave custody of them.
Q And what is the volume of that material? i

A As I recall, there are five volumes. Your Committee |

called for them the other day after the article in the paper,

I guess it was last Saturday. They called for them Monday and!

they returned them Monday afternoon.

Q Do you know who examined those files?

A No, I don't. :

Q You indicated a moment ago that Mr. Sturgis contacts

the DCD office in Miami with some frequency, is that correct?

A Well, not great frequency but he does with tidbits

of so-called information.

9 Is this information limited to narcotics, alleged

narcotics traffic?

A Recently it has been.

Q Has Mr. Sturgis been encouraged by the DCD office
‘ i
“in Miami?

A Mr. Sturgis has been told by the DCD office in Miami

to take his information to the Drug Enforcement Agency or the

A No manner.
is fo} Do they have any ~- do they periodically seek to
5 collect information from Mr. Sturgis?
e BR I can't speak to that but the records that we have
? } don't reflect anything like that. Before they would contact
8 : somebody in that context, knowing that there is a 201 file
9 2 on Sturgis, they would have to coordinate with the Latin

American Division before they did anything since we do hoid

' the file.
3 ie) Would you briefly explain what a 201 file is?
x
A A 201 file is a personnel file. It consists of any

information relating to an individual appearing in the press

as a resuit of other agency reporting and that type of thing.

Lé° fa) Personnel or personality file?
7 4 A Personality file, i should say. Excuse me.
ié Q Do you know whether or not there is any connection

or relationship between Eugenio Martinez and Mr. Sturgis?

2

g 20 : A Well, I will say this. Obviously, they do know
al ! each other. They have to know each other from their days
4
: 22 : in Cuba.
3 25) 9 , Do you know whether or not Mr. Sturgis ever partici-
: 24 | pated with Martinez in raids against Cuba?

No. As i recall, we employed Martinez around 1961,

I guess, and he was in our maritime activities. He was a

hit and run,

and exfiltrations and perhaps one or two raids,

boat captain eventually. And he did participate in infiltrations

; Sabotage-type actions against Cuba. Sturgis never engaged in
i

on

any of these things. He never did it for us nor did he ever

om

do it on any of our boats, planes, or ~~ anything that belongs :

to the Agency.

Q When Martinez would run such an operation or captain }

a boat on such an operation, would he be charged with putting

together his own crew?

A No. He had an assigned crew and every boat had a

Case Officer operating either out.of the -- probably out of

the Miami Station. Sometimes I would assume that we did have

some people in the Hey West base. But he, Martinez, would receilve

z
g
3

his instructions and briefings from his Case Officer.

Q So it is likely that he could have brought Sturgis

along on any cf these operations?

a Absolutely unlikely. Oh, the guy whose name I was

trying to think of, Chief of Station, John Dimmer.

foreign subsidiary of an American company cannot trade with

And all the businessmen were well aware of this. Nobody tried
to twist their arm.

Q Other than insuring that these companies refused
to accept orders from Cuba, which I take it you feel they were

you receive from American ‘business? |

firm we approached, and God knows we approached I don't know
how many, that wasn't extremely cooperative. As a matter of
fact, a lot of them, you know, thought we weren't doing enough,

raids. That is about the extent of it.

shortly after the Bay of. Rigs?

A I would -- I think these operations were probably
at their height during the period about 1963 through, say,
1967. The program was terminated in 1968, I think in December
1968, something like that.

Q Why was the program terminated?

wasn't sufficient for what the investment was.

Q You say the agents were getting wrapped up.

A Yes.

Q What do you mean by that?

A When we infiltrated an agent, Cubans would identify
him and capture him.

were conducted by the Agency I trust were approved by the

Forty Committee?

the Forty Committee.

no. These operations had to be planned well in advance because
the tides had te be right, the moon had to be in the proper
phase for communications and this type of thing. And these
things, all these were coordinated with the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, the Navy, the Coast Guard, the FBI. If we were

they may be running three or four a month. No more than that.

of these operations, you know, you would have to have a mother
ship in place and rubber boats and the UDT people to go in to
see if there were mines and this type of thing on the shore
tefore you go. So he may have considered that all these train-
ing exercises were operations but no way did he ever partici-

a successful operation. By that, I mean they didn't do as
much damage as they wanted to because they had to get out
because the Cuban defense came after them. It was that type
of operation that we did.

As I recall, another time we took a team in to burn

all the oil. We did that with a big operation. We made our

own oil, substandard. Additives, I should say, not oil. We

contracted with an American firm for that. And. we shipped

it in through third countries in Europe. It did hit the target.
The thing we wanted to get at was the oil and the

automotive machinery on the island. We knew it was breaking

down and if we could get a complete breakdown we would have

averything at a standstill because in those days the automotive

equipment wasn't coming in that rapidly from Europe because ]

Castro didn't hve the money to buy it and they weren't going ta
extend the credit.
The railroad system was in total disaster. The ©

Soviets had such a long logistics line, supply line, plus i
the fact that the Cubans didn't like the Soviet equipment
because they were used to good American equipment. And these
were principal targets that we were trying to get to.

Q In your experience at the Agency can you think of
any other analogus or similar paramilitary operations run

Q What did Eugenio Martinez do when he wasn't running

A Well, he was down -- this is one of the reasons, as

I told you before, we brought him back and put him under that

In order to repair it, I guess, and get it in the

put it in the warehouse and at that time I guess somebody came

up with a plan to try to widen the rift between -~ there was
i| a vift at that time between the Soviets and Cubans and to
put a harmless substance into the sugar that would make it
acid, sour tasting, and it wouldn't harm the sugar or the

Q And this particular Station, then, was under the
supervision of the group we have been discussing?

A Yes. They were staffed within the Cuban Operations.

Q When did the Western Hemisphere Division resume
responsibilities for the Miami station? |

A Well, when Des. Fitzgerald left as Chief of the
Special Activities Staff and became Chief of the Western
Hemisphere Division, he brought it back into the Division.

Q Is there presently a Miami Station?

A Oh, yes.

Q And how large is it at the present time?

A Well, since we -- I think when we closed down the
Cuban Operations, I don't know how large it is at the present \
time because we are in one of these periods where: we -are
veassigning people, but I think by the end of this fiscal year
there’are going to be between 11 and 14 people.

Q When you joined the group in 1963,. what functions
were being performed by the Miami Station?

A Well, all the classical intelligence functions. I
think I have lined them out at:one time ---collection of
positive intelligence, counterintelligence, paramilitary, this
type of thing. Covert action.

Q This is the list of things you gave me earlier in

the deposition?

Q Which of these activities, if any of them were
actually being conducted within the Cuban community in Miami?

A Well, the collection of foreign positive and probably
counterinteliigence.

Q So the Agency was conducting counterintelligence
activities in the Miami area?

A Yes, sir.

Q Can you give me an example of the kinds of counter-~
intelligence activities that the Agency would be conducting
in that area or was conducting in the area at that time?

A Well, we had a number of joint operations, as I
recall, with the Bureau. We had identified a castro agent that

came in by small boat and when she was -- she came in with a |

i
number of other people. When she hit the -- they had @a recep-
tion center up in Opa Loca that was really a HEW operation.

The Domestic Contact Division office had people out there. and

we did, too. Our people from the DDO were under

cover. When the HEW people did the

preliminary interrogation of these people they had to. fill

out forms, where were you born, this type of thing, biegraphic+
type thing. These forms’ would be passed to our peopie who would
look at the forms and based on previous experience or what
they might have been doing, md they felt that perhaps they
might have some information of intelligence value, they would

reinterrogate them. , .

It was in this manner that this gal came to our
knowledge. We surveilled her for a long time and determined
that obviously she was receiving messages and she was
sending messages. So along with the Bureau we put a surveillante
on her and we obtained a van with DF equipment in it and
indeed, she went on the air in the morning at 5:00 o'clock
or 4:30 or whatever it was, and the direction finder found
it was being beamed toward Cuba, this type of thing, and that
was cen of the examples of the CI activities we were involved
in.

Q Were there many activities of that type?

A Not really. You have got to remember that the
Bureau's Cuban squad was fairly small. JI mean, it was a large }
squad in terms of FBI squads. It had 36 people on it, some-
thing like that, but 36 people trying to follow a couple of
hundred thousand Cubans around, you know, it is pretty nega-
tive. This was one of the reasons that obviously from. --
in those days when we had formed these revolutionary fronts
which were being run by the Cuban exiles, they were reporting
to Case Officers and they would report on things in the
community, of people they thought were suspect and this type
of thing. These leads in turn were then given to the Bureau
and it was to this extent that we got ourselves involved
in CI activity.

Q Would it be fair to say that the involvement in CI

of course, if these people went out and did something on
their own, they could do things we were not aware of, obviously.,
You can't -- you know what they are doing during their eight or
ten hours that they are going to work evervday but once they
leave, we don't know what they are up to.

A No sir, because they were proprietary hires of this
commercial cover.

0. Pid CIA levy anv intelligence requirements upon these |
people other than in their duties -- in their debriefing
capacity, I should sav?

A No. When -- there were -~ obviously there was a

report, it would be sent ffom the AMOTS over. to the Station.

intelligence, of that nature, the Case Officer -- well, not the

“As we phased down the maritime activities, they were made
available to intercept Cuban communications. NSA‘ tasks’ them with
the “frequencies they wanted covered and the Cuban Communications
nets’ they wanted covered, such as the border guards. Another
important one was the sugar network. We had the border guards,
sugar, transportation, maritime. JI think there was an interior

network they covered too, But all electronic intercept coveragel,

Now, since they belong to us we could levy ceratin require
ments on them if we wanted to, which we did very infrequently

because the common interests, -~ we have a common interest in

what NSA has an interest in and unless there were one particular
: 1

operation going that they wanted to cover exactly what the Cuban's
were doing, then we would task our people with that. |

For instance, we knew a Cuban vessel was taking arms into {
Africa and our operators saw the thing leave Havana and then
there was absolute silence. So nobody knew where the thing was.
But we knew arms were being loaded and we finally located the
boat in an African port, I mean the intercept operators did, when
adtycame. back on~thesair. And this is the type of thing. As. i
a matter of fact, they were unloading arms in Algiers. And 200
Cuban troops.

Foreign news people and media, television, radio people.

a Were these people on whom name traces were requested

all’ foreign nationals?

A All foreign nationals.

Q Was there any check made to determine whether
any of them were American citizens?

A we levied on the Secret Service as a requirement
that they have identified these people by nationality before
we would run a name trace. Inadvertently, at one time

they did submit a jist, a rather long list of American citizens

which we promptly sent back to them and told them we coulé

not trace.

q Ang this oractice was followed both in 1968 and
1972?

A That is right. .

Qa And where were these names traced?

A They were traced back here and also in Miami. The

Miami Station did their name check and we did our name check

here. In the case of Cubans, probably the Miami Station had

more information on the Cubans than we would have back here.

3 Sut the names were traced through Agency files?
