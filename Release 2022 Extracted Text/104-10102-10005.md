SUBJECT: : Statement by Benton H. zones concerning.

: his assignment Bolivia in 1967 and-his role
in the capture of Ernesto "Che” GUEVARA
de la Serna

REFERENCE: Memo dated. 29 May 1975

. 1. The undersigned met with Benton H. Mizones, contract
employee, on 2 and 3 June to obtain his story about his
assignment to Bolivia in 1967. This query is.based upon ref
interview, during which Mizores mentioned that he had re- :
transmitted an order from Colonel Joaquin Zenteno Anaya,
Commander of the 8th Division of the Bolivian Army, to a
Bolivian sergeant, which resulted-in the execution of Ernesto
"“Che'’ GUEVARA de la Serna, Cuban leader of the. Ota then
‘operating in Bolivia. .

2. Mizones said that his assignment came about after ‘an ‘
interview held in Miami in June or July of 1967, at which time
he was a..case officer working for the Miami office. He had
been selected for the job interview because of his para-
military training and experience. He was asked if he would
agree to serve with \Gustavo,.Viddolbog a fellow Cuban. He
accepted. He was told that he was to go to Bolivia ‘with

where they would be engaged in training intelligence
teams for the 2nd Ranger Battalion of the Eighth Division of
the. Bolivian Army. He was also told that he and’
would be assigned to the. 2nd Ranger Battalion as advisors
and would be based in the town of Esperanza. While in Miami,
he and (WloLbg. were given briefings about the politicdl and
guerrilla situation in Bolivia, and he was given a refresher
course in communications. Mizones and [(WElsbolbo) were told
that there were strong indications that Guevara was leading
the guerrillas. Among the instructions given them was a clear
one that in the event that the Bolivian Army captured Guevara,
they should do everything possible "to keep him alive."

+3. They were introduced to their future case officer.
in Washington, who was to be in liaison with the Bolivian

“forces in Santa Cruz.

4. Prior to their departure, both .Mizones and {virrelba

were issued false U.S. re-ent ermits in the names of
(SERETIOS and respectively. . These were
received in New rork City just prior to their departure on
30 July for La Paz on a Braniff Airline flight. Their case
officer had preceded them and.met them on 31 July at 7. a.m.
‘at. the La Paz airport. Mizones believes that Bolivian visas’
were stamped in their re-entry permits.

5. The case officer and another American took them to
meet (PRaésatient: to whom they were introduced as
"experts on guerrilla warfare. He issued each a personal card
in which were handwritten his instructions to ali civilian
and military officials that they be given full support. At
ten that morning, they met General Ovando, Commander-in-Chief
of the Bolivian Armed Forces (It wasn't until about a month
later that Mizones met in Santa Cruz.) While in
(Gee no new instructions were issued to them about their
mission. After about a week there,. they were flown to Santa
“Cruz de la Sierra for a.few days and. introduced to Colonel
Joaquin Zenteno Anaya, Commander of the. Eighth Division.
Zenteno arranged for Captain ."Poppie" Shelton, the American
officer in charge of the military mission training the 2nd
Ranger Battalion, to come to Santa Cruz to meet Mizones and
ecotiny They were also introduced to Major Arnaldo Saucedo,
G-2 of the Eighth Division. After 3 or 4 days in Santa Cruz,
Mizones. and went to La Esperanza, where they were
quartered at-the Bolivian officers' compound. In La Esperanza
they met Major Ayiroa, the Commander of the 2nd Ranger Battalion,
and Captain Gari Prado. . 5 : 3 5

6. - Prior to their departure from La Paz, Mizones and
: | were issued Bolivian uniforms and credentials as
Captains in the Bolivian Army. - Nevertheless, they did not
_ receive Bolivian Army insignia. Later, Mizones was given by
Major Saucedo a Bolivian tri-color cap-insignia which he wore
(escarapela). Mizones and (Vitielb@ were issued Smith ahd Wesson
7 double-actioh automatic pistols. During their activitics as in-
» “struc and adviso assumed the role of Bolivian
officers, although they were known as foreign advisors to a
number of Bolivian officers.. (Mizones said that he learned later
that the American Ambassador had prohibited anyone other than
he and 1 from ‘becoming involved in the anti-guerrilla
activities in the field.)

7 7. Despite their apparent status as Bolivian officers,
* Mizones said that they never were given orders by higher-
ranking Bolivian officers (One exception to this rule was the
order which Colonel Zenteno issued to Mizones on the day of
Guevara's exccution, if Mizones story is to be believed.)

8. Mizones was assigned to Santa Cruz and Wii was
assigned to La Esperanza, where the latter conducted most of
the intelligence training. As time went by, Mizones' own
duties gravitated to becoming basically those of an advisor.
»He said that his case officer was aware of and approved of this
development. Among the things which Mizones and MidielSe
attempted to accomplish was the preservation of the lives of:
captured guerrillas, for the collection of intelligence about
the guerrilla's locations, as well as for humanitarian reasons.
Mizones said that he: saved the life of Jose Castillo Chavez,
traveling for that purpose to Vallegrande from Santa Cruz, : -
where he spoke briefly to Castillo at the Nuestra Senora de
Malta Hospital. .At this time Mizones. learned of the intent '
of Colonel Selich of the Rangers, to have the prisoner executed.
-Mizones prevailed on Major Saucédo and General La Fuente to
take his side. The prisoner was flown to Vallegrande where
Mizones covered all medical costs and tarried out a two-week ©
interrogation. The resulting twenty-page interrogation report
provided the Bolivians with a complete concept of the 5
.guerrilla's strategy, which turned out to be the key to
Guevara's capture, according to Mizones. This report was
attributed by the Bolivians to be from their own people.

9. This. important development was followed by an
encounter in late September between a unit led by a Lt. Galindo
and the remnants of the guerrillas. . During this action, a Cuban
lieutenant named Miguel; the Bolivian Coco Peredo; and a
Bolivian physician named Jose Gutierrez Ardaya were killed.
Mizones travelled by jeep to Pucara, where. the bodies were
located, and through the information he had learned from
Castillo, he was able to establish that the men were from
Guevara's forward element. Upon his return to Santa Cruz,
Mizones advised Colonel Zenteno. that the 2nd Ranger Battallion
should be immediately deployed, with the remaining two weeks
of their training cancelled. Zenteno accepted this advice
and the Rangers were moved to Pucara, and the Headquarters of
the Eighth Division were moved to Vallegrande. Mizones
continue¢ in-his advisory role, suggesting ‘areas for troop
deployment as well as the deployment of the intelligence
.teams. On the 8th of October, contact was established with
Guevara's remaining forces. (At this. time Mizones was: in
Vallegrande and {yastebeg in Esperanza.) On the 8th, Major
Saucedo reported r the radio that "the chief" had been
captured. Mizones then flew over the area in a PT-6 carrying
with him a PRC-10 radio with which he was able to communicate
with the Bolivian forces. He then confirmed that Guevara was

. "the chief" who had been captured. He returned to Vallegrande

where he told Col. Zenteno that Guevara had. been wounded and
captured.

.» Mizones, prepared a 100-word message to the

10. That day Major Selich was sent to Higueras to
interrogate the guerrilla prisoners and assembled the .
captured documents. Since Colonel Zenteno was planning to fly
by helicopter to Higueras on the 9th, Mizones asked him on |
the evening of the 8th if le could accompany him to .interrogate
Guevara. Zenteno consulted his staff and agreed. (The a5
helicopter had room only for a pilot and two passengers.) |

Par ai

in code reporting Guevara's capture and asking that an Embassy
_Yrepresentative be sent to the area to prevail upon the 5
Bolivians to spare Guevara's life, since he did not. believe
that he could succeed in doing so. This message was prepared
for the scheduled 10 a.m. transmission of 9 October, and

was not transmitted to the relay point in Asuncion, Paraguay,
until about 10:30 a.m., after Mizones arrived in Higueras

and set up his radia-transmitter an RS-48. .

11. Zenteno, Mizones and the pilot, Nino de Guzman, set
out by helicopter from Vallegrande at 7:15 a.m. on the 9th,

- and arrived in Higueras at about 7:40 a.m. Mizones accompanied
Zenteno and Major Ayiroa when they visited Guevara in the
school room.which was his improvised jail. Guevara would -
net answer Zenteno when spoken to.. He was bound, hand and foot,
and’ had a leg wound. : 5 5 . 5

12. Mizones and Major Selich then reviewed the captured
documents and Mizones obtained permission. from Selich to
photograph all the papers, including Guevara's diary, and also
Selich's permission to retain the original accommodation
addresses found.

13. While Zenteno and all the other Bolivian officers
(with the exception of a Lieutenant Perez) were outside of
the village attending to other military affairs, Mizones -
remained in Higueras as the highest ranking "Bolivian officer".
In this capacity he answered a call received on the military
field telephone and answered as Captain } He was given
the code numbers 500 and 600 as orders which were to be
implemented by command of "higher. authorities". He said that
the connection was not clear and he could not recognize the
voice but it could have been that of Major Saucedo. In any
case, Mizones said that. since it was a line only available
to the military he was confident that it was order re-
transmitted through military channels. He said that he knew
that 500 referred to Guevara, 600 to the word execute and

. 700 to the preservation: of Guevarra's life. These simple
codes had been identified to him previously.


14. Upon Zenteno's return, Mizones told him of thé
message and Zenteno took it as an authentic order and made
no effort to have it confirmed. Mizones asked if Guevara's
life could be preserved since hé had these instructions.
Zenteno replied that his own position would be placed in
jeopardy if he did not comply. Mizones asked him to make -
the attempt anyway. (Mizones believes that Zenteno had
already resigned himself to the inevitability of Guevara's
execution.) . Zenteno: said thathe was in sympathy with Mizones'
wish but that it was not in his power to reverse the order. -
He tld-Mizones that he was well aware of the treatment which
Fidel had meted out to Cubans and told him to execute Guevara
in any manuer which he might choose. Zenteno said that he ~
had’ to leave for Vallegrande at 10:00 a.m. and would send
a helicopter back to pick up Guevara's 'body" at 2 p.m., and
"as a friend", asked that the body be ready. Mizones
reiterated his request that the order be appealed and Zenteno
agreed to make the attempt, and said he would advise if he
were successful.

15. ‘ Failing a counter-manding of the order and as the
senior "Bolivian officer" left in Higueras, Mizones said he
was left with the implementation of the execution. After
Zenteno left, Mizones was able to talk to Guevara, who
identified Mizones either as a Puerto Rican or a Cuban

‘working for U.S. intelligence. He said he made this judgment
on the basis of the questions asked and on Mizones' accent.
While Mizones was with Guevara, shots were fired in adjoining
rooms and Mizones later determined that these involved the
execution of two other prisoners. Recognizing these shots
for what they were, nevertheless, Guevara blanched when
Mizones confirmed that he too would be executed; although
later composing himself.

16. After leaving Guevara, Mizones told a sergeant of
the order to execute Guevara and entrusted the mission to him.
He was told to fire below the head. The ofder was given to
the sergeant at 1:00 p.m. and Mizones heard the shots fired
at Guevara at 1:20 p.m. At 2:00 p.m., the hélicopter returned
to Higueras, A Father Shiller performed the last rites and
Guevara's remains were strapped to one of the helicopter's
skids and Mizones accompanied them to Vallegrande, where
they landed at 2:30 p.m. Mizones said that he lost himself
qu kly in the crowd gathered at the airport, but that
Hdiolbo took charge of the remains and was photographed.

, Mizones said that the title of the photograph, which appeared

in the press, gave an incorrect identification of
the name Mizones used,



17. Mizones said he reported the executions to Major
Saucedo and the Chief of Operations, a Major Gutierrez,
and then was taken back to identify the bodies ofthe three
executed guerrillas. They then crove te Santa Cruz with the
doct nents, films and equi
where Mizones con:

him. Everything which he had been able to retain was turned
in then to be carried by a special courier to Washington.
Mizones then flew back to Santa Cruz where 2 C-130 ordered
by General Porter, CINCSOUTH, was to pick him and!
up for a flight to the Canal Zone. This plane arrived with
a flat tire on the 10th or ith. The U.S. Mission aircraft,
a C-54, was then flown to Santa Cruz and he and Vi
were flown back to La Paz. After overnighting there, another
C-130 carried them to Panama where Mizones was asked to
relate his tory to General Porter. After 2 weeks in Panama,
Mizones and Vill@lbo were documented as GS-16s so that they
could board a over-booked military flight to Charlotte,
South Carolina. After their arrival there, they journeyed
to Miami, where Mizones briefed General Cushman. (Mizones
believes that in both high-level briefings he mentioned his
own personal role in the execution of Guevara.)
