i. The following information about Subject's trip to
Spain and her activities while here was obtained from QUTIMID
and QUDCZE.

2. Supject arrived jn Madrid on 10 February 1970. She
traveled to Barcelona during the week of 25 February aud
returned to Madrid 6 March whereupon she then left for Portugal.
She returned to Madrid on 17 March and waited for Guillerno
RUIZ Perez’ return from the Spanish/Cuban Commercial nego-
tiations in Cuba. Sonia departed Madrid fox Cuba @n 27 March 1970.
It appears that she intended to travel to Vienna, Austria next,
since several cables were sent to Vienna from Madrid advising
Sonia's travel status. During her stay in Spain, Sonia was in
frequent contact with one Jose Agustin GOYTISOLO ,
Spanish writer in Barcelona, telephone 228-4063 (Station traces
are OSBA 02385, i7 February 1965; OSBA 02718, 11 August 1967;
and OSBA 02795, 1 March 1968). She was not known to have been
in contact with any other locals and what little time she had
for diversion she spent with the mission officers and their
wives.

NTINUATION O°
DISPATCH

3. The purpose of Sonia's trip to Madrid was to discuss
the 1970 work plan for the Embassy with the Charge, Guillermo
RUIZ Perez. She aiso talked with the various Embassy officials,
most probably to familiarize herself with their duties ane to
see if they had any problems. She pitched in and helped with
the backlogged work of Orestes BARRED A and Horacio
FUENTES and also helped with the cultural activities.
For instaoce, she sent two cables to MINREX - one regarding
the forwarding cf movie posters for a March exhibit and another
regarding the forwarding of a Cuban stamp exhibition by end
March.

4. In their discussion of the 1970 work plan Sonia told
RUIZ that they were going to plan the February, March, and
April quarter. She showed him "an agenca for the control of
planned and unplanned activities" and the gereral directives of
the plan which included scientific information and political
information, with specific directives (requirements) for Spain.
RUIZ has to prepare for Bavane 2 monthly report, then a quarterly
summary, of the activities accomplished. Based on these
reports the activities of the following quarter wiil be planned.

a. In line with the plan of scientific
tuformation, Sonim and RUIZ discussed the pros
aud cong of a Comite Ctentifico-Tecnico which
is to be set up In Wadrid. RUIZ was of the
opinion that the local (Spanish) Communist
Party would try to infiltrate ti and this
would bring problems to the Embassy. Sonic
poiated out the successes encountered in
Switzerland and Sweden with such a committee
even though at first there were problem
which were later overcome.

b. Sonia showed RUIZ a commercial project
which she planned to take to Portugal and
asked him to read it because it was alno of
interest to the Cuban mission in Spain.

©, Sonia mentioned that the Plan of
informztion was stiil to be completed especially
in the priority categories of Livestock and
economy.

d. They turned next to the topic of
the budget. Sonia said that the budget
for each mission aad to be submitted before
the end of April (every yeur) and no additionsl
expenditures could be submitted for approval
during the courre of the yerr. Spain, Canaca,
and France, however, would be treated individually.
Their special ds, such as acquisition of
more office space, raises in cost of Living
allowances, etc., would be taken into consideration
at any time.



5. During their various discussions RUIZ aired his
complaint pbout the Visa Departeent in Havana saying that
the department was practically worthless and that last year
7€ cables regarding visas remained unanswered. Senia
defended the Ministry saying tnat 4t had » Lot of work to
do, but RUIZ replied that they wanted to work only & ours

a day. They algo discussed the schularship situation. it
seems thet during an interview between PRIETO (probably
Jose PRIKTO Renitez, Director of Foreign Relations of
the DAP) and the Minister of Public Works, PRIETO was asked
to provide a list of scholership candidates to be considered
and he had none. fonia sentioned that in Belgium they also
lost four scholarstipe becaume of this same reason.

6. According to QUTIMID Sonia GOMEZ Aragon is
warried to one Miguel (LNU) and bas a daughter named I}iaua.
Sonia's mother is still living aithough appeared to be very
ill at the time Sonia left for her trip to Madrid because
Sonis cabled at least twice to Havana inquiring about the
stetus of her wother's heeith. (TYLOTE reported that Sonia's
home phone number in Havana is 7-4263.) Perhaps Headquarters
can determine the full name of her husband by checking the
reverse telephone listings Sonia is attractive, intelligent,
sertious-ainced and reserved. The last time she visited Spain
she stayed with Vers 5 GO RKOPOWS KI and was on the same
type of aission ac the present one ~ to discuss the Madrid
Emb: y's work plan. She also visited the Barcelona Coneulate
and the Cuban kubassy in Lisbon.

as blue and green), wears glasses. No
visible identifying marks. Well dressed.

PERSONALITY: Perhaps a relative's description of RUIZ
sums up his personality - "a man of many
moods." He has variously been described
as intelligent, mentally alert, competent,
hardworking, and respected by his subordinates.
Pleasant, easy going, nervous, quick-tempered,
brusque but sincere, opinionated, strong-minded
idealistic, self-confident. Has’ basic
emotional instability, gives impression
of being insecure in his position. At times
sarcastic, indifferent, egotistical, cynical,
serious, ungrateful and cold, who,
paradoxically, appears friendly to some people.
Outspoken, compulsive talker, articulate,
limited vocabulary, swears 2 good deal



Orestes Guillermo RUIZ Perez,

EDUCATION:

Me can turn on considerable
charm, where motivated. In
contrast to his pleasant public
image and acceptable language,
private conversation is vulgar,
swears continually and flies into
rages

Likes good living and spends money
where it shows. “Avid reader, keeps
abreast of world events, shows
willingness to accept whatever he
deems to be good or useful from

the outside world. Concerned with

the image and prestige of Cuba in
Spain. Emotionally committed to

an ideal. An AMEDIT study summed

RUIZ up as a realist. He speaks
English and French, His wife, a
teacher, always worked before going

to Spain, and there works as a
secretary and bookkeeper at the
Embassy on an informal basis. Appears
intelligent, competent, outspoken

but solicitious and affectionate with
her husband; interested in, and
encourages him in his work. Appears to
support the regime, but not a fanatic.
RUIZ is the dominant personality of the
two.

One reference states that he went to
work at age 14, which suggests lack of
formal education,

In 1960 as an employee of the Ministry
of the Tre. sury, selected to attend

a statisti course offered by CEPAL,
which lasted two years.

One relative reported he completed
elementary education at "Hermanos
Maristas" school in Havana: did not
know whether he attended high school,
but said in early days of the Castro
regime attended the University of



Orestes Guillermo RUIZ Perez

PREVIOUS POSITIONS:

Havana.

Another relative said his
primary and secondary education

was received in private institutions,
and that he has a degree in "political
economics" from the University of
Havana,

He is well versed in world affairs
and has an understanding of
international trade.

Vice Minister, MINCEX, 1964-1967.

Commercial Counselor, Cuban Embassy,
Mexico City. Although he was
accredited to that position in
December 1963, travel indicates he
was in Mexico from August 1963 to
May-1964. Other references indicate
he was in that position in September
1963.

Ministry of the Treasury. In April
1962 he was Chief of the Department
of Construction Expenses Studies,
Office of Financial Statistics of
that ministry. He was with the
ministry as early as 1960, when he
was selected to attend the statistics
course,

During the Batista regime he was in
exile. Came to the U.S, sometime in
the 1950's and apparently remained for
some time before he left in February
1957, when, according to some reports
he entered Cuba clandestinely. Aliso
reported to have been in exile in
Mexico,

LNYUMA records show he came to U.S.
on 8 November 1956 to see his brother,
left 17 November for the Dominican
Republic where he received five months
military training. Returned to the

POLITICAL
ATTITUDE;

April 1957, overstayed
his time, and on 11 February 1958
was ordered deported; claimed he
would be killed if he returned to
Cuba and did not show for deportation.
Subsequent investigation showed he
was in Cuba as of 2 March

A momber of the Cuban Communist
Party, admitted on the recommendation
of Armando HART Dayalos, Secretary *
of Organization, Although he has
been described as a militant Communist,
a convinced supporter of the Castro
regime and a fanatic Fidelista, there
is evidence to dispute nis image.

An analysis of availabie information
indicates that he is not a convinced
Marxist, he cannot accept Party
discipline, and that his character

is basically incompatible with the
systen he serves.

His father is reported to be an old-
guard Communist and a leader of

the barber's union. A brother
reported to Le a member of DSE in 1946,

He expressed dissatisfaction with
his position as a diplomat, feels
his talonts are wasted and would like
a position in commerce or industry,
where he considers he could better
serve the revolution. Has criticized
the burcaucracy and inefficiency in
the government in Havana,

He has said that many Cuban diplomats
want to stay out of Cuba, but it
seemed to him that the Cuban government
wanted to kecp him (RUIZ) out of the
way (i.e., outside Cuba). That LEON
had appointed him, supported him, and
they are good friends, but that he
(RUIZ) decs not like to work with a
nan who one does not get to know,

nor to know what he is thinking. He
said he felt as if he were in Miami,
