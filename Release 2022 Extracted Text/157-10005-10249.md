Mr. Smothers. Mr. Secretary, we see there a series of
lettered subparagraphs setting out alternatives that the CIA
has offered up as potential areas to be pursued, and then
some handwritten notes opposite each paragraph apparently in-
dicating approval or disapproval of the proposed faction.

The Chairman. Is this memorandum a:CIA memorandum?

Mr. Smothers. It is for the Chief of the Western Hemi-
sphere Division.

Senator Tower. But who signed off on it? That sig-

nature is obscured. |
Mr. Smothers. The author of this working paper is

unknown. It appears to be -- we have an acting chief -- VY) (A-

::Mr. Dennin. The chief at that time was {ff

though it is not established, people have said that they
believed that it was Mr. Esterline who was the acting chief
at that date.

Mr. Smothers. Looking at that memorandum and coming
down to subparagraph C under paragraph 1 of the memorandum, we
see the statement:

"To what extent will the U.S. Government participate
in the overthrow of Trujillo".

And then in subparagraph C:

“Would ..it'. provide a small number of sniper rifles
or other devices for the removal of key Trujillo people from

the scene?"

Mr. Schwarz. Now if I might put this document in
chronological context for the Committee, the persons in Santo
Domingo are at this point seeking permission to pass machine
guns to the dissidents who they know are seeking those machine
guns in order to assassinate Trujillo, and there is a block
put on this shipment -- rather, to the passage of them; they
had already been shipped to the Dominican Republic -- and a
draft cable was prepared authorizing the passage and then it
was said, no, we've got to go check with State to determine
whether the machine guns should be passed.

And this memorandum reflects the checking with State, he
apparently came to see Mr. Berle..

Further, as a matter of information, thegyieyeabenty who (t
was referred to in here, did know that other assassination
weapons had been passed to the dissidents.

Now given that background, I will read the memorandum
into the record and I will have one question for the witness. (i

Bis. Barbers) of CIA came in. A local group in the
Dominican government wishes to overthrow Trujillo; wishes arms
for that purpose.

"On cross-examination it developed that the real plan was
to assassinate Trujillo and they wanted guns for that purpose.

"I told him I could not care less for Trujillo and that

wanted to know what the policy should be.

this was the general sentiment. But we did not wish to have

anything to do with any assassination plots, anywhere, anytime.
Wsaid he felt the same way."

Now, Mr. Secretary, in the way which your understanding wag
of the expected degree of candor between CIA and the State
Department, would it be your expectation that if Qiogyeapest
had known that other weapons had been passed to the same
dissidents and they had stated that they intended to use those

other weapons to assassinate Mr. Trujillo, that xi

should have passed that information on to Mr. Berle?

Mr. Rusk. Under those circumstances, I would think the
answer is yes.

I mean, one thing I'm sure of, Mr. Schwarz, and that is
Mr. Berle did not write this memorandum on May 3rd, 1961 in
preparation for a Senate investigation in 1975.

Mr. Schwarz. You believe it to reflect accurately what
transpired?

Mr. Rusk. I have no douht. It was sent to Mr. Coerr, Mr.
Owen, Mr. Devine, in the Department of State, and I've known
Mr. Berle for quite a long time and I would have predicted this
would have been his reaction.

Senator Mathias. Mr. Chairman, just at this point --

The Chairman. Senator Mathias.

Senator Mathias. It would be interesting to get the
Secretary's reflection that if that is the case, as Mr. Berle's

Memorandum indicates and as the Secretary said, how do you in
