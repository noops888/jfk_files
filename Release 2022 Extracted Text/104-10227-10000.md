IDENTIFICATION:

0, Yurily Ivanovich, a Soviet
fficer who defceted -j 1964 and
was subsequent)y involuntarily con-
fined in the U.S. by the Agency for

t a period of approximately three years,

BACKGROUND 3 NOSENKO fi contacted Agency per-
Ee sonnel in Switzerland in June 1962
| . and subsequently defected in January
\ . : + 1964. | NOSENKO was brought to the Wf
: and ter a period of relative freedom
he involuntarily confined in
April 1964, From April 1964: to
August 1965, he was confined at an
Agency controlled site in Clinton,
Maryland. From August 1968 to
October 1967. NOSENKO was confined
at Virginia. In October
1967, ne was returned to the Washington
area, given increasing amounts of
freedom until he was given total free-
dom if April 1969. NOS! NKO b
U.S. citizen in April 1974,
employed by the Agency. as a
consultant in March 1969 and continues
under contract to date. lis Present ©
sdlary is $23,500 per year,

APPROVAL : (1) The legal basis to confine NOSE:
. against his will was disc ed by

Mr. Richard Helms, Db/P, and others with
the Deputy Attorney General on 2 April
1964 (Tab 1). On 3 April 1964, the
Agency General Counsel, Mr. Lawrence
Houston, advised the Director of Security
by memorandum that such confinement was
proper (Tab 2).

(2) There are a series of letters from
the DDCI, DCI and others to various
agencies, including the Department of
Justice and the White House, covering
the period 1964 to 1969, evidencing
awareness of these agencies of the
NOSENKO affair (Tab 3),

(3) The conditions of NOSENKO's confine-
Ment were established by the Office of
Security (Tabs 4 & 5).


RESULTS 3 Ky memorandum dated 2 October 1908,
the Director of Security forwarded
two reports to the DUCE summarizing
the results of the NOSENKO case to
that date. The reports are voluminous.
One was prepared by the Office of
Security and the other by the FBI
Both reports conclude that-NOSENKO
> was a bona fide defector. A draft
ce memorandum attached to this file,
dated 21 October 1968 and prepared
by the CI Staff, raisés question
regarding NOSENKO's bona fides
and challenges the above two reports.

TERMINATION : NOSENKO continues under contract to
the Agency. He is brought to Washington
periodically to consult on matters i
germane .to his background and experience.
Various reports are available in the i
files of the Office of Security which
detail financial aspects of this case.
No final accounting has been made since
the project continues.

COMMENTS 3 - (1) While the Office of Security files

7 do document the rationale for the original
confinement of NOSENKO, they do not
document the rationale for his continued
confinement over so long a period of time,
A memorandum dated S August 1969 states
that various congres staff officers
were briefed on NOSENKO and states that
concern for his safety, as well as con-
cern regarding his bona fides, prompted
the prolonged confinement. (See Tab 6)

(2) Office of Security files document
a period in 1969 during which a mail
cover was placed on NOSENKO.

(3) During the above period, NOSENKO

was allowed a pleasure trip to Florida.

During this trip, Agency personnel, with

apparent Headquarters approval, obtained H
the services of prostitutes. This

apparently occurred on at least two :
occasions.

MEMORANDUN FOR RECORD

SusJEcT: Discussion with Deputy Attorney. i fect
General on Nosenko Case :

1, Hr elas, Mr. Houston and Nr. Murphy met with
the Deputy Attorney Gonoral and wesbers of his staff to
discuss subject case, Present froa Mr, Katzenbach's
staff were Messrs. Foley, Yeugley aad Reis.

2. Hr. Helms explained’ the Nosenko case briefly

and indicated that shortly we would be faced with what

we at least considered to be two problens on which we
would like the advice of the Departaent of Justice.

First, wo would secon feel coapelled to begin hostile
interrogation of Nosenke in order to arrive at the truth
with respect to his mission for the KG3 and ve wondered
what the legal position would be in circusstances in
which we detained Nosenko against his will for this pur-
pose. Second, we would have to be ready after detorsin- .
ing ‘that we could obtain no additional inforaation fros ©
Nosenko to deport. hin... We had thought of taking hin to
Germany and transferring him to Soviet custody in Borlin *. |:
where this has been done a number of tiacs in the past.

3. There was soso discussion of whether deportation

to another country sight be a consideration, Nr. Helas :

explained we would probably face publicity proble pF eseeatatecy
deporting to a third country of the kind we would en= I
counter if hé wero free in the U. S. Nr. Helms noted

there were many items of information which we and the

FBI realize are of no significance because of the file

but which an unscrupulous newspaper san
eate Bischiof, This aspect was then dropped
and it was the consensus that 3erlin was probably the best

place,

4. The question of the basis for detention was again
raised and related by Mr. Foloy to the conditions under
-which Nosenko is in this country. We is here as an "oxe
“clusion and parole case" which means he bas not been
adaitted and has been parolad to the Agency which is
Tesponsible for hin while ho is in this country. . This



an 7 ee
it: RES ¢

e2e-

parole can be interproted to moan parole to a specific
locale which would provide sone Justification for our.
detaining hia for questioning. It was then pointed out,
however, that if he said ha wished to leave the country
to return ta. the. Soviet Union, technically we would not
be able’ to detain hin further. In this event, we would
bez with) ‘need to ‘deport him quickly and quietly
and for this purpose the ianigration warrant of arrest
and deportation: was Probably the best instrusent, —

Se Urs Katzenbach asked ur, Foley to check into
this and Mr. Foley will in turn contact Mr. Houston.
Mr, Houston will in turn discuss the problom with CIA
Office of ety officials to get the background of
their Ilaison with the INS on these matters.

6. Mr. Holes thanked Mr. Xatzenbach for his assistance
and wo departed amid some jovial banter with Tespect to
"The. Spy Who Caze in From the Cold" about what we expected
ee pepper to him when he started to climb aver that “wall”

hostile penetration in Great Britain, Whero appropriate, his information

has been shared with the FBI, other u. S. Government agencies and .

Question #3 - Did McCone or Raborn have any information on this:

What? i

Answer:

Office of Security records contain only limited information
in regard to this question. The SH Division (then SR) was the
responsible office for the confinement of Noscnko until late
October-1967 when total -responsibility was transferred to the
Office. of Security by the DCI. It is presumed that the DCI was
at least gencrally aware of the confinement of Nosenko and the
conditions of. confinement, but any definite statement must be

based on SE records.

Question #4 - Where is Nosenko working now?

Answer:

Nosenko is currently employed at his personally owned
residence in North Carolina. We is engaged in research and
analytical work based on his previous knowledge of the KGB
and other Soviet matters. He is in the Washington, D. C. area
for several days approximately every six weeks for direct
interviews by the FBI and Office of Security personnel.

Question #5 - Is he working for CIA?

Nosenko has been employed by the Agency on a‘-full-time
contractual basis since 1 March 1969. The original contract
has been periodically amended to reflect additional remuneration,
primarily to compensate for cost of living increases. In late
1972, Nosenko was compensated by mutual agreement for salary
not received during the 1 April 1964 to 1 March 1969. In addition, ;
on 12 July 1973 Nosenko signed an acknowledgement and release
of the United States.Government and the Central Intelligence
Agency from any claims prior to that date.

Question #6 - What is his legal status?

Answer:

Nosenko was naturalized as a United States citizen in
April 1974,

SEGREL,

MEMORANDUM FOR: The Inspector General

“SUBJECT : The Nosenko Case

Attached please find a summary of a document written in
1967 to’the General Counsel outlining the Nosenko case and
explaining to him actions which had becn taken with regard to
Nosenko. . As noted in the first par: ‘aph, in October 1967
Nosenko took up residence in the W ington area and was
advised that, should he wish to leave the apartment for any
_location whatsoever, he was free to so do. In other words,
from that date, Nosenko was essentially a totally free man.
“That he chose not to flee in any way may be indicative of his
attitude toward the manner in which he was handled prior to
October 1967. [

While one can criticize the fact that Noscnko was kept
incommunicado for approximately three years, and therefore
presumably denied full civil rights, the attached document
does indicate, we believe, that the Agency was on the horns
of a dilemna in this regard. There were legitimate doubts
about, Hosenko's bona fides and concern that he was a Soviet
plant. There. was no Country.to which he could be deported
save the Soviet Union, and Nosenko himself refused to return
there. Yet, in the United States, save when isolated from
society, he was considered to be a continuing threat to
national security.

Recognizing that only legal experts can judge defini-
tively the merits of the case, it seems to the writer that
the Agency had. no choice but to hold Nosenko incommunicado
pending resolution of his bona fides, He was admitted to
the United States under the provisions of Section 212 (d) (S$)
of the Immigration and Nationality Act, namely as a parolee
to the Agency. As a parolee, Nosenko de facto from the date
of his entry to the United States did not enjoy the full civil
rights of the normal citizen, He was a ward of the Agency, in
a sense, and the Agency was ultimately responsible for his

Nosenko voluntarily established contact with CIA repre-

offered to sell counterintelligence information. This offer

in Geneva. He then returned to the USSR. He cane to Geneva
again in January 1964 as the security officer for the Soviet
disarmament delegation, After a number of mectings with his
CIA handlers “he defected on 4 February 1964 and was secretly
taken to Frankfurt, Germany, Crossing the Swiss-German’ border
on the night of 4/5 February with alias U.S, Arny identity
documents.. In Geneva and again upon arrival in Frankfurt,
Nosenko wrote out’ an asylum request, requesting political
asylum from the U.S. Government.

Because serious doubts about Nosenko's bona fides had
ariscn on the basis of the information he had provided both
in 1962 and in the meetings in Geneva in 1964, it was orig-
inally planned to do a detailed bona fides debriefing and
assessment in Germany before making any decision about moving
Nosenko to the United States. However, unprecedented a on
by the Soviet. Government in Yespect_to the defection of one

of its citizens forced a change of plans. On 9 February,

unidentified Soviet sources in Geneva leaked the news to the
press that Nosenko, described as an “expert attached to the
Soviet Delegation to the Disarmament Conference" had dis-

appeared, and that it was presumed that he had defected,

Because of mounting pressure ‘from the press, which included
much speculation that Noscnko was a high level scientist or
disarmament expert, it was decided that the State Department
would make a brief announcement acknowledging Nosenko's
request for asylum in the U.S. and identifying him'as a
member of the KGB. ‘This was done on 10 February. On 11 Feb-
ruary, the Soviet Government delivered a note to.the American
Embassy in Moscow asking, how Nosenko left Switzerland and
requesting an immediate interview with him and his release.
On 12 February, Soviet Ambassador to the Disarmament Confer-
ence TSARAPKIN held a press conference in Geneva in which he
accused-the Swiss Government of failure to cooperate in
locating Nosenko. Although the Swiss categorically rejected
these charges, the American Anbassador to Switzerland recom-
mended that Swiss authorities be allowed to interview Nosenko
to convince themselves that Nosenko had left Switzerland of
his own free will. ,

On 12 February 1964, on the instructions of the Director,
Nosenko was brought to the United States. He travelled by
commercial air, again using alias U.S. Army identification,
and was admitted to the country. at New York City (in true
name) on parole under the provisions of Section 212 (d) (5)

of the Immigration and Nationality Act.

and Soviet

On 13 February, representatives of the Swi
Embassies in Washington advised the State Departient that
they desired interviews with Nosenko. Gn 13, February, ‘in

Moscow, Sovict Foreign Minister GROMYKO called -in Ambassador

KOHLER and protested, “impermissable activities” on the part

of the,U.S. in Nosenko's case, Soviet press spokesmen took
an even harder line to Western correspondents, and accused
the U.S. of kidnapping Nosenko. On the afternoon of 14 Sep-
tember, at two Separate interviews, he spoke first to Swiss z
Embassy and then to Soviet Embassy representatives. At
these interviews, which were also attended by State Department
and INS officials, Nosenko confirmed that he left Switzerland
of his own free will to seek asylum in the U.S. In addition,
he replied to questions of the Sovict Embassy representative
to the effect that he was renouncing his Soviet citizenship.
On the evening of 14 February, the.U.S. State Department made.
a brief formal reply to the Soviet Protest, then issued a
brief statement to the press noting that the interviews had
been held and that Nosenko had confirmed his desire to remain
in this country,

From the time of his arrival to 4 April 1964, Nosenko
was housed in the Washington. area, During this period, reg-

ular systematic debriefing was: commenced, and Nosenko was

made available to representatives of the FBI for debriefing
on matters affecting their responsibilities. Although allowed
out for evening and week-end excursions, Nosenko was -at all
times accompanied by O/S personnel. In addition, he took a
two-week vacation to Hawaii, again accompanied by cuso offi-
cers and security guards. Evidence continued to none that
he was a KGB plant, and at the sume time it became obvious
that it would be impossible to proceed further, to. resolve
the many suspicious points and contradictions that had arisen
without changing the conditions in which he was being held.
Nosenko was growing increasingly uncooperative, especially -
when sensitive areas were touched upon, and constantly pressed’
for the legalization of his status in the U.S. and the issuance
of an alien registration card. .At the same timc, Nosonko's
heavy drinking and other unruly personal habits were causing
increasing difficulties to the security personnel charged with
keeping him under control and out of trouble at all times in
accordance with Agency local responsibility. It was clear
that it was only a matter of time before he created a public
scandal, More importantly, he was in a position. to communi-

established contact with CIA, subscquently defected on KGB
instructions, and that he came to the United States on a
deception mission. The implications of this mission had a” ~
grave and “direct/bearing on U.S. national security. Although
our findings were supported by the results of two polygraph
examinations, the nature of the evidence was inadmissable in
acourt of law. In any case, it is clear that Nosenko had
not been in a position to perform any overt act of ‘transgres-
sion of U.S. espionage laws since 4 April 1964 whéh he was

placed ina restricted area and deprived of any conceivable

means of communication with the KGB.
Nosenko did not admit that he defected on KGB orders

or that he came to the U.S. on a KGB mission, He has admitted,

however, that he made numerous lies about-his personal history
and about the details of his KGB service to U.S. officials,
both before and after arriving in the United States.

to have tie time to analyze and resolve this case, and to

plan and execute ‘appropriate countermeasures, it was essential
that we attempt to keep the KGB from learning of our awareness
of Nosenko's true status. Consequently, detailed knowledge
of ‘the depth and scope of our suspicions about Nosenko, and
the implications thereof, was restricted tu a very few people
in the Agency and the intelligence community. Nonetheless,
we did advise key policy echelons. and principals in the intel-
ligence community, even though this carried the inevitable

risk of leakage.

Soviet Inspired Inquiries

In 1966 there were several indications that the Soviets
were making a serious effort'to find out what happened to
Nosenko and to force him to the surface. The most blatant
and unusual of these was the ‘approach by a Soviet journalist,
Yuriy KOROLEV (a known KGB agent), to the French magazine
Paris Match with an offerto provide photographs and materials
for an exclusive story of Nosenko and his family. According
to Korolev, Nosenko's wife was considering an approach to an

international juridicial organization in an effort to obtain

compensation from Nosenko for’ damages caused by his abandon-
ment of her and her children.) In responding to this approach

we quoted a statement, purporting to be fror Nosenko himself,

i

to the effect that Nosenko considers this approach to repre-
sent blatant and crucl manipulation of his family by the KGB
and that he will not lend himself to the scheme by agreeing
to an interview or in any other way.
Nosenko's Status
To recapitulate, Nosenko entered the United States on
12 February 1964 on parole to the Agency under the provisions
of Section 212 (d) (5) of the Immigration and Nationality
Act. Parole résponsibility is delegated to the Agency by
the Attorney General under the terms of an agreement executed
by the Attorney General and the [7I on 10 February. 1955,
which states:
“After parole of such aliens, the Central Intel- :
ligence Agency will assume responsibility for
care, supervison and control of a kind and
degree it believes consistent with the internal
security needs of the United States during con-
tinuance of their parole status."
In accordance with our understanding of this agreement, and
because we had reason to believe that Nosenko was a conscious
and willing agent of a hostile intelligence service, we
ensured that he was under our direct observation and control

at all times from the moment of his arrival in the United

States, From 12 February to 4 April 1964 it was possible to
keep Nosenko at a location where he could enjoy a certain
amount of movement and of contact with the outside world.
After 4 April 1964, for reasons explained above, it was
necessary to keep him incommunicado at.a location which is
known to noone outside’ of the Agency (and to very few within
it). Authorization for Nosenko to remain in this country
under the Special Agreement Procedures was periodically
extended by the Immigration and Naturalization Service.

Although his freedom of movement had been severely
restricted, Nosenko was not maltreated and. he made no com-
Plaint about his treatment. “On the contrary, we had several
written statements from him in which he stated that our.
handling of him was justified and even bencficial.
Disposal

From the time that Nosenko was brought to this country
we thought about the possibility of his eventual deportation
asa contingency measure, In carly 1964, we thought that it
might be possible to mitigate the political and propaganda
drawbacks of a forced deportation by announcing that Nosenko
has confessed his true KGB role. With the Passage of tame,
however, and in view of our much firmer conclusions about his

real role and mission and our clearer understanding of what

cat practical problems

this implied, it was apparent that g
stood in the way of his deportation to cither the USSR or a
third country.

USSR: Nosenko has categorically stated on numerous
occasions that.he will never contemplate return to the USSR,
and, although we suspect that. he might secretly welcome such
a move, we would expect him to act out his part to the end
with loud protests that he was being shipped to his death,
etc. When the possibility of expulsion was discussed with
Department of State officials in 1964, both the Secretary of
State and Ambassador Thompson expressed their concern for
the adverse effect this might have on other potential defec-
tors. Forcible repatriation of political refugees fs against
long established U.S. policy, and would be certain to arouse
violent reaction from ethnic minority groups in the United
States. Under these circumstances an alleged "confession"
by Nosenko would have come under very close scrutiny, dnd
might have backfired very badly, Another point that had to
be considered was the possibility that the Soviets, again
playing their part, might have refused to accept Noscnko on
the grounds that he has renounced his Soviet citizenship.

Third Country: Although we believed it likely that

Nosenko would accede to deportation to a third country,

Forwarded herewith is a 31 December 1974 memorandum
Acting Director of Security on subject activities. The

‘Questions that occur to us in reading the attached, are:

PARAGON :

We should spell out what is meant by the >
statement that the FBI "deferred further coveragé
to the Office of Security," how it was expressed and
what form it took,

os

The taping of two conversations does not seem
to constitute "electronic surveillance" in the usual
Sense, It certainly is not (trespatory surveillance,
A little more detail on the equipment will be wanted,

NOSENKO

We will go to the DDO for any record of DCI
knowledge, and report such information as we get.

AELADLE :

We will want to verify DDCI's approval of entry,

A
ill
meray



CELOTEX 1

— We will want more detail on the actual _
surveillance, including possible higher approval.

This is responsive to the DCI's request for
newspaper articles that led to the surveillance.

j
5 CELOTEX II

Questions similar to CELOTEX L

stories for display,
DCL.wish to use it.

No recorded (in CIA) formal approval by
Attorney General. It may be that Justice will

have a copy.

Does this raise a question of survéillance*
of congressmen if one is contacted by.someone *

1. Reference is made to Mr. Ainslie's verbal request

for a review of Office of Security files in an effort to

Provide information pertinent to a case mentioned on page #
170 of the: Report to the President by the Commission on CIA
activities within the United States.

2, The case in question from page 170 of the Commission
Report is quoted as follows: "In one other case, a defector’ .

employee was later terminated by the DCI. It is not known
whether the following case is identical to the referenced
case on page 170 of the Commission Report, but the facts
appear to be quite similar,

4. Information developed by this Office of possible in-
terest to the Inspector General, pertains to one John Torpats,
an ex-CIA cinployee, and one Eduard Oun, an Estonian defector.

$.- Torpats was born in 1898 in Estonia, and became a
naturalized U.S. citizen in 1926. Torpats was employed by
CIA in February 1949 and was terminated 30 January 1961. . The
file information reflected that in July 1956, Torpats was found
guilty of mistreatment of an alien by a Special Inquiry Board

Oun during interrogations directed by Torpats. The charges
ui of physical abuse included the striking of Oun with the fist;

the body, the scrubbing of Oun's body with a brush,

Nonenko: In England I was for'ten and fifteen ‘days .-. 3-9 :

Note: During the interrogation of Nosenko in 1964, he denied that he ever
said that he was in the United States.

2. You stated previously that while traveling to England. and Cuba, you were

documented as Nikolayev, Under what cover did you travel to those countries?

What was your Legend-Biography?
Note: Any KGB officer going abroad under another name and under
cover prepares a Segend-Biography to’cover up his real
identity, If Nosenko travelled as Nikolayev, then his legend

omitted "the fact" that he was a son of a Minister because
there was no Minister of Shipbuilding Industry with the name

of Nikolayev, etc,, etc.)

‘ I, Sovict visas and other regulations for tour’

& 1, Didn't you know or remember how-Oswald's viva ‘was processed and
from what country Oswaid entered the USSR? Ie it possible thathe 2
entered the USSR on a “podvisnaya" visa? F

UY 2. You previously said that you saw Oswald's visa application, but you could
not say from what couatey Oswald came to the USSR. In your opinion, is

1. . "qe possible that Oswald received hie visa application in somé other Europedn i

country, then went to Finland and through Finland entered the USSR without :

j contacting the Soviet cozsulate in Helsinki? Did you hear any talk about the

! possibility that is described above?’ If so, when did you hear it and from

; whom?

: UL 3+ On 3 July 1964 you stated that you have seen Oswald's anketa (visa

: application), Do you remember what was in that anketa? Did you read
: the anketa? What did you mean that you saw the anketa? Was it in the

name Lee Harvey Oswald, or was there another name? Did you see the

name of the person who signed the anketa?



40 Be you tase ang information lo the effect that Oawatd might aot have

cuine to the Soviet consulate or te the Soviet Finharay in Helainkt to

! in Switzerland.or. Sweden,

in his viow? Could he have qlta

then nave come to sfetai

and then lo Moscow?

na train to Leningrad

in Helsinki,

+ 5. According to your previous information, “any touriet = he buy a tour

and then comen to Moscow, "

to the Soviet Union, makes out the anket

In what country did Ouwald buy a tour to the USSR? In what country did

Oswald fill in the anketa? If the anketa goes to Moscow, to what office

in Moscow does it gu? To MID, KGB? Ie It possible that all the data on
Oswald from his anketa was sent to Méscow by a cable? “Did you sae and
‘read Oswald's anketa or a telegram that Oswald Is coming to Moscow?

If you did not read the Aanketa, who among the KGB officers of the Second

Chief Directorate or the First Chief Directorate read the anketa or had

access to it? Who would logically have access to the anketa?

6. According to your previous information, any person who wants to visit the

USSR has to buy a tour ina forvign tourist firm in hia home country or any
tay in

other country, and the tourlat firm will make arrangements for hie

the USSR. It is understood that he must fill in the anketa, and in addition to

the general questions, the common tourist should make requests for the

cities he intends to visit and for the accommodations he wants. The tourist

would know in advance when he receives -hie visa his date of arrival in
- a

Moscow, in what hotel -he is going to stay, and what kind of accommodations ~ _ oe

he would be given, The question, then, is do you know when Intourlst

received Oswald's request and application and when it answered him that

his demands are met and that he is welcome in Moscow?

From your knowledge, when Oswald arrived in Moscow, was he handled by

4 7,
the Intourist Agency or by Sputnik, the Youth Tourist Bureau of the ussR,

or by the Central Council for Touriam of the Soviet Trade Unions? *

Note: The Centrat Council for Tourivm of the’ Soviet Trade Unions organizes
exchanges of touriats between trade unions of the USSR and other
countries, Sputnik was organized in June 1958 for the exchange of
of tourists (students and other youths),

What iv the procedare after a tourist applies for a Soviet vina” Do you
know at what tourlat agency or in what foreign country Oswald applied ,_
for a visu to the USSR or bought a tour te the USSR? Who was the
Suviet Intourist representative in that country vee took Oswald's visa

ion to the Suviet Embassy?

appli

You stated previously that Oswald wan not conaidered a defector, If he
wan nota defector, then what was he?

If the KGB did not consider Oswald to be a defector, then it is
possible that Oswald was known to the KGB long before his arrival

in the USSR as a tourist and Oswald was assured that when he
arrived in the USSR he would be given Sovict citizenship or at.
least a permanent residence permit, Although he would be a defector
anyway, St could be that Oswald did not like the word defector

and the KGB decided not to call him a defector but, Ict us say, a
volunteer, The Soviet-Constitution states that the USSR grants the
right of asylum to all foreign citizens "utp are persecuted for
safeguarding the interests of the working clays or who are persecuted
for scientific activities, for national-liberation struggle." (Article
129 of the USSR Constitution of 1936.)

Not

You stated previously that "since about 1960, every Soviet ambassador

can give a visa in three to five days. If s0, what was so special for the

Soviet government that the ambassador would be personally involved in

issuing a visa to Oswald?

Note: “It is known that tn 1957. the Soviet government adopted some measures
to improve travel for foroign tourists in the USSR, They mostly
concerned currency'exchange. The 1957 regulations said nothing
about visas, Nosenke should be questioned about the 1957 decision
of the Soviet government to determine if he iy not mistaking the 1957
decision with that of 1960, :

You stated previously that since about 1960, every Soviet ambassador
can give visas. in from throe to five daya, The available information
published by the Soviets unmistakenly states that a visa cannot be obtained

in less than'seven days (in some cases it takes five to seven days). Following

are excerpts from a book entitled Moscow, A Tourists Companion, published
in Moscow in 1969, and from the magazine Soviet Life, May 1978, p. $9,

Soviet Life stated that "visas are issued within 10 days of receipt of

application at a Soviet consulate,"

2,.. What do you know about Aleksandr Nikiforovich Akscnev?

(a) Aksenov was Deputy Chairman of the KGB of Belorussia
from 1959 to 1960, It is assumed that when Oswald arrived

in Minsk in January 1960, Aksenov was Deputy Chairman of

of the KGB and would definitely know about the Oswald case.
From 1960 to 1965, Aksenov was MVD Minister of Belorussia. -
Therefore it would be under his direction that Oswald's passport
and the departure of Oswald and Marina from Minsk was
arranged, If Nosenko had access to Oswald's file, he must

know about Aksenov. From 1965 to 1971, Aksenov was First
Secretary of the Vitebsk Obkom of CP Belorussia, and since
1971, Aksenov has been Second Secretary of the Central
Committee of the Belorussian CP, He hay been a member of

the CC CPSU since 1976, and he is also a deputy to the USSR
Supreme.Sovict. On May 9, 1978, Aksenov arrived in Columbia
He headed the Soviet delegation on the invitation of the Columbian
Communist Party.

he

Note: Rudak was Deputy Chairaan of the KGB during 1959 to 1960 and
might have taken part in the Oswald case while Oswald lived

in Minsk,

- 4. Did you know or know of Major General Stepan Alekseyevich Smorodinskiy?

Smorodinskiy was Deputy Chairman of the KGIS for Belorussia in
"1962 and most likely know about the Oswald case. His name
would most likely appear in the Oswald file.

Not

/ 5+, Do you know Lt, General Vasiliy Ivanovich Petrov?

Note: Petrov was KGB Chairman for Belorussia from 1959 to 1973,
Therefore, it would be his agency, the KGB, which would watch
Oowald in Minsk, It is.safe to assume that after the assassination
of President Kennedy in 1963, Petrov, as Chairman of the KGB
of Belorussia, would review the Oswald file and send it to Moscow.

ante He would also have been called to Moscow KGB headquarters to
: take part in the preparation of the spravka (summary) of the
. Oswald file.

6+ What do you know about Lt, General Aleksandr Ivanovich Perepelitayn?
Note: Perepeliteyn was Chafrman of:the KGB of the Beloriissian Republic
from 1954 to 1959, ‘Nosenko should know him or at Iéast about him.
Nosenko should be asked ‘if Perepelitsyn took any part in the
investigation of Oswald. (Perepeliteyn was Deputy Chairman of
the KGB of the USSR from 1959 to 1967, He died in Moscow.)
y ™ What part, if any, was played by General Sergey Grigoryevich Bannikov
in the Oswald case, especially after the assassination of. President Kennedy?
Note:’ Bannikov was mentioned by Nosenko as one of the Deputy Chiefs of
the Second ‘Chief Directorate and later on as one of the Deputy

: Chairmen of the KGB of the USSR, From 1968 to 1978, Bannikov
was Deputy Chairman of the Soviet Supreme Court.

Presence in the USSR? Wouldn't the GRU officer in Intourist, whom you

mentioned earlier, have known about Oswald's presence in the USSR?

Did you ever hear that Oswald possibly had contact with the Soviet

intelligence during his service in Japan?

y

You stated previously that there was no information that Oswald offered

to give information on the US Marine Corps. You did not read the file.

Then how do ae know this to be the case? How do you know that the KGB

and GRU made no attempt to debricf Oswald about his service in the

US Marine Corps?

3. Previously you mentioned one Colonel Voloshin as an officer of the

Defense Ministry of the USSR. Can you provide any additional information

on this Voloshin? Could it be possible that he was a KGB officer instead wet

of in the Defénie'Ministey?

(2) Accovding to Epstein's book, one Pavel T, Voloshin was an.
administrator at Patrice Lumumba University and was a KGB
officer who accompanied a group of Russian dancers to Los Angeles
in 1959 at just about the same time that Oswald was making
weekend trips there to get his passport and possibly to make other
arrangements for‘his trip to Moscow. A few weeks after Oswald
decided to return to the United States, he received a letter from
Patrice Lumumba University Signed by Voloshin. (page ay)

and middle name forgotten) who used to work in SMERSH

Did you know that while in Minsk Marina belonged to a group of youths
who gathered together to listen to Voice of America and bec? Would
that be enough for the KGB to have Marina in its card files? Ie it
possible that Marina was the KGB agent reporting on them?

You stated that if Marina had been recruited by the KGB, you would
know about it and it would be in the file. But you did not read the file.
How then do you know that she was not recruited?

You said that amorg Marina's relatives there was an officer of the Minsk
Militia, a Lt, Colonel, Do you have any comments on Marina's
revelation that her real father was a traitor and that he was shot? If
her father was a traitor and he was shot, would hie name be in the KGB
card file? Would the name of Marina's mother be in the KGB card file
as the wife of a traitor? Is it then possible that Marina's name also
would be in the KGB card file somewhere?

.

You stated previously that KGB had no interest in Marina prior to her
meeting Oswald and that the KGB investigated her only after Oswald
applied for permission to register marriage with Marina. How do you
know that? Did you read a special file on Marina? Marina revealed
lately that while she was living in Leningrad in 1958 or 1959, she met
a diplomat from Afghanistan who lured her to his hotel room and tried

to make love to her.- Do you think the KGB in Leningrad would know

Embassy (from Sovict employees there or Soviet agents there) about
Oswald's denunciation of US citizenship? Did the KGB instruct Oswald
to denounce his American citizenship at the American Embassy before
he would be permitted to apply for Soviet citizenship?

You stated that the decision to give Oswald a stipend: was mado by the
Red Cross, Explain in detail how the Red Cross learned that Oswald

American who needed help? Why was it decided to give help from the
Red Cross and not from the Trade Union? It is.understandable that
Oswald might not have had enough money to start a naw life in the USSR,
but he was not a poor beggar who needed to be turned to the Red Cross

instead of the Trade Union, How did you find out that it was the Red Cross

that made the decision? According to available information, the Red

You stated previously that Oswald's file was scnt to the Second Directorate
of the Relorussian KGB, Haw do you know that it was sent specifically
to the Second Directorate and not to the KGB chairman or his deputy

What do you mean "to keep an eye on him" (Oswald)? That, according

to your words, was the instruction froin the Seventh Department of the

Do you have any comments on the statement made by Marina's uncle,

he really was a citizen or that the KGB Spread the rumor that he

was.

IDENTIFICATION

BACKGROUND

APPROVAL

cand after

‘OSENKO, Yurily Ivanovich, a Soviet

KGB officer who defected -in 1964 and
subsequently involuntarily con-

fined in the U.S. by the Agency for

a period of approximately three years.

NOSENKO first contacted Agency per-
sonnel in Switzerland in June 1962
and subsequently defected in January
1964. NOSENKO brought to the #5.
period of relative freedom
he was involuntarily confined in

April 1964, From April 1964 to

August 1965, he was confined at an
Agency controlled site-in Clinton,
Maryland. From August 1965 to

October 1967, NOSENKO was ‘confined
atl Virginia. In October
1967, Ne was returned to the Washington
area, given incre ng amounts of
freedom until he was given total free-
dom in April 1969. NOSENKO hb,
U.S. citizen in April 1974, SOSENKO
was employed by the Agency as a
consultant in March 1969 and continues
under contract to date. Mis present
salary is $23,500 per year.

(1) The legal basis to confine NOS!
against his will was discussed by
Mr. Richard Helms, D/P, and others th
the Deputy Attorney General on 2 April
1964 (Tab 1). On 3 April 1964, the
Agency General Counsel, Mr. Lawrence
Mouston, advised the Director of Security
by memorandum that such confinement was
proper (Tab 2).

(2) There are a serics of letters from
the PDCI, DCI and others to various
agencies, including the Department of
Justice and the White House, covering
the period 1964 to 1969, cvidencing
awareness of these agencies of the
NOSENKO affair (Tab 3),

(3) The conditions of NOSENKO's conf ine-
ment were established by the Office of
Security (Tabs 4 & 5).



RESULTS

TERMINATION

COMMENTS

Ky memorandum dated 2 October 19
the Director of Security Co
two reports to the DvCT summarizing
the results of the NOSENKO case to

that date. The reports are voluminous
One was prepared by the Office of
Security and the other by the FBI.

Both reports conclude that NOSENKO
was a bona fide defector. A draft
memorandum attached to this file,
dated 21 October 1968 and prepared
by the CI Staff, raises question
regarding NOSENKO's bona fides

and challenges the above two reports.

KO continues under contract to
cy. He is brought to shington
ally to consult on matters
germane to his background and experience.
Various reports are available in the

he Office of Sccurity which
uncial aspects of this cause.
counting has been made since
the project continues.

(1) While the Office of Security files

do document the rationale for the original
confinement of NO! KO, they do not
document the rationale for his continued
confinement over so long a period of time.
A memorandum dated $ August 1969 states
that various congressional staff officors*~
were briefed on NOSENKO and states that
concern for his safety, as well as con-
cern regarding his bona fides, prompted
the prolonged confinement. (See Tab 6)

(2) Office of Security files document
a period in 1969 during which a mail
cover was placed on NOSENKO.

(3) During the above period, NOS
allowed a pleasure trip to Florida.
During this trip, Agency personnel, with
apparent Headquarters approval, obtained
the services of prostitutes. This
apparently occurred on at 1 t two
occasions.

MEMORANDUN FOR RECORD

. ‘SUBJECT: Discussion with Deputy Attorney:
7 General on Nosenko Case Eee e

1, Mr elas, Nr. Houston and Mr. Murphy sot with
the Deputy Attorney Goneral and wesbers of his staff to
discuss subject case. Present frca Xr. Katzenbach's

staff wore Messrs. Foloy, Yeagley and Rois. =

2.. Mr. Holus explained the Nosenko case briefly
and indicsted that shortly we would be faced with what
we at least considered to be two probleas on which we
would like the advice of the Departaent of Justice.
i" First, wo would secon feel coapelled to begin hostile
a interrogation of Nosenko in order to arrive at the truth
i with respect to his mission for the KG3 and wo wondered
what the legal position would be in circuastances in
. ° which we detained Noseako against his will for this pur-
pose. Second, wo would have to be ready after detorain-
ing that we could obtain no additional inforuation fros
Nosanko to doport hin... We had thought of taking hin to
Germany and transferring him to Soviet custody in Borlin
where this has been done a nunder of tincs in the past.

zl 3. There was soso discussion of whether deportation

to another country sight be a consideration. Nr. Helms 4
explained we would probably face publicity problesas in . oe
deporting to a third country of the kind ve would en=

counter if he were free in the U. S. Nr. Helss noted

there were aany itoms of inforsation which we and the

FBI realizo are of no significacce because of the file

holdingsswe have but which an unscrupulous newspaper san

could use to create sischiof, This aspect was then dropped

and it was the consensus that 3erlin was probably the best

place.

4. The question of the basis for detention was again
raised and related by Mr. Foloy to the conditions under
which Nosenko is in this country. We is hers as an “ox-
clusion and parole case" which seans he has not been
adaitted and has been paroled to the Agency which is
responsible for hin while ho is in this country. This

ey



parole can be interproted to moan parole to a specific
locale which would provide sone justification for our
detaining him for questioning. It was then pointed out,
however, that 1£ he said he wished to loave the country
to return to. the. Soviet Union, technically we would not
be abke to detain hio further. In this event, wa would
be faced with the need to deport his quickly and quiotly
and for this purpose. the isnigration warrant of arrest
and deportation was probably the best instrument.

5. Ur. Katzenbach askod Hr. Foley to check into
this and Mr. Foley will in turn contact Nr, Houston,
Mr, Houston will in turn discuss the problem with CIA
Office of Security officisls to got the background of
their Lisison with the INS oa theso matters,

csseiaeen 6. Mr. Holus thanked Mr. Xatzenbach for his assistance
E and wo departed amid some jovial banter with respect to

“The. Spy Who Came in From the Cold" about what we expacted
i happen to him when he started to climb aver that "wall"
n Berlin.

Question lL - Conditions under which Nosenko was held while at
Clinton? Locked in? Let outside for entertainment?

Prisoner? Treatment?

Answer?

During the period of 4 April 1964-13 August 1965, Nosenko
was held in strict confinement under the following conditions:

a. Confinement in single room except for
periods of interrogation.

b. Constantly under guard and subject to 24 hour
visual observation with regular room search.

c. Dress was coveralls and food was of sufficient
quantity but limited in variety.

d. No unnecessary conversation was permitted, radio
and television were not allowed, newspapers or
any information concerning current cvents were
forbidden and reading material was extremely

limited.

Question #3 - Did McCone or Raborn have any information on this:
What?

Answer:

Office of Security records contain only limited information
in regard to this question. The SE Division (then SR) was the
responsible office for the confinement of Nosenko until late
October 1967 when total responsibility was transferred to the
Office of Sccurity by the DCI. It is presumed that the DCI was
at leust generally aware of the confinement of Nosenko' and the
conditions of confinement, but any definite statement must be

based on SE records.

Question #4 - Where is Nosenko working now?

Answer:

Noscnko currently employed at his personally owned
residence in rth Carolina, He is engaged in research and
analytical work bascd on his previous knowledge of the KGB
and other Soviet matters. He is in the Washington, D. C. arca
for several days approximately every six weeks for direct
interviews by the FBI,and Office of Security personnel.

Question #5 - Is he working for CIA?

Answer:

Nosenko has been employed by the Agency on a full-time
contractual basis since 1 March 1969. The original contract
has been periodically amended to reflect additional remuneration,
primarily to compensate for cost of living increases. ..1n,late, -

Nosenko. As noted in the first paragraph, in October 1967
Nosenko took up residence in the Washington arca and was

October 1967,

While one can criticize the fact that Noscnko was kept
incommunicado for approximately three years, and therefore
presumably denied full civil rights, the attached document
docs indicate, we believe, that the Agency was on the horns
of a dilemna in this regard. There were Icgitimate doubts

the Agency acted in a fully responsible manner to ensure that

Nosenko ‘to the United States. However, unprecedented action

by the Soviet Government in ance ct to the defection of one

of its citizens forced a change of plans. On 9 February,

unidentified Soviet sources in Geneva lcaked the news to the
Press that Nosenko, described as an “expert attached to the
Soviet Delegation to the Disarmament Conference" had dis-

appeared, and that it was presumed that he had defected.

SEGRET



: SECKET

Because of mounting pressurc'from the press, which included
much speculation that Nosenko was a high level scientist or

disarmament expert, it was decided that the State Department

would make a brief announcement acknowledging Nosenko's’”
request for asylum in the U.S, and identifying him as a

member of the KGB. This was done on 10 February. On 11 Feb-

ruary, the Soviet Government delivered a note to the American

Embassy in Moscow asking how Nosenko left Switzerland and
requesting an immediate interview with him and his release.

On 12 February, Soviet Ambissador to the Disarmament Confer-
ence TSARAPKIN held a press conference in Geneva in which he
accused the Swiss Government of failure to cooperate in

locating Nosenko. Although the Swiss categorically rejected
these charges, the American Ambassador to Switzerland recom-
mended that Swiss authorities be allowed to interview Nosenko..:~
to convince themselves that Nosenko had left Switzerland of

his own free will. .

On 12 February 1964, on the instructions of the Director,
Nosenko was brought to the United States. He travelled by

he was a KGB plant, and at the same time it became obvious
that it would be impossible to proceed further, to resolve

the many suspicious points and contradictions that had arisen
without changing the conditions in which he was being held.
Nosenko was growing increasingly uncooperative, especially

when sensitive areas were touched upon, and constantly pressed

for the legalization of his status in the U.S. and the issuance

of an alien registration card. At the same time, Nosenko's

heavy drinking and other unruly personal habits were ca sing

keeping him under control and out of trouble at all times in

that it was only a matter of time before he created a public

cate with the KGB since physical control could not be absolute.

decided, therefore, that the physical circumstances of Nosenko's
stay in this country would have to be drastically changed if

the Agency were to carry out its counterintelligence responsi-
bilities and adhere to the terms of the parole agreement. As
a result, he was moved to quarters where his movements could

It is worth noting that had we not taken the above action

actions could have been very embarrassing to the U.S. Govérnnient

ple, his chief operational proposal at the time, and one that
he was most insistent that we should proceed with immediately,

involved the compromise of a very senior Sovict official,

instructions, and that he came to the United States“on’a

grave und direct bearing on U.S. national security, Although

our findings were supported by the results of two polygraph

examinations, the nature of the evidence was inadmissable in

The Director of Security, State Department, was informed

of the bona fides problem at an-carly date. We have worked

the security interests of the State Department.

Because so much of Nosenko's information affected U.S.

mally egreed with our findings on Nosenko, at least to the
extest that "On considering carefully the results of your
interrogations of Yuriy Nosenko and your analysis of his
statenents and activities, it does appear he is not what he
purports to be. While this Bureau is not in a position to
draw any conclusion in this case, we do recognize it is
possidle that Nosenko could be a Soviet plant or agent pro-

ervations about Nosenko on 2 April 1964 and an opinion was”

and perole agreement, and as to how we should proceed in the
event that it proved necessary to deport Nosenko from this

Efforts to Keep the XGR fron Learning of Our Awareness of

Nose.
From the time we learned that Nosenko had been sent to

this country on a KGB mission it was obvious that if we were



SECAET

to have the time to analyze and resolve this case, and to
plan and execute appropriate countermeasures, it was essential
that we attempt to keep the KGB from learning of our awareness
of Nosenko's truce status. Consequently, detailed knowledge

of the depth and scope of our suspicions about Nosenko, and :
the implications thereof, was restricted tu a very few people
in the Agency and the. intelligence community. Nonetheless,

we did advise key policy echelons. and principals in the intel-
ligence community, even though this carried the inevitable

risk of Icakage.
Soviet Inspired Inquiries

In 1966 there were several indications that the, Soviets
were making a serious effort to find out what happened to
Nosenko and to force him to the surface. The most blatant

and unusual of these was the approach by a Soviet journalist,

Yuriy KOROLEV (a known KGB agent), to the French magazine
Paris Match with an offer to provide photographs and materials
for an exclusive story of Nosenko and his family, According
to Korolev, Nosenko's wife was considering an approach to an
international juridicial organization in an effort to obtain
compensation from Nosenko for damages caused by his abandon-
ment of her and her children. In responding to this approach

we quoted a statement, purporting to be fror Nosenko himself,

to the effect that Nosenko considers this approuch to repre-

and that he will not lend himself to the scheme by agreeing
to an interview or in any other way. :

Status

Nosenk:
To recapitulate, Nosenko entered the United States on

12 February 1964 on parole to the Agency under the provisions
of Section 212 (d) (5) of the Immigration and Nationality
Act. Parole responsibility is delegated to the Agency by
the Attorney Gencral under the terms of an agreement executed
by the Attorney General and the E71 on 10 February 1955,
which states:
“After parole of such aliens, the Central Intel-
ligence Agency will assume responsibility for

care, supervison and control of a kind and

degree it believes consistent with the internal
security needs of the United States during con-
tinuance of their parole status.”
In accordance with our understanding of this agreement, and
because we had reason to believe that Nosenko was a conscious
and willing agent of a hostile intelligence service, we
ensured that he was under our direct observation and control

at all times from the moment of his arrival in the United

12

SECRET



SECRET

States. From 12 February to 4 April 1964 it was possible to
keep Nosenko at a location where he could enjoy a certain
amount of movement and of contact with the outside world.
After 4 April 1964, for reasons explained above, it was
necessary to keep him incommunicado at.a location which is
known to no one outside of the Agency (and to very few within
it). Authorization for Nosenko to remain in this country

From the time that Nosenko was brought to this country
we thought about the possibility of his eventual deportation
an as a contingency measure. In carly 1964, we thought that-it. eee
might be possible to mitigate the political and propaganda
drawbacks of a forced deportation by announcing that Nosenko
has confessed his true KGB role. With the passage of time,

however, and in view of our much firmer conclusions about his

real role and mission and our clearer understanding of what

13 : ee

SECRET

this implicd, it was apparent that great practical problems
stood in the way of his deportation to cither the USSR or a
third country.

USSR: Nosenko has categorically stated on numerous
occasions that he will never contemplate return to the USSR,
and, although we suspect that he might secretly welcome such
a move, we would expect him to act out his part to the end
with loud protests that he was being shipped to his death,
etc. When the possibility of expulsion was discussed with
Department of State officials in 1964, both the Secretary of
State and Ambassador Thompson expressed their concern for
the adverse effect this might have on other potential defec-
tors. Forcible repatriation of political refugees is against
long established U.S. policy, and would be certain to arouse

violent reaction from ethnic minority groups in the United

States. Under these circumstances an alleged "confession"
by Noscnko would have come under very close scrutiny, and
might have backfired very badly. Another point that had to
be considered was the possibility that the Soviets, again
playing their part, might have refused to accept Noscnko on
the grounds that he has renounced his Sovict citizenship.
Third Country: Although we believed’it likely that

Nosenko would accede to deportation to a third country,

in Pare in 1964. He was. subsequently brought to the
U.s,, and after 4 short period of relative freedom, he was
confined under str austere conditions
‘ for a period of approximately three years. Commencing in
: 1967, he was ziven increasing amounts of freedom until he
was allowed tesal freedom in 1969. He subsequently married
a U.S, citizen, settled in the Southeastern United States ru.
and became a U. ‘itizen in 1974. fe is presently under ‘2
contract to the Ageniy: providing consultative services
and information on sub, cets germane to his background.

NOSENKO was confined when as a result of his debric fing

substantive questions were prised concerning his bona fides,

and his general behavior ra further concern about his
motional health and generai safet,’ NOSENKO'S debricfing

‘ And confineazat were ended when it aes concluded Cay
was not a threat to national security sre ta ee or fine-

i Justi vartaent was obtained at the tine or afin,
went, and the Fel participated in his subsequent. debrae! 1n8*
NOSENKO's initial entry into the U.S, was coordinated wits. E |
the Department of State, and they were periodically advised i

of his status during his confinement up to the time of his

final settlenent-

The strict conditions of NOSENKO's confinement were
intended to convey to i
as a suspected disinformation agent and to make clear to him that Pine
his free settleaent in the U.S. precluded as long as
this issue was unresolved, It was understood, however,
that at any time he could have lected to end his cenfine- __
ment and return to the Soviet Union. OS files do not document.
that this latter condition was explicitly conveyed to
NOSENKO, however, it is the recollection of senior staff —
officers (ADD/O and p/OS) that such was the case, and further
that it was a condition routinely applied to other defectors
whose bona fides were in doubt.

ie and MOCKINGBIRD

Se

1. Forwarded herewith is a 31 December 1974 memorandum
from the Acting Director of Security on subject activities. The
material represents responses to questions posed by your office.
Obviously, the next phase of the investigation will require more
detailed reviews of each activity,

a 2. Questions that occur to us in reading the attached, are:

PARAGON i

We should spell out what is meant by the ~
statement that the FDI "deferred further coverage
to the Office of Security, " how it was expreased and
what form it took.

The taping of two conversations does not seem
to constitute “electronic surveillance" in the usual
sense, It certainly is not trespatory surveillance,
A little more detail on the equipment will be wanted,

NOSENKO

We will go to the DDO for any record of DCI
knowledge, and report such information as we get.

AELADLE .

We will want to verify DDCI's approval of entry.



CELOTEX 1

| a We will want more detail on the actual
surveillance, including possible higher approval.

: This is responsive to the DCI's request for
newspaper articles that led to the surveillance.

CELOTEX IL

CELOTS<

i Questions similar to CELOTEX L

We may want actual copies of newspaper,
stories for display, in addition to memos, should

DCI wish to use it.

: MOCKINGBIRD

! No recorded (in CIA) formal approval by
: Attorney General. It may be that Justice will
have a copy.

Does this raise a question of surveillance*
of congressmen if one is contacted by.someone
under surveillance?

3. Security experts to have reports on Maheu, SIESTA,
REPFACEI, surveillance trucks, and Israeli COMINT, by COP

MEMORANDUM FOR: Inspector General

ATTENTION : Mr. Neil Ainslie
VIA ! Deputy Director for Administration
SUBJECT 2 Alleged Illegal Activities

(Unidentified Subject--Alleged Abuse
of Defector)

1. Reference is made to Mr. Ainslie's verbal request
for a review of Office of Security files in an effort to
Provide information pertinent to 2 case mentioned on page
170 of the Report to the President by the Commission on CIA
activities within the United States..

2, The case in question from Page 170 of the Commission
Report quoted as follows: "In one other case, a defector
was physically abused, although not seriously injured. The
Director of Central Intelligence discharged the employee in-

volved."

3. A search of Office of Security file resources has
reflected -information pertinent to a case in which a defector
was physically abused at an overseas location, and the Agency
employee was later terminated by the DCI. It is not known
whether the following case is identical to the referenced
case on page 170 of the Commission Report, but the facts
appear to be quite similar.

4. Information developed by this Office of possible in-
terest to the Inspector General, pertains to one John Torpats,
an ex-CIA employee, and one Eduard Oun, an Estonian defector.

5. Torpats was born in 1898 in Estonia, and became a
naturalized U.S. citizen in 1926. Torpats was employed by
CIA in February 1949 and was terminated 30 January 1961. | The
file information reflected that in July 1956, Torpats was found
guilty of mistreatment of an alien by a Special Inquiry Board

in Frankfurt, West Germany. The alien involved was Eduard
Oun, an Estonian who defected from Estonia through Sweden
in 1955.

6. The incident in Frankfurt involved nistreatment of
Oun during interrogations directed by Torpats. The charges
of physical abuse included the striking of Oun with the fist;
application of turpentine and ointments to various parts of
the body, the scrubbing of Oun's body with a brush, and forc-
ing Oun to stand in the nude as long as eight days during
interrogations with only very bricf rest periods.

7. Torpats was returned to Headquarters and was brought
before an Employment Review Board for consideration of separa-
tion from the Agency. The Board's recommendations initially
were that Torpats be “transferred to an area cutside the
Clandestine Services. Torpats appealed the decision, and a
later recommendation included reduction in grade from GS-14
to GS-13, Torpats later received uns. tisfactory fitness re-
ports and engeged in various "in house" battles with Agency
officials concerning his employment.

8. Torpats was later terminated in accordince with the
authority granted the DCI under Section 102(C) of the National
Security Act of 1947, as ammended, effective 30 January 1961-
Later in 1961, Torpats filed suit against the DCI contesting
his dismissal, and the U.S. District Court for the District of
Columbia granted the government's motion for summary judgment
against Torpats. Torpats appealed the decision, and the U.S.
Court of Appeals, in 1962, upheld the lower court's ruling
that Torpats' termination was legal.

9. The Office of Security file of Eduard Oun contained
little information other than interrogation reports dated 1956.
It was not clear from file information whether Oun entered the
United States after the Frankfurt incident. The most recent
document contained in the Oun file dated 17 September
1956 and noted that Oun had been psychiatrically examined and
found qualified for Agency sponsored immigration to the U.S,
under Public Law 203.

10. It is noted that Office of Security files contained
only fragmentary information in regard to certain areas of the
Torpats' case. File review indicated, however, the DDO, OGC
and the inspector General's office will probably have addition-
al information concerning this matter,

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Rockefeller Commission ‘Contact

Mason Cargill told me today that the reference
in the Commission report to an employee who was fired
because he abused a defector came from a deposition by ia
Dick Helms: Helms could not remember an exact name,
but from the description which he gave on his deposition, f
it is clear that the employee who was fired was John
Torpats. He was discharged by Allen W. Dulles in 1960.

Torpats, himself a Lithuanian refugee, was working
in the in Frankfort, Germany.

In the course of interrogating another Lithuanian
defector, Torpats beat him. After Torpats was fired,
he sued the Director (then McCone). He lost the case,
