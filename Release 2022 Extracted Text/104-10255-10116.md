The attached letter is forwarded
for your information and action.
Mr. Rorke Sr.'s statement that at
one time his son cooperated with
CIA in flights over Cuba is not
correct. We are also attaching for
your information copies of some of
the news articles that have appeared
on Rorke Jr. In the sumer of 1960
00/cÂ¢ made a couple of contacts with
Rorke Jr. other than this there has
been no CIA interest in hin.
Alexander I. Rorke, Jr.. from infor-
mation available, appears to be a
mercenary and adventurer. We would
appreciate a copy of any reply sent
to Mr. Rorke 6r.

operational interest in either of these individuals at any time.
