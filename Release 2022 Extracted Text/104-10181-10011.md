For instance, She wont two cables to MINREX - one regarding
the forwarding of Hovie posters for a March exhibit and another
regarding the forvarding of.a Cuban stamp exhibition by end

' April quarter. She showed him "an agenca for the control of
laa aad unplanned activities” and the gererol dircctives of
which docluded scientific information and political
information; with specific directives (requirements)—for-Spain.
RUIZ’ has to.prepare for. Bavana a noothly report, then a quarterly

Party vould try to infiltrate it and this
vould bring problems to-the Eabassy, Senia a
pointed out the successes encountered in mitesstectetia
Suitzerland and Sweden with such » committee
even though at first there sere problems
vhich were. later overcome.

b. Sonia shoved RUIZ a conmercial project
which she planned to take to Portugal and
asked him to read it because it was algo of
interest to the Cuban wission in Spain.

¢. Sonia mentioned that the Plan of
, Information. was still to be completed especially
; in the priority categories of livestock and

econeay,

d. They turned next to the topic of
the budget. Sonia said that the budget
for each mission had to be submitted before
the end of April (every year) and no additional
expenditures could be subaitted for Opproval
during the course of the year. Spain, Csnada,
ard France, hovever, would be treated individually.
Their special needs, such as acquisition of
. More office space, raises in cost of living
“ allovances, etc., would be taken into consideration

PHYSICAL

DESCRIPTION: White, variously described as 5'5" - 5'7"
tall, and 170-190 pounds, stout build;
round face, fair complexion, blond slightly
wavy hair, light-colored eyes (also reported
as blue and grecn), wears glasses. No
visible identifying marks. Well dressed.

PERSONALITY: Perhaps a relative's description of RUIZ

: suns up his personality - "a man of many
moods." He has variously been described

as intelligent, ‘mentally alert, competent,
hardworking, and respected by his subordinates.
Pleasant, easy going, nervous, quick-tempered,
brusque but -siricere, opinionated, strong-minded
idealistic, self-confident. Has basic
emotional instability, gives impression

of being insecure in his position. At times
sarcastic, indifferent, egotistical, cynical,
ous, ungrateful and cold, who,
paradoxically, appears friendly to some people,
Outspoken, compitlsive talker, articulate,
limited vocabulary, swears a good deal.



Orestes Gud Merno RUIZ Peres,

He can turn on considerable
charu, where motivated. In creas i
contrast to his pleasant publie .
image ‘and acceptable language,

‘private conversation is vulgar,

swears continually and flies into

rages.

Likes good living and spends money
khere it shows. “Avid- reader, keeps
abreast of world events, shovs
Willingness to accept whatever he

deems to be good or uscful from

the outside world. Concerned with

the image and prestige of Cuba in

Spain. fmotionally connitted to

an ideal. An AMEDIT study summed

RUIZ up as a realist. He speaks

English and French. His wife, a
teacher, always worked before going

to Spain, and there works as a

Secretary and bookkeeper at the 2
fnbassy on an infornal basis. Appears
intelligent, competent. outspoken

but solicitious and affectionate with
her husband; interested in, and
Sheourages him in-his work. Appears to
Fupport the regime, but not a fanatic.
RUIZ is the dominant personality of the
two. : eh

EDUCATION: One reference states that he went to
work at age 14, which suggests lack of
formal education,

In 1960 as an employee of the Ministry

of the Treasury, sclected to attend

enitatistics course offered by CEPAL,
which lasted two years,

One relative reported ne completed
elementary education at “Hermanos

Maristas" school in Havana; did not :

POLITICAL”
ATTITUDE:

.-Party,,. 2

U.S. 5 April 1957, overstayed

his time, and on 11-February 1958

was ordered deported; claimed he __
would be killed if he returned to

Cuba and ‘did not show for deportation.
Subsequent investigation showed he ~ >"
was in Cuba’ ag ‘of 2. Maich.

A member of the Cuban Communist - EZ
imitted oh the rccomaendation
of -Armando-HART Davalos; Secretary

of Organization. Although he has.
been described as a militant Comcunist,
a convinced ‘supporter of the Castro
regime and a fanatic Fidelista, there
is evidence to dispute this image.

An analysis of available information
indicates that he is not a convinced
Marxist, he cannot accept Party
discipline, and that his character

is basically incompatible with the
system he serves.

His. father is reported to be an old-
guard Communist and a leader of ©

the barber's union. A brother

reported to-be a member of DSE in 1946,

He expressed dissatisfaction with

his position as a diplomat, feels

his talents are wasted and would like
& position in commerce or industry,
where he considers he could better
serve the revolution. las criticized
the bureaucracy and inefficiency in
the government in Havana,

He has said that many Cuban diplomats
want to stay out of Cuba, but ‘it
seemed to him that the Cuban government
wanted to keep him (RUIZ) out of the
way (i.c¢., outside Cuba), That LEON
had appointed him, supported hin, and
they ‘are good friends, but that he
(RUIZ) does not like to work with a

man who one does not get to know,

nor to know what he is thinking. He
said he felt as if he were in Miant.

<1, There is little we can contribute to the exceptionally
“fine réports submitted by Headquarters on AMAUTO-1. His
character, personality, physical”and mental capabilities,

and to somé extent even his vulnerabilities, are succinctly
outlined in-your reports. In addition, you have appropriately
recognized’ the Hurculean task we have, to overcome his, strong-
mindedness and idealistic character.

| 2,2. After & series of discussions among the officers
involved ‘with PBRUMEN’ operations at the Station, we have
concluded that to execute a logically developed "traditional"
recruitment, we are faced with the challenge to recruit a
person, an intermediary, in whom ANAUTO-1 has confidence and
respect; an individual who is able to plausibly carry on a
polemic argument with AMAULO-1 without cither antagonizing

him or causing him to become suspicious of the intermediary's
true role. Moreover, the intermediary must be intelligent

to be able to respond in an appropriate way to our instructions,
as well as show a genuine willingness to cooperate. Frankly,
we have no such person, currently on our list of assets and

to find someone with the attributes set forth in Reference A,
will be difficult to say the least, but we are prepared to

work diligently on this problem.

3.. AMAUTO-1 confides in few people. From our reading

of QUTINID. and QUDOZE), there are at least three persons

whe could Yosical)y and effectively fill ‘the role as an
intermediary, They are Identities A, B, and C, We can
categorically eliminate Identity A for obvious reasons, i.e,
lack of direct access to him. Because of his relationship
to identity D, we can also tentatively ¢liminate Identity B.
He: presents’a: Fisk which"we are not certain should be taken;
however, -wé would like “te add 2 comment on him in a later
paragraph. . Identity C, would’seem to be the most logical
choice. He is intelligent, a professional man, well-to-do,
young and.one with whom AMAUTO-1 frequently talks and whom

he often sees... We know little about Ris political proclivities
although he gives the impression of being a moderate analyst

of world events and: doesn't secin to have 2 strong affection

or aversion for the -PBRUMEN Government. We have a good
background on him prepared for us by Dun and Bradstreet;
however, as-you:can well.’ imagine, the report concentrates on
_ the economic’Side of ‘the individual. We have made a number
of-attempts-here in the to determine whether he has
any American contacts, but with negative results: His visa
file does not show where he visited in the United States or
the purpose, except that it was a business trip. He has an
_ indefinite visa and we are fairly certain that, if necessary,
we could use the question of -his visa as an entre to him,

We are currently reviewing with all Station assets their
knowledge of Identity C, In addition, we are also considering
assets suchas QUCASH-1 and QUSPOT-1, who could, under some
legitimate business pretext, contact Identity C. Our objective
is to develop a warm entree to Identity C without compromising
any of our agents, but we are in need of an assessment of
Identity C by either a Station Officer or an asset working
under an officer's instructions. We will keep you advised of
our progress. We are forwarding PRQ Part I under separate
cover. A POA on Identity C was requested separately. There
are no derogatory Station traces.

4, Identity B would be an excellent choice if not for
his relationship with Identity D. This avenue might be explored
with QUSEQUIN-48 if Headquarters is agreeable to a joint
operation, QUSEQUIN-48 could probably get the necessary
clearances from Identity D directly, or from one of Identity D's
aides, to contact Identity B. We will not pursue this until
we receive your comments. f

5. It is not too early to consider the emoluments we
might want to offer to AMAUTO-1 at the time a pitch is made.
AS always they’ should be divided into two areas ~ for defection
and for recruitment and work in place.

penetration of his building.

3. We would be grateful for any information addressees
might have on the general modus operandi of PBRUMEN security
forces in areas where PBRUHEN official installations have been
constructed, Have they used PBRUHEN technicians, electricians,
construction engineers, etc? Also wa would like to know whether

on list.:. AMAUTO-1's secretary said that he would

appointment was made for 10 March, :

Probably in her early thirties, :
and. waa’ due to have her sixth child Tt
lowever, her physician recommended a
forced labor ( ‘reasons unknown), which was scheduled
for 17 April.1970. She has had difficulties with
her -pregnancy because of recurring fainting spells
and overweight, which are being treated by Dr, HER-

NANDEZ and Dr. MATA ( the latter ordered lab tests
for Diabetes, ‘thé. results of which are unknown),

i
: Married for 16 yeare to Guillermo, Nilda

is a pleasant woman who has not been known to

quarrel openly with her husband or express

“political or religious opinions, although in

this last r2spect she has recited the Lord's

Prayer in front of Embassy personnel, which

suggests that she may have been or is a practicing

Catholic. ;

Mrs. Ruiz is a language teacher by profession

( speaks English fluently ), and is active in
the Embassy as secretary to her husband and book-
keeper, but only on an informal basis.

Of rather weak personality /Exception,

time with them,

family in Cuba, as he lived in a solar / in
Cuba, a ‘slum dwelling 7 in Marianao and began
to work when he was only 14 years old.

In the fifties he emigrated. to the United
States, travelling throughout the East Coast
‘and holding minor jobs. In 1957 he began to
work as an.apprentice butcher for a Polish-
“American named Alexander SAMKO, who had a
grocery store on Flagler St. in Miami. He

did'so well in attracting Latin-American customers

to the store that he soon began to distribute
meat inthe area for SAMKO,

He has said that when he left Miami
in 1958 he turned over to his brother a house
in North Miami, a brand new car, and over a
thousand dollars in the bank.

But his "success" could be traced, perhaps,

to another acquaintance that he is known to
have had.

EDUCATION : Aside from the statistics course

taken in 1960, RUIZ seems to lack, in the eyes

of some cbservers,.a solid, formal education,

“But he makes up for it by being an avid reader

(five newspapers a day, plus books). -This impression,
“however, may be wrong, for there are indications
that’ he either studied or wanted to be a CFA,

He. understands and speaks English and
‘reach (fluency unknown), and has undertaken
to ‘teach grammar to the embassy staff. : -

Senaitive to art, or so he says, he
frequently complains of the general lack of
culture in.Cuba, His vocabulary level is rather
low, cussing quite often in the presence of

others...

RUIZ is well-versed in world affairs,
and does’ have an understanding of international -
trade,

He has read some of the works of José Marti,
whom he likes to quote. But there is another
book that he also refers to repeatedly, Kim PRILBY's,
the KGB spy who penetrated MI-6,

He is up-to-date on current intelligence
publications, :

HEALTH : Blond, baby-faced, and blue-eyed ("Very
handsome," according to Anita, the young maid ),
RUIZ is known to be suffering from an undisclosed
. Aiver illness for which he takes.a medicine called
“bilidis, Late in 1969 he was planning to goto
Portugal on vacation followirg the advice of his

physician,

» but he did not make the trip. He coughs
frequently, is used to cold weather, and was thinking
of going to the same gymnasium as his gon Alejandro.

Nothing ‘is known about unofficial contacts
with other diplomats in Madrid except that he
is close to and exchanges information with the -
Algetian Ambassador,

At times he tries to give the impression,
_ and. this might be true, chat he enjoys the. full
“personal confidence of Osvaldo DORTICOS and Rail
ROA, :

: “He frequently tells other Cuban diplomats i
:stopping in Madrid that he makes 90% of the i
decisions without consulting Havana because
that is “why I am here for."

Above all, he directs constant and bitter Hl
eriticiem against the bureaucracy in Havana H
because of ‘its incompetence, which, in his opinion, i
will ‘cause Fidel CASTRO to carry out a major purge :
after the 1970 sugar harvest comes to an end ("'No
one in Havana wants or cares to make a decision"),

The Peter Principle /“" In a hierarchy every

employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence" 7,
which he has read and is going ti del CASTRO
for reading on the advice of should
be taken as an example of what is happening in

Cuba. Furthermore, in his view Havana is always

trying to interfere with the Embassy in Madrid,
resulting in lack of co-ordination and even co- .
operation. ( To " More

than k of organization there is chaos in Cuba
today.") -

He directs almost the same criticism against
his. staff in Madrid because they, lack qualifications
for the poste that they hold. " They think that I
ama fool," he once told an associate, "but I
don't miss anything that they do."

in. turn, he has also been the tarvet of
eriticlém from Havana, first from lb
who. made ‘a critical evaluation of the Embassy
which he decided not to answer ("I took a

“ arfstides’ DIAZ that -he had received one more

critical. report:from Havana because the Embassy.
"had not achieved much," although they. had done
‘things ‘that were not included in the Earnie
plan.

But perhaps the most serious censure of
his activities came in by telex (" Why worry?
The Americans and the Spaniards intercept all
messages anyway") early in October 1969, Havana
questioned the way RUIZ was handling trade
negotiations with the Spanish Government, / The
trade agreement was extended by mutual consent
to 31 December 1972.7

In his reply addressed to Ratil LEON Torras,
first vice-minister of MINCEX and senior Cuban
official directly responsible for the talks,
Guillermo RUIZ defended his right to be "informed"
and "consulted" in rather strong language.
Therefore, he rejected that his cable number 521
was offensive to Joaquin ALVAREZ, a Cuban trade
official who had been the source of the complaint,

In the last paragraph he told Rail LEON
that the indemnification question ( payment to
Spanish citizens who owned property in Cuba)
depended on his reply to Don Pedro SALVADOR,

a Spanish Foreign Office official, and not on
"bribery" conjectures,


SECRET _ ul

-Evidently this last cable upset him so :

“-“vmmueht that he was nervous and particularly

security-conscious, Less than a week later, . 7
he called Rail LEON Torras and requested a

‘Telesforo DIAZ Portillo, a MINPEX official,
on:26 December 1969, " Communists are quite
meddlesome," he told another colleague soon
after, although in this instance he may have
been referring to the Spanish CP).

But the most important revelation of
his views came to light on 11 December 1969,
when he was quoted as telling a visiting DAP
official from Havana: " If I. disagree with
orders, I question them because I am not a
robot nor do I have the mentality of one, As
a human being I express opinions no matter
the risk that I may personally have to take,"

Obviously, a man who thinks in this way
cannot be a Marxist,

: Aside from the constant criticism of
Havana because of incompetence, lack of vision,
and the unreal. world they live in, he is quick -
to point out other deficiencies in life there,
as reflected in his directive to the embassy
staff not to celebrate Christmas together
because there are "hungry people" in Cuba. But

the area of security, but Guillermo RUIZ is
Particularly sensitive in this respect, which
perhaps could be traced to his probable involvement
with thie DGI in one way or another.

He is quick to warn visiting Cubans of the
CIA's efforts ( " La Compafifa Sociedad Anénima" )d '
to compromise them, even before leaving Havana.
“Our Enbassy," he says, "is the primary target
for U.S. operations in Spain,"

He keeps control of mail going to and
coming from Havana in the diplomatic pouch,
“and states repeatedly that his office is
“bugged and telephone tapped (" There are micro-
phones here the size of olives"), In addition,
he thinks he-is followed openly by Seguridad,

For all these reasons he has acked Havana”
for funds to build a new embassy, where he plans
to have a shielded room free from microphones, ( The
. building, which will cost approximately $600.000,
was approved by Havana and a Cuban architect travelled
to Madrid in late March 1970 to discuss the project
with Sr. VILLARROYA, from Construcciones Aza ra, who

articulate individual who has reached heights fae,

that in all probability would ‘have been beyond -
his capability in normal circumstances.

Nevertheless, from what can be seen hia
work in Spain ‘has been effective,-and he keeps

Precisely because of his privileged
status RUIZ is very careful in whatever he does,
avoiding mistakea that would endanger his
position,

Therefore, he will Probably resist any

indirect approach, which he will Tecognize fa
time to brush it off, fiesesters ,

But this does not mean that he is una: roachable,
- for he is not. There is no question that his
personality is incompatible with the system that
he serves, although with profound misgivings as
fo its efficiency, It is then a question of
how and when,

The, wery fact that he has made open remarks
suggesting his unhappiness with Havana and his
non-Marxist leanings in-an office "bugged by
the other side," as.he points out, could be
interpreted as ‘a signal on his part indicating
that he is ready to listen,

But he will be suspicious of an indirect
or subtle approach, which, in his view, could
be a trap to compromise him, including a loyalty
test by the DGI,

Consequently, a direct approach has much
- :better chance of success. It would be proof for
iercaeet him'.that he is walking on fiim ground by
dealing directly with Americans.- Which leads

to the question of when. There are two key
factors to consider:

a) His recall to Cuba, :

ie eee b). The 10-million’ ton sugar harvest, which
i : " ig scaeduled to end on 15 July 1970,

: RUIZ has indicated that he is. unhappy in +

ican his post--perhaps not really meaning what he
says--, which he has occupied for over two
years, i :

As he has said that Fidel CASTRO plans
a major purge after the 1970 sugar harvest,
he himself may be one of the targets. Assuming
that his ideological inconsistencies have been
noticed, the DGI, in the absence of proof
regarding his loyalty and considering whatever
support he has in Havana, may request his :
recall at an appropriate opportunity: during
@ major reorganization of the Cuban Government,

In any event, RUIZ does not expect to
remain in Madrid much longer, and is planning
to be back in Havana by the 18th of July.

If Cuba is successful in harvesting 10
million tons of sugar, and they have already
reached six, the "victory" chat Cuban propagandists

‘will herald ‘from July on may have a psychological

with an authorization ‘to travel to Cuba, it is usually
three or four days prior to flight departure. Since the

b. ‘“levertheless, he has received some rather telling

‘eriticisa of a professional nature, even though it 1s

unkoown whether this criticism also touches on his personal
life. -Perhaps becausé of this, AMAUTO-1 seems to be very
careful in whatever he does, avoiding mistakes that would eo-
danger his position, and avoiding any real or fancied

provocation.
c. There seems to be little question that AWAUTO-1 ta

approachable, although he would probably reaist any
indirect approach'in which "cards are not laid on the table."

©: It appears very likely that his character ig basically incom-
‘patible with. the system he serves (with profound misgivinga

as to. its. fficieacy).

. @.,; ‘The very fact that he has made open remarks suggesting
his ‘unhappiness vith PBRUMEN and his nou-Marxist leanings in
an office he hinself points out. is “bugged by the other side”

_could be-ioterpreted as a signal from him, indicating that he

igo who believes he can "jump off” at any time, if
-mecessary.--Note“that’ he tends to live with criticism from

me. office rather than try to get out from under ---
perhaps méaning’ that he would not accept a PCS assignment
home. (The attachment hereto shows him describing a
compatriot who wishes to return home as "a fool.") He has
said hingelf that he believes ANTHUG-1 plans a major purge
for mid-1970, and he might consider himself as a victim of

that purge.

e. A fact which might affect timing ig the arrival of
a child in May, If he were to persuade his wife (and hig
government) to have the child in Father than return
home for it, he ‘vould have a tn eenee for requesting the
presence of his oldest child (the only one who is now at
home). If his wife returnshome for delivery, he would (for
a time at least) have three hostages in PBRUMEN instead
of one.

f. U¥FGA-19006 reported a 1964 attempt to get at AMAUTO-1
through his wife's relatives. The consensus at the time was
that AHAUTO-1 is prebably immine to thia type of approach.
Headquarters, therefore, still opts for a logically developed,
“traditional” recruitment build-up.

3. In line with the above, Headquartera suggests to
— ro

certain lines of action which might be followed in an att

gore about AHAUTO-1. These actions might seem somevhat easier

from our perspective than’ they.actually are in the field, but ve
propose them for your consideration.

a, The man handling the new construction work (paragraph 16
of the attachment) should be checked out.

b. The established pattern of lonely automobile trips

outside the capital (see paragraph 22 of the attachment)
might be instructive to follow down. At least, the situation
might offer a chance for approach or for subsequeut handling.

¢. AMAUTO-1's desire to see more people at home, and
the indication that he diecusses important matters at hone
becomes doubly interesting with the possibility of a vacant
house next door (see paragraph 18 of the attachment). The
Person who owng the martment building migit offer a fruitful

o RUIZ Pe

es Guillern

DOB: c. 1931 :

Cuban Minister Plenipotentiary to Spain,
accredited 12 December 1967.

_ CHRONOLOGY

1. RUIZ probably comes from a huinble family in Cuba, decause
he lived in a so (semi-slum area) and began to work when he
was only fourteen years old, This circumstance suggests that he
lacks a formal cducation., Ie appears to come from a "revolutionary"
family (his father was identified as a Communist and a leader of
the_barbers' union: ih UfGA-13595, and a. brother. was identified
as a member of the DSE ‘as of 1964 in_UFG. - 19006) , 26 han tu SH}

P8230)

2, In the fifties RUIZ emigrated to the United’ States,
traveling throughout the cast coast and holding minor jobs,

1957 he“began to work as an_apprentice butcher for a Polish-
American named’ Alexander SASKO, who had a grocery store on

Flagler Strect in Miawi. He evidently did so well in attracting
Latin American customers that he soon began to distribute meat in ~
the area, working for SANKO (RUI% seems to be somewhat proud

of this success). He also appears proud of the fact that when i
he left Miami in February 1958, he loft his brothcr (same brother?) |

In

a house in North Miami, a brand new car, and over $1,0C0 in the
bank,

3. Although he did well in the meat business, he traces a
large part of his success to another acquaintance in Miami: an
American of Cuban descent known as Joe LOUIS (or LUIS). Joe
LUIS was_an underworld figure who was at that time competing
with the Italians in the bolita (numbers) racket in Tampa. RUIZ
and MOLEON (fnu), another Cuban exile, were each offered $800
a month by LUIS to supervise boli collcctions in Miami. (There
is no specific indication that RUIZ took his bolita friend up on

this offer). Furthermore, LUIS went _so far as €o offer RUIZ and
: NOLEON $5,000 apicce to kil] a_man named FERNANDEZ (fnu), who was
. also involved in the bolita racket in Miami.

4, In February 1957 (note the 1958 date, above; perhaps

an error. on RUIZ' part) RUIZ left Miami along with a man nared
VILLEGAS (whose first name might be Ilarry) and three other
nicmbers of the 26th of July Movement. They entered Cuba clandes-
tincly. When the revolution triumphed in Cuba, Alexander 0
went to Havana, where ke stayed for a weck as RUIZ' house guest.
SAMKO offered RUIZ a partnérship in the meat business in Miami
if he would return. RUIZ rejccted the offer, saying that the

Revolution needed him.

ON THE JOB

7. There secs little doubt that RUIZ exercise the full
authority that presucably he should have as Minister Pleni-
potentiary, The relations between Cuba and Spain appear to
remain static because of Spain's refusal to appoint a ful]
Ambassador to Cuba afte> LOJENDIO was expelled from the island
by CASTRO in 1959, RUIZ is involved in and is kept informed
-on all matters related to Cuban-Spanish relations, including
trade. fle does not seem to permit commercial attaches to bypass
him when they submit reports to their respective. home offices in
Havana, In addition, RUIZ takes a keen and active interest in
Cubana operations, and he has said that no one may travel to
Havana on Iberian without his permission. He insists that Cuban
officials arriving in Madrid.consult with him before arranging
visits to Spanish officials or factorics. .He seems to have
good working relations with Spanish government officials,
because he is always careful to “put all his cards on thc table”
in neetings with them. (The tenor of his ‘conversation seems to
emphasize that he likes things this way in all his relatio
personal as well as professional). ;

8. Little appears concerning RUIZ’ unofficial contacts
with other diplonats in Madrid, except that he is close to and
exchanges infornation with the Algcrian Anbassador.: (Accord-
ing to current records, this is Akned LAIDI, posted to Madrid
on 15 December 1986, living at Calle Tiemblo 3, Ciudad Puerto
de Fierro, Latest desk traces show this person as born 20 April
1934 in Oudja, Yoroceo, aud as of 25 October 1966 to have been
the Director General of the Foreign Ministry in-charge of
political, econozic, and cultyral affairs. He is described as

He wag Ben Bella's chief of cabinet before joining the Forcign
Office in 1964, and he functions mere on special assignment
than as part of the chain of coavand, « He was a member of the
Algerian UN delegation as of 28 September 1965.) :

9. RUIZ trics to yive the inpression that he enjoys the
full confidence. of Osvaldo DORTICOS and Raul TOA, thereby

being able to exercise the full authority of his position. He
frequently tells other Cuban diplouats stopping in Madrid that
he nakes 90% of the decisions without consulting with Havana,
explaining that: "this is the reason I am here."

10, Above all, RUIZ directs constant and bitter criticisa
¢ of what he terns the ‘inconpcterice there.
meneralized incompctence’ will cause CASTRO
purge after the 1970 harvest is in. (He
fio one in Havana wants to make any
sort of decision"). One of his favorite books is The Pct er
Principle, to which he refers constantly, and he uses this
Hook to describe what is going on.in Iavana, In RUIZ" view,
Havana is always trying to interfere with the Embassy in
Madrid, a situation which results in a lack of; coordination
and cooperation, RUIZ directs the same criticism against his
staff in Madrid, beeause his personnel lack qualifications for
the jobs they hold,. He once told an associate: "They think
that I’m a fool, but I don't miss anything they do.”

In his opinion, this

specifically repeats that

JJ, In turn, he has also been the target of criticism

from Havana, first from Zoila COM (2), who made a critical evalu-
ation of the Embass. RUIZ’ reaction is instructiv "TE decided
not to answer it, I took a librium, smoked a cigar, and forgot
all about it.” On another occasion he complained to Aristides

- DIAZ that he had received another critical report from Havana

am for the Embassy. Havana was complaining
RUIZ noted that the Embassy

had accomplished much that was not in the plan,
to answer that particular criticism in detail.

12, Perhaps the most serious criticism of his activities
came in.a coded cable received by the Embassy carly in October
1969, Havana questioned the way that RUIZ was handling the com-
mercial treaty negotiations with Spanish authorities. Ina
communication directed to Raul. LEON Torres (201-725624) (Under
Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Commerce) and in rather
strong language, RUIZ defended his right to be informed and
consulted on the matter, denying that his cable number 521 was
offensive to Joaquin ALVAREZ (Director of Trade with Western
Europe and North. America), who was evideutly the source of

_-eriticism against RUIZ.

“else. We believes that he is "burned'! in Spain, He bas said ©

that when he returns to the island, he will definitely not
return to his Ministry. +

SECURITY AND SECURITY-CONSCIOUSNESS

15, RUIZ seems to be particularly sensitive in the area
of security-consciousness.. This attitude can possibly be traces
to an involvement with the DGI in one vay or another, but his
background and espsciaily his political views (see below)
would appear to argue. egainst his affiliation. RUIZ is quick to
warn visiting Cubans nst the efforts of what he terms "Ja
compania, sociedad anc: "to compromise them, even before
they eave Tavana, RUIZ’ possible belief in the
omnipresence and power of the sociedad i He censors mail
going to and coming fron Hava atedly states that
his office is bugyed, tis tclcphone is tapped, and that he is
followed quite openly rzercver he goes. He attibutes this
surveillance to the Szzuridad, and he probably ascribes it to
the Spanish. (Note THEt, despite his “knowledge” that his words
go to hostile surveillance, he still dares to express critical

opinions openly).

16. This security-consciousness is apparently the big
reason he has asked Havana for funds for a new Embassy building,
where he plans to have a shiclded room free from bugs. He: intends
to have Havana send electricians for the job and Cubaa personnel
to act as doormen, etc., with the vives of the latter to be his
char force. He scems fanatic on the subject of not having any
Spanish personnel in ths building. (Note that one Sr. VILLARROYA,
of Constructiones Aznar in Madrid, is handling the real estate

operation, ) ;

17, RUIZ is particularly aware of what he calls “traps.”
He once recalled that he had been asked to dinner by the wife
of a VIP and, after accepting the invitation, was told that a
priest would also att Ne did not attend the dinner,

19. RUIZ has even suggested installing a radio transmitter
and speaking in code with Havana, The Cubans are in fact
installing @ transmitter oh the Canary Islands, but RUIZ,
charactcristically keeping-his actions correct, has stressed
to the Spanish that Cuba will-not use the transmitter for other
than legitimate commercial purposes. RUIZ even offercd to allow-————
Spanish citizens to operate’ the station in order to emphasize

his point.

20. Correct as he gencrally is in his professional
behavior, RUIZ made what appears to be a mistake in discussing
with members of his staff the possibility of telling Havana that
A Spanish foreign service officer scheduled for duty there (Juan
TORROBA Gomez, ef, OSMA-25692) might be open for recruitment. “If
one ‘recalls RUIZ' constant warnings that his office is bugged by
Soguridad, the discussion about TORROBA clearly exposes him to
action by the Spanish authorities,

21, RUIZ“ himself is the target of what appears to be
control by Juan Antonio CURBELO Lemus (201-7335:44) who is
allegedly the First Secretary in charge of cultural affairs
but who secms to be the "security ma in the Enbassy. (We
note that CURBELO's photograph was shown to ANBEDEW-1, who did
not recognize the likeness). RUIZ has complained at least once
that he needs a'“real" cultural attache. CURBELO has instructed
the front-desk girl to pass on to him a sumnary of who secs whom
at the Embassy and for what purpose, including RUIZ' visitors.
(Given RUIZ’ near-mania for running his own shop, CURBELO must

indeed exert an acknowledged security control).

_ 22, Despite security considerations, however, RUIZ appears
addicted to taking automobile jaunts by himself to the interior

of the country, He must have very powerful reasons to do so, for he

is probably exposing himself to attack by Cuban exiles. Given the
reception accorded to Carlos ALFARAS, Armando HART, and Carlos

CHAIN at the Barajas airport in June 1968, RUIZ might be :
unnecessarily exposing himself. He has not told anyone of

where he gocs or what he does, and both his. wife and CURBELO

strongly disapprove of his custom.

23. RUIZ" Wife is Nilda VECIANA, who was reported on in
UFGA-19006, She,is probably in her carly thirties. She is

well with the wives of other Cubans on the’ staff.

26, RUIZ' children are:

a. -Guillernito. He is the oldest and ig now ‘
studying in Havana. Thore were reports that he was
unhappy there, and RUIZ asked on 16 October 1969 to.go
to Havana to settle a personal problem with Guillermito,
If there were a problem, it seems to have been solved,
because RUIZ on his return quoted Guillermito as being
very happy in his new school. (Some time ago, Mrs. Hector
GALLO Portieles was constantly ncedling the other women
about not being “revolutionary” enough and took Nilda
RUIZ totask for having her children with her instead of
at school in Cuba, The RUIZ fanily had brought four of
their children with them, and later the other(s) came
to join them, before the older onc returned to school.
RUIZ once told 2 visitor that Guillermito had been
left with his grandparents during their exile in Miami
and had been very resentful of it, so they had been
very careful ever since not to repeat that mistake).

28. Aside. from the two-year statistics course taken in

Spanish) to the Embassy staff.

29, RUIZ appears to be sensitive to art, and he frequently
complains about the general lack of culture in Cuba. (This
might indicate thatRUIZ considers himself “above" the Revolution).
He shows some of the general inconsistencies of the self-educated,
For exarple, his vocabulary level is rather low, and he curses
frequently when talking to other male members of the staff. On
the other hand, he scems rather well versed in international
affairs and has a good understanding of international trade. It
is probable that he has’ read soxc of the works of José Marti and,
although he dictates letters to his secretary, he types some of
his own reports to Havana,

HEALTH PROBLEMS

30. RUIZ suffers from what his wife has described as a liver
illness (not further specified) for which he takes a medicine
called bilidis. (This may refer simply to the medical words for
"liver disease". Competent. experts here guess that the medicine
is used for anything from chronic constipation to gassiness
and constant eructation because of inadequate digestion of fatty
foods, It is possible that RUIZ suffers from the hard~to-pin-down
mal de foie, which can be found in a high-strung, hard-driving
person. RUIZ' evident use of 2ibrium (sce above) might also

suggest this condition).

3). Late in 1969 RUIZ was planning to go to Portugal to
rest, folloy ation of his physician Dr.
received as , and whose telephone number appears
to be + There ts also a mention of a Dr. PERIU, but his
relationship is indistinct. RUIZ coughs frequently, is used to
cold weather, and was planning to go for his health to the same
Ginnasio as his son, Alejandro.

32. A July 1968 mcrorandum for the record stated that RUIZ
suffers from a spinal ailment resulting from a fall he had about
12 years.ago. Since then he has had chronic backaches which were
particularly severe during the time that he was in the U.S.,
Maiti, and Santo Domingo, Nis pains have recurred since he’ -
arrived in. Spain. On 3 June 1968 he had a severe attack and was



treated by the ssy's Spanish doctor VILLALANDA (mt), who
prescribed corti as incurable,
since it vas doubted that’ the injury to his spine could be
corrected by-an operation, RUIZ was further told that the
condition would continue to grow worse, and that within six to
ten years he would have a defective walk. RUIZ planned to scnd
the diagnosis and X-rays to ROA in Havana, who would pass them to
the Cuban specialist MARTINEZ-PAZ for review.

TRAVELS cf 5 i
33. Following are the trips RUIZ-is known to: have made during
the last quarter of 1969; :

“a. To Bilboa, San Sebastian, and Burgos by car,
on 28 November’ 1969, returning two days later.

b. To Havana, to settle "a personal problem," on
20 October 1969 via Iberia (first class), returning to
Madrid on 29 October,

¢. To London on 14 November for consultations with
Raul LEON Torres, returning two days later by air,

d. To Italy with his family on vacation on 28 December
to pick up an AlfA Romero that he boight for the Embassy,
returning by car and arriving in Madrid on 6 January 1970,

CTS IN MADRID

34. Little is known about RUIZ' contacts in Madrid. Aside.
from the Algerian Ambassador (see above), we know about: 2

a. Pedro RUIZ. A good friend who goes to RUIZ’
home frequently, According to RUI%, Pedro is quite
influcntial and is a friend of MASSO(?).

ptetibandasea eds

b. Carlos CARRASCO. Another person who calls
RUIZ frequently. In late October or early November 1969
CARRASCO went to New York.

¢. Rosendo CANTO (201-749310). CANTO lives at Goya
54, Madrid. His friendship with RUIZ is interesting, given
CANTO’s background, because their being together could be |“
very dangerous for RUIZ unless he were using CANTO for
some rcason with the approval of Havana, CANTO wants to go
to Havana for a year, live there for a year, and then join. the
Cuban Foreign Service. Referring to CANTO's desire, RUIZ
said on & January 1970: "He is a fool!

CHARACTER

35. Superficially, RUIZ scens to be an easy-going and rather
simple man who no doubt enjoys the prestige and pusition he has
and the stccesses he has had professionally in Spain, He appears
to have a strong character and probably -plays the predominant
role in his marriage. He arid his wife scem to get along very well

+ Acertauin degree of racism can be detected. in his
t reference to blacks as "niches," a disr cetful

37. RUIZ almost never discusses women with his colleagues,
except for one off moment. when he mentioned a girl he knew :
din the United States-before. the Revolution, Perhaps RUIZ wisely
remenbers that Nilda ‘also works at the Embassy and refrains
from mentioning women 6n her account.- In any case, he is not
known to be involved in any extramarital affair. (Still, one
wondérs about the custom of absenting himself by automobile
into the interior of Spain). :

38. His habits seem to be simple: he likes movies; he
has read Topaz (but made no comment thercon); and he receives
people at “his home for cocktails.

POLITICAL AND. IDEOLOGICAL VIEWS

39, Although outwardly a "Revolutionary," RUIZ gives much
more the appearance of a man with uoderate political views
struggling to justify to himself the actions of his government,
especially in view of the political and economic realities of
his country, It is possible that his feclings might lie
closer to the theory of the "betrayed revolution” ---but not
for strictly ideological reasons. The incompetence of the
Cuban governrental bureaucracy, for example, has sabotaged the

revolution,
40, In the first place, RUIZ definitely does not seem

to be a Marxist and consequently he cannot accept the role of
"robot" (his term) required by Party discipline and vertical

structure,

a, On 29 December 1969 he wrote to Telesforo
DIAZ Portillo, a MINREX cfficizl: "Revolutionaries
should net be coerced by forms of politica] control.”

bd. On 11 December 1969 he told a visiting
Agropecuario official from Havana that: " ... if I
disagree with orders, I question them because I am
not a robot nor do I have the. mentality of one. As
a human being I express opinions no matter what the
risk that I tiay have to accept personally.”

“41, Aside. fro the constant criticism of Havana's incompe-
tence, Jack of vision, and lack of realism, he is quick to point

out the-deficlencics of. life in Cuba as reflected in hig directive
to his: Embassy staff not to celebrate Christmas together, because
“there ave tiungry pcople at home. RUIZ has also said that medicine

in general is quite backward in Cuba.

42, Although he is probably an athdbst (or likes to think
; of himself as one), -he ‘is kiiown to believe that "religion. should
not be considered a handicap for persons. trying to return to Cuba."
‘Ne docs not hide his-views of the American people, cither, for
he describes Americans as "frank" and "simple", "They treated
me very.well," he told Raul LEON Torres in December 1969. On the
ether hand, he refers to Latin American diplomats as bootlickers
becatise they use the. English language at parties, and he has
remarked that "capitalism is no food

43. Ie seems to have a certain admiration for General
‘Francisco FRANCO, of whom RUIZ has said: "FRANCO is the only
reason that Spain is not Communist." RUIZ also called FRANCO
"one of the few most brilliant politicians of all time." These
seem like strange words for a man as security-conscious as he.

44, He appears to be well-informed on international matters.
Some of his views are contradictory at times, but they characterize
him as what might, be called an undecided realist:

a, "Cuba is a political power, not a military or
economic power."

b. "The USSR has neutralized US sea power in the
Mediterranean,” ;

es. "Cuba can destroy Guantanamo whenevér it chooses

to do so, although the base has lost its strategic value
to ‘the United States.” .

d. "US-China rappronchment should be feared, but
also a Japan-China alliance.”

e. “US power is beginning to crumble, but the
Soviets are revisionists."

£. "The Egyptians harm us when they buy sugar from
Cuba and then resc}l to other countries.”



-l-

. + "We have to be ow the side of the Soviets

for two reasons: first fromthe military and economle
point of view; secondly, because, whether right or
Wrong, they are ‘on the same side fighting those who
wre on-the other side." :

h. "Cuba has had and now has major discrepancies
with the USSR, China, -and the US, but we.are on the
side of communism because we .are against capitalism,"

1.. The following coments of the Cuban Minister to
Spain, Guillerco RUIZ Perez, reflect Cuban thoughts on the
z ovakian situation:

. The Soviet occupation of Czechoslovakia has’ been
& disaster; however, criticizing the Soviet action
would mean taking sides with the Asericans. A friend
may be criticized in private but pablicly be should be
defended. (QUDOZE, 19 November.) The Cubans have to
side with the Soviets for military and economic reasons.
and because, whether right or wrong, they belong to the
sane ideological group. Cubn had aad still has enormous
discrepancies with the Soviet Union, China, and the United
States but weighing the differences Cuba is with Communiss
and cpposed to Capitalisn. (QUDOZE, 3 November.)

PROCESING ACTION

_[MRKLO FOR POETS,

1. of possible interest addres: és is’ a “translation of
the following letter dictated by Guillermo RUIZ Perez to his
secretory on 26 December 1969. The letter was addressed to a
comrade \CUZA’ or -LANUZA (fon)'! in Havana~in-response to a confi-
dential ‘note recéived by RUIZ from Havana.

if "In relation to your confidential note number

7240 about the Spanish prisoners, Joaquin AUVI Casals,
Lazaro GARRIDO Sanchez and Antonio MARQUEZ Pedraza, whose
release was requested in a note from the Spanish Embassy
in Havana,’ I would Tike to tell you the following:
Firstly, Senor Joaquin AUVI’ Casals was of interest to
D. Pedro SALVADOR de Vicente; but because of the bad
record and activities of this man, it was understood
that his departure would be denied....J.talked to Pedro
SALVADOR about this matter and upon mentioning this
man's background he told me that his interest was due
to a phone call he had received from a friend of his in
Miami. He considers that, given the background in this
case, his friend was supposedly an instrument of "other
interests". Secondly, regarding the other Spaniards,
we have no objection whatsoever to their departing the
country. Without anything of further consequence,....."

1. On 23 September 1969 the Cuban Minister to Spain,
Guillermo Ruiz’ Perez, called on Pedro Salvador
de Vicente, the Special Delegate for LatiN American Affairs.
in the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affa to discuss the
forthcoming tradé negotiations in Cuba ing the discussion
Salvador told Ruiz that the one and only question which con-
cerns the Spanish Government is ‘that of Cuban indemnifications
and pensions ‘for Spanish employees, and he asked Ruiz what the
latter could say regarding this probiem. (Field Comment: The
-indemnifications refer to property owned by Spanish nationals
which was confiscated by the Cuban Government.) Ruiz claimed
that ke had no instructions on what he could say, adding that
the claims were numerous and that the paperwork involved was
difficult and required a great deal of time.

2. Salvador told Ruiz that the subject of indemnifica-
tions and pensions must be discussed during the forthcoming
negotiations, and that the Cuban Government must provide at
least an approximate figure.of what it is going to pay. He
said that the indemnification figure must be based on the. ae
value of the expropriated properties; less the amount of any
taxes levied om ‘the properties. (Source Comment: Salvador
did not say what would happen if the Cuban Government failed
to reach some agreement on the question but he implied that
negotiations would be delayed until the Spanish: Foreign
Ministry received the ‘Cuban Government's reply to this Meera
question.) (Field Comment: Since the conversation between :
Salvador and Ruiz was held before the recent change of the
Spanish Cabinet and-other, Government positions, there is no

Special Delegate for Latin American Affairs.)

(Field Comment:

“and”pensions problem had not emergéd ‘as ‘or ie
“the negotiations for.a new ‘trade agreenent. -There has been
“a gradual deterioration of Spanish-Cuban commercial ‘relations
since the conclusion in May of preparatory negotiations for
a new. agreement, but this deterioration ostensibly ‘was the
result of.a Spanish Government decision to reduce Cuban sugar
imports over the. next three years. The Cuban Government
appareftly:had not considered such decision in its analysis
.of Cuban=Spanish commercial relations, and it was quite-
upset when’ ‘the decision was revealed during the preparatory
negotia’ ns,', Some of the problems. causing.the'strain in
Spanish+Cuban relations were previously reported in

Comments “of AMAUTO-1 on Current Topics of Interest
cia a et ; ;

The following comments of AMAUTO-1 reflect Cuban thoughts
on the Czechoslovaquian Situation, internal Spanish politics,
and the effects of recent. changes ‘in the Spanish Government
onthe. impending ‘trade. negotiations between Spain and Cuba.

as The Soviet occupation of Czechoslovakia has‘
been a disaster; however, criticizing the Soetes action
would mean taking sides with the Americans. A friend
sexo ee ct iticized in. private but publicly he shold ve
Gefended.” (QUDQZE, 19 November.). ‘The Cubans hove to
Side with the Soviets for military and economic reasons
and because, whether right or wrong, they belong to the
diecraectosical camp. “Cuba had and still has onosmece
discrepancies with the Soviet Union, China, and’ the
United States but weighing the differences Cuba 4c with

‘ Communism as opposed to Capitalism. (QuDOZE, 3 November.)

b. AMAUTO-1 was asked by his government to report
on the new Spanish Government which Havana calle "Opus
Dei". To a visiting Cuban official he admitted that
he was at a loss to understand Spanish politics but
attempted to define them. It is not true that the
Spanish Government is in the hands of the Opus Dei.

There are’ some men in the government who lean, toward the
Opus Dei but there are others of a very diftorane leaning
because they come from the Falangist ranks. These men
(the Falangistsy may go along with the Opus Dei line
because: they allow themselves to be "carried by the tide"
but they are not of the Opus Det. (QUDOZE, 19 November.)

¢.. Concerning the impending trade negotiations
with Spain, in addition to the economic problem the
Cubans are now faced with another. impediment which
further delays the negotiations: the recent changes
in the Spanish goveésament. It-ds difficult at this
time for the:Cubans to approach any Spanish official
because'of the climate of confusion among them. Most
Spanish officials have no idea.as to whether they will
remain’in-their posts or will be replaced. Therefore,

‘it ds‘futile for the Cubans to press them for action

on the negotiations. ‘The most they can do is wait

patiently until the situation is normalized. If the
“negotiations are not‘held within the 30-day expiration

period of the agreement, it is possible that the present
agreement. can be exténded. for two months. This would

be advantageous tothe Cubans because during the first
two months of. the year they.will be ablé to acquire 412
the goods they will need for 1970. (QUDOZE,. 19 November).

the activities of the Spanish Embassy there (in Cuba) which could
be very useful to us in our relations (with the Spaniards). _ Defore

Mri*Torroba and; in ‘addition to confirming the good opinion that

and that from this.angle he could be influenced despite his

Director of Consular. Affairs (in the Spanish Foreign Ministry)
was actually that ‘of advisor on-consular matters but he exercised
no authority. The idea of helping him in his. work is apt and
could be carried to the point where some officer like himself

(of -siailar category) could intimidate him in such a way that

vould serve our purposes. There is no doubt that an attack
against Sr. Torroba in the way of making his task more difficult
would bring as an immediate result a greater influence on the
part of thoso who are interested in having him become a (word

even in the event that his work shculd not prove to be the best,
that another officer could bo substituted that (word or words

4. As'a recruitment target, hovever, AHAUTO-1 seems to °
present serious difficulties, He is strong-ainded, opinionated,
idealistic, aad apparently committed to the revolution. On, the
other hand, there are certain things about him which could be
converted into recruitment vulncrabilitics. First arene these
“48 bis apparent belief tnat the regime (read: the Revolution)
AS Not making-the ‘best use of his talents. Qne cannot tell |
precisely cvethér. this is the ¢ause or result of his apparent
‘basic emots nat instability. During: public appearancés he
‘displays polished manners and a ‘pro-regiae attitude; in private
he frequently complains to Hig subordiantes that he did not ask
for a diplomatic position, that he-would prefer an industrial
Job, and’ that he believes his’ position to be more a handicap
than a promotion. Seconalys he obviously desires personal

Prestige and luxurtou ving. While these traits do not. mean
‘S0-much {nthe ¢ase.of a Cuban as compared toa Soviet or
hardsh. onomic.-misihanagement in Cuba..do in

ith his basic’ impulses. ‘Thirdly, his

ent has been diagonséd as incurable. Wille this
he-ghould realize that further: exami

a @en (while on a training mission in WOLADY,

3) .could help him’ considérably.. There may even be other

vulnerabilities which further target study could expose,

1H 5. We present: these: thoughts at the same t
are fully aware of other operational pressures ee
time and assets. Nevertheless, we would apprecia don's
comments on further development of AMAUTO=1 as an in-place
recruitnent target. ‘The firat need would be the Proper access
agent, someone with a-Jesuit-like intellectual training who can
deal with him in the reala of concepts and philoscphy as required.
In any case, we would like continued target reporting on AMAUTO-1,
