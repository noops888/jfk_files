MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of security

SUBJECT:

FILE

komard Aunt /kor

I have discussed the point raised by you with Mr. Helms

and while we agree in principle, we believe that there is

sufficient gain from the contact and certain pieces of

information to take the calculated risk of continuing this

until 30 June, at which time she would normally be

expecting to separate herself from such responsibility in

anticipation of the expected birth of a child some time

around August 1963. I have so informed Mr. Hunt.
