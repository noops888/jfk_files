in ‘their countries as contacts and sources for CIA. Angleton indicated that C!
had successfully developed several sources through this means. He stressed -|—
the confidential nature of his information and stated that while other officials ‘of

‘FBI, he was passing this along for our guidance,

New York have flushed out a most secret operation of CIA. The question
immediately arises as to whether CIA in effecting this coverage in New York
has invaced our jurisdiction. In this regard, it is believed that they have a
legitimate right in the objectives for which the coverage was set up, namely, |
the development of contacts and sources of information behind the Iron ‘Curtain
and-according to Angleton they have had some success. in this regard, At the’
same time, there is an internal security objective here in which, because of -
our responsibilities, we have a definite interest, namely, the identification of
illegal espionage agents who may be in the United States. While recognizing’ ©
this interest, it is not believed that the Bureau should assume this coverage

to share their coverage with us... Of course, we are not interested in the j
identities of the numerous persons in this country legitimately corresponding |
abroad. The Post Office has indicated there are approximately four thousand H

The group "C3325" is.our own internal filing ‘number. .

The "Name In" entry identifies the correspondent inside the( USSR,

The asterisk in "Ref" column indicates that OVAN)sent the lettex;

“The "Name Out'! entry identifies the correspondent outside the

The absence of an asterisk in the "Ref" column after EVOSWA

The code key used for this. column is set out in Enclosure 4, You

The absence of an ''X" in the "Ban"! column means, that the letter
‘was not opened and that only the exterior is recorded in'our files.

who is believed to be located in| ‘oscow} only the listing as set out
