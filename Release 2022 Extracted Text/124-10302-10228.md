Cuban, PEDRO LUIS DIAZ LANZ had requested permission to be

interviewed with an attorney present and that this request

had been granted.

Mr. THOMAS: HAZLETT, CIA representative in Mexico

Ity, furnished the following information which he said had C

seen forwarded to CIA headquarters with respect to the

FRANK INORINI, PEDRO LUIS DIAZAANZ and RICARDO

DE LAXORIL BALS had arrived in Mexico City on 10/27/58,

after

having traveled from the Miami,

Florida, area by

automobile and having encountered difficulty with Mexican

Immigration authorities upon entering Mexico. HAZLETT did

not know their Mexican port of entry but stated that they

had been in Monterrey; therefore, he concluded that they had

crossed the border at Brownsville or Laredo,

yes and that

they must have entered Mexico 10/24,25 or 10/26/58.

Follow

ing the arrival of the trio in Mexico City, DIAL LANe and

DE LA LORIE proceeded by air to Venezuela returning about

10/31/58. Shortly thereafter they again left Mexiço

by air enroute to San Francisco, California.

Meanwhile, on 11/4/58, FIORINI departed from Mexico

city in the automobile and is reported i have met DiAl LANk

and DE LA LORIE at Yuma, Arizona.

On 11/8/58,

they are reported to have been at the

Highway House Motel at Phoenix, Arizona. (HAZLETT believed C

From Phoenix, Arizona, the group flew the airplane

to Veracruz

and

Acapulco, Mexico, before proceeding to

Apatzingan.

Ix. HAZLETT

Coressed the belief that some member

of the

Caban

group may have advised Mexican military

authorities regarding the truckload of arms and the

airplane.

He added that to the best of his knowledge,

photograph of FRANK FIORINI standing on some oi the graves

Of BATISTA fOllowers who had been executed by the triumphant

HAZLET TC

sLated that ClA sources had advised that

FIORINI appeared to be a "New York Italian gangster type"*

who spoke only broken Spanish and with what appeared to

be an Italian accente

Inquiry at the Office of the Federal Attorney

General, Mexico, D. F, developed information to the effect

that all investigation in this case was conducted by the

prosecutive and juaicial authorities at Morelia, Michoacan.

In view of the fact that investigative informants of this

oifice have considerable difficulty in checking official

records in

action has the stelayed incho da posite too take this

investigation to be conducted by personnel of this office

or an investigative informant who has adequate credentials

for that purpose.

From the foregoing data concerning FIORINI, it

appears that he is probably identical with subject FRANK

ANTHONY STURGIS. It also appears possible, in view of

FIORINI'S reported presence in Cuba, the question of his

identity may already have been fully clarified.

Will explore the possibilities of obtaining the

results of interviews of FIORINI by Mexican authorities and

any information which can be obtained concerning the outcome

of

the arrest of FIORINI and the group of Cubans.
