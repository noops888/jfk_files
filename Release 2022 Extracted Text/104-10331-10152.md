Pending ARRB (JFK Board) Issues

Per your request at our 1 April bi-weekly

meeting, we have summarized below the significant issues which
are under deliberation and negotiation with the JFK Board. Our
approach on protecting Agency equities is multi-step:

° First, with the staff, we argue relevance although the statute and
implementing regulations define ‘‘assassination records’’ very
broadly as including

* (1) any records related to the assassination or Oswald,

* (2) any records concerning the various conspiracy theories, and

e (3) any records within the scope of previous investigations
including the Church Committee, Pike Committee, Warren
Commission, or House Select Committee on Assassinations
(sca) ,*

¢ Second, with the staff, we argue that release would cause current
damage although the exemptions under the JFK statute are much
narrower than the corresponding exemptions under the FOIA, and

© Third, if we fail to convince the staff, we must proceed to a more
detailed and formal presentation to the Board.

2

(AIUO) It is the materials collected by the HSCA which are the most

numerous and often the most troublesome in terms of sensitive equities. They
are generally referred to as the ‘‘sequestered collection.’

ISSUE 1 -- Unacknowledged Covert Actions :
2. (8S) Within records surfaced by the Ford Library is a
document -- a Helms Memorandum for

-- which contains references to CIA’ 7

3. (S) After much negotiation, the ARRB staff has agreed
to recommend to the Board that the information related to those
covert actions be considered non-related and the documents
designated ~“Not Believed Related'' (NBR). The document. will be
grouped with similar ~“NBR'' documents and be presented to {the
Board for final action at the 13 April or 12 May meeting. ‘

ISSUE 2 -- Alias Documentation and Accommodation Addresses

4.  (S) The security file of former Agency employee, David
Morales (deceased -- true name already released), within the
sequestered collection contains documentation on five of his
alias. We anticipate similar problems as we re-review other
security files within the sequestered collection. We are
attempting to work a compromise with the following elements but
details have yet to be finalized:

* protect all references to Official] documents reflecting the alias
such as (Social security cards, drivers licenses)

e release items designated as pocket litter such as club cards,

* protect elements of accommodation addresses to avoid identifying
specific locations, and

* lastly, make a decision to actually release or protect the alias
itself depending on the timeframe and its importance to the JFK
story.

5. (8S) However, disagreements on the actual implementation
(e.g., protect house number but release street name of

accommodation address) have prevented a final resolution at this
time. We are also exploring with the DO senior management~'
whether the blanket release of pocket litter (whether (lawfully
obtained | a } might present media or operational issues
today. Accordingly, we have requested that the issue be
postponed until the May meeting.

ISSUE 3 -- Organizational Materials

6. (S) This request (one of the earliest and known as CIA-
1) asked for organization charts on various Agency directorates
and/or components for the years 1958-1968. All Agency“
directorates provided material responsive to the request arid ‘the
ARRB staff has selected items for inclusion’ in the. JFK

ecOttection. Remaining at issue are three DO charts -- a 1961
generjc DDP organization, a 1263 generic DDP organization, and a
fet: ed JMWAVE organization. The DO has agreed to release the

first two and remain adamantly opposed to the release of the
JMWAVE chart given its similarity to current organizational
plans.

7.. (S) This issue will be presented by ARRB staff to the
Board at the 13 April meeting where they will recommend that the
DDP generic charts be accepted (good for CIA) and that the JMWAVE
chart be declared as an assassination record (bad for CIA); an
actual vote by the Board will not take place until the May
meeting.

ISSUE 4 -- Mexico City Tapes

8. (S) This request asked for a thorough search of Agency
files and documents for and CIA *‘... surveillance ‘take’ from
Cuban and Soviet facilities in Mexico City at the time of the
Oswald visit and in the immediate wake of the assassination. ’’
Among the items provided by the DO were five boxes containing
audio tapes from telephone taps on the Cuban and Russian
embassies and facilities. A number of the tapes are dated 22

November 1963;_ many others are dated 23 November 1963 through
December 1963.° a

9. (8S) This is one of the most complex requests because of
the following facts:

* at one time, there was a tape of Oswald in existence but it has
since been lost or erased;

* the relevance of these tapes is argued to be only to prove that no

tape in existence today contains the Oswald gonversst ion;

° {this was not an unilateral operation but xather a joke bs saree

7

ith the Mexican Government;
iat

* there is a confidential request from the ARRB{to the Mexican )
{Government} for any opies of the actual/Oswald conversation they
may possess; and,

® = quite obviously, the sensitivity is not so much the mere fact that
we possess such tapes but our confirmation of the extent and our
release of the actual conversations captured.

10. (S) The good news, at least at this time, is that the
ARRB staff has agreed to postpone Board consideration until May
and, in the interim, the Agency will have an opportunity to
review (i.e., listen and transcribe) and determine the
sensitivity and provide detailed arguments in this regard.

ISSUE 5 -- Protection of (LITAMIL-9 )

11. (S) (GITAMIL-9)was a CIA penetration 6F

inadvertently released in 1993 and, as a result, (he was )

* (s) The scope of this request is quite significant; it includes five boxes

of 185 tapes from operations against both the Cuban and Russian Embassy.

additional documents with his name/crypt in them. That will now
occur at the May meeting of the Board. It is, however, unlikely
that the Board would agree to delay release until 2017, however,

there is precedent for delaying release of records on individuals
for shorter periods or until death.

ISSUE 6 Richard Gibson et)

1I3.. (S) Since then, the ARRB has agreed to delay the
elease of any additional information until the Agency. and FBI
had determined the full extent of the files on Gibson and the
potential damage. The issue is scheduled for ARRB action at the
May meeting and. our objective is to release Gibson's role in the
JFK assassination story while protecting his relationship with

the Agency; however, the. FBI has a four volumes file which covers
jboth FBI interest and Gibson's relationship with the Agency. We
will be working in detail with the ARRB staff and the FBI on this

[approach./

ISSUE 7 -- Certain Files of CIA Officials

office files of the individual occupying the following positions
during the period 1959-1964."’ é

* The chronological files of C. Tracy Barnes, 1959-1964
* Office of General Counsel, Lawrence Houston, 1959-1964."
e Operational Diaries of William Harvey 1962-1963.

This request will by its very breadth require significant time on
the part of the directorate (and DCI) IROs. While it may appear
overly broad, we have developed a methodology with the ARRB staff
which provides the access required by the Board but guarantees
that their review is focused: In sum, we work from shelf lists
to narrow the selection and then conduct file review sessions——
with the ARRB staff; if material requested is particularly
sensitive, access can be limited to the ARRB Executive, Director
or members of the Board. This effort will continue for some
time. : ”

Conclusion
poe

15. (AIUO) At the present time, over 40 persons are
involved. in the JFK records review and we anticipate that this
level of effort may increase by 25% in the coming months as we
near the statutory end of the Board (30 September 1998)..
However, even if the Board is not extended (and it has been
extended previously), there are statutory tasks for CIA which
will extend 12-18 months beyond the end of the Board's existence.
Your continued support is critical.
