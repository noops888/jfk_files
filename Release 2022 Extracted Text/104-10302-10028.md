c. The chargé has no informa-
tion on the motives behind this
switch. Our embassy thinks it may
be a move to pave the way for explora-
tory talks by Foreign Minister Suband-
rio at Bangkok with his Thai and
Philippine counterparts. It may also
be meant to provide a more recep-
tive attitude for Nasution's visit
here.

d. Our embassy thinks Nasution
went in for his Malaysia sabre rat-
tling on Sukarno's orders, or at
the very least, with the president's
tacit support. Sukarno may feel
Nasution has stolen some of his
thunder.

a. Adoula still did not get
around to announcing the expulsion
of all Soviet and Czech embassy per-
sonnel yesterday. However, his
people managed on Tuesday afternoon
to corral and hog-tie the Soviet
counselor and press attaché before
they could eat-up all the incrimin-
ating papers in their possession.

b. The Russians are now being

c. The Belgian ambassador \\

genuine. He says the Russians have \
made the mistake of underrating the \

Congolese and have stumbled into a |

d. The Congolese also picked
up two Czech diplomats but have since
released them. This morning they
arrested the correspondent of the
Soviet news agency.

a. Haile Selassie is planning
to withdraw all Ethiopian troops
from the Congo in January,

b. The two battalions of
Ethiopians provide the guts of the
UN operation, They had been slated
to stay until June and are likely to
be very difficult to replace.

c. The Emperor reportedly
ordered the withdrawal on grounds
that. the troops are urgently needed
in Ethiopia, particularly in view
of the Soviet military accord with
Somalia,

d. Our ambassador has asked
to see the Emperor, as well as the
prime minister and foreign minister,

~~____._to press for reconsideration.

b. Egypt still has about 32,000

troops in Yemen, and
believes Nasir will ‘|
not withdraw any significant number
of them before 4 January when the |

extension of the disengagement agree-
ment expires.

c. Faysal is preparing to re- |

in Sunday's nationwide local, elec-

appears increasingly likely. Though
a new coalition may be formed, there
will. be considerable resistance to
the retention of Inonu as prime min-

bitterly lampooning Nasir, espe-

b. Such public expression of
anti-Nasir sentiment is highly
unusual.

ce. It is still in a very low
key, however, and there is no sign
of organized opposition.

d. We do not consider Nasir '
to be in any immediate danger of
overthrow, though he could be forced
to modify unpopular policies if the
discontent spreads.

Vice President Lechin, who has been

South Vietnam

a. Vietnamese Communist ef-
forts to discredit the new Saigon
regime stayed in high gear this
week. :

b. The number of armed attacks
was off from the high of the previous
week but still some 50% above the
year's weekly average.

c. These attacks have been,

for the most part, small-scale efforts
directed against the government's
paramilitary forces in the villages.
They have bees designed more for
their psychological impact than for
immediate nilitary gain.

d. & high volume of messages
on Viet Cong nilitary and political
commmications nets indicates a prob-
able continuation of this effort.

e. The new gowernment is re-
sponding ty stepping up its own
military sperations. It is also
setting about the hard job of re-
vamping the Diem government apparatus
and harnessing broader popular sup-
port for the war effort.

their new responsibilities. There
are, however, a few signs of dissen-
sion within this group and between
it and civilian politicians.

g. One of the more ambitious
and troublesome figures is the able
but opportunistic General Ton That
Dinh, the new Minister of Security.
He has been travelling about the
country spreading the idea that the
coup was largely his doing and seems
bent on developing his own independ-
ent base of power. He is a man to
watch.

h. The new regime has also
_ embarked on a purge of high military
officers who sided with Diem during
the Buddhist crisis.and failed to
get on the right side soon enough.
(INTERCEPTS)

a. The death toll from the
terrorist outburst in Caracas last
Tuesday and Wednesday now stands at
about 30.

b. This is the high water mark
thus far in the campaign of the
Castro-supported Communist extremist:
to disrupt the national elections a
week from tomorrow.

c. The Betancourt government
has. struck back hard. Its new uni-
fied command over the security forces,
passed this
initial test with flying colors.

d. At least 500 extremists
were arrested and the round-up is
still going on. Their removal will
hamper the Communist drive against i
elections in major cities like Caracas,

e. We now expect the elections
to be held on schedule, a consider-
able achievement under the circun-
stances. The elections will be fol-
lowed, however, by a Communist ef-
fort to prevent the March inaugura-
tion of the victor.

f£. The rub here is that none
of the presidential candidates com-
mands President Betancourt's con-
siderable assets for dealing success-
fully with the harsh realities of
Venezuelan politics. The constitu-
tion prevents Betancourt from suc-
ceeding himself,

always, looms the military, which

elect shows signs of being soft on

this weekend to the air corridors.

b. The Soviet man at the Ber-
lim air traffic control center told
the Allied representatives yesterday
that Soviet transports would be using
the air corridors for brief flights
during the next five weekends.

c. Moscow has tried on a num-
ber sf past occasions to assert its
right to restrict Allied use of the

_ air corridors. In early 1962, the
Soviets attempted to reserve "blocks"
of air space for their own use. They
have since demanded that Western
fligtts stay between stipulated al-
titudes, that we file flight plans
in advance and provide prior notice
of berder-crossing times.

da. This sort of harassment
stopped in the spring of 1962 when
Soviet leaders became convinced”
that the US was interested in a
serious discussion of a Berlin settle-
ment. Moscow may hope that the
threat of more of this sort of har-
assment. will jog the US into talks oe
on Berlin,

a. It now appears that Presi-
dent Arif's role in last Monday's
coup in Baghdad may have been vir-
tually that of a bystander. Hl

ce. Whatever Arif's role may
have been, the coup was primarily
an effort by the Iraqi Army to cur-
tail the activities of the extreme
wing of the Baath Party. The Baath
is an Arab nationalist political or-
ganization, active throughout the
Arab world, which has been ruling
Iraq and Syria.

For The President Only - Top Secret


d. The coup group has not
thrown all Baathists out of the
government; there are party members
in the new cabinet.

e. Syrian Baathists have wel-
comed this retention of their Iraqi
brothers. Their attitude springs
from the recognition that the Baath
in Syria cannot stay afloat wi
support from Ira

f. The reaction of Nasir's
Egypt, which passionately. desires
to see the Baath go under, has been '
exactly the opposite. Cairo-has-been|----

a. North Vietnamese leaders
are pressing their campaign for neu-
tralization of South Vietnam.

b. They can count on Cambodia's
support. Prince Sihanouk has said
he believes neutralization of South
Vietnam to be the only way to keep
his country and the rest of the area
from falling eventually into Comnmu-
nist hands,

c.. The French feel the same
way. Indeed, Souvanna Phouma re-
portedly told a closed session of
the Laotian National Assembly that
the French were urging hin to sup-
port Hanoi in this.

d. Moreover, according to one
of our clandestine sources, ‘the North
Vietnamese have talked Souvanna into
backing the neutralization proposi-
tion in the UN.

e. The troublesome Polish ICC
delegate in Laos, Marek Thee (who
will be going home soon), has just
returned to Vientiane from Hanoi and
is trying, with somewhat less suc-
cess, to enlist British support too.

f. As part of the same campaign,
the North Vietnamese have told the
French they believe sentiment is
growing in the US for withdrawal of
US forces. They reportedly plan to
keep the heat on to encourage it.

g. Hanoi is at the same time

that it is ready to be reasonable.

h. To hear Thee tell it, North
Vietnamese leaders feel that neutral-
ity for South Vietnam and eventual
reunification is the only way they,
too, can escape from Peiping's clutches.

a. As is usual in Laos, the
tentative agreement for a cease-fire
reached last week between Kong Le
and Pathet Lao commander Singkapo
came to naught.

b. Each side accuses the other Bk
of planning to use a cease-fire to
screen preparations for larger at-
tacks.

c. There is scattered fighting
in the Plaine des Jarres. Lao Army,
neutralist, and Meo guerrilla ele-
ments are jointly engaged in a

e. Sihanouk's actions toward
the US have not been universally
popular. This is particularly true
among government officials, the bus-
iness community (who have reason to
fear stepped-up nationalization),
and the military, where the US re-
tains a considerable reservoir of

a. A number of Yemeni leaders

followings.

the Egyptians is not likely at the

South Vietnam

a. Vietnamese Communist forces
-kept up their high post-coup level
of activity over the weekend.

b. The most significant action
was an attack early yesterday morn-
ing against a US special forces train-
ing camp some 30 miles from Saigon.

c. When the smoke cleared after
a sharp fight, four US soldiers were
missing and at least 35 South Vietnamese
were dead.

d. Late yesterday morning, the
Viet Cong shot down two aircraft sup-
porting a government operation in
the extreme south, and damaged twelve
more. Two more Americans are missing
in this action:

e. Back in Saigon, the new re-
gime's troubles with the ambitious
General Ton That Dinh continue.

f£. He is still angling to get
control of the important strategic
hamlet program and has yet to give
up command of the Third Corps, which
the generals assigned to another of
their number earlier in the month,
This corps is of particular signifi-
cance in that it surrounds Saigon.

1. Iraq-Syria , a. The shaky new accommodation
between the two countries following
the recent coup in Iraq has been .
threatened by Syria's action in grant-
ing asylum to Ali Saleh Saadi, the
exiled leader of the extremist wing

of the Iraqi Baath.

i b. Saadi had arrived in Syria
;,{ unannounced following a brief stay

: in Madrid, On Friday, Iraq sent a
message asking Syria to expel him on
He grounds that sheltering him was a

Het breach of agreement.

! c. Both regimes continue to be

I: troubled with internal dissension

} with affairs in one deeply tangled
with those in the other,

WAN i d. In Syria, as we mentioned
i yesterday, the Baathist regime is

split between moderates who desire

| a broadening of the government's

| power base,and a doctrinaire faction

| which wants to keep all. control of

: the government in Baathist hands.

e. In Iraq, the pull is more
H away from the Baathists. Two minis-
H ters have threatened to resign unless
the government adopts an openly pro-
it Egyptian policy. Nevertheless the
government feels secure enough to
ease up on curfew and transport re-
strictions imposed since the coup.

f. Iraq has announced that the
military union with Syria remains in
force, and that a new commander of
the joint armies will be announced
‘soon. :

2. Laos a.

govern- |,
ment forces had finally secured Vang
Vieng and its airfield, long Held

by the Pathet Lao. They also told
of the capture of Ban Namone farther
south on Route 13.

b. The neutralist, rightist Lao
Army, and Meo tribal guerrilla forces
hope to sustain their coordinated
clearing action until remaining Pathet
Lao pockets in this area north of
Vientiane are cleared,

er

c. Such operations in Laos
have often been followed by a Com-
munist riposte. We have a few in-
dicators that something could be up
on the Communist side, but these are
so.far very tenuous indeed.

3. South Vietnam a. According to press reports,
Viet Cong attacks on Sunday wiped
out two of the government's strategic
hamlets in the central highlands about
250 miles north of Saigon.

b. More than 1,000 inhabitants
in the hamlets--who are minority
tribesmen--are missing and possibly
have fled into the mountains. They
abandoned a significant quantity of
weapons to the Viet Cong.

c. These attacks not only sug-
gest continued erosion of the govern-
ment's programs to win over tribal
support, but also signal that stepped
up Viet Cong pressure against the new
regime is spreading to the north.

d. This Communist effort is
aimed at discrediting the post-Diem
regime before the new leadership is
able to get its feet on the ground
and capture the loyalty and respect
of people in the provinces.

e. Although the Viet Cong still
continues to draw its main strength
from local recruiting, a steady stream
of cadre and training personnel con-
tinues to make its way to the south
from North Vietnam along the Laotian
border.

£. We are now reasonably sure
that at least 784 persons infiltrated
from the north during 1963 and the
actual total may be much higher.

4. USSR

b. We probably should have had

by now an announcement closing an area
roughly 500 miles south of Johnston

Island to shipping. We suspect the
Soviets may have delayed it in order

not to appear to be rattling rockets
immediately after President Kennedy's
death,

5.  USSR-Berlin a. Embassy Bonn feels that
the Soviet Union may be seeking at
least a temporary modus vivendi on
the autobahn without prejudicing
its juridical position, which can
be used to cause difficulties there
i in the future.

b. The embassy bases this on
the Soviet replies to the Western -
notification to the USSR on 29
October regarding harmonized convoy
procedures--two oral statements on
16 November and a note of 21 Novem-
ber.

6. Brazil

c. The Soviet note was designed
to make a record, showing that the i
USSR exercises "control" of the auto- ‘
bahn and that the recent incidents
resulted from US refusal to comply

with “existing procedures."

d. On the other hand, the Soviet [8k
procedures described in the oral re- i
plies seem to reflect actual Allied
practices, though there is enough
ambiguity to afford the USSR flexi-
bility in any future actions.

a, The danger of an immediate |
coup against the Goulart regime has
receded with the reported decision
of Second Army Commander General |
Bevilaqua not to join the coup plot- |
ters. it

_______b. _Bevilaaua,

may have

been asked to hand over his command
as part of a series of reassign4 |

ments made. by President Goulart to pes

keep the military off balance.

c. On the other side of the
coin, there is widespread belief 7
that Goulart himself will at some i
time resort to a coup to establish
an authoritarian regime.

of touch with reality or very poorly

back when the opposition Justice

~'c. Now the Peasant Party, one :
of the three in the coalition, has :
voted to pull out, and probably will
do so as soon as Inonu gets back from
Washington. Another partner, the

d. A new coalition is at least
a theoretical possibility, with a

Inonu probably would not be prime

e. The military are working 6k

b. This year's harvest was
clearly very bad. The weight of
evidence suggests that Soviet grain
stockpiles have been far drawn down
this year and are not sufficient to
protect the country from another
poor harvest.

ce. Our estimate is that total
grain production each year since
1958 has been well below that year's
level of 125 million tons, while
the population has continued to grow.

d. We have seen
signs of extensive slaughtering in
anticipation of fodder shortages
during the winter. This runs counter
to Khrushchev's oft-stated plan to
build up the livestock industry.

e. We have also noted that
the extensive wheat purchases weaken
the USSR's gold reserves at a time
when it hopes to expand its imports
of machinery for a huge chemical
fertilizer program.

f£. .In addition,we have seen
signs of stringent measures to pro-
tect the grain. supply, accompanied
by public discontent in some areas
over the absence of bread. aca

a. Czech President and party
boss Novotny has gone to Moscow,
evidently for economic talks, judg-
ing by the composition of his dele-
gation.

b. Novotny's background of
Stalinist excesses have put him on
the wrong side of Khrushchev. They
also have given rise to control
problems, particularly in the. frac-
.tious Slovak party where pressures
for liberalization have made their
mark,

c. Party problems and Novotny's
leadership may. thus also come under
review.

d. A curious sign of the times
is the fact that, although President |
Novotny is in Moscow, the presidential

an oversight, but the symbolism will ||.
not be lost to the people in Prague. |

1. Venezuela |:

a. The country's six presiden-
tial candidates have swung into the
home stretch of their campaigns.

So have the terrorists, who are still
trying hard to sabotage next Sunday's
vote.

b. There is little doubt that
the terrorist effort has all-out
Cuban support. Castro looks on
Venezuela as his prime target in
Latin America and would do everything
in his power to prevent President
Betancourt from finishing his term.

c. So far, the terrorists have
tried to intimidate the candidates
by harassing political rallies, bomb-
ing their party headquarters in
various cities, and threatening them
with assassination. They have tried
to scare voters from the polls by
creating a general atmosphere of law-
lessness. Kidnappings, like the’ one
yesterday morning of Colonel Chenault, |:
are part of the pattern. :

d. The government counterattack —
is under the personal direction of
Betancourt, who is as determined to
finish out his term and turn over
power to a freely-elected successor
as Castro is to prevent this. as

e. Yesterday it was announced
that the carrying of firearms by
anyone outside the security forces
was forbidden until the elections
are over.

f. Some 3,000 reservists have
been called up te protect the polls.
“Leaves are being cancelled and all
security forces are maintaining a
high state of alert.

2. South Vietnam a. We now have a fuller ac-
count from official US sources of
the Viet Cong attack on two mountain
villages mentioned in Tuesday's ~
Checklist.

. b. This account makes it clear
that the earlier press. versions,
‘which spoke of 1,000 missing vil-
lagers, were highly colored.

ce. Our present information
‘is that the attack, in company
strength, was successfully repulsed.
The Viet Cong suffered some 30 cas~
ualties; government losses were six
killed, three wounded and 39 missing.

(Cont'd)

For The President Only - Top Secret


d. As is usual in these cases,
the villagers began to trickle back
- once the Viet Cong left.

e. This episode aside, we see
‘a number of indications that the
Communists will try to sustain the
-higher level of military activity
“they have kept up since the coup.

f£. The Communist radio has
called for more attacks in an effort
to destroy strategic hamlets and
"develop" Viet Cong forces. In sup-
. port of this, Viet Cong communica-
tions traffic has been unusually -
heavy and has involved a large vol-
ume of high priority traffic and
special alert patterns.

action in breaking off talks with
the Burmese Communists by arresting .

over 700 of their number.

b. Ne Win had been trying to
lure the faction-ridden Communists
into a "national front." However,
he found the demands of the Commu-
nist negotiators, some of whom had
only just returned from long exile
in Peiping, to be impossible.

renewed fighting between the army As

c, Communist documents seized
by Venezuelan authorities earlier

Communists' paramilitary arm, the

d. The cache was found on 1
November on a beach in Falcon State
in the north, scene of the most -

zuelan government assumes that the
weapons were sent from Cuba by sea.

e. Caracas will lay formal
charges concerning the arms cache

e. The feelers it put out
after the conclusion of the test-

some of the fraternal parties. They
felt such a meeting could only make
matters worse with the Chinese.

f£. Indeed, Peiping saw this
to be Moscow's purpose, and when
the idea failed to take hold,the
Chinese took it to be a setback for
Khrushchev personally.

g. Their reaction to Khrush-
