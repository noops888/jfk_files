RE: CARLOS PRIO SOCARRAS

which time the infiltrees would re-enter the United States
through the Guantanamo Naval Base.

MM T=-2, another government agency which conducts
intelligence investigations, ‘on October 14, 1968, advised
that CARLOS PRIO SOCARRAS was helping in a plot proposed for
inside Cuba. MM T-2 said that PRIO was willing to help
with money donations, but was not certain that the person
he was trying to hép was really the person he previously
knew in Cuba . (L1)

On October 15, 1968, MM T-3, a Cubamexile closely
associated with Cuban revolutionary matters in Miami, advised
that PRIO continues to be in the construction business in
Puerto Rico, but also maintains a residence in Miami.

PRIO is a former law partner of MIGUEL SAN PEDRO, Second
in Charge of the Cuban Nationalist Movement (CNM), an
anti-CASTRO organization in Miami. Although PRIO and
SAN PEDRO are close personal friends, PRIO refused to
make a $3,000 donation to SAN PEDRO's organization.

MM T-3 exiained that PRIO has been contacted by
a majority of: the anti-CASTRO organizations in Miami, :but
has not donated money to them for the past two years. : ~

On October 22, 1968, the records of the Immigration
and Naturalization Service (INS), Miami, Florida, reflected i
that JAVIER CEPERO VERNIER,:Alien Registration #A17 698 493, i
born June 18, 1941 in Cuba, single, and a student, claimed t
he was in jail in Cuba from 1961 to 1966, and formerly
resided at Reparto Fontanar, Avenue #183, 8813, Havana,
Cuba.

CEPERO entered the United States on April 16, i
1968, and listed his address as in care of Mr. WILLIAM KAYRUZ, |
3495 Broadway, Apartment #94, New York City, New York. INS
records reflected CEPERO's present address in Miami. was

unknown. i

RE: CARLOS PRIO SOCARRAS

On November 12, 1968, MANUEL ARTIME BUESA, Head
of the Movimiento de Recuperacion Revolucionaria (MRR -
Revolutionary Recovery Movement), advised PRIO is not
active in Cuban revolutionary matters, but has given some
money donations to several anti-CASTRO organizations in
Miami.

ARTIME said that PRIO's donations have generally
been to Spanish-language newspapers in the Miami area for
the purpose of obtaining favorable press publicity.

MM T-4, who has been involved in Cuban revolutionary
matters for the past several years, on November 12, 1968,
advised ATON CONSTANZO PALAU, exile activist in Miami, is
not liked by MANUEL ARTIME BUESA, because a few years ago he
stole some military equipment from ARTIME's warehouse in
Hialeah, Florida.

On November 8, 1968, CONSTANZO sent one of his
associates to tell ARTIME that AMOCHE MOSQUERA, also known
as: YARAY, infiltrated into Oriente Province, Cuba, with nine
men. About one week ago, (first name unknown) CEPERO left
Cuba via Guantanamo Naval Base, and on arrival in Miami,
requested ARTIME be contacted and asked for arms to be
sent to YARAY. Thereafter, CEPERO left Miami and presumably
went to Chicago, Illinois. ‘

ARTIME replied he knew YARAY, in that they had
both been in a camp in CentralAmerica together, and ARTIME
considered him an expert in guerrilla warfare. ARTIME said
he would be willing to make arms available for delivery to
YARAY.

ARTIME.said he would leave Miami. on about November 12,
1968, to go to. Nicaragua to obtain arms ‘and arrange delivery
of: them to CBBERO, so that they could be taken to YARAY.

RE: —- CARLOS PRIO SOCARRAS

ARTIME stated that the only condition he would demand was
that arms would go to Cuba and not to Miami. He said he
would be willing to supply any gierrilla band in Cuba after
February 1, 1968, and claimed he, himself, had a base near
Oriente Province, Cuba.

CONSTANZO's representative interpreted this
as meaning that perhaps ARTIME has a base in Haiti.

CONSTANZO ‘said he had an appointment to see
CARLOS PRIO at 6:00 PM in Miami on November 12, 1968.
MM T-4 felt that CONSTANZO would seek financial aid from
PRIO., MM T-4 explained that CONSTANZO is generally
considered untrustworthy, unreliable, unscrupulous, and
is attempting to obtain arms from ARTIME for CONSTANZO's
personal benefit and use. CONSTANZO indicated he had no
intention of’ delivering these arms to CEPERO.
