JAVIER CEPERO VERNIER, who fled Cuba via Guantanamo

RE:

CARLOS PRIO SOCARRAS

which time the infiltrees would re-enter the United States

through the Guantanamo Naval Base.(5)

MM T-2, another government agency which conducts

intelligence investigations, on October 14, 1968, advised

that CARLOS PRIO SOCARRAS was helping in a plot proposed for

inside Cuba.

MM T-2 said that PRIO was willing to help

with money donations, but was not certain that the person

he was trying to help was really the person he previously

knew in Cuba. (4)

On October 15, 1968, MM T-3, a Cubanexile closely

associated with Cuban revolutionary matters in Miami, advised

that PRIO continues to be in the construction business in

Puerto Rico, but also maintains a residence in Miami.

PRIO is a former law partner of MIGUEL SAN PEDRO, Second

in Charge of the Cuban Nationalist Movement (CN™), an

anti-CASTRO organization in Miami.

Although PRIO

and

SAN PEDRO are close personal friends, PRIO refused to

make a $3,000 donation to SAN PEDRO's organization.

MM T-3 explained that PRIO has been contacted by

a majority of the anti-CASTRO organizations in Miami, but

has not donated money to them for the past two years.

On October 22, 1968, the records of the Immigzation

and Naturalization Service (INS), Miami, Florida, reflected

that JAVIER CEPERO VERNIER, Alien Registration #A17 698 493,

born June 18, 1941 in Cuba, single, and a student, claimed

be was in Jail in Cuba from 1961 to 1966,

and formerly

resided at Reparto Fontanar, Avenue #183, 8813, Havana,

Cuba.

CEPERO entered the United States on April 16,

1968, and listed his address as in care of Mr. WILLIAM KAYRUZ,

3495 Broadway, Apartment #94, New York City, New York.

INS

records reflected CEPERO's present address in Miami was

unknown.

RE:

CARLOS PRIO SOCARRAS

On November 12, 1968,

MANUEL ARTIME BUESA, Head

of the Movimiento de Recuperacion Revolucionaria MRR -

Revolutionary Recovery Movement), advised PRIO is not

active in Cuban revolutionary matters, but has given some

money donations to several anti-CASTRO organizations in

Miami.

ARTIME said that PRIO's donations have generally

been to Spanish-language newspapers in the Miami area for

the purpose of obtaining favorable press publicity.

MM T-4, who has been involved in Cuban revolutionary

matters for the past several years, on November 12, 1968,

advised ATON CONSTANZO PALAU, exile activist in Miami, is

not liked by MANUEL ARTIME BUESA, because a fewjears ago he

stole some military equipment from ARTIME'S warehouse in

Hialeah, Florida.

On November 8, 1968, CONSTANZO sent one of his

associates to tell ARTIME that AMOCHE MOSQUERA, also known

as YARAY, infiltrated into Oriente Province, Cuba, with nine

men.

About one week ago, (first name unknown) CEPERO left

Cuba via Guantanamo Naval Base, and on arrival in Miami,

requested ARTIME be contacted

and asked for arms to be

sent to YARAY. Thereafter, CEPERO left Miami and presumably

went to Chicago, Illinois.

ARTIME replied he knew YARAY, in that they had

both been in a camp in CentralAmerica together, and ARTIME

considered him an expert in guerrilla warfare.

ARTIME said

he would be willing to make arms available for delivery to

YARAY.

ARTIME said he would leave Miami on about November 12,

1968, to go to Nicaragua to obtain arms and arrange delivery

of them to CBBERO, so that they could be taken to YARAY.

RE: :

CARLOS PRIO SOCARRAS

ARTINE stated that the only condition he would demand

was

that arms would go to Cuba and not to Miami. He said he

would be willing to supply anyguerrilla band in Cuba after

February 1, 1969, and claimed he, himself, had a base near

Oriente Province, Cuba.

CONSTANZO's representative interpreted this

as meaning that perhaps ARTIME has a base in Haiti.

CONSTANZO said he had an appointment to see

CARLOS PRIO at 6:00 PM in Miami on November 12, 1968.

MM. T-4 felt that CONSTANZO would seek financial aid from

PRIO:

MM T-4 explained that CONSTANZO is generally

considered untrustworthy, unreliable, unscrupulous, and

is attempting

to obtain arms from ARTIME for CONSTANZO's

personal benefit and use.

CONSTANZO indicated he had no

intention of delivering these arms to CEPERO.
