of

Following various reviews of the film, JWAVE decided the

filn would probably become controversial and it would be

inadvisable to permit Miss CASTRO to accept the invitation.

Because of INCA's extremist political orientation, MAver

has wanted to avoid any more juvolvement between Miss CASTRO

and

INCA and the Station asse:
