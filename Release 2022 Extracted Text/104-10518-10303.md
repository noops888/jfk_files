Om April 5, 1963, the Wiami Office received a telo~
phone call from a Lorenzo Hall, 142 Southwest 2lst Avenue,
it 76, Miami, Ylorida, Holl said he understood the
FBI, CIA and INS were trying to locate hia, and he wanted to
repert his address.

185 pounds, ruddy complexion, ig unemployed, indicates he is
fron Los Angeles, California, is always on the move, if in and
out o2 Miami, 4g the confidence and type, and it 1s not known
if he ig in MiamA at the present tine. Seurce advised that Hall
Claimed to have been in the Cuban xebel Army, but the other mere
Genaries in Hiaui doubt this.

Seurce said Hall is leosely connected with Cuban revo-
lutionary activities, which ho uses as a gimmick to try snd obtein
money donations. In Miami, he is loosely associated with Gerald
Patrick Henming, “Mexican” Larry Howard and *illiam Houston Bey~
wour, all unemployed adveaturers.

Source stated Hall and Howard made a trip to Cali-

_ fortia several months ago in an attompt to colloct money by repre-

senting theaselves as representatives of an anti-Castro movenent,
It is doubtiul they collected any sizable amount of money. Their
practice is to contact lccal chapters of the John Birch Society,
cleining they are anti-coumunist freedom fighters, and ask for
money to carry on their work. They do obtain eone money this way,
and use the woney for living expenses.

In October, 1963, Hall and Seymour visited Dallas, Texas,
trying to collect money donations under the guise of representing
anti-Castro organizations. Among the persons they contacted was
lester R. Logue, 628 Meadows Building, Dallas, a geologist. it
4s unknown 1f Logue gave them any money, but he has, in the past,
wade contributions to Miami mercenaries.
