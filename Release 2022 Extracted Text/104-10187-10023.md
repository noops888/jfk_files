Review of Project. LIEMPTY

(For the purpose of Project Renewal)

1. CURRENT OBJECITVES AND PRODUCTION•

Oliver Go SCANTLING Segment (discussed in relation so project

objectives):

1. "To collect opcrational information pertaining to LIMERiCK

personnel and physical facilities." SCANTLING has consinued (see pre-

vious Project Reviews forwarded as arachnients to HMALI-17009, 31

October 1961, HMMA -14093, 13 November 1959, and HNA/A-15979, 18

N. vember 1960) to provide worthwhile information pertaining to this ob-

jecrive.

During the past year SCANTLING has continued to be used ex-

tensively to follow up leads produced by LIFEAT and LIENVOY. An ex-

cellent example of this blending of various Station support assets was the

investigation and casing performed by SCANTLING after leads from both

LIENVOY and LIFEAT Indicated the possibility of launching a successful

recinical operation against the residence of a high ranking LIVERICK

intelligence officer assigned to Mexico. under diplomatic cover. i ith the

aid of the thorough casing report and neighborhood investigation completed

by SCANTLING, Station KURIOT personnel, supported by other Station

support assets,

were successful in installing a technical device in the

targer.

SCANTLING continues to be the Station's primary means of keeping

current records on the residences of ihe many Soviet personnel in Mexico

City. This Is primarily accomplished through SCANTLING's follow up of

all LIENVOY leads which indicate interesi by Suviers in specific quarters.

(See previous projec renewal requesis for additional details.)

"To collect operational intormation pertaining to other targets of

opportunity, foreign official installarions and personnel of ictelligence in-

in Mexico". SCANTLING is very useful for collecting in-

formation on diner Station targets:

On the basis of a lead from the ODACID installation in

Veracruz, the Station (with Headquarters suppors) mounted an

operation to unobtrusively saboiage a large unit of agricultural

nachinery (of U.S. origin) which was in transit to Cuba.: To

noun: this operation, a precise and deralled casing of the imple-

ment was essential.

This SCANTLING was able de accomplish in

und trip id Yarues get siles thur cantribuce singerially roy

the operation.

SCANTLING provided the Station a detalled Investigation

of Harotun (Harry ) KOPOLAN, employec of American Communists

Albert and Märgaret MALTZ, which

• determined the residence

of KOPOLAN as well as hla family status and connections,

C. In the Satellite area, SCANTLING completed a casing of

an official Yugoslav installation in conjunction with a projected

Station technical operation.

3. "To exploit operational leads through recruitments, debriefings,

and surveillances." SCANTLING has contributed to this objective both

directly and Indirectly as noted in the following examples:

a. SCANTLING completed a detalled and secure interylew of

0.2 the fiancee of BESMOOTH to determine her connection with the

principals in the MCMAYFOWL case, particularly any connection

with procurement of documents used li the flight behind the Iron

Curtain. This assignment was extremely sensitive (SCANTLING

was not told true reason for interview) and SCANTLING did an

admirable job while maintaining hils cover for having the interview.

b. SCANTLING was called on for extensive initial spade work

in the BEKNAVE/BECHICK operation, SCANTLING gave his

usual competent pertermance despitc the fact that the role assigned

him was unique to his experience.

c. SCANTLING performed one man surveillance of a sensitive

Station Soviet double agent which contributed significantly to that

operation.

d. SCANTLING was used extensively during the visit of

GPIDEAL as part of the Station's effort. in providing maximum

protection for the GPIDEAL party.

c. In addition, SCANTLING performed numerous pretext and

neighborhood investigations, some of which were highly sensitive.

SCANTLING also does most of the local investigations requested by

ODACID and other ODYOKE components.

In addition to his contributions to the above objectlves, SCANTLING

is used for miscellaneous support requirements from the Station, For example,

SCANTLING handled LIEMBROIL-2 until the return of LIMOTOR - 14 in July

1962. SCANTLING is also used to spor and rent sate houses aud apartrpents

for other Station operations: SESHI

SED

As stateu in the preceeding Requests for Project Renewal,

although SCANTLING's LIEMPTY Project objectives can never be com-

pletely fulfillevi, it is the Station's opilon that SCANTLING has made

important and valuable contributions to LIEMPTY Project objectives

speclfically and io other Statlon activiles in general, SCANTLING's

production, nessured against monetary expenditures; case officer time

and other intengible factors, unquestionably justificis his continuation

uy in liliogrud firs of Project LIEMPTY.

B. Raymond H, GERENDE Segment (discussed in relation to project

objcetives):

1. "To collect operational information pertaining to LIMERICK

persoinel and physical facilitles through use of photographic base houses. "

Three phorographic bases, LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA, contribute

to this objeciive. To avoid repetition, the Station is omitting the usual

description of the functions of these three bases and how they contribute

to the above objecrive. This was described in detail in the 1960 Request for

Project Renewal. (LIMMA- 15979)

2. "To collect operational information and identify operational

leads pertaining to Station targets of opportunity, " The LIENTRAP operation,

handled by GERENDE, is still the major contributor to this objecive.

Among LIENTRIP's regular and exrensive photographie assignments, was

the photo stakeour of prominent Mexican Communists (some of whom have

never been phorographed previously by KUBARK) and Communist Party

Headquarters. During this assignment, LIENTRAP was able to cover

the recent mora of PCM Headquarters (the first information Station had

of the move) and to continue photo surveillance at the new site.

3. "To provide operational support to Staticn opcrations, I.e...

rent hotel rooms and apart ments, and conduct counter-surveillances.

GERENDE is use frequently to rent hotel rooms and apartments for other

Station operatiors and activities.

GERENDE's comprehensive area

knowledge and personal operational capabitities combine to make him an

extremely valuable Sation asset for such support activities. GERENDE

also procures and services post office box letter drops for the many

Station operations requiring them.

4.

The qually and quantity of operational Information produced

by the photographic bases and other activities under GERENDE:s control

and supervision Is considered worthwhile and in some cases unique. The

Station concludes, therefore, that this segment of the LIEMPTY Project

should be continued.

C. Relatlonship to Related Mission Directive Objectives:

As stated in previous project renewals, it can readily be nored that

Project LIEMPTY has provided support to many Station operations and in

this manner has been a contributing factor to the furtherance of the Related

Mission Diicctive. The project has not produced any positive incelligence

nor has it been intended that it should do so.

The project's sole purpose

is to provide a mechanism for the development of operational information

In support of other Station operations.

11. CHANGES

There have been no changes in the LIEMPTY Project during the

past project ycar affecting cither objectives or personnel.

IlI. EFFECTIVENESS

There has been no change in Project LIEMPTY which would alter

the validity of the remarks made in Scction Ill of 1960 project renewal re-

quest (HIMMA: 15979)

IV. PROBLEMS

The security problem in connection with the LICALLA operation,

which was described in 1060 rcnewal request, is still present but has

caused no known difficulty. At Headquarters suggestion in HMMW-9736, the

LICALLA base was reactivated on 24 May 1961.

The base operator con-

tinues to be alert for any unusual incidents which might indicate that the

base has been compromised.

V. PLANS

The Station considers that the project is operating at its optinum

size and does not plan to expand it during the coming year. Efforts will

be continued to refine and better utilize the existing project organizacional

arrangements. As in the pasi, the Station wili continue ils effuris lu

Improve the compartmentation and seei

rity of the project.
