Review of Project LIEMPTY or

: (For the purpose of Project Renewal),

ee cece lee: CURRENT. Ob) ECTIVES AND PRODUCTION: ._
be A,’ Oliver G. SCANTLING Seginent (discussed In relation to project
7 objectives): : :

1, “To collect operational information, pertaining zo LIMERICK
personnel and physical facilities.” SCANTLING has.concinued (see pre-"
vious Project Reviews forwarded as attachments to HMMA-17999, 31
October 1961, HMMA- 14093, 13 November-1959, and HMMA-15979, 18
N. vember 1960) to provide worthwhile information pertaining to thls ob-
jective, During the past year SCANTLING has continued to be used ck*
tensively to follow up Icads produced by LUFEAT and LIENVOY, An ex-
4 cellent example of-this blending of various Station support assets was the
Gai investigation and casing performed by SCANTLING after leads from both
7 LIENVOY and LIFEAT Indicated the possibility of launching a successful
it technical operation against the residence of a high ranking, ‘LIMERICK
intelligence officer assigned to Mexico.under diplomatic cover, i (ith the
aid of the thorough casing report and neighborhood inve:
by SCANTLING, Station KURIOT personnel, supported by other Station
support assets, were successful in installing a technical device in the
target, ,

SCANTLING continues to be the Station's primary means of keeping
current records on the residences of ihe many Soviet personnel in Mexico
City. “This is primarily accomplished througit SCANTLING's follow up of
all LIENVOY leads which indicate interest by Soviets in specific quarters,
(See previous project renewal requests for additional details.)

2, "To collect operational information pertaining to-other targets of
opportunity, foreign official installations and personnel of intelligence in-
terest Operating in Mexico", SCANTLING is very useful for collecting in-
formation on oiaer Station targets:

a, On the basis of a lead from the ODACID installation in
Veracruz, the Station (with Headquarters support) mounted an
operation to unobtrusively sabotage a large unit of agricultural
machinery (of U.S. origin) was in transit to Cuba,. To
mount this operation, a precise and detatled casing of the imple-
ment was essential, This SCAN ap was: able wa complish in
vas G Voracruz
the’ operation,
oa Din kee



b,  SCANTLING provided the Station a detalled Inveatigation
of Harotun Harry") KOPOLAN, . cmployee of Amertcan Communists:
Albert and Matgarét MALTZ, which °. determined the residence’ ,
of KOPOIAN as well as his family status and connections, :

ce In the Satellite area, SCANTLING completed a casing of .
an official Yugoslav installation in conjunction with a projected
Station technical operation,

3. "To exploit operational leads through recrultments, debricfings,
and surveillances," SCAN'TLING has contributed to this objective both
directly and Indirectly as noted in the following examples:

a. SCAN‘ FLING completed a detailed and secure interview of
O2 the fiancee of |BESMOOTH.to determine her connection with the
o2 Principals tn the MAYFOWL case, particularly any connection
with procuremen| ‘of documents used bi the flight behind the Iron
Curtain, This assignment was extremely sensitive (SCANTLING
was not told true reason for interview) and SCANTLING did-an
admirable job while maintaining his cover for having the Interview,

b,. SCAN‘TLING was called on for extensive initial spade work

in the[BEKNAVE/B SHICK operation, SCANTLING gave his
usual competent pertermance despite the fact that the role assigned

him was unique-to his experience,

ow

c. SCANTLING performed one man surveillance of a sensitive
Station Soviet double agent which contributed slgnificayrly to that

operation,

d, SCANTLING was used extensively during the visic of
GPIDEAL as part of the Station's effort-in providing maximum
protection for the GPIDEAL party,

e. In addition, SCANTLING performed numerous pretext and
neighborhood investigations, some of which were highly ‘sensitive,
SCANTLING also does most of the local investigations requested by
ODACID and other ODYOKE components,

4. In addition to his contributions to the above objectives, SCANTLING
is used for miscellaneous support requirements from the Station, : For example,
SCANTLING handled LIEMBROIL-2 until the return of LIMOTOR-14 in July
1962. SCANTLING ts.also used to spot and rent safe house; perenpents
for other Station operations, SECi

5. AS stated in the preceeding Requests for Project Renewal,
“although SCANTLING's. LIEMPTY Project objectives can never bé com-.
pletely fulfilled, ic is the Station's opinion tit SCANTLING ‘has made’.
Important and valuable contrtbutions:to LIEMPTY Project objecitves
specifically and io other Station activities in gencral, SCANTLING's
production, neasured against monetary expenditures, case officér time
and other intengible factors, unquestionably justifies ais ee

us un Integral part of Project LIEMPTY.

B. Raymord , GERENDE Segment (discussed in relation to project
objectives):

1, “To collect operational information pertaining to LIMERICK
personnel and. physical facilities through use of photographic baye houses, "
‘Three photographic bases, LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA, courbes
to. thls objective. To avoid repetition, the Station is omitt ing the usual
description of the. functions of these three bases and how they contribute
to the above objective. ‘This was described in detail in the 1960 Request for | -
Project Renewal, (HMMA-15979)

2, “To collect operational information and tdentify operational
leads pertaining to Station targets of opportunity," The LIENTRAP operation,
handled by GERENDE, is still the major contributor to this objeciive,
Among LIENTRAP's regular and extensive photographie assignments, was
the photo stakeout of prominent Méxican Communists (some of whom have
never been piiotegraphed previously by KUBARK) and Communist Party
Headquarters, During this assignment, LIENTRAP was able to cover
the recent mave of PCM Headquarters (the first information Station had
of the move) and to continue photo surveillance at the new site,

3, “To provide operational support to Staticn operations, i.e. ,
rent hotel rooms and apart ments, and conduct counter-surveillances, "
GERENDE is used frequently to rent hotel rooms and apartments for other
Station ops 23 and activities, GERENDE's comprehensive area
knowledge and personal operational capabitities combine to make him an
extremely valusble Sation asset for such support activities. GERENDE
also procures and services post office box letter drops for the many
Station opera requiring them,



4, The qualtry and quant ity of operat tonal laformation produced
by’ the photographic bases sand other activities under GERENDE:: s‘control ©

Station concludes, theretore, that this Segment of the. LIEMPTY Project
should be continued, . -

_ ca Relationship to Related Mission Directive Objectives:

As’ stated In previous project renewals, it can readtly be noved that
Project LIEMPTY has provided support to many Station operations and in
this manner has been a contributing factor to the furtherance of the Related
Mission Directive, The project has not produced any-p ositive Intelligence
nor has It been Intended that tt should do so, ‘The project's sole purpose
ig to provide a mechanism for the development of operational information
tn support of other Station operations,

Ul, , CHANGES

There have been no changes In the LIEMPTY Project during the
past project year affecting cither objectives or personnel,

Ill, EFFECTIVENESS

i There has been no change in Project LIEMPTY which would alter
the validity of the remarks made in Section IT] of 1960 project renewal re-
quest (IMMA: 15979)

IV, PROBLEMS

The security problem in connection with the LICALLA operation,
which was described in 1940: renewal request, is still present but has
caused no known difficulty. At Headquarters suggestion in HMMW-9736, the
LICALLA. base was reactivated on.29 May 1961, The basc operator con-
tinues to be alert for any unusual Incidents which might indicate that the
base has becn compromised,

Vv. PLANS

Tae Station considers that the project is operating at its optimum
size and does not, plan to expand it during the coming year, Efforts will
be continued to refine and better utilize the existing project organizational
arrangements, As in the past, the Station will continue ils efforis tu
improve the compartmentation_and aot.” of the project,
