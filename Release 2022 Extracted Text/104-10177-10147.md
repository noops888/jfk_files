NARRATIVE COMMENTS

FELIPE was handicapped to some degree by hie weakness in English
language. FELIPE's attitude throughout the course was cooperative and
congenial, His participation in lectures, plans, and field exercises
suffered from a lack of concentration and thoroughness. He appeared to
have only a partial grasp of many of the topics presented. He was :
inclined -to rush a bit in planning exercises and was also somewhat :
hasty in hia ‘exécution of field work (Mapping, Recons, tactical movement
in Raid and Ambush Exercises),

In hig leadership assignment, he planned reasonably well, but his
execution of the plan was weak and he lacked good control of the group.

FCR THE DIRECTOR OF TRAINING:

APEROVED AND FORWARDED:

30/66

S-E-C-R-E-T


| SENET

FILIPE - Filipe has had no previous demolition training but indicated he

had worked with explosives Hie practical
work was a little sloppy, not from lack of care but because he was
not able to work too well with his hands, The practical work did

“ not show any progress from commencement to completion of the
course but his placements were well made and effective. He seemed
to understand all subject matter covered and always answered test
type questions correctly. Whenever crimping detonators, ‘his hands
were very shaky but he did not seem to be nervous at any other time

Close supervision was required when he was

crimping detonators, He was a cooperative, interested student

who reacted well to correction, He seemed to enjoy the training

and offered several new methods of attack based on personal experience.

Filipe was rated overall as proficient,

during the course.
