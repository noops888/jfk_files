Bertil leaves for Parliament.

ALEX: ... (something about Hungary, DDR)... Why do you resist every idea I

MAUD: No, but this has to be agreed upon if they send you. I have never ev

ALEX: : JIM?

MAUD: A real gangster trade union.

ALEX: • I don't think so.

MAUD: Well, it is. Haven't you seen that film 'On the laterfront'? It's mi:

ALEX: No, they are very decent people.

MAUD:

Perhaps this HAROLD GIBBONS (ph) --although I think Ive seen that name

somewhere and not on our side--because this is the most gangsteric trade unici

in the U.S.

ALEX: I like gangsters. (Back and forth on this.

Then on a more serious Irv

ALEX:.. CURTIS MCLEAN.

MAUD: Well, anybody from the ILWU (International Longshorenen's and Warehouse

Union, although your Big BORIS (AVERYANOV) didn't believe for a minute that

somebody fron there would cone.

ALEX: But here CURTIS NCLEAN, did he participate in the Sixth Conference?

MAUD: Yes.

ALEX: Why didn't he core for the special ..

MAUD: Becäuse your Big BORIS said that this is exactly the trade union--theii

people--who are building the ships for Vietnan and if the war stops they will

be unemployed and therefore in hittit pexiod said nothing about Indochina.
