prisciples, euch as Artime's MRR, Manolo Kay's JURE, the MAP

any case, their demurreis could be overruled, The prominent mention

All the information I have been able to cather euggeste that the cambl-
sation of Munos Haria/iigueres, as far ae Washington is concerned,
io unbeatable and thet Artime has little choice bul to alin himself with
their way of looking at thinge--or at lenot to pay Hp service to it.

3. Another angle I would like to explore te Presitent Betancourt,
The more | read of his accomplishments ae president, toe more im-
pressediam, Y:hat would you think of having Artime, armed with a
letter of introduction from Fipveres, pay Betancourt s call before he
Felinguishes the presidency. Artime's approach would not be that of @
pplicent of solicitor uf eusport, bul (hat of & young man making a
Pilgrimage, sitting at the feet of a revolutionary who hes bees successful,
absorbing knowledge of how it wae done, Ile could aek Betancourt, alter
be ie out from under the daily grind of government, to address himself
to the problems of post-Castro Cube. He could favite him to chair a
eeminar attended by the MRR leadership. The objective would, of course,
be te involve Betancourt in the affairs of the MRK, without »utting his
are on the masthead and without asking him to contribute anything but
reflections of hie lustre as 4 Latin American leader who bequeathed his
country @ constitutional and democratic regime. Undoubtedly Artie
will have to cast off ideolo,ical ballast in order to accommodate hie
Feluctant eponsore (Cizueres, Betancourt), but Havana ‘vact bien une
“ Asa minimum odjective, Artime would in any case have to
strive to neutralise the letent animvsitios of the moderate left, denying
Manolo Kay an unchallenged ascendancy in monopolizing its support,
which he can probably get for the asking.

4. A welcome by-product of the recuscibation of JUHART,
