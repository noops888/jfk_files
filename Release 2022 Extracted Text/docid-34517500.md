roberto roque, source was

enrolled in a school operated by the Cuban Government

located in the palatino, just outside the city limits

of Havana, which school

is known as the Escuela Basica

de Instruccion Revolucionaria (Basic School of Revolutionary

Instruction).

Students at this school were taught

philosophy of Marxism-Leninism, together with political

economics and general Communist

and anti-United States

propaganda.

The school was a pölitical and propaganda

indoctrination school and students were tota

"they might

become propaganda instructors in Cuba or other Latin

American countries.

No mention was made of the possibillty

they might be called upon to teach progaganda in the

United States.

Some of the individuals attending this

school were there because they desired better jobs while

others were afraid of losing their jobs with the Cuban

Government.

There were approximately 50 students in the

Cuban Intelligence Matters

In April, 1962, source enrolled in another

school maintained

by the

Cuban Government known as

(Provincial Center of Revolutionary Instruction Marianao,

the Centro Provincial de Instruccion Revolucionario

school was then located in Reparto La Coronela,

Havana, Cuba.

This institution provided approximately

the same studies as the Basic School mentioned above,

but of

& more intense nature. Courses included study

of the works of MAO Tse-tung..

The school during the

spring of 1962, had approximately 275 to 300 students

and was divided into five classes. Students resided at

the school including both men and women and were together

during the day in the classrooms and dining rooms, but

were separated by sex in sleeping quarters.

the men

wore blue pants and white tee-shirts during the day and

a gray shirt with blue pants in the evening.

The uniform

for the women during the entire day consisted of blue

pants and gray shirt.

Classes began at 7:15 a.m. and

proceeded throughout the day with recesses. Classes

ended at 4:30 p.m. but resumed after dinner and continued

until 10:50 p.m.

Discipline was very strict. / Source

believed

that

the instructors who were young had received

training from Blas Roca, a functionary of the Cuban

Communist Party.

A man named Carlos Walfrido who was

about 25 years old was in charge of the teachers. His

place was subsequently taken by a woman named Esperanza:

Franca.

During the time source attended these schools,

he never heard any remarks about training students for

possible Intelligence work and he does not know whether

any of the students, in addition to himself, were chosen

by CIS for intelligence training.

Intelligence study in

Cuba is

very secretive and it was never mentioned in

either school.

as "ink"

, a message is written

the sheet previously

rubbed. The sheet then

is passed over steam, and placed under a heavy book for

several hours.

An inocuous latten is then written on the

Parker ink.

The mesaage

is then placed in

an envelode which is not moistened with

the tongue but which is sealed with glue.

On each side

of the flap, about one inch from the apex, the glue is not

used for about one-half inch.

This enables receiver of the

letter to determine whether letter has been opened or not.

To show the letter contains secret writing, the return address

is formed of any name having the initials

"TI", that is,

"tinta invisible".

Sacret writing to be received by source from
