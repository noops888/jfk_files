Re: Cuban Intelligence Matters
Internal Security - Cuba

} The following information pertains to and was
furnished by a self-admitted Cuban intelligence agent
who 1s presently in tne United States. This man, hereafter
referred to as the source, was recruited in Cuba by
the Cuban Intelligence Service (CIS), and after receiving
extensive training by CIS, was dispatched to the United
States, entering at Miami, Florida, as a refugee. The
| reliability of the source has not as yet been definitely
established. \

The source advised that he had not been a
member of any organization in Cuba devoted to the over-
throw of the government of then-President Fulgencio
Batista prior to the fall of Batista and the subsequent
taking over of the government by Fidel Castro on January
1, 1959. He had no connections with the Castro regime
during tne period, between January 1, 1959 and approximately
November, 1961, when, through the assistance of Roberto
Roque, source obtained a position with the Municipa:
Government of the City of Havana, Cuba.

Source advised that Roque is an official in the
Ministry of Interior and works with Ramiro Valdez, the
head of that agency. Approximately 4s years ago
when source first met Roque the latter was a Captain in

Subsequent to receipt of above information,
source was shown a photograph of Roberto Agustin Roque
Perez, United States Immigration and Naturalization
Service (INS) fiie number All 078 i159. Source immediately,
on the basis of this photograph, identified

Agustin Roque Perez as the individual known to him in

Cuba as Roberto Roque. INS records reflect Reque, born
November 15, 1935, in Havana, Cuba, and further reflect
that-te-restded in the United States for a period of time
prior to January, 1959, when it was determined he had
returned to Cuba.

In approximately February, 1962, and again
through the assistance of Roberto Roque, source was
enrolled in a school operated by the Cuban Government
located in the Palatino, just outside the city limits
of Havana, which school is known as the Escuela Basica
de Instruccion Revolucionaria (Basic School of Revolutionary
Instruction). Students at this aghool were taught
philosophy of Marxism-Leninism, together with political
economies and general Communist and anti-United States
propaganda. The school was a political and propaganda
indoctrination school and students were told they might
pecome propaganda instructors in Cuba or other Latin
American countries. No mention was made of the possibility
they might be called upon to teach progaganda in the
United States. Some of the individuals attending this
school were there because they desired better jobs while
others were afraid of losing their jobs with the Cuban
Government. There were approximately 50 students in the
class and sessions were held from 1:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m.
with supper being served at the school. The teacher was
en individual named Xiques, who was about 20 to 22 years
sid, 5’ 2" tall, small buiid, black hair and eyes.

He wes always dressed in a uniform with a’ green boina.
Source does not believe Xiques had been in the United
States.

In April, 1962, source enrolled in another
school maintained by the Cuban Government known as
| the Centro Provincial de Instruccion Revolucionario
(Provincial Center of Revolutionary Instruction). This
school was then located in Reparto La Coronela, Marianao,
} Havana, Cuba. This institution provided approximately
the same studies as the Basic Schooi mentioned above,
but of a more intense nature. Courses included study
of the works of MAO Tse-tung. The school during the
spring of 1962, had approximately 275 to 300 students
and was divided into five classes. Students resided at
the school including both men and women and were together
during the day in the classrooms and dining rooms, but
were separated by sex in sleeping quarters. The men
wore blue pants and white tee-shirts during the day and
a gray shirt with blue pants in the evening. The- uniform
for the women during the entire day consisted of blue
pants and gray shirt. Classes began at 7:15 a.m. and
proceedod throughout the day with recesses. Classes
ended at 4:30 p.m. but resumed after dinner and’ continued
until 10:50 p.m. Discipline was very strict. ¢ Source
believed that the instructors who were young had received
training from Blas Roca, 2 functionary of the Cuban
Communist Party. A man named Carlos Walfrido ‘who was
| about 25 years old was in charge of the teachers. His
| place was subsequently taken by a woman named Esperanza
Franca. : , =

During the time source attended these schools,
he never heard any remarks about training students for
possible intelligence work and he does not know whether
any of the students, in addition to himself, were chosen
py CIS for intelligence training. Intelligence study in
Cuba is very secretive and it was never mentioned in
either school. P77

Cuban Intelligence Matters

Source stated that Roberto Roque on one
occasion had discussed with the source the possibility
of the latter making a career in the Cuban Government,
and mentioned several agencies including the Cuban
Diplomatic Service. Services mentioned by Roque ineluded
working for the Cuban Government abroad. Source indicated
that he was.interested in such work and his enrollment.
in the two indoctrination schools, mentioned above,
through the help of Roque followed.

After being "sounded out" by Roque the
latter obtained considerable background and piographical
data concerning the source in interviews with the source.
Some time later while yet attending the Provincial Center
school, source received a telephone call from a man
who identified himself only as "Sanchez" and who stated
that he worked in "foreign affairs for the ORI.” (ORI-
the Integrated Revolutionary Organizations, which at
that time was the sole political party in Cuba). "Sanchez"
made arrangements to meet the source personally and
thereafter talked with the source three or four times.
The conversation concerned source's background and how
it was necessary to fight Capitalism. One day "Sanchez"
telephoned source and told him another comrade would now
work with him, Later that day "Sanchez" introduced him
to "Manolo", who thereafter served as source's principal.
Source never saw "Sanchez" personally after this but
several months later saw a picture in a newspaper of
an individual who had been arrested in New York city
on charges of attempted sabotage. This newspaper picture
was a photograph of Roberto Santiesteban whom source
stated was the individual previously known to him as
"Sanchez".

It is noted that Roberto Santiesteban
__ Casanova who was then serving as an
Attache at the Cuban Mission to the
United Nations in New York City, was

arrested on November 16, 1962,

in New York City, by agents of

the Federal Bureau of Investigation
acting under a warrant charging
Santiesteban with violation of
Section 951, Title 18, United States
Code, which section deals with
notification of the Secretary of
State by agents of foreign govern-
ments, and conspiracy to violate
the sabotage statutes. He was
indicted on November 21, 1962, by a
Federal Grand Jury in New York City;
however, on April 22, 1963, indict-
ment against him was dismissed and
he was returned to Cuba as part of
an exchange for the release of a
number of Americans held by Cuba.

Source stated that some time in October or
November, 1962, he began to receive training .in subjects
relating to espionage and intelligence. His training
continued until July, 1963, when the source left Cuba
for the United States. He did not go to any school for
this training but instead was taught by individual
instructors in various locations in the Havana area.
The overall direction of his training was handled by
his principal, Manolo, who introduced him to the
individual instructors as he progressed in his training.

Source described Manolo as follows:

in the United States. On one of these occasions Manolo
instructed source to find three dead drops in New York
City and to furnish a description of the location and if
possible a picture of tne drops. "they" would approve
or disapprove these drops. Txo of the drops would be
for actual use and a third was a reserve drop. On
another occasion Manolo told source that if he ever
changed his mind that he would come to the United States
and kill him. Manolo also indicated a definite desire
to come to the United States at some future date and
mentioned the possibility of entering the United States
by means of a false passport through Méxttos

congregate. Parks, cemeteries, and highways were also
recommended to him as good locations. Dead drops .
were to be used by CIS to send money and equipment and
are in turn used by the intelligence agent to place
information and other material. A sign such as a
chalk mark or a nail on a wall indicates that material
has been placed in the drop while a counter sign
reflects it has been removed. Instructions in dead
drops was given the source by a man named Victor whose
last name is unknown, and this instruction lasted one
week. Source described Victor as follows:

Source said Julio may possibly have been a
member of the military, Dut wore a uniform on only one
1 eceasion during the training period.

Cipher System and Secret Writing

Source was instructed in the use of a cipher
system utilizing. a sentence in Spanish as the "pensamiento"
or scheme, which in turn is broken down into a "consigna"
or watchword, and three "gamas" or scales. The system then
utilizes exchange and substitution of numbers for letters,
and the numbers are placed in groups of five to form messages.
Source was instructed and given practice in both encipherment
and decipherment of messages.

Scurce was also provided with a secret writing
system (Tirta Invisible) which requires only bond paper,
a pen nib, and saliva. One sheet of paper is crushed into
a ball, an¢ is used to rub another sheet of the paper. Then,
with a pen nib, using saliva as "ink", a message is written
on the side of the sheet previously rubbed. The sheet then
is passed over steam, and placed under a heavy book for
Several hours. An inocucus letter is then written on the
reverse side of the sheet, using Parker ink, The mesaage
is then placed in an envelope which is not moistened with
the tongue but which is sealed with glue. On each side
of the flap, about one inch from the apex, the glue is not
used for about one-half inch. This enables receiver of the
letter to determine whether letter has been opened or note
To show the letter contains secret writing, the return address
is formed of any name having the initials "TI", that is,
*tinta invisible”.

Secret writing to be received by source from
Cuba is developed by placing sheet of writing in tepid water
until message appears.
