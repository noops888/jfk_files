Haterville, Maine.

Speciel Agent with the FBI from 1940 to 1947, and upon re-

This ventura culminated

in bankruptcy in 1952. He then re-entered Government service

witis the Small Business Adninistration in liashington, D. C.,

and was appointed Special Assistant to the Administrator with

the specific duty of Director of Security. In February of

1954, he was forced to resign fron SBA because of political

reasons,

determined to be the result of backing the wrony

political party in the election. He then set up his own

investigative organization known as Robert A. Mahou Associates.

Mr. laneu was recruited by the Office of Security in

March of 1954. He was previously known to kir. Robert i.

Gunningham (deceased) who sas,

at that time, Chief, Special

Security Division, through their mutual employaent by the

FBI.

utilized by the Office in extrenely sensitive cases. "iti

the approval of the Director of security, Subject was offered

a proposition wherein he was to receive $500.00 per monta,

with the stipulation that he nove into his on office and

that he he on call for any assignments by the Office of

Security. He agreed to this and innodiately took steps to

move out of his grea, where he rented desk space in a suite

occupied by Carnine S. Bellino, a forner PBI agent and CPA.

In July of 1954, Maheu was engaged by 'British shipping

interests" to check on Aristotle Onassis' activities while

in the United States.

Onassis' New Yorl office. It was later learned that the

principal "British interos?" was Stavros Niarchus and that

the ultimate

goal of this task was to scrap the Onassis/

Saudi oil doal. Maheu took the job but conditioned his

accaptance with the fact that he would do nothing ininical

to the li. S. Goverament.

Any infornation developed of interest

to the inited States was to be passed by liaheu to the appro-

priate fovernment azency.

paper citing dangers to U.S. economy and trade resulting

fron the Onassis deal. Through contacts in FOA, Maheu

had Harold Stassen read this paper in the National Security

Council on 22 June 1954. During this same perica Maheu

briefed Scott McLeod, Assistant Secretary of State for

Security and Consular Affairs on the project.

of Niarchus claining Governnent privilege in the case, the
