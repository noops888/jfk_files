SUBJECT: Robert A. Mahou

Mr. Robert A. Maheu was born on 30 October 1917 in
Waterville, Maine. He graduated fron Holy Cross College in 1940
and is married with four children. He was employed as a
Special Agent with the FBI from 1940 to 1947, and upon re-
“Signing from the Bureau, formed a private enterprise doing
business as "Dairy Dream Products." This venture culminated
in bankruptcy in 1952. He thea re-entered Government service
with the Small Business Adninistration in Washington, D. c.,
and was appointed Special Assistant to the Administrator with
the specific duty of Director of Security. In February of
1954, he was forced to resign from SBA because of political
reasons, determined to be the result of backing the wrong
‘political party in the election, He then set up his own :
investigative organization known as Robert A. Mahou Associates,

Mr. Maheu was recruited by the Office of Security in
March of 1954. He was previously known to Mr. Robert H.
Cunningham (deceased) who Was, at that tine, Chief, Special
Security Division, through their mutual employment by the
FBI. Cunninghaa saw in NMaheu a covert asset ssho could be
utilized by the Office in extremely sensitive cases. “With
the approval of the Director of Security, Subject was offered
& proposition wherein he was to receive $500.90 per nonth,
with the stipulation that he nove into his own office and
that he be on call for any assignments by the O£fice of
Security. He agreed to this and lumediately took steps to
move out of his srea, where he rented desk space in a suite .
occupied by Carmine S, Bellino, a former PBI agent and CPA.

In July of 1954, Maheu was engaged by “British shipping
interests” to check on Aristotle Onassis" activities while
in the United States. This included technical coverags of
Onassis’ New York office. .It was later learaed that the
principal “British interest" was Stavros Niarchus and that
the ultimate goal of this task was to scrap the Onassis/
Saudi oi1 doai. Maheu took the job but conditioned his
Scceptance with the fact that he would do nothing inimical
to the U. S. Government. Any information developed of interest
to the United States was to be passed by Mahev to the appro-
priate Covernment agency.



During this operation Maheu had his staff prepare a
paper citing dangers to U. S. economy and trade resulting
from the Onassis deal. Through contacts in FOA, Maheu
had Harold Stassen read this paper in the National Security
Council on 22 June 1954. During this same pericd Maheu
briefed Scott McLeod, Assistant Secretary of State for
Security and Consular Affeirs on the project. McLeod
agreed to furnish State commo and pouch facilities subject
to Jonn Foster Dulles’ approval. Additionally, Maheu
briefed J. Edgar Hoover and Vice President Nixon.

In August of 1954, Maheu advised this Office of his rela-
tionship with Niarchus. NEA Division was contacted end
expressed interest in this matter. They were put in touch
with Maheu and furnished him a como channel,-a pouch systen
and operational guidance. International litigation erupted
as a result of the Onassis/Niarchus Matter, and as a result
of Niarchus claiming Government privilege in the case, the
Agency was subsequently identified as being the Government
agency involved. Files of this Office reflect extensive
correspondence furnished us by the Office of General Counsel
in 1956 regarding the Onassis matter.

Cn 16 August 1954 Subject was granted a covert security,
Clearance for utilization as an agent under Project TWIXT.
in the Near East. On 30 August 1954 he was granted a sinilar
clearance to permit his use in the United States as a covert

associate under P-: HIDDEN. In November of 1957, a
cable from indicated that Mr. Maheu had
allegedly been involved in a violation of the Mann Act in

procuring and transporting prostitutes for
during (ae to the United fc
Nr. Mah s Office to advise that the allegations

were without foundation and stated that he would take steps
immediately to have his attorney see that appropriate
officials would retract the charges. This was
subsequently done. Edward Bennett Williams acted as Maheu's
lawyer in this matter. :

In 1957 information was received indicating that during
President Sukarno's visit to Moscow in the fall of 1956, he was
introduced to a Soviet woman within the Kremlin. He had
an affair with her against the admonitions of his advisers.

It was reported that the Soviets took detailed films of the
affair and that a copy was sent to the PKI. In June of 1957
Al Ulmer and Samuel Halpern, FE Division, contacted the

Director of Security and outlined a project wherein they .
envisioned a film being made simulating this affair. It

was planned that clips from this film would be inserted in

a leaflet for distribution throughout Southeast Asia sug-

gesting that Sukarno was compromised by the Soviets. In

July of 1957, Robert Mahew was given this assignment. He

utilized a trusted male employee of this organization (since
deceased) and-his fiance. Maheu after an intensive make-up

cours?, administered the make-up to the participants himself, i
utilizing available pictures and descriptions of the subjects :
as a guide. He hired a studio where he was given detailed i
jnstrection on the use of the lights and canera. Waen the z
film was taken, only Haheu and the two perticipaats were in
the studio. The project known as “Happy Days,” was never
completed and the film was not distributed.

Files of this Office reflect that during the 1958-1959
period, FE Division was put in touch with Maheu by this 7
Office for assistance in another operetion relating to : i
President Sukarno. This project was originated in Mey 1958 :
when FE Division initially contacted the Director of Security
and briefed him on the project known as GIARPSTAR. Basically,
the project capitalized on President Sukarno's known weakness
for Caucasion women. Robert Maheu was given the assignment '
to locate a female-candidate. He advised that a proninsnt

attorney and “man about town," could

come up with a qualified woman. was “Investigated with

and the DCI. . : i

Office, met with Qg@Miiee in New York City. @pethiigge vas

would ostensibly be her secretary but would be, in fact,

the person she would look to for direction.

Records of this Office do not reflect any of the
activities of fie during the course of her mission. It
is known that she did meet Sukarno, but due to unfortunate
tining that had hin leaving his country on official business,
she had little time to cultivate hin. Consequently, the
Purpose of the nission was not fulfilled, The last kaoxn
Contacteg@@M—A had with the Agency was in the form of a tele-
phone call on 12 April 1961 when she called on a sterile line
and totked to Mr. Hugh Tovar, who. she knew-as George Uenry.

She advised that one “had asked her to sive a
party for President Sukarao wio would be in Los Angeles on
21 April 1561. wanted to know whether the Agency was

interested in spousoring this party. A negative response
was given. :

In June of 1959, a covert security approval was Assued

approached and advised of Agency interest in InteruationaL
Labor. Files of this Office do not reflect whether or not
this was done. On 7 Cctober 1959 a covert security approval

In August of 1969, Richard M. Bissell, the then DD/P
contacted the Director of Security regarding the Roselli
matter. Details concerning this are set forth in Attachzent B,

In 1966 information was received by the Agency indicating
that the Senate Administrative Practices Subcommittee, under
the chairmanship of Senator Edward V. Long, had advised Maheu
that his testimony was desired concerning Ris relationship
with Onassis, Savros Niarchos, Sam Giancana and : .

ne Subcommittee interest was invasion of privacy and



particularly the use of audio devices by private: investigators.
In July of 1366, Senator Long was alerted to the fact that

the Agency had had sensitive operational contacts with Maheu.
Senator Long was told that the Agency had used Maheu over

the years on a number of occasions but that he had never

been asked to engage in any wiretapping and had never

cagaged in any such activities on our behalf. Office of
Security files do not indicate whether or not Maken did

appear before this Subcommittee, although it appears thar

he did not,

In January of 1971, in light of the involvement of
Maheu in a suit between executives of the Hughes Company
and Maheu, the Director of Security recommended to the DCI
that all existing clearances with Maheu and Associates be
terminated. The DCI concurred in this recommendation.

Files of this Office reflect that Subject'’s company,

Maheu and Associates, cooperated with the Agency in supporting
the activities of an LPGLOBE agent, J

in Ecuador.

A memorandum from the Chief, Central Cover Staff to
the Inspeator General dated 19 Cctober 1973, delineates the
relationship between CCS and Robert Maheu and Associates,

SUBJECT: Ths Johnny Roselli Matter ” ; es

1. In August of 1960 Mr. Richard Bissell approached :
the then Director of Security, Colonel Sheffield Edwards, |
to determine if the Office of Security had any assets that
might assist in a sensitive mission requiring gangster-type
action. The mission target was Fidel Castro. Because of -
its extreme sensitivity, only 2 small group was knowledgeable
of the project. The DCI was briefed and gave his approval. :
Colonel J. C. Xing, Chief, WH Division, was briefed, but all
details were concealed fron any of the JMWAVE officiais. z
Certain TSD and Communications personnel participated in
the initial Planning stages but were not witting of the.
purpose of the mission. : :

2. Robert Maheu was contacted, briefed generally on
the project, and requested to astertain if he could develop
en entree inte gangster elements. Mr. Maheu advised that he
had met one Johnny Roselli on several occasions while visiting
Las Yeges. Maheu knew Roselli enly casually through Clients.
but had been given to understand that Roselli.was a high -
ranking member of the "Syndicate" and Controlled 211 of the i
"  iee making machines on the Strip. Maheu was asked to pee eeeree
approach Roselli, who knew Mahan as a personal relations = - "-
executive handling domestic and foreign accounts. Naheu ee
was to tell Roselli that he had receatly been obtained by a cli-
ent who represented several international business firas which . .
were suffering heavy financial losses in-Cuba as a result of ~
Castro's action. These firms were convinced that Castro's a
femoval was the answer to the probleag and were willing to  -
pay 2 price of $150,000 for its successful accomplishment.
It was ta be made clear to Roselli that the United States ae
Government was not and should not become aware of this -
operation. an fie =

3. The pitch was made to Roselli on 14 September 1960
at the Hilton Plaza Hotel, New York City. Hr. James O'Connell,
Office of Security, was present daring this meeting sad was
identified to Roselli as an employae of Maheu. O'Connell
actively served as Roselli's contact until May 1962 at which
tine he phased out due to an overseas assignment. Roseili'ts

initial reaction was to avoid getting involved, but through
.Maheu's persuasion he agreed to introduce him to a friend,

Sam Gold... Roselli made it clear that he would not want

any money for his part, and he believed that Gold would

feel the same way. Neither of these individuals were ever paid
out of Agency fnnds. : ~ aoe :

4. During the week of 25 September 1960, Haheu was

introduced to Gold at the Fontainebleau Hotel, Miami Beach.
During this meeting Naheu also met an individual identified.

as "Joe" who.was supposedly a courier operating between Se
,Havena and Miami. Several weeks later Maheu saw photographs
“o£ doth of these individusis in the Sunday Supplemental © :
Parate. They were identified as Momo Salvatore Giancana

and Santos Trafficant. Both were on the list of the

Attornsy General's ten most wanted men. Giancana was
described as the Chicago Chieftan of the Cosa Nostra and
successor to Al Capone. Trafficant was identified as the

Cosa Nostra boss of Cuban cperations. Mahenu called this ~
Office imaediately upon ascertaining this information.

5. -In discussing the possible methods of accomplishing
_the mission, Sam suggested that they not resort to firearms
“but that he be. furnished some type of potent pill that could
be placed in Castro's food or drink. Gold indicated that
he had a prospective nominee in the person of Juan Orte, a

Cuban official who had been receiving kickback payments for -
@ gambling interest and who still had access to Castro and: ~
5 was still in a financial bind: als

7 6. TSD was regzested to produce six pills of.high--* —

- lethal content which were then delivered to Orta by “Joo.”
After several weeks of reported atrenpts,.Orta apparently .. -.<
got cold feet and asked out of the assignment. He suggested. _
another. candidate who made several attempts without success. .-
"Joe" then indicated that Dr. Anthony Verona, ons of the -  -
principal officers in the Cuban exile junta, had become eects
disaffected with the apparent ineffectual progress of the -
junta and was willing to handle the mission through. his.
own resources. Verona asked that he he given $10,000 for
organization expenses and requested..$1,000 worth of communi-~ :
cations equipment. Dr. Verona's potential was never fully i
exploited as tho mission wes cancelled shortly after the {
-Bay of Pigs ¢pisode. Verona wes advised the offer was
withdrawn, and the pills were retrieved: At the néight of

tinea. The technician involved in the assignnent
was discovered in the process, arrested, and taken to the
sheriff's ofice for questioning. He called Maheu in the
presence of sheziff's personnel and informed him that he
had been detained. Subsequently, the Department of Justitx
announced its intention to prosecute Maheu slong with the

attorney, who stated -that ail avenues of appeal had been ex-
hausted and Roselli faced deportation: Waddin indicated that
if someone did not intercede on Roselli's behalf, he would
make a complete expose of his activity with the Agency. Oa
13 November 1970 Mr. Helms was briefed on this latest develop- .
- ment and it was decided that the Agency would not in any way
‘assist Roselli. Maheu was advised of the Agency's position —..
- and was in complete agreement. . He stated that he was not
concerned about any pudlicity as it affected hin personally
