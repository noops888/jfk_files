since his move to the Residence/Club in mid-1970,

ABBOOR

has appeared to witheraw from almost all overt activity.

Rarely does he appear on BILOCULAR and his daily routine is a

complete mystery.

In order to determine his present status,

the BIBAFFLEs were directed to run a surveillance on AEBOOR

were so insaned.

His overt subordinate in the cultural

field, 201-820310, had left PCS without a replacement.

Presumably his cover activities would be multiplled.

Despito

all this, ABBOOR maintained a spartan routine which left

no

clue about his present interests, activities, or responsibilitles.

?. Host mornings (Including Saturday and Sunday), he

drove or walked to the Embassy,

often buying a paper on the

Once inside he stayed until about 1300 hours when he

returned to the Residence/Club. His lunch break was rarely

Longer than a half hour.

Ho returned to the Embassy. and

stayed at least until 2000 hours, sometimes until 2200 hours.

Upon leaving, he walked or drove directly to the Residence/

Club and never came out again during the night.

observed that he carrlos a lot of weight over the rest of the personal, as

he la riven deferential attention and respect not only as official but

1. Ho have kept you up to dite pn AbbOOR's sudden move and the

subsequent termination of AELANYARD.

alt the present time, we still

do not know whether or not the story of & sudden transfer

City was in reality the basis for the move or 1f a compromise of the

operation was the actual cause.

As wo pointod out in our criginal

cablo, our immediate thought was that perhape the L

•had causod all AEKICK types to "pull in" and that perhaps AEBOOR

was simply following orders.

Subsequent investigation, however,

tended to discredit this thought.

The AlLANYARD transcripts reveal that ABBOOR did indeed

contemplate the move suveral days before we actually had wind of 1t.

the lazican Imbasay and although wu were not certain, it appeared

that ho was anxious to learn 1f his viaa had been granted.

4.

We have not beer able as yot to establish direct social

contact with AEBOOR. Both Nina T. MARGANUE and Paul W. LEVERONE

(who mve logitimate roason to seek him out) have tried, but to

date, to no avail. Ou* hope has been to have AFBOOR actually tell

us of his plans - will he indeed be transforrod tu

Mexico?

Our

original thought was that the Mexico Station could readily determine

1f he had indeed applied for a visa to that country. As you know,

we struck out here also.

5.

The fact is that as of this writing,

we do not know

whether AEBOOR's move was routine and innocent or if indeed there

If AEROOR does Judead pick up

and move to mexico, we shall, of courge, be somewhat relieved.

However,

this will

not answer categorically the major quostion

waS tho

operation comprouised?

It would appear that regardless of

what happens to AEBOOR, we shall never know

the actual reason for

nia move.

However, for what it is worth, the evidence here does

not point toward a compromige.

i.

The detalled analysis of the Station's operational

efforts againat some of the priority FISTEAL targets and the

Buggestion that perhaps AEBOOR offcred the best immediate

oparational promise and warranted special attention was re

viewed and disoussed by the interested officers; It should

some as no susprise to Headquarters that there 18 really 11t-

tle divergence of opinion, not only as to the priority tar

get, but also insofar as operational approach and conduct 15

congernad.

We would l1ke to correct the apparent Headquarters

Impression that the Station was negligent in the follow-up of

operational opportunities and was waiting for the PUStEALibs

to take the Initlative insofar as future controts were con-

pornod.

We belleve Station efforts have been as aggrUBbIve

as possible in the existing ovorational climate, and 1f we

were remiss, lt was in falsing to repost in detall

the varfous

negative results of what we conelder normal operational efforte.

?. ABBOOR was seleoted as one of the priority station

targets for the simple reason that three offloerr had direct

sodess to him through Identlty, once he aooepted the invita-

tion to Paul W.. LEVERONI's homo he was moved up to the bop of

the priority list since it was hoped that continued and rather

frequent centeot dould te maintilned for assessment and opera-

Elonal purposes.

up the first sovial contact (experience has shown that the

FISTEALers heis will not take the initiative and must be

eotively pursued) but a number os conversations (boch face

to face and by phone)

ended up in the vague promise on the

part of subject that

"re must get together goon"

• In the

Interim

the Station tightened the coverage of AEBOOR Ly

Rutting AELANIARD on a

24-hour-a-day basis for a little over

two weeks and by conducting full coverage surveillarce for

about one week.

Our reasoning behind this acting wis 23 fol-

lOWB: such Intensive coverage would possibiy permit us to

spot a likaly place where we could inject an arcess agent;

It would giva us a-better "feel" of his dally activity; 1t

might uncover one or more of his clandestine contacts.

The

results of the effort, while far from solvirg our problems,

did give us a wealth of information which should help us in

our operational planning-once AEBOOR returns to his station.
