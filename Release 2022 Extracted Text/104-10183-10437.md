MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Meeting with AMBUNNY-1 (291-775391) and
AMWHIP21 (201-267966)

DATE: 25 May 1965, 1900-2039 hours
PLACE: Office of AMWHIP-1, 31 W, 47th St., New York, N.Y.

PRESENT: AMBUNNY-1, AMWHIP-1, and DAMICONE using alias of
Al MARIN

1. I had introduced AMBUNNY-1 and AMWHIP-1 to each other ‘
24 Way but the office was crowded, so there was very little :
Opportunity to discuss operational matters. We met again
on the above date, after business hours, and wo were able
to meet in private. Although AMWHIP told me that he was
delighted with AMBUNNY-1 herself, as he said the ‘Cubans
like that kind of girl -~ not too fancy", he thought that
S rly her previously working for the
95; )would make the operation very
Fisky. He said that ifpil were discovered that AMPUNNY-1 was
& penetration of the (JNBNAFU-19 office (by the Cubars} bis
connection with ODYOKE would thenbe revealed, with the result
that all bis “connections” withCUNSNAFU-19, and “Habana” would
be lost. AMWIIP+1 opined that he thought it likely that ‘the
Cubans would check ber out in iivis

2. AMWHIP suggested the’ Possibility of using a cutout
to introduce AMBUNNY-1 to the (USBNAFU-19 installation. He
said he would explain in detail at a later time, what he
meant, obviously not wanting to reveal any more than necessary

to AMBUNNY-1.

3. Also, AMWHIP.1 stated that he was unable to travel
to Paris before mid-June, as he nad soe relatives coming
to visit him from Italy. After checking with DI UBALDO,

I subsequently informed AMMHIP-1 and AMBUNNY=-1 that the
(5-4 @aris operation was off. Both expressed relief. I told
AMPUNNY=1 that she could most likely sttll be utilized in
\2-2 (avad, and that we would discuss the possibilities at a
ater date.
