TO :

Rick Cinquegrana, D/ IG/ INV

Judy Sholes, AD/IG/ INV

FROM:

Jerry. Owens, (C), OIG/IMO

SUBJECT:

(AIUO) Possible Illegal Destruction of Records

(AIUO) The OIG/IMO received a request from the

AD/IG/INV to search for records needed to verify certain

nominees.

During the course of this search, the IMO

discovered what appeared to be the inadvertent destruction

of permanent OIG records.

2. (AIUO) The records, cases from 1977,

were retired

in 1980.

See exhibit A for a copy of the original records

retirement request.

3. (C) When form 140 (exhibit A) was approved by the

Agency Archives and Records Center (AARC) and returned with

a job number (80-01770R), the records were prepared in

folders, placed in boxes, and a shelflist was created (see

exhibit B for shelflist).

4. (AIUO) Please take notice of the highlighted

portion of the shelflist that claims the records disposition

as 'permanent'.

This

along with the use of the terminology

'case no.', led me to believe

these were permanent records.

5. (AIUO) Exhibit C is a completed request (form

141b) from AARC for authority to destroy these records.

of the records except those listed on a handwritten note

(exhibit D) attached to form 14lb were destroyed.

All

6.

(AIUO)

At this point, I referred to the original

form 140 (exhibit A) to determine what Records Control

Schedule

(RCS) and Item Number was used to retire these

records in 1980.

I ordered a copy of the old RCS 07-76 and

checked the disposition of item number '3b' (see highlighted

section of exhibit E).

The disposition does allow for the

lawful destruction of these temporary. records.

SUBJECT: (AIUO) Possible Illegal Destruction of Records

7.

(AIUO) I then noticed that the destruction

authorization form 141b (exhibit C) listed the RCS as 10-84

and the Item Number as 29B.

Referring to the newer version

of the RCS I found that this schedule and item number also

allow for the lawful

destruction of these temporary records.

Please see the highlighted text of exhibit F.

8.

(AIUO) At this juncture, I reviewed the material

and noticed a note on exhibit D that stated, "IG 37/77

Lonnquist (Kennedy Assassination) destroyed on 5/1/95 by

s.K. "

9.

(AIUO) Please see the attached JFK Assassination

Act (exhibit G), para (a) (1) thru (6). In short, this law

was enacted in

1992 and these records were destroyed in

1995. The fact the records were scheduled as temporary and

then destroyed according to Agency regulations does not

override Public Law 102-526, the JFK Assassination Act.

10. (AIUO) I found three

entries in Textware on

Lonnquist. Two pertain to nothing of interest in this case;

however the third entry states,

"allegations regarding the

Lee Harvey Oswald file" (see the highlighted text of exhibit

H) .

11.

(AIUO.) In May 1997, I told the JFK Assassination

Review Board (ARB), in an informal hearing, that OIG had no

knowledge or record of any JFK records under OIG's perview

being destroyed.

This was during discussions at the table,

and not one of the listed questions for the OIG/IMO to

answer.

(AIUO) My plan is to contact the DCI/IMO, enlist

his assistance in notifying the National Archives and

Records Administration (NARA) and the ARB that records

pertaining to the JFK Assassination were inadvertently

destroyed and explain in detail the events surrounding the

discovery and what steps have been taken to prevent this

from happening again.

13. (AIUO) I personally doubt that there was anything

of value to the ARB in the Lonnquist case file, but because

LHO is referenced it is considered a JFK ARB file, and by

law I have to report its destruction to NARA and the ARB.
