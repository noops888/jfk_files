country or if there was any chance of his being allowed in here as

that while attending a social function at the Australian Embassy,
he engaged Canadian Consular Officer Geoffrey FARROW in conver-
sation, Farrow advised that he had been recently approached by
Dr. Harry KERNUY, an Associate Professor of English at the
University of Toronto in Canada, regarding Anerican defectors
