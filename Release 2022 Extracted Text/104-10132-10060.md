MEMORANDUM FOR : The Director of Central Intelligence

SUBJECT “4 Book Review: Portrait of the Assassin by
. Congressman Gerald R. Ford with Joba R.
Stiles,

L. This memorandum is for information only to bring to your
attention a forthcoming book concerning Lee Harvey Oswald dy_
1 Congressman Gerald R. Ford with John R. Stiles, entitled Portrait of
; the Assassin (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1965).

2. dé. Stiles is a long time political associate of Congressman

t Ford and was his special assistant throughout the Coagressman's tenure
as a member of the Warren Commission established to report om the
assassination of President Keanedy. This bock is written not so mach

to tell the story of the assassination of the President as to present a
study of Oswald as @ person and to describe his trips and activities
insefar as they are known, The book is comprised in very large measure
of extended extracts from the published records of the Commiesion, The
j testimony and views of Oswald's mother, wife ead brother, ac well as
others who knew him, are eet forth in some detail. Some emphasis is
laid os Oswald's stormy relations with his wife and his forcefal reactions
te difficalt periods in that relatioaship.

3. Congreseman Ford tells of some of the problems the Com-
mission faced in developing the evidence in the case, but the book is not
} critical of the Commission or of {ts conclusicas. Portrait of the Assassin
\ contains very few references to CIA (pages 13, 17-19, 23, 23-24, 61, 152-3,
291, 352, 460), and these are unobjectionable. Only slight mention is made
of the charge pat forth by Oswald's mother and others that Oswald may
have been a CIA agent. In his conclusions, Ford stresses the importance
of "meaningful human relationships”, and that these are what Oswald lacked.

4. The first chapter of Portrait of the Assassin, entitied

The Commission Gots Its First Shock, deals with the charge, seriously

advanced by Texas law enforcement officials, that Oswald was in fact

an FBI agent and sets forth some of the Commission's deliberations as
te how best te prove the truth or falsity of this claim which was also
being raised by certain other individuals and public media. As Congress-
man Ford and the Commission Report and testimony point out, the charge
was never sustained, However, some of the writing in Chapter 1 is pos-
sibly loose enough to allow for quotation cut of context for those who seek
to damage the image of the FBI. In February, whes ClA saw the galley
proofs of this book, this information was called to the attention of the
FBI on a confidential basis. However, no action was probably takes by
them, becauec there appears to be mo change in the published version
from the text of the galley proofs.
