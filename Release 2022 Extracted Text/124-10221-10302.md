-» and Commanding Officer of a weapons platoon in a Ranger
battalion. In the latter function, POSADA would very
likely have received demolitions training. In March
1965 POSADA was recruited by the Agency to serve as a
Maritime Training Branch instructor in Florida. Information
at that time indicated that he already was reported to be
a "demolitions expert". POSADA also was used as a source
of information on Cuban exile activities. In 1965 POSADA
was involved with Luis SIERRA Lopez who was working with
Roberto ALEJOS Arzu, a Guatemalan who was attempting to
overthrow the Guatemalan Government. POSADA was of interest
to the SIERRA/ALEJOS group because of his knowledge of
2 demolitions and weapons. POSADA reported to the Agency
¢'. | and later to the FBI, on his involvement in and the activities
. of this~yroup (and subsequent other Cuban exile activist
organizations with which he became affiliated). As of
August 1966 he was used solely as an informant on the activities
of the Cuban Representation in Exile (RECE), a Miami-based
exile group. POSADA was formally terminatediin July 1967.
In August 1967 he was mentioned in a Havana Radio broadcast
as-a liaison man between the Agency and RECE. In August
1967 POSADA moved to Caracasfnd secured a position with
DIGEPOL, the Venezuelan security service (now known as
DISIP). he Agency's Caracas Station hired POSADA as an
¢ informant on DIGEPOL/DISIP activities, with secondary use
"as a source on Cuban exile activities in Venezuela.] He ©
functioned in this capacity until 1974 when a change in
i Venezuelan Government administration resulted in the loss
Hl of his job with DISIP. (He was formally terminated by Caracas
; Station on 30 June 1974;"however, occasional contact was
maintained with him at his initiativé]because of certain
outstanding U.S. Federal Income Tax problems POSADA had ™ *
because of his (then) status as a Permanent Resident Alien
of the U.S. In mid-February 1976, POSADA econtacted Caracas
Station to volunteer a reporf]on the whereabouts of Orlando(s
BOSCH Avila, Frank CASTRO Paz, and on a threat to the life

of Salvador ALLENDE's nephew in Costa Rica. [The final con- Bunt
