and Commanding Officer of a weapons platoon in a Ranger

battalion.

In the latter tunction, POSADA would very

likely have received demolitions training. In March

1965 POSADA was recruited by the Agency to serve as a

Maritime Training Branch instructor in Florida.

Information

at that time indicated that he already was reported to be

a "demolitions expert". POSADA also was used as a source

of information

on Cuban exile activities.

In 1965 POSADA

was involved with Luis SIERRA Lopez who was working with

Roberto ALEJOS Arzu, a Guatemalan who was attempting to

overthrow the Guatemalan Government. POSADA was of interest

to the SIERRA/ALEJOS group because of his knowledge of

demolitions and weapons.

POSADA reported to the Agency

and later to the FBI, on his involvement in and the activities

of this group (and subsequent other Cuban exile activist

organizations with which he became affiliated). As of

i no attricies.

August 1966 he was used solely

as an informant on the activities

of

the Cuban Representation in Exile (RECE), a Miami-based

exile group.

POSADA was formally terminated in July 1967.

In August 1967 he was mentioned in a Havana Radio broadcast

as a liaison man between the Agency and RECE.

In August

1967 POSADA moved to Caracasand secured a position with

DIGEPOL, the Venezuelan security service (now known as

DISIP). The Agency's Caracas Station hired POSADA as an

informant on DIGEPOL/DISIP activities, with secondary use

as a source on Cuban exile activities in Venezuela! He (S

functioned in this capacity until 1974 when a change in

Venezuelan Government administration resulted in the loss

of his job with DISIP. He was formally terminated by Caracas

Station on 30 June 1974; however, occasional contact was

maintained with him at his initiativebecause of certain

outstanding U.S. Federal Income Tax problems POSADA had

because

of his (then) status as a Permanent Resident Alien

of the U.S.

In mid-February 1976, POSADA Cecontacted Caracas

Station to volunteer a report on the whereabouts of Orlando(s

BUSCh AvIla, Frank CASIRO laz, and on a

threat to the life

of Salvador

on 22 June 1976(5)

whendhe contacted the Caracas Station to request visa asS

sistance for his wife and himself; the assistance was denied:

7. CARBALLO Diaz, Roberto. CARBALLO received Agency

paramilitary training'as a member of the

2506 Brigade in

preparation for the Bay of Pigs invasion. He was captured

at the Bay of Pigs, and

subsequently was

released by the

Luban Government.

Apart from the 2506 Brigade service, there.

1s no avallable intormation to indicate any subsequent con-

tact between the Agency and CARBALLO.
