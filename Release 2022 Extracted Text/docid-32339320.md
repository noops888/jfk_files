On 2/8/62 and 3/9/52, Mr. A. G. WILKINSON,

Assistant Manager, First National City Bank, 95th Stree

and Broadway, New

York, made available the bank account

of subject's wife, a special checking account number

5720-2842.

A review of this account reflects that there

were weekly deposits in the amount of $59.25 and

all

checks written were in the amounts of less than $30.00

and all were cashed at food stores or for what appeared

to be normal household expenses.

VACB, no further review of subject or his

wife's bank account will be made on a regular basis

but spot checks of his account will be made and a

thorough review if information is received from sources

indicating that

the subject has received a substantial

amount of money.

The Agents who observed subject to participate

In a picket line on January 22, 1962, were ALESIO SAVIOLA

and ANTHONY D. LEONE.

The Agents who observed subject meet with

WILLIAM L. PATTERSON on 1/24/62, are DONALD M. CHAFIN and

HOWARD G. KINNALLY.

A list of subject's toll; calls for a three

month period beginning 9/1/61, has recently been obtained

from the New York Telephone Company and leads to identify

the subscribers of persons called by subject are being

set out by means of a separate communication.
