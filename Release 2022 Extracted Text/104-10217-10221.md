In accordance with Feadquarters' instructions, these meetings

(9300) payment to GIRSON was in laot more than ne had originally intendad to

RECROFILM

On 11 February KUBARK Staff Agent Errol 8. KULPA, who had

contact ulth GIBSON in 1363-64, listened to reference tape and made

the following comments, which may be helpful to Katzenbach.

felt that the GIBSON that he was bearing on the tape had indeed

changed rather radically since the last time KULPA had any contact

KULPA rEDembErS GIBSON aB

and probably (because of this

orientation) anti-U.S.

1s therefore quite suspicious of GIBSON's notivations and advises

that extreme precaution be taken in the hundling of GIBSON.

?. KULPA's vien of Gibson's notivations:

KULPA hag strenuous doubts as to any idealogical motivation

on the part of GIBSON.

He recognizes the obvious monetary

notivation and feels that this probably plays a large part

In the man's being willing to talk to odyoka.

Another very

possible notivatioa 1s GIBSON's disaffection with VERGES.

Parenthetically, KULPA added that in

and probably in

GIBSON was really nothing more than a name that VERGES

wanted on the masthead.

GIBSON's primary duties as

vere probably in the area of translatios.

In light of this

XULPA feels that perhaps sons legitimate information of value

can ba obtained in the area of the

thetically, ""delistic" as his vile.

1t might be noted that KULPA felt that GIBSON

to the aspects of Harxist Leninian that called for revolutionary

change (probably because of his dissatisfaction with a world

In thích the

bad to endure a certain anount of

, he is not a strict doctrinaire in any

On the other hand, KULPA pointed out that

GIBSON'S

wife (who by the way is a Central European by

not British is idealistic in the sense that she feels her

must be internally and idealogically

consistent. (This is why she objected to GIBSON's writing

and why she probably vould get upset if she

anew exactly what type of gase her husband was currently

playing with ODYOKE.)

dress: , stockleiga hall,

Frince Albert Road, London, ii. w. 8.

GIBSON has been cornected with the pro-chinese Cossunist publication

"Revolution" and its predecessor, "Afrioan Revolution", st least since

April, 1963. He nado available the following intornation about biaself as

pert of a publialty caspeiga planned for "Africen Revolution" in the first

ha18 0f 19633-

1959-528

worked in Rone for the Mediterranean News

Bureau of the "Christian Science Monitor";

1955-583

editor with the English language service of

"Agence Frence Presse" in Paris;

1958:

arrested by the irench authorities because or

his work for the algerian National liberation

Front;

1959-60:

returned to the U.S.to and amployed by the

G.B.S. News in New York until dismissed because

of his pro-cuban activities;

ararded a C.B.S. fellonship in African Studios

at columbia University;

1960-Sopteabes, 1962:

Breoutire Socretary of the "Pair Play for Cuba"

Conmittee in the U.S.A.

In 1963, GIBSON lived 1n Lausanne, where "African Revolution" and

subsequently the Inglish edition of "Revolution" mere printed, but he paid

frequent visits to "Revolution's" Paris office until the end of the year

when "Revolution" was banned in Switzerland and he as refused permission to

continue to live there.

He then settled in Paris where,

according to one

report, he and his sife lived in "quite a luxurious flat".

It would, however,

be wrong to infer fron this that GIBSON's means enabled his to enjoy biga

Living standards, as another source subsequently reported that he had sot

pold any rent for the flat fron May to October, 1964.

30

As far back as August, 1963, there mere runours in Coamunist circles in

London that GIBSON was an daerican agent and that he hed provided United

States Intelligence with the nanes of certain unidentified United States

negroes in accordance with a brief receiveù fron the Americans.

Inforestion

fron a vell-placed source suggests that these rumours nay have originated

sron the jealous reactions of tro persons, comected with "Revolution", whose

asporations with the publication were cut short when GIASON becare Editor

of the English adition.

Fowever, by n1d-1964, VERGES, tin Bditorial Director

of "Rerolution", was claising that complaints about GIBS...'s activities had

been received not orly 'fros london, but also from cuba, iaericen negroes in

New York and a relative of GIESON's who was working for the sagasine "Spark"

In Ghana.

As a result, GIBSON nas dismissed fron the editorial staff of

"Revolution", Charges nado against him include the folloting-

with information in an atteapt to discredit "Revolution";

connections with the C.I.k.

Although GIBSON has denied the charges nade against his, he realises that

they have stuck and that 1t «ill be sue years before he will be acceptable

to any loft wing organisation.

40

Having felled to flad employaent in Paris after learing "Revolution"

1n July, 1964, GIBSON went to the United Kingdon on 7th October and was

joined later by his British ulfo, Joy Marjorio, and his tro children. be

hoped to find work in lordon, but at the end of November, he was still

witbout a job and dependent on his nife's fasily, who were paying the rent

of bis flat at 30, Stockleigh Hall, Prinoe Albert Road, Londor, N.W.8. It

Is now known whether GIBSON has been able to find employsent.

5.

Nothing is know at present about GIBSON's contacts in the United

Kingdon.

Although during the tine he worked for "Revolution" he nas in

touch with meabers of the pro-chinese Connunist splinter group in the

United Kingdon - the Contittoo to Defeat Revisionian, for Corrunist Unity -

It Is not known whether he has resumed contact.

It has been reported thet

Norenter 17, 17::

Undied Staieg

One of the most violent reactions came from the heirt-

land of capitalism, fron the amall American faction wilci pre-

duces the monthly Hammer & Steel Newsletter in Boston.

Tie

October issue of the

mineographed bulletin vengefully gives

list of eight reasons why Khrushchev fell - rach one a vin-

dictive crow of triumph, and many attacking not only Khrush-

Pointa 2, 3 and 8 will serve as illus-

trations:

?. His German policy -- Khrushchev sought to ingratiate

himself with

West Germany.

He was obvrously ready

to sell out the German Democratic republic...

The declining influence of the CPSU among the Social-

ist countries and the Communist Parties.

The pro-

posed Moscow gathering was shaping up as a conference

of only those Party leaders ready to openly serve

U.S. imperialist aggression against the national 110-

eration struggles.

For example, Aslan supporters 01

hrushcher could have gathered in a telephone booth.

8.

The nuclear success of People's China. Khrushchev

had

maintained that nuclear power was

the exclusive

responsibility of revisionists and imperiallete

of white nations.

Khrushchev'a great poner chauvin-

inn was blown sky high in Sinkiang Province.

Although there is no evidence that the politically insig-

nificant Hanner & Steel group enjoys any direct support from

the Chinese (as the Russians alleged in their "Open Letter"

of July 14, 1963), it has always offered its allegiance to

Peking in

the most extreme form.

This is expressed agair in

the claim that "Khrushchev's failure to recognize the contra-

diction between the oppressed peoples and iuperialism as the

focal contradiction of our time resulted in blindness concern-

1ug the leading sôle of the Chinese Party "8 Inis is a cialm

that the Chinese themselves would not want to nake, expecially

at this juscture.
