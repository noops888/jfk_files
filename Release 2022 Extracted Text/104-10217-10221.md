@ job [but there was no intention of his accepting it.

3. London has some doubts about whether S/1 in fact received this
much money from GRIPPA. We suspect that he has told people this to enhance
his stature as a we still wonder, though, what funds he
may have been covering this way, since we had not contacted him as of the

* FROM 3 CA/CF; CI/Icc
SUBJECT 2 Richard Gfbson
1. Areas of Knovledgeability. A reading of the transcription of

Gibson's taped debriefing clearly underlines KATZENBACH's assessment
that Gibson possesses an encyclopedic knowledge of personalities and
groups ranging It is not always clear from
the debriefing to it extent Gibson ys either a first-hand imov-
ledge or even a friendly relationship with specific individuals or
@roups. What is clear is that Gibson moves in a milieu on which we
presently have very little coverage; that he is already a member of

, this loosely defined society end thus can be presumed capable of de-

veloping new contacts or strengthening old ones by means of present
acd past associations. i

It is difficult to cate, ze or devine what this milieu is.
It is not the world of + although it contains a pre-
ponderance of Communists; snd it does not seen to be a society vaich
mecessarily revolves about The primary commen
tor covering most of the personalities ccruaiea in Givens sepercine
is some association with the revolutionary movement in Africa -- parti-
eularly [| A se means of characterizing these contacts is

‘the present common thread, almost as general, is asso-

ciation witl although the meaning or clarification of this
political description is never spelled out. In general, Gibson displays
@ good and often personal kmowledge of target areas which might be
grouped as follows:

2. Access and Limitations on Acce: There appareatly has been
| circulated @ charge that Gibson is a CIA it. (This is reflected in
i his 201 as dating from hie days vith In dealing vith this
{ question, however, KATZENBACH cites Gibson's own belief that he is still
jl able to operate in the circles vhich would be of interest to us. It is,
i of course, difficult to tell fron his debriefing the extent and serious-
! ness of this charge against Gibson, insofar as it affects his bona fides.

loyalties and an aura of conspiratorial confusion are everyday facts of
Life and that personal contact end effectiveness in building repport

ment from this debriefing on the firmess and consistency with which he

and dependability, but on the opportunities vhich will emerge and take

Richard GIBSON, the forner editor of the pro-Chinese Coasuniat

4. Ref forwarded the tapes and a rough transoription of the debriefing
session with Subject, which were held on February 17, 13, 19, 23, 1965.

2. In accordance with Headquarters! instructions, these aeetings
were kept on a don't-call—us—vo'll-call-you basis - in fact GT3SON wae given
no meane for calling us. Aleo in accordance with Yeadquartere' instructions,
we did not pay GIBSON at a constant rate of over $190 per hour, The first

\ ($300) payment to GIRSON was in fact more than we had originally intended to
give bin ae a "binder", but in light of the imminence of his trip to Rurope
ws advanced him that sum to help him to meet his expenses. This nicely

“eoincided with our ow time table, since the time he was gone - some three
weeka — ehould have provided adequate tine for the initial tare to be
reviewed and for requirements to be prepared and pouoked to the field. At
a Fates the total sum given to GIBSON, for his time end a ehot at hie

was 8700.

3. LCHARVEST may well feel that it has been done out of $700 in COA

funde. The information obtained on of GIBSON, or on any
d at all, wae alight. GIBSCN claims not to have hed more than very
DWittle contact with them, and not to know too much about them. Unless there
is hard info to the contrary, we are inclined to believe that GIBSON was
telling pretty much the truth in this respect, as indeed seems to have been
the case almost all of the time. While thie ie a bit of a disappointment,
in a way, and seems to lessen the immediacy of LOYARVST interest, it
certainly does not appear to eliminate GISSOK's potential worth.

4. The London Station continues to feel that GIBSON has considerable
potential as a source of positive intelligence on a wide range of targets —
targets that appear to be only lightly covered othorwise, although we are
not always able to judge thie. A review of this debriefing can only cause

one a certain amount of amazement at GISSON'e encyolopedic knowledge of sany,

stopped making notes when euch a topic came up.) This is, as KULPA noted in
OLW 11903 of 12 February 1965, an area of sensitivity with GI3S0N. The only

our conversations. We did not

Aissatisfaction with the in America makes bim
generally anti-American. He dogs say that he would not like to be living
in America for the coming year; but in the context of one who does not wish
to be caught up in a period of growing violence, which GIASON appears not to
believe to be the solution to the problem. Fe states: "I can understand
how they fecl that way, I can recognize the problems, but I sure don't now
vhat the eolution to the problen is." His judguents on

reasonable and real understanding of rany of the forces at work. OT3SON
tends to condemn individuals ~ he spares no sympathy for the F3I, under—
standably - but he does not appear to condemn the United States as a whole,
nor even the United States Government as a whole. At the same time, he
makes no phoney protestations, either.

6. Regarding Cuba, GIBSON showed a similar enctional involvement (he
acknowledges "sy proCastro bias") but, withal, manages to give a more
Dalancee portrayal cf the situation than many rabidly anti-Castro
commentators. (Suba, and Cuban matters, were aloo similarly lowkeyed by
me during our talke.)

7. Where GIBSON really cones into his ow, and really astonishes with
the breadth of his personal information and understanding, (and largely, it
appears, without the same rersonal involvement and bias) is in

fully, provided he hee adequate cover for being where he is ani:doing
what ae does. Tne second index would be for us to test his continuing
access to targets of intercst. It should not take too long te make
such a test without rutting anything into real jeopardy.

We should think that such cover could be arranged.

in due tine.

42. Utilization and lcoale are most closely related, of course.
Prok our vantage point here, it would appear that would be the
ost desirable home base for GIBSCR. Re could range out from thers into

to be, for the foreseeable future, a worthwhile target in its ow right,

as well as the site of a growing number; of
meetings, for which GIBSON would appear to have excertionally fine
credentials. As he says, he could go elsewhere in but

ie where he would fit be We would be inclined to keep him, for the
wost part, away from th Imilieu (except, perhaps, incidentally) ¢°
avoid straining hie re: torial objectivity. In the

end areas, we suspect that careful checking would
ensure such objectivity.

13. His utilization could best be considered on a straight
ipformation-collecting basis. To use him oso would be
not only repugnant to him but destructive of his utility as well.
Presumably he dould te permitted to continue not only for
hie overt earYyere fin ) but perhaps oocasionally
for| f his own choosing, in order to maintain his
own cover. (This is, admittedly, seeing rather far into the future.)

We do feel, however, that GIBSGN could be an admirable and highly valuable
collector of positive information on that whole spectrum of the with
which he is already so familiar.

COSSTREATION



14. GIBSCN and security, to this rointt GIBSON hae met only
myself, under alias, and under the impression that I was here texporarily.
Thie idea was apparently made to etick, throughout our conversations.

We would propose thet, if GIBSON te recruited in fact, he be handled in
alias and at a good, safe distance ~ more than arm's length. Until
gufficient operational testing had been carried-out, we would suggest
that he not have a "reaident case officer" anyvhere - i.e., neither

here nor in Control of GIPSON is partly exercieed by the
documents we have received from kim (receipts, meno of understanding)
plus the volueinous taped comments. These, while not worthy of a court,
are sufficient to do him considercble professions] and personal damage —
note particularly that hie wife, according to him, would not approve of
any of our contacts, and thie appears to be quite meaningful to hin.
Financial oontrel would be a continuing factor. And, perhaps to an
unueually high degree, we feel that GIBSOX would feel considerable
gratitude to whoever (i.e., KUBARK) rescued him from his present and
difficult position, "forgiving all", and providing him with s measure of
respectability (at least in his cm eyes) that he has henceforth been,
unable to achieve and caintain. In sum, we feel that a reasonably ‘
strong combination of control factora exist, and oan be continued for
ae long as GIBSON vould be properly handled.

15. We should also like to conment on the reliability of GIBSON's
comments in the course of our meetings to date. We have found hin to
‘be thoroughly consistent in hie connente and attitudes throughout.

We found no indication of Geliberate deception or serioue attempts to
nislead. He may hove provided some erroneous materials, or he ray have

Beyond that, nothing is definite. If we would like to give him a try,
then, some move should be made to formalise matters with him before he

17. Recognizing that there are risks involved, 1t neverthel
most undesirable to pase up what has the earmarks of being a highly
useful asset. We request, therefore, that Headquarters review and consider
the entirety of cur knowledge of CIZSON to this point, and give us a :

“©” Chief of Station, Paris

2, On 11 February KUBARK Staff Agent Errol 8. KULPA, who had

contact with GIBSON in 1363-64, listened to reference tape and made
the following comments, which may be helpful to Katzenbach. KULPA
felt that the GIBSON that he was hearing on the tape had indeed
changed rather @ the last time KULPA had any contact
with him or the KULPA remembers GIBSON as

is therefore quite suspicious of GIBSON's motivations and advises
that extreme precaution be taken in the handling of GIBSON.

orientation) anti-U.S. KULPA

2. KULPA's view of Gibson's motivations:

KULPA has strenuous doubts as to any idealogical motivation
on the part of GIBSON, Be recognizes the obvious monetary
motivation and feels that this probably plays a large part
in the man's being willing to talk to ODYOKK, Another very
possible motivation is GIBSON's disaffection with VERGES,
Parenthetically, KULPA added that in and probably in

GIBSON was really nothing more than a name that VERGES
wanted on the masthead, GIBSON's primary duties as
were probably in the area of translation. In light of this
KULPA feels that perhaps some legitimate information of value
can be obtsined in the area of the Again, paren—
thetically, it might be noted that KULPA felt that GIBSON
was not as “idedistic" as his wife. Where GIBSON might adhere
to the aspects of Marxism-Leninism that called for revolutionary

change (probably because of his dissatisfaction with a world
in which the had to endure a certain amount of

his beliefs. On the other hand, KULPA pointed out that
GIBSON's wife (who by the way is a Central European by birth--
not British) is idealistic in the sense that she feels her
brand of jmust be internally and idealogically
consistent. (This is why she objected to GIBSON's writing
for nd why she probably would get upset if she
knew exactly what type of game her husband was currently
Playing with ODYOKE.)

1, Forwarded as enclosure are requirements for the debriefing of
Subject. Together with the requirements is a KUDESK narrative op

of Katzenbach, Further background on) can be found, if
you have not already done so, in the following spatches:

ORLA - 39,346, 26 Sept '63

ORL ~ 30,251, 24 Sept ‘64

2. We have not yet bad time to review the tape of your first
session with Subject forwarded with Reference, nor do we expect to
get a transcription completed in time to reach you by 15 February.
The list of names attached to Reference indicate considerable know
ledgeability on the part of Subject as well a tendency to pour out
his knowledge in a sort of stream of consciousness style. We fear
that, 1f given the opportunity, Subject will take the bit in his

~ teeth and as much money as he can in his hot little hands and be

’ off and running. To prevent this we would like to suggest that the
debriefing be set up on a tightly organized, businesslike basis. It
would probably be advisable to write up the terms in a Letter of
Agreement contract for Subject's signature before getting started,
making sure to include a paragraph in which ODYOKE's obligations
and promises are limited to the terms specifically enumerated in the
document, We think that any meaningful debriefing will take 3 - 5
days, and there is good reason to believe that Subject will have

* information of sufficient interest to justify this expenditure of
” Case Officer time. We do not foresee any long range operational
relationship with Subject. While we loom at the debriefing as
basically a cne-shot proposition there will probably be follow-up
questions and, perhaps, specific action requests, requiring a later
contact. Therefore, the communication ‘channel to Subject should be
left open on a "don't call us, we'll call you" basis.

3. In line with the need to put the debriefing on a businesslike
(rather than a "flexible") basis, it might be a good idea to start
by getting Subject to supply a personal history statement from the
time of his first entry into to the
present day. (This can be presented to Subject as a basis for us
to formulate meaningful questions, not as any sort of personal
"confession" on his part.) In addition to providing us with a
check on his veracity, this will set the stage for a debriefing
conducted on KUBARK's terms, not Subject's. It is important that
Ait be made clear to Subject at the outset that we want facts, not
speculation, commertary and analysis. ae

4. Please charge payments to Subject for the debriefing to
Acct, Er. 5137 - 1468 (Hqs. LCHARVEST O0A). Three hundred dollars
for the initial 24 hours talk with Subject is on the steep side.

: Richard Thosas GIBSON
Bor: Les Angeles on 13.5034
: Address: 30, Stockleigh Hall,
. _Frince Albert Road, London, Neti 8s

GIBSON hes been connected with the pro-Chinese Conmunist publication
"Revolution" and its predecessor, "African Revolution", at least since
April, 1963. He made available the following information about hinself as
pert of a publicity compaign planned for “Africen Revolution" in the firet

i ~ half of 1963:

g 1951-52: . worked in Rone for the Mediterranean News

Hy é . Bureau of the “Christian Science Monitor";
se 1955-583 editor with the English language service of

: "Agence France Presse” in Paris;

Hy 1958: arrested by the French authorities because of

: his work for the Algerian National Liberation

Front;

. 1959-60: returned to the U.3,4. and employed by the

.B.S. News in New York until dianissed because
of his pro-Cuben activities;

emarded a C.B.S. fellowship in Afrioan Studies
at Colusbia University;

: 1960-Septenber, 1962: Executive Secretary of the “Fair Play for Cuba"
Committee in the U.S.A.

2, In 1963, GIBSON lived in Lausanne, where “African Revolution" and
subsequently the English edition of "Revolution® were printed, but he paid
frequent visits to "Revolution's” Paris office until the end of the year

when “Revolution” wes banned in Switzerland and he was refused pernission to
eontime to live there. He then settled in Paris where, according to one
‘peport, he end his wife lived in "quite  lumrious flat’. It would, however,
be wrong to infer froz this that GIBSON's means enabled him to enjoy high
Living standards, es another source subsequently reported that he hed not
peda any rent for the flet fron May to October, 1964.

Be As far back as August, 1963, there were rumours in Communist circles in
. ~ Tendon thet GIBSON was an Anerican agent and that he hed provided United
States Intelligence with the names of certain unidentified United States
negroes in accordance with a brief received from the Americans. Information
fron a well-placed source suggests that these rumours may have originated
from the jealous reactions of two persons, connected with "Revolution", whose
aspirations with the publication were cut short when GIBSON becane Editor
of the English edition. However, by mid-1964, VERSES, tie Editorial Director
of "Revolut‘on", was claizing that complaints about GIBS.. activities had
been received not orly ‘froa London, but also from Cuba, rican negroes in
Ses New York and a relative of GIESON's who was working for the sagasine "Spark"
csuieere dm Ghana. As o result, GISSON was dismissed from the editorial staff of
Sater "Revolution". Charges made against him include the following

(0) providing "Newaweex® and the "New York Herald Tribune"
with information in an attenpt to discredit "Revolution";

(a) connections with the C.I.A.
Although GIBSON has denied the charges made egeinst hin, he realises that

they have stuck end that it will be some yeara before he will be acceptable
to any left wing organisation.

4. Having failed to find esployment in Paris after leaving “Revolution”
in July, 1964, GIBSON went to the United Kingdom on 7th October and was
Joined later by his British wife, Joy Marjorie, and his two children, He
boped to find work in London, but at the end of November, he was still
without a job and dependent on his wife's faaily, who were paying the rent
of bis flat at 30, Stockleigh Hall, Prince Albert Road, London, N.W.8. It
1s now known whether GIBSON has been able to find employnent.

Se Nothing is known at present about GIBSON's contacts in the United
Kingdom. Although during the tise he worked for "Revolution" he was in

LOED 5706, 21 January 1965

*— Attached 19 the tape of the interview with GIBSON, recorded in an
office, using a Uher 4000 Report - 5 recorder, recording at a speed
of 15/16 feet: por ‘minute. “The interviewer used the alise of Zerl Wilson.
Gibson arrived at 1745 and departed at about 2030.

2 are not attempting to sunmarise or analyze GIBSOE's comments in
this dispatch. The tape provides much more revealing picture than our
subjective comments could. A fernotes, however, appear to be in order. :

3. Speaking of his departure, GIBSOY said he planned to leave London i

on 24 or 25 January. As of noon 24 J t least, he vas still in London
because I saw him walking on (a potential
problem exists heres GIBSON lve within a few blocks of one another

and not infrequently ride the same bus line. This problem oan only be mot
when it manifests itself.) JAGUAR, incidentally, has alerted ite

contacts (prior to our meeting with OIBSCX) and requested that ve

4. GIBSOH was given money amounting to $300. Under the circumstances
of, his plans, as he exprossed them, it seemed reasonable to do so, to ensure,
at least partially, that he would come back to talk more. He was more than
willing to take the money. and raised the initial suggestion of $200 to $300
or $400. His obvious shift in hie line regarding dollars (as opposed to H

@ further indicative of his willingness to got what he could.

Se The considerable number of nazes mentioned by GIBSON makes the i
transcription of the notes a sizable chore, and in order to lessen this :
Wurden a listing has been compiled of almost all of the names, in the
in whioh they aprear in the tape, with the exception of VERGES and th

land a few others. ‘The names appear only one -
time each on the list, although many of them crop up repeatedly in the tape.

however,

9. In reviewing the tape, it will become apparent that the arrangements
with GIBSON were left fairly flexible for the future. It would eppear, from
his responeos, that a longer range relationship with him oould, in fact, be
established if, after thorough review of his materials, that seems necessary
or desirable.

10. We will expect, in addition to the requirements that have been
promised, that Headquarters will advise us on their desire to arrange for the
one-shot approach previously suggested by Headquarters, or a different am
Yangenent. We are unable to asse: validity or worth of all the coments
he made. Our impression, however, ig that he is reasonably knowledgeable of
a number of fields of interest to us. We also suspect that in some areas his
knowledge is quite superficial. His access to various areas of potential
interest may be partially proved by his trip around Europe and should be a
useful indication of how we may be interested in playing him. The possibility
of his jhas not been overlooked, of course, and we weloome
Headquarters’ comments on this score as well.

11. We would also appreci: jouments on various personalities,
with whon we ere not familiar is the most obvious in this category.

12. Headquarters is requested to provide us with a transcription of this
tape, a9 woll as the promised requirements, prior to 15 February. ODENVY
should also be provided with as much of the material as is of interest to then,

_ and a copy of that material should be givon to us to pass to the ODINVY office

here. We are also obliged to pass to JAGUAR such elements of this material as

” de of legitimate concern to them. In this case, we would suggest that this be

Antorproted rather liberally and Headquartere=prepared copy be forwarded along
with the other items listed above. (Note that JAGUAR has been quite cooperative
while we have be pproaching thia case, and their recent rundown on GIBSON is
being pouched almost simultansously with this dispatch.)

One of the most violent reactions came from the heart—

October issue of the mimeographed bulletin vengefully gives «
list of eight reasons why Khrushchev fell —- each one a vin- -

peaceful coexistence." Points 2, 3} and 6 will serve as illus-
