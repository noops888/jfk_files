A. responds that his wife is upset as a results of events of last few days. In addtion, it seems that

BOLINAGA told here that she should not leave her home unattended. A. says, "Do you know that that

silly Maria Snethlage Santos called yesterday to inform that she read the name of killer in the newspaper

and that she used to know this guy in Havanna?

x: realy?

a. yes, Santos became furious. Felix Torre, who was also at the embassy, was also furious and said that

this woman does nothing but cause trouble, by claiming that she knew this guy in Cuba, and that the next

time she calls again, she will be told to go to hell.

x; 900d. don't say anymore. see you.
