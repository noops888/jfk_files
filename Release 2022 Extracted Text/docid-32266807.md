to keep'a lot of things to himself so I never really questioned

‘him too.mach. I didn't ask where he lived or anything like that

How did you get in touch with him

I never did, well either I called Gino's Classic Cars or else
I didn't get in touch with him. He usually was the one who would
get in touch with me,

do you think that he was mixed up in something that wasn't
exactly on the up and up?

“yes

what makes you feel that way?

just for the different times when he wouldn't give me his phone
number of his address. He said he didn't give it out :to anybody,

just couldn't and a awful lot of times he indicated things but
didn't come right out and say

does he have a lot of cars in there

well uh, he used to have three usually three in the showroom
and he had about three in the back that he was working on and
I don't know if he did sell that Cadillac or if it was stolen
or uh, there had been a car in the paint room

now did you hear that a Cadillac was stolen in the paint room
from California

I had heard that only through reading the paper, as a Matter of
fact someone else called:my attention to it, I didn't even know
and I couldn't understand why Gino didn't mention it to. me that
Monday when he was in. Because from the way I understood. it,
the robbery happened on Friday or Saturday night and Gino was
in here MOnday and I couldn't understand why he didn't say
anything to me a Qe ot oe

you say he had some stuff stolen from the showroom

that is what, I was told from other people

did he have a large number of people hanging out up there -

no, he also had another boy working for him, a young ‘kid,
named Jay, Jerry, Jack his name was Jack. I think he was only
about 16 or 17 3 :
do you know where he lived at

no, he was just.a young kid and then of course the uh man who
lives next door he re-does furni, he refinishes furniture, he
would come over occasionally and the man who has the ‘garage
just down from him would come down, but other than. that

did Gino ever indicate to you that he commuted, commuted between
Bethesda

oh yes
that is a long drive

yes it is, I often asked him why he didn’t bother to get an
apartment or house up here, but he didn't want to ‘

did he ever say why

no

did he ever say why he got located here instead of down in
Bethesda, his business

he said that he felt this was a better location because of its
where it was in relationship to New York and Philadelphia. and

D - some other places, just general it was a better place

M -. why wouldn't New York and Philadelphia necessarily be a good
location to be close to

D- I don't know
M-- you don't know

D- I'm not positive, but I think Gino was thinking of moving out

“Mentioned the fact that you felt there was something, something
wasn't quite right about what Gino was doing and you spent some
time in the shop and everything, did you have any idea what
that might be

D.-*-no, -I uh, I never, I often wondered about it and r even. mentioned
it: to my sister, my sister had advised me to stay away from Gino,
but :

S- well, why did you tell your sister if she advised you to stay’
away from Gino

D- xight off, I just cant think

what about his partner, did he every say anything about him

s-
D - no, not anything much :
S - how often did his partner come down here, about, that you know
D-- oh, not that often, they would call each other quite frequently

you know, like once every day, they would call each other

C - S =. once a day oo gee
D- probably
S - when you say not that often, how often do you mean

D- uk, lets see, I'd say once every few months Jason would be down

to my knowledge not “

M — .how. recently, what is the most recent time that he was down

D - he was definitely down here in JUne because he stopped in to
see me, but he may, I'm not positive, I think he was taking a
plane out of Baltimore and I think he stopped in, I think Gino
had taken him to the airport, but I'm not positive about that

S - out of Baitimore to where, back to New York
D - I have no idea
S - going back to the very recent past, the last time that you saw

Gino was say about two weeks ago

_ Oh, they were giving me a hard time before and like being very
“ £unny towards Gino and you know they were teasing him about
‘you know things like that, that was basically the,. other than

=o=

and he stopped in and was with who

his brother JOe and his sister-in-law and Patrick Sherman
OK, did you get an opportunity to talk to him

yeah

what did the conversation involve

general, his brother had bought a new car and he had brought... :
it down for Gino to look at it to see what Gino thought -
was and the conversation just jumped around about cars and that
was about it f le

what type of car was that, do you know

it was something like a Vega, something like that

he bought it here in Maryland or

no, well his brother bought it in Connecticut and wanted Gino:
to see it and they were on there way to uh Virginia Beach or one
of the beaches for a few days _

did Gino every during the time you said, that you were trying
to break.off the relationship, at least. slow it down some, uh
at-any time during when you were having a good relationship,
did he ever give you any indication of how his business was
doing or anything like that

uh, Gino always tried. to make everyone think that. he was doing

. very well, you known

was. that including you

yeah, occasionally he would you know make a joke if I dontt

get. this car sold that I'm not going to have you know, you
‘know some money, things like that, but usually he-would try

to make it sound as if he was doing very well and he would

try to you know show off his money, try to be very extravigant
with his money

when you were dating Gino, last summer, about how often were
you seeing him

about every week and he would take me almost every week

once or twice a week, something like that

well, I'd see him, you know I would see him two, three, maybe
four times a week and then, uh, Gino did buy me a piece of
jewelry, he bought me a charm for a charm braclet, they had

a going away party for me but that was just you know everybody
had bought me, Gino wouldn't always take me out on my day off
because a lot of things would come up that is another thing that
I couldn't understand is uh we would make plans to go somewhere
and all of a sudden he would call me up that afternoon and say
I'm sorry but I must go to Philadelphia for I must go here, he
just made a recent trip to Philadelphia as a matter of fact, uh
he stopped by to take me with him, but I already had another
date, so he left 7

did he say why he was going to Philadelphia
no, cars usually

this is sort of personal, but did he every purpose marriage
to you k

yeah, we had talked about it
uh, would you say he lived above his means or within his means
I don't know what his means were

did-you get the impression that maybe he is a high roller;
do you know what I mean by high roller

uh, yeah, In some ways I think he was and in other ways I
don't know

did he gamble any to your knowledge

when he was younger he gambled but he dicn't gamble any more

but the time that you have known him, your knowledge ‘he has
never gambled

no he quit gambling
how do you know that he gambled when he was younger

well he told me stories about you know when they used to go
to the race trach and you know things like this

how much, what do you mean by when he was younger

either just getting out of the service or while he was in the
service ae

aid he ever explain to you how he came into money to set. up
his business

no, and I never really asked him, Patrick was always saying

that Gino worked very hard for everything that he has gotten.
Patrick I think was trying to advise Gino to get out of what

he was doing, I don't know what Patrick, when Patrick was drinking
or Patrick would tell me how you know he wishes Gino would
just quit all this and I don't Rnow exactly what Patrick meant

by quiting

did Patrick go by a nickname
no

when. was the last time that you say Patrick was with Gino and
them, where is Patrick now, do you have any idea

in Virginia

do. you know. where in Virginia

no
a guess

no, he may be working in construction, but I'm not sure, it is
either construction or at a garage something like that

does the have any friends, relatives. or anyone that he dates.
around here

Patrick, no, Iidon't know of anybody that he would keep in
contact with

does he have a car
uh a Chevy, I believe it is a Chevy, that Gino had given him

did Gino have a bookkeeper or a Secretary of anything

replaced it
two or three years ago
uh, I-guess quite a few you know

let me ask you this or maybe you can give us some kind of an*!
answer, or a speculation anyway, since you have known Gino and
dated him and so forth, did he ever. indicate to you or did you
ever get a feeling that maybe there was somebody out ‘to get him

no, but uh, not so much Gino, but I knew Jason has had a couple
stunts with people in his neighborhood really and they had. gone
as. far as doing damage to cars and things like this, and I knew
Jason wasn't too well, you know slashed roof tops. and things
like this, I knew things like that, but as far as Gino. not I

Sully or something like that

person - a

M- that runs the place

D - right and it. is either David or.sully, I always got.'‘the two of
them mixed up because whenever Gino would talk about: them: there
and I couldn't keep them straight

M- Well, the reason we asked you if you had any inclination’ that
Gino was married is because’ he was :

D - .I’thought that he, he had been because, well, last year there
would be note on his desk saying, you know, he had gottenia
phone call from what was her name Carol )

E M -..uh huh
(

D -.. Carol, OK, and uh I didn't want to say anything you know about
it to Gino and he suspected that I suspected.-something and he
got real, very upset with me and we argued over it and it is
something I didn't want to know either way because I. just didn't,
I didn't want to no and Gino was real upset that night

S- . does that, knowing that he was married does that explain the
secret about it, about his business and everything or do you
still feel there is something that there is something ofa
mystery about it :

Di~ I still feel there

S -—. because you did suspect at the time

M- It isn't. that he was married, up until he died he had a wife

D--. uh huh

M~ OK, I just wanted to make that clear. This is a very mysterious

situation and we are trying to get to the bottom of it all .ana

ther is only one way of doing it and that is to talk to people

that were associated with him and like I say you have cleared up
( some questions for us, but if there is anything else that you

td

( M- can think of that would be of any help to us, to aid us
we would appreciate it. We would like to get to the bottom

of it

S - Because this has happened so quickly, it is hard for us..to
keep it in our mind, the garble . that Tinker
wrote down. Do you know the relationship there, Tinker

D- ‘no

S - Thereiis, there was something in addition to that, that

bothered you, that bothered you sister

D- -my sister, I.made mention to my boss, I don't know if you
talked to him or not

M- up at the restaurant

D -. yeah

M— yeah, we talked to him

D- but, I thought no it's best to keep that to myself, but I -
just ‘discussed it with my sister that I suspect that :

( M-. the one time that you went to New York, did you drive up

D. -. yeah we drove up in a rented car

M.- -in-a rented car from where? is

D- (I don't know, he picked me up, he picked me up in the car

M- why a rented car

D-. cause we were driving back in a 1940 Ford, Jason -had. bought :
it and it. was in Jason's garage

M—- how long ago was this?

D- this was last July, probably July

M - did he ever give you any explanation why he wasn't upset”
about having these three cars stolen from

D-- no, when he came out on Monday, he didn't even mefition’ it.

If it wasn't for somebody reading the paper and they came in’
they made a comment about it and I said you're kidding I wonder
why he didn't mention it, cause they came in on, Wédnesday and
he was in on Monday and the cars were stolen on Friday, Monday
and Wednesday and I said you're kidding he was just: in here

( and he didn't make mention of that to me and I was surprised he

Patrick and Gino came in on Monday

the cars were stolen that weekend, right
on Friday

the weekend prior to that

right, like the cars were stolen I believe on Friday, or
Thursday night weren't. they

Thursday night or Friday Night

OK, so Thursday or Friday they were stolen and then iit was
Sunday Patrick came in and Monday was when Gino and Patrick
and his brother and sister-in-law came in

so, did Patrick say anything about it

no.

you don't know where Patrick was staying

.Patrick had been in the hospital

which hospital was he in?
it must have been Northern Virginia
do you know what for?

I.can't remember what he told me, I asked Gino why he didn't.

-mention it to me and he said that when you asked how Patrick was,

I..said fine and he was fine, I said why didn't you tell me that
he was.in the hospital and Gino just made a Joke out ‘of it,
just because he was in the hospital he was still doing fine

and that is the way he passed it off. TI thought that was kind
of odd that Gino wouldn't tell me that Patrick was in the
hospital 7
