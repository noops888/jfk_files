Meeting with Lev_ Ado
of the sees x a

Usually discreet about his/freequent/meetings with Soviet:
visitors to Pranceg,Aronson told me today quite a number

of things on his latest encounters with them.So first he
said he spent an evening with Mrs Biasheva - a theatrical
critic from Leningrad.It is not the first time he met her,
so she told him “that for the moment in Leningrad is quite
a difficult oppressive atmosphere," "that the intellectuals
have more difficulties than ever" and once,talking about the
Tchecoslovaquia events Mrs B. told Aronson : "please do not
attribute to us the opinions expressed by Literatournaya
Gazeta - we the intellectuals of Leningrad were dead opposed
to it/the invasion/".

From other meetinge Aronson had lately with Soviet visitors,
namely one correspondent of "Izvestia",he got also impres—
sion of a particulary tight "zajim"/turn of the screw/which
ia felt presently in USSR,especially in both capitals.Then,
ho said,he got the impression that in USSR the intellectuals
find themselves more and more isolated from ordinary people Ff
which,under the action of new directives given by the autho-
rities becomes "hostile toward them".What are these new in-
structions given by the sov.Quthorities ? - "To spy each F
other and particulary the intellectuals/whom one cannot trust,
to fight foreign influence and manners,to be proud of thoir
great comm.party,to become true proletarians"."Apparently -
said Arongon - the party turn’ now toward the "base", toward
the lower layers of the population in order to find thero
support against the upper circles of the population who are
fed up with the régime".The new directives,Aronaon told,bore fj
fruit particulary in Moscow,where according to all his inter=
locutors population became lately hostile toward the forei-
genera and toward their own intelloctuals.Also peopie in the
street,in the shop became particulary rough and un»leasant.
Everyone uses “unprintable" expressions,which spread also
among the youth and in the agools. a

Aronson related also about thetvening he spent recently with
the First Secretary of the Bulgarian Embassy,who with his
wife were guests of Aronson in his restaurant."Contrary to
what I expected - said Aronson - it turned out that thio Bul-
gearian diplomat is definitelly anti-communist minded,and is
set against the Soviet Union". "It surprised me so more,asg
usually Bulgaria is considered the most friendly satellite E
of USSR and also because in the embassies of these countries,
the Firet Secretary is a particulary trusted and powerful 4
figure".I asked Mr.Aronson if this attitude of the Bulgarian

Secretary was not intended in some provocative purfose.So
Aronson replied that he did not think so : because the Bulga.
rian diplomat had no reaso to provoque him.Aronson noticed
also that the Bulgarian diplomat expressed admiration for
all of those theatricel authors which usually are particula-
ry hated by the communists. When Eronson asked him about the
theatre in Sophia and if they could produce there buch plays
as. they wanted, the bulg.diplomat replied that thank God in
that sphere they were in Bulgaria still fairly independent
and that so far Moscow did not put its noze into it.

v

My comments : Two points in the statements of Aronson call
attention : First about the "new instructions
and directives” given in USSR and Second :
about the anti-communist dispositions of the
First Secretary of the Bulgarian Embassy in
Paris./If the later is true,it could be quite

a “possibility"/.
