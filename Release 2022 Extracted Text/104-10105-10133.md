Page 10: Though

has received much publicity, there

appears no good veason to confirm the use oF thiS Eat feel

Agency. Unless we plan on officially opening

training facility, it should not be mentioned. (Check OTR)

Page 15: The "Phoenix Program" originated before William Colby

became DEPCORDS, COMUSMACV. Ambassador Komer started the program and

asked that Colby replace him as DEPCORDS so that there would be some

continuity in the effort to deal with criminal elements of the Viet

Cong infrastructure. It is unfair to subjectively state that the

"Operation Phoenix" was Colby's own albatross. Certainly Colby doesn't

believe this though he is receiving considerable flack from those who

would like others to believe that the whole program was one of assassina-.

tion of which Colby, as head of the CIA, was in charge.

Page 39: We're still putting audio devices in coke bottles -- all

these techniques and methods should not be discussed since we may very

well want to use them again in the future.
