ATLAS said that he has known the subject on a

fairly close basis

except for the last three years. He

said

he would not classify TOURINE a top echelon hoodlum and

explained this statement by saying that some years ago,

he (ATLAS) made a real killing with a bookmaker in NYC

and was owed a huge sum of money.

The bookmaker refused

to pay the PCI and so the difficulty was resolved at the

conference table. TOURINE did not have sufficient

PCI was represented by the subject.

In spite of this,

influence to obtain the money for the PCI. PCI added

that he is of the opinion that if TOURINE was regarded

as a top echelon hoodlum, he could have forced the bookmaker

to come up with the money..
