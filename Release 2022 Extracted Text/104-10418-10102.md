SECKEI

(

1. A reliable source reported in June 1971 that Willem

Leonard OLTMANS, a Dutch journalist who travels regularly to

the United States to

produce television commentaries, claimed

that he had been invited by the "National Security Council of

the United States" to discuss (presumably in Washington)

Southeast Asian affairs. The alleged invitation was extended

by "Mr. Kissinger's assistant named Mitchell."

2.

On 18 August 1971 the source reported that OLTMANS

had received a letter from "Mr. Holdridge, 'Chief of Staff

for Asia and assistant to Mr. Kissinger'" as a result of which

OLTMANS expects to meet with Mr. Holdridge in Washington on

6 or ? September 1971. It is assumed that "Mr. Holdridge" is

identical

with Mr. John M. Holdridge, Chief, Asia on the White

House Staff.

3. For your information we have attached background

information on OLTMANS who we believe should be considered an

unpredictable if not unscrupulous individual who might well

exploit his connection with the White House to his own personal

advantage without respect to the confidence expressed in him.

4. We would appreciate an indication of the background

between Mr. Holdridge's correspondence with OLTMANS.

NAME: Willem Leonard OL TMANS

DPOB: 10 June 1925 in Huizen, The Netherlands

EDUCATION: Studied at Yale in 1950 but was expelled for

unstated misbehavior.

a. Worked briefly as correspondent for UP and for Dutch

paper De Telegraaf but dismissed by both for unstated cause.

b. An FBI report of 1960 states that he calls himself

anti-Communist but expresses the views "of a great admirer of

Communism."

c. In 1961 a fairly reliable source listed him as a UN

correspondent then planning an unsponsored trip to East Germany,

Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary. Dutch correspondents

said that they had yet to see a story written by him. When he

applied for membership in the UN correspondents association, he

was unable to produce

a single clipping in support of the

application. He travels extensively. He has excellent contacts

in all Communist countries including Cuba.

d. The Haagse Post of 15 April 1961, with a nationwide

readership, characterized OLTMANS as an intimate friend of the

then President of Indonesia, Sukarno, and as having tried for

five years to arrange contacts for Sukarno in Holland.

e.

An FBI report of 24 November 1961 restates the

above and adds that he had been separated or divorced from his

American wife 18 months earlier because "he is not a man." He

was living with a male at the time of the report.

f. An FBI report of J. February 1962 includes an interview

with

the ex-wife Frieda Bieling (she had remarried). She said

that her ex-husband and President Sukarno were close friends and

that he wrote to Sukarno at least once

a week throughout their

marriage.

Around 1957 she and OLTMANS lived at the Paramount

Hotel, New York, for a time. The Indonesian government paid their

bill, which was more than $300. She met Sukarno through her

husband in May 1959 in Copenhagen. Her father, she said, learned

that OLTMANS had a police record for molesting young boys in

Amsterdam.

She said that OLTMANS is at least intellectually a

Communist and believes Communism to be the economic system of

the future.

g. A reliable source reported in 1966 that OLTMANS wrote

pro-Lumumba articles in 1960, visited Cuba in 1962 and perhaps

1963, developed friendly relations with Chicoms at The Hague and

may have visited China in 1964. In August 1966 he applied for a

Chicom visa at The Hague.

i. An FBI report of 12 May 1967 says that OLIMANS claimed

to have written for Ramparts an article about CIA in Indonesia.

No such article has been found.
