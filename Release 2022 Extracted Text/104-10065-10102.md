FOR STATION'S BACKGROUND INFO, FOLLOWING IS SUMMARY OF

PHOTO

COVERAGE OF CUBAN AND SOVIET EMBASSIES PLUS TELTAP INFO

REQUESTED REFS:

CUBAN EMBASSY: PROJECT LIONION WAS ACTIVE FROM 1962}

UNTIL SEPTEMBER 1972) AND PROVIDED PHOTO COVERAGE OF THE CUBAN

INSTALLATION TO THE EMBASSY.

THE SITE WAS LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 80 YARDS FROM

THE ENTRANCE

FROM 1962) UNTIL DECEMBER 1963 THE

EQUIPMENT USED WAS A SPOTTING SCOPE AND A CAMERA, IN DECEMBER 1963 A

PULSE CAMERA WAS INSTALLED BECAUSE OF LACK OF COVERAGE OF THE

CONSULATE DOOR.

THE PULSE CAMERA WAS REMOVED IN OCTOBER 1969.

SOVIET EMBASSY:

PROJECT LIEMPTY CONCERNED PRIMARILY

WITH PHOTOGRAPHIC COVERAGE OF THE SOVIET INSTALLATION.

ACTIVE FROM

APPROXIMATELY MID- 1955) THROUGH 30 JUNE 1972. AT THE TIME OF ITS

TERMINATION

IT SUPPORTED TWO OF THE THREE DRIGINAL BASEHOUSES

WHICH WERE:

(1) LICALLA (ACTIVIATED IN 1957) TO PROVIDE PHOTO

COVERAGE OF REAR (GARDEN, PARKING LOT AREAD OF THE SOVIET EMBASSY.

TERMINATED 30 JUNE 19720)

(2) LILYRIC CACTIVIATED IN 1956) TO PROVIDE PHOTO

COVERAGE OF THE SOVIET EMBASSY'S FRONT ENTRANCE, TERMINATED

30 JUNE 1972.)

(3) LIMITED CACTIVIATED IN 1955 TO PROVIDE PHOTO

COVERAGE OF THE SOVIET EMBASSY'S FRONT ENTRANCE, TERMINATED

31 MAY 1968.)

(FYI:N SEPTEMBER 1964 MEXICO CITY STATION WAS INFORMED THAT ONE

OF SEVERAL PHOTOGRAPHS, WHICH HAD BEEN SUPPLIED TO THE WARREN

COMMISSION IN NOVEMBER

1963, WOULD BE PUBLISHED IN THE

COMMISSION'S REPORT.

BECAUSE OF THE POTENTIAL SECURITY

REPERCUSSIONS WHICH

COULD STEM FROM PUBLIC RELEASE OF THE

PHOTOGRAPH, THE OPERATIONS OF ALL THREE BASEHOUSES ABOVE WERE

SUSPENDED IN SEP 1964.

WHEN THE STATION DETERMINED THAT SAID

PHOTOGRAPH WAS SOURCED TO LIMITED, THE STATION REACTIVATED THE

LILYRIC AND LICALLA BASEHOUSES ON A PHASED BASIS IN OCTOBER 1964.

LIMITED WAS MOVED TEMPORARILY TO AN APARTMENT (NOT FURTHER

IDENTIFIED, IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY OF THE SOVIET EMBASSY AND

RESUMED ITS ACTIVITIES IN EARLY JANUARY 1965.

LATER IN 1965

THE ORIGINAL BUILDING THAT HOUSED LIMITED WAS RAZED AND A NEW

STRUCTURE WAS BUILT ON THE SAME SITE. LILYRIC OPERATION WAS MOVED

INTO THE NEW BUILDING AND THE LIMITED OPERATION WAS MOVED INTO

THE BUILDING WHICH LILYRIC HAD-FORMERLY OCCUPIED.=

NOINT TELTAP ACTIVITY, AND MAD THE CAPACITY TO MONITOR THIRTY

TELEPHONE LINES.

THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD FROM JULY 1963 UNTIL

APRIL 1964, THERE WAS LIENVOY COVERAGE ON FIVE SOVIET EMBASSY

THESE LINES WERE: 15-60-55 (CHANCERY) 15-61-55

(CHANCERY),

15-69-81 (MILITARY ATTACHE), 16-61-07 (COMMERCIAL OFFICE), AND

15-12-64 (FILM REPRESENTATIVE).

IN JULY 1963 LIENVOY COVERAGE WAS MAINTAINED ON FIVE

LINES CONNECTED WITH THE CUBAN EMBASSY, THESE LINES, NOT FURTHER

IDENTIFIED, WERE AS FOLLOWS: 14-42-37- 14-92-141 25007=95,

25-09-14 AND 14-13-26.

THE

STATION REPORTED IN EARLY OCTOBER 1963

THAT LIENVOY COVERAGE

HAD BEEN SUSPENDED ON 23 SEPTEMBER 1963 ON

TWO CUBAN EMBASSY LINES: 14-92-14 AND 25-07-95.

COVERAGE ON

14-92-14 WAS SUSPENDED BECAUSE IT WAS OUT OF ORDER, AND THE CUBANS

HAD NOT SUCCEEDED IN GETTING THE TELEPHONE COMPANY TO REPAIR IT.

25-07-95 WAS SUSPENDED BECAUSE IT WAS LOCATED IN AN APARTMENT

WHICH HAD BEEN VACATED BY A CUBAN OFFICIAL AND THE CUBANS HAD NOT

YET SUCCEEDED IN HAVING IT TRANSFERRED TO THE CUBAN EMBASSY.

IT

IS BECAUSE OF THE SUSPENSION OF COVERAGE OF THESE TWO LINES THAT

LIENVOY WAS ONLY PROVIDING COVERAGE ON THREE CUBAN EMBASSY LINES

AT THE TIME OF OSWALD'S VISIT TO THE CUBAN EMBASSY.

SOMETIME

PRIOR TO APRIL 1964 LIENVOY COVERAGE WAS REACTIVATED ON THESE

TWO LINES (PRESUMABLY ONCE 14092-14 HAD BEEN REPAIRED AND

25-07-95 HAD BEEN TRANSFERRED TO THE EMBASSY, BUT THE EXACT DATE

OF THE RESUMPTION OF COVERAGE DOES NOT APPEAR IN THE RECORD.

RE PARA 4 OF REF B, WE COULD FIND NO RECORD OF A

UNILATERAL TELTAP OPERATION DIRECTED AGAINST EITHER THE SOVIET

OR CUBAN EMBASSY DURING THE TIME FRAME •

LIFEAT DID, HOWEVER,

PROVIDE COVERAGE OF RESIDENCES OF SELECTED CUBAN AND SOVIET

OFFICIALS.
