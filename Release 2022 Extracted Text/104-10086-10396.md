1. Much has been written about the delay (by, the Mexico
Station) insending the first cable requesting traces on the
name Lee OSWALD. It was discussed in Dave Phillips book as a
case of laziness on the part of the Soviet case officer (which
in wy view was unjust and unnecessary and indicates that Dave

SUBJECT: Review of Mexico City Station Files
-at the Warrenton Record's Center

1. On 2 May 1977 Chris Hopkins and Annie Goodpasture
visited the Warrenton} Record's Center to review old Mexico
City files in search of additional photographs of the
: “unidentified man". We were unable to locate any such

‘ photographs. It appears that earlier photographs may have
been destroyed in a purge of Mexico City Station files and
that the folders for the destroyed material were re-used to
forward more recent photographic material to Headquarters
for retention. Following are the Job numbers of boxes reviewed
and pertinent notations re re-use of the old folders:

i ae Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Embassies (1963)

yp Gieaomne REPRODUCTION PRONIBITED

“sl From the time the Mexico Station was opened| in April 1947; until

the arrival of Mr. Win Scott as Chief of Station \in 195 | the Station had

developed a support apparatus to exploit leads from the Soviet Embassy in

Mexico City.. This umbrella type project (LIPSTICK) consisted of multiline
phone taps, three photographic sites, a mobile surveillance team and a
mail intercept operation.
Telephone taps (LIFEAT) were placed by {an employee of the local]
{telephone conpany who was} handled by a Station ce officer. The number
of lines tapped was limited only by the availability of a listening post
nearby and the availability of langauge (English, Spanish, Soviet, Polish,
, Czech, etc.) transcribers. Generally, these were Mexican or Mexican-
American recruited agents.
Three photographic sites were handled by a Station case officer
: assisted by technicians on TDY from Headquarters who advised the Station
on the best types of cameras, films, and concealment devices. These
operations had sub-crypts under project LIPSTICK (namely: LIMITED, LILYRIC
and LICALLA). LIMITED was a fixed site directly opposite the Soviet Em-
bassy (across the street) which had both a vehicle and a pedestrian en-

trance. The gate to the Soviet Embassy was on the northwest corner of the

ir a language other than Spanish or English were taken to another location

for translation and typing. Mr. Boris Tarasoff did the Russian transla-
tions but because of the volume of Russian conversations, the translations
usuaTly ran about a week behind the date ‘of the conversation.
As soon as the Station learned that an Anerican identifying him-
". self as-Lee Oswald phoned the Soviet Embassy,- Miss Ann Goodpasture of the
Station started screening all photographs. However, here again, there
was a backlog because the photographs were picked up three times a week
but those picked up were usually for dates a few days before since the
technician who was processing the film, did so on a night-time basis.
Further, photographs were not made initially until a complete roll of
film was used. Later this was changed and the operator cleared the canera
at the, end of each day regardless of amount of unused film remaining.
The instructions were to cover the entire work day (office hours) and to
Photograph all Soviets, their families, all foreigners, -and cars with
[foretsh license plates. Human error did occur but generally the. agents
were’ conscientious. The Cuban Embassy coverage had more sophisticated

equipment using a pulse camera which frequently developed mechanical dif--

Tarasoff for translation because the caller was trying to speak in Russian.
There was some delay because Station personnel waited to compare the
photographs with the typed transcript. All transcripts were made in
either| Spantsh or English since the Chief of Station could read only

these ben Tanguages and because he personally screened the transcripts

for operational leads.

‘At 1626 hours, A Soviet calls from the Soviet Enbassy Chancery

DURAN if the american has been there.

DURAN: Yes, he is still here.

SOVIET: According to the letters that he showed them from the (Soviet)
Consulate in Washington, he wants’ to go to the USSR to stay
a long time with his wife who is Russian, but also the
answer had not been received (by him) regarding his problem.

without prior approval from the USSR, have to request

DURAN: ..Wil B1so, because the problem with him (the American)
is that he doesn't know anyone in Cuba and in that case it
is very difficult to give him a visa, because he was
thinking of processing his visa, because he knew it was
going to take a long time waiting for the Russian visa in
Cuba, and then go on to the USSR.

SOVIET: ..that the thing is that if his (the Anerican) wife were

Item 74, page 2

An unidentified man (speaking Spanish) calls the Soviet Enbassy
Consulate at 1037 hours and asks for the Consul. He is told that
the Consul is not there. The unidentified man asked what is needed
to get visas to go to Odessa. He is told to call back at 1130 hours.

Item 137, page 2

‘At 1235 hours d man named ALATRISTE (not a Soviet) from inside the
Soviet Enbassy Consulate calls out to number 45-37-72 ‘(Colonial
America, probably a pension or hotel but number not listed in the
telephone directory) and speaks with a man named SAN ROMAN.
ALATRISTE says that he is in the Russian Enbassy and they need to
know what day the boat "KALONIA" will arrive ane ssa, that the
Soviets will also need copies of the pass st. nay fest...

Just after 1600 hours, the Soviet Consulate received a call from the
Cuban Consulate (Sylvia DURAN) who said she had there a U.S. citizen
who had requested a transit visa to Cuba because he is going to the
USSR. DURAN wants to know with whom he spoke at the Soviet Embassy
because she’ sent him over to them telling him that if the Soviets
approved the visa then the Cubans would give him one without anything
more, advising the (Department of) Immigration in Cuba. She wants
to know with whom he spoke because he says that he doesn't know
either with what person and who told him that certainly there would
be no problem.’ The Soviet asks DURAN to wait a minute. After a
short wait DURAN explains the same thing to another Soviet. This
Soviet tells her to leave her telephone (number) and her.name and
‘someone will-return the call. DURAN gives her name and telephone
mumber 11-28-47 then says as a personal thing, she has moved and

has not advised them of a change of address so will not receive their
Bulletin and can give it to them now. The Soviet asks her to call
KOUKHARENKO in order to change that address and asks for the name

of the (Cuban) Qultural Attache. DURAN says it is Teresa PROENZA
whose number is 14-13-26. The Soviet thanks her. OC OLTS
