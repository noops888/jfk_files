” suBgecT: Board Meeting of December

The Board convened at 9:(0 a.m, on December 2'
present were Dr, Killian, Chairman, Board members Langer, Murphy,
Gray, Doolittle, Pace and Cliiford and Messrs, Coyne and Ash.

Dr. Killian suggested thet Board members read the draft
report ww fi bad been furnished to the Board on the preceding
day by My, MeCone, the Directcr of Cen q lligence, setting
forth the results of the all-source 9 h the Board nad
requested concerning U. S, intelligence community activitie with
respect to the Soviet military buildup in Cuba during the 6-months
preceding October 22, 1962, ‘Tie Chairman asked that Board members
make note of any comments and questions they might sh to raise
for discussion during this twc-day meeting. Dr, Killian said that
he wag not sure the DCI's repcrt had the approval of the intelli-
genee community at this point, for he understood that Mr. MeCone
was at that moment reviewing the draft repott in Seattle, and it
was possible that some of the conclusions and factual details
might not have yet received final approval by e agencies whi
contributed to the preparatior of the report (CIA, DIA, State a
NSA). Accordingly, the Chairman noted the importance of the
Giscussions which the Board would have on the following day witn
heads of the intelligence agencies. The Chairman also thought
that the Board should ajm for the preparation of a Board report
to the President at the close of this 2-day meeting.

Dr. Killian said that he had very recently talked to Mr,
McGeorge Bundy who hopes that the Board will take the time it needs
to produce a solid report on the handling given by U. 5S, intelli-
gence agencies to the Soviet military buildup in Cuba, Mr. Bundy
assured that the President will understand that the Board is going
into the subject deeply and otjectively. About, 10 dzys ago, the
Chairman related, he had received a telephone call from Mr, Bundy
who said that he had seen an early draft of the DCI's report (from
a confidential source) and was concerned because the report did not
get to the’ basic issues, and Mr, Bundy expressed an intention to
tail to Mr. Mcvone about this, Dr. Killian stated that he had an
appointment to see Mr, Bundy later in the morning at which time he
vould ask Mr, Bundy to meet with the Board during the course of
this meeting. . . 5 i

Another matter mentioned by, Mr, Bundy was his belie? that
the morale of the intelligence, community as a vinole stands to
suffer in the avsence, of a carefully done review and report
which is being expected.from the Board,

ii regard to the interim veport which the Board has under. °

(At the conclusion of the.Ciaimman's account of his discussion
with We, Bundy, the Board recess. 2d for luneh,. :

“the Board was briefed on the world situation by °

, senior, intelligence officer in CIA's Office of,
Current Intelligence (Mr, Ray ‘Cline, Deputy DCI/Intelligence was .
on vacation leave and not availasie to be present at this Board ~
meeting). lx, Lawlor explained. chat his own responsi ilities in-
cluded tne handling of current iitelligence matters, the’ selection
and write-up of current intelligonce items (e.g., in the CIB’and in ae
memoranda for the White House),: and the preparation of ‘internal in-..
telligence nutes for use at the SIA working level. Mr, Lawlor
pointed out that his duties were in the areas of analysis ane.
production, not the collection, of intelligence. His briefing of
the Board included,-the following subject matters: oo

-... interrogations und ay

The Chairman asked! the {ICI whether’ the MONGOOSE-activit;
presented any particular™intelligence, problem inthe’ Cuba: «
situation. Mr. McCone:said‘hat.1t had not. He said-that
in the MONGOOSE activity! the’ Special’ Group and the Attorney
General had given a-great d ‘ offconsideration to the need.
for intelligence collection ith: respect to Cuba, but’ the
intelligence needed/was primirilysfor™ overt action rathe
than other purposes. . Nevertheless, the MONGOOSE activity’
contributed to the over-all :ntelligence collection effort
on Cuba. fr. NcCone recalled that there was a hiatus in the‘
collection of intelligence.on-Cuba, after the Bay of Pigs -in- +
vasion,-and when he-cook: off:.ce in. November 1961 Mr. MeCone
was surprised to learn*that*no “interrogation of Cuban refugees
was aking place: hereafte:, following discussions with

. the President and the /Attorne y,General they got the refugee
Mr. Murphy wondered why there had been a let-down in -:
intelligence gatnering after the Bay of Pigs incident, eat
MeCone said that this took p!.ace before his e, but he
assumed that the reasons had to do with discouragement and .
other psychological fectors. In response to Dr. Killian's
question as to whether another intelligence let-down was in
store in the wake of the Cubs crisis,"Mr. McCone said that
there was in fact a great danger of such a development follor
what some officials consider was an "Intelligence victory"
for the United States. Mr.“llceCone, noting that the Soviet
SA-2's remain in Cuba,'said he had brought this up forceful]:
a ek ago at an NSC Executive Committee meeting, and-the.
President had agreed to get iord to the USSR that any inte
ference with our aerial recotrnaissance of Cuba would be
considered as being most grave -- and Messrs, .MeCloy: and
Stevenson have passed this.word. to Kuznetsov. fir. McCone
added that while’ low-level: rcconnaissance ‘flights..have been

the DCI had in mind: would “inely de(1)%penetration' ofthe: Castros

Mr, Pace asked whether Mr,’ McCone would favor the use of
Guantanamo Naval Base as a base “for launching intelligence .and
related operations against Cubic. Mr. -McCone said that he would

- not be in favor of this because if we were caught using Guantanamo
for intelligence operations ‘Cas tro would obtain UN and other support,
for Cuba's demands for U,.S. evacuation of the Naval Base, ~ :

ae Answering General: Doolittl« 's question, the DCI stated that’
<U-2 overflights of Cuba were: g¢ ing: at the rate of two a day, re--

"sulting in coverage of: all: tarpets once a week and in coverage of:
some important targets'(e.g., iiarbors) more often. Mr. licCone said
that COMOR and USIB. lis he 3 gets and that he then est blis!

e Going back to the subject:f. Guantanamo, Mr, .Pace asked whether,
the DCI had mate a study of the expected intelligence return’ that ii
would ve obtained if-intelligence operations were’ conducted’ from.

Mr,’ MeCone explained”. shat in the MONGOOSE Gri
was originally conceived ‘that Piase I would be one of gatherin
intelligence on the possibiliti2s for the organization and supply
_ of resistance groups within Cuba,‘ but’ this effort was, "only fairly
successful" because: Castro has. some 100,000’ informers’ in place ‘in
Cuba and exercises internal*sec arity controls through a system: of:
ration cards, and therefore, C14 did not get as many teams’ into“
Cuba as had been hoped, On Augast 10, -Phase II was reached wit!
_, MONGOOSE planning for. (a) violeit actions (b) a relatively high
- level of actions, or-"B-PLUS",“and lesser actions, or "B MINUS".
Mr, McCone said that he~had not been prepared to endorse proposed
"B' PLUS" actions in the absence of plans for military backing, ~
because of his own speculation that the U.S. would be faced with
MRBMs in Cuba, In any case,” the MONGOOSE effort became diverted
by considerations f Sovis ‘activities in Cuba, Mr. McCone stated,

In ansyer to a question’ fron Mr, Murphy ‘as to who chairs’ the
MONGOOSE Group at this time, Mr. McCone said that he did not know
whether Mr. Bundy or the Attorney, General was now serving as
Chairman, vane ane ‘

With reference to the abserce of photographic evidence of Soviet

offensive missile deployment p2 ior to October 14 photography, Mr.
McCone said that if one looks <t photography of Cuba obtained on
September 5 it is possible spot evidence of activity at the San
Cristobal MRBM site, but this <«ctivity could have been that of
agricultural workers and the ev idence did not then point to missile
activity. Dr. Killian noted tie Board's concern that Soviet cam- ~
ouflage operations may be deceiving us. Mr, MeCone expressed his
own great concern that the So ts are deceiving us by camouflage
methods, Acknowledging that or intelligence estimates leave a
certain margin for error, Mr. licCone noted that it is nevertheless
impossiole for us to say that ve know all that is going on in the
USSR with respect to missile activity, In response to Dr, Killian's
comment that public discussion: ,seem.to indicate that U. S. missile
capabilities are superior.to,.tl.ose of. the USSR, the DCI considered
that any such conclusion’ is‘erroneous and dangerous and could lead
to a complacency which.might well result in curtailment ofthe U, S
missile program. by an economy-riinded Congress.» Mr. MeCone,-added #}
