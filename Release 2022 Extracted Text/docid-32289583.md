On April 18, 1967,

MM T-13 advised

JEK Law, 11(a)

On April 18, 1967, MM I-I advised as follows:

GARCIA VIDAL advised the source that he had been

talking with ALBERTO ARDURA recently. ARDURA told him that

everything was going well and that possibly they would join

forces in their bolita operation in a limited way. The

source believed that VIDAL meant "layoff" operation.

GARCIA VIDAL mentioned that he was quite upset

over the fact that the FBI had been surveilling and

interviewing his son EVARISTICO in connection with a Revolution-

ary plot to bomb some embassy in Canada. He mentioned that he

had no problems in his bolita operation since he was well

protected from local police action.

GARCIA mentioned that he had cemented relations*

with friends in New York in order to obtain the lottery

tickets for the New York lottery, which begins in June,

1967. GARCIA VIDAL asked the source to join him and

work

for him in the New York lottery ticket operation.

GARCIA told the source that he closes his "bolita

bank'' at midnight every Tuesday and Friday. The Tuesday

closing is connected with bolita writing for the drawing:

of the "Puèrto Rican."

The Friday night closing is connected

with the Saturday night drawing of the "Cuba" bolita. He

told the source that he does not permit the bolita writer

to make bets after midnight on these days although he himself,

since he is the boss, would take a bet after midnight if it

were from a

friend of his.

When GARCIA VIDAL came to the United States

from Cuba, he had previously sent out approximately

$500,000 to a close associate in Miami, MIGUEL PEREZ

PITA.

PEREZ PITA had a safe deposit box in the First

National Bank of Miami for EVARISTO. PEREZ PITA still

has the confidence of EVARISTO and recommends people to

GARCIA for loans. If PEREZ PITA recommends a man, GARCIA

will loan the money.

EVARISTO used to go to the First National Bank

on a daily basis and could be seen any day between 11:00

and 12 noon. He used to have a special bank officer, an

American, whom he contacted to handle his business personally.

This man

has changed jobs and is now new business manager

of a mercantile bank located on 57th Avenue and Southwest

9th Street..

With this man at the other bank, source feels

that EVARISTO has changed his operation to this bank.

Source has known TRAFFICANTE personally for

years.

He has been in personal contact during the past

four years on numerous occasions asking for loans and

advice.

Each time he would contact TRAFFICANTE, he would

do so through MACHO GENER who would arrange the

meeting.

GENER was formerly a representative in Cuba and was employed

by TRAFFICANTE at $100 a week to take any calls, make

appointments and generally be the "arranger."

GENER nO

longer has this position and now if source wants to contact

TRAFFICANTE, he must do so through GARCIA VIDAL.

RAUL, GONZALEZ JEREZ, formerly of the Club Intimo,,

was very close to SANTO in Cuba and presumably is a close

friend. He is not connected to the bolita activities in Miami.

SANTO once mentioned to source that EVARISTO had

given him $20,000 that he needed.

, Source has met with SANTO after the appointments

made by GENER at the Doral Beach Hotel, Sonny's Restaurant

in Miami Beach on several occasions and also several/ cines

at the Mayflower Restaurant on Norchwest 36ch Street and

• Miami Avenue.

that SANTO had made a lot of money in the exporting of

TV and small appliances

From Tampa.

from Tampa, has recently moved into Key West and set up a

gambling operation there.
