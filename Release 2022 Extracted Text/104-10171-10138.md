THAT HE IS ENQUIN OF A REALIST THAT ME WOULD NOT BE UNDULY UPSET JY THE

LOULD BE MADE IN THE COMPANY OF OTHER CHURCH PEOPLE.

SO HE WOULD LIVE TO MAXE AN AFPOINTHENT TO TALK

Dear Mr. Sternberg:

As you might surmise, your organization is well

known to the Agency. Following the receipt of your

letter of 31 March 1976, a more definitive scarch for

information pertaining to your request was conducted.

No information was located which would indicate that

CIA has ever

provided funds to the IRC either directly

or indirectly. I trust this letter will allay any

apprehensions your organization has had in this

matter.

If I. can be of further assistance, do not

hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,

George Bush
