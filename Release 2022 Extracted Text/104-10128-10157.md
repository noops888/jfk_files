Libero Meciardelli (Correct)

SUBJECT: US Repatriate, Libero Rickisrdel (Rikkiardel), Needham
Heights 94, Massachusetts.

REF t Paragraph three, our Memo, dated 31 Jul 61, forwarded under
Case - 35780. {copy attached )

1. After all this time, ve sinelly {although inadvertently)
obtained the name of the came! referred to in the above reference;
the subject of this memo.

2. Our source {pr.- -Denny D. Pi eal Corporation,
recently received a letter from Pro: ae ciayayffteroere G. Ivakhnenko 6

that subject had returned to the Pier echt Sah edd of oe
letter, bad English and all: .
"It seems to me I speak vorser English than some times ago -
especially after my neighbor Libero Rickierdel (Rikkiardel)
[the typing was hard to decipher because of strike-overs on

the second and third letters] went home for Needham Heits

94, Massachusetts. It was good praxis for me to speak with
him. He is complicated man having good and bad sides, Shortly
to tell, he is rather egolstic man who did not think about
Communism or capitalism. Having the strong complications

in his family, he dos not love his wife but wanted the such
divorce when the children remain with his mother but not with
the wife, because he considers her as mentally weak. He hoped
to find the answer in another system. Here he received

rather good apartment and salary - 150 rubles per month, but
became homesick. Even the beautiful nature of Kiev seemed

to him gray and bore [vare?]. With great difficulties,

mainly from the USA side, hi got permission to return to

home. There wait for him two big problems: first - to

solve the problem with wife and children. ‘he old fashioned
society of Needham will be against him. Second - the State
Department cannot ‘forgive’ him his cosmopolitical behavior.

“An& poor Norma [undoubfedly Libero's wife] has no mec to
live and cannot find the job in USA, even as the baby sitting
woman. She is very tired and almost 111. Her only sister
tells her the price of the meal which she eats. Libero is
rather stingy, as many people snbrosd, except you, of course!
Her situation is very tregic.” 5

3. Earlier in the letter, Alexis asked [Piahayny Ito write a welcoming

letter and maybe later visit with him. In this re Alexis said, “I
would like to know his destiny after return home.“ And later, he said,

“Do not ask a word about Norma from Libero, it makes him fierce. He really or

does not love her, Nevertheless I would like to know the future of this
family and maybe help them in any way - for instance I can try to send
the medicine which Norma likes and. cannot find in the USA.”

. 4, Perhaps the Breda would like’to have a next door neighbor's
contribution re a recent repatriate. If s0, please do not divulge our we
source's name.

: 5. Too, Libero might be an excellent source of bio data on
: Ivakhnenko, having lived next door to him for a few years. With a
slight amount of pressure, he would probably be a most willing source.

6. With reference to(Dr. Pidhayny] writing to and visiting this
individual, we advised him to hold off until such time as we were
notified differently. Therefore, would you please check with the
appropriate Bureau staff to determine the extent of their interest and
whether or not our source would be cleared to write to and/or visit
him?

7. Please advise.
