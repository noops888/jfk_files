“++ tively small numbér of personalities indexed-are of- -sufficient interest to justify = - e

with organizations or activities of operational: interest. OI codes cover intelli-
gence and security service affiliation, whether staff or agent, or known or
suspect, as well as activities of DDO interest. There are two categories of OI
codes for use by components:

(1) general OI codes (Attachment 4)

(2) des assigned to a specific component for intelligence services
or other specific organizations. .

A component may request an OI code be established by submitting a mem-
orandum to the DDO/RMO through the component Records Management
Officer.

A201 personality rhay be-assigned two OI codes, An OI code may be assigned
when the 201 Personality File Action Request (Form. 831) is initiated (see
