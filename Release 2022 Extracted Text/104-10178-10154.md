FROM —; Interrogation Research Division

SUBJECT : AMCLEVE/15_-- IDEN A IRD @72501

201-300985

BACKGROUND: - a

raar-old PBRUMEN male who has been of continuing
since Initial contact with JMWAVE and more recently
with the Caracas Station as a penetraticn of the IDEN B organization.

PURPOSE/PROCEDURE:

Subject was SGSWIRLed at the zequest of the Caracas Station because
of several issues which tended to question Subjects bona fides, possible
affiliation with PBRUMEN intelligence through relatives, unreported associ-
ation’ with gangster elements, thefts from WOFIRM, plus other iteme specified
in questions Meted below. The interview was conducted in the home of

~Csear C. KALBING ia both English aad Spanish. (Subject's English is quite

good, however, curing actual testing Spanish was used to avoid ambiguity or
misunderstanding of the question content.) KALBING did the tranelating.

RESULTS:

Subject remains sensitive to one question which ts related to hia past
dealings with IDEN C but in fairnees to Subject this sensitivity is believed
geserxated by genuine uncertainity over the amount of items which he had
been instrumental in getting for IDEN C. Sensitivity initially recorded in
other areas was resclved through post-test discussion and responses to all
other question: regarded as substantially truthful. Subject was most
cooperative and candid throughout the entire interview.

DETAILS:

Because of the numerous issues which were believed in need of clarifi-

cation, a three phase test was structured prior to the interview and rehearsed

Discussions, ae noted,
ked of Subject and

with Subject completely before any tosting took plac
wero in both English and Spanish. Specific cuestion:
answers given by him are as follows:

SECRET
CS-copy ee = 290987



Page 2
IRD #72501

IDEN A? Answer: No, except
for nicknames and aliases used with WOFIRM.

Have you ever travelled to Washington, D. C.% Answer: Yes.
Once severel yearo ago.

_ Haye, you ever, been to the Soviet Union? Answer: No.

_Are'apy of your relatives members of the Communtot Party?
After some discussion Subject felt it probable that they were.
: Those specifically mentioned were his two brothers IDEN D
vf asd IDEN:E and aloo possibly a sister named IDEN F who is
also in PBRUMEN and married to a Captain in the Militia,
When the questicn was prefacod with the words: “Ie it your
* belief that any of your relatives are members," Subject's
answer was always yes. He based this belief on the fact that
both brothers hold highly reaponsible positions in key industries
in PBRUMEN and hence must be members. He also noted that
prior-to bia leaving PBRUMEN, he (Subject) and his two brothers
had many discussions about politics and their views differed
from Subject’s. As for his brother IDEN E, Subject regarded
" bim ae the “brain” in the family and originally a very religious
person who attended Catholic services dally, He later evinced
distrust for the clergy in PBRUMEN and Llamed them for the
downfall of the church, When Castro made his move, IDEN E
was in completé sympsthy with him and remained with him
deopite his appsrent conversice to Communism, although
IDEN E never acknowledged that he had been a Communist and
would usually retort with a comment that be (IDEN E) was a
“humanist, " d

Are any of your relatives working for PBRUMEN Intelligence?
His answer waa that he felt that at least one of them was accord-
ing to what KALBING Inferred during his discussion with Subject
the day before the SCSWIRL test. This was bie brother IDEN D,
but he.also wondered about his brother IDEN E who might also be

, with PBRUMEN Intelligence because according to what his mother

mentioned in a letter come time ago, IDEN E had been in the
USSR receiving traiuing of-some sort, Thio traloing lacted for
a full year and cecurred in 1962 to the best of Subject's memory,
Subject was reascnably sure of thio date because of the "Atlesile
crisis" and President Kennedy's death which occurred later.

IRD ¢72501

your relatives (brothers) are working fur PBRUMEN intelli-

. After thia discussion the questicn read: "Ic it probably that
gence? Anower: Yea."

ee Did you know your brother (IDEN D) was working with IDEN G

any before we told you? Answer: No. But again had some

suspleténs.

B sides the letters we asked you to ond to your brothers ave
ted with anyone in PBRUMEN? Answer: Yes.
t 7 i @ year and with an aunt
named IDEN H which was the person to whom he actually
addressed the letter to his brother which WOFIRM asked him
to write, This letter incidentally was posted in 1967 (a fow
i months before coming to Caracas) and not 1966 ae noted in
Station files. Since arrival in Caracas, Subject has written
his mother coly once and had the letter posted from Miami to
. prevent anyone knowing hie exact whereabouts. (In addition
to these contacts, Subject has sent one telegram to his mother
soon after the IDEN I just to let her know he was alright.) It
was about this time that IDEN E wrote to him and criticized

i his participation in IDEN L.

’ Have you seen either of your brothere since 1961? Subject answered
no, Last saw IDEN E at the airport in the distance but there
were employees from IDEN E's place of employment present
and IDEN E was apparently reluctant to go near the plane. Siace
1961 Subject has not seen any member of his family and as time
goes on dues not miss them as much. The persone he claims to
have been clo: it to were his aunt and grandmother and addresses
comments to them personally when he does write to hin mother,
When further discussing bis brothers on this question, Subject’
was somewhat complimentary despite their differing political
views and generally considered them ac hard-working energetic
types with good school records,

Do you have a secret means of contacting anyone in PBRUMEN?
Claiins he knowe of frienda who have used telegrarna to transmit
coded messages but he has never engaged in such activity. These
mesoages were directed against the PBRUMEN. :

> Have you ever been in Communist China? Answer: No.

Have you over workod for the intelligence service of any country
besides IDEN J and LNIARP? Answer: No.

Have you ever received intelligence training in PBRUMEN?
-Anowert No.

Have you over been.a member of any Commeaist guerrilla group?
“ Answer: No. Later explained sensitivity to the question as
emanating from crrrent work with two former Communist
‘guerrillas named IDEN K and IDEN L beth cf whom are now

with IDEN B. .

Have you told anyone in PBRUMEN that you are working with
WOFIRM? Answer: No. This question led to a discussion
of broadcaste from PBRUMEN which identified Subject as a
member of WOFIRM, - These broadcasts occurred in Octcber
1967 according to Subjéct andthe man fingering him was
IDEN M. The latter was not officially in Subject's WOFIRM
grcup before his capture in PBRUMEK hence Subject does not
know why it was that:ho was opecifically named. When it was
later suggested that this announcement would probably have
ecme effect on bie family, Subject said be just didn't know
what effect it would have and has heard cf none. He agreed
that it was quite ironic that one side of the family was working
with an intolligonce service which was diametrically opposed
to the side to which another momber of the same family was
affiliated and in fact because of his present IDEN B employment
be was actually in the business of hunting them down. Subject
agreed that it was indeed ironic but felt his convictions differed
from his brothers’ and that was that.

Have you told anyone in IDEN N that you are working for WOFIRM?
a Noted that some knew of his past affiliatica hence the question
was qualified to mean bis present affiliation, Later after
reactions were recorded, Subject noted that hie wife ia fully
witting of hia WOFIRM employment as is IDEN O. He aleo
raestoned that a PBRUMEN type, IDEN P, whom ac knows
from childhood has been kidding him constantly in Caracaa

that he ig still with WOFIRM until Sabject finally told him fa.
‘Sare I'm with WOFIRM," but he does not ©
thio had on IDEN P or whether he hao told
anyone of tiis-suapicions of Subject's WOFIKM Involvement.
‘He specifically denied that anyone uther than thece three

persons were knowledgeable,

Doeo anyone in IDEN B know you have this meeting with us today?
Anawer: No.”

Have you ever been asked to perform any task or mission against __
the LNHARP? Answer: No.

Have you ever performed any task or mission on behalf of IDEN G?
Anewer: No,

Has-anyone told-or instructed you on what to report to us? Answors
No.

Have you had contact with IDEN C since 1967? Answer: No. Cone
tinued reactions to this question which necessitated a break-
down test to isolate the r mn for bi: ivity to the topic.

He repeatedly denied that he had had any contact with IDEN C
since the IDEN Q told him not to but acknowledged a physical
revulsion to the mention of the man's naine, and a long dis-
cussion ensued regarding the extent of Subject's involvement
with jthe man. Subject contended that the contact bagan quite
innocently in 1965 and was what Subject initially thought wae a
deliberate provocation to see what Subject's roaction would be.
Subject immediately reported the contact to JMWAVE handlers
who guided him through continued ccntacts and instructions from
IDEN Q. Subject was instructed to sell IDEN C "silenc (guns
with silencers attached--about aix or seven to the est of his
recollection) in order to find out his true identity. Subject fur-
aished phyoical descriptions and Mcense numbers to JMWAVE
and continued to report on contact with IDEN C. He offered
Subject $500 US which JMWAVE told Subject to keep since it was
merely a bonus given him for his work as an intermediary,
IDEN C continued to force contact with Subject and once came

to bis bome in phorts snd made veiled threata which were
answered with counter threats of violence from Subject, and ao
outright threat that Subject would kill IDEN C if he threatened

IRD #7250)

Aim again, In 1967 while with the IDEN R, Subject gavo
: IDEN C some’"pencils' to keep him away which Subject did
4 Bot iken report to WOFIRM bul later did. He gave him about
eee 129 altogether, Subject had promised IDEN G some $00 pounds
: . o£ C/4 oxplvstves, M-2's, sub-machine guns, etc. but all waa
- intended to bait-IDEN C fcr arrest and none was over supptied
tobim, Later Subject ncted alter reacting to
question that‘he had supplied him with pencil:
| “also some,grénades and péntolite. But theve he claims should
be a niattér of record with JMWAVE. The grenades were
typical military type and numbered about 24 to 48 altogether.
Agata, however,’ Subject coted that-he acted only as intermediary
Detween IDEN C and another individual. who ie now deceased tn
a PBRUMEN and did not physically haudle any muritions shipments.
_ As noted above, continued sensitivity to the question uf the amounte
or types of equipment furnished IDEN C is believed attributable
te ancertainty of Subject's part as to exactly what he did arrange
for shipment to IDEN C. As to the basic question about contact
with him since 1967 (or when he was told by IDEN Q to no longer
have contact with IDEN C), Subject incisted that he never re-
established contact of any kind but always checks at IDEN $ to

determine If IDEN C is around.

De you now have in your possession any arms, munitions or articles
of demolition which-was once the property of the LNHARP? Only
those items which were discussed during-a pre-test debriefing,
via., itome brought t Caracas by him in a aultcase and consist-
ing of the following: 3 cr 4 smoke grenades; 6 or 7 booby traps
(army type); 1 piece of delay fuse about 100 feet longs ore primer
cord about 100 feet; 2 or 3 MK2 grenades; about 10 pencila (some
regular open market supply ite: and some of the "company"
variety); demolition pliers; knife; compass; metascope (infri
viewer worth about $50 used), These items ke said were taken
while with the IDEN R and with the knowledge of IDEN T although

IDEN T did not know exactly what be had taken. Subject wae uaing
these items frequently in training courses and they were not to
the best of Subject's knowledge the property cf LNHARP at that
time although it ie possible that sumo of these items were at une
time LNHARP and pussibly WOFIRM items. But he explaingd
further that these itoms are plentiful in the Miami area and can

Ht sation Subject noted that be hao heard of many places where
_munitions could be obtained very easily especially in New Jersey,
in California and in Miami, but be dented being personaily
iavolved in ouch dealings. i

‘Have you ever stolen equipment of any type from WOFIRM? Answer:
Yes. About 5 gallons of gas once from a launch boat. Other thas

i this, sotking.

Do you know the identities of perscns who stole arms and equipment
from LNHARP? Anewer: No.

During this time did be give you $500 for equipment which he wanted?
Answer: Yos.

Did you receive more than $500 from him? Answer: No.

Is It correct that you received threats from him? Anewer: Yea.

Beoides tho pencils, ofloncers, grenades and pentolite did you give
him any other items?. Answer: No. (a9 noted continued te
tivity which ie ancxplained except in the examiner's conclusion)

Did IDEN Q tell you to etop contacting him in October or November
19677 Answer: Yes.

Did you contact IDEN C after November 1967? Answer: No. (Slight
senaitivity but explained o8 relating to constant checking on hie
whereabouts to avoid contact.)

Has your employer contacted him since November 19677 Answer:
No, not to his knowledge. On this question Subject noted that his

few.guns (emall caltyre saud nose weapons) which he has
brought tu Caracas with him from Miami aro merely for the
Z perécnal use of seme of his fellow ampluyees in IDEX B, and
"Re bréaka no lawo in bringing them with him on the few trips

ae Usk WOFIRM with bis organization are the silencers which he
reported'on in Miari some months back which his organisation
took from captured guerrillas and which were probably issued
to a group which went to PBRUMEN and were lost. Subject is
positive-they were WOFIRNM issue but purportedly the serial
sumbers which he submitted cculd not be checked.

One additional item which was cloared up dealt with the pentolite
which had been reported yn in Caracas, Subject voluntarily
mentioned that he had seen such a supply under the bed cf a friend.
The supply was attached to magnets which were to be used to
attach the chargé to the underside of a ship in Caribbean waters

of IDEN V or IDEN W naticnality, The charge was to discourage
fartaer shipments between these latter IDENs and PBRUMEN,
Subject sald he detached the magnets from the pentolite and

raining clacees for students with his present
joa who brought it to Caracas was IDEN X,

MEAN HE MIGHT NOT ENGAGE IN SIDE ACTIVITIES OF HIS OWN UNRELATED
TO WOFIRM ACTIVITIES WITHOUT INFORMING WOFIRM.

NOTES

1. Ina Spanish questionnaire of Personal Information made
out in 1961, Subject listed his brother Raul POSADA-Carriles as
an administrator of the ‘Narianao Electric Company as a relative
in some government service. He did not list his brother Roberto
in this section, although he did list Roberto in Para 16,
Subject: Brothers and Sisters.

2, In another signed but undated Spanish Personnel
Information form of apparently 1965, he again listed both his
brothers “in Section MN, Subject: Brothers and Sisters, and in
Section N he again listed his brother Raul, who he stated he
believed to be working for the Cuban government as an engineer.
He again failed to list his brother Roberto.

3. Concerning his PRQ’Part I filled out in March 1965, again ©

no mention of his brother Roberto appears in Section XIV, Subjects

Relatives, Acquaintances and Contacts. in any Government Service.
4. According to POSADA's own admission in an LC Flutter

of 14 April 1965, he had been involved in planning for a

Guatemalan coup headed by This matter later

came to the attention of the FBI. There is an FBI report dated
17 May 1965 in the 201. AMCLEVE-15 also furnished information
on this Guatemalan coup for JMWAVE, who disseminated this

information in July 1965. -
5. AMCLEVE-15 informed JMWAVE concerning other independent

exile operations into Cuba in July of 1965.
6. His PRQ Part II, Section XI, dated September 1965, says

that "Subject is of good character, very relaible and security

i
i
i


conscious. Subject demonstrated good security techniques while
reporting on the activities" of boncerning the —

attempted coup against Guatemala.
7. An FBI report of 30 September 1965 outlines the contacts
\

that had been madé by some Americans seeking to purchase pistols,
blasting caps, hand gernades and silencers. This is the first
indication in the 201.that Subject was involyed with Frank

Lang .“Lefty" Rosenthal, Miami, who had the reputation of gambler ©

and hoodlum associated with other hoodlums and jewel thieves in

“the Miami area. a i
8. In a report filled out by Subject on 21 April 1966
to update his employee file, Subject again reported his brother
Raul POSADA in government service but failed again to report
brother Robérto POSADA. ; i
9. A JMWAVE memo WIR-1299, 21 July 1966, explains a request
from AMCLEVE-15 to resign from his job as an instructor in the
maritime training section to accept a job on the Junta being
set up at that time to govern the activities of RECE, COMMANDOS L,
30 NOVEMBER MOVEMENT and the 2506 BRIGADE. An FBI report of
29 July 1966 and another for 1 August 1966 both commented that —
Subject had been approved by the exile groups to accept the
position of military leader of the newly formed alliance,
10. On 1 August 1966 AMCLEVE-15 was transferred from the
wus

Training branch to the CI branch of JMWAVE. He w&#@ be used to

for two months. He stated that he last knew his brother to be

i
:
i
i

* @mployed for ‘the Cuban Telephone Company in Havana and in
Cienfuegos, Las Villas Province. He said that he last saw his

brother Roberto in April 1961. This is at variance with info
in the 1961 Questionnaire which stated he ‘came to the U.S. as
a political exile 28 February 1961.

12, A. JMWAVE 3182 (IN 01749), 23 September 1966, stated

- we The Station desires to exp n its viewpoint on AMCLEVESTS
clearly because of what could. concei ly be construed to be a tone

of inpatience in the first line of Reference A. First of..all, why do
we want to hire AMCLEVE-18% Our ebjcctive is to use hit as a unilateral

yenetration of which controls that organization.

ecifically, we would like to nenetrate the inner circle surrounding

TOENTITY and CIRASH=4, The recent provocation (reported in reference C)
which we believe was run ty IDENTITY isa clear indication of the need
for this type of penetrstion over and above the normal need fer
penetration of security services.

@, What we are net trying to do is to make a CIGOAL-1 or

ANOT=200 out of AMCLEVE-TS: that is, put him on the payroll as an
iviser to CIRASIIH4. Ye t to be very clear on this point, since

tay he the cause of Headquarters' concern, His role will not be

sory, AMCLEVE-1§ is to be used to obtain counterintelligence
internation to protect the Station and its operations and to get for
us that portion of the intelligence available in CIRASH which is not
made available to the Station via the liaison channel.

3. From the inforsation available to us, AMCLEVE-15 seems to
present an almost golden onportunity to Station: i.e., a cleared
WOFTRM agent (who although terminated
the JUKAVE area), who is 3

CIRASH and the pec tive unit within
which may have renitoring of KOFIRY activities as one of its

ebiectives., We say “seens to present” because, although we have
confirmation From CIRAS#=15 that MICLEVE-15 does in fact hold the
pesition descrihed above, we are of an open mind regarding the
ability of his © and we are completely willing to accept any
silitate against his secure and fruitful employment),

MEMORANDUE FOR THE RECORD

WENORANDUM FOR AMCLEVE/15's File 14 August 1967

SUBJECT: Salary Misunderstanding
A
“ORIGINATOR: Gary L. FLUSTIKOFF . .

1. ANCLEVE/15 submitted the attached note, written iia
by him, to the writor. -In the note ANCLEVE/15 says ee
“he is not asking for anything but wants tho records checked
fegardirg his past salary of $325.00 per month, ANCLEVE/1S
claimed his. former CO) tol.
him that effectivo Octobor iG he would be’ paid $i
per month by BOFACT4 while the balanee would be pleced ina ants for hin,

2. the record ANCLEVE/15 was told by the writer _-
and not that effective August 1966 (not October)’: Fe
he would be cut back in his salary, to approximately .
$100.00 por month, He was cut back from $350.00, not
$325.00, for reasons of cconcemy and cover and he was
agrecable to the cutback. The writer did not tell him
that the balance of approximately $212.00 was boing
saved for him; only that his gross salary would be
raised to $350.00 in the event RECK ever stopped paying
him his salary. (It was assumed that his RECE employment
might be short-lived). For administrative reasons the -
salary cutback was not offective until September 1966 and ~
from latter date until Docembor 1966 he was paid $111.13,
From January 1967 until June 1967 he was paid $110.90
duo to a FICA chango. During the entire period, September
1966 to: June 1967, ANCLEVE/15 was budgeted by JNWAVE in
the amount of $350.00 gross with the notation of his
voucher of "possibility of paying balance later". | Then
in June 1967 ANCLEVE/15's salary was increased to $350.00 :
gross, as so promised, because he was unemployed during _
most of June.

3. The writer oxplained the above to ANCLEVE/15
and he seomed satisfied. He told the writer that he hnd
ta borrow some moncy to cover expenses in connection
with his trip to Venezuela.

Action Require

) Reference: JMWAVE-8256, 11 July 1967

el “1. Ascieported in.reference, AMCLEVE/15 was terminated
effective 11July 1967. ANCLEVE/IS was terminated because he
resigned from his position as|
@ Miami “base

c)
organization, in-éarly June 1967 and "ne thus lost access. to his
target, as AMCLEVE/15 had been reporting on the activities of
RECE’since 1 August 1966. In addition, JMWAVE does not have a
current need or any operational interest in RECE, and the AMOT
organization has the capability to penetrate and report on RECE
if and when the need should arise. After AMCLEVE/15 resigned
from RECE, he was a candidate for employment in the AMOT organ-
ization; however, because of his involvement with Frank "Lefty"
ROSENTHAL and for other security reasons it was decided bait
the AMOT organization should not hire him

2. AMCLEVE/15 began his employment with WOFACT in April
196S and initially served as an instructor in the Maritime
Training Branch:‘of JMWAVE. He was also active in reporting on
exile activities. On 1 August 1966, AMCLEVE/15 was transferred

to the CI Branch where he was used to report on the activities
of RECE until his resignation in early June 1967.

if 3. Since AMCLEVE/15 was amicably terminated, JMWAVE does
not envision any problems at this time. AMCLEVE/15 plans to
seek employment in through an old friend

who resides there,
ae 4%. On 21 July 1967 AMCLEVE/15 was given a termination

bonus of $650.00, which is. equivalent. to two months salary, minus
FICA and federal income tax. He was paid $549.60 net.
