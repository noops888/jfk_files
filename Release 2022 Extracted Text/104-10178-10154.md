Have you over travelled to Washlngton, D. C. I Answeri Yes.

. Oace sevarel yeare ago.

Have jou ever boon to the sovles Ualon? Arawers No.

Are any of your relatives membera of the Communier Party?

Afies some dlacussion Subject felt li probable that they viere.

Those specifically mentioned were bla two brothers IDEN D

and IDEN E and also posalbly a sistes samod IDEN E ubo la

also in PBRUMEN and married to a Captaln ln the Militia.

When the quenton was prefacod with the wordo: "Is it your

•belled that gay of your relatives are members," Subject'a

answas was always yes. He based this belief on the lace tbas

both brothers bald bighly responsible positiona in key indusistes

In PBRUMEN and hence must be members. He also noted thas

prtor-to his leaving PBRUMEN, he (Subject) and blo two brochero

had many discussions about polidics and their viama dillerod

Irom subject's. As lor hla brother IDEN E. Subject regarded

bim an the "brala" in the lamily and originally a very sellgiova

person who attended Catholle servicos dally. He later evinced

diatrust for tbe clergy la PBRUMEN and lamed them for she

downlall of the charch. When Castro made bis movo, IDEN E

was in complete sympathy with bim and remained with bim

despite his apparent conversica lo Communlaws, although

IDEN E never acknowledgod lbas he bad bean a Communlos and

would unusly retort with a comment that he (IDEN E) WaS s

"'bumanist."

Are any of your relailves working los PBRUMEN Intelligence?

His angwer was that be fell thas at least one of them was accord-

lag to what KALBING inferIod duriag his discussion with Subject

the day beforo the SOSWIRL teAl. The was bie brothor IDEN D.

but bo also wondered about bia brother IDEN E tho migbi also bo

with PBRUMEN Intelligence because accurding to what bis mother

mentioned is a letter sume time 8go, IDEN E bad been la lao

USSR receiving fraluing of some sore. Iblo tradalng laotad los

This letter lacidentally was posted in 1967 fa fow

montha before comlag to Caracas) and not 1966 as nucod la

Stallon files. Stace arrival la Caracas, Subject has writtes

bis mother unly once and had the letter pusted from Miami to

prevent anyone knowing bla exact whereabouts. (In addition

to these contacts, Subject has sent une telegram to bis mother

soOn aítor the IDEN I just to let hor know be was alright.) It

was abuut this time that IDEN E wrote to him and criticized

bis participation in IDEN I.

Have you seen althor of your brothers since 1961? Subject answered

DO. Last BaW IDEN E at the alapore ln the diatance bus tbero

More employees fsom IDEN E's placa of employmeat present

and IDEN E was apparently reluctant to go near the plane. Sinco

1961 Subject has not seen any member of bis family and as timo

goe8 on duea not mias them as much. The persono be clalma to

have been closest to were his aunt and grandmother and addresses

commenta to them personally when he doss milta to his molter.

When further discussing bla brothere un this question, Subject

types with good school records.

VALUABLE SOURCE SINCE PICKED UP BY CARACAS STATION FEBRUARY

1965. WE BELIEVE HE COLLABORATING FULLY WITH WOFIRM AND WOULD

NOT EXPOSE, INFORM ON OR WORK AGAINSI WOFIRM. THIS DOES NOT

MEAN HE MIGHT NOT ENGAGE IN SIDE ACTIVITIES OF HIS OWN UNRELATED

TO WOFIRM ACTIVITIES WITHOUT INFORMING WOFIRM.

2. BELIEVE GOOD TRADECRAFI REQUIRES HE UNDERGO SGSWIRL

AT THIS TIME. ALSO WE WOULD LIKE REGULARIZE HIS STATUS, REIN-

STATE HIS CLEARANCE AND REMOVE HIM FROM "HOSTILE" LIST SO WE

CAN WORK WITH HIM MORE CLOSELY, LEVY REQUIREMENTS, AND THEREBY

REAP FULL BENEFIT HIS POTENTIAL.

3. WE WOULD PROPOSE LIMIT EXAMINATION TO POINTS DESIGNED

DETERMINE THAT HE HAS NOT, IS NOT, AND DOES NOT PLAN ENGAGE IN

ACTIVITIES HOSTILE TO WOFIRM. OUR ONLY REAL CONCERN IS TO BE :

ASSURED HE NOT WORKING AGAINST US. SINE MUCH OF HIS VALUE

Section N he again listed his brother Raul, who he stated he

believed to be working for the Cuban government as an engineer.

He again failed to list his brother Roberto.

indication in the 201. that Subject was involved with Frank

Lang. "Lefty" Rosenthal, Miami, who had the reputation of gambler

and hoodlum associated with other hoodlums and jewel thieves in

brother Roberto POSADA.

ABSTRACT.

MICHA

MISERTM

TIMED

HUi 7 1957

DOC. MICRO. SER.

As reported in reference, AMCLEVE/15 was terminated

effective 11 July 1967.

AMCLEVE/1'5 was terminated because he

resigned from his position ás

• a Miami based Cuban exile

organization,

in early June 1967 and he thus lost access. to his

target; as AMCLEVE/15 had been reporting on the activities of

RECE since 1 August 1966.

In addition, JMWAVE does not have a

current need or any operational interest in RECE, and the AMOT

organization has the capability

to penetrate and report on RECE

the need should arise.

After AMCLEVE/15 resigned

from RECE, he was a candidate for

employment in the AMOT organ-

ization; however, because of his involvement with Frank "Lefty"

ROSENTHAL and for other

security reasons

it was decided that

the AMOT organization should not hire him.

AMCLEVE/15 began his employment with WOFACT in April

and initially

served as an instructor in the Maritime

Training

Branch of JMWAVE.

He was also active in reporting on

On 1 August 1966, AMCLEVE/15 was transferred

to the cl Branch where he was used to rejort on

of RECE until his resignation in early June 1969.

3.

Since AMCLEVE/15 was amicably terminated, UMWAVE does

not envision any problems at this time.

AMCLEVE/15 plans to

seek employment in

through an old friend

who resides there.

On 21 July 1967 AMCLEVE/15 was given a termination

bonus of $650.00, which is equivalent. to two months salary, minus

FICA and federal income tax.

He was paid $549.60 net.
