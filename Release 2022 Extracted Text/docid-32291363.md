MM 830-C advised that Dade County Circuit Judge JOE
EATON has ordered BEN NOVACK, operator of the Fontainebleau
Hotel, Miami Beach, and the hotel to pay a judgment close to
$228,000 brought about by a judgment obtained by JAMES TALCOTT,

given to Taylor Construction Co., Miami, Fla., for loans in
April, 1962, and which notes were assigned by the Taylor
Construction Co. to James Talcott, Inc. on loans the Taylor
