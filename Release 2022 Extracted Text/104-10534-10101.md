Technical Analysis of Letter and Envelope -

DB CASE $4361

WE/2 Meno dated 13 December 1963

1. In response to referenced request, an original typewritten

letter and envelope addressed to the American Embassy, Stockholm,

vere examined 1n order to determine the origin of the letter and the

nationality of the writer.

2.

The following conclusions were drawn concerning the letter

and envelope:

The typewriter in question 18 equipped With an obsolete

style of German-made type which, according to our references, was

fitted on a mumber of typevritars made in Germany during the 1920s

The posaible makes would be stoewer, Torpedo,

Nercodes, Rheimmetall, Urania, Orga, Fortuna, Continental, Kappel,

Groms, Irlumph, Merz and possibly sons others. Of there makes,

the Torpedo, Mercedes, Rhelmetall and Irlumph vare probably the

most widely distributed.

b. The machine in question 1s equipped vith a black and red

ribbon. The xeyboard is very probably svadish, as shoun by tw

SEIIKE-OVAIS:

unlaut-u for hyphen and "?" for

_*. These

characters are adjacent on the standard suedish keybourd, but not

on the German.

The unlout-s was not used In the street address,

"Strandvagen" (where the dots should have been placed over the

second "a"). Thie night be either a simple overaight or an attempt

to conceal the writer's lantllarity with the correct spelling.

c. me paper of the latter 18 of the international standara

(DIN) 8129 "A4" which 1s almost universally used in Sueden. The

Inen-textured statlonery seems to be rather coumon 1n Sweden.

The two snaller pieces of blank paper natch the letter paper with

respect to width, thickness, color, texture and loot-through, and

vars probably cut from another sheet of the sans type. The envelope

matches specimens of Swedish envelopes taken from DB/5-Postal.

Intelligence files.

lue letter was posted fran the Stockholm Ban post office,

which is located in the central railway terminel in Stockholm.

All mail deposited 1n street ma11 boxes 1n this area or in the post

office would be processed through this station.

e. The cancellation cachet on the envelope is identical in

all respects (format, postmark, number style and lengtn of killer

bars) to exemplars available in our office..

I. The postage 18 correct for Suedish Internal mall and the

postage stemp 1a of current issue.

A possible Irregularity is the time lag betveen the internal

date of the letter, the date of the postaark and the date of receiit

in the American Embassy. The total time from the Internal date of

the letter to the time of receipt 1s eight days, the time between

the date of posting and the date of recelpt is more than three days.

This transit time of more than three days for intra-city mail appears

Irregular then compared with the average transit time of only two-

three days for arrival between Stockholm and the United States.

3. The text of the letter varrants some comments because a number

of pecullarities were noted - aside from pure spelling or typing errors -

which seem to indicate a swedish writer. The following words represent

either Swedish spalling or modification: "reserv", "etablished", "wurded',

"Krustjer". Other examples of Swedish grammar and syntax would be:

"must" (as past tense), "in Soviet" (Suedish form but not spelling),

4. Another sigalficant detall is the name given, "Ryo liong Yüan".

"Ryo" is not a standard spelling in any known Romanization system used

for Chinese.

"R" 1s seen in the ner Chinese Commnist national system,

but never in combination with "yo". "Ryo" I8 a Japanase spelling. In

the name given it is not known whether the Chinese of Western presen-

tation 1s used, 1o other vords, whether "Ryo" or "Yuan" 1e mant to be

the surname.

Among Chinese syllables which could be represented by the

Japanese "Ryo" are Ilao, Llang and Lung. Of these Lung (TC: 7893) and

Llang (IC:2733) ere used as surnemes.

In either case,

"Ryo" 18 hardly

a name by which a real Chinese vould Identify himself.

5. In summary, and based on the above information, It is concluded

that the letter vas transmitted via normal svedish postel channela..

letter 1s probably a "crank letter", most Itkely written by a swede,

using a swedish-keyboard typewriter and Swedish stationery.
