*AMICE~31 invited to be delegate at ninth CLASC Consejo planned for
May 13-17 in Santo Domingo, A-31 could be useful as reporter
and/or action agent since he is opposed to CLASC alliance with
Marxist groups and in opposition to Emilio Naspero.

**Hased on recollection of A-31's previous performance at Bogota
CLASC meeting, in which AMICE-31 seemed inclined to Maspero,
Caracas sees little point in WOFIRN subsidizing A-3l's trip this
time, but defers action to Hqs and Santo Domingo.
