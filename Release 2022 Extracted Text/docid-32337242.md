-On January 20, 1962, PSI JUAN MACHADO, Miami, fice
a Cuban exile residing in “Miami, Florida (protect), who”
maintains contact with pro and anti-FIDEL-CASTRO elements

in Cuba and in Miami, Florida, who has furnished reliable

that a search of the x

explained that most -| is°"Of the hotel are destroyed
after one year, and that shé doves not believe that the
records for the year 1958 are complete.

~ '. A check made at 127:-Southwest 9th Street, Miami,
Florida, on January 18, 1962, reflected that there is no
longer a house located at that address,that it has been
razedi and replaced by a parking lot and commercial estab-
lishment, and inquiry in the neighborhood failed to disclose
anyone who has any information concerning the occupants
of that address in 1958. PSI MACHADO advised that
although OLGA DIAZ SUAREZ apparently has moved. from- her
. former address located at Calixto Garcia @71) Regla, Cuba,
some ofher relatives still teside there, and have knowledge
i of the present residence address of OLGA DIAZ: She may be
reached at telephone number 90-61-633, .Havana.

“PSI MACHADO and PSI DE LAS MATAS, both of whom -
have known the family of: OLGA DIAZ SUAREZ and her sister,
DELIA, for over 20 years, are convinced that OLGA DIAZ
SUAREZ is serious in her attempt to defect and seek. poli-
tical asylum in the U.S.A. DE LAS MATAS- stated although
OLGA DIAZ SUAREZ was formerly pro-CASTRO, she has become
disillusioned with the regime of FIDEL CASTRO, inasmuch as
the regime is communist. Both sources advised that OLGA
DIAZ SUAREZ is not active in the almost non-existent
underground in Cuba, and that she has chosen not to be
active in order to avoid having the attention’of the
Cuban authorities attracted to her activities.

Inasmuch as the Bureau can be of little or no
direct assistance to OLGA DIAZ SUAREZ in her defection,
it is recomme cy that the Bureau consider referring this

matter to CIA (U).

UAGB, the Miami Office is not taking any further
action in instant matter.
