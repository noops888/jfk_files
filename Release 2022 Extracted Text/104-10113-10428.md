8 June 1966

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: EPSTEIN, Edward Jay

The Sunday Edition of THE NEW YORK TIMES of 6 June 1966 contained
the attached clipping "Warren Report on Assassination Challenged Again"
in which mention is made that VIKING PRESS is bringing out 15,000 copies
of a book based on a Cornell University Master's thesis "Inquest" by
Subject.

A search of Security Indices and sources available in the Agency
Library has been unproductive which is not surprising that EPSTEIN is
thirty-one years of age and must have spent about the last eight years
as a university student at Cornell and Harvard Universities.

The book has the name of an Agency employee who hasbeen concerned
with the Oswald case, namely Ray ROCG&. . Due to this surfacing of an
Agency employee Edward EPSTEIN and his sources are of importance to ths
Agency.
