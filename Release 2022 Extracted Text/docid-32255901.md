a teryieas On August 22, 1978, Sergy A. Uslov was interviewed a
at his residence relative to an allegation that; through a

friend, Lee Harvey Oswald stated he could make money if he

killed the President. Uslov's mother, Araism Uslov, 55 years,
lives with him; however, was not present at the time of the

visit. He is currently unemployed, having left his job as

a packer/salesman for Fada Industries, 1201 Broadway, New York,
New, York, (212)679-4280, approximately two weeks ago. He-
presently is hopeful of purchasing a Madallion Taxi-cab in

New York City: ;

Uslov stated that he arrived in the United States
via TWA on March 23, 1977, having arrived from Russia through
Austria and Italy (Alien Record #A21703170; Permit #0669968).
His departure from Russia was accomplished through subterfuge.
His mother was of Jewish ancestry and. both he and his mdéther
were granted their request to go to Israel. Since such travel
to Israel necessitates first stopping ‘inItaly, upon arrival

Uslov and his mother contacted the U.S. Embassy and were per-

mitted to enter the United States. The CIA contacted. Uslov
via telephone approximately two months later. A meeting was
arranged and he was debriefed as to his knowledge of Russian
life, KGB, etc. At this point, Uslov stated that he would
shoot himself if: he ever had to return to Russia.

After sixteen years of age when continuous educa-
tion ceased, Uslov.worked at several odd jobs while inter-
mittently attending the Institute of History and of Foreign

. Languages. He speaks German, Russian, White Russian and En-
glish.

Uslov stated that he had written a manuscript cone
cerning Lee Harvey Oswald; a manuscript written mostly from
information he had elicted from Pavez A. Golovachev in Minsk,
the U.S.S.R. Uslov first met Golovachev through a friend,

V. Egor, in 1965. After the casual meeting, Egor told him
that Golovachev was a good friend of Lee Harvey Oswald. Sever-
al years later, Uslov néxt met Golovachev while he was drink-
ing and Golovachev stated that he dia know Oswald and that

his wife Marina was his girlfriend before their marriages
Sometime in 1975, while in Golovachev's apartment in Moscow,

an intoxicated Golovachev supplied much informative data
relative to Oswald.

Golovachev explained té him that he and Lee Harvey
Oswald worked together at a radio factory in Moscow and were

close friends. Oswald was a very nervous person; nervous

about everything, laughed like a crazy man, and liked his
wife "very, very much." Further, he had stated that Oswald
saw how life was really like in Russia and was very disen-
chanted. Oswald wanted a lot and the Government "did every-
thing." He even tried Russian writing once and failed, as
usual. Then he expressed the desire to return to America
with his wife, also a wish of hers. Golovachev asked, "What
are you going to do in America?" Golovachev was inauifing as
how was he going to earn money as he did not have a talent
for anything. Oswald replied, "Don't worry. There are

many ways to make good money." Oswald stated that he could

get "good money? for example, by killing the President in a
sof

to

good way. Oswald further stated that "you don't know America.”

The people would make you a hero; they'd write books, maga-
zine articles, even make: movies about you! Further, Oswald
implied that he most likely would not receive the money per-
sonally but that the money would go to his wife.

Golovachev further told Oslov that because of his
contact with Oswald, immediately following the assassination
of President Kennedy and identification of Oswald, the KGB

took him into custody. After hours of questioning, . the KGB

which included photographs and papers.

, searched his apartment and took everything pertaining to Oswald,

It is surmised that as Golovachev became
garrulous while drinking, the KGB discovered that he was
still in. possession of a group photograph depicting Lee,
Marina and Golovachev among other people. Accordingly,
sometime in 1971 or 1972, the KGB took the photo.

Uslov explained that he wrote the complete story
in Russian and submitted it to the CIA.for transmittal to
the HSCA. They advised that it be translated to English.
In November of 1977, he sent the manuscript to Radio Freedom
on 42nd Street in New York city for translation and to be
forwarded to the Committee. It is his belief that he was
contacted by the HSCA as a result of reading his manuscript.
He is presently attempting to locate his copy, which is in
Russian, ‘for our perusal.

After giving a full dissertation on life in Russia,
Uslov requested that his identity remain anonymous. He wanted

to give his information only to the HSCA.
