2.

Mr. Wallach asked Mr. Rocca if he were aware of

the existance of

a 201 file on Lee Harvey Oswald prior

to the assassination of President Kennedy on November 22,

1963. Mr. Rocca advised that he was unaware of the file

until the Monday after the event. Under questioning MI.

Rocca went on to say that to the best of his knowledge

there were only five documents actually in the 201 file

and were of an interagency nature.

He suggested Mr.

Hartman be queried on this point.

Further, MI. Rocca

went on to say that there was apparently an error in the

original file opening of Oswald's 201 which was under

the name of Lee Henry Osawald and not. Lee Harvey Oswald,

but this was a human error which did not deter the

investigation.

In response to why the Agency was not

involved in the investigation of Oswald in the pre-

assassination period, Mr. Rocca stated that there existed

guide lines under the Delimitation Agreement with regard

to military defectors which limited jurisdiction of these

cases to the FBI and to the responsible military arm..

In this instance it was the Navy and the FBI to the

exclusion of CIA.

When Mr. Wallach alluded to

allegations that Oswald may have been an agent of

CIA or was sent to the USSR with instructions to.

defect, Mr. Rocca made a strong point that Oswald

was never a CIA agent nor to his knowledge was an

American citizen ever asked to defect to the USSR,

although there have been many Soviets who were sent

by Russian intelligence as defectors to the West.

3. Mr. Wallach expressed interest in reviewing

the chronology of Oswald's activities prior to the

assassination and at what point in time did Mr.

Rocca become involved.

Mr. Rocca explained that

during the period of 23 November 1963 through mid-

January 1964 action responsibility for the investigation

rested with WH Division. After that he became involved:

He referred to it as the GPFLOOR Phase. 26 During this

period Messrs. J.C. King, C/WH and Jack Witten)

C/WH/Mexico City Desk were the two Washington level

officers in charge.

Mr. Win Scott, who was COS Mexico

City, was responsible in Mexico.

Mr. Dave Phillips,

who was Stationed in Mexico was also knowledgeable.

In Washington, Witten)who had oversight of GPFLOOR

dealt directly,with Mr. Helms, who presumably kept Mr.

McCone advised.

Mr. Rocca then recounted Oswald's

military career and Oswald apparent contacts with the

Cubans while he was in the Marines. At this point Mr.

Rocca made a point that there are gaps in the infor-

mation provided by both Soviet and Cuban Governments to

the Warren Commission and these gaps were, in his words,

"relevent and open."

Mr.

„Rocca stated Oswald's con-

tacts with both the Cubans and Soviets should be

investigated. He related how Oswald went to Finland.

then to the USSR, how he was

who he said was in facta KGB agent.

Mr. Rocca suggested that Oswald's attempted suicide was

part of a

scenario to "allow Oswald to remain in Moscow

by a reluctant government to permit further assessing."

His handling in the Soviet Union, his resettlement in

Minsk, the fact he was allowed to marry Marina, whose

uncle was in the MVD, etc. were areas which Mr. Rocca's

comments were that there are areas which the Warren

Commission did not fully investigate and which, in

retrospect, suggested to him that the question that

Oswald may have been under KGB control was

never re-

solved.

4. At this point in the interview the questioning

turned to assassination plots against Castro. MI.

Wallach asked Mr. Rocca if he participated in any such

plots or if he was aware of any.

Mr. Rocca gave a

negative response then regaled the group about the

international political atmosphere at the time,

recounting President Kennedy's meeting with Khruschev

in Vienna, the Soviet build up in Cuba, the Missile

crises, Castro's long visit to Cuba in 1963 which led

to greater assistance by the KGB to the Cuban DGI, and

finally the fact that Castro held a press conference

at the Brazilian Embassy in Havana which was clearly

according to Mr. Rocca a warning to the U.S. that any

attempts on Cuban leaders, i.e. Castro, would be met in

kind.

Mr. Rocca referred to Des Fitzgerald's trip to

Paris to recruit AMLASH for the purposes of overthrowing

Castro, Fitzgerald's close contacts with the Kennedy

family and tact he replaced Bill Harvey in the Special

Project to assassinate Castro.

(One of the Staffers

referred to it as Task Force W.) Mr. Rocca then com-

mented on Operation MONGOOSE which he said Bobby

Kennedy was running with McNamara and which involved

Mr. Fitzgerald. The meeting broke at this point.
