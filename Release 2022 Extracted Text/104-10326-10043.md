THE DECLASSIFICATION LEGISLATION THAT CAN BE ATTACHED TO THE MEMO.
WE BELIEVE THAT SUCH HARD COPY EVIDENCE WILL .

5. THE BOTTOM LINE HERE IS THAT WE DO NOT WANT EVEN TO

RELEASING THE DOCUMENTS, SUMMARIES THAT OMIT ALL REFERENCE
{ WILL SUFFICE. :

6. FYI: OUR FALLBACK POSITION IF THE BOARD TURNS DOWN THE

SUMMARIES, IS TO MAKE CLEAR THAT WE CANNOT RELEASE THE
DOCUMENT, EVEN IN REDACTED FORM, WITHOI
PERMISSION; FURTHER, THAT IF WE SEEK AND ARE DENIED PERMISSION AND
- ‘THE BOARD NONETHELESS PROCEEDS WITH THE DECLASSIFICATION, 7T WILL
HAVE A TREMENDOUS NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH .THE

IN SUM, OUR GOING- POSITION IS WE WANT TO
AVOID RAISING THE SPECTER 'THAT THE AGENCY MAY

HAVE TROUBLE PROTECTING THEIR SECRETS. IF THE BOARD TURNS DOWN
OUR. INITIAL PROPOSAL AND INSISTS WE SEEK’ z PERMISSION TO

DECLASSIFY, WE WILL DO SO. IN SUCH AN PEOPLE
BELIEVE A STRONGLY-WORDED DOCUMENT FROM THE! -EFUSING
WOULD PROBABLY PERSUADE THE BOARD NOT TO RELEASE THE

!DOCUMENT. WE WILL KEEP YOU ADVISED ON HOW THIS is
PROGRESSING AND WOULD APPRECIATE ANY FURTHER GRIST FOR THE MILL AS
WE CRAFT Of! MEMO TO THE BOARD AS WELL AS THE TEXT OF THE
