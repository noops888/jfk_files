(EE), and Infurmation Services (SI):

They handle such functions

as spottini prospective agents, providing operational information,

destine communications butween headquarters and agents in the

field, procuring operational funds and supplies, etc.

The Department of Illegal Centers (Departamento Contros. Ilegales -

of the Colonial Bureau (see below).

In debricfing foreign visi-

tors, the department often works through ICAP, which makes arrange-

ments for many visits to Cuba; in many instances, the visitors

supply information unwittingly

and are never aware that they are

in contact with Cuban intolligence.

The NO Department does not

itself recruit agents; it only

watches for, screens, and evaluates

foreign contacts as agent candidates.

If the persons it sclects
