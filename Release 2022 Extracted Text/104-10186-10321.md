The Director!

The director general of the DG! is Manuel PINELRO Losada, known
as “Red Beard” (Barba Roja).4 He is closely associated with
Radiro VALVES, 'to whom he has direct access at any time; he is
required to report regularly te Fidel CASTRO and to coordinate
with him all expenditures of large sums: and he also has direct
contact with GUEVARA, Raul CASTRO often visits PINEIRO's office;
his principal interest appears to be the guerrilla schools (see
below), but he may have others in the DGI. PINEIRO also handled
the principal contacts with the Soviet advisers of the DGI. His
direction of the DGI is handled through a deputy, but he also
has direct contact as desired with department chiefs and lower~
level personnel: chiefs of field stations report directly to him,
although other field-station business is handled through the
departments responsible for. field work, PINEIRO himself has
trained some important agents in field work and has subsequently
acted a@.their handling officer.

PINEIRO has his office in his residence at 41st Avenue and
Asth Street in the Miramar district of Habana. There he keeps
functional files of everything concerning the DGI: other files
from individual sections are bronght to him for review and then
returned to the department or section that maintains them,

There is a daily courier service between his house and the DGE
headquarters, The house h at least two separate telephones,
one personal and one official, the latter proviaing direct com-
munication with all,government agencies. One of the telephone
fuabers is 29-1257.5 The outside entrance of the house always
has two guards in olive-green uniforms; they are probably from
the DSE. In addition, PINEIRO has a bodyguard staff of six, also
protably from the DSE, Three of them are always, with him on 24~
hour shifts: one acts as chautfeur when he goes out, while the
othee two follow in a second car. He keeps three cars, all 1961
Oldsmobiles, one blue, one beige, and one black,

In his home office PINEIRO has an aide, pseudonym “castor,"6 whe
handles the office work but does not attend private interviews.
In Cuba he stays in the office and does not accompany PINEIRO
outside the office. When PINEIRO travels abroad, "Castor" ac-
companies him, as for example on his visit to Moscow in April
4. At the main DGI headquarters, PINEIRO also has a secre-
tary. pseudonym "Vidalina," and a clerk-typist. pseudonym
“Zoraida"; they occupy desks in the executive office of the DGI
deputy chief but work strictly for PINEIRO, "Vidalina” handles
all incoming and outgoing correspondence and cable traffic and
distributes it both within DGI headquarters and abroad.

DG Main Headquarte’

The main headquarters of the directorate is known as "Department
M" of the Ministry of Interior. but very few people know any~
thing about it or are even aware of its existetice. It occupies

a house and grounds which were formerly the property of the GOMEZ
Mena family. {[t covers a whele city block bounded by 49th and
Sist Avenues and 78th and SUth Streets in the Larrazabal section
of the Marianao suburb of Habana. The block is « compound sur-
rounded by a concrete wall, sith trees planted completely around
it inside, There are two catrances! a main entrahce with wooden

Rates Located near the center of the block on 80th Street and a
back entratice with steel doors located directly through the
bleck on 78th Street. The main entrance is manned by guards
armed with PPShA machineguns: the rear entrance is kept locked
and is used only in emergencies. No pass or ideatéfication is
required to enter the grounds. :

The headquarters compound (sce diagram on page 15) contains all
the DGI offices except PINEIRO's home office, the three opera-
tional departnents. and the Special Schools Department. described
below.. The main. building. called M Building, is situated near #
the center of the compound but off the main axis between the
gates. It houses most of the offices in its two stories and also
contains a canteen, public teiephones, and a police radio for the
city and the Ninistry.of Interior, There are no large assenbly
rooms; conferences are held in small rooms. Within the compound,
separated from M Building by driveways and parking lots, are
several other structures:

a, A twyestory building housing the Personnel Department on the .
first floor and the Inspection Department on the second.

b. Three one-story service buildings: a guard office with
sleeping quarters for 20 to 25 guards, a food-storage ware-
house, and a clothing-storage warehouse. The guard office
and the Personnel-Inspection building flank the main entrance

on 80th Street,

ce. A two-story building, in the angle of the grounds forned by
78th Street and 49th Avenue, housing the Technical Operational
Support Department. Two of its sections, the Photographic
Laboratory and the Concealment Device Section, occupy indi-
vidual buildings in the compound,

General administration of the DGI is;handled from the M Building.
where PINEIRO's deputy, (fnu) CHAIN,7 pscudonym "Agusto," has
his office. Besides acting as director general when PINEIRO is
away from Cuba, CHAIN is responsible specifically for management
of large expenditures, South Anerican affairs, and the approval
of false passports for travelers. He signs, in pseudonym, all
notices and circulars issued to the directorate, His secretary
has the pseudonym. "Georgina." CHAIN's office, through "Vidalina,
distributes cable traffic to the DGI departments. Incoming and
outgoing cable traffic and diplomatic pouch traffic are received
at this. office from the Central Ciphering Service (Servicio
Central de Citrados - SCC), which is a communal coding and de-
coding service operated by the DSE. CHAIN's office apparently
also acts as a receiving and distributing center for clandestine
radio traffic but does not itself send or receive radio messages;
the actual tvansimission is possibly controlled by the Communist

Party.

Attached to the DSi headquarters is a group of Soviet advisors,
who occupy offices ia M-Building. Their presence and identities

Soviets can visit any cepartment whenever they wish.

Information obtained by. DGI agenta abrond can be passed to the
Sovict advisors.S The five known are tho following:

“El Frances” (The Frenchman), PINRIRO's personal advisor,

is apparently the chief Soviet advisor in Cuba. Ho has

an office in M Ruilding and froquently visits PINEIRO's
- house, He was born between 1909 and 1914; is about five
fect saven inches tall and of modium build; has very grey
hair; has blue eyes with bags under then; and wears at all
tiaos gold-franed glasses with small-~to-nedium round lenses.
His Spanish is fairly good. He bas a car assigned by tho
Cuban governmeat and drives it himself.

b, A Soviet ran, nane-unknown, accompanics "El Frances." He
is five feet eight inches tall, is of mediua to thin build,
weighing about 148 pounds, and is clean shaven. An officer
who sow hin frequently at DGI headquarters hever heard him

Bpeak.

"Juan," who shares an M Building office with "Bl Frances"
but works principally “in the Illegal Department, is the
consultant on illegal operations, directs the recruitaent
and handling of agents, arranges their entry and cover, and
maintains files, At one time ho spent about six months in
France; the general impression is that he was ther: as an
illegal resident rather than in the Soviet Emhassy. He
spoaks excellent Spanish with very little accent and ap-
parently has known the Innguage a long tine. ie too has a
car assigned by the Cuban government and drives it hiaself,
Ho was born between 1919 and 1924 and is an active, athletic
man, about six feet tali and weighing a ansky 200 pounds,
with bice eyes. ifa looks young, aitheugh his hair is grey,
as is the short-clipped mustache he wears low on his lip.

OF the eight departments making up the headquarters, three are
operational, four ave concerned with operational support er
training, and one is administrative. The three operational de-~
partments are Legal Centers (Centros Legales = NS). Mlegal
(egak), and National Liberation (iberacton Nacional - LN);
the Tast two were formerly a single department, hnown as MA
(Intelligence), All thr departments handle operations abroad
for the purpose of collecting information on the -host country,
Promoting Cuban political aims, and conducting subversive ac-
tivities. Their operations are distinguished by tuo factors,
Jegal connections and Communist Party-lefUst group Liaison,
The Department of Legal Centers is responsible for operatieas
conducted through Cuban official missions in countries with which
Cuba has diplomatie relations and has normally ‘nothing to do with
illegal agent The other two departments handle illegal agents,
both in countries with which Cuba has relations and in those with
whkch she has none. Illegal Department has no connection
with Communist ies or organized leftis! groups abroad: the
National Liberacien Department deals mainly with such parties
and groups: the Department of Legal Ccuters may work with them
ov-unilaterally, ALL three departments are organized in geo-
Phteal divisions with area desks for each country within
r vespective fields or responsibility; there is thus some

the
overlapping in desk coverage.

The DGI has two types of overseas intelligence operations (as
distinct from guerrilla warfare operations covered below in
Paragraphs 19 and 20): legal field stations and illegal agents.
The legal field station exists in every country with which Cuba
ax diplomatic relations; its personnel are members of the local
Cuban diplomatic. co + Or trade mission. Officers are
selected from all pivts of the DGL organization; ne distinetion
is made, for example. between officers from the Illegal Depart-
ment and the Natioval Liberation Department, but each person
assigned overseas performs whatever duties the local situation

Field stations y in stze, depending on local objectives and
the quality of diplomatic relations. “In Soviet Bloc countries,
for example, field stations are usually small, with only one or
two ofticers, who have no intelligence collection or similar
responsibility but are charged prancipally with aiding travelers
to Cuba and with liaison with the local intelligence service. 5

and lectures held periodically for members of the mission, but
this is a task shared by all misston members and is not assigned
to any officer specifically. Physical sucurity, such as techni-
cal examination of Cuban premises for audio surveillance devices,
is not a DGI responsibility: it is perforsed by the DSE,

In countries with which Cuba docs not have diplomatic relations,
DGI activitics ‘are handled by agents stationed permanently in
the country as illegal agents or as members of Communist Parties
and leftist groups. Their assignments are sabotage. subversion,
selgction and training of guerrifla warfare candidates and other
agents or groups in Latin America primarily. The DGL regards
Guatemala and Venezuela as the countries tn which {ts operations
have been most successful. Such fjeld operations are run from
Cuba or from an adjacent country.

The Department of Legal Centers (Wepartamento Centros Legales -
MS). The NS dcpartment is headed by Pedro FAWINAS Diaz, pscu-
"Otoniel and has a staff of 15 to 20 persons Its
offices are not in the M Building compound, but in a building
at the corner of 3ist Avenue and 64th Street in the Marianne
suburb of Habana. The department is in charge of the field
stations, known as legal centers, in ‘fh country with which
Cuba has diplomatic relations or where she maintains commercial
missions, Its personnel are not assigned abroad as a rule:

they act as the service group at headquarters for field person-
nel drawn from any part of the DGI. Field station chiefs, as
noted above, report directly to PINEIRO; the MS Department takes
care of all paper work for the field stations, including photo-
graphing incoming and outgoing ducuments; maintaining fales of
field correspondence; and handling coded radio communications.
Coded radio messages prepared by desk officers are photographed
and sent to the field on microfilm and messages on microtilm
reccived from the field are decoded and passed to the proper
department; MS does not do the decoding itself. The department
does net have its own radio station. It dses not run any agents
abroad; it does, however, assign dead drops and explain their
use to field agents, mostly those of the Lllegal Department.

agents in Asian or African countries, and no agents are known in

Operational Support Departments.

The operational support’ departments of the DGI are Technical
Operational Support (MI). Illegal Centers (MO), Special Schools
(EE), and Information Services (SI) They handle such functions
As spotting prospective agents, providing operational information,
training both intelligence agents and guerrillas, providing clan-
destine communications between headquarters and agents in the
field, procuring operational funds and supplies, etc.

major responsibilities: collection of information from foreigners
visiting Cuba; assessment of visiting foreigners for candidates
for intelligence agents; and screening of letters from abroad
volunteering information, both to extract"any Useful data and to
assess the writers as possible candidates for intelligence use,
Among visiting forcigners, the MO Department dves not concern it-
self with diplomats, they are left to the DSE, nor with foreigners
who are established residents of Cuba, who are the responsibility
of the Colonial Bureau (see below). In debriefing foreign visi-
tors, the department often works through ICAP, which makes arrange-
ments for many visits to Cuba; in many instances, the visitors
supply information unwittingly and are never aware that they are

in contact with Cuban intelligence. The MO Department does not
itself recruit agents; it only watches for, screens, and evaluates
foreign contacts as agent candidates. If the persons it sclects
are members of a Communist Party o- leftist organization, they

are referred to the LN Department: if they are not members of

such groups, they are referred to the Illegal Department; one

of those two units does the actual recruiting.

equipment, for example, for clandestine raaio communication,

but tells agents what to procure and lets them make their own
purchases in their home countries with funds supplied by the
operational department directing them, Ay the main technical
department of the DGI, MI has most of the directorate's tech-
nical equipment. which it services and repairs in its own es-

Headquarters Comments .

The DGI was probably established in the general reorganization
of Cuban intelligence services begun with the establishment of
the Ministry of Enterior in June L9Gl and continued fer several
months thereafter. At Chat Cime all Cuban tntelligence agencies
were put under the new civilian ministry. and the former G-2
overall intelligence organization, which under military con-
trol, -also was civilfanized as the Department of State Security
(SE). The internal and exter intelligence services were ap-
parently separated at that time: previously they had both been
handled by G-2.

Other aspects of the DGI such as operations will be discussed
in subsequent reports.

Ramiro VALDES has been head. of Cuban intelligence since 1959;
before June 1961 he was head of G-2. but with the establishment

of the Ministry of Interior he was appointed minister, He has:
continued to devote special attention to intelligence activities

in that capacity.

PINEIRO is an experienced intelligence officer, asscciated with
Cuban foreignintelligence since 1959.

This number is not Listed in the Iiabana 1962 telephone directory,

DGI officers are normally Known by psScudonyms rather than true
names, As a result, source knew many of his colleagues only by
pseudonym and never heard their true names. Ranon Cesar CUENCA
Montoto, a section chici in the Lllegal Department, is known by
true name and apparently does not have a pseudonym, and PINEIRO
is known by true name.

“CHAIN is probably Army Captain Carlos Sixto CHAIN Soler. an Iintel-.

ligence officer who served in Wa fs
the Cuban Mission to the Organization of American States in 1961
and carly 1962; the mission was withdrawn in carly 1962,

Source had no informatjon about Soviet operations in Latin
America.

The Soviet Bloc countries with which Cuba maintains relations are:

Europe: Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary,
Poland, Rumania, the USSR, and Yugo: ia. i

Asia: Communist China, Mongolia, North Korea, and North Vietnam,

The non-Bloc countries with which Cuba maintains diplomatic rela-

tions are:

relations with Cuba until mid-May 1964, broke
them following the ousting of GOULART and the
change of government in Apr 41 1964,

The only regular air connection between Cuba and the Western
Hemisphere. is the schedule maintained by the official Cuban aire
line, Cubana (Empresa Consolidada Cubana de Aviacion - ECCA),
two or three times a week to Mexico. There are also charter
flights to Canada, but they are principally for cargo.

Agent activities in Latin America will be discussed in subse- :
quent reports.
