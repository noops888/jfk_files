Argentine newspaper, with

material for publication.

We had no Information to furnish CIA upon receipt of

their request and initlated inquiry to identify subject.

Inasmuch

furnishing same to CIA for passage to their source..

we are requesting them to furnish us with any additional data they

develop it is considered desirable to allow CIA to furnish this

material to their sources rather than Legat. In this manner

we will be assured

that the source who is apparently in a position

to know of subject's association with "Pregon" will have the results

of our inquiry.

Legat, however, should and is being alerted to in
