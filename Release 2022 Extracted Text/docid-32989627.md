Interview of Donald E. Moore by
Mr. Lech Johnson, Senate Select Committee
July 28, 1975

Mr. Johnson stated at the outset that this was an informal
interview and he did not place me under oath. He asked about my
background which was provided him and included the fact that I

served in the FBI from March 10, 1941, until my retirement at
the end of June 1973.

The interview concerned the so-called Huston Committee
and he asked if [knew Tom Charles Huston before the Committee
was established. I said I recalled meeting Huston once, in Bill
Sullivan's office, but I didn't recall when this was, but it was before
the Committee was formed. In response to questions, Mr. Johnson
svas informed as follows:

I was aware of the meeting at the White House attended by
Director Hoover, Mr. Helms, Admiral Gayler and Gen. Benneii.
I was probably aware the meeting was to take place before the
meeting date but I can't recall this. (He said the meeting was
held June 5, 1970.) Iwas not at a meeting held in Mr. Hoover's
office June 8 but I recall hearing about the meeting, probably
from Bill Sullivan. I don't recall a meeting held in the Domestic
Intelligence Division after this at which Sullivan, Bill Cregar,
George Moore, Fred Cassidy arid I were present. I did attend the
initial meeting of the Working Group headed by Sullivan and was
present because Sullivan asked me to be there. I remember Sullivan
and Cregar were at the meeting and I thought one or more other FBI
representatives were present. He mentioned George Moore and
Fred Cassidy were at the meeting.

I recall Mr. Helms and Mr. Angleton from,CIA were present
but did not recall the names of others including the representatives
from NSA, DIA and the military services. I recall Sullivan chaired
the meeting and that Huston sat at the opposite end of the table.
Either Helms or Sullivan announced that Helms probably couldn't
stay for the entire meeting but I don't recall Helms leaving, although
he did not sit directly at the conference table.

NW 65360 Docld:32989627 Page 18 : Sauer sae

I can't recall the conversation at the meeting but think that
Sullivan outlined the request of the President to study means of
getting better intelligence information on new left activities and
violent protest movements in the US, especially with regard to
possible foreign support. I think Sullivan probably outlined areas
of concern and asked representatives present to document where they
felt intelligence was lacking, how it could be obtained, who should
obtain it and what was needed to obtain it. I said I couldn't at this
date recall specific observations or proposals and rather believed
the purpose of the meeting was to outline the general problem and
ask the representatives to document these and come in with specific
recommendations at a subsequent meeting. Iam certain Mr. Huston
spoke about the purpose of the meeting but I can't recall his comments,

This was the only meeting of the Working Group I attended.
Itold Mr. Suilivan that if agreeable with him I would not attend
subsequent meetings and I thought the FBI had several representatives
present and that the thrust was on new left and related activities. As
I recall he said "suit yourself." Johnson pressed me on this and I
told him this was what I expressed to Sullivan but I also was somewhat
uneasy after the first meeting as I did not believe Mr. Hoover was
aware of collection efforts that were likely to be recommended. I
could not state what FBI members attended subsequent meetings but
I believe Charles Brennan and Bill Cregar, and of course, Bill
Sullivan, attended as well as some other representatives.

I can't say who drafted the report but was sure it was under
Sullivan's direction. During the period of the meetings Deke DeLoach
had retired and Sullivan had been appointed Assistant to the Director
and moved from the 9th & D Building to the Justice Building. 1
don't recall when Mr. Hoover's objections to certain of the
recommendations were added.. I can't say whether I saw the report
prior to the objections being in it but may have; I do recall seeing
the report after the objections were in it. I don't know whether
Mr. Hoover told Sullivan to put the objections in it but presume
Sullivan knew Mr. Hoover's views and put the objections in on this
basis. I could not answer the question as to whether Mr. Tolson
was the person responsible for having the objections made but felt
he would have objected to the initial recommendations.



[ @ @

I did see the letter from the White House saying the report
had been approved. I believe it was signed by Huston and stated
the President had approved the recommendations, I was aware
Mr. Hoover had either written or seen Attorney General Mitchell
expressing his reluctance and was aware the White House letter was
withdrawn. I din't know why it was withdrawn other than this
occurred after Mr. Hoover went to the Attorney General.

Mr. Johnson asked certain specific questions during or
after the above discussion. He asked what covert mail coverage
was involved since CIA in 1970 was engaged in covert mail inter-
ception. After checking with Mr. Leon F. Schwartz of the FBI,
Mr. Johnson was advised that while I had been released from my
pledge of confidentiality by the FBI in general with regard to the
Huston Committee this matter was under review by the Department
of Justice and I had not been released from my pledge on this

‘aspect. A similar answer was given to the question about what

was meant by the removal of restrictions on the use of surreptitious
entry of embassies io obiain cryptographic maieriais.

Mr. Johnson asked if I thought the Huston Committee had
been instigated by Bill Sullivan to more or less force Mr. Hoover
to take a more aggressive stance in intelligence collection. I
answered that I would not like to speculate on this and I could not
make a definite statement yes or no.

’

He asked why the Working Group met at CIA as opposed to
the FBI and whether this had special meaning. I answered that I
did not think so, that the US Intelligence Board was headed by the
Director of CIA, was concerned with intelligence collection and
met at CIA and also meeting arrangements could probably be better
arranged at CIA in view of parking, conference rooms, etc.

He said Admiral Gayler had stated that he and his predecessor,
Gen. Carter, had tried to get Mr. Hoover to provide more support to
NSA with regard to Communications Intelligence and asked if I was
aware of any such efforts, and if they were in person or in writing.
I said I was aware that Gen. Carter and Adm. Gayler had asked for
support and I believe they might have seen Mr. Hoover personally
and perhaps had written him.

Mr. Callahan requested that a research be conducted to
determine whether the FBI or the Department of Justice would be
authorized to pay for private counsel for employees called to testify
before the Senate Select Committee and who desired private counsel.

I advised Mr. Callahan that the position of the FBI and the
Department is that we could not provide counsdidirectly to the individuals
because of the potential conflict of interest between the rights of the
individual and the duties of our officers. However, I told him that to my
knowledge the question concerning whether the Government ceuld pay for
private counsel selected by the employee has not been researched.

Mr. Callahan therefore requested that the research be conducted.

RECOMMENDATION: “

That the Administrative Division and Legal Counsel confer
and prepare an appropriate response to Mr. Callahans request.

also undertaken to present the statutory considerations
governing the provision of such representation in a legal

This statutory prohibition makes it clear that

viously does not have authority to do that which is
denied to Executive departments which are otherwise Room

Memorandum to Mr. J. B. Adams
Re: Authority of FBI and Department of Justice
to Retain Private Counsel to Represent Employees

An examination of our budgetary language by
representatives of the Administrative Division and this
Division does not disclose any explicit or implicit
authority which would qualify as "otherwise authorized by
law, . . ." under the above statute. The statutory
authority for provision of private counsel is contained in
Title28, United States Code, Section 515, which gives the
Attorney General the authority to appoint and pay special
attorneys. However, this authority is circumscribed by the
statement that these attorneys “may, when specifically
directed by the Attorney General, conduct any kind of legal
proceeding, civil or criminal, including grand jury pro-
ceedings and proceedings before committing magistrates,
which United States Attorneys are authorized by law to
conduct. . .." It is evident then that this authority
jpertains only to proceedings held within the judicial
system, not to hearings held before a legislative body.
Such a hearing is not a “legal proceeding" and is not
one "which United States Attorneys are authorized by
law to conduct. .. ."

In the event that employees need representation
in a legal proceeding and the Department believes that a
potential conflict of interest would prevent it from
providing counsel, outside counsel could be appointed and
paid under the statute up to the monetary limits fixed.
Whether the Department would allow the individual employee
to designate or select the outside counsel would be a
matter of Departmental policy but we see no reason why
such an individual selection would not ordinarily be
approved.

We are aware that the Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA) has recently engaged the law firm of Arnold
and Porter and that Mr. Mitchell Rogovin of that firm
has been designated as the individual attorney to represent
that agency. Inquiry with CIA has determined that the
authority relied on for this action is Title 50, United
States Code, Section 403j, which states:

Memorandum to Mr. J. B. Adams
Re: Authority of FBI and Department of Justice
to Retain Private Counsel to Represent Employees

"(a) Notwithstanding any other
other provisions of law, sums
made available to the Agency
by appropriation or otherwise
may be expended for purposes
necessary to carry out its
functions, including --

"(1) personal services, including
personal services without regard
to limitations on types of
persons to be employed... ."

ap would emphasize, however, that the counsel
hired, repre ents the CIA, not individual employees, and
that private counsel has the same problems as does their
"in-house" counsel. Therefore, no firm or individual
hired by that agency can provide counsel to the individual
employee in any situation which presents a potential
conflict between the interests of the individual and the
interests of the agency.

CONCLUSION:

We_conclude that +t] no authority for either
the FBI or the Department to pay ‘for private counsel
Selected by employees called to testify before | before the : Senate,

elect Committee or 3 any other ‘leg Slative body. If an
f employee called to testify in such a forum déSires private
counsel, or where a potential conflict of interest makes
representation by "in-house" counsel or the Department
impossible, the employee must decide if the possible
consequences warrant the personal expense of such counsel
and, if so, responsibility for payment rests with him.

Furthermore, private counsel retained by an
agency having authority to do so would be under the
same disabilities as "in-house" or Departmental counsel
in situations presenting a potential conflict of interest.

Supervisor S, F. Phillips of the Senstudy 75 Project
was in- Atlanta 7/22/75 in connection with the interviews there
of six SAs (five from Atlanta FO; one who traveled to Atlanta
from Knoxville FO) by SSC Staff Members Michael Epstein and
Mary DeOreo. Interviews concerned the former FBI investigation
of Martin Luther King, Jr. At approximately 5:00 p.m.,
7/22/75, Epstein telephonically contacted Phillips and advised
that one of the interviews developed information resulting in
his desire to interview a seventh SA, Edward A, Shea of the
Atlanta FO. In order to avoid another trip to Atlanta,
Epstein asked if Phillips could obtain FBI clearance for -the
interview which would concern: (1) any possible COINTELPRO
operations in Atlanta with respect to King or the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC); (2) Shea's assignment
to a "file review or file rettieval" project during past year
concerning COINTELPRO; and (3) concerning COINTELPRO "generally."
(It should be noted that earlier this year, Shea handled a
project relating to classifying documents in Atlanta files
regarding COINTELPRO. Shea aivised.Phillips of this and also
said that he does not recall seeing any documents regarding
COINTELPRO/SCLC - KING.) Epstein desired to interview Shea
the morning of 7/23/75.

Re: Senstudy 75
62-116395

On basis of foregoing request, Phillips
telephonically contacted Assistant Director (AD) Mintz
who granted clearance for (1) and (2) above and suggested
withholding clearance on (3) pending further request from
Epstein after interview on items (1) and (2), Mintz asked
that Phillips touch base with AD Wannall for his concurrence.
In the absence of Wannall who was out of the building,
Deputy AD T+ Leavitt concurred with Mintz, At about 5:30 p.m.,
7/22/75, Epstein was telephonically advised by Phillips as
indicated above--clearance for (1) and (2); not for (3) at
this time. Arrangements were then made for interview of
Shea morning of 7/23/75.

Subsequent interview of Shea (being reported
separately) apparently satisfied Epstein and it does not
appear there will be any further request as to item (3).

(SSC) dated 6/27/75, pursuant to instructions of the
Deputy Attorney General, until such time as the Department
ean obtain clarification from the SSC regarding the meaning

Memorandum Wannall to Adams, dated 6/30/75, reviewed
a draft copy of the SSC's letter to the Department. This
draft copy is dated 6/25/75, It is identical in content with
the final version dated 6/27/75.

Memorandum Cregar to Wannall, dated 7/2/75, reported
the results of a meeting in the office of the Deputy Attorney
General on the morning of 7/2/75. In this memorandum it was
pointed out that the Deputy Attorney General found considerablé
difficulty in understanding paragraph 2 of the SSC's draft of
a letter dated 6/25/75. He noted that in view of the
ambiguities found in the letter, as well as the lack of any
specific agreement entered into with the SSC by the Department
and/or the FBI, the Department should prepare a letter over
the Attorney General's signature asking for clarification.

In the meantime, the Deputy Attorney General advised that we
should take no action responsive to the requests levied on

the FBI in this letter, To date, we have received no infor-
mation from the Department that a letter asking for clarification

of the SSC has been sent.

The response should include all relevant underlying docu-
mentation and other information, including documents

which may not have come to the Committes's attention and
which the Committee has not specifically requested, and

all material relating to any prior Executive Branch inquiry
into the matter. In addition, we would welcome a current
analysis of the particular questions raised by the Commit-
tee and any other observations on the eee eee ihe KENE poe
believe -would be helpful. F LEGISL

We welcome the promise of enor

The Honérable Edward H. Levi

Page Two - "June 27, 1975 °

Within the Committee mandate, contained in
S. Res. 21, there are four broad subjects relating to the
intelligence community which we are required to investi-
gate and study in order to determine the facts and ulti-
mately to. decide whether to make recommendations for
legislative or other changes. They are:

1. _The structure, performance, and utility of
_government operations with respect to intel-
ligence activities.

2. Whether certain policies or practices are
. or are not illegal, unethical, or otherwise
improper.

3. ‘Whether there has or has not been excessive
duplication or inadequate coordination be-
tween and among intelligence agencies and,
more generally, the efficiency of intelli-
gence activities.

4, Whether there has or has not been adequate
internal and external control and oversight
over the policies and practices of intelli-

_gence agencies.

In attempting to find the answers to these funda-
mental questions, the Committee is proceeding in two ways.
First, we are examining intelligence functions broadly as
instruments of government policy, giving attention to the
authority for particular functions, the problems which
intelligence activities are designed to solve, the proce+
dures by which intelligence activities are and have been
proposed, approved, executed, evaluated, arid terminated,
the range and scope of the activities utilized to achieve
intelligence objectives, and the propriety and utility of
the activities undertaken. Second, we will examine in
depth certain subjects within the broad topics of inves-
tigation. (We would, of course, welcome your suggestion
of other cases that would give added insight into intelli-
gence matters under your jurisdiction.) These specific

- Subjects for investigation are not intended to limit the

scope contained in the more general questions.

I. Issues

The Committee's inquiry into the intelligence and
counterintelligence activities of the Federal Bureau
of Investigation is examining fundamental issues which
bear directly on the gdequacy of current legislation
and administrative organization and procedure. The
Comnittee seeks to determine whether FBI intelligence
and, counterintelligence activities achieve legitimate
objectives in conformity with the rule of law. Among
the basic issues to be addressed are the following:

“A. What is the legal authority for FBI intelligence |
- and counterintelligence activities? Should the
FBI's authority be clarified or revised or
Re incorporated in a comprehensive statutory
eharter?

. B. What limitations are Placed on FBI intelligence
and counterintelligence activities by the
Constitution and laws of the United States?
Should these limitations be clarified or
revised?

C€. What have been the purposes and aims of FBI
intelligence and counterintelligence activities?
Should these cbjéctives be modified? »

D. How have the intelligence and counterintelligence
activities of the FBI been organized and coordinated
with other agencies of government? Should these
procedures and practices be revised?

E. What have been the procedures for and techniques
of intelligence gathering and dissemination and
counterintelligence operations used by the FBI?
Under what conditions and through what procedures
should these methods and techniques’be used in
the future?

F. What have been and should.be the mechanisms for
internal and external policy-making, control,
and supervision of FBI intelligence and counter-
intelligence activities?

As a means of examining the above issues in the

others of which involve specific cases, programs

or techniques. Part II, below, contains descriptions
of the general areas into which the Committee: intends
to inquire. Part III contains descriptions: of the
specific cases mentioned above. The descriptions
specifically indicate whether the investigation may
concentrate on specific allegations of possible
abuses or other controversial matters where there
is.reason to believe improprieties may have occurred.
In dddition to the topics described below, additional
areas of inquiry may develop during the course of the

Areas of General Inquiry

A.

-Legal Authority. for FBI Intelligence and Counter-
intelligence Activities

The Committee is examining the legal basis for FBI
intelligence and counterintelligence activities.
There may be serious question as to the adequacy
of the present legislative framework for the FBI's
functions in these fields. Current statutes
authorize the FBI to perform investigative and law
enforcement functions, but they do not specifically
authorize intelligence or counterintelligence
‘activities. Therefore, the Committee seeks to
determine whether the FBI's authority should be
elarified, revised, or incorporated in a compre-
hensive statutory charter. 7

Responsible staff: Senior staff
Task Force leader
Mark Gitenstein

Organization and Operation of the FBI Intelli-
gence Division ~ -

The Committee is investigating the structure and
operating practices of the FBI Intelligence Divi-
sion. Proposals have been made that the national
security intelligence and counterintelligence
functions of the FBI should be lodged in a separate
agency or otherwise separated from the FBI's
criminal investigative activities. Further recom-
mendations have been advanced for improved coordina-~
tion between the FBI and other intelligence agencies,
‘for strengthened supervision of FBI intelligence and
counterintelligence activities by the Attorney
General or an independent board, and for clearer
standards and procedures for FBI activities in this
grea. Therefore, the Committee desires complete
information on the operating practices and proce-
dures of the FBI Intelligence Division and of the
field office activities supervised by the Intelli-
gence Division.

tion between the FBI and other agencies in the

occasions in the past where friction ‘between
the FBI and other agencies has produced serious

FBI Foreign Counterintelligence Operations

The Committée seeks to determine the nature of
FBI counterintelligence operations directed at
foreign intelligence activities within the

United States or at any other hostile foreign-
related activities within the United States.
Since FBI operations to "counter" these activi-
ties go beyond intelligence collection, the
Committee must consider whether such practices
require statutory authorization. The impact ,
of counterintelligence operations on United
States foreign relations will also be considered..

Inspection Division Investigations

The Committee is examining the relationship

of the FBI Inspection Division to FBI intelli-
gence and counterintelligence activities. This
includes both regular Inspection.Division
reviews of Intelligence Division and field
office functions and specific investigations

of allegations of improper conduct in connec-

tion. with FBI intelligence activities.

5. FBI Intelligence Activities and State or Local |
Law Enforcement Agencies

The Committee seeks to determine the nature of
the relationships between FBI intelligence
. activities and state and local law enforcement
agencies. This subject involves the delicate
balance between the, necessary ccntralization
of certain law enforcement activities and the
Constitutionally-mandated decentralization of
general law enforcement responsibility. It is
- necessary for the Committee to evaluate the
centralizing influence of the FBI, as well as

General Questions

The descriptions which follow of the specific cases the
Committee intends to study are,intended to serve the
dual purpose of notifying the FBI of the issues the
Committee will explore in connection with each case

and eliciting from the FBI all information and material
in: its possession relating to the questions the Committee
wishes to explore in each case. In order to avoid
unnecessary repetition of certain questions which will
be basic to the Committee's investigations of each
case, certain fundamental questions are set forth
below. As-to each case described, the Committee
intends to explore these fundamental.questions, and
expects that the FBI will, as to each case, provide

all information and material it has relating to these
basic questions even though they are not repeated in
the discussion of each particular area.

1. What is or has been the legal authority for the
activity? 7 :

.2. What have been thé purposes of the activity?
3. What techniques have been employed in the activity?

4, What kinds of information have been” gathered in
the activity?

5. How have specific uses of the activity been initiated
and approved?

6. How have the targets for the activity been selected?
7- What have been the criteria for target selection?

8. iow has the intelligence which is collected been
used?

9. To whom has the intelligence collected been dis-
seminated?

10. What has been the basis for any dissemination with
respect to.each recipient?

11. How has the activity been coordinated with other
intelligence agencies?

Electronic Surveillance

The Committee is examining all forms of electronic
interception of communications including wiretap-
ping, electronic eavesdropping, consensual elec
tronic surveillance interception of video and data
communications, local monitoring devices, and all
other forms of electronic or technical monitoring.
The Committee's general questions apply to each of
the techniques listed above, as well as to the
matters set forth in the following specific cases.

“1. Warrantless Electronic Surveillance

The Committee seeks to determine whether the
Attorney General should have the authority
to authorize electronic surveillance for cer-
tain purposes without a prior judicial warrant.
7 This power has been exercised by succeeding
Attorneys General since 1940, upon the explicit
directive of the President. The Supreme Court
has ruled that this power does not extend to
purely domestic matters, but the remaining scope
of the Attorney General's authority remains un-
defined by the Supreme Court. oes

Questions
The Committee requests that the FBI and the

Justice Department address the following specific
questions:

a. What is the scope and basis of the claim
of Executive authority to conduct warrant-
less electronic surveillance?

“ b. What have been the procedures for considera-
tion and approval of reauests for warrantless
electronic surveillance authorized by the
Attorney General?

ce. What are the specific disadvantages of the
judicial warrant requirement for those
electronic surveillances which have been
authorized by the Attorney General?

se og dad. Does the Fourth Amendment permit the
: issuance of judicial warrants for elec-—
tronic surveillance on grounds other than
ordinary probable cause where national
security intelligence purposes are advanced
to justify the surveillance?

e. To what extent are the specific procedures
of Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control
‘ Act of 1968 inappropriate for electronic
surveillance conducted for national secu~
rity intelligence purposes?

ig Documents

The Committee requests the following additional
.” documents bearing on the questions stated above:

7 ~ a All written justifications for the specific
: authorizations by the Attorney General for
warrantless electronic surveillance from
January 1, 1960, until the present.

b. All documents reflecting the denial by the
Attorney General of specific requests for
warrantless electronic surveillance from
January 1, 1960, until the present.

ce. Committee staff access toinformation con-
tained in the impounded documents, deposi~
tions, and other materials in all pending
civil suits which involve warrantless

. 2. Warrantless Electronic Surveillance and
ae "Teaks*

“The Committee is examining several instances of
the use of warrantless electronic surveillance
and other investigative’ techniques in connection
with "leaks" of classified information. These
‘cases may involve specific allegations of abuse
or other controversial matters where there is

F. Clandestine Informant Activities

The Committee is examining all aspects of the
FBI's use of informants, sources, and undercover
personnel and the techniques employed by such per-
sons. Although informants are the single most
productive source of intelligence information, the
aifficulties of controlling their activities may
increase the possibility of improper conduct. The
use of informants to infiltrate organizations also
may pose dangers to the right of associational pri-
vacy. Consequently, proposals have been made for
,the imposition of a judicial warrant requirement
° ‘or other safeguards for the use of informants.
The Committee seeks to evaluate such proposals as
well as the contributions of informants to the
r accomplishment of legitimate objectives.

.

_ In addition, the Committee is examining informant

j &ctivities with respect to several particular situa-

| tions and cases. This investigation may involve
“specific allegations of abuse or controversial
matters where there is reason to believe improprie-
ties may have occurred. The Committee's inquiry

‘ _covers the general circumstances surrounding the
| : following incidents or cases:

a. Wounded Knee;
b. Kent State;
‘ec. > New York v. Stroble (Attica);

d. United States v. Buckalew (Gainesville);

e. United States v. Briggs (Camden);

f. New York v. Dillon (Hobart College);

g- United States v. Marshall (Seattle).
Additional cases may also be examined.

In addition to the above cases, the Committee is
.examining the role of FBI informants in providing

information to the FBI concerning members of the
following organizations:

The Committee is examining the FBI's role in the

“disposition of .the report of the Interagency Com-
mittee on Intelligence (Ad Hoc) in 1970. This

"illegal". It purported to represent the joint
recommendations of all members of the U. S. intel-
ligence community, but FBI Director J. Edgar

Hoover disagreed in a series of footnotes.

The serious consideration given to such al-.

__ iegedly illegal proposals gives this case

I believe that the answers to these questions~
are e sential to a complete und tanding of the policies
and y -ocedures followed the Justice Department in elec-
tron c surveillance cases. Full-information on these mat~
ters is necessary for the Committee to fulfill its mandate
"to cecommend the enactment of any new legislation...

‘nece csary or desirable .to strengthen or clarify the national
security, intelligence, or surveillance activities of the

United States and to protect the hts of United States
citizens with regard to these activities." With the con-
tinued cooperation of the Justice Department, I am convinced
that the Committee. will be able to discharge this respon- —
sibility in the critical area of national security electronic
surveillance. ry

developing general information Fegarding the handling of
informant files within the FBI by Mr. John T. ELLiff and
Mr. Mark Gitenstein of the Domestic Intelligence Task Force
U. 5. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities.
The interview was conducted on 8/4/75 in FBI space and
lasted from approximately 2:00 p.m. until 2:30 p.m.

The interview was extremely general in nature and a
dealt exclusively with general information regarding the
handling of informant files both in the field and at FBIHQ.
The questions asked dealt with such matters as what type of
files were maintained in the field and at FBIHQ regarding
informants and generally the types of information contained
therein. They were particularly interested as to whether or
not an individual informant file either at FBIHQ or in the
field would contain information which would specifically
identify informants other than the informant on which the
file was maintained. They also inquired whether or not there-
was a sub A section of each informant file maintained at FBIHQ
as was the case in the field. Questions were also asked as to
whether or not the individual file maintained at FBIHQ on
informants would run into several volumes. This inquiry was
answered to the effect that the size of the file cD

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: Senstudy

It was readily apparent that they were asking these
questions with the thought in mind of requesting access to
certain informant files, the identity of which they already
had but did not divulge. They did state specifically that
the informant files in which they would have an interest
amounted to approximately ten and were all on informants
that had publicly beén exposed for one reason or another
and were no longer being operated as current informants.

The indication was that the request would be for access
only to such files for review in FBI space.

On 8/6/75, Daniel M. (Mac) Armstrong, ILI, who was
on the personal staff of former Acting Director Gray, called to advise
that he had been contacted by John Elliff. He had known Elliff casually.
during the confirmation hearings regarding Mr. Gray. EILiff told him.

which were: (1) the decision to abolish the Crime Records Division;
(2) the Legal Attache program.

Armstrong told him that he had no knowledge concerning the ’
Crime Records Division and had not even learned of its abolishment until ~
after the fact. Armstrong referred Elliff to Dave Kinley regarding that
topic. Armstrong said that Elliff did not want to talk to him concerning the ff
Legal Attache program over the phone and said he would contact him in nef, yY
near future for an appointment to see him personally. =

1. In our discussions preparatory to the briefing t to
be given to Senators Church and Tower, we have agreed to try
to avoid identifying specific foreign targets of the various ay
types of operations which will be discussed, although it was -
generally recognized that it would be impossible to avoid \s a
discussing the Soviet target specifically. I have recently !
learned that the SSC Staff is aware of the fact (from materia!
turned over to them by CIA) that CIA "participated in a serie:
of electronic surveillance operations in the U.S." The infoy- G
mation is contained in a single paragraph, which goes on to;
say:

fy

JEK Act 5 (g)(2){(D)
2. This being so, it can be expected that the Staff will
have brought this information to the senators' attention, and
I will be prepared to respond factually to questions with re-
spect to these operations, which of course were carried out in
pursuit of NSA requirements, and with FBI coordination and/or, Lm x53

On July 31, 1975, Mr, Dan Dwyer, Research Assistant, — Pwectersee'y—
Senate Select Committee, advised SA-SeymorF. Phillips that he
had some specific questions to ask concerning his review of. the :
Classifying Guide, Files and Communications Division. Thereafter, 4
“Stpervisor Paul Fl Shea and Classifying turt’ Supervisor Odell
Wheeler answered the following questions raised by Mr. Dwyer:
(1) Explain the difference in applicant mail categories, i.e.
67, 77, 116, 151 and 161? The various applicant type categories
were discussed with him. (2) What is the difference between
main files, general files and setup files? ‘These definitions were
given to him in accordance with the manual; in addition, our pro-
cedures for handling "0" files, "00" files and subfiles were also . g
explained. (3) When is a 62 file interchangeable? It was explained
to him that the 62 classification is interchangeable with other &
designated classifications, for example, that incoming 62 material
could be placed in an existing file on the subject rather than
opening a separate 62 file. (4%) Describe what you mean by the

standard sublist. It was explained that a subnumber is assigned (ea
to each one of our field offices and to each foreign country; that,
subfiles are, used when it is anticipated that the volume of mail o

will be sufficient to place the file in separate subs for future

ready reference to a particular area or locality. (5) What is

the meaning of the character of a case? It was explained that we

have utilized 185 classification numbers to date and that each of
these classifications has a corresponding character. The example
given was the 26 classification and corresponding IISMV character. (s)
(6) What is meant by the[134\ classification being interchangeable
with the subvetsive list? It was explained to him that from the

185 classifications approximately 60 of these are termed subversive

from an administrative standpoint. Thefi34|classification which >)
designates a fSecurity informant] is interchangeable with certain ‘>
subversive classifications on the subversive list.

WITH RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

NOTE:

Reference is made to Legal Counsel memorandum to

the request of Mr. Johnson is set forth as well as the approved |
release of Messrs, Smith and Cotter from their employment |
agreement as it relates to the "Huston Plan." On 8/4/75 |
Special Agent Thomas J. NcNiff attempted to contact Mr. Smith |
at his home phone 301-262-1921. An adult female answered and

information which might adversely affect on-going FBI investigations
and information which originated with other agencies, including
foreign intelligence agencies. Mr. Cotter concluded by saying

that upon being contacted by the SSC ‘he would advise this Bureau

whether or not he would request that a Bureau Agent be made
available for consultation.

SUBJECT: Proposed Procedures - SSC ‘ [Telephone Rm. —

[Director Sec'y — |

This dreft of , "Proposed Procedues" has ‘not been discussed
with SSC staff. It is intended to reflect the substance of the
discussion had on 7/21, in your office; and incorporates (as
underscored) additional language for the purposes suggested by
that discussion. Also reflected are the slight editorial changes
requested by the SSC in the draft attached to Senator Church's
letter of July 18, 1975.

These piocedumes are designed to permit bisad access for .
SSC staff to FBI materials at the FBI, or delivery of such materials,
if appropriate, to the SSC. The present scope of the access is
defined by the requests as received; those extant are the subject
of superseding redraft under paragraph 1. The prospective scope of
requested information is not restricted, but is subject to negotiation
as indicated in the amendment to paregraph 1.

The proposed modification of paragraph 3 will be the focus of
most controversy. The SSC will probably object to the  withhol ding
of sources under paragraph 3(d) (proposed) saying that access to
information at the FBI offices is all that is required; that no
note on such documents can be removed from the premises of the FBI
under procedure 6; and that if they wish to pursue any sources,
the appeal]. provision of existing paregraph 6 should cover it.

Since that was the purpose of paragraph 6, and since paragraph 6(a)
was designed to focus on any real problem which might arise, the
scope of the stated problem under paragraph 3(d) may be seen by the
SSC as an attempt to withhold information from the SSC staff, and
delay the inquiry (since the Bureau would have to do considerable pre

delivery work under 3(d) to make properly defined and reviewed
deletions). Accordingly, I would expect SSC to assert (a) DOJ
does not trust SSC probity or security, and (b) DOJ is following
a dilatory and unnecessary tactic.

In anticipation of ‘these problems, I have re-written
paragraph 9 to permit unilateral abrogation if the procedures
do not work. If actual information withheld is. capriciously
defined, or if any lapse of good judgment occurs, I would expect
prompt abrogation by SSC and a very severe criticism of the

. Director, the Attorney General, and the Department.

I think that is a high nisk, and assumption of it places
a very heavy burden upon the Bureau, aan and upon the
Department, ultimately.

My recommendation is that the proposed procedures be
attempted as redrafted, subject to Attorney General and White
House approval; but a vigorous caveat is indicated as to the
need for real restraint in the exercise of initial FBI discretion
under paragraph 3(d).

PROPOSED PROCEDURES

(1) The Domestic Task Force Leader* will submit periodically a list

of specific materials, relevant to the inquiry being conducted under

S.R. 21, to which the Committee staff wishes access or of which the

dure to be followed shall be proposed, defined, adopted, and

* followed after consideration by the SSC of the specific exemption,
and pertinent inquiry and discussion _at the staff level.

(2) The following procedures shall apply (a) where delivery of
materials requested might jeopardize FBI sensitive sources or’

requests access to materials, rather than delivery to the SSC.
(3) The Departinent will furnish access at the Hoover Building in
Room 4171 to these materials requested:

" informant has already been made known to the Committee, or unless the
Attorney Generel, the Chairman and Vice Chairman, jointly agree on the
limited disclosure of such identities to the Chairman and Vice Chairman.

(d) An exception to (a) and (b) above is mide for information which

would identify persons > as sources, who have provided or continue to
provide information to the FBI, and_as to whose identity the FBI has

undertaken an obligation of confidentiality. In order to preserve

that obligation of confidentiality, the FBI will withhold access to

this class of information, unless the identity of the individual as

a source has already been made known to the Committee, or unless the

Attorney General, the Chairman and Vice Chaimman, jointly agree on ~
the limited disclosure of such identities to the Chainnan and Vice

Epstein ‘kept pressing ‘me wit rasants you think

the former I replied "not necessarily," and to the latter I
said a possible reason could have been that Bureau offi¢iais

: “Epstein gave me no explanation as “to hers he .
: obtained the names that he specifically mentioned te me. It
| .., appeared to be his desire-te conduct a thorough interview and

i to clear up eonfusion in his mind, possibly caused by eonflicting :

reports about the tapes. He and DeOreo were courteous and

stayed well within the legitimate bounds of the MLK investigation:

except as possibly indicated by his questions ‘concerning the
Makeup of the Re SEC. and its Units. While he did het state it
’ specifically, as such, it appeared to ine that he was trying to
detexmine how tape recordings resulting from microphone —— .

. Surveillances were handled in a Section which dealt with -redio
matters. He seemed satisfied when I told him that the work of
my. Unit came under the "Evidence Examinations" Unit, He -also
accepted my explanation of "security work" with the comment that
‘sueh sensitive wotk certainly was of a security nature. He
made no effort whatsoever to inquize es to what ‘further work.

I may have dong in the Section, :He specifically asked whether ~ -

' I had given any MLK information te Stevens, and I replied that
while I could not recall specifically, this was possible because
“Stevens and.1 worked closely together and he wold have had to.

Dear Mr, Attorney General:

\e

Thank you for your letter replying to our letter concerning
access by certain members of the Select Committee to files and
documents concerning them held by the Department, including the
FBI. :

The Committee has resolved to adopt a slightly different
procedure than that proposed in your letter. As you know, the
purpose of this particular request is to enable the members,
through analysis of materials relating to them, to obtain general
insights into how theDepartment of Justice, including the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, collects, maintains and retrieves ae eee
for itself material on Americans generally. Accordingly, we id
suggest that at a mutually convenient time, the designated members
come to the Department or the Bureau and physically go through
the retrieval process with the persons who would be responsible
for performing that function in a real life situation. The
Committee members do not wish to have their individual files 2
either removed from the filing system or "sanitized" prior to . Sy J &
their reviewing then. a eI + fp DOr am DV &

; Koy RES YRS 575

This proposed method of Omsite review may help, moreover,
to alleviate the possible problems of disclosure to the particular
members which your letter adverted to. We are sure that you
could discuss any remaining actual problems with the members
themselves at your premises, including whatever retrieval problems
may exist with respect to the letters from the members themselves ~

[18 1975

JUL

which you referred to. aerate
In the first instance, what the members seek is insight,
1 The attached letter was forwarded
: ‘to the Bureau by the Department. |.

and understanding. After the initial review, further steps to
record facts and reach conclusions can be agreed upon as
appropriate.

Senator Baker and Senator Philip Hart wish to be added to
the list of Senators who wish to exami es own files.

Re: Further Documents Pertaining To

Also enclosed is a copy of SAC memorandum 23-75
dated May 27, 1975, which is believed responsive to 5.e. This
particular SAC memorandum is being provided herewith, since,
in view of its recent date, it. was not included in the index
of SAC Letters and Memoranda previously made available to
the SSC Staff,

With regard to that portion of 5.¢,, above, concerning
"possible entrapment, provocation, interferenee with lawyer -
client relationship or other problems,"' ag it relates to
informant operation, there are no Bureau memoranda or other
material addressing these areas, as the same policy and
procedures applicable to Special Agent conduct regarding these
problems similarly apply to informants. ‘In response to your
general request under 4,b., above, FBI policy and procedures
concerning such matters are set forth in the Manval of
Instructions (MOI) and the Manval of Rules and Regulations (MRR),
which have already been made available to SSC Staff Members
pursuant to an earlier request and to the SAG Letters and
Memoranda which are being made available to SSC Staff personnel
for review pursuant to another request.

With respect to your request under Item 4.a., above,
no memoranda or other materials were Located relating to the
original decision to utilize informants in our investigations.

It is noted your requests under Item 5., Appendix A,
of referenced communication vere directed by you to both the
FBI and the U. 5. Department of Justice (DOJ). Our response
in this matter with respect to legal authority should therefore
be viewed in conjunction with any material you may have received

FROM, B. G. Donahue

segect: JLEGAL AUTHORITY OF THE FBI
TO USE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMANTS
As AN INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUE

The legal authority of the FBI to use confidential
informants as an investigative technique rests upon three factors:

1) Legislative authority embodied in the approval
of the annual appropriation.

2) Case law that the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth
Amendments do not protect a wrongdoer from
the use of informants. :

8) Case law reflecting that courts recognize the
necessity and utility of informants in providing
probabie cause fur making arrests without 2
warrant, and for obtaining warrants, provided
that certain conditions are met.

Regarding the first of the above-cited factors,
reference is made to the "Hearings Before a Subcommittee of the
Committee on Appropriations, House of Representatives, Departments |
of State, Justice and Commerce, the Judiciary and Related Agencies
Appropriations for 1974." ‘i ‘ : i
t r

Part I, page 783 of those hearings, sets forthrthe —
justification language for the 1974 budget estimate for FBI salaries

ae

and expenses. It is noted that this language is the same as Uged/th
ba previous years except for underlined and bracketed changes which
do not affect this subject. There is specific provision under the

INFORMANTS AS AN INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUE

heading of "Salaries and Expenses" for "expénses necessary for the.
detection and prosecution of crimes against the United States" and
more specifically for the "payment of rewards." i

At page 879 of these hearings, there is set forth
as part of the testimony on "Investigative Accomplishments, " a
paragraph detailing the statistics achieved by the use of confidential
informants. Since Congress has approved FBI appropriations without
objection to the use of money for "payment of rewards" or for the
informant achievements listed in the testimony, the approval of the
appropriations serves as one form of legislative approval for the
use of informants.

* The use of informants does not violate the defendant's
rights under the Fourth Saini Hoffa v. United States, 385
U.S. 293 (1966). eid erererearareeseemn hi arfsrciraearer

“Neither this Court, nor any member of it has
ever expressed the view that the Fourth Amend-
ment protects a wrongdoer's misplaced belief
that a person to whom he voluntarily confides
his wrongdoing will not reveal it. Indeed, the
Court unanimously rejected that very contention

--rin Lopez v. United States, 373 U.S, 427---"
Id. at 302

The Court also held that the use of an informer did
not violate Hoffa's rights under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments,

+ citing United States v. Dennis, 183 F.2d 201, 224, (1950), which
; Said,

"Courts have countenanced the use of informers
from time immemorial; in cases of conspiracy,
or in other cases when the crime consists of
preparing for another crime it is usually necessary
to rely upon them or upon accomplices because
{° the criminals will almost certainly proceed
"covertly."

| : Besides the explicit recognition reflected above of

[ “the right of investigative bodies to avail themselves of informants,
there are other Supreme Court cases which implicitly recognize
this right by regulating the conditions under which an informant's

- Ydentity need be revealed at trial. (Roviaro v. United States,

853 U.S. 53 (1957)), or the conditions to be met in using an

informant's information as the basis of probable cause for an

arrest without a warrant. (Draper v, United States, 358 U.S, 307

(1959); McCray v. Dlinois, 385 U.S. 300 (1967)). Similarly,

the Supreme Court has recognized that informant information may

. form the basis for a warrant application, provided the affidavit

. shows the underlying circumstances which would give reason to

believe the informant is credible, and cir cumstances showing

UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

" FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

‘WASHINGTON, D.C. 20535 ,

May 27, 1975

MEMORANDUM TO ALL SPECIAL AGENTS IN CHARGE:

(A) INFORMANT MATTERS - DEFENSE PLANS AND STRATEGY --
Recently there have been several instances where attorneys in connection
with law suits have publicly and erroneously alleged that the FBI utilized
informants to uncover defense plans and strategy. Also, recently'a former
informant falsely alleged that informant's services were utilized by the
-Bureau to infiltrate a defense camp. These accusations reemphasize the
need for the careful and professional handling of informants at all times.

As you are aware under current policy, informants are advised
to avoid becoming involved in defense plans or strategy in subversive-type
cases or with anyone under criminal indictment. It is the responsibility
of all Speciai Agents handling informants to insure that their informants
are continually alert so that they wiii avoid becoming invoived in defense -
matters and in the event an informant is requested to assist or partake in
such matters, that the contacting Agent is immediately advised so that the
matter will be recorded. Ii the inivrmaut cannot avoid being involved,
informant is not to report any information pertaining to defense plans or
strategy and such incident must be promptly reported to the Bureau under
the substantive case caption.

2 In view of the above, the statement of cooperation normally
signed by security and extremist informants is being amended to incorporate
current policy regarding defense plans and strategy. Where it is not required
as in criminal informant cases or it has not been practical to obtain a state- -
ment of cooperation, each handling Agent must orally advise the informant
of the above, reduce it to writing, and record it in the informant's file. Insure
that all pending informant files reflect the above as a matter of record.

Manual changes follow.

This document is prepared tn response t6 your request and is not,for dissemix
nation outside your Commitiee. Its use ts limited to official proceedings by
your Committee and the content may not- be disclosed to unauthorized person-

they are checked and that there are none whe are Znowa communists because,
that is one thing bota the right and left wings would attack him cone, so the onk
way to protect him, the President, is to be sure they are not communisis.
The President siated ancther thing is how are they going to get rid oi ihe
conrouniets wixen we do get a government. I stated that is going to depend
on the strength of the one in power. :

and probably the communists would end up in charge; we can go in tacre ax
try to get them to agree and go on the constitution and tet thers vote on it In
60 or $0 days, cxpervise the election and have a cabinet we mutually agreed
upon which I can check upon; then once we get it, help the President with
some intelligence peuple to point up who are communists. ie said they ought
to be Latins or ones who speak the languazie and he wanted me to take se
of that and to start right now saying if i were President, what I would do down
there to get rid of the communists, The President stated it can't be done in

. one day, but that ig what he wants for the Dominican kepunlic.

I told the President I had quite a umber of Agents, a hundred or so,
who are expert in the Spanish language so we have the fi ties that we can do
that, The President asked that I look at the best onos and sce who itis; that —
it has to be a feliow who can get along with the new President whom he can
trust, to figure out what Ineed, how I would set if up, and what £ would ao
to get set up to go to work on the communists. I stated I thought it can be

_ covered as we do in the South American countries as we have in some foreign
countries a Legal’ Attache attached to the Embassy and if we have a man

I get the resuits of the check to him as soon aa possible on

him the President had just called and wanted a name checked, but also wanted
me to pick a squad of FI Agents to go to the Dominican Kepublic when the
new government is jormed to advise tae Presideat on tne ren:oval of communists
and getting them out of government offices, I oricfed the Attorney General on
my conversation with the President. I told him I was not entnusiastic about it,
but since he wants it dons, I was starting to look into it and trying to line up
fifteen or twenty men able todo it. i told the Attorney Gineral I had wanted

certain that the Dominican Republic does not become another Cuba. If the

re :

The responsibilities which have been placed upon the Bureau
in developing intelligence data in the Dominican Republic, as yell as in
other Latin-American countries, are not only tremendous but may be the
heaviest and most far-reaching burden the FBI has ever been asked to
assume in the intelligence field. To guarantee our complete success,
teamwork is a must.

SSVIONN SI NIT

Accordingly, first we must do everything possible to assist
Legal Attache, Santo Domingo, in his immediate task of developing
quality sources of sufficient quantity to effect maximum coverage in the
Dominican Republic. :

In this regard, each office and Legal Attache must furnish
to the Bureau within five days of the receipt of this letter under the caption
of "DOMSIT" (code word for "Dominican Situation") the following:

(1) Identities of any established sources (former or current)
who are now in the Dominican Republic.

(2) Persons in Dominican Republic known to personnel of
your office who appear to have good source potential.

(3) Identities of any current security sources (regardless of
nationality) who.may be available for assignment (temporary or permanent)
in the Dominican Republic if-such is considered feasible by Legal Attache, °
Santo Domingo. - : See : _

‘oo

Any leads for purpose of checking background of potential sources
for Santo Domingo must receive priority attention and results submitted by
teletype.

: In addition to the Dominican requirements placed upon the Bureau,
your attention is directed to over-all need for additional informants and
sources in the Latin-American field. The reputation the Bureau has gained
during recent Dominican crisis is due in large part to the results achieved

in developing Dominican sources through a concentrated informant develop-
ment program over the past several years.

In view of critical state of unrest in Latin America today, each
office should survey its informant coverage in this field. If substantial
numbers of nationals of any Latin-American country reside within the
territory covered by your office, Bureau expects that you will have coverage
sufficient to alert you to exile organizational activities of political nature,
plots to overthrow existing governments, and general intelligence data
mcerning the countries of interest. Informant development in this field
i$ considered most important and any weaknesses which now exist must be
overcome promptly by instituting an aggressive informant development

Beople who have been selected to be in the Cabinet who are far irom vy free

the F5% to remain. i siated it was tas view of Admiral Keborn and myself that
it was going to be a mess and that we would have trouble for some time to come

CSANTO DOM OFFICE :

if This. is to recommend that the Central Intelligénce

_ Agency (CIA) be advised that we have set up a regular Legai
Attache Office in Santo Domingo in view of the President's
desire that the FBI remain in the Dominican Republic and thes
Legal Attache, Santo Domingo, be authorized to turn Ea
informants over to the Agency. :

In accordance with the desire of the President anc
recommendation of the Honorable Marvin Watson, Special
Assistant to the President, that the FBI remain in the Dominican
Republic, the Director, on 8/2/66, advised the White House
that our staff in Santo Domingo would be reduted to three ren
and that henceforth this office will be manned in a manner :
_ = Similar to that of our other Legal Attache Offices. It wili not
-be an operational Office but rather will serve as a strategic
listening post for-intelligence data and as liaison with
“agencies of the Dominican Republic, as well as other agencies
‘of foreign governments in that country. 7

_ - In light of this redirection of effort, we instructed
Legal Attache, Santo Domingo, to review his informant cover
to determine if any of our informants should be made availa
to the Agency for operation. Legal Attache has recommended
_ that & informants, § M3, be turned over to CIA.
Ee cg has been used principally to develop subversive data
on individuals in Santiago, Dominican Republic. & is
:.8 penetrative-type informant who has gained membership in
‘Dominican subversive groups. Both of these sources are
operational and are not the type we would contact in a normal

current criteria would be a questionable procedure.

both of these sources are in a position to furnish valuable
intelligence information to us. By making these informants

a Legal Attache's Office, with a group of 20 to 25 men, for the purpose
of taking charge of cleaning out communists in the Dominican Govern- f

into the government. This activity would take place first in the |
city of Santo Domingo, and then extend throughout the country until
all communists have been spotted and the Dominican Goveriment has been
advised.

All of the agents to be sent down shouvid be Llucut Spanish

will assist them in working incconspicuously with the populace.

-

(A) DOMINICAN SITUATION (NATIONALITY GROUP COVERAGE - LATIN
AMERICA)-- For your information, Bureau has established a Legal Attache
if Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, whohas already begun to make a
yaluablé contribution to the over-all efforts of the United States in making
certain that the Dominican Republic does not become another Cuba. If the
United States succeeds in its efforts to keep communists out of the new
Dominican coalition government which is in the process of being formed,
current United States policy in the Dominican Republic could very well
become the established course of action for all other countries in Latin :
America threatened with communism. {

N

= b6- OY 9345)

The responsibilities which have been placed upon the Bureau
in developing intelligence data in the Dominican Republic, as well as in
other Latin-American countries, are not only tremendous but may be the
heaviest and most fa: caching burden the FBI has ever been asked to
assume in the in nrentag anr eampl ate snecess,

teamwork is a must.

Accordingly, first we must do everything possible to assist
Legal Attache, Santo Domingo, in his immediate task of developing
quality sources of sufficient quantity to effect maximum coverage in the
Dominican Republic.

FILED

In this regard, each office and Legal Attache must furnish
W Within‘five days “éf'the receipt of this letter under the caption --
of "DOMSIT" (code word for "Dominican Situation") the following: }

—NW65360 Docld:32989627 Page 214



Any leads for purpose of checking background of potential sources
for Santo Domingo must receive priority attention and results submitted by
teletype.

In addition to the Dominican requirements placed upon the Bureau,
your attention is directed to over-all need for additional informants and
sources in the Latin-American field. The reputation the Bureau has gained
during recent Dominican crisis is due in large part to the results achieved
in developing Dominican sources through a concentrated lela develop-
ment program over the past several years.

In view of critical state of unrest in Latin America today, each
office should survey its informant coverage in this field. If substantial
numbers of nationals of any Latin-American country reside within the
territory covered by your office, Bureau expects that you will have coverage
Suificient to alert you to exile organizational activities uf poiiiical nature,
plots to overthrow existing governments, and general intelligence data
concerning the countries of interest. Informant development in this field
is considered most important and any weaknesses which now exist must be
- overcome promptly by instituting an aggressive informant development

program.

REQUEST BY U.S. SENATOR WALTER F. .
MONDALE, SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE MEMBER
TO REVIEW HIS FBI FILES :

In above file references, we had seven documents
containing masked out portions. As these masks will be
removed prior to replacing in our files, a Xerox of the
pertinent portion of the respective documents have been
made for record purposes and attached to this memorandum.

Ss
Concerning (i05-188989-8 ‘ fepartment of State
letter to FBI dated April 10, 1969, Senator Mondale
advised he had recevfed a copy of this letter from the
State Department.

Concerning 62-110783-68 report of SAA Dale E.
Berglund dated March 10, 1966, at Minneapolis captioned
"MILES WELTON LORD; United States Attorney District of
Minnesota, Administrative Inquiry ~ Bribery," Mr. Adams
mentioned to Senator Mondale there were privacy considera-
tions concerning this report and Senator Mondale limited
his review of this document to information pertaining
to himself set forth on pages 355 and 36.

ADDENDUM: J. B. ADAMS:ams 7/31/75

Subsequent to the meeting, David Aaron advised that the
Senator requested to be advised as to why certain serials(of sensitive »)
coverage (technical coverage on foreign embassies) seemed to end in (s
1970 and I advised hima that in recent years our indexing procedures in
such matters have not called for indexing the name of a Congressman or

' Memorandum for Mr. McDermott :
Re: REQUEST BY U, 8S. SENATOR WALTER F.
* MONDALE, SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE
MEMBER, TO REVIEW HIS FBI FILES

The Senator raised a question concerning a folder on the
Consumers Advisory Council, of which he was a member (62-108230-1)
and inquired how we came into possession of this particular report. I
determined that this report had been sent to Mr. Hoover in September,
1962, by Richard Berlin, President of the Hearst Corporation, as he
felt Mr. Hoover would be interested in reading the report. I advised
Mr. Aaron that the report had been sent to Mr. Hoover by a friend of
his in the newspaper field.

In response to the first matter, on June 25, i974,

I testified before the FBI Oversight Subcommittee of the

authority to collect intelligence per se" but that it operates
under the general umbrella of 28 U.8.C. 533 (3), which

authorizes the Attorney General to appoint officiais "to
conduct...investigations regarding official matters...as may

The Attorney General

Lost of this information 1s obtained from paid
informants, from other law enforcement officers, from alert
eitizons, and from court-approved clectronic surveillances
installed under the provisions of Title IIT of the Ommibus crime
Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968.

Hone of it, however, is intelligence for intclligence's
sake. The expericnce of the FBI over the years has shown that
criminal syndicates exist for the sole purpose of conducting
illegal operations and that anyone belonging to them may
reasonably be presumed to be engaged in one or more of these
activities. Therefore, our investigations of the organized
underworld are not aimed at developing genoral nonspecific

data but at establishing which criminal violations its members

pe hariacosiaca in and then proving these violations in a court

of law.

Obviously, not every case opened, covery lead followed,
or overy bit of information recoived is going to wind up in
Federal court. On the contrary, much of this material relates
to offenses outside the investigative jurisdiction of the
FRI. hen such is the ease, ve immediately dissominate the
information to the appropriate Federal, stato, or local agoncy.
As a result, information uncovered by the FBI during the past
five years alone has enabled the recipient agencies to make
more than 17,000 organized crime arrests; confiscate over
13151,000,000 worth of illicit drugs and narcotics, {9,000,000
worth of cash, property, weapons, and wagering paraphernalia,
and .°6,000,000 vorth of counterfoit bills; and assess tax
liens against 19,000,000 worth of property arising out of
Federal gambling cases.

In addition, a considerable portion of the organized
crine intelligence information dovelovea by the FBI is for~
warded to the various Fedoral Strike Forces coordinating
packet investigations throughout the country and to the
Criminal Division of the Department, which has entered this
paieirri peter in its computerized data bank called "Racketcer
Profile."

The Attorney General

In response to the socond request in your letter,
my answer is restricted to communications between the White
House and the FBI as it would not be appropriate for me to
attempt to respond for other agencies under your jurisdiction.

There are two major areas in which the Attorney
General doos not sec communications between the hite House
and the FBI. They are tho results of namo checks and the
results of full ficld investigationswe do for the Vhite House.
The White House requests approximately 13,000 name checks per
year concerning persons who visit the White House complex who
could pose a physical threat or possible embarrassment to the
President directly or indirectly. Approximately 1,000 full
field background investigations on Prosidential appointecs,
nenbers of the thite House staff, and othor porsons having
regular access to the White House are requested annually.

I direct your attention to Section 0.15 (b) (7),
Title 28, Code of Federal Regulations, which states that the
Deputy Attorney General shall "Coordinate Dopartmontal liaison
with the Uhite House staff and the Executive Office of the
President." ‘Yhen this order was promulgated there were
discussions botween the Department and Bureau officials as
to its implcmentation and its impact on oxicting direct
liaison between the FBI and the White House. Ly letter to
the Attornoy Gonoral, Moy 2, 1974, captioned "Revision of the
Departnont of Justico Organization Regulations (28 CFR Fart 0),"
sot forth the FBI's need for a Special Agent-Liaison officer
to handle day toa day opcratlonal liaison with the thhite House.
His activities were outlined and 1t was requested that he
continue to handle operational problems on o daily basis
with specific individuals because of the sensitivity of the
natters involved, both of a personal security and intelligence
nature.

By memorandum datcd May 16, 197%, captioned "Dircet
Operational Idaison with the “hite House," the Attorney General
authorized the continuance of FBI direct operational liaison
with the Uhite House.



\e 65360 Docld:32989627 Page 253

The Attorney General

With the exeeptions as noted above, the FBI has
adhered to a policy that when information is given to the
Uhite House the Attorney General is given the same information
contemporancously. Most of this information relates to current
matters pertaining to the national security. This dissemination
to the Vhite House is sometimes based on requests from the
White House but more frequently on the initiative of the FBI.

With regard to any correspondence directed to this
Bureau from the White House, short of a file by file reviev,
there 1s no means of determining whether or not such communica-
tions bypassed the Attorney General.

The established rule of furnishing the Attorucy
General copies of correspondence to the White House should be
followed strictly so that the Attorney General is kept fully
informed on matters of interest to hin.

Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams Memo
RE: SENSTUDY 75

He was advised by SA Daly that we had previously received requests

for the interview of a number of employees in Atlanta, Georgia, by the
Committee and that upon receipt of the attached communication, after
consultation with Deputy Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination
Michael Shaheen, SA Daly had telephonically informed John Elliff, head

of the domestic intelligence task force for the Committee, of the
Department's interpretation as set forth in the attached document and

the fact that Mr. Elliff should contact Mr. O'Connor concerning these
proposed interviews. Mr. O'Connor said that he had been contacted by
Mr. Elliff and had, in fact, told Mr. Elliff there would be no interviews.
In this regard, O'Connor stated the Department had prepared a proposed
draft letter to the Committee expressing concern for the Fifth Amendment
rights for Bureau employees and raising other legal issues. Mr. O'Connor
indicated that the finalized form of this letter should be sent to the
Committee in the near future.

The results of the conversation with John Elliff by O'Connor
hawe caused the Office of Legal Analysis to receive complaints concerning .
this decision from various Committee staff members, including Mark
Gitenstein and Michael Epstein, We can anticipate, unless this particular
problem is resolved, receiving protests from their superiors on the
Committee,

RECOMMENDATION:
You will be kept advised of developments concerning this

matter. Legal Analysis Office will continue efforts to determine what
effect this will have on the GAO inquiry.

The meaning of "demand" is not indicated, beyond subpoena, in ©
the C.F.R. sections indicated. This omission creates a need for an
interpretation, for purposes of uniform Department of Justice reaction.

Outlines for inquiry proceedings were agreed upon between the
White House and the Senate Select Committee on June 13, 1975, and a
K copy of those procedures was furnished to the Department on June 16,
1975. Under those guidelines, there is a general undertaking by the
b Committee to identify witnesses to the Agency a reasonable time before
t the interviews occur. This general rule includes current and former
employees; certain exceptions (not clearly defined) are indicated in
the guidelines. The Committee is required to provide the witness with
a copy of the procedures, and "relevant waivers of secrecy oaths or
agreements for the purpose of this inquiry". The Committee is required
to give prior notice of an interview, generally, specifying: (a) sub-
ject area; (b) periods of employment; (c) the date set for the interview.

Since these structured procedures, taken with the rules of the
Subcommittee, may create a requirement of testimony upon witnesses, it
seems to me clear that the paragraphs of 28 C.F.R., § 16.21, et. seq.,
which refer to "demand" should be interpreted to include any request
by any Committee staff member to interview any employee, former employee
or other person connected with the Department of Justice.

This interpretation requires certain action: (1) that the wit-
ness be authorized to speak under 8 16.23 by an appropriate Department
Official; and, (2) that an appropriate Department Official be designated.
I would think that the appropriate Department Official for the FBI should
be the Director of the FBI or the FBI General TINE in coordination
with this office.

As a matter of current practice, the PBI and other components
of the Department are presently coordinating with me on agreements
for disclosure under § 16.23, as a system for ensuring that they are
receiving treatment consistent with the outlines of inquiry procedure
and. the agreements between the Committee and the Department.

If you approve, I will advise the involved components of the’
Department of Justice that the word "demand" will be interpreted as.
indicated for each witness.

On July 23, 1975, Mike Gitenstein, staff
member Senate Select Committee, requested that he
be given a briefing concerning "Official and Con-,

a summary of the inspection inquiry to the Committee
by letterhead memorandum dated 7-16-75, and also
made available for review in Bureau space a list of
people contacted during the course of this inquiry.

With regard to Gitenstein's request it would
appear beneficial for us to brief the Senate Select
Committee representative concerning the scope and
details of this inquiry. In this regard it appears
Gitenstein is interested in those individuals who
were. contacted by the Inspection Division during their
inspection into the "Official and Confidential"

‘iles.

If approved the briefing will be tentatively
scheduled for Friday, July 25, 1975.

By memorandum dated June 24, 1975, you were
advised of the Department's intention to make a closed
Departmental file-available to captioned Committee.
Thefile contained the results of a criminal investigation
conducted by the Bureau. The Intelligence, General
Investigative and Special Investigative Divisions were
requested to furnish their views concerning this matter
and the Legal Counsel Division was to prepare a letter
to the Department setting forth the Bureau's position
with regard to this matter.

We have since had discussions with the Attorney
General and other representatives of the Department concerning
Senate Select Committee access to Bureau files and
submitted correspondence to the Department concerning
this matter. It would appear additional communications
to the Department are unnecessary. The Department is
well aware of our position in this matter.

RECOMMENDATION:

We do not prepare a communication to the
Department concerning this matter.

U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE
ACTIVITIES (SSC); INTERVIEW OF ASSISTANT
DIRECTOR IN CHARGE ROBERT &. GEBHARDT BY

SSC STAFF MEMBER

On August 7, 1975, Assistant Director Robert E.
Gebhardt, Los Angeles Division, was interviewed in the Los
Angeles FBI Office by Mr. Lester Seidel, Staff Member of
the Senate Select Committee, United States Senate.

Gebhardt's rights were not explained to him by
Seidel although Seidel did explain the purpose of the

interview, that is.,—the-Cointel prosrm-oi he Far ae it ie FBT as it
related to the FBI's investigation of the Black”Panther Party
when Gebhardt was the Special Agent in Charge” of ‘the’ San

FEanciseo Division from LO70"to 197
rence ener nc ESTER TR

The interview lasted From 9:05 AM until 10:30 AM,
and it was not necessary for Gebhardt to consult with any
Bureau representative.

Gebhardt had previously been advised by a-Bureau
representative of his right to counsel, the privileged areas
of information, consultation privileges, and the parameters

Seidel inquired at the outset as to whether Gebhardt

atte

Party investigation on a day-to-day basis being specifically
advised details of the investigation as it relates to the
,Cointel Program. It was expkained to Seidel that as Special
Agent in Charge of the San Francisco FBI Office wherein
over 500 employees were located at the time, Gebhardt had
many responsibilities in the operation of that division and

therefore, relied upon the experience, expertise, and judgment
of the various supervisors assigned to the office for the
day-to-day direction of the various matters under investigation,
including the investigation of the Black Panther Party.

It was further explained that if a problem was
encountered or a particularly unusual situation developed,
Gebhardt was, of course, consulted and was available for
such consultation to resolve any particular problem areas.

Gebhardt was next asked if he recalled being SAC
when the electronic coverage of the Black Panther Party and
the various officials at BBP was instituted and eventually
terminated. Seidel was advised that the electronic coverage
was already in effect upon Gebhardt's arrival, however, he
does recall receiving a phone call after the "Keith Decision"
was handed down instructing that all electronic coverage of
the BPP and the various members of the BPP be discontinued.
The call was received from Bureau Headquarters and the
discontinuance was effected immediately.

Seidel inquired as to whether Gebhardt felt the
intelligence type investigations should be completely removed
from the criminal investigations which investigations would be
looking. toward eventual prosecution.

Seidel was informed by Gebhardt that even in criminal
investigations looking toward prosecutions, much intelligence
information is obtained from time to time which really has no
value from a prosecutive standpoint, but does have possible
value with respect to the direction of the investigation. In
some criminal investigations a great deal of intelligence
information may be obtained and in other types, very little.
Insofar as the FBI is concerned, however, every effort is
made to make certain there is some Federal law which would be
a basis for an investigation which procedures would include
matters commonly referred to as security investigations.

In some instances, in such security investigations
a great deal of intelligence information would be obtained
therefore, it was Gebhardt's opinion that so-called intelli-
.gence type investigations should not be removed from or
differentiated from criminal type investigations looking
toward prosecutions since intelligence information is an
outgrowth of the basic investigation.

NW 65360 Docld:32989627 Page 270



Gebhardt was asked if he felt the Cointelpro was a
separate entity distinguished from the basic investigation
and it was explained that the Cointelpro was a phase of the
overall investigation in any particular organization or
individual.

Gebhardt was asked if he felt Congress should enact
legislation which would set forth specific investigative
techniques that could or could not be utilized by the FBI or
other Federal investigative agencies. He was advised in
Gebhardt's opinion, such legislation should not be enacted,
and in reply to the question as to why such legislation should
not be enacted, it was pointed out that as an investigative
agency, there must of necessity be allowed a certain flexi-
bility because no two investigations are exactly alike and the
circumstances of such investigations could possibly not be
related to such Federal law.

In answer to the question as to how Congress should
assure the American public that questionable activity such
as the Cointelpro, was not being engaged in by an investigative
agency such as the FBI, Seidel was informed that the Congress
and the American people must rely upon the integrity and
honesty of the Director of the FBI and the Attorney General.

It was pointed out that both the Director of the

FBI and the Attorney General are nominated by the President,
hearings are held before the various Congressional Committees
and finally approved by the Senate. It was further pointed
out that Director Kelley has recently stated in connection with
the publicity relative to Cointelpro, that he has no intention
of permitting this program to be reinstituted in the FBI and
if circumstarm ever arose which circumstances he could not
(contenplatete this time, wherein it was thought such

activi-tiés shduld be embarked upon, he would obtain the personal
approval of the Attorney General prior to such instituting.
Seidel was informed that Gebhardt was in total agreement with

this statement of Mr. Kelley.

Gebhardt was asked as to what his feelings were
relative to what the relationship should be between the FBI
and Congress. He was informed that a Senate Oversight
Committee was recently established and it was felt that this
was a good start and that this Committee should formalize and

\ NW 65360 Docld:32989627 Page 271



standardize their oversight responsibilities and make regular
inquiries of the Director and other officials of the FBI as
to our activities. He was informed that there should be
either a joint oversight committee between the House and
Senate or if the Congress decided on two oversight Committees
in both the House and Senate, these committees should be the
entities through which all information relative to the
activities of the FBI should flow.

It was emphasized however, that there should be
regular consultation between these representatives and the
FBI.

{ Inquiry was made as to Gebhardt's opinion relative

; to the relationship between the Department of Justice and

' the FBI and Seidel was informed the relationship, in Gebhardt's

opinion, is excellent, should continue, and there should be

» a free flow af information between the FBI and the Department
of Justice.

At the conclusion of the interview, Gebhardt summed
up his comments by stating that Congress should definitely
set up a structured oversight procedure of the activities
of the FBI with due regard to the confidentiality of many
of the FBI operations and investigations and must assure
itself that the members of the Committee and its staff will
maintain the confidentiality where necessary.

Secondly, in the areas of investigative matters
usually referred to as national defense, national security
or intelligence operations, all of the FBI investigations
must be based on the application of the facts toward a
particular Federal statute and if the facts are so oblique
that they cannot be clearly applied to a particular Federal
statute, consultation with the Department of Justice should
be had in all instances.

reportedly voiced his displeasure to O'Flaherty stating he

did not approve of the latter's action. (The memorandum in
question dealt with CIA's possible use of derogatory information
to determine the direction Senator Jackson would take in futyr
actions he might encounter which might involve CIA activity| yO
Thweat advised he would recontact his relative to determing if
this individual would come forward, reveal his identity and

be cooperative in any investigation.

James Daniel O'Flaherty, born 11/4/42, is a member of the Staff R
of SSC and has been granted a security clearance up to “Top Sera

On the morning of 7/31/75, Philadelphia Office was
telephonically contacted and instructed to expedite a contact
with Thweat to determine the availability of his relative. At
approximately 2:30 p.m., 7/31/75, Philadelphia Office advised
that Thweat, upon recontact,‘had stated that it would be impossible
to contact his relative before this coming weekend. In conver-
sation, he identified his relative as a niece who is currently
attending school in ington, D. C.. He further advised that
O'Flaherty reportedly is no longer residing with his wife and

. is engaged in an emotional relationship with his niece, Thweat
added he believed his niece would be cooperative as she has
expressed her disapproval of O'Flaherty's action. He concluded
by saying that upon -ermination of his niece's decision in
this regard he would ediately advise the Philadelphia Office.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: ‘Senstudy 75
62-116395

upon this Bureau to make the above information available at
the earliest logical time and in the most complete form
possible to the Department, CIA, and Senators Frank Church
and John G. Tower of the SSC. Accordingly, an interview by
Bureau Agents of Thweat's niece, if she agrees to cooperate,

* would appear desirable before initiating any action on the
basis of information received to date,

Additionally, it is not known at this time whether
- or not the document reportedly Xeroxed by O'Flaherty is
elassified. In our continuing inquiry into this matter,
attempts will be made to identify document, determine whether
it contains classified information and ascertain whether or
not a violation of Federal statutes exists,

RECOMMENDATIONS :

1. That contact. be maintained with the Philadelphia
Office to insure that the desired information concerning
Thweat's niece be expeditiously obtained. If she agrees to
cooperate, she will be immediately interviewed and pertinent
information obtained - furnished,via established liaison

channels,to the Department, CIA, and Senators Church and Tower.

Appropriate field offices will be instructed to conduct
necessary investigation to corroborate the information and
to determine if a possible violation of Federal statutes has
been committed,

The Intelligence Division advised Philadelphia Office

Philadelphia from seeing his niece and indicated she would talk to the i
FBI on the condition that she would go to Philadelphia about 8/22/75 :
to talk to the Agent who is a personal friend of Thweat and to whom
he initially confided the information regarding this matter. Philadelphia
was advised in view of the time iag a more preferable alternative
would be for WFO Agents to contact the niece or as another alternative the
Philadelphia Agent would travel.to Washington, D. C., to conduct
the interview. Philadelphia was requested to expeditiously recontact
Thweat concerning the above possibilities.
