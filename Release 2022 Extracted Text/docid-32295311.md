NO 1457-C-TE, on September 14, 1967, advised that CARLOS

MARCELLO is highly enraged at his attorneys for allowing a change

of venue motion to be granted in Federal District Court, Eastern

District of Louisiana, on September 13; 1967 MARCELLO and his

attorneys never thought such a motion would be granted and this

motion was merely for harassment purposes.

Informant stated that during the evening of September

13, 1967, MARCELLO roundly cursed his attorneys and during the.

evening of September 13, 1967, he also telephonically contacted

several unknown political figures.

sole purpose of attempting to determine how he could have the

change of venue motion decision rescinded. Informant stated

that MARCELLO firmly believed that he can beat any case in the

State of Louisiana; however, he is in real trouble if tried

outside the State of Louisiana.

Informant stated that during the evening of September

12, 1967, he determined that CARLOS MARCELLO had two electronic:

devices which he contemplated introducing into evidence in Federal

District Court on September 13, 1967. MARCELLO had an electronics

expert waiting to testify relative to these devices. MARCELLO

contemplated claiming that one device came off a telephone pole

at his Churchill Farms Estate and the other came from his home at

3908 Clifford Drive, Metairie, Louisiana.

MARCELLO intended,

through his attorneys, to allege that these devices were United

States Government devices.

On September 22, 1967, the Houston Division furnished

the duplicate sheets of the Gulf Oil Company Credit Card issued

to MARCELLO for the previous six-month billing period. No

information of value was contained in these bills.

regional coverage due to a recent series in "Life Magazine".
