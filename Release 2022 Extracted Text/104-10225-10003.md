MEMORANDUM FOR: Secretary, Clandestine Services Career

Service Panel

SUBJECT

: Recommendation for Promotion of Mr.

Joseph S. Piccolo .

It is recommended that Mr. Joseph S. Piccolo be promoted

from GS-7 to GS-8. He has been in grade GS-7 since 19 July 1960

and was assigned to what is now the Special Affairs Stall (formerly

Task Force W) on 27 August 1962.

2. As long ago as 16 June 1960 when he was a GS-6 Mr. Piccolo

was considered to have merited promotion to GS-9, but an Agency

policy precluding multiple grade promotions prevented his being con-

sidered for G8-9 at that time. He was promoted to GS-7 on 19 July

1960. On 4 May 1961 Mr. Piccolo was recommended for promotion

to G8-8 at a time when he was expected to leave the Agency in order

to comply with his obligation for military service.

The recommendation

was not approved on the grounds that promotion spaces were limited.

Mr. Piccolo served in the Air Force between 4 October 1961 and

27 August 19ß2 when he returned to the Agency and began working in

the Cl Branch of the Special Affairs Staff.

Mr. Piccolo has demonstrated an aptitude for CI and FI

operations and is one of the most promising younger men in the CI

Branch. His performance since returning from military service has

been supertor in all respects.

4, I am happy to recommend Mr. Piccolo for promotion.

CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY..

WASHINGTON 25, D. G.

Applicant Information

Sheet No. 1

To all persons ipplying for employment.

with the Central Intelligence Agency:

This paper is the first step in applying for employment or consultant

Biatus with the Central Intelligence Agency. No application may proceed

beyond this first step if the applicant is not in agreement with the

conditions stated below:

General Considerations:

1. The Nitional Security Act of 26 July 1947 (Public Law 253, 80th

Congress) which created the Central Intelligence Agency places upon the

Agency the responsibility:

á, "40 advise the National Security Council in matters concerning

such intelligence activities of the Guvernment departments and agencies

as relate to the national security;

b. "to make recommendations to the Notional Sicurity Council

for the coordination of such intelligence activities of the depart-

ments and agencies of the Government as relate to the national

security;

c. "to correlate and evaluate intelligence relating to the

national security, and provide for the appropriate dissemination

of such intelligence within the Government... ;

d. "s0 perform, for the benefit of the existing intelligence

agencies, such additional services of common concern as the National

Security Council determines can be more efficiently accomplished

centrally;

e, "to perform such other functions and duties related lo

intelligence affecting the national security as the National Security

Council may from sine so time direct. "

!

## Page 91

14-00000

The special charocere of this national responsibility requires the Agency

to maintain correspondingly special employment criteri: which miy be

different from the routine or normal employment standards of other Govern.

ment departments and agencies which do not have the highly sensitive res-

ponsilality borne by she Control Intelligence Agency, ll follows that the

investigation of applicants preroquisire lo their acceptance do a time-

consining process which, in addition to loyalty and security checks,

includeo evaluation of competence, physical and emotional fitnees, und

avallability of i suitable position al such time as employment may be offered.

This la called "elearance" of an applicane.

2. Investigation of an applicant may reveal something which prevents

his clearance - perhaps something of which the applicont is genuinely unavire.

perhaps something which only the special employment criteria of the Agency

make unacceptable. In uny event, adverse lindings by the Agency are con-

clusive and final so far as the Agency is concerned, und no statement of

specific reasons is made so the applicane.

3. Employment by the Central Intelligence Agency is not i right upon

which an applicant con insist. Offer of employment which is subject to full

clearance does not constitute a commitment on the Agency's part giving an

unsuccessful applicant grounds for any claim against the Agency. Acceptance

of employment upon the condition of clearance is at the applicant's risk,

taken with the knowledge that a very substantial percentage of applicants

are not cleared.

Stitrinent of Understanding

and Agreement

I have read, understand, and agree to the foregoing Generil Consid-

erations. If not accopted for employment by the Central Intelligence

Agency, I will make no claim or demand in conflict with those consid-

erations.

I have also seen and read Applicant Information Sheet No. 2.

This Fitness Report is one of the most thorough and balanced from a substantive

view which I have reviewed in some time.

1 find it to be accurate

and reflects my own contention that Ar. Plocolo is for his grade one of the most

productive, aggressive and versatile officers de nave in the DO.

Earller this year Mr. Plecolo recolved a 05l in recognition of his fine performance

on the Cl staff during che previous year.

There is no question that a sustained

superior offort on Mr. Piccolo's pare will concinue to be the pattern in ehe ruturo.

He has a prosperous cancer ahead of hia.

cables had considerable impact on WID management and were used widely in

the extension of the survey program into other areas.

Although Mr. Piccolo's field exposure has been exclusively in the Latin

Anerican arca, he has i widely varied operational backeround, having served

in varying operational capacities in several stations, and he is perceptive

in his understanding of operational realities.

Piccolo approached both Surveys with

enthusiasm and a sense of responsibility, completed his written report

(he had a different partner in each casc) promptly and accurately.

doubtedly would have been engaged in a third survey except his temporary

It is fully accurate to say that the survey

This sooms to be a fair report which rates Subject about the gamo

way that I would, based on my understanding of his performance.

Subject

is a maturo and competent officer who does a fine job of handling existing

operationa and administrative taska but has not been very aggressivo in

The

be very inspiring operationally, but new business is needed and Subject is

pleting a tour of military duty. At that time he was assigned to TEW/CI.

Although employee expressed a desire to work in operations at that time, he

agreed to periorm the duties outlined in section B. He was called upon to

perform these duties because of the dire need within TFW/CI for someone

with his talents to establish and manage Branch systems for mall rousing-

control and Miles.

Employee was promised an opcrational assignment as

soon as the systems were established and functioning in an orderty and

efficient manner.

Employee has performed his dutice exceptionally well

and has established systems for mall routing-control, and files for the

Branch which are functioning well. It is strongly recommended that this

employee be assigned to duties of an operational nature and relleved from

his present dutles as soon as possible. Employee has the capability of assuming

addition lu his normal administrative functions Mr. Piccolf has been acting as a case

oificer on cortain senaitive and complicated clandestine operatite.

He has performed

these dutica in i superior fashion. It is my unqualified opinion that Mr. Piccolo

should recolve at least a two-grade promotion immediately. However it is

recognized that this is contrary to current Agency policy and therefore it is strongly

recommendod that he be promoted to the grade of GS-7 Immediately, Mr. Piccolo

is intelligent and extremely industrlous.

Ho has worked long hours performing a

variety of Important tasks. It is my opinion that Mí. Piccolo hau the attributes

required of carcer personnel working in the Foreign Intelligenco arca and that ho

should be pormitted to have his carcor designation changed to Fl.

Mr. Piccolo should

also be given the opportunity to receive Agency training so that he might be buttor

become a professional case officer.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, LA Division

SUBJECT

:

Mr. Juseph S. Piccolo - Completlon of Senior

Operations Course 02/76

1. Mr. 'Piccolo attended the Senior Operatlons Course from 3 November

to 12 December 1975 (SOC 02/76). Individual. student grades and class rankings.

have not been used to evaluate student performance. The diverse background of

the students and the nature of the course materini uned in the SOC preclude

formal testing.

This memorandum atteste to Mr. Pleculo's satlafactory comple-

thon of the courac.

2.

During the six weeks of che course, 59% of the time was devoted to

subjects and activities directly related to

operations, including 30% devoted

to "hands-on" time with technical equipmont and "on-the-street" practice of

tradecraft. 3l% of the time was devoted to material broadly categorized as

"ops management," Including about 107 on the Sovlet and China targets.

The :

final 10% of the time

was. devoted to subjects categorized as "management over-

view and ops support," which consisted of meetings with Do division and ataff

chiefs and visits to labs and other ops support facilitles in the Headquarters

area.

The

Jofficers in the class ranged in grade from GS-12 to 6S-14

(averige grade 12.9), nverage age was 43.6 (Mr. Plecolo's age la 40).

The

class members' average years of Agency service was 16.8, and their average

years of overscas service was ?.2.

3. The six weeks, normally 30 doys of Instruction time, wis shortened

to 28 days by the Thanksgiving

Day weekend.

Of these 28 days, Mr. Piccolo

spent 8ix days in Intensive training in Persuasion and Minipulation Skills as

taught

He spent approximately another eight and one-half

days on technical tradecraft

and usage) and street tradecraft

etc.) Including three days

Intensive practice of these akills in a live

exercise conducted

Another five days were apent at Headquarters

meeting with the chiefs of all DO divisions and staffe, and visiting

three

operational support laboratories in the metropolitan area.

The approximntely

eight and one-half remainine days were consumed by a combination of macel-

lancous operations minagement subjects, student seminars, and term paper

uriting (though the latter was accomplished sontly on the students' own time).

This running of the course one keynoted by remirka by the ADDO, and the

Headquarters weck was climaxed by an hour and a half with the DDo.

The gueat

speaker at the graduation dinner of SOC 03/76 was Agency Historian

De. Walter Pforzhelmer.

SUBJRCT: Mr. Joseph S. Piccolo - Completion of Senior Operations

Course $2/76

Mr. Piccolo, as a 40-ycar-old CS-13/4, was at about the average age

for this class and slightly above nverage in grade.

Although formal grades

are not siven to graduates of the SOC, it was

consensus of DTS staff

Instructors Involved In SOC 12/76 that Mr. Piccolo would almost certainly

ranik number one in this particular group.

Bringing to the class broad opera-

tonal experience and understanding. Mr. Piccolo was an

active participant in

the s1x-day

and made contributions baged on his own

overational past. The tradecraft instructors who conducted the live problem

described Mr. Piccolo as the best student in street tradecraft.

One of the Course Coordinators commented that Mr. Piccolo, "exhibited, more

than any of the others, the ability to lead the group."

Mr. Piccolo's term

paper on the gubject of how

was careful and thorough and was described by the

panel as "an excellent overall

plan." To a man of Mr. Plecolo's experience, at least some of the course may

have seemed a little baale or redundant, but he never let it show, and always

took part with the same enthustam as the more junlor membere of the class.

S.

A copy of this memorandum is being placed in Mr. Piccolo'a official

personnel file.
