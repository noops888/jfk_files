Dear Joseph,

Please accept my appreciation for an assignment
well done as a member of the FY 1978 GS-07 Secretarial/
Clcrical DO Personnel Evaluation Boards from 17 April
through 19 May 1978.

I well! recognize the complexities involved in the
comparative’ evaluation of $60 clerical carcerists --
a task further complicated by this being only the second
year it has ‘been undertaken, Your deliberations were
vital to the Dircctorate determination to bring to this
group of valuable employ the advantages of the merit

systen.

Full-time service with the Evaluation Boards
represents a major contribution to the Directorate's
program of personnel assessment and management. Not
only were your promotion recommendations valued, but
recommendations for career development and training
were also extremely helpful.

I believe that your service on the Board broadened
and sharpencd your own focus on personnel aspects of
Agency management. Too, I think that the time spent
in this endeavor could aly have made you better aware
of our nced for complete, careful and candidly written
appraisals of our employees.

Sincerely,

Be WE es

Operational Generalist

1. It is requested that ay career designation be changed

by
Purrerey accorded me by Philip Agee and Counterspy Magazine.

MEMORANDUM FOR: gmesgpepeenonmces
THRCUGH } Chief of Station, Meaico City
SUBJECT Notification of Designation as a Participant in the Organtzation

Retirement and Disability System
REFERENCE : Book Dispatch 5096 dated 12 August 1065

1. You have been found to be qualified as a participant in the Organization Retirement
and Disability System and have been so designated effective 7 May 1967

2, Although such designation under present statutes is viewed favorably by most persons,
the regulation governing this retirement system gives the individuat the right to appeal such
a determination if he deems the designation adverse to his best interests. In order that this
technical requirement may be satisfied, you are hercby notified of your right to appeal. An
appeal with reasons therefore must be received in Headquarters within 60 days of the date of
this memorandum or acceptance of designation will be assumed, Any questions that you may
have in connection with your designation that cannot be answered by referring to referenced
Book Dispatch should be forwarded to Headquarters.

3. We believe that the benefits of the Organization Retirement System are superior to the
benefits of the Civil Service Retirement System. However, there are a few situations in which
an employee at the time of retirement may have so many years of service (almost 37) that he
would reccive.a higher annulty under the Civil Service System. Because of this, the policy

“decision has been made that a participant in the Organization System who would receive a

higher annulty under the Civil Service System may, not later than one year prior to his retire-
ment, apply to be removed from our system and transferred to the Civil Service System. Thus,
you should not anticipate this contingency asa factor in deciding whether you regard your

designation as a participant adverse to your best interests.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Secretary, Clandestine Services Career
Service Panel

SUBJECT : Recommendation for Promotion of Mr.
Joseph S, Piccolo

1, It ig recommended that Mr. Joseph S, Piccolo be promoted
from GS-7 to GS-8. He has been in grade GS-7 since 19 July 1960
and was assigned to what is now the Special Affairs Staff (formerly ____.
Task Force W) on 27 August 1962,

2, As long ago as 16 June 1960 when he was a GS-6 Mr. Piccolo
was considered to have merited promotion to GS-9, but an Agency
policy precluding multiple grade promotions prevented his being con-
sidered for GS-9 at that time. He was promoted to GS-7 on 19 July
1960, On 4 May 1961 Mr. Piccolo was recommended for promotion
to G8-8 ata time-when he was expected to leave the Agency in order
to comply with his obligation for military service, The recommendation
was not approved on the grounds that promotion spaces were limited.
Mr, Piccolo served in the Air Force between 4 October 1961 and
.27 August 1962 when he returned to the Agency and began working in
the CI Branch of the Special Affairs Staff, :

3. Mr. Piccolo has demonstrated an aptitude for CI and FI
operations and {is one of the most promising younger men in the CI
Branch, His performance since returning from military service has

been superior in all respects,
4, Iam happy to recommend Mr. Piccolo for promotion,

CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY:
WASHINGTON 23, D. G.

Appticant Information
Sheet No. 1

To all persons “apptyig for employment
with the Central Intelligence Agency:

This paper is the first step in upplying for employment or consultant
status with the Central Intelligence Agency. No application may proceed
beyond this first step if the applicant is not in agreement with the”
conditions stated bélaw:

ations:

The National Security Act of 26 July 1947 (Public Law 253, 80th

1,
Congress) which created the Central Intelligence Agency places upon the

Agency the responsibility:

a, "to advise the National Security Council in matters concerning
such.intelligence activities of the Government departments and agencies

as relate to the national security;

b, "to make recommendations to the National Security Council
for the coordination of such intelligence activitics of the depart-
ments and ugencies of the Government as relate to the national

security;
c, "to correlate and evaluate intelligence relating to the

national security, and provide for the appropriate dissemination
of such intelligence within the Government... i

d. "to perform, for the benefit of the existing intelligence
agencies, such additional services of common concern as the National
Security Gouncil determines can be more efficiently accomplished

centrally;

e. "to perform such other functions and dutics related to
intelligence affecting the national security as the National Security
Council may from time to time direct."



\

\
The special character of this national responsibility requires the Agency
to maintain correspondingly special employment criteric which may be
different from the routine of normal employment standards of other Governs
ment departments and agencies which do not have the highly sensitive res~
ponsibility borne by the Central Intelligence Agency. It follows that the
investigation of applicants, prerequisite to their acceptance is a time-
consuming process which,! in addition to loyalty and security checks,
includes evaluation of competence, physical and emotional fitness, and
availability of a suitable position at such time as employment may be offered.
This is called "clearance" of an applicant.

2, Investigation of an applicant may reveal something which prevents
his clearance = perhaps something of which the applicant is genuinely unaware,
perhaps something which only the special employment criteria of the Agency
make unacceptable, In any event, adverse findings by the Agency are con-
clusive and final so far as the Agency is concerned, and no stutement of
specific reasons is made to the applicant.

3, Employment by the Central Intelligence Agency is not a right upon
which an applicant can insist, Offer of employment which is subject to full
clearance does not constitute a commitment on the Agency's part giving an
unsuccessful applicant grounds for any claim against the Agency, Acceptance
of employment upon the condition of clearance is at the applicant's risk,
taken with the knowledge that a very substantial percentage of applicants
are not cleared,

Statement of Understanding
and Agreement

Thave read, understand, and agree to the foregoing General Consid-

erations, If not accepted for employment by the Central Intelligence
Agency, I will make no claim or demand in conflict with those consid-

erations,

Ihave also seen and read Applicant Information Sheet No. 2,

end advised not to contact his local board and™icy wil} not contact him.
He was sent to cee Captain Noble in Reserve Affairs Branch. Captain Noble
+was not in and subject was interviewed by Sgt. MacKenzie. I talked to
MacKenzie and stressed the fact that subject should! be advised to be sure
to drop out of the National Guard. MacKenzie said that he would have to
request to be put ina etaniby reserve status. This seems to be a satis
factory arrangement, since we are requesting a directed dbferwent, the L.B.

SECTION D_-_ NARRATIVE COMMENTS — (Continued)

The two countries which Mr. Piccolo helped survey represent widely
varying operational and social environments. In both instances, however,
the Station Chiefs cabled Headquarters at the end of tie field aspect of
the ey complimenting the team on the thoroughness and understanding
with which they conducted the survey, and conmented on the usefulness and
practicality of the team's recommendations, It should noted that these
cables hail considerable impact on DDO management and were used widely in
the extension of the survey program into other areas.

Although Mr. Piccolo's ficld exposure has been exclusively in the Latin
American arca, he has a widely varied operational background, having served
in varying operational capacities in several stations, and he is perceptive
in his understanding of operational realitios. His sonality is positive
and outgoing, and in most instances he is able to initiate very quickly a
responsive dialogue with fellow officers. We is adaptable in outlook and
reads quickly and with understanding; qualities almost indispensible in an
activity of this kind. Im sum, Mr. Piccolo approached both Surveys with
enthusi: and a sense of responsibility, completed his written report
(he had ‘a different partner in cach case) promptly and accurately. He un-
doubtedly would have been engaged in a third survey except his temporary
tour ended and he was assigned permancntly elsewhere in the Staff.

In his duties in thé Special Operations Branch, Mr. Piccolo has excelled
in his management responsibilities in- the sense of both getting the work
out of his people and in getting along with them, He is on good terms with
all of them. fe has shown good CI mentality-and a-thorgughness which is
essential to good CI work. - His dedication to his work is shown by his
punctuality in the morning and his presence in his office well after five
most evenings, His ‘production as, operations officer has been steady and
thorough for both of the projects for which he has responsibility. Unfortu-
nately, he experienced a period of ill health following a hectic TDY;
however, he returned to duty at the first opportunity and resumed his duties
with vigor.” His versatility was recently demonstrated his participation
in a joint meeting with| over a period
of several days and evenings during which he proved fully effective in
achieving Agency objectives in a and social environment.

The most impressive aspect of Mr. Piccolo's performance and one deserving
special mention in this fitness report is his ability sith the written word.
It is fully accurate to say that the survey reports to which he contributed
were mich better written than were those of his peers. He has the ability to
describe an operational situation in terms which are at the same time mean-
ingful, concise and ea i ure to read his miterial and

this report combines Subject's duties as specified in two previous
LOI's which run from 1 June 1974 to 30 May 1975 and fror 1 June 1975
through 31 July 1975. The duties listed are therefore broader than
those to be reflected in the ‘latest LOI now being forsulated as a
logical adjunct to the new MBO format and content.

(*) (On specific duties No. S$ and 6, there is so little content
or substance associated with these duties as to make a Letter Rating
meaningless. The target in| ] is practically non-
existent and there is no current need for technical operations to
support approved operational activities. The duties are listed only
because they were included in the LOI.)

his several stints as ACOS (during COS illness which required
hospitalization and medical consultations out of country),
Subject really shone in his performance He was obliged to
deal with the most difficult ever encountered by
this rater, and represented and protected Station interests
with skill and dignity.

Subject requires little supervision, by virtue of his
thorough knowledge and extensive experience in practically
every aspect of the mechanics of clandestine operations in
Latin America. His avocation is “Administration”, in the full
sense of the word, and he administers his work load impeccably.
The assignment just completed was his first command job, and he
has acquired the additional managerial shills necessary for iim
to progress in his career. There is no question of his
additional potential, and it is natural to envision him as a
Deputy Chief of Station at a larger Latin American Station,
or, better, as a Chief of Base in his next field assignment.

He is above average in security and cost-consciousness, Ile
is fluent not only in Spanish, but also in Portuguese, and
more importantly, in human reheions, We can establish rapport
with people at all levels of society.

His personality is a pleasant one, Ie ts low-keycd,
soft-spoken, sincere and methodical and establishes natural
excellent rapport with his co-workers, both subordinate and
superior. While easy to get atong with, he still bnows how
to effectively administer trainings, guidance, advice and

representational[| +7» sn the former category,

articularly, he could have spent more and

are completed. 7

This Officer is the victim of personnel requirements,
which has resulted in an Organizational failure .to challenge
his talents and ingenuity. His re-assignnent to the Cuban
Operations Section next, for example, will be his fifth

Subject 1s an exceptionally responsible and mature officer who
also combines with these virtues outstanding ability in the fine
tuning, analysis and direction of highly complex human cases.

During the period under review he handled a most complex and delicate
exploitation and ofa ALSOBER |

with CKPOLAR ramifications with a substantial degree of success. He
has also served, in his capacity as deputy base chief, as counsellor
and provider of guidance to case officers concerning virtually all

of the Base's* operations and particularly the more complex and
-~difficult. agent cases.‘ His unusually keen intuition and perceptiveness
have consistently helped the Base to avoid pitfalls and recognize
important but obscure operational factors. His operational judgement
is extremely sound.

During the period under review Subject has had an opportunity,
to demonstrate his ability as a supervisor aad the results have been
impressive. He is naturally careful and thougttfl as well as
objective in his dealings with people and he adds clenents of
sensibility and sympathy as well which enable him to get good -
responses and inspire confidence. Case officers and other personnel # :
tend to gravitate to him naturally seeking help and guidance and : ‘i
he gives of himself generously in these situations. Me has shown i

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL 7
I concur in this excellent rating in all respects. Tho perform-

ance of this fine officer has been superior, ‘He played a crucial role,

at the Base, Hoe ts a strong considerate supervisor with potential

for growth, The failure to get out on the street and recruit during

tho past yoar (1.am not familiar with previous experience) can bo

partly attributed to immersion in the complex, time consuming

surfacing/disposal case, but must also be attributed partly to his

personality (or at least hin mood at that stage of his tour), Subject

is porhaps more comfortable, or aceemed to bo during tho rating period, |

new initiatives during these occasions, after due thought and
consultation, if he thought they were warranted. And he has been

an excellent judge of men (and women) and their quality, In his
doalings with LNFALL, its various LNBUZZ agencies and their

directors he has held up the Base's interests and image well while
secking fair and practical answers and solutions. He has a good sense
of cconomy in monetary as well as other affairs. As he becomes

“iOre senior and more exclusively a superviser and executive he should

become more and more effective.

Subject is an excellent operational manager and agent
handler who gots the best out of his assets. He is probably not
so strong aS an. operational starter and developer and this appears
to bo duo in part to an instinct to avoid exposure and eschow the
kKlad hand. On the other hand, he has undertaken[_] rather
difficult operations starting trom scratch during
the past six months and has at least proven that he can do this kind =
of work when it is necessary. In both these cases he may have :
-triod to move too fast in order to reach bofore
his departuro but this is understandable. His written work is f
woll conceived and conscientious and perhaps even somewhat above
averago for case officers of his grade and experience. Like most
BKHERALD officors, however, he docs not take sufficient pains to
achieve simple, clear, forceful expression with the result that,
while-his best efforts are effective his second best is apt to
result in lack of organization and clarity. He should work on this -
Q suggestion might be that he practice avoiding metaphors and
adopt a straight declarative sontence style.

If conclusion, Subject's performance has been first class
in tho most important respects and his relatively minor weaknesses
are not incurable. He should have an excellent futuro as a senior
caso officer and supervisor, particularly if he attacks and cures
these weaknesses. His overall performance in his present tour

has boon very strong indeed.

Subject is perhapy. tho most maturo, dependable and competent
gase officer we have. ‘He has oxcellod in tho handling of intricato,
sensitive operations witdré’tho highest professional
standards aro demanded. ile carries a very heavy work load lightly
and is a prodigious contributor in both operational and information
reporting. His performance as a suporvisor has been characterized
by consciontiousioss; a good sense of dotail, perceptivoness, fairness
and firmness. Ile is at his best in practical situations, howevor
complex and obscuro,. rather than in dealing with philosophical or
thooretical problems but this is obviously more a matter of inclination,
than of intellect. Ho ts highly respected and appreciated by all his
colleagues and especially by this supervisor,

Subject is under grade for his porformance, oxperience and
responsibilities. He is of all the Base officers most desorving of
a. promotion. A separate recommendation to this effect is being

COMMENTS OF REVIERING OFFICIAL

The COS concurs emphatically with this well-writton evaluation,
The subject is vastly under-rated in JKLANCE, perhaps because of his
quiet, unassuming porsonality. But ho is a strong, very strong,
officer, His ability to handlo the moat difficult dotail should not
detract from his ovorall capabilitios. Ifo is sound as a rock, and
merits a promotion, which is recommonded by the COS,

indirectly through others, has not yet ‘been sufficiently put to the test to emble the

The reviewing officer concurs in the comments of the rater. I have
observed this officer closely during his tour at tho Station. He

has largely overcome a tondency to freewheol somewhat and shows an
increasing willingness to accept guidance from more experienced
officers. Compared with othor officers of tho same grade at this
Station, it 18 my belief that his overall performance should be

- rated O rathor than $,

In the Station's .view he is a ydung officer who should advance
steadily and with more exportonce should be able to handle a denanding

~arens Wiero he used knowledge gained from previous Agency experience
{together with hie natural ability to get along with people in face-to-face

and was imaginative in am in establishing clandestine
|. Shorteomings, however, arose in other areas because ho
‘occastonally rélied too mich on his ability to improvise, rather than
to apend extra time in analyzing, planning aml otherwice preparing for
agent moctings. el

Mr. Piecolo easily recognized leads of operational or intelligense
value, and as the course progressed, displaycd marked improvement in
his writing of cables, dispatches and reports.

Mr. Piccolo acquired a more than satisfactory knowledge of the
principles and techniques taught during the course.

4. COMMENT AND PERTDIENT OBSERVATIONS:

During his training, Nr. Piccolo has acquired a good knowledge of
the principles and techniques of clandestine operations, We has
‘demonstrated a good intelligence sense and a particular ability for
handling agents,

He has had no supervisory responsibilities yet, and he appears to

be cost-conscious as far as the undersigned can judge.

required of career personnel working in the Foreign Intelligence area and that he
should be permitted to hate his career designation changed to Fl, Mr, Piccolo should
also be given the opportunity to receive Agency training so that he might be better

SUBJECT + Acknowledgment of Evaluation Boant Functional Category

REIT RENCE : Evaluation Roard Precepts for Your Grade

1. Based upon an examination of your past assienments and duties,
and after considering likely future assimments, you have been placed
(subject to your signature below) in the functional category NG for
Evaluation Board purposes. Precise definitions of this category are
contained in the Fvaluation Board precepts for your:grade. This nlace-
ment is made in order that your performance, eeatheotential. and ~
career planning may be judced against officers s: ‘larly: placed | pro-
fessionally, YOU ARI URGED TO STUY THI PRECEPTS AD. i
CASE CAREFULLY.

2. In general, you should consider the folloving;
a. Categories are sharply defined. Competition
is within categories, not between then, Thus,
a weak B/OG performance is not strengthened
by reclassifving it as B/0S.

b. A change in category after sustained performance
in a different category may cause a temporary
loss of momentum in your career advancement
until you have demonstrated proficiency in your
new assignment.

c. A category change should not be initiated for
th» period of a temporary, training or rotational
assignment unless a permanent change of career
track will follow,

3. I£ you believe that this is not the correct category for
you because the substantive nature of your Job more closely arproxi-
mates another category or because you have made a permanent change
of career track, please take the matter up through your command channel
to secure the cencurrence of vour component of assiymment or of vour
home hase component, as appropriate, to a change of vour catecory.
PreviousIv assigned and acknowledged categories will remin in effect
until a fully executed acknowledgment of change is received hy the
Career Management Staff.

4, Please sign and date this notification in the space provided
and retum it to vour Personnel Evaluation and Muagement Officer or to
your Personnel Officer.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, LA Division -

SUBJECT | Mr. Joseph S, Piccolo - Completion of Sénior
Operations Course 02/76

1, Mr. ‘Piccolo attended the Senfor Operations Course from 3 November
to 12 December 1975 (SOC #2/76), Individual student grades and class rankings
have not been used to evaluate student performance. The diverse background of
the students and the nature of the course material used {n the SOC preclude
formal testing. This memorandum attests to Mr. Piccolo's satisfactory comple~
tion of the course. .

2. During the six weeks of the course, 59% of the time was devoted to
subjects and activities directly related to operations, including 30% devoted .
to "hands-on" time with technical equipment and “on-the-street" practice of
tradccraft. 31% of the time was devoted-to material broadly categorized as
“ops management," including about 10% on the Soviet and China targets. The
final 10% of the time was, devoted to subjects categorized as "management over=-
view and ops. support," which consisted of mectingn with DO divieton and staff ;
chiefs and viaits to labs and other ops support facilities in the Headquarters eee
area, The| | officera in the class ranged in grade from GS-12 to GS-14 :
(average grade 12.9), average age was 43.6 (Mr. Piccolo's age ia 40). The : ‘
class menbers' average years of Agency service was 16.8, and their average 2
years of overseas service was 9.2.

3. The six weeks, normally 30 days of instruction time, wis shortened
to 28 days by the Thanksgiving Day weekend, Of these 28 days, Mr, Piccolo
spent six days in intensive training in Persuasion and Manipulation Skills as -
taught He_spent approximately another eight and_one-half
days on technical tradecraft
and usage) and atrect tradecraft

etc.) including three daya intensive practice of these skilla in a Live
exercise conducted “Another ftve days vere spent at Headquarters

meeting with the chiefs of all DO divisions and ataffa, and visiting three
operational support laboratortes in the metropolitan area. The approximately
eight and one-half remaining days were consumed by a combination of miacel-
Jancous operations management subjects, student seminars, and term paper
writing (though the latter was accomplished mostly on the atudenta’ own time).
This running of the course waa keynoted by remarks by the ADDO, and the
Headquartera veek was climaxed by an hour and a half with the DDO, The guest
speaker at tho graduation dinner of SOC #2/76 was Agency Historian

Dr, Walter Pforzhetmer,

SUBJECT: Mr. Joseph S. Piccolo = Completion of Senfor Operations Course #2/76

4. Mr. Piccolo, as a 40-year-old CS-13/4, was at about the average age
for this class and slightly above average in grade. Although formal grades
are not given to graduates of the SOC, it was the consensus of DTS staff
inatructors involved in SOC #2/76 that Mr. Piccolo would almost certainly
rank number one in this particular group. Bringing to the class broad opera-
tional expe : Mr. Piccolo was an active participant in
the six-day and made contributions based on his own
operational past. The tradecraft instructors Who conducted the live problem
|_ described Mr. Piccolo as the best student-in street tradecraft.
One of the Course Coordinators commented that Mr. Piccolo, "exhibited, more
than any of the others, the ability to lead the group." Mr. Piccolo's term
paper on the subject of how| I J]
was careful and thorough and was described by the panel as "an excellent overall
plan.” To a man of Mr. Piccolo’s experience, at least some of the course may
have. seemed a Little basic or redundant, but he never let it show, and always
took part with the same enthusiasm as the more junior members of the class.

5. A copy of thie menorandum 1a being placed in Mr. Piccolo's offictal
personnel file. : :
