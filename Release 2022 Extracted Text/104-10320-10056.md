I questioned Scott Breckinridge

about it.

He said that the Id

staf: did not have a list, and

he doubted whäther CI Ops did.

(FYI:. D'Unger has raquested

Warren Commission documents

from

NARS. MARS has steered him toward

the igency Is a couple of classific

I have attached a copy of ir

Crooks' speed letter, which

provides an informative and

responsive answer to Mr. D'Ung

We should hold the line on the

-proper classification of the

documents.

This should then b

extended to the list of docu-

ments, since the subject

entries were deliberately made

as informative as possible.

Thus we cite exemptions (b)(1)

(properly classified) and

(b) (3) (sources and methods).
