with @ limited muxber of people. We believe the direction of the

station is of high caliber, but not is

carefully directed at priority targets. Under current personnel |

ceilings, there is little hope of increasing the manpower avail-

able for this critical effort. Ths, both Headquarters and the

station met carefully place enphasis on assignuent of priorities
those

and upon selective execution of the activities to met
priorities.

Quasnination for Operations ;

$. The Mexico City Station approaches the classic type station
in opportunities and in operations. It has high-level |
operations, unilateral operations, joint operstiona with the host
government, and Soviet, Satellite, Cuban, anf indigenous Communist
Party operations. It fies local collaborative liaison with other
U.S. agencies: the State Department, the Federal Burea of Investi-
gation, the Inmtgration and Naturalization Service and the military.
fo accomplish this wide range of tasks, the station bribes anche
into the Soviet Branch, Cuban Branch, Satellite Branch,

Action Branch, Communist Party Branch, and an operational catch-all
vhich is called the “Operational Support Branch." This latter
branch is headed by a senior operations officer who has tvo assist~
ents, but the branch in reality is an extension of the chief of
station's personal clandestine capabilities, giving force end
effect to that facet of the chief of station's personality as an
operator. ‘The deputy chief of station, in afdition to his edmin-
istrative duties, also personally handles the operations of three
