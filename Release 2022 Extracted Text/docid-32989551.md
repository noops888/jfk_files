INTRODUCTION

Martin Luther King, President of the Southern Christian

Leadership Conference (SCLC), is recognized by the American

people generally as one of the foremost spokesmen for this

country's 22,000,000 Negroes. Consequently, he enjoys a wide

public image as a moral leader of great stature and conviction.

In 1965, for instance, the year after he received the Nobel

Peace Prize, he was the sixth living man "most admired" by

Americans, according to the Galluo Poll.

(Facts on File, 1966, p. 40)

Clergymen of all faiths share this admiration of

King, as shown by the following quotations:

... (He) has been the conscience of our people."

--Ihe Reverend Francis B. Sayre, Jr.,

Dean of Washington Cathedral,

March 31, 1969

(Evening Star, 4/1/6S)

"...He is one of the great men of our times...I

salute my brother in Christ."

-The Right Reverend Arthur Lichtenberger,

Presiding Bishop of the Protestant

Episcopal Church, October, 1964

(Washington Post,

10/15/64, P. A 17,

a "man of God"

and a Christian.

Rustin and Wachtel decided to have King utilize his

prestige as a winner of the Nobel Peace Prize by writing to

President Fo Chi Minh of North Vietnam, to leaders of the Soviet

Union, and to President Johnson about bringing the war in

Vietnam to an end. This action, they felt,

would cast an imaga

Anti-Vietnam War Resolution

The executive board of the SCIC met in Miami during

the Spring of 1956. The sessions of this two-day conference

ran into the early morning hours, because efforts were being

made to draft a resolution on the war in Vietnam.

Finally,

there appeared to be general agreement. Homever, coaupey

Levison and Harry Vachtel continued to argue for a stronger

resolution than was presented. They wanted a resolution

that mould condemn participation by United States troops in

Vietnan.

The conference finally adopteda resplution calling

on the Government to desist aiding the military junta in Fiethan

and to consider seriously a prompt mitcaramal.

This was the beginning of Levisons infiuence i

Levison and King met on July 19, 1967, to

discuss the Newark, New Jersey, riot. Levison suggested at

that King advocate a roger program with dramatic qualities

similar to the Works Project Administration of the 1930's.

This new fans program, implemented by the Federal Government,

would employ jobless youth. king agreed that Levison's idea

had merit and said he would publicly call upon the Federal

school boycotts, and a camp-in at Washington, D. C. All

this would be done to force muzirited-bates Congress to take

communist influence in the racial situation,

he desired that consider

ation be given to placing a technical surveillance on Martin Luther

King, Jir, leader of the SeLC, aud Clarence B. Jones,

a New York City

attorney who is closely associated with sing and involved in the

racial movament, The Attorney General at that time indicated ine

was

not concerned with the repercussions if it should ever becono

known that such surveillances had been put into effect and that he

thought it advisable to have complete coverage.

However, when such

,a request vas made ai the Attorney General on 7/22/63, he

rejected

coverage on King.

King resides at 563 Johnson Avenue, N.F., Atlanta, Georgia

and is president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conierence,

330 Auburn Avenue, Atlanta.

OBSERVATIONS:

TO

:J. Edgar Hoover, Director

Federal Bureau

of Investigation

DATE: September 20; 1963

Marsha11,

Assistant Attorney General

Civil Rights Division

JUBjECT: Hunter Pitts O*De11

This relates to your letterhead memorandum

of september 5 to the Attorney General, selating told if?

Hunter Pitts O°Del1 and the related prior memoranda.

I appreciate your having sent copies of these to me.

• This matter had been brought to the attention

of DI. King some time

ago by me, but in accordance

with conversations which the Attorney General

had with Courtney Evans, it was not felt to be wise

in view of the sources

of the Bureau's informa-

tion to state that I knew O Dell to be under conmunist,

influence or control at any time.

I did inform

DI. King

and

two members

of his

organization

Reverend Andrew Young and Reverend Wyatt Walker

some time ago - that since O'Dell was believed by

many people to have had Communist connections, his

association with their organization was not in the

best interests of the organization.

At that time, inconclusive steps were taken

to remove O Dell, and his job with

the Southern

Christian Leadership Conference was

changed.

In

response

to direct questions whether

I had hard evidence

of O'Dell's Communist connections, however, I replied

that I was not in a position to give any.

Following further conversations. with MI.

Evans in June, however, I brought the matter to the

attention of DI. King very explicitly in my office

on

the morning of June 22 prior to a scheduled meeting

which DI. King had with the President.

This was

done at the direction of the Attorney General.

Later that morning both the Attorney General and

the President separately strongly urged Di. King

that there should be no further connection

between

O:Dell and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.

-DI. King stated that the connection would be

lended.

Thereafter, the Attorney General and I

both

received copies of the attached letter, dated

July 3, 1963,

from DI. King

to O*Dell.

On

the same occasion, I also informed DI.

King that our information

was that Stanley Levison

was a secret member of the Communist Party.

This was also done after conversations with MI. Evans

pIior. to the meeting with DI. King, and was done at

the direction of the Attorney General and the

President.

Prior to that time, again based upon

talks between the Attorney General and Mr. Evans at

which I was present, it had been decided that it

was not in the best

interest of the United States to

inform DI. King

that we had any firm information

that Levison was

under Communist control. . I had,

however, on a previous occasion, warned DI. King

about any association with levison,

basing

warning upon doubts about Levison's loyalty to the

United States.

I thought you should have this additional

information for your file.

SECURITY MATTER - COMMUNIST

COMMUNIST INFLUENCE IN

RACIAL MATTERS

The Attorney General spoke to me with reference to dire

memorandum of October 18, 1963, recommending a technical surveillance

on the office of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference at Atlanta, l

Georgia. It is noted that last week the Attorney General authorized

similar coverage on the residence of Martin Luther King, Jr., President

of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.

The Attorney General is apparently still vacillating in his

position as to technical coverage on Martin Luther King and his organization,

it being recalled that he had initially suggested such coverage and then

changed his mind and felt it might be inadvisable.

The Attorney General said that he is still uncertain in his own

mind about this coverage. I reminded him of our previous conversation,

wherein he was assured that all possible would be done to insure the security

of this operation.

The Attorney General advised that he was approving the

October 18, 1963, memorandum but asked that this coverage and that on

King's residence by evaluated at the end of 30 days in light of the results

secured so that the continuance of these surveillances could be determined

at that time.

This will be done.

King is a national figure prominent in the racial movement.

He has been involved with and is taking advice from well-known

communist figures.

This source provides information regarding his

mi-i

contact with these individuals as well as intormation as to what li

they advise

him to do. A considerable amount of the information

we have received from this source has been furnished to the

White House, the Attorney General, and other Government agencies.

This source has provided a great amount of information concerning

racial disorders in the South, racial riots in Northern cities as

well as racial activities at both major political party conventions.

In addition, this source has provided information (which has been

furnished to the White House) regarding King's irmoral extramarital

activities.

The type of information received through this source

is not available through any other source.

There is no prosecutive action pending concerning King ard

on the basis of the information wehave, prosecutive action appears to

be unlikely in the foreseeable future.

Atlanta also requested 2 recorders for use in conjunction with these

On 10/21/63 the Attorney General approved installation of

tesurs on the scuc at its current address or ai any future address

to which it nay move.

There are currently 4 tesurs in operation on

the SCLC which were installed 11/8/63. With the addition of the 3

uncovering the extensive communist infiltration and donination of

Atlanta desires to utilize SA Kusch to install these

Atlanta anticipates that the services of an additional

investigative clerk vill be required during normal office hours of

the SCLC to insure full coverage in the event the additional cesurs

are authorized..

OBSERVATIONS:

Since the Attorney General has already authorized technical

coverage of the scLe and king, additional authority is not necessary

• since this is merely an extension of current coverage brought about

by additional telephone service within the SCLC.

RECOILIENDATIONS:

1. That the attached letter to the Atlanta Office be

and

that the Atlanta Office will be zavised by separate communication

conceining the utilization of SA lusch to handle the installation and

the additional equipment requested fron the Laboratory.

2. That this menorandum be referred to the Administrative

Division for a determination

as to whether SA Kusch is available and

to the Laboratory in order that the equipment requested may be

Division coordinate its findings regarding the avcilability of sa kusci

Re: Martin Luther King

Informanion received by lus Agent indicated thai the above

caplioned, during the early morning hours of April 27, 1964,

had been laying up with a local winite prostitute and the prostilute

had picked up a $100 reward for her services. This Agent, through

informants, managed to pick up the name and number of this white

prostitute and decided to check the above information out for what

it might be worth.

Now, normally a situation like the one mentioned above wouldn't

be considered as anything new, but due to the above captioned's

position as a God-fearing man of the cloth and respected leader of

the NAACP, it was decided that perhaps a casual inquiry made to the

prostitute in question might shed an interesting side light to King's

. extra curricular activities.

This Agent phoned the above mentioned prostitute at about 11:45pm

on May 15, 1964 and spoke to a girl named Gail, who agreed to meet

this Agent at a designated spot on South Fifth Street. However, due

to ner being called out at about the same time as this Agent calleu

her, the meeting eventually came off at about 3 a.m. on May 16, iç4.

Following is the information that Gail gave this Agent and, 1 write it

as she told it.

Gail stated that abot 2 a.m. on April 27, 1961 she las culled 0y

New Frontier Hotel and approached Clara Ward in the lobby. After

introducing herseif to Gail, Clara Ward landed her S100 and said " 1

have a couble of friends in town that would like to meet you and have

you take care of them!" Clara Ward then stated that ine reason she was

paying Gail the 5100 was because these. two men did not believe in

paying a girl for her services and for Gail to keep quiet about receiving

any money.

Re: Marlin Luther King, et al

Dale: May 18, 1964

Clara Ward then took this prostitute, Gail, to the Sands Holel

bar where they had a drink, then Clara Ward made a bione call

and shortly thereafter, Rev. Martin Luther King approached them

at the bar and they both accompanied him to his room in the Sands

Hotel. Clara Ward introduced Gail to the Rev. King as a very good

friend who worked as a dancer in the line at the Tropicana.

Gail stated that she, the Rev. King and Clara Ward all sat down in

his room and started drinhing Vodku and Gin drinks and the Rev. ing

slarted telling about his "juice" around the country, winich Gail siatra

was apparently told to impress her on what a big man the Rev. King

was. After a short time drinking and bragging, the Rev. King called,

by phone, to another room where as he said, "my partner is staying,

sleeping off a drunk", and spoke to "his partner", with the following

remark, "don't call me a black son of a bitch but get your damned

ass down to my room because I have a beautiful white broad here".

He then hung up and told Gail that he, the partner, told him he would

be down pretty soon.

At this time both the Rev. King and Clara Ward striped naked

and told Gail to do the same. Gail stated that she had another drink

and then stripped naked and sat down on a chair. At this time, the

Rev. King went down on his knees and started nibbling on her right

breast, while Clara Ward did the same with her left breast. Garl

then stated, "I guess the Reverend got tired of that and but his head

down between my legs and started nibbling on 'that". After a while

he got up and told Clara Ward to try some of it, so Clara Ward went

down on Gail for awhile. Gail stated,

"I think Clara Ward is queer".

(The understatement of the year).

The good Rei. King then luid Gail on the bed and iii cicurise

wilh her while Clara Ward sal is in the chair and unched the nich.

Aflei what Gail stated seemed like hours, King rolled off and licit

Re: Marlin Luther King

Date: May 18, 1964

Gail then stated that she was getling scared as they were pretty

drunk and all using fillhy language and at last she toid Clara Wara

she would have to go. Clara Ward then lold King that as Gail had

to rehearse the following morning, they would have to leave. The

Rev. King then whispered in Gail's ear, "I would like to try you

sometime again if I could get you away from Clara". At this time

Gail and Clara left and had another drink at the bar in the Sands

before parting company.

Gail stated to this investigator that "that was the worst orgy

I've ever gone through" and added that a few days later Clara Ward

called her on the phone and asked her to come up to her, Clara's,

room for a few drinks later in the evening, which Gail stated she

refused to do.

The foregoing is a blow by blow account of the Rev. King's extra

curricular activities during his stay here in our fair city, which

leads me to believe that the good doctor doesn't exactly practice

what he preaches, or does he?

As you are avare King has been in close association with

individuals having Comnunist Party backgrounds since his rise to

prominence in the civil rights field. Among such individuals

is his princip advisor Stanley Levison, a long-time secret

conmunist whose membership in the Conmunist Party, USA, has been

established as late as July, 1963. Clarence Jones, another close

advisor to king, was a former member and in a position of leadershir

in the Labor Youth League, a communist front organization.

PURPOSE:

Attached for your approval is a memorandum to

the Attorney General requesting a telephone surveillance

of Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC),

Atlanta, Georgia, in an effort to obtain intelligence

of their plans for massive civil disobedience in the

Nation's Capitol and 10 to 15 cities throughout the

United

States in the Spring of 1968.

BACKGROUND:

On December 13, 1967, you approved an airtel

which was directed to Atlanta Office requesting them to

conduct a survey as to the feasibility of instituting

a secure telephone surveillance of SaLC's headquarters,

Atlanta, Georgia. By communication dated December 20, 1967,

Atlanta recommends installation and advises it can be

accomplished with full security.

OBSERVATIONS:

Since SCLC's President, Martin Luther King, JI.,

has urged massive civil disobedience throughout the country

in an effort to spur Congress into action to help the

plight of the Negro, it is felt that we need this

installation to obtain racial intelligence information

RE: SENATOR HUGH SCOTT

(R - PENNSYLVANIA)

PROPOSED BILL TO COMMEMORATE

MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

Your attention is directed to the attached clipping from

yesterday's "Washington Daily News" indicating that Senator Hugh Scott

of Pennsylvania proposed that one million bronze commemorative medals

be struck in honor of Martin Luther King. Senator Scott indicated he

would introduce a bill to authorize the medals and "a gold medal to be

presented to Dr. King's widow." According to the article, the medals

would be sold at cost to the Reverend Martin Luther King,

Jr. Fund

for Education at Morehouse College in Atlanta.

Senator Scott was first elected to the House in 1940 and

was re-elected to seven additional terms. He was in the Navy for two

years during the war and was first elected to the Senate in 1958, being

re-elected in 1964.

Over the years we have had very cordial relations with

Senator Scott, and the Director has regularly written him on his

re-elections.

He gave a tribute to the Director on the latter's 35th

Anniversary. The Director sent him an autographed copy of "A Study

of Communism" in 1963.

In addition, on May 11, 1964, the Director thanked Senator

Scott for his splendid comments on the Senate floor with regard lo we

Director's administration of the FEI. On July 15, 1966, the Dirce:or

sent Senator Scott a letter in connection with the latter's operation at

Bethesda Naval Hospital.

On May 3, 1965, according to a confidential source,

Martin Luther King participated in a panel discussion two days before

in a panel commemorating Law Day sponsored by the Federal Bar

Association. It was reported that Senator Scott was in attendance at

this meeting and was "fawning" over King who gave the impression during

his speech of trying to justify disobedience to the law.

M. A. Jones to Bishop Informal Memo

RE: SENATOR HUGH SCOTT

As indicated above, Senator Scott has always been very

friendly. In the recent past, he has been sympathetic to the Bureau's

viewpoint in connection with the Safe Streets and Crime Control Bill

now pending on the Hill.

RECOMMENDATION:

In view of Senator Scott's friendly and cooperative attitude

over the years, it is recommended that Mr. DeLoach brief him on a most

confidential basis as to the background of Martin Luther King. Obviously,

Scott has been "hoodwinked" as to King's true background.

APPROAR OF WIRE TAPS AND MICROPHONES

BY ROBERT F. KENNEDY -

Specific approval of wire tap on Martin Luther King

Article by Drew Pearson and Jack Anderson,

•Friday, 5/24/68

Jack Anderson called and stated he wanted to speak

in confidence. I told him iû it concerned an official

matter i could not agree with this stipulation. He stated

he merely wanted to tip me off that Drew Pearson will have

an article on triday, 5/24/60, alleging that former AG Bobby .:

Kennedy ordered the

IBI to place a wire tap on Martin Luthes

King.

He stated the article would probably hurt Kennedy a

great deal.

I told Anderson we would have no comment concerning

such an artacle; however, that I felt he was doing us a

great aisservice inasmuch as the

article would certainly

acy up Negro sources of information who have been friendly

¿ to the IsI.

Anderson stated he and Pearson were well aware of

this fact; however, they felt that kennedy should receive a

daach blow prios to the oregon primary.

I told him that, as

he had been advised once before, the fBi would not become

involved in bitter political struggles and that the record

should be quite clear concerning this fact. Anderson said

he well understood our position, and that he hoped Pearson's

¡column would not alfect the rBl

too much. I told him that

Anderson

asked me is the FBI had disseminated a report

concerning King's communist affiliations aid sex life as of

Fabzuary of March 29, 1968. I told him I would make no comment.

He sinted he knew

such a report was in existence and

We did disseminate an FBI report on King dated 3/12/68.

He asked me If the rumor was true that was going around Washingtor

to the effect that Bobby Kennedy had specifically asked the FBJ.

I asked him what prompted his question.

He

replied that he had heard about this several times and, as a matter

pi jaci, a statement had appeared in a recent newspaper article.

I reminded Weisl that Messrs. Gale,

nicandrews, and i hac

briefed him regarding all activities

pertaining

to Bobby Kennedy's

requests for microphones and telephone taps during his tenure as

Attorney General.

I stated this briefing: as he should recall;

concerned the basis on which the Department pleaded immunity in the

civil suit against our agents in Las Vegas, Nevada.!

Weisl stated he remembered the briefing and, as a matter

of fact, this was when the information first came to

his attention.

I asked Meist why he was now asking me this spacific question.

He replied because Drew Pearson had found out about this matter ano

probably vould print it in order to embarrass Bobby Kennedy.

I isked Weisl if he had discussed this matter with Drew

Pearson.

He replied in the affirmative and stated his father,

Ed Weisl, Si., had also discussed the matter with Pearson.

the IBI would have any objections to this matter being

brought out before the public.

I told him it appeared as if the

matter had already been brought out before the public. I stated

he should keep several things in mind, i.e., (1) regardless of how

such an article was written, a segment of the Negro population oi

the

United States would still feel very harshly toward the rDI and

Mr. Tolson

the rBI had accumulated a number of tapes on King,

as a result of

the utilization of microphones. Weist stated that Pearson would

obviously indicate that Bobby. Kennedy had ordered the FBI to take

this action.

I told "eist that, nevertheless, certain Negro groups

would still blame the FBI, whether we were ordered to take suc

action or not.

Weisl stated he would try to keep the above matter from

being printed, it the rbi felt so strongly about it. I told him

we held no. briet for Kennedy, in view of the shoddy way in which

he had treated the FBI; however, we did not want to be involved

in any political maneuvers and

action of this nature would most

certainly concern politics. Weisl stated he would try to keep

this

from appearing.

Richard Harwood did include in his recent article on the

Director a statement that the FBI had several tapes on Martin Luther

King, as a result of the utilization of microphones. This fact has

appeared in

a number of other nevspapers.

Apparently Weisl

has discussed this matter with Pearson-Pearson desiring to print

lthe facts in order to embarrass Kennedy.

The record is quite clear, through the medium of memoranda

written by former employee Courtney Evans, that

Kennedy

first

requested electronic coverage; however, Evans succeeded in talking

him out of it.

Several months later Evans ayproached Kennedy and

permission for such coverage, at which time kennedy approved

this coverage.

While an expose of such facts could obviously hurt

seandpolnsuck action would also harm the FBI from a public relations

We, therefore, should have no part in it and should

(discreetly discourage such action if brought to our attention.

ACTION -

If such an article is printed by Pearson, we should

follow a strict "no comment" policy.

MARTIN LUTHER KING AT NATIONAL CATHEDRAL

MARCH 31, 1968

I need not pause to say how perfectly delightful

it is to be here this morning, to have the opportunity of

standing in this very great and

significant pulpit, and I

do want to express my deep personal appreciation to Dean

Sayre and all the Cathedral clergy for extending the

invitation. It is always a rich

and rewarding experience to

take at least a brief break from our day-to-day demands in

the struggle for freedom and human dignity and ability and

enjoy envolvement in worship which concerns friends and

goodwill all over our nation. Certainly there's always a

deep and meaningful experience to be in a worship service. so,

for many reasons I'm happy to be here today. I'm going to use

as a subject from which to preach this morning, "Remaining

Awake Through a Great Revolution." The text for the morning

is found in the Book of Revelation. There are two passages

there that I would like to quote from the l6th chapter of that

Book, "Behold, I make all things new," - "Former things are

passed aray.".

I'm sure that most of you have read that

interesting story from the pen of Washington living entalita,

"Rip Van Winkle." The one thing we usually remember about the

story is that Rip Van Winkle slept twenty years, but there is

-NW-68262-Đoeld:32989551_Page_135

---

## Page 136

another point in that story that all too many people overlook.

There was a sign in the inn from which Rip went up into the

mountains for his long sleep. When Rip Van Winkle went up

into the mountains, the sign had a picture of King George, III,

of England. When he came down twenty years later, the sign

had a picture of George Washington, the first President of

the United States. Rip Van Winkle looked up at the picture of

George Washington, and looking at the picture, he was amazed.

He was completely lost. He knew not who he was. And this

reveals to us the most striking thing about the story of Rip

Van Winkle is not merely that Rip slept twenty years, but that

he slept through a revolution. While he was peacefully

snoring up in the mountains, a revolution was taking place

that, in point, would change the course of history. Rip knew

nothing about it, he was asleep. Yes, he slept through a

revolution. One of the great tragedies of life is that all

too many people find themselves living amidst a great period

of social change and yet they fail to develop new attitudes,

the new mental responses that the new situation demands. They

end up sleching through a revolution. As a matter of fact.

there is a great revolution taking place in the world toda.

In a senso it 1s a tripie revoiation; that is, a sochario..en.

revolution in weaponery with the emergence of atomic and

nuclear weapons of warfare. Then there is the human-rights

2

-NW 68262_Docld:32989551. Page 136

---

## Page 137

revolution, with the freedom explosion that is taking place

all over the world. Yes, we do live in a period where

changes are taking place. There is still the voice crying in

the abyss of time saying, Behold, I make all things new.

Former things are passed away. Now, when anything new comes

in history, it brings with it new challenges and new

opportunities. I would like to deal with the challenges that

we face today as a result of this triple revolution that is

taking place in the world today. First, we are challenged to

develop a world spectacle. No individual can live alone. No

nation can live alone; and anyone who feels that he can live

alone is sleeping through a revolution. The world in which

we live is geographically one. The challenge that we face

today is to make the one term appropriate. Now, it is true

that the geographical oneness in the days to come will be to

a large extent through modern man's scientific ingenuity.

Modern man, through his scientific genius has been able to go

long distances through great time and change. Our jet planes

have travorsed in minutes distances that once toce rocks aud

even months. All of this tells us that our world is a neighbor-

hord. Throurh our scientific and technological genius ve lave

made of this world a neighborhood; and yet we have not set the

ethical committments to make us a brotherhood. Somehow and

in some way we got to do this.

We must all learn to live

-NW 68262-Docld:32989551 Page 137

---

## Page 138

together as brothers, or we will all perish together as

fools. We are tied together in a single bond of destiny,

thwarting any escape from the network of mutuality. Whatever

people want directly, affects all indirectly. For some

strange reason that I can never be what I ought to be until

you are what you ought to be; and you can't be what you ought

to be until I am what i ought to be. This is the way God's

universe is made. This is the way of its structure. John

Donne caught it years ago and finished in graphic times,

"No man is an island entire unto himself. Everyman, is a

piece of the continent, a part of the main . . " and he goes

on toward the end to say "For everyman's death diminishes me

because I am a part of mankind. Therefor, never send to know

for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee." We must seize

this, believe it and live by it, if we are to remain awake

through a great revolution. Secondly, we are challenged to

eradicate the last vestiges of racial injustice from our

nation. I just say this morning that racial injustice is still

the hlach man's burdrn and the thite nan's share. It is an

unhappy truth that racis" is a vay of life, and a vast majority

oi inile mericans; socion and unspoken, acknoritage and deny

subtly. Sometimes not so subtly. The disease that"

raci. sm

permeates and poisons the whole body politically. I can see

nothing more urgent for America to work passionately to get

rid of the disease of racism. Sonething positive must be done.

NW 68262 Docld:32989551 Page 138

## Page 139

Everyone must share in its guilt; individuals and institutions.

The Government must certainly share the guilt; individuals

must share the guilt; even the Church must share the guilt.

We must face the facts that 11:00 o'clock on Sunday morning

when ve stand to sing, "In Christ, there is no East nor West, "

we stand in the most segregated island of America. The hour

has come for everybody from all of the institutions to disect

from this body its cancer, and work to get rid of racism. And

now as we have to do it, we must honestly admit certain things.

We must get rid of certain myths that are constantly being

disseminated all over our nation. One is a myth of time.

There is a notion that only time can solve the problems of

racial injustices. There are those who often appear to say

to the Negroes that are in the white community, "hy don't

you slow up? Stop pushing things so fast. Only time can

solve the problems. If you will just be

nice and patient and

continue praying, in a hundred or two hundred years the

problem will work itself out." There is an answer to that

myth: It is that time is neutral. It can be used either

constructively or destructively. I am sorry to say this

mornin; that I am arsolutel! convinced that the forces of ili

will in our lutiun, the citroit insanisis in til bainin, ti

people on the wrong ground use time much more clieciively dau

the forces of good will. It may well be that we will have to

impeach this generation. Not merely fos patriotic words and

devout actions of the bad people, but for the fallen silence

NW 68262 Docld:32989551 Page 139

## Page 140

...

and indifference of the good people who sit around and wait

on time.

Somewhere we will come to see that human progress

never rolls in on wheels of inability. It comes through

tireless efforts and persistent work of dedicated individuals

who are willing to be co-workers of God. Without this hard

work, time itself becomes an ally of the primitive forces of

social stagnation.

So we must help time and realize that

the time is always right to do right. Now there is another

myth that still gets around. It is kind of over-reliance on

the boot-strap philosophy. Now those that still feel that

if the Negro is to rise out of poverty, if the Negro is to

rise out of slum conditions, if he is to rise out of degradation

and segregation, he must do it all by himself and so they say

the Negro must lift himself by his own bootstraps. They never

stop to realize that no other ethnic group has been a slave

on American soil. The people who say this never stop to

realize the debt they owe us who were kept in slavery 244 years.

In 1863 the Negro was told he was free as a result of the

Enancipation Proclamation being signed by Abraham Lincoln. He

wer not sivon ant irad to naie that froco beaningácl. It

vas something like keeping a person in prison for a numer of

sears and suddenly a scovering that that person was not guilty

of the crime for which he was convicted, and just go up to

him and say now you are free. But you don't give him any

crutch against time. You don't give him any money to get some

clothes for his back or shoes for his feet. Yet this is the

NW 68262 Docld:32989551 Page 140

---

## Page 141

very thing that our nation did to the black man. It simply

set him free and just left him in ignorance, not knowing

what to do. And we all know that at the same time the

nation failed to do anything for the black man, through an

Act of Congress, it has given away millions of acres of land

west of the Mississippi which meant that it was willing to

share with the white man the tools of economic force and

grant pover to them. They sent men to teach them to farm.

Not only did they provide county agents but as the years

unfolded they provided low-interest rates so they could

mechanize their farms, and to this day, thousands of these

very persons have been seizing millions of dollars in federal

subsidies every year not to farm, and they are the very ones

who tell Negroes they must lift themselves by their own

bootstrays. It is all right to tell a man to lift himself

by his bootstraps. But it is a cruel jest to say to a shoe-

less man that he ought to lift himself by his own bootstraps.

We must come to see that the roots of racism are buried deep

in our country. And there must be something positive and

natura in cidci to sut ria of dil lac eirect of ravis: and

tragedy of racial injustices. And there is another thing

closely related to racis. that I should like to mention as

another challenge. We are challenged to rid our nation of the

word poverty. Like a monstrous octopus, poverty spreads its

nagging prehensal tenacles into hamlets and villages all over

the world. Two-thirds of the people of the world go to bed

hungry at night. They are ill-housed, they are ill-nourished.

I have seen it in Latin America; I have seen it in Africa;

I have seen this poverty in Asia. I remember some years ago,

Mrs. King and I journeyed to that great country known as

India. And I never will forget the experience. It was a

marvelous experience to meet and talk with the great leaders

of India and get to takwith and speak to thousands and

thousands & people all over that vast country. These

experiences will remain dear to me as long as the haunts of

memory linger. But I say to you this morning, my friends,

there are those in Christendom - when they see with their

own eyes literally millions of people are going to bed hungry

every night - when he sees with his own eyes God's children

sleeping on the sidewalks at night - In Bombay, more than a

million people sleep on the sidewalks every night. In

Calcutta more than 600, 000 sleep on the sidewalks everynight.

They have no beds to sleep in; they have no houses to go in.

He discovers

that

in our vast population, more than five

hundred million people, some 480 million, make an annual

income less than $9000 a year. Most of them have never seen

a doctor or nurse, and I know that we Americans say we are

budget establishing military bases around the world, rather

than basing our genuine concern and understanding in order

to alleviate poverty abroad. I would remind you in our

nation there are 40 million people who are poverty stricken.

I have seen them here and there. I have seen them in the

ghettos of the north. I have seen them in the rural areas of

the south. I have seen them in Appalachia. I have been in

the process of touring many areas of our country and I nust

confess it is some situation where I literally found myself

crying. I was in Marks, Mississippi the other day, which

is in Quitman county, the poorest county in the U. 's. I

tell you I saw hundred of little lack boys and girls walking

the streets with no shoes to wear. I saw their mothers and

their fathers trying to carry on the Head Start Program, but

they had no money. The Federal Government hadn't funded

them, they were trying to carry on... they raised a little

money here and there; trying to get a little food to feed

their children . . . trying to teach them something.

And I

saw mothers and fathers who said to me, not only were they

inclotned, but thes didn't set any kind of incone - no oii-

age pension - no welfare - they didn't get anything. I said.

"Hoi do you live?"

They said, "roll, we so arcund the

neighbors and ask for a little soething. Then the berry

season comes, we pick berries.

When the rabbit season comes,

we hunt and catch a few rabbits and that is howve get it."

I was in Newark and Harlem just this week and I walked into

the homes of welfare mothers. I saw such conditions - no

wall-to-wall carpets - wall-to-wall rats. So I stood and

talked and this welfare mother said to me even the landlord

won't repair the place.

"I have been living here 2 years.

He has not made a single repair." She pointed out how a little

boy was the victim of lead poisoning. She pointed out the wall

and ceiliugs falling, and the hole where the rats caue in

night after night. They have to stay awake to keep the rats

and roaches from getting to the children. I said how much do

you pay for this apartment. She said $125. I looked and said

to myself it isn't worth $60. Poor people are forced to pay

more for such living conditions. Tragedy rears so often.

These 40 million people are Embittered. Because America is

so affluent and so rich - because thee are expressways carrying

away from the ghettoes of the poor -

Jesus told a parable one day. He reminds us a man went to hell

because he didn't feed the poor. The man was Diabees (Phonetic).

He was a rich man. And there was a poor man in Nazareth who was

lui only a pudi wan, mit ius sich. do ind soes did drei im

He manayed to

about it - Now when he died, Diabees went to hell - there was

10

NW 68262 Docld:32989551 Page 144

---

## Page 145

a rock between Lazarus and Diabees. There is nothing in that

parable that says that Diabees went to hell because he was

rich. Jesus never made the universal indictment against all

wealth. It is true that one day a rich young man came to him

and Jesus told him to sell all ... Jesus was prescribing

an individual surgery and not setting forth a universal

diagnosis. If you will look at that parable and all its

symbolists, you will renonber that the conversation took

place between heaven and hell. And the angels had long-

distance calls. It was Abraham talking to Diabees. Now Abraham

was a very rich man. If you go back in the old Testament, you

will see he was one of the richest men of his day. Diabees

didn't go to hell because he was rich. It was Diabees didn't

realize his wealth was an opportunity. It was not his riches

that separated him from brother Lazarus. Diabees went to hell

because he passed Lazarus every day and didn't really see him.

He went to hell because he allowed his brother to become in-

visible. Diabees went to hell because he maxinized the minimum

and minimized the maximum. And went to hell because he sought

There's nothing wrong with that. This is Averica of carturi:.

to help bridge the gulf between the have and the have nots.

The

question is whether America can do it. It has nothing to do

with poverty. What is new is that we now have the techniques and

resources to get rid of poverty. The real question is whether

we have the will. In a fewels, some of us are coming to

Government to adjust itself to the problem of poverty. We

read one day we hold these truths to be self-evident. That all

men are created equal. That they are endowed with their Creator

in certain inevitable rights. That among these are life,

liberty and pursuit of happiness. But if a man doesn't have a

job or income, he has neither life, nor liberty, nor possibility

for the pursuit of happiness. He merely exists. We are coming

to ask America to be true to huge promise of prophetic signs

years ago. We are coming to engage in traumatic non-violent

action to call attention to the growth between promises fulfilled.

it this way because it is our experience a nation doesn't move

around questions oi renuine quality, especially when the poor

is involved until it is confronted massively. A great

documentary is here to tell us that something should be done.

We met here sone jears ago in a Whit e House conference on civil

rights. le came out with the same recommendations that we will

about it. The President's Commission on technology,

automation and economic progress reconmended these things

some time ago. Nothing has been done. Even a Presidential

Board which was made up of mayors of other cities of our

country, the leading businessnen, have said have these

things done, still nothing has been done. Crime Commissions

have come out this report, just a few days ago. Nothing has

been done.

In summary, nothing will be done till people of

goodwill put their hearts and souls in motion. I believe

this will maie the difference. Yes, it will be a poor

peoples campaign. This is the question facing America.

Ultinately, a great nation is a compassionate nation. America

has not met its ouligations and its responsibilities to the

poor. One day we will have to stand before our God and history.

We will talk in terms of things we've done. Yes, we will be

able to say ve built gargantuan bridges to span the seas. VE

America will hear this before it is too late because today we

are fighting a war I am convinced that it is one of the most

unjust wars that has ever been fought in the history of the

world. Our involvement in the war in Vietnam has torn up

progress in Geneva

strengthened the military industrial

complex. It has strengthened the forces of reactionaries in

our nations. It has put us against the self-determination of

the vast majority of people. Put us in a position of

protection of a corrupt regime that is stacked against this

world. It played havoc with our domestic destiny. This day

we are spending $500, 000 to kill every Vietcong soldier and

every time we kill one, we spend about $500, 000: While we.

spend only $53 a jear for every person trying to rise in

poverty-stricken or so-called poverty programs which is not

even

a good skirmish against poverty. Not only that, it has

Korea, and a few others, this is where we are. Mankind must

put an end to war or war will put an end to mankind. The

best way to start is to put an end to the war in Vietnam

because if it continues, we will inevitably come to the

point of confronting China, which could lead the whole world

to nuclear annihilation. It is no longer a choice, my

friends, between violence and nonviolence. It is between

nonviolence and nonexistence and the alternative to this

armanent, the alternative to greater suspension of nuclear

tests, the alternative to strengthen the United Nations and

thereby disarming the whole world may well be a civilization

plunged into the abyss of nuclear holocaust. The world could

be transformed

into an inferno that even the mind of Dante

could not imagine - this is why I am raising my cause today -

orking wherever I can to arouse the conscience of the

nation. I remember so well when I first took my stand against

the war in Vietnam, how the critics took me on. They had

their say in sometimes the most vicious raj. One day a news-

ought to change your position?. I looked at him and I had to

say, Sir, I am sorry you don't lnow me. I am not the

consensus leader. There comes a time when one must take the

position that it is neither political nor popular but he must

do it, because conscience tells him it is right. I believe

today that there is the need for all people of good will to

come with an active conscience. Say, in the words of the

old Negro spiritual, ve ain't gonna study war no more. This

is the challenge facing nodern nan. Then we close by saying

we have twelve days ahead to struggle for justice and peace.

I would not yield to a politician of despair. I'm gonna

naintain hope. As we come to lashington in this campaign,

the caras are stacked against us. This time we will really

confront a goal line. God, grant that we will be lile David

who stood up against Goliath in justice. Make America the

truly the great America that it is called to be. I'll say to

you that I'll go this spring and I believe ve're going to set

there. We have been scorned, but we are a people whose destin!

SPEECH BY MARTIN LUTHER KING

BROADCAST •BY STATION WOL AT 8:30 P.M. 2 3/31/68

UNMAN: (Commentator on WOL) Black ministers from around the

country recently met to attack the problems of community

leadership. We join Dr. KING as he delivers the closing

speech to this group.

KING: We have discussed many issues; we have deliberated; we

have had fellowship together, and we have heard many

eloquent, profound and passionate presentations. In

a real sense, for so many of us, this has been a mountaintop

experience. There are those transfiguring moments in

life when we do ascend a mountaintop, where we are inspired,

where we are lifted and where we feel a sense of eternity.

But I want to say to you today that in a few hours we

will be returning to the valley. The valley calls us.

We will be returning to valleys filled with men and women

who know the ache and anguish of poverty. We're going

to be returning to valleys filled with thousands and

thousanas of young people who lost faith in America.

We go back to a valiey filled with back peopie who aré

in moments of despair because of their circumstances

and ever again they unconsciously find themselves

crying out with PAUL (LAWRENCE DUNBAR) (ph) a crust of

bread and a corner to sleep in, a minute to smile, and

NW 68262 Docld:32989551 Page 152

---

## Page 153

an (

) to weep in, a pint of joy to a peck of

trouble, and never a laugh as the moans come double, and

that is life. Now these cries are in the valley that

we must go back to. The fact is that the vast majority

of Negroes in America are still perishing on a lonely

island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material

prosperity. Now you know what happens in the realm of

semantics that different words are used when you deal

with the poor, the oppressed, the separated. Whenever

you have massive unemployment in the black communities,

It's called a social problem. Whenever you have massive

unemployment in the white community, it's called a

depression. The fact is that that is a depression in the

black community. Now the other thing is whenever the

government provides opportunities and privileges for

white people and rich people, they call it subsidies;

when they do it for Negroes and poor people, they call

It welfare. The fact is that everybody in this country

lives on welfare. Suburbia was built with

• federally

subsidized credit and the highways that take our wite

brothers out to the sutiros were built mon icterint

subsidized money to the tune of 90 perceno. Everybody

is on welfare In this country. The problem is that we

- 2 =

NW 68262 Docld:32989551 Page 153

---

## Page 154

all too often have socialism for the rich and (

free enterprise capitalism for the poor; that's the

problem. As you know the economic problem is serious,

and this has made for a lot of despair, made for a lot

of bitterness, and a lot of anger in the black community;

the situation is getting worse everyday. This anger has

ended up in explosions of violence over the last few

summers, and yet I don't see a riot as the answer; they

don't pay off as from a practical point of view the

enormity of the suffering and the loss of life far outweigh

the gains that come as a result of our burned cities.

We have to face this ( ) fact that no substantive

change has come to America or to any city as the result

of a riot; the only thing we see 1s a quick token

poverty grant and maybe some water hydrant (squares)

or what have you, and that's about it; no substantive

change has come; no schools have moved toward more

quality integrated education as a result. The job

problem has not been solved as a result of the riots;

we have to face it. So I don't see this as an answer,

ans yet something has to be done to get this natior ts

see that It has a morai responsibility to see that everybody

In this country should have a job or an income. Years

ago America signed a huge promissory note and placed it

in its Declaration of Independence and talked about

all men being created equal, and then it went on to

say they are endowed by their Creator, and you know this

creed did not say some men, it said all men; it dian't

say all white men; it says all men which includes black

men. And it goes on to say something else which ultimately

distinguishes our form of government from other totalitarian

regimes; it said that each individual had certain basic

rights that are neither derived from or conferred by

the state. In order to discover where they came from,

it is necessary to move back behind the dim mist of

eternity, they are God-given. Now this is what the nation

said, but it hasn't lived up to that. Eight years from

now we will celebrate 200 years of independence in this

country, but I wonder if the black man will be able to

celebrate it. What life have we known? Too often It's

a life of unemployment, of misery and poverty. What

liberty have we known? Too often it is merely the

liberty io move iron one sium to another I don'ü inoi

If we can celebrate 1t eight or nine years from now. Now

we're going to dashingon and outrine our domande; dalro

going to the seat of government with an outline of derands;

now why do we have to go? Because, number one, we must

• 4 -

NW 68262 Docld:32989551 Page 155

## Page 156

find an alternative, the riots on the one hand and

timid supplication for justice on the other and find a

way to transmute the (

) waves of the ghetto into

a creative and constructive force. Well, that's one

reason we need to go; people are angry; people are

frustrated; they are bewildered, and you got to give an

outlet, so we need to go to Washington for that reason.

But the other reason is that this country never moves on

the question of civil rights or genuine equality for the

black man until it's made to move through pressure; it

just doesn't happen; I wish it did; I tell you the truth,

I'm tired of marching; I'm tired of going to jail; I'm

being very honest about it. Now everybody .... not

everybody but many people are saying that something

should be done about the slums, about

the economic

problems

that we face in the black community. I could

mention source after source; three Presidential commissions

have said it; they said everything that we gonna

. . .

everything that we will demand in Washington they have

already written down on paper and said it should be

done; the Committee or Technolonys suumation and Excionde

Progress said it; the White House Conference of Civil

Rights said it; after the Detroit riot a group was formed

called Urban Coalition with the mayors in most of

the big cities in our country, and even some of the

conservative mayors agreed that a massive program has

to come into being to provide jobs for everybody desiring

jobs; this is what the Urban Coalition came out with.

LEANSER (ph) had been one of the architects of it

and others, but you had on there some of the outstanding

businessmen, DAVID ROCKEFELLER, HENRY FORD, and you can

go right down the line. They have asked in a document

for everything that we'll be talking about in Washington.

"Newsweek" magazine, for the first time in its history,

broke from its past policies of not editorializing about

things Ilke this and said the time for action 1s now;

it's urgent and they recommended all the things about

that we are gonna be asking for. The

Harris poll

revealed that 68% of the American people feel that some

kind of massive program ought to come into being to

provide jobs for everyone desirous of working; 1t

revealed that 64% of the American people feel that slums

should be eradicated, and the communities rebuilt by the

people no live in ther inion would be anocher michie

job program. So lt seems there is a consensus in tre

nation about this thing, and yet our Congress is

sitting around fiddling while the cities are burning.

They aren't going to do a single thing until we act and

- 6 -

NW 68262 Docld:32989551 Page 157

---

## Page 158

until we act massively, until we create a non-violent

crisis in this nation, and we are organizing right now

some 15 communities. We want to start.. out with 3,000

poor people who have been trained in the discipline of

non-violence, a thorough understanding of the demands

because they must be their demands, and that would be

the first wave, but you see you don't deal with hard-

hearted Pharoah with just one plague; you gotta keep

plaguing Pharoah, and we want waves and waves; we want

to start out with this group to be sure we have a disciplined

group to set the pattern and start out and then every day

and every week we just want waves of people coming in

bringing back grievances to Washington, saying we demand

change. This is a poor people's campaign, and those who

come who are a little more affluent will come in a

supportive role fighting for something for poor people.

And I urge you to do it because this is so much of our

ministry; this is what our ministry really means. You

know, you find it in your congregations; there are some

among us in the middle class who kind of float out of

the muddy watera and manage to eat Into the trach

flowing waters of the mainstream to a degree, and they

forget the stench of the back waters. We must not allow

our poorer brothers to be ignored; we, as preachers, must

join hands with them. PAUL KILLECK (ph) 1s right; sin

is separation. What represents it more than what we

see going on in our nation and in the world; we're

separated from ourselves,

separated from our neighbors,

and finally separated from God, and we are going to

Washington to try to deal with some of these problems,

and I said earlier it is not MARTIN LUTHER KING; It's

these

men around me, they do the work. They're men who

are humble but at the same time are dedicated to the

struggle; they are humble enough to take cuts in salaries;

I know what I'm talking about; they could make much more,

but they are doing this, and I don't mind asking you

that we need your support; I don't mind saying to you

today that we want you to leave here committed to this

church, SCLO 1s a church, a church in action. It Is not

no accident that most of the staff members and board

members and leaders are preachers in SCLC, and I am

not saying that other civil rights organizations should

not be supported, but I am saying that it is conviction

that preachers

are to be identified with soro becauce it

movement that It has never seen before. After we get

to moving, people will be coming from everywhere, and I

want some congressman to go to the window and lo0k out

and say, I see a lot of people on these highways. Where

are these people coming from? Who are they? And I want

someone to go in there and say they are coming up out of

Mississippi and Alabama. And I want somebody to go by

there and say they are coming from the ghettos of

Chicago, Detroit, Newark, New York, and Philadelphia.

I want somebody to say they are coming up out of great

trials; they are coming up out of years of neglect and

years of hurt. Who are they? These are they. And I

want somebody else to add, How many do you see out there?

And I want somebody just to say, I've been trying to

count them all, but it seems there need to be a number

that no man can number. I am fired up over Washington ...

••••

I want you to be in Washington with us, and I am

serious about this, the nation need this. And I am going

on to say thai these are days that demand for us as

clergymen a committed empathy. And a kind of dangerous

altruist. This is what is demanded of us today, a

dangerous altruism; we have got to give ourselves to

others. Jesus told another parable, "One day a man came

to Him and raised a lot of questions, and finally he

ended up saying who is my neighbor?" Now that question

-9 -

NW 68262 Docid:32989551 Page 160

---

## Page 161

could have very easily ended up in a philosophical debate.

But Jesus immediately pulled that question out of mid

air and placed it on a dangerous curve between Jerusalem

and Jericho,

and He talked about a certain man that fell

among thieves. You know the story, I don't have to go

through it. Finally the man who helped was a man of

another race. And I want to tell you a little about it

because I thought about it several times when I've been

in the Holy Lands. We ask the question: Why? ...dld the

Priest and the levi pass, and we come out with a lot of

imaginary ideas; sometimes we say that they were busy;

they had to get down to some ecclesiastical conference;

at other times we say that maybe they were following a

religious law which said that one was not to touch

a human body 24 hours before carrying on a religious

service, and then sometimes we say that this is a possibility

that maybe the men were going down to Jericho to organize

a Jericho road improvement association, and maybe they

felt that It was better to get at the problem, at the

cause of the source rather than get bogged down in an

Iralizual Grect. Trai's a possibillut, bur wen I thin

of this parable, my imagination goes somewhere eise. It

Is possible that these men went on the other side too

because they were afraid. And 1t's possible, you see,

- 10 -

NW 68262 Docld:32989551 Page 161

---

## Page 162

that when that Levi and Priest saw that man over there,

they said that maybe the man is just a faker, and maybe

he is just there to lure us over for quick and easy

seizure, and now they could have said that maybe the

robbers are still around, and we better get on and get

out of this situation. You know the words. The first

question that the Priest asked; the first question that

the Levi asked, was if I stop to help this man, what will

happen to me?

But the good Samaritan reversed the question:

If I do not stop and help the man, what will happen to

him? That is the ultimate question of life. So often

we are thinking about our jobs, our prestige, our

positions, and we find ourselves saying: If I take a

stand for this cause, what will happen to me? Will my

home get bombed? Will I get put in jail, or will I lose

my prestige in a particular group that I am in? That

is divorced from the problem. What will happen to me

Is so often the question that we raise. Yeah, will I

get put off the poverty board? What will happen to me?

But the great question is if I do not take a stand, what

wilt happen to our

• prichors and cur cistero mo are

suffering?

This is the question that we ali have to

weigh. I have weighed it in my life; I remember when I

first took my position against the war in Vietnam, almost

every newspaper in the country critized me. They don't

bother me too much now because too many people agree with

me, but when I took the position at first, 1t was a

low period in my life; I could hardly open a newspaper.

It wasn't only white people; it was Negroes. I must rush

on to my conclusion, but I want to say that we are

not only priests, but we are prophets. When God speaks,

who can but prophesy. Prophesy until slums and rat-

infested ghettos be a thing of the dead past and a dark

past. And every man will be able to live in a decent

sanitary house. Go out and prophesy until the vital

industries of Appalachia are revitalized, and the wrinkled

stomachs of Mississippi are filled. Go out and prophesy.

Until brotherhood will no longer be the end of a world,

at the end of a prayer, but the first item of business

on every legislative agenda. Go out and prophesy. Unt1l

our state houses and city halls will be filled with men

who will do justly, who will love mercy, and who will

walk humbly with their God. -Go out and prophesy. Until

## Page 164

It may mean standing amid the chilly winds of adversity,

but if we are followers of Jesus Christ, we know that

Christianity is not a euphoria of unannoyed comfort and

untroubled ease. What is it? It means taking up the

cause, taking it with all its (tich) and pack agony and

bearing that cross until it leaves the very marks of

Jesus Christ on your body and on your soul. We need to

take up the cross and follow Jesus, and finally as we

leave, we are going back to a valley that 1s filled with

despair; people have lost hope. We have the job of

transforming the fatigue of despair into the buoyancy

of hope.

When people lose hope, they die spiritually

and physiologically; keep the hope, the flame of hope

•burning. When people lose hope, they develop a disease

called give-up-itis, and they develop a kind of nihilistic

philosophy, which concludes that you can't change anything,

so let us go on and disrupt for disruption's sake;

let us go back and tell young men and young women that

that you need more water more efficiently and intelligently

we haven't tried it on a massive scale in the North.

By letter dated January 2, 1968, authority was

requested to institute a telephone surveillance on the

national headquarters of the Southern Christian Leadership

Conference, 330 Auburn Avenue, N.E., Atlanta, Georgia,

because its President, Martin Luther King, Jr., had

publicly announced he would lead a massive civil disọbe-

dience in the nation's Capital in the Spring of 1968. At

that time it was pointed out that these massive demonstrations

..could trigger riots.

By letter dated January 3, 1968, you declined

authorization of this installation because, "There has not

been an adequate demonstration of a direct threat to the

national security."

. In view of the recent developrents in Memphis,

Tennessee, where King led a march that ended in a riot, it is

reasonable to assume the same thing could happen later this

month. when King brings his "Poor People's March"

to Washington, D. C.

King, the day after the Memphis riot, was in

conference with his principal adviser and long-time secret

Communist Party rember, Stanley Levisan, concerning the

events of the preceding day. King stated he was considering

calling off the Washington march. Levison advised him to

continue his plans for the Washington narch.

RE: COMMUNIST INFILTRATION

SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE

100-438794

OBSERVATIONS:

.Since Levison, a long-time secret communist, is

counseling. King to continue the Washington march in spite of

the Memphis riot, it is felt we should again request the

Attorney General to authorize a telephone surveillance of

SCLC since it would

appear that a threat to the national

security now exists. We have a total of 53 telephone

surveillances in operation of which 34 are in Bureau cases

and 19 are at the written request of the State Department.

RECOMMENDATION:

The attached communication be directed to the

Attorney General the Memo tuatin grip acten

KNIGHT NEWSPAPERS

INTERVIEW WITH DIRECTOR

At 9:30 p.m., 6/24/69, Bill Barton of the Associated

Press, telephoned Bishop and advised that the Associated Press had learned

that the above captioned women reporters, who are with Knight Newspapers,

claim to have had an exclusive interview with the Director on Tuesday,

June 24, 1959. He stated that the only information about the contents of

the interview that he has is to the effect that Mr. Hoover informed these

reporters that "that racist columnist, Rowan" started the current

controversy regarding wiretapping, that Mr. Hoover allegedly stated

that Government agencies, "all over town" have been wiretapping, and

that they quote Mr. Hoover as stating that he did not wish to get into the

wiretapping of King but that former Attorney General Kennedy ordered it.

Barton wished to know if the alleged interview with Mr. Hoover was

authentic and if the FBI had any comments to make concerning it.

After checking with Miss Gandy and Mr. Tolson, Bishop

was advised by Mr. Hoover that we should have no comment to make

concerning this matter. Accordingly, at 9:55 p. 12., 6/24/69, Barton

of the Associated Press was advised that the FBI had no comment to make.

Attached hereto is a copy of a United Press International

(UPI) story which appeared in "The Washington Post" on June 25, 1969,

reporting on the alleged interview. Efforts are presently being made to

secure copies of the "Detroit Free Press" as soon as they arrive in the

Washington area, inasmuch as the full report of the alleged interview is

contained in that newspaper, according to the attached article.

RECOMMENDATION:

None. For information.

You will recall the following information I gave you earlier

concerning King's visit to Norway in Dec., 1964, which into, we

received from a reliable source.

Bayard Rustin, an aide to king who accompanied King to Norway

told two acquaintances of the following incident. (Rustin himself is a

convicted homosexual). According to Rustin, when he was in Oslo, Norway,

with Martin Luther King, Jr., in connection with the latter's receipt of

the novel Feave Fride, Rustin was called down by the police one morning

at 4:30 a.m. because the police had caught a prostitute coming out of

the room of A. D. King, Martin's brother. A. D. King attempted to evade

the police by running into Martin's room. The police accused the

prostitute of stealing money. The prostitute claimed, however, that she

was paid by the occupant of A. D. King's room. Rustin claimed uhat re

valked tre police out of arrestin; the prostitute in order to avoid

besmirching the reputation of Martin Luther King, Jr. Rustin also said

that members of King's entourage had naked girls running up and down the

corridors of a hotel where they stayed and that they were bringins white

prostitutes

into their rooms.

UNITED STATES DEPARIMENT OF JUSTICE

FED

AL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATI

WASHINGION, D.C. 20535

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

APRIL 19, 1968

Attorney General Ramsey Clark announced today that the

FBI has identitied James Earl Ray, an escapee from the Missouri

State Penitentiary, as Eric Starvo Galt, against whom a Federal

complaint was filed last Wednesday in connection with the fatal.shoot-

ing of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.

Director J. Edgar Hoover said that a systematic and

exhaustive search of latent fingerprints uncovered in the Dr. King

case against the fingerprints of the over 53, 000 persons for whom

"Wanted Notices" have been posted in the files of the FBI's Identification

Division led to the determination that Galt and Ray are identical,

Mr. Hoover said that Ray, who is 40 years of age, was

reported missing from the Missouri State Penitentiary at Jefferson

City, Missouri, on April 23, 1967. He had been received at that

institution on march 17, 19CO, to serve a 20-year sentence folowing

conviction in St. Louis for armed robbery and for operating a motor

vehicle without permission of the oimer.

NW 68262 Docld:32989551 Page 202

---

## Page 203

In September, 1966, while serving this sentence, he was

confined for a time in the maximum security ward at the State Hospital

at Fulton, Missouri.

According to Mr. Hoover, Ray has a known arrest record

dating back to 1949.. Prior to the 1960 conviction for which he received

the 20-year term, Ray had been convicted of burglary in Los Angeles,

California, in 1949; armed robbery in Chicago, Illinois, in 1952; and

forging and cashing United States Postal Money Orders in Missouri

in 1955.

-.

-

He has served terms in the Los Angeles County Jail in

1949; in State Prisons at Joliet and Pontiac, Illinois, in 1952-54; and

in the Federal Penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas, in 1955-58.

Ray was an enlisted man in the United States Army from

February, 1946, to December, 1948, at which time he was given a

General Discharge due to ineptness and lack of adaptability for military.-

service. While in the Army, he received a three-month sentence at - :

Party front group, has several pictures of Martin Luther

sing, Jr., at an affair described as an annual reception

for New York friends of the Southern Conference Educational

Fund. The main speaker for this affair was Martin Luther

King, Jr.

The "National Enquirer," published in New York,

contained a paragraph as follows:

"Martin Luther King, Jr.,

isn't happy about the detailed report that FBI Director

J. Edgar Hoover has compiled about some of his past

associations with communists. In order to limit the FBI's

Yet, he has accepted and is almost certainly still accepting

communist collaboration and even communist advice.

"In 1962-63 the issue of the communist role in the

King organization was raised because of Hunter Pitts O'Dell

commonly called Jack O'Dell. This man, a known communist,

held posts in the Southern Christian Leadership Council,

first in the South and then in the New York office, until

the late Spring of 1963.

King finally dropped him

when

he was warned by United States Government officials that

O'Dell was the genuine communist article.

"Official warnings have been given to king about

After the warning, King broke off his open connections with

this man, but a secondhand connection nonetheless continues."

The "Jackson Daily News" printed in Jackson,

members of the southern caravan were seen with pistols in their

possession, In connection with the Midwest Caravan, large

quantities of food, clothing, and blankets were found abandoned

on buses used by the caravan. Campaign officials were not

interested in having this material returned as they said it was

all donated and they could get more on the way.

Violence

On Yay 20, at Resurrection City, a news Cameraman was

threatened for failing to enter a tent as

instructed,

A marshal,

one of the city's own security force, told the newsman; "If you

don't get in that tent, I'll cut you with my razor," Later,

Jesse Jackson, a campaign official, said the marshal was only

kidding and didn't know the incident was being recorded.

The next day a resident of Resurrection City was arrested

for practicing a "quick draw" with a pistol loaded with "dum-dum"

bullets. Luring a rock-and-roll music entertainment, six fights

erupted. A marshal requested police assistance in removing

armed men from Resurrection City in another incident, but a Reverend

Young, a campaign official, said the marshals would handle this and

denied entry to the city to the police.

There have been fights during meals which caused officials

to call a town meeting to discuss the fights and the marshals had

to disarm a man terrorizing other residents with & meat cleaver.

The "Commandos," a group under the leadership of Father James

Groppi, have clubs, six or seven butcher knives, and two guns.

from Chicago at the city have been stealing goods there and xelling

the itoms they steal. At least four firebombs have been made at

Resurrection City for use against factions of residents of the city.

Leadershie

Resurrection City participants have repeatedly expressed

objections to leaders of the Southern Christian Leadership

Conference, which organized the Poor People's Campaign, staying

at tha fitts loior l'otcl in Hochington, D. Co, instead of at

Resurrection City. Participants are also upset over heavy drinking

and the presence of white and black females in the rooms of

campaign leaders. Reverend Ralph D. Abernathy had obscenities

shouted at him when he visited the tent city on June 7 because of

the fact that he was residing at the Pitts Motor Hotel rather then

in Resurrection City with his followers and because of

caught him in bed with & white female.

Racial Friction

There has been friction between the Mexican-American

contingent of the Poor People's Campaign and campaign Negro leaders.

The Mexican-American contingent has charged racial discrimination.

On June 7, Reverend Abernathy told Reies Lopez Tijerina, leader

of the Mexican-Americans, to either move into Resurrection City,

which the l'exican-Americans have so far refused to do, or leave

Attorney General Ramsey Clark and one said, "We ain't got no

money, man, but we got matches, man. Mr. Ramsey Clark, you

better tell the police to get their guns ready. For every one of

us you kill in Resurrection City, ten cities are going to burn."

This was after Andrew Young reportedly said over the

public address system in Resurrection City, 'We cannot survive

in America unless we put an end to the present government system

that will inevitably lead to our destruction."

A female marshal was raped at Resurrection City by three

or four men and two days later two Negro female visitors were

raped there. The boyfriend of one victim went to the city to

confront the rapists and was met by campaign official Hosea Williams

and marshals. The boyfriend was told to leave or he would be beaten.

A white female, approximately 22 years old, came to the

Between 800 and 900 participants remain at Resurrection

City, which was built to hold 3,000 people. The permit to

occupy the park originally scheduled to expire June 16, 1968, has

been extended to June 23, 1968. Most of the legitimate poor

people have left and in the main only "black nationalists" remain.

Reverend Abernathy said on June 10 that evicting residents of

Resurrection City when the permit expires would "infuriate those

who would like to resort to violence' and would "only disturb

those in cities around the country to the point where violence

would break out."

The Poor People's Campaign has scheduled a mass

FBI'S HOOVER CALLS CARL ROWAN A RACIST.

Vera Glaser and Malvina Stephenson

Knight Newspapers Special Writers.

Washington: FBI Chief J. Edgar Hoover called Negro columnist Carl I.

Rowan a racist Tuesday while discussing the controversy over the tapping

of the telephone of the slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King.

in an interview Hoover was asked who started the current

dispute which already has involved President Nixon and 3 former Attorneys

General.

"That racist columnist, Rowan!" Hoover exploded.

It was one of the most revealing glimpses of Hoover's

personal sentiments since he called King "the most notorious liar in the

country" in 1964. That charge, at a meeting with newswomen, rocked

the Nation.

Hoover also declared Tuesday that other Federal agencies

had been tapping "telephones all over town for years" on their own authority

until the Johnson Administration camped down.

In his syndicated column of June 15, Rowan accused Hoover

of illegal eavesdropping, implying that Negroes were being victimized.

Rowan said the phone taps "have mored this country far

closer to a police state than most Amoricans rralize."

He branded Hoover's long tenure as the Nation's chief law

enforcement officer as dangerous and urged Presidant Nison to replace

him immediately.

Rowan was Assistant Sccretary of State, Ambassador to

Finland and Director of the U.S. Information Agency under the Kennedy and

Johnson Administrations.

## Page 224

Until now, Hoover has made no comment on the feud

with Rowan which has dominated front pages in Washington for more than

a week.

Hoover's fast reaction to the Rowan column came in the

form of a letter signed by his long time aide, Clyde A. Tolson.

Later Hoover told a reporter about two memoranda in

FBI files which he said documented his claim that Robert F. Kennedy

as Attorney General both suggested and authorized the wiretaps on King

to detect possible communist contacts. "

"Without that (the memoranda) it was just my word

against theirs, " Hoover said Tuesday. The memoranda have never been

made public.

Hoover also remarked that the main question now is who

originated the idea of the King phone taps.

Nicholas Katzenbach, the former Attorney General, has

accused Hoover of prodding Kennedy into authorizing the taps.

"That's not true, " Hoover asserted. This put Hoover into

direct disagreement with Katzenbach who said last week it was false to

"say or imply that this tap was the original concept of Robert Kennedy."

Both Katzenbach and his successor, Ramsey Clark, admitted

however, that Kennedy authorized the tap on King's telephone on

October 10, 1963.

According to Hoover, King was under electronic surveillance

from early 1901 until April 30, 1965.

Clark last week called for Hoover to resign. But Hoover,

wio receired a sirong statuent of confidence from President Mixul al

his last press conference shows no sign of quitting.

He was relaxed and friendly at the interview which was

conducted in a Washington restaurant where he was having lunch.

## Page 225

Hoover described Mr. Nixon as an old and good friend.

He recalled they used to vacation together in Miami during the Eisenhower

Administration.

Since Mr. Nixon has been President, Hoover has been a

guest at the White House and at Camp David.

He said Mr. Nixon telephoned him before the press conference

• last week;

and "personally investigated" the King wiretap authorization.

Discussing his general attitude toward electronic

surveillance, Hoover said he has always been opposed to unrestricted

wiretapping by Federal agencies.

He said he is opposed not only in principal but also because

it tarnishes the FBI's image.

This assertion also contradicted the statements of Katzenbach

and Clark, who said he was constantly goading them to tap phones.

:.."

Said Hoover: "Years ago I recommended that all tapping

by any agency have the approval of the Attorney General.

"I didn't want the authority. Agencies were doing it all

over town. Nobody paid any attention to me on this before President Johnson. "

Asked to specily the agencies, Hoover cited "the CIA, the

Defense Department, the Internal Revenue Service and other intelligence

agencies. "

"There was so much of it going, " he said, "someone

would come to me and complain. Then I would check around and would

find it was one of the othor agercies. "

Dispules FBI

On King lap

Former Attorney General Nicholas deB. Katzenbach

charged last night that FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover's

account of why Di. Marlin' Luther King's phone was

tapped is false.

Katzenbach acinowledged that the wiretap was "per-

sonally authorized" by then Attorney General Robert F.

* Kennedy.

"But to say or imply that

this tap was the original con-

ception of Robert Kennedy.

is false," Katzenbach said.

How Long Has This Been Going On?

FBI Director 1.

• Bogar Hoover has offered as

justification for tapping the telephones of the late

Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. two assertions:

one, that this tapping was authorized by the late

Robert F. Kennedy, Attorney General at the time

it was initiated: and. two, that Mir. Kennedy in.

stigated the wiretapping.

The first of these assertions appears to be un-

contested, although Mr. Hoover has vet to produce

any documentation of it. In considerable degree

it relieves him of responsibility for a gross intru-

sion into the privacy of an honored citizen. The

responsibility for this intrusion must be lodged. in

fairness, with the Attorney General if he did in-

deed give his approval of it in advance. We regret,

therefore, that in calling for Mr. Hoover's resigna-

tion recently: we imputed the responsibility to him

alone-there are far better reasons than this for

him to step down.

1

The second of Mr. Hoover's assertions has bein

categorically contested by two former Attorneys

General, one of them Deputy Attorney General

under Mr. lennedy at the time the wiretapping

• was begun. Nicholas Katzenbach declared bluntly:

"To say or imply that this tap was the original

conception of Robert Kennedy-that he was the

moving force in this situation-or that he had any

0cabts

whatsoover as to Dr. King's loraly or

integrity is false." Ramsey Clark sinflarly called

Mir. Hoover's assertion unfair and decoptive. And

Mr. Clark added a commeni that seems to us most

sign meant: "Hu car. Hoovery repeatediy requested

me io authorize Enl discaos en Dr. Ring hite 1

Was Aitorney General. The lost of these requests,

none of which was granted, came two days before

• the murder of Dr. Ning.

Date

How long the tapping of Dr. King's telephone

continued and whether it continued beyond the

dair of President Johnson's order forbidding such

surveillance except in cases directly affecting na-

tonel seeurity is difficult to determine. Dia, the

tapping continue under the Attorney. Generalship.

surveillance reports

The essential facts of this controversy cannot be

established through selective release of

materials

from the FBl's files. Mr. Hoover has a habit of

calling what he does not wish to disclose "classi-

that serves his purposes. His whole handling of

the wiretap problem over a period of 30 years has

been, in our view, disingenuous to say the least.

It began with an assertion that President Franklin

D. Roosevelt authorized him to tap telephones in

national-security cases; but he insisted that the

President's letter conferring this power was classi-

fied and therefore could not be made public; it

Over and over again, moreover, Mr. Hoover has

said that his Bureau has tapped telephones only

in connection with national security: and he has

said this in terms and contexts which led

readers

and listeners to believe that he was tapping only

in situations involving espionage or sabotage by

enemy agents. If his concept of a threat to "national

embraces the leadership of a civil rights

movement, then he lachs either the quagment or

an appalling parados: cutrusted with enforcement

of the liederal lams, it holds itself to lie outside the

ambit of those laws; committed to the championship

of the United States Constifution, it holds itself to

be freo from the restraints of that fundamental

charter. Expressly, the Department declared on

tronie suvaillance of any merbers of organizations

who, li its opinion, may be seeking to "attack and

subvert the Government by unlawful means."

No more pernicious notion has ever been pro-

pounded by an agency of the United States Gow

Ation that the Department can tale the law into its

own hands whenever it thinks the national security

is threatened-from within or from without. Last

to monitor convers?-

tion? "Any President who takes seriously his oath-

We would like to think we are a peace-loving people; at

the same time we insist on venting our hostility on any

individual or nation that questions

our virtue and the

superiority of our ways.

The Wall Sireet Journal (June D) takes issue with the

commission on several points. "So far from being bloody-

minded," it says editorialiy, "the average citizen is ap-

palled and deeply saddened at the violence he is constant-

ly reminded of both at home and on the distant battlefields

of Victnam." The violence at home may indeed sadden

him, although it probably frightens him more and makes

him inclined to resort to violence of his own certainly

the enormous sales of guns to individuals indicate as

much. But as for Vietnam, only a small part of the Ameri-

can public is concerned about the agony that has been

inflicted on the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese

Reports from the front that artillery and air strikes have

killed several hundred of the enemy, at the cost of a few

American lives, cause no public outery. One would think

that only Americans were human. The Pentagon coun-

tered a recent rise in the weekly American casualty total

with a statement that half a million of the enemy had

been killed. Half a million, in a country so small! Not a

murmur was heard from all those "appalled and sad-

dened" citizens The Wall Street Journal knows about.

In a dispatch from Saigon in The Christian Science

Moniior (June 4), Elizabeth Pond provides sonie figures

on American violence as applied in Vietnam with no

result except the virtual ruin of the southern half of the

country. The caption. of the story says that there are cur-

rently 1.3 million refugees in South Vietnam and the gov-

eminent appropriates one-third of 1 per cent of the na-

tional budget to helping them. The policies of the govern-

ment of South Vietnam can be controlled by the govern-

ment of the United States; we have proof here that we

nor only resort to large-scale violence for phantasmal

ends but do not even trouble ourselves to repair some of

the damage.

This war has produced, according to Miss Pond, at

least 4 million refugees,

300.000 physically disabled

20,000 to 50,000 prositutes, more then 90.000 orphans.

"and no one linous just how many juvenile delinquents

placed up to a third of the popolation, ront the social.

two years ago but ii still is horrifying.

Of course many Americans are perturbed by all this:

some are actually trying to ameliore the distress. "An

entire nation is being destroyed," asserts the White Paper

of the American Friends Service Committee, but this com-

passion does not go down in the grass roots.

The animosity agains: Brown's dictum was ampli-

fied by the fact that it was true. The commission's

report will be viewed more tolerantly hut probably it will

101 be as long remembered.

maintained on. the late Dr. Martin Luther. King, Ir.

Evidence offered at the Cassius Clay hearing in Houstoni

indicates that the taps began as early as 1965 and were

is clear also that the taps were maintained after President

Johnson, on June 30, 1965, ordered an end to wire

that Dr. King, a Baptist minister. (Ph.D., Boston Univer-

winner (1964), founder of the Southern Christian Leader-

ship Conference, could have been involved in activities

Incredulity is enhanced by a clear indication of ihai it

this particular wire tap. District Judge Ingraham, whe

is conducting the Clay hearings in Houston, would noi

Nicols supervised-occurred ai a time when Dr. King was

attacking. the FBI for assigning Southern rather than

Northern agenis to civil rights investigations. The in-

ference is that sharp criticism of his acrions is regarded

by Mr. Hoover as a threat to national security.

In an entirely legitimate attempt to secure an official

explanation, the Chicago Daily News propounded a

series of questions to the FBI: "Why was Dr. King's

phone tapped? Did 1. Edgar Hoover approva? Was Dr.

King considered a security rist?" In each instance the

answer was: "No comment."

Not merely is the public entitled to an explanation of

the kind sought by the Daily News, but the continued

failure to provide it will encourage slander of the daad.
