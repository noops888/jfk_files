country's 22,000,000 Negroes. Consequently, he enjoys a wide
_public image as a moral leader of great stature and conviction,

Peace Prize, he was the sixth living man "most eae by
Americans, according to the Gallup Poll,

. pyect: Hunter Pitts Otpeil

This relates to your letterhead memorandum
of September 5 to the Attorney General, relating to Og yt
Hunter Pitts O?De11 and the related prior memoranda, Bane
I appreciate your having sent copies of these to me, vu

This matter had been brought ‘to the attention
of Dr, King some time ago by me, but in accordance Wed
with conversations which the Attorney General 4
had with Courtney Evans, it was not feit to be wise
in view of the sources of the Bureau*s informa-
tion to state that I knew O*Deli1 to be under Conmunist/))
influence or control at any time, I did inform .
Dr, King and two members of his organization --
Reverend Andrew Young and Reverend Wyatt Walker ~~
some time ago ~~ that since O'Dell was believed by
many people to have had Communist connections, his
association with their organization was not in the
best interests of the organization,

At that time, inconclusive steps were taken
to remove O*Dell, and his job with the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference was changed, In
response to direct questions whether I had hard evidence N
® of O?Delits Communist connections, however, I replied

. that I was not in a position to give any,

Following further conversations.with Mr, ~°
Evans in June, however, I brought the matter to the
attention of Dr, King very explicitly in my office
on the morning of June 22 prior to a scheduled meeting ©
which Dr. King had with the President, This was C-
done at the direction of the Attorney General, 7
Later that morning both the Attorney General and ssersey
the President separately strongly urged Dr, King rues
that there should be no further connection between
[otDe11 and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference,

-Dr, King stated that the connection would be
\enaea. Thereafter, the Attorney General and I
both received copies of the attached letter, dated
nied 3, 1963, from Dr. King to aiceiutidaate

On the same occasion, I also informed Dr.
King that our information’ was that Stanley Levison
was a secret member of the Communist Party.
This was also done after conversations with Mr. Evans
prior to the meeting with Dr, King, and was done at
the direction of the Attorney General and the
President. Prior to that time, again based upon
talks between the Attorney General and Mr. Evans at
which I was present, it had been decided that it
was not in the best interest of the United States to
inform Dr. King that we had any firm information
that Levison was under Communist control, I had,
however, on a previous occasion, warned Dr. King
about any association with Levison, basing the
warning upon doubts about Levison*s loyalty to the
United States,

I thought you should have this additional
information for your file. :

The Attorney Gener al spoke to me with reference to fe *
memorandum of October 18, 1963, recommending a technical survei ae
on the office of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference at Atlanta, , ed
Georgia. It is noted that last week the Attorney General authorized i
similar coverage on the residence of Martin Luther King, Jr., President
of the Southern “Christian Leadership Conference.

v The Attorney General is apparently still vacillating in his
poSition as to technical coverage on Martin Luther King and his organization,
it being recalled that he had initially suggested such coverage and then on

ai changed his mind and felt it might be inadvisable.

-{ "+ The Attorney General said that he is still uncertain in his own -
mind about this coverage. I reminded him of our previous conversation, dq
wherein he was assured that all possible would be done to insure the security cael
“jof this operation. i

The Attorney General advised that he was approving the ; ay
e 18, 1963, memorandum but asked that this coverage and that on \

King's residence bg evaluated at the end of 30 days in light of the results
secured so that the continuance of these surveillances could be determined
at that time. This will be done.

On 10/21/63 the Attorney General approved instella tion of
tesurs on the SCLC at its current address or at any future address
to which it may move, There are currently 4 tesurs in operation on i
the SCLC which were installed 11/8/63, With the addition of the 3
additional surveillances there would be in operation a total of 7
tesurs, The 3 additional surveillances are desirable to provide
coverage of additional telephone service NTMI secured by, the SCLC.

® 7 “The SCLC and Martin Luther King, Jr., ‘are subjects of
intensified Bureau investigations inasmuch as it has been determi‘ned
that communists and communist sympathizers exert a great deal of
influence over this organization, The 4 surveillances already in
operation have provided extremely valuable information regarding the
-activities of the SCLC and King, much of which is not available througa
any other source, The surveillances have been most valuable in
uncovering the extensive comaunist infiltration and domination of

both King and the?SCLc,

Atlanta desires to utilize SA Kusch to install these

| additional surveillances, if approved, since the Agent trained for

this purpose in the At lanta Office is known to King as well as other

| Bate pose of the SCLC and full security can be assured only through

having an Agent unknown in the Atlanta area handle the installation.

‘aictimaat 116

Atlanta anticipates that the services of an additional
investigative clerk will be required during normal office hours of
the SCLC to insure full coverage in the event the additional tesurs
are authorized,

OBSERVATIONS +

Since the Attorney General has already authorized technical
coverage of the SCLC and King, additional authority is not necessary
- since this is merely an extension of current coverage brought about
by additional telephone service within the SCLC,

RECOMMENDATIONS :

1, That the attached letter to the Atlanta Office be
approved advising that additional coverage requested is authorized
and that the Atlanta Office will be advised by seperate com tunication
concerning the utilization of SA Eusch to handle the installation and
the additional equipment requested fron the Laboratory,

os

2, That this memorandum be referred to the Administrative
Division for a determination as to whether SA Kusch is available and
to! the Laboratory in order that the equipment reav\ested may be
furnished to the Atlanta Office. It is suggested ‘hat the Administrative
Division coordinate its findings regarding the availability of SA Kusck
with the Laboratory in supplying acaa ones equiprent requested,

I have heard severai comaents and itens which 1
wanted to bring to your attention.

As I inagine is true in all States at this time,
the political situation in Nevada is getting to be very
interesting.

As you knov, Senator Howard -Caznon is coming un Zor
re-election as is Representative Walter Daring. For a long
tine it epveared that Howard Cannon would have no opposition
to amount to anythizrg in his campaign gor re-election. ,The
speculation and word eround the State right nov is thst pro-
bably Walter Baring will file for the U.S. Senate seat now
held by Serator Cannon. I have also been informed that tke
Cannon forces have offered Valter Baring $50,000 if he will
stay out of the Senate race and run for re~election os
Congressman. It appears that the Bobby Baker inquiry has
hurt Senator Cannon.

7
‘a

Yalter Baring hes always been @ strong vote
in this State ivrespoctive of the fact that the news:
end politicians speck derogatorily ebout hin. The word seens
to be that "nobcdy likes Daring but the voters".

It is interesting to me to see that Eoward Cannon
would not like to buttle Walter Daring for the U.S. Senate

Beat.

Arvest investigative Dit .

‘ATTN: C. R. La France, Chief, Investigations
. C. hief, Investigations ;
-Re: Martin Luther King

Information received by ihis Agent indicated that the above
caplioned, during the early morning hours of April 27, 1964,
had been laying up with a local witite prostitute and the prostilute
had picked up @ $100 reward for her services. This Agent, through
informants, managed to pick up the name and number of this white
prostitute and decided to check the above information out for what
it might be worth.

Now, normally a situation like the one mentioned above wouldn't
be considered as anything new, but due to the above captioned's
_ position as a God-fearing man of the cloth and respected leader of
the NAACP, it was decided that perhaps a casual inquiry made to the
prostitute in question might shed an interesting side light to King's
. extra curricular activities.

This Agent phoned the above mentioned prostitute at about 11:45pm
on May 15, 1964 and spoke to a girl named Gail, who agreed to meet
this Agent at a designated spot on South Fifth Street. However, due
to her being called out at adout the same time as this Agent called
her. the meeting eventually came off at about 3.a.m. on May 16, “+4.
Following is the information that Gail gave this Agent and, I wrile it
as she told il.

Gail stat ed thal about 2. a.m. oa April 27, 1964 she was culled oy
i koiels and toid to go to the New Front
R cho nas ine Clava Ward Singers, @ Nevo
girl group singing at the ‘New Frontier Hotel. Gail sroceeded to tke
New Frontier Hoiel aud approached Clara Ward in the lobby. After
introducing herseif to Gail, Clara Ward handed her $100 and said" [
have a couble of friends in town that would like to meet you and have
you take care of them." Clava Ward then siaied thal ihe reason she wus
paying Gail the $200 was because these.two men did not believe in
baying @ girl for her services and for Gail to keep quiet about receiving
any money.

Re: Marlin Luther King, et al

Dale: May 18, 1964

Clara Ward then took this prostitute, Gail, to the Sands Hotel
bay where they had a drink, then Clara Ward made a phone call
and shortly thereafter, Rev. Martin Luther King approached them
at the bar and they both accompanied him to his room in the Sands
Hoiel. Clava Ward iniroduced Gail to the Rev. King as a very good
friend who worked as a dancer in the line at the Tropicana.

Gail stated that she, the Rev. King and Clara Ward all sat down in
his room and started drinking Vodka and Gin drinks and the Rev. King
slarted telling about his "juice" around the country, wiich Gail siaiez
was apparently told to impress hey on what a big man the Rev. King
was, After a short time drinking and bragging, the Rev. King called,
by phone, to another room where as he said, 'my partner is staying,
sleeping off a drunk", and spoke to "his partner", with the following
remark, "don't call me a black son of @ bitch but get your.damned
ass down to my room because I have a beautiful white broad here’.
He then hung up and told Gail that he, the partner, told him he would
be down pretty soon.

cd

Aé this time both the Rev. King and Clava Ward stripped naked
and told Gail to do the same. Gail stated that she had another drink
and then stvipped naked and sat down on a chair. At this time, the
Rev. King went down on his knees and started nibbling on her vight
breast, while Clara Ward did the same with her left breast, Gail
then stated, I guess the Reverend got tived of that and put his head
down between my legs and started nibbling on "that". After awhile
he got up and told Clava Ward to try some of it, so Clara Ward went
down on Gail for awhile. Gail stated, "I thin?Clava Ward is queer".
(The understatement of the year).

The good Rev. King then laid Gail on the bed ard tad iicyvee
wtth her while Clava Ward sat by in the chair and ueicied
Afley what Gail stated seemed like hours, King rolled off and had

i a Negro male, name unknown, entered the room and ie a ‘a tik aid

then slrigged naked at the invitacion of King and he had intercourse
with Gail on the bed while both Clara Ward and the Rev. King wetched
the action froin @ closeby position. During the momentary breaks in

the action, Clara Ward would do a litile feeling and stroking of ner own.

Re: Marlin Luther King :
Date: May 18, 1964

Gail ihen stated that she was getling scared as they were pretty
drunk and all using filthy language and at lasi she told Clara Ward
she would have to go. Clava Ward then told King that as Gail had
to rehearse the following morning, they would have to leave. The
Rev. King then whispered in Gail's ear, "I would like to try you
sometime again if I could get you away from Clava", At this time
Gail and Clara left and had another drink at the bar in the Sands
before parting company.

Gail stated to this investigator that "that was the worst orgy
I've ever gone through" and added that a few days later Ciara Ward
called her on the phone and asked her to come up to hey, Clara's,
voom for a few drinks later in the evening, which Gail stated she
refused to do.

The foregoing is a blow by blow account of the Rev. King's extra
curricular activities during his stay here in our fair city, which
leads me to believe that the good doctor doesn't exactly practice
what he preaches, or does he?

The questién of whether!
‘Bobby Kennedy, when Attor-

and whether he is telling the
truth, Afler all, the credibility,

an issue these days. \
“In this connection, this col-

However, the facts in the

irvefutable, and we can report

Attorney General Kennedy

first ordered Dr. King bugged
on July 16, 1963, His reason
was that Dr. King was in
touch with various Commu-|
nists and was being. eet aepece
by them,
The order caused surprise
in the FBI, During the 1960
election campaign both Bobby
and his brother, the late Pres-
ident, had offered to help Dr.
Sing when he was arrested in
Atlanta on Oct. 19 and refused,
to post bond in connection
with a civil rights sit-in.

John F. Kennedy even is-
sued a press release offering
io help Dr. King, a gesture
which had important effect
on the Negro vote three weeks
Jater. In Cook County it was
the Negro vole which gave
Kennedy his slender 8000-vote
margin in Mlinois and won
him the Presidency,

might not be too effective.

Also he said that the wiretap

way it did.

On Noy. 18, 1964, Hoover
called Dr. King “the most

after Dr. King had urged civil-
rights workers not to xeport)

ground that FBU agents were

. RE: SENATOR HUGH SCOTT
(R - PENNSYLVANIA)
PROPOSED BILL TO COMMEMORATE
MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

Your attention is directed to the attached clipping from
yesterday's "Washington Daily News" indicating that Senator Hugh Scott
of Pennsylvania proposed that one million bronze commemorative medals
be struck in honor of Martin Luther King. Senator Scott indicated he
would introduce a bill to authorize the medals and "a gold medal to be
presented to Dr. King's widow." According to the article, the medals ©
would be sold at cost to the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. Fund
for Education at Morehouse College in Atlanta.

Senator Scott was first elected to the House in 1940 and
was re-elected to seven additional terms. He was in the Navy for two
years during the war and was first elected to the Senate in 1958, being
re-elected in 1964.

Over the years we have had very cordial relations with
Senator Scott, and the Director has regularly written him on his
re-elections. He gave a tribute to the Director on the latter's 35th
Anniversary. The Director sent him an autographed copy of "A Study
of Communism" in 1963.

In addition, on May 11, 1964, the Director thanked Senator
Scott for his splendid comments on the Senate floor with regard io ie
Director's administration of the FBI. On July 15, 1966, the Dircctor
sent Senator Scott a letter in connection with the latter's operation at
Bethesda Naval Hospital.

On May 3, 1965, according to a confidential source,
Martin Luther King participated in a panel discussion two days before
in a panel commemorating Law Day sponsored by the Federal Bar
Association. It was reported that Senator Scott was in attendance at
this meeting and was "fawning" over King who gave the impression during
his speech of trying to justify disobedience to the law.

. RE: SENATOR HUGH SCOTT

As indicated above, Senator Scott has always been very
friendly. In the recent past, he has been sympathetic to the Bureau's
viewpoint in connection with the Safe Streets and Crime Control Bill
now pending on the Hill, :

RECOMMENDATION:

In view of Senator Scott's friendly and cooperative attitude
over the years, it is recommended that Mr, DeLoach brief him on a most
confidential basis as to the background of Martin Luther King, Obviously,
Scott has been "hoodwinked" as to King's true background,

Jack Anderson called and stated he wanted to speak
in confidence. I told him if it.concerned an official
matter I could not agree with this stipulation. He stated

- he merely wanted to tip me off that Drew Pearson will have
an .avticle on Friday, 5/24/68, alleging that former AG Bobby ..

Ysuch an article; however, that I felt he was doing us a ne)
great disservice inasmuch as the article would certainly :

Anderson stated he and Pearson were well aware of
this fact; however, they felt that Kennedy should-receive a
death blow prior to the Oregon primary. I told him that, as 3
he had been advised once before, the FBI would not become
involved in bitter political struggles and that the record

LEAK OF INFORMATION BY DEPARTMENT
ac
eee J¥s"came over to see me at 4:15 p.m., 5/17/68,
be asked x if the rumor was true that was going around Washington
to the effect that Bobby Kennedy had specifically asked the FBI
to ¢ tap the telephone of Martin Luther King. I told Weisl I had not
peara this rumor. I asked him what promptéd his question. He
pas that he had heard about this several times and, as a matter
bt fact, a statement had appeared in a recent newspaper article.

I reminded Weisl that Messrs. Gale, McAndrews, and I had
briefed him regarding all activities pertaining to Bobby Kennedy's ae
requests for microphones and telephone taps during hils tenure as won|
Attorney General. JI stated this briefing, as he shod recall, ~
concerned the basis on which the Department pleaded immunity in the :
civil suit against our agents in Las Vegas, Nevada. / ‘ 7

Weisl stated he remembered the briefing and, as a matter
lot fact, this was when the information first came to his attention.
I asked Weisl why he was now asking me this specific question. |
He replied because Drew Pearson had found out about this matter and
probably would print it in order to embarrass Bobby Kennedy.

a
‘{Pearson. He replied in the affirmative and stated his father,

: Ed Weisl, Sr., had also discussed the matter with Pearson. Weisl
asked me if the FBI ould have any objections to this matter being
brought out before the public. I told him it appeared as if the
matter had already been brought out before the public. I stated
he shovld keep several things in mind, i.e., (1) regardless of how
such an article was written, a seguent of the Negro population of the
[United States would still feel very harshly toward the FRI and

.(2) this would obviously cut off some of our sources of information.

Cee Weisl rebutted this statement with the fact that Riéhard

a of the Washington Post had already printed the fact et

“Mr. Tolson

the FBI had accumulated a number of tapes on King, as a result of
the utilization of microphones, Weisl stated that Pearson would
obviously indicate that Bobby. Kennedy had ordered the FBI to tike
this action. I told Weisl that, nevertheless, certain Negro groups
would still blame the FBI, whether we were ordered to take such
action or not,

Weisl stated he would try to keep the above matter from
theing printed, if the FBI felt so strongly about it. JI told him
we held no. brief for Kennedy, in view of the shoddy way in which ©
he had treated the FBI; however, we did not want to be involved
in any political maneuvers and action of. this nature would most
certainly concern politics. Weisl stated he would try to keep
this from appearing.

Richard Harwood did include in his recent article on the
Director a statement that the FBI had several tapes on Martin Luther
[aioe as a result of the utilization of microphones. This fact has
also appeared in a number of other newspapers. Apparently Weis1
thas discussed this matter with Pearson---Pearson desiring to print
kine facts in order to embarrass Kennedy.

The record is quite clear, through the medium of memoranda

written by former employee Courtney Evans, that, Kennedy first
requested electronic coverage; however, Evans succeeded in talking
him out of it. Several months later Evans approached Kennedy and
yrequested permission for such coverage, at which time Kennedy approved
this coverage. While an expose of such facts could obviously hurt
Kennedy, such action would also harm the FBI from a public relations
standpoint. We, therefore, should have no part in it and should
discreetly discourage such action if brought to our attention.

ACTION - :
If such an article is printed by Pearson, we should
follow a strict "no comment" policy.

MARTIN LUTHER KING AT NATIONAL CATHEDRAL
MARCH 31, 1968

I need not pause to say how perfectly delightful
it is to be here this morning, to have the opportunity of
standing in this very great and significant pulpit, and I
do want to express my deep personal appreciation to Dean
Sayre and all the Cathedral clergy for extending the
invitation. It is always a rich and rewarding experience to
take at least a brief break from our day-to-day demands in
the struggle for freedom and human dignity and ability —

enjoy envolvement in worship which concerns friends and aH

goodwill all over our nation. Certainly there's always a

deep and meaningful experience to be in a worship service. So,
for many reasons I'm happy to be here today. I'm going to use
as a subject from which to preach this morning, "Remaining
Awake Through a Great Revolution.” The text for the morning
is found in the Book of Revelation. There are two passages
there that I would like to quote from the 16th chapter of that
Book, "Behold, I make all things new," ~ "Former things are
passed away.". I'm sure that most of you have read that
interesting story from the pen of Washington Irving entatied,
"Rip Van Winkle." The one thing we usually remember about the

story is that Rip Van Winkle slept twenty years, but there is



ae e e

another point in that story that all too many -people overlook.
There was a sign in the inn from which Rip went up into the
mountains for his long sleep. When Rip Van Winkle went up
into the mountains, the sign had a picture of King George, III,
of England. When he came down twenty years later, the sign
had a picture of George Washington, the first President of

the United States. Rip Van Winkle looked up at the picture of
George Washington, and looking at the picture, he was amazed.
He was completely lost. He knew not who he was. And this
reveals to us the most striking thing about the story of Rip
Van Winkle is not merely that Rip slept twenty oe but that
he slept through a revolution. While he was peacefully
snoring up in the mountains, a revolution was taking place
that, in point, would change the course of history. Rip knew
nothing about it, he was asleep. Yes, he slept through a
revolution. One of the great tragedies of life is that all
too many people find themselves living amidst a great period
of social change and yet they fail to develop new attitudes,
the new mental responses that the new situation demands. They
end up sleesing through a revolution. As a matter of fact.

there is a great revolution taking place in the world toda).

In & Sseise it 18 a triple revolution; that is, a technvio lice.
revolution in weaponery with the emergence of atomic and

nuclear weapons of warfare. Then there is the human-rights

__NW68262_Docld:32989551 Page 136 : a



revolution, with the freedom explosion that is taking place
all over the world. Yes, we do live in a period where
changes are taking place. There is still the voice crying in
the abyss of time saying, Behold, I make all things new.
Former things are passed away. Now, when anything new comes
in history, it brings with it new challenges and new
opportunities. I would like to deal with the challenges that
we face today as a result of this triple revolution that is
taking place in the world today. First, we are challenged to
develop a world spectacle. No individual can live alone. No
nation can live alone; and anyone who feels that he can live
alone is sleeping through a revolution. The world in which
we live is geographically one. The challenge that we face
today is to make the one term appropriate. Now, it is true
that the geographical oneness in the days to come will be to
a large extent through modern man's scientific ingenuity.
Modern man, through his scientific genius has been able to go

long distances through great time and change. Our jet planes

have traversed in uindics dsstances thet once toon ¥
even months. All of this tells us that our world is a neighbor-
hocd, Throxch our scientific and technological genius we Lave
made of this world a neighborhood; and yet we have not yet the

ethical committments to make us a brotherhood. Somehow and

in some way we got to do this. We must all learn to live

—NW.68262_Docld:32989551 Page. 137 7 .



together as brothers, or we will all perish together as

fools. We are tied together in a single bond of destiny,
thwarting any escape from the network of mutuality. Whatever
people want directly, affects all indirectly. For some

strange reason that I can never be what I ought to be until

you are what you ought to be; and you can't be what you ought
to be until I am what I ought to be. This is the way God's
universe is made. This is the way of its structure. John
Donne caught it years ago and finished in graphic times,

“No man is an island entire unto himself. Everyman,is a

piece of the continent, a part of the main. . '" and he goes
on toward the end to say "For everyman's death diminishes me
because I am a part of mankind. Therefor, never send to know
for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee." We must seize
this, believe it and live by it, if we are to remain awake
through a great revolution. Secondly, we-are challenged to
eradicate the last vestiges of racial injustice from our
nation. I just say this morning that racial injustice is still
the black men's burden and the vhite man's shame. It is an
unhappy truth that racism is a way of life, and a vast majority

of shite Auerivans; Sgvken and unspoken, acknowlecse and deny

“6
subtly. Sometimes not so subtly. The disease that' racisn
permeates and poisons the whole body politically. I can see
nothing more urgent for America to work passionately to get

rid of the disease of racism. Something positive must be done.

NW 68262 Docld:32989551 Page 138



_NW 68262 Docld:32989551 Page 139 :

Everyone must share in its guilt; individuals and institutions.
The Government must certainly share the guilt; individuals
must share the guilt; even the Church must share the guilt.

We must face the facts that 11:00 o'clock a Sunday morning
when we stand to sing, "In Christ, there is no East nor West,"
we stand in the most segregated island of America. The hour
has come for everybody from all of the institutions to disect
from this body its cancer, and work to get rid of racism. And
now as we have to do it, we must honestly admit certain things.
We must get rid of certain myths that are constantly being
disseminated all over our nation. One is a myth of time.

There is a notion that only time can solve the problems of
racial injustices. There are those who often appear to say

to the Negroes that are in the white community, "Why don't

you slow up? Stop pushing things so fa&t. Only time can
solve the problems. If you will just be nice and patient and
continue praying, in a hundred or two hundred years the
problem will work itself out.'' There is an answer to that
myth: It is that time is neutral. It can be used either

constructively or destructively. I an sorry to say this

mornings thet I am absolutely convinced that the forces of i

will in our natiun, the

people on the wrong ground use time much more eiieciively than
the forces of good will. It may well be that we will have to
impeach this generation. Not merely for patriotic words and

devout actions of the bad people, but for the fallen silence



oe e
and indifference of the good people who sit around and wait
on time. Somewhere we will come to see that human progress
never rolls in on wheels of inability. It comes through
tireless efforts and persistent work of dedicated individuals
who are willing to be co-workers of God. ‘Without this hard
work, time itself becomes an ally of the primitive forces of
social stagnation. So we must help time and realize that
the time is always rijht to do ‘right. Now there is another
myth that still gets around. It is kind of over-reliance on
the boot-strap philosophy. Now those that still feel that
if the Negro is to rise out of poverty, if the Negre is to
rise out of slum conditions, if he is to rise out of degradation
and segregation, he must do it all by himself and so they say
the Negro must lift himself by his own bootstraps. They never
stop to realize that no other ethnic group has been a slave
on American soil. The people who say this never stop to
realize the debt they owe us who were kept in slavery 244 years.
In 1863 the Negro was told he was free as a result of the

Emancipation Proclamation being signed by Abraham Lincoln. He

Pmet given any bend to mane that £recd It

Was something like keeping a person in prison for a number of
years and suddenly u:scovering that that person was not guilty
of the crime for which he was convicted, and just go up to

him and say now you are free. But you don't give him any
crutch against time. You don't give him any money to get some

clothes for his back or shoes for his feet. Yet this is the

NW 68262 Docld:32989551 Page 140
A ae i hl i rir rl



very thing that our nation did to the black man. It simply
set him free and just left him in ignorance, not knowing
what to do. And we all know that at the same time the
nation failed to do anything for the black man, through an
Act of Congress, it has given away millions of acres of land
west of the Mississippi which meant that it was willing to
share with the white man the tools of economic force and
grant pover to them. ‘They sent men to teach them to farm.
Not only did they provide county agents but as the years
unfolded they provided low-interest rates so ‘they could
mechanize their farms, and to this day, thousands of these
very persons have been seizing millions of dollars in federal
subsidies every year not to farm, and they are the very ones
who tell Negroes they must lift themselves by their own
bootstraps. It is all right to tell a man to lift himself
by his bootstraps. But it is a cruel jest to say to a shoe-
less man that he ought to lift himself by his own bootstraps.
We must come to see that the roots of racism are buried deep
in our country. And there must be something positive and
natural in oeder to get ria of all the elect of ravisa and

tragedy of racial injustices. And there is another thing

closely related to raci that I should like to mention as
another challenge. We are challenged to rid our nation of the
word poverty. Like a monstrous octopus, poverty spreads its
nagging prehensal tenacles into hamlets and villages all over
the world. Two-thirds of the people of the world go to bed
hungry at night. They are ill-housed, they are ill-nourished.

NW 68262 Docld:32989551 Page 141



I have seen it in Latin America; I have seen it in Africa;

I have seen this poverty in Asia. I remember some years ago,
Mrs.’ King and I journeyed to that great country known as
India. And I never will forget the experience. It was a
marvelous experience to neet and talk with the great leaders
of India and get to takkwith and speak to thousands and
thousands & people all over that vast country. These
experiences will remain dear to me as long as the haunts of
memory linger. But I _ to you this morning, my friends,
there are those in Christendom ~ when they see with their

own eyes literally millions of people are going to bed hungry
every night - when he sees with his own eyes God's children
sleeping on the sidewalks at night - In Bombay, more than a
million people sleep on the sidewalks every night. In
Calcutta more than 600,000 sleep on the sidewalks everynight.
They have no beds to sleep in; they have no houses to go in.
He discovers that in our vast population, more than five
hundred million people, some 480 million, make an annual
income less than $9000 a year. Most of them have never seen
a doctor or nurse, and I know that we Anericans say we are

not concerned but. . . au answer cane "Oh no for the

every other nation. We speud in America ilisons of Guiiars a

who go to bed hungry. Maybe we spend/too much of our national

NW 68262 Docld:32989551 Page 142



budget establishing military bases around the world, rather
than basing our genuine concern and understanding in order
to alleviate poverty abroad. JI would remind you in our
nation there are 40 million people who are poverty stricken.
I have seen them here and there. I have seen them in the
ghettos of the north. I have seen them in the rural areas of
the south. I have seen them in Appalachia. I have been in
the process of touring many areas of our country and I nust
confess it is some situation where I literally found myself
erying. I was in Marks, Mississippi the other day, which

is in Quitman county, the poorest county in the U.‘S. I
tell you I saw hundred of little Hack boys and girls walkin
the streets with no shoes to wear. I saw their mothers and
their fathers trying to carry on the Head Start Program, but
they had no money. The Federal Government hadn't funded
them, they were trying to carry on... they raised a little
money here and there; trying to get a little food to feed
their children . . . trying to teach them something. And I
saw mothers and fathers who said to me, not only were they
unclothed, but they didn't get any kind of income - no old-
age pension - no welfare ~- they didn't get anything. I said.

we hunt and catch a few rabbits and. that is howwe get it.'

NW 68262 Docld:32989551 Page 143.



I was in Newark and Harlem just this week and I walked into

the homes of welfare mothers. I saw such conditions - no
wall-to-wall carpets - wall-to-wall rats. So I stood and
talked and this welfare mother said to me even the landlord
won't repair the place. "I have been living here 2 years.

He has not made a single repair." She pointed out how a little
boy was the victim of lead poisoning. She pointed out the wall
and ceilings falling, and the hole where the rats cane in

night after night. They have to stay awake to keep the rats
and roaches from getting to the children. [I said how much do
you pay for this apartment. She said $125. I looked and said
to myself it isn't worth $60. Poor people are forced to pay
more for such living conditions. Tragedy rears so often.

These 40 million people are @mbittered. Because Anerica is

so affluent and so rich ~ because thee are expressways carrying
away from the ghettoes of the poor -

Jesus told a parable one day. He reminds’us a man went to hell
because he didn't feed the poor. The man was Diabees (Phonetic).

He was a rich man. And there was a poor man in Nazareth who was

about it - Now when he died, Diabees went to hell - there was

10

NW 68262 Docld:32989551 Page 144



eo. ®
a rock between Lazarus and Diabees. There is nothing in that
parable that says that Diabees went to hell because he was
rich. Jesus never made the universal indictment against all
wealth. It is true that one day a rich young man came to him
and Jesus told him to sell all... Jesus was prescribing
an individual surgery and not setting forth a universal
diagnosis. If you will look at that parable and all its

bolicue, you vill remember that the conversation took

place between heaven and hell. And the angels had long-
distance calls. It was Abraham talking to Diabees. Now Abraham
was a very rich man. If you go back in the Old Testament, you
will see he was one of the richest men of his day. Diabees
didn't go to hell because he was rich. It was Diabees didn't
realize his wealth was an opportunity. It was not his riches
that separated him from brother Lazarus. Diabees went to hell
because he passed Lazarus every day and didn't really see him.
He went to hell because he allowed his brother to become in-
visible. Diabees went to hell because he maximized the minimun
and minimized the maximum. And went to hell because he sought
io be a conscientious olyecivr in the war against poveril. Lhes
can happen to Anerica . . the richest country in the world.

There's nothing wrong with that.

America of csrortuntty.-
to help bridge the gulf between the have and the have nots. Tne
question is whether America can do it. It has nothing to do

with poverty. What is new is that we now have the techniques and
resources to get rid of poverty. The real question is whether
we have the will. In a fewweks, some of us are coning to

i.
NW 68262 Docld:32989551 Page 145 4



Washington to see if the will is still alive. We are coming

to Washington in a poor-peoples campaign. Everyone is bringing
his pride along. The poor, the masses, we are going to bring
all those who have known long years of hurt and neglect. We
are going to bring those who have come to feel that life is a
long and carved door with no exit sign. We're going to bring
children, adults, and old people. ' People who have never seen
a doctor or dentist in their lives. We are not coming io

We are coming to demand the
Government to adjust itself to the problem of poverty. We

read one day we hold these truths to be self-evident. That all
men are created equal. That they are endowed with their Creator
in certain inevitable rights. That among these are life,
liberty and pursuit of happiness. But if a man doesn't have a
job or income, he has neither life, nor liberty, nor possibility
for the pursuit of happiness. He merely exists. We are coming
to ask America to be true to huge promise ‘of prophetic signs
years ago. We are coming to engage in traumatic non-violent

action to call attention to the growth between promises fulfilled.

Toe ius Way Gu we dy il this vay ~ Yeo ae

it this way because it is our experience a nation doesn't nove

around questions of genuine equality, esnecially when the
is involved until it is confronted massively. A great
documentary is here to tell us that something should be done.
We met here some years ago in a White House conference on civil
rights. We came out with the same recommendations that we will

be demanding in our campaign here, but nothing has been done

12

NW 68262 Docld:32989551 Page 146



about it. The President's Commission on technology,

automation and economic progress recommended these things

some time ago. Nothing has been done. Even a Presidential
Board which was made up of mayors of other cities of our
country, the leading businessmen, have said have these

things done, still nothing has been done. Crime Commissions
have come out this report, just a few days ago. Nothing has
been done. In summary, nothing will be done till people of
goodwill put their hearts and souls in motion. I believe

this will make the difference. Yes, it will be a poor

peoples campaign. This is the question facing America.
Ultimately, a great nation is a compassionayye nation. America
has not met its obligations and its responsibilities to the
poor. One day we will have to stand before our God and history.
We will talk in terms of things we've done. Yes, we will be
able to say we built gargantuan bridges to span the seas. WE
built hugh buildings to kiss the sky. Yes, we have made our
submarines to penetrate oceantic depths. We brought forth
many other things of scientific and technological power. It

seens that I can hear God and history saying That is not

America today and I want to say one other challenge we face ~

simply that we must find an alternative to war and bloodshed.

Anyone who feels, and I fear that 2 lot of people feel this

way - that war can solve the social problems of mankind, is

13

NW 68262 Docld:32989551 Page 147



sleeping through a revolution. President Kennedy said on one
occasion mankind must put an end to war or war would put an
end to mankind. The world must hear this. I pray God that
America will hear this before it is too late because today we
are fighting a war I am convinced that it is one of the most
unjust wars that has ever been fought in the history of the
world. Our involvement in the war in Vietnam has torn up
progress in Geneva . . strengthened the military industrial
conplex. It has strengthened the forces of reactionaries in

the vast majority of people. Put us in a position of
protection of a corrupt regime that is stacked against this
world. It played havoc with our domestic destiny. This day
we are spending $500,000 to kill every Vietcong soldier and
every time we kill one, we spend about $500,000. While we,
spend only $53 a year for every person trying to rise in
poverty-stricken or so-called poverty programs which is not
even a good skirmish against poverty. Not only that, it has
put us in a position of appearing to the world that here we

The judgment of God is on us today. We could go right down

world. For a few quiet nations like Taiwan, Thailand, South
Korea, and a few others, this is where we are. Mankind must
put an end to war or war will put an end to mankind. The
best way to start is to put an end to the war in Vietnam
because if it continues, we will inevitably come to the
point of confronting China, which could lead the whole world
to nuclear annihilation. It is no longer a choice, my
friends, between violence and nonviolence. It is between
nonviolence and nonexistence and the alternative to this
armanent, the alternative to greater suspension of nuclear
tests, the alternative to strengthen the United Nations and
thereby disarming the whole world may well be a civilization
plunged into the abyss of nuclear holocaust. The world could
be transformed into an inferno that even the mind of Dante

UNMAN:

KING:

SPEECH BY MARTIN LUTHER KING

BROADCAST -BY STATION WOL AT 8:30 P.M., 3/31/68

(Commentator on WOL) Black ministers from around the
country recently met to attack the problems of community
leadership. We join Dr. KING as he delivers the closing
speech to this group.

We have discussed many issues; we have deliberated; we

have had fellowship together, and we have heard many
eloquent, profound and passionate presentations. In

a real sense, for so many of us, this has been a mountaintop
experience. There are those transfiguring moments in

life when we do ascend a mountaintop, where we are inspired,
where we are lifted and where we feel a sense of eternity.
But I want to say to you today that in a few hours we

will be returning to the valley. The -valley calls us.

We will be returning to valleys filled with men and women
who know the ache and anguish of poverty. We're going

to be returning to valleys filled with thousands and

thousands of young people who lost faith in America.

We go0 back to a valiey filled with black péopie who
in moments of despair because of their circumstances
and ever again they unconsciously find themselves
erying out with PAUL (LAWRENCE DUNBAR) (ph) a crust of

bread and a corner to sleep in, a minute to smile, and

NW 68262 Docld:32989551 Page 152



an ( ) to weep in, a pint of joy to a peck of
trouble, and never a laugh as the moans come double, and
that is life. Now these eries are in the valley that

we must go back to. The fact is that the vast majority
of Negroes in America are still perishing on a lonely
island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material
prosperity. Now you know what happens in the realm of
semantics that different words are used when you deal
with the poor, the oppressed, the separated. Whenever
you have massive unemployment in the black communities,
it's called a social problem. Whenever you have massive
unemployment in the white community, it's called a
depression. The fact is that that is a depression in the
black community. Now the other thing is whenever the
government provides opportunities and privileges for
white people and rich people, they eall it subsidies;
when they do it for Negroes and poor people, they call

it welfare. The fact is that everybody in this country
lives on welfare. Suburbia was built with federally

subsidized credit and the highways that take our white

brothers out to the suturcs were btu
subsidized money to the tune of 90 percenv. Everyrodcy

is on welfare in this country. The problem is that we

NW 68262 Docld:32989551 Page 153



all too often have socialism for the rich and ( )
free enterprise capitalism for the poor; that's the
problem. As you know the economic problem is serious,
and this has made for a lot of despair, made for a lot

of bitterness, and a lot of anger in the black community;
the situation is getting worse everyday. This anger has
ended up in explosions of violence over the last few
summers, and yet I don't see a riot as the answer; they
don't pay off as from a practical point of view the
enormity of the suffering and the loss of life far outweigh
the gains that come as a result of our burned cities.

We have to face this ( ) fact that no substantive
change has come to America or to any city as the result
of a riot; the only thing we see is a quick token
poverty grant and maybe some water hydrant (squares)

or what have you, and that's about sty no substantive
change has come; no schools have moved toward more
quality integrated education as a result. The job
problem has not been solved as a result of the riots;

we have to face it. So I don't see this as an answer,

and yet c

thing has to be done to get tr
see that it has a moral responsibility to see that everybody
in this country should have a job or an income. Years

ago America signed a huge promissory note and placed it

"NW 68262 Docld:32989551 Page 154



in its Declaration of Independence and talked about

all men being created equal, and then it went on to

say they are endowed by their Creator, and you know this
creed did not say some men, it said all men; it didn't

say all white men; it says all men which includes black
men. And it goes on to say something else which ultimately
distinguishes our form of government from other totalitarian
regimes; it said that each individual had certain basic
rights that are neither derived from or conferred by

the state, In order to discover where they came from,

it is necessary to move back behind the dim mist of
eternity, they are God-given. Now this is what the nation
said, but it hasn't lived up to that. Hight years from
now we will celebrate 200 years of independence in this
country, but I wonder if the black man will be able to
celebrate it. What life have we know? Too often it's

a life of unemployment, of misery and poverty. What
liberty have we known? Too often it is merely the

liberty to move from cone Slum to another I don’t xnow

if we can celebrate it Now

we're g
going to the seat of government with an outline cf demands;

now why do we have to go? Because, number one, we must

NW 68262 Docld:32989551 Page 155



find an alternative, the riots on the one hand and

timid supplication for justice on the other and find a
way to transmute the ( ) waves of the ghetto into
a creative and constructive force. Well, that's one
reason we need to go; people are angry; people are
frustrated; they are bewildered, and you got to give an
outlet, so we need to go to Washington for that reason.
But the other reason is that this country never moves on
the question of civil rights or genuine equality for the
black man until it's made to move through pressure; it
just doesn't happen; I wish it did; I tell you the truth,
I'm tired of marching; I'm tired of going to jail; I'm
being very honest about it. Now everybody .... not

everybody but many people are saying that something

should be done about the slums, about the economic
problems that we face in the black community. I could
mention source after source; three Presidential commissions
have said it; they said everything that we gonna ....
everything that we will demand in Washington they have ;

already written down on paper and said it should be

done; the Committee on Technol 7, Sutcmation and

Progress said it; the Wnite House Conference of Civil

Rights said it; after the Detroit riot a group was formed

NW 68262 Docld:32989551 Page 156 " i



called Urban Coalition with the mayors in most of

the big cities in our country, and even some of the
conservative mayors agreed that a massive program has

to come into being to provide jobs for everybody desiring
jobs; this is what the Urban Coalition came out with.
LEANSER (ph) had been one of the architects of it

and others, but you had on there some of the outstanding
businessmen, DAVID ROCKEFELLER, HENRY FORD, and you can
go right down the line. They have asked in a document
for everything that we'll be talking about in Washington,
"Newsweek" magazine, for the first time in its history,
broke from its past policies of not editorializing about
things like this and said the time for action is now;
it's urgent and they recommended all the things about
that we are gonna be asking for. The Harris poll
revealed that 68% of the American people feel that some
kind of massive program ought to come into being to
provide jobs for everyone desirous of working; it
_Pevealed that 64% of the American people feel that slums

should be eradicated, and the communities rebuilt by the

which would be another

people wno ilve in t
gob program. So it seems there is a concensus in the
nation about this thing, and yet our Congress is

sitting around fiddling while the cities are burning.

They aren't going to do a single thing until we act and

ester

NW 68262 Docld:32989551 Page 157



until we act massively, until we create a non-violent
erisis in this nation, and we are organizing right now
some 15 communities. We want to start..cut with 3,000
poor people who have been trained in the discipline of
non-violence, a thorough understanding of the demands

because they must be their demands, and that would be
the first wave, but you see you don't deal with hard-
hearted Pharoah with just one plague; you gotta keep

plaguing Pharoah, and we want waves and waves; we want

to start out with this group to be sure we have a disciplined

group to set the pattern and start out and then every day
and every week we just want waves of people coming in
pringing back grievances to Washington, saying we demand
change. This is a poor people's campaign, and those who
come who are a little more affluent will come in a
supportive role fighting for something for poor people.
And I urge you to do it because this is so much of our
ministry; this is what our ministry really means. You
know, you find it in your congregations; there are some

among us in the middle class who kind of float out of

the muddy wat

flowing waters of the mainstream to a degree, and they
forget the stench of the back waters. We must not allow

our poorer brothers to be ignored; we, as preachers, must

NW 68262 Docld:32989551 Page 158



join hands with them. PAUL KILLECK (ph) is right; sin
is separation. What represents it more than what we

see going on in our nation and in the world; we're
separated from ourselves, separated from our neighbors,
and finally separated from God, and we are going to
Washington to try to deal with some of these problems,
and I said earlier it is not MARTIN LUTHER KING; it's
these men around me, they do the work. They're men who
are humble but at the same time are dedicated to the
struggle; they are humble enough to take cuts in salaries;
I know what I'm talking about; they coud make much more,
put they are doing this, and I don't mind asking you
that we need your support; I don't mind saying to you
today that we want you to leave here committed to this
church, SCLC is a church, a church in action. It is not
no accident that most of the staff members and board
members and leaders are preachers in SCLC, and I am

not saying that other civil rights organizations should
not be supported, but I am saying that it is conviction

a7

that preachers are to te icentified with £010 bess

is a cootal action chursh, that is working in thie cocletr.
(Some applause) We need your support to sev buses and
to get people into Washington. We got to feed people;
you've got to do a lot of things. If everyone of you

in your communities would help us, America will see a

-~-8-

NW 68262 Docld:32989551 Page 159



movement that it has never seen before. After we get

to moving, people will be coming from everywhere, and I
want some congressman to go to the window and look out
and say, I see a lot of people on these highways. Where
are these people coming from? Who are they? And I want
someone to go in there and say they are coming up out of
Mississippi and Alabama. And I want somebody to go by
there and say they are coming from the ghettos of
Chicago, Detroit, Newark, New York, and Philadelphia.

I want somebody to say they are coming up out of great
trials; they are coming up out of years of neglect and
years of hurt. Who are they? These are they. And I
want somebody else to add, How many do you see out there?
And I want somebody just to say, I've been trying to
count them all, but it seems there need to be a number
that no man can number. I am fired up over Washington ...
«eee LT want you to be in Washington with us, and I am
serious about this, the nation need this. And I am going
on to say thay these are days that demand for us ac
clergymen a committed empathy. And a kind of dangerous
altruism. This is wnat is demanded of us today, @
dangerous altruism; we have got to give ourselves to
others. Jesus told another parable, “One day a man came
to Him and raised a lot of questions, and finally he

ended up saying who is my neighbor?" Now that question

NW 68262 Docld:32989551 Page 160



could have very easily ended up in a philosophical débate.
But Jesus immediately pulled that question out of mid

air and placed it on a dangerous curve between Jerusalem
and Jericho, and He talked about a certain man that fell
among thieves. You know the story, I don't have to go
through it. Finally the man who helped was a man of
another race. And I want to tell you a little about it
because I thought about it several times when I've been
in the Holy Lands. We ask the question: Why? ...did the
Priest and the Levi pass, and we come out with a lot of
imaginary ideas; sometimes we say that they were busy;
they had to get down to some ecclesiastical conference;
at other times we say that maybe they were following a
religious law which said that one was not to touch

a human body 24 hours before carrying on a religious

service, and then sometimes we say that this is a possibility
that maybe the men were going down to Jericho to organize

a Jericho road improvement association, and maybe they

felt that it was better to get at the problem, at the

cause of the source rather than get bogged down in an

Ayidual ce. a@ possibility, tut vt

Ly

dr
of this parable, my imagination goes somewhere elise. It
is possible that these men went on the other side too

because they were afraid. And it's possible, you see,

- 10 ~ :

NW 68262 Docld:32989551 Page 161 7



that when that Levi and Priest saw that man over there,
they said that maybe the man is just a faker, and maybe
he is just there to lure us over for quick and easy
seizure, and now they could have said that maybe the
robbers are still around, and we better get on and get
out of this situation. You know the words. The first
question that the Priest asked; the first question that
the Levi asked, was if I stop to help this man, what will
happen to me? But the good Samaritan reversed the question:
If I do not stop and help the man, what will happen to
him? That is the ultimate question of life. So often
we are thinking about our jobs, our prestige, our
positions, and we find ourselves saying: If I take a
stand for this cause, what will happen to me? Will my
home get bombed? Will I get put in jail, or will I lose
my prestige in a particular group that Iam in? That

is divorced from the problem. What will happen to me

is so often the question that we raise, Yeah, will I
get put off the poverty board? What will happen to me?
But the great question is if I do not take a stand, what

en to our bre rs and cur cisters

suffering? This is the question that we al
weigh. I have weighed it in my life; I remember when I
first took my position against the war in Vietnam, almost

-~1ll-

NW 68262 Docid:32989551 Page 162 .



every newspaper in the country critized me. They don't
pother me too much now because too many people agree with
me, but when I took the position at first, it was a

low period in my life; I could hardly open a newspaper.
It wasn't only white people; it was Negroes. I must rush
on to my conclusion, but I want to say that we are

not only priests, but we are prophets. When God speaks,
who can but prophesy. Prophesy until slums and rat-
infested ghettos be a thing of the dead past and a dark
past. And every man will be able to live in a decent
sanitary house. Go out and prophesy until the vital
industries of Appalachia are revitalized, and the wrinkled
stomachs of Mississippi are filled. Go out and prophesy.
Until brotherhood will no longer be the end of a world,
at the end of a prayer, but the first item of business

on every legislative agenda. Go out and prophesy. Until
our state houses and city halls will be filled with men
who will do justly, who will love mercy, and who will
walk humbly with their God. ~Go out and prophesy. Until

even the lion and the lamb can lie down together. And

every
none shall be afraid. It won't always be easy. Sometimes
it may cause one of your children to ask you, "Daddy, why
do you have to go to jail so mich?" It may mean losing

a job; it may mean weary nights.

NW 68262 Docld:32989551 Page 163 - ered



It may mean standing amid the chilly winds of adversity,

but if we are followers-of Jesus Christ, we know that |
Christianity is not a euphoria of unannoyed comfort and
untroubled ease. What is it? It means taking up the
cause, taking it with all its (tich) and pack agony and
bearing that cross until it leaves the very marks of

Jesus Christ on your body and on your soul. We need to
take up the cross and follow Jesus, and finally as we
leave, we are going back to a valley that is filled with
despair; people have lost hope. We have the job of
transforming the fatigue of despair into the buoyancy

of hope. When people lose hope, they die spiritually

and physiologically; keep the hope, the flame of hope
burning. When people lose hope, they develop a disease
called give-up-itis, and they develop a kind of nihilistic
philosophy, which concludes that you can't change anything,
so let us go on and disrupt for disruption's sake;

let us go back and tell young men and young women that

it is dark now; it is dismal, but mcrning will surely
come; weeping may tarry for a night, but foy cometh in

the morninz. Oh, I teiteve that. Go back end tell our
brothers and sisters to wait until the morning; don't

give up too early; tell the black nationalists who want

to give up on non-violence, don't give up yet; we haven't

tried it in the North on a massive scale yet; go back
and tell them that if this building caught afire, and you
got three or four buckets of water to try to put the

fire out, and it didn't put the fire out, you wouldn't
say that water can't put the fire out. You'd just say
that you need more water more efficiently and intelligently
applied. It doesn't mean that non-violence won't work;
we haven't tried it on a massive scale in the North.
Everything that we have set out to get through a non
violent movement, we have gotten that. It's a success
story; tell them to wait until the next morning; don't
give up yet. I'm not going to stop singing "We Shall
Overcome” because I know that ( ) is long, but it
bends toward Justice. I'm not going to stop singing

"We Shall Overcome" because I know that the truth crushed
to earth shall rise again. I'm not going to stop

SUBJECT: VERA R. GLASER AND
MALVINA STEPHENSON
KNIGHT NEWSPAPERS
INTERVIEW WITH DIRECTOR
At 9:30 p.m., 6/24/69, Bill Barton of the Associated

Press, telephoned Bishop and advised that the Associated Press had learned
that the above captioned women reporters, who are with Knight Newspapers,
claim to have had an exclusive interview with the Director on Tuesday,
dune 24, 1969. He stated that the only information about the contents of
the interview that he has is to the effect that Mr. Hoover informed these
reporters that "that racist columnist, Rowan" started the current
controversy regarding wiretapping, that Mr. Hoover allegedly stated
that Government agencies, “all over town" have been wiretapping, and
that they quote Mr. Hoover as stating that he did not wish to get into the
wiretapping of King but that former Attorney General Kennedy ordered it.
Barton wished to know if the alleged interview with Mr. Hoover was
authentic and if the FBI had any comments to make concerning it.

After checking with Miss Gandy and Mr. Tolson, Bishop
- was advised by Mr. Hoover that we should have no comment to make
concerning this matter. Accordingly, at 9:55 p.m., 6/24/69, Barton
of the Associated Press was advised that the FBI had no comment to make.

Attached hereto is a copy of a United Press International
(UPI) story which appeared in "The Washington Post on June 25, 1969,
reporting on the alleged interview. Efforts are presently being made to
secure copies of the "Detroit Free Press" as soon as they arrive in the
Washington area, inasmuch as the full report of the alleged interview is
contained in that newspaper, according to the attached article.

None. For information.

You will recall the following information I gave you earlier

concerning King's visit to Norway in Dec., 1964, which info, we
received from a reliable source.

Bayard Rustin, an aide to King who accompanied King to Norway
told two acquaintances of the following incident. (Rustin himself is a
convicted homosexual). According to Rustin, when he was in Oslo, Norway,

with Martin Luther King, Jr., in connection with the latter's receipt of

Che Tyrise, Rustin was called down by the police one morning

at 4:30 a.m. because the police had caught a prostitute coming out of

the room of A. D, King, Martin's brother, A, D, King attempted to evade
the police by running into Martin's room, Tne police accused the
prostitute of stealing money. The prostitute claimed, however, that she
was paid by the occupant of A, D. King's room, Rustin claimed that he

7

calked tre police out of arresting the prostitute in order to avoid

besmirching the reputation of Martin Luther King, Jr. Rustin also said

thet members of King's entourage had naxed girls running up and down the

corridors of a hotel where they stayed and that they were bringi

prostitutes into their rooms.

Rev. Martin Luther King. His influence is very great, His
original dedication to nonviolence can hardly be douhted.
Yet, he has accepted and is almost certainly still accepting
communist collaboration and even communist advice.

"In 1962-63 the issue of the communist role in the
King organization was raised because of Hunter Pitts 0'Dell
commonly called Jack O'Dell. This man, a known communist,
held posts in the Southern Christian Leadership Council,
first in the South and then in the New York office, until
the late Spring of 1963. King finally dropped him when

O'Dell was the genuine communist article.

another, even more important associate who is known to be

RESURRECTION CITY

This very synopsized account is a representative cross
section of a large amount of material on the same subject matter,

It is to be noted that this account relates only to a
factual description of certain day-to-day aspects of Resurrection
City. It deliberately excludes any comments on economic, religious,
political, educational, and sociological factors and interests,
Further, no conclusions have been drawn or interpretations made,

On June 10, 1968, Senior Editor and Religious’ Editor
Louis Cassels of the United Press International wrote:

"A month after it began, the Poor People's
Campaign is floundering, It is beset by leadership
problems, racial friction, confused objectives and
Low moraleseoe"

The Caravans

The Poor People's Campaign began with severel caravans ‘
throughout the United States forming to travel to Washington, D. C,
In Boston, Massachusetts, a man picketing the caravan was stebbed

of the caravancalled the "Mule Tfain" was arrested in New Jersey
in April, 1968, with drugs and a stolen gun in his car, Several
members of the southern caravan were seen with pistols in their
possession, In connection with the Midwest Caravan, large
quantities of food, clothing, and blankets were found abandoned
on buses used by the caravan, Campaign cfficials were not
interested in having this material returned as they said it was
all donated and they could get more on the way,

Violence

On May 20, at Resurrection City, a news cameraman was
threatened for failing to enter a tent as instructed, A marshal,
one of the city's own security foree, told the newsman; "If you
don't get in that tent, I'11 cut you with my razor," Later,
Jesse Jackson, a campaign official, said the marshal was only
kidding and didn't know the incident was being recorded,

The next day a resident of Resurrection City was arrested
for practicing a "quick draw" with a pistol loaded with "dur-dum"
bullets, Luring a rock-and-roll music entertainment, six fights
erupted, A marshal requested police assistance in removing
armed men from Resurrection City in another incident, but a Reverend
Young, a campaign official, said the marshals would handle this and
denied entry to the city to the police,

There have been fights during meals which caused officials
to call a town meeting to discuss the fights and the marshals had
to disarm a man terrorizing other residents with a meat cleaver,

The "Commandos," a group under the leadership of Father James
Groppi, have clubs, six or seven butcher knives, and two guns.

Residents of Resurrection City have thrown rocks at
passing automobiles, damaging four cars and injuring one w

into the city and no arrest was made, Members of a youth gang
from Chicago at the city have been stealing goods there and xelling
the items they steal, At least four firebombs have been made at

Resurrection City for use against factions of residents of the city.

Leadership

Resurrection City participants have repeatedly expressed
objections to leaders of the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference, which organized the Poor People's Campaign, staying
et the Pitts Motor Motel in Woshinzton, D, C., instead of at
Resurrection City, Participants are also upset over heavy drinking
and the presence of white and black females in the rooms of
campaign leaders, Reverend Ralph D, Abernathy had obscenities
shouted at him when he visited the tent city on June 7 beceuse of
the fact that he was residing at the Pitts Motor Hotel rather then
in Resurrection City with his followers and because of rumors
circulated to the effect that Resurrection City residents had
caught him in bed with a white female,

Racial Friction

There has been friction between the Mexican-American
contingent of the Poor People's Campaign and campaign Negro leaders,
The Mexican-American contingent has charged racial discrimination,
On June 7, Reverend Abernathy told Reies Lopez Tijerina, leader
of the Mexican~Americans, to either move into Resurrection City,
which the Mexican-Americans have so far refused to do, or leave
town,

While a Negro newspaper reperter was getting a story in

itself, Three campaign participants (two coming with a ceravan)

are being held for shooting and killing two U, S. Marine officers
and wounding two other persons, These three were to move into ~
Resurrection City the night of the murder,

Members of another teen~age gang called the "Invaders"
who are with the campaign from Memphis, Tennessee, invaded the
Ballou High School in Washington and roamed the halls setting
off firecrackers and turning in two false fire alarms, A
campaign participant was arrested for refusing to pay for drinks
in a Washington restaurant and pulling a knife on the waitress,

During a demonstration at the Supreme Court Building,
six campaigners threw rocks and broke five windows, Three
campaigners were arrested for lowering the flag to half mast and
five others were later arrested for obscene Language,

At the Department of Justice, campaigners met with
Attorney General Ramsey Clark and one said, "We ain't got no
money, man, but we got matches, man, Mr, Ramsey Clark, you
better tell the police to get their guns ready, For every one of
us you kill in Resurrection City, ten cities are going to burn,"

This was after Andrew Young reportedly said over the
public address system in Resurrection City, "We cannot survive
in America unless we put an end to the present government system
that will inevitably lead to our destruction,"

Immoral, Activity

A female marshal was raped at Resurrection City by three
or four men and two days later two Negro female visitors were
raped there, The boyfriend of one victim went to the city to
confront the rapists and was met by campaign official Hosea Williams
and marshals, The boyfriend was told to leave or he would be beaten,

A white female, approximately 22 years old, came to the
fence at the city at night and said she wanted to do whatever she
could to support the campaign, One Negro male suggested she enter
the camp and engage in sexual relations with the participants,

She entered 1. section Uity, stcyed two hours, and cngaged in
sexual relations with six or seven Negro men.

Current Situation

Between 800 and 900 participants remain at Resurrection
City, which was built to hold 3,000 people, ‘The permit to
occupy the park originally scheduled to expire June 16, 1968, has
been extended to June 23, 1968, Most of the legitimate poor
people have left and in the main only “black nationalists" remain,
Reverend Abernathy said on June 10 that evicting residents of
Resurrection City when the permit expires would “infurlate those
who would like to resort to violence" and would “only disturb
those in cities around the country to the point where violence
would break out,"

The Poor People's Campaign has scheduled a mass
demonstration, called "Solidarity Day'! for June 19, This demon~
stration is to include sympathizers from all over the country

pointed to Lincoln's statue in the Lincoln Memorial and said
to her, "Sce that bastard? We're going to paint his skin black

FBI'S HOOVER CALLS CARL ROWAN A RACIST .
Vera Glaser and Malvina Stephenson
: ‘Knight Newspapers Special Writers.

Washington: ’ FBI Chief J. Edgar Hoover called Negro ee Carl T.
Rowan a racist Tuesday while discussing the controversy over the tapping
of the ae ceca of the slain civil rights ‘leader Martin Luther King.

Jn an interview Hoover was asked who started the current
dispute which already has involved President Nixon and 3 former Attorneys
General.

That racist columnist, Rowan!" Hoover exploded.

It was one of the most revealing glimpses of Hoover's
personal sentiments since he called King "the most notorious liar in the
country" in 1964, That charge, at a meeting with newswomen, rocked
the Nation.

Hoover also declared Tuesday that other Federal agencies
had been tapping "telephones all over town for years" on their own authority
until the Johnson Administration caniped down.

In his syndicated column of June 15, Rowan accused Hoover
of illegal eavesdropping, implying that Negroes were being victimized.

Rowan said the phone taps "have moved this country far
closer to a police state than most Americans revalize.!

He branded.Hoover's long tenure as the Nation's chief law
enforcement officer as dau gerous and urged Pres Nixon to replace
him immediately

Rowan was Assistant Secretary of State, Ambassador to
‘Finland and Director of the U.S. Information Agency under the Kennedy and
Johnson Administrations,

NW 68262 Docld:32989551 Page 223 S



Until now, Hoover has made no comment on the feud
with Rowan which has dominated front pages in Washington for more than
a week.

: Hoover's fast reaction to the Rowan column came in the
form of a letter signed by his long time aide, Clyde A. Tolson.

Later Hoover told a reporter about two memoranda in
FBI files which he said documented his claim that Robert F. Kennedy
as Attorney General both suggested and authorized the wiretaps on King
to detect possible communist contacts) ° .~ aan on :

"Without that (the memoranda) it was just my word
against theirs, * Hoover said Tuesday. The memoranda have never been
made public.

Hoover also remarked that the main question now is who
originated the idea of the King phone taps. a

Nicholas Katzenbach, the former Attorney General, has
accused Hoover of prodding Kennedy into authorizing the taps.

"That's not true, " Hoover asserted. This put Hoover into
direct disagreement with Katzenbach who said last week it was false to
"say or imply that this tap was the original concept of Robert Kennedy."

Both Katzenbach and his successor, Ramsey Clark, admitted
however, that Kennedy authorized the tap on King's telephone on
October 10, 1963,

According to Hoover, King was under electronic surveillance
from early 1964 until April 30, 1965. : .

Hoover described Mr. Nixon as an old and good friend.
He recalled they used to vacation together in Miami during the Eisenhower
Administer ation. :
: Since Mr. Nixon has been President, Hoover has been a
guest at the White House and at Camp David.

beseuee He said Mr. Nixon telephoned him before the press conference
- last week; and "personally investigated" the King wiretap authorization.

Discussing his general attitude toward electronic
surveillance, Hoover said he has always been opposed to unrestricted
wiretapping by Federal agencies.

“He said he is opposed not only in principal but also because
it tarnishes the FBI's image. 7 7
oe This assertion also contradicted the statements of Katzenbach
and Clark, who'said he was constantly goading them to tap phones.

Other civil rights at first
