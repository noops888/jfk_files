lL ‘The iG ‘plan presented ‘iy Ninalo hay proposes, in brief, that.
the HRP be provided vith fins in the azout of $2,383,000 tor
with.which to ‘mount ‘anti—Costro operntions. It ts

Of the dosiruble goal ‘of bringing shout the daniée of the Castro regise.

3. It 1s noteworthy that the plan insists that the MRP retain
peri ge ela sorrel hm eas ra eho Thus,
it states, on pause 6, thats

“Contetoutions vill be received without conprontsing ‘the
responsibility for decisions and organization of the plans. ‘This doss
not rule out our eearch far eomselling-and coantlestion with ‘other
factors present, cut without evor curremter!ng tba responsibility and
aboolute eontral of th ong.” (Under intus added)

Tt also éppeare to va ine I? view that Its position should

establieh high-level contact. vhich will miro it pcesible to discuss
questions of basie polley of events wai plans opportuely, on mitt
footing. ”.- (Underlining alded)

4. The oparations contemlated by the iP are nat too Aissinilar
fran those proposed by the Wi/b/PN section for FY 1962. They inelude
the operution of maritine assets copadie of reaching all Cuban consta,
the operation of asrial supply craft (fro: two bases), the training ani
infiltration of 8/2 operators end intellizence agents, support of internal
guerrillas, and the treining of eig:t or tea 130-ma groups for introduction
into Cuba at the right time. (there 16 alno coaiderabis otress girea to
the mounting of extensive peyctoloyical varfare). ‘The !XP plan vould pose

Ferma is one that {# attractive to the Cuban _

oftera we people of Cuba a poattize program of goc!al “and econaale reform.
(Yhetier such a program vould be compatible with U.S. laterests ‘s, of

MEP program appears to break amy strongly fron the 190 constitution.
