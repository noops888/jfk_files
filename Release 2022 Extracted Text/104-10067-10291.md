CONCERN.TO THIS STATION, GUT AT SAME TIME, IT CONFIRMS THE WORST
FEARS EXPRESSED IN REF 6& CONCERNING REVELATIONS ABOUT OPERATIONS
AGAINST THE SOVIET TARGET IN MEXICO CITY,

2.° IN ORDER QF IMPORTANCE, THE NBC PROGRAM CANNOT HELP BUT
BE DAMAGING 10 U,S, SECURITY INTERESTS AND THIS AGENCY IN THE
FOLLOWING MANNERS

A, REVELATION OF SOURCES, THE STATEMENT BY BACH IN
REF C THAT HE “HAN NOT IDENTIFIED ANY SOURCES BY NAME OR DES=
CRIPTION THROUGHOUT THE TAPING..." IS REFUTED BY THE STATEMENT
THAT A SOVIET WAS RECRUITED BY FORMER COS (ROGER T, KINGMAN)
DURING HIS TOUR, APART FROM THE DESCRIPTION OF THE CIRCUM=
STANCES UNDER WHICH THE KECRUITMENT WAS MADE, THE SIMPLE STATE
MENT THAT A SOVIET OFFICIAL WAS RECRUITED IS SUFFICIENT TO
SET OFF A FULL SCALE INVESTIGATION BY THE KGB INTO EVERY
SOVIET OFFICIAL wHO SERVED IN MEXICO CITY DURING THAT TIME
FRAME, THE SOVIETS HAVE THE RESOURCES AND DETERMINATION TO
EVENTUALLY ICENTIFY THE SPY,

B. FUTURE RECRUITMENTS, HOw WILL IT BE POSSIBLE FOR
THIS AGENCY TO KECRUIT SOVIETS, OR ANYONE FOR THAT MATTER, IF
THE AGENCY CAN QFFER GUARANTEES THAT THE IDENTITY OF SOURCES

WHILE THIS PROGHAM KILL HAVE IMMEDIATE IMPACT IN MEXICO CITY,
LA PAZ, AND MUiTEVIDEO, THE FALLOUT AFFECTING FUTURE RECRUITMENTS
