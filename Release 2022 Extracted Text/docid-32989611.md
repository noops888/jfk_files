With the exception of a weekly publication by the
CIA on international terrorism, requested by the Cabinet
Committee on January 1, 1973, the intelligence functions
of the Cabinet Committee and its Working Group are handled
through established interagency channels. The agencies
most active in generation and coordination of terrorism
information for the Working Group are the CIA, the FBI,
NSA, DOD, the Secret Service, the Department of Treasury
and the State Department.

These Working Group agencies set their own priorities
* and parameters concerning intelligence on terrorism mat-
ters. From time to time the CIA requests comments from
the Working Group on its weekly terrorism reports.

The organization of the Cabinet Committee is de-
lineated in the President's memorandum of September 25,
1972. The Working Group is composed of senior repre- .
sentatives of the ten agencies on the Cabinet Committee
and representatives of the Following agencies: Arms
Control and Disarmament Agency, Energy Research and
Development Administration, Federal Protective Service,
Immigration and Naturalization Service, Law Enforcement
Assistance Administration, Metropolitan Police Department,
National Security Agency, Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Office of Management and Budget, and the United States
Information Agency. These additional agencies were in-
vited to participate in the Working Group by the Special
Assistant to the Secretary and Coordinator for Combatting °
Terrorism (S/CCT), in his capacity as Chairman of the
Working Group.

Under the Working Group there is one formal sub-
group, the Behavioral Science Resource Group (BSRG),
which is composed of behavioral science experts from
the State Department, the CIA, the FBI and USIA. The
State Department member chairs BSRG. The Resource Group

Peake Division of this Bureau, dated June 26, 1975, captioned "DAG
Inquiry Re Communication by Former AAG Doar to FRI Regarding

ONTAINUS

Regarding your request contained in referenced communication
for the Bureau to locate and furnish certain documents, it is my under-
that you are in possession of the documents requested.

In response to your request that we turnish our observations
concerning the making of the documents available to former Assistant
Attorney General John Doar, may | suggest that this raises an issue
which has been discussed in the past by the Eureau and the Department

-and other Governmeat agencies. This issue to my knowledge has not
been resolved, That issue is whether a former employee should be
allowed access to documents in the Government's possession to refresh
his recollection for possible testimony before the Senate Select Committee.
It ts this Fureau's position that such documents should not be made
available for the aforementioned purpose, and in those instances where
a former employee cannot respoad accurately to the question of the Senate
Select Committee or any other Congressional investigative body, the
Committee or Congressional body can be referred to the appropriate
bureau or agency which will, if appropriate, farnish the necessary
lormation. I am sure you will understand our concern in this regard
ofar as setting a precedent which might serve for future requests of
nature.

asking for information concerning the Mississippi Freedom Democratic

(1) The DAG has asked me to request that the Bureau make
a file check to determine what, if any, documents may be found
in FBI files relating to a request made by Mr. Doar in August
1964 for information and Bureau-action regarding members of the
subject delegation. It is our understanding that Mr. Doar
requested certain information from the FBI regarding this dele-
gation in mid-August 1964; and that some information was delivered
to the DOJ (either to Mr. Doar or then DAG Katzenbach) shortly
thereafter, in the latter part of August 1964.

a’
(2) It is possible that Mr. Doar may be asked about these i !
matters in connection with the Senate Select Committee inquiry aes
(reference Appendix D, Item 7, 5/14/75 SSC request). The DAG ee

has also asked that, after such documentation as may be developed
under (1) above has been located, the Bureau furnish to him its
view as to the access/delivery to Mr. Doar of such documentation
for the purpose of refreshing his recollection.

By letter dated 5/14/75, with attached appendigess

the SSC requested certain information and documents from y
the FBI.

Appendix C, Item number 10, requested all memoranda
and other materials relating to the elimination of the Liaison
Section of the FBI in 1970 and its reestablishment in late
1972.

Among the enclosures to our letter to the Attorney
General (AG), dated 6/13/75, being proposed for forwarding
to the Committee is E. S. Miller memorandum to Mr. Felt,
7/14/72. On page 2 there is information that "our close 4
association with the Chief Postal Inspector and his top i; LF
officials has resulted in that agency providing support in él ot
some of our most delicate intelligence operations looking yy
to the identification of illegal hostile intelligence o
activities in this country." This could possibly be construed
to include opening of mail. It is to be noted that opening
of mail by FBI is the subject of a separate SSC request and
\ future correspondence with the SSC, through the AG, will
; address itself to this subject. Former Chief Postal Inspector
Henry B. Montague , with whom we have had extensive dealings
in the past, is scheduled to appear before the full SSC on
6/12/75 and it is expected that he will be questioned about 23]

possible FBI participation in mail openings. 9538

The Honorable Edward H. Levi i :

“Dear Mr. Attorney General:

Enclosed with this letter are notifications concerning
: certain matters currently under investigation by. the Select
’ . Committee which relate to government entities under your >
* Jurisdiction.

These notifications are submitted pursuant to an
agreement between the Committee, the various intelligence
entities, and the Whité House. Pursuant to that agreement,
the various entities in the Rxecutive Branch have agreed not
only to make available tne per ent witnesses, but also to
submit in response all information and material which they
possess that is relevant to the areas and cases Wi nh the
Committee wishes to investigate. The response should include
all relevant underlying doewmentation and other information,
including documents which may not nave come to the Committee
-attention and which the Committee has not specifically requested,
and all material relating to any prior Executive Branch inquir
into the matter. In addition, we would welcome a current
analysis of.the particular questions raised by the Committee
and any other observations on the subject that you believe
would be helpful. : : : iene

the full disclosure policy contained in the agreement is
dndispensible to the Committee's analysis and to the formulation

of our ultimate findings, conclusions, and recommendations.

Within the Committee mandate, contained in S. Res. 21,
there are four broad subjects relating to the intelligence
community which we are required to investigate and study in

cr : 1. The structure; performance, and utility of
7 + government operations with respect to -
intelligence activities;

2. Whether certain policies or practices are or
are not illegal, unethical, or otherwise
_ Improper;

3. Whether there has or has not been excessive

peEEEEEE generally, the efficiency of intelligence
: activities; and

7 4, Whether there has or has not been adequate

~ internal and external control and oversight

over the policies and practices of intelli-
“gence agencies.

In attempting to find the answers to these fundamental
questions, the Committee is proceeding in two ways. First, we
* are examining intelligence functions broadly as instruments
of government policy, giving attention to the authority for
particular functions, the problems which intelligence activi-
ties are designed to solve, the procedures by which intelli-

_ gence activities are and have been proposed, approved,

* executed, evaluated, and terminated, the range and scope of
the activities utilized to achieve intelligence objectives,
and the propriety and utility of the activities undertaken.

. Second, we will examine -in depth'certain specific subjects
within the broad topics of investigation. (We would, of
course, welcome your suggestion of other cases that would
give added insight into intelligence matters under your
jurisdiction.) These specific subjects for investigation
are not intended to limit the scope contained in the more
general guestions.

The annexed notifications spell these matters out pate

- greater detail. In addition, they ask certain specific quest
set forth certain previously requested documents not yet rece
request additional documents,* and, in-some cases, ask for ea
names and present addresses of persons who have held certain

information and material, including. documents, whether or
not they have been bro to the Com tee's attention or

positions. Where appropriate, the subject's description
indicates, pursuant to the agreed Outline for Inquiry
Procedures, the matter primarily concerns allegations of abuse
or other controversial specific matters where there is reason
to believe improprieties may have occurred. Finally, the
notifications indicate the name(s) of the staff members(s)
who, in addition to the Committee's senior staff, will be
responsible for the particular -matters. :

The Committee, in the course of the next few months,
will undertake other subjects for investigation as its work

The Committee is examining the legal basis for FBI
intelligence and counterintelligence activities.
There may be serious question as to the adequacy
of the present legislative framework for the FBI's

so functions in these fields. Current statutes

—  ° authorize the FBI to perform investigative and law
enforcement functions, but they do not specifically
authorize intelligence or counterintelligence
activities. Therefore, the Committee seeks to
determine whether the FBI's authority should be

cal “ Clarified, revised, or incorporated in a compre-

hensive statutory charter.

The Committee is investigating the structure and
‘operating practices of the FBI Intelligence Divi-
sion. Proposals have been made that the national
security intelligence and counterintelligence
functions of the FBI should be lodged in a separate
~ agency or otherwise separated from the FBI's

eriminal investigative activities. Further recom-

“tion between the FBI and other intelligence agencies,
for strengthened supervision of FBI intelligence and,

counteorintclligence activitics by the Attorney

specific areas:

FBI Internal Security Intelligence Operations

The Committee seeks to determine the nature
_ and purpose of FBI intelligence operations
directed at foreign intelligence activities
and subversive or extremist activities within
the United States. It has been alleged that
the scope of FBI intelligence investigations
is too broad and has extended to legitimate
political activities.. Consequently, the Com-—

been the policies and procedures for coordina-
tion between the FBI and other agencies in the
U. S. intelligence community. There have been
occasions in the past where friction between
the FBI and other agencies has produced serious
dissatisfaction within the U. S. intelligence
community. The purpose of this inquiry is to
evaluate the adequacy of past and present co-

‘matters set forth in the following specific cases.

1. Warrantless Electronic Surveillance

The Committee seeks to determine whether the
Attorney General should have the authority

to authorize electronic surveillance for cer-
tain purposes without a prior judicial warrant.
This power has been exercised by succeeding
Attorneys General since 1940, upon the explicit
directive of the President. The Supreme Court
has ruled that this power does not extend to

Clandestine Informant Activities

‘The Committee is examining. all aspects of the

FBI's use of informants, sources, and undercover

-personnel and the techniques employed by such per-

sons. Although informants are the single most
productive source of intelligence information, the
aifficulties of controlling their activities may
inerease the possibility of improper conduct. The
use of informants to infiltrate organizations also

-may pose dangers to the right of associational pri-

vacy. Consequently, proposals have been made for
the imposition of a judicial warrant requirement
or other safeguards for the use of informants.
The Committee seeks to evaluate such proposals as
well as the contributions of informants to the

“accomplishment of legitimate objectives.

In addition, the Committee is examining informant
activities with respect to several particular situe-
tions and cases. This investigation may involve
specific allegations of abuse or twnttoversial
matters where there is reason to believe improprie-
ties may have occurred. The Committee's inquiry
covers the general circumstances surrounding the

‘following incidents or cases:

a. Wounded Knee;

b. Kent State; .

c.- New York v. Stroble (Attica);-

-@. United States v. Buckalew (Gainesville);

@. United States v. Briggs (Camden);

_f, New York v. Dillon (Hobart College);

g. United States v. Marshall (Seattle). — aeeace

* Additional cases may also be examined.

- In addition to the above cases, the Committee is

+ .examining the role of FBI informants in providing

information to the FBI concerning members of —_
following organizations:

Additional studies of informant activities with
respect to members of other organizations may be
formulated.

Questions

The Committee requests that the FBI and the Justice
Department address the following specific questions:

1. With respect to both categories of cases listed
above, what allegations, whether unfrounded or
not, of improper, illegal, unethical, or provoca~
tive conduct by FBI informants have been made in

2. What measures has the FBI taken to investigate
such allegations of misconduct and to prevent
such alleged misconduct from taking place in the
future? ~ ;

3. “What instructions has the FBI given to its in-

Director Sec'y —

Angleton recently testified under oath before three
Senators and Staff Members of the Senate Select Committee (SSC).
He appeared without counsel. During his testimony, Angleton
was asked numerous questions concerning his knowledge of
Israeli capabilities to conduct intelligence collection in the
United States. Among the questions asked Angleton were questions
bearing on Israeli efforts to gather nuclear information in
, the United States. Angleton indicated that the SSC apparently
"is aware of Angleton's past close relationship with the Israelis,
and Angleton feels that the questions directed to him by the
SSC may be related to information provided to the Committee by
correspondent Tad Szule who, according to Angleton, is writing .;

matters to be Deputy Associate Director James B, Adams. (4) 7)

In addition, Angleton advised that certain questions

he was asked dealt with alleged Soviet attempts to infiltrate

the CIA and other agencies. Again, Angleton avoided a direct

answer and indicated that the FBI would be the appropriate

agency to direct such questions to. Finally, Angleton commented

that in the event the Bureau thought it desirable he would be

happy to personally brief the Director or other appropriate

2. It is not believed appropriate to request
Angleton to brief the Director or other Bureau official
concerning his testimony, particularly since Angleton has
not seen fit to brief his former superiors at CIA. A request
by the Bureau for a briefing by Angleton might be misconstrued
if it were to come to the attention of Colby or other CIA
officials.

GENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)
RE: CONTACT OF WA, AND MRS, SCHAFER WITH STAYS MEMBERS OF SSC

Aceording to the Schafers, Nr. Epstein began the
interview with tha Schafers by stating the purpose of the
Senate Committee and why the Schafers were asked to Washingten,
B.C. My. Epctoin stated that the Committeo was trying to
develop information on want the U. 5, intelligence agencies
have been doing, what changes in these agencies are needed
and "where mistakes might have happened."

Tho Schafers advised they requested Mr. Epstein to
ask thea specific questions, He asked then what was the
entire period of tine of the Schafers' relationship with the
FRI avd if they wore still associated with the Bureau.
ir. Schafer told Mr. Epstein that he was not going to admit
any associntion with the FBI at this point and the reply seemed
to groatly upset ir. Epstein, Ye asked the Schafers why they
had come to Washington, 0, C. The Schaefers replied they
wanted to establish some groundwork for any relationship with
the Senate Committee, Mr. Epstein attempted ta have the
Schafcrs relate their activities in behalz of the FBI,

Nv, Schafer advised they refused to comply due to Mr, Epstein's
manner and presentation, The Schafers stated they received
the definite improsgion that Mx, Epstein and his colleagues
expected to hear an afternoon of interesting stories and
aneedotes,

Mes, Schafer told Mr. Epstein that they had done
nothing wrong, Illegal, immorai ox unethical in their
“novenent" activities and thoy were proud of thoiy contributions
to the nation's internal security, The Schafers related thoy
enjoyed a happy relationship with the FBI and they knew of
nothing questionable or unprofessional regarding the Burcan's
handling of thoir information, The Schafors said they made
at ¢hear that they would be happy to tell the SSC these
things; however, since they were not reassured by Mr. Epstein,
and wore in fact put off by hic manner and his colleagues!

SENATE SELECT COMMETTED ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITING (Sst)
RE: CONTACT OF HR. AND MRS. SCHATER WITH STATY MEMBERS OF SSC

According to the Schafers, Mx. Epstein and his
colleagues gava the clear impression that they wore disappointed
and annoyed with the Schafers' reluatance to tell them anything.
Mx. Epstein asked 42 the Schaters wanted to talk to any of
the Senators and tho Schofera stated they would bo willing
to speak to Senator Goldwater; however, Hr, Epyetein made no
specific arrangements other than to check with Charlie Lonbard,
Goldwnter's representative. Mr, Epstein did notmy if tha
Schaerg would be subpoenaed; nor wero any fira arrangements
made shout reimbursing them for their expenses. Aceording to
the Schafors, the sceting broke up rather abruptly and
uz, Epstein's colleagues left without saying good-by.

7 Tho Schafors stated they made an effort to be
friendly, cooperative and aucnablo to lr, Dnovein ond his
i. colicagues, und they made a goad faith gesture in npposring
before Mr. Epstein in Washington, D.C.

NOTE:

The Schafers, as paid informants, furnished
information from October, 1969, until March, 1975, to the
Bureau. Information in this LHM was contained in
New Orleans teletype to the Director, dated June 11, 1975,
Several personal statements made by the Schafers, such as
“pearded hippy" in reference to one of Epstein's colleagues,
were not included in the LHM as this type of information
is not fully germane and our reporting of it night be
inferred as our being prejudicial.

Legal Counsel to Adams, Memo
Re: SENSTUDY 75

We have prepared an airtel to San Francisco with an
enclosed letter for Mr. Todd in response to his request. We
are having the San Francisco Office hand deliver the letter
so that any questions he may have can be answered.

We have not regarded requests for interviews as
"demands" within the meaning of 28 CFR 16.22; therefore, no
release from the Department is necessary.

Regarding his request for access to Bureau files,
we have not had former employees make this request previously.
Our position should be that they not have access but rather
rely on their recollection. If they cannot answer a specific
question, the Committee can be referred to the Bureau.
RECOMMENDATION:

Attached Airtel with enclosed letter to Mr. Todd
be approved and sent.

June 11, 1975

Mr. Clarence M, Kelley Nee
Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation

Washington, D, C.
Dear Mr, Kelley:

On this date Supervisor Berryman of the San Fran-
cisco Office read to me a teletype to the effect the Bureau
had approved a secrecy release for me to respond to questions
from Senate investigator Lester B, Seidel in connection with
a Senate Select Committee on Internal Security investigation
of the CoIntelPro as it related to the Black Panther Party,
A copy of a letter from me to Mr. Seidel has been furnished
to the Bureau previously.

At the time I was designated supervisor of the ‘squad
handling internal security investigations of the Black Panther
Party (BPP), the BPP was international in scope; Eldridge
Cleaver and others had been granted asylum in Algeria; the
BPP had support and/or branches in France, Germany, Scandinavia
and China, Aspects of the counter intelligence program
approved by the Bureau of which I am aware were directed against»;
gome BPP foreign operations, Thus, interrogation by the Senate v3
investigator may involve information disseminated to other +
government agencies under security classification and may ange
touch on foreign policy as well.

a
iB

Therefore, prior to furnishing information obtained
in ‘an official capacity to Mr. Seidel, who according to the
Bureau's teletype Will be in San Francisco in about two weeks,
I would like written confirmation of the release which was
furnished me orally, preferably an official document covering
any secrecy agreement made with the Bureau as well as releasing
me from the provisions of any applicable executive orders which
preclude disclosure of official information without approval of
the Attorney General or an authorized Departmental officer,

IT would also appreciate being advised 1f there is any limitation
on the scope of the material which I may release,

f
8

BY.

FORMATION

Since the Bureau's teletype also approved a secrecy
release for current SAO Charles Bates, this presupposes he
will be authorized to furnish Mr. Seidel with the contents of
files if Mr, Seidel so requests, Therefore, I would also
appreciate advice as to whether I will be permitted to refresh
my recollection by reviewing official files prior to or during
the interview with Mr. Seidel,

Division this date reviewed 693-page CIA document containing
information relating to joint ventures involving CIA and
other members of intelligence community in sensitive matters,
and a specific request has been made for CIA to furnish this
Bureau with copies of all material contained therein believed
to have a bearing on FBI activities.

DETAILS:

By memorandum 6/24/75 you were advised that
arrangements had been effected whereby a CIA representative
would on 6/25/75 bring to FBIHQ a copy of the 693-page document
containing a series of memoranda and reports prepared by CIA
citing instances wherein CIA may have engaged in activities
outside the perimeter of its charter. As you have been advised,
members of the Senate Select Committee (SSC) have had prior Zi
access to this document and it contains numerous references
to FBI-CIA joint ventures, some of which are of an extremely pe
sensitive nature. CIA Director William Colby authorized a
review of this document and agreed to this Bureau obtaining
a copy of material contained therein believed pertinent to

this Bureau's operations.

Attached is a FD 302 reporting a conversation
SA Paul V. Daly had with Mr. Paul Wallach, staff member of
United States Senate Select Cofiitttes on Intelligence
Activities. The gist of the conversation is that Mr. Wallach
informed SA Daly that he had a list of national security

use this list for committee business including for interview
purposes if the Bureau did not promptly comply with the Committee's
request for a list of mail covers.

The contents of the attached FD 302, were: orahkly.firmished
on 6-18-75 to Deputy Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination,
Michael Shaheen of the Department. Mr. Shaheen and Mr. O'Connor,
Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination, contacted
F. A. O. Schwartz, Chief Counsel to the Senate Select Committee,
to protest Mr. Wallach's actions. Mr. Wallach denied, ina
conversation with Mr. O'Connor, that he had stated he had such
a list to SA Daly. Subsequent to this conversation with
Mr. O'Connor, and on the same day according to Mr. Shaheen,

Wallach called Shaheen and told Shaheen that he wanted to talk :

to him off the record, at which point Mr. Wallach stated that | Li
he had access to a list of mail covers through a source of his, f

but did not have possession of same. He also stated that he
may have suggested to SA Daly that he had such a list.

Mr. Shaheen stated that it was obvious that Wallach
could not be trusted and remarked that the Department had been
keeping book on him. Shaheen informed SA Daly that Wallach

had contacted Mr. Cox, Chief Counsel for the United States Postal
Service, at which time he informed Mr. Cox that the White House

had authorized the release of all national security mail covers,

and requested Cox furnish same to him. According to Shaheen,

Cox then contacted the White House to determine if Wallach's

story was in fact true, at which time James Wilderotter, Assistant .
Counsel to the President, advised that Wallach's name was unfamiliar
to him, and that :he. had not been given authority to obtain

national security mail covers. Mr. Shaheen stated he, at the
direction of Mr. O'Connor, was furnishing the Bureau in writing, a
report of his conversations with Wallach and also stated that
O'Connor stated he would no longer have any dealings with Wallach
because of the Obyieus unethical conduct and lack of honesty on
Wallach's part.

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

Mr. Paul Wallach, staff member of the United States Senate
Select Committee on Intelligence Activities, telephonically contacted me on
6-18-75 between 2:30 and 3 o'clock P,M., and inquired as to the status of a
request by the Committee concerning mail cover information, He asked if I
could furnish him a time when he might expect our response to be delivered
to him. He pointed out that he had had previous discussions with me and
Mr. Shaheen of the Department concerning this matter, and Mr. Shaheen
had indicated to him that he could expect the response to have been given to
him by this time. Mr. Wallach was informed that a time certain for
delivery of a response concerning this request could not be given, and it
was explained to him that a vast amount of material was being reviewed
pursuant to request of the Senate Select Committee and other committees of
Congress and that because of the amount of work involved in all these requests
it was not possible to make a judgment as to the date of the response.

Mr. Wallach indicated he felt he had been misled by Mr. Shaheen
into believing that he would have a response to his request and that he was
going to recontact Mr. Shaheen. He made a general inquiry as to whether one
Agent might be gathering all the information and as to whether he might be
allowed to come to FBI Headquarters and review what has been gathered to
this point. He was informed that all disclosures have to receive proper
Bureau approval and that it would not be possible for him to review such
information in the absence of such approval. He asked if the Bureau could
separate the response by making available immediately portions of the mail
cover lists such as the identities of people who were the targets of mail
covers in the domestic field. He again was informed that this was not
possible in the absence of proper approval. Mr. Wallach stated that he
wanted me to know that he was in possession of a list of Bureau mail covers
for the past five years which he had been furnished by a source whom he did
not identify. He was asked (1) if this list concerned the mail covers in the
national security areas and, (2) was it a national list. Mr, Wallach stated it
was a national list in the national security areas. He stated he was not sure
of its accuracy. He indicated that he would have no reservations about using
the list to conduct the Senate Select Committee business and stated that inter-
views may be conducted based on the list.

it ond its contents are not to be distributed outside your agency.



He was advised that the list would contain sensitive information
which would seriously impair ongoing Bureau investigations. He replied that
the names were not classified, and since they were not classified he would
have no problem in using the list. It was explained to Mr. Wallach that
despite the fact it was not classified the list would be extremely sensitive
since it would impair many ongoing investigations and in many instances the
very fact that we are interested in an individual indicates that we are in
possession of sensitive information concerning that individual. Mr. Wallach
pointed out that if this were the case, acknowledging that he had been informed
previously that one of the reasons for the necessity for closely reviewing the
material to be made available was because of this problem, then the Bureau
should come forward with its own list and point out to him which of the names
are sensitive and which are not. Mr. Wallach stated that only one or two
other people had knowledge of the fact he possessed such a list.

Washington, D. C., on May 16, 1975, was voluntarily furnished to
the FBI by Miss Gandy aad by Mr’ John P. Mokr, former Assistant
to the Director of the FBI, who was present during the interview at

Miss Gandy was interviewed by itaff Members Mark
Gitenstein and Michael Epstein from approximately 10:30 a, m. to
1:00 p.m., and from 2:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. Staff Member Martha
Talley was also present during the morning session of the interview.
Miss Gandy was not placed under oath, and she was not advised of
her rights or that she could be represented by personal counsel.

iw The questioning of Miss Gandy was directed primarily
: toward obtaining information on procedures and personnel in the office
of former Director Hoover, on the floor plan of Mr. Hoover's office
suite, on the "Official and Confidential" (OC) files maintained in
Mr. Hoover's office, and on the destruction of Mr. Hoover's personal
correspondence by Miss Gandy after Mr. Hoover's death.

Mr. Hoover's office suite and that the questions showed a special : (
interest in the rear exit of the suite. She explained that this exit Load

used by Mr. Hoover since it was most convenient to his private
office. Mr. Mohr stated that Mr. Gitenstein had attempted to draw
achart of Mr. Hoover's office. Since that chart was a poor one,
Mr. Giteastein asked Mr. Mohr to draw a rough chart of the office,
which Mr. Mohr did. Mr. Mohr recalls that he inadvertently omitted
the supply room from the chart; which room, he said, would have beea
of little or no significance to the questioners since it contained only

and no files. Mr. Mohr said concerning the beck door to
Mr, Hoover's office, that interviewers were informed that persons
visiting Mr. Hoover were not brought through this back door, which
was for Mr. Hoover's use.

Miss Gandy was asked by Staff Members about the use
of the conference room, who attended the conferences, and the purpose
of the conferences. She said that Mr. Mohr explained that the Director

Mr. Ronald E. Thompson.

Miss Gandy was asked if the Office Manager, Miss Holmes,
had files in her office and she answered,"no." She was asked if the Office
Manager's secretary, Miss McCord, had files in her office and she |
anawered that Miss MeCord did have those files necessary to her super-
viaion of office personnel and maintensace. She also explained the

RE: INTERVIEW OF HELEN W. GANDY

- Miss Gandy was asked whether files were kept in the
Telephone Room and answered that the only files kept there were
background material necessary to the functioning of that office. She
was asked if a record was kept of telephone calls and visitors to the
Director. She replied that a daily log was maintained, and that these
logs were permanently filed in the main Bureau files.

Miss Gandy was asked if files were kept in the office
of the mail clerk, Miss Mooney. She answered "yea," and described
these files as mainly photograph files and acrapbooks.

Concerning the mai] in Mr. Hoover's office, Mr, Mohr
said Mr. Gitenstein raised a question about "Expedite Processing” of
mail, to which Miss Gandy replied that the personal and confidential
mail for Mr. Hoover was handled by Miss Mooney and that she,

Miss Gandy, was not aware of just how this mail was handled. Mr. Mohr
said he explained to the questioners that this mail was received in the
Routing Unit of the Records and Communications Division and was

taken unopened to Miss Mooney, bth proended The clerical employee

for his information. Miss Gandy told the questioners that she received
a copy of the commitment card and that these cards were act retained
permanently. Mr. Mohr said that it was explained to the interviewers |
that the Bureau had an instruction that items of a temporary nature |

that
Mr. Hoover's office made certain the Telephone Room employees were
promptly advised of all Mr. Hoover's commitments as they were made.

Further, concerning the Telephone Room, Mr. Mohr
said the interviewers were informed that calls for Mr. Hoover were
received in the Burean switehboard and were then referred to the
Telephone Room in Mr. Hoover's office. The employees in the Tele-
phone Room connected Mr. Hoover with the calls. Mr. Mohr said
the iaterviewers asked whether the Telephone Room "screened"

Mr. Hoover's calls and that they were informed that the Telephone
Room did not “sereen" them except for “aut" calla.

Miss Gandy said she informed interviewers, in response
to questions, that she did receive calls from persons wishing to speak
with Mr. Hoover and if he was in his office, the calls would be transferred
to his Telephone Room. She said Mr. Gitenstein made a remark about
a special telephone connection between Mr. Hoover and former Attorney
General Robert Kennedy and also remarked that Mr. Hoover and former
Attorney General Jobn Mitchell also had a special telephone connection.
Miss Gandy said she corrected Mr. Gitenstein immediately by informing
him that no special telephone connection existed with any Attorney
General except Attorney General Kennedy.

Concerning the OC files maintained in Mr. Hoover's
office suite, Miss Gandy said she informed the interviewers that these
files were kept in a locked file cabinet and occupied about one and

one half or two file drawers. In answer to questions from the
interviewers, Miss Gandy said she informed them that on the day of
Mr. Hoover's death she spoke with Mr. Clyde Tolson, who was then
Acting Director of the FBI, and with Mr. Mohr and asked to whom

Mr. Toleon instructed that the OC files and all other
Bureau material sech as interesting cases, monographs and manuals
be delivered to Mr. Mark Felt who then was Assistant Director-Deputy
Associate Director of the FBL Miss Gandy said she was exhaustively
questioned by Mr. Epstein as to whether she called Mr. Tolson or he
called her and concerning Mr. Tolson's location at the time.
Miss Gandy said she told Mr. Epstein that at this late date she had
no idea who called whom but Mr. Epstein was assured that she and
Mr, Tolson communicated. She was also asked when Mr. Tolson
arrived at Mr, Hoover's house on the morning of Mr. Hoover's death.
She answered that Mr. Tolson arrived there soon after Mr. Hoover's
body was discovered. Miss Gandy said she asked the interviewers if
they desired more details of that morning and was told that they did not.

Mise Gandy said she told the interviewers that Mr. Tolson's
instructions were carried out. The OC files and the index cards
pertaining to them and the other Bureau material meationed above were
placed in cartons and delivered to Mr. Felt. She was asked who
delivered the cartons to Mr. Felt's office and answered that she
believed that the delivery was handled by messengers or maintenance
personnel, but indicated she was not certain about this.

Miss Gaady said she told the interviewers that as soon
. L. Patriek Gray II was named to head the FBI, Mr. Felt

After Mr. Gray indicated a very special interest in the files in
office, the contents of these files were explained to him and he

was invited to view the contents. Mr. Gray did glance through a
drawer and obviously was satisfied that they contained personal
correspondence only and was also satisfied that the Bureau material
bad been delivered to Mr. Felt.

Miss Gandy said one of the interviewers remarked that
there appeared to be more OC files than had been indicated aad that a
larger number bad been given to Attorney General Levi. She responded
that she would not know whether other files had been added to the group
after they had besa delivered to Mr. Felt. Mr. Gitenstein, she said,
attempted to show her a pamphlet apparently containing testimony of
the Attorney General which described certain of the files in question.
Mr. Gitenstein asked her about specific cases im the OC files and she
told him that after three years she would not presume to try to
remember specifies. Mr. Gitensteia asked if there was a file containing
reports from the Washington Field Office. She told him that she
certainly would not remember such a file, if one existed.

Miss Gandy said there was much questioning about the
index cards which pertained to the OC [iles. She told the interviewers
that they were filed in one index file, that cards of a different color
were used and that this index file was locked.

Mise Gandy said she told the interviewers that strictly

May 15, 1975

Present at questioning - Mark Gitenstein
Mike Epstein
Martha Talley (morning session only)
Jomn P. Mohr
Helen W. Gandy

The first questions concerned the set-up of the Director's
office suite. Special interest was indicated in the rear
exit of the suite and it was explained that this exit was
used by the Diredtor as it was most convenient to his private
office. tir. Mohr also mentioned the kitchen and lavatory,

as the questioners appeared to be completely unfamiliar with
the arrangement of the suite.

Next, the conferen¢e room was described and in answer to
questions the use of the conference room was explained - also,
information was given re the contents of the bookcases in this
room, ie, miscellaneous books; the Criminal Code volums;
the ring binders of Interesting Cases.
Numerous questio,ns were asked:
How often did the Director call conferences of
the officials of the Bureau «
what were the purposesof these conferences -
v just who attended them -
were they called by the Director « and was this
at set and regular intervals.
Mr. Mohr explained that tle Direétor from time to time,
as he reviewed matters of policy and like matters that
came to his attention, made notes which he discussed with
the officials, giving them his ideas on these matters and
in turn listening to their views. These sessions considered
oxgr 411 matters re Bureau administration and policy.

Three; The physical set-up of the office of the Executive
' Assistant;
I was asked re the number of file cases in my office «
I answered that I could not, at this date, be positive,
° but I believe there were approximately ten or twelve five-
drawer cabinets =
What were the contents of these cabinets and where
were the so-called o.c. files ~ were the o.¢. files
contained in combination locked cabinets -
I answered that all of the cabinets in my office were
~ secured with special locks and key, and that the key was
kept in a special locked keyscabinet in this office.
Questions-did I receive calls for the Director from
his friends and others, and did I transfer them to
his desk; did I make memoranda of such calls; did I
- . keep a diary; (Mr. Gitenstein made a remark re a
_' ** spe¢ial telephone connection between the Director
arid "Bokby", apparently thought better of it, and
'Yemarked that Mr. Mitchell had such a connection)

He was immediately corrected by me to the effect

that no such connection existed with Attorneys

General other than Attorney General Kennedy.
I answered that I did receive calls from persons wishing
to speak with the Director; that, if he were in his office,
such calls.would be transferred to the Director's Office
telephone room to be connected with the Director if he
should be in his office and could take the call. (Here
Mr. Mohr explained in @tail the system of handling tele-
phone calls in the Director's office and the functions of
the FBI telephone switchboard. )

It was explained that the file cabinets in my office
contained strictly personal correspondence of the Director;
« thet from time to time during the past fifty years files
which were no longer current were eliminated,
Re the so-called o.c. files.~ it wag explained that. these
'- files were located in one of the locked cabinets; that there
ivy Were, possibly one and a half or two file drawers of these.
In answer to questioning it was explained that on the day
. of Mr. Hoover's death I spoke with both. Mr. Tolson, who at
“ that time was Acting Director, and Mr. Mohr, and asked for
instructions as. to whom I should deliver the 6fficial-
confidential files and other Bureau material contained in
the Director's offices. I also advised Mr. Tolson of
v My. Hoover's expressed instructions that his personal
correspondence be destroyed, and that he, Mr. Hoover, had
begun a review of these personal files sometime previaus to
» his death, and some already had been destroyed. Mr. Tolson
instructed that the offictal-confidential files and all
other Bureau material, ie, Interesting Cases; monographs,
Manuels, be delivered to Mr. Mark Felt. (Here, I was asked
» Where the Bureau material was kept and answered that book.
eases in my offre were used for this purpose.
I was exhaustively questioned by Mr. Epstein as to whether -
I called Mr. Tolson (and where he was. located at the time)
<y,- or whether Mr. Tolson called me. I told him that at this
Tate date I had no idea as to who called whom, but that he
Was assured that Mr. Tolson and I communicated. I also was
asked when Mr. Tolson ar; pred at Mr. Hoover's house on the
morning in question and/Was told Mr. Tolson arrived after
Mr. Hoover's body was discovered. (I asked if more details
J of that morning were desired and was told no.)

I_explatmed that instructions were immediately carried out}
the o.c. files, with the™index cards pertaining to then,
together with the above mentioned Bureau material, was placed

- in cartons and delivered to Mr. Felt. I was asked who carried
these cartins to Mr. Felt's office and said I could not at
this date answer this but I believe they would nave been
carried by either messengers or maintenance personnel.

“There was quite much questioning here as to how and where the
index cards were filed. It was explained that they were filed

& an the ome index file » cards of a different color being used,
and that this file also was locked.

LNW 65360 Docld:32989611 Page 117


NW 65360 Docid:32989611 Page 118

In connection with the above authorizations it was

explained that as soon as Mr. Gray was named as the

new Director Mr. Felt brought him to the Director's

office to afford him an idea of the office set-up;

that Mr. Gray indicatéd a very special interest in

the files in my office; that. their contents were ex=

plained to him and that he was invited to view the

contents. He did glance thru a drawer and obviously

was satisfied that they contained personal correspondence

@Qnly, and was also satisfied that the Bureau material hed:

been delivered to Mr. Felt. One of the questioners

remarked that, there appeared to be more o.c. files than
b had been indicated; that a larger number had been given

to Attorney General Levi...I remarked that I would not
know whether other files had been added to the RBroup
after they had been delivered to Mr. Felt. Mr. Gitenstein
then attempted to show me a pamphlet indicating what
appeared tb be testimony of the Attorney General describing
certain of the files in question and asked questions re
specific cases which were contained in the o.c. files. I
told him I would not presume, after three years, to try
to remember specifics. He asked if there were a file
containing reports from the Washington Field Office. I°°-
told him :gertainly I would not remmmber such a file, if
ore existed.
To. questions regarding the destruction of personal _
correspondence files I explained that up until the
time I left the Bureau I continued to tear up and de- |
posit the contents of these files in the "confidential
trash"' waste baskets;. (Mr. Mohr here explained this
method of disposal.) that I had asked Mr. Gray if, in
order to vacate the office as soon as possible for his
convenience, I could have his approval to send to
Mr. Hoover's house files which could not be disposed of
before my date of retirement and finish the taskthere.
He did not hesitate to give me this pePmission. (Mr. Felt,
who was present when I spoke with Mr. Gray (in my office)
suggested that a locked room on the fifth floor, with a
key only I would have, could be made available so the files
would be disposed of without moving. *, ‘‘ .I said that
would not be necessary and Mr. Gray agreed. At this point
Mr. Gitenstein asked me if I thought I might not be the
only one with a key. I asked him what he would have thought
and he smiled and said he would have thought that.

Four: Questions were asked, in further connection with the

set-up of the office and personnel.
The office of the Office Manager (ifiss Holmes). Did she
have file cases in her office. The answer was "no".
The office of the secretary to the Office Mane,
Were there files in her office and if so what aia they contain.

.“ The answer was "yes" and the contents were material necessary
for use by the Office Manager in connection with her super=
vision of the office personnel, : and
maintainance.

The reception room. The function of th 3
carteinen le receptionist was

er (Miss McCord)



> Gn
ua" : C ) ®

The telephone room. Here, again, close questioning re
files kept in this office. Assurance was given that
the only files kept here were background material necessary
to the functioning of the office. Questions were asked
if records were made of telephone calls and visitors to
the Director. Information was given that a daily log was
maintained, and it was described. Question was asked re
where and how long the logs were maintained. Answer was
“ that they were permanently filed in the main Bureau files.
Mail clerk's (Miss Mooney) office. Were there files here?
Answer was yes, mainly photograph files and also the
serap books.

. The names of Miss Holmes - Mrs. Metcalf » Miss McCord =
Ron Thompson and Miss Mooney were requested and given.

At one point during the sessions in being questioned re the
va Director's being advised of Bureau matters the questioners were
told by. both Mr. Mohr and me that Mr. Hoover never was out of
boone with the Bureau, dey or night, whether in town or out of
own. :

Also, I said at a point when the questioning appeared to be
getting pretty €ar afield, if what they were trying to learn
was whether there was contained in the o.c. files anything that
onde be used for political purpose, the answer was NO + that

had never found the need to lie about anything.

RE: MISS GANDY'S QUESTIONING BY SENATE
SELECT COMMITTEE INVESTIGATING
FEDERAL AGENCIES WITH INTELLIGENCE-
GATHERING FUNCTIONS

Miss Gandy and I appeared before the staff of the
subcommittee for questioning on May 15, 1975, our appointment
being set for 10:30 a.m. The group consisting of Messrs. Gitenstein,
Epstein and M. S. Talley immediately proceeded to the former
Carroll Arms Apartment building which is now used as an office
building by the U.S. Senate. We were taken to the sixth floor where
we entered an empty office which contained telephone equipment,
some chairs, and a desk.

Mr. Gitenstein had apparently drawn up a list of
questions he wished to discuss with Miss Gandy and he referred to
this list throughout the questioning period.

There is attached a rough draft memorandum
consisting of four pages and dated May 15, 1975, which was prepared by
Miss Gandy concerning her recollection of what transpired during
the interview. The interview, incidentally, lasted until
lp.m. when a one-hour break was taken for lunch. The session
reconvened at 2 p.m. and was terminated at 3 p.m.

I am setting forth hereafter in numbered paragraphs
items which I recollect transpired during the interview which
should be helpful in embellishing Miss Gandy's me morandum.

(1) During the early part of the questioning, Mz. Gitenstein
attempted to draw a chart of Mr. Hoover's office in the Department of
Justice building. He said he had previously visited Mr. Kelley's suite in
the Justice Building. His effort at charting the office was poor at best
1 and he requested my assistance. A rough chart was drawn showing
Mr. Hoover's personal office on one end and Miss Mooney's office on
the other end. In making up the chart I inadvertently left out the supply
room which, of course, would have been of little or no significance to
the questioners since this room contained supplies only and no files.

NW 65360 Docld:32989611 Page 120



(2) Sometime during the interview, Mr. Gitenstein
raised a question about "Expedite Processing" of mail and how it was
handled in Mr. Hoover's office. Miss Gandy pointed out that the
handling of personal and confidential mail for Mr. Hoover was
handled by Miss Mooney and she, Miss Gandy, was ot Siar Sah
just how this mail was handled. I explained that all) Riasies ecelvi
in the Routing Unit of the Records and Communications Division
was taken unopened to Miss Mooney in Mr. Hoover's office where
she opened this mail and the clerical employee who brought the mail
down then logged it in and stamped the mail "Expedite Processing"
on the left-hand edge. Thereafter the clericd employee would take
the log ba¢k to the Routing Unit and when the mail was subsequently
returned to the Routing Unit for regular filing purposes the item
would be crossed off the log. Mr. Gitenstein wanted to know
if the "Expedite Processing" logs were maintained permanently and
he was informed that to my knowledge they were not kept after accounting
for the particular items of mail contained on the particular log.

g onfidential
et

y

(3) Mr. Epstein qiestioned Miss Gandy at length

concerning her title as "Executive Assistant." He wanted to know when
she acquired this title and she said she could not recall. He wanted
to know whether anyone else at the FBI had occupied this position and
Miss Gandy explained that she was the only employee with the
title of Executive Assistant who had served under Mr. Hoover during
his tenure in office. Mr. Epstein seemed to pay a great deal of

Va attention to the title Executive Assistant and I endeavored to explain
to him that the title was a Civil Service Commission title and that
Miss Gandy's position-was set up under the Classification Act administered
by the Civil Service Commission. Although I am not sure what was
behind Mr. Epstein's lengthy questioning about] this matter, I got the
impression he might be trying to find out if Miss Gandy acted for Mr. Hoover
on her own initiative. This is just a guess on my part and I am not sure
what was behind his questioning.

(4) During Miss Gandy's description of the various
offices, she did mention specifically the fact that the interesting case
files were maintained on the shelves in the big conference room in black

~ folders. They asked what the interesting case files consisted of and I
explained this to their satisfaction; namely, that they were writeups of
closed cases which might be of irt erest for various purposes.

NW 65360 Docid:32989611 Page 121



(5) I should mention that Miss Gandy in describing exactly
how Mr. Hoover's personal correspondence files were destroyed said
she reviewed each item that she handled to make sure that it was not
related to Bureau official business. She had previously indicated
~~ that Mrs. Erma Metcalf had assisted her in destroying these files
but she did not mention that Mrs. Metcalf endulged in the same type of review and
Miss Gandy was not questioned whether Mrs. Metcalf had made such a
review as she went through the files and helped destroy them.

(6) Both Mr. Gitenstein and Mr. Epstein queried Miss Gandy
at length about the log kept in the Telephone Room of all calls taken by
Mr. Hoover. They also queried her at length concerning a log that was
L kept in the Telephone Room of all visitors to FBI Headquarters who were
seen by Mr. Hoover. Miss Gandy explained that these logs, to her knowledge,
were currently retained in the regular Bureau file room.

(7) Miss Gandy was asked regarding Mr. Hoover's commitments
and she explained that each morning the employees in the Telephone Room
prepared a commitment card of Mr. Hoover's commitments for the day
and this card was placed on Mr. Hoover's desk the first thing in the
morning for his information. Miss Gandy reported that she received a
copy of this commitment card. She was asked whether these commitment
cards were rdained permanently and she replied in the negative. Somewhere
along the line it was explained to the interviewers that the Bureau had an
instruction that all items of a temporary nature, such as ticklers and the

+ - like were to be destroyed after they were 90 days old. Miss Gandy

indicated these commitment cards would have come under this category

for destruction. Miss Gandy was queried at length as to just how the
Telephone Room employees got their information to make up the commitment
card and she explained that all employees in Mr. Hoover's office made
certain the Telephone Room employees were promptly advised of all of

Mr. Hoover's commitments as they were made.

(8) In explaining the telephone set-up in the Department of Justice

building as far as it related to the FBI, the Staff members were informed
that calls for Mr. Hoover were received in the Bw eau's switchboard and
were then referred to the Telephone Room in Mr. Hoover's office and the
employees in the Telephone Room handled the problem of connecting

it~ Mr. Hoover with the caller. They wanted to know whether employees in
the Telephone Room screened Mr. Hoover's telephone calls and they were
informed Telephone Room employees did not screen them except for "nut"
calls.

(9) During a rather heated conversation in the afternoon
Y about some of the questioning being done which seemed to be repetitious and

NW 65360 Docld:32989611 Page 122 -3-



irrelevant, Mr. Gitenstein was told by me that I felt it was high time

the questioners quit "beating around the bush" and came to the point by

asking Miss Gandy if she had ever destroyed any official and

confidential files. Mr. Gitenstein replied they had a discrepancy

concerning the O and C files in that a reliable source had reported

that Mr. Mark Felt had five two-drawer cabinets marked ''O and C Files”

in his office. Miss Gandy on the other hand told Mr. Gitenstein in

response to a question that she had turned over to Mr. Felt after

Mr. Hoover's death, as she recollected, one and one-half drawersand

possibly two drawers. of O and C files. I explained to Mr. Gitenstein

that Miss Gandy would have no way of knowing what files Mr. Felt had

in his office and if there was a discrepancy the person to resolve the

discrepancy was Mr. Felt who Mr. Gitenstein had told me previously

had been interviewed by him and had been cooperative. I had previously

explained to Mr. Gitenstein in response to que stions he asked me when I

appeared before the Staff that at the time Mr. William C. Sullivan had

furnished the data of the 17 White House telephone taps to Mr - Mardian in

the Internal Security Division of the Department that Mr. Hoover had _
a insti cted that any Assistant Director or Bureau official who had any

files in his office he considered to be confidential and relating to the

Bureau's work were to be immediately transferred to Mr. Felt and

a memorandum prepared concerning exactly what was transferred to

Mr. Felt. I told Mr. Gitenstein I had no idea how many files Mr. Felt

collected as a result of Mr. Hoover's instructions. It is interesting to

“ note that I was not asked at any time whether I lad turned over any files
to Mr. Felt in connection with Mr. Hoover's instructions.

(10) Miss Gandy was asked whether there were any files.
yo Mr. Hoover's personal correspondence in Mr. Hoover's former hone
at the present time. Miss Gandy replied no. :

(11) At some point during the interview a reference was
made to the confidential trash baskets maintained in the Bure au, to wit,
the trash baskets with the painted rim-.on top. Mr. Epstein wanted to
know if a log was maintained of items placed in the confidential trash
baskets for destruction. I informed him it wuld be ridiculous to think

a that such a log could be maintained and he was advised exactly how
confidential trash is destroyed in the Bureau. He was also informed of
the Bureau files that were scattered over the streets of Southwest Washington
as a result of the Department of Justice engaging in destruction of some of
their files. This reference permitted an immediate termination of any
questions along the lines of the destruction of confidential trash.

: -4-
NW 65360 Docld:32989611 Page 123



aa (12) Miss Gandy refers to the fact that questions were
| raised concerning Mr. Hoover's back door entrance. The questions
concerning this back door were to determine just who used this
back door entrance and its purpose. In addition to explaining it was
immediately adjacent to the elevators at 9th and Pennsylvania Avenue
_ which Mr. Hoover used to enter and exit the building, they were also
V advised that this was Mr. Hoover's private and personal entrance and
that persons wishing to see Mr. Hoover were not brought through this
back door.

| The foregoing is submitted for information purposes and
as an auxiliary record of Miss Gandy's appearance before the Staff of the
Senate Select Committee on May 15, 1975, accompanied by me,
John P. Mohr.

G canal. 3
On 6/9/75, Mr. K. William O'Connor advised me that the Bi ates
Senate Select Committee would like to obtain access to Appendices A
through E of the original Petersen Committee report on COINTELPRO.
He advised that the Deputy Attorney General had requested him to
determine by the morning of 6/10/75 whether the FBI would object to
disclosing the Appendices to the Committee, Subsequently, Mr. O'Connor
sent me a copy of a notehe addressed to the Deputy Attorney General .
dated 6/9/75, and its enclosure (a copy of a letter from Senator Church

to the Attorney General dated 6/9/75), both of which pertain to the

Senate Select Committee request to have access to Appendices A through
E of the Petersen report. The letter also requests access to Appendices
K and L for inspection by designated Committee staff at the Department of
Justice (Copies of these two are attached).

Previously, the Intelligence Division has been requested to

review Appendices A through E which are summaries of the several
CONINTELPRO programs. This memorandsnshould be referred to the
Intelligence Division to indicate the need to expedite that review and to
Returnish appropriate recommendations to the Director concerning any ~

IMobjections the FBI should have to disclosure of the Appendices requested. |
Sin view of the urgency of the information furnished by Mr. O'Connor ”
it is suggested that this memorandum serve as the authority for the disclosing
of the requested Appendices in the absence of any strong objections, by. the | in
Intelligence Division.

ADDENDUM: INTELLIGENCE DIVISION 6/10/75 fae

Intelligence Division strongly feels Exhibits A through E should not
be made available. These constitute work papers prepared on an expedite
basis by Special Agents operating under the understanding their effort was
of @ rough draft nature which would be utilized by a committee of the Justice
Department and FBI for an in-house investigation. The Agents preparing
the documents never conceived that their effort would be subject to review
outside of the Department and particularly outside the Executive Branch.

By letter dated 4/21/75 to the Attorney General it was pointed
out these exhibits related to the internal deliberations of the Department
and FBI representatives, some of the material in these summaries is
classified and relates to sensitive operations and they should not be revealed.
Also, Deputy Attorney General Lawrence Silberman in testimony before the
Civil Rights and Constitutional Rights Subcommittee (Edwards Committee)
on 41/20/74 indicated as regards these documents, "If we had thought it was
appropriate to release the full discussion we would have done so at the time.
There are a lot of internal working documents which go into the making of a
final report. *

Further, if these documents are released to the SSC, or if the
Coremittee is allowed access to them, we would not then be in a position to
deny access to them by the Edwards Committee or the House Select Committee
on Intelligence (‘Nedzi), Should they be released and come within the public
domain, we could then be in a position of violating individual rights of privacy
and compromising sensitive investigative techniques and Bureau sources.

We feel we should first go through these work papers and excise such items
to avoid any such complication.

June 9, 1975

: The Honorable Edward H. Levi
Attorney General . a
Department of Justice i .
Washington, D. C. 20530 :

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

. Thank you for your letters of May WT and May 23,
1975, informing the Select Committee of five additional
COINTELPRO-type operations disclosed by the continuing FBI
review of its counterintelligence files. The Committee ap-
preciates your candor in disclosing the sensitive aspects of
these programs. Pursuant to its rules, the Committee will
handle this information with the necessary security. —

I have been informed that a member of the Commit-
tee staff has inspécted and taken notes on the 39-page
report of the Petersen committee on COINTELPRO. I believe
that our security arrangements are more than sufficient to
safeguard the confidentiality of its contents. The Commit~
tee members themselves as well as the staff would be con-
veriienced by its availability in our secure facilities.

I believe that it is vitally important for the Com-
mittee to be provided with Appendices A through E of that
report. These documents will also be handled according to
our stringent security arrangements. In addition, Appendices
K and L should be made available for inspection by designated
Committee staff at the Department of Justice. I understand
that Ae appendices are not "raw files" of the FEI.

These requests do not preclude the Committee from further
‘pursuing its original request for COINTELPRO materials.

: Finally, I cannot emphasize too much the importance
to the Select Committee's work of fully understanding COINTEL-
PRO matters. In this regard, I wish to thank you again for
ealling the new materials, which we will follew up in due
¢ourse, to our attention.

understood that the FBI raw files question was most
sensitive, and that he would propose to have staff of

mation in these Exhibits was not sufficient for their
‘purposes, to then reatiest an expanded summary of any
particular topic summarized, without reaching the issue

would like personal access. .

7 I discussed as an alternative, access to the
initiating documents in the COINTELPRO matters; and
_ that I would attempt to obtain those as an alternative

ye solution to his inquiry. He said that he might be
interested in those documents, but they were far less
- important to him than access to A-E. He reiterated

his sensitivity to the question of raw files, and. 7

t : an appropriate time, the Committee would wish to explore,
4 . by AG testimony at SSC, the actions of the DOJ on the

. recommendation reflected in the report. I said that I

understood his interest in that process.

My recommendation is that, in view of ‘the retrench-
ment regarding "raw files", A-E be made available, under
the conditions outlined above; I am furnishing a copy of
this memorandum to Mr. Daly for dissemination to appro-
priate Executives of the Bureau, and to Mr. Maroney of
the Criminal Division.

I believe a prompt decision as to A-E would be
most helpful.

Memorandum to Mr. Cleveland
Re: Senate and House Select Committees
on Intelligence Activities

Referenced memorandum pointed out that Mr. Clarke
anid Mr, Moore were of the opinion that since Senator Church's
Committee was already following the procedures outlined in
the Memorandum of Understanding, and had completed the
Committee Staff, it would be inappropriate to furnish a copy
of the Memorandum of Understanding to Senator Church. How
would the Senate Select Committee know it is following the
procedures outlined intthe Memorandum of Understanding if
it does ndt have a copy? Does it have a copy of DCID 1/14
which has been, and possibly still is, classified?

The FBI has now received a request for a total
of 122 investigations from the Senate Select Committee.
This is many more than anticipated with all expenses absorbed
by the FBI in connection with a function of the Legislative
Branch. In addition, 16 requests have been received to
date from the House Select Committee, Also the FBI has been
asked by the Senate Select Committee to conduct additional
investigation concerning Patricia Ann Monaco, already employed
by the Committee, who admits living with Neal Stevens up
to 4-75, and frequenting a lounge known as a hangout for
prostitutes. Neal Stevens has said he engaged "in all forms
of sexual activities" with Monaco. There is also the definite
possibility that we will have to process many of these cases
under the Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act of 1974.

To date notification has been received from the
Director of Central Intelligence (CIA) that a total of 49
employees of the Senate Select Committee have been certified
as meeting requirements of EO 10450 (Security Requirements
for Government Employment) for access to classified information
up to and including Top Secret. Of this number, 17 staff
members have been briefed on compartmented information and an
additional 5 staff members designated to receive compartmented
information. From the above it is not clear that, as stated
by Mr. Clarke and Mr. Moore, that the Senate Select Committee
"had completed the Committee Staff."

It is noted that CIA refers to EO 10450 but the
| Memorandum of Understanding, as approved by CIA, does not
refer to EO 10450,

Mr, W. R. Wannall captioned "Senstudy 75" advised that the
Senate Select Committee (SSC) has made several requests of
the Bureau for information and documents relating to the
so-called "Kissinger 17!' This material is being made avail-
able to the Department with the caveats that the Government
has not publicly admitted to 15 of the coverages involved
and that some material contained in the file has been
impounded by court order due to the Halperin (one of 17)
civil suit. The decision as to whether or not the material
prepared in response to the SSC's request is to be turned
over to the Committee was left to the Department. As
mentioned in above memoranda, Mr. O'Connor advised that he
believed it necessary for a representative of his office to
personally review the file in question before a knowledgeable
determination could be made as to what material should be
turned over to the SSC, In anticipation of the Department's
cH eqasse Legal Counsel Division inquired of the Department's
G Division as to whether the court order of impoundment
woulc. prevent such a review. On 6/20/75, it vas ascertained
that USDC Judge John Lewis Smith, who issued the impoundment
order, gave court clearance to make the "Kissinger 17" file
available to the Department for revie:r as indicated above,

The Attorney General

NOTE:

By memorandum from Legal Counsel to Mr. J. B. Adams
dated 6/3/75 captioned "Senate Select Committee on Intelligence
Activities," Legal Counsel Division transmitted an “Eyes Only"
communication, dated 5/30/75, from the Executive Secretary
of the USIB Ad Hoc Coordinating Group. In its communication,
the USIB Group requested that recipients furnish Mr. James A.
Wilderotter, Associate Counsel to the President, with
suggestions for administrative or legislative action relative
to United States intelligence programs.

In response to USIB's request on behalf of
Mr. Wilderotter, INTD Supervisors have been canvassed for
suggestions and results obtained incorporated in communication
being attached for Attorney General's approval. Since USIB's
communication was marked "Byes Only," we have not specifically
referenced this document in our response to Mr. Wilderotter.
We are, however, providing copies of the USIB letter and our
response for the Attorney General's records and for the Office
of the Deputy Attorney General. The latter action would
appear appropriate, since the Department of Justice was
included among the recipients of the USIB letter, although
Inspector John B. Hotis of the Legal Counsel Division was
erroneously designated as the Departmental addressee by USIB.

My memorandum to you 6/17/75 reported upon a
6/13/75 meeting chaired by Mr. James Wilderotter, Associate
Counsel to the President, to discuss the functions of TFs
in connection with investigation of the intelligence community
by the Senate Select Committee (SSC). An enclosure to that
memorandum listed the various TFs and indicated those regarding
which the FBI was expected to be involved with. We were asked
to designate a specific individual who would coordinate with
the TF leader of TFs which were not assigned to FEI represens
tatives. The following designations are proposed:

Reference is made to memorandum from captioned
Committee dated May 14, 1975, and the appendices thereto, which
contained requests for information from the Federal Bureau of
nvestigation (FBI). Item 20, Part I, Appendix C, requested a list
of any Cointelpro-type activities, as defined in the prepared statement
of Attorney General Saxbe before the House Judiciary Committee on
November 20, 1974, which were engaged in by the FBI subsequent to
April 28, 1971, be provided.

In response to this request, it is noted all Counter-
intelligence Programs (Cointelpros) were discontinued by FBI
Headquarters airtel to Albany, with copies to all field offices, dated
April 28, 1971. Specifically, this communication listed seven Cointelpros.
In addition to the seven mentioned in the April 28, 1971, airtel,
subsequent reviews at FBI Headquarters disclosed five additional
Cointelpros. In this context, it should be noted several of the 12
Cointelpro operations related to FBI activities in the foreign counter-

Aseoe. ov, _.- tmtelligence field.

FBI Headquarters airtel April 28, 1971, discontinuing
7 the Cointelpros noted as follows, "In exceptional instances where it is

Documents Pertaining to the “Huston Plan,"
Cointelpro, and Other Practices aad Programs

A review of all of our files which have been referred
to as Cointelpro files revealed no Cointelpro-type activity since
April 28, 1971.

In foreign counterintelligence operations the objectives
are detection, penetration and, finally, neutralization of intelligence
operations directed against the United States by foreign intelligence
services or other hostile elements. Various neutr:

"Cointelp e" techniques are, and always have been, an integral

In an effort to comply fully with the request to provide
a Met of any Cointelpro type activities engaged in subsequent to April 28,
1971, in addition to the review of Cointelpro files noted above,
af the Intelligence Division were contacted during the week of June 2-6,
1975, to determine if any had knowledge of any euch actions. Excepting
foreiga counterintelligence operations, the results of this inquiry were
negative.

NOTE:

See letter to the Attorney General, dated 6/23/75, captioned
"United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities, "
prepared by DR:pld.

It is noted in one instance one individual alluded to the
TARPRO disinformation-type operation which has been directed against
the Soviet intelligence service as being of a Cointelpro character. It is
not believed this latter technique constitutes the type of information sought
by the Committee,

” FROM “RSD. Cotter :

SUBJECT: FBI INTELLIGENCE LETTER FOR THE PRESIDENT

This memorandum recommends that we extend our dissemination
of the FBI Intelligence Letter (Inlet) to include Vice President Agnew.

Inlet is outgrowth of Director's personal suggestion for a
channel of high-level intelligence directly to the President. It has provided
medium for furnishing President sensitive and top-level data in which he
would have direct interest and has been disseminated only to President and
Attorney General. Since first Inlet issued ll/7/69, we have prepared
86 issues which have summarized 120 individual items of significance
on a wide range of topics, including racial violence, New Left intrigue,
Soviet and communist bloc espionage, and important foreign intelligence
data. Material is presented in a one-page format tailored to the President's -

convenience,

Vice President Agnew in recent conversations with the Director
has indicated a keen interest in the information the Bureau has been furnishing
him in recent months regarding domestic and foreign subversion. It is
obvious the Vice President is relying on the Bureau as a key source of
information. In view of Mr. Agnew's vital interest in these matters and
the high position he occupies, it is believed we should at this time include
him in dissemination to Inlet.

ACTION: ane Samana

: If the Director approves, the Vice President will be included
in future dissemination of this material.

concerning sworn testimony given to the SSC by Mr. Robert R.

Nichols who served as an BA of the FEI from January 6, 7
= until Bie retirement May 12, 1972. This information is as
voluntarily furnished to the FEI by Nichols.

CIRCUMSTANCES PRELUDE TO TESTIMONY

On May 28, 1975, Nichols telephonically advised the
FBI that S8C Staff Member Lester 5B. Seidel had requested,
and Michols agreed, to travel to Washington, D. C., from
Atlanta, Georgia, to be interviewed in the Committee's
offices, Seidel indicated the interview would concern
Martin lather King, Jr., Stanley David Levison, and related
matters. Nichols was unable to advise whether it would be
a staff interview or an appearance for testimony purposes
before an Executive Session of the Committee. fie was not
told by Seidel that bis appearance would be pursuant to a
subpoena. Michols requested that the FBI make available a
representative so that Michols might consult with him during
the interview, if necessary. Nichols was informed that the
presence of a Bureau representative should not be interpreted
as the FBI furnishing counsel but that the representative
would merely assist Nichols in determining whether a specific
— question should be answered or whether a response could

divulge a sensitive investigative technique or method;

information which might divulge what had been furnished the

FBI by other Government agencies and/or foreign intelligence

sources; and information which might adversely affect an

ongoing investigation. It was pointed out to Nichols that
if he se desired, he could obtain private counsel, He was
im ited to obtain additional personal briefing on the early
morning of May 30, 1975, before his appearance before the
S8C, froa the Legal Counsel Division and the Intelligence
Division of the TBI

Early on the morning of May 30, 1975, Nichole was
briefed by the FBI, including advice to him that his
employment agreement with the FBI was being waived for the
purposes of the interview by the SSC to the extent that it
pertained to King, Levison and the Southern Christian

adership Conference (SCLC), the organization which had been
headed up by King. Nichols was reminded of the areas of
privilege and, at his request, was accompanied to the &8SC
offices by SA Seymor F. Phillips of the FBI.

At the SSC offices, Nichols and Phillips net

Mr, John Bayly of the office of the Minority Counsel of the
Committee who indicated that the interview would be under
cath. Staff Member Seidel then appeared and inquiry was
made of him by Phillips as to whether the interview would
be under oath, it being noted that it was only then, after
appearing at the SSC offices, that Nichols and Phillips
became aware of the cath aspects of the interview. When
Seidel said that Nichols would be interviewed in an Executive
Session, Phillips asked that he be permitted to confer with
FBI Headquarters as it would require clearance from the

Re: Testimony of Retired FBI
Special Agent (SA) Robert R.
Nichols Before SSC Executive Session

Nichols was questioned as to what type of
investigation concerning King was conducted besides the
use of a technical surveillance. Nichols replied that he
had attempted to initiate action to infiltrate the SCLC
with live informants but that every one of his suggestions
along this line was turned down by FBI Headquarters. Nichols
furnished the reason for these rejections as being that the
FBI did not want to interfere with civil rights organisations
but indicated that the Bureau had never told hia this in
the rejections and that it was his own rationale. Nichols
indicated that from time to time spot physical surveillances
would take place in Atlanta to verify contacts between King
and individuals known or suspected of being communists.
During this phase of the interview, Seidel mentioned the naze
of Harry Wachtel and Nichols acknowledged he was one of
King’s contacts. In response to a question as to whether or
not trash or mail covers were used against King, Nichols
reaponded that they were not.

Inquiry was made as to why so much reliance was
placed by the FBI on technical coverage of King and s0 little
was done in the way of physical surveillances, Seidel
pointed out that a technical surveillance of an individual
was a greater infringement of bis privacy than was a physical
surveillance. Nichols responded that the Bureau did what it
felt was necessary to get the information it needed. Seidel
then asked Michols how be would personally feel about a
technical surveillance on him, Nichols. Nichols’ response
was that he would rather have his phone tapped than to always
be followed around.

Nichols was questioned concerning the authority for
the technical surveillance of King and how Michols would
learn of such authority. Nichols explained that he would be

called into the office of the Special Agent in Charge and
told that advice from the Bureau had been received that the

Re: Testimony of Retired FBI

Nichols Before SSC Executive Session

Nichols was questioned about his contacts with
another retired FBI Agent, Alan Sentinella, to whom the King
case Was assigned after it had been handled by Nichols.
Nichols was asked if he had discussed his forthcoming
testimony with Sentinella who resides in Atlanta. Nichols
acknowledged that he had had a discussion with Sentinella
but that they had both puvposdly avoided any discussion of the
substance of Nichols’ testimony-to-be and the testimony which
Sentinella had already given the 83C, They discussed only
procedural aspects as Nichols wanted to have some idea in
advance as to what might be expected in any trip to Washington
to testify. It waa Nichols’ impression that Seidel thought
that Nichols was holding out some information on this matter.

On at least three occasions Seidel inquired of
Nichols as toe whether he had discussed his forthcoming
testimony with Charles Harding of Atlanta, a retired FAI
Agent who had also been acquainted with the King case in 1964.
On each ocewion, Nichols denied that he had had any discussion
with Harding on this matter.

Michols was questioned as to whether the technical
warveillance on King was justified and hia response was that
it was justified. hen asked why, Nichols stated that there
was considerable evidence of communist iafluences on King
inasmuch as King was receiving much advice in his work from
Levison and other communists. Seidel asked if they included
Jack O'Dell and Harry Wachtel and Nichols acknowledged that
it did. Whes Nichols was asked as to whether or not he had
developed any information as to the communist background of
Levison, O'Dell or Wachtel, Nichols responded that he had
not and that the information was developed by others.

At one point, when Seidel asked about alleged
harassment by the FBI, Nichols told him of FBI investigations
of chureh burnings in South Georgia and that the Bureau
recognized outstanding work by its Agents in this field
and that some of the Agents, including Nichols, had received
meritorious awards. Nichols indicated that he had been
commended for his work generally in civil rights investigations.

When asked avout what the FSI was doing in the King
case besides use of wiretaps, Nichols advised that he had
attended a conference at FBI Headquarters to explore avenues
of investigation that might be pursued in the King case.

The objective was to discuss ways of better determining the
extent of the commnist influences on King. Nichols furnished
the names of the ‘following FBI personnel as attending the
conference: Agents Henry Rouse and Nichols from Atlanta;

and from FBI Headquarters, Assistant Director William C.
Sullivan, and Agents Larry Gurley and Fred Baumgardner.
(Nichols advised that also attending the conference was

a Burean official, Jomeph Sixoo, but that he did not furniah
this name during his testimony as he did not then recall his
presence at the conference). Nichols told the S&C that he
could not remember what decisions were nade at the conference.

Nichols was questioned concerning a dispute between

King and former FBI Director Hoover which had been aired by
the news media. Wichole was asked if the dispute was the
reason for technical coverage of King and Nichols answered
that he was convinced that that was not the reason for the
technical coverage; that such coverage was otherwise fully
justified. Nichols pointed out that the investigation of

ng was initiated before the dispute although it was his
panos that the technical coverage started after the

Re: Testimony of Retired FBI
Special Agent (8A) Robert 8.
Nichols Before SSC Executive Session

Attempt was made by Seidel to question Nichols
concerning FBI investigation of the Student Nonviolent
Coordinating Committee but Michols refused to discuss the
rebte tt on the basis it was outside the parameters of the

imony.

Nichols was questioned concerning an alleged visit
of William C. Sullivan to Atlanta to see the newspaper
editor, Ralph McGill. This discussion was initiated in the
context of the allegation that the FBI furnished information
about King to the news media. Nichols responded that he did
net remember Sullivan ever coming to Atlanta.

Nichols was asked if he knew about the writing of
&@ monograph about King by an FBI Agent named Charles Brennan.
Nichola responded that he did not know of this.

Michols advised that he was offered the opportunity
to make a statement at the beginning of his testimony but
declined to do so. He was given the saue offer at the close
of his testimony aud he made a statement to the following
effect. Nichols believed that the Bureau had always
conducted the King investigation with the objective of
determining the extent of communist influences on King and
on the SCLC and that the only way to make a determination as
te the full extent required technical coverage. Nichols
pointed out that the Bureau never interfered in the legitimate
civil rights activities of individuals or organizations or

wuch people and that it was Nichols’ belief that FBI
personnel were doing what they were being paid for when they
conducted legitimate investigations revolving around
communism and communist influences in civil rights activities.
