I concur with the supervisor's assessment of Mr. Hidalgo
with Ga exception to the statement that Subject works well
under pressure. He is indeed an intense person and, under

“ great pressure, his involvement affects his performance; and even
more important, it has a very bad.effect on his health. With
this consideration noted, the undersigned thinks very highly of
‘Mr. Hidalgo and would be pleased to be associated with him again.

impatience is with administrative delays rather than with operational problems
which he understands fully and handles welk He has had problems with his
