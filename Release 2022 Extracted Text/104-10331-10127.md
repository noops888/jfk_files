MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief,’ Historical Review Group

FROM: Fredrick C. Wickham, Jr.
DO, Focal Point for ARRB

SUBJECT: DO Position on Identification of ERTHYROID/3

1. The DO strongly opposes the release by the ARRB of the
phrase “a good KUBARK asset” that was previously withheld in
Attachment. The CIA asked the Nicaraguan Service to send
ERTHYROID/3 to Mexico City to help in the interrogation of
Alvarado. .Because this was during the Samoza regime, we have
admitted that we had a liaison relationship with the Nicaraguans
and we also have released the cryptonym ERTHYROID. ERTHYROID/3
became. well known to the Mexicans as the Nicaraguan interrogator
and, of course, was known by his own service. The phrase “a good
KUBARK asset,” however, identifies him as a unilateral source of
the Managua Station unbeknownst to the Nicaraguan and Mexican
Services.

2. The DO often recruits officers, such_as ERTHYROID/3, who
are members of| with which it has
a liaison relationship. These assets provide us valuable
information without the knowledge of the service and in many
cases they provide information about the service itself and its
activities. .To reveal ERTHYROID/3’s identity and his special
relationship with the CIA would not only personally endanger
ERTHYROID/3 but could cast suspicion’on other recruited officers
of other liaison services and compel them to reevaluate their
unilateral relationships with the CI. ie
