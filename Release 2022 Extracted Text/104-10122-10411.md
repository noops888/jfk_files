MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Security Analysis Group

SUBJECT : Manuel L. DE ARMAS
SF#591 865

1. Reference is made to the attached cable traffic which
sets forth the "defection" of the Subject to Cuba circa April
1976, In substance, DE ARMAS apparently gave a press conference
in Havana on 21 April 1976 in which he claimed to be an ex-CIA
agent who had been recruited by a fnu BLACKENHOUSE (no Office
of Security traces) in 1969. DE ARMAS also claimed to have been
Stationed in New York City in 1971 where he maintained contact
with BLACKENHOUSE and Richard TOMLEY (probably identifiable i:
with Peter L. B. TOMLEY, Washington Area Recruiting Office). Pi

2. In the cited press conference, DE ARMAS made many
allegations concerning purported CIA operations, such as
assassination plots and a plan to rupture relations between
Venezuela and Cuba. Details of these allegations are set
forth in the attached cable traffic and are not treated in
instant memorandum. However, interest in DE ARMAS! allegations
concerning alleged CIA operations concerns the identities of
individuals that he claimed to have been Agency operatives and
assets; details regarding these individuals are covered in the
latter portion of instant memorandum.

3. Agency.interest in DE ARMAS was originally predicated
upon the receipt of a letter written by DE ARMAS on 12 September
1972 in which he related details concerning his anti-CASTRO
activities through his membership in a group called ABDALA.

The letter also contained a Tequest for employment with the
Agency, As a result of DE ARMAS! letter, WH Division requested
a Special Inquiry by the Office of Security for the purpose of
establishing DE ARMAS' identity, which was completed in October
1972, In May 1973 Office of Personnel opened a file on DE ARMAS
and apparently went through the normal routine of shopping his
file. Interest in DE ARMAS terminated when TOMLEY sent DE ARMAS
a letter advising him that the Agency had nothing currently
available. Then on 22 January 1973 DE ARMAS wrote TOMLEY
thanking the latter for interest following a telephone call

DE ARMAS made to TOMLEY in which DE ARMAS wanted to know once £

and forever if there were any openings for him.

DE ARMAS'

security file reflected no subsequent activity except for the
attached cable traffic following his "defection."

4. Regarding the personalities mentioned by DE ARMAS

vana press conference, it appears that several

s may be identical to former WH Division assets, as

shown below.” It should be noted that DE ARMAS did not identify ao
any bona fide Agency staff employees or agents nor does it

in his }
individu

ogi,

appear that he identified any past or current operations. It
seems likely that DE ARMAS was provided a list of known or
suspected Agency assets by the DGI as part of Cuba's- ongoing
anti-CIA, anti-U. S. Government campaign designed to offset

adverse criticism to Cuba's military assistance to Angola.

Set forth below are those individuals alleged to have been
connected with Agency operations by DE ARMAS; results.of Office
of Security indices searches and file reviews follow each name
where a possible identification could be made.

5S. The possible identification (by either DE ARMAS or the
DGI) of those ta Division assets reflected above suggests that
their names were either known or suspected as CIA assets and were
thrown in with those individuals not identified above in an
effort to legitimatize DE ARMAS' claims to have worked for the
CIA, It should be noted that of those individuals listed above
on whom a security file exists, none appear to have any current
association with this Agency and, as far as can be determined,

no actual Agency operations were either exposed or threatened.

6. The above is provided for your information; no further
action in this case appears necessary,
