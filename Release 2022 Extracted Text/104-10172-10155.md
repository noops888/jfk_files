‘ 1. Tho militia 4s no longer regarded by the Cuban Government as a sorious
faotor in internal or external defense. Instead, it ia used as a recruiting
ground for the Armed Forces, which are now thoroughly professional and

well-trained.

2, Armed clashes between opposition groups and goverment forces have coourred
dn several provinces, including Matanvas,.Camagusy, ani Pinar del Rio.

7 3. There has been a notable increase in sabotage since February or March 1962,
' Buildings and factories have been blown up or burned, cane folds set on 7
i fire, and above all, passive reistance has grown in certain industries,
especially the sugar refining industry. A different pattern of sabotage
has emerged. Instead of setting off explosive or incendiary bombs there
they might cause loss of life or injury, thus arousing popular resentment.
against the opposition, targets are chosen for the maximm financial damage

or dislocation.
