Memo on RIDDERSIRALE

Riddersträle was questioned on September 9th 1964 and

gavethe following information.

He has never visited countries outside Europe and the

statement attributed to him that during a period of seven

years he should have lived in Cuba 1s not true.

He believe.

that somebody who wanted to harm him had ascribed these

words to him.

Neither 1s it true that he has visited llaiti.

He admitted that on several occasions he has discussed

politics and in the course of these discussions he has

spoken of Swedish communism as well as of the Fidel Castro

government in Cuba, and he did not deny that he had sooken

of revolutions in Venezuela and Mexico supported by Castro.

He pointed out, however, that what he had said in this

respect was only what could be found in Swedish newspapers.

Somebody who had listened to him might have misunderstood

him.

When questioned whether he had used the expression: "I

tell you, Kennedy will probably be shot", he denied that.

He could not explain such an expression since he could not

remember having said anything like it. He knew nothing

whatever beforehand about the murder of the President.
