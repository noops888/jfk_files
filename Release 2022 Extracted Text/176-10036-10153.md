THE NATURE OF THE BUDDHIST CONFLICT IN SouTH VIETNAM

The current Buddhist protest moveméeat ia
Vietnam has been highly political since its i
tion, However, in ‘the context’ of Buddhist tr

regime, it ‘is impossible entirely to separaté Bu

| There is Strong evidence.
that the government, through
its authoritarian inclinations -
and its concern over Viet'Cong

-instigation or exploitation. of

the Buddhist issue, was disposed
from the beginning to regard the
Buddhist leadership as subversive

“and to deal-with it forcefully.

When it refrained. from doing. so,
under US pressure, while stall-

ing on concessions, the. Bud- i
dhists.were able to. arouse pub.

lic sympathy by organizing.

SEGRET

of’ the..issue a probepay. could, have



demonstrations and, ultimately,
by self-immolations which, what-
ever their political effects,
represent a sacrificial gesture
compatible with the traditions
of Vietnamese (Mahayana) Bud-
dhism, Although by early Au-
gust the fervor of the Buddhist

‘movement may have been partly

out of control, as claimed by
the Buddhist leaders, the lat-~
ter were already expanding their
demands in-late June; in mid-
July moderate Buddhist clergy
were expressing alarm over the
political aims of extremists in
‘the movement. There is-almost
“no question that Tri Quang and
others were actively organizing,

“whether from the outset or as

a‘result of frustrations en-

<eountered during the campaign,

. a*vehicle to bring about the

-government's overthrow, though

‘they do not appear to have co-
operated with Diem's traditional
political opponents,

The government has claimed
it has proof of Communist di-

srection of the Buddhist campaign,

but officials privately admit

there is little hard evidence
of this, other than Viet Cong
directives to exploit the ‘is-
sue,

Quang him-
self claims that, despite per-
sonal antipathy to Diem, he ini-
tially accepted the President
asa strong anti-Communist leader;
it. was only later that he con-
cluded that Diem could not win
the war and that the Buddhists
were caught between the evils
of the regime and of ‘the Viet
Cong. Quang, however, is’ polit-
ically sophisticated .and-some-
what devious in his approach,

A’ Vietnamese source, one who -
regards most Buddhist leaders

‘as sincerely motivated, has

expressed distrust of Quang.-
and his denials of Communist
sympathies, (SECRET)
