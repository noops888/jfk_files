“References ‘OIR: 77743515 sanuary i96s..

1; Attached ‘herewith Is’a sterilized copy of the Memorandum
of. Agreémant executed with LIMOUSINE on 3 february 1965. Three
pigin ad-and-dated copies are retained In Station files. Both
LIMOUSINE and his wife appeared and sighed the agreement, with
“Robert L. EAS8Y acting for. OOYOKE. ‘It will be noted that the final
-terms were somewhat more favorable than Headquarters had authorized.

2. Station had emple opportunity to study the plans’ and they
were so ideal: from. both ‘the ‘operational and living standpoint ‘that
_no changes were required. Bulging can therefore begin almost at
once; and ‘the forecast for completion Is‘sti!! about | July.

Consideration had-been given inthe Station to installing
i a smitters Inthe: two lower apartments In
“lew of their probable’ attract lveness to FJSTEAL personnel,
It Is -Station's:vlew. that given LIMOUSINE's close Involvement with
KUBARK on ‘a number of matters It would be well nelther to have. too
much FUSTEAL interest aroused in: the bullding nor to give them the
opportunity to observe the pattern of LIFEUD/6 at such close range.

4, With reference to paragraph. 5 of the memorandum, Station will
_ probably. decide. to. have LIFEUD/6-draw-up a-normal-contract with
LIMOUSINE and pay him his rent,:which will be. passed by LIMOUSINE to
Station. at regular Intervals. The question of how to route an
apparently normal ‘transactton around LIMOUSINE 's bookkeeper has not
yet been resolved. E He e

property to. LINOBINE

SUBJECT, Bele’ of: LOAITED-

‘Ta 1955 MUBARK puretiascd the LIMITED property (215 99. uetrée of land

“aind house) in México City for. $12,000 and then spent $3,500 for repqirs and
“renovations to scccemodate KUBARK operational’ requirements.

” Because “of its idesl location directly across the street from the
property which:vae for sale was purchseed so. KUBARK could
esteblish.control over this specific piece of property at that time. For
reasons of security, legal title for LIMITED wasvested in agent LIMOUSINE
vho-acted as thé cut-out vehicle. A statement of trust is on file at the
Btation in-which LIMOWINR acknovledges KUBARK's true ownership of the
property. LIMITED hae been uscd oporationally with outstanding euccess-and~
preeumbly without comprosise, and it is WA's intention to continue using

Ate

- It recently developed that part of the LIMITED house crumbled, and

ll the house ves found tobe in. oimilar state of disrepair. Repairs and
Limited remodelling, ‘however.costly, did ‘not seem to be econoaically

feasible, and in addition certain other operational and gecurity considerations
see to dictate the need fora new kind of structure--a higher building so
our angle of surveillance coiild be improved, and the addition of a commercial
interest on the ground level to provide a daily flow of people (euch as a

bank, retail store, ete.) Erection of a comercial bullding is within the
goning redtrictions of the district.

"The cost for nev onstruction of @ suitable building has been
estimated upvards of $55,000. Although-the property io located in a slowly
deterioratiag district, nonetheless the proposition is bankeble. With land
Ancluted (appraicad at: $14,500 to $25,000), a local bank io willing to loan
80f of the’ new construction cost of $55,000.

LDMOUSINE vould not venture into such’a construction progras on his
own decount at this tise. He voulj, -hovever, follow through vith it es an
accoumodetion to KUBARK if the. terms were cquivable.: Accordingly, he has
Indicated he will be‘villing to-put up 20f of the construction cust from his
ovn funds, ‘borrow the remaining 60$, and then offered to pay KUBARK
180,600 ‘pests or $14,448 (appraised value by bank) for the 215 sq metres of
land. ‘Nothing vould be paid for the old building, since little, if anything,
could be realised fro the sale of the old building and the cost of rezing it
would far exceed the:sale of the salvage materials.

heed -

‘Since mich of LIOWS1NE's cash funds vould be tied up in financing
the new construction, he effered-to effect: payment to KUBARK at the rate of
&,300 pesos or $364.00 per month over a 3} year period with the first payment
commencing 3 years after coapletion of coastruction or July 1905. LIMOUBINE
would execute a non-interest and unsecured note for the land. Be vould ensure
KUBARK tenancy reteation rights to rental of third floor spartment at the rate.
Of $2,300 pesos per month with KUBARK reserving theright.to cancel any time.
The ovartment vould be bullt to-KUBARK's reauireeenta. :
