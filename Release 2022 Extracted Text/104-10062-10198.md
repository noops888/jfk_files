Attached are two listings of the Mexico City

Station files in the possession of Winston Scott at

the time of his death.

Both listings are for the same

files; the 5 May 1977 listing was prepared for LA

Division, while the form 4034, dated 21 October 1977,

was prepared during a task force review of all the

files held at the Records Center.

One of the objectives

of the file review at the Records Center was better

organization of our retired files... Another was the

removal of all duplicate paper.

4. We do not have a record of any files in Mr. Scott's

safe that pertained to the Subjects in paragraph 11 of

reference.

We have reviewed the material described in

paragraph

three above and reproduced (attached) those

documents that pertain to the Subjects in paragraph 11

that might be of interest to the HSCA.
