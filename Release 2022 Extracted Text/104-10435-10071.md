. OCTOBER 1950

Early in October 1950, DIMITROV visited the Lavrion Camp where he met
, with a number of his Bulgarian friends and advised them that he had been
given a "charter and instructions", by certain members of [tidqY
[ to form a committee of five mémbers:for the planning and execu-
tion of a fight for the liberation of Bulgaria. This committee, according

to. DIMITROV, would be established in Athens and would cooperate with other

similar committees which have already been formed in France, Germany, and

other countries. The committee would later expand to 20 members and would
establish a so-called "Democratic Agrarian Bloc". Recruits would come from
among the members and sympathizers of the Bulgarian Democratic Party

(Moushynov) and from the Gichev Agrarians. Eligible Bulgarian emigres

would come to Greece from Western Europe. to assist in the work and pr
. . : . > o-



minent members of the Gichev Agrarians and of the Democratic Party would
be assisted in escaping to Greece (presumably from Bulgaria) to join the
organization. ;
DIMITROV listed the organization's tasks as follows:
a. Intelligence activity in Bulgaria.
b. Organization of an underground resistance
movement in Bulgaria, and
’ c. Organization of sabotage activity against
Bulgaria.
DIMITROV revealed that he was the president of the organization.

DIMIRTOV took frequent occasion to mention that the

committee had its headquarters in | where he has a
room assigned for his own use. He also stated that the commitee maintains

1 November 1950 .

DIMITROV again visited the Lavrion Camp to inform his recruitsthat they
would: short ly be moved to a pleasant hime in Athens which the Americans
‘were repainting for the purpose. On the occasion of this visit, the re-

* cruits were divided into three groups, as follows:
a. a groupd of 10 men to specialize in intelligence;
b. a group of 6 men to be trained in radio in Germany
c. a group of.15 men to specialize in sabotage.
The source of hhe information contained in the || 31992 described

DIMITROV as"an unprincipaled opportunist and Greek agent".

— (31992, 14.12.50



During this period of time, DIMITROV was the principal agent ~
in an ill-fated operation which resulted in a major expose and
trial in Sofia during 1951. The agents used were those selec-
ted by DIMITROV, at least one of whom was #676 probably an
operative of the Bulgarian Militia and acted as the betrayer

of his colleagues.

1. General DIMITROV called the undersigned on 30 March to
say hello and request.a meeting. We met for dinner .at the Astoria
Restaurant at 8 p.m., 31 March, :

2. During the course of the evening, Dico said he had seen ©
my boss. When I asked whom he meant, he replied, Dick Helms. He
said he had known Helms for years and further that he had seen
him that. Thursday in order to find out his position on the new
organization the General was in which was holding its first rally:
the next evening in New York. (This organization has something
to do with rabid anti-commmism and support for the U.S. in the
Vietnam war.) The General said Helms* position was one of go
ahead; he had no strong feelings supporting or condemning such
a group.

3. Dico made further loud comments about support for the
war. Our waitress overheard and mentioned that she was leaving
a the next morning for Saigon to entertain troops and to find out
! what the war was really about. Dico made a small scene about how
;. wonderful this was, etc.

‘' 4, The General is the most rabid anti-communist I Have ever .
met. For him there can be no compromise between them and the

. Free world; they must all be destroyed. After continuing on in
this vein for some time, he finally quit. Also, he stated at the
beginning of the even: that he did not drink and then proceeded
to have a combination of drinks fairly fast. He did not appear
drunk, but with each drink he got louder and louder. .The other
diners paid little attention, however, due to music and other
covering noises. —

The AB-PT operating earnings
for 1963 were $7,358,000 or $1.65 a
share compared to $10,757,000 or
$241 a i

Goldenson explained the paradox
of lower operating earnings when
the record income exceeded that of
1962 as reflecting 1962-1963 tele.
vision business and the cost of cov-
ering President Kennedy's assas-
sination. He anticipated progressive
improvement during 1964, better
than 1963.

He noted, too, an improvement in
theatre business despite a slow
start in 1963. AH-PT, he said, con-
tinued its policy of disposing mar-
ginal theatres and attempting to
replace them with modern units in
growing suburban areas, The com-
pany, he revealed, dropped 14 thea-
tres during 1963-and opened three
new ones. Theatres are under eon-
struetion in Charlotte, N.C. and

On October 28, 1944, he allegedly was accused by the govern-
ment of sabotage because he had agitated against the Russian
zi occupation troops.’ During the ensuing months he.was arrested
i several times in Ferdinand, Vratsa.and Lom. .When released from
prison, he continued his iitegal activities, which seem to have
cee consisted in travelling from village to village, organizing
Ze loose-knit groups of Agrarians to withstand Communist pressures.

“‘ConztpEWETAL. '

Diko's organizational activities often lead him across the
Yugoslav frontier. Allegedly he worked in Vardar Macedonia in
order to organize Bulgarian sympathizers for the cause of Dr.
G. M. Dimitrov, and upon the advice of a certain General -
Kitchharov.

In April and May 1945, Diko was in Sofia, in contact)with
Dr. G. M. Dimitrov, Nikola Petkov and Mara Raicheva. After Diko
learned that GeMe had left Bulgaria, he went to Skoplje and’
asked American and. English officers there to help him get to.
Bari. He did not raesive such help.

Upon the suggestion of "Gosho, the leader of the partisans
of Greek Macedonia," Diko was sent baek to Wlgaria.. He escaped
during this transfer‘and, although he was ill, he went to Sofia
where, he says, ‘he was helped by a number of people, including
Peter ‘Belgashki , an American Colonel named "Bekeles,” an". -
American Sergeant. named "Bucky," General Craig and Mrs. Minnie
Balabanova.

When he had recovered his health, Diko left Sofia and

twelve days without water, and to have spent four days on an. 1
electric torture machine which caused temporary blindness.
(His "indescribable tortures" are all described in detail “in his
book "The Liberation of Bulgaria." See enclosure No. 1.) \ Dike
believes that he was not executed because the Communists wished
to hold him as a witness in preparation for the trial of Nikola.

From, October 13 to November 11, 1946,Diko was tried in
the Vratsa court for "having organized subversive groups: all
f over Bulgaria.” The chief prosecutor was a man named Chernev,
the presiding judge was a certain Pencho Spasov. Diko was
sentenced on four counts: to death, to 15 years, to 6 years and
% to 3 years imprisonment. He was jailea and put in solitary
confinement.

On June 2, 1947, he was tried and sentenced to death by
the Sofia Military Court. Also, ke states, he was tried and
sentenced to death by the court at Lom.

In June, 1947, Diko was taken to a quarry in Vratsa where
he worked loading rock. On July & he escaped from the quarry
and went to Mesdra. In Mesdra he contacted the post which he
had established there, and received help in travelling further.
He went to Zvereva and then to Sofia. While in Sofia he asked .
for and received:some help both from the British and from the
Americans, He claims that on one occasion he sl in the Sofia
house of Jack Horner, of the American Legation. At this time
Mr. Horner was living in his summer home at Simeonovo.) . Dike
claims also tq. have stayed with Michael Shipkov.

On July 23, 1947 he crossed the Greek frontier south of
Zlatograd. He gave himself up the next day at Shahin.

British authorities in Sofia had notified the British in
Salonika, aod they made arrangements for Dike to be admitted
to the British hospital in Xanthi. After eighteen days in
the hospital there he was transferred to the British hespital
in Salonika. After a month and a half in Salonika he was sent
to Athens. Greek authorities sent him to the refugee c: at:
Lavrion. Dike spent nine months in Lavria, then went to Athens,
where he obtained employment broadcasting in Bulgarian om Radio
Athens. His subsequent activities in Greece are discussed in
section 2, below.

Dike speaks Bulgarian, Serbian, Russian, some Greek, and
a very little English.

every Sunday even: m Bulgarian.. He receives 30,000 drachmae
per broadcast. (60,000 if his text is also used in’a Greek

tion costs, give him a net return from this work of about. sero
drachmae.. In. addition to his money pay, however, theGreek
. Government. provides him with quarters in a run-down hotel in
New Phaleron and it pays him 2800 drachmae per day subsistence.
, (Generally, a refugee is not entitled to subsistence money if
v he has any. employment whatosever.)

Dike also writes articles for various Athens newspapers
(see enclosure No. 6) and has received money for them. Other
literary activities are described. in section 2..b., below.

A-Mr. Humphries, technical adviser of the BBC at Radio
Athens, allegedly has offered Diko a job with BBC in London.
Dike has refused to accept this offer to date,. because of his
primary interest in organising refugees into a "Democratic. -
Bloc." Should he find it impossible to acquire: funds mecessary
for his continued activities in Greece, however, he plans to

go to London with BBC.

b. Publications. Diko is a prolific author and is at
present writing an eight part work on Bulgaria to be entitled
"Under the Whip of Stalin." The eight parts of the book are:

1) The Liberation of Bulgaria
2) .In the Hands of the Militia
3) :dustice and Communisa

4). Prisons and Camps

5) Agrarians and Communism.

6) Workers and Communism

3 Army and Communism

(8)° Church and Communism

Dike has already written parts 1, 5 and 7..-Parts 1 and. 5.
have been published in Greece. They are. enclosures No.3 and
No, 2 to this despatch. Part 7 (enclosure No. 3) is being pub-
lished by the Greek General Staff and is-at the printers at the
present time, Diko received about 3,000,000 drachmae for each
part of his book which has been published; he expects to earn
about the same amount for Part 7, and for subsequent parts.

Dike states that he has written the books which have been
published "for the Greek audience.” He realizes that they will
not meet approval in the West, largely because they are too
emotional. Also, he has omitted from the Greek versions of

Diko refers to himself often as "the new Kravchenke = better

Johnston, former Press Attache at the United States Legation in
Sofia, to read the Greek text of Diko’s books and check on this
boast. (Diko’s books are available only in Greek at the present
time.) Mrs. Johnston stated that "Diko is certainly no worse
than Kravehenko."....Mrs. Johnston believes that Diko is an inte-
resting. and graphi¢e author and that -- if he could abstain from

frequent use of Balkan epithets -- his work might merit publica-: Ke

Dike claims that he has twelve "hard core". members in his

will have ninety supporters as soon as he can find the funds te

proofs of his growing strength.

Diko appears to. be an excellent organizer, He keeps
up-to-date lists of all the Bulgarians in the camp at Lavrion. -
The Bulgarians are listed. according to Diko's estimate of their
political position, Thus there is a group called Supperters.
there is one called Potential Supporters, there is a group of
“hard core" Gemetoists, a list of Nationalists, etc. Diko .
also files all of his ideas and correspondence and, in general,
seems to have a good idea of what he has done and is doing.

Diko makes it a point. to visit the camp at Lavrion regu=-

tributes among new arrivals, Allegedly, he tells these new
arrivals that the presents are given to them because they are
Bulgarians, not as a bribe to join-his political group. “In

The basic program of Diko’s Demoeratic Bloc is te be found
in the "Constitution of the Bulgarian National Agrarian Union,”
as published.in Sofia in 1922. Diko carries an old and dog=
eared copy of this publication with him. Presumably a copy is
available in Washington.

In addition to these basic tenets, Diko’s group has evolved
a supplementary program. The points of this supplementary pro=
gram are listed on enclosure No. & In general, Diko’s program ap-
pears democratic and idealiatic.

Diko's group is opposed unalterably to the Bulgarian National
Committee and to Dr. G. M. Dimitrov. Diko states that, although
he worked with Dr. Dimitrov for many years, he has come to realise
that Dr. Dimitrov.ia guilty of those same totalitarian and ter-
rorist leftist practices of which the Communists are guilty.

Diko states that the final break with Dr. Dimitrov came over the
following. incident: 7

~-Dr..G.M.' Dimitrov knew that Diko had orga-
nized many. secret posts throughout’ Bulgaria
and, after Diko escaped from Bulgaria, Dr.
Dimitrov asked Diko to name the posts. :
Diko thought it wise not to write down-the -
names of the. persons in charge of the posts,
and was also suspicious of this request.
When Dr. Dimitrov did not receive the infor-
mation he wanted, he became wery angry and
"showed his true totalitarian hand.”

(Dike -has made available to the Peripheral Reporting Unit
many of his files, including those on his correspondence with
Dr. Dimitrov. It appears that he does know GeMe and that GeMe
at one time thought well of Diko. --For-instance,~in-a letter
dated October 31,-1947, Dr. Dimitrov spoke of Diko as a “hero” -
and in a letter dated January 2, 1948, Dr. Dimitrov stated
that he had Sqpdiro some cloth: and shaving equipment.)

anything, yet creating the. impression that he is all-knowing.

‘AS an example of Diko's awareness of the politician's
role, it might be mentioned that he now wears a well cut-suit
of the finest materials, a pair of excellent. imported shoes,-
a silk shirt and a. silk tie. Diko is buying these on credit,
at 150,000 drachmae ($10) por month. He claims that a good
appearance is necessary if he is to inspire the confidence and ~~
cooperation of the refugees among whom he is working.

Diko is a rugged‘ individualist and it would seem that his
individualism is his greatest: enemy at. present. He is intole-
rant and suspicious.of others, and is the type of person who
would prefer to lead his om small group to suicide than to
follow asa private in a larger army whose aims were not exactly '
his own.

There isa very great deal of the charlatan about Diko.
CAS spoke with him on ‘two occasions, and then discarded him: as
a "phony." The Peripheral Reporting Unit believes, however, .
that, notwithstanding his superficiality and the exaggerations ~
to which he is. prone, Diko has such an intuitive grasp of the
rudiments of political deportment and showmanship, and he is
80 devoted to his self-appointed task of organising hia "Demo=. ~

"INCIDENT IN VULCHEDRAM"
Excerpt from Agrarians and Communism, by Dimiter Adamov Dimitrov

So one day Yamkov ...(was)... told to go to the "Committee."
The invitation was made personally by Tinko so that it would
not have the meaning and character of an order. (He was the
apes i a Communist who probably had an important post in the
capital. : ?

"We have missed you, Yamkov, we see nothing of you.”
"Oh, well, business you know."

"Why don’t you come to the office of the People’s Committee
so that we can sit and have a talk?”

"To the office? What would I be doing there?”
"Oh, ‘having a talk.”
"What do we have to talk about?"

"Well, as men and as fellow villagers we have muck to.
talk about.”

. Fellow villagers? Yamkov felt his blood boiling and
rising to his head. That expression "fellow villagers" struck
his’ ears-as an irony, as an insult. He felt_he was-being de~
filed by the mouth of that sordid murderer; because it waa
against these fellow villagers that’ his. mania and extremism
had been directed and his fellow villagers had been killed on
his instructions; killed by the rabid mob of the Party during
its first onslaught... And among these fellow villagers whom .-
this jackal had killed there were his friends: the kind priest,
the teacher and the doctor, all those who were the heart and
mind of the village.

"Like fellow villagers?”

"Anyway, like friends. ... I want to discuss something ©
with you. It's necessary that I should have a talk with you.”

"Now I understand. That's right, be blunt about it. At :
what time do you order me to be in your office?®

~ "But don't take it that way, Yamkov. I am not ordering
you, I’m inviting you.”

"Okay, when do you want me to come?”
"Come this afternoon, unless you'd prefer tomorrow."

"Either today or tomorrow makes no difference to me.
I'm coming this afternoon.”

Before going there, Yamkov passed by the druggist’s
the only survivor of the circle of intellectuals, and tola him
about the invitation Tinko had made to him. He was the only
man with whom he ‘spoke with confidence and with whom he ex=-
changed ideas... The druggist rose, shocked, from his desk,
affixed his spectacles with hands which were trembling, then
put his hands on Yamkov’s shoulders as if they were expressing
his love and anxiety.

"Be careful, my friend Yamkev. You are a bit hotheaded
and cannot control your tongue. Mind you don't misbehave.
Control your nerves, because we mustn't lese you. We need you,
we need you. Your home and your family and your village need
you. You must not be missing when the moment arises...."

Yamkov left, ‘greatly moved, and with a decision to listen
to whatever they had to tell him at the People’s Committee
without ressing the. disgust and indignation he felt for-
them. He had decided te be patient, to swallow his tongue, °
and to listen. quietly to all the filth of that social disgrace,
Tinko, like a little pupil of the elementary school who is
chastised by his master.

"The devil take him?" he-spat-with disgust.

At the People’s Commnittes, apart from the two “eminent”
Party members ~ Tinko and Yanevy = there was a Russian organi-
zer, a large brute with an elephant neck and with a well-
shaved Asiatic head. Through his large nostrils, whick
rhythmically closed and opened with his breathing, one felt
that one was about to see the size of his mind. it seemed
that he knew who Yamkev was, because his grey eyes were econ-
stantly fixed on him, insistently and inquiringly. - Tinke
introduced him.

"He has a son.too, a Party man, our man."
"Bravo, congratulations. Where is he now?" he asked.

"In .o» (he felt like saying, Hell) ... Sofia,” he
corrected himself. :

"Is he studying?"

"Yes,he is studying to become a doctor.” (He thought to
himself: "a loafer.")

"Fine," remarked the Russian with satisfaction. "In our
set-up we respect doctors, just as we respect every scientist.
We think highly of them. We give them the means to promote
their science for the. benefit of the whole and, of course, for
their own benefit too.”

"Yes, yes.. You love them. I have seen. that with my own
eyes," agreed: Yamkov, scarcely managing to control himself.
And there passed before his eyes the tragic scene of the assas-
sination of the doctor a few days ago.

After these words had been exchanged and he was sitting.
comfortably on. his.chair, the Russian opened his legs wide,
assumed a serious air, and started the discussion. He spoke
Bulgarian with great ease, like a Bulgarian. . " .

"The comrades," he said, pointing to. Tinko-and Yanev,
"spoke to me with flattering words about you and your home.
You are an honest and industrious family, respectable persons,
and.such persons who know how to appreciate work and honesty
are valuable and dear.tous. It,is even more fortunate :
because, as: I was told, you are on our side. This is only
too natural, of course, since you have your son....” ~

"My son. has his own ideas and I have mine," interrupted
Yamkov, who had started growing. angry.

The Russian pretended not to notice the meaning of the
interruption. ~

"Yes, I understand. Your son, being younger and more
progressive, went further ahead. Youth has the lead, So

i was about to say...what was I saying? Oh yes, that you
have a son who could go ahead if you, too, helped, and if
you oan it would be the other way. You understand what I
mean’ a

Yamkov felt that he was choking with anger, but. he con-
trolled himself. He swallowed his tongue. .

"I understand,” he said, between clenched teeth.
"It's good to hear that,” added the Russian. "It shows

that you understand things in the right way, from the proper
angle, like a reasonable man and like a fathe al He: looked

satisfied. He thought that he had scared Yamkov with his
threatening insinuation. He thought that he had him now at
his mercy.

"And now-let us speak about the specific and interesting
question for which we invited you."

"Let us speak," the other man agreed.

"People ‘like you are valuable for us... You are exactly
what is required in each village to serve as. an example to
be followed by others, to overcome the stupid hostility of
the villagers toward our social system and thus to facilitate
its completion....Such persons offer an immense service. to
our causé.:. That is why we give them our respect and our
confidence, and we reward them richly, both morally and mate-
rially. We know how to honor honest men.”

"Yes, indeed. .I can see that," said Yankor and threw a
glance at. the: other two "honest men,” Yanev and Tinke.

Yamkov’s ‘highly expressive hint did not escape the at- ~
tention of the Russian, but he pretended not to understand.
The two "honest. men" went red to the roots of their ears. and
their eyes sparked with anger.

"After all this,” the Russian went on, "the only thing
that remains is. for me to tell you about ay proposal. You
should enter the kolkhos. There you will be able to develop
all your activity, you will benefit the social whole and you
will create the fundamental pre-requisites for the proper
development and progress of your son.”

Yamkoy rose. From the first words the’ Russian organiser—
had uttered he understood what he was about to come to. And,
of course, he did not intend to accept the proposal for
participation in the kolkhos. but had intended - following the
advice of his friend, the druggist = to express his refusal
in quiet and well chosen words. But when the Russian had
made his son's progress dependent upon his own onsent to be-
come an organ of the party - thus indirectly blackmailing
him -, and especially whem he clearly intimated that he wanted _
him to use as the bait for his fellow villagers, his honest
and pure soul revolted. The wave of anger Nida he-searcely
managed to control broke out like qa torrent. The druggist's
prescription waa cast away, forgotten.

"It seems to ne,” he replied, "that your affinity Lives
base individuals like Tinko and Yanev, and undoubte:
others still worse, has led you to believe that, all.

Bulgarians are tailored to fit your plans. For otherwise.
you would not have spoken to me about moral and material
rewards for my person, about coins of treachery, and you.
wouldn't have threatened me with the ‘development’ of my
good-forsnothing son. Oh no, Mr. Russian, you are wrong
in thinking that all the Bulgarians take after your
‘comrades', There are a few who cannot be bought, who do
not give way to threats and do not become bait.”

He put on his hat and left with dignity.

The others: remained there, stupified and spellbound,
looked at. the departing Yamkov. ~

When he had overcome the surprise which had stupified
him, Tinko got hold of his revolver and hastened to reach
Yancho Yamkov, who was descending the stairs without being.
aware of this. But the Russian organiser stopped him.

"Wo nonsénsé;. ‘This isn’t the time for it.” We shall
think over how and when and where it must be done.”

And he ‘did think about it. A few days later Yamkov was.
found dead in a field outside the village. He had been.:. .
stabbed with wild ferocity.

Tinko and the militia made every effort to find the mur-
derers. - And they found them. They were two peasants, two
stolid and incorrigible anti-Communists, who, according to .
their own ‘confession’, written and signed before the militia,
had committed the murder because they were informed that -
Yamkov had registered for participation in the kolkhos and
because he insistently and persistently had urged his fellow
villagers. to join him. The two-murderers were taken..away
for trial.and never reappeared. .

Yamkov’s belongings, in accordance with a statement. which
he had "signed," were taken over by the kolkhoz.

PROGRAM OF THE DEMOCRATIC BLOC

1. The program is based upon the policies of the great.
Agrarians such as Nikola Petkov, Dimiter Guitchev, Nikola
Mushanov, Constantin Moraviev, Yorgi Dimov, Alexander
Gerginov and Alexander Stambouliski\ -

2...The Blee accepts the help and collaboration of all
Bulgarian anti-Communists who agree to work along the Lens
of Democracy.

3. The-Bloe refuses to collaborate with Communists, 4
Leftist elements of any type such as the party of Dr. G. Ms
Dinitrov, extreme Rightists, former Monarchists, Fascists,
or with the: Ivan Mihailew group. This Democratic Bloc must
remain purely democratic, in the American manner.

4. The Bloc will ally itself with similar bloes now
being formed among Albanian and Yugoslav refugees.

5. As soon-as the Bloc can procure the necessary funds,
it will prepare and publish protocols, resolutions, etc.,
and distribute these both to Bulgarian emigrants abroad and
to Bulgarians inside Bulgaria, The first of these brochures
will explain what the Bloc is, what it wants and why it does
not support Dr.°G. M..Dimitroy. The brochure will ask for
the help of all Democratic Bulgarians. i

6. "After the Bloc has proved itself", it will:
help from the United States and from the Greek Government in
penetrating and propagandising Bulgaria.

7. The Blec expects to help annoy the Communists in
Bulgaria and -- when the time comes - to help liberate the
country.

8. When the country has been freed, the Bloc desires
free elections under a democratic system, restoration of all
personal freedoms, the adoption of a bill of rights along the
American system, the restoration of private omership, the
abolition of cooperative farms and the abolition of the
people’s courts.

9. The program advoeates just and proper trials of all
Communist leaders =- no terrorism. E

10. In external affairs the Bloc advocates Balkan eoope-
ration and cooperation with all democratic peoples. .

MEMORANDUM 18 April 1951

To: _ Oliver G. Martell
Fran: Terence U. Nasmith

Subject: The Hanging of Lyle 0. Kelly.

1. . The most serious accusation against Kelly is based upon
the’ developments w regard to Kelly's conection with the French.
He told us about. recent contacts he made with Pierre and Mrs.
Florimond from Salonika. He denied that he had ever had con~
tacts with them previously. We have learned from Ogive that,
inl » Kelly worked for Florimond.

On Thursday April 12 Kelly stated that ne was to tell
Florimond. by. Friday, April 13, whether or not he would work with
him, . Kelly.asked.us for instructions. We told Kelly his answer
was to be 4.definite, final no. In other words he was never to
Pos see the French again... We know definitely, however, that Kelly
Rew -Saw Florimond on'Friday, on Saturday and on Tuesday. | On Tuesday
he. saw also a.certain French Assistant. Military Attache named Piray. ...

Yani ‘Kolomonos, Kelly's friend, stated that Kelly has 7
agreed to meet Piray at the French Embassy between 1] and 12 o'clock
on Thursday, April 19. At this meeting Kelly will (1) give the .
Frenchman detailed accounts of all U. S. imtebbigence operations of.
which he is aware, with special maraeice on Radio Gorianin, and (2)
receive for this information 10 to 15 million drachmae.

It is.imperative that this meeting be stopped. For
instance, two of the Dreamer radio announcers are known to Kelly ae
and hated by Kelly. Since they have relatives inside Dreamland. their :
our position should be as secure as possible.

Our. Greek informant suggests, not without plausibility,
that this effort of the Erench might be Communist-inspired att empt'-
to penetrate U.S. intelligence activities. The Greek bases his 3
guess only upon the reasoning that normal French intelligence ieneenes
would not be so interested in penetrating U. S. work, since -~ ee
allegedly -~- we are close allies.

2. We accuse Kelly also of manyyproven lies and of theft of
funds. These malpractices, known to us. through personal observation °
over a period of several months, include such things as the following

a. Kelly stated that he wrote three books, for which he
was paid a sum of money. He did not write the books as he

b.. On one occasion Nasmith personally gave Kelly $300

in dollars for an option on his books. Kelly signed a
receipt for this. Kelly showed a signed copy of the receipt
to the true author, stating that he could not divide the
money with the author since, although he had signed the
receipt, - he had not received any money ~~ that Mr. Nasmith
had forced him to sign the receipt so that. Nasmith could
steal the $300 for himself.

c.. Money given to Kelly specifically for the purpose of
paying salaries to the members of his Committee was not
turned over to the Committee in its entirity. Kelly stated on
several occasions definitely that he no longer had any
connections with Greek authorities. At the time he was making
these statements he was observed by our people to be going into
the Aliens Directorate, Radio Athens, and other official. Greek
residences... (Note: We wereppteasddtto have Kelly maintain
sontact with Greek officials; we.dislike only his lying about
te

d. On at. least 4 occasions Kelly has stated. unequivocally
i 5 thet he had no relations with Ibrahim Mohammed... A friendly
Fr observer saw Kelly pay Mohammed gold pounds prior to Mohammed's
: retent trip to Turkey. Furthermore, mysterious receipts have
: appeared in Kelly's accounts signed by Ibrahim Mohammed.

It is interesting to note that aroused by our continued
interest in Ibrahim, Kelly has given-us a long song and dance ~~
intending to force us to drop the subject -- about. Ibrahim's
being a Greek spy.

e.- On one occasion Kelly told us about having received
money from Major Nikoloupolos of the Aliens Directorate. . This
is (1) an obvious attempt to drive a wedge between our closely
cooperating organizations, and (2) evidence of Kelly's untrust~
worthiness.

f. Kelly has been warned vepeatedly to maintain as good
security as possible regarding the purpose for which he has
rented offices at 13 Patissia Street... Nevertheless, Kelly has. :
blabbed his business (and ours!) all over Athens, s0 that. he isve-~
constantly visited by all manner of unnecessary people including
a galaxy of street-walkers. :

g- Welly maintains constant relations with several people-
who seem unduly interested in our work. We do not attempt
to dictate his friends but we do consider it improper when he
deliberately lies in denying to us that. he sees such people.
(Example: A certain Papas, an elderly Greek who seems. to be
working with the French Mission here.

3. In addition to the serious charges which we have against
Kelly as indicated above, there is the additional charge equally

serious but less.



-“3-

serious but. less‘specific, that he appears: actually to be-insane,
to be suffering from d@2lusions. of grandeur (mefiomania). For
instance, his many references to his future rol$ as prime minister
of Bulgaria, and. his illustrative: anecdotes regarding the purpose
of the. meeting recently. held between the members of the Committee
and Mr. Manfield.

4. (It. is recommended urgently that Kelly be removed immediately
from circulation and that the Aliens Directorate be kind enough to.
discuss with us in the next few days or weeks what. final solution
we may evolve for the Kelly menace. wis G .

Office Memorandum" * UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT
To + Acting Chief, SE DATE: 21 July 1953
FROM | SE/2
supyEcT: Lyle 0, KELLY 7

1. In accordance with your instructions received through Mr. Donald Fe
Ewing, CSE/2, and in coordination with Mr. Mahoney of WH Division, I flew to
DTROBALO, arriving there at noon on 26 May 1953, for the purpose of determining
whether Subject has. current operational information concerning SE operations
and personnel that.would make hima security risk if he were allowed to re~
settle within the next calendar year,

2. Upon arrival at DTROBALO I discussed the case with KELLY's case.
officer, Mr. Philip A, Tocmey, and the Station Security Officer and learned
that KELLY had been in detention until approximately 15 May when he was: released
from ccnfinement and allowed to attend.classes and live with other persons who.
are being prepared’ for resettlement.

3e Between 1300 and 1400 hours on 26 May, I reviewed the DIBOBALO Station
files on KELLY and made an appointment with KELLY's case officer to have a con=
ference with KELLY at 0800 hours 27 May. It was decided to use the office of as
the Station Security Officer for the meeting because of its invdherability to
other agents and to the laborers who were working in the area, ‘The Security
Officer stated that the office would be made available for the time specifieds

4e At 0800 hours 27 May KELLY's case officer escorted me to the pre=
arranged site and introduced me as Mike Vargas to KELLY who had been:
waiting in the office. The case officer informed KELLY that I had arrived from
Washington, D. C, to discusa his problems with him and would endeavor to resolve
all matters possible, KELLY appeared elated and in broken English said that. he
was very happy to learn that the organization (I presume he meant CIA) finally
acknowledges him as a friend, KELLY stated that he has been waiting 25 months
to speak to someone from Washington. ‘The case officer departed from-the room and
left KELLY and me standing in the center of the roum, I asked KELLY to be
seated and told him that I speak Serbo-Croatian and inquired if he understood
Serbo-Croatian, KELLY replied that he does spaak Serbian and is glad that I
speak the language also because his Englist was not fluent and he haa difficulty
expressing himself, All conversations hereafter were conducted in Serbo-~Croatiane

5. I opened the conversation by telling KELLY that his reports and letters
were received and studied very carefully at Washihgton and assured him that ;
pressing daties made it impossible for anyone to visit him at any tine prior to
the present. KELLY replied that he felt relieved that he was not forgotten by Ve
his friends and that he could now reveal everything that has been a puzzle to.

for certain actions that were directed against hin, KELLY stated that he was
imprisoned a few times and that he suffered terribly during those. periods
because of his inability to withstand imprisonment.

6 In order that I might have a clear picture of his background and
initial contacts with the Americans in Sofia and later in Athens, as well as
his associations with other intelligence services in Bulgaria and Greece, KELLY
stated that he preferred to start from the beginning of his clandestine work in
Bulgaria and. chronologically bring me up to date on his activities and ensuing
events, “Since mich of KELLY's discussion is repeated in a report he had pre=
viously prepared.and which is in his files and since a great deal of the dis
cussion had no direct bearing on the purpose of the mission, I will for the sake
of brevity and clarity avoid those portions of his storys

7» According to KELLY, the highlights of his background and activities

are as follows: When the Communist regime gained control in Bulgaria he realized
the poaition the people of Bulgaria were placed in and that under Commnisa

the people were not going to be any better off than they were under the Fascists
or Nazis, ‘The only salvation for the Bulgarian people was for the Democratic
powers to achieve control and thereby extend their form of government. to the
Balgarian people... He'therefore proceeded to exploit Bulgaria with a view to
organizing adherente into clandestine groups in order toorerthrow the

government that was in control. KELLY stated that he had organised over 250
cells consisting of seme 10,000 persons throughout Bulgaria and Macedonia,

8.. According to KELLY,in 1945 he met the American General Crane in Sofia
and the General requested KELLY to prepare a program of his organization out-
Lining ite mission, functions, etce. Upon complying with this request KELLY
stated that General Crane informed him that his program was very favorable and
that he (General Crane) desired KELLY to work for him, KELLY said he agreed
and proceeded personally to exploit the cells of his organization in Bulgaria.

Je “In 1946 while KELLY was inspecting units of his organization in Bulgaria
he was arrested by the Commmists and tried and found guilty on four counts and
imprisoned, Acoording to KELLY the only reason he was not given the death
sentence was because the. Coummnists had hoped to use him as a witness against
Nikola Petkov, Agrarian leader in Bulgaria who was also fomenting unrest among
the Agrarian factions. KELLY contimed by stating that he remained in prison
for approximately six months near Vratea where he was tortured by the police in
an effort to extract from him information on his organization.and people with
whoa he was associated, particularly Americans. KELLY said he did not reveal
the information which the police desired,

10..Early in 1947 through members of his organization he was. able to make
his escape from the prison, He made his way to Sofia where he tried to contact
General Crane, but learned that General Crane was no longer in Sofia and that
his replacement was a Mr, Horne (probably John Horner, Chapge d'Affaire A.I.
of the Political Mission in Sofia), Through the Mission secretary, KELLY made
an appointment to see Mr. Horne and when he did meet him Mr. Horne told him

that he was not

ae

that he was not aware of anything that had existed between KELLY and General
Grane, but for KELLY to telephone him several days later, KELLY stated that he
telephoned Mr. Horne a week later but received no satisfactory response fran
hime

11. KELLY realizing that he was wanted in Bulgaria by the police for his
escape from prison proceeded to work his way out of Bulgaria, He was assisted
by one Fancha Fernandova near Plovdiv. On crossing the Bulgarian border into
Greece KELLY stated that he surrendered to a Greek patrol who imediately
channeled him through its interrogation center, During this process KELLY. said
he was approached by British Intelligence, a Mr. Andros (possibly Andrews) and
Mr, Scott, and was told that the British had heard of his organization and
wanted him to work for them, KELLY refused the offer and told the British that
he preferred to work with the Americans, KELLY also said that the Greek IS
had asked him to work for them, and that he refused them also, He was then
placed in a refugee camp in Athens with other Bulgarian refugees. -

12, In 1949 during KELLY's stay in the refugee camp he said that he learned
the art of making trinkets as a trade and was allowed to leave the refugee camp
and seck employment inva shop where he could contime his trade. He found a
shop that offered him a job and he accepted. He stated that he had no intentions
of making a liviihood in that occupation but it did give him an opportunity to
get out of the refugee camp and contime to seek means to combat the Commnists
in Bulgaria. While on this job KELLY met a Greek woman by the name of Flora
Vavanou who said she had an aunt who lives in Chicago, Illinois, Since they both
wished to go to the United States, they decided to get married and, with an
affidavit of support fron Flora's Aunt, get visas to the U. 8... Their next
move was to. get to Italy through IRO channels. és

13 KELLY claims that he did not know the Aunt's address or name other
than that she was referred to as Teresa, KELLY said that he and Flora planned
to separate on reaching the United States, According to KELLY, he checked with
the TRO in Athens and learned that because he was a Bulgarian immigrant he was
eligible for emigration through IRO and since Flora had probable means of getting
him to the United States he decided to go through with the plan. ‘He married
Flora in February 1949 and by the latter part of March they were en route to

Ttalye

«Uke While in Italy KELLY stated that Flora commnicated with her Aunt in
Chicago who was preparing to process the necessary affidavit for their entry
into the United States, However, during this period KELLY learned that Flora
was pregnant and according to Italian Immigration officials she could not be
considered for emigration from Italy until after the birth of her child, On
learning this, KELLY said his whole plan had collapsed ani. that he could not go
through with it. He decided toreturn to Athens and leave his wife with her
parents, They returned to Athens in October 1949. A daughter was born in
November 1949 : :

15. Now that he

15. Now that he had returned to Athens KELLY's intentions were to earn
sufficient funds ($2000) to build a hane for his daughter, He was not con
cerned with Flora as he had married her for the purpose of getting to the
United States. ‘he marriage was to be a temporary affair as they were not in
love with each other and had no intentions of remaining married. Our information
shows that KELLY worked for the Propaganda Section of the Greek General Staff
headed by Lt. Colonel M. A, Alexandrakis on his return to Athens. In order to
earn money KELLY decided to write several books on anti-Commnism, Since he
was not fluent, in Greek be sought the assistance of a Greek scholar who could
translate his writings from Bulgarian into Greek. KELLY said he wrote two
texts and turned them over to a Greek educator to translates

16. In August 1950 KELLY decided to take his texts to the American Enbassy
in Athens and inquire as to the possibility of having the texts translated into
Englich and published in the United States, He said he was directed to a Mra
Bwning (probably Mr. Donald F, Ewing), Chief of Information Service, who in turn
Antwoduced him to a Mr. Willard Allan also an official at the American Enbasoy
in Athena, KELLY stated that after several meetings with Mr. Allan he was asked
by Mr. Allan to work with the Americans, . KELLY immediately voluntesred and was
told’ in order to get an organization that could accomplish its mission he would
need several assistants. He explored the Layrion refugee camp for potential staff
personnel and was given the names of Ivan Hristonov and Ivan and Dimitur Doneve
Upon the suggestion of the Americans, KELLY said he accepted the persons nameds
He established a headquarters and proceeded planning operations to penetrate
Bulgaria, KELLY claimed the Greeks and certain Bulgarian emigre leaders in
Greece were opposed to his position with the Americans and did dverything
possible to belittle his. position and impair his operations, ‘The results of
KELLY's abortive missions into Bulgaria are contained in a report which KELLY
prepared at DIROBALO and which is now in his file.

17. ‘During the period in which he was trying to get his operations
mounted into Bulgaria, KELLY was approached by the French IS to work for thems
KELLY stated that he inmediately informed his American superiors regarding the
French approach and was thereafter directed by the Americans in his dealings
and associations with the French IS.

18, KELLY listed the following American personnel with whom he coordinated
all his activities : The Chief, name unknown to KELLY —probably Mr. MacLéan,
Mr, Willard Allan, Miss Vera (ur. Allan's secretary), Mrs. Kingsley
(connected with the Radio Station), Mr. George and Mr, Clef (training officers).
KELLY referred to the following Bulgarian personnel ‘as having been associated
with bis organization and with whom he was acquainted: : Ivan Hristonov, whom he
believes supplanted him in the organization in Athens; Ivan and Dimitur Donev,
whom he claims are presently in Argentina; Choyo.Stonovski (probably Stoyo
Chonovski); Anden Andonov; Gospodin Gospodinov; Hristo Traikov; Vasil Yanchev;

19. KELLY continued by stating that he was apprehended by the Greek Police,

allegedly for safe. keeping ‘in April 1951. He was placed in detention and re=
mained under Greek control until his departure from Greece to Frankfurt by air.

From Frankfurt he was transported to Panama where he arrived on § September 1951, ——|

He was placed in detention at a hospital in Panama and was of the opinion that
perhaps the hespital was an exterminating establishment for undesirables, Later,
however, he said he learned otherwise and through a friend, Mr. Stanley, 1

that he was sent to Panama to undergo several physical check-ups and that after |”
that was completed he would be removed to an area some 50 miles sway where he

would enjoy full freedom, Also that he would remain at his new location long
enough to learn a language and prepare himself for resettlement. When he in-
quired how long that would be he was told that would be about six months,

20, In March 1952. KELLY was transferred to DTROBALO, He stated that he
remained at DTROBALO for six months and after that period he confronted the
authorities concerning his release and resettlement, Approximately one month
later KELIM said he informed. the Station authorities that he would leave the
area if they did not release him as initially promised. He stated that he was
apprehended and placed in confinement until his release in May 1953.

21,. KELLY advised ‘that the above is a true account of his past ex
periences and in view of my limited stay in DTROBALO would appreciate any answer
I could ‘give him regarding questions that have never been resolved and con
sequently have disturbed him, KELLY apparently had a list of questions prepared
which he drew from a notebook and proceeded to read. ‘The questions were as
followss

a. Why was he apprehended by the Greek Police?
bo Why was he placed in confinement in Panama and later at DITROBALO?
ce» How much longer must he remain at DTROBALO?

d, Is there any possibility of his working with the organization
(CIA) to complete the mission he initiated?

@. What happened to the texts he wrote that werdtaken to the
United States by Mr. Willard Allan?

f. Why haven't any of his old ‘friends visited him during the past
* two years?

&e In regards to his family —KELLY stated that only as a last
resort and only if he had to remain at DTROBALO would he want his family

there, He would prefer working and saying sufficient money($2000) to
parehase or build a home for them in Greece and drop the whole matters

In resplnse to the above questions I told Kelly that:
a, He was apprehended by the Greek Police because of his proposed
negotiation with the French IS.

be He was placed

be Ho was placed in confinement at Panama to, undergo mental and
physical check-ups to assure his recovery from the ordeal which he had
undergone," His confinement at DTROBALO was to prevent his contemplated
and announced escapes

c. KELLY's stay at DTROBALO apparently is dependent on his quali-
fications .to meet resettlement requirements, I told him I was. not able to
Judge when he had fulfilled those requirements, There was also the task
involved of finding suitable positions for individuals with varied skill:
in South Americas oy

d. -I told KELLY that there was no opportunity for him to work with
the organization because the men and organization as known to him are no
longer existent. S

” eo I told KELLY that I believe the texts were returned to Greece ti
but that I-would make a further check on my return to Washington,

£. KELLY was told that the people whom he knew in Athens and Sofia .
were no longer with the organization and therefore it was impossible for
they to visit: him,

gs I told KELLY that I did not know anything about his wife and child
other than the fact that KELLY was married and that his wife and child
resided in Athens. I again queried KELLY concerning his wishes regarding
his family, . KELLY asked how long it would take to bring the family to
South America if that were possible. I replied that I had no definite
‘answer, KELLY said that only if he knew he had to remain at DTRORALO
indefinitely would he request to have his wife and child with him,

COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: ~

Ay I found KELLY to be a frail, nervous, alert, and extremely talkative
person, Daring the twelve. hour conference with KEILY I frequently interrupted
him to query him on persons and activities he referred to in his story only to
find him replying briefly and persistently requesting to be allowed to continue
relating his thoughts and feelings.

B, In relating his story of the organization he established and maubers
who couprised the organization KELLY appeared to have a clear and concise
picture of operations he directed and names and descriptions of people with wham
he had come in contact)

C. It is my opinion that KELLY knows little about operations in Greece.
I believe KELLY was so wrapped up in his own abortive missions and personnel
difficulties while in Greece that he paid little, if any, attention to operations
that were running concurrently. KELLY mentioned nares of agents who are bing
currently used in Bulgarian operations; however, he referred to then as Bulgarians

whom he had met

whom he had met in Athens and tried to recruit for his organization, or else

he had been told of them by other sources, In reply to queries and in his own
story, he made no statement which would indicate that he is cognizant of current
Bulgarian operations.

D. I feel confident that KELLY redlizes that his chances of resuming his
role in Greece are at an end and therefore he has resolved to do the next best
thing and that is to contact a former Greek companion (Mr. Karapides) who is a
successful business man in Caracas, Venezuela and seek employment. KELLY is
eager to be resettled and to get out of DTROBALO,

E. I recognize that KELLY is familiar with certain former operations and
agents involved in those operations which, if revealed to unauthorized persons,
could become embarrassing, However, I feel that KELLY's knowledge of current
operations is so minute that the security risks involved to our current operations
would be very little, if any, if he were resettled, Therefore, my recommendation
is to process himfor resettlement.

this Division has reached the conclusion, based on facts set forth in the. {vine

source of serious embarrassment to CIA, 7

3e. Subject, @ Bulgarian refugee in Greece, was the principal
in an. ill-fated. operation run from October 1950 to March 1951. ‘The
operation resulted ina major expose and trial in Sofia during 1951, The
agents used were those selected by Subject, at least one of whem was s
probably an operative of the Bulgarian Militia and acted as the betrayer
of his colleagues.

4, Subject's behavior during his employment wae extraordinarily bad
and characterized by a complete lack of security and a conscious effort
on his part to aggrandize himself at the expense of the United States and
his fellow agents. Unfortunately, during the time of his use by us, he
acquired considerable information about:'ClA personnel, operations and 3

ATTENTICS: Colonel Saith
SUBJECT: Kelly Case

1. In accordance with your request, the following information,
which may be helpful in cennection with subject's rehabilitation, 1s

2. ALL the information we have concerning Kelly's life prior
to his arrival in Greece was furnished by Kelly himself and is almost
wholly unsubstantiated. ‘This, in brief, is Kelly's story: He was
born 7 Nay 192h in Medkevets, Bulgaria, He studied philology in
1942-43 at the University of Sofia. In 1942 he Joined a secret branch -
of the Bulgarian National Agrarian Union and worked alesely with Dr.
Georgi M. Dimitrov in anti-Fascist activities (a claim which Dr.
Dimitrov has denied.) After emerging briefly fron hiding in Septenber
194b, he again went underground, sneaging in acbi-Comanist activities:
in various. cities and towns in Bulgaria, Yugoslavia and Macedonia
where he urged mexbers of the Party to take action against
the Camunists. In October 19h6 he was arrested by the palice,
sentenced to death, but not executed as the Comunists wished to use
hin as a witness against the Agrarian leader Milola Petkor. Sahota
1947 he escaped to Greece.

3. Further light is thrown on Kelly's experiences in a manu~ ad
soript which he claimed to have written and delivered to U. 5S. 7
authorities in Greece with the prupose of finding a publisher for
this, and other, material. It subsequently developed that Kelly was
not the author of these papers but rather had furnished information I
to a Greek friend (John Calavancs) who was the real author. A rough
translation of one of these documents is enclosed.

4. Because of his undeniable organizational ability, tremendous
energy and glib, bat largely untrathful, salesmanship, Kelly was able

fewer political strings attached than any other emigre groups. Further—
more, his organization provided a convenient name for use as a front to
cover operational activities. As a result of the limited recognition

Kelly developed a certain megalomania ani consequently lost his initial :
popularity through dictatorial conduct and completely unwarranted F
behavior as the future head of the liberated Bulgarian state. . An
American case officer who was intinately involved with the Kelly oper-
ations at this period has furnished the following statement:

5. The incitent which made of Kelly an immediate disposal problem
developed along these lines: In early 1951 Kelly informed a member of
oar staff in Athens that he had been contacted by @ French Vice Consul

to.U. 3. interests, Kelly was instructed to break off all contacts. This
he failed to do... In the meantine, a former Kelly man, who had become
disillusioned with kelly's misrepresentations, inforsed us that Kelly
had agreed to give the French. complete information on U. ‘3. plans for
operations against Bulgaria for the sum of 16,000,000 drachmae.
subsequent information on this transaction which our Athens station was
able to learn corroborates the veracity of the account.

6. Although the. extent of Kelly's knowledge of operations was
Limited, it was ccnsidered extresely undesirable to allow these facts
to fall inte French hands. Arrangemente were therefore made with Creek
authorities for Kelly's arrest just prior to his scheduled meeting with
the French representative to whom he was to deliver the information and
from whoa he was te receive the money, In view of these facts, it was
immediately apparent that Kelly was of no further operational use and
presented a definite security threat, for he was revealed as the type
sitoy Sn order to reap personal advantage or to curry favor with potential
supporters, was likely to reveal to the highest bidder whatever operational
4nformation he had gathered. There have been no later developments
which have changed our position in the matter.

of this disposal case are already know to your division,

1.Financisl Finagling in Greece RULGARIAY

(a) In February, 1951, when Kelly was head of. the’Semocratic Bloc,
three of his men arrived-in Athens, coming directly from IRO camps.
They needed. shelter, but had.no money. They were put on salary, but it
was not enough to cover the sixmonths advance rent which it is the custom
to pay when.a lease is made in Athens. Thys Kelly's advance account was
credited with mmxammekr the amount of (45335) $850, which was to be used
to pay the rental advance, The three men were to pay it back in monthly
installments.

To such installments were paid by the men when Kelly was "interned"
‘by our ‘people. The men were then able to complain that Kekky had forced
then into quarters best described as. "very inadequate, insecuremm and
unhealthy." :

Comparing the quality of the quarters with the amount advanced for
rent,it becomes quite-certain that Kelly made some sort of deal with the
landiord.in order to make some money.

Tt should be kept in mind that Kelly forced three of bis ovn countrymen
to live im these quarters, fron which they were forthwith renoved for
health and security reasor

(b) Just prior to his removal, it was discovered that Kelly had a
cash shortage of over #100 which was not accounted for in any way.When
an attempt was made to collect the money, it was discovered that Kelly
had spent it. on. himself,

2, Runkxtpteanbr Maiscript Episode

In Deconter, 1950, Willard Allen, in accordance with a promise made
to Kelly, brought with him to this country three manuscripts, ostensibly
written by Kelly. Allen was. to see what he coujd do to have these manu-
sripts published here. Kelty hoped to thus exploit and dramatize hie
escape from Bulgaria. He was_given, by us, a $300 advance on the PRL
cation of the manuscript.

On December 1, 1951, in a conversation with Mr, Allen, it was learned
by us that Kelly had not written the mamscripts at all. Allen learned this
himself when the real author wrote to him demanding the return of his
works, The author said-that he had a statement from Kelly disclaiming all
credit for the manuscripts. Yurthernore, the real author had seen nothing
of the $300 gimen to Kelly, although they apparently had agreed to go
50-50 on any profits realized from the publication of the manuscripts.

H is clear that Kelly lied to us, and used someone else's literary
talentsin the hope of gaining noteriety and money himself.

3. Relations with the French

In early 1951, Kelly inforned our people in Athens that a Hrench
Vice Consul from Salonica had contacted him in the hope of getting Kelly
to work mithxktexem for his country, Kelly was allowed by us to contime
seeing this man until it was determineaijust what the French wanted in the
way of information. This point was reached, and Kelly was told not. to see
his Frenchman or amy Frenchmen after a certain Thursday, We know definitely
that Kelly saw saw his Frenchman on the following Friday, Saturday, and

Tuesday.

We a6 not know what was said, but from a source whom we have no reason
to doubt, ( an ex-friend of Kelly's who deserted Kelly and came to us to
warn us of mx the situation with the French ) we learned that for a sum
amounting to 16,000,000 drachmae, Kelly had agreed to give the French the
names of all the American staffinvolved in plans to infiltrate Bulgaria,
umeagplus information on Radio Surtutim Gorianin. Kelly was immediately
Picked up by the Greek Alien Directorate, acting upon orders from Henry
McLean.

4, Reaction of Others to Kelly

(a) The Senior Representative of OPC in Athens, Sept. 1951

"Kelly was a notoriously insecure, disreputable, opportunisticiom
indimidual over whom control, other than physical, was next to impossible
to exercise.....He hada positive genius for troubke-making intrigue,
rare even in this part:of the world; his contimed presence in Greece
would have rendered impossible any oilidg of the stormy Bulgarian refugee
watera here, Kelly was tied in even more closely than other Bulgarian
agents with the Embassy here,,,, and could be counted on to use that fact,
wxvkextinemnemt a natter of common knowledge in the Bulgarian colony, to
his own advantage and to the disadvantage of the best. interests of 4. 3,
“overnment policy."

(bv) Chief of station, OPC in Athens, May 1952

"Kelly, unfortunately, is of an essentially irresponsible Irish
natare, Moreover, in his stupidity, he conceives all otkers to. be equally
stupid. Early in our relations with Xeliy,... we foresaw the need to curb
Kelly or to eliminate him from our operations. Since, however, he was
still necessary to us, we tried to use him, restraining him and teaching
him the while, Kelly, unfortunately, did nof learn- he got worse. He
"vorrowed': and stole money from many sources. he lied to many people,
including us, and he developed an infantile megalomania in which he per-
sisted in, considering himself the forthcoming Minister-Presidentrof
Bulgaria. “hings took a serious turn-when-Kelly's comnittee,-men he himself
had chosen, cane tous behind his back complaining ebout him. This became
more serious when Kelly's closest friend,.., deserted Keftky and came to
us apparently. in an honest desire to safeguard America and the struggle
egainst Commnisn from further involvement with a character as shady as
Kelly. ... Since that time we have twaked examined more closely into the
Kekly affair and have found more lies, more secret agreements, more stolen
funds... We have enough proof of tintrustworthiness to have a complete case
againet Kelly, We cannot contime with Kelly, He is finished."

5. Kelly's Relation with his Wife

Gvec '%er (a) From Chief of Station, Panama; ".,,1t was learned through inter-

y wev 1961 (>) From a-lotter written by Kekly to his wife;

rogation that Kelly has no particular concern or love for his wife."

+I think of you
daily and know in detail how you are getting along. I believe you under-
stand this both by the money end by all that you are receiving, when you
want an It 1s I that arranged all thet."

(c) From Memorandum for the Record, 27 Nov. 1951, signed by mi

27 December, 1951. ".... I succeeded in leaving Greece, and freeing ny
soul from the slavery of Flora.... I want for the present that Flora will

lose ell traces of me,"

SUBJECT: . Iyle 0. Kelly IOS, ee

Tt occurs to me, lying happily upon my hepatitic bed as I am, that
some sort 68 a statement regarding the "demise" of Lyle 0. Kelly might
be in order "for the record", I shall discuss two aspects of Kelly in

» this memorandm, ‘apologizing in advance for the vagueness of the dis-

cussion which is due, I shall maintain, to my present horizontal position
far from records, calendars and the recollectionful clink of the Ismailic
gold pound.

1." The good of Lyle 0, Kelly.

In the summer of 1950 QKStair was in the ridiculous position of
being unable to'do anything because the alien support on which it de-
pended, allegedly forthcoming from the reverend Dr. Glantz, was not
forthcoming. In-a bit of a tiazy, anxious to get cracking, we picked
up Lyle 0. Kelly. We suspected at the time that he vas not the mew
"white hope", but we needed someone through whom we could obtain bodies.
We obtained bodies phrough Kelly and actually have accomplished some
substantive work.- it must be remembered that Kelly performed a
useful service for us.

Soe :
2. The bad of Lyle 0, Kelly. :

Kelly, unfortunately, is of an essentially irresponsible * ~
Irish nature. Moreover, in his stupidity, he conceives all others to *

be equally stupid. Early in our relations with Kelly, before I left
LCDrink in October, we foresaw the need to curb Kelly or to eliminate

him from our operations. Since, however, he was still necessary to us,

we tried to use him, restraining him and teaching him the while.

Kelly, unfortunately, did not learn - he got worse. He "bor-
rowed" and stole money from many sources. He lied to many people, in-
cluding us, and he developed an infantile megalomania in which he per~
sisted in considering himself the forthcoming Minister-President of
Dreanland.

Things took a serious turn when Kelly's committee, men he
himself had chosen, came to us behind his back complaining about hin.
This became more serious when his "closest" friend, a Flake, the man
who had actually written the books for which Kelly took eredit, de~
serted Kelly and came to us apparently in an honest desire to safe~
guard America and the struggle against Commniam from further involve-
ee ment-with a character as shady as Kelly.

“~The most serious matter, one which could not be ignored, in-

volved Kelly's relations with the HBFairies. Kelly had advised us that
‘a Fairy Vice Consul from Salonica had contacted him with regard to work-
ing tonsther:.“We-told Tally be might go ahead and. contime hie reletiers

; with this gentlemin until we learned exactly vhat the gentleman wanted.

by .. We: learned ‘what was wanted and advised Selly he vas not repeat not to see
: the Fairy’ agent, or any other Fairies, after a certain Thursday. .We know -
definitely that Kelly did see this Fairy on the following Friday, Setur- |

dsy,-and Tuesday. ‘

: ee rere ie ae ee
. season ‘to doubt ‘the word of his Flake frient which fs essentially es
: follows:,.. 2

that ‘the Fairies vere interested priterily in the. ace
: ’ “names and numbers of all the players (us, that is) in é
BES plans for infiltration of Dreamland, in information on — Tee
ae Radio Gorianin, ete.; that Kelly had agreed to sell : é
‘this information to the Fairies for a sum of 16,000,000
Grackmae and thet he had an appointment to complete the
transaction at 11 o'clock the following morning.

On this information we had Kelly Picked ‘up, and are now. troubled with
the question of disposing of him.

Since that time we have eee od
affair and have found more lies, more secret agreements, more atgten
funds, more of that good, Irish whimsicality for which Kelly ts already
so famous. (Note that even if the hearsay evidence regarding the sell-

out to. the Fairies is erroneous — although it 1s hacked by several in- >.
dependent bits of substantial evidence - ve still have enough ‘proof of
untrustworthiness to have a comphete case against Kelly.) We cannot

continue with Kelly. He is finished. : : 2

(It 4s pertinent to note that Kelly's committee, and his
4n general, feel no feeling of loss since his removal from active politics.
Not a single person has asked about him except his wife - whome.he con—
tinuously disowned - who wanted only to Imow how she might get in touch
with him to ask him for some money. The committee and refugees in
I6Flake in general, are in much better spirits than,they have ever been
before. Kelly's removal is in every way a tonic. )

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: “Development, of the Rift with DIMITRI A. DIMITROV

ae 1, Biography: (See 104 CAGWU, dated 4 October 1950) Born 7 May
. 1924 in Medkovets, Bulgaria. Education—studied philology for one year
at Sofia University, 1942-43. In 1942 joined secret branch of the
zi ’ Bulgarian National Agrarian Union. . Claims to have begun underground,
ah anti-Fascist activities in 1943 in Macedonia and to have worked closely
coos with Dr... M..Dimitrov during this time, After emerging briefly from
/* Riding in September 1944, he again went underground engaging in anti-
Commnist activities, touring various cities and towns, (including
sections of Yugoslav/Macedonia) and urging members of the Agrarian party
to: take positive action against the Commnists. In October, 1946, he
was arrested by the police. He believes the reason he was not executed
“was that the Comminists wished to use him as witness against Nikola
"Petkov. On:23 July. 1947 he escaped to Greece.

In Ostober, 1950, the OKSTAIR Field Chief learned of Dimitrov through :

Dimitrov made six agents immediately available for infiltration operations.

Three of these six were successfully infiltrated on 10 December,

a, In Athe 4821, IN 3022h, Manfield reported on 22 March that —.-:
he was considering breaking off association with Dimitrov because — +...
he had become too unpopular and dictatorial and self-important, &

i There were also indications of serious misappropriation of funds.

under the leadership of Ivan Donev Ivanov. .

b. In Athe 5150 (IN 36130) dated 20 April: 1951, Manfield S
cabled that he had had the Greek Aliens Directorate pick up Dimitrov z
and put him under protective arrest for the reasons indicated above ‘
and because Dimitrov mag about to sell out to the French. (This
was discovered through an OPC penetration of Dimitrov's organization. )
He also requested instructions on how to dispose of Dimitrov for
a period of three months, which he felt was sufficient time in
which to render him harmless to QXSTAIR operations.

SUBJECT: Lyle 0, KELLY . :

1. As a result of discussions between WHD, SE, CFI, and DD/A, it was
decided to send an SE representative to DIROBALO to interview Lyle 0, KELLY ;
for the purpose of determining whether he represented sufficient security hazard
to current SE operations out of Greece to warrant his being retained in maximum:
detention.

2. In accordance with this agreement, Major Michael A. Hemovich.was sent.
to DIROBALO where he arrived at noon on 26 May 1953.

ae 39 Major Hemovich discussed the case with the case officers concerned .-
: at DTROBALO, and then spent twelve hours talking to KBLLY, As a result of %
this, it has been ascertained to our satisfaction that KELLY does not appear to
: have information of sufficient currency regarding staff or agent personnel, or
2 current operations, in Greece to make his resettlement within the course of the
next twelve months a serious security riake oe

lhe We therefore recomend that Ly}e 0, KELLY be given whatever training

in language and trade WH Division feels is required, and that efforts then be
made to resettle him in South America, Our only request is that this Division
be kept informed of the progress of this rehabilitation and be advised of the ;
steps taken to resettle KELLY, In this connection it should be pointed out =
that KELLY has a wife and child in Greece, When queried by Major Hemovich
about them, he professed no.interest in having the wife or child join him,
stating that he would like to provide some-money-for thesupport.of the child
if and when.he got a job and could put aside. some money for this purpose. It
is therefore our intention to have KELLY write his wife a letter telling her
that be bas no further. interest inher, that she should obtain a divorce, but
that he will provide her with a certain sum of money for the child, (This sum

SUBJECT: - Dimitri Adamoff DIMITROV.

1. Subject was born on 7 May 1924 in Medkevets,
Bulgaria. He studied philology for one year at Sofla University
from 1942-1943... During the war he worked illegally in Greek.
Macedonia and Vardar, Macedonia to escape authorities. He
returned home after the war; he was soon disillusioned by the
Communists, :and went te Sofia. Latex he made a clandestine
tour of Bulgarian towns and cities urging agrarians to take posi:

stated that bie life: was spared because he was groomed as &
witness against PETKOV. He escaped to Greees in 1947. He:

uated Subject as having a very great deal of the charistan about
him, and was.considered a "phony."" However, notwithetanding.
his superficiality and the exaggeration to which he was prone,
Subject had anintuitive grasp of the rudiments of political deport-
ment and showmanship and he was so devoted to his self-appointed:
task of organising his "democratic block” that it was thought that
he might become an important Bulgarian figure.

3..In Novernber, 1950, because ‘of bis background and -
"experience, .Sabject was considered ag an individual who could: -

make significant psychological and political warfare contributions
to operations in Greece. Subject was then very active among
Bulgarian refugees in Greece. Early in October, 1950, he visited
the ‘Lavrion Camp where he spoke to the Bulgarian refugees and. °:
outined the tasks that he wag to assume, which included intelli+
gence activities in Bulgaria, organising an underground resistance
movement in Bulgaria, and organizing sabotage activity against...
Bulgaria. Subject was not security conscious; he revealed the
location of his office and told his listeners that his office had two
Bulgarian typewriters and that he had a car with United States

Hcense plates. In April, 1951, Subject wae in contact with the
¥renck Vice-Coneul and his wile, a French diplomat stationed in
Athena, an elderly Greek who worked and otherwise had close
comections with the French, and other Greek personalities. In.
April, 1951, besides his wife he had several other bed partners.
Because of the operational security violations which had arisen,
it was recommended urgently that Subject be removed from cir-
culation.

4. ‘Odservers in Athens considered Subject ta be too
dictatorial and self-important and if he was not actually insane, he
appeared to be suffering from delusions of grandeur... For instance, *
he made references to his future role 28 prime minister of Bulgaria..
Because of Subject's neurotic, unstable character, it was deemed
advisable to transfer Subject to. Panama. Subject wae taken to...
Panama on 6 September 195i and was considered as a neuro-psychiatri:
case. On 9 October 1951,.-he began a hunger strike at midnight and

. did not, break the fast until 9 a.m. on 4 Octeber 1951. He asked that ©"

his former secretary in the Partisan Movement, : who was located:
somewhere in Bulgaria, be brought to Panama. The:dectors’ con-
cern, particularly the neure-psychiatrist, Indicated that they cot
net treat Subject adequately.

7. Since entering the United States, Subject has been
a continual source of embarassment... His megalomania is evident
in the various communications with government agencies... Fer
example, he recently commented in one letter that ho would like
to be appointed Richard Nixon's anti-communist adviser for Albania,
Yugoslavia, Macedonia, Rumania, and Bulgaria. He stated that he
could berate all these countries within five years if he were allowed



te work actively with financial support. His first objective would
be to liberate Bulgaria, his homeland, make it a free democracy,

MEMORANDUM |. ocr

SUBJECT: Dimitar Adamov DIMITROV aka "Diko” DIMITROV.

1A review of Agency files reveals the following data concerning Subject»
and his association with CLA.

2. Subject was feet contacted in October 1950 by the Field Chief of OPG..
activities in Athens, Greece... The purpose of this contact was to assess |
Subject.as.a principal agent and focal point in the recruitment of Bulgarians -
to participate:in OPC operations directed against Bulgaria... For this purpose
an organisation called the Democratic Bloc was established, and Subject was.

3. During the period October 1950 through Mareh 1951, Subject remained
in the employ of OPC in Athens and provided 2i agents for infiltration into -
Balgaris,,but he never participated in the cross-border operations.

4: In early 1951, various operational and admisi trative difficulties
began to manifest themselves and it was decided that Subject should be
removed from his position. In April 1951 it came to OPC's attention that
Subject intended to sell his knowledge of CIA's activities to the French ;
Intelligence Service, . This fact was used as the primary reason for his
removal from active participation in Bulgarian operations.

5. Because of operational security considerations ane ieee ask
duplicity and personal make-up, it was deemed inadvisable to leave Subject
at large in Greece and it was decided that.he should be transferred to a C1A.
holding facility at Fort Clayton, Panama. He was airlifted from Athens to
Frankfurt where he.was hospitalized four days for observation, and then ..
flown black to Fort Clayton, arriving on 4 September 1951. He remained |
there until January 1954.

6. A CIA case officer was dispatched from ee in May 1953
to Fort Clayton where he interrogated Subject. i was determined at that ©
time that whatever operational knowledge Subject had of CLA, its methods.
personnel, and operations was obsolete.



13-00000

7, (With termination of the holding facility at Fort Clayton, Subject
was temporarily removed to Greece since there were no other immediate
possibilities to resettle him, (The attached understanding with Subject.
was effected o/a t2 January {954 at the time of his removal from Fort
Clayton.) CLA made s commitment to the Greek authorities that CIA . \
would not abandon Subject in Greece and would take steps to remove him
from Greek soil within one year. Efforts were made to effect Subject’s < ghee
migration to Canada, New Zealand, Australia and elsewhere, but.to no
avail, After due consideration by interested headquarters elements and a
the Athens Station, it was decided that the best effective solution for F
Subjects disposal would be to let him immigrats. te the United States on

< his own under. the Refugee Relief Act program, but without aay. ascistance
from CIA, FE

8... Since arrival in the United States, Subject has come to our attention
“on the following occasion: i

u On iA May 1957, the Department of State informed CIA that
Subject.had contacted their office cod tried to interest them in
purchasing a feature length film script. At that time Subject told’”
+ the Department of State that he was living in Newark, New Jersey,
oe with bis wife and seven-year-old daughter and was in Washington
4 on a visit. The State Department had no interest in the film seript *.
hue and asked if: members of this Agency weuld Like te meet Subject and”
i discuss the script. This offer was turned down. The case officer
involved understood that State Department then discontinued all
contact with Subject, There is no further information available.

. 9. Although he was considered to be of operational value at the time he 7
was originally picked up by elements of GIA, Subject's subsequent actions, . woe
lack of integrity and poor security indicated that he waa unworthy of any mee
further operational consideration, He has a tendency to exaggerate to the ais
point of lying and become involved in deals of which he wae the financial .
benefactor, Throughout all his deals, however, there is the thread of alleged ae
national pride and desire to project himself in the fight againat Communism... *
There have been reported rumors of his having been a Bulgariaa IS agent i
even during the time when he was employed by CIA, Ne concrete evidence,
however, was actually uncovered to substantiate these allegations, which
are believed to be typical of denunciations made by rivat political factions

among emigres,

¥

10.. As the result of the review of Subject's ease, it is recommended

that nothing farther be done for him sinew he does not possess any damaging. >.
information concerning current operations and his memory of past operations
-and personalities is between nine and ten years old... (In view of the circum-
’ stances of termination, {t should be pointed ont to Subject that in pressing »
