BUBSZCCT: Technical Analysis of Letter end Envelope -
DB CASE g4361
REFERENCE: W8/2 Memo dated 13 December 1963

1. ‘In response to referenced request, ap original typevritten
letter and envelope addressed to the American Enbassy, Stockhols,
vere examined in order to determine the origin of the letter and the
nationality of the writer.

2. ‘The following ccnclusions vere dravn concerning the letter 5
and envelope:

- a. The typewriter fn question 1s equipped with an obsolete

. style of German-made type which, according to our references, was

i fitted on a mmber of typewritere made in Germany during the 1920s

‘ and early 19308. The poasible mexes would be Stoewer, Toryedo, '
4 Mercedes, Rheimmetall, Urania, Orga, Yortuna, Continental, Kappel, 4
i Grome, Triweph, Merz and yossibly tame others.- Of theso-makes, -

the Torpedo, Mercedes, Rheinmetall and Triumph were probatly the

most widely distributed.

b. The machine in question 1a equipped with a black and red
ritton. The keyboard is very probably Svedish, as shown ty two

j strike-overs: umlaut-u for hyphen and "2" for “a”. ‘These

i characters are adjacent on the standard Svedish keyboard, but not

i on the German. ‘The unlaut-a vas not used in the street address,

' 2 i? "Strandvagen” (where the dots should have been placed over the :
i Second "a"). This might be either a simple oversight or an attempt E
to conceal the writer's familiarity vith the correct spelling. i

c. The paper of the letter is of the international standard
(DI) size "AS" which 1s almost universally used in Sweden. ‘he H .
: Linen-textured stationery ecems to be rather comon in Sweden. :

i : The two smaller pieces of blank paper match the letter paper with ‘

respect to width, thickness, color, texture and look- » snd

ae - were probably cut from another sheet of the eame type. ‘The envelope ‘
matches spocizens of Svsdish envelopes taken from me/s+Postal..
Intelligence files.



DB Memo #6585 - Page 2

a. The letter. was.posted frou the.Stockholn Een post office,..
Which 1s located in the central railvay terainal is Stockhols.
All mail deposited in etreet mail toxes in this area or in the post
. office would be processed tarough thie station.

e. The concelYation cachet on tne enveloje te identical ia
all resyects (format, postmark, number style and length of killer
vara) to exeaplara available in cur office.

f. The postage is correct for Svedisa internal mail and the
postage stamp is of current issue.

@. A ycsoible irregulerity is the time lag tetveen the internal
dote of the letter, the date of the postmark and the date of receipt
in the American imbassy. ‘he total time from the interval date of
the letter to the tins of receipt is eight days, the time between
the date of posting and the date of receiyt is more than three days.
‘This trensit tims of more then three days for intra-city mail apjeere
irregular vhen compared with the average transit tize of only two-.
three days for arrival between Stockhols end the United States.

3. ‘the text of the letter warrants some comments because @ number
of peculiarities vere noted - aside from jure ovelling or typing errors -
vnich seon to indicate a Svediah writer. Tue folloving vorde represent

veither Sweden spelling or modification: "reserv”, "etabiiened", "warded",

“Krustjev". Other examples of Svedish grammar end cyntax would be:
“mst” (as pact tense), ‘in Soviet” (Swedish form but not spelling),
“he vas spy” (without indefinite article), "FDI, USA" (vithout definite
article), "should" (rather than ‘would”), “outamggled” (Svedish past
participle form); and~“waole the vorla”-(pure: Swedioh fora)’

4, Another significant detail is the name given, “Ryo Liang Yuan".
“Ryo” 1s not 9 standard spelling in any known Romanization system used
for Chinese. "R" is eeen in the nev Chinese Communist cational cystem,
but never in combination vith “yo”. "Ryo" 1s a Japancee spelling. In
the name given it 1s not known whether the Chinese or Western presen-
tation is used, in other vords, whether “Ryo” or “Yuan” is meant to be
the surname. Among Chiness syllables vhich could be re;resented by the
Sepaness "Ryo" are Lies, Liang and Lung. Of these Lung (7C:'7893) and
Idang (10:2733) are used as surnames. In either case, “Ryo” is handily
@ name by vhich a real Chinese vould identify himself.

5. Yo emumary, end based on the above information, it 1s concluded
that the letter vas trenszitted via normal Svedish rostal channels. The
letter 1s probably a “crank letter”, most likely vrittes by a ‘Swede,
using a Svedish-keyboard typevriter and Swedish stationery.

25/11-53,

The Fresident of the United States of Awerica, Jonn F Xennedy was

assassinated by Lee H Oswald by direct order of the governzent of

the Peoples Republic of China. Lee H Oswald executed the act alone

but there was helpers and reserv. “Now all is over" was password

to his customers, Oswald was a fully convinced Cézmunist but he

Gust assassinate Kennedy. We etablised contact with Oswald already

when he was in Sowiet but then to try to get him as a spy for China,

Later he was spy for us. “hen Lee il Oswald had returned fo USA we

contacted niw anew uod freshened up his aind "you have beea a spy :
for us" and told him what could happen to him if PBI got informed. a
Now we had him. He got his last information in kexico. /It was not

good to assassinate Zennedy in Lexico/ "Fair Play for Cuba" was

started only to confuse and throw the blame on Castro for the as-

ssassinateé. Our government thought that USA should atteck Cuba

when- Xennedy-was-murded as the orginaztion was~behind the: assassin=~

ation. Shen Cuba was attaczed by USA Sowiet must help Castro defend

himself. It that was so it would »urden.Sowiet-that..0swald.had..visi-

ted. We should be allieted with Sowiet then we would ask them for A-

bombs and they should not be able to refuse us. We and Sowiet should

win this war and whole the world should be Comcunistic. Then we should

assassinate Krustjev and other Sowiet leaders and we would be leader

of the NEW WORD. When this letter will reach you they have maked

away with me and all that knowed the planes. This letter is outsmuggled ; ee
from our Embassy in Stockholm where the Embassy is a: chinese spy-shool.
