i at : SECRET

April 1998

chief,

IRG/OIM

: Status and Issues: The ARRB staff has agreed to recommend
- to.the Board that the information related to those covert
» actions: be considered non-related and the documents

design ted “Not Believed Related” (NBR). The document will
be grouped with similar “NBR” documents and be presented to
xd for!action at its’ 13 April or.12 May meeting.

lias Documentation and Accommodation

The security file of former Agency employee,
David Morales (deceased -- true name already released),
within the sequestered collection contains documentation on
five of his alias. We anticipate similar problems as we re-
review other security files within the sequestered
collection. The ARRB staff has proposed a compromise
resolution to this problem as follows:

-- Protect all references to ‘official }documents

reflecting the alias such as (SSN, Drivers | Bex ete.7

~- Release items designated as pocket litter such as
club cards, etc.;

-- Protect elements of accommodation addresses to avoid
identifying specific locations; and

-- Then make a decision to actually release or protect
the alias itself depending on the timeframe and its
importance to the JFK story.

hey. 411° also prépose ‘that a‘ generic.DO organization chart
be prepared in lieu of the records in’contention. The chart
“would. inélude those components that were involved in the
Oswald story and anti-Castro activities. These JMWAVE and
DO organization charts have been the subject of several
discussions and meetings with the ARRB staff over the past
few months. The ARRB staff is clearly leaning toward
recommending that the JMWAVE chart be released; an actual
vote on these records by the Board will not take place until
the May meeting.

(s) > ARRB Request, CIA-IR.-15, Mexico City Tapes.

This. peauene asked for a thorough search of. Agency files and
documents for and CIA “surveillance ~take’ from Cuban and
Soviet. facilities in Mexico City at the time of the Oswald
visit and in the immediate wake of the assassination.”
Among the items provided by the DO were five boxes
containing audio tapes from tel-tap on Cuban and Russian

~ embassies and facilities. A number of the tapes are dated
22 November 1963; many others are dated 23 November 1963
through December 1963.

’ Status and Issues: ° The ARRB ‘staff has as’ ed the question,

the tapes from 22 and 23 November to be Assassination

Records. A vote on releasing the tapes will be delayed
until the May meeting.

(Ss 5. {LITAMIL-Y -- a CIA Penetration (7 the Cuban,
Embass: The identity of/LITAMIL-9|_ was inadvertently

released in 1993. He is now/identified in true name as a)

CIA agent fin John Newman's book, Oswald and the CIA.|_As of
1993, {LITAMIL-9/ was ‘still alive, living genre and
he has family in/Cuba} Up to now, the ARRB Board has agreed
to protect his identity and crypt and delay the release of
his 201 file until the Agency could make some judgments
about the potential damage created by the release on

additional documents with his name/crypt in them.

tatus and Issues: The ARRB has requested that we address
LI- 9 issue at the May meeting. The DO has confirmed that
LI-9/is still alive and living in(Mexico City). The HRP/DO

JFK teams are currently reviewing the 201 and other /LI- 9)
material in the file. It is unlikely that the Board would
agree to delay release until 2017, however, there is
precedent for delaying release of records on individuals for
shorter periods or until death.

f (Ss) 6. Richard Gibson, CIA asset. _ Gibson, who presently >
\lives in England, is a left wing journalist who was Ee
“associated with the Fair Play For Cuba Committee (FPFCC), an)
entity to which Oswald wrote letters and claimed to be a
member. Gibson did not become an Agency asset until after ;~
(the_a: assassination, however,-he- had been of interest to the.
FBI when he headed the FPFCC. Unfortunately a combination j
of previous releases and release by 1 oard led to press /
\reports in 1994/1995 about his relationship with the CIA. At /'
that time, CIA officers were dispatched to advise him ~about “7
(the possible compromise and promise him the very best é
lattempt at protecting the relationship. ARRB also agreed /
ito delay the release of any additional information until the 7
sAgency and FBI had determined the full extend of the files /

“held between the ARRB staff, HRP JFK team and the
* appropriate: IRO‘to. discuss. the scope of the request.
Usually, the’ ARRB staff are first provided shelf lists,
indexes, records lists, etc. for the purpose of
narrowing/selection what they think is important. HRP
assist the IRO or component representatives in reviewing
the selected files to ensure they deal with appropriate
subjects and timeframes. Once access is approved, the
appropriate IRO and component sets up a file review session
with the ARRB staff. If material requested is particularly
sensitive, access can be limited to the ARRB Executive
Director or members of the Board. Any records selected as
Assassination Records are subject to review under the JFK
Act. This process has be used for numerous requests for
