SUBJECT: Radio Messages for Stokely Carmichael
During the April 1963 Riots in Washington, D.C,

1. During the civil disorders of 6 and 7 April 1968
in Washington, D.C. following the assassination of Dr. Martin
Luther King, Jr., an employee of this Agency heard on his
car radio messages directed to Stokely Carmichael. The
employee does not remember the station of which the program
was broadcast; however, he identified it as a local "rock and
roll" station which was located in the 1400-1600 range on the
AM dial.

2. An acquaintance of this employee aiso mentioned
hearing during this period messages such as "Stokely Carmichael,

please call your headquarters"; regular radio programs were inter-
upted to broadcast these messages.
