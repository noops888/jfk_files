VIL COSTS

A. Past Project Year - Station nce records indicate that Project
LIEMPTY expended approkitnately $26, 250 during Fiscal Year 1962
(1 December 1961 - 30 June 1962) and has thus far during Fiscal Year
1963 (trough 30 September 1962) expended about $7,000.00. It is
anticipated that about $8,000, 00 will be expended during the last two
months (October and November 1962) of the project year. This will
make a cotal expenditure during the project year of about $43, 250, or
$5, 250.0 under the budger estimate of $49, 500,00.

B. Next Project Year ~ Of the total $49, 900.00 budget, itemized below,

approximately $30, 400,00 should be expended during the remainder of
Fiscal Year 1963 and the balance, $19, 500.00 should be expended during
Fiscal Year 1964, Normal accounting procedures will be used for all ex-
penditures.

iL CURRENT OBJECTIVES AND PRODUCTION
A, Oliver G, SCANTLING Segment (discussed in relation to project
objectives):

1, "To collect operational information pertaining to LIMERICK
personnel and physical facilities." SCANTLING has continued (See the
Jast two Project Reviews forwarded as attach: ts to HMMA-~-14093,

13 November 1959, and HMMA-15979,,.18 November 1960) to provide
worthwhile information pertaining to this objeenive,

a, During the past year SCANFLING has continued to be
used to follow lip leads producéd }} UMNVOY. For example,

onal information receytbyikdicated that the LIMERICK
target was using the servicés of a Mexico City firm to repair

2s, Through discreet investigation SCANTLING was able to

the firm, its location and the name of the owner in the
ent that we later wished to make an approach to him ot to
exploit this information in another manner,

SCANTLING does an excellent job on this type of assignment
due principally to his ability to observe and report objectively.

3. "To exploit. operational leads taroaph recruitments, debriefings,

directly and indirectly as will be noted byte examples listed below:

Ne
a.’ SCANTLING devoted a lot of time to the

surveillance and attempted recruitment of Abel (RTEAGA) a

Mexican national employed at the Cuban Embassy. SCANTLING

taiked with ARTEAGA several times and undoubtedly was

marily responsible for the later success of the recruit

d. SCANTLLING spent six weeks during July and
August of this year giving tradecraft and surveillance
training to LIPAILS 5 and 7 from Monterrey, Although
‘his is not a direct contribution to the above objective, it
considered sufficiently related to mention here,

in addition to his contributions to the above objectives,

SCANTLING is used for miscellaneous support requirements from the
Station, For example, SCANTLING is now handling LIEMBROIL-~2 and

will continue to do so until the return of LIMOTOR-14 in June 1962, Also,
during the past project year, SCANTLING handled the LIRICE surveillance
team until July i961 when Simon D, CLACKETT (ps) returned to Mexico
City, SCANTLING is also used to spot and,refit(safe houses and apartments
for other Station operations, AS

Wall

5. As stated ifithe\preceeding Requests for Project Renewal,
although SCANTLING's\LIEMPTY Project‘objechives can never be completely
fulfilled, it is the Station's opinion that SCANTLING has made important and
valuable contributions to LIEMPIY Project objectives specifically and to
other Station activities in géne?al. SCANTLING's production, measured
against monetary expenditures, case officer time and other intangible factors,
unquestionably justifies his continuation as an integral part of Project
LIEMPTY.

3. "To provide operational support to Station operations, i.e.

GERENDE is used frequently to rent hotel rooms and apartments for other
Station operations and activities. GERENDE's comprehensive area
knowledge and personal operational capabilities combine to make him an
extremely valuable Station asset for such support activities. GERENDE
also procures and services post office box letter drops for the many
Station operations requiring them.

A, General comments pertaining to the value of the project efforts to the
Station's needs - The Station is of the opinion that its operations are only
as good as the support mechanisms backstopping and contributing to them,
The availability of unilateral support agents and organizations, suck
the LIEMPTY Project, to investigate leads and to collect operational
informacion is an indispensable ingredient to the Station's espionage and _
counterespionage objectives, The Station would

C. Targets of Opportunity: ~ They iWediate availability of independent
assets to perform investizasions) photographic assignments and other
essential types of support\strvices in connéction with Station targets of
opportunity represent an operational advantage which this Station considers
highly significant, It is due to such LIEMPTY assets that an agent can be
sent to distant areas in Mexico to do investigations, that photographs can
be made of individuals and places which are of operational interest and
apartments and hotel rooms can be acquired in fictitious names in

support of sensitive operations and activities,

D, Although the progress and success of any support project depends
upon requirements from other Station operations, it must be concluded
that Project LIEMPTY has indeed been effective during the past project
year,

PROBLEMS

A, Security - The activities of the LIGAAY base were suspended in
September 1960 as a direct result’of the arest of three KURIOT
technicians by the Cuba rnment, > of the technicians was known
to have knowledge ofthe four LIMUST units.(LICALLA: is located in.one
of these units) and the Station considered it'appropriate to suspend photo-
graphic operations pending resolution of the situation, At this time,
there is no indication when|LICALLA operations will be resumed, The
LICALLA base operator has reported that there have been no unusual
inquiries or other suspicious actions which might indicate that LICALLA
has been compromised to LIMERICK personel; however, sucha

r: vill exist until the release of the three technicians, No
urity problem. ve occurred during the past year.

little use in producing gogdiit cit ts of individuals, In view
of these experiments, aoe WetOgraphy has not yet been attempted,
It should be noted that Eastman Kodak's new TRI-X PAN film, which
all bases and LIENTRAP now use, is superior to any film previously
used by the Station for clandestine photography, ‘The quality of all
base photographs have been increased considerably as a direct result
of this new film,

C, General Comments - The Station believes that the GERENDE

segment is now operating under optimum organizational arrangments

and there are no plans for expansion contemplated at this time,. It is

tt SCANTLING will soon be relieved of his interim

for the LIJERSEY team and can concentrate more on his

investigative and casing activities, The transfer of the LIJERSEY team

to Project LITEMPO reduced Project LIEMPTY activities by an

appreciable amount. It is not planned, i Fumgithe coming year, to

expand present LIEMPTY activities: Wi\\\\

A, Past Project Year - Station finahee\ records indicate that Project
LIEMPTY expended $19, 120.91 durity Fiscal Year 1960 (‘December
1959 - 20 June 1960) and has thus far during Fiscal Year 1961 (through
31 October 1960) expended $16, 734,69, Contract Agents salaries and
allowances paid by Headquarters bring the total expenditures for 11
months of the project year to approximately $50,000.00, An additional
