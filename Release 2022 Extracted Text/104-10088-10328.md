affect either the security or the effectiveness of this operation.

The security

problem tacing the IICALIA portion of the operation and deccrioed in HMMA-15079

(For the purpose of Project Renewal)

i CURRENT OSIEGIVES AND MUCHENT IOM

1. Oliver G. SCANTING Segment (discussed in relation to project

objectives):

1. "'To collect operational information pertaining io LIMERICK

personnel and physical facilities." SCANTLING has continued (see pre-

vious Projaci Reviews forwarded as attachments to HMMA-17999, 31

cellent exampie of this blending of various Station support assets was the

investigation and casing performed by SCANTLING after leads from both

LIENVOY and LIFEAT indicated the possibilitylof launching a successful

rechnical operation against the residengefafa ligh ranking LIMERICK

intelligence officer assigned to Merica undar diplomatic cover.

With the

aid of the thorough casing report and reighborhood investigation completed

by SCANTLING, Station KYRIOT personnel, supported by other Station

support assets, were suecessful in installing a technical device in the

SCANTLING continues to be the Station's primary means of keeping

cürrent records on the residences of the many Soviet personnel in Mexico

This is primarily accomplished through SCANTLING's follow up of

all LIENVOY leads which indicate interest by Soviets in specific quarters.

(See previous project renewal requests for additional details.)

2. "To collect operational information pertaining to other targets of

opportunity, foreign official installations and personnel of incelligence in-

terest operating in Mexico".

. SCANTLING is very useful for collecting in-

formation on other Station targets:

On the basis of a lead from the ODACID installation in

Veracruz, the Station (with Headquarters support) mounted an

operation to unobtrusively sabotage a large unic of agricultural

machinery (of U.S. origin) which was in transi: to Cuba.

mount this operation, a precise and detailed casing of the imple-

ment was essential. This SCANTLING was able to accomplish in

one trip to Veracruz with results that contributed substanticly-co

the operation.

c. In the Satellite area, SCANTLING completed a casing of

an official Yugoslav installation in conjunction with a projected

Station technical operation.

3. "To exploit operational leads through recruitments, debriefings,

and surveillances.

SCANTLING has contributed to this objective both

directly and indirectly as noted in the following examples:

э.

SCANTLING completed a detailed and secure interview of

the fiancee of BESMOOTH to determine her connection with the

principals in the MCMAYFOWL case, particularly any connection

with procurement of documents used

in the flight behind the Iron

Curtain.

This assignment was extremely sensitive (SCANTLING

was not told true reason for interview) and SCANTLING did an

admirable job wal

e-maintaining his cover for having the interview.

SCANTLING was called on for extensive initial spade work

in the BEKNAVE/BECHiCK operation.

SCANTLING gave his

usual competent performance despite the fact that the role assigned

nim was unique to his experience.

c. SCANTLING performed one man surveillance of a sensitive

Station Soviet double agent which contributed significantly to thai

operacion.

d. SCANTLING was used extensively during the visit of

CiDEAL as part of the Station's effort in providing maximum

protection for the GPIDEAL party.

e. In addition, SCANTLING performed numerous pretext and

neighborhood investigations, some of which were highiy sensitive.

SCANTLING also does most of the local investigations requested by

ODACID and other ODYOKE components.

In addition to his contributions to the above objectives, SCANTLING

is used for miscellaneous support requirements from the Stacion.

Foi example,

SCANTLING handled MEMBROIL-2 until the return of LIMOTOR -14 in July

1952. SCANTLING is also used to spot und rent sare houses and apartments

for other Station operations.

Ege preceeding Requests for Project Renewal,

although SCANTLING'S

LEMMAProject objectives can never be com-

pletely futrilled, it is theiStation's opinion that SCANTLING has made

linportant and valuable contributions to LIEMPTY Projeci objectives

specifically and to other Station activities in general. SCANTLING's

production, measured against monetary expenditures, case officer time

and other intengible factors, unquestionably justifies his continuation

as an integrai part of Project LlEMPTY.

B.

Raymond H, GERENDE Segment (discussed in relation to project

objectives):

1. "To collect operational information pertaining to LIMERICK

personnel and physical facilities through use of photographic base houses. "

Three photographic bases, LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA, contribute

to this objective.

Io avoid repetition, the Station is omitting the usual

description of the functions of these treelbases and how they contribute

to the above objective,

Eris was described in detail in the 1960 Request for

Project Renewal. (HMM

2. "To collect operational information and identify operational

leads partaining to Station tangets of opportunity." The LIENTRAP operation,

handled by GERENDE, is still the major contributor to this objective.

Arrong LIENTRAP's regular and extensive photographic assignments, was

the photo stakeout of prominent Mexican Communists (some of whom have

never been photographed previously by KUBARK) and Communist Party

Headquarters.

During this assignment, LIENTRAP was able to cover

the recent move of PCM Headquarters (the first information Station had

of the move) and to continue photo surveillance at the new site.

3. "To provide operational support to Station operations, i. 2.,

rent hotel rooms and apariments, and conduce counter-surveillances.

4. The quality and quantity of operational information produced

by the photographic bases and other activities under GERENDEs control

and supervision is considered worthwhile and in some cases unique. The

Station concludes; therefore, that this segment of the LIEMPTY Projeci

should be continued.

C. Relationship to Related Mission Directive Objectives:

As siated in previous project renewals, it can readily be noted that

Project LEMPTY has provided support to many Station operations and in

this manner nas been a contributing factor to the furtherance of the Related

Mission Directive.

The project has not produced any positive intelligence

nor has it been intended that it should do so.

The project's sole purpose

is to provide a mechanism for the development of operational information

in support of other Station operations.

II. CHANGES

There have been no changes in the LIEMPTY Projeci during the

pasi projeci year affecting either objectives or personnel.

Ill. _EFFECTIVENESS

There has been no change in Project LIEMPTY which would alter

the valiaity of the remarks made in Section III of 1960 projeci renewal re-

quest (HMMA 15979)

IV. PROBLEMS

The security problem in connection with the LICALLA operation,

which was described in 1960 renewal request, is still present our has

caused no mown difficulty. At Headquarters suggestion in SiMMW-9736, the

LICALLA

base was reactivated on 29 May 1961.

The base operator con-

tinues to be alert for any unusual incidents which might indicate thai the

base has been compromised.

V. PLANS

LOS RAIN

The Station considers that the proico isloperating ai lus optimum

size and does not plan tp expand it during the coming year. Enorts will

be continued to refinel and better utilize the existing project organizational

arrangements.

As in the past, the Station will continue its ufforts to

improve ine compartmentalion one securty of the project.

Review of Project LIEMPTY

(For the Purpose of Project Renewal)

I.

CURRENT OBJECTIVES AND PRODUCTION

A. Oliver G. SCANTLING Segment (discussed in relation to project

objecives) :

"To collect operational information pertaining to LIMERICK

personnel and physical facilities.

" SCANTLING has continued (See the...

last two Project Reviews forwarded as attachments to HMMA-14093,

13 November 1959, and HMMA-15979, L0 November 1960) to provide

worthwhile information pertaining to this objective.

During the past year SCANTLING has continued to be

used to follow up leads produced byE ENVOY. For example,

operational information recentblindicated that the LIMERiCK

target was using the services of a Mexico City firm to repair

safes. Through discreet investigation SCANTLING was able to

identify the firm, its location and the name of the owner in the

event that we later wished to make an approach io him or to

exploit this information in another manner.

b. SCANTLING is still the Station's primary source for

Keeping current records on the residences of the many LIMERICK

personnel in Mexico City. This is accomplished in several ways;

the most important being SCANTLING's follow up of all LINVOY

leads which indicare the LIMERICK people are interested in

renting a given piece of property. (See previous project renewal

request tor additional details).

2. "To collect operational informatioh pertaining to other targets

of opportunity, foreign official installations nad personnel of irelligence

interest operating in Mexico.

SCANTLING is very usefui for collecting

information on other Station targets:

DROD CTION

of a request to the Station from the

ODACID Chief,

SCANTLING Was sent to Puebla to be ar

eyewitness to the 4 June|7961 Catholic inspired anti-CASTRO

deinonstrations.

Nationly did SCANTLING obta in the desired

information, and samples of many of the leaflets used, but he

prepared his report for the Station in time for the COS to give

the ODACID Chief a briefing at 1000 hrs., 5 June 1261.

SCANTLING does an excellent job on this type of assignment

due principally to his ability to observe and report objectively.

b. SCANTLING was instrumental in establishing that

Fernando LLANES Cavero and his wife were living at a local

Mexico City address. This case has been of considerable

counterespionage interest to Headquarters.

c. SCANTLING has continued his contributions to the

Paul Frederick KIRSCHHOFF case by

eriodic interviews with

the subject's neighbors and associates

"To exploit operational leads through recruitments, debriefings,

and surveillances.

" SCANTLING has contributed to this objective both

directly and indirectly as will be noted by the examples listed below :

a. SCANTLING devoted a lot of time to the

surveillance and attempted recruitment of Abel ARTEAGA,

Mexican national employed at the Cuban Embassy.

SCANTLING

talked with ARTEAGA several times and undoubredly was

primarily responsible for the later success of the recruitment

made by another Station agent.

Some additional time was devoted to the Cesar

GONZALEZ Sanchez case in February #p6l when SCANTLING

determined that GONZALEZ was Stillin Mexico Clay. See

the last renewal for additional detalision this. case:

Tu connection with the above objective SCANTLING

has performed numerous pretext and neighborhood investigations

for the Station. SCANTLING also does most of the local

investigations requested by ODACID and other ODYOKE

components.

d. SCANTLING spent six weeks during July and

August of this year giving tradecraft and surveillance

training to LIPAILS 5 and 7 from Monterrey. Although

this is not a direct contribution to the above objective, it

is considered sufficiently related to mention here.

In addition to his contributions to the above objectives,

SCANTLING is used for miscellaneous support requirements from the

For example, SCANTLING is now handling LIEMBROIL-2 and

will continue to do so until the return of LIMOTOR-14 in June 1962. Also,

during the past project year, SCANTLING handled the LIRICE surveillance

team until July 1961 when Simon D. CLACKETT (ps) returned to Mexico

City. SCANTLING is also used to spot and rent safe houses and apartments

for other Station operations.

5. As stated in the preceeding Requests for Project Renewal,

although SCANTLING's LIEMPTY Project objectives can never be completely

fulfilled, it is the Station's opinion that SCANTLING has made important and

valuable contributions to LIEMPTY Project objectives specifically and to

other Station activities in general. SCANTLING's production, measured

against monetary expenditures, case officer time and other intangible factors,

unquestionably justifies his continuation as an integral part of Project

LIEMPTY.

B. Raymond H. GERENDE Segment (discussed in relation to project

objectives) :

1. 'To collect operational information pertaining to LIMERICK

personnel and physical facilities through use of photographic base houses. "

Three photographic bases, LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA, contribute

to this objective.

To avoid repetition, the Stafion is omitting the usual

description of the functions of these three bases and now they contribute

to the above objective. There has been no change in the coverage as

described in the 1960 Request for. Project Renewal,

"To collect operational information and identify operational

leads pertaining to Station targets of opportunity." The LIBNTRAP

operation, handled by GERENDE, is still the major contributor to this

Related Mission Directive. The project has not produced any positive

intelligence nor has it been intended that it should do so.

IV.

PROBLEMS

The security problem in connection with the LICALLA operation, which

was described in last year's renewal request,

is still present but has not caused

any known difficulty.

At Headquarters suggestion in HMMW-9736, the LICALLA

base was reacrivated on 29 May 1961. The base operator has been cautioned to be

ever alert for any unusual incidents which might indicate that the base has been

compromised.

This is the only problem experienced by the LIEMPTY Project

during the past project year.

V. PLANS

The Station considers that the project is now operating at its optimum size

and does not plan to expand it during the coming year. Rather, ettorts will be

devoted to refining and better utilizing the existing project organizational

arrangements.

VI. COSTS

Past Project Year - Station finance records indicate that Project LIEMPTY

expended $21, 458.00 during Fiscal Year 1961 (1 December 1960 - 30 June 1961) and

has thus far during Fiscal Year 1962 (through 30 September 1961) expended about

$11,000.00. It Is anticipated that about $8, 000.00 will be expended during the last

two monchs (October and November 1961) of the project year.

This will make a

total expenditure during the project year of about $40, 500.00, or some 512, 500.00

under the budget estimate of $53, 000.00.

Ensuing Period - Of the total $49, 500100 budget, iremized below,

$29, 500. 00 should be expended during the remainder of Fiscal Year 1062 and the

This information is particularly useful in keeping track of

REPRORICTION

LIMERICK personney and assisting with the identification of

visitors to the installation.

Also, LIMITED maintains a

summary attendarice list of LIMERICK employees on a daily

basis; this enables the Station quickly to ascertain the

presence or absence of an employee on any given day.

Finally, one other significant service is performed by this

base, the radio dispatching of the LIEMBRACE surveillance

team on LIMERICK personnel and targets of opportunity.

LIMITED's photographic coverage is still concentrated on

visitors, as opposed to employees, to the LIMERICK

installation. A recent example of the base's contributions to

Station efforts is the case offjoseph Ralph MAURi. In this

case, a LIENVOY lead indicated that an American might visit

the LIMERICK target on a certain day. The base was alerted

to dispatch the radio-controlled surveillance team on any

person appearing to be an American.

The results of this

assignment were indicated in MEXI-6392 and several other

cables. LIVITED was also able to provide photographs,

which when compared with photographs provided by Head-

quarters, left no question as to MAURI's identity.

b. LILYRIC - This base's output of high-quality clandestine

photographs has been in about the same quantity as last year.

In addition, the base operator, LIEMPTY-14, prepares weekly

zeports on LIMERICK employees and their wives.

LILYRIC

also performs the assignment of noting and reporting the

license plate numbers of all cars bringing visitors to the

LIMERICK installation, LILYRIC photographs also are con-

centrated on visitors to the target, as opposad to employees.

i should be noted that LU YRIC operates for ohotographic

coverage during the hours from daylight tò 1400 hours each

day of the week except Sunday. The LIMITED base maintains

photographic coverage trom 1400 hours to darmess each day

espionage effort.

"To collect operational information and identify operational leads

pertaining to Station targets of opportunity." The LIENTRAP operation,

handied by GERENDE, is the major contributor to this objective. It

has been possible for LIENTRAP to take photographs and to perform

pretext investigations in support of numerous Station activities. The

cases listed below are cited as examples:

In the case of Cesar GONZALEZ Sanchez (see I, A, 3, a, above)

LIENTRA? Was able to procure phetographs of GONZALEZ at his

Mexico City residence which,-when compared to Headquarters

provided photographs) left no doubt that CONZALEZ was the

subject of interest to Headquarters.

b. LIENTRAP confirmed the identity of Olga CASTILLO de Ledon,

a frequent visitor to the LIMERICK installation and an ardent

supporter of the present Cuban regime, through a pretext

investigation of the residents of an apart ment building where

CASTILLO was believed to live. Later, LIENTRAP supported the

him an extremely valuable Station asset for such support activities.

GERENDE also procures post office box letter drops for the many

During this project year the LIJERSEY surveillance team under the

efforts through pretext investigations and physical surveillances. Some

examples of the team's work are listed below:

a. Bafael TISCHLER Guzman (201-64372), is a Guatemalan

In view of CLACKETT's resignation,

which was effective 31

August 1960, and the proposed transfer of the LIJERSEY team to

the LITEMPO project, this segment of the LIEMPTY project will

not be renewed. However, for the record, it is considered that

the CLACKEM segment of LIEMPTY was worthwhile and the

expenditure of Station assets in connection with LIJERSEY operations

were justified.

D. Relationship to Related Mission Directive Objectives:

It can readily be noted that Project LIEMPTY has provided support to

inany Station operations and in this manner has been a contributing factor

to the furtherance of the Related Mission Directive. The project has not

produced any positive intelligence nor has it been intended that it should

do so. The project's sole purpose is to provide a mechanism for the

development of operational information in support of other Station

operations.

CHANGES

A. Simon D. CLACKETT

The unexpected resignation Of CLACKETT in August 1960 has

necessitated the decision as how best to utilize the LIJERSEY surveillance

team and still benefit from the training and experience gained by the team

during the past year.

As explained in the LITEMPO project outline, it was

decided that the LITEMPO Staff Agent would have the time, the need and the

requirements to handle and manage the LIJERSEY team on a regular basis;

consequently, the Station believed that such a solution to this problem would

permit the Station to continue to profit from CLACKETT's past efforts.

B. Oliver G. SCANTLING

Since CLACKETT's departure, SCANTLING has been handling the

LUERSEY team as an interim measure pending Headquarters approval of

the LITEMPO project.

SCANTLING has been exposed to, and. likewise

knows, only one of the team members, LIEMPTY-20. SCANTLING is

known to 1-20 only by an alias.

EFFECTIVENESS

General comments pertaining to the value of the project efforts to the

Station's needs - The Station is of the opinion that its operations are only

as good as the support mechanisms backstopping and contributing to them.

The availability of unilateral support agents and organizations, such as

the LIEMPTY Project, to Investigate leads and to collect operational

information is an indispensable ingredient to the Stacion's espionage and

counterespionage objectives.

The Station would be seriously handicapped

in its operational activities should the support services of such agents as

CERENDE, SCANTLING and the agents under their control be suddenly

made unavailable.

B. LIMERICK Target - The basis for most of the Station's counter-

espionage activities directed against the LIMERICK target require detailed

knowledge of the identity, activities and fellow associates of LIMERICK

personnel, The LIEMPTY phorographic basehouses indoubtedly provide

more of this type information than any other Sracion operation.

project provide the Station wick the large majority of LIMERICK leads.

- 9-1:

C. Targets of Opportunity - The immediate availability of independent

assets to periorm investigations,

photographic assignments and other

essentia types of support services in connection with Station targets of

opportunity represent an operational advantage which this Station considers

highly significant.

It is due to such LIEMPTY assets that an agent can be

sent to distant areas in Mexico to do investigations, that photographs can

be made of individuals and places which are of operational interest and

apartments and hotel rooms can be acquired in fictitious names in

support of sensitive operations and activities.

D. Although the progress and success of any support project depends

upon requirements from other Station operations, it must be concluded

that Projeci LIEMPTY has indeed been effective during the past project

PROBLEMS

A, security - The activities of the LICAbba base were suspended in

September 1960 as a direct result of the arrest of three KURIOT

technicians by the Cuban Government. One of the technicians was known

to have knowledge of the four LIMÜST units (LICALLA is located in One

of these units) and the Station considered it appropriate to suspend photo-

graphic operations pending resolution of the situation. At this time,

there is no indication when |LICALLA operations will be resumed. The

LICALLA base operator has reported that there have been no unusual

inquiries or other suspicious actions which might indicate that LICALLA

has been compromised to LIMERICK personnel; however, such a

possibility will exist until the release of the three technicians. No

other security problems have occurred during the past year.

PLANS

A. Processing of Photographs • During the past vear considerabie

progress has been made in the Station's handling, ter, sorting, indexing,

ident lying leads and filing, of photographs produced by the several bases.

B. Photographic Techniques - The previous LIEMPTY Project Renewal

Request. indicated that the Scation planned to try new techniques using

HY-PAN tilm in night photography. HY-PAN film was used on a trial

basis during daylight houes with poor results. Almost invariably, prints

consequently, were of

It should be noted that Eastman Kodak's new TRI-X PAN film, which

all bases and LIENTRAP now use, is superior to any film previously

used by the Station for clandestine photography.

The quality of all

base photographs have been increased considerably as a direct result

of this new film.

C. General Comments - The Station believes that the GERENDE

segment is now operating under optimum organizational arrangments

and there are no plans for expansion contemplated at this time. It is

expected that SCANTLING will soon be relieved of his interim

responsibility for the LIJERSEY team and can concentrate more on his

investigative and casing activities. The transfer of the LIJERSEY team

tO PrOjeCt LITEMPO reduced Project LIEMPTY activities by an

appreciable amount. It is not planned, dur

g the coming year, to

expand present LIEMPTY activities. n

COSTS

A. Past Project Year - Station finance records indicate that Project

LIEMPTY expended $19, 120.91 during Fiscal Year 1960 (l December

1959 - 30 June 1960) and has thus far during Fiscal Year 1961 (through

31 October 1960) expended $16; 734. 69. Contract Agents salaries and

allowances paid by Headquarters bring the total expenditures for 11

months of the project year to approximately $50, 000.00. An additional

$4, 000. 00 will be obligated during the 12th month of the project year.

This will bring total project expenditures to about $54, 000. 00 for the

entire project year.

Ensuing Period - Of the total $53, 000. 00 budget, itemized below,

$31, 900. 00 should be expended during the remainder of Fiscal Year

1961 and the balance, $21, 100. 00, should be expended during Fiscal

Year 1962.

Normal accounting procedures will be used for all

expenditures.

As regards the requirement listed in CSI-F No. 230-60, Annex A, for

communications arrangments in the event of "Emergency Conditions."

the Station does not anticipate that this project would or coutd continue

to function under its present objectives.

However, both principal

agents, SCANTLING and GERENDE, would vermossibly be worthwhile

sources of intormation to maintain contact ma

under any adverse

conditions. Both of these agents identify themselfs, in terms of

ideology, motivation and perspective; more as Americans than as

Mexican nationals (which they are). tis reasonable to assume, there-
