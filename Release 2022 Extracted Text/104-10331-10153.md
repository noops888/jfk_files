agreed to protect true name and 201 file numbers of assets not previously released.
5) Mark Lane Item (extract from foreign documentl:

postponed until 4 June meeting; board would like have a member or its staff confirm the existence of the “
document and ensure that it contains no other JFK assassination related information.

6) Carlos Tepedino [CIA asset! key figure in AMLASH-Cubela plot to kill Castro/true name and role in story has
been publicly known for years}:

voted to release his name in the 1967 1G Report on Plots Against Castro and other JFK collection documents.
The(Stong/Golitsyn issue was pulled from the agencd and will be addressed at the next meeting (4 June).

This was'a very successful meeting from the Agency's perspective. The loss on Tepedino was not unexpected. Given what is
in the public domain, the Agency has not been able to make a persuasive argument to protect his name in the three yéars Tepedino has

been at issue. Thanks to all who assisted in preparing for the meeting, and especially tf Stove Whit, and fick Kinsman)who prepared the

issue and talking point papers that carried the day.
