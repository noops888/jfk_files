COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL (contd)

William M. Kent

Clandestine Service, one of my prime responsibilities is to try to

reestablish the integrity of the current letter evaluations used in

fitness reports and one of the first places for me to start is in my

own Staff.

With that said, I do wish to underscore the fact that Mr. Kent

is a responsible and responsive professional who knows what he has

co do, does it with a minimum of fuss, writes clearly and to the point,

Is dedicated and in my judgment fully warranta an overall evaluatio

prose which enables him to write crisp

with speed and precision, all aid him in carrying out his responsibilities

in a superior manner.

(Several hundred NOC applicants and on-board

personnel have thus been listed by skills bank criteria.)

Subject constantly seeks to make the NOC Branch a more meaningful

and useful management tool.

I find him a thoughtful and canny colleague,

careful to observe in full the regulatory limits of our activity but

quick to perceive opportunities to support and

assist the divisions

within those limits.

He is a firm,

no-nonsense supervisor of

Branch personnel.

He speaks his mind, honestly but tactfully, when

differences occur between him and me.

It is my conviction that he is

ready to enter into the upper reaches of staff and supervisory echelons

of the Directorate and has by now proven that he is as adept at staff

responsibilities

as he was previously impressive in his field and

operational

responsibilities.

In short, a comer and a cherished

colleague.

I became C/CMS on 1 October 1976 and thus my comments must be restricted

narrative comments but do challenge the letter evaluatione. While Mr. Kent's

performance has been strong and he has amply demonstrated he is a GS-15 level

officer capable of assuming greater responsibilities, I cannot concur that his

performance 'is so exceptional to requirements of the work and in comparison of

others doing similar work as to warrant special recognition'. On purely technical

grounds there is no other officer serving as DC/CMS/NOC and thus the comparison

is invalid. Secondly, as Chief, Career Management Staff and administrator of the

COMMENTE OF REVIEWINO OSPICIAL

I am in basic agreement with these comments and with the overall rating of Strong.

Unfortunately, due to the physical separation of my office and that where Mr. Kent

labors, I find it difficult to provide meaningful substantive comments. I have served

as C/CMS only since 1 October 1976 and, while individual branches within CMS are

widely dispersed, I have been lucky in having each managed and run by a senior

experienced officer of supergrade rank. This was true in CMS/NOC and I am more

than willing to accept C/CMS/NOC's evaluation of Mr. Kent. In my own dealings with

Kent, I have found him to be responsive, informed, articulate and an excellent team

player. I am also aware of certain innovations developed by him and implemented

A good, solid officer with additional growth potential.

Section D (continued)

Kent, William M.

healthy skepticism enables him to contribute materially to the

smooth, still

on-going,

transition from the old to the new way.

In this context he has

made invaluable suggestions on how we

shall proceed in order to improve the operational efficacy of

a NOC officer,

as well as to ease the burdens imposed on the

private life of a NOC officer.

3. Worthy of

special note is the systematic and orderly fashion

in which he tackled each new problem.

These attributes resulted

in his solving many of the thorny personnel problems which have

confronted us of late. Mr. Kent's industriousness -- on the

average he spends 10 hours a day in the office -- together with

his legendary meticulousness have enabled him to set up an

effective referral system through which we control the flow-

through of both traditional and new NOC officers -- a most

difficult and at times frustrating task.

As a deputy and acting branch chief he has been a firm

his subordinates.

tempered by a judicious application of human

understanding

or compassion in cases of

"hard-to-place" NOC officers. His

advice in solving many of these cases to the satisfaction of

both the officer and the operational component involved was

most welcome.

In sum, Mr. Kent has been a most effective deputy.

As

noted above,

he has many outstanding traits and his overall

performance has been a solid strong.

1.

Having been appointed

to my present position on 23 May 1977, this

report covers seven months.

In this time I have learned to appreciate

Mr. Kent's excellent performance in supporting and guiding the mission

of this branch.

Considering

the outstanding evaluation he received from

my predecessor,

it must have

been a great disappointment to Mr. Kent

that he was not advanced to become branch chief.

I make this observa-

tion because Mr. Kent has never demonstrated his obvious disappointment

to me.

from the first moment he has shown extraordi-

nary and enthusiastic willingness in providing the needed continuity

to

run this branch which controls the career progression of the NOC officer

complement consisting of between

officers at any given time.

No doubt the reader is aware of the intricate, complicated and at times

confusing bureaucratic machinery which governs the NOC officer program.

Mr. Kent has done a superb job in helping me understand and cope with

this maze.

the creation of the Office of External Development and conco-

mitant issuance of new, precise and explicit regulations we now hope to

streamline and simplify

this bureaucratic machinery. Mr. Kent's

COMMENTA OF REVISMINO OFFICIAL

I have not had the opportunity to observe Mi. Kent's performance as closely as

the rating officer.

However, the rater's comments strike me as being eminently fair

and accurate. Mr. Kent has certainly performed well and his thorough and accurate

presentations have indeed been impressive.

Despite my somewhat limited association

with Mr. Kent, but having full confidence in the rating officer's judgment, I have

no hesitation in concurring in the overall rating of Strong.

It is recommended that Mr. William M. Kent be

Deputy Branch Chief of WH/6 during the tension-filled days

which preceded and followed the Chilean military coup of

The nature of Mr. Kent's service to the

Agency during this period has been described more fully in

his nost recent fitness report, which evaluated his overall

performance as "Outstanding."

Mr. Kent served as Acting Deputy Branch Chief of

WH/6 for five months, from mid-June to mid-November 1973,

while concurrently continuing to direct the large and im-

portant Chilean covert action program with exceptional

competence.

Mr. Kent thus was

handling two

exacting jobs

simultaneously during the entire coup period.

This was a

time of particular tension for the Branch, since developments

in Chile were of international importance

and generated almost

daily requests for special papers and briefings for top U.S.

Government leaders.

Mr. Kent performed at a consistently

high level in both

his SA and managerial capacities: his

propaganda and political action guidance was timely, imagina-

tive and effective, while his managerial decisions as pro-

visional head of

15-man branch reflected sound judgment

an across-the-board foundation in clandestine operations.

VI. Kent was personally responsible for the creation and

implementation of two successful Division programs

the political action and one in the propaganda field • which

have made an important contribution to the achievement of

u.s. policy objectives with regard to Chile.

These programs

are being continued even though Mr. Kent has now left the

Branch to handle an

Subject is a bright young officer who has made an outstanding contribution

to the operations of the Station since his arrival on duty. He is unusually

well motivated and energetic in his work.

he has shown a high degree of

Inagination and intelligence in his direction of KUCAGE operations. He has

handled his agents and other contacts in an exemplary fashion.

The only factor that has had to be discussed with Subject is his need

for greater patience, tact and understanding in his dealings with fellow

workers.

subject has great potential which should not necessarily be limitad to

¡UGAGE type activities. His abilities and attributes are of equal value to

Mr. Kent has been under my supervision and has occupied his present position

of responsibility for propaganda matters for less than four months, but in that

time has demonstrated an unusual ability to provide tragitative, timely and useful

propaganda guidances for covert field use. He 1s very sensitive and perceptive

to the carabilities and limitations of WHD media operations and exploits their

possibilities to the maximum. He has been particularly effective in the exploita-

tion of leads provided by KUTUBE sources as the basis for "black" operations.

In this regard he has shows great initiative, Imagination and professional ability.

Kent regularly makes sound suggestions for Increasing the effectiveness and

security of WHD media operations, and with more time on the job, and an increased

bowledge of specific country operations, he should further improve his ability

to assess and review WHD projects.

This officer 15 admirably sulted for hispresent assignment; he is creative

and an industrious worker, producing quickly and with a minimum of supervision;

his guidances are well written and easily understood; and he has sole responsibility

for bio functional duties as part of a small three-man staff team. He bas a

I agree with the rating of Mr. Kent. He has been energetic,

imaginative and professional in his work. The only thing that I can add

I concur generally in this evaluation. Subject is always on the

lookout for new leade. While in general this is commendable, it

should be noted that his assessments are not in depth. It would be

preferable if he concentrated on a few good prospects, leading to

a solid recruitment, rather than enlarging numerically his stable of

out loud and clear during the discussions that this cover

would allow me to spot, assess and develop targets of interest,

and would allow me to handle recruited agents, but, because

of the high risk involved in the use of a legitimate firm for

cover purposes, I was not to engage in recruitments.

Despite its one limitation, the cover was ideal.

Among other things, I:

a position just vacated by the newly appointed deputy branch chief.

bringing the Peru Desk under his own independent control.

what he likes and does the best, as once more evidenced by a written

commendation he received for this type of work while part of a special

equally noted that the FI and CI aspects of

working directly with him on a variety of sensitive and important activities. In

addition to his highly imaginative yet realistic approach to the problem of Chile,

he amply demonstrated his ability to deal with persons who were out to sell bills

of goods to the Agency. His clear understanding of the role of the Clandestine

Service protected the Agency from disagreeable encounters that might have

resulted in compromises or embarrassments. His forte is clearly. in the field

During the rating period Mrhinent continued to diroct in a highly

effective manner the large-scale covert action program carried out by

the Branch against the Chilean target, including political action

operations, propaganda, economic warfare, black operations and a

militant action group.

Mr. Kent is uniquely qualified for his present

job since he combines an active and imaginative mind with a background

of twenty years of operational experience in the Latin American area.

He also possesses an unusual degree of fluency in the Spanish language.

In addition to directing the Branch's overall covert action

program, Mr. Kent personally handled the majority of the propaganda

effort conducted by the Branch.

He turned in a very strong performance

In originating and coordinating propaganda guidances on the Chilean

situation for use in the Western Hemisphere as well as other areas

such as Europe. He showed a real flair for spotting propaganda

vulnerabilities and then coming up with fresh ideas for the exploitation

of these vulnerabilities. He particularly excelled in staying on

top of fast breaking situations requiring a steady flow of propaganda

guidance.

Mr. Kent also conceived and executed the second phase of an

effective propaganda operation in the economic field which is designed

report covers

approximately five and one half months since I

submitted the last report on Mr. Kent. Unfortunately, and I do mean

unfortunately, it will

be the last fitness report written on Mr. Kent

because he has elected

to retire on 30 June 1978.

Although his retirement was just around the corner, Mr. Kent did

slacken his pace.

On the contrary, in the last four months the NOC

Branch has been

besieged with a myriad

of statistical reports from DDO

management.

Had it not been for the legendary meticulousness of Mr.

Kent, coupled with his excellent tribal memory, the NOC Branch would

been hard-pressed

to come up as promptly and as efficiently with the

figures and facts as was the case.

Much of it Mr. Kent and his staff

accomplish while he was

acting for me while I was on a 4 week TDY.

He definitely excelled

at running the branch during these four weeks.

In closing I would like to say that CIA is losing one of its finest

officers in Mr. Kent.

This may not be the proper vehicle for making

the foilowing statement, but I would like to state nevertheless and with-

out any equivocation whatsoever, that seldom in my career of 31 years

did I receive the kind of support and loyal counsel I received from

Mr. Kent during the past 13 months.

COMMENTA OF REVIEWINO OFFICIAL

There is little to add to the thoughtful and accurate comments of the rating

officer. I share his sense of loss over the retirement of Mr. Kent.

Mr. Kent performed

in an exceptionally able manner throughout the period of time covered by this report.

He was always quick and willing to respond and the results of his labors, without

exception, were of a very high professional order. As indicated, he was of great

It 1s indead un-

stone that tendestine see dee the experted and talent of de. Kent.

However, he reached this decision on his own and, after careful consideration, opted

for early retirement.

I can only wish him well in his new endeavors and hope

that everything works out for him as planned.
