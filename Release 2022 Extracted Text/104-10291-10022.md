COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL (contd) William M. Kent

Clandestine Service, one of my prime responsibilities is to try to
reestablish the integrity of the current letter evaluations used in
fitness reports and one of the first places for me to start is in my
own Staff,

With that said, I do wish to underscore the fact that Mr. Kent
is a responsible and responsive professional who knows what he has
to do, does it with a minimum of fuss, writes clearly and to the point,
is dedicated and in my judgment fully warrants an overall evaluation
of strong, The above comments will be shown to the rater as well
as the ratee,



SECTION D Narrative Comments (Continued)

languages (Spanish and Italian), and his admirable command of English
prose which enables him to write crisp operational communications

witn speed and precision, all aid him in carrying out his responsibilities
in a superior manner.

Subject does not become a victim of routine. in addition to
developing the effective referrals system noted above, he has also
on his own initiative created our own "skills bank" in which we are
able to locate suitable NOC candidates, and those on board, in terms
of needed professional or area experience, rare and esoteric language
skills, etc. to the point that we can supply "leads" to divisions
in a matter of minutes. (Several hundred NOC applicants and on-board
personnel have thus been listed by skills bank criteria.)

Subject constantly seeks to make the NOC Branch a more meaningful
and useful management tool. 1 find him a thoughtful and canny colleague,
careful to observe in full the regulatory limits of our activity but
quick to perceive opportunities to Support and assist the divisions
within those limits, He is a firn, fair, no-nonsense supervisor of
Branch personnel, He speaks his mind, honestly but tactfully, when
differences occur between him and me.’ It is my conviction that he is
ready to enter into the upper reaches of staff and supervisory echelons
of the Directorate and has by now Proven that he is as adept at staff
responsibilities as he was previously impressive in his field and
desk operational responsibilities. In short, a comer and a cherished
colleague,

© in addition to performing most of the
assignments he had been tasked with earlier, His undiminished energy
and enthusiasm for his work is a hall-mark of his performance since
that time. Subject has, on his own initiative, developed our referrals

specific area priority needs) to a point where it is serving the entire
Directorate with distinction and Precision, especially in the "crisis"

to his creation of an orchestrated system of finding and "shopping"

officer capable of assuming greater responsibilities, I cannot concur that his
performance "is so exceptional to requirements of the work and in comparison of
others doing similar work as to warrant special recognitien”, On purely technical

Iam in basic agreement with these comments and with the overall rating of Strong.
Unfortunately, due to the physical separation of my office and that where Mr. Kent
labors, I find it difficult to provide meaningful substantive comments. I have served
as C/CMS only since 1 October 1976 and, while individual branches within CMS are
widely dispersed, I have been lucky in having each managed and run by a senior
experienced officer of supergrade rank. This was true in CMS/NOC md I am more
than willing to accept C/CMS/NOC's evaluation of Mr, Kent. In my own dealings with
Kent, I have found him to be responsive, informed, articulate and an excellent team

1, Having been appointed to my present position on 23 May 1977, this
report covers seven months. In this time I have learned to appreciate
Mr. Kent's excellent performance in supporting and guiding the mission
ef this branch. Considering the outstanding evaluation he received from
my predecessor, it must have been a great disappointment to Mr. Kent
that he was not advanced to become branch chief. I make this observa-
tion because Mr. Kent has never demonstrated his obvious disappointment
to me. On the contrary, from the first moment he has shown extraordi-
nary and enthusiastic willingness in providing the needed continuity to
run this branch which controls the gression of the NOC officer
complement consisting of between officers at any given time,
No doubt the reader is aware of the intricate, complicated and at times
confusing bureaucratic machinery which governs the NOC officer program,
Mr, Kent has done a superb job in helping me understand and cope with
this maze.

2, With the creation of the Office of External Development and conco-
mitant issuance of new, precise and explicit regulations we now hope to
streamline and simplify this bureaucratic machinery. Mr. Kent's
knowledge of past practices coupled with his eagerness and at times

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL

T have not had the opportunity to observe Mr. Kent's performance as closely as
the rating officer. However, the rater’s comments strike me as being eminently fair
and accurate. Mr. Kent has certainly performed vell anid his thorough and accurate
presentations have indeed been impressive. Despite my somewhat limited association
with Mr. Kent, but having full confidence in the rating officer's judgment, 1 have
no hesitation in concurring in the overall rating of Strong.

4, Mr. Kent has a first rate mind, a unique flair
for SA operations, and unusual language capabilities.
During the Chilean crisis period he demonstrated his dedi-
cation to duty, working eleven or twelve hours a day without
complaint, and his ability to make effective use of his
exceptional professional talents and experience while
simultaneously exercising sound judgment and leadership in
his management of Branch affairs.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chairman, QSI Honor and Merit Award Panel

SUBJECT: Request for QSI:
William M. Kent, GS-14

1. It is recommended that Mr. William M. Kent be
granted a Quality Step Increase in recognition of his out-
Standing performance as Chief of the SA Section and Acting
Deputy Branch Chief of WH/6 during the tension-filled days
which preceded and followed the Chilean military coup of
11 September 1973. The nature of Mr. Kent's service to the
Agency during this period has been described more fully in
his most recent fitness report, which evaluated his overall
performance as "Outstanding."

2. Mr. Kent served as Acting Deputy Branch Chief of
WH/6 for five months, from mid-June to mid-November 1973,
while concurrently continuing to direct the large and im-
portant Chilean covert action program with exceptional
Competence. Mr. Kent thus was handling two exacting jobs
simultaneously during the entire coup period. This was a
time of particular tension for the Branch, since developments
in Chile were of international importance and generated almost
daily requests for special papers and briefings for top U.S.
Government leaders. Mr. Kent performed at a consistently
high tevel in both his SA and managerial capacities: his
propaganda and political action guidance was timely, imagina-
tive and effective, while his Managerial decisions as pro-
visional head of a 15-man branch reflected sound judgment
and an across-the-board foundation in clandestine operations.

3. A self-reliant and bachoe? Spear paae talented SA officer,
Mr. Kent was personally responsible for the creation and
implementation of two successful Division Programs -- one in
the political action and one in the propaganda field -- which
have made an important contribution to the achievement of

U.S. policy objectives with regard to Chile. These programs
are being continued even though Mr. Kent has now left the
Branch to handle an exacting new staff assignment.

SUBJECT: Commendation of Mr. William Kent
——— as

During the last five montha I have turned to Mr. Kent
on two occasions to help the Latin America Division in
Connection with Senate Select Committee's investigation
of covert action in Chile. When confronted with a need
to produce a paper on Chile {n a short timeframe, 1
instinctively turned to hin. It was not only because he
had expertise on Chile, due to service in the Chile Branch,
but because he is highly skilled in written presentation.
He organizes hi aterial well and presents it in « lucid,
On the first occasion, he belped
us prepare a paper that was eventually ua by the Director
in his presentation before the Se @ Select Counittee on
14-15 July. on the cond occ: on his contribution was
used by the DDO in 8 appearance before the Senate Select
Committee on 28 October. Both of these papers vera
excellent and have withstoood critical scrotiny,

Aside from Mr. Kenr's ability to write I would like
to take this occasion to record my overall high esteen
@ professional and as a Person. I have
always considered him to be one of our wore able and pro-
mising officers. His dedication is exemplary; he has spent
untold extra hours of his time carrying out his duties. He
has good Judgment and conmon sense. Mr. Kent has a very
attractive personality aad excellent personal presence,
Fron all standpodats he is an excellent officer that deserves
to move ahead in the organization. I aa convinced he has the
ability aud potential to do so.

Great deal of enthusiasm and interest in his
aspects performs his duties in a ghly professional manner,
I do not, hovever, for reasons s: ited below, believe that
his over all rating should be higher than 4+.

While it is true that he deaonstrates considerable
imagination and energy, he is headstrong and develops
prejudices that prevent hin on occasions from being objective
in handling operations. This in gy opinion is dus to his
youth and lack of experience in dealing with a particular
situation of the kind vith which he is now faced. This is
by no means meant to be a reflection on his qualifications
or future potential,

I emphatically disagree with the last sentence of Section
E for the reasons set out above. He should not be, at the
Present time, given greater individual responsibility but
rather should be subject te close, strong supervision of a

ction, Manner of performance of managerial or supervisory duties must be described, if

During the approximately six months of Mr. Kent's association
with WH/5, the Branch CA effort was almost exclusively concentrated
on a special operation with which Mr. Kent was not directly concerned.
His jigned task was to act as Headquarters case officer for those
CA projects not directly involved in the special project and for
peripheral aspects of some which were. He performed his assigned
duties competently and demonstrated that in the graphic aspects of
CA work he has few peers.

At the same time, Mr. Kent did not show any large measure of
initiative in developing those projects assigned to him, and seemed
to treat his assignment as 2 temporary one (as indeed it turned out
to be) to which he was not fully committed and in which he was -not
overly interested.

Mr. Kent is a pleasant and cooperative officer who doubtless
can perform capably in # position with supervisory responsibilit: ey
although his duties with WH/5 gave him no opportunity to demonstrate
his competence in this area. | :

In this regard he has shown great initiative, imagination and

hie guidances are vell written and easily understood; and he has sole responsibility
for his finctional duties as Part of a small three-man start team. He has a

Mr. Kent has sustained the same high degree of competence, imagina-
tion and conscientious application to his duties noted in the last fit-
ness report. He is unusually well qualified for his present job by
reason of experience, knowledge and sensitivity to the Latin American
culture and mentality. Although he is a person of strong convictions,
not always tactfully expresse: » it is to his credit that he has adapted
to the role of a staff officer with admirable self-restraint and self-
discipline.

Were it not for the fact that Mr. Kent cannot accept a permanent
overseas assignment at this time for family medical Yeasons, he should
now be considered for assignment to a senior position at a country desk
preparatory to a Field Station assignment. Under these circumstances,
Mr. Kent is making a valuable, perhaps even indispensable, contribution
to the covert action mission of WHD and should remain in his present
position for the immediate future,

No further training is recommended at this time. He completed the
Midcareer Executive Development Course No. 4 during the reporting perios
Mr. Kent has no Supervisory functions in his present position,

but he appears to be capable of performing such duties. His security
record is excellent and his cost consciousness is good.

Mr. Kent is indeed a professional in his fiel@)| amexpert in
propaganda operations which require area knowledge, technical
know-how, and imagination. In a specialty where it is only too
easy to go off the deep end, Mr. Kent has always kept his wits
about him and avoided parochialism. He is a lucid writer who
focus#es on the essential. By nature, Mr. Kent is an impatient man
who has certain biases which sometimes get into the way of his
operational judgements. He is keenly aware of this and his efforts
to remain as "uninvolved" as possible are commendable. In summry’,
Mr. Kent is a "doer" who in his field contributes much.

Mr. Kent has no supervisery duties to perform. He is highly
cost conscious. ..

1 Fence cet who wa Staff Employee up to the time of
his conversion to Staff =. in July of this year, has been
connected with the Latin: lerican scene since he joined the
Agency in 1951. Even before that time he had lived in some
Central American countries. Thus, it is not surprising that
he brought to his assignments a thorough knowledge of the
social, economic, and political currents throughout the WH
Division area, i

2, In handling many tasks at variou; 1s of responsibility
and different locations, one facet of erformance
has always been outstanding: he has an untsu ability to apply
his imagination toward realistic and useful operations. To be
specific: on occasion of the discovery of a Cuban arms cache .
in November 1963, of the January 1964 riots in Panama, of the

April 1965 revolution in the Dominican Republic, and of many

other, nd situations which have developed in the WH

the Division for the initiation and coordination of covert action
efforts to support U.S. (and Agency) objectives, In his last
assignment prior to assuming his duties under nonofficial cover,

assignment is and some others in the past were i a a. ofa

SECTION C NARRATIVE COMMENTS (Continued)

Subject devised a first-class cover relationship with the
priority (REDTOP) target of this Base, For a period the relation-
ship was close, and in our judgment it was wholly unsuspicious
because Subject made it seem so natural. This was a very delicate
operation which Subject handled with distinction.

Personal characteristics of this officer which should not
be overlooked in this review are loyalty, responsiveness, willing-
ness to accept any direction.

In conclusion I want to emphasize my conviction that this
officer's assigneents should be limited to the area for which
he was trained and in which he feels confident: Latin America.

This officer is reasonably cost-conscious. I have had no

opportunity to dwerve his capability for supervising other case
officers.

This officer to some extent has been a victim of his assignment.
His undergraduate training in Latin American affairs was thorough and
extensive. His employment with RVROCK for the next 16 years was
Latin-oriented. His Spanish language is rated "native". Yet during
the period under review he was diverted from Latin-American affairs
toward a variety of higher priority targets. This re-orientation
was not uniformly successful, and should not be continued, because
Subject seems to have no natural interest in foreign nationals (with
the apparent exception of Latin Americans) and in most foreign affairs
(with the exception of Latin American affairs).

ceded to complete

Subject's strongest characteristic is his ability to live and
to utilize his comercial cover. He showed great aptitude and
commendable imagination in devising new modes of comercial access
to foreign nationals residing in Washington. Yor example his use
of his cover was the matrix of several successful recruitments for
which other case officers received the ultimate credit, even though
the recruitments were based on this officer's discovery of the
potential agents and his initial development of them before they
were transferred. Conversely, when Subject retained the contacts
through the development phase, the contacts languished.

MEMORANDUM FOR:

SUBJECT : Responsibilities During Assignment to
DO/Washington Base (re Fitness Report Jan 69 = Jan. '70)

with DO Personnel and CCS. Eventually me up with
as a legitimate

would provide me with the needed cover. It came
out loud and clear during the discussions that this cover
would allow me to spot, assess and develop targets of interest,
and would allow me to handle recruited agents, but, because
of the high risk involved in the use of a legitimate firm for
cover purposes, I was not to engage in recruitments.

2. Despite its one limitation, the cover was ideal.
Among other things, I:

a, Handled a recruited washington; 2oesened

b. Handled a recruited code clerk assigned to one
of the embassies in Washington;

c. Contacted and assessed a high official of the
Soviet Embassy, made arrangements to have him met by
another Base Case Officer under alias who continued
the development which eventually was to lead to a re-
cruitment pitch;

Pakistani Embassy ;

h. Made contact, developed and turned over to
another case officer under alias a who
was subsequently recruited and was é sent te India
to work on the Chicom target.

i. Maintained my cover in a manner which was
completely devoid of suspicion during the entire period
I used it.

3. When the Base moved to its new offices in Washington,
the COB gave me my instructions. He told me that I should
avoid making or maintaining contacts in the Church and Latin
American communities in Washington; that I was not being
assigned any geographical area on which to concentrate but
would be expected to use my judgment, seek out persons who
might be of interest, and take advantage of opportunities
which might arise; that I would be given recruited agents to
handle as the need arose; that, per the limitation concerning
my cover, I was not to engage in actual recruitments, but
was to spot, assess, and develop persons of possible interest
who would be turned over to other case officers under alias
for further development and recruitment,

Mr. Kent came to this branch from a non-official cover job which

had little in common with the duties of a country desk chief. More-
over, he found himself in the sometimes: difficult situation of taking
over a position just vacated by the newly appointed deputy branch chief,
Despite these, to him, minor obstacles, he called upon his close
association with Latin American affairs for many years, his wealth of
experience on WH country desks, and his inherent ability to deal suc-
cessfully with people and situations in asserting leadership and quickly
bringing the Peru Desk under his own independent control.

During the year that Mr, Kent served as Peru Desk Chief he domon-
strated conclusively that he is equally talented in all fields of
clandestine activity. There islittle question that Covert Action is
what he likes and does the best, as once more evidenced by a written
commendation he received for this type of work while part of a special
WH task force in September and October 1970; however, it should be
equally noted that the FI and CI aspects of his job on the Peru Desk
also received full interest and attention during his tenure. He is a
good personnel manager and maintaired high morale in his unit while
working it hard and demanding high standards, He is not at all afraid
of responsibility, he meets all deadlines without prompting,

COMMENTS OF WEVIEWING OFFICIAL

I have little to add to this comprchensive narrative with which I
fully agree. 1, too, have worked very closely with Bill for most of
the period under review, which witnessed rather hectic days in the life
of the Lima Station: it was comforting to be able to rely on his keen
perception of latent trouble, clear analysis of events, and sound and/or
imaginative, as the case demanded, proposals for approaching problems.
Because he has the potential for career advancement, I would strongly
recommend that he be soon transferred back to a “lime” position, again
with managerial responsibilities.

Mr. Kent has competently directed the covert action activities
of Branch 6 since being named Chief of the CA Section for the Branch
in December 1970. He was selected for this position because of
his aggressiveness in the CA field and especially because of his
years of experience and success in the propaganda activity. In
closely monitoring the actions of the Allende Government (GOC) Mr.
Kent lived up to his reputation and demonstrated his unique ability
to recognize propaganda vulnerabilities and to attack them with
effective and imaginative propaganda guidance,

04 ?Ypuring his brief tour in the Branch Mr, Kent developed one
economic warfare operation against the GOC which shows indications
of partially satisfying the USG objective of discouraging foreign
investment in Chile,

Mr. Kent is fluent in the Spanish language and on at least
two occasions he has proven himself as a translator for two meetings
between senior officials of the USG and Latin American officials.

In my capacity as Branch Chief during the period January to April 1971,
Lhad ample opportunity to observe the work of Mr. Kent and had the pleasure of
working directly with him on a variety of sensitive and important activities. In
addition to his highly imaginative yet realistic approach to the problem of Chile,
he amply demonstrated his ability to deal with persons who were out to sell bills
of goods to the Agency. His clear understanding of the role of the Clandestine
Service protected the Agency from disagreeable encounters that might have
resulted in compromises or embarrassments, His forte is clearly in the field
of public relations and propaganda well-adjusted to the role of the Clandestine

phase of this operation were highly favorable and the initial reactions
to the second phase have also been very favorable.

It should be noted that during this period Mr, Kent served for
three months as the Acting Deputy Branch Chief, including two weeks
when he was the Acting Branch Chief, In both of these positions
he performed very capably, showing excellent judgment and managerial
abilities in handling Branch-level matters. He showed similar
managerial ability in his handling of the two officers and secretary
in his Section throughout the rating period. He has consistently
shown a high degree of cost consciousness in all phases of his work.

Mr. Kent displayed his talent for dealing with non-Agency
Personnel at a meeting of publishers from all over the hemisphere
held during the latter part of 1971. At this meeting he skillfully
handled several key Latin American assets with the result that
some of the Agency's objectives for influencing the meeting were
achieved under difficult circumstances.

In sum, Mr, Kent made a notable contribution to the Branch's
efforts in 1971 and we are looking forward with pleasure to working

During the rating period wrlident Leathe to direct in a highly
effective manner the large-scale covert action program carried out by
the Branch against the Chilean target, including political action
operations, propaganda, economic warfare, black operations and a
militant action group. Mr. Kent is uniquely qualified for his present
job since he combines an active and imaginative mind with a background
of twenty years of operational experience in the Latin American area.
He also possesses an unusual degree of fluency in the Spanish language,

In addition to directing the Branch's overall covert action
program, Mr. Kent personally handled the majority of the propaganda
effort conducted by the Branch. He turned in a very strong performance
in originating and coordinating propaganda guidances on the Chilean
situation for use in the Western Hemisphere as well as other areas
such as Europe. He showed a real flair for spotting propaganda
vulnerabilities and then coming up with fresh ideas for the exploitatio!
of these vulnerabilities. He particularly excelled in staying on
top of fast breaking situations requiring a steady flow of propaganda
guidance.

Mr. Kent also conceived and executed the second phase of an
effective propaganda operation in the economic field which is designed

There is little that I can add to this performance rating and
narrative comments. I agree with the rating officer's judgment.
Mr. Kent is a self-starter with a very imaginative mind, I have
closely observed his work on an effective propaganda operation in
the economic field and found it highly successful and effective.
His tenure as Acting Deputy Branch Chief left nothing to be
desired, I was also personally associated with him at the hemi-
sphere-wide publishers' meeting in late 1971. His professional
conduct and good judgment during this meeting undoubtedly was

During the past year Mr. Kent continued to direct the CA
Section of the Chile Branch in the same highly effective manner
noted in the previous fitness report. In this position he was
responsible for directing the Headquarters support for WH Division's
largest and most active covert action program, This program is
generally credited with having achieved a number of successes during
the past year in a wide variety of activities against the Chilean
target.

Mr. Kent possesses an unusual combination of talent, language
capability and experience that makes him one of the top CA officers
in the Division. He is particularly effective in conducting propa-
ganda work and his imaginative exploitation of the Chilean situation
has been superb. As a result of his efforts, the Branch has been
able to conduct a continuous and effective hemisphere-wide propa-
ganda campaign against the Allende government during the past year.
In addition, he has brought in key European stations to assist in
this program on numerous occasions.

Among the mors significant contributions made by Mr. Kent have
been his activities in the economic field. He has successfully
carried out a mmber of operations designed to damage the Allende

I concur with this evaluation, Subject's ability in the propaganda

field particularly is exceptional. Blessed with a fertile imagination,
he has an uncanny talont for coming up with an appropriate CA remedy

to almost any problem. His knowledge and experience in the CA field

is wide and deep, making him undoubtedly one of the best officers in
this speciality in the Agency. The Branch is indeed fortunate to

have his services.

capacity for working as a team member.

While the Outstanding rating necessarily must be assigned spar-
ingly, I believe it fs merited in this case. Mr. Kent did areally
the tension-filled days leading to the Chilean coup.
e and intellectual abilities place him among the top
cers in the Division and probably in the Agency.

As far as future assignments are concerned, I believe Mr. Kent
is best qualified by experience and personal inclination to handle
staff Jobs calling for a jarge measure of political and economic
astuteness. The new job he {s taking over in the economic section

of WH Division will test his talents, but I believe he has the growth
potential to rise to positions of even greater responsibility.

operational experience. His ingenuity, originality and flare

are balanced by sound common sense and enriched by his sense of
humor and personal modesty. Mr. Kent was personally responsible
for the creation and implementation of two important Division
Programs - one in the political action field and the other in

the propaganda field, which were designed to influence foreign
attitudes toward the Allende Government and to dissuade foreign }
governments from providing economic assistance to Chile. These Hl
Programs were highly successful, and since the same techniques
can be applied in support of the new Chilean military government,
the programs are being retained and hopefully will continue to
produce results which make an important contribution to the
achievement of U.S. policy objectives.

Mr. Kent continued to supervise the SA Section in the same
highly effective manner noted in previous efficiency reports.
He also continued to meet and handle several key Chilean

He put in ‘ivung nours, working eleven or twelve hours a day during
crisis periods.

Mr. Kent's transfer to the economic section of WH Division
will enable him to make fuller use of his talents in the
Specialized and important field of economic intelligence, in
which he has a particular interest. It is, however, a severe
loss to the Branch, which has benefited immeasurably from his
imaginative yet level-headed approach to operational problems
and challenges. He is much liked as well as respected by
Branch 6 personnel and has contributed greatly toward main-
taining the high morale and effectiveness of the Branch as
a whole,

Mr. Kent has also served as the field representative for
a Latin America Division funding and cover mechanism. Mr.
Kent's past service in a nonofficial cover status has well
qualified him for his present Headquarters assignment at
a time when nonofficial cover is taking on even greater
Significance in Agency operational planning.

c. Personal characteristics and qualifications.
In fulfilling his various responsibilities, Mr. Kent has
demonstrated that he is imaginative, perceptive, energetic,
and a person of sound, independent judgment. He is extreme-
ly versatile and has a first-rate mind. Invariably, when
a crisis situation arose and talent had to be mobilized with-
in the Division, Mr. Kent was one of the first officers
whose name came to mind. He writes quickly and with a
polished style. During the past year, he was called upon
on two occasions to draft papers concerning Agency involve-
ment in Chile which were used by the Director and the Deputy
Director for Operations in their presentations before the
Senate Select Committee. Mr, Kent speaks and writes fluent
Spanish in addition to speaking very good Italian and some
French.

2. Mr. Kent meets all of the generat and specific
criteria for promotion within his category. He has a total
of 24 years of Agency service, of which 23 years have been
involved with o He has served overseas tours in

and in addition to his domestic assign-
ments in New Orleans, Miami, and Washington, D.C. He has
successfully developed and managed new programs in the
Covert Action and the Nonofficial Cover fields in which he
is presently engaged. Mr. Kent is a man of enormous
energy who is cager to take on challenging assignments. He
has yet to reach his peak within the Agency. Mr. Kent has
demonstrated that he is an effective supervisor, having
served as Desk Chief, Acting Branch Chief, and Section Chief.

3, Mr. Kent is entering into competition for promo-
tion carrying the strong recommendation of this Division
as well as that of CMG/NOC. His rotational tour with the
Nonofficial Cover Branch will end in July 1977. Because of
family medical reasons, Mr. Kent is presently subject to a
medical hold. Upon completion of his tour with CMG/NOC,
he will return to the Latin America Division with a
projected assignment in a senior staff position.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chairman, GS-14 Evaluation Board

SUBJECT : Recommendation for Promotion to
Grade GS-15, William M. Kent

1. This memorandum recommends the promotion of
Mr. William M. Kent from GS-14 to GS-15. Mr. Kent is a
46-year old Operations Specialist who has been in grade
since December 1968.

a. Performance in current grade. During the
seven years that Mr. kent has been in grade, he has served
as a case officer assigned to the Washington Base of the
Foreign Resources Division and, in the Latin America
Division, as Chief of the Peruvian Desk, Chief of Covert
Action activities for the Chile Branch, and Deputy Special
Assistant in the Economic Intelligence Collection and
Cperations Staff. Since Augi 1974, Mr. Kent has been
serving on a rotational tour with the Nonofficial Cover
Branch of the Career Management Group (CMG/NOC), Mr. Kent
has occupied a series of increasingly important positions
since his assignment to Headquarters in 1970. During his
tenure in the Chile Branch he was personally responsible
for developing two important programs -- one in the political
action field and the other in the propaganda field -- which
were designed to influence foreign attitudes towards the
Allende regime in Chile. These programs were highly suc-
cessful. He received overall Outstanding ratings in his
Fitness Reports for the period 1972-73 and for his work
with CMG/NOC in 1975. Mr. Kent received a Quality Step
Increase in 1974,

b. Potential. Throughout his Agency career Mr.
Kent has demonstrated that he can assume broader and in-
creased responsibilities and perform effectively in
chailenging situations. His special strengths lie in the
Covert Action and Nonofficial Cover ficlds. He has distin-
guished himself in his ability to apply imaginative solu-
tions to operational problems involving Covert Action. In
particular, he is noted for his work in exploiting the dis-
covery of the Cuban arms cache in Venezuela in 1963, and
to support U ions during the January 1964 riots in
Panama and the April 1964 revolt in the Dominican Pepubli

3. ‘The above has been accomplished in addition to Kent's
initially assigned responsibilities for close support of the
NOC programs of two very active divisions, Latin America and
Africa, This task calls for experienced and tactful direct
cooperation with the NOC referents and senior operations
officers in the divisions concerned. Ordinarily, such area
division NOC responsibility would be a full-time job for an
officer of this Branch. Kent handles this assigament, as well
as his development of the referrals program, with dispatch and
poise.

Kent's recent fitness reports will indicate his out-
standing qualities. They include an enormous and enthusiastic
Capacity for work, a fine and precise writing ability, a
genuinely rare imagination and a willingness to move far beyond
the daily work requirements to get his job done, or to increase

the value of his assigned task. This officer is constantly on
the move to devise new and cfiective means of enhancing the
nonofficial cover program. fe has proven a patient and
sympathetic guidance counsellor for numbers of officers either

in the NOC program or those interested in it. It is to his
credit primarily that we have created the referrals system

which not only coordinates the reassignment of NOC personnel
across division lines to appropriate new areas and opportunities,
but also serves as a central clearing house fur personalities

who indicate interest in working for CIA in an non-staff capacity.

5. Kent's primary area of operational experience has been
Latin America, including years of NOC officer status. A look

at his file reveals over a half ¢ n commendations for unusual
service and initiative. Linguistically he speaks native Spanish,
very good Italian and some French. He has a supervisory ability
far above the average, and has a highly developed diplomatic
skill in his pursuit 5£ new operational and staff goals which
Ras stood him well on countless occasions. fe is a harmonious
and cooperative work colleague. Clearly he is a most unusual
operations officer who has mastered staff skills and abilities
to the point where he is capable of taking on a wide spectrum of
future Lield or Headquarters assignments



23 December 1975

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chiev, Career Management Group

VIA : Chief, Latin America Division

SUBJECT t Mr. William M. Kent, Recommendation for Promotion

1, Mr. Kent has been on a rotational assignment to the
Nonofficial Cover Branch from Latin America Division since
August 1974. From the outset, he has displayed a most
impressive ability to switch gears from his natural operation
initiatives and to focus that initiative into his staff
officer role. His rapid absorption of management and personnel
principles and problems, with especial emphasis on the non-
official cover program of the Directorate, has been remarkable
even in an officer with his experience.

2. Specifically, Kent's innovative and imaginative drive
has, in a relatively short period of time, enabled the Branch
to create a NOC referrals section headed by him, in which he
has becone a principal DDO coordinator for hundreds of leads
involving job applicants which are derived from letters written
to the Agency, from our field recruiters, from the CT program,
ur management skills bank, and other sources. ile has created,
in his development of this referrals systen, a language and job
kills record of available applicants who do not fit any specific
Agency criterion such as the Career Trainee progr Under his
guidance, referrals files are prepared on specitic applicants
and are forwarded to all DDO components which he knows would be
interested in the specific candidate, He handles all replies
cations of interest, and arranges that candidates of
interest are cleared, contacted, interviewed, and assessed.
jiten ne handles the contacting, interviewing and assessment
self. In its first full year of operation, his referrals
sisted in placing impressive candidates in a variety

23 December 1975

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chiev, Career Management Group

VIA : Chief, Latin America Division

SUBJECT t Mr. William M. Kent, Recommendation for Promotion

1, Mr. Kent has been on a rotational assignment to the
Nonofficial Cover Branch from Latin America Division since
August 1974. From the outset, he has displayed a most
impressive ability to switch gears from his natural operation
initiatives and to focus that initiative into his staff
officer role. His rapid absorption of management and personnel
principles and problems, with especial emphasis on the non-
official cover program of the Directorate, has been remarkable
even in an officer with his experience.

2. Specifically, Kent's innovative and imaginative drive
has, in a relatively short period of time, enabled the Branch
to create a NOC referrals section headed by him, in which he
has becone a principal DDO coordinator for hundreds of leads
involving job applicants which are derived from letters written
to the Agency, from our field recruiters, from the CT program,
ur management skills bank, and other sources. ile has created,
in his development of this referrals systen, a language and job
kills record of available applicants who do not fit any specific
Agency criterion such as the Career Trainee progr Under his
guidance, referrals files are prepared on specitic applicants
and are forwarded to all DDO components which he knows would be
interested in the specific candidate, He handles all replies
cations of interest, and arranges that candidates of
interest are cleared, contacted, interviewed, and assessed.
jiten ne handles the contacting, interviewing and assessment
self. In its first full year of operation, his referrals
sisted in placing impressive candidates in a variety
ments.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Commendation of Mr. William Kear

Duriag the last five mouths I have turned to Mr. Keat
on two occasions to help the Latin Americe Division in
connection with Senate Select Committee's investigation

of covert action in Chile. When confronted with a need

to produce a paper on Chile in a short timeframe, I
inetinctively turned to him. It was not only becau he
bad expertise on Chile, due to rvice in the Chile Branch,
but because he is bighly skilled in written presentation
He organizes bis material well and presents it in 6 lucid,
highly readable manner, On the first occasion, he helped
ue prepare a paper that was eventual)y used by the Director
in big presentation before the Senate Select Comaittae on
14-15 July. On the second occasion hia contribution vw.

used by the DDO in his appearance before the Senate Select
Committee on 28 October. Both of these papers were
excellent and have withstoood critical scrutiny.

Aside from Mx. Kent's ability to write I vould like
tortake this occasion to record my overall high esteen

for Mr, Keat aa a professional and ao a persen. I have
alvaya considered him to be one of our more able and pro-
mieing officers. His dedication 1s exemplary; he has spent
untold extra hours of his time carrying out his duties. He
has good judgment and common sense. Mr. Keot has a very
attractive personality and excellant personal presacc

¥rom all standpointa be {s an excellent officer that deserves
to move ahead in the organization, I am convinced he has the
abilicy and potential to do so.

UWeine “I ew wplewe

L be. crrevetpenerne StafS@@Mligsince July 1966, has
been involved in Latin American area activities since coming with

the Agency in 1951, Over the years he has developed an unusually
thorough understanding of the political, social and economic realities
of the area built on residence there before and after his entrance
into the Agency. His fluency in Spanish has complimented this area
knowledge and contributed to the superior performance which has
characterized his work for this Division over the years.

2, The ability to apply imaginative solutions to oper ‘oblems
in the CA field has been outstandingly demonstrated by Iam
during numerous crises in the area. On the occasion of the discovery
of the Cuban arms cache in November 1963, the January 1964 riots in
Panama, the April 1965 revolution in the ni yublic, and
numerous other smaller crises situations, showed a
high degree of initiative and professional competence in developing and

coordinating covert action ¢ in Support of Agency objectives,
Prior to becoming a Staff s Constructive analyses
of the Division's covert action activities have made a significant contei-

bution to the development of a more effective operational program. In
his present unofficial cover assignment he has continued to demonstrate
a typically energetic, imaginative and enthusiastic operational approach,
His current assignment is, and others in the past were, at the level of
GS-14 and his promotion to GS-I4 is strongly recommended by this

Division,
