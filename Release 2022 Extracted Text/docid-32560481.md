W. HOLMES that he understood that BRUNO was still in Florida. He

said that he understands that PHILIP TESTA, mentioned above, is

quite concerned about the FBI having contacted him.

He also advised that FRANK FORTE,, Philadelphia Police

Department No. 29927, and JAMES GATTI, Philadelphia Police Department

No. 87357, who are often referred to as being "BRUNO's Boys,"

actually work for JOE RUGNETTA, mentioned above, who in his opinion,

is higher up with the Greasers than BRUNO.

T-11 also advised that RALPH MARANCA, mentioned above, is,

he believes, still in the alcohol racket and supposedly works for

BRUNO but he could not verify this.

On March 6, 1958, Confidential Informant I-5 said he had

heard that ANGELO BRUNO was in Miami, Fla.,

and had recently entered

an unknown hospital in that city, where it was necessary for him

to receive two blood transfusions in connection with an illness, the

nature of which was not known to informant.

I-5 said he had heard this information from BOBBY (LNU),

who allegedly knows BRUNO.

He related BOBBY complained

to him

that BRUNO formerly hung at the taproom at 15th and Morris Streets,

which resulted in the place being closely scrutiniged by the

Philadelphia Police Department.

T-5 stated he would attempt to

ascertain the correct name of BOBBY (LNU) â€¢

T-5 further stated that it is his opinion that BRUNO is

subservient to FELIX DE TULLIO, wa., "Skinny Razor." He based his

opinion on the following-described incident which was told him by

AUGUSTINE MAZZIO, wa., Gus, Philadelphia Police Department No. 272611,

who is a partner of CHARIES VENEZIATE in the operation of a still.

In approximately 1953 or 1954 PETER CASELLA,

to dissolve their interest in the Ticket Grill, 13th and Wharton

Streets, Philadelphia.

BRUNO brought a prospective buyer to the

Ticket Grill. This prospective buyer, BRUNO, and EZZI in discussing

the price being asked for the grill had a heated argument with

IEZZI telling BRUNO "Do me a favor, keep the

out of here."

IEZZI then went to FELIX DE TULLIO, wa.,

"Skinny Razor," and

told him of the argument. DE TULLIO told IEZZI

not to worry about it. Approximately a week after the argument,

BRUNO called DE TULLIO and told him about the argument. DE TULLIO

supposedly told BRUNO at this time that whoever was at fault made

no difference because "FREDDY is my partner."

ALFRED IEZZI, commonly

known as FREDDY, has been identified by T-5 as having part interest

in the Television Bar at 8th and Washington Streets, Philadelphia,

with DE

TULLIO.

Approximately a week after BRUNO contacted DE TULLIO, GUS

MAZZIO, FREDDY IEZZI, and DE TULLIO were standing outside of the

Television Bar when BRUNO drove by and did not speak.

This apparently

alarmed FREDDY because he said to DE TULLIO "Look, there goes BRUNO

and he didn't even speak."

SKINNY said in effect

"Who cares."

I-5 also stated that within the last two month period,

MAZZIO told him about driving DE TULLIO's car in New Jersey. MAZZIO

told him OLIVETO was in the back seat being chauffered, and; according

to I-5, this indicates that OLIVETO is a leader in the Greaser Gang.

I-5 said that OLIVETO took over the position formerly held by MARCO

ROGINELLI.. He also stated that OLIVETO was kidding SKINNY and was

not kidded back; therefore, this is some indication that DE TULLIO

is of lower. rank than OLIVETO.

T-3 said that people contact

DE TULLIO to have matters straightened out and that he always

advises these persons that he will let them know in two or three

days,

indicating that he has to go to a higher authority to obtain

a decision.

T-5 believes that OLIVETO rules on decisions which would

pertain to illegal actions on the part of the Greaser Gang.

Investigation reflects as set out above that BRUNO is

asociated with other Philadelphia members of the so-called "Greaser

Mob" who are MICHAEL MAGGIO, DOMINICKPOLLING, JOE, RUGNETTA, FELIX

On April 10, 1958, the Philadelphia Police Department

arrested ANTHONY PROVENZANO, Philadelphia Police Department No. 288255,

and NICHOLAS RUSSO, Philadelphia Police Department No. 213145, in

possession of approximately 100,000 numbers plays. It appears that

these men are possibly pick-up men for the BRUNO faction due to

the location of the arrest on South 8th Street, Philadelphia.

There is

a possibility, however, that these men could be employed by another

numbers bank in the South Philadelphia area.

At the hearing on the above, these men were represented by

Attorney GARFIELD LEVY and were held under $200.00 bail for. court.

DAVID MALONE, former Philadelphia Police Department Detective

CARL C. CIPRIANI, Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Division, Treasury

Department, advised SA ROBERT W. HOLES on January 25, 1957, that he

had learned that contrary to general beliel, BRUNO IS

not the top man

in the Greaser Gang but is considered only a trigger man. BRUNO

is ranked below JOSEPH RUGNETTA and PETER CASELLA.

CIPRIANI said

these two men can order an'execution which BRUNO cannot do. CIPRIANI

said that BRUNO allegedly killed WARSHALL (MUTT) VENEZIALE, whose

body was found in the trunk of his car on a South Philadelphia street

in about 1954. He said VENEZIALE was suspected of being an informant

for Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Division because in 18 years of bootlegging

Money Lending

On January 20, 1958, Confidential Informant I-hi, who has

known BRUNO for a long period of time, said that he is extremely

wealthy. He said BRUNO is active in lending money, not in small

amounts as a loan shark, but he specializes in lending large amounts

of money to racketeers who have more income.

Informant said that

BRUNO was reported to have made some very big loans to various members

of the "Jewish Nob" and bankrolled them in many of their activities.

By way of background generally, the informant said that

"these people" referring to the various racketeers, are generally

distrustful of banks

and probably have the major portion of their

wealth in their homes. He said they do not believe that safe deposit

boxes are entirely safe and these racketeers suspect that high officials

in the banks have keys and permit the Internal Revenue Service to

examine the contents of any safe deposit box.

He was speaking of

the very wealthy racketeers. He did not specifically bring out any

information concerning BRUNO but said that he considers BRUNO to be

extremely wealthy.

On January 31, 1958, Confidential Informant I-I advised

SA JOHN H. BIERMANN that he was indebted to subject's brother-in-law,

RALPH MARANCA, for approximately $30,000. He stated he is having

aIfficulty making ends meet and he is paying MARANCA off in small

amounts each week.

purchase of 75 sanitation trucks and two caterpillars at the cost

of about one million dollars and that the contract should bring

an annual return of one million dollars.

BRUNO said that it would

be necessary to get the approval of DOMINICK POLLINO (Philadelphia

Top Hoodlum - Bureau File 92-2790) for the necessary outlay of

cash. Later, the matter was discussed with POLLINO and he approved

the proposition and said money would be secured by drawing funds

from various unidentified corporations and business concerns.

It

was planned that after the contract is obtained, a "front man"

with no racket background would be selected to conduct the operation.

the Senator

T-10 advised

is probably a Florida State Senator who has been in office

about three

years.

On January 9, 1958, I-10 said that on January 3, 1958,

ANGELO BRUNO said that the Florida State Senator and Attorney HAFT

wanted 20 per cent of the profit per year for securing the trash

contract.

The next day, BRUNO agreed to pay 20 per cent of the profits

per year to the senator

and HAFT for securing this contract. The

contract is to be awarded in the name of BEN GALLUP (phonetic), who,

according to the informant, operates a juke box business for the

"'Italian element" in Miami.

BRUNO said that GALLUP's affiliation

with the racket element in Miami is not generally known and he is

considered "clean."

BRUNO said the contract would probably be

awarded in about 45 days.

On January 23, 1958, I-10 said that on January 20, 1958,

ANGELO BRUNO, DOMINICK POLLINA, and another individual met

at the

Maggio Cheese Company, Philadelphia, to discuss the pending trash

contract at Miami, Fla. According to the informant, the Florida State

Senator wanted $30,000 payment now and 20 per cent of the profit annually.

They agreed that the $30,000 payment would be placed in escrow until

the contract was awarded.

In addition to that, the senator wanted to

choose a man and place him in a supervisory capacity in the firm.

The individuals involved were

not in agreement with this.

There was

to be another meeting at the Maggio Cheese Company on January 23, 1958;

however, BRUNO was not available

for this meeting.

The Miami Division also advised that no inquiry would be

made at the Golden Nugget Motel, Miami Beach, Fla., unless advised

to the contrary, in view of the fact the Golden Nugget Motel is a

known hoodlum hangout and the possibility exists the inquiry would

reach BRUNO and have an effect on negotiations of BRUNO, Confidential

Informant I-10, and others involved in the garbage and trash contract.

On February 18, 1958, Confidential Informant I-I0 identified

the Senator from Florida, previously referred to by him as "Senator

MORRIS,' as being Florida's State Senator JOSEPH EATON.

The Informant

insists that the trash collection contract is to be awarded in Dade

County, Fla., which includes Miami and Miami Beach, for both commercial

and residential. T-10 stated he did not know who the attorney HAFT

or Senator EATON would contact to obtain such a contract.

He stated

that necessary negotiations are being handled by the Italian element,

apparently through BEN GALLUP (phonetic).

By airtel dated March 19, 1958, the Miami Division advised

DAVID GLASS, FBI No. 3733899, formerly from Philadelphia, and

the present owner and operator of the Golden Nugget Motel, Miami

Beach, Fla., was interviewed on February 19, 1958, by SA's ROBERT

K. LEWIS and ELMER I. EURICH in connection with another matter.

GLASS

advised that he knows BRUNO and that BRUNO was not registered at the

Golden Nugget Motel at that time. GLASS was not receptive to

questions regarding BRUNO; therefore, his association with BRUNO was

not pursued any further.

Credit and criminal checks at Miami reflect no arrest record

Miami Beach Police Department, the Dade County Sheriff's Office, and
