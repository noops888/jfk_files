The White House was preparing a letter to Senator Church recognizing

that Congress can, at its discretion, declassify material it

receives, but strongly urging that such declassification action

not be taken unilaterally by the Senate Select Committee without

approval of the agency originating the information.

:. Authority of Congress to Release Classified Data

I. I have found no express authority for Congress to publicly release

information classified by the executive branch pursuant to an Executive

order issued by the President. Moreover, on a number of occasions Congress

has mandated that matters pertaining to national defense or foreign policy

be kept secret.

--Congress has made it a crime for one lawfully having possession,

access or control of documents relating to national defense or infor-

mation relating to the national defense which the possessor has

reason to believe could be used to the injury of the United States

or to the advantage of any foreign nation to communicate, deliver,

or transmit same to any person not entitled to receive it.

18

U.S.C,A. 793(d).

--Congress has made it a crime to disclose to an unauthorized per-

son or publish any classified information obtained by the processes

of communications intelligence. 18 U.S.C.A. 798(a).

--Congress has made it a crime to photograph or sketch vital military

or naval installations or equipment requiring protection against gen-

eral dissemination of information. 18 U.S.C.A. 795. It is also a

crime to publish or disseminate photographs, maps, or drawings of

such defense installations without first obtaining permission of the

commanding officer or higher authority. 18 U.S.C.A. 797.

--Congress, in order to prevent public disclosure of certain activities,

has given various officials the power to keep confidential certain funds

expended for national security or foreign relations purposes. Such

authority is given, for example, to the President (22 U.S.C.A. 2364),

to the Secretary of State (31 U.S.C.A, 107), and to the Director of

Central Intelligence (50 U,S.C.A. 403j).

-Congress has provided that meetings of the Senate Committee on

the Budget may be closed to the public if it is determined by a record

vote of a majority of the members that the matter to be discussed

...will disclose matters necessary to be kept secret in the

interest of national defense or the confidential conduct of

the foreign relations of the United States. 2 U,S.C.A.:

190a-3..

--Congress, after requiring that the Secretary of State transmit forth-

with to the Congress the text of any international agreement, other

than a treaty, to which the United States'is a party, goes on to pro-

• vide that

.,any such agreement the immediate public disclosure

of which would, in the opinion of the President, be prej-

udicial to the national security of the United States shall

not be so transmitted to the Congress but shall be trans-

mitted to the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate

and the Committee ön Foreign Affairs of the House of Rep-

resentatives under an appropriate injunction of secrecy to

be removed only upon due notice from the President.

1U.S.C.A. 112b.

-Finally, Congress, in enacting the Freedom of Information Act,

expressly exempted from disclosure matters which are

•..specifically authorized under criteria established

by an Executive order to be kept secret in the interest

of national defense or foreign policy. 5 U.S.C.A.

552 (b) (1) .

2. Despite this apparent lack of authority to release classified data

and the existence of the above-mentioned statutes, Congress is constitutionally

immunized, at least in part, against any consequences flowing from release

and disclosure of classified information. Article I, $ 6 of the Constitution

states in respect to Senators and Representatives that:

..,for any Speech or Debate in either House, they shall

not be questioned in any other Place.

2

NW 65360 Docld:32989532 Page 6

## Page 7

3. A long line of Supreme Court cases, beginning with Kilbourn v.

Thompson, 103 U,S, 168 ({991), has held that the privilege or immunity

: relating to speech or debate should be given a broad and liberal construc-

fion, In Kilbourn the court stated:

It would be a narrow view of the Constitutional provision

to limit it to words spoken in debate. The reason oi the

rule is as forcible in its application to written reports

presented in that body by its committees, to resolutions

offered, which, though in writing, must be reproduced

in speech, and to the act of voting.... In short, to things

generally done in a session of the House by one of its

members in relation to the business before it. (At p. 204.)

4. The court, moreover; has resisted arguments that an unworthy

purpose should destroy the privilege. In Tenney v. Brandhove, 341 U.S.

367 the court reaffirmed its earlier holding in Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch

8? (1810), stating:

.. that it was not consonant with our scheme of govern-

ment for a court to inquire into the motives of legislators,

has remained unquestioned, (At.p. 377.)

The distance to which the court was willing to go to uphold this principle

was seen in United States v. Johnson, 383 U,S. 169 (1966). In that case

a former Congressman was convicted for conspiracy to defraud the U.S.,

in part on evidence that, in pursuance of a conspiracy designed to give

assistance to certain savings and loan associations which had been indicted

on mail fraud charges, he was paid to give a speech on the floor of the House.

The Supreme Court granted a new trial holding that a prosecution which

draws in question the legislative acts of the defendant member of Congress

er his motives for performing them "necessarily contravenes the Speech or

Debate Clause." (Atp. 185.)

5. The court addressed the issue of classified information in Gravel v.

United States, 408 U.S. 606 (1972), a case which arose when Senator Gravel,

Ehairman of the Subcommittee on Buildings and Grounds of the Senate Public

Works Committee, convened a night meeting of the Subcommittee and there

read extensively from a copy of the Pentagon Papers which bore a Defense

security classification of Top Secret - Sensitive. He then placed the entire

47 volumes of the study in the public record. Senator Gravel claimed that

Article I, section 6 protected him from criminal or civil liability and from

3

•NW 65360-Docld:3

---

## Page 8

questioning elsewhere than in the Senate, with respect to the events occur-

ring at the Subcommittee hearing at which the Pentagon Papers were intro-

duced into the public record. The court stated: ".../T/o us this claim is

incontrovertible." (Atp. 615.)

6. The court further noted that:

The Speech or Debate Clause was designated to assure

a co-equal branch of the government wide freedom of

speech, debate, and deliberation without intimidation

or threats from the Executive Branch. It thus protects

Members against prosecutions that directly impinge

upon or threaten the legislative process. We have no

doubt that Senator Gravel may not be made to answer--

either in terms of questions or in terms of defending

himself from prosecution--for the events that occurred

at the subcommittee meeting. (Atp. 616.)

?. From the above, together with the positive phrasing of Article 1,

§ 6 of the Constitution, it would appear that any Member may make any state-

ment he desires on the floor of the Congress or in one of its committees. Such

statement shall be absolutely privileged, notwithstanding that it was based

on information secured from classified Central Intelligence Agency material

either furnishea the Member in confidence or containing any restrictive

notice as to use or dissemination. This privilege would operate if the Member

were to read the information verbatim into the record on the floor or into

the record of hearings before a congressional committee. It would still be

privileged when it appeared, verbatim, in the Congressional Record or in

the published hearings of a congressional committee. The only sanction,

apart from the individual conscience and sense of responsibility of the Member,

would have to come from Congress itself, which has the power to discipline

any Representative or Senator who improperly disclosed classified information.

8. One additional wrinkle might be noted. Although Congressmen

would be immune from liability for introducing classified information into

a committee report and immune from liability for ordering it printed and

disseminated to the public at large, the Public Printer and the Superintendent

of Documents may not be immune from suit for printing and disseminating

such reports to the public. The court examined this question in Doe v.

McMillan, 412 U.S, 306(1973), a case in which petitioners claimed that a

report issued by the House Committee on the District of Columbia, containing

4

1497019290494

NW 65360- Docld:32989532 Page 8

---

## Page 9

documents relating to disciplinary problems of certain specifically named

students, violated statutory, constitutional and common-law rights to pri-

vacy. The Supreme Court refused to determine whether dissemination to

the public would serve the important legislative function of informing the

public concerning matters pending before Congress for the purpose of

holding Members of Congress liable. However, it remanded the case to

the Court of Appeals, in part to undertake just such a review in order to

determine whether the Public Printer and the Superintendent of Documents.,

who were without blanket immunity, could be held liable..

9. The discussion thus far has dealt only with congressional immunity

for releasing classified information in Congress. No such immunity exists

in the case of disclosures made by congressmen outside of Congress. Thus,

in. Long v. Ansel, 69 F.2d 386 (Ct. App., D.C, 1934), affã. 293 U.S. 76

(1934), and in McGovern v. Martz, 182 F, Supp. 343 (US Dist. Ct., D.C.

1960) it was held that if a Senator or Representative is alleged to have com-

mitted libel by republishing and disseminating remarks made in the Congress,

such republication and dissemination is not within the Speech or Debate

privilege even if such privilege would have been applicable to the original

publication of the remarks. Again, in Gravel v. United States, 408 U.S. 606

(1972), and in Doe v. McMillan, 412 U,S. 306 (1973) the court noted that

the Speech or Debate Clause does not protect "à private republication of

documents introduced and made public at a committee hearing, although the

hearing was unquestionably part of the legislative process."

10. From the above it is apparent that a Member is not privileged to

circulate CIA documents to his constituents, to the press, or by reading to

a meeting or on radio or television. Such action could well make the member

liable for prosecution under the espionage laws, but in any event would

expose him to the same liability for these actions as any other citizen. As

a practical matter, however, the prosecution of a Member for unauthorized

disclosure of classified CIA material, or disciplinary action by Congress

itself, is very unlikely.

At 11:20 a.m. 5/14/75 Sentinella telephonically contacted

Phillips from Atlanta, Georgia, and advised that he had been tele-

phonically contacted earlier on the morning of 5/14/75 by SSC

Staff Member Lester B. Seidel who had interviewed him 5/12/75.

Seidel told Sentinella that he is being subpoenaed to give sworn

testimony before an Executive Session of the SSC 9:30 a.M. Wednesday,

5/21/75. The testimony is to be given in Room G-308, New Senate

Office Building. In response to specific questions from Sentinella,

Seidel advised

Sentinella that he will be reimbursed expenses,

thạt

his presence will probably be needed for only one day, and that the

purpose is to essentially go over the material covered when Seidel

interviewed Sentinella 5/12/75. Seidel asked Sentinella who had

taken over the case concerning Levison (Stanley David Levison, former

consultant to Martin Luther King, JI., who was under Bureau investi-

gation because of his communist background) in Atlanta when

Sentinella left. Sentinella furnished Seidel the name of SA

We received this afternoon, 5/9/75, From Mrs. Süsan-M.

Hauser of the Deputy Attorney General's Office, the following

data:

1) informal note from Doug Marvin to the Deputy. Attorney

General re: Senator Hart's meeting with the Attorney General

5/6/75; 2) letter to Senator Hart by the Attorney General dated

5/7/75 advising that Hart's ofal request for access to his FBI

file will be treated as coming under the FOIA; and 3) a memoran

dum from for files dated 5/6/75 that appears to have been

dictated by the Attorney General in which he sets forth pertinent

information concerning his meeting with Senator Hari.

The Attorney

General points out. that he will treat Hart's oral request as

coming under the FOIA although

he did not know

whether the

Senator should in fact make this request in writing (actually,

the Code of Federal Regulations, of course, points out that FOIA

requests must be in writing).

According to the Attorney General's memorandum, Senator

Hart indicated that he was not trying to make a particular

point and

did not want to go to court, but rather felt it would

be helpful to members of the Senate Select Committee, who wanted

to do it, to see what an FBI file was like, and he felt that by

seeing his own file it would raise less problems than trying to

see someone else's file.

In view of the Attorney General's letter to Senator

Hart of 5/7/75 advising him that his oral request will be processed

under the FOIA, the FOIA Section will immediately institute the

processing of this request.

However, unless advised to the

contrary,

it is intended that Senator Hart's request will be put

in chronological ordes and will receive no special treatinent.

It

should also be noted that Senator Hart is under the mistaken

belief that as a Senator, and particularly as a member of the

Senate Select Committee,

he could receive an FBI file on a third:

This informative memorandum to record highlights of sey-

Staff Member of retired SA Alan G. Séntinella, as obtained by

Supervisor Seymor Fred Phillips of the Bureau's Senstudy 75

ALL TONPORRATTON SEEN DIEG

HEREIN IS UNCLASSIFIED

DARE 1-19-01

Special Project.

Pursuant to Bureau instructions, Phillips went to Atlanta,

Georgia, to fulfill the request of Sentinella for the presence of

a Bureau Agent at the time Sentinella was to be interviewed on

5/12/75 by SSC Staff Member Lester B. Seidel.

Sentinella is presently

Safety Director, Georgia State University, Atlanta. He has been

retired from the FBI for about four years

and in the period around

1964-66 he did work on the investigation of Martin Luther King, Jr.,

and for a time, the King case as well as that of King's organization,

the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, was assigned to him.

Sentinella had been told in advance by Seidel that he was to be

interviewed concerning King and Levison (Stanley David Levison,

former consultant to King who was under Bureau investigation because

of his communist background) .

Phillips was in Sentinella's private office at 12:24 p.M.

when Seidel arrived. Sentinella explained to Seidel that after

Sentinella had agreed in a telephone conversation with Seidel 5/9/75

to being interviewed, he (Sentinella) contacted the Atlanta FBI

Office because Sentinella was concerned with the sensitivity of the

information he knew about King and Levison and wanted to protect

the confidentiality of his information and the Bureau's interests»

specially as pertaining to current investigations, sourcess

sentinella explained to Seidel that the fBl offeredto have an Agent

present, not to monitor the interview, but for consultation pusposes

should the interview reach into sensitive areas. Sentinella thus

accounted to Seidel for Phillips' presence.

At this points"phillips

reiterated the reasons given by Sentinella for the presence of

FBI Agent and Seidel was told that phillips' presence was definitely

RE:

not intended to have any chilling effect on Seidel's interview

and that Phillips was there only upon Sentinella's request and

for the purposes indicated. Phillips then retired to an adjoining

room.

Sentinella consulted with Phillips on only one occasion.

At about 1:45 p.m. .

he came to Phillips adjoining office; and

said that Seidel's current questioning was concerning the make-up

of the squad Sentinella was assigned to around 1965.

This squad

handled security, racial, and civil rights matters and Seidel was

apparently seeking information as to the parámeters of these types

of investigations and what they entailed. At this point Phillips

and orat tony enta the

joined Seidel and Sentinella and offered the following in possible

assistance to Seidel. Phillips explained that the various Sections

of the Bureau Manuals dealing with these types of investigations

had been made available to the SSC and insofar as the security

Sections were concerned, there was presently being processed at the

Bureau superseded Sections dating back to 1960 to be made available

to the SSC.

At this point Seidel stated he was not so much interested

in what the Manuals said but actually wanted Sentinella, to the best

of his recollection, to furnish names of individuals and organizations

under investigation in Atlanta during the pertinent period.

Sentinella refused to name any, stating that he had no idea as to.

what might be under current investigation or how his furnishing of

information now might affect current Bureau's interests.

Sentinella

also told Seidel that he, Sentinella, was not so naive as to

believe that his information might not appear in the press. Seidel

immediately said that he would furnish no information to the press.

Sentinella then said that he was not intimating that Seidel would be

responsible, but that the information might still be publicized and

that once Sentinella gave the information it fell completely out of

his control.. Seidel indicated that Sentinella might be required

through subpoena to testify before the SSC and be asked the same

question. Sentinella responded that his answer before the Committee

would be the same.

Phillips indicated to Sentinella that if he

desired to consult with Phillips concerning the names of any

investigations Sentinella recalled, Phillips would assist him by

indicating, if he knew, whether they were of current FBI interest.

Sentinella desired no such help and insisted to Seidel that he did

not desire to name the subjects of prior investigations. This inter-

lude in the formal interview lasted about 10 minutes after which

Phillips returned to the adjoining room.

RE:

SENSTUDY 75

62-116395

At 2:20 p.M. the interview ended and Phillips was

taken by Sentinella back into the latter's office where Seidel

said he was leaving and wanted to say good-bye. Phillips alluded

to the interview having been completed to which Seidel responded,

and these are to the best of Phillips' recollection, Seidel's

exact words, "Yes, you're not letting him give us the good

information." Immediately upon hearing this statement from

Seidel, Phillips interjected a strong protest by stating to Seidel

that neither Phillips nor the FBI was keeping Sentinella from giving

any information; that the FBI has not injected itself in Sentinella's

decision to give or not give information.

Seidel responded with a

statement to the effect that the result is the same -- Sentinella

is not giving the good information. Phillips again responded by

telling Seidel that irrespective of the latter's opinion, Phillips

wanted the record crystal clear that Sentinella has not been

counseled by Phillips or anyone else in the FBI as to what he

should or should not tell Seidel. Sentinella interrupted to

express his loyalty to the Bureau as well as his respect for

the confidentiality of his relationship with the Bureau and its

work. He told Seidel that he did not intend to be a talkative,

discontented former FBI employee as apparently : : are some of

the she himself consen tastes a distinenty atten by the

Bureau but that it had made him a better Agent and that it in no

way would influence his loyalty and responsibility to the Bureau.

Seidel then left.

After Seidel's departure, Sentinella stated it was his

personal desire to dictate a lengthy question and answer type

statement of the entire interview while it was fresh in his mind

as he had not taken any notes. He said he preferred

I to handle this

with his own secretary whom he trusts implicitly and has pledged

to maintain this information confidential: Sentinella advised that

he would have the typing of the statement completed the following

day and would immediately make a copy available to Atlanta SAC

DeBruler for transmittal to Bureau Headquarters. At Sentinella's

invitation, Phillips sat in on the dictation of practically the

entire statement as a means for Sentinella briefing Phillips on

the details of the interview. Instant memorandum is not intended

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall

RE: SENSTUDY 75

62-116395

to summarize these details which will be forthcoming with

Sentinella's statement to be mailed to the Bureau. However.

one significant question asked of Sentinella should be noted.

During a discussion of electronic surveillances in the King

investigation, Seidel asked how other Agents felt about "illegal

use of taps."

Sentinella's response was that the taps were not

illegal and were put on only after approval by the Attorney

General.

OBSERVATIONS:

It is Phillips' view that Sentinella represents a

high caliber former Agent who is completely loyal to the Bureau •

and will apparently go to any extreme to maintain the confidentiality

of the work he did. He certainly could be described as a reluctant

witness if he is ever called to testify. He expressed personal'

concern that he might be called but hoped that his uncooperativeness

in some areas to Seidel's questions might discourage his being called.

Two incidents related above are very suggestive of a lack

of objectivity on the part of Seidel. The first concerns his

comment to Phillips about the FBI not letting Sentiñella give him

"good information."

To begin with, this was an unjustified allega-

tion: and Seidel was set straight immediately after his remark.

Secondly, the mere fact that Seidel is referring to "good" infor-

mation suggests itself that certain information fits their desires

and others does not. There appears to be a lack of regard for

merely securing the facts, regardless of what those facts might

lindicate. The second indicator of lack of objectivity was Seidel's

inquiry about "illegal use of taps." This question fits the

classic question of, "When did you stop beating your wife?"

'If the Committee is going to be asking questions like this one,

its objectivity is certainly subject to challenge.

As ex- or current employees volunteer to us results

of interviews

conducted of them by

the SSC, we will carefully

study them for, among other things, additional evidence of the

nature discussed above. If there is a continuation of this

line of questioning or other unjustified comments to Bureau

representatives, we will consider taking up with the Attorney

General the matter of possible protest to the SSC.

This memorandum is for the immediate information

of Bureau officials. When the detailed statement of Sentinella

is received, we will prepare an IHM for the Attorney General

with a copy for possible forwarding to Mr. James Wilderotter,

FORMER SUPERVISOR LISH WHITSON

Agent Whitson.

u on a dolamora cand

captioned as above submitted earlier today,

I advised you of a telephone call received 4/22/75 from former Special

He had called to advise that he had been requested

to appear for interview by Michael Epstein, staff member of the

'Senate Select Committee.

and

At 2:50 p.m. today (4/23/75) Mr. Whitson called at my office

said that he had just been interviewed by Mr. Epstein and was

desirous of reporting the results.

Epstein first asked Whitson when he entered the Bureau, when

he first arrived

for assignment at Headquarters, to what Headquarters

Division he had been

assigned, and when he retired.

Epstein then said

that he knew that Whitson had at one time mailed a package to

MrS. Martin Luther King from Tampa, Florida, and asked Whitson to

relate the details concerning this

matter.

Whitson thereupon told

him that in the late Summer of 1964 former Assistant to the Director

William C.

Sullivan had telephoned Whitson at his home one saturday/

and told him that former Director Hoover wanted Whitson to deliver

a package to Miami, Florida, by plane and on arrival at the Miamì

Airport to telephone Sullivan for further instructions. Whitson did

as directed and upon calling Sullivan was instructed to address the

package to Mx. Martin Luther King. Accordingly, Whitson had the

package weighed, put stamps on it, and addressed it to Martin Luther

King (not MrS. Martin Luther King

as Epstein had indicated). The

following day, Sunday, Whitson flew back to Washington.

The next day,

Monday, he informed Sullivan that his instructions had

been carried

out and Sullivan commented "Someday I will tell you about

Epstein asked

him who had paid for the stamps

package and Whitson said that he had probably done so utilizing per

diem money.

Epstein asked whether he had put a return address on the

package and Whitson replied in the negative.

Epstein asked if

Miami Airport, or whether Whitson had discussed this with anyone.

Whitson advised Epstein that he had not gone to the Miami Office,

that

no Agent had met him, and that he had discussed the matter only with

Sullivan.

At this point, Whitson asked Epstein how he got the story.

Epstein merely laughed and did not reply to the question.

The foregoing represents the information furnished to

Epstein by Whitson.

Whitson made the following additional comments

and observations.

When Sullivan told Whitson he wanted him to fly the package

to Miami, he stated that only he, Sullivan, Mr. Hoover, Mr. Tolson,

and Mr. Belmont knew of this situation.

Sullivan never did explain

to Whitson anything more regarding this incident.

Sullivan did during

Whitson's anniversary celebration in 1968 in Sullivan's office refer

to Whitson as "a real pro who knows how to carry out an assignment,"

and further commented that someday he would tell Lish about the

assignment to which he had referred in his remarks.

Whitson said that whan he arrived at the North Terminal

of National Airport, following Sullivan's telephonic instructions,

a young man who was

unknown to Whitson but who addressed him as

"Mr. Whitson" turned a package over to him which was wrapped in brown

paper and sealed with sealing tape. It is Whitson's recollection

the package measured approximately 8 inches by 8 inches by 1 inch.

It is Whitson's recollection that at the time the foregoing

occurred, Martin Luther King was either just about to go abroad to

receive the Nobel Peace Prize or probably had already gone abroad.

It was Whitson's further recollection that sometime shortly after

the mailing of the package Sullivan commented to Whitson that the

package had not yet been received by Martin Luther King. Because 0f

this remark, Whitson is of the belief that the package was mailed

to Martin Luther King at the headquarters of the Southern Christian

Leadership Conference and

not to Mr. King at the latter's home.

Further, it was Whitson's recollection that it

was not long after he

had mailed the package that Martin Luther King had a personal meeting

with former Director Hoover in Mr. Hoover's office.

Whitson stated that during the interview Epstein asked

Whitson if he had

ever written a memorandum regarding this matter, to

which Whitson replied in the negative.

He was also asked by Epstein

if he had ever seen a memorandum on this and Whitson again replied

in the negative. Whitson observed that in his opinion the information

which was in the possession of Epstein prior to his interview with

Memorandum to Mr. Adams

Re:

SENSTUDY 75

FORMER SUPERVISOR LISH WHITSON

ASSIGNED INTELLIGENCE DIVISION

Whitson

must have originated with W. C. Sullivan.

Whitson noted

that Mr. Hoover and Mr. Tolson are both deceased and that he has heard

nothing indicating Mr.

Belmont has been contacted by members of the

staff of the Senate Select Committee.

One other factor that causes

him to feel that Sullivan was the source of the information was a

question Epstein raised as to whether Whitson had put a return address

on the package when he addressed it to Martin Luther King.

Whitson

said he

recalls that when he was in Miami and received the telephonic

instructions from Sullivan, Sullivan told him that he should put a

return address on the package and Whitson pointed out that if he did

so and the name of the addressee became smeared the package would end

up at someone's return address rather than in the dead letter office.

Sullivan concurred that no return address should be used. Thus,

Sullivan would probably have reason to have commented regarding

the

use or nonuse of a return address.

Whitson stated that in the event he is called again to be

interviewed by anyone connected with the Senate Select Committee, he

intended to notify the Bureau beforehand and would appreciate it if

the Bureau would consider having someone present during the interview,

if this could be arranged, since he recognizes an obligation not to

reveal FBI information contrary to regulations issued by the Attorney

General. Appreciation was expressed to Mr. Whitson for his volun

teering the foregoing information.

This is the first instance which has come to our attention

indicating staff members of the Senate Select Committee are proceeding

with interviews of former Agents.

I have discussed this matter with

Mr. Mintz and he and I feel it would be appropriate to furnish an

abstract of the interview of Whitson by Epstein to the Ad Hoc

Coordinating Group of the Intelligence Community in order that

interested agencies will be aware of the procedures presently being

followed by the Select Committee and of the Committee's interest in

matters other than jurisdictional bases. All Committee requests to

us have thus far been confined to the latter.

If approved, an abstract will be provided for the records

of the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group.

At approximately 2:35 PM, Mr. Allen G.. Sentinella

telephonically advised that he retired from the Atlanta Office in

1971, and is currently employed at Georgia State University,

Atlanta, Georgia. Sentinella said he had just been contacted by

an individual who identified himself as Lester Seidel of the Senate

Select Committee. Seidel desires to interview Sentinella on Monday,

May 12th, concerning the Martin Luther King and Levinson cases.

Sentinella stated that while assigned to the Atlanta Office

he handled the dissemination of information received from informants

during our investigation concerning the communist infiltration of the

SCLC. Sentinella said he recalled very little concerning this

investigation and gave his assurances that he would not divulge any

confidential information.

Sentinella asked whether or not he should retain private

counsel and he was informed if he felt it necessary, he should do so.

He was further informed that his interview was entirely voluntarily

and he had no obligation to submit to interview. Mr. Sentinella gave

Attached is a copy of a letter

to the Attorney General

dated 5/14/75, from Senator Erank Church, Chairman, U. S. Senate

Select Committee (SSC) with appendices A thru D.

Appendix A, entitled "Documents_ Pertaining to the

Committee's Prior Requests," consists of 10 requests most of

which have been already responded to or, in the instances of

requests numbers 4, 7, 8 and 9, are the

responsibility of the

Department of Justice. Item 6 has been previously referred

to the White House.

Appendices B, C, and D, contain numerous

"new" requests which are extremely broad in

their definition,

often ambiguous in meaning and contain many instances where

they seem to be parallel to and overlap previous requests.

On 5/16/75, a conference was held in the Intelligence

Division between representatives of the INTD SENSTUDY Staff and

Departmental representatives Messrs. Robert McDermott and

K. William O'Connor.

Mr. McDermott is on the staff of the

Deputy Attorney General and has been active in coordinating

SSC matters.

He is being replaced in this capacity on 5/19/75

by Mr. O'Connor, Deputy

Assistant Attorney General in the Civil

Rights Division.

Mr. O'Connor advised that the Deputy Attorney

General, Judge Tyler and White House representative James

Wilderotter were both greatly concerned about the requests

contained in the May, 14, letter.

were much too broad and placed much toogreat

Department and the FBI to be forthcoming.

that the requests clearly indicated an intention aftin3105s

"raw files" while not actually

In this regard you will note that Page 3 of the

May, 14, letter defines the SSC request for "memoranda

and other materials" as meaning 'all documents relating to the

subject matter requested and are to include (but are not limited

to) reports, letters, correspondence, airtels, LIMs, inserts,

executive conference memoranda, 302s, Assistant Director memos,

notes, routing slips, etc."

This letter, also on Page 3,

recognizes that the request is substantial but urges the

executive agencies to apply sufficient manpower and attention

to enable prompt responses. Prompt response is defined by the

Committee as having most of the material available within 10

and all of it shortly thereafter.

Mr. O'Connor advised

that he was aware that the imposition of such a condition upon

the responses created an impossible task. He advised that on

Monday, 5/19/75, he would contact SSC Chief Counsel F. A. O.

Schwarz calling

attention to this time factor and also the often

broad and ambiguous manner of many of the requests appended

to the May, 14, letter.

Mr. O'Connor hopes to negotiate these

requests as well as the conditions attached to the responses

by the SSC to the end that the requests are more narrowly

defined and that the deadline imposed by the Committee be

relaxed to

• a more realistic time frame.

Pending receipt of results of Mr. O'Connor's inter-

cession with sSC we are proceeding with an analysis of the sSc's

requests and attempting to separate components for specific

assignments to appropriate divisions within FBIHQ so that our

responses may be forthcoming in as coordinated and timely

a fashion as possible.

ACTION:

None.

For information purposes.

The Honorable Edward H. Levi

The Attorney General

Washington, D. C. 20530

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

The purpose of this letter is to review. with you the status

of the Select Committee's outstanding requests to your Department

and to set out several new areas in which the Committee is request-

ing either staff access to documents or copies of documents for its

on files.

In the matter of the outstanding requests the chronology is as

follows:

You will recall that I wrote to you on March 19, setting

out five areas pertaining to the FBI in which the Committee

was initially interested. Although we have had partial

compliance with the request, that process is not yet complete.

In addition, on April 21, Mr. Schwarz, Chief Counsel of

the Committee, met with the Deputy Attorney General about the

March 19 letter and about the establishment of liaison between

your Department and the Committee.

On April 23, Mr. Schwarz wrote to the Deputy Attorney

General a letter reflecting that meeting, clarifying the

March 19 request on the matter of intelligence techniques, and

intelle

making a further request pertaining to the Internal security

Division.

Mr. Schwarz also wrote the Deputy Attorney General and

the FBI Director a memorandum on April 30 requesting that

Committee staff members be permitted access to certain documents

falling within the scope of the March 19 request.

On April 28, I wrote to you concerning the so-called

"Official and Confidential" files of the FBI.

The Committee has not yet received a formal response to those

letters. Appendix A sets out those documents which have not yet

been supplied to the Committee pursuant to the larch 19 letter

and follo-up, correspondence.

On the second matter, that is, the request for copies of adi-

tional documents (and for staff access to others), the Committee's

interest falls into roughly three areas pertaining to the activities

of the FBi and the Department of Justice:

First, the Committee has been made aware of additional

documents that are analogous to the background requests made

in the First Document Request. These documents are set out

as Appendix B.

Second, the Committee is concerned about several programs

or studies pertaining to specific intelligence or counter-

intelligence activities of

the FBI. S. Res. 21 specifically

requires the Committee to investigate "the conduct of domestic

counterintelligence operations against United States citizens"

by the FBI. Therefore, the Committee must conduct an exhaustive

investigation of the so-called "COINTELPRO" programs as well

as miscellaneous other incidents which have come to our attention.

S. Res. 21. also specifically requires the Committee to investi-

gate all aspects of the so-called "Huston Plan"

Further

requests pertaining to these matters are set out as Appendix C.

Third, we are interested in allegations pertaining to

electronic

surveillance generally, electronic surveillance of

the so-called "IT government officials and journalists" in

1969-71 by the FBI, electronic surveillance and other intelli-

gence activities directed at Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and

electronic surveillance and other intelligence activities at

the Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City, New Jersey,

in the summer of 1964. Requests pertaining to these subjects

are set out as Appendix D.

In setting out certain specific documents in the Appendices,

the Committee does not change its position that the original request

of March 19 was general in scope and designed to encourage the

Justice Department and the FBI to provide us with documents pertain-

ing to the legal authority and the policy and procedures of the FBI

which have not yet been brought to the attention of the Committee

and were therefore not specifically mentioned in any of its requests.

Furthermore, the Committee intends its requests to be generously

construed so that descriptive words used herein are meant in a general

the Chief Counsel regarding procedures for access to the deleted

information which will protect individual privacy to the degree

consistent with the Committee's need to exercise its mandate.

We recognize, of course, that this is a substantial request.

But the mandate given to the Committee by the Senate is itself very

broad.

We are seeking to perform our duties under that mandate

expeditiously.

For us to do so, it. is necessary for the Executive

Agencies to apply sufficient manpower and attention to our requests

to enable prompt responses. We hope that you will have a schedule

for response promptly, have nost of the material available within

10 days, and all of it shortly thereafter.

The Committee also asks to be advised at once whether the

specific documents presently outstanding from the March 19 request

(see Appendix A, items 1, 2, 6 and 7) will be provided.

". . . In order to consider what measures may be

appropriate, we have endeavored to characterize

the types of abuse to which the Bureau has been

susceptible in the past.

a.

"Use of the resources of the FBI to gather

political intelligence. Our review disclosed

a few documented instances in which the Bureau

at times during the course of an election

campaign was requested to provide - and did

indeed provide - information which could be

used as political intelligence information.

In one instance, this involved a check of FBI

files on the staff of a campaign opponent.

b.

"Improper use of the FBI in connection with

the political process. In a few instances

recorded in Bureau files, an incumbent Presi-

dent caused the FBI to gather intelligence

relating to a political convention under cir-

cumstances that although cast in legitimate.

law. enforcement terms could - and some would

say should - have been suspected of being

politically motivated.

C .

"Use of the FBI to report on. certain activi-

ties of critics of an Administration's policies.

:The FBI files document a few instances in whịch

an incumbent President caused the Bureau to

report on certain activities of Members. of

Congress who were opposed to and critical of.

his policies.

Branch-to enable them to disorcat uno.

S

This is to advise of recent request by Senate

Select Committee (SSC) that U. S. Postal Service (USPS)

furnish to the SSC the identities of all mail covers placed

by the FBI since 1960.

On 5/14/75 Mr. Ron L. Jackson, Assistant Chief

Inspector, Office of Security Investigations, USPS, adised

Liaison Officer L.A. Crescioli that Mr. Paul

Wallach, staff

member of the SSC, has requested USPS to furnish the

identities of all

FBI mail covers placed with the USPS since

1960.

According to Jackson, Chief Postal Inspector William J.

Cotter has informed Wallach

of such detailed information and that the SSC should there-

fore make this request directly to the Bureau. Mr. Jackson

requested that the FBI consider directing a communication

to Chief Cotter, pointing out that the Bureau does interpose

an objection to

the USPS complying with above request and

that the SSC should proceed directly to the FBI in this

regard.

OBSERVATIONS:

The request for the identies of all FBI mail covers

since 1960 in effect provides the SSC with the identities

of the subjects of FBI investigations, which includes some

extremely sensitive cases.

The intelligence community in

attempting to work out guidelines with the ssc as to

sensitive areas of inquiry have indicated that specific

targets of ongoing intelligence operations should be subject

to negotiation between the SSC staff and the appropriate

agency.

The Intelligence Division believes that we should

take a strong stand in this instance and attempt to negotiate

an accommodation which would allow the SSC to carry out its

mission but yet not compromise ongoing FBI sensitive ITs

tigations.

AND DELEGATE WALTER E. FAUNTROY

-75

Sens tudy wy memorandum of March 19, 1875,

Moris f34

My memorandum of March 19, 1975, reported discussions

with the attorney for the estate of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Who

also represents Mrs. Coretta King and her children. It was clearly

indicated that Mrs. King and her children were concerned about invasion

of personal privacy that might occur should there be disclosure of inquiries

concerning the FBI investigation of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. At the

INFORMATION CONTAINED

conclusion of our conference with the King representatives, Assistant

EINS UNCLASSIFIER

B'SPINEM

Attorney General Scalia asked me whether I would be willing to agree to

have Mr. Wachtel notified in the event a congressional committee requested

access to such material in Bureau files. I told him that I saw no difficulty

in the Department advising Mr. Wachtel in the event such a request is made

by a committee of the Congress. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence

Activities has initiated inquiries concerning the Bureau's investigation of

Di. King and though they have not as yet requested material from our files

$ which may contain tapes of electronic surveillance of Dr. King, it is likely

that their inquiry will reach the stage where such demands will be made.

6076

Therefore, in response to the requests made by Mr. Wachtel

- representing Mrs. King and in response to inquiry by Assistant Attorney

General Scalia, it is my view that we should advise the Department of the

nature of the inquiry currently being mate by the Senate Select Committee

and to suggest thai they may wish to notify the representatives of the King

estate and Mrs. King for whatever action they may deem appropriate

between former Assistant to the Director John P. Mohr and

Mr. Jenkins at which time Mr. Mohr furnished additional information

i the morning of 5/9/75...

In reconstructing his interview on the morning of 5/9/75

by Staff Members Mark Gitenstein, Thomas Dawson and Lester B.

Seidel, Mr. Mohr recalled them asking if he knew who prepared the

"surreptitious letters" the Bureau sent in the Socialist Workers

Party case. Mr. Mohr advised the Staff Members that he did not

know but he presumed somebody in the Document Section of the

Laboratory probably prepared these licits. (

is present.

In this regard, Mr. Mohr desired some guidance as to

what he could tell Miss Gandy if Staff Members asked her for the

names of individuals, appearing in the official and confidential

files of Mr. Hoover.

Mr. Mohr was telephonically advised on the

afternoon of 5/12/75 by Cregar that the Bureau could not give him

any advice as to what he could tell Miss Gandy recognizing that

whatever he told Miss Gandy was strictly between the two of them

and not of concern or interest to the FBI. It was further pointed

out to Mr. Mohr that neither he nor Miss Gandy should feel under

ny obligation to report to the bureau what Miss Gandy decided 2

his regard as well as what she might tell the Staff of the SSi

during her forthcoming interview by them on 5/15/75 MAY 2.3 1975

On the occasion of Cregar's call to Mr. Mohr on the 1

afternoon of 5/12/75 Mohr recalled that he had told Staff Members

of the SSC Miss Gandy had turned over to Mr. Felt the official and

confidential files amounting to one-half a file drawer. Mr. Mohr

in speaking with Miss Gandy subsequent to his interview on 5/9/75

learned the official andeconfidential files turned over to Mr. Felt

by Miss Gandy amounted to one and one-half file drawers. Mohr

subsequently advised Mr. Gitenstein of this correction.

Additionally, Gitenstein desired to know whether an itemized

list of the official and confidential files was made and if so,

where the list was.

Mohr told Gitenstein that he was sure a

list was made (subsequently confirmed by Miss Gandy) and that

the list accompanied the official and confidential files.

In addition to the above, Mohr advised that Gitenstein

asked about a requirement of all Bureau employees to turn over

any confidential files in their possession ordered by Mr. Hoover

following the revelation that former Assistant to the Director

Sullivan had turned over certain confidential files to former

Attorney General Mardian. Mohr advised Gitenstein that Mr. Hoover

had in fact levied such

a requirement on Bureau employees and

that all confidential files were to be turned over to Mr. Felt

along with a memorandum explaining the nature of these files.

Gitenstein asked Mr. Mohr where these memoranda would be filed.

Mohr responded by saying he presumed they were confidential

memoranda and would have gone with the confidential files turned

over to Mr. Felt by any Bureau employee maintaining such files.

This memorandum reports the results of a meeting

between former Assistant to the Director John P. Mohr and repre-

sentatives of the Staff of the Senate Select Committee (SSC) on the

morning of 5/9/75.

Memorandum Legal Counsel to MI. J. B. Adams dated 5/5/75

recommended that a. Bureau representative be available for consulta-

tion by Mr. Mohr during the time Mr. Mohr is being interviewed by

staff Members of the SSC 5/9/75. REC100 602-116395-137

Prior to Mr. Mohr's interview by the Staff of the SSC,

Section Chief William O. Cregar met with him. Mr. Mohr was advised

that should representatives of the Staff pose any questions to him

which could lead to the identification of sensitive sources,

sensitive methods of FBI operations or material derived from other

U. S. agencies or foreign governments, he could decline to answer

such questions until he had an opportunity to consult with a Bureau

of the SSC get into these areas of inquiry, he would captainis

consult with Cregar prior to responding.

DATE L

Following our arrival at the New Senate Office Building,

Mr. Mohr and Cregar were met by Staff Members Mark Gitenstein,

Thomas Dawson, and Lester B. Seidel.: As we proceeded to the

office where the interview was to be conducted, Mr. Gitenstein

referred to a previous conference he had with Assistant Director

Wannall at Quantico on 5/5/75 at which Mr. Cregar was present.

Gitenstein observed that this meeting had proved very, very

beneficial and that he believed that future personal contacts

between members of the Senate Select Committee Staff and the FBI

could prove useful and allow the SSC Staff to better understand

how the FBI was administered at Headquarters.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall

RE:

SENSTUDY 75

62-116395

The interview of Mr. Mohr began at approximately

10:20 and was concluded at 12:30 p.m. 5/9/75. Mr. Cregar,

who was available in an adjacent room, was not called and

following the interview, Mr. Mohr assured Mr. Gregar that

no sensitive areas were

addressed by the Staff Members.

Mr. Mohr did indicate that the Staff Members were in possession

of FBI documents dealing with the Socialist Workers Party as

well as documents obtained by Mr. Carl Stern under the Freedom

of Information Act (these are our COINTELPRO. documents which we

were obliged to provide Stern under the FOI). No substantive

questions were directed to Mr. Mohr regarding these documents

but apparently were used to permit Mr. Mohr to identify who

might be the final authority in approving these documents.

As an example, Mr. Mohr noted that in reviewing a sample of

these documents, he voiced the opinion Document A probably

would have been approved by an Assistant Director whereas

Document B might have received the approval of the Director.

Mr. Mohr was unable to identify precisely what documents he

was shown.

It was quite apparent from the interview that the

Staff of the SSC was trying to understand how the flow of

mail proceeded in the FBI under Mr. Hoover's directorship.

A classic example of the Staff Members' confusion was their

inability to distinguish between an SAC letter from a letter

to all SACs. Mr. Mohr attempted to clarify this confusion on

behalf of the Staff Members. With regard to SAC letters, the

Staff Members asked if there was a file on all SAC letters.

Mr. Mohr advised he was not quite sure whether there was a

single file containing all SAC letters.

Members of the Staff also asked Mr. Mohr about his

securing of Mr. Hoover's office after Mr. Hoover's death.

Mr. Mohr told the Committee that the articles which appeared

in "The Washington Star" by columnist Jeremiah O'Leary was

an

accurate recording of his securing of Mr. Hoover's office.

Nevertheless the Staff Members desired that Mr. Mohr go over

in considerable detail exactly how he did secure Mr. Hoover's

office following his death.

W.

R. Wannall

The question of Mr. Iolson's will did arise.

Mr. Mohr advised that Hillory Tolson had not decided whether

he was going to contest the will. According to Mr. Mohr, he

recently had lunch with Hillory Tolson at Mr. Tolson's request

at which time Hillory Tolson suggested he was not going to

contest the will. However, Mr. Mohr had not seen any documentary

evidence of Hillory's decision in this regard.

Finally, the Staff Members asked if Mr. Mohr knew

the whereabouts of Miss Gandy or at least her telephone number.

He told themhhe did know herewhereabouts and telephone number

but promised her he would not reveal

them.

Mr. Mohr was asked

whether Miss Gandy would be available for interview. Mr. Mohr

advised the Committee that he would attempt to persuade her

to be interviewed providing he, Mr. Mohr, was allowed to be

present during the

entire interview. The Staff Members inter-

posed no objection to that arrangement and Mr. Mohr indicated

to Mr. Gitenstein that he would advise him of Miss Gandy's

desires regarding an interview under the conditions stipulated

above.

Prior to the onset of the interview with Mr. Mohr,

Cregar asked Gitenstein whether a decision would be forthcoming

from the SSC regarding the interviews of former employees of the

intelligence community by Staff Members of the SSC.

Gitenstein

stated the the Committee had no problem with the FBI and that if

The White House would not interfere he felt satisfactory arrange-

ments between the FBI and the Select Committee could be worked

out regarding future interviews of former FBI, employees.

The

›thrust of Mr. Gitenstein's comment as well as his genera.

lemeanor during the meeting suggested the Start felt they coulc

work closely with the FBI to the satisfaction of both parties.

DISSERTATION ON PROCEDURES FOR

OPENING, CLOSING AND MAINIAINING

DOMESTIC SECURITY CASES IN PENDING STATUS

FBI authority to investigate domestic security

cases is derived from numerous criminal statutes and

Presidential Directives and Executive Orders concerning

internal security and employee loyaliy matters. Procedurally,

the Bureau opens, continues, and closes such cases on

the basis of these legal considerations.

Upon receipt of a fadc situation from any

of a myriad on sources, an Agent must necessarily nake

a judgment as to whether this situation appears to fall

within che acope of FBI jurisdiction.

More specifically, domestic security investigations

are initiato& when allegacions clearly indicate a person,

either as an individual or as a nembex of a group, acts

to unlawfully alter the Government in violation of the

Smith Act, the Rebellion of Insurrection Statute, the

Seditious Conspiracy Statute, or other related enactments.

Special emphasis is placed on those engaged in violent

furtherance of such illegal aots. A full investigation

continues so long as those indications of illegal activity

crist.

When allegations do not clearly indicate

that activitios on the part of an individual fall within

this jurisdictional area, self-imposed rogulations require

that a "preliminary investigation" be conducted. This

inquiry consists of obtaining infornation from establishco

sources (such as records maintained by police departments,

local governments, and private agencies); informants;

publio source information; and

These invosti-

gations are limited to 90 days during which an honest

effort is made to distinguish as soon as possible between

Legitimate political activity and illegal acts. It

more than 90 days are required to resolve this question,

authority to exceed this period must be obtained from

FBI Headquarters.

In secking this extension, a full

statement must be made of the allegation, the jurisdictional

authority involved, and facts that appear to justify

the continuance.

ATL INEORMATION CONTAINED

DLTT1-19-01 BYSP-FAU

The FBI opens, continues pending investigation, and closes

domestie security cases based on legal considerations. The Bureau is charged

with the investigation of violation of numerous criminal statutes, as well as

duties imposed by Presidential Directives and Executive Orders concerning

internal security and employee loyalty matters.

The procedure for handling such investigation is dictated by

the facts and circumstances of each case. Upon receipt of a fact situation from

any of a myriad of sources, the Agent must necessarily make a judgment to

determine whether these facts reasonably indicate an activity falling within

the scope of the FBI's jurisdiction.

Domestic security investigations are initiated regarding individuals

when allegations establish that he, individually or as an active group member,

acts to unlawfully alter the Government in violation of the Smith Act, the

Rebellion or Insurrection Statute, the Seditious Conspiracy Statute, or other

related enactments. Special emphasis is placed on those practicing action

or violence in furtherance of their goal. If the allegation shows facts clearly

within the scope of these statutes, a full investigation is conducted and continues

so long as facts exist to indicate a reasonable possibility that these ends could

be achieved.

In some instances, allegations regarding the individual do not

clearly fall within the scope of authority. Self-imposed restraining regulations

require that such inquiry be limited to a "preliminary investigation" consisting;

of contacts for informational purposes only with established sources, such as

police bureaus, records departments of local governments, and private record

sources; informants; public source information; and Bureau records. These

investigations are limited to 90 days. An earnest effort is made to distinguish

as soon as possible between mere unorthodox political views or dissent on the

gation beyond that is made only upon approval by Headquarters. If such

continuance is approved, investigation continues to resolve whether juris-

dictional standards are met. If met, and Headquarters' approval obtained, a

full investigation is conducted.

Apart from these situations, specific instructions from the Attorney

General, pursuant to Presidential Directives, to the Director of the FBI concerning

matters of internal security are the basis for investigations. Until the instruction

is complied with, these matters remain pending.

Bureau rules require an Agent to limit investigations to relevant

matters. Field office and Headquarters supervisors review the progress and

relevancy of investigations and reports are forwarded to the Department of

Justice. The FBI is ever aware of and controlled by court decisions interpreting

the law. Agents receive continuing legal instruction in order to recognize relevance

and the rights of persons under the law.

These regulatory procedures are the means by which the FBI

implements the responsibilities imposed by the statutes, Presidential Directives,

and orders of the Attorney General. An examination of the domestie security problems

confronting this Nation would reveal that, as early as 1936, concern arose over

"Fifth Column" activities of Communists and Fascists and continued through WW ll.

This concern has evolved to other threats, through the years, such as the

foreign-dominated Communist influence in America during the Cold War,

the Ku Klux Klan's interference with the rights of others, the turbulent

anti-Vietnam War demonstrations, the urban ghetto riots, and the rise of the

racially-oriented organizations preaching revolution and their more violent

splinter groups practicing open guerrilla warfare. The FBI, charged by statute

and supplemented by Directives to investigate such matters in order to fulfill

the duty, promulgated the investigative procedure for a dual purpose. The

FBI recognizes not only the duty to investigate, to preserve the Constitution,

but the fact the Constitution delineates zones of privacy and individual liberties.

These regulatory procedures speak reasonably to both.

so long as facts exist to indicate a reasonable possibility that these ends could

be achieved.

ATT. INFORMATION CONTAINED

DATE / 19101 BYST

In some instances, allegations regarding the individual do not

clearly fall within the scope of authority. Self-imposed restraining regulations

require that such inquiry be limited to a "preliminary investigation" consisting

of contacts for informational purposes only with established sources, such as

police bureaus, records departments of local governments, and private record

sources; informants; public source information; and Bureau records. These

investigations are limited to 90 days. An earnest effort is made to distinguish

as soon as possible between mere unorthodox political views or dissent on the

one hand and revolutionary and/or criminal activity on the other. If to exceed

90 days, a report is made to FBI Headquarters specifically stating the allegation,

the jurisdictional authority and such facts as would justify continuance of the

investigation. A concurrence of Headquarters is necessary for continuance.

When an allegation is received that a group may fall within the

jurisdictional criteria, Headquarters is immediately notified and investigation

is limited to the "preliminary investigation" as described above. Any investi-

is.

gation beyond that is made only upon approval by Headquarters. If such

continuance is approved, investigation continues to resolve whether juris-

dictional standards are met. If met, and Headquarters' approval obtained, a

full investigation is conducted.

Apart from these situations, specific instructions from the Attorney

General, pursuant to Presidential Directives, to the Director of the FBI concerning

matters of internal security are the basis for investigations. Until the instruction

is complied with, these matters remain pending.

Bureau rules require an Agent to limit investigations to relevant

matters. Field office and Headquarters supervisors review the progress and

relevancy of investigations and reports are forwarded to the Department of

Justice. The FBI is ever aware of and controlled by court decisions interpreting

the law. Agents receive continuing legal instruction in order to recognize relevance

and the rights of persons under the law.

These regulatory procedures are the means by which the FBI

implements the responsibilities imposed by the statutes, Presidential Directives,

and orders of the Attorney General. An examination of the domestic security problems

confronting this Nation would reveal that, as early as 1936, concern arose over

"Fifth Column" activities of Communists and Fascists and continued through WW II.

This concern has evolved to other threats, through the years, such as the

foreign-dominated Communist influence in America during the Cold War,

the Ku Klux Klan's interference with the rights of others, the turbulent

anti-Vietnam War demonstrations, the urban ghetto riots, and the rise of the

racially-oriented organizations preaching revolution and their more violent

splinter groups practicing open guerrilla warfare. The FBI, charged by statute

and supplemented by Directives to investigate such matters in order to fulfill

the duty, promulgated the investigative procedure for a dual purpose. The

EBI recognizes not only the duty to investigate, to preserve the Constitution,

but the fact the Constitution delineates zones of privacy and individual liberties.

These regulatory procedures speak reasonably to both.

the Senate Select Committee (SSC) for additional information.

Attached to the copies of instant memorandum for Messrs. Jenkinsolu

Ash, Moore, and White are copies of the referenced memorandum

and,

enclosure.

The following is to delineate individual responsibili

and assignments for securing the information requested by the SECl

Because the request covers areas of operations affecting all

Divisions of the Bureau except Office of Planning and Evaluation

(OPE), it will be necessary that the very closest coordination and

maximum of cooperation be effected in order to implement the SSC

request.

In handling this request which deals primarily with

furnishing to the SSC of various Sections of the Manual of

mation concerning our filing system, and particularly copies of a

Bureau forms, we should bear in mind that there are available

three options for consideration.

One, is to give the requested

information or documents.

Two, is to not furnish the documents

but merely permit their review

at FBIHQ. A third option availabls

is to set forth justifying data to support a denial of furnishing

the information or documents.

Of course, in furnishing any docu-

From 10:30 a.m. until 2:45 p.m. on May 6, 1975,

Inspector John B. Hotis and I met with Frederick Schwarz, General

Counsel to the Senate Select Committee, Committee staffers Burt Wides,

Pat Shea and Mike Madigan, and CIA representatives

and

Walter Lloyd.

JEK Act 5 (9) 12) (D)

I arranged to attend this conference in an effort to resolve with

the Committee staff the procedures that would be followed during interviews

or current and former Bl employees by star representatives. Interviews

have been conducted in the recent past by representatives of the Committee,

and in the absence of any general understanding as to the procedures we

have been advising those persons coming to our attention as prospective

witnesses that they may request the presence of a Bureau representative

during the interview. Committee staff members have objected to the

presence of Bureau representatives and have insisted that the interviews

proceed in the abeg l any aRE representative.

69-116375-

At the outset of the meeting today, it became clear that Schwarz,

speaking for the members of the Senate Select Committee and for the staff,

was opposed to the presence of agency representatives during interviews

concerning matters which they described as "abuses. " Schwarz explained

that the Committee has a responsibility to look into allegations of misconduct

or abuse in addition to a broader study of the jurisdiction and operations

of the intelligence community. He said that while there would be a willingness

on their part to have agency representatives present during intervrews concern-

ing general inquiries regarding jurisdiction, they felt that it would be

improper and would interfere with the integrity of their investigation i975

Memorandum to Mi

Adams

Re: Senate Select Committee, etc.

Schwarz offered as an alternative that the agencies would be

advised of the identity of persons to be interviewed and that prior to

the interview the agency would contact the witness to explain the authority,

the security arrangements made by the Committee for the protection of

information, to authorize the witness to answer questions where the

witness was bound by a secrecy agreement, and to caution the witness

concerning matters of a sensitive nature which should be deferred for

discussion with members of the Committee or with the Chairman of the

Committee.

I pointed out to Schwarz that unless the FBI was given notice

as to the specific subject matter of the interview to be conducted, we would

find it most difficult to intelligently assess the sensitivity of the information

that might be furnished by the witness. The CIA representatives expressed

great alarm that an interview could disclose information without some

prior assessment of the potential damage to intelligence collection techniques

and sources.

As to these points, Schwarz stated that he would discuss with the

members of the Committee a revision of their initial proposal that

would include notice to the agency of the identity of a person to be interviewed

plus a generic description of the subject matter of the interview followed by

a contact by the agency with the prospective witness to assess the sensitivity

of the information and to advise the witness of areas of inquiry that must be

deferred for special handling by designated members of the Committee or

of the Committee staff. Following that contact the Committee representative

would proceed to conduct the interview with the understanding that the agency

representative would be near-by and immediately available for consultation

should the witness have concern as to the degree of sensitivity of

information he was being asked to furnish. At the conclusion of the

interview, the Committee would make available to the agency a summary

of the notes taken during the interview but a transcription of the interview would

not be made available either to the agency or to the witness interviewed.

Schwarz stipulated that there may be occasions when the Committee

would reserve its right to interview an individual, whether a current employee

or a former employee, in secret in order to protect the interview or to insure

the completeness and accuracy of his information. I asked Burt Wides

whether they had any basis for that concern and he indicated that they

did have such a basis, but declined to specify the details.

Memorandum to Mr. Adams

Re: Senate Select Committee

Inspector Hotis asked whether the on-going interviews

would be delayed pending resolution of the differences concerning

procedures. Schwarz replied that the interviews will proceed due to

time factors. I then requested Schwarz to expedite his discussion

with the members of the Committee, to state their proposals in writing

in order that we could review them in specific detail, and to let me

know as somas their proposal as approved by the Committee was available

for discussion. He agreed to do so and said that probably this could

be accomplished by Thursday, May 8, 1975.

OPINION

It was my impression in dealing with Schwarz that he is making

an honest effort to conduct the Committee inquiry reasonably and that he

is concerned about the public acceptance of the Committee's final product.

His concerns about the integrity of the investigation are similar to those

that Ewould express about an FBI investigation. His insistence that

interviews of individuals concerning possible misconduct be done alone

with the witness appear to me to be reasonable to insure the integrity

of their investigation. The compromise we discussed (they would identify

the witnesses to us prior to interview and tell us the proposed subject

matter of the interview and allow us to consult with the witness prior to

interview) seems to be a practical solution to our mutual problem. This

solution is not as acceptable to CIA due to their greater need for

protection of their covert operations, sources and methods. The Committee

has available to it the subpoena power, the authority to conduct public

hearings, and a good deal of support by public opinion. Therefore, I

conclude that the Committee is likely to discover the full details of

events concerning which they inquire whether the FBI cooperates or

appears to be reluctant. As to those areas of legitimate concern because

of their sensitivity in terms of productionof informants or sources and

methods of gathering national security intelligence, the Bureau can

properly expect an opportunity to provide protection for the information.

If the procedures suggested above are operated in good faith

on both sides, the Bureau would be given notice as to the subject matter

to be discussed prior to the interview and research could disclose the

areas of sensitivity and appropriate action taken to caution the witness

against disclosure of such information.

This morning the Director asked me to inquire into the status

of our understanding with the Senate Select Committee as to whether FBI

representatives would or would not be present at interviéws of former

Bureau employees or current Bureau employees. The Director was

concerned that the presence of a Bureau representative could be criticized

as an attempt to interfere with the Committee's inquiries. I assured the

Director that the purpose of such representatives being present was to

assist the interviewer and the witness in determining areas of inquiry

of particular sensitivity or that might concern a current Bureau operation.

The Director agreed that such was an appropriate reason for the presence

of a Bureau representative and asked me to consider preparing a letter

addressed to Senator Church stating our desire to make available a Bureau

representative and the reasons for the presence of such a Bureau representative.

As a result of a conference with representatives of CIA,

Roderick Hills of the White House Counsel staff, and others, it was

determined that Walter Lloyd of the CIA Legal Staff would continue

negotiations with the Committee in behalf of the entire intelligence

community to develop procedures concerning the interview of witnesses

and the presence of agency representatives at such interviews. Mr. Lloyd

was scheduled to meet with Frederick Schwarz, Counsel to the Committee,

on Tuesday, May 6, 1975, to discuss such arrangements.

formal understanding with Senator Church as to the Bureau's position

lin regard to such interviews. I reminded the Deputy that our sole concern

was to make a representative available to assist in the interviews

in the event they touched upon sensitive areas and by no means was our

interest to be understood to be an effort to interfere with the Senate

Committee's inquiries.

The Deputy said he fully understood our position and agreed.

He asked me whether I would be willing to agree to hold off on formal

notification to Senator Church until the negotiations to be conducted by

Mr. Lloyde could be concluded. I told the Deputy I would agree to that

on the condition that I and also Inspector Hotis would participate in the

discussions by Lloyd with the Committee representatives. The Deputy

Attorney General said that he fully concurred in my condition and if there

developed any difficulty in making such arrangements, he would assist

lin seeing that it was accomplished.

Inspector Hotis advised that Schwarz, the Committee counsel,

has arranged a meeting on Wednesday morning, May 7, 1975, with

Assistant Attorney General Scalia of the Office of Legal Counsel of the

Department. We will also be represented at that meeting.

The Deputy Attorney General told me that he had been advised

by Schwarz that a former Bureau Agent, Leo Clark, had objected to the

fact that a Bureau representative had contacted him and had indicated a

willingness to be present during Clark's interview by the Committee.

I again assured the Deputy that our sole purpose in contacuing Clark was

to be available in the event a Bureau representative was needed to discuss

matters of a sensitive nature or matters concerning current Bureau operations.

The Deputy said he understood and Clark's complaint was likely the result

of a misunderstanding.

At 5:05 p.m. on May 6, 1975, I went to

the White House

Hotigra

to meet with Mr. Philip Buchen, Counsel to the President, Roderick Hills,

Associate Counsel;James Wilderotter, Assistant Counsel; Assistant

Attorney General Scalia, Office of Legal Counsel in the Department;

John Clark, Associate to the Director of CIA; Walter Lloyd and|

of CIA. The meeting was called by Mr. Buchen to discuss the

developments that day with regard to the proposal that agency representa-

tves would be present during interviews conducted by investigators of the

Senate Select Committee statt.

At a meeting held earlier that day, the General Counsel of the

Senate Select Committee had indicated that the Committee disapproved of the

presence of agency representatives at interviews concerning alleged

"abuses. " I explained to Mr. Buchen the alternative proposal offered by

F.A. O. Schwarz to the effect that agencies would be furnished the identitie

of proposed witnesses, the subject matter of the proposed interviews,

and permitted an opportunity to review the subject matter and consult with

the witness to advise him of sensitive areas that would require special

treatment. John Clark agreed that in regard to interviews concerning

abuses, it would seem to be necessary for the Committee to proceed with the

interview without an agency representative present. After general

discussion of the proposal by Schwarz, the meeting concluded with

instructions by Mr. Buchen to Wilderotter to draft a statement that might

be incorporated into a letter to be addressed to the Committee explaining

the Administration's position.

The elements of the proposal would be that as a general

rule, agency representatives would be present during interviews concerning

matters that were not categorized as abuses and in those exceptional cases

Memorandum to Mr. Adams

Re: Senate Select Committee on Intelligence

where abuses would be the subject of interviews, the agencies would be

given prior notice of the identities of the witnesses and of the subject

matter of the interview, plus an opportunity to consult with the witness

prior to the interview. Mr. Buchen also asked that the Committee be

requested to provide a letter in each instance identifying the alleged abuse

as the subject of the interview and indicating Committee approval of

that inquiry. The objective of such a requirement would be to clearly

identify those interviews characterized as "abuses" interviews which would

require the absence of an agency representative during the actual interview.

I was also asked to contact Schwarz to insure that he would not

present to the Committee his counterproposal during the regular committee

meeting on Wednesday, May 7, 1975. The purpose of such a request was

to avoid the Committee adopting a final proposal regarding interviews

prior to the Executive having an opportunity to express its position.

On the morning of May 7, 1975, we spoke with Schwarz, requested

him to refrain from offering his counterproposals to the Committee for

approval, and in response to his request explained to him that the reason

was that the proposals were under discussion and it was necessary for all

agencies in the intelligence community to be involved in the determination

whether the alternative procedures would be acceptable. Mr. Schwarz

agreed to refrain from offering his counterproposals to the Committee today.

At approximately 10:25 a.m. on May 7th, I called Wilderotter

and asked what the progress of his preparation of the proposed letter was.

He told me that there would be no letter addressed to the Committee because

the White House did not desire to escalate this matter and go over the head

of the Committee counsel. I told him that,! was extremely concerned at

the inaction which has resulted thus far in FBI being in an indefensible

position in regard to interviews of former employees. I explained to

him that the Committee has not advised us of the interviews that have been

conducted and we have learned of them only by calls from the witnesses.

I told him that the interviews are still continuing because at the meeting

on May 6, 1975, we expressly requested the Committee counsel to dis -

continue the interviews temporarily until guidelines could be established

and the Committes messly refused to do so.

I told Wilderotter that this morning I received a call from

John P. Mohr, former Assistant to the Director, who has broad knowledge

Memorandum to Mr. Adams

Re: Senate Select Committee on Intelligence

of FBI matters, in which Mohr told me that he has been called to be interviewed

at 10:00 a.m. on Friday, May 9, 1975, at Room G-308 in the New Senate

Office Building. Mark Gittenstein was identified as the interviewer.

I told Wilderotter this concerned me because we have no basis on which

to advise Mr. Mohr as to the appropriate guidelines that may be followed

during the course of such an interview and in the absence of knowledge of

the subject matter of the interview we have no way of counseling him as to

sensitive areas that should be deferred for discussion with members of

the Committee or with the Chairman of the Committee.

Wilderotter said he understood myy concern but he saw no way

in which the matter could be resolved in time for guidelines to be

established for the Mohr interview. He told me he would work on the

preparation of a position paper to be used by the White House and the

intelligence community to establish a policy that could be discussed with

the Committee.

Inspector Hotis and I then at approximately 11:10 a.m. went

to a conference already in session in the office of Assistant Attorney General

Scalia attended by representatives of the CIA, Department of Defense,

NSA, Department of State and the Department of the Treasury. The other

agencies were advised of the results of the meeting with the Senate Select

Committee staff on May 6, 1975, and a general discussion ensued as to

the willingness of the agencies to agree to interviews in the absence of

agency representatives. The representatives of the State Department,

Mr. Hitchcock and Mr. Jennings, indicated that State was adamant that

interviews would not be conducted in the absence of representatives.

I spoke privately with Assistant Attorney General Scalia and

advised him of my conversation with Wilderotter and of the fact that

John Mohr had been called for interview on Friday, May 9, 1975. I

told him of my great concern that Mohr's interview would be sensitive

because of his broad knowledge of the Bureau and told him that it was

essential that appropriate guidelines be developed concerning such inter-

views as soon as possible. Scalia told me that he had just finished

speaking with Wilderotter and he ashared my concern.

He then

called Wilderotter and subsequently advised me that Wilderotter said

that he, Wilderotter, would immediately contact Schwarz to request at

postponement of the interview of John Mohr pending the establishment

of guidelines. In the event he would be unsuccessful, Roderick Hills and

Philip Buchen would discuss the matter with Senator Church and Senator Tower.

Memorandum to Mr. Adams

Re: Senate Select Committee on Intelligence

There was a general consensus of opinion at the meeting with the

other agencies of agreeing that they would await the development of the

position paper by Wilderotter. Walter Lloyd advised that another meeting

with Schwarz and the Committee staff would be scheduled for Thursday,

May 8, 1975.

Upon my return to my office, Wilderotter called me to report

that he had been unsuccessful in having the Mohr interview postponed and

further that Schwarz had advised him that he now feels that it would be

inappropriate for agency representatives to be present at any interviews

whether they concerned abuse or whether they concerned general matters,

and further that he felt that it would be inappropriate for the agency to be

advised of the subject matter prior to the interview.

At that point, Mark Gittenstein joined the conversation with Schwarz &

Wilderotter and advised Wilderotter that he intended to interview Mohr

concerning "procedures and how paper moved in the Hoover days, "

and this would constitute 90% of the interview. The remaining 10% of the

interview would concern Hoover's "O. C. Files." Further Gittenstein

mentioned that he was aware that John Mohr is the Executor of Mr. Tolson's

estate and he may inquire concerning that matter.

Wilderotter said that there would be no further contact with the

Committee concerning the Mohr interview and that we should assume the

Mohr interview will proceed as scheduled. He said that he would suggest

the Bureau contact Gittenstein to discuss any further details regarding the

subject matter of the interview of Mohrad that we consider discussing

with Mohr prior to the interview matters that he should not discuss with

Gittenstein. He also suggested that we debrief Mr. Mohr at the completion

of the interview.

I reminded Mr. Wilderotter that there are no guidelines by which

the White House or the intelligence community or the Senate Committee have

agreed that the FBI should make such arrangements with the witness. I

told him that I thought that the FBI would be used as a test case both by

the Committee and by the intelligence community if we undertook to

negotiate such matters directly with Gittenstein. I told him that I thought

that such direct negotiations would undermine the effectiveness of current

- 4 -

## Page 100

Memorandum to Mr. Adams

Re: Senate Select Committee on Intelligence

negotiations to establish broad guidelines with the concurrence of the

Committee that could be used to effectively limit the scope and manner

of interviews currently being conducted by staff investigators. I also

told him that I thought it would put the Bureau in a most difficult

posture because the intelligence community could well feel that the FBI

had brought about the loss of the opportunity to have some effective

control over Committee access to sensitive information by negotiating

our own agreement with Gittenstein. I told him that certainly the Committee

would use us as an example to other intelligence agencies and use our

experience to their detriment in establishing limitations on the interviews.

Mr. Wilderotter said that he understood my position and he

would continue to work on the policy paper. He asked to be advised of the

time the meeting is to be held with Schwarz on May 8, 1975, and I indicated

I would so advise him on learning of it myself from Walter Lloyd of CIA

who is making the arrangements. I also suggested that it would be appropriate

for Roderick Hills, Associate Counsel to the President, to be present at the

meeting with Schwarz in order to have a greater chance of resolving these

issues promptly. Wilderotter said that he agreed and would attempt to

make arrangements for Mr. Hills to be present at the meeting.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. That the Bureau provide a representative to be available

for consultation by Mr. Mohr as he may request on Friday, May 9, 1975,

at 10:00 a.m., in Room G-308, New Senate Office Building.

Bill cheer Eas

i contains. Moh.

2. That until appropriate guidelines are established' by agreement

between the Committee, the White House, and the intelligence community, the

Bureau not undertake to counsel or debrief Mr. Mohr or any other witnesses

concerning the subject matter of interview, pursuant to agreement with individual

staff interviewers.

the arrest of WILLIAM EDWARD GARRETT (Bureau file 157-

22471; Buffalo file 157-1388) by Bureau Agents at Buffalo,

New York on 10/23/74 at the residence of KARL HAND, 2213

South Bailey Avenue, Buffalo, New York. GARRETT was arrested

based on. an authorized complaint and warrant at Pittsburgh,

Pennsylvania, charging GARRETT with violation of Title 18,

Appendix,

Section 1202(a) (1), USC,,

"Possession of a Firearm

by a Convicted Felon". It should be noted that KARL. HAND

was not present at this arrest and GARRETT was alone in the

house•

In that arrest Buffalo advised the Bureau in

referenced

airtel, dated 10/31/74, of the items observed by

Bureau Agents at time of arrest, which were as follows:

The front windows and door of 2213 South Bailey

Avenue are completely covered with chicken wire. There were

two large German Shepherd dogs on the premises.

Upon entering

the residence a five-gallon can was observed behind the stove.

In the upstairs bedroom

there was a fully-loaded Stevens Model 77B 20-gauge shotgun,

serial number unknown. In the downstairs bedroom there were

several boxes of .22 ammunition and numerous loose 20-gauge

shotgun: shells.

It is noted that memoranda have been prepared by

the SAs: who participated in this arrest of GARRETT on

10/23/14 Including Sa ROBERT N. SHAW, wherein all categorically

deny that any attempt was made to incite GARRETT into doing

anything against his best interests. In addition, all SAs

categorically deny any threat having been made to shoot dogs

found on the premises. It is pointed out that GARRETT waS

alone in the house at

the time of arrest and that at no time

was KARL HAND present.

It is also pointed out for the intormation of the

Bureau that on 11/7/74, U. S. Magistrate EDMUND E. MAXWELL,

BuILalO, New York, released GARRETT and dismissed charge of

violation ef Title 18, Appendix, Section 1202(a) (1), USC.

BY SPRAZ

DATE L-19-01

The Executive Committee, hereinafter referred to as

EXCOM, was chaired by Mr. W. E. Colby in his role as the Director

of Central Intelligence (DCI) •

Present at the meeting were

Mr. Roderick Hills, Counsel to the President; Mr. James Wilderottery

Associate Counsel to the President; Mr. Thomas K. Latimer, Special N

Assistant to the Secretary of Defense, as well as senior officials^

of State Department, National Security Agency (NSA) , Office of

Management and Budget, and the National Security Council.

Mr. Antonin Scalia, Assistant Attorney General, was scheduled

to represent the Department of Justice; however, due to a

scheduling foul up Scalia never made the meeting.

The following matters of interest were discusse

at

this meeting:

SENATOR CHURCH'S STATEMENT

"The Washington Post" edition of 4/10/75 contained the

"results of an interview with Senator Frank Church, Chairman of

the Senate Select Committee (SSC)• According to this article,

Church stated the Committee reserves the right to make public

eventually any documents it receives and is accepting nothing

with "strings attached." Mr. Roderick Hills advised the EXCON

that he and Mr. Wilderotter had a meeting with SSC Staff Director,

William Miller

subsequent to the Church

. statement.

Both Hills

and Wilderotter came away from. this meeting believing the

newspaper report was an overstatement of Church's intent.

Considerable discussion followed Mr. Hills' comments.

Mr. Colby

noted that by letter dated 3/11/75 to Senator Church he confirmed

Memorandum to Mr.

Re:

W.

R. Wannalt

recognized that certain aspects of intelligence activities

must receive special consideration and treatment (a copy of

Colby's letter is attached). By letter dated 3/12/75, Senator

Church confirmed the receipt of Colby's letter and again stated

that in the event the SSC inquiry touches on such sensitive

areas, Senator Church and Colby should discuss jointly what

procedures should be followed (copy of Senator Church's letter

is attached) •

Following the meeting Mr. Wilderotter advised me that

the White House will prepare a letter to Senator Church recognizing

that Congress can, at its discretion, declassify material it

receives but strongly urging that such declassification action

not be taken unilaterally by the Senate Select Committee without

the approval of the agency originating the information.

Wilderotter stated that the White House expected to speak for

the Executive Branch with a strong voice and that individual

agencies should take

no action regarding the Church statement

until the White House has had the opportunity to clear the air

with Senator Church.

SECRECY AGREEMENT AND EMPLOYEE NOTICE

Attached is a copy of a CIA employee bulletin dated

3/12/75. This bulletin relieves CIA employees from the secrecy

agreement should they be interviewed or should they have to

testify before the SSC. At the EXCOM meeting Mr. Wilderotter

suggested all agencies of the intelligence community employing

a secrecy agreement prepare such an employee notice as well as

a letter to Senator Church advising him that the individual

agency was relieving their employees from the secrecy agreement.

Mr. Colby charged the

Security Committee of the United States

Intelligence Board (USIB) with preparing a draft of such a

bulletin and letter for the guidance of member agencies and

departments.

It is the opinion of Assistant Director Mintz concurred iN

by the Intelligence Division that a general letter to all

employees from the Director releasing them from their obligation

under the FBI employment agreement concerning secrecy for

purposes of possible interviews by representatives of the Senate

Memorandum to. Mr.

Re:

W.

R. Wannall

Select Committee would be unwise. It cannot be predicted what

level of FBI employee will be contacted for interview or whether

any employee contacted would have sufficient factual knowledge

in order to provide a full responsive reply to Committee questions.

Moreover, an employee without a full understanding of the material

being inquired about may not be aware of the sensitive nature of

the anewes

the answers that might be given.

As written, the employment agreement provides that

the employee to determine prior to disclosure

whether information may be disclosed and that the Director of

the FBI is in a better position than the

employee to make such

a determination.

Therefore, it is the opinion of Mr. Mintz and

the Intelligence Division that if no general letter of release is

issued to all

employees, any member contacted for interview may

rely upon the provisions of the employment agreement as guidelines

for his or her

appropriate response.

Specifically, such an

employee would be obligated to bring to the attention of the

Bureau any such request for an interview and in addition, he or

she would be obligated to describe the general nature of

inquiry. At such time as request for interviews are made we will

be in a better position to determine whether the employee is

the appropriate person and to evaluate the sensitivity of the

material in question.

REVIEW OF WHITE HOUSE DOCUMENTS: BY SENATORS CHURCH AND TOWER:

Mr. Hills advised that both Senators. Church and Tower

have tentatively agreed to review sensitive White House documents

the SSC is interested in in White House space.

They have tenta-

tively accepted the fact that should they believe such documents

are necessary for retention in SSC files, they will accept a

paraphrase of the original document. This arrangement has not

been completely agreed to by Senators Church and Tower but

Mr. Hills is hopeful such an arrangement can be worked out.

BRIEFING OF THE SSC BY THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY STAFF

Mr. Colby advised that during the week of 4/13/75 he

and Mr. John Clarke, Associate Deputy to the Director of Central

Intelligence for the Intelligence Community, will brief the Senate

Select Committee staff on how the Director of Cental Intelligence

manages the intelligence community. Later in the month, Colby

is hopeful that those senators making up the Committee will also

visit CIA Headquarters for a similar briefing.

KEY ISSUES

My memorandum of 4/7/75 reporting the results of the

last EXCOM meeting identified eleven key issues which the

White House was

particularly interested in (copy of the key

issues attached). As reported in the 4/7/75 memorandum the FBI

has been designated to prepare the paper entitled "Intelligence

Files and Privacy."

Mr. J. Dennis Miller, Legal Counsel Division,

will prepare this paper. He will work with Mr. John Brock,

Office of the Secretary of Defense, as well as Mr. Bob McBrien

of Treasury.

The White House is very interested

in the preparation

of these key issue papers and has asked that the person responsible

for preparing each paper have ready a comprehensive outline as

to how the paper will be constructed on the occasion of the next

EXCOM meeting scheduled for Friday 4/18/75.

THIRD AGENCY RULE

Attached herewith is a paper entitled "Third Agency

Rule" prepared by CIA's General Counsel. It is designed to

acquaint the intelligence community with a background of the

adher agency rule and to insure that all members of the community

to the third agency rule when responding to requests from

the Select Committees of the Congress.

It is to be noted

Mr. Wilderotter expressed the höpe that all agencies in the

intelligence community will respond to a third agency request

within a 48 hour deadline.

Both the military and CIA felt such

a short deadline was impossible but all indicated they would try

to provide responses within 48 hours when clearance to pass

information to the Select Committees of Congress under the

third agency rule is requested.

Memorandum to. Mr.

Re: Senstudy 75

R. Wannall

INTERAGENCY REGISTRY

Attached is a memorandum from Mr. Colby to all USIB

principals dated 4/10/75 describing the establishment Of a

registry to insure that the community is kept informed as to

naterials which will formally be provided to the Select Committe

by all elements of the intelligence community. The Colby

memorandum notes that in order to make the registry useful it

is essential that it include the following:

File copies of documents or other materials which each

intelligence community element provides to a Select Committee

wherein the originating agency considers the material to involve

aspects of community activities. (The Bureau would have very few

items of this nature other than agreements or understandings

the Bureau might have with other elements of the intelligence

community.)

The

second requirement of the registry is that an

abstract of each response to a Select Committee be provided to

the registry for its retention.

The Bureau has already established

a procedure

'for providing such

abstracts to the registry.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. In light of the Church statement in "The Washington

Post" and the subsequent conversations the White House has or

contemplates having with Senators Church and Towery it is

recommended that we continue to disseminate all responses to

the SSC except in those sensitive matters that require close

administrative control. In those instances it is recommended

that we advise the Staff Director that such information responsive

to their request is available at Bureau Headquarters and may be

reviewed by himself or a senior staff member of the SSC.

Dear Mr. Chairman:

This letter will confirm and reduce to writing some

of the matters agreed upon at our recent meeting.

At the outset, I should like to express my deep

personal appreciation for the candor and helpfulness of

you and Senator Tower in that meeting and for your

sensitivity to the respective responsibilities under our

Constitutional framework of the Select Committee and the

Central Intelligence Agency in the area of your review.

For my part, I should like to renew again, for myself and

the CIA, my promise of cooperation with respect to the

important work of the Select Committee. In my judgment,

a spirit of good faith and cooperative effort is not only

necessary to enable your Committee to discharge its

responsibilities fully and expeditiously, but is indeed in

the best interests of the intelligence community as well.

I am convinced that a responsible and thorough review of

U.S. intelligence activities

will serve to vindicate the

CIA and enhance the public's

contribution that the intelligence efforts of this nation

can make toward the goal of preserving and strengthening

our democracy.

I am particularly appreciative of your recognition

that certain sensitive aspects of our intelligence

activities must receive special consideration and treatment

by the Select Committee in the course of your work.

AS

we

discussed, such matters as the identities of our sensitive

sources, the material provided to us by cooperating foreign

intelligence services, the details of technical devices and

systems and of operational methods, the identities of certain

..of our employees who could be targets

of kidnapping or

assassination, the identities of American citizens and

organizations

who have cooperated with U.S. intelligence, and

some additional materials the public disclosure of which would

create serious foreign policy or national security problems,

should be protected not only from exposure, but indeed from

We should also work together to protect

certain other information which, it improperly disclosed,

might impair the privacy rights,of individuals.

Where these

kinds of considerations are present, I anticipate that appro-

priate understandings can be arrived at to avoid the risk of

exposing such matters and at the

same time to satisfy the

Select Committee's need for a full understanding of our

activities.

As I stated to you, employees of the Central Intelligence

will be available to the Select Committee for staff

interviews and for testimony.

As we have discussed, this

might require, in some circumstances, special arrangements to

protect the identity of particular employees whose physical

safety or future career might be placed in jeopardy by exposure.

I anticipate that suitable safeguards can be established to

avoid such dangers.

I assume the Committee will make its own

arrangements with respect to ex-employees as to whom I no

longer have the authority to direct their cooperation.

However,

I am available for whatever assistance I can provide in this

regard.

As you are aware, all employees of the Central Intelligence

Agency

are required to sign a secrecy agreement when they enter

on duty.

This is a condition of employment, and it requires

that they keep forever secret all classified information gained

during the course of their employment.

The secrecy agreement

further requires that they may not disclose classified informa-

tion, either orally or by publication, without prior authoriza-

tion from the Director of Central Intelligence.

Under the

secrecy agreement, an employee's obligations with respect to

the protection of

classified information continue after his

employment with the CIA has been terminated.

NW 65360 Docld:32989532 Page 116

## Page 117

-3-

It is my desire that the secrecy agreements signed by

our employees shall not impair the necessary work of the

Select Committee.

to accomplish this, and in recognition

of the security protection contemplated by the Select

Committee, I have determined that disclosure of otherwise

protected information to the Select Committee or its designated

staff members will constitute an authorized provision of infor-

mation within the meaning of the secrecy agreements. This

Letter may be used to indicate such authorization for any

Agency employee or ex-employee to furnish information to

the Select Committee or appropriate staff members on matters

which would otherwise be covered by their secrecy agreement,

but which are not among the particularly sensitive matters

such

as mentioned above.

sensitive matters, different procedures are obviously neces-

sary.

Accordingly, where any matter included in these sensi-

tive categories would be involved in responding to the Con-

mittee, the employee should express his concern and, if

possible, propose a way of responding to the Committee without

exposing

such sensitive details.

If the Committee believes

that a disclosure of those aspects is nevertheless necessary,

the matter will be discussed between the Committee and the

Agency. I am prepared to consult with the Committee at any

time

to avoid difficulties in this area and quickly determine

together the appropriate course of action to be taken.

With the good faith evident in our discussions on these

matters, I believe that these arrangements will enable me to

discharge my responsibilities to protect intelligence sources

and methods from unauthorized disclosure, while at the same

time to provide the Select Committee with all the information

it needs to accomplish its task.

As we have agreed, it is in the national interest as well

as that of the Select Committee and the U.S. intelligence

community to ensure that your review proceed as smoothly and

as expeditiously as possible.

Toward that end, I have in-

structed all CIA personnel to respond in a spirit of coopera-

tion.

Sincerely,

E. Colby

MEMORANDUM FOR: USIB Principals

SUBJECT:

Community Aspects of Inputs to Congressional

Committees Investigating Intelligence

-

1. The Intelligence Community Staff, with John M. Clarke,

Associate Deputy/IC, as my representative in these matters, will

keep the Board and other appropriate officials advised as to

progress of the investigations conducted by the Senate and House

Select Committees investigating intelligence activities. In particular,

it will ensure that we are kept informed as to materials which are

formally being provided to the Select Committees by all elements

of the Community. The USIB Ad Hoc Group will assist on this

matter and provide the mechanism for regular and constant communi-

cations.

2. In response to this assignment, the Intelligence Community

Staff is establishing a registry for documentation relating to the

investigations. This registry will be a source of reference of all

responses, testimony, et cetera, provided by USIB agencies and

available to your designated representatives.

3. In order to make the registry useful to the Board,

it is

essential that it include:

a. File copies of documents or other materials which

each Intelligence Community element provides to one of the

Select Committees where the originating agency considers

the materials to involve aspects of Community activities,:

and/or which may result in follow-on queries concerning.

the functioning of the Community. The availability of this

documentation will be of particular importance if it is

expected there will be subsequent inquiries relating to the

materials provided and involving elements of the Community

other than the originating element.

BULLETIN

No. 442

12 March 1975

Senate Select Committee To Review

U.S. Intelligence Activities

Senate Resolution 21 established a Select Committee of the

Senate to review U.S. intelligence activities. The Resolution calls

for a comprehensive review of the total U.S. intelligence effort

and is not restricted to the recent charges and allegations against

CIA alone.

Consequently, it is likely to be far-ranging in its impact.

It is in all of our interests to see that the Select Committee

receives full understanding of our activities and their contribution

to the country as expeditiously as possible. I have every confidence

that the inquiry will be responsible, and constructive, and will pro-

duce new understanding of, and improvements in, the American

intelligence system.

It is with this conviction that I have pledged my personal coop-

eration and that of the CIA. I have advised Senators Church and Tower,

the Committee Chairman and Vice Chairman, that employees of the

CIA will be available to the Select Committee for Staff interviews and

for testimony. We are working with the Committee Staff to design

procedures to facilitate their work in examining topics of concern.

Attached to this bulletin is a letter which I have sent to Senator

Church. To facilitate the necessary work of the Committee and in

recognition of the security protection contemplated by the Committee,

I have determined that disclosure of otherwise protected information

to the Select Committee or its designated Staff members will constitute

authorized provision of information within the meaning of the Secrecy

Agreements signed by each CIA employee, subject to the special proce-

dures and limitations set forth in the letter regarding particularly

sensitive matters. Senator Church has agreed that reference to sensi-

tive data in any Committee report will be subject to consultation between

the Committee and the Agency.

NW 65360 Docld:32989532 Page 120

---

## Page 121

The cooperative spirit of our relationship with the Committee

and its Staff must at the same time take account of the rights of

Agency employees. The Committee Staff has agreed to advise

employees of their Constitutional rights at the beginning of any

interview or other appearance.

When a current Agency employee is selected to be interviewed

by the Select Committee Staff, the Staff Director or Chief Counsel

will normally notify Mr. John M. Clarke, who is my principal

liaison with the Committee and its Staff. Mr. Clarke, in turn, will

notify the employee. The purpose of this is in no way to inhibit the

work of the Committee. It is intended to allow time for the employee

to gain general legal guidance if he wants it, and to obtain security

guidance from an appropriate senior officer.

My own belief is that after a careful review of all U.S. intelli-

gence activities, the Committee will address needed legislative

changes and will reaffirm their confidence in the importance and

contribution of U.S. intelligence programs.

Dear Mr. Colby:

On behalf of the Senate Select Committee To Study Governmental

Operations With Respect to Intelligence Activities, I want to thank

your for your letter of March 1l, and the copy of the Employee Bulletin

you have issued to all CIA employees. As we jointly recognize, in

order for the Committee to carry out a thorough inquiry, in accordance

with the mandate,contained in S. Res. 21, the Agency's full cooperation

will be necessary. Your recognition that our mandate authorizes all,

past and present,

agency employees to cooperate fully, and without

impediment due to secrecy agreements, will serve to facilitate oux

expeditious collection of material relative to that mandate.

I particularly appreciate your statement recognizing our security

precautions.

As you know, your staff was very helpful to the Committee's

staff in designing those precautions.

The Staff Director and the Chief Counsel will, under the direction

of the Committee, notify Mr. John Clarke of the members of the Committee

who have been designated to carry out studies, inquiries and investigations

, required to meet the tasks specified in S. Res. 21.

It is the Committee's understanding that the members of the Committee

and designated staff will have access to any and all information which

the Committee determines is necessary for its inquiry. We recognize,

however, that the committee inquiry may touch on sensitive areas, such

as the identity of CIA personnel, sources, or cooperating organizations

whose disclosure could place persons in actual jeopardy. In the event

that the Committee inquiry touches on such sensitive areas, which matters

we have already discussed in our meeting of February 27, we shoula discuss

jointly, and as you suggest quickly, what procedures might be followed

should the Committee decide it requires more information in these specific

areas.

The Third Agency Rule

1. As early as November 1953, the third agency rule was included

in Executive Order 10501, which has now been revoked. Section 7(c)

prohibited the dissemination of "classified defense information originating

in another Depariment or agency" to an agency "outside the receiving

Department or agency without the consent of the originating Department

or agency." The only exception to this rule is that dissemination may be

made under the authority of Section 102 of the National Security Act. This

section authorizes the Director of Central Intelligence "to correlate and

evaluate intelligence relating to the national security, and provide for the

appropriate dissemination of such intelligence within

the Government using,

where appropriate, existing agencies and facilities. "

2. Historically, the responsibility of the Director of Central Intelli-

gence to disseminate intelligence has referred to "finished intelligence."

This product is the end result of contributions from members of the Intelli-

gence Community. Therefore, in this situation the finished product is a

homogenous product and therefore the approval for further dissemination

beyond the receiving agency must come from the Director of Central

Intelligence.

3. Executive Order 10501 was superseded by Executive Order 11652

which became effective 1 June 1972. This Executive order did not specifically

cover the third agency rule. However, it does provide the following controls:

Sec. 9. Special Departmental Arrangements. The originating Department or

other appropriate authority may impose, in conformity with the provisions of

this order, special requirements with respect to access, distribution and

protection of classified information and material, including those which

presently relate to communications intelligence, intelligence sources and

methods and cryptography.

4. In anticipation of the implementation of Executive Order 11652, a

directive was issued on May 17, 1972 entitled "National Security Council

Directive Governing the Classification, Downgrading, Declassification and

Safeguarding of National Security Information. " This directive does not

contain the term "third agency rule" but does have four subsections which

relate to procedures which are similar to what historically had been called

the third agency rule. These sections are:

A. (2) Determination of Need-to-Know. In addition to a

security clearance, a person must have a need for access to

the particular classified information or material sought in

connection with the performance of his official duties or

contactual obligations. The determination of that need shall

be made by officials having responsibility for the classified

information or material.

NW 65360 Docld:32989532 Page 125

---

## Page 126

D. Consent of Originating Department to Dissemination by

Recipient. Except as otherwise provided by Section 102 of the

National Security Act of 1947, 61 Stat. 495, 50 U.S.C. 403,

classified information or material originating in one Department

shall not be disseminated outside any other Department to which

it has been made available without the consent of the originating

Department.

E. Dissemination of Sensitive Intelligence Information.

Information or material bearing the notation "WARNING NOTICE --

SENSITIVE INTELLIGENCE SOURCES AND METHODS INVOLVED":

shall not be disseminated in any manner outside authorized

channels without the permission of the originating Department

and an assessment by the senior intelligence official in the

disseminating Department as to the potential risk to the national

security and to the intelligence sources and methods involved.

F. Restraint on Special Access Requirements. The establish-

ment of special rules limiting access to, distribution and

protection of classified information and material under Section 9

of the Order requires the specific prior approval of the head of

a Department or his designee.

5.

Examples of the application of the third agency rule are:

(a) In a national security estimate, contributions are

received from all members of the Intelligence Community, then

disseminated to members of the community under the authority

of the DCI. Recipients may not disseminate the estimate outside

the Intelligence Community without the approval of the DCI;

(b) A CIA intelligence report disseminated to the State

epartment may not be sent by the State Department to th

epartment of Commerce without the permission of the CIA

(c) Information which the CIA furnishes the Eresident's

Commission may not be disseminated to other agencies or to the

Congress without the concurrences of CIA. Thus, a request

from the Congress to the Commission for CIA information should

be referred to CIA for action so that the necessary protection of

the information can be insured;

NW 65360 Docld:32989532 Page 126

… .

---

## Page 127

(d) If the Navy Department discusses one of its operations

with CIA, CIA may not include information about that operation

in papers it disseminates to other agencies unless it has

received the permission of the Navy Department. The distinc-

tion here is that a Navy operation would not be considered part

of the finished intelligence mechanism and therefore would

not fall within the statutory authority of CIA to disseminate

intelligence;

(e) If a State/DOD joint cable is disseminated to CIA, CIA

may not send the information to the FBI until CIA has received

the concurrence of both State and DOD.

During various contacts with William Miller, Staff Director of

the Senate Select Committee, and Congressman Lucien Nedzi (D-Mich.),

Chairman of the House Select Committee, the question has come up regarding

the need for a check of the private offices of individual Committee Members to

assure the absence of any electronic listening devices. The Committee

personnel have been told that we consider this absolutely essential and they

agreed.

In exploring this matter, it was determined that the Capitol

Police Department recently has established a special unit to handle all types

of security problems within the Capitol Hill complex, including checks for

electronic listening devices. Personnel of this unit have received extensive

training, some from CIA. The operations of the unit are controlled through

the Sergeant me e one an one an eul coite Pain get.

This matter has been discussed with Robert Hough, Deputy a

Sergeant at Arms of the Senate, and with Kenneth Harding, Sergeant at Arms

of the House. Hough advised that the special unit already has conducted com-

plete security surveys of the new office space of the Senate Select Committee

and certainly will perform any other checks of this type needed by the Committee

or its individual Members. He said, in fact, that since they now have this

capability they would oppose any outside agency coming on to the lato pertorm

this function. Hough said he already has been in contact with Miller regarding

the necessary security chefstand stated he will let us know whentegrigera

the Senate Select Committee/have been checked. He said their rules require

specitic requests from the individual Members in writing.

Inspector Bowers who will continue to follow this situation with Senate

Sergeant at Arms, William Wannall, or his Deputy; House Sergeant at Arms

ADDENDUM:

INTELLIGENCE DIVISION

WOC:ekw 4/14/75

On 4/11/75 the Executive Committee of the Ad Hoc

Coordinating Group on Congressional Review for the Intelligence

Community was apprised of the discussions with Mr. Robert Hough,

the Deputy Sergeant at Arms of the Senate and with Mr. Kenneth

Harding, Sergeant at Arms of the House. Although the Executive

Committee would have preferred the FBI to conduct audio sweeps,

they interposed no objection to the sweeps being handled by the

Capitol Police Department. Mr. Roderick Hills, Counsel to the

President, requested, however, that both Mr. Hough and Mr. Harding

be requested to periodically advise the FBI as to the sweeps of

Committee space for electronic listening devices.

Specifically,

Mr. Hough and Mr. Harding should be asked to furnish the FBI the

following: How frequently they will conduct a counteraudio sweepg

what offices will be swept, will the results of such sweepsbe

furnished the FBI, and will the FBI be immediately notified should

the Capitol Police locate an electronic listening device?

(TAC) for all investigative and any other FBI employees who have

ever had GIRs issued to them.

The TACs are retained indefinitely

as there is no provision for their destruction. For every voucher

processed, there is recorded the voucher period, amount of voucher,

date processed and record of any GIRS 1854 116395-115

The IAC for Whitson piveals entries to show that

12/9/64 a voucher was processed for payment to Whitson in the

suin

of $19.40 for travel during the period 11/1-30/64.

With that

voucher was a memorandum copy of a GTR issued 11/21/64 to National

Airlines in the sum of $107.40 for air coach travel, Washington, D.C.,

to Miami and return. Attached to instant-memorandum-is a Xerox of

retained in the Voucher Unit, is readable. The markings or

the reverse side of the Xerox have no bearing on the date of

travel but are merely entries relative to the payment to National

Airlines. It might be noted that the issue date of this GIR,

11/21/64, has been determined to be a Saturday, which is the

day of the week Whitson recalled making the trip to Miami.

According to Cox, the Bureau does not maintain copies

Memorandum captioned as above 4/23/75 reported on

interview of Mc. Whitson by Michael Epstein, staff member of

Whitson telephoned my office twice this morning. At 10:35 a.m.

he advised that Epstein had asked him by telephone how Whitson had

made the trip to Miami, meaning how it was paid for. Whitson told

him he had issued a Government Transportation Request (GTR). Epstein

asked whether there was any prior written authorization for Whitson

to make this trip and Whitson

told him there was none.

Epstein

asked what kind of record would have been made covering the trip.

Whitson explained that the only record that he knew of would be

the expense voucher he submitted covering the expenses involved

and possibly the copy of the GTR which he had issued. He explained

to Epstein the voucher would merely show the GIR had been issued

for a round-trip to Miami and how much per diem had been claimed

in connection with the trip.

In advising of the foregoing, Whitson stated it was his

recollection he had made

• the Miami

trip either in the late Summer

or early Fall of 1964 and that Martin Luther King was "away" at

zing tac

the time.

In my absence from the office, Whitson called again at

11:05 a.m. to say that Mr. Epstein asked him as to whether he had

registered at the Airport Hotel in Miami and, if so, whether it was

under his own name.

under his own name at this hot@REC-100:

DESTRUCTION OF BUREAU FILES

AND RECORDS

Re my memorandum to you dated 2-14-75.

As indicated in referenced memorandum, the Bureau's

program concerning destruction of files and records has been suspended

until we can determine whether it involves any documents that might

be of interest to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities.

We contacted William G. Miller, Staff Director for the

Committee, and he asked that we withhold further destruction of files

until the Committee Counsel, who had not been appointed at that time,

had an opportunity to review the matter. Mr. F. A. O. Schwarz 30,

a New York attorney, was recently named the Committees Chief Counsel.

It is recommended that representatives of the Files and Communications

Division and the Legal Counsel Division meet with Mr. Schwarz and

Mr. Miller at the earliest opportunity to resolve this matter.

RECOMMENDATION:

That representatives of the Files and Communications

Division and the Legal Counsel Division meet with the Chief Counsel

and Staff Director of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities

to determine whether the Bureau's destruction program can be reinstituted.

telephonically advised on 4-23-75 that former Section Chief Fred Baumgardner.

had been contacted by Michael Epstein, staff member of the Senate Select

Committee, and Epstein had sought to arrange an interview of Baumgardner.

SAC Kitchens advised Baumgardner requested that a Bureau representative

be present during his interview. SAC Kitchens further advised that Baumgardner

will telephonically contact SA Paul V. Daly on 4-24-75.

On 4-24-75 at 2:30 p.m., former Section Chief Baumgardner

telephonically related that he had been requested to come to Washington for

the purpose of being interviewed by Michael Epstein, staff member of the

Senate Select Committee. Baumgardner advised Epstein that he would make

himself available for interview but at his office at 970 South 4th Street, Louisville,

Kentucky, telephone number 584-5183. Mr. Baumgardner expressed concern

regarding the interview pointing out that he was Section Chief in the Intelligence

Division for some 18 years and during the time was continually dealing with

very sensitive matters which he felt were not the proper subject matter of discus-

sion

with people outside the FBI. Additionally, he pointed out he has been

out of the Bureau for some eight years and since he is not aware of current

Bureau operations he, therefore, requested the Bureau have a representative

present during the interview and that the Bureau representative so designated

be thoroughly familiar with Intelligence Division operations so that he might

be made aware of those areas which are sensitive and might compromise

current Bureau investigations. He suggested that the Bureau representative

should arrive sometime the day before the proposed interview which is

|| 4-29-75 so that he may have a preliminary discussion with the Bureau repre-

sentative concerning those areas in which he has knowledge of and may be

sensitive.

Re:

Memorandum Cregar to Wannall dated 4/14/75 reported

that Mr. J. Dennis Miller of the Legal Counsel Division was

preparing the key issue paper entitled "Intelligence Files

A copy of the outline for this paper was

presented to the EXCOM with the commitment that a draft of

the paper would be ready for review in the next two to three

weeks.

Another key issue paper is one being prepared by

Mr. Warren D. Magnusson of CIA entitled "G. A. O. and the Audit

Authorities of U. S. Intelligence Agencies."

Mr. Wilderotter

suggested Mr. Magnusson consult with the FBI inasmuch as

the Bureau was currently being audited by GAO.

Mr. Robert

Finzel of the Intelligence Division maintains liaison with

GAO representatives auditing the Intelligence Division.

Mr. Finzel's name will be furnished Mr. Magnusson for

consultation purposes in line with the suggestion from

Mr. Wilderotter.

WHITE HOUSE RESPONSES TO SSC REQUESTS

Enclosed is a copy of a memorandum from James A.

Wilderotter to Mr. John Clarke dated 4/16/75. The memorandum

advises that the White House provided copies of the Colby

report : (including annexes), as well as a list of documents

to the Senate Select Committee on 4/14/75. The Colby report

is the document prepared for the President following the

Seymour Hersch articles which appeared in "The New York Times"

alleging CIA was engaged in massive domestic surveillances.

GUIDELINES FOR PARAPHRASING CERTAIN DOCUMENTS PROVIDED TO

THE SELECT COMMITTEES

Memorandum Cregar to Wannall dated 4/7/75 attached a

copy of sanitization guidelines for documents provided to

Congressional Select Committees.

Attached to this memorandum

are new guidelines entitled "Guidelines for Paraphrasing

Certain Documents Provided to the Select Committees."

In

essence the attachment is almost identical to the sanitization

guidelines. The reason for the change is the White House

prefers the word "paraphrase" rather than "sanitization." Thus,

guidelines under the paraphrasing description were promulgated.

•GUIDELINES FOR PARAPHRASING SENSITIVE INFORMATION IN

CERTAIN DOCUMENTS PROVIDED SELECT COMMITTEES

HORT CON

#MDRIG

ALI, RET

I. The Director of Central Intelligence has recently discussed

with Senator Church the need for special consideration and treatment

by the Select Committee of certain sensitive aspects of intelligence

activities and the Senator has expressed his recognition of this need:

It is anticipated that appropriate arrangements can be made so as to

avoid the risk of exposing such matters and at the same time satisfying

the Select Committees' need for a full understanding of the intelligence

community's activities. Included in such matters are the identities of

sensitive sources, the material provided to the United States by •

cooperating foreign intelligence services, the details of technical

devices and systems and of operational.methods, the identities of

certain employees whose safety could be jeopardized if revealed, the

identities of American citizens and organizations who have cooperated

with US intelligence and some additional materials the public disclosure

of which would create serious foreign policy or national security

problems. Such material should be protected not only from exposure

but indeed the risk of exposure. Further, recognition should be given

to the need to protect certain other information which, if improperly.

disclosed, might impair the privacy rights of individuals.

2. Proper procedures should enable intelligence community

members to prevent risk of disclosure of sensitive sources and

•methods and at the same time present to the Select Committees the

necessary details to allow for their proper understanding of community

activities.

3. The procedures described herein are not to be used as

downgrading or declassification guides. All concerned should be

mindful that application of these procedures will not declassify,

downgrade or remove from compartmentation controls any documents

or information provided the Select Committees, unless individual

advice to that effect is provided as well.

4.

" What May Be Paraphrased

While it is not possible to anticipate all requirements which

may be levied by the Committees for documenting material and not

NW.65360 Docld:32989532 Page 166

---

## Page 167

possible to determine specifically what material should be excised

from these documents, the following illustrations are offered in

certain likely categories.

The criteria in all cases should meet

the test mentioned above.

5. Collection of Intelligence

(a) The Committees will probably address the matter of how

intelligence is collected.

Documents supporting responses may be

paraphrased by removal of identities of sensitive agents and informants,

covert personnel, and contractual cover arrangements. A descriptive

phrase may be substituted, i.e., a foreign journalist, a political

official in the opposition party. No paraphrasing should be used in

connection with names of individuals whose employment or former

employment by, or association with a department or agency, does not

remain secret or for individuals whose present or 'future activities on

behalf of the department or agency do not require that previous cover

arrangements remain secret.

(b) Some information may be required with respect to

- technical intelligence systems including cryptologic and communi-.

cations activities and reconnaissance capabilities. Almost all of

such material is currently handled in compartmentation control

channels under various codewords or nicknames. No security threat

'is perceived by use of these codenames or nicknames in classified

documents. Details of the technical systems which would reveal

critical operational capabilities and contractual and funding arrange-

ments which would identify individuals whose participation was

obtained under agreement of continued secrecy may be excised from

documents. Any question on release of codeword material should be

referred to the Program Manager who in turn may consult with the

Director of Central Intelligence to ensure a consistent approach in

the Community's paraphrasing procedures. While documentary

samples of intelligencé obtained by technical means may be used

in support of testimony, special consideration should be given with

regard to raw products which reveal critical operational capabilities.

NW 65360 Docld:32989532 Page 167

---

## Page 168

6. Intelligence Estimates

Finished intelligence reports and estimates do not usually

contain source identifications and will not normally require para-

phrasing. However, departments and agencies should review such

publications to ensure deletion of sensitive source identities and

details of collection systems.

7. Administration

Information concerning the administration of intelligence.

agencies may be required. This may include staffing charts with

occupants identified. Identities of personnel formerly not under

cover and now functioning in a cover assignment should be deleted

as well as those who may in the future be considered for a covert

assignment.

8.

General

:. :

The following categories of information or specific examples

may arise in any number of circumstances in documentation re-

quested by the Select Committees. In all cases, serious consideration

should be given by the department or agency concerned to the necessity

• of deletion or paraphrasing of this type of information, prior to

providing the document.

(a) Agent or informant names or operational information

revealing them.

(b) Details which would reveal sensitive methods and

techniques (1) employed in human source collection, (2)

employed for the physical security protection of the

department's or agency's personnel or physical environment.

•(c) The numbers, locations, times and other indications

of recruitment, attempted recruitment or emplacement of

personnel within targeted foreign organizations.

NW 65360 Docld:32989532 Page 168

---

## Page 169

(d) Names of particular employees whose physical

safety or future careers might be placed in jeopardy by

exposure.

(e) Foreign or US sources, official or otherwise who

agreed to cooperate under terms of explicit or implied

confidentiality, who would be embarrassed or

endangered

by disclosure of their role.

(f) Assumed identities, locations or other information

permitting identification of defectors or refugees who might

be targeted for retaliation.

(g) Identifying information on intelligence services of

friendly and neutral countries and collaboration of those

services with US intelligence agencies.

(h) Identification of technical foreign intelligence

operations of high vulnerability or extremely high political

sensitivity.

(i) Details of arrangements with US and foreign banks,

investment houses, etc., in support of intelligence operations.

•(5) Specific information on special relationships with

private firms established with the approval of top corporate

officials.

This includes names of firms or industrial

associations that collaborate in a special manner such as

providing cover for foreign intelligence operations.

(k) Names of firms collaborating with US intelligence

agencies in collection and assessment programs (especially

those having large foreign clienteles).

(1) Proprietary, trade secret or patent information.

NW 65360 Docld:32989532 Page 169

9.

Techniques of Paraphrasing

. Paraphrasing of intelligence material may include the

physical removal of the identity of a person, place or thing from

written communication with or without regard for the residual

content. Use of a substitute terms is an example of paraphrasing

which permits intelligent continuity of the material without revealing

the true identity. Paraphrasing does not extend to the use of false

or misleading substitute material..

The integrity of official records must be maintained. The

following paraphrasing techniques apply only to copies of records.

(a) Names may be obliterated, masked or replaced

with substitute terms, the residual material xeroxed and

the copy submitted to Committees.

(b) The material can be retyped or reprinted with

substitute phrases or substitute descriptions which ao noi

reveal the sensitive material.

(c). Entire pages can be removed from some documents

and replaced with a blank page carrying only reference

'information as to the location of the sensitive material

within the contributing department or agency.

(d) Within a category of inquiry, it may be desirable

to extract a complete document from requested material when

the request is broad and all-inclusive within its field. The

existence of such a document should be made known to the

Committees but retained by the agency or department for

review under escort of a representative of the department

or agency.

10: Management of Documents

The original record and a copy of the paraphrased version

provided should be readily available in all cases. Materials developed

within an agency or department in response to requests should be

5

NW 65360 Docld:32989532 Page 170

---

## Page 171

reviewed at an appropriate level for completeness, responsiveness

and accuracy. In the case of documents or materials of a community

nature, the release should be done in coordination with the depart-

ments or agencies and/or the Program Manager concerned an any

paraphrasing should be agreed upon during coordination.

This proposed use of paraphrasing as a special arrangement

to protect selected issues contained in material provided to Select

Committees by one agency may prove to be a futile exercise if not

practiced in common by all participating departments and agencies.

It is essential to the proposal that departments and agencies attempt

to employ the same criteria for paraphrasing and coordinate as

required.. This paper can

serve only as general guidelines.

RECEIVED

APR 1 4 1975

CRIMINAL DIVISION

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

agencies engage in electronic surveillance and the extent

of such surveillance:

At a hearing on May 23, 1974, before the Subcommittee

on Administrative Practice and Procedure, Attorney General

- Saxbe testified on this subject. I asked him: "Can you

tell us about any other organizations or government

•departments that are involved in any wiretapping at all

today?" The Attorney General replied: "We do not believe

that there is anyone else and the penalties are rather

severe." (p. 495) I am enclosing a copy of the hearings

for your convenience:

The recent reports raise questions concerning the

completeness and clarity of Attorney General Saxbe's

earlier testimony. President Johnson's executive memorandum

of June 30, 1965, requires that federal agencies engage in

wiretapping only with the prior approval of the Attorney

General.

In order to fully answer the questions that have

BONDS

been raised, I request that you provide the Subcommittee.on

Adninistrative Practice and Procedure with the following

information by April 16:

7-0%

1. A list of all federal departments, agencies, bureaus,

divisions, and other units that conduct, have conducted, or have

authority to conduct electronic surveillance of any:type (including

wiretaps, bugs, anc other uses of any device of apparatus which

•can be used to intercept a vire or oral communication).:

number of electronic surveillances in place at any time during

the calendar years 1970 through 1974 (with a description of

2o through 137 cach a

the method used in.computing these figures).

I am sure you appreciate the need for the questions

raised by Attorney General Saxbe's testimony to be answered

as quickly and definitively as possible. These questions

demonstrate once again the need for close cooperation between

the Department of Justice and the Congress.

Many of the questions posed in this letter were originally

raised in my letter of October 10, 1973, to Attorney General

Richardson.

The Subcommittee requested additional information

on April 16, 1974, and at the hearing on May 23, 1974. Attorney

General Saxbe indicated a willingness at the hearing to

provide this information in the near future, but none of

this information has been provided. I am enclosing copies

of the October 10, 1973, and April 16, 1974 correspondence

:Dear Mr. Attorney General:

As you know, the Subcommittee on Administrative Practice

and Procedure has played an active role in the area of

electronic surveillance over the past several years, including

its role in the development and processing of the legislation

which eventually beccme Title IIt ot the nibus Crime Control

and Sate Streets Act of 1963 and its hearings on warrantless:

wiretapping last year.

-Un February 5, 19/1, I wrote Attorney General John Mitchell

seeking certain intormation about electronic surveillance instal-

•lations without court orders.

The Department was good enough to

provide me with most of the information I sought.

The information

extended by the Department was extremely usetul in enlightening

both the Connittee and the public about the extent and signfi-

cance of such surveillance.

The information sought and supplied dealt only with the

perzod June 19, 1968 through calendar year 1970. Since then,

of course, the

United States Supreme Court has held that

domestic security surveillance without a court order is uncon-

stitutional, United States V. United States District Court,

407 U.S. 291 (1972)•

which a detailed inquiry was made into the Justice Department's

practices and procedures in implementing the decision.

At the

-hearings,

Deputy Assistant Attorney Gencral Kevin Maroney

testitied

that in response to the Supreme Court ruling; a certain

number of installations "in cases involving domestic security,"

to use the description in Mr. Kleindienst's statement of

June 19, 1972, were terminated.

In a letter dated August 2, 1912,

Mc. Maroney indicated the numbers of surveillances in. place

I realize that I am requesting a substantial amount of

information, but as you can well understand, this is a matter

.. of great

current public significance. It Is not only

important that the congress be kept fully informed, but also

that the public be reassured that the Attorney General has full

knowledge and control over the mechanisms of our government

that directly airect the constitutional rights of our citizens.

Accordingly, I am transmitting this letter in the spirit of

cooperation

between the Department and the Congress stressed

by Deputy Attorney General Ruckleshaus at. his contirmation

hearings beiore the Judiciary Committee.

"I very much appreciated the promptness of the Department's

response to my initial inquiry two years ago.

that much of the intormation requested in this letter is readily

available. Insofar as some of the intormation may not be

immediately available,

a prompt response with respect to such

DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENG

WASHINGTON, D. C. 20505

29 APR 1975.

The Honorable Frank Church

Chairman

Select Committee to Study Governmental

Operations with Respect to Intelligence

Activities

United States Senate

Washington, D. C. 20510

Dear Senator Church:

I believe it would be useful if I placed on the record the

situation with respect to your l2 March request. I regret

that you considered it necessary to issue public criticism of

CIA's efforts tò meet*

your needs. As of this writing, the major

portion of that request for CIA-originated material has been

met and, I believe, in a responsive manner.

At our meeting of 22 April, we agreed that if your

investigators could review materials at the CIA Headquarters,

it would expedite the inquiry and lessen the amount of material

which otherwise would have to be paraphrased, a process which

takes a substantial amount of time. Special office space and access

badges have been provided for this purpose. I agreed that, should

specific documents or parts thereof be requested to be sent to

the Senate Select Committee offices, the Agency would prepare

these as expeditiously as possible without sacrifice to the

security considerations consistent with our earlier understanding

of the need to protect sources and methods from undue risk of

exposure: I also gave you my assurance that we would assist in

the clearance of multi-agency papers involving CIA, some of

which are on your earlier request.

A speed-up in the Agency's paraphrasing process is

being undertaken, although as you can appreciate, this involves

senior personnel with heavy demands for substantive work, and

## Page 187

the volume of the material you have requested is considerable.

At our meeting, I showed you a list of the materials that have

already been provided, and Mr. Miller has been kept advised

about the status of other materials.

In discussing some of the concerns of people in the

Intelligence Community about the procedures addressed above,.

you agreed to raise with the Committee the question of ultimate

disposition of materials provided. I understand that this is in

train. In this connection, I was very much appreciative of your

reassurance that you and the Committee members will consult

with me prior to the release of any classified materials in

public statements or unclassified reports of the Committee.

Such consultation is consistent with the spirit of the inquiry.

I believe our staffs are working well together. There

have been the usual inherent problems that one can expect in

an investigation of this scope'. Because the Select Committee

staff personnel engaged in the inquiry are relatively new to the

field of intelligence and to the seriousness of the inquiry,

expectations re ambitious. But there is something to be said

for both sides of the equation. For example, we await the

convenience of your investigators on selective follow-up matters

on which they had requested further data. Meanwhile, we have urged

and are providing the staff with detailed briefings by way of introduction

to the Agency's history and functions. I am personally convinced

that direct discussions about our work and about specific instances

of interest to the staff investigators will be far more direct and

projuctive to them (saving us much useless work) than engaging

in debates about massive document transfer requests.

Io that end, I am very anxious to renew and by this letter

I would repeat my request to you that the Committee move

personally and directly into the inquiry at an early date. I am

delighted that you and the Committee are coming to visit our

headquarters for a discussion of the Intelligence Community

and the Agency and for an exchange on the precise interests which

2.

NW 65360 . Docld:32989532 Page 187

---

## Page 188

particular Committee members have concerning the inquiry. We

need to understand the specific objectives the Committee seeks

and relate these to the priorities of the materials you will need.

I believe we can be helpful if we know these. Again, I am convinced

that the constructive long-term contributions that we both envisage

from the Select Committee's work will derive in a far more concrete

fashion by focusing on specific and major questions about intelligence

rather than consuming an inordinate amount of time reviewing the

details of all of our past history. In that way our main energies

and our judgment can be addressed to what kind of intelligence we

want in our free society of the future, rather than what we may

have had in the past..

Sincerely,

W. E. Colby

Mr. William E: Colby

Director of Central Intelligence

Central Intelligence Agency

Washington, D. G. 20505

Dear Director Colby:

On. behalf of the Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental

Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities, I enclose a

specification, furnished to John Clarke yesterday, which calls for

certain material referred to in your December 24, 1974 report to

the President and provides further detail concerning certain CIA

material heretofore requested. Obviously it is not intended to

• Limit what we have already requested.

It is the Conmittee's expectation that all this material

should be produced in ten days.

I was heartened by the spirit of cooperation demonstrated in

your personal reassurances in our meeting on April 22, 1975, and

I understand that substantial material was made available to us

today at the CIA. However, the fact remains that too much material

called for in our document request remains outstanding and the

system apparently being employed to clear material for us builds

in excessive delays. A necessary prerequisite to our inquiry

proceeding expeditiously-as it should to restore public confidence

in our intelligence agencies and develop a new national consensus

on the proper functions of intelligence activity-is to eliminate

these delays.

Sincerely you
