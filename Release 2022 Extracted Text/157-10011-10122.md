MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Charles W. Wiley
Summary of Termination
#343 589
#127 958

1. During the course of the reorganization of the
Office of Security, it was decided that the Security
Research Staff would be abolished. This decision led to
the preparation of a memorandum for the Director of Security
from the Chief, Security Staff, dated 1 June 1973, captioned,
"Request for Director of Security Assessment Regarding
Continuance of Functions and Possible Replacement." The

@ last. paragraph of this memorandum stated:

"For immediate planning purposes, to fulfill
the early deadline already established, it would
be eppreciated if you would review the attached
eutiines of existing functions and indicate your
desires regarding the function (continue, continue
with low priority, discontinue) and where you wish
any retained functions to be placed in the reorgani-
zation structure. In the latter instance, I have
attempted to indicate the more likely options for
this to facilitate ycur assessment."

2. On 4 June 1973, the Director of Security indicated
that "Special Access Source," Charles Wiley, should continue
on a low priority and be transferred to the Operational
Support Branch.

3. Shortly after the implementation of the reorganiza-
tion on 1 August 1973, John Dempsey, Chief, Research Branch,
verbally discussed and reviewed with Edwal Jones, Chief,
Clearance Division, the disposition of certain SRS functions

a still in the possession of the Research Branch, but
recommended and approved for transfer to other components
of the Office of Security, Among those items discussed
was "Special Access Source," Charles Wiley. Messrs. Jones
and Dempsey agreed that Wiley was not worth the money spent,
performed little or no useful service for the Office of
Security and, in fact, had done little or nothing to justify
his keep. It was further agreed that Mr. Jones would discuss
Wiley and make known to the Deputy Director of Security (PSI),
Stanton Ense, the agreed assessment of Wiley. :

4. Mr. Jones next informed Mr. Dempsey that a memorandun
should be prepared reviewing the Wiley case, making recommenda-
tions as to disposition. A memorandum was then prepared by
Louis Vasaly of the Reseerch Branch, dated 18 September 1973,
which recalled the history of Wiley's association with the
Office of Security with a recommendation for termination.

The only disagreement was as to timing. Mr. Dempsey recom-
mended 30 June 1974; Mr. Jones, 1 February 1974. The Deputy
Director of Security (PSI) agreed with the latter termination
date.

- 5. On 25 uctober 1973, is Vasaly aid John bempsey,

both of the Research Branch, met Wiley at the Key Bridge

r ] Marrictt Motel, Arlington, Virginia, to effect his termina-
tion. filey was most unhappy with the proceeding although
Claiming to understand that budget problems and curtailment
of domestic activities led to his separation. He acknowledged
that written notice of his termination by his signature;
however, he appended that the notice was "signed with the
reservation that the terms will be appealed," and stating he
would seek redress either with the Director of Central
Intelligence of contacts on Capitol Hill.

6. Wiley was contacted twice more on 6 November 1973
and on 12 February 1974, both times in New York City, by
Sidney Stembridge, Deputy Director of Security (P§M) and
Louis Vasaly. At the former meeting, Mr. Stembridge politely
explained to Wiley that CIA is no longer engaged in matters
in which he had been assisting and that there was, therefore,
no further need for his services, Mr. Stembridge indicated
that the Office of Security might be able to assist financially
in a limited sense beyond the 31 January termination date, but
that would be the limit of any help. :

7. On the latter occasion, Mr. Stembridge informed
Wiley that he had been awarded a termination bonus of $4,000,
which figure, in essence, represented his salary carried
forward from 31 January through 30 June 1974. Wiley promptly
rejected this offer, again expressing dissatisfaction with his
termination. He specifically asked that he be reimbursed for
the deficit in his so-called Saroyan Fund. He also asked that
the Agency find him a job or bear the expenses of him returning
to college for a post-graduate degree, which would enable him
to find a position in the academic world. He contended that
the Agency should Pay not only his tuition, but a stipend for
a living expense.

8. Mr. Stembridge concluded the interview by reminding
Wiley that his termination was effective, and the previously
executed Secrecy Agreement was in force. Mr. Stembridge aiso
informed Wiley that he would be available for additional
assistance should Wiley so require. However, it was definitely
made clear that the next move was to come from Wiley.

Shortly after this rejection,

by 19 April 1974 by Louis Vasaly, who 2 iy Wiley did
not appear to have any legal or moral claims to reimbu
for the Saroyan Fund deficit. The fund, according to Ve aly,
was an accounting exercise which had never been accepted by

his previous case officers as legal, binding, payable, or
Claimable. The items in the fund included all expenses incurred
by Wiley in the production of income plus payments received for
whatever services he performed in the acquisition of outside
income.

10. Dempsey reviewed the Wiley file and arrived at the
Same. conclusion as Mr. Vasaly. Specifically, Dempsey saw no
evidence to indicate an intention on the part of the Agency to
reimburse Wiley for expenses as listed in. the Saroyan Fund.
Likewise, there was no evidence to indicate an intention on
the part of the Agency to offset Wiley's Agency salary by those
items of outside income. :

11. On 9 April 1974, Wiley met Louis Vasaly and turned
over the last statement of the cover fund accounting. Wiley's
claim amounted to $7,475.01.

12. The Office of Security, recognizing that this claim
could not be paid as structured, contacted the Office of
Personnel to determine whether or not Wiley could be paid a
termination séttlement and, if so, in what amount. Although
HR 20-32 does not apply to independent contractors, the Office
of Personnel concluded that, under existing Agency regulation
and using HR 20-32 as a guide, Wiley could be paid a maximum
termination of $9,500. The recommendation was then made to
the DD/M&S to approve payment to Wiley in the amount of $8,000,
an amount somewhat in excess of his so-called Saroyan Fund
deficit.

13. On 24 June 1974, Messrs. Stembridge and Dempsey
contacted Wiley in New York City and attempted to effect a
termination settlement. Mr. Wiley promptly rejected the $8,900
offering, contending that it was reimbursement for his cover
fund deficit and a mere $500 termination bonus. Messrs.
ab Stombridage and Dompsoy explained again to Wiley thic Agency
did not recognize the Saroyan Fund, therefore, could not pay
the deficit. The $8,000 bonus offering was just that--a
termination bonus and no more. Wiley was not satisfied with
this explanation and claimed that all he wanted at this point
was reimbursement for his Saroyan Fund deficit. Stembridge and
Dempsey told Wiley they would be back in touch with him in a
couple of weeks.

14. Mr. Kane, the Director of Security, in attempt to
resolve this matter, called upon the assistance of the Office
of Finance to conduct an objective study into Wiley's claim.
The Office of Finance, after a complete audit, and, based
upon a complete examination of all papers in the file, concluded
that Wiley could be reimbursed for direct cover expenses and
foreign travel up to a total amount of some $20,054.23. The
Office of Finance's conclusions were formulated into memoranda
for the DD/M&S and the Director of Central Intelligence in early
August of 1974, recommending approval to pay Wiley $24,429.25,
which payment consisted of $20,054.23 in reimbursable expenses;
$4,375 in termination bonus. This recommendation was approved

by the DD/M&S and forwarded to the Director ef Central
Intelligence, who, on 10 August, questioned the amount of
the termination offer. He felt full reimbursement was not
particularly advantageous to either this Agency or Wiley.
He approved a payment of $12,000, consisting of $8,000 in
allowable expenses and a $4,000 termination bonus.

15. Mr. Colby instructed Mr. Kane to prepare a letter
for his signature explaining to Wiley that this Agency had
thoroughly examined Wiley's claim and could not honor it as
structured. However, certain operational expenses in the
amount of $8,000 plus a $4,000 termination bonus could be
paid. This letter would be given to Wiley at the next
meeting with Office of Security representatives, and Wiley
should be told this is the maximum settlement he can be
given under CIA's rules and regulations.

16. On 28 August 1974, Messrs. Stembridge and Dempsey
met with Wiley in New York City. Wiley was given the DCI's
letter and read the Quit Claim. Upon reading both, he promptly

aetepted the termination offer anc Signed, Wriay wae tos
e should anything arise which might need clarification, he should
contact Dempsey.
