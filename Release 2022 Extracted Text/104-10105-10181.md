Sergio Vicente ARCACHA Smith (Enclosure 8 of reference monorandun)
DPOB: 22 January 1923, Cuba
}

1. Traces on ARCACHA do ae reflect the date he first
arrived in the 0.8. Hovever, he became the FRENTE REVOLU-
CIONARIO DEMOCRATICO (FRD) delegate in Rew Orleans prior
te the Bay of Pigs invasion and continued in that postion
until the FRD ceased to function. The FRD uas the
of the CUBAN REVOLUTIONARY COURCIL, end was orgaoised and
supported by the Agency. The organization was used ae a
front for recruitment of Brigade 2506 for the invasion.
During this period ARCACHA reported to the FRD eee
in Miami through a post office box in Coral Gables, and :

reportedly maintained extensive relations with the Hew.
Orleans FBI and Immigration offices. Two of his reguiar © 7

2. ARCACHA was also one of the proxzoters of the -
FRIENDS OF DEMOCRATIC CUBA, INC (FBC) which vas incorporated
in New Orleans on 6 January 1961. This organization was
ostensibly created by several New Orleana business and
political figures, including the deceased former FBI agent,
Guy Banister, to collect money to aid Cubans in their
fight against.Communism, According to the articles of
incorporation, these donations would also be used to support
the FRD and the funds were to be channeled through ARCACHA,
less a percentage to be retained by the FIC. An investi-
gation conducted by a reliable Miami Station aaset concluded
that the FDC was organized strictly for the personal gain
of the promoters with the approval and collaboration of
ARCACHA. The investigation produced ne evidence that any
fonnabchbcabgr donations were ever solicited or received and

that the funds of the Stevedores Union and the
books of the New Orleans Exporters Company be pr mitenehion haa
for. evidence of personal gain and possible evidence of
federal tax evagion, since both the president of the New
Orleans Exporters Company, Gerar@ F. Tunsgue, and the Chief
of New Orleans Stevedores Union, Alfred Chittenden, were
officials of the FDC. Approximately one month after the
FDC was created, strong criticism from some prominent Cubans
put the organization out of business.

3. Information in an immigration card reflects that
ARCACHA travelled to Caracas, Venezuela at an unspecified
date. His address in Venezuela was HOTEL TWUNA, Caracas,
and his US address was listed as 4523 Bupplesses Street,
New Orleans. Passport Ho. 00433.


4. Background information on the FDC and ARCACHA's
connection with the organization was forwarded to the FBI .
in CBCE-3/764, 414, dated 30 March 1961. Other sources of
the above guumary of information on ARCACHA are; DBF-66955,
13 January 2961) DBY-91789, 11 October 1961; DBF-92355, 16

Edvard 8. BUTLER (Paragraph 7 (A) of reference memorandum)

e

In January 1965 Subject’s organization (INCA), sponsored
the New Orleans appearance of Juanita CASTRO shortly after
her arrival in the US. INCA had a particular interest in
Migs CASTRO since they distributed hundreds of tapes contah-
ing Miss CASTRO's declarations when she was surfaced in
Mexico. A JMWAVE asset, who is Mies CASTRO'’s business maiager ;
handled the planning and arrangements for the Now Orleans
visit with INCA officials. The only subsequent contact
between the JEWAVE asset and Edward BUTLER occurred when
BUTLER was recently in Miami promoting the IKCA film on
"CASTRO-HITLER in HAVANA". See Attachment 2 for a summary
of the INCA organization.


Eailie SANTAKA (paragraph 7 C of reference sexorandus)

DPOB: 7 Sept 1935, Cardonas, Matanzas, Cuba
(also reported 7 Sept 1936 and 7 Sept 1937

1. Subject is probably identifiable with Emilio SANTANA
Galindo, who was recruited by JHWAVE in December 1960 as a
guide for an infiltration team. SANTANA was paid a monthly
ealary under provisions of his MOC until he was terminated
on 15 October 1963 when the ratline developed by the team
becaze ble due to occupation of the target area by
Seviet technicians. Another compelling reason for SANTANA‘s
termination stemmed from his untruthful reporting concerning
certain aspects of the team operations.

2. In an attempt to establish positive identification,
SMWAVE obtained a report from the Dade County (Miami)
Sheriff's office that an Emilio SANTANA (no matronymic)
born 6 July 1936 in Cuba, was declared a fugitive fron
Louistana on a federal warrant 22 December 1965, FBI Sheet
182287F, based on two counts of burglery in Louisiana.

He was arrested and booked by the Dade County Sheriff's
office on 2 February 1966 and was presumably sent back to
Louisiana. At the time of his arrest SANTANA gave his
address as 851 SW 4th Street, Miami, which is the same
address shown on an old immigration frm when he was

living in Miami. Headquarters files indicate SANTANA is
separated from his wife who apparently still resides at

the old Miami address. Since SANTANA'’s date of birth varies
on various documents in his 201 file, the variation in birth
date on his arrest sheet is not conclusive. The fact he
did give his former address to the arresting officers
indicates he is Emilio SANTANA Galindo. A 1962 immigration
form includes a photograph which could be obtained fron
SMWAVE for identification purposes if this becomes necessary.

3. Although JMWAVE has had no contact with SANTANA
since his termination, there is a note in Station files
dated 23 June 1964 that SANTANA used the Agency as his
employer on an auto credit application.


Albert FOWLER (Paragraph 7(B) of reference memorandum)
DPOB: 15 July 1929, New Orleans, Louisiana

1. Subject is Alberto Casimir FOWLER Perillait, a
member of Brigade 2506 who was captured during the invasion
and returned to the US in the December 1962 prisoner
exchange.

2. FOWLER apparently returned to Cuba with his parents
during his early life and returned to the US to attend
sche in his late teens. He attended the Lenox School,
Lenox, Massachusetts, 1948-49; Louisiana State University
1940-51. After his graduation from LSU he returned to Cuba
and married Margarita Paulette Van der SCHUEREN, born 13
August 1933, Brussels, Belgum. FOWLER was President of
the North American Sugar Company, Havana, from 1951 until
he returned to the US in November 1960 and enlisted in
Brigade 2506. At the time of his enlistment he gave Hark
FOSTER, Cuban Refugee Center White House Representative,
and forser US Ambassador William D, PAULEY, as references.
Following his release from prison FOWLHR worked for the
BRAHMS CONSTRUCTION COMPARY, Palm Beach, Florida, where his
father resides, and for BROOKS TRAVEL SERVICES, W. Palo
Beach, Florida, until at least late 1964. He apparently
lost his US citizenship during his years of residence in
Cuba and immigration records indicate he applied for advance
parole status in November 1964 while he was still employed
in W. Palm Beach. He apparently returned to Louisiana
sometime after that date. FOWLER's mother lives in Coving-
ton, Louisiana, and he has a sister who is married to Fort
PIPES, Jr., momber of a prominent New Orleans family.


Carlos QUIROGA (Paragraph 7(C) of reference memorandum)

Subject is possibly identifiable with Carlos QUIROGA,
a forzer student at Lousiana State University who was a
candidate for the Agency Student Recruituent Program. This
involved recruitment of Cuban students in the US who would
return to Cuba as agents in place. JMWAVE traces reflect
an individual of the same name was an electrical engineer,
residing at 3134 Derby Blace, Kew Orleans, in December 1964.
Subject reportedly had homosexual tendencies, low morals,
and until the middle of 1961 was an ardent CASTRO supporter
and made anti-US statements. There is no indication that a
Carlos QUIROGA wae every employed by the Agency in any
capacity.


Julian BUZNEDO (Enclesure 8 of reference memorandum)
DPOB: 16 February 1840, Havana, Cuba

Subject 1s apparently identifiable with Julian BUZNEDO
Castellanos, who arrived in the US on 10 November 1960 and
enlisted in Brigade 2506. He was a civilian pilot in Cuba
and served on the invasion craft 3. BUZNEDO was
captured and released in thepprisoner exchange. (There is no
indication he was ever employed by the Agency, other than
his participation in the invasion.


Goréon Dusne HOVER (Enclosure 19 of reference moxorandun)

There is no record of Subject in WH/Cuban Operation
Group files or JHWAVE files. JMWAVE cited tke article
on KOVEL which appeared in the MIAMI HERALD on 26 April
1967, which is available in CI/R & A, and is in the process
of conducting an exhaustive search for traces on the cover
kag pooped NOVEL claimed to operate for the Agency in
New nS.

There is no record of Subject under either name in WH/COG
or JUWAVE files.



FRENTE REVOLUCIONARIO DEMOCRATICO (FED)
(CUBAN DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTIONARY FRONT)

1. The FRD was created with Agency assistance,
guidance and financial support in May 1960 and consisted
of several anti-CASTRO groups. The FRD was formed as a
political action, propaganda and military unit. Initial
actions consisted of extensive radio and printed propaganda,
demonstrations, and trips throughout the Hemisphere to gain
support for the fight against CASTRO. The FRD also functioned
as the front organization for recruiting the menbers of
the Bay of Pigs invasion force and carried out a massive
program of social assistance to Brigade 2506 members in
training camps and their families. Although the FRD head-
quarters were based in Miami, delegates were assigned to
other areas which included New Orleans, Louisiana, Tampa,
Florida, and Mexico City, to gather intelligence and
coordinate Cuban refugee activities.

2. In late 1960 or early 1961 the CUBAN REVOLUTIONARY
COUNCIL (CRC) was formed to coordinate and direct PRD
activities and this group was headed by Agency and White
House sponsored Dr. Jose MIRO Cardona, assisted by Manuel
ARTIME and Dr. Antonio VARONA. Both the FRD and the CRC
continued to function until October 1961 when the RD was
completely absorbed by the CRC in order to avoid the confusion
resulting from duplication of personnel, activities and
funding. The CRC also had direct access to President
Kennedy and top Bhite House aides. Bacause of the magnitude
of the FRD and CRC operations and the Agency participation
in the activities and funding of the groups, a large number
of JMWAVE and Headquarters were directly involved with both
FRD and CRC personnel.

THE TNFOREATION COUNCIL OF THE AMERICAS, INC. (INCA) ; i

1. INCA is an anti-Communist propaganda organization
ith headquarters in New Orleans, that disseminates English
nd foreign language propagenda tapes and files en a world-
ide basis, conducts public forums of an extrenist
political nature, etc. The organizational impetus and funds
apparently come from wealthy New Orleans figures including
Dr. Alton OCHSNER, of the OCHSNER CLINIC, and Willard 8.
ROBERTSON. In recent years funds have been supplied by the
SCHICK SAFETY RAZOR COMPANY. An INCA letterhead listing all
the officers and officials has been requested from JMWAVE,

‘which has had some casual correspondence with the organiza-

tion concerning Miss Juanita CASTRO,

2. There is no indication of any Agency relationship
with INCA prior to January 1065 when INCA sponsored Miss
CASTRO’s appearance in New Orleans. At that time an Agency
asset who functioned ag Hiss CASTRO'’s business manager )was
involved with INCA officials in planning the New Orleans
visit where Hiss CASTRO was given an award at a dinner
gpongored by INCA. The dinner, which was attended by civic
leaders and representatives of all news media, took place
shortly after Miss CASTRO‘s defection and there was
considerable interest in her appearance. INCA was particularly
interested since it had distributed hundreds of English
and Spanish language tapes containing her statements when
she was surfaced in Mexico. In October 1966 INCA again
requested that Miss CASTRO appear as a guest speaker in
major American cities in connection with the release of
the INCA motion picture production “HITLER IN HAVANA",
Following various reviews of the film, JHWAVE decided the
film would probably become controversial and it would be .
inadvisable to permit Miss CASTRO to accept the invitation.
Because of INCA's extremist political orientation, JMWAVE
has wanted to avoid any more involvement between Hiss CASTRO
and INCA and the Station asset, in his capacity as’ busines

one casual contact between our asset and Edward BUTLER,
Executive Vice-President of INCA, since Miss CASTRO'’s 1965
Hew Orleans trip. This took place recently when BUTLER was
in the area promoting the "HITLER IN HAVANA" film.

3. According to JMWAVE, INCA officials have never
indicated in any way that they are aware of Agency control
and direction of Mise CASTRO or her business agent, and there
4g no indication that INCA officials have had any official
contact with Agency officers.


DIRECTORIO REVOLUCIONARIO ESTUDIANTIL (DRE)
(STUDENT REVOLUTIONARY DIRECTORATE)

1. The DRE was conceived, created and funded by the
Agency in September 1960 and terminated in December 1966.
It was an outgrowth of the activist student group in Cuba
which fought against BATISTA and later against CASTRO.

Many of the leaders came into exile around September 1960
and were subsequently trained and infiltrated into Cuba

by the Agency in late 1960 where they operated by obtain-
ing intelligence setting up action teams, etc., up through
the Bay of Pigs invasion. While the DRE was initially set
up as a psych warfare outfit, the organization was given a
large amount of paramilitary aid in funds and material.
After the Bay of Pigs, the DRE engaged in independent
military actions which declined at Agency direction and
because of a reduction in funds from late 1962 until ter- ~
mination of the group. Members were used through 1966 as
political action agents, for publishing propaganda which
was sent throughout the Hemisphere, attending international
student meetings at Agency direction, and producing radio
programs and special propaganda campaigns.

2. After the cutback in military operations, mamy
| of the best DRE members relocated in other areas. At
present there are delegations in most Latin American coun-
tries which have maintained some contact with various
said _ Agency stations over the years although the DRE is no

longer very active. During the organization's 6 year
period of active existence DRE personnel were in contact
with several JMWAVE staffers and outside contract agents.
However, from January 1965 through December 1966, contact
with DRE personnel was limited to two agents, Juan Manuel
SALVAT, the current DRE Secretary General who is now
operating a bookstore in Miami, Florida, and Fernando
GARCIA Chacon who was relocated in El Salvador.
