on 15 October 1963 when the ratitue developod by the team

Another compelling reason for SANTAnA's

termination stenned fron his untruthful reporting concerning

certain aspects of the tean operations.

In an attenpt to establish positive identificatios,

JHAVE obtainod a report from the Dade County (Maul)

on various documents In hia 201 fllo, the varlation In birth

(CUBAN DENOCRATIC REVOLNTIONARY FRONT)

1. The FRD was created with Agency assistance,

guldance and financial support in May 1960 and consisted

Of Beveral AntI-CASTRO grOUDE.

The FRD das forned as &

polltical action, propagands and military unit.

Initial

actions consisted of extensive radio and printed propaganda,

demonstrations, and trips throughout the Henisphere to gain

The FRD also functioned

as the front organisation for rocrulting the members of

the Bay of PIgS InvAsIOn force and carrled out a massive

program of social assistanco to Brigade 8506 menberg 1n

training caups and their familles. Although the FRD head-

quarters vere based in Miami, delegates were assigned to

other areas which included New Orleans, Louislana, Tampa,

Florida, and Mexico City, to gather Intelligence and

coordinate Cuban refugee activities.

2.

In late 1960 or early 1961 the CUBAN REVOLUTIONARY

COUNCIL (CRC) was formed to coordinate and direct ERD

actluitles and this group was headed by Agency and White

iouse sponsored DI. JOse HIlD Cardona, assisted by Manuel

ARTIN® and DI. Antonio VARONA.

Both the PRD and the cro

continued to function until October 1961 when the FRD was

completely absorbed by the CRC in order to avoid the confusion

resulting fron duplication of personnel, activities and

funding.

The CHC also had direct access to President

Kennedy and top thite House aldes.

Bacause of the magultude

of the FRD and CRC operations and the Agency partieipation

In the actluities and funding of the groups, a large number

Of JIHAVE and Headquarters were directly Involved with both

DIRECTORIO REVOLUCIONARIO ESTUDIANTIL (DRE)

(STUDENT REVOLUTIONARY DIRECTORATE)

1. The DRE was conceived, created and funded by the

Agency in September 1960 and terminated in December 1966.

It was an outgrowth of the activist student group in Cuba

which fought against BATISTA and later against CASTRO.

Many of the leaders came into exile around September 1960

and were subsequently trained and infiltrated into Cuba

by the Agency in late 1960 where they operated by obtain-

ing Intelligence setting up action teans, etc., up through

the Bay of Pigs invasion.

While the DRE was initially set

up as a psych warfare outfit, the organization was given a

large amount of paramilitary aid in funds and material.

After the Bay of Pigs, the DRE engaged in independent

milltary actions which declined at Agency direction and

because of a reduction in funds from late 1962 unt1l ter-

1eee tin

mination of the group. Members were used through 1966 as

political action agents, for publishing propaganda which

was sent throughout the Hemisphere, attending international

student meetings at Agency direction, and

producing radio

programs and special propaganda campaigns.

2.

After the cutback in military operations, many

of the

best DRE members relocated in other areas.

At

present there are delegations in most Latin American coun-

tries which have maintained some contact with various

Agency stations over the years although the DRE is no

longer very active. During the organization's 6 year

period of active existence DRE personnel were in contact

wIth several JIWAVE staffers and outside contract agents.

However, from January 1965 through December 1966, contact

with DRE personnel was limited to two agents, Juan Manuel

SALVAT, the current DRE Secretary General who is now

operating a bookstore in Miami, Florida, and Fernando

GARCIA Chacon who was relocated in El Salvador.
