: “The coalition, which comprises about 30 women's

‘groups, will also demonstrate against forced sterilization |
and restrictive contraception laws and plans to hold
national abortion hearings in Washington before the march."

L First source advised on October 15,.1971, that the
November 20, 1971, rally has received mixed support. from i
various Washington, -D. C., womens's liberation groups. LES
Several radical women's groups refused to endorse the November
20, 1971, action because they view it as a Young Socialist
Alliance (YSA)/Socialist Workers Party (SHP) Front which will
use these rallies to further its own recruitment drive.
Furthermore, they considered YSA/SWP to be "non-feminist".

-Main support for the November 20, 1971, demonstration will come
from the WSA Women's Fraction Group. auan :

of 7 This memorandum advises of demonstrations being scheduled in
Washington, D. C., and San Francisco, California, on 11/20/71 to build

The Women's National Abortion Action Coalition was formed at a
conference held at Columbia, University, New York City, in July, 1971, which
was attended by approximately 1,000 women from 29 states. The conference
voted to make a woman's right to abortion a national and political issue.
Subsequent to “its formation, the coalition called for demonstrations in
San Francisco and Washington on 11/20/71 to build public support for the 7
repeal of all antiabortion laws, to protest forced sterilization, andto call “|
for an end to restrictive contraceptive laws. A source of the Washington —
Field Office has advised that the march in Washington is supported by the
Young Socialist Alliance, the youth group of the Socialist Workers Party 47.7
(SWP). Caro]/Lipman, who is a member of the SWP, is Project Director ~~ ~~
of the Washington march.

Coalition leaders in requesting permit for the demonstration have
lestimated that participation in the Washington march will range between
110,000 and 20,006 persons. The Washington Field Office has developed
information that 46 buses have been chartered to bring participants to the
demonstration. Participants will represent some 80 cities. The Metropolitan

RE: WOMEN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE OF MARYLAND
INTERNAL SECURITY - COMMUNIST
(TROTSKYIST )

QO On November 13, 1971, a source advised that the
Women's National Abortion Coalition (WONAAC) planned to
hold démonstraticns at’ Washington; D. C. and San Francisco,
California on November 20, 1971. The purpose of the |
demonstrations were to call for the repeal of all abortion,
contraception and forced sterilization laws. Thé"Women's
‘Right to Choose of Maryland, the Baltimore, Maryland
affiliate of WONAAC was to organize busing and housing
arrangements for out-of-state women.

a ERMAN Aeron Aelliine — bchtiesoinimme . adil BORA

On November 22, 1971, a source advised that the
Women's Right to Choose of Maryland, working from 3028
Greenmout Avenue, Baltimore, Maryland, were unsuccessful
in attempts to generate enthusiasm for the WONNAC demonstration
among Baltimore area women. Therefore, the plan to charter
a bus for the purpose of transporting demonstrators to the
Washington, D. C. rally was cancelled.

aaa on

On November 30, 1971, a second source advised

it that the Women's Right to Choose of Maryland had been

i formed as an “ad hoc" group for the specific purpose of
supporting the Novenber 20, 1971 Washington,:D. C. demonstra-
tion. The source further stated that tne Women's Right iy
to Choose of haryland ceased to exist, following this lj
demonstration, and is now defunct. i

Re: Women's National Abortion Action
Coalition (WONAAC) Convention,
February 11 - 13, 1972
Boston, Massachusetts

On February 18, 1972, source, who has furnished
reliable information in the past, furnished the following
information:

|

A Women's National Abortion Action Coalition
i (WONAAC) Convention was held on the Boston University campus,
- Boston, Massachusetts, during the period of February 11 -
13, 1972.

Approximately 1,000 persons were in attendance

ae at this convention which was held to determine future action
of WONAAC and to allow diverse factions within the Women's

' Abortion Movement to join ranks under one issue,

Female members of the Socialist Workers Party (SWP)
‘ and Young Socialist Alliance (YSA) from all over the county
7 were requested by the national office of the SWP ami YSA
to attend this convention in order to insure the effective
i control of the convention by the SWP,

- As the youth organization of the Socialist,
x rkers Party (sep the Young Soci LE: Alliance”
SA) serves as 5 sousce of rec
into that organization. The YSA is described
in the masthead of its official publication,
\- "The Young Socialist Organizer," as "A multi-
7 national revolutionary socialist youth organi-
' zation."

The SWP has been designated pursuant to
Executive Order 10450,

Re: WONAAC

The SWP specifically wished the convention to
adopt a one-issue poSition, that being the complete
control of the female body by the individual female,
This specific issue, “women control their bodies" was
adopted by the wonent s organization and all other propo~
sals were rejected.

Workshops were organized for each of the many
separate racial and ethnic groups reprasented at the
conference, Workshops were based on appeal to the speci-
fic group intended and all were supposedly controlled by
the SWP,

A Black, Raza, Asian-American women's workshop
was held on February 12, 1972, with 35 persons attending.
Among the issues discussed at the workshop were the
attempts of democratic and republican presidential candi-
dates to capitalize on minority group attitudes in regard
to the abortion movement and the fact that minority groups
all to often find themselves without a voice when real
issues are involved.

of particular importance to the group was the
La Raza Unida Perty, a legitixate political party in Texas
which serv to unite Mexican As caus. Of equal impor-
tance was the Gay Liberation Movement, which the group
felt expresses the plight of gay females who do not want
children and are forced to live with men because of the
mores of American society.

Attendees agreed that the one issue of abortion

law repeal-will serve to unite women rnder one Sannet ‘and

more effectively serve the Women's Mo

The convention adjourned after an agreement that
an “Abortion Action Week" would be held May 1 - 6, 1972.
This action would serve to kéep public attention focused
on the need to legalize abortion and to seek effective
support from the many thousands of women who want to right
to choose.

II. ACTIVITIES

A. Conferences and Demonstrations

City, New York, July 16-18, 1971. This conference called for
national demonstrations to be held on November 20, 1971, in

i
1. WONAAC Founding Conference was held in New York

j WDC and San Francisco, California, around the theme of "Repeal
H of All Abortion Laws."
seaaee : CWP T-1, 7/21/71)
| a. On November 20, 1971, approximately 1,500 women,
representing womens liberation groups from the East Coast and
4 Mid-West, gathered or the Ellipse in WOC, in response to the

a call by WONAAC to march on the United States Capitol to demand

3 the repeal of all abortion laws. This grouv devarted the

fi Ellipse at approximately 10:30 a.m. on that date and marched.

eee along Tennsylvania Avenus, N.W., to che west side of che Capitol
Building. There the marchers assembled for a rally which
concluded at approximately 4:00 p.m. on the same date. There
were no incidents of violence and the march and rally were
peaceful throughout.

b. On January 13, 1972, a WONAAC sponsored demonstra-
tion was held from 4:30 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. in the vicinity of
42nd Street and Times Square, New York City, New York protesting

and the demonstration ended without incident.

(Physical observation, Special
Agents, FBI, 1/13/72)

2. Second WONAAC Conference was held in Boston,
Massachusetts, February 11-13, 1972. Approximately 1,300
women attended the conference, which once again re-established
and reiterated WONAAC's call for abortion on demand. It was
noted during the conference that WONAAC had been unable to
ereate anything like a national campaign and that local meetings
across the country hed been disappuintingly small. It was
pointed out that WONAAC had failed to attract the large numbers
of working women, housewives, and students concerned with the
abortion issue, including the majority of women's liberationists
and abortion reform activists. It was felt that the movement
could not succeed without the support of the working women.

“At the close of the conferernve, WONAAC strongly endorsed
the "Abortion Rights Act of 1972,'' which\is to be introduced in
the U. S. Congress by Congressvonsn BELLA \GBZUG from New York.
This bill would override all laws which impose sanctions upon wt
those who choose to exercise their individual right to an abortion.

(WE T-1, 2/14/72)

a. Proposed Actions

It was moved and adopted during the above conference:
that WONAAC svonsor a week of local abortion activities, May 1-6,
1972, consisting of educational programs, legislative support,
judicial action, and culminating in local or regional demonstra-
tions on May 6, 1972, around the demand for repeal of all anti-
abortion laws and restrictive contraception laws and an end to
forced sterilization.

(WF T-1, 2/14/72)

In addition, the following secondary proposals were
adopted during the conference:



WFO 100-55420

i
iF 1. That a telegram be sent to the New York
a State Court of Anpeals and New York Governor
NELSON A. ROCKEFELLER, condemning chp court's
February 10, 1972,:decision denying women on
Medicaid the right to abortions on demand.

2. That the coalition continue to organize black,
a Puerto Rican, Chicano, native American and Asian
le American participation in their activities.

H 3. That members of local coalitions confront
candidates for office and force them to take a

: : stand on abortion, and that they publicize those
: who oppose abortion so that the voters can see

i : where these politicians stand.

4. That the coalition make a special effort to
reach out to and involve "gay" women in their
activities.

(WF T-1, 2/14/72) |

YSA and SWP members of WONAAC felt the conference to
: be a success in that opposition proposals submitted were turned
down in favor of those proposals backed by the YSA-SWP women.

; The State University of New York at Binghamton
rf is part of the University system of the State of New York, *
Hl and the University at Binghamton has an enrollment of
approximately 7,500 students. The student newspaper
published at the University twice weekly during the school
year in its issue of 10/15/71 carried a brief ad in the
classified section as follows: - 2

“Women who have had abortions needed to relate
their experiences to other women, educate all women
_ about abortion at abortion speak gut October 21. Contact
Linda L., extention 4130."

The 11/12/71, issue of the "Pipedream", student
newspaper published at the State University ‘of New York

at Binghamton, carries an announcement that the Binghamton
Womens Abortion Coalition was selling bus tickets for the
Womens March on Washington for repeal of all abortion laws,
repeal of all contraception laws and no force sterilization
for 11/20/71. Women and men were invited to attend and
tickets were on sale at the student center. Cars and
volunteers were, needed. and, . they : were. to contact LINDA LOEW |
at extention 4129.

H TAPORMAMT- . who is familiar with New

New York at Binghamton was contacted regularly during the

activity or signs on any bulletin boards from the period
of approximately January, 1972 until school closed in
May, 1972. This source was contacted 5/16/72. He stated
also at that time, that LINDA LOEW has been a close
associate of BETTY SACHS who is the leader of the Young
Socialist Alliance “ Chapter on campus at the University.
Informant stated that there was no organization formed to
his knowledge of a Womens Abortion Action Coalition in
the Binghamton area. '

Other sources familiar with New Left activities
on the campus of the State University of New York at
Binghamton, were contacted during May, 1972, and two
sources advised that they knew of no organization of
Womens Abortion Action Coalition on the campus or in the
Binghamton vicinity during the past year.

Albany Division has had an investigation pending
on LINDA LOEW and a report is being written with appropriate
recommendation for administrative action on LINDA LOEW.
In view of the lack of activity of an Abortion Coalition
organization in.the Binghamton area, no further investigation
is being conducted by Albany.

I. ORGANIZATION
A, Origin and Objectives

The Boston Women's Abortion Action Coalition
(BOWAAC), the local effiliate of the Women's National
Abortion Action Coalition (WONAAC), was formed during
late summer, 1971, out of the local Female Liberation
(FL) group.

BS Tel
November 17, 1971

BOWAAC was originally a subcommittee of FL
in the Greater Boston Area but as cf Jenuary, 1972, had
grown into a separate group whose specific interest was
in abortion reform. Individuals active in BOWAAC are

‘also active in other FL work; however, all individuals

active in FL work are not active in BOWAAC, with BOWAAC
being the smailer of the two groups.

ES Tel

spuary 12, 1972

WCRAAC has been pub iely Geseribad 7
as an organization of groups whose aim’
is to effect the ov throw of existing
abortion laws and to esteblish free,
abortion on demand.

The "Boston Globe", a daily newspaper published
‘in Boston, in its February 13, 1972-edition, carried an
article entitled "Abortion Strategy Discussed’ which in
part reported that more than 800 women from across the
country had gathered for a conference at Boston University
the weekend of February 11-13, 1972 to plan a strategy
7 to win repeal of all laws that prohibit abortion. Accord-
ing to the article, it was expected that the conference
would endorse the latest Federal bill to nullify all
..state laws restricting abortion = "The Abortion Rights
. Act of 1972", to be introduced by United States Congress-
woman BELLA ABZUG from New York. The article reported |
that discussion at the conference had centered around
whether or not to adopt the slogan “Free Abortion on
Demand; No Forced Sterilization" or to focus on a
single issue - repeal of the abortion laws. It further
i reported that a proposal was presented for an Abortion
i Action Week, May 1 to 6, 1972, to include educational pro-
grams. legislative support, judicial action and local or
regional demonstrations centering around the demand for
- repeal of all anti-abortion and anti-contraception laws
1

and an end to forced sterilization.

JANE ROLAND, identi 1 in the article as
coordinator of BOWAAC, was reported to have stated that
: whatever the conference does nstionally her organization
would be acting at: the local level. ;

The Febrvary 13, 1972, session of the WONAAC
Confexence at Boston Univer: y was in the form of
workshops held in approximately eight cl reéns with

The workshops primarily related to the building of WONAAG
throughout the United States, fund raising and regional
work, with ideas being exchanged between individuals
attending from various areas of the cowtry, including
Boston. The major theme appeared to be how to strengthen
awareness of WONAAC, which was reportedly in need of

periphery of the workshops and among organizations iden-
tified with the tables was the YSA.

the period June 24, 1972 - June 25, 1972.

The NWPC is a legitimate, loosely-knit, open
organization of politically motivated women
seeking equal recognition in the American
community.

During the Policy Council Meeting there were no
overt attempts by any organized aroup to influence the policy
meeting and there were no individuals present who identified
themselves as members of any organization which might be construed
as subversive and/or supporting any cause except lecitimate
change. :

Of significance, however, was the fact that literature +
of the Women's National Abortion Action Coalition (NOMAAC) was
present in brochures and pamphlets located throughout the meeting
area. All of the WONAAC material was geared to the abortion
movement and specifically the WONAAC conference scheduled for
Hunter College, New York, July 15 - 16, 1972.

\ WONAAC was founded in July, 1971. for the purpose of
forming a national movement of groups scattered
throughout the United States whe favor and

now work to legalize abortion. The Young Socialist
Alliance (YSA) and Socialist Workers Party (SNP)

are playing a major role in WONAAC.

The SWP has been designated pursuant to |
Executive Order 10450,

Re: NWPC Policy Council Meeting

As the youth organization of the SWP, the

YSA serves as the main source of récruitment into
that organization. The YSA is described in the
masthead of its official publication, “The Young
Socialist Organizer," as “a multinational
revolutionary socialist youth organization."

During the council meeting on June 24, 1972, Mary
Clarke, who is associated with the Southern California WPC,
an affiliate of the NWPC, advised a group of volicy council
members that WONAAC had been using the Southern Californi
name as an endorser of WONAAC. Clarke also stated that WONAAC
had passed out propaganda at a caucus rally in California and
were very effective at taking control of small gatherings.

The Chairwoman from Nassau County in New York, whose
namé was not recalled, defended WONAAC stating that "they were
a good group". This woman's position was not supported and,
in general, WONAAC literature was not accepted bv those versons
present. Jill Ruckelshaus, a new member of the Policy Council,
is reportedly concerned about the SWP's attempts to align
itself with the abortion movement and will be using her newly
gained position to fight SWP attemots at control of local
WPC groups.

The NWPC organizing brochure nuhlished by the NWPC
has been written to assist individual WPC groups in organizing.
The brochure lists political varties and vara-vcolitical
organizations to be contacted by caucus organizers when forming
the nucleus of a WPC. Among those listed was the SWP. fter
discussions at the caucus it was determined that the SWP should
be removed from the list. The new edition of the SPC organizing
brochure will not list the SWP; it has been replaced by National
Peace Action Coalition (NPAC).

The NPAC was founded in 1970 by members of the SVP.
Its basic objective is to unite masses of people
including labor unions, GIs, and the black
community in the struagle to end United States
intervention in Southeast Asia through orderly and
peaceful tactics.

PHILADELPHIA WOMEN'S NATIONAL
ABORTION ACTION COALITION °

PH T-1 advised on May 25, 1972, that Women United for
Abortion Rights (WUAR), 1115 Walnut Street, Philadelphia, Pa.,
telephone WA-2-0381, is the local affiliate of Women's National
Abortion Action Coalition (WONAAC) and that about two weeks ago
WUAR decided to change their name from WUAR to Philadelphia Women's
National Abortion Action Coalition (Philadelphia WONAAC) and that
i they intended té utilize the same office space at 1115 Walnut
Street and the same telephone number. PH T-1 added that this
change was made inasmuch as the name WUAR was found to be unwieldy
and awkward and that it did not convey the group's affiliation with
WONAAC as well as the new name Philadelphia WONAAC.

An article in "The Sunday Bulletin," Section 2, pages
6 and 7, issue of October 31, 1971, listed the various candidates
for political office in the City of Philadelphia in connection with
the forthcoming elections. Photographs of the following individuals
appeared and background information contained under each individual
photograph indicated that all were members of the Socialist
Workers Party (SWP) and that they were also affiliated with the
WUAR and/or WONAAC:

PH T-1 advised on May 25, 1972 that it is difficult
to determine the actual degree of SWP participation in the affairs
of WONAAC in the Philadelphia area and that he was not aware of
any information which would reflect that Philadelphia WONAAC was
substantially controlled by the SWP. Source explained that the
abortion rights issue had frequently been discussed at many of the -
recent public forum type meetings sponsored by the Philadelphia
SWP and held at the Philadelphia SWP Headquarters at 1004 Filbert
Street in Philadelphia. The discussions held on the abortion
rights issue indicated that the SWP felt that the capitalistic
system had used the dual issues of abortion and women's liberation
to keep women in a position of inferiority, whereas the socialistic
system being promoted by the SWP would be in favor of abortion and
women's liberation, and WONAAC would therefore naturally attract
members of the SWP to their organization.

As you are aware, the Socialist Workers Party (SWP)

The Women's National Abortion
Action Coalition

Confidential sources one, two and three, all of
whom have furnished reliable information in the past, advised -
on July 18, 19, and 20, 1972, respectively, that a Women's
Natlonal Abortion Action Coalition (ZHAhC) Conference was
held at Hunter College, Park Avenue and o9tn Street, on
July 15 and 16, 1972.

Confidential source number one advised that
New York City was'‘picked for the site of this convention
because this city is considered to be the center of the most
powerful anti-abortinn effort so far.

: The WOHAAC Conference was open to all women
who supported the Abortion Law Repeal Movement. Registration
was $3.00 per person. Housing and child eare facilities were
available, There were approximately 800 women in attendance

at this conference,

Discussions hid at this conference centered on
plans for (oné-future activity in the campaign to repeal

all anti-abortion and contraception laws and ¢wo}to end
forced sterilization,

A discussion was held concerning the attacks
being made by the Catholic Church Hierarchy and other
anti-abortion groups against women's rights to their
own bodies.

WONAAC is aware of the fact that progress for
these matters will not come easy,:that it will be fought by
various groups step by step all the way, therefore, this
conferencé was called to discuss all.the different approaches
and to decide on the major direction for WONAAC to take.

uninterrupted with votes on various flger
until an interruption was made by Rose/AW
coordinator. She addressed all YSA~SWP members at the
conference, asking them what. was their real reason for

being in attendance at the WONAAC Conference. She

sceused the YSA-SWP of not being sincerely interested

in abortion rights, but rather being interested in what

was best for the SWP-YSA. She stated that --because of

the YSA-SVP influence being enforced on the conference,

she was resigning as a WONAAC coordinator and staff member.
She gtated that she detested the intervention of the YSA-SWP
in this conference; that the SYP-YSA has caused conflict
the WOHNAAC etaff and therefore, they cannot work out constr
sclutions to their problems. She also suggested that the "z

Zero

at this conference. Finalizing her accusations, she steted the
YSA-SUP members had no mind of their own nor did they have any
freedom of expression of their own. She stated that they only

On July 15, 1972, a proposal wasyasse’dby the
Glection Workshop which etated in part as follows:

“HOHAAC welcomes womon from’all political
affiliations and views. We are w d in ection to
win our demands guarantecing women the right to control,
our own reproduction functions,

"By uniting women of all political views we
maximize our strength. Any attempt to impose one political
view on everyone in WONAAC would only destroy our ability to
Sight together on the abortion question. Therefore kONAAC,
as an organiza ae takes no’ position on any candidates or
political parties...."

“Phe political rallies which will no doubt take
place with increa.ing frequency around the country as
November approaches offer us a forum for getting our ideas
across to great numbers of women. Besides allowing us an
opportunity to force the candidates to take a public stand
on abortion, these gatherings give us a chance to publicize
beth WONAAC and the repeal campaign."

A National WOHAAC structure proposal was
presented, which stated in part as follows:

There shall also be a Working Committee (WC),
which is a sub-committee of the NCC and which is composed

of the project directors or coordinators, the elected
national staff, and one woman from cach coalition, committee,
group and national organization supporting and building WONAAC
in the locale of the national office..."

In addition to the above, a proposal “that the
National Office of the Women's National Abortion Action
Coalition establish an emergency cash fund, from which to
contribute significant amounts of money to organizations
and individuals who are working to achieve goals compatible
with those of WONAAC..."

"That the National Office of WONAAC, as its first
act of financial support, pledge $2,000 to tha Kennedy-Schuiger
suit against the tax-exempt status of the Roman Catholic Church,
eince the Church has violated restrictions on its political
activity by lobbying for anti-abortion legislation.

"phat the National Office of WONAAC pledged
$1,500 to the defense of the seven women arrested in
Chicago because of their alleged activity in abortion
counselling, veferral, and procedure..."

"Phat the WONAAC National Office maintain,
at all times, a fund-raising starr efficient enough
to meet the needs of the emergency fund at the same
time it raises sufficient capital to maintain the ‘daily
expenses of the National Office and staff..."

Confidential gource number two related that the
evening plenary session of WONAAC occurred on July 15, 1972,
and it was immediately apparent that the Socialist
Workers Party - Young Soajalist Alliance (SWP-YSA) group
dominated the meeting. Independent women who wanted to make
statements during this session were voted down by SWP floor
leaders and these same persons continued to vote as a bloc
on all issues.

The group of independent women from various geogra-
phic areas, that is those women who were not associated with the
SWP or YSA, went together after the plenary session was adjourned
and considered the problem of how to handle the SWP leaders,
While these women were not political realists in thelr goals,
they did believe in working throughout the existing system
rather than functioning with the SWP in their eventual goal
of revolution,

It was decided that the independent feminists would
no longer continue hasSiing within WONAAC. They did not want
to have decisions for them being structured by a male dominated
group. They also decided that money being collected by WONAAC
inthe name of abortion law change was not being used for that
purpose, but rather to sustain members of the SWP-YSA.

The Sunday morning session, July 16, 1972, was
labeled "Meeting to Discuss Internal Hassles." About 35
independents attended and a few number of SWP-YSA members and
sympathizers were present. Independents there were from New
Haven, Boston, Detroit, New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, and
San Francisco.

than others were Ohio, Illinois, New York, and Massachusetts.

Most of the problems and differences between the
independents and the SWP centered around approaches to abortion
law réform, The SWP was charged with always having demonstra-
tions and rallies and never doing any work, through the legis-
lative process,

The independents stated that they were tired of this
hassle and that they believed there were more effective ways
to change abortion laws than carrying placards in the streets.

After the independent women publicly resigned in
front of the plenary session, two other coordinators announced
they were staying on. One was Barbara Roberts, the other's
name is unknown,

Linda Jenness made a final plea for the independent
women to reconsider, The removal of the independents from WONAAC
has d@bilitated the organization and most independent representa-
tives will be going back to their own cities to work for abortion
law change in organizations vhich have no connection with the
SWP, -

The concern still exists, however, that WONAAC will
be able to collect monies in the name of abortion reform and

“COMP FBENBEAD

The Women's National Abortion
Action Coalition

there is also the concern that women new to the movement will
join in a mistaken notion that‘they will be furthering
abortion law reform.

Independents vowed before leaving New York that
they would try to publicize activities from the SWP in an
effort to prevent this,

As the youth orgenization of the Socialist
Workers Party (SWP), the YSA serves as the
main source of recruitment into that organ-
izetion. The YSA is described in the masthead
of its official publication, "The Young
Socialist Organizer,"-as "A multinational
revolutionary socialist youth orgenization."

The SWP has .been designated pursuant
to Executive Order 10450.

ReAL letter to New York, dated 8/30/72, wherein
Albany asked to be advised of any active investigation being
conducted re WONAAC, or if any active investigation is
warranted by Albany, FBI.

For the information of the Albany Division, the
New York Office is the office of origin, concerning captioned
organization. The Bureau has advised that as the Socialist
Workers Party and the Young Socialist Alliance play amajor
roll in WONAAC throughout the United States, and inasmuch
as information has been provided that WONAAC is, for the
most part, totally controlled by Socialist Workers Party/
Young Socialist Alliance, the activities of this aganization
should be followed, for the purpose of determining the
extent of influence and control. by individuals who are
members of Socialist Workers Party/ Young Socialist Alliance,
and who are acting on behalf of these organizations.

Based upon Bureau instructions, in light of
information set forth in referenced Albany letter, concerning
DIA RRY, an Socialist Workers Party organizer in the
Utica, New York area, and her r@orted communication with
national headquarters of WONAAC in New York City. It would
appear advisable for the Albany Division to institute such
investigation, as it deems appropriate to ascertain the extent
of Socialist Workers Party/Young Socialist Alliance activity
in its division in connection with WONAAC,.

4 advised that because of Socialist Workers Party (SWP) leader-
a Ship and interest in the above organization, this case was
to be kept in a pending status and its activities followed.

In accordance with the above instructions, the
Bureau is being furnished the original and five (5) copies
of a letterhead memorandum prepared under the title, "Minnesota
Women's Abortion Action Coalition."

The enclosed letterhead memorandum is classified

reasonably result in compromising the identity of the source
and, therefore, impair the national defense interests of the~)/

The Young Socialist Alliance-Twin Cities
Group is the Youth Branch of the Twin Cities
Branch-Socialist Workers Party (TCB-SWO), an .
affiliate of the Socialist Workers Party (SWP).

As the youth organization of the Socialist
Workers Party (SWP), the Young Socialist Alliance
(YSA) serves as the main source of recruitment
into that organization. The YSA is described,in
the masthead of its official publication, "The
Young Socialist Organizer," as "A multinational
revolutionary socialist youth organization."

The MWAAC rally held May 6, 1972, began at the
residence of the governor of the State of Minnesota, 10067
Summit Avenue, St. Paul, Minnesota, at approximately 3:30P.M,
and proceeded to the State Capitol Building where the rally
calling for the repeal of all abortion laws and emphasizing
the demand for the right to legal abortions was held. The
rally was held without incident and speakers identified
included representatives from the YSA-TCG and the TCB~SWP.
Jane Van Deusen was the principle speaker for the MWAAC
at this rally which ended at approximately 5:30 P.M.

MP T-1 on

The principle speaker in favor of legal abortion
in the State of Minnesota at the rally held in St. Paul,

decided that an International Tribunal was planned for
October 21, 1972, The International Tribunal would be
held in New York City, New York, and it was‘hoped that
plans could be made for a local tribunal scheduled to be
held October 13, 1972, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, after
which individuals would be designated to attend the inter-
national meeting scheduled for New York City. This’ July,
1972, meeting was the first activity on the part of the
MWAAC as a“ new-organized effort following the May 6, 1972,
rally. .

aCe i August 9, 1972

Individuals known to be involved in the women's
liberation movement in the Twin Cities area of Minneapolis
and St. Paul, Minnesota, have, during the past six months,
shown little or no interest in the organization known as the
MWAAC. Former leaders in the women's liberation movement
have become aware of the SWP influence among the leaders of
the group, and have adopted a hands off policy from active
participation in the affairs of this group. While the
May 6, 1972, rally in St. Paul, Minnesota, was attended by
some 200 individuals, their attendance was considered to be
due to individual interest in the abortion issue.

MP T-2 on
August 17, 1972

SWP_ INFLUENCE |

The MWAAC is not a committee of the TCB-SWP, nor
is it a part of the YSA-TCG. Women's liberation is a topic
of general interest and concern to the membership of the
TCB-SWP, and the anti-abortion standard taken by MWAAC is
one aspect of the women's liberation movement of continued
interest.

movement, is one aspect of this women's liberation movement
which continues to be of concern to members of the YSA-TCG,

in New York City (uve) , “details of which will be set out
more fully hereinafter.

As the youth organization of the
SWP, the YSA serves as the main
source of recruitment into that
organization. The YSA is described
in the masthead of its official
publication, "The Young Socialist
Organizer", as "a Multi-National
Revolutionary Socialist Youth
Organization".

The SWP has been designated pur-
suant to Executive ceed 10450.

I. ORGANIZATIONAL DATA -

A. Origin and Scope

. NY T-2 on July 21, 1971, and NY T-3 on October 1,
1971, furnished information that over 1,000 women met in
conference at Columbia University, NYC, NY, on July 16;
1971, through July 18, 1971, to form a National Movement
of independent groups scattered throughout the United
States (US) who favored and had worked to legalize abortion.
As a result of this conference, WONAAC was founded.

B. Aims and Purposes _

In the WONAAC national newsletter, dated September 16,
1971, WONAAC was self-described as a nationally coordina-
ted abortion law repeal campaign including legislation,
legal action, and nationally coordinated mass demonstrations
in Washington, DC, and San Francisco, on November 20, 1971,°
for the repeal of all anti-abortion laws and corollary
demands of no forced sterilization, and the repeal of all
restrictive contraception laws. WONAAC claims to reach
all women, black; Chinaca; Latina; Asian; Puerto Rican;
native American women; campus women; gay women; high
school women; housewives; professional, welfare, and
working women; young women; women from churches, political
organizations, trade unions, the military, and communities
across the country.

C. Headquarters

On November 22, 1972, a Special Agent (SA) of
the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), utilizing a
pretext, contacted an individual self-identified as CAROL
EATON at telephone number 675-9150, located at 150 5th .
Avenue, NYC, NY. EATON, who stated she is currently a
National Staff member of WONAAC, advised that the National
and NY Staffs of-WONAAC are headquartered at this address;

D. When Meetings Held

According to CAROL EATON, regular NY Coalition
meetings of WONAAC are held every other Wednesday evening
at Religious Center at New York University, .2 Washington
Square North, NYC, NY. EATON stated that most NY State
staff members are present at these meetings and at least
one or more National Staff members also try to be in
attendance. Other than this, state and national staffs
meet periodically, as business demands.

E. Officers
EATON identified the following individuals as
current officers of WONAAC: ’

N¥ 100-174481° | ae

F. Membership and Finances

According to EATON, WONAAC does not maintain a
formal membership, as such, and financially exists only
through voluntary contributions. She stated that all
staff members, National and NY State, serve on a voluntary
basis, receive no salary, and get only a small "subsistance
allowance" which the staff has found necessary to supplement
with their own personal funds in order to get by.

G. WONAAC Affiliates

CAROL EATON stated there are presently 36 WONAAC
affiliates, also called “coalitions” throughout the US, and
that most states of the union are represented by an affiliate .
or coalition.

II. YSA-SWP INFLUENCE AND CONTROL
OVER WONAAC

NY T-1 provided information on July 22, 1971,
that the First National Womens Abortion Conference was
held at Columbia University, NYC, N¥, from July 16, 1971,
to July 18, 1971, which resulted in the founding of WONAAC.
NY T-1 stated that it was immediately apparent that this
conference was taken over and influenced by YSA-SWP members
who infiltrated the various conference committees and
workshops which were established to help formulate the
main direction the Coalition would follow in the future.
NY T-1 stated that it seemed certain the YSA-SWP would,
in the future, dictate policy for this organization and
would be able to control the utilization of WONAAC funds.

On August 5, 1971, NY T-4 provided a leaflet
captioned, “What Every Woman Should Know*. This leaflet,
which was published by Feminist Organization for Communi-

cation; Action and Service (F.0.C.A.S.), related the following:

H "The Womens National Abortion Coalition has
been ‘called and organized by the SWP and its affiliate,
the YSA, including women supposedly representing Women's
Liberation groups, who in truth represent, first, the

NW 68262 Docld:32989546 Page 293



NY 100-174481" -. -

SWP and YSA. These women attach more importance to their
political movement than to the Women's Liberation Movement.
And when 77% of the women in this country are for reform
of abortion laws, there is fertile soil for a political:
party to build itself on. The SWP/YSA abiasiaaia this and

is taking advantage of it."

On August 5, 471, a leatict
captioned "F.O.C.A.S." revealed

in part as follows:

7... "A nucleus of about “eight pe

have formed FOCAS,

Feminist

Organization for Communication,
Action and Service. FOCAS evolved.
from the Women's Strike Coalition

(WSC), which the Socialist Workers

Party abruptly abandoned on May
25th in order to form the committee
for WONAAC. Since that time a
nucleus of women from WSC together
with like-minded feminists pre- ~

served the WSC in

order to main-

tain and expand a multi-issue
action-oriented Women's Libera-

tion coalition in
Assisted by loans

the NYC area.
from supporting

feminists, the new WSC paid
back nearly a thousand of the
three thousand dollars of debts”
incurred by the SWP women who
had controlled the old WSC.

The "Militant" issue of August 6, 1971, page five,
in an article entitled, "Abortion Campaign Counters Red-

Baiting", revealed in part, with
WONABAC conference in July, 1971:

"The Militant" is

paper of the SWP.

NW 68262 Docld:32989546 Page 294

respect to the founding

a weekly news-



NY 100-174481 *

"There were many members of the SWP and YSA at the
conference, and SWPers and YSAers are among those who -
have worked most consistently for abortion repeal and to
build the abortion conference...."

NY T-5 advised on November 12, 1971, that a NY ae
Planning Meeting of WONAAC was held at LOEB Student Center,
NY University, NY, on November 11, 1971, to lay plans
for a scheduled November 20, 1971 demonstration in Washington,
DC. According to this source, this meeting was completely
dominated seiiiad controlled by members of the SWP..

NY T-6 related on November 16, 1971, that the Upper”
West Side Branch of the YSA planned to send a contingent
of its members to Washington, DC, on November 20, 1971,
in order to participate in the planned demonstration nent
on that date. ,

NY T-6 stated that practically all the members of the
uptown branch of the YSA, NY, were expected to participate
in this activity.

NY T-5 related on January 20, 1972, that the scheduled
November 20, 1971 march in Washington was "crucial" to
all swe and YSA branches in that.it afforded an opportunity
for selling of "The Militant" and other SWP/YSA literature,
and also afforded an opportunity for "intervening " in the
action via distribution of SWP Election Campaign literature.

NY T-8 on February 11, 1972, and NY T-9 and NY T-10
on February 14, 1972, provided information that a WONAAC
convention was held February 11, 1972, to February 13, 1972,
at Hayden Hall, Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts.

The general theme of this convention was "How to Win
Abortion Law Repeal". NY T-8 stated that approximately -
30 members of the YSA or SWP Boston Chapters were eet haa
in attendance at this convention.

WY T-7 related on February 14, 1972, that because of the
de-escalation of the Vietnam War by the NIXON Administration,
the YSA-New York Local (NYL), while continuing on with
anti-war work through the NY Student Mobilization

Nw’'68262 Docld:32989546 Page 295



NY 100-174481 °°.

Committee (SMC) and NY National Peace Action Coalition
(NPAC), both of which organizations they dominate, would
also concentrate in the area of the Women's Liberation
Movement through their influence in WONAAC,

The SMC is controlled by the

SWP and its youth affiliate,
YSA. SMC initiates and supports :
public demonstrations against . te
the war in Southeast Asia.

NPAC was founded in 1970 by
members of the SWP. Its objec-
tive is the immediate, total
and unconditional withdrawal
of all US forces and material
in Southeast Asia.

NY T-7 advised on various dates, March 23, 1972,
through October 17, 1972, that activities of WONAAC were
dutifully reported and included on the agenda at regular
meetings of the Upper West Side Branch, YSA-New York Local
(NYL) during that period.

WY T-5 advised on April 18, 1972, that the leader-
ship of WONAAC was then dominated by the SWP..

NY T-7 related on July 7, 1972, that at a WONAAC
meeting held June 27, 1972, at 706 Broadway, NYC, NY,
starting at 6:40 PM, it was announced that even though
WOWAAC previously had accused various female activists
working along with them in the Women's Liberation struggle
of red baiting because of the stand they had taken against
the SWP-Young Socialist Alliance (YSA), at present they
are forced to work with these individuals to help strengthen
the WONAAC cause.

At this meeting, certain WONAAC staff members
walked out and voiced their disapproval of the meeting
being taken over by a majority of SWP-YSA members.

They indicated that the SWP-YSA has no right to be in a
policy-making position in WONAAC.

NW 68262 Docld:32989546 Page 296



NY 100-174481

‘ NY T-7 on-July 18, 1972, and NY T-11 on July 19,
1972, provided information that a WONAAC conference was
held at Hunter College, Park Avenue and 69th Street on
July 15, 1972 and July 16, 1972.

NY T-7 stated that NYC was picked as the site of
this convention because this city is considered to be
the center of the most powerful anti-abortion effort so ‘far.

Discussionshel4 at this conference centered on
plans for (one)-future activity in the campaign to repeal
all anti-abortion and contraception laws and (two)-to
end forced sterilization.

7 A discussion was held concerning the attacks
being made by the Catholic Church Hierarchy and other
anti-abortion groups against women's rights to their own
bodies.

NY T-11 related that the evening plenary session
of WONAAC occurred on July 15, 1972, and it was immediately
apparent that the SWP-YSA groups dominated the meeting.
Independent women who wanted to make statements during
this session were voted down by SWP floor leaders and
these same persons continued to vote as a block on all
issues.

The group of independent women from various
geographic areas, that is, those women who were not
associated with the SWP or YSA, went together after the
plenary session was adjourned and considered the problem

_ of how to handle the SWP leaders. While these women
were not political realists in their goals, they did
believe in working throughout the existing system rather
than functioning with the SWP in their eventual goal of
revolution.

It was decided that the independent feminists
would no longer continue hassling within WONAAC. They
did not want to have decisions for them being structured
by a male dominated group. They also decided that money
being collected by WONAAC in the name of abortion law

l NW 68262 Docld:32989546 Page 297



NY 100-174481

change was not being used for that purpose, but rather
to sustain members of the SWP-YSA.

The Sunday morhing session, July 16, 1972, was
labeled "Meeting to Discuss Internal Hassles." About 35
independents attended and a few number of SWP-YSA members.
and sympathizers were present. Independents there were
from New Haven, Boston, Detroit, New York (NY), Chicago,
Philadelphia, and San Francisco.

The independents did not waiver in their firm
opposition to SWP-YSA control of WONAAC. Six national
coordinators of WONAAC were independents and decided to
resign publicly at the afternoon plenary session. ‘They
also decided to combat SWP control of the feminist move-
ment through the various publications.

Or

There were approximately 700-800 women in atten-
f dance at the afternoon session. According to one of the
q SWP leaders, these women were from 31 states and three
iy countries-Canada, Italy and Sweden. The states that .had
a, more representation than others were Ohio, Illinois, New

York and Massachusetts.

Most of the problems and differences between the
independents and the SWP centered around approaches to
abortion law reform. The SWP was charged with always
having demonstrations and rallies and never doing any
work through the legislative process.

The independents stated that they were tired of
this hassle and that they believed there were more ef-
fective ways to change abortion laws than carrying placards
in the streets.

wary Tina. ‘ENNESS made a Fas piss FSF che indepen-
dent women to-feconsider. The etiowal of the independents ~
from WONAAC has debilitated the organization and most
independent representatives will be going back to their

own cities to work for abortion law change in organizations
which have no connection with the SWP.

The concern still exists, however, that WONAAC will
be able to collect monies in the name of abortion reform
and there is also the concern that women new to the move-
ment will join in a mistaken notion that they will be~™
furthering abortion law reform.

Independents vowed before leaving NY that they
would try to publicize activities from the SWP in an
effort to prevent this.

TIT. OBSERVATION OF CURRENT NATIONAL
STAFF MEMBER REGARDING YSA/SWP INFLUENCE

When contacted under pretext on November 24,
1972, CAROL EATON, self-identified as a current National
Staff member, and previously mentioned in this report,
related that she has been active in WONAAC since its
inception. EATON, while 2V°YF1D9 she is definitely not a
YSA, SWP, or member of any “radical group", acknowledged
there always have been SWP, YSA and "radical" elements
in WONAAC. She went on to state, however, that WONAAC
has never allied itself politically with any organization
or individual, including any of the political candidates
in the recent political election and, despite its diverse
makeup as too ideaological beliefs of its membership,
WONAAC is basically an organization which strives only
to the objectives for which it was originally founded.
To this end, she went on, WONAAC would accept help from
whatever source offered.

10



ny 100-174481

EATON admitted there were some problems in
the past with regard to friction within WONAAC about SWP
and YSA influence. She stated, however, this matter, to
her observation, never seemed a serious one, and is quite
minimal today. With regard to the "walk out" of six
national coordinators at the July, 1972 conference in NYC,
she stated the walk out did not occur, in fact, because
of the SWP/YSA influence question, but rather because :
those who walked out believed WONAAC should be a “referral

the aforementioned hearings and that several buses accommodating, ;
most of these individuals were scheduled to leave from Union ie

I. ORGANIZATION OF BOSTON WOMEN'S

ABORTION ACTION COALITION (BOWAAC)

BOWAAC, the local affiliate of the
Women's National Abortion Action
Coalition (WOHAAC), was formed out
of the local Female Liberation group;
and while BOWAAC is not exclusively
made up of Socialist Workers Party
(SWP), Boston, and Young Socialist
Alliance of Boston (YSA-B) female
members, it is controlled by members
of those groups.

WONAAC has been publicly described
aS an organization of groups whose
aim is to effect the overthrow of
existing abortion laws and to demand
free abortion on demand.

The SWP, Boston, is the local affiliate
and follows the aims and purposes of
the national SWP.

The SWP has been designated pursuant
to Executive Order 10450,

The YSA-B is the Boston affiliate
of the YSA, the youth organization
of the SWP.

A. Headquarters.

In late summer, 1972, BOWAAC moved its headquarters
from 552 Massachusetts Avenue, Camoridge, Mass., to
43.9 Boylston Street, Room 323, Boston, Massachusetts,

There are, however, currently a limited number of activists,
a maximum of fifteen, tne majority of whom are members of
the SWP and/or YSA in the Boston area, involved in BOWAAC
work, The number of activists is currently limited as
a number of the formerly active independents in the group
have recently dropped out of BOWAAC work feeling that
the United States Supreme Court decision reluxing legal
restraints on the practice of abortion has resolved the
abortion problems.

article entitled "Petition Filed for Vote on Abortion,”
which reported that representatives of an Abortion
Referendum Committee nad announced on September 7, 1972,
the filing of a petition to allow Massachusetts citizens
to vote on whether abortion should be legalized.
According to the article, representatives of BOWAAC
were among supporters of this Abortion Referendum
Committee.

’

A leaflet entitled "Speak Outrage ~ A Woman's
Right to Choose a Public Hearing" was distributed to the
public in the general Boston area during October, 1972,
to advertise a meeting at the Boston University, Boston,
Law Auditorium under the joint sponsorship of BOWAAC and
Female Liberation on October 28, 1972. According to the
leaflet, women would testify at this thering against
persons or institutions which nad victimizeé nem with
legal or illegal abortions or had denied them contraception,
voluntary sterilization or good pre-natal care, or had
sterilized them without their knowledge or consent.

topic, "Summary and Indictments. :

"The Militant" in its November 10, 1972,
edition carried an article which reported that on
October 28, 1972, 300 women had gathered at the Law
Auditorium of Boston University to hear testimony on
"Grimes Against Women." The article reported that the

Ty.

. As outlined in referenced New York letter, the /* a 1
New York Office noted, as far back as June, 1972, 16 C~
recognized that, although several leaders of WONAAC were
known to be SWP members, their activities, as pertaining to
“JONAAC, had been directed towrd the legal repeal of all
restrictive abortion laws, and investigation had disclosed
no indication that WONAAC, as an organization, had engaged in
any subversive or vidence prone activity. f

Referenced Bureau 0-7, referencing the aforementioned 7
communication, nevertheless instructed that the New Yok Office,
as office of origin, had overall responsibility for captioned
organization, and directed the New York Office to reopen its
ease and submit semi-annual reports.

A veview of the results of the continuing investigation
of WONAAC, together with all indices and references pertaining
thereto, since June 1972, reflects no apparent change in the
activities or the organization @ its membership from that
outlined above.

The New York Office is in accord with the view of the
Philadelphia Division, as set forth in its referenced letter,
that WONAAC represents basically a social change vehicle which,

In view of instructions set forth in Bureau
memorandum 10-73, dated 3/6/73, paragraph G, wherein the
Bureau reiterated its policy that the FBI has no interest
in individuals and organizations involved in legitimate
dissent and the recent United States Supreme Court decision
upholding the right to abortion, it appears continued
investigation of WONASC as such is not justified.

™he New York Office further concurs with the
Philadelphia view that continued investigation of the SWP
and/or YSA would produce the desired coverage and information
concerning its members who are associated or active in WONAAC.

UACB, the New York Office is closing the investigation
of this organization.

00: NEW YORK

RePHlet 2/28/73.

The Women's National Abortion Action Conlition (WONAAC)
has been the subject of 2 separate investigation by. the Bureau
in numerous offices, In referenced letter, Philadelphia pointed
out that WONAAC represents a basic social change dealing with
abortion rights and that in view of the fact the ¥.S, Supreme
Court upheld the right of abortion, the continued investigation
of WONAAC at this time does not appear to be desirable and
should be discontinued, Philadelphia alse suggested that
continued investigation of the Socialist Workers Party (SWP)
and its youth group, the Young Secialist Alliance (YSA), should
determine pertinent activities of VONAAC.

After careful consideration of this matter, the Bureau
agrees with the observations of the Philadelphia Office that the
investigation of WONAAC should be discontinued, However, in view
of the fact that WONAAC is dominated and controlled by the SWP, a
Trotskyist communist organization cited by the Attorney General
pursuant. to Executive Order 10450, it is the respensibility of the
Bureau to investigate and report pertinent information relating
to the extent of SWP domination and control of captioned
organization.

Therefore, recipients should close separate
investigations concerning WONAAC, In the future, report above-
described information regarding WONAAC under appropriate subheading
in the sup semiannual organizational reports,

Re Philadelphia letter to Bureau dated 1/31/73
and Bureau letter to Philadelphia dated 2/12/73. 7

For the information of New York, referenced Bureau
letter to Philadelphia dated 2/12/73 authorized a continued
investigation of WONAAC utilizing only established sources,

‘~\ The Bureau further advised that the investigation was to be.

" conducted in a most discreet manner and that no action was

§ |."°, reviewed as well as all indices references to captioned
an i organization and it has been determined that while some o:
,|' ° the individuals associated with WONAAC in the Philadelphia
area are also known to be affiliated with the Socialist
if Workers Party (SWP) and for the Young Socialist Alliance N
(YSA), the majority of WONAAC supporters appear to be |
: individuals interested in,social change rather than revolu-
. tionary political changad /: 3

In view of the fact: aad WONAAC represents basically
a social change vehicle dealing with the single issue of
abortion rights and the fact that a recent U. S. Supreme
Court decision upheld the right to abortion, thereby reducing
the political value of this issue, it would appear that a

desirable.

This folder reflected women's disagreement with
the Nixon administration's policy in regards to Indochina,
and states, in part, as follows:

“Our sisters in Vietnam have stretched forth a hand
to us. They are our example, We answer them with our strength
together. Women are marching against the Pentagoh yon April
10. With dignity and rage we march against the American
Medical Association and its health system that cares nothing
about the health of the people. We march against the
partnership between police and organized crime, which makes
heroin a big business----- silently endorsed by those who
‘govern us', We march against politicians, hustlers and
kickback men, whose corruption and crimes are paid for by the
people. We march against the injust court system, and for the
freeing of all political prisores."

The folder indicated that contributions for the

627 Amsterdam Avenue, NYC (212) 847-6696," and-°
information regarding transportation and child care could
be obtained from the "New York Office."

"Grant's Tomb", a community newspaper, upper west
side, New York City (NYC), March, 1971, Number 2 Issue, page
_ 10, contained an article captioned, "Women March on
Washington? This article reflected, in part, as follows:

“Out of the outrage against the war that was the unifying

force of the Ann Arbor conference, the women's caucus decided
to channel our frustration into a public statement calling for
& women's march on Washington, D.C, on April 10. We all felt
the urgency to show how we as women feel oppressed by the same
U.S. system that needs the dominance of men over women, white
over black, brown and,yellow,heterosexuel over homopexual, and
over poor to support the aggressive war policy that is killing
ow Vietnamese sisters and brothers,------

"We are making this march one step in showing the
world our solidarity. as women with all our sisters in Vietnam
who are fighting for their lives. The Committee to Defend the
Right to Live, a South Vietnamese women's organization, has
called for our support." : :

The confidential source mentioned above on March
15, 1971, furnished information that on March 11, 1971, a
"women's meeting" was held at Washington Square Methodist
Church, 135 West 4th Street, New York, New York (NY).
Approximately 70 people were present. It appears to the source
that the Pentagon action April.10th is being led by the same
. women,in the SWomen's Union", who are planning the trip to :
/ Toronto, CanadaNin late Merch, 1971. The only decision arrived
/ at during the meeting, according to the source, was that on
“the scheduled date, April 10th, there will be a march on the

Women's National March
on the Pentagon, April’1o, 1971 -

Reference is made to New York memorandum
dated March 16, 1971.

On March 24, 1971, a source, who has furnished
reliable information in the past, advised that on March 22,
1971, a "Committee for April 10" held a meeting at the Law
Commune Office, 640 Broadway, New York City (NYC), which
was attended by 30 to 40 females. It was learned that a
woman from the New York (NY) group was already in Washington,
D.C, working with others there to arrange permits, speakers,
et cetera, for the womens march on the Pentagon on April 10,
1971. It was stated that it was easier to obtain a permit
for a march from the Justice Department to the Pentagon,
than from the Pentagon to the Justice Department, but that
no permit had been obtained as yet. It was pointed out that
a march from the Pentagon to the Justice Department was
preferred as there would be less chance of losing marchers
en route to the Justice Department than from marching
from the Justice Department to the Pentagon. It was stated
that no buses had been chartered at NY, but it was hoped that
15 buses would be needed,

Law Commune

On September 16, 1969, a second source, who

has furnished reliable information in the

past, advised that the Law Commune is not an

organization in the usual serise of the word.

It is rather a law firm comprised of a group

of lawyers interested and sympathetic to the

New Left and Black Power organizations, and who

counsel and defend individuals in these groups

as the occasion arises. They likewise permit

their premises to be used on occasion as a meeting
‘ place for these organizations and distribute

some of their literature.

On March 25, 1971, the second advised that as of
now there is much confusion over the mechanical aspects of
the Women's National March on April 10, 1971, and that the
people in Washington, D.C. will make the ultimate decision
regarding the route of the march, The source stated that
in NY, information concerning buses for Washington, D.C.
will be available at the Upper West Side Women's Center,
627 Amsterdam Avenue, NYC, telephone number 874-6696.

On March 24, 1971, the second source made available
a piece of literature sent out by the "April 10 Women's
Committee" concerning the national women's march on the i
Pentagon on April 10. This literature contained in part as I
follows:

"we are going to the Pentagon on April 10 to
serve notice on our enemies that women are moving against
them. Our urgency and our fury at the expansion of the
Indochinese war and our rage at the repression of our black
and brown sisters and brothers needs expression right now,
We are joining with other women to struggle for the everyday
things we need and against whatever and whoever prevents us
from getting them.

"we need and want our sisters around the country
to build for this action in their own ways, and to communicate
with other sisters their ideas, suggestions and criticisms.
This is a temporary contact list which came out of the Ann
Arbor Conference:

Women's National March
on the Pentagon, April 10, 1971

Reference is made to New York (NY) memorandum
dated March 26, 1971.

On March 30, 1971, a source, who has furnished
reliable information in the past, advised that on March
26, 1971, a "Committee for April 10" rad a meeting at
the McIntosh Student Union, Barnard College, New York City
(NYC), to plan and organize for the Women's March on the
Pentagon on April 10, 1971. The meeting was attended by
30 individuals and had no chairman,

The source stated that at the above meeting, two
representatives,man and wife, from an "Action Committee"
on certain islands near Okinawa,planned a march on April
10, 1971 in Washington, D.C, to protest giving over to
Japan what they feel to be Chinese islands. This march is
to begin at 1:00 p.m. at the Washington Monument, up |
Massachusetts Avenue to the State Department, and possibly 1
on to the Japanese Embassy. Support of the women's group
was requested; however, after the two left the meeting, the
"Committee for April 10" decided not to support the Chinese
mareh on the grounds that they were too "liberal."

Women's National March on
the Pentagon, April 10, 1971

The source advised that at the above meeting, it
was stated that no permit had been obtained as yet for the
Women's March on the Pentagon on April 10, 1971. It was
stated that the march will proceed from a "grassy spot" at the
Justice Department at noon, past the Bureau of Indian Affairs,
Department of the Interior, Department of Labor and on to
the Pentagon, An hour at each end of the march would be
allowed for speakers, though the group doubted they would use
it. Guerrilla theatre activity by participating groups in
front of the various government buildings was discussed and-
encouraged, though specifics were not mentioned,

The source stated that at the above meeting, copies
of a letter to Madame Binh, head of the Vietcong delegation
to the Paris peace talks and the North Vietnamese in Paris,
were passed out, describing the purpose of the April 10 march.
This letter is get forth as follows:

"March 25, 1971
"Dear Mme. Binh,

"On April 10, many of us American women will be
marching on the Pentagon. You know already of the other
actions being planned here against the war. As women, we
are coming out from separate cities and roles, trying to
create reality out of what we once held looked up in ow
imaginations. In marching on the Pentagon, we are joining with
all people inside and outside of Amerika, who fight against
Eran attempt to control us.

"We've been conditioned so long to accept Amerika's
definition of us as weak, passive, and powerless, and to deny
all our feelings of love and strength, that it has been a
struggle for us to turn towards each other and fight for our
freedom,

"Your own long struggle in Indochina, and the struggle
of Third World people here at home, awakened us to the
destruction that Amerikan power represents all over the world.
Your many victories against that power have been an inspiration
to us. But it-wasn't until we joined together to examine and
share our own experiences as women in Amerika that we saw

NW 68262 Docld:32989546 Page 355 -2-



Women's National March on
the Pentagon, April 10, 1971

ourselves not only as your supporters, but as sisters ina
revolutionary struggle for the liberation of all people,

"We are becoming women of the revolution, working
in our own way to stop the bombs from dropping in your land,
at the same time that we work to build day care centers, health
clinics, and a whole culture that will come from and respond
to the needs of all the people, not just the rich and the
powerful, The enormous anger and energy of sisters together
is a force that confuses and terrifies the rulers of Amerika.

"It's so incredibly hard for us to write what
we're feeling, to express to you and our Vietnamese sisters
and brothers the depth and strength of our love and solidarity.

"Tidings of revolutionary joy from sisters inside
Amerika,

"In love and respect,
"April loth Women's Committee"

STUDENTS FOR A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY

Students for a Democratic Society, commonly

known as SDS, came into existence at a founding convention

7 held during June, 1962, at Port Huron, Michigan. From an yl
initial posture of "participatory democracy," Marxist-
-Leninist ideology of various shadings became predominant
during 1968-1969 with debate centering on how best to create
a revolutionary youth movement. SDS moved from involvement
in the civil rights struggle to an anti-Vietnam war position
to advocacy of a militant anti-imperialist line linking up
the oppressed peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America
with the black liberation movement in the United States.
All major factions within SDS embrace Marxism-Lenism
and identify internationally with China, Cuba and North
Vietnam as countries leading the worldwide struggles
against the United States. However, the Soviet Union
was regarded as imperialist end with the Communist Party,
United States of America, "x: visionist" in nature.

SDS operated under a national constitution which
called for an annual Nationa’ Convention (NC) and quarterly
National Council meetings wherein programs were initiated
and debated. Three'’national officers were elected annually’
with a National Interim Committee to run the organization.
Regional offices and college chapters elected delegates to
the national meetings but each functioned independently on
local matters. Its official publication "Fire" (formerly
"New Left Notes") last appeared in december, 1969.

Internal factionalism of serious proportions
developed during 1968 - 1969 and tie following three factions
evolved as a result of a split at *he June, 1969, NC:
Weatherman, Worker Student Alliance (WSA), and Revolutionary
Youth Movement (RYM). The effect of the split on SDS chapters
throughout the country was divisive. Some aligned with one
or the other of the three major factions. Others, unable to
identify with any faction, disassociated with SDS completely
and changed names.

The SDS national office in recent years was
located at 1608 West Madison Street, Chicago, Illinois. It
was closed in February, 1970,

THERMAN

Initially called the "Action Faction," Weatherman

¢ came into being immediately before the dune, 1969, Students
for a Democratic Society (SDS) National Convention (NC).
At this NC Weatherman won all three national officer positions
and a majority of the National Interim Committee as well.
Subsequently, they took over the SDS National Office (NO)
in Chicago, and controlled its funds, paper and national
records, Although internal struggle existed until late 1969,
Weatherman for all major purposes controlled SDS nationally
from June, 1969, until its NO closed in February, 1970. At
this time it no longer considered itself part of SDS.

The term Weatherman emerged from an ideological
paper prepared by its leaders entitled "You Don't Weed a
Weatherman to Know Which Way the Wind Blows" (“New Left
Hotes" June 18, 1969). This statement outlined the basic
stance of Weatherman: Marxist-Leninist in content but with
strong advocacy that action not theory would bring about
revolution in the United States. this posture was complemented
with an international identification to the Cuban revolution
and CASTRO's statement that the duty of a revolutionary is
to make revolution,

During October, 1969, Weatherman riots in
Chicago resulted in more than 260 arrests for mob action
and related charges. A program of armed struggle was
finalized during a December, 1969, “War Council" wherein
tenrorist tactics and political assassination were
contemplated. The basic strength of Weatherman was then
revealed to be some 300 - 350 nationally and geographically
apportioned to the Midwest, New York, and some Northwest.

: As its rhetoric of violence escalated, Weatherman
leaders increasingly discussed the necessity of an underground
operation wherein more than 90 percent of the organization
would be submerged; "affinity groups" of three - five members
would function independently. In February, 1970, Weatherman

7 leaders announced a program of "strategic sabotage" with
police and military installations as primary targets.

WORKER STUDENT ALLIANCE/
. PROGRESSIVE LABOR PARTY

A source advised during August, 1969, that at
the National Convention (NC) of Students for a Democratic
Society (SDS) held in Chicago, [llinois, during June, 1969,
a split arose between the Progr2ssive Labor Party (PLP) and
the National Office (NO), the N) becoming known as the
Weatherman faction. The PLP faction drew the largest
support among those in attendance at the NC.

Source further advisei that during late Summer,
1969, the PLP faction of SDS established its National
Headquarters (NH) on the second floor of a loft-type
building at 173A Massachusetts Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts.
The campaign on which the PLP faction centered was to build
a worker student alliance or a campus worker student
alliance. Thus, they adopted the names of Worker Student
Alliance (WSA) or Campus Worker Student Alliance.

Source stated that the "New Left Notes," printed
in New York City, is the official publication of the WSA
faction.

A second source advis2d during January, 1970,
that within the SDS, the WSA is a caucus of which the PLP
constitutes the leadership.

A third source advisei during July, 1970, that
during demonstrations staged ir the Boston area during the
Spring and Summer of 1970 by th2 NH, the main theme of
previous demonstrations staged sy the NH shifted from
protestations of the Vietnam Wer and other United States
foreign policy matters to attac<ing domestic issues such
as racism and unemployment and jemonstrating support of
the "workers' struggle."

Characterizations of the SDS
and PLP are set out s2parately.

REVOLUTIONARY YOUTH MOVEMENT 5 i

A source advised that the Revolutionary Youth
Movement IIT (RYMII) faction of Students for a Democratic
Society (SDS) held a national conference at Atlanta, Georgia,
from November 26 to 30, 1969. At this conference it was
decided to form a new organization to be known as Revolutionary
Youth Movement (RYM), characterized as a mass anti-imperialist
youth organization, said organization being proposed as
separate and distinct in form and content from SDS. The
"Principles of Unity" adopted by the conference included a
struggle against white supremacy and male supremacy; fights
against imperialism, anticommunism, fascism and oppression
of youth; and support of the right of self-determination of
all "oppressed nations," also support of the right of all
“oppressed and exploited" peoples "to armed self-defense."
It was agreed that RYM would not be a Marxist-Leninist
organization; however, source said this was decided in order
to indicate an organization broad enough in form to be
acceptable to everyone.. A temporary National Steering
Committee (NSC) made up of eight females and two males was
elected to govern RYM until national officers could be
elected during the Spring of 1970.

RYM publications have listed the RYM National Office
(NO) at Post Office Box 5421 and Post Office Box 77012 C,
both Atlanta, Georgia, and a second source has advised that
the NO has no office space but would probably be considered as
located at Apartment 27, 1067 Alta Avenue, Northeast, Atlanta.

Second source advised that women dominated the
founding conference and have continued to dominate NSC
meetings to the point that "women's liberation" has apparently
become the RYM's principal issue - also that RYM's poor
financial condition has resulted in its failure to publish
a paper. During early 1970, RYM has decided to cater to
the working class rather than youth, since the potential for
social revolution lies in workers.

A third source has stated that it was decided at
the March, 1970, NSC meeting that RYM women had decided the
organization will be molded into a "working class, Marxist-
Leninist, revolutionary, anti-imperialist, problack
nationalist, people's women's liberation organization."

A characterization of the SDS
is set out separately.

PROGRESSIVE LABOR PARTY

The "New York Times" city edition Tuesday,
April 20, 1965, Page 27, reported that a new party of
"revolutionary socialism": was formally founded on April 18,
1965, under the name of the Progressive Labor Party (PLP),
which had been known as the Progressive Labor Movement.

According to the article, "The Progressive Labor
Movement was founded in 1962, by MILTON ROSEN and MORTIMER
SCHEER after they were expelled from the Communist Party of
the United States for assertedly following the Chinese
Communist line."

.A source advised on June 3, 1968, that the PLP
held its Second National Convention in New York City, May 31,
to June 2, 1968, at which time the PLP reasserted its
objective of the establishment of a militant working class
movement based on Marxism-Leninism.

The source also advised that at the Second National
Convention, MILTON ROSEN was unanimously re-elected National
Chairman of the PLP and LEVI LAUB, FRED JEROME, JARED ISRAEL,
WILLIAM EPTON, JACOB ROSEN, JEFFREY GORDON and WALTER LINDER
were elected as the National Committee to lead the PLP until
the next convention,

The PLP publishes "Progressive Labor," a bimonthly
magazine, and "Challenge-Desafio," a monthly newspaper,

Source advised on May 25, 1970, that the PLP
utilizes an address of General Post Office Box 808, Brooklyn,

New York, and also utilizes an office in Room 617, 1 Union

Women's Bail Fund

oe

Unless otherwise stated, all sources in
this memorandum have furnished reliable
information in the past.

On March 30, 1971, @ fist confidential source
furnished literature, concerning the Women's Bail Fund, which
was picked up at the Upper Westside Womens Center, 627
Amsterdam Avenue, New York, New York (NY) on March 27, 1971.
The literature captioned, "Women's Bail Fund" argued that the
Women's House of Detention, in New York City (NYC), should
not exist and that "the Women's House of Detention, along with the
risons and jails across the country, is a weapon used by the
power structure here in America to oppress and exploit the people
of poor communities." It further relates that "Women have come
together in New York from many different organizations to form a
Women's Bail Fund for all the sisters inside the House of
Deention, The Bail Fund is also working to prepare simple a
pamphlets on law because of the total lack of any legal
resources in the House of Detention and secure legal assistance
where needed." The address is listed as the Women's Bail Fund,
P.O. Box 637, Cooper Station, NY, NY 10003.

on August 26, 1971, the first source furnished
literature on the Women's Bail Fund which stated, "The Women's
Bail Fund is a coalition of Third World and white women who are:

".....raising bail to release women prisoners from
Rikers Island,

",..establishing communication with women inside,

" ...assisting women who are bailed out in meeting
their needs,

"....providing legal information for prisoners,
".,..making public the torture these women undergo.
" ..supporting prison struggles everywhere."

On April 12, 1971, a second confidential source
made available a flyer on the Women's Bail Fund which was
distributed at the National Womens March on the Pentagon on
April 10, 1971. The flyer, eaptioned, "Victory to the NLF and All
\ Oppressed Peoples" states “Women in Vietnam and in the United
States are fighting for the right to live: for the very right
to exist.....the U.S, is now dotted with concentration camps for
the poor and non-white: the jails.....But imprisonment doesnt!
preak the spirit of the sisters in jail. They resist! When denied
their dignity, the organize and fight back. When one sister is
peaten they organiz and resist, In the coldest part of winter
| when the boilers had broken down, the women worked in freezing
temperatures in cold water to do the laundry-not 'because the
{ pigs made us do it - but for our ‘own beautiful sisters.' .....We
| Vietnamese, Black, Latin, White and Asian-american women are
united in our struggle - we share common gdals and face @ common
enemy. We express our complete solidarity with the NLF and shall
work to bring the victory there." .

On May 14, 1971, Special Agents (SAS) of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) observed a demonstration in front
of the NYC Women's House of Detention sponsored by the Women's
Bail Fund and Youth Against War and Fascism (YAWF). The
demonstrators chanted slogans calling for release of their
"sisters" from jail and expressed opposition to a proposed move
of the inmates of the Women's House of Detention from its
downtown site to the Rikers Island Prison Facility. The
demonstrators called this proposed move an attempt to isolate
the "sisters from their supporters."

By means of a loudspeaker, the demonstrators called to
several inmates of the House of Detention who appeared in the
upper storey windows, obtained their names and place of arrest.
This information allegedly was to be used to obtain bail for the
prisoners in question, Thereafter, several speakers denounced
the jails as concentration camps and called for the release of the
"political prisoners."|n the House of Detention, Among the
speakers was shirley taylor of the Women's Bail Fund and a
formér inmate of thé Women's House of Detention,

Women's Bail Fund

A first confidential source advised that sewer ism,
Channel 13 News, 304 West 58th. Street,.New York, New York,
is affiliated with the Women’s Bail Fund (WBF). ee

An article appeared in the March, 1972 issue of
the "Liberated Guardian", captioned "Women's Bail Fund;
Organizing Our Anger", written by five unidentified members
of the Women's Bail Fund Collective.

The article relates "The Women's Bail Fund is a
group of about 35 women in New York City that bails women
out of jail (150 so far). They have been organized for over
a year and a half and did their first bailout on December 20,
1970, They have been active in supporting other groups
involved in the prison struggle. They do legal follow-up
for bailed-out sisters who want it and have been talking
with people about the prison struggle, why jails exist, who
the real enemies are, etcetera."

The article is introduced by the following
statement:

"For this article we wanted to talk about ourselves.
So five of us volunteered to collect different thoughts from
as many women as possible in our group and then pooled these
reflections in this article, using the words from their raps."

The article, being reflections of the various
members of the group, is a series of quotes by unidentified
members concerning the WBF.

Women's Bail Fund

The following are reflections of some WBF
members carried under the subcaption "Our Roots - Why
We Started - Why We Joined",

"There was a woman in my consciousness-raising
group who was in the bail fund when it was first getting
started and she talked with others about it. To some of
us it was a very exciting idea. To others it was
frightening - connecting to political activity as women.
Ultimately it ended in a split of my small group on
whether we should carry our newly raised consciousness
to any sort of feminist political action or not.

"In the past, I was politically frustrated because
I was only involved in one-shot actions. I saw what was
happening in terms of how this system functions to oppress
black people and that resulted inalot of pain for me. I
felt I had to reflect my stands in a day-to-day struggle.
I had the sense that the women in the WBF were also aware
of that need.

"When sisters want us to, we go to court with them.
When I go to court I find that it can do bad things to my
head. I make judgements like this judé is better than another
one, but it's all shit. All judges are pigs. Or like
feeling good that a sister got six months instead of five
years when she shouldn't have gotten anything at all.

"I was in the House of Detention when there was the
bail fund demonstration on December 20, 1970. The whole
tier was so excited. When someone saw the first people she
let out a scream and everyone rushed to the windows. As
the chanting increased outside we started to sing and chant.
They locked us in our cells so each person would be isolated
and intimidated about chanting. But all the women kept it
up. Everyone inside said the feeling about this demonstration
was different than other demonstrations. There had been more
contact. The women saw Afeni and Joan and another woman
that they had known inside outside in the demonstration.

That was real important.

"A lot of it was the bail fund. The bail fund
banner with the address made it real that people were serious
about supporting people inside. It wasn't going to be a
one+shot deal,

; ~ GONPEDENETAE &
= Women's Bail Fund
The following are reflections carried junder the
sub-caption "Questions We Are Facing Right Now".

"There's a real dialectic between reform ad
revolution. So much of what we do is short-term support
stuff that can be seen as reformist. When prisoners raise
these demands it's understood to be revolutionary; when
people on the outside raise them, they are felt to be
reformist. I have done a whole lot of courtroom work,
both in the bail fund and before too. In fact, the whole
social work thing is what I come out of, which is why it
is so hard for me to deal with all this (‘cause I obviously
reflect a lot of that work). Social work when it started
back in the late 1800's and early 1900's came out of real
radical circles, the radicals and feminists and such. And
when you read MAO, he talks about service to the people
as a revolutionary thing. But for us it feels weird
because it has been co-opted. I think that the movement
now, trying to recoup the revolutionary aspects, that
original sense of service to the people, trying to help
people survive.

"One of the ways to really keep ourselves -
out of the rut of being social workers is to engage in
more political education among ourselves and to ask other
groups how they've dealt with this question. Also we
should be more involved in educating other people.

"We should be doing more for women inside. We
need to really work on facilitating communications
between the sisters inside the jail. Women prisoners
have been slower to get organized but I'm sure this is
because there is so much isolation in the women's jail.
Concretely, we need to write more letters to find out what
is going on, send literature, but also tell the women about
each other, about what other women are thinking and feeling.
This would stop the sense of aca and increase the
sense of solidarity.

"I think much of the movement is guilty of
ultra-leftism, In China the Communists worked on a lot
of things that were a lot less than what they ultimately
wanted. We're too afraid of being contaminated by being
involved in reform movements. We too often define our
enemies too broadly and our allies too narrowly.

"I've been real impressed with what women in the
group are willing to commit themselves to do and that they
fulfill those commitments. And that atmosphere of res-
ponsibility affects new members too. This is real
important. It helps me through the rough times and all
the ideological hassles and struggles we go through.

You really have a sense that everyone really wants to work
things through, search for solutions, wants to hold
together because we feel responsible for the work, “Even
the way people ask for leaves of absence when they are
sick or too busy, that they feel they want to explain

why they have to stop doing work for a while, shows
people's commitment and responsibility."

.The "Liberated Guardian" was created in
April, 1970, through active and violent
dissent against the politics and policies

| of the "Guardian", Its major aims were

to produce a "more revolutionary" paper,

to operate collectively within it and to
maintain by design a loose political position.

The "Guardian" is self-described as an
“independent radical newsweekly" which
takes a strong left position but is not
identified with any organized group. It
is considered to be the largest radical
weekly in America.

A second confidential source advised an account
for the WBF was opened on July 6, 1971, for $3,500. The
account was closed ten days later on July 16, 1971. This
account was opened by PatriciayReiner of 2451 Aldrich ~
Avenue South, Minneapolis. Reiner, on August 30, 1971,
submitted a forwarding address of 855 South Gedar Lane,
Valparaiso, Indiana, 46383.

A third confidential source advised the WBF’
set aside money for ConstanceXTrimble at the First National
Bank, Minneapolis, Minnesota. "The source advised two accounts
were opened for the WBF on behalf’ of Trimble. One account
was a savings account in the amount of $2,000; the other
was ia checking account in the amount of $2,800. ‘The

trustees for these accounts were listed as Neil BiDietrich |

Constance Trimble was tried and found
not guilty on a charge of first degree
murder for making a telephone call
which lured a St. Paul, Minnesota
police officer to an ambush slaying
which occurred in 1970,

On April 5, 1972, and April 8, 1972, a fourth

confidential source advised Jennifer Dohrn and Judith
Clark were in contact with various members of the WBF

NW 68262 Docld:32989546 Page 429

on these two days.

Judith Ann Clark is a member of the
Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) -
Weatherman faction and was underground
in_1970 prior to her arrest on December 17,
1970 by Special Agents (SAS) of the FBI
New York City, as a result of an outstanding
arrest wanted for unlawful flight to avoid
rosecution - mob action. Clark was
indicted by a Federal Grand Jury at
Chicago, Illinois in April, 1970, prior
to her arrest. She was sentenced to
three years, for which she spent nine
months in the Cook County Jail, Chicago,
Illinois, and was released in July, 1971,
to serve the remaining time on probation
in New York City. :

Jennifer Ellen Dohrn is the sister of
FBI Top Ten Fugitive Bernadine Rae Dohrn.
Both sisters are alleged members of

the SDS - Weatherman faction.

SDS was founded during June, 1962, at

Port Huron, Michigan, and in the 1960's
functioned as the leading New Left campus-
based student organization in the United
States, From a stance of "participatory
democracy," the SDS moved to a radical-
revolutionary position. It maintained a
national office at 1608 West Madison Street,

Chicago, Illinois, until February, 1970.
Internal factionalism during 1969 produced
three main factions: Weatherman, Revolutionary
Youth Movement (RYM), and Worker Student
Alliance (WSA). The Weatherman and RYM no
longer consider themselves associated with

the SDS. The WSA faction continues to use

the name SDS.

On April 14, 1972, a fifth confidential source
advised that Judith Clark was in touch on April 3, 1972,
with a Beth Last Name Unknown (LNU), at 466 East 48th
Street, Brooklyn, New York, concerning the WBF.

The source advised that Clark, on November 5,
1972, was in touch with an unknown female and discussed
the Wednesday night meeting of the WBF. Clark discussed
the fact that Jeannie LNU, Estelle LNU and Laurie LNU
would be at the meeting at 5:30 PM, that evening at Clark's
residence. The source related that Sara LNU and Naomi LNU,
both from the Defense Bail Fund, were also expected at
the meeting. Clark discussed the fact that the WBF
has no common politics and no common political direction
at this point and the WBF could become a defense committee,
not because it would be desireable, but because of a lack
of any other direction.

The source\advised that.on the same day, Clark

was in touch with Lobenstine from the WBF at telephone
number 663-1136, and both agreed to attend an education
meeting of the Fund. - ot

The fifth confidential source further related
that Clark was in contact, on April 8, 19%2, witha | +
Marilyn Dalismer, 254-4498, and a ShelleyMawxence, [=~
663-1136. Both were identified by the sourke as being
associated with the WBF.

Re New York airtel and LHM, 8/28/72, and captioned

as above.

On 11/28/72, \NY_7615-S) advised the Women's Bail Fund
(WBF) is not a leading 'eTémént and lacks any influence in the

movement in New York City.

A review of the subject file discloses there is no
structure to the WBF and that it is a coalition of women who
belong to various groups in the New York City area, whose main

purpose is to raise funds for selected women in jail.

It is noted that Weatherman subjects have contacted
those involved in the bail fund. However, have decryed the
lack of political direction of the WBF and would like to turn
it into a defense committee because of a lack of any other
direction, There is no indication that this has occurred, and | -

the bail fund still remains a loose coalition of like-minded

individuais from various groups seeking to raise funds for. :
various purposes. Because of its lack of common political dir- -
ection, it has had no influence and presently is ineffective in’

the movement.

In view of the above, the NYO is discontinuing investi-

a

gation in this matter to be reopened upon receipt of pertinent
information from sources that the bail fund is being redirected
as a structured group for a common political and ideological

Boston file 100-38735 entitled “EVAN PATCHEN
DELLINGER, aka PATCH DELLINGER; SM ~- ANARCHIST (BUFILE
100- 450988)" reflected that DELLINGER was subject of
Boston investigation based on his participation in a
"Teach-In" and Rededication Service on 1/29/68 at the
Arlington St. Church, Boston, During the above activity,
DELLINGER made a statement in support of the "Resistance
Group" and turned in Avni was reported to be Selective
Service cards.

The primary function of the Resistance Group
was to aid, abet, and counsel young men faced with the.
draft,

EVAN PATCHEN DELLINGER graduated from Swarthmore
College, Swarthmore, Pa., on 6/6/66 majoring in economics,
He was arrested at Chester, Pa. on 4/1/64 and was charged
with disorderly conduct. 5

The 1968-59 Harvard University Directory of
Officers and Students reflected that DELLINGER was enrolled
in the School of Medicine, Harvard University, Cambridge,
Mass,

It had been reported that PATCH DELLINGER was
present at a Socialist Workers Party (SHP) Street Meeting
in New York City on 7/21/64.

The file further disclosed that inasmuch as the
Boston office had no current information associating DELLIN-
GER with the SWP or the Young Socialist Alliancé and that
his activities on behalf of the New England Resistance were
pacifist in nature, it was felt that DELLINGER did not
warrant inclusion on the Security or Agitator Indexes main-
tained at that time;and thus, the case was placed in a closed
status,

A xeview of Boston file 25-25585 (Bufile 25-569484)
reflected that DELLINGER was also subject of ‘investigation
based on his participation in the previously mentioned
Rededication Services at the Arlington St. Church in Boston
on 1/29/68 at which 23 individuals turned in either a
Notice of Classification and/or a Registration Certificate.
Two other individuals turned in some other type of, document.
It was determined that DELLINGER had turned in a Selective .
Service Registration Certificate and two Notices of Classi-
fication issued by LB #28, Flemington, New Jersey. Also,

a two-page statement signed PATCHEN DELLINGER supporting
the Resistance movement was turned in.

In April, 1972, AUSA, Boston declined any prosecu-.

7 On 8/21/72, personnel of the Office of the Mass.
Commissioner of Probation, Suffolk County Courthouse, Boston,
a central repository for all traffic and criminal conviction

On January 13, 1972, WF T-2 provided a copy of the
January, 1972 issue of the "Furies" Newspaper.

A review of this issue revealed the following
self description:

"The Furies is a new lesbian-feminist newspaper
for every woman who has ever been raped, physically,
economically or psychologically. We take the name FURIES,
Now Goddesses of Vengeance and protectors of woman, as
we want to build a movement in this country, and in the.
world which can effectively stop the violent, sick, oppressive
acts of male supremacy.

The paper includes letters, articles, fiction, poetry,
news, and graphics, as well as information about various
literature for women."

The initial issue of the "Furies" Newspaper indicated
that "this paper is printed by the Sojourner Truth Press

collective in Atlanta, Georgia."

II. ACTIVITIES

On March 20, 1972, WF T-3 advised that the "Furies"
is a gay newspaper for women in which the political line is
the fight against racism and repression by men. Source advised
that the members of the "Furies" believe that if you do not
follow these general programs you are not a feminist.



WFO 100-55290

Source knew of no radical revolutionary tendencies
or activities being planned or contemplated by any of the
"Furies" members.

On April 10, 1972, WF T-4 advised that several months
ago, when several girls moved into the residence at 219 llth
Street, S.E., Washington, D.C., they were observed carrying
what appeared to be a printing press into the basement of the
apartment.

Source advised that several females frequented the
house and one of the girls has a baby. Source advised that most
of the girls who frequented the address have extremely short
hair and always wear slacks.

On July 13, 1972, WF T-5 advised that three women,
SUSAN HATHAWAY, SUSAN SCHWING, and COLETTA REID originally
rented the house located at 219 llth Street, S.E., Washington,
D.C, Source had no background information on any of these
women and was not aware of anyone else residing at the
residence. Source has received no complaints about the
residence from the neighbors.

On July 7, 1972, WF T-6 advised that the Sojourner
Truth Press in Atlanta, Georgia, was a printing press for
hire, which prints mostly "New Left" material for "New
Left" organizations, yet it espouses no opinions of its own.
As long as their fee is met, they will print what is
desired, i.e. papers, pamphlets, flyers, etc.

On September 11, 1972, WF T-7 advised that the Sojourner
Truth Press had gone out of business on August 15, 1972,
due to a lack of funds. Source also advised that the individuals
connected with the Sojourner Truth Press were planning on
leaving Atlanta.

On September 13, 1972, a telephone call was made to
telephone number 688-6222, the telephone number for the
Sojourner Truth Press, Atlanta, Georgia, and a recorded voice
advised that service for that telephone number had been dis-
continued.

On July 13, 1972, WF T-4 advised that several young
white girls continued to reside at 219 llth Street, S.E.,
Washington, D.C. They appear friendly, but keep very much
to themselves.

On August 23, 1972, this source advised that
| apparently four or five young white girls now live at
i 219 llth Street, S.E. Source has seen numerous different
| girls frequenting the residence, but is unsure exactly
how many reside there at the present time.

| :

One girl, name unknown, who resides at the residence,
has stated to source she is a music teacher. Source has
seen several girls on different occasions carrying what
appeared to be newspapers. Source states that all the girls
are generally quiet and keep to themselves.

On September 13, 1972, WF T~5 advised that SUSAN
HATHAWAY, SUSAN SCHWING and COLETTA REID still rent and
apparently reside at 219 llth Street, S.E., Washington, D.C.

Source stated that these three girls continue to
pay their monthly rent promptly and she said that each
| of the girls takes turns paying the rent each month.

| Source related that when the dwelling was rented to
these three girls, they made a remark that they were employed
by a "research organization", name unknown, and did most of
their research at the Library of Congress.

Source stated that she has not been in the dwelling

at 219 llth Street, S.E., since it was rented to these three

girls, but she has received no complaints concerning any of
their activities.

On September 14, 1972, WF T-8 furnished the August, 1972
copy of the "Furies" Newspaper.

A subsequent review of this issue, as well as all
previous issues, did not reflect any radical revolutionary
or anti-government theme. All issues have been devoted to
articles pertaining to lesbian/feminist interests.

On October 12, 1972, WF T-9 advised that an internal
conflict has developed within the "Furies" collective and they
are breaking up into different factions, based on ideological
differents.

Re WFO report of SA JERRY M. GRAVES, 12/13/72, and
WFO letter to Bureau, 1/31/73.

On 3/6/73, WEG@2%eS, advised that for all intents
and -purposes the "Furies" organization and collective have
ceased to function. There are no plans to publish another
newspaper, and most of the members have left to pursue their
own interests.

As reported in re WFO report, investigation of this
ease did not reflect any activities on the part of the "Furies"
that would be considered revolutionary or subversive.

The "Furies" newspaper ceased publication in August,
1972, and did not espouse a radical revolutionary line.

In view of the above, this case is being closed.
WFO will remain alert for information regarding any vossible
future activity on the part of the "Furies", and will repgry -
same at that time.
