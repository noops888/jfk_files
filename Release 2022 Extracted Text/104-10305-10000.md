MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

A SUBJECT: Telephone Conversation with Gordon Novel

Gordon Novel called the New Orleans office on 13-August 1981.
Ronald Farris was away on Annual Leave and had arranged to have his calls
forwarded automatically to the Houston Field Office's listed telephone
number. When the call was’ answered with: the Houston number, Novel indi-
cated that he was calling the New Orleans office. He was told that Farris
was out of the office for a week and his calls were being relayed to
Houston. Novel asked how he would go about obtaining his personal Agency
file under the Freedom of Information Act. He was told ‘that he should
address a letter to Freedom of Information Coordinator with his request.
He then indicated that he had done this already, and the information sent
to him was so severely edited and sanitized that it was difficult to make
sense of it. He did, however, discover. that it contained information that
was erroneous and he asked how to go about refuting: the misinformation
and/or correcting the file. It was-suggested that he write a letter eee
detailing the discrepancies and request that a change be made. He did
not seem interested in doing that and promptly changed his line of
questioning. He asked how he would go about contacting the Director of
the Agency directly. .He was told that he should use the local represent-
ative, Mr. Farris, to relay any information he might wish to get to the
Director. . Novel indicated that he had only talked to Farris once, but
was anxious to bypass the usual channels to avoid having his information
mishandled or misconstrued. He was told that Farris was a highly qualified
representative of the Agency and the proper individual to contact regarding
information he wished to get to the Director's attention. He gave a.small
sinister chuckle and replied, "We'll see about that," then hung up. *

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Security Analysis Group

FROM : Raymond M. Reardon
SUBJECT :...Pending Litigation - Gordon Novel
1. Gordon Novel is a somewhat notorious figure

who first came to the attention of this Agency during the
-, Garrision Investigation into the assassination of
President Kennedy. -From time to time he has claimed. to
be a CIA employee. or to be acting on behalf of the CIA.
He has never been employed by the Agency and has had no
contacts with the Agency except for occasional visits to
Domestic Collection Division offices. He has been in
several scrapes with the law, most recently in October
1976 when he was on trial for conspiracy to: firebomb
several buildings in New Orleans.. Mr. Novel has now Y
filed a civil.suit-claiming alleged violations of his
rights and interference with his personal affairs. He
is not suing..the Agency but he has named Mr. Howard
Osborn as a defendant. Mr. Osborn has been in touch with
the Office of.General Counsel seeking representation by _
the Justice Department since he feels his being named in
the suit probably resulted from his official duties with
the Agency. tite

ee 2. On. 27 April: 1977 Mr. George Jameson of the

. Office of General Counsel contacted the undersigned to
inquire whether we had a-file on Novel and if the file
showed any reason why Mr. Novel should have named
Mr. Osborn as a defendant in the suit: Mr. Jameson was
given a rundown on the nature of the information in
Novel's file and'was also provided with Mr. Osborn's
retirement date, #6—Februery1974. Mr. Jameson mentioned
that most of ee activities complained about by

Ite D4

E2 IMPDET
CL BY 007472


13-00000

Novel occurred in 1975 and there is no apparent reason
for Novel having singled out Mr. Osborn as a defendant.
Mr. Jameson also requested traces on two individuals
who are alleged to hgve been involved in this matter--
a y He was advised
ecofd. of either of

these individuals.

3. Mr. Jameson indicated that we would probably

be receiving a formal request for pertinent information vA
as this case develops, but he merely needed-a preliminary
reading in order to determine if Mr.-Osborn should be
defended by the Department of Justice in this litigation.
Aside from indexing the names of Blanscett and Pfiffer to |
Novel's file, no further action is contemplated by the

eee undersigned. : |

1. Reference is made te your 20 October 1976 priority
request (OGC 76-5787) which asks that the Office of Security
search its indices to determine if any of the above-naned
individuals have ever been employed by the Agency. Reference
is further made te our telephonic response to you on 20 October
1976: confirming that none of these individuals have ever. been
employed by the Agency.

Y

-" 2.. This memorandum will serve to confirm the referenced
telephonic response, Office of Security indices contain no
record in the uame of Lawrenee B, Rohde, which was also searched
in the variation of Lawrence B.Rhode, The Gffice of Security
dees naintain files on Gerdon Inwane Novel and Allen D.“Selt;“Ir<;"~
and a brief ‘sunmary of the infermation contsined within these
files appears below: ae

a. Gordon Dvane Novel, SP#S26 115

Mr. Novel has a long history of leaving the
impression that he is either employed by or asso-
ciated with the CIA. Nr. Novel has not, however,
ever bean. an employee of the Agency in any capacity.
The Office of Security file on Mr. Novel was
established in 1967 by virtue of his involvement.
with the Garrison investigation of the assassination
of President Kennedy,. During the ensuing period
Mrs Novel has ‘both telephoned and written to the

Agency with various proposals, none of which heave:
been followed-up by the Agency. Most recently,
Mr. Novel was=in contact with the Domestic Collec-
tion Division (DCD) in New Orleans, Lowisiana,

in October 1975 and February 1976 to volunteer
various proposals. . Mr. Novel's proposals were
rejected by DCD, and Mr. Novel was requested to
refrain from future contact with that office,

b. Allen D, Bell, Jr, SFE648 216

Nr. Bell is President of Dektor Counter-
Serer FOr and Security, Incorporated,
Springfield, Virginia, and has appeared widely
in the aews media as a “wiretapping expert,"
mast recently in connection with the Watergate
hearings. Mr. Bell has never been employed by
the Agency. The Office ef Security file on
Mr, Bell was established in 1970 based. on a
request from the Technical Security Division,
Directorate of Operations (TSB) for a Contact
Security Approval, Cited approval was granted
in November 1971, sithough Hr, Beil's file does
not reflect.the specific purpose for the request
nor if Mr. Bell was actually contacted. Mr, Bell
was. also of interest to DCD in October 1973;
however, the specific purpose of this interest
is hot contained within Mr," Bell's file.

3. As indicated, a review of our records failed ‘to ‘disclose

any indication that Mrs.Nevel, Mr, Rohde, or Mr. Bell have ever
been employed by the Agency in any capacity.

SUBJECT : Gordon Dwane Novel

1. Gordon Novel is scheduled for zrosecution in New Orleans
on 27 October on charges stemming from = conspiracy to firebomb some
buildings on Canal Street. He was ment=ned extensively in the James
Garrison investigation of the Kennnedy assination in 1967. Subse-
quently, Novel filed suit against Garriso= and later against Playboy
Magazine for an article they published which identified-Novel as a CIA
employee. In 1969 the Agency submitted = certificate signed by the then
Director of Personnel, Robert S. Wattles, which certified that Gordon Novel
had-never been employed by the CIA (cczy attached). It may be necessary
to submit a new certificate for the upcoming trial in New Orleans. You
are requested to search your files to dete>mine whether there is any
record of employment. - aa

2. There are two additional defense witnesses that we would
appreciate a search as to any employmerxt relationship:
a

(a) Lawrence B, Rohde . i i
530 "N" Street, S.W. i
Washington, D.C.
Employed by: Commonwealth Pug Corporation

oc

(b) Allan D. Bell, Jr. ,
President, DEKTOR C.i.S. Incorporated
5054 Blue Ridge Avente
Annandale, Virginia

OS 6 4555 j


- It is my understanding that these names have all been traced as a request
from the Domestic Collection Division with negative results. However, I
would appreciate a.written response to those traces by close of business
20-October so that certificates can be prepared.

3. Itis possible that a witness from the Office of Personnel may be
required to appear in New Orleans as a rebuttal witness to testify that
. there was no employment relationship with Gordon Dwane Novel, but this
is subject to negotiation with the prosecutor.

2. On 1 September 1976, Major Foster was contacted by

REFERENCES : Domestic Collections. Division Memoranda
: dated 25 February 1976 §& 1 March 1976

1. According to the referenced Domestic Collections

sidered proposals: .from Subject in October 1975 and on
9 February 1976 which were rejected. During the last contact,
the DCD representative requested Subject not contact him again.

2. DCD requested Office of .General Counsel (OGC) guidance
if they should be contacted by the press. concerning Subject's
arrest for conspiring to detonatesincendiary devices in a. down-
town New Orleans building. OGC recommended that they acknowledge
receiving a proposal from Novel which had been rejected. DCD uM
was also informed that Subject had never been employed by the ~~” =
Agency, with the understanding that this might also be made
known to any inquiring reporters or United States“ Attorney
DCD stated that they were pleased with this guidance,. since
itsallowed them to respond candidly to any immediate inquiries
and also servés to disassociate the sAgency from the difficulties
in which Subject now finds himself. It appears that the only
action taken in this.case is the OGC guidance supplied to DCD
and the only CIA interest in Subject is based on his contact
with the New Orleans DCD Office. S

3 : Scie

1. ‘The US Attorney. in New Orleans, Gerald Gallinghouse, called
Ffice..on:24-Eebruary..1976,.to.adviee.me.that
Gordon i. Novel had been arrested by agents of the US Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms Bureau (ATF) for. conspiring to detonate incendiary devices i
ina downtown New Orleans building oa Mardi Gras, 2 March 1976. Novel :
had apparently desertbed such a plot in a conversation he unwittingly”

held with ‘en undercover AT? ‘agent.

2..°1 confirmed to Gallinghouse that I had had a number of ‘contacts ve
with Novel since October 1975 concerning a proposal which Novel had offered

for CIA consideration. . I told Gallinghouse that the proposal had been ra-

jected by the Agency, but that I had again seen:Novel on 9 February 1976

to accept additional material in support of his proposal. At that time,

I alse asked Novel not to contact me again. L.assured Gallinghouse that

at no time had Novel been an Agency employee, nor had he ever had any

formal relationship with the Agency. Gallinghousa thanked me for ex-

plaining the nature of our relationship with Novel, and he suggested

that he might recontact ma later Lf necessary fox mors details.

3. In the referent telecon, I briefed the Deputy Chief of Operations,
Ed Watts, on the development and asked him how I should respond if Galling-
house sought access to the office file on Koval. Mr. Watts recommended that
I try to avoid giving the US Attorney. direct access:to the file, but that
if -Gallinghouse should ask to review the file, I-should refer the request
to Headquarters for resolution,

‘4. Mrs. Gordon Novel called shortly after my gouvereation with
Messra. Gallinghouse and Watts.. She said that her. husband had asked
her to call ma to insure that federal authorities were aware that her
husband had been .activaly discussing a proposal. for the Sgency with ma.
Hrs. Noval said that her husband had been denied ‘bond, and that he hoped sre
his’ contacts with a DCD officer might somehow convince federal authorities coe

he might be detained.through the Mardi Gras holiday as a precaution. She

assured we that Novel had made no effort to persuade the authorities. that
he isa ‘CIA officer or employee.

(b) NO-42-76 dated 25 February 6, Ssue Subject eat

lo Attached ara cosies of two local news items coacerning the ‘

recent arrest of Cordon Novel for the: illegal possession of an explo- i
“sive device end for conspiracy.to bomb several buildings in downtoun :
New Orleans. In the articie dated) 1 March and im recent television

MEWS coverage of the affair, Yovel has beea quoted as saying. that he

is involved in an importaat US Government. intelligence project end

is in frequent contact with on official of. the Defense iepertmeat.

As we reported in the referent meno, Novel told.the US: Alcohol, Tobacco i
* and Pirearme.Durean (ATP) agents who arrested him that he vas working
on a CIA project, a claim he said they conld ca by calling the
Now Orleans Resident Officer.

2. So far, there ‘have’ been no public. ststements linking Novel's i
* recent activities to tha Agency.” In. the referent telecons, however, we '
xoqueeted guidance in responding to any media inquiries which might
materialize. John Greaney, Offices of General Counsel, recenmended that ..
we acknowledge, if asked, that Hovel had offered the Agency a proposal Foot
which had subsequently been rejected, Hr. Greaney also cénfiemed that. | :
Uevel has never been employed by the Agency, a fact which we might alsa
make Imown to sny incuixing reporters or to the US Attorney; 4£ necessary.
We are pleased with this. guidance, since it allows us roe tespond candidly Hl
to any media inquizies, and it alse serves to disassociate the Agency i
from the difficulties in which Novel now finds nimself, j

3. We wilh keep you informed of any further dovelopmeats in this
matter which relate.to the Ageacy or to our coatacta with. Novel.

Novel claims D

Businessman’ Gordon Novel, ace

cused of plotting to firebomb downtown

buildings during Carnival, claims he is.
involved i in an ‘penormous project” with,
‘a gentleman in the Defense.

_Depariment.””

Asked if the. * enormous project” was

‘linked to his arrest, Novel said, “Well,

something i is behind this. I think I know
what it is but I veould rather not say.”
"Novel, identified as a financial.con-
sultant with the;Langford Land Co. here
whose name sutfaced nine years ago in
former Dist. Atty. Jim Garrison’s
Kennedy ‘assassination probes, made his .
comments during a weekend jailhouse
interview. é
Novel was arrested Feb. 21 and charged
with pessessing a destructive device. He
has. been held. Without bond since then,
pending a hearing Wednesday.
“Affidavits filed i in federal court allege .

‘that Novel tried to hire an undercover
federal agent t9 firebomb five buildings

“realizes the only way that ite can make a

said. Novel.said he was willing to take a

tioning under truth serum,

He said he has been “deeply involved” ‘
* in “counter-intelligence”: operations in.
’ the past, but did not elaborate: 5

“I know enough. about the intelligence
community to one day play a major po-
litical role i init,” Novel said. .

_-IN'1963, Garrison aéctised ‘Novel of
conspiring with a Cuban refugee to steal.

explosives from an oi] company storage:
site. Garrison's investigation linked Lee
Harvey Oswald, the President's accused

assassin, Wi ith a vaguely defined Cuban :

liberation movement.’

Novel sued Garrison for $50 million, *
claiming his reputation had.been. dam-

aged but the suit was'later dropped. |

1.. On 15 July 1975, an agent of the Cléveland FBI contacted the
Cleveland Resident Office concerning the attached correspondence. The

"The NBC broadcast of June 19, 1967” put on by Walter Sheridan “wilt probably stand for
years as a symbol of the lengths to which some powerful outside interests will go in order
: to interfere with state government.”

Walter Sheridan’ has recently beén hired by the
Democratic National Committee to head their investi~
gation of the Watergate bugging caper. In view of
the importance of this assignment, it would seem
worthwhile to examine Nr. Sheridan's performance in
puct investigations.

“Getting” Hoffa, and False Testimony

Walter Sheridan first came into national promi-
‘ence in 1961 when he spearheaded Robert Kennedy's
drive against: Jimmy Hoffa, during Robert's tenure
as Attorney General. -Sheridan pursued a relentless,
no mercy: shown, course of action to “get Hoffa", and
get him he did. In the course of this crusade, some
Yather dubious: techniques were used, which later

‘The Watergate Incident

‘On June 17 at 2:30-a.m., five men: were
" arrested in the offices of the Democratic
National Committee in the Watergate Hotel,
Washington, D.C. -They had broken into the
office, and were found with electronic. sur-
veillance devices, cameras for photographing
documents, ete; they. were wearing: surgical
rubber gloves. ‘They were arrested by police.

‘These five men were James W. McCord, Jr.,
Bernard L. Barker, Frank Sturgis, Eugenio R. .
| - Martinez, and Virgilio R. Gonzales.

Their connections reach to the Republican

dent, President Richard M. Nixoa, the Central
Intelligence Agency, ard other persons and
organizations.

ag in August 1972, “Computers and

resents to'democracy in the United States,
and. the importance of seeking the truth about

because of

ventire story.

came back to haunt dir. Sheridan. The® prime “example
was the "uncovering" of a key witness against Hoffa,
one Grady Partin of New Orleans and Baton Rouge,
Louisiana. Partin Was some years-later accused by
grand Jury of giving felse testimony against
Hoffa.

“Getting” Garrison
aL

fir. Sheridan's most notable performance came in”

+ 1967 and '68when he was an executive producer for

NBC-TV news. Sheridan produced a one-hour. NBC spe
cial on Jim Garrison's investigation of the assassi-
nation of President Kennedy and the trial of Clay
Shai for conspiracy to murder the-President.. The
program, broadcast on June 19, 1967, was a highly
biased, provably dishonest, personally vindictive,
attack on Garrison defending Shaw.-- The Shaw trial
did not take place until February,, 1969, a year and
a half later.

Arrest by Garrison ahd Indictment by Grand Jury

. Walter Sheridan was arrested’ by Garrison-on

July 7, 1967, following the NOC Special, and in-
dicted by a grand jury on two counts. The first
was. attempted bribery and intimidation-of a witness.
Rick Townley of station NOSU, the NBC affiliate in
New Orleans, was arrested and indicted with Sheridan
oa the same charges. The federal government, es-
pecially the Justice-Department, made sure. that Gar-
rison was never able to bring Sheridan and Townley
to trial. The indictments are still open.

If the Sheridan trial ever does take place, the
conviction should not be too difficult. Here are
the facts, as reported by both New Orleans newspa~
pers, the Times Picayune and the States Item, in
1967 and summarized in “The-Kennedy Conspiracy” by
Paris Flammonde, Meredith Press, 1969.

Sheridan and Townley, having been assigned by
NBC to cover the Gorrison-Shaw case, became person-
ally and directly involved. The indictments for
bribery, suppressing and altering evidence, and in-
terfering with the trial, did not begin to tell the
NBC top management, Frank McGee, the
narrator of the special, and others at NBC, fully

ie



ae

eridan, untill ic of thé Lies, bribes
the pragram.were revealed.

Apology by N&C for Lies Told by Two “Witnesses”

k McGee later had to-opologize ‘on NBC. for

es. told by two of Sheridan's “witnesses” on’ the
vspecial, Sheridan and Yownlcy paid them to give
Statements against Garrison. ‘The FCC ruled that
NIC had to give Garrison equal time.ofter Garrison
nade au appeal, because the special had not been a
weNs program, -but an AUC-Sheridan vendctts against.
Garrison. NBC did give Garrison 30 minutes (the”
special was one hour) to respond ets later date in
51967.

To ixiustrate Sheridan's and NUC's ‘techniques in
the case, at one point the President of NBC helped
in the. bribery efforts by ng ir. Gherlock, head
Equitable Life Insurance Co. in New York. . Gher-
was asked. for assurance: that Perry Russo, who

worked for Equitable in Louisiana, would cooperate
with NIC on the Garrison special. Russo was the
“key witness in the Shaw triel’ whom Sheridan and
Townley tried to bribe.

To remind the reader about tho Shaw trial, Jim
Garrison opened an investigation into the assassina-
tion of President Kennedy in late 1966.- Senator

:Long of Louisiana hod convinced Garrison that a
2conspiracy had existed. Lee Harvey Oswald's ac-"

. wtivities in New Orleans prior to the assassination,
-along with the strange actions of David Ferrie, on
‘the day of the assassination, attracted Garrison's
attention. He had not made his investigation public, .

‘abut a curious newspaper reporter named Rosemary
James broke’ the story after a few months of effort..
Clay Shaw's other. identity, Clay Bertrand, had al=
“ready been uncovered by Garrison, and his involve-
ment in the planning for the assassination had sl-
ready been suspected by early 1967. :

\Party in David Ferrie's Apartment

Perry Russo attended 9 party in David Ferrie's
apartment where Clay Bertrand, Ferrie, someone re-
sembling Lee Harvey Oswald and others- had. discussed
the possibility of assassinating President Kennedy.
He became the key witness when Garrison arrested
Shaw on March 1, 1967, and.a grand jury indicted
‘Shaw on March 22 following two hearings on March 14
and Norch 17 by a three judge panel and a four judge
panel, recommending that Shaw beheld for trial.

"Effort to. Have Russo Change His Testimony

Shetidan and Townley both made up their minds,
along with most of the news media and the Justice
Ocpartment, that Garrison had. to be stopped at all
costs, They decided to reslly go to work'on Perry
Russo, since his testimony was all important.

Townley tried to get Russo to change his testi-
mony at the Shaw triai to make it scem that Garrison
“had hypnotized ‘him and had then asked him leading
questions to get Russo-to testify against Siaw.
Townley and Sheridan went to Russo's house, his of-
fice, and met him at other places. They badgered
hie and attempted to bribe him. They pressured and
threatened him, They used every trick in-the book
to try to get him to, change his testimony.

They threatencd him with being discredited, made
to scem insane, and perhaps fired from his job. They
offered him a chance to work closely, for high re-
wards, with NOC in Sheridan's all-out effort to get
Garrison, Sheridan‘ told Russo, “We're going to de-

re .
stroy me on and his’ case along with him." Townley
told. Russ0: that. he could gév Shaw's laxycr, Dymond,
to go casy on him at the trial, if¢he would alter
his testimony.
promised NBC that no-retalistion would be ‘taken
ayainst Russa if’ he cooperated, with NBC.. However,
he might be fired if he-didn‘t cooperate.

Sheridan told Russo that ABC could set him up in.
Calizornia where Russo always wanted to live, if he
helped bust up the Garrison probe. Sheridan’ said
NOC would pay. his expenses to California and’to liv
there, would protect his job, would get Russo a
lawyer, and would guarantee that Garrison would
never extradite him back to Louisiana.

Gordon Novel, Worker'for the CIA

Another important witness in the Shaw trial was
Gordon Novel, a” bugging and electronics expert who
worked for the CIA.
but he. left New Orleans and fled to Ohio. Garrison
was never able to extradite Novel from Ohio to Loui.
siana in spite of: Novel’s public statements that he
knew who had killed David Ferrie. (Ferrie died mys.

teriously shortly after Garrison's probe became pub-
'

lic knowledge. )

Walter Sheridan told Perry Russo that NBC had
helped Novel ‘escape Garrison's clutches by flying
him out of Louisiana.to McLean, Virginia “(home of
the CIA). NDC paid for a lie detector test to be
administered to Novel in McLean.. The test was sup-

he. said he knew nothing about the Kenacdy case.

Sheridan told Russo that NBC‘ would do the same thing

for him that they had done for-Novel, nomely, make
sure that Novel would never be extradited to Louisi
ana. to testify. - Since Novel never was extradited
d_since Governor Rhodes of Ohio blocked: his extra
dition making Governor sicKeithon of Louisiana ex-
tremely angry, it would seem that Sheridan-was righ
NBC did possess a lot of clout.

Sheridan and Townley also went to work on Gordon
Novel's former wife, Marlene Mancuso. She was
another important Shaw trial. witness. .because..of he
knowledge about-Novel's CIA activities and a bur=
Glory ‘of a munitions dump in Houma, Louisiana.
Townley called her ond tried to convince her to
grant a taped interview for use on the NOC show.
He’ said Garrison was-going to. be destroyed and that.
she should cooperate with NBC.” --

the principal examples: :

1. A lawyer named Dean Andveiis in New Orleans’ hid
played a key role in the Shaw trial because Clay:

Bertrand had telephoned him in a hospital. shortly
after the assassination and asked him to represent
Lee Harvey Oswald. Andrews told so many different

stories about Clay Bertrand that the truth was dif-"|

ficult to determine.

Frank McGee asked Andrews on the program about
Clay Bertrand and whether he was Clay Shaw.
said Bertrand was actually Eugene C. Davis, a bar
owner in New Orleans. Sheridan's coup quickly blew
up in his face when Davis denied the whole thing.
When the trial finally took place, Shaw was pegged
as Bertrand by a woman who saw him sign his name as
Clay Bertrand.

‘Sheridan Could Not Get Russo to “Cooperate”

3. Sheridan himself appeared on screen to discuss
Perry Russo. He could never get Russo to change
his aind and cooperate, so Sheridan interpreted for
the. audience what Russo had told him. . He stated
that Russo told him that his téstimony against Shaw
may he a combination of: truth, fantasy and lies.

Andrew Sc «Garrison's assistant district
attorney who interviewed Russo, delivered a memo to
Garrison, detailing Walter Sheridan's efforts to
eaten Russo. The statements made by
Russo to ra wete very incriminating about
Sheridan. The net result of all Sheridan's efforts
were that Russo stuck to his story at the trial.

Fred Locmans, “Witness”

4. Sheridan's last “witness” on the show was Fred
Leenans, another bar owner (Sheridan seemed to
specialize in bar ovners) and former Turkish bath
operator. Lecmans said that his original statements
given to Garrison sbout Clay Shaw were not true and
that his psyche began to trouble him. The morality

Bribing and Attempting to Bribe Witnesses

In addition to bribing and attempting to bribe |
witnesses, Sheridan also had meetings with one of
Garrison's part-time investigators, William Gur=
vich. Garrison found-out about the meetings. and’,
did not give Gurvich all of the information he
wanted. 2

Jim Garrison said about Sheridan and the NBC
broadcast, "Aside from the fact that it insulted
the intelligence of every American, “it was a very

Conputers and Automation, established 1951 and
therefore the oldest magazine in the field of con-
puters and data-processing, believes ‘that the pro-

competence in handling information using computers
and other means, but alsé a broad responsibility,
in a professional and.engineering sense, for:

— The reliability and social significance
of pertinent input, data;

— The social value and truth of the
output results.

In the: same way, a- bridge engineer takes a pro-
fessional: responsibility for the reliability and
significance of the data he uses, and the safety
and efficiency of the bridge he builds, for human
beings to risk their lives on.

from time to time articles and other information
related to socially. useful input and output of data
systems in a broad sense. To this end we seek to
publish what is unsettling, disturbing, critical
— but productive of thought and an improved and
safer “house” for all humanity, an earth in which
our children and later generations may have a fu-
ture, instead of facing extinction.

The professional information engineer needs to
relate iis engineering to the most important and
most serious problems in the world today: war,
nuclear weapons, pollution, the population explo—
sion, and many more.

SUBJECT: . NQVEL, Gordon
(See also FURR, Lloyd B.)
(See also ARCACHA-SMITH, Sergio)

ALLEGATION: CIA CONNECTION:
Gordon NOVEL, former None

owner of a French Quarter Bar
in New Orleans, was subpoenaed
- ‘by. GARRISON as a material
witness in March 1967 but
NOVEL moved to Columbus, Ohio
and has avoided extradition.
GARRISON charged NOVEL

with burglary of the Houma 1c f
Munitions Bunker in 1961 CIA HISTORIC’
together with David FERRIE RELEASE

and ARORCHA-SMITH. . NOVEL
claimed this was a CIA
_ operation but later his
attorney. denied the story.

SOURCE:

Numerous news items, the
latest dtd in October 1967.

OS INDICES RESULTS:

Subject's file contains newspaper clippings dating from March

1967 when GARRISON charged him with conspiracy in connection with

a burglary of a mmitions bunkdée at Houma, Louisiana in 1961 together

with David FERRIE and ARCACHA-SMITH. To avoid arrest, NOVEL left

New Orleans, first going. to McLean, Virginia where he was given a

lie detector test by Lloyd B. FURR, a private detective. (See summary
- on FURR). This incident tended to give credence to NOVEL's initial

claim that he was working for CIA because of the Egency's promimity to

McLean, Va.

After NOVEL vacated his New Orleans apartment in March 1967
a@ letter written by him was found under the linoleum on a sink
drainboard by the new tenant, a girl who turned it over to her boy
friend, who gave it to a professor at a New Orleans university who in
turn gave it to a reporter on the New Orleans STATES-ITEM, Hoke MAY.

GRour 1
sxctded from satozate
dgungrading and
‘dectassificalion



Hoke MAY was granted a Covert Security Approval in April 1958

for unwitting use by Project FJINDULGE. MAY was not to be directly
employed by FJINDULGE but was to be used in connection with his
position with a private firm which handled work for the Project.

The letter was presumably written to a "Mr.: WEISS" in CIA and referred
to classified DOUBLE-CHEK activities in 1961 in which NOVEL claimed

he was involved. This matter was reviewed by:CI/R&A at the time the
matter received publicity and it was determined that DOUBLE-CHEK

.was created by the Agency for the sole purpose of making payments to
the widows of American flyers who participatedin the Bay of Pigs.

No connection with NOVEL could be established. NOVEL knew Sergio
ARCACHA-SMITH who was New Orleans head of the Frente Revolucionario _
Democratico, an Agency created and supported anti-Castro organization.
Although ARCACHA-SMITH had no Agency clearance, NOVEL could have gained
an impression from him that he was employed by: CIA.

In October 1967 NOVEL was granted immunity from amest by GARRISON
on the Houma Bunker burglary charge and ‘returned. to Louisiana to
testify before the East Baton Rouge Parish Grand Jury in their probe
on crime and labor troubles in the State of Louisiana. :

DETAILS:

The Agency had no connection with the Houma Munitions Bunker.
However, an Agency training site was located at Belle Chasse, Louisiana
and Colonel Thomas BURBANK, State of Louisiana Police Superintendent, was
one of the Louisiana officials witting of Agency affiliation with
Belle Chasse. It is noted from news items concerning NOVEL's testimony
before the Louisiana Labor probers in October 1967,. that Colonel BURBANK
was also a witness at the same time, although, there is no mention that
BURBANK and NOVEL knew each other. BURBANK testified that every Louisiana
sheriff was notified to "clean up" gambling and other vice in Louisiana.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Gordon Novel
#526113

1, On 20 May 1969,.the Director of Security advised that
he had received a call from Mr. Bienvenu,. Director of Security,-
National Security Agency, regarding a possible impersonation
by Subject.. According to Mr. Biche an ex-Federal Bureau of
Investigation agent, Mr. g
Avenue, Alliance, Ohio, 44601,
advised that a contact of his had fta hat Subject had shown a
CIA credential and indicated that he was employed by the Agency.
Mr, Aufrance advised he called the National Security Agency to
bring this matter to the attention of the highest security officials
in Washington and that if anyone wished to cmtact him they should
call him before 5:00 p,m., this date.

2. After reviewing Subject's file and confirming that Mr.
Aufrance was an ex-Federal Bureau of Investigation agent, I briefed
the Director of Security who requested that I call Mr. Aufrance and
advise him that we were knowledgeable of Subject and that on other
occasions he had inferred he was'employed by CIA. In addition, that
we intended to turn'this information over to the Federal Bureau of
Investigation for investigation since the FBI had jurisdiction on such
impersonation cases.

3, Ilater briefed Mr.. Fred J. Cassidy, FBI/Liaison, who
suggested that advise Mr. Aufrance to report the information to
local FBl agents. In Mr. Cassidy's presence, I called Mr. Aufrance
who repeated what he had told Mr. Mathison, He also stated that
Subject's wife is now separated from him and is suing him for divorce
in Columbus, Ohio, She has stated that Subject is armed, carries a



tear gas weapon and some kind of a .22 caliber pistol, concealed as a
fountain pen, She stated that Subject is leaving Columbus for Reno,
Nevada, where he intends to open a gambling establishment, In further
discussion with Mr, Aufrance, he indicated his source was a friend of
Subject's wife and from. other statements he made,. it is believed that his
source is Thomas F, Hughes, Jr. who was interviewed by the Chicago
Field Office on 18 April 1969.

4, After further discussion ‘with Mr, Aufrance during which he
indicated he was:leaving for a fishing-trip in Canada and would not
return until Sunday, 25 May 1969, it was agreed that he would contact
the local Federal Bureau of Investigation and brief them regarding
Subject and that I would, meanwhile, alert. FBI Headquarters/Washington,
which could follow-up with the local office,

5. Ithen provided Mr. Cassidy with all pertinent information
regarding Mr, Atfrance's telephone call and all information on Subject,
Mr. Cassidy will keep us advised,

the. telephone calls were either made by, or instigated by. *
one Gordon ‘NEVIL, NEVILLE or NOVEL (HUGHES professed only

as a good friend. .Last summer, Mr. HUGHES arranged for Z

Bubject in identified as e California investigator who administered
@ polygraph test to Rager Eugene BRADLEY who has been charged with conspiracy.
~ by GARRISON.

Eubject vas born 12 August 1921 at Omaha, Nebraska. He is 5 former
Agency émployee who EOD in October 1949 as a GS-9 Intelligence Officer.
Bubject resigned his steff_ status in February 1951 and became o staff
agent with Project{E in Turkey from March 1951 until: July 1952.
(His wife Anne Claudia GUGAS nee SETARO wes granted a covert security clearance
in February 1952’ for use in a clerical pee in the Middle East.)

In his assignment with srogect (apavanr] in Turkey, Subject was a
source of conatent emberrasement-in hie contecte with Turkish (police)
officials. He was boastful, indiscreet, lacking in sound judgment, knew
little or nothing in the fields in which he wes eelf-professedly an expert
end vee guilty of security breaches in failing te maintein his cover.

In ome incident he made recommendations of police soorganizations. to de

made by province governors in Turkey} whereas, in Turkey, the olice) g
Department is. a national organization end net subject to the dictates of
the, province governors. This caused mich 111 will. and friction with the

Turkish’ police. FS a wee Hien
Subject professed to be an expert in his knowledge of the. polygraph _ i
machine snd.claimed he had two years' experience with the Los Angeles
Police Department prior to his employment with the Agency. However, it
was developed thet instead of this claimed experience, he had eactuelly
spent one or two weeks in a detective school connected with the Los Angeles
Police Department where he received dDelow average grades.

In October 1952 he approached an Agency employee regarding « nev.
typeof: technical equipment and this conversation led to the disclosure
by Subject that he was employed by the Agency in a covert capacity; that
he was teaching lie detection techniques to foreign police depertmnts
without being authorized or competent to do so. Subject was briefed in
December 1952 with stress placed on the importance of living up to his
security responsibilities and exercising utmost precaution in protecting
the covert interests of the Agency. /

In spite of the strang warnings given him in this interview, sabe
again becawe involved in an incident of official embarrassment to the Agency.

. 2 OO. SECRET mee

In March 1953 he misrepresented himself as a polygreph operetor with the

. “State Department Secret Police”. This misrepresantation wes made at @
time when the Department of Stéete was not suthorised to have a polygraph
machine and Congressional legislation was pending at the time regerding
such authorization. Ase result of this misrepresentation, Subject was
afforded. enother security interview in March 1953. He explained thet
his cover company sold equipment to foreign countries through. the Mutual
Aid Program and supplied consultent services to the State Department but
Subject denied that he ever represented himself os a State Department
polygraph operator. After the security interview Bubject wee also.essessed
by on Agency psychologist: (March 1953) and:was found to be egotistical,
emotionally unstable, possessed of a need to build himself up in the
eyes of others ond gave either exaggerated or completely erroneous

. information as to his past positions. His intelligence quotient was found
to be comparatively low in relation to those of other Agency employees.
Tn April. 1953 termination of his employment was recommended.

Subject renigned 29 April 1953 "te accept a position in California.
Washington clinate is not agreeable to his family.”

To April 1964 Mr. J. Kirk BAREVYOO?, Director of Security, McKesson
and Robbins, Skokie, Illinois, informed the Agency he hed been a witnesa
to unauthorized disclosures of classified information made by a group in
@ cocktail le in Omaha, Nebraske. The individual making the disclosures
about (ERDOMORPH vitiee abroad under Agency sponsorship wae identified
as Leonard HARRELSON. Subject, who was then Director of Public Safety
for, the City of Omaha, Nebraska, was one of the group and it was believed
that he was responsible for supplying the classified information to HARRELSOW
cout [ENDONORPH activities.

—

Leonard HARRELSON is a privete investigator specializing | in hypnotien
end the use of the polygraph machine. In.196k he wes employed by the
Polygraph Company in Chicago, Illinofs. In 1954 HARRELSON was in partnership
with Lloyd B. FURR in a private detective agency known es the American
Bureau of Investigation, Tower Building, Washington, D. C. Lloyd B. FURR
ie the polygraph operator who gave a lie detector test to Gordon NOVEL,
hostile witness subpoenaed by GARRISON. The test received newspaper publicity
88 being given at "McLean, Va." in March 1967. (Summery on FURR attached).

HARRELSON is believed to be a person of poor morals. He was given
@ medical discharge from the Army as @ psychoneurotic in 1949 and had been
court-martieled twice for impersonating non-commissioned officers of a
rank higher then-h@ possessed. In his business partnership with FURR,
HARRELSON would misrepresent himself ae being with the FBI by covering the
word “American” when presenting hie credentials and dust smoneing “Bureau
of Investigation".

Incidentelly, the informait, J. Kirk BAREFOOT mentioned above, was

disapproved for Agency employment in 1951 because of falsification of his PHS,
“end questionable maturity, judgment, discretion and honesty.

OSWALD Case
MAY, Hoke Smith, # 167314

1. Note.in the attached New Orleans States-Item articles that it

‘reportedly was to Hoke MAY, a reporter of that newspaper, that az im-

criminating letter which Gordon NOVEL allegedly wrote to a Mr. WEISS,
who was "presumably connected with CIA," was delivered.

2. According to the States-Item articles of 26 May 1967, the letter, Lf...
which appeared to be a draft, ‘had been found under a rug in an apartment (“
occupied by NOVEL prior to his departure from New Orleans in about

mid-March 1957, and had been turned over to the boyfriend of one ef two

girls who found it while cleaning the apartment. The boyfriend had turned

it over to his professor at a New Orleans university who is a friend of

Reporter Hoke MAY, and he delivered it to MAY. (NOVEL's attorney has

stated that NOVEL worked for CIA in New Orleans in 1961). —

3...Hoke MAY, without question, is Subject who in April 1958 was ~~.
granted a Covert Security Approval for unwitting use by Project FJEIBULGE:——
MAY was not to be directly employed by FJINDULGE bat. was to be ased in
connection with his position with a private firm which handled work for the
Project.

4. Investigation of Subject by this Agency in February/March 1958
reflected nothing of a derogatory nature. It Hid indicate, however, tiat he
has in the past had an interest in politics and in 1952 was employed as
political campaign manager in the unsuccessful race of a candidate for Congress
from Georgia. Subject's grandfather was a Governor of Georgia and later a
Senator from that State. Subject has been employed by various newspapers,
including the New York Times {October 1948-March 1949). There is no in-
formation in Subject's file subsequent to his Covert Security Approval dated
April 1958.
