Subject: Background on Mexico Station Support Assets
(Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Enbassies)

1. (Unilatéral| coverage. From the tine the Mexico Station vas opened in
(ee 1947 \(by Bill Doyle) until arrival of Win Scott as COS in 1958, Charles
Anderson III (still in LA/HQ) had developed a support apparatus to Aaa
exploit leads from the Soviet Embassy, This umbrella type project (LIFEAT)

consisted of multi line phone taps, three photo =o surveillance

team and a mail intercept operation.

the Station got word thet the photo of "uniden man" was bei

pudlic by the Warren Commission. The photo operators were moved to another apt
nearby. The property vas sold (under an operational agreenent with LIMOUSINE

for a long term lease on the top floor of a new apartment blding to be built

LILYRIC was a rented ap a LICALLA, the third photo site, vas located

in one of a row of four houses on the South side of the Soviet Embassy compound
which the Mextco Station purchased in about 1958 (check date), also using
LIMOUSINE as the purchaser (check). This site overlooked the back garden of

the Soviet Enbassy compound. The purpose of this operation wes to get good
identification photographs of the Soviet personnel (who at thet time vere largely
unidentified in Mexico Station records), The three photo sites vere handled by

dozen or so agents who used three to four late model cars end a

evacuated across the border at Nogales by Bob Shaw) and the inside——

up into several others. The agents were not changed but vere given

3. Yy nenory is a little vague about the origins of the Cuban Exbassy but I
think the staff first developed frou a pro-Castro group celebrating on New
Years eve 1959. As I recall, it was a xakeshift arrangement of volunteers
through most of 1960 and €1 with Tom Hazlitt producing voluminous reports on
their activities end recruitirg agents right and left exong Cuban netionals in
Mexico City.

4. Personnel assignments. Of interest to us now is who was in Mexico during
the period prior to Oswald's visit and the subsequent investigation by the
Warren Comission. To determine who ves there and what they were doing I
have groped persons tozether chronotogically with areas of their assignment

monitor who made short sumzaries of interesting conversations for a daily
resume which was received each day arourd 8 a.m. (passed’ by Flick to Goodrasture
to get to Scott before 9.a.m.) Later (when the reel was coapletely recorded)

full transcripts were typed and passed to the stetion in Ry wey, however,
there was usually e time lag of a day or so. * Tho: S which hdd
Russien or another lenguege besides Spani aN went out of the listening
post the day after the transcript gare on the reel)vas

typed. These reels were er location where they were translated
and typed. In the case }e Russien translations, Boris Tarasoff usually ran

about a week behind the date of the conversation because of the volume of

_.Russian conversations among the wembers of the Soviet Ebessy. During this

period (fall of 1963) the reels were probably being brought into the station
and carried to Boris by one of the people from the Soviet Section or they nay
have been carried to him by Flick but I think I brought the reel in and gave

it to;Herbert Mar

the photographs as soon as we learned thet the man calling himself Oswald was
probably an Anericen. However, here again there was a backlag because the

photos were picked up three times a week but the ones picked up were usually
for dates a few days prefiously because (the doctor) processed the film on a

night time basis. Photogrephs were made usually until one roll vas used but
later we got it changed to one day coverage on each roll - in other words the

‘urnan
error did occur.but generally the egents vere conscientious. The Cuban
embassy coverege had more sophisticated equipsent (a pulse ca:era) but it
frequently develoged mechanical difficulties, Bob Zambarnerdi and (Gpathar )
(I think) handled this film - pick.up end delivery. Lorna !ecKay screened
the film inside the station.

Soviet line. It-wes picked up and taken to Boris fi ge because
