"The Citizens Committee to Preserve American Freedoms
* * * specializes in propaganda aimed at abolishing the Committee

organization is run by Frank Wilkinson, an identified Communist
who recently resumed the full-time, paid post of executive
secretary after approximately a year's leave of absence to assist
in a similar campaign by another front in New York City, the
Emergency Civil Liberties Committee.

"When the Committee on Un-American Activities held
hearings in Los Angeles September 2-5, 1958, to inquire into
the nature of the party's recent reorganization in California,
the Citizens Committee to Preserve American Freedoms sponsored
a series of public meetings to protest the hearings and the
very existence of the committee. Communists subpenaed as wit-

"At this time, leaders of the party's Southern
California District were mobilizing Communists in the area for
participation in an intensified campaign to abolish this
committee of Congress. How the Citizens Committee to Preserve
American Freedoms served the party in this effort was revealed
Hl by (Communist Party) District Chairman Dorothy Healey in a
report to the party's Southern California District Council on
September 21, 1958. Mrs. Healey declared that the party preferre
public protest meetings to be held by the Citizens Committee to
Preserve American Freedoms rather than under party auspices tease
Communists could attend without danger of being exposed as
members of the party. She also noted that Communists scheduled
as congressional committee witnesses could not appear beforehand
at openly Communist rallies without creating the impression
that the party was conspiring with witnesses to withhold informa-
tion from the committee."

A source advised on December 12, 1962, that in the
latter part of 1962 a group of former members of the San
Francisco County Communist Party (SFCCP), who had split from
the SFCCP during 1960 over a factionalist dispute, had grouped
together to support and further the aims of "Progressive . Labor"
and reportedly had allied themselves with the Progressive Labor
Party, which reportedly has been organized nationally.

The masthead in the September, 1963, issue of "Progressive

Labor," Volume II, No. 9, reflects "Progressive Labor" is
published monthly by the Progressive Labor Co., G.P.0. Box 808,

In

A source advised on July 2, 1962, that Progressive Labor
groups held a conference in New York City on July 1, 1962, where
MILTON ROSEN acted as chairman. He read a statement at this con-
ference setting forth their intention to form a new Marxist-
Leninist Party in the United States. ROSEN steted that a more
formal organization was necessary, one which would provide a
framework for all who wanted to join in a united effort to build
an American vansuard. The functions of this new organization
are to consolidate all existinse forces around Progressive Labor
and organize additional forces; expand and improve political
activities; win additional forces to an outlook of Marxism-
Leninism and increase the open advocacy of socialism; develop a
significant Marxist-Leninist program for the new party; and
organize a collective organization of leaders and members.

"The worker,” an east coast communist
newspaper, issue of January 7, 1962,

page 10, column 3, reported the expulsion
of HILTON POSEN, former labor secretary
of the New York State Communist Party,
from the Communist Party, USA.

A second and third source advised in February, 1963,
that this new Marxist-Leninist Party had not yet been organized on
a formal basis but that Progressive Labor groups had been formed
in several localities in line with proposals of MILTON ROSEN. The
sources advised as of February, 1963, that the leaders of this
group were referring to it as the Progressive Labor Movement.

The "Amsterdam News," a deily New York City newspaper,
dated July 27, 1963, vage 22, set forth that the "Progressive
Laber Party is a new political formation based on Progressive
Labor Movement, a Socialist organization with groups in all parts
of the United States. The organization publishes a monthly
Magazine called Progressive Labor."

The July-August, 1963, issue of "Progressive Labor" set
forth that it is published ronthly by Progressive Labor Company,
G.P.0. Box 808, Brooklyn 1, New York.

CITIZENS COMMITTEE TO PRESERVE AMERICAN FREEDOMS
————_——SS EUR EDOM

The Guide to Subversive Organizations and Publications,
revised and published December 1, 1961, prepared and released
by the Committee on Un-American Activities, United States
House of Representatives, contains the following on Page 43
concerning "Citizens Committee to Preserve American Freedoms":

1. "The (Communist) party's front operations in the
Southern California District today are * * * confined to feur
majer organizations," which include the Citizens Committee to
Preserve American Freedoms.

"The Citizens Committee to Preserve American Freedoms
* * * specializes in propaganda aimed at abolishing the Committee
on Un-American Activities and discrediting the Federal Bureau of
Investigation. Created in Los Angeles in 1952, the front
organization is run by Frank Wilkinson, an identified Communist
who recently resumed the full-time, paid post of executive
secretary after approximately a year's leave of absence to assist
in a similar campaign by another front in New Yerk City, the
Emergency Civil Liberties Committee.

"When the Committee on Un-American Activities held
hearings in Los Angeles September 2-5, 1958, to inquire into the
nature of the party's recent reorganization in California,
the Citizens Committee te Preserve American Freedems sponsored
a serles of public meetings to protest the hearings and the very
existence of the committee. Communists subpoenaed as witnesses
were guests of honor,

"At this time, leaders of the party's Southern California
District were mobilizing Communists in the area for participation
in an intensified campaign to abolish this committee of Congress.
How the Citizens Committee te Preserve American Freedoms served the
party in this effort was revealed by(Communist Party) District
Chairman Dorothy Healey in a report to the party's Seuthern Californi:
District Council en September 21, 1958. Mrs. HEALEY declared that th:
party preferred public protest meetings to be held by the Citizens
Committee to Preserve American Freedoms rather than under party
auspices because Communists could attend without danger of being
exposed as members of the party. She also noted that Communists
scheduled as congressional committee witnesses could not appear
beforehand at openly Communist rallies without creating the im-
pression that the party was conspiring with witnesses to withhold
information frem the committee."

to hold public meetings.

STEVE MURDOCK, editor of the "PW" reviewed the
activities of the “PW" for the past year and pointed out
that the "Pu" offered its readers news from the view-
point of the working class and Negro people and really had -
something to offer and this had enabled it to survive.

ROSCOE PROCTOR also spoke on the problems of
the Negro people in the capitalistic society and noted
that only socia&liem offered the Negro any chance of solving
his problems, PROCTOR said that the President's “War
Against Poverty” was simply a political scheme to attract
votes.

The featured speaker was ROBERT THOMPSON, a meni~
ber of the CP Committee, who discussed the split between
the Soviet Union and China and said that it would soon be
healed over, THOMPSON told the audience that they should
support the Democratic Administration while at the samc
time put pressure on the Democratic Party to end defacto
segregation in schools throughout the country. THOMPSON

ted in order to survive.

WINSTON identified himself as a communist and
told of his tmprigonment by the Federal Government. He
said that because the government would not treat him for
his illness, he became blind. He said the reason for the

Negro and a conmmumist.

LANE discussed the background of the assassi-
nation of President KENNEDY and stressed the fact that
Dallas was @ very reactionary city and for that reason
it is easy to understand why Dallas had been selected as
the place for the President to be assassinated. LANE
diseussed briefly the background of LEE HARVEY OSWALD
and noted that he was a Grifter without any ties who had
spent some time in the Soviet Union. LANE tried to es~
tablish a link between OSWALD and the FBI and indicated
that OSWALD was the victim of a frameup. He said he had
a reputation of being an unstable character and a past
association with left-wing groups. LANE said that in
spite of this he did not believe that OSWALD was the
actual assassin of the President,

such areas ac Cuba, Vietnam, the Soviet Union and Chine.
He said that all of these countries are socfalist camps
of one form or another and ali are working for peace,

AL RICHHOND, the editer of the "PW", took the
position that peaceful co-existence was a possi le way
to make some progress for peace without changing the
economy of the country.

One of the other panel members spoke in support
of peace but not in favor of any kind of violence,
pointed out that the left wingers comprising the CP, the
Trotskyite Party, and the Progressive Labor Party looked
toward revolution as an alternative for peace; however,
he did not think that peace vould ever be won by revolu-
tion, a

On Oeteber 16, 1964, the Subject attended a
panel discussion sponeored by the DuBois Club held at
625 Polk Street, San Prancises, The three panel members
were DOROTHY HEALEY, Chairman of the Southern Califomia
CP, VINCENT HALLINAN, a San Francisco attorney, and JOHN
BURTON, a California State Assemblyman.

The Subject of the Giseussion was on the forth-
coming election and what part progressive forces should
‘lay in tha election.

VINCENT HALLINAN took a strong pro-Democratic

Party attitude and pointed out that he, himself, had cam~
paigned on a national ticket for a minority party and the
result had been disastrous. He said they had wasted their
time and money and energy and polled so few votes that he
did not wededve even one electoral vote. He stressed the
fact that the Republican forces represented a step toward
fascism and that at all costs, #11 decent people and ail
good left-wing people must vote the Democratic slate.

DOROTHY HEALEY generally agreed with HALLINAN
but pointed out the Communist Party's specific obligation
to the working class to provide good leadership. She
said the CP had only one chance of acting as a vanguard
of the working class and that was to be right in its sup-
port of political candidates. HEALEY also said the people
should support the Supreme Court and particularly the Court's
recent decision to reapportion state legislature.

JOHN BURTON said this was the first election in
which he felt free to accept support from the left openly
and he attributed this to a determination on the part of
the general public to defeat BARRY GOLDWATER. He praiced
the Bubois Club for supporting him and he thanked the per-
sons on the left ineluding the Socialist Workers Party,
the CP and others for their support.

VINCENT HALLINAN was candidate for President
of the United States on the Independent
Progressive Party (IPP) ticket in 1952. Tho
IPP was formed in California in 1948 and
ceased to exist in 1954 when it failed to

Spired when he vieits these countries and hears of their
achievements to bring about peace and he is always dis~
appointed on returning to the United States to find the
war mongers holding the upper hand and keeping the people
obsessed with the idea that they have to stay prepared
for war against the communists, ROBERTS said the United
States was constantly on the side of the landlords and
money lenders of small countries throughout the world
such as South Vietnam. He said these people only aspire
justice for themselves and an opportunity to live in
peace and comfort. However, they are ground down ruth-
lessly by native oppressors with the help of American
troops an@ American support.

CARL BLOICE, a reporter for the "PW", also
told of a recent trip he made to Eastern Europe. He
said he found the East Germans consecrated to the task
of being a socialist nation and cooperating fully with
the Soviet Union. ELOICE said that East Germans now
claim that America has succeeded to the position once
held by fascist. Germany of being the most reactionary
and most militant country on earth, BLOICE said that
communist nations now were in a position to defeat any
non-communist countries in the event of military attack
but he said this was the poorest way he could think of
to bring about communism and he would prefer to see non-
communist nations become communist through the means of

W.E.B. DU BOIS CLUB OF SAN FRANCISCO,
aka DuBois Youth Group, San Francisco
DuBois Club, San Francisco DuBois

Youth Group, Student-Labor Alliance

A source advised that on January 31, 1963, the W.E.B.
DuBois Club of San Francisco held its first general meeting
at California Hall, Polk and Turk Streets, San Francisco,
California, at which time the aims of the club were put forth
as follows by TERENCE "KAYO" HALLINAN:

(1) Alleviate the Negro problem in the United States.

(2) Promote peaceful co-existence between the United
States and Russia.

(3) Promote and encourage Marxist doctrines and to
bring about a socialistic government in the
United States.

A second source advised in March 1963 that the DuBois
Club was both conceived and originated by TERENCE HALLINAN.

A third source has advised thet TERENCE HALLINAN
attended a Communist Party Youth Commission
meeting in San Francisco in October 1963.

Commencing in March 1963, the DuBois Club published
a newsletter entitled "San Francisco News and “orld %eport."
In its first issue a "Proposed Statement of Principles" was set
forth in which the club's aforementioned aims were elaborated
upon. In the same issue the lead editorial in part described the
San Francisco DuBois Club as "...a group of young people who
are convinced that Socidism is the only answer to the many problems
of our time and so find philosophical rapport with the life -nd
thought of Dr. DU BOIS, nevertheless, we are weighed with humility
in comparing our goals and ambitions with the genius of his life
and work. As a source of inspiration, the figure of W.£.B. DU BOIS
is unequaled in Américan history, but as a standard and example,
we seem miserably lost in his shadow. We can only resolve that
we do his name no dishonor, and whatever we may accomplish should
be recognized as a supplement to his life work."

The November 25, 1961, issve of the
"People's World," a West Coast communist

newspaper published in San Francisco,
contains an article on page 12 reflecting

In

that W.E.B. DU BOIS joined the Communist
Party after applying for admission on
October 1, 1961.

In May 1963, the first source informed that the
"San Francisco News and World Report," although written and
edited by members of the club, was run off on a mimeograph
machine located in the offices of the "People's World;" however,
in March 1964, this source advised that the newsletter was no
longer mimeographed by the "People's World" because of the
unreliability of the machine and, in addition, the name was
changed to "The Insurgent" upon recommendation of one of the
ciub officers who felt the new name sounded more militant.

The first source has also stated that commencing in
May 1963, the DuBois Club had no permanent headquarters and
used to hold its meetings at 307 Page Street, Apartment 3,
San Francisco, California. In March 1964, this source advised
that the club is currently active as a membership organization
and has its headquarters at 1007 Me"llister Street, San Francisco.

INDEPENDENT PRO IVE PARTY

The 1955 Peport of the California Committee on
Un-American Activities, Page 46, stated, "The Independent
Progressive Party in California was quickly captured by the
communists, and by the time the “Yallace for President campaign
had swung into hich gear was being operated lock, stock, and
barrel by the Communist Party of California. Time after time
the committee in questioning witnesses throughout the State
discovered that the leaders of the Communist Parties in various
localities were identical with the leaders of the Independent
Progressive Party in the sare area, It is true, of course,
that in the Indenendent Progressive Party there were many
sincere liberals who, because of dissatisfaction with the two
major volitical organizations registered as Ine@erendent
Prosressives and continued their affiliation until the true
contrel of the I.P.P. became obvious. These people invariably
resigned, many of them having given the benefit of their
experience to various official agencies interested in the
exposure of subversive activities."

Committee to End American Intervention in

Ca ttee to End United States Intervention

Committee to End United States Imperialism

This Committee was organized as the Committee to End
American Intervention in Viet-Nam (Ad Hoc), March 29, 1954, in
San Francisco, California, at the instigation of and by members
ef the W.E.B, DuBois Club of San Francisco, a Marxist youth group,
which has promoted the organization's activities among the various
groups in the San Francisco area interested in peace and disarma-
ment. Its announced aims have included American withdrawal from
Viet-Nam, self-determinaticn for the South Viet-Namese people And
adherence of the United States to the 1954 Geneva Convention.
Demonstrations along with the distribution of and exhibition of
propaganda comprise its program. A flyer advertising a forum of
September 15, 1964, in San Francisco on "World Wide Movements--
for Freedom" referred to "Cuba - Harlem - Congo - Viet Nam" and
listed the Committee to End U. S. Foreign Intervention as sponsor.
Cne of the two sources which provided the information on the
Committee's crganization has advised that it is the same committee.
According to this source, on October 9, 1964, this Committee's
proper name is "Committee to End U. S. Foreign Aggression," but it
is a loose-knit organization and exactness of title or name is of
little concern to the officials and members. The other source
advised on June 28, 1964, thet an Executive Committee of five
members was elected in June, 1964, but no new officers were other-
wise elected.

Another source advised on September 17, 1964, that the
original officers were JOHN W. THOMAS, Chairman; BEVERLY D.
RADCLIFFE, Treasurer, and MARGARET DRIGGS, Secretary. The
signature of two of these are still required for checks written.

One source mentioned above currently advises that no
headquarters is maintained by the Committee; meetings are infrequent
and poorly attended, ranging from eight to twenty members. The last
reported membership total was approximately twenty in June, 1964.

JOHN THOMAS attended meetings of the DuBois
Club of San Francisco on May 10 and 31, 1964,

When interviewed by Special Agents of the FBI
on October 1, 1964, THOMAS indicated he was
not a member of the W.E,.B. DuBois Club and
would not join any group until he found one
that really helped the Negro people.

BEVERLY RADCLIFFE in April, 1964, was a member
of the DuBois Club of San Francisco.

MARGARET DRIGGS, when interviewed by Special
Agents of the FBI on January 25, 1955, said
that her activities in the Communist Party (CP)
began in the middle 1930s during the depression
in Tacoma, Washington. She and her husband
moved to Seattle, Washington, and were members
there of the CP and the Communist Political
Associaticn (CPA). As a result of open criticism
of Party functionaries on her part and on the
part of her husband, she and her husband were
expelled from the CP in 1946 with the provise
that after six months they would reinstate.

She said that they did not seek reinstatement.

The CPA has been designated by the Attorney General
of the United States pursuant to Executive
Order 10450.

"WOKEN FOR PEACE, aka
en Strike for Peace

The "Berkeley Daily Gazette," a daily newspaper of
general circulation published in Berkeley, California,
contained an article in the November 19, 1965,

evening edition reflecting that in November, 1961,
when concern mounted over radioactive fallout

from nuclear testing, a group or wemen in

Washington, D. C. started Women Strike for Peace.

The idea spreed rapidly throughout the country

and now embraces 900 groups, including Women For

Peace groups in the San Francisco Bay area.

These groups support programs to achieve goals
such as:

(1) Continued disarmament negotiations.
(2) A strong and flexible United Nations.

(3) Planning now at state and national levels
for conversion to peace-time economy and
positive efforts to ease world tensions.

The women act as individuals and as a group, with
specific actions suggested by individuals and
groups from all’ over the world, Decision to
participate jointly cn any given sugg: sticn is
democratly arrived at by members of the
Coordinating Committee. Effective cooneration
with other peace groups is encouraged. Monthly
Coordinating Committee meetings and general
meetings, as warranved, are open to ali and
announced in mailings to members. There are no
dues or membership forms nor conditions for
membership.

To stir an awareness of the need for peace,

Women For Peace encourage public education in
peace obtectives at local schools and sponsor
peace-oriented demonstrations and public meetings,
newspaper ads, billboards, and candidates for
public office. On the national level the group
attempts to influence government officials by
letters and conferences.

VIETNAM DAY COMMITTEE (VDC)

A booklet published by the VDC contained the
following policy statement of the VDC adopted
by the general membership, June, 1965

The Vietnam.Day Committee is a group of students,
faculty and other members of the Bay area
community opposed to American intervention in
Vietnam, the Dominican Republic and wherever
else it may occur. Revolutionary struggles

for self-determination are sweeping the world
today. American suppression of these move-
ments, we believe, is immoral and a threat to
the peace of the world. The Vietnam Day
Committee is organizing non-violent direct
actions, teach-ins, door-to-door organizing

and other educational activities to oppose
American intervention. We believe that the
struggle for self-determination in other
countries is related to the struggle for

democracy in America--a democracy in which the

people have the facts and the power to make 1
decisions for themselves. The struggles in
America against racism, poverty, and bureau- |
cratic conformity are part of the same move- |
ment as the struggle against American militarism.

We must build a New America and join with those :
people in Asia, Africa and Latin America building i
a New World,

CITIZENS COMMITTEE TO PRESERVE AMERICAN FREEDOMS

The Guide to Subversive Organizations and Publications,
revised and published December 1, 1961, prepared and released
by the Committee on Un-American Activities, United States
House of Representatives, contains the following on Page 43
concerning "Citizens Committee to Preserve #merican Freedoms":

1. "The (Communist) party's front eperations in the
Southern California District today are *** confined to four
major organizations, "which include the Citizens Committee to
Preserve American Freedoms.

"The Citizens Committee to Preserve American Freedoms

* ® specializes in propaganda aimed at abclishing the Committee
on Un-American Activities and discrediting the Federal Bureau of
Investigation. Created in Los Angeles in 1952, the front
organization is run by Frank Wilkinson, an identified Communist
who recently resumed the full-time paid post of executive
secretary after approximately a year's leave of absence to assist
in similar campaign by another front in New York City, the
Emergency Civil Liberties Committee.

"When the Committee on Un-American Activities held
hearings in Los Angeles September 2-5, 1958, to inquire into the
nature of the party's recent reorganization in California,
the Citizens Committee to Preserve American Freedoms sponsored
a series of public meetings to protest the hearings and the very
existence of the committee. Communists subpoenaed as witnesses
were guests of honor.

“At this time, leaders of the party's Southern California
District were mobilizing Communists in the area for participation
in an intensified campaign to abolish this committee of Congress.
How the Citizens Committee to Preserve American Freedoms served the
Party in this effort was revealed by (Communist Party) District
Chairman Dorothy Healey in a report to the Party's Southern
California District Council on September 21, 1958. Mrs. HEALEY de-
clared that the party preferred public protest meetings to be held by
the Citizens Committee to Preserve American Freedoms rather than
under party auspices because Communists could attend without danger
of being exposed as members of the party. 3he also noted that
Communists scheduled as congressional committee witnesses could not
appear beforehand at openly Communist rallies without creating the #
impression that the party was conspiring with witnesses to withhold
information from the committee."
(committab Sn Un-American Activities,
House Report 259 on the Southern California
District of the Communist Party, April 3,
1959, pp 7 and 8.)
