Dear Mr. Wilderotter:

As you know, we have been checking on certain allegations that
the CIA was a conspirator in the assassination of President
Kennedy, We have talked to Agent Shaneyfelt of the FBI and
have received a summary Bureau report on its investigation to
date into such allegations. We now request’ certain additional
assistance from the Bureau as follows:

1. We enclose an additional 21 photographs of E. Howard Hunt,
reportedly taken during the period 1957-1966. In addition,
we expect to be able to send to you very shortly additional
photographs of Frank Sturgis, taken in the early 1960's.

We would like to have a thorough examination made to com-
pare these photos of Hunt and Sturgis with the photos which
the Bureau. already has on file and which were taken in

Dallas on November 22, 1963, as certain "derelicts" were
being accompanied to the Dallas Police Department. ‘

2. We have learned that E. Howard Hunt is approximately 5 feet
9 inches tall, and that Frank Sturgis is approximately
5S feet 11 inches tall. We would like to have on-site
measurements and photographs taken at one or more of the
scenes in Dallas shown on the Novenber 22, 1963, photos to
determine if the persons shown in those photos are persons
of heights similar or dissimilar to Hunt and Sturgis.

}

agus

When the foregoing has been completed, we will want to
take a statement from Agent Shaneyfelt and such other
Bureau personnel as may be involved in the making of

these investigations. ‘
The enclosed photographs are the personal property of E. Howard

Hunt. Copies should be made and the photos returned to us for
eventual return to Mr. Hunt. The same will hold true for the

forthcoming photos of Mr. Sturgis.

Because our time is running very short, we ask that this request
be expedited with the greatest possible speed. Thank you.

i Very truly yours,

MEMORANDUM FOR: FILE ©
FROM:. Robert B. Olsen

SUBJECT: Telephone Interview with E. Howard Hunt
on March 7, 1975

I called Mr. Hunt at his residence in Miami, Florida, after first
clearing the matter with his attorney, Mr. Snyder, of Baltimore.

I- asked Mr. Hunt about the apparent inconsistency between his des-
cription to us of the circumstances under which he heard about the
assassination of President Kennedy on November 22, 1963, and the
letter from a former family maid, Mary Traynor. In particular, I
called his attention to the fact that Mrs. Traynor ,in her letter,
advises that Mr. and Mrs. Hunt were at home when word of the assas-
ination came in a telephone call from Veronica Moppett. This
is inconsistent with Mr. Hunt's statement that he and Mrs. Hunt
heard about the assassination on the car radio while they were in
downtown Washington, D.C. Mr. Hunt stated that Mary Traynor
seems to be in error. He says that it is entirely possible that
there was such a call from Veronica Moppett, although he does not
remember it. He says that a lot of people were calling each other
with the news about the shooting of the President. He says it is
also possible that this was the manner in which Mary Traynor heard
about the shooting and that she is simply in error in her recollec-
tion that the Hunts were then at home.

Hunt stated that he thinks that the Sidwell Friends School dismissed
classes for the day at 3:15 pm or 3:30 pm. He says it is possible
that the school was dismissed earlier on the day of the assassination
put he does not know for sure. He acknowledges that he and Mrs. Hunt
would not have known about an earlier dismissal of classes in time to
pick up Kevan unless Mrs. Hunt had called the school while they were
enroute from downtown Washington, D. C. He does not recall. making
such a call himself, and he does not recall his wife making one. If
classes let out at the normal time, he and Mrs. Hunt would have arrived
at home, with their daughter Kevan, at about 3:30 or 3:45 pm.



a SECRET/SENSITIVE fe fee

He states that, as he recalls it, there was some delay between the
time of the death of the President and the time it was made public
on radio and television. He does not recall whether the death of

the President had been announced by the time he and Mrs. Hunt arrived
at home and he turned on the television set. [The President was pro-
nounced dead at 2:00 pm, Eastern Standard Time. The exact time when
the death was announced on radio or television has not been checked
out.]

He recalls that when he was watching T.V. with his. family after arriving
at home, either Huntley or Brinkley made some statement to the effect
that the assassination was an outgrowth of the hatred of far Right groups
which was much in evidence in Dallas, as had been shown by a recent inci-
dent involving some one spitting into the face of Adlai Stevenson.. The
implication made by Huntley or Brinkley was that the assassination had
been accomplished by some one from the far Right Wing. ‘This was before
anything was known about the actual assassin. Hunt remembers commenting
to his family that it was just like Huntley or Brinkley to jump to the

: conclusion that the shooting had been by a Right Winger before any evi-

7 dence was available concerning the assassin.

Mr. Hunt will give us a detailed affidavit covering his non-involvement
in the various assassinations. He states that he hopes to be able to
avoid another trip back to Washington because he wants to spend as much
time as possible with his eleven-year old daughter, who is very anxious
about her father's impending imprisonment.

Mr. Hunt states that he hopes to be assigned to a minimum security federal
‘i prison in Florida when he reports on March 25,

With respect to the late-night television program on the evening of March 6,
1975, on ABC TV, Hunt states that he recorded the program on tape. It was
an interview of Dick Gregory, Ralph Schoenman, and one of their companions.
None of the above mentioned Hunt's name or that of Sturgis on the program.
He describes the interviewer pressing Dick Gregory on whether he claims
that the CIA was involved in the assassination of President Kennedy and
Gregory responding that they were not stating that as a fact, but only
that if there was any chance of CIA involvement, then the President's Com-
mission should investigate it. Gregory and his companions showed the
Zapruder film and the major thrust of the program was an emphasis on the
snapping back of the President's head at the time of the fatal shot. One
of the interviewees (I believe he said it was Schoenman) stated that they
did not really expect much from Olsen at the CIA Commission, but that they
were going to "keep embarrassing him with the facts."

Mr. Hunt feels that the press should give some publicity to Schoenman's
background with the Bertrand Russell Foundation.

The interview concerned allegations that Mr. Hunt was involved in the
assassination of President John Kennedy and other. public figures. He
is aware of the public statements made by Dick Gregory and Ralph
Schoenman in early February 1975 relative to his being involved in the
assassination of President Kennedy. He states that most of the infor-
mation that Mr. Gregory and Mr. Schoenman referred to is drawn from
a book by Tad Szulc entitled, E, Howard Hunt, the Compulsive Spy.
Hunt states that the book is saturated with errors. One of those errors
is the claim that Hunt was Chief of Station in Mexico City in the fall of
1963.

SECRET/SENSITIVE t

The Bay of Pigs Background

Hunt states that in 1960 he was assigned to the job of organizing a
"government in exile" for Cuba among Cuban exiles in Florida. The

plan adopted by the National Security Council under President Eisenhower
called for the formation and training of a brigade of Cuban exiles who
would invade Cuba, establish a provisional government, receive recog-
nition by the United States and overthrow the Castro government, The
brigade had its own air force and was otherwise fully equipped by the
United States Government. The operation, however, was not supposed

to be one involving United States Government participation. The venture
was to involve training and launching from outside the United States.

In connection with his political activity and the organization of the
government in exile, Hunt went to Mexico in 1960. ‘Shortly thereafter i
the Mexican government demanded that they leave and he returned to
the United States. Richard Nixon, then Vice President, was working a
closely with the CIA on the project. :

When President Kennedy was elected in November 1960, he was briefed
on the project and confirmed the plans, including the plan to provide air
cover to the invading Cuban force. In early 1961, however, the Kennedy
administration decided that the political organization of the Cuban
government in exile would have to be broadened so as to include all
elements of the Cuban society. Even radical leftwingers were to be
included. Hunt was assigned the job of convincing the leaders of the ed
Cuban community to accept such a broadening of the political structure :
of the government in exile. Hunt found this to be an impossible job to

accomplish because the Cubans recruited to make up the invasion force

had been promised that the government in exile would be solidly anti-

Castro and anti-communist. Hunt asked to be relieved of his assignment

because he thought it was an impossible one to achieve and he returned ;
to Washington to work on propaganda and similar non-political aspects
of the forthcoming invasion. ;

Within twenty-four hours prior to the time that the Cuban brigade was
to hit the beaches at the Bay of Pigs, President Kennedy made two
critical decisions that affected the final outcome: he cancelled plans

NW 50955 DocId:32263469 Page 19 Fro.


SECRET/SENSITIVE

for an airstrike on Cuba which would have destroyed the six remaining

combat planes that were available to Castro; second, the order that

there be no air cover for the invading brigade. The result was that 4
the invading force was chopped up while it was still in the water; the

ships carrying the armored vehicles were sunk, as were the supply

ships, and the troops were left abandoned on the shore. The remnant ‘ : h
of the Cuban Air Force was entirely adequate to demolish the invasion ie |
fleet.

Hunt concedes that he was bitter about the decisions made by President

Kennedy, but he primarily blames Arthur Schlesinger, Adlai Stevenson |
and Robert Kennedy for advising the President to follow the course he I
chose. He particularly feels that the Cubans had been recruited with '
certain promises and that those promises were withdrawn at the last |
minute. Hunt says, in fact, that the decision not to make the airstrike H
and not to provide air cover was made after the invasion fleet had arrived |
at the point of no return, i.e., when radio communication to the invasion i
fleet had already terminated for security reasons.

After the Bay of Pigs disaster, Hunt worked with Allen Dulles until early
1962 at which time Dulles was replaced as DCI, In January 1962, Hunt

was assigned to the Domestic Operations Division of the Deputy Directorate
for Plans. He was involved in handling proprietaries based in the United
States, which have their impact abroad, His immediate superior was
Stanley Gaines, who was either Chief of Operations or Executive Officer

of the Domestic Operations Division and Tracy Barnes, who was Division
Chief of DOD (Barnes is a cousin by marriage to Vice President
Rockefeller. )

The proprietaries which Hunt was engaged in managing were Continental
Press, which prepared news and radio broadcasts for foreign use;
Allied-Pacific Publishing Company of Bombay,.which was engaged in
publishing textbooks for Indian schools; the Rome Daily American, a
cover operation; and Fodor's Travel Guides, a proprietary which Hunt
questions as to whether it had any use. (Fodor's had been set up in

1946 as a cover operation but served no apparent use during the years

SECRET/SENSITIVE

The headquarters for the DOD was at 1717 H Street, N.W., in
Washington, D, C,, and then later it was on Pennsylvania Avenue.
Hunt's assignment with DOD lasted until the spring of 1965.

During the period from January 1962 until 1965, he states that he never
traveled to Mexico or any other Latin American country. His first
trip to Mexico after 1961 was in 1970, when he traveled there for the

Mullen Company after his retirement from the CIA.

Hunt's Whereabouts on November 22, 1963

Hunt states that he had never been in Dallas until 1971, with a possible
exception of a change of planes on his way to Mexico with his family in
1960. He does not recall whether that change of planes took place in
Dallas or in Houston. In any event, he and his family never left the
airport on that occasion.

He has never had any contact, directly or indirectly, with Lee Harvey
Oswald, Jack Ruby or anyone else thought to have been associated with
the assassination of the President.

He was never in New Orleans in 1963 and has never had anything whatever
to do with the Fair Play for Cuba Gommittee, which he identifies as a
communist organization,

During the period from January 1962 to 1965, he traveled once or twice
per year to India, two or three times per year to Paris, once or twice
per year to London, and, during that period, he traveled two or three
times to Rome. His only domestic travel in 1963 was between Washington
and New York. All travel, whether domestic or international, was in his
own name.

Hunt states that in 1961 he used the pseudonym of Edward J. Hamilton in
connection with his work on the Cuban project in Florida. With the
exception of that pseudonym and the pseudonym he used on the identifi-
cation papers provided him for the Ellsberg break in, he has never used
a pseudonym.

On November 22, 1963, he and his wife were driving on H Street at about
9th in Washington, D. C., when he turned the car radio on and learned
that the President had been shot. He and Mrs. Hunt had been shopping
in a Chinese grocery store in that immediate vicinity, immediately prior
to their getting into the car. The Hunts lived at 5215 Balton Road,
Sumner, Maryland. On their way home they drove to the Sidwell Friends
school on upper Wisconsin Avenue and picked up their younger daughter,
Kevan. Kevan told them that Robert and Courtenay Kennedy, children of
Attorney General Robert Kennedy, were students in the same school and
had been picked up by the Secret Service... The children in the school
knew that the President had been shot.

Mr. Hunt states that the following persons are witnesses to the fact that
he was here in Washington, D, C,, at the time the President was shot
in Dallas:

1. His son, Howard St. John Hunt, then ten years of age.
2. His daughter, Lisa, then twelve years of age.
3. His daughter, Kevan, then eleven years of age.

4, The family maid, Mary Trayner, now employed by a family
living at 4806 DeRussey Parkway, Chevy Chase, Maryland,
and whose phone number is 652-2930.

Mr. Hunt believes that he was either taking the day off from work as

a part of annual leave on November 22, 1963, or he may have been
recuperating from a hospitalization for ulcers. He had been hospitalized
at about that period at Sibley Hospital in Washington, D. C,

Mr, Hunt states that he held the following oil company charge account

and credit cards in 1963 and that such accounts may provide corroboration
as to his presence in Washington, D, C., on November 22, 1963:

Esso Oil, Gulf Oil, Texaco Oil, Cities Service Oil, Brooks Brothers
(New York), Garfinkle's, Woodward and Lothrop, Sears Roebuck & Co.,
Hecht Co. He also states that telephone records might be checked with

Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone. Co.; that the CIA might have travel
voucher records showing his travel during that year and that CIA should
also have records on the dates on which he took sick leave or annual
leave.

Mr. Hunt categorically denies that he has been involved in any way what-
soever with the assassination of President Kennedy, Senator Robert
Kennedy, Martin Luther King, or any other person either within or without
the United States. He similarly denies any participation or involvement
whatever in the attempted assassination of Governor Wallace, the :
disappearance of Congressman Hale Boggs or the shooting of Senator
Stennis.

He states that in connection with the planning for the Cuban invasion in
1961, he did suggest that Fidel Castro should be assassinated either before
or contemporaneously with that invasion, but his suggestion was not acted
upon or otherwise approved.

Attached are copies of a press statement made by Mr. Hunt in early
February 1975 in Florida, in which he denies the allegations made by

Dick Gregory and others with respect to his involvement in the assassi-
nation of President Kennedy and a letter written to Mr. Hunt by the former
family maid, Mary Traynor.

Lisa Hunt confirms her father's account that he was at home with the
family in the afternoon and evening of November 22, 1963. She recalls
that her father assembled the family in front of the television set. He ©
wanted them all to watch the program because it was an important
historical matter. They were all shocked about the assassination of
the President.

AFFADAVIT

I, E. HOWARD HUNT, affirm the following to be my recollec-

tions of my whereabouts on November 22, 1963:

1. on that date I was an employee of the Central Intelligence
Agency assigned to the Domestic Operations Division, located in

a commercial building in Washington, D. C.

2. %I was driving with my late wife on H Street near 8th or 9th
Street when we first heard of the Kennedy shooting on our car
radio. We had been purchasing Chinese groceries at a store named,
as.well as I can recall.it, "Wah Ling". I do not know how long
after the initial radio reports were made that my wife and I first
heard the news. Brinkley was the commentator I- remember because

of his having theorized a "right wing plot": i-e., Dallas citizens
had abused Adiai Stevenson and the climate of Dallas extremism had
caused Kennedy's shooting.

3. From the Chinese grocery store we drove out Wisconsin Avenue

to pick up our daughter, Kevan, from Sidwell Friends School. On
joining us my daughter told us what we already knew: that President
Kennedy had been shot. She had learned this because two of Robert
Kennedy's children had been taken from Sidwell Friends School, pre-
sumably by Secret Service agents.

4, From Kevan's school we drove-directly to our home on Baltan
Road in Sumner, Maryland (off Massachusetts Avenue extended). At
home was my newly-born son, Devid (DOB 9/1/63), a maid, Mary Traynor,

HW 50955 DocId:32263469 Page 24


and my wife's aunt, the late Leona Drexler of Chicago. Our elder
son, St. John, a student at nearby Brookmont Elementary School,

was probably already at home. As I recall, our eldest child, Lisa,
arrived soon afterward by bus from Ursuline Academy and joined us‘
at the television set in our basement recreation room where we
stayed long neues watching the unfolding of events: the swearing-in
of LBJ, the arrival at Andrews Field of the Presidential coffin, :
etc.

5. As to why I was not at my office that entire afternoon, I can
only presume that I had left early to help my wife shop fora
planned Chinese dinner, in the preparation of which I normally
assisted.

6. I-was never in Dallas, Texas, until late 1971 when, at the
request of Charles Colson I flew there to interview Gen. Paul
Harkins, former U.S. military commander in Vietnam.

7. %I did not meet Frank Sturgis until the spring of 1972, the
introduction being performed by and at the office of Bernard L.
Barker.

8. I never at any time met or knew Lee Harvey Oswald, Jack Ruby,
or any other person involved in the Dallas slayings.

9. I was not in Mexico in 1963. In fact, I was not in Mexico
between, the years 1961 and 1970, and have not been there since

a weekend pleasure trip to Acapulco in. July of 1970.

HW 50955 DocId:32263469 Page 25


The allegations made by Dick Gregory and others connecting
me to the murder of President John Kennedy are. totally without foundati
They constitute a false and vicious libel.

These charges are bizarre a7 -. products of sick minds,
The Political Left has never been able or willing te accept the fact

that Kennedy's assassin was a man of the Left; thus the Leftist

preoccupation with finding an alternate assassin,

Dick Gregory's smear represents the ultimate in slander and -

innuendo .cistomarily characterized as McCarthyism.

The Rockefeller and other investigative committees will
probably examine Gregory's charges - as. indeed they should. For my
part I would welcome a thorough high-level investigation and a full
airing of all relevant findings. Only if this takes place will I have™
any hope of clearing my name and living free from the threats against.
my life already made by neurotics.

I was not in Dallas,Texas, on November 22,1963; in fact I
nover visited Dallas until eight years later, I-did not meet Frank
Sturgis until 1972, nine years after we were allegedly together in
Dallas. Iwas not in Mexico in 1963, and I did not meet Lee Harvey.
Oswald there or at any other place or time, Moreover, I shared the
nation's grief over the murder of our President. These are the facts.

Until authoritative investigative bodies make \mowm their
judgment concerning my alleged involvement in the Kennedy murder I
will continue to bring libel actions against any and all parties
who repeat the libel. I mst take this course because the libels are
prejudicial to my position before the Court now considering my
Appeal from the Watergate affair, And because the libels threaten my
only means of livelihood, as a writer. But of even greater concern to
me is that continued publicity given to these reckless
charges could stimulate some yet-unpublicized maniac into violent

action against me and my family.
