"My dear IRVING

His Excellency has received your cable. we 5

You have left His Excellency's office with the impression
(B val that he) was willing to offer the new Ambassador the
most loyal and frank collaboration.

However, a certain stiffening has characterized the first
contact between TIMMONS and Foreign Minister CHALMERS and
Deputy Foreign Minister RAYMOND at the Foreign Ministry
Building.

The Foreign Ministry's general opinion is that he is the
least qualified at the present time and that his presence could
be fatal for the resumption of relations.

Please see if he can be recalled before he PUPEE ISS his Igy

(B val Anticipating) the Ambassador's arrival, NORMAN

WARREN , id (B val company) have redoubled their
ardor against the President.

I believe that it is preferable to make these transfers
without the opinion of any unfriendly person. This action
is always considered unfriendly,

President DUVALIER has asked for these recalls to permit
Ambassador TIMMONS to be the [1 gr.G] of a Haitian-United States
Yapprochement. Therefore, as we say, the departure of JOHN
HACEY (B val and company) is imperative.

We are expecting your immediate reply.

You have seen, My dear IRVING, that the recall of
WARREN, WARNER, HASSEY, MOSS and TIMMONS must be obtained.

JACQUES FOURCAND."
