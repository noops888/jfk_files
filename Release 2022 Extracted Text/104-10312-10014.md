2022 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992

STAMONTO PORM NO 8A

OLUTLI

Office Memorandum • UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT

TO

Mr. Joseph Burk) CI/IC

DATB: 30 October 1968

FROM :

SUBJBCT:

Executive Secretary, TSCC

International Dynamics and Gordon Novel

1. I am unable to find any reference in our assorted files to

International Dynamics Corporation. I wonder if this could be an

outgrowth of International Security Services which made the local

papers about two years ago trying to peddle equipment and services

to various members of Congress. At that time, ISS was listed at

1026 17th Street, N.W., which should be just around the corner from

International Dynamics address. ISS was headed up by one Albert P.

Senteio who seemed to be one of those fly-by-night operators having a

somewhat derogatory background file.

2. I am attaching copies of two Bureau memorandums touching

on Gordon Novel's activities in the bugging and anti-bugging field.

These were reported in substance to the Committee via Information

Notices 68-1 and 68-6.

3. Sorry I don't have anything more. I wouldn't be at all surprised

at a connection between Novel and Senteio, since I have a feeling they

are both somewhat addicted to operating in shady areas. Senteio has

used several different company names and addresses locally in the

past several years.
