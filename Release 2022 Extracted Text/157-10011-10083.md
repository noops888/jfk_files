Most of my operations were run out of Europe.

Q Run out of --

A Europe. Some were run out of Miami but the big ones
were run out of Europe.

Q Well, in the course of your activities with respect
to Cuba did you have occasion to become familiar with the
operations of the Miami base?

A Yes.

Q And the situation in the Cuban community in Miami?

A Yes, sir.

1

Q During the nine years you were with DDO's Cuban
operations, who was -- who were the chiefs of the Miami
Station? |

A I think in 1963 Ted Shackley was the Chief and he
was followed by -- I can't think of his name. I should know
it. Well, I will come back to that.

Then, the next Chief of Station was

Q What years was he Chief?

A was there about a year and a half. He

left in 1968 when we reduced the size of the Station. Let's
say (ag vs there from 1966 to 1968. And then Jake Esterlind.
He was Chief of Station from 1968 to 1973. '
:
Q Now, what was the formal title of the group to which
you were assigned for the 9-year period?

A Well, when I first came in it was known as the {

& And then, I believe after that it became the Cuban Operations |
g i i
2 1 Group. i
$ : H

Q Now, was this a special group within the DDO or was

it attached to one of the area divisions?

I was on TDY and this was October,November, 1963, with Fitzgcra}

in Paris. And I knew that he was going to meet -- let me put

Q Do you know whether or not they consider him an
established contact?

A No manner.

Q Do they have any -- do they periodically seek to
collect information from Mr. Sturgis?

A I can't speak to that but the records that we have
don't reflect anything like that. Before they would contact
somebody in that context, knowing that there is a 201 file
on Sturgis, they- would have to coordinate with the Latin
American Division before they did anything since we do hold
the file.

Q Would you briefly explain what a 201 file is?

A A 201 file is a personnel file. It consists of any

information relating to an individual appearing in the press

as a result of other agency reporting and that type of thing.

Q Personnel or personality file?
A Personality file, I should say. Excuse me.
Q Do you know whether or not there is any connection

or relationship between Eugenio Martinez and Mr. Sturgis?
A Well, I will say this. Obviously, they do know
each other. They have to xnow each other from their days

in Cuba.

Q Do you know whether or not Mr. Sturgis ever partici-

pated with Martinez in raids against Cuba?

A No. As I recall, we employed Martinez around 1961,

sabotage-type actions against Cuba. Sturgis never enyjaged jin

any of these things. He never did it for us nor did he ever

' do it on any of our boats, planes, or -~ anything that belonas ”
ia ; to the Agency. :
: 8 i Q When Martinez would run such an operation or captain
: i a boat on such an operation, would he be charged with putting

i

Q And that would include both the publications and tie
radio?

A Right.

Q Let's talk about economic warfare for a couple of

moments. Could you describe for me briefly the type of it
economic activities that were conducted against Castro?

A Well, first of all, we wanted to denigrate the
regime, his credit worthiness, and this type of thing. We
worked very closely with the Coordinator of Cuban Affairs in
the State Department and, well, for instance, in those days, 1
guess it was back in 1964, the price of sugar had jumped from
about a penny a pound to 13 cents a pound, something like

that, and we couldn't understand why. So we kept -- Fidel keot

saying that he had such a poor crop and this type of thing and

we just couldn't figure out wny he had such a poor crop beciuse

some of our own island assets told us they were out there cutt

this cane like mad and the mills were working 24 hours a cay,

this type of thing. So subsequently, we found out that he was

lying and he was storing the raw cane in the schocls, any
place. He had no storage facilities and put it any place he
could,

So in cooperation with a couple of sugar brokers tn

New York, we surfaced this fact and the price of sugar took a

real tumble and ail of a sudden then Cuba started exporting.

It was this type of thing that obviously he was

|
i
i
trying to build up the world price because he didn't have any }

money, he was so short on his exchange, and obviously we didn't!

want him to get the exchange. So it was those types of

activities. .
Q Was the assistance of any U.S. businessmen co) deat ae i

' companies enlisted in that effort?

: A oh, yes.

Hl Q In what manner did you use U.S. companies and

@ ** | businessmen?

It was in this manner that this gal came to our
knowledge. We surveilled her for a long time and determined
that obviously she was receiving messages and she was !
sending messages. So along with the Bureau we put a surveillan-
on her and we obtained a van with DF equipment in it and
indeed, she went on the air in the morning at 5:00 o'clock
or 4:30 or whatever it was, and the direction finder found
it was being beamed toward Cuba, this type of thing, and that
was oen of the examples of the CI activities we were involved
in.

Q Were there many activities of that type?
A. Not really. You have got to remember that the

Bureau's Cuban squad was fairly small. I mean, it was a

squad in terms of FBI squads. It had 36 people on it, some-
thing like that, but 36 people trying to follow a couple of

hundred thousand Cubans around, you know, it is pretty neaa-
tive. This was one of the reasons that obviously fron --

in those days when we had formed these revolutionary fronts

which were being run by the Cuban exiles, they were report

to.Case Officers and they would report on things in the
community, of people they thought were suspect and this type
of thing. These leads in turn were then given to the Bureau
and it was to this extent that we got ourselves involved

in CI activity.

activities in that area was primarily a function of the over-
whelming number of these people and the Bureau's inability
to properly staff the thing?
A Yes, yes. You have got to remember, too, that a lot
of the people on that Cuban squad were in the legal section
of the Embassy in Havana. You know, the FBI overseas is
known as Legal Attaches, obviously working out of the Embassy
the same as our Station was, and a lot of our Station officers
from Havana were down in Miami at that time. So there was a
relationship there that had gone over a period of years
between the Agency and the Bureau.
MR.MANFREDI: We will reconvene at 1:00 o'clock.

No one to my knowledge, has ever questioned the legality or
the propriety of having the Station.

Q There have been some allegations in the press and
elsewhere about possible misuse of Cuban exiles, members of

that community, by the CIA. Are you aware of those?

and solely involved in the intelligence in the Caribbean.

Q Does

does the Headquarters component that now handles the Cuban
situation in Miami run any agents in the Cuban community?

A No. Well, let me explain that to you. We do have

a career agent who has been with us for a good many years

in Miami and we do use him to contact relatives of Cubans
who are still in Cuba. I mean, relatives who are in the U.S.
who have relatives in Cuba.

Now, this is done principally with the idea of a
recruitment target, determine weaknesses or strengths, this
type of thing. He does contact these people all over the
United States. If we come across an individual that looks like
he might be recruitable, or perhaps we could even double hin,
we will, after we make our preliminary assessment, and we i
find out where relatives and these types of people are, we
will ask this career agent or instruct him to go contact
these people, be it.New York, New Jersey, Chicago, or what-
ever.

Q So you use Cuban, now citizens or. aliens in this

country, aS access agents.
