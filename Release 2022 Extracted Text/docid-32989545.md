DEMONSTRATIONS, WASHINGTON, D. C., AND by feat
SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA, NOVEMBER 20, 1971,

SPONSORED BY THE- WOMEN'S NATIONAL _ ABORTION

ACTION COALITION ..

This memorandum advises of demonstrations being scheduled in
Washington, D, C., and San Francisco, California, on 11/20/71 to build
public support for the repeal of antiabortion laws.

The Women's National Abortion Action Coalition was formed at a
conférence held at Columbia University, New York City, in July, 1971, which
was attended by approximately 1,000 women from 29 states. The conference
voted to make a woman's right to abortion a national and political issue.
Subsequent to “its formation, the coalition called for demonstrations in ’
San Francisco and Washington on 11/20/71 to build public support for the Z
repeal of all antiabortion laws, to protest forced sterilization, andto call ~ “
for an end to restrictive contraceptive laws. A source of the Washington
Field Office has advised that the march in Washington is supported by the
(SWP). Carol//Lipman, who is a member of the SWP, is Project Director ~~ ~~~
of the Washington march.

Coalition leaders in ‘requesting permit for the demonstration have
lestimated that participation in the Washington march will range between
410,000 and 20,000 persons. The Washington Field Office has developed

information that 46 buses have been chartered to bring participants to the

demonstration. Participants will represent some 80 cities. The Metropolitan

Police Department anticipates seclea ort will be in the vicinity of Ds 20 person:

We have included all pertinent information concerning this
march in our summary teletype to The White House, the Vice President,
Secret Service, the Attorney General, and military intelligence agencies.

a later consideration as the date of the march approaches.

and repeal of contraception laws. The conference
called for a massive show cof force for these goals
in a march on Washington, D.C., and San Francisco,
California, November 20, 1971. WONAAC is based
on a program of legislative, judicial, and

mass demonstration activities on a local and. .
national level, and seeks to unite all women in
the fignt for the right of abortion.

The September 22, 1971, issue c

Embarci.dero, en route to the Civic Center, San Francisco.
They carried sig::s such as “free cur women" and "separate
church and state". By 12:30 p.m., the marchers had
arrived at the Civic Center where a female rock hand was
performing. A rally was held at the Civic Center from
approximately 1:45 p.m. to 3:30 p.m., addressed by indi~
viduals supporting repeal of abortion laws.

There were no incidents or arrests with regard
hh and rally, according to San Francisco Police
records, and the official pelice estimate of
the crowd attending the relly wes ly oich
hundred individuals. i

fhe Sunday, Noverber 21, 1971, edition of the
“San Francisco Examiner“, a San Francisco, California, ,
daily newspaper, in an article entitled "Pro and’ Anti-
Abortion Forces Hold Rallies", described HELEN MEYERS,

Women's National Abortion Coalition (WONAAC) planned to

old demonstrations at Washington; D. C. and San Francisco,
California on November 20, 1971. The purpose of the |
demonstrations were to call for the repeal of all abortion,
contraception and forced sterilization laws. Thé°Women's
Right to Choose of Maryland, the Baltimore, Maryland
affiliate of WONAAC was to organize busing and housing
arrangements for out-of-state women.

Atrvabdiaa incurs wine obit stim

On November 22, 1971, @ source advised that the
Women's Right to Choose of Maryland, working from 3028
Greenmout Avenue, Baltimore, Maryland, were unsuccessful
in attempts to generate enthusiasm for the WONNAC demonstration
among Baltimore area women. Therefore, the plan to charter
a bus for the purpose of transporting demonstrators to the
Washington, D. C, rally was cancelled.

On November 30, 1971, a second source advised
that the Women's Risht to Choose of Mezyland had been
formed as an “ad hoe" group for the specific purpose of
supporting the Novenber 20, 1971 Washington, D. CG. demonstra-
tion. The source further staved tnat the Women's Right ‘
to Ghoose of Maryland ceased to exist, following this i]
demonstration, and is now cefunct. i

on women's activities, during which she announced that the
WONAAC demonstration on Washington, D. Ce, on November 20,
1971, drew only half the number of persons expected and as
a result, there was a large debt incurred by the national
organization. Rebecca Ann Finch in November, 1971, was an

a
| On February 18, 1972, source, who has furnished
mi reliable information in the past, furnished the following
j # information:
| A Women's National Abortion Action Coalition
} (WONAAC) Convention was held on the Boston University campus,
3 Boston, Massachusetts, during the period of February 11 -
13, 1972,
|
a Approximately 1,000 persons were in attendance
| j at this convention which was held to determine future action
} of WONAAC and to allow diverse factions within the Women's
i Abortion Movement to join ranks under one issue.
| Female members of the Socialist Workers Party (SVP)
: and Young Socialist Alliance (¥YSA) from all over the county
‘ were requested by the national office of the SWP and YSA
“ to attend this convention in order to insure the effective
control of the convention by the SWP,
legs As the youth organization of the Socialist
i Workers Party (SYP), the’ Young Sdcialist Alliance "7+
(YSA) serves as the main source of recruitment
: into that organization. The YSA is described

Re: WONAAC

The SWP specifically wished the convention to
adopt a one-issue position, that being the complete
control of the female body by the individual female.
This specific issue, "women control their bodies" was
adopted by the women’s organization and all other propo-
sals were rejected,

Workshops were organized for each of the many
separate racial and ethnic groups represented at the
conference. Workshops were based on appeal to the speci-
fic group intended and all were supposedly controlled by
the SWP,

A Black, Raza, Asian-American women's workshop
was held on February 12, 1972, with 35 persons attending.
Among the issues discussed at the workshop were the
attempts of democratic and republican presidential candi-
dates to capitalize on minority group attitudes in regard
to the abortion movement and the fact that minority groups
all to often find themselves without a voice when real
issues are involved,

of particular importance to the group was the
La Raza Unida Party, a legitimate political party in Texas
which serves to unite Mexican Americans. Of equal impor-
tance was the Gay Liberation Movement, which the group
felt expresses the plight of gay females who do not want
children and are forced to live with men because of the
mores of American society.

Attendees agreed that the one issue of abortion

more effectively ser the WYoren's Movenent.

The convention adjourned after an agreement that
an "Abortion Action Week"" would be held May 1 - 6, 1972,
This action would serve to keep public attention focused
on the need to legalize abortion and to seek effective
support from the many thousands of women who want to right
to choose,

Il. ACTIVITIES

A. Conferences and Demonstrations

1. WONAAC Founding Conference was held in New York
City, New York, July 16-18, 1971. This conference called for
national demonstrations to be held on November 20, 1971, in

WDC and San Francisco, California, around the theme of ''Reneal

of All Abortion Laws."

a. On November 20, 1971, approximately 1,500 women,
representing womens liberation groups from the East Coast and
Mid-West, gsathered on the Ellipse in V9C, in resoense to the
call by WONAAC to march on the United States Capitol to demand
the repeal of all abortion laws. This grouv devarted the
Ellipse at approximately 10:30 a.m. on that date and marched
along Penusylvania Avewe, N.W., co tie west sice of the Capitol |

“7* * Building. There the marchers assembled for a.rally which ~
i concluded at approximately 4:00 p.m. on the same date. There
i were no incidents of violence and the march and rally were
| peaceful throughout.

| : (WF T-1, 7/21/71)

(WF T-1, 11/23/71)

b. On January 13, 1972, a WONAAC sponsored demonstra-
tion was held from 4:30 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. in the vicinity of
42nd Street and Times Square, New York City, New York protesting
all abortion laws. Ayproximately 50 individuals participated

| and the demonstration ended without incident.

(Physical observation, Special
Agents, FBI, 1/13/72)

2. Second WONAAC Conference was held in Boston,
Massachusetts, February 11-13, 1972. Approximately 1,300
women attended the conference, which once again re-established
and reiterated WONAAC's call for abortion on demand. It was
noted during the conference that WONAAC had been unable to
create anything like a national campaign and that local meetings
‘across the country had been disappointingly small. It was
pointed out that WONAAC had failed to attract the large numbers
of working women, housewives, and students concerned with the
abortion issue, including the majority of women's liberationists
and abortion reform activists. It was felt that the movement
could not succeed without the support of the working women.

}

“At the close of the conferernwe, WONAAC strongly endorsed
the "Abortion Rights Act of 1972," which\is to be introduced in

H the U. S. Congress by Congresswoman BELLA WBZUG from New forks :
This bill would override all laws which impose sanctions upon” Pa
those who choose to exercise their individual right to an abortion.

a. Proposed Actions

jasdhPanantaell It was moved and adopted during the above conference ,
that WONAAC svonsor a week of local abortion activities, May: 1- 6,
1972, consisting of educational programs, legislative support,
judicial action, and culminating in local or regional demonstra-
tions on May 6, 1972, around the demand for reveal of all anti-
abortion laws and restrictive contraception laws and an end to
forced sterilization.

(WF T-1, 2/14/72)

In addition, the following secondary proposals were

adopted during the conference:

can
WFO 100-55420

1. That a telegram be sent to the New York
State Court of Anpeals and New York Governor
NELSON A, ROCKEFELLER, condemning the court's
February 10, 1972,:decision denying women on
Medicaid the right to abortions on demand.

2. That the coalition continue to organize black,
Puerto Rican, Chicano, native American and Asian
American participation in their activities.

3. That members of local coalitions confront
candidates for office and force them to take a
stand on abortion, and that they publicize those
who oppose abortion so that the voters can see
where these politicians stand.

cece

4. That the coalition make a special effort to
reach out to and involve "gay" women in their
activities.

(WF T-1, 2/14/72) I

YSA and SWP members of WONAAC felt the conference to
be a success in that opposition proposals submitted were turned
down in favor of those proposais backed by the YSA-SWP women.

"Women who have had abortions needed to relate

Womens Abortion Coalition was selling bus tickets. for the

Womens March on Washington for repeal of all abortion laws,
repeal of all contraception laws and no force sterilization

of approximately January, 1972 until school closed in
May, 1972. This source was contacted 5/16/72. He stated
also at that time, that LINDA LOEW has been a close
associate of BETTY.SACHS who is the leader of the Young
Socialist Alliance Chapter on campus at the University.
Informant stated that there was no organization formed to
his knowledge of a Womens Abortion Action Coalition in
the Binghamton area.

Other sources familiar with New Left activities
on the campus of the State University of New York at
Binghamton, were contacted during May, 1972, and two
sources advised that they knew of no organization of
Womens Abortion Action Coalition on the campus or in the
Binghamton vicinity during the past year.

Albany Division has had an investigation pending
on LINDA LOEW and a report is being written with appropriate
recommendation for administrative action on LINDA LOEW.
In view of the lack of activity of an Abortion Coalition
organization in the Binghamton area, no further investigation
is being conducted by Albany.

: During early March, 1972, TOBA SINGER reported

more important area of work than VL and that a

March 26, 1972

The stress of the SWP/YSA fomale members in the

May 10, 1972

the Party's work within FL, those in the Party faction
heve apparentiy alienated thensa vor the ott

BOWAC, which comprises appro: f£ of the activists

argument and there is evidence of ‘red baiting". As a

willing to go to jail if necessary we could stop
the war in Vietnam. You cannot have wars with-
out women." .

Jeannette Rankin made the above statement in
May of this year. Fifty years ago, as the first
woman elected to Congress, she voted against
World War I. She has consistently maintained
her struggle for peace, and at 86 she is as coura;
geous and vigorous as ever-~an inspiration to all
women,

The presence of the United States forces in the inl
ernal struggle of Vietnam is immoral and illegal.
There can be no possible justification for our inte
ference in the domestic affairs of this tiny distant
land. :

This 86-year-old woman has stated that she is wii

all women are free to join her, but we can assure

sponsored by this group and to keep the White House and other
agencies advised of developments, it is felt that the field
should be notified of the proposed demonstration and furnished
with instructions for handling information concerning it,
including the need for informant coverage of participating
groups. McT." :

BRIGADE FORMED TO CONFRONT CONGRESS

Helena, Montana
November 27, 1967

To all American Women:
sare I am proud of the fact that my first
vote cast in Congress was a vote

. against war. It was the first oppor-
unity for a woman to vote, because I
was the first woman to be elected to
Congress.

: I believed then, as I do today,
that women are the ones that must be
concerned with the needs and develop-

: ment of the human race. I have always

: fought for the dignity of all human

f beings - for those of the present as
well as those of future generations.

I will continue to struggle as long
as I live. I hope all women will res~
pond to the following call and join me
in Washington on January 8, 1968, the
opening day of Congress.

Jeannette Rankin

A CALL TO ALL AMERTCAN WOMEN who
are outraged by the ruthless slaughter
in Vietnam and the persistent neglect
of human needs at home TO COME TO
WASHINGTON ON JANUARY 8

AMERICAN WOMEN represent 51% of the
voting population of our country.
AMERICAN WOMEN have the power to a-
chieve peace and a decent life for

every American. This is woman power!

NW 68262 Docld:32989545 Page 240

Demonstrate it to the Congress of the
United States! Come to Washington on
January 8 as Congress opens in joint
session. Support Jeannette Rankin as
she leads a representative delegation
of American women to the Capitol to
demand that:
“Congress, as its first order
of business, resolve to end
the war in Vietnam and immedi-~
ately arrange for the with-
drawal of all American troops.
*Congress use its power to make
reparations for the ravaged land
we leave behind in Vietnam.
*Congress Listen to what the
American people are saying and
refuse the insatiable demands of
the military-industrial complex.

WOMEN OF AMERICA, our power is un-
limited. On January 8, American women
will: :

*PETITION the United States Con-
gress o i 7
*CONVENE a Congress of American
Women that afternoon to develop
programs to meet the crisis in
America - programs which will
express our political power,
reason and conscience.

DEMONSTRATION PROTESTING UNITED STATES POLICY
IN VIETNAM, WASHINGTON, D. C., JANUARY 8, 1968
INFORMATION CONCERNING (INTERNAL SECURITY)

The following information has been made available
by sources who have furnished reliable information in the
past:

Source One reported on December 7, 1967, that copies
of “La Wisp", monthly newsletter of the Southern California
Council of the Women Strike for Peace (WSP - see appendix)
being mailed to the WSP mailing list on that date contained
a "Call" from the Jeannette Rankin Brigade (JRB) "To all
American women", announcing a proposed march on Washington,
D. C., on January 8, 19658, when the United States Congress
opens in joint session. This march would be to demand that
Congress, as its first order of business, resolve to end

+ the war in Vietnam and immediately arrange for the with-
drawal of all American troops. (A xerox duplication of tne
first page of the above-mentioned December 1967 issue of
"Ta Wisp", containing this "Call", is appended to this
memorandum, ) :

The partial list of JRB sponsors included in this
issue of the "La Wisp", contained the names of only two
women presently active in the Southern California area,
Mary Clarke (see characterization of her in the apoendix
page on WSP), and motion picture actress Leslie Parrish.

Source One has advised that Parrish has only
recently become interested in activities of WSP and has
attended less than five WSP activities. Source Two reported

with message service through telephone number 652-3380

(the Calder Agency, 8749 Sunset Boulevard, Hollywood, Los
Angeles). .She has formerly been a member of the American
Federation of Radio and Television Artists, and is currently
a member in good standing with the Screen Actors Guild,
Hollywood, her dues being paid through May 1, 1968.

t _ According to Source One, the Southern California

; Council of WSP is presently coordinating local activity to

| form a contingent of the JRB from Southern California. They
are making office space and telephones in their Los Angeles
headquarters, 5899 West Pico Boulevard, Los Angeles available
for this purpose. Spearheading the local committee are
Mary Clarke and Eva Korn, both of whom are active in WSP.

\ Mary Clarke is currently a member of the JRB's National Steer-
‘ing Committee.

Source Three reported during November 1947, that
Eva Korn was a member of the Los Angeles County
Communist Party (ASCCP) during the ‘years 1046
and 1947.

| To give publicity to the proposed activity of the
JRB, the local WSP office is circulating a reprint from the
“San Francisco Chronicle", issue of Saturday, May 20, 1967,
| page nine, which contained a feature article regarding the
| opposition to wars by former Congresswoman Jeannette Rankin,

, Rankin Brigade should be made up of only those women who

; volunteer to participate with the prior understanding that

, they should be ready to spend at least two months in jail

. for the commission of civil disobedience while in Washington,

pen

Sunderland also suggested that a good way to recruit’
women to join the Brigade would b 6 make a pitch, for
recruits when Mary Clarke, DagmaryJilson and Ruth/Krause

. are making their respective speaking engagements across the
United States since their return from a trip to Noxzth Vietnam,
which they visited as representatives of WSP during the dou
fall of 1967. —

Source Four advised during the summer of 1965 /

that June Sunderland, 3730 Hollister Avenue,

Santa Barbara, California, had attended a 1967

"peace conference" in Helsinki, Finland, at the

invitation of the Communist Party (CP), and that

: funds to cover her expenses were raised in part

t by the CP; and that following her attendance at
the Helsinki affair she went on to Russia for ten
days at the invitation and expense of the Soviet
Government. :

Source One learned that a communication was re~
ceived from eastern sponsors of the JRB on December 7, 1967,
indicating that the JRB march on Washington might not be
held on January 8, 1968, but possibly would be set back until
either the 15th or 22nd of January 1968, depending wvipon
he date that the United States.Congress would reconvene.
‘he communication indicated that since the entire purpose :
‘of the Brigade would be to confront the opening joint session
of Congress that it would be futile to schedule the march
prior to the date Congress would reconvene. The suggestion
was made that recruitment of local womeri to participate in
the SRB be heid in abeyance until a confirmation had been
obtained indicating the date on which Congress would reconvene.

eat Source One,had indicated that although the "Cail",
. as reproduced in "La Wisp", states, "There willl be local

, actions across the country at the same time as the action

: in Washington, D. C., " that there are no current plans for

an organization of peace forces that met recently with seven
members. She said four of the seven were from the "left" but

organizational nature because it was new, and she thought she
could help. :

the University CP Club was held at Seattle on April 2, 1963.

Chairman, said attention should be placed on three political
questions - peace, civil rights, and labor. Under peace, he
said CP clubs should inject the Women Act for Peace campaign

February 5, 1966, TAIMI HALONEN was praised for effective |
peace work and for her help in developing unity among the peace co
forces. Section-wide concentration was urged in assisting
SWAP to visit 1,000 workers on the Vietnam issue, _

A third source advised on February 24, 1966, a
Northwest District CP Committee meeting was held at Seattle
February 12, 1966. after lunch, the entire group participated

used consistently by SWAP and: is that of ANCI KOPPEL, also known
as Mrs, CHARLES KOPPEL, KOPPEL has been and continues to be
the coordinator and apparent prime motivating force of SWAP

__W.E.B. DU BOTS CLUBS OF AMERICA (DCA) _

A source advised that on October 26-27, 1963, a con-
ference of members of the Communist Party, USA (CPUSA), including
national functionaries, met in Chicago, Illinois, for the purpose
of setting in motion forces for the « of anew national
Marxist -oriented youth organization which woul unt for the most
peaceful transition to socialism. The delegate 2 told that it
would be reasonable to assume that the young socialists attracted
into this new organization would eventually pass into the CP

itself.

A second source has advised that the founding convention
for the new youth organization was held from June 29-21, 1964,
at 150 Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco, Cal niz, at which
time the name W.E.B.DuBois Clubs of America (DCA) was adopted.
Approximately 500 delegates from throughout the United States
attended this convention.

The second source advised in September, 1966, that MIKE
ZAGARELL, CPUSA Youth Director, stated that in Negro communities
the Party still supported the plan to build "left" socialist
centers and to solidify the Party base through the DCA. This
scurce also advised in Septenber, 1966 that DANZSL RUBIN, CPUSA
National Organizational Secretary, stated the Party believes
the DCA should have a working-class outlook and be a mass organiz-
ation favorable to socialism, socialist countries’ and Marxism,
and in April, 1967, advised GUS HALL, CPUSA General Sécretary,
had indicated the DCA primary emphasis should be on developing
mass resistance to the draft.

A third- source advised in September, 1967, that JARVIS
TYNER was elected chairman of the DCA on September 10, 1967, at
the Third National Convention of the DCA held in New York, New
York, from September 8+10, 1967.

A fourth source advised during August, 1967, that JARVIS
TYNER is a member of the National Committee of the CPUSA.

“A fifth source advised on September 21, 1967, that the

headquarters of the DCA is located at 34 West 17th Street, New
York, New York.

The "Berkeley Daily Gazette," a daily newspaper of 7
general circulation published in Berkeley, California,
contained an article in the November 19, 1965,evening
edition reflecting that in November, 1961, when con-

cern mounted over radioactive fallout from nuclear
testing, a group of women in Washington, D. C. started
Women Strike for Peace. The idea spread rapidly through-
out the country and now embraces 900 groups, including
omen For .Peace groups in the San Francisco Bay area.

These groups support programs to achieve goals such as:
(1) Continued disarmament negotiations.
(2) A strong and flexible United Nations.

(3) Planning now at state and national levels for
conversion to peace-time economy and positive
efforts to ease world tensions.

The women act as individuals and as a group, with specific
actions suggested by individuals and groups from all over
the world. Decision to participate jointly on any given
suggestion is democratly arrived at by members of the Co-
ordinating Committee. Effective cooperation with other
peace groups is encouraged. Monthly Coordinating Committee
meetings and general meetings, as warranted, are open to
all and anneunced in mailings to memsers. There are no
dues or membership forms nor conditions for membership.

To stir an awareness of the need for peace, omen For

Peace encourage public education in peace objectives at

local schools and sponsor peace-oriented demonstrations

and public meet. S, newspaper ads, billboards, and
public office. On the national level

WITHOUT WOMEN

Women must use their minds, their voices, and
their bodies to stop the killing in Vietnam; .to do
less is tc ignore our special responsibilities to
the humen race.

"10,000 women have sat back end let theit sons
be killed in Vietnam. If we had 10,000 women will-
ing to go to jeil if necessary we could stop the war
in Vietnam. You cannot have wats hhowt ronén."

Jeannette Rankin rade the above statement in
Hay of this year. F-: y years ego, as the first
woman elected te Congress, she voted agsinst World
War I. She has consistently maintained her etrug—
gle for peace, and et ‘86 she is as courageous and
vigorous as ever -—~ an inspivation to-all women.

The ptesence of the United States forces in
the internal sttuggle of Vietnam is immoral and
illegal. There can be no possible justification
for our interference in the domestic affeirs of
this tiny distent lend.

This 86~—yeser-old woman has stated that she ~
is willing to stay in jail until the bombing ie
stopped. Not all women ere free to join het, but
we can ascure her that thousands of women will
watch peacefully beside het. ome will picket,
othets will go to jail until bail is atvanged,
and others will stay in jail with Miss Renkin.
Every « 's participation is ecually valuable.
“Ye are confident each one will do the maximum of
yhich she is capable.’

On Januery 8th, women from all over the land a
will convetge on Washington to demand the end of a
e shall come as individ— ‘
uals, of as organizations, but ‘we shall join to-
gether as concerned women under the aegis of
Jeannette Rankin, :

Will you join us to cave the men you love *
from death, and the country you love from shame?

Dear Friend: : : -

We are sending this letter to you and others from whom we have not heard much
recently, in the hope of re-enlisting your efforts in the Women for Peace

movement. It has been too long since we last heard directly from many of you,
and our meetings with those of you whom we have seen recently have been brief,

Of course, we know the paralyzing sense of frustration we all feel occasionally,
as we learn of the mounting horrors in Vietnam. But this feeling is only
temporary, and quickly gives way to activity. As women, we bear the major
responsibility for the preservation of life, and thus a major responsibility

in the peace movement,

mclosed you will find an announcement of the latest national women's effort
for peace. Several peace groups in Portland are cooperating in raising funds
to send representatives to Washington. We hope that you will also support this
effort, to insure representaticn from Portland Women for Peace. The coupon
on the enclosed notice is for your use in this effort,

oe someone else to go, and that you will also. Join, -with-us at, the- Pioneer. Sabeatosees 2

In addition, please let us hear from you on your ideas of what more we might
do locally, We have some ideas too, which we hope to share with you, and on
which we shall need much help,

- Please get in touch with one of us soon, Your help, ideas, and efforts are
urgently needed, 7

Dear Friend:

We are sending this letter to you and others from whom we have not heard much
recently, in the hope of re-enlisting your efforts in the Women for Peace

movement, It has been too long since wo last heard directly from many of you,
and our meetings with those of you whom we have scen recently have been brief,

Of course, we know the paralyzing sense of frustration we all feel occasionally,
as we learn of the mounting horrors in Vietnam, But this feeling is only
temporary, and quickly gives way to activity. As women, we bear the major
responsibility for the preservation of life, and thus a major responsibility

in the peace movement,

Enclosed you will find an announcement of the latest national women's effort
for peace, Several peace groups in Portland are cooperating in raising funds
to send representatives to Washington. We hope that you will also support this
effort, to insure representaticn from Portland Women for Peace, The coupon
on the enclosed notice is for your use in this effort.
:
1
In addition, we will have a supportive peaceful demonstration
in Portland at
NOON, Monday, JANUARY 15th
i Pioneer Post Office
5th and Morrison

| We are asking participants to wear black, and to bring a black

(or dark colored) umbrella, We shall carry the umbrellas opened,

rain or shine, Placards (to wear) and leaflets (to distribute),

expressing support for the Jeannette Rankin Brigade, will be

available, We shall march around the Post Office block for one hour,

from noon to 1 p,m., leafleting as we walk,
)
| we hope, if you cannot go to Washington,yourself, that you will contribute. to
elp someone else to go, and that you will also join with us at the Pioneer
ost Office at noon Monday, January 15th.

in addition, please let us hear from you on your ideas of what more we might
co locally, We have some ideas too, which we hope to share with you, and on
which we shall need much help,

H Please get in touch with one of us soon. Your help, ideas, and efforts are
| urgently needed. 7

Committee of WSP.

Source three advised in July, 1955, that Mary Clarke
was dropped from Los Angeles County Communist Party
(LACCP) in the Spring of 1955 for personal reasons
and not for any political differences with LACCP.

Source one further reported that Glory Roberts of
Pacoima, California, who is editor of the “Social Action
Communicator", a monthly publication located in Pacoima,
California, recording secretary of the Peace Action Council (PAC)
(See Appendix), and representative to the PAC from the Black
Congress and vice versa, was selected as Chairwoman of a JRB
committee to reach into the black community to get participants
from the Black ghetto involved in the demonstration in
Washington, D.C. on January 15, 1968. Source one advised that
in order to do this, all the organizations comprising the
JRB will have to pledge money to get the women to Washington, D.C.
and back to Los Angeles, California.

Source one stated that three committees have been
established within the JRB. One of these committees has
been established to draw up a list of redress of grievances.
Each branch of the JRB throughout the nation will, when
gathered in Washington, D.C, as a main committee, decide
the major grievances and the redress of grievances will be
incorporated into a petition to be presented to Congress.
The second committee will be to involve the people in the
black community in the demonstration. The third committee is
to act as a coordinating committee.

the women from Southern California will leave by plane on
Sunday, January 14, 1968 at approximately 10:00 A.M., arriving
Washington, D.C, at approximately 6:00 P.M. on the same date.

and other women making the trip will pay all their own
expenses, No expenses are contemplated while the women are

in Washington, D.C. inasmuch as arrangements have been made
for the women to stay with other WSP members in the
Washington, D.C, area. Source one advised that it is
contemplated all the women will stay in Washington, D.C, until
Tuesday, January 16, 1967.

Source one advised it was reported the women from
across the nation would gather at the Union Depot, Washington, D.C.
at 11:30 A.M. on January 15, 1968. Source one further reported
it is hoped ten thousand women will participate in the
demonstration. After the gathering at Union Depot, the women
will march in solemn procession, all wearing black, to the
steps of the capitol building where the petition containing
the redress of grievances will be presented to the Congress.
Source one further advised it had been reported that Representative
Me Cormick and Senator Mansfield had agreed to receive the
petition. Representative Mc Cormick, according to source one,
had agreed to accept fifteen women in his office at which time
he would receive the petition, but source one advised the
JRB now wants Representative Mc Cormick and Senator Mansfield
to accept the petition on the steps of the capitol building
in order that they might get news coverage. After the petition
has been presented, the JRB wants the redress of grievances
read into the Congressional Record.

Further activities of the JRB while in Washington, D.C.
are to includé a three hour "Women's Congress", possibly on the
grounds of Georgetown University.

Mary Clarke pointed out that although the original
intention had been to have only those women participate
in the JRB who were willing to risk arrest for civil disobedience,
she stated at the above meeting that no civil disobedience is
anticipated in view of the large number of organizations
participating who are opposed to such civil disobedience.
However, she further stated that individuals are not going to
be discouraged who might elect to create civil disobedience.

COMMUNIST INFILTRATION OF THE
FIRST UNITARIAN CHURCH OF LOS ANGELES

A source advised on May 22, 1967, that the
premises of the First Unitarian Church of Los Angeles, 2936
West 8th Street, Los Angeles, California, have been utilized
for meetings by Communist Party members and sympathizers over
& period of years. Speakers and lecturers at.the church
frequently .espouse Communist causes or follow the Communist
Party line, Communist front group literature is distributed
at the church. The church is used by some Communist Party
members for “mass concentration" work.

This same infiltration extends to adjuncts of
the church such as the Unitarian Public Forum and the Fellow-
ship for Social Justice, formerly known as the Unitarian-
Universalist Fellowship for Social Justice.

STEPHEN H. FRITCHMAN has been minister of the
church since 1948,

Reverend STEPHEN H. FRITCHMAN is described in
the Fourth Resort, Un-American Activities Committee in
California, 1948, page 115, as a very active "Communist
fronter" and connected with numerous "Communist front organi-
zations and activities."

Membership in the First Unitarian Church does not,

of itself, connote membership in or sympathy with the Communist
Party.

the Jeannette Rankin Brigade (JRB) with headquarters at
133 West 72nd Street, New York City, originally scheduled
a demonstration in Washington, D.C. on January 8, 1968, to
coincide with the opening of Congress. In view of the
fact that the reconvening of Congress was delayed until
January 15, 1968, the organization rescheduled the
demonstration for that date, The source stated that the
JRB is composed mostly of members of Women Strike for
Peace, a pacifist organization and is using the name of
the JRB only for this one affair.

The above source stated that individuals are to-
meet at Union Station in Washington, D.C,, at approximately
11:30 a.m. on January 15, 1968, and then walk in a "silent
procession" to the United States Capitol. Literature sent
out by the local office of Women Strike for Peace indicate
that the women will assemble at Union Station at the above
time and "in solemn procession and wearing black, we will
walk to the Capitol steps behind our delegation who will
present our ‘Women's Petition to the Congress"* demanding
redress of grievances,"

According to the source, the group wanted to have
Speaker of the House McCormick and Senator Mansfield meet
them on the Capitol steps and accept the above mentioned
petition, Thereafter, the women would visit both the Senate

might be committed, The source stated that following the

that they cannot demonstrate on the Capitol grounds in ot
a group or carry placards, as such activity is prohibited ~~ 7
by rules of Congress, Forer, as attorney for the group,’
advised the officials that these women will be coming to
the Capitol as individuals and although they will be walking
together they can only be kept out of the Capitol building
if the police exclude all visitors from the United States

in refusing to allow its citizens to present their grievances
to Congress,

the following individuals:

v WOMEN FOR PEACE aka
Women Strike for Peace

The "Berkeley Daily Gazette," a daily newspaper of
general circulation published in Berkeley, California,
contained an article in the November 19, 1965,evening
edition reflecting that in November, 1961, when con-

cern mounted over radioactive fallout. from nuclear
testing, a group of women in Washington, D. C. started
Women Strike for Peace. The idea spread rapidly through-
out the country and now embraces 900 groups, including
Women For Peace groups in the San Francisco Bay area.

These groups support programs to achieve goals such as:
7 (1) Continued disarmament negotiations.
(2) A strong and flexible United Nations. -

(3) Planning now at state and national levels for
conversion to peace-time economy and positive
efforts to ease world tensions.

The women act as individuals and as a group, with specific
actions suggested by individuals and groups from all over
the world. Decision to participate jointly on any given
suggestion is democratly arrived at by members of the Co--
ordinating Committee. Effective cooperation with other
peace groups is encouraged. Monthly Coordinating Committee
meetings and general.meetings, as warranted, are open to
all and announced in mailings to members. There are no
dues or membership forms nor conditions for membership.

To stir an awareness of the need for peace, Women For
Peace encourage public education in peace objectives at
local schools and sponsor peace-oriented demonstrations
and public meetings, newspaper ads, billboards, and
candidates for public office. On the national level
the group attempts to influence government officials

by letters and conferences, ‘

vour i of American-Soviet Friendship

EDWIN GORDON FOX, 7147 Jeffrey Avenue, Chicago,
Illinois, (now deceased) made available in January, 1954, the
"First Annual Report CCASF," an undated publication which
stated that the Chicago Council of American-Soviet Friendship
(CCASF) was incorporated in July, 1943. This document stated,
"The Council's affiliation with the National Council of
American-Soviet Friendship (NCASF) was validated August 11,
(1943), The present name was adopted to conform to standard
national practice. It should be noted, however, that the
Chicago Council is entirely autonomous; the government of its
affairs rests exclusively in the hands of its Chicago Executive
Board,

On April 8, 1965, a source furnished information to
the effect that as of March 11, 1965, this organization would
be known as the Chicago Council of American-Soviet Relations
(CCASR). MANDEL TERMAN continued to be listed as Chairman of
the new organization.

During April, 1965, a second source advised that
MANDEL TERMAN had arbitrarily dissolved the Board of Directors,
assumed all financial and other functions of the organization,
and was maintaining existing records of the organization at
his residence, 660 West Irving Park Road, Chicago, Illinois.
The aims and purposes of this organization continued to be
to work for peaceful coexistence and friendship with the USSR.
While it claimed to be an autonomous organization, its program
followed the NCASF and it was in frequent contact with the
NCASF.

On November 5, 1958, a third source advised that in
the early 1940s, MANDEL TERMAN was a member-at-large of the
Communist Party (CP) of Illinois. ERMAN was in Russia in
November, 1958, where he had gone to discuss the treatment of
Jews and to discuss Jewish culture in the USSR with the
leadership of the Soviet Union.

A source advised on May 9, 1967, that it was his
understanding that the National Lawyers Guild (NLG) was
formed around 1936 in New York City, and that the Chicagse
Chapter of the NLG (CCNLG), which is affiliated with the
national group in-New York, was formed shortly thereafter,
possibly in 1937 by a group of liberal progressive lawyers
in protest against activities of the American Bar Asseciation
which they claimed was a non-liberal, non-progressive
organization. The CCNLG has no established headquarters kut
occasionally uses the return address of its officials in

TO ALL AMERICAN WOMEN, Bu

I am proud of the fact that my first vote cast in Congress
was a vote against war. It was the first opportunity for a
woman to vote because I was the first woman to be elected

to Congress.

I believed then as I do today that women are the ones who
must be concerned with the needs and development of the
human race, I have always fought for the dignity of all

human beings -~ for those of the present as well as those

of future generations,

I will continue to struggle as long as I live.

I hope all women will respond to the following CALL, and
join me in Washington on January 8, 1968, the opening
day of Congress.

TO COME TO WASHINGTON JANUARY 15. & 16

AMERICAN WOMEN constitute 51% of the voting population, yet a high percentage of us don’t vote. -
It is time for-women to break out of their societal molds and take their place as effective, vocal citi-
zens. WOMEN CAN ELECT the President they want; Women can determine the political, social and
economic direction of the nation. WE HAVE WOMEN POWER. Let’s use it to demonstrate our
opposition to this war to the Congress of the United States.

We are a broad coalition of women from many areas of American hfe. We shall meet in Washington
on January 15 for the opening of Congress to demand the following:

1, CONGRESS, AS ITS FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS, RESOLVE TO END THE +
WAR IN VIETNAM AND IMMEDIATELY ARRANGE FOR THE Wisin vind
OF ALL AMERICAN TROOPS.
CONGRESS USE ITS POWER TO HEAL A SICK SOCIETY AT HOME.
CONGRESS USE ITS POWER TO MAKE REPARATION FOR THE RAVAGED
LAND WE LEAVE BEHIND IN VIETNAM.

4, CONGRESS LISTEN TO WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE SAYING AND
REFUSE THE INSATIABLE DEMANDS OF THE MILITARY-—INDUSTRIAL
COMPLEX.

After we petition the United States Congress, we will hold our own congress to articulate our position
on the basic problem of achieving peace. We declare our intention to return to our communities and
mobilize women to dedicate ourselves to reshaping American society, and restoring our country to a
position of honor in the community of nations.

On January 15, we will meet at the Union Depot in Washington, D.C., at 11:30 A. M., and walk behind
our delegation which will present our petition to the U.S. Congress.

On January 16, many of us will stay in Washington to begin implementation of these demands by

oo: NY

Re New York letter to the Bureau, 6/6/72; Bureau 0-7
to New York, 7/12/72; and Philadelphia letter to the Bureau,
2/28/73.

As outlined in referenced New York letter, the oat :
New York Office noted, as far back as June, 1972, it

recognized that, although several leaders of WONAAC were
known to be SWP members, their activities, as pertaining to
“MIONAAC, had been directed towrd the legal repeal of all
restrictive abortion laws, and investigation had disclosed
no indication that WONAAC, as an organization, had engaged in
any subversive or vidlence prone activity.

4
Referenced Bureau 0-7, referencing the aforementioned LL
communication, nevertheless instructed that the New Yak Office,
as office of origin, had overall responsibility for captioned
organization, and directed the New York Office to reopen its 5
case and submit semi-annual reports. cy

A review of the results of the continuing investigation
of WONAAC, together with all indices and references pertaining
thereto, since June 1972, reflects no apparent change in the
activities or the organization @ its membership from that
outlined above.

The New York Office is in accord with the view of the
Philadelphia Division, as set forth in its referenced letter,
that WONAAC represents basically a social change vehicle: which,
despite disparate political views of its leaders and membership,
deals with the single issue of abortion rights

In view of instructions set forth in Bureau
: memorandum 10-73, dated 3/6/73, paragraph G, wherein the
| Bureau reiterated its policy that the FBI has no interest
| in individuals and organizations involved in legitimate
| dissent and the recent United States Supreme Court decision
upholding the right to abortion, it appears continued @
investigation of WONASC as such is not justified.

The New York Office further concurs with the
Philadelphia view that continued investigati on of the SWP
and/or YSA would produce the desired coverage and information
concerning its members who are associated or active in WONAAC,

UACB, the New York Office is closing the investigation
of this organization.

I, ORGANIZATION OF BOSTON WOMEN'S

ABORTION ACTION COALITION (BOWAAC)

BOWAAC, the local affiliate of the
Women's National Abortion Action
Coalition (WONAAC), was formed out
of the local Female Liberation group;
and while BOWAAC is not exclusively
made up of Socialist Workers Party
(SWP), Boston, and Young Socialist
Alliance of Boston (YSA~B) female
members, it is controlled by members
of those groups.

WONAAC has been publicly described
as an organization of groups whose
aim is to effect the overthrow of
existing abortion laws and to demand
free abortion on demand.

The SWP, Boston, is the local affiliate
and follows the aims and purposes of
the national SWP.

The SWP has been designated pursuant
to Executive Order 10450.

The YSA~B is the Boston affiliate
of the YSA, the youth organization
of the SWP.

A. Headquarters

In late summer, 1972, BOWAAC moved its headquarters
from 552 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, Mass., to
429 Boylston Street, Room 323, Boston, Massachusetts,

restraints on the practice of abortion has resolved the
abortion problems,

legal or illegal abortions or had denied them contraception,
voluntary sterilization or good pre-natal care, or had
sterilized them without their knowledge or consent.

Re: National Women's Political Caucus (NWPC)
Policy Council Meeting

Source, who has furnished reliable information in the
past, provided the following information on July 3,. 1972:

A Policy Council Meeting of the National Women's
Political Caucus (NWPC) was held in Washington, D.C. during
the period June 24, 1972 - June 25, 1972.

The NWPC is a legitimate, loosely-knit, open
organization of politically motivated women
seeking equal recognition in the American
community.

During the Policy Council Meeting there were no
overt attempts by any organized aroup to influence the nolicy
meeting and there were no individuals present who identified
themselves as members of any organization which might be construed
as subversive and/or supporting any cause except legitimate
change.

of the Women's National Abortion Action Coalition (NONAAC) was
present in brochures and pemphlets located throughout the meeting
area, All of the WONAAC material was geared to the abortion
movement and specifically the WONAAC conference scheduled for
Hunter College, New York, July 15 ~- 16, 1972..

1
Of significance, however, was the fact that literature 1)

WONAAC was founded in July, 1971. for the purpose of
forming a national movement of groups scattered
throughout the United States who favor and oa
now work to legalize abortion The Young Socialist
Alliance (YSA) and Socialist Workers Party (SWP)

are playing a major role in WONAAC,

The SWP has been designated pursuant to
Executive Order 10450. 7

/ ; ; Tees |



Re: NWPC Policy Council Meeting

As the youth organization of the SWP, the
YSA serves as the main source of récruitment into
that organization. The YSA is described in the
masthead of its official publication, "The Young
Socialist Organizer," as "a multinational
revolutionary socialist youth organization."

During the council meeting on June 24, 1972, Mary
Clarke, who is associated with the Southern California WPC,
an affiliate of the NWPC, advised a group of volicy -council
members that WONAAC had been using the Southern California WPC
name as an endorser of WONAAC. Clarke also stated that MONAAC
had passed out propaganda at a caucus rally in California and
were very effective at taking control of small gatherings.

The Chairwoman from Nassau County in New York, whose
name was not recalled, defended WONAAC stating that "they were
a good group". This woman's position was not supported and,
in general, WONAAC literature was not accepted bv those versons
present, Jill Ruckelshaus, a new member of the Policy Council,
is reportedly concerned about the SWP's attempts to align
itself with the abortion movement and will be using her newly
gained position to fight SWP attempts at control of local
WPC groups.

The NWPC organizing brochure published by the NWPC
has been written to assist individual WPC groups in organizing.
The brochure lists political varties and para-volitical
organizations to be contacted by caucus organizers when forming
the nucleus of a WPC. Amonq those listed was the SWP. After
discussions at the caucus it was determined that the SWP should
be removed from the list. The new edition of the “PC organizing ~
brochure will not list the SWP; it has been replaced by National
Peace Action Coalition (NPAC). :

The NPAC was founded in 1970 by rembers of the SWP.
Its basic objective is to unite masses of people
including laber unions, GIs, ané the black
community in the struggle to end United States
intervention in Southeast Asia through orderly and
peaceful tactics.

The Women's National Abortion
Action Coalition

Confidential sources one, two and three, all of
whom have furnished reliable information in the past, advised -
on July 18, 19, and 20, 1972, respectively, that a Women's
National Abortion action Coalition (XNAtC} Conference was
held at Hunter College, Park Avenue and ogth Street, on
duly 15 and 16, 1972,

Confidential source number one advised that
New York City was *picked for the site of this convention
because this city is considered to be the center of the most
powerful anti-abortinn effort so far. *

The WONAAC Conference was open to all women
who ‘supported the Abortion Law Repeal Movement, Registration
was $3.00 per person. Housing and child care facilities were
available. There were approximately 800 women in attendance
at this conference,

Discussions had at this conference centered on
plans for (ené-future activity in the campaign to repeal
all anti-abortion and contraception laws and ¢wo}to end
forced sterilization,

A discussion was held coneerning the attacks
being made by the Catholic Church Hierarchy and other
anti-abortion groups against women's rights to their
own bodies,

WONAAC is aware of the fact that progress for
these matters will not come easy, that it will be fought by
various groups step by step all the way, therefore, this
conference was called to discuss all the different approaches
and to decide on the major direction for WONAAC to take,.

interruption was made by Rose/Weber, a WONAAC
coordinator. She addressed all YSA-SWP members at the
conferance, asking them what. was thelr real reason for
being in attendance at the WORAAC Conference. She
accused the YSA~SYP of not being sincerely interested
in abortion right but rather being interested in what
was best for the SHP-YSA. She stated that -- because of
the YSA-SVP influence being enforced on the conference,
Bhe was resigning as a VONAAC coordinator and staff member.

She getated that she detested the intervention of the YSA-SWP

in this conference; that the SYP-YSA has caused conflict among
the WONAAC staff and therefore, they cannot work out constructive
solutions to their problems. She also suggested that the "z

Population" and pianned parenthood have no voice in discussions
at this conference. Finalizing her accusations, she stated the
YSA-SHP members had no mind of their own nor did they have any
freedom of expression of their own. She stated that they only

“The National Conference shall be the highest

basis of one woman, one vote.

"There shall be a National Coordineting Committee
(acc) composed of one woman from each national organization,

“Where shall also be a Working Committee (WC),

which is a sub-committee of the NCC and which 1s composed

of the project directors or coordinators, the elected
national staff, and one woman from cach coalition, committee,
group and national organisation sypporting and building WONAAC
in the locale of the national office.

In addition to the above, a proposal “that the
National Office of the Women's National Abortion Action
Coalition establish an emergency cach fund, from which to
contribute significant amounts of money to organizations
and individuals who are working to achieve goals compatible
with those of WONAAC..."

"That the NatLonal Office of WONAAC, as its first
act of financial support, pledge $2,000 to the Kennedy-Schulder
suit against the tax-exempt status of the Roman Catholic Church,
ginee the Church has violated restrictions on its political
activity by lobbying for anti-abortion legislation.

"That the National Office of WONAAC pledged
$1,500 to the defense of the seven women arrested in

"That the WONAAC National Office maintain, ~
at all times, a fund-raising starf efficient enough
to meet the needs of the emergency fund at the same
time it raises sufficient capital to maintain the daily
expenses of the National Office and staff..."

Confidential Source number twe related that the
evening plenary session of WONAAC oceurred on July 15, 1972,
and it was immediately apparent that the Socialist
Workers Party - Young Soeielist Alliance (SWP-YSA) group
dominated the meeting. Independent women who wanted to make
statements during this session were voted down by SWP floor
leaders and these same persons continued to vote as a bloc
on all issues.

The group of independent women from various geogra-
phic areas, that is those women who were not associated with the
SWP or YSA, went together after the plenary session was adjourned
and considered the problem of. how to handle the SWP leaders.
While these women were not political realists in their goals,
they did believe in working throughout the existing system
rather than functioning with the SWP in their eventual goal
of revolution,

It was decided that the independent feminists would
no longer continue hasSling within WONAAC. They did not want
te have decisions for them being structured by a male dominated
group. They also decided that money being collected by WONAAC
in the name of abortion law change was not being used Lor that
purpose, but rather to sustain members of the SWP-YSA.

The Sunday morning session, July 16, 1972, was
labeled "Meeting to Discuss Internal Hassles." About 35
independents attended and a few number of SWP-YSA members and
sympathizers were present, Independents there were from New
Haven, Boston, Detroit, New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, and
San Francisco.”

The independents did not waiver in their firm Sees cat

There were approximately 700-800 women in attendance -
at the afternoon session. According to one of the SwP
leaders, these women were frdm 31 states and three countries- :
Canada, Italy and’ Sweden. The states that had more representation
than others were Ohio, Illinois, New York, and Massachusetts.

Most of the problems and differences between tne
independents and the SWP centered around approaches to abortion
law reform, The SWP was charged with always having demonstra-
tions and rallies and never doing any work, through the legis-=
lative process,

The independents stated that they were tired of this
hassle and that they believed there were more effective ways
to change abortion laws than carrying placards in the streets.

After the independent women publicly resigned in
front of the plenary session, two other coordinators announced
they were staying on. One was Barbara Roberts, the other's
name is unknown,

Linda Jenness made a final plea for the independent
women to reconsider. The removal of the independents from WONAAC
has d@bilitated the organization and most independent representa-
tives will be going back to their own cities to work for abortion
law change in organizations vhich have no connection with the
SWP, 7

The concern still exists, however, that WONAAC will
be able to collect monies in the name of abortion reform and

c there is also the concern that women new to the movement will
join in a mistaken notion that‘they will be furthering
abortion law reform.

Independents vowed before leaving New York that
they would try to publicize activities from the elit in an
effort to prevent this.

As the youth orgeniz, ation of the Socialist
Workers Party (SYP), the YSA serves as the
main source of recruitment into that organ-
ization. The YSA is described in the masthead
of its official publication, “The Young
Socialist Organizer," -as "A multinational
revolutionary socialist youth organization."

The SWP has.been designated pursuant
to Executive Order 10450.

PH T-1 advised on May 25, 1972, that Women United for
Abortion Rights (WUAR), 1115 Walnut Street, Philadelphia, Pa.,
telephone WA-2-0381, is the local affiliate of Women's National
Abortion Action Coalition (WONAAC) and that about two weeks ago
| WUAR decided to change their name from WUAR to Philadelphia Women's
National Abortion Action Coalition (Philadelphia WONAAC) and that
they intended to utilize the same office space at 1115 Walnut
Street and the same telephone number. PH T-1 added that this
change was made inasmuch as the name WUAR was found to be unwieldy
and awkward and that it did not convey the group's affiliation with
WONAAC as well as the new name Philadelphia WONAAC.

An article in "The Sunday Bulletin," Section 2, pages
6 and 7, issue of October 31, 1971, listed the various candidates
for political office in the City of Philadelphia in connection with
the forthcoming elections. Photographs of the following individuals
appeared and background information contained under each individual
photograph indicated that all were members of the Socialist
Workers Party (SWP) and that they were also affiliated with the

to determine the actual degree of SWP participation in the affairs
of WONAAC in the Philadelphia area and that he was not aware of
any information which would reflect that Philadelphia WONAAC was
substantially controlled by the SWP. Source explained that the
abortion rights issue had frequently been discussed at many of the -
recent public forum type meetings sponsored by the Philadelphia
SWP and held at the Philadelphia SWP Headquarters at 1004 Filbert
Street in Philadelphia. The discussions held on the abortion
rights issue indicated that the SWP felt that the capitalistic
system had used the dual issues of abortion and women's liberation
to keep women in a position of inferiority, whereas the socialistic
system being promoted by the SWP would be in favor of abortion and
women's liberation, and WONAAC would therefore naturally attract
members of the SWP to their organization.

conducted re WONAAC, or if any active investigation is
warranted by Albany, FBI.

For the information of the Albany Division, the
New York Office is the office of orign, concerning captioned
organization. The Bureau has advised that as the Socialist :
Workers Party and the Young Socialist Alliance play amajor 7
roll in WONAAC throughout the United States, and inasmuch ,
as information has been provided that WONAAC is, for the
most part, totally controlled by Socialist Workers Party/
Young Socialist Alliance, the activities of this aganization
should be followed, for the purpose of determining the
extent of influence and control:. by individuals who are
niembers of Socialist Workers Party/ Young Socialist Alliance,
and who are acting on behalf of these organizations.

Based upon Bureau instructions, in light of
information set forth in referenced Albany letter, concerning
DIANEAPARRY, an Socialist Workers Party organizer in the
Utica, New York area, and her r@orted communication with
national headquarters of WONAAC in New York City. It would
appear advisable for the Albany Division to institute such

i Individuals known to be involved in the women's
liberation movement in the Twin Cities area of Minneapolis
.and St. Paul, Minnesota, have, during the past six months,
shown little or no interest in the organization known as the
MWAAC. Former leaders in the women's liberation movement

i have become aware of the SWP influence among the leaders of

j the group, and have adopted a hands off policy from active
participation in the affairs of this group. While the

. May 6, 1972, rally in St. Paul, Minnesota, was attended by
some 200 individuals, their attendance was considered to be
due to individual interest in the abortion issue.

MP T-2 on
August 17, 1972

‘SWP_ INFLUENCE

The MWAAC is not a committee of the TCB-SWP, nor
is it a part of the YSA-TCG. Women's liberation is a topic
of general interest and concern to the membership of the
TCB-SWP, and the anti-abortion standard taken by MWAAC is
one aspect of the women's liberation movement of continued
interest.

_ ACTION COALITION

. Members of the YSA-TCG have in the past, ieupieseed
interest in the support of women's liberation as a matter of
policy. The anti-abortion, or so called legal abortion
movement, is one aspect of this women's liberation movement
which continues to be of concern to members of the YSA-TCG,
both male and female. While the vast majority of women in
the State of Minnesota support either the repeal or changes
in present state laws on abortion, supporters of this repeal
or change also include professional women, medical doctors,
lawyers, municipal court judges, and individuals from all
walks of life.

in New York City (NYC), details of which will be set out”
Aiaaikead fully hereinafter.

As “the youth organization of the’
SWP, the YSA serves as the main
source of recruitment into that
organization. The YSA is described
in the masthead of its official
publication, "The Young Socialist
Organizer", as "a Multi-National
Revolutionary Socialist Youth
Organization".

The SWP has been designated pur-
suant to Executive Order 10450.

I. ORGANIZATIONAL DATA

A. Origin and Scope

NY T-2 on July 21, 1971, and NY T-3 on October 1,
1971, furnished information that over 1,000 women met in
conference at Columbia University, NYC, NY, on July 16;
1971, through July 18, 1971, to form a National Movement
of independent groups scattered throughout the United
States (US) who favored and had worked to legalize abortion.
As a result of this conference, WONAAC was founded.

B. Aims and Purposes

In the WONAAC national newsletter, dated September 16,
1971, WONAAC was self-described as a nationally coordina-
ted abortion law repeal campaign including legislation;
legal action, and nationally coordinated mass demonstrations
in Washington, DC, and San Francisco, on November 20, 1971,
for the repeal of all anti-abortion laws and corollary
demands of no forced sterilization, and the repeal of all
restrictive contraception laws. WONAAC claims to reach
all women, black; Chinaca; Latina; Asian; Puerto Rican;
native American women; campus women; gay women; high
school women; housewives; professional, welfare, and
working women; young women; women from churches, political
organizations, trade unions, the military, and communities

: Cc. Headquarters

- On November 22, 1972, a Special agent (SA) of
thé Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), utilizing a
pretext, contacted an individual self-identified as CAROL
EATON at telephone number 675-9150, located at 150 5th .
Avenue, NYC, NY. EATON, who stated she is currently a
National Staff member of WONAAC, advised that the National
and NY Staffs of- WONAAC are headquartered at this address.

D. When 1 Meetings Held

7 According to CAROL EATON, regular NY Coalition
meetings of WONAAC are held every other Wednesday evening
at Religious Center at New York University, 2 Washington
Square North, NYC, NY. EATON stated that most NY State
staff members are present at these meetings and at least
one or more National Staff members also try to be in
attendance. Other than this, state and national staffs
meet periodically, as business demands.

E. Officers

EATON identified the following individuals as

NY a

EF Menbership and Finances

i ‘According to EATON, “WONAAC does not maintain a
formal membership, as such, and financially exists only:
through voluntary contributions. She stated that all
staff members, National and NY State, serve on a voluntary
basis, receive no salary, and get only a small "subsistance

. allowance" which the staff has found necessary to supplement
with heen own personal funds in order to get by...

‘Gs_wonaac Affiliates

CAROL EATON stated there are Geauenttg 36 WONAAC
affiliates, also called "coalitions" throughout the US, and
that most states of the union are represented by an affiliate
or coalition. .

Ii. YSA-SWP INFLUENCE AND CONTROL
OVER WONAAC

NY T-1 provided information on July 22,.1971,
that the First National Womens Abortion Conference was
held at Columbia University, NYC, NY, from July 16, 1971,-
to July 18, 1971, which resulted in the founding of WONAAC.
NY T-1 stated that it was immediately apparent that this
conference was taken over and influenced by YSA-SWP members
who infiltrated the various conference committees and
workshops which were established to help formulate the
main direction the Coalition would follow in the future.
NY T-1 stated that it seemed certain the YSA-SWP would,
in the future, dictate policy for this organization and
eueaee fe able _to control the utilization of WONAAC funds.

on August 5, 1971, NY T-4 provided a leaflet
captioned, “What Every Woman Should Know". This leaflet,
which was published by Feminist Organization for Communi-
cation; Action and Service (F.O.C.A.S.), related the following:

"The Womens National Abortion Coalition has
been called and organized by the SWP and its affiliate,
the YSA, including women supposedly representing Women's
Liberation groups, who in truth represent, first, the

We

NW 68262 Docld:32989545 Page 447



NY 100-174481'

.SWP and YSA. These women attach more importance to their
political movement than.to the Women's Liberation Movement.
And when 77% of the women in this country are for reform
of abortion laws, there is fertile soil for a political: .
party to build itself on. The inihirniess realizes this and

} is taking advantage of it.” _

On August 5; re a leafiet
captioned "B, 0.C.A.S." revealed eee
in part as follows: peeee!

|
I Foo "A nucleus of about eight feminists
l sal have formed FOCAS, Feminist
Organization for Communication,
7 a Action and Service. FOCAS evolved
\ a 5 from the Women's Strike Coalition
{PERE ‘ (WSC), which the Socialist Workers
Party abruptly abandoned on May
i 25th in order to form the committee
: for WONAAC. Since that time a
nucleus of women from WSC together
with like-minded feminists pre-
served the WSC in order to main-
tain and expand a multi-~issue
action-oriented Women's Libera~
tion coalition in the NYC area.
Assisted by loans from supporting
feminists, the new WSC paid.
back nearly a thousand of the
three thousand dollars of debts
incurred by the SWP women who
had controlled the old WSC.

The "Militant" issue of August 6, 1971, page five;
in an article entitled, "Abortion Campaign Counters Red-
Baiting", revealed in part, with respect to the founding
WONAAC conference in July, 1971:

"The Militant" is a weekly news-
paper of the SWP.

NW 68262 Docld:32989545 Page 448



“There were many members of the SWP and YSA at the
conference, and SWPers and YSAers are among those who
havé worked most consistently for abortion repeal and to
build the abortion conference...."

NY T-5 advised on November 12, “1971, that a NY
Planiig Meeting of WONAAC was held at LOEB Student Center,
NY University, NY, on November 11, 1971, to lay plans
for a scheduled November 20, 1971 demonstration in Washington,
DC. According to this source, this meeting was completely
dominated and controlled by members of the SWP.

NY T-6 related on November 16, 1971, that the Upper
West Side Branch of the YSA planned to send a contingent
of its members to Washington, DC, on November 20, 1971,
in order to participate in the planned demonstration there
on that Gates

Ny T-6 stated ‘that practically all the members of the
uptown branch of the YSA, NY, were expected to participate
in this activity.

NY P-5 related on January 20, 1972, that the scheduled
November 20, 1971 march in Washington was "orucial" to
all SWP and YSA branches in that .it afforded an opportunity
for selling of "The Militant" and other SWP/YSA literature,
and also afforded an opportunity for “intervening " in the
action via distribution of SWP Election Campaign literature.

. NY T-8 on February 11, 1972, and NY T-9 and NY T-10
on February 14, 1972, provided information that a WONAAC
convention was held February 11, 1972, to February 13, 1972,
.at Hayden Hall, Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts.

The general theme of this convention was "How to Win
Abortion Law Repeal". NY T-8 stated that approximately

30 members of the YSA or SWP Boston Chapters were oem
in attendance at this convention.

NY T-7 related on February 14, 1972, that because of the
_ de-escalation of the Vietnam War by the NIXON Administration,
the YSa-New York Local (NYL), while continuing on with
anti-war work through the NY Student Mobilization

NW 68262 Doeld:32989545 Page 449



NY 100-174481 |

Committee (SMC) and N¥ National Peace Action Coalition
(NPAC), both of which organizations they dominate, would
also concentrate in the area of the Women's Liberation
Movement through their influence in WONAAC,

The SMC is controlled by the
SWP and its youth affiliate,
YSA. SMC initiates and supports
public demonstrations against
the war in Southeast Asia.

NPAC was founded in 1970 by
members of the SWP. Its objec-
tive is the immediate, total
and unconditional withdrawal
of all US forces and material
in Southeast Asia.

. NY T-7 advised on various dates, March 23, 1972,
through October 17, 1972, that activities’ of WONAAC were
dutifully reported and included on the agenda at regular
meetings of the Upper West Side Branch, YSA-New York Local
(NYL) during that period.

ot NY T-5 advised on April 18, 1972, that the leader-
ship of WONAAC was then dominated by the SWP.

NY T-7 related on July 7, 1972, that at a WONAAC
meeting held June 27, 1972, at 706 Broadway, NYC, NY,
starting at 6:40 PM, it was announced that even though
WONAAC previously had accused various female activists
working along with them in the Women's Liberation struggle
of red baiting because of the stand they had taken against
the SWP~Young Socialist Alliance (YSA), at present they
are forced to work with these individuals to help strengthen
the WONAAC cause.

At this meeting, certain WONAAC staff members
walked out and voiced their disapproval of the meeting i
being taken over by a majority of SWP-YSA members.
They indicated that the SWP-YSA has no right to be in a
policy-making position in WONAAC.

NW 68262 Docld:32989545 Page 450



NY 100-174481 © - \

NY T-7 on-July 18, 1972, and NY T-11 on July 19,
1972, provided information that a WONAAC conference was
held at Hunter College, Park Avenue and 69th Street on
vahy 15, 1972° and July 16, 1972.
NY T-7 stated that NYC was pickea as the site of
this convention because this city is considered to be
the center of the most powerful anti- ~abortion effort so far.
a Discussionsheld at this conference centered on
plans for (one)~future activity in the campaign to repeal
all anti-abortion and contraception laws and (two)-to
end forced sterilization.

’ A discussion was held concerning the attacks
being made by the Catholic Church Hierarchy and other _
anti-abortion groups against women's rights to their own
bodies.

: NY T-11 related that the evening plenary session
of WONAAC occurred on July 15, 1972, and it was immediately
apparent that the SWP-YSA groups dominated the meeting.
Independent women who wanted to make statements during
this session were voted down by SWP ‘floor leaders and
these same persons continued to vote as a block on all
issues.

The group of independent women from various
geographic areas, that is, those women who were not
associated with the SWP or YSA, went together after the
plenary session was adjourned and considered the problem

_ .0£ how to handle the SWP leaders. While these women
‘were not political realists in their goals, they did
believe in working throughout the existing system rather
than functioning with the SWP in their eventual goal of
revolution.

It was decided that the independent feminists
would no longer continue hassling within WONAAC. They
did not want to have decisions for them being structured
by a'male dominated group. They also decided that noney
being collected by WONAAC in the name of abortion law

Leaner,

NY 100-174481

change was not being used for that purpose, but rather
to sustain members of the SWP-YSA.

The Sunday morhing session, July 16, 1972, was
labeled "Meeting to Discuss Internal Hassles." About 35
independents attended and a few number of SWP~YSA members
and sympathizers were present. Independents. there were
from New Haven, Boston, Detroit, New York (NY), Chicago,
Philadelphia, and San Francisco.

The independents did not waiver in their firm
opposition to SWP-YSA control of WONAAC. Six national
coordinators of WONAAC were independents and decided to
resign publicly at the afternoon plenary session. They
also decided to combat SWP control of the feminist move-
ment through the various publications.

3 There were approximately 700-800 women in atten~
cy dance at the afternoon session. According to one of the

3 SWP leaders, these women were from 31 states and three

3 couritries-Canada, Italy and Sweden. The states that had
AR, more representation than others were Ohio, Illinois, New

York and Massachusetts.

Most of the problems and differences between the
independents and the SWP centered around approaches to
abortion law reform. The SWP was charged with always
having demonstrations and rallies and never doing any
work through the legislative process.

The independents stated that they were tired of
this hassle and that they believed there were more ef-
fective ways to change abortion laws ba carrying placards

in the streets.

wary LINDAWENNESS made a final ples t5F the indepen-

from WONAAC has debilitated the organization and most
independent, representatives will be going back to their

own cities to work for abortion Law change in organizations
which have no connection with the SWP.

The concern still exists, however, that WONAAC will
be able to collect monies in the name of abortion reform
and there is also the concern that women new to the move-
ment will join in a mistaken notion that they will be™
anand abortion law reform.

Independents vowed before leaving 1 NY that they
would try to publicize activities from the SWP in an
effort to prevent this.

Tift. OBSERVATION OF CURRENT NATIONAL
STAFF MEMBER REGARDING YSA/SWP INFLUENCE

When contacted under pretext on November 24,
1972, CAROL EATON, self-identified as a current National
Staff member, and previously mentioned in this report,
related that she has been active in WONAAC since its
inception. BATON, while 4¥°TF409 she is definitely not a
YSA, SWP, or member of any “radical group", acknowledged
there always have been SWP, YSA and “radical" elements
in WONAAC. She went on to state, however, that WONAAC
has never allied itself politically with any organization
or individual, including any of the political candidates
in the recent political election and, despite its diverse
makeup as too ideaological beliefs of its membership,
WONAAC is basically an organization which strives only
to the objectives for which it was originally founded.
To this end, she went on, WONAAC would accept help from
whatever source offered.

the past with regard to friction within WONAAC about SWP

EATON. admitted there were some problems in

and YSA influence. She stated, however, this matter, to
her observation, never seemed a serious’one, and is quite.
minimal today. With regard to the "walk out" of six :
national coordinators at the July, 1972 conference in NYC,
she stated the walk out did not occur, in fact, because.

of the SWP/YSA influence question, but rather because
those who walked out believed WONAAC should be a “referral
agency", while those who stayed felt it should not. By :
referral agency, EATON statedshe means an agency which would refer
callers tq a specific location or place where abortions

could be obtained:

Iv. PLANNED PROJECTS.

CAROL EATON advised that WONAAC plans an inter-
national Tribunal march to be held in NYC, NY, from March 9, .
1972, to March 11, 1972. She stated plans have not yet been
finalized, including the exact location or site this event
will take place. However, she noted that SIMOW! EAUVOIR,
a Parisian, well known in the Women's Liberati Movement,
would be honorary chairwoman.

WOMEN'S NATIONAL ABORTION
ACTION COALITION (WONAAC)

During the latter part of February, 1973, a confidential
source, who has furnished reliable information in the past,
advised that the Washington, D.C. (WDC) Chapter of the Women's
National Abortion Action Coalition (D.C. WONAAC) is scheduled
to participate in an "International Woman's Day Solidarity
Meeting" scheduled to be held in New York City, New York on
Saturday, March 10, 1973, place to be announced.

The national office of WONAAC is located at
150 Fifth Avenue, New York City, New York.
WONAAC goals are self~defined as "working
on a national scale to make abortion legal,
to end restrictive contraception laws, and
to end forced sterilization."

According to the above source, a flyer distributed
by D.C. WONAAC disclosed that among those individuals
scheduled to speak at the meeting are; GISELE HALIMI, described
as a leader of "Choisir," a French abortion rights organization;
MICHELE CHEVALIER, described as a defendent in a French abortion
trial; and CLAUDE SERVAN SCHREIBER, described as a feminist
journalist and as a leader of "Choisir".

According to the above source, members of the
i WDC Locals of the Young Socialist Alliance (YSA) and the
I Socialist Workers Party (SWP) have been urged to participate
in the International Womans Day Solidarity Meeting. 1

i As the youth organization of the SWP, the

\ YSA serves as the main source of recruitment
into that organization. The YSA is
described in the masthead of its official
publication "The Young Socialist Organizer",
as "A multinational revolutionary socialist
youth organization."

The SWP has been designated pursuant to
. Executive Order 10450.

00: NEW YORE

RePHlet 2/28/73,

The Women's National Abortion Action Coalition (WONAAC)
has been the subject of a separate investigation by the Bureau
in numerous offices, In referenced letter, Philadelphia pointed
out that WONAAC represents 2 basic social change dealing with
abortion rights and that in view of the fact the U.S, Supreme
Court upheid the right of abortion, the continued investigation
of WONAAC at this time dees not appear to be desirable and
should be discontinued, Philadelphia also suggested that
continued investigation of the Socialist Workers Party (SWP)
and its youth group, the Young Sccialist Alliance (YSA), should
determine pertinent activities of WONAAC.

After careful consideration of this matter, the Bureau
agrees with the chservations of the Philadelphia Office that the
investigation of WONAAC showid be discontinued, However, in view
of the fact that WONAAC is dominated and controlled by the SWP, a
Trotskyist communist organization cited by the Attorney General
pursuant to Executive Order 10450, it is the responsibility of the
Bureau to investigate and report pertinent information relating
to the extent of SWP domination and control of “captioned
organization.

Therefore, recipients should close separate
wy investigations concerning WONAAC. In the future, report above-
described information regarding WONAAC under appropriate subheading
in the SWP semiannual organizational reports,

(TROTSKYIST)

Re Philadelphia letter to Bureau dated 1/31/73-
and Bureau letter to Philadelphia dated 2/12/73. 7

For the information of New York, referenced Bureau
letter to Philadelphia dated 2/12/73 authorized a continued
investigation of WONAAC utilizing only established sources,

. The Bureau further advised that the investigation was to be,
conducted in a most discreet manner and that no action was

to be taken which could in any way be construed as infringement
*.: by the FBI on academic freedom at the University of Pennsylvania,

The case file of captioned organization has be

& ,, °, reviewed as well as all indices references to captioned
wey organization and it has been determined that while some o:
.\' ° the individuals associated with WONAAC in the Philadelphia

area are also known to be affiliated with the Socialist

ie Workers Party (SWP) and for the Young Socialist Alliance |
(YSA), the majority of WONAAC supporters appear to be \

» individuals interested in,social change rather than revolu-

x tionary political chaaga i Ss

In view of the fact BEE WONAAC represents basically
a social change vehicle dealing with the single issue of
abortion rights and the fact that a recent U. S. Supreme
Court decision upheld the right to abortion, thereby reducing
the political value of this issue, it would appear that a
—paoutimied investigation of WONAAC at this time is not
desirable.

Therefore, it is recommended that this investi-

The Minnesota Supreme Court on 2/2/73 declared the
state's abortion law unconstitutional in its entirety
based on the 1/22/73 decision of the U.S, Supreme Court
wherein it was ruled that the states cannot prohibit abortions
during the first six months of pregnancy.

The decision of the Minnesota Supreme Ccurtlas
resulted in several Twin Cities area hospitals in Minneapolis \,
and St. Paul, Minnesota, offering facilities and providing (P
necessary procedures for staff members to perform abortions \
under these court rulings. i

in the past, S “advised that the object of the captioned
group was to remove anti-abortion laws from the books in the
state of Minnesota, as well as in the United States.

On 2/16/73 this source further related that the
Women's Liberation Movement supporters in the Twin Cities
area have generally reacted favorably to the court decisions
relating to abortion laws and now that the principal object
of the Minnesota Abortion Action Coalition has been achieved,

your request was not submitted.to the Bureau until 1/31/73,

TO ALL AMERICAN WOMEN,

Iam proud of the fact that my first vote cast in Congress
was a vote against war. It was the first opportunity for a
woman to vote because I was the first woman to be elected
to Congress,

I believed then as I do today that women are the ones who
must be concerned with the needs and development of the
human race, I have always fought for the dignity of all
human beings -- for those of the present as well as those
of future generations.

I will continue to struggle as long as I live.

I hope all women will respond to the following CALL,. and

Dear WSPER:

Momen Strike for Peace nationally is supporting the Jeannette Rankin Brigade.
Pleneloais, trainloads and carloads of women will be coming into Washington on Mon~
day, January 15th, from all over the country.

Ye are particularly pleased with this action because it represents for the first

time a real coalition of womén's peace groups, church groups, theatre personalities, .
and community leaders.

The Day is envisioned as a solem, dignified confrontation of those who should be
representing the ever growing opposition to the war. We ask that you write your Con-
gressmen urging that they support the four points listed in the enclosed Call as Con-
gress reconvenes, Later in the afternoon at our Women's Congress we want to be able to \
revort on Congressional responses,

\

We will all meet at Union Station in Washington at 11:30 4M and slowly walk to the
Sapitol. We ask the women to wear black. We will be led by Jeannette Rankin who will
oroceed to the top of the Capitol steps with a representative delegation of 50 women to
tresent our petition to the two men who represent the whole of Congress, Senator Mike
Snsfield and Speaker of the House McCormack. The delegation will read the demands be- _
‘ore the assembled women and the two Congressmen, Leaving the Hill, the women will enter
uses for a motorcade to a Congress of American Yomen (place to be ” announced). . Women
ill present an analysis of the current crisis on the war front and the domestic front,

.eeding to suggestions for program and actions to be taken back tase our communities for im
Hementation.

Women may choose to remain in va shington the next day to meet with their Congressmen.
£ you wish to stay and wish help in securing accommodations, contact the Hospitality Com
ittee, 2140 P. St. N.W . Washington, DC (293-2020). We regret thet in order to get the
owest train fare we had to guarantee return the § same day; therefore you would have to
inance your own trip back on the 16th,

Our hope is that 10, 000 women will converge upon Washington. We urge you to parti-
ipate.

Yours for Peace,

WASHINGTON, D, C., JANUARY 8, 1968 -
fe JEANNETTE RANKEN BRIGADE

Information was developed that in late fall of 1967

“an organization known as the Jeannette Ranken Brigade had sent
out a call for a demonstration to be held at the White House in
Washington, D,..C,, on-January 8, 1968, in protest of the War in

Vietnam, tg

the Chairman of this Brigade, is
s'a former member of Congress from the State

86 years old angi
of Montana, She first went to Congress in 1917.

The December 14, 1967 issue of the "St. Louis Post~

Dispatch", a daily St. Louis newspaper,

in an article on

Page 10C, stated that Jeannette Ranken was planning a massive
Vietnam peace project by women who would converge on Congress

in January, 1968,

She is elsewhere quoted to have said, "Tes

thousand women have sat back and let their sons be killed in

Vietnam, If we had ten thousand women willing to go te jail
if necessary we could stop the war in Vietnam, You cannot kev
wars without women," She has stated that she is willing 1.

stay in jail until the bombing in Vietnam is stopped.

Source One advised on January 6, 1968, that the

the

St. Louis Peace Information Center, at 6217 Delmar, has been

active in organizing interest in the Jeannette Ranken demousts

It was announced that the date for the demonstration at Wes

JEANNETTE RANKIN

Helena, Montana

November 27, 1967

TO ALL AMERICAN WOMEN:

I am proud of the fact that my first vote cast in Congress ’
was a vote against the war. It was the first opportunity
fox a woman to vote, because I was the first woman to be
elected to Congress. 7

I believed then, as I do today, that women are the ones that
must be concerned with the needs and development of the
human race. I have always fought for the dignity, of all
human beings - for those of the present as well as those

of future generations.

I will continue to struggle as long as I live. I hope all
women will respond to the following call and join’me in

Washington on January 15, 1968, the opening day of Congress.

With highest hopes,

JEANNETTE RANKIN

the Jeannette Rankin/prigade (SRB) had been formed’ primatily

by members of Women ‘Strike for Peace, a pacifist organization,

Members of Women Strike for Peace had formed the organization

following a statement made by former Congresswoman Jeannette
HK Rankin of Montana, in which she stated that if 10, 000 American

Housewives were willing to be arrested, they could stop

the war in Vietnam, According to the source, the JRB was

formed as a "one shot organization" to sponsor a demonstration

in Washington, D.C., when Congress reconvenes.in 1968,

The same Source advised that January 15, 1968,
had been established as the date of the above demonstration
in view of the fact that Congress was reconvening on that
date. The source stated that the headquarters of the JRB
was located in New York City and that officials there and

, in other large United States cities including Los Angeles,
San Francisco and Washington, D,.C., were formulating the
plans for a "march on the United States Capitol" where
the women would present to the United States Congress a
petition demanding that the Congressmen end the war in
Vietnam, The source stated that a small minority in the
above organization were in favor of commiting acts of civil
disobedience and being arrested. but the vast majority of
the organization wanted a peaceful demonstration to again
focus the Congressional attention upon the war in Vietnam,

The same source advised in January, 1968, that
representatives of the JRB met with officials of the United
States Capitol Police on sevdral occasions and attempted
to gain permission to assemble on the steps of the United

Memorandum to Mr. W,C, Sullivan
RE: JEANNETTE RANKIN BRIGADE

This petition was read to the demonstrators
assembled at Union Square by Swedish film actress, Viveca

were bussed to the Shoreham Hotel where they convened a
congress of American women from approximately 2:30 p.m, to
5:40 p.m,

use all of their power to stop the war in Vietnam, She
described present challenges as "militarism, racialism and
wantonism.

Jeannette Rankin welcomed the participants and stated
women must see that the military system is destroyed. She
recommended that women everywhere become candidates for political
offices, Mrs. Dagmar Wilson, Chairman of the Women Strike for
Peace, a national pacifist group, spoke concerning United States
policy in Vietnam. She stressed the need for education in order
to change: United States policy and stated that their demonstra-
tion was the beginning of a revolution.

While this assembly was taking place a small group
calling themselves Radical Womens Group met in a room across the
hall, This group was very disorganized and was held without
apparent objective.

JANUARY 8, 1968

INFORMATION CONCERNING

The "Kansas City Star" newspaper, Kansas City,
Missouri, edition of January 14, 1968, contained an article
stating that Kansas City women were responding to a “woman
power" appeal issued by Miss Jeanette Rankin, former member
of Congress, to end the war in Vietnam. According to the
article, a small delegation of Kansas City women plan to go
to Washington, D. C., on January 15, 1968, to participate in
the march by the "Jeanette Rankin Brigade" to petition Congress
for a United States withdrawal from Vietnam. The others in
the group would remain in Kansas City and present copies of
the petition to the offices of U. S. Representatives Richard
Bolling, Kansas City, Missouri, and Larry Winn, Kansas City,
Kansas, at 1:00 p.m., on January 15, 1968.

The "Kansas City Star" evening edition of January
15, 1968, carried an article stating that on the afternoon
of January 15, 1968, 20 women appeared at the offices of
Representatives Bolling and Winn. They carried no signs
and the demonstration was orderly. The women, all from the
greater Kansas City area, merely presented a petition asking
Congress to end the war in Vietnam and withdraw American
troops, to make reparations for the "ravaged land we leave
behind in Vietnam", and to listen to the American people
and refuse "the insatiable demands of the military~industrial
complex". The article stated that the Kansas City branch of
the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom
had been planning to send representatives to the Washington
march, but it was not until Wednesday that they decided to
present the petitions to Congressmen Winn and Bolling.

According to the article, Mrs. John M.“Swomley , Ure, i?
Program Chairman of the organization, stated the Kansas City _
group hoped to identify with the women in Washington and their
objective to bring and end to the war in Vietnam. weet

SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA
JANUARY 15, 1968

Chairman of the Brigade, announced to the demonstrators that this
Jocal demonstration was principally gathered to support women
from around the United States who were gathered in Washington,
D.C. today, as part of a nation-wide demonstration sponsored by
the Jeannette Rankin Brigade, to petition Congress to resolve
the conflict in Vietnam. Bridges stated that inasmuch as it
was not possible for the demonstrators to personally contact
their congressmen, most of whom were out of town; that following
the presentation of a petition to Mayor Joseph Alioto, the
demonstrators would then proceed to the Western Union Office on
10th and Market Streets in San Francisco, so that the women
protestors could send wires to their congressmen, protesting
United States policies in Vietnam. Bridges indicated that the
petitioners would request Mayor Alioto to convey to Congress
their petition, which among other things urged Congress, as its
first order of business, to resolve to end the War in Vietnam and
immediately arrange for withdrawal of all American troops from
Vietnam; for Congress to use its power to heal the sick society
at home and to make reparations for the ravaged lands left
behind in Vietnam,

A source advised March 2, 1967, that Mrs. H.
Bridges, also known as Nikki Bridges, 35
Kronquest Court, San Francisco, California, was
listed as a recipient of a new yearly subscription
to the "People’s World" (PW), expiration date:
March 4, 1968.

The PW is a west coast communist newspaper,
published weekly in San Francisco.

The next speaker was identified as Ailee fernandez.
She spoke for approximately five minutes and briefiy~explainied
to the demonstrators who Jeannette Rankin is and what the purposes
of the Jeannette Rankin Brigade are, She stated that the group
has no principal spokesman and it is principally a group of
women who are involved and committed in a fight for peace.

Several of the demonstrators, led by Nikki Bridges,
then proceeded to the Office of Mayor Joseph Alioto to present
their petition.

SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA
JANUARY 15, 1968

Approximately ten minutes later the Mayor of
San Francisco appeared on the steps of the City Hall and announced
to the demonstrators that he would gladly transmit their
petition to Congress. .Mayor Alioto stated that he fully
believed in the constitutional right of peaceful assembly.
He indicated, however, that because he had consented to
transmit the demonstrators' petition to Washington, he did not
necessarily agree with it. The Mayor then stated that it
was his personal opinion that the United States Government and
the Johnson Administration had done all in its power. to attempt
to come to a peaceful and honorable solution in the Vietnamese
War. He related that he felt that it was now up to the other
side to make the same attempts to arrive at a peaceful solution
in the Vietnamese conflict.

At approximately 12:45 p.m., the demonstrators proceeded”
to the Western Union Office located at 10th and Market Streets
in San Francisco, so that wires could be sent to their congressmen
in Washington.

A Special Agent of the FBI observed one _biaine
Yoneda. participating in the above demonstration and following
the demonstration Yoneda was observed to return to her employment
at the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union
(ILWU) - Pacific Maritime Association, Pension Fund, at 150
Golden Gate Avenue,’ San Francisco.

A second source advised on December 4, 1967, that
Elaine Yoneda is a current and active member of the Communist
Party (CP). _ Peer

On January 15, 1968, a Special Agent of the FBI
observed a silent protest by a group of women on the lawn
of Colton Hall, Monterey, California, between 3:00 and 5:00 p.m.
These women were ostensibly gathered to support the demonstration
being held in Washington, D.C., sponsored by the Jeannette Rankin
Brigade. There were no speeches given; the demonstrators merely
conducted a silent vigil.

A one page leaflet captioned "Women To Take First
Step to End The War" printed by the Jeannette Rankin Brigade,
at 150 Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco, California, was handed
out at the above demonstration. A Xeroxed duplication of this

leaflet is appended to this memorandum. \

At 10:50 AM, the women marched to the steps on the
First Street side of the Los Angeles City Hall for a second
rally. A count made as the demonstrators marched between the
Old State Building and the City Hall revealed that 250
adult Caucasians (majority of whom were women dressed in -
black), and eight non-Caucasian adults were involved, plus
some younesters and infants. The motner of one of the children
had a cardboard sign, depicting a bomb and the caption, "I'm
Glad I'm Not Vietnamese", strapped to the back of her son who
appeared to be less than four years of age. .

: isSons again acting as mistress of / ke
ceremonies, 3 addressed by Charlotte Shernan, iveuahe
Margaret Wright, Tima Tomash, and Jill}-Schary. The latter --~-
was introduced as a radio commentator emoloyed by Los Angeles
Radio Station KLAC. She joined the others in calling for a
coalition of women to influence legislation and bring an end to
thé war in Vietnam. She also called for support of other “liberal
radio broadcasters on our side", one of whom she named as

William Winter, (The"Daily People's World", west coast

communist newspaper, in its edition of June 11, 1946, described
William Winter as chairman of a local citizens! committee ‘to
safeguard the Joint Anti-Fascist Refuge Committee, which
organization has been cited pursuant to Executive Order 10450). .

omarlotee Shernen was introduced as the wife of

- Laurence Sherman, it being pointed out that he was an-~

unsuccessful candidate for public office, on a peace slate,
during 1967, but that both he and his wife were continuing the
fight for an end to the war in Vietnam, She said, "It is tine
for us to re-examine our role. as women. Women are a vehicle
for giving life. We will not be a vehicle for perpetuation

of wars", She then read some anti-war quotes from Henry David
Thoreau, indicating they were as timely today, as when he wrote
them. : '

Margaret Wright stated that wheres: the majority of
women in the demonstration were wearing black to denote mourning,
that she and her non-Caucasian associates who feel, "Black is
peautiful" were dressed in white to indicate their attitude of
mourning. She called for the elimination of ROTC (Reserve
Officers Training Corps) from local high schools and junior
colleges, adding, "Tney have got to get live bullets out of the
schools, and get some live teachers in." She repeated these
same statements during the afternoon wnen the JRB moved t
the Los Angeles City Board of Education. Scot

As the rally was breaking uo, Wright grabbed the :
public address system and said that it had been learned that
the City Council was in session inside the City Hall Building.

a

She urged the women not to.disperse, but to join her and. -

others in invading the City Council Chambers with a demand

that the JRB be allowed to speak to the Council even though

they had not made previous arrangements for a place. on the

agenda that day. Some of the women were already out of range

of the public address system and did not hear this announcement
j by Wright, having already been dismissed by. Sissons and told to
4 reconvene at the Board of Education following Luncheon.

Approximately 200 of the demonstrators did enter
the Council Chambers. They got word to the councilmen, through
one of the staff members, ‘that they wished to be heard.

A motion to allow a JRB representative to address them was

put before the Council, and defeated by a vote of six to five.
Immediately following this vote, there was a unanimous vote
that the Council adjourn. As the councilmen filed out of the
room, Tima Tomash rushed to.the front shouting demands that
they return, while other of the women hissed and booed the
city legislators. :

During the noon hour some of the women distributed -
leaflets in the City Hall and on the surrounding streets: in
the downtown Civic Center.

At 1:00 PM, the wonlén, whose numbers had by that
time been reduced to 125, massed in the patio of the. Los
Angeles City Board of Education, 450 North Grand Avenue,

Los Angeles.. Sissons, Wright. and Tomash addressed-the --- -.-~
assembled demonstrators, pointing out that money spent in
Vietnam could be better spent in education. Wright claimed
that many of the so-called student "drop-outs" are in reality
"push-outs", claiming that she herself was one of the latter.
She said, "Ye need Dooks, not bombs. We know this is a racist
war and we blacks are.not going to fight a racist war". ‘She BEEP
indicated ‘that rather than-fight overseas,.the black people

es ode ae ae AAdband tata sonnst tines sisudiaitead

would remain at home and fight the racists She also said,
"Just because I'm pro~black doesn't necessarily mean I'm anti-.
white." :

Wright said, "I'm not political, but I am honest. I
can't honestly get up and say the pledge of allegiance to the
American flag, because I really don't have liberty and justices
so I just get up and stand and won't repeat the pledge.

Later, whén she observed a photograph of President Johnson
hanging from a wall in the Administration Building at the
Los Angeles City Board of Education, she told the JRB women
with her, ,"We shouldn't nave to look at such pornographic
pictures. —

sapeat Wright said that her arrest at the hands of Los
Angeles City Eoncol Security Officers, during the recent.
Manual Arts High School disturbance, had at least one bright
‘result. She said that at the time of her arrest it had been
necessary for the arresting officers to drag her down the
hall as she was too heavy for then to carry. Then she added

- that the next time she is arrested the officers will not have
that excuse as she has lost thirty pounds in the meantime.

cb

The speeches in the patio ended at 1:30 PM and many
of the women left immediately. Seventy-eight women remained -
and attempted to enter a spécial committee meeting being attended
by some of the School Board members, They were informed by a
member of-the administrative staff-that the public meeting of the
School Board would not be held until 4:00 PM, the regularly
scheduled meeting time.. The women milled around in the hallway
outside the meeting room, until finally a staff member came out
and told them that two members'of the School Board, Reverend
James E. Jones and Dr, Julian. Nava, had agreed to grant them an
audience, The women were then ushered into the pubdlic board
room of the School Board where they waited until 2:00 PM at
which time the above-named Board members granted the demonstrators
a short audience and answered some questions put to them by the
women, One question, as to how much longer the members of the
School -Board were going to permit recruiters: from the armed -
forces to interview students at local- high schools and junior
colleges remained unanswered, but Dr. Nava pointed out to the
women that he had seen nothing wrong in entering the armed
H then he was 17 years
3 of age, and he could see nothing wrong in other young men who
wanted to do the same today. The demonstration was concluded
by 3:00 PM. There were no incidents and no arrests.’- ;

Educational Fund, Incorporated (SCEF) and stated-its purpose
to be to improve the educational and cultural standards of
the Southern people in accordance with the haghest
American democratic institutions, traditions and ideals.

The masthead of the April, 1967, issue of
"The Southern Patriot" indicates that it is the publication
of SCEF, editorial and business offices of which are
located at 3210 West Breadway, Louisvalle, Kentucky,
Eastern office of which is located at Suite 412, 799
Broadway, New York City. New York. "The Southern Patriot"
is published once each month, except Tuly. SCEF is stated
to be dedicated to ending discrimination based on race,
ereed, color, sex, national origin ox economic condition.

Carl Braden is identified as Executive Director
oi SCEF and Anne Braden as editor of ‘Ihe Southern Patriot."

Mrs. Alberta Ahearn, 2311 Payne Street, Louisville,
Kentucky, a self-admitted former member of the Communist
Party (CP), Louisville, Kentucky, testified on December 11,
and 13, 1954, in Jefferson County, Kentucky Criminal Court
in a State sedition prosecution égainst Carl James Braden.
She identified Carl Braden and his wife, Amne McCarty Braden,
as having been known to her as members of the CP from
January, 1951 to December, 1954. 7

The SCEF is self-described as having deep roots
in the South where it began as the educational wing of the

SCHW, organized in 1938 to work for economic and political
reform. When the SCHW disbanded im the late 1940's, SCEF

continued as an independent organization, rallying support
for integration and democracy and helping to stimulate

and nurture new movements of the early 1960's. The SCEF
maintained headquarters in Louisiana for twenty years, but
in 1966 moved its headquarters to Louisville, Kentucky.

A source advised on March 2, 1961, that Claude
Lightfoot, a Communist Party functionary, stated at a meeting
of the Communist Party in Baitimore, Maryland, on February 25,
1961, that the Communist Party is not connected with any
progressive movement but indirectly they do have -some influence
in the SCEF.

A second source, who is familiar with some phases
of Communist Party activity in the New Orleans area, advised
on June 3, 1966, that during the time that the SCHW was in
existence, members of the Communist Party were members of
and worked actively in the SCHW; however, since the formation
of the SCEF, Communist Party members have not been encouraged
to work in the SCEF. The source stated that the SCEF is
a progressive, liberal organization, which he considers a
Communist Party front organization because it has gone along
with the Communist Party on certain issues, particularly
on the racial issue.

A third source advised on May 25, 1965, that
George Meyers, a Communist Party functionary, expressed
great admiration for Carl and Anne Braden and the SCEF,
with which they are affiliated, and expressed the view
that the SCEF is the best organization in the South as far
as doing effective work is concerned and that they have a
better idea of what they are doing, where they are heading,
and influence other organizations for the better.

The second source also advised on June 3, 1966,

that many people who are officials and supporters of the
SCEF, while liberal in their views, are by no means Communists.

According to the article the women had a variety

Perhaps this will, As mothers, we have a special stake in this
war, Perhaps our effort Monday will somehow be translated
into a direst action to stop it."

According to the article, Lory/herson, Springfield,
Ohio, stated that while peace demonstrations were cfien most Ee
effective on a local level, sometimes a mass outpouring of

feeling like this is helpful,

According to the article Jung Zion, Bowling G

aes FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE

The April 6, 1960, edition of "The New York Times"
newspaper contained a full-page advertisement captioned

“What Is Really Happening In Cuba," placed by the Fair Play
for Cuba Committee (FPCC). This advertisement announced the
formation of the FPCC in New York City and declared the FPCC
intended to promulgate "the truth about revolutionary Cuba" to
neutralize the distorted American press,

"The New York Times" edition of January 11, 1961,
reported that at a hearing conducted before the United States
Senate Internal Security Subcommittee on January 10, 1961,

Dr. Charles A. Santos-Buch identified himself and Robert Taber
as organizers of the FPCC. He also testified he and Taber
obtained funds from the Cuban Government which were applied
toward the cost of the aforementioned advertisement.

On May 16, 1963, a source advised that during the
| first two years of the FPCC's existence there was a struggle
between Communist Party (CP) and Socialist Workers Party(SWP)
elements to exert their power within the FPCC and thereby
influence FPCC policy. This source added that during the past
year there had been a successful effort by FPCC leadership to
minimize the role of these and other organizations in the FPCC
so that their influence as of May, 1963, was neeligible.

The SWP has been designated, pursuant to Executive
Order 10450.

On May 20, 1963, a second source sivised that Vincent

"Tea" Lee, FPCC National Office Director, was then formulating
FPCC policy and had indicated that he had no intention of
permitting FPCC policy to be determined by any other organization,
This source stated that Lee believed that the ¥CC should. 7
advocate resumption of diplomatic relations between Cuba and

the United States and should support the ri t of
Cubans to manage their revolution without
other nations. Lez <id not advocate suppor
revolution per se.

the Cuban

The November 23, 1963, edition of "The New York Times"
reported that Sen Thomas J. Dodd of Connecticut had called
FPCC "the chief public relations instrument of the Castro network
in the United States." It is to be noted that Senator Dodd was

a member of the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee which

twice conducted hearings on the FPCC. a

‘TTTEE (CONT'D) i)

The December 27, 1963, edition of "The New York World

.egram and Sun" newspaper stated that the pro-Castro FPCC
was seeking to go out of business and that its prime activity
during its lifetime had been sponsorship of pro-Castro street
rallies and masspicket lines, and the direction of an active
propaganda mill highlighting illegal travel-to-Cuba campaigns.
Its comparatively brief span of life was attributed to mounting
anti-Castro American public opinion, the 1962 Congressional
hearings which disclosed FPCC financing by Castro's United
Natiors Delegation, and ultimately, the bad publicity which
the FPCC received from disclosure of activities on its behalf
by suspected presidential assassin Lee H. Oswald,

On February 6, 1964, the previously mentioned second
source advised that V. T, Lee had recently remarked that the
FPCC was dead and that there were no plans to organize another
simiiar organization. c 7

On April 13, 1964, a third source advised that there
had not been any FPCC activity in many months and that the
FPCC had been dissolved.

RE: DEMONSTRATION PROTESTING UNITED STATES POLICY
7 IN VIETNAM; WASHINGTON, D.C., JANUARY 15, 1968

TAIMI HALONEN and THORUN ROBEL were miidiy self-
eritical about not working for the programs the younger women
were promoting. TAIMI said she was tired after working long
hours on the Seattle conference to be held Saturday, January
20th at Mt. Zion Baptist Church in Seattle at which the
Seattle delegation would report. HALONEN made the observation,
however, that the women working on the program were all very
experienced leaders and she trusted they would formulate a
satisfactory program.

On Monday, January 15, 1968, the delegates including
the group from Washington State, met at the Union Station in
Washington, D.C. It was learned here that the instructions
which had been given the day before at the Shoreham Hotel were
evidently for the California group only, because many California
people had been badiy beaten in previous demonstrations and
they were very cautious and somewhat apprehensive. The
official pattern was different. Mimeographed sheets headed
"Jearrette Rankin Brigade - Information and Instructions" were
passed out and these appeared to be the official instructions.
A preduction is attached.

r.
aeezas The Washington State delegation was enlarged when a
Mrs, -SACKUP from Tacoma arrived. RADER said some of the money
usually received from wealthy Tpoanee oe lt had been collected

by Mrs. BACKUP. Reverend HAROL ‘ASS of Tacoma collected

$120.00, and wanted someone else to go instead of ZEFRA Sreeeerer

(STUDAMIRE). RADER defended herself when TAIMI HALONEN criticized

her for bringing ZEFRA along since ZEFRA is at least six months
pregnant.

After the demonstration, HEALY and RADER spent much
of the time urging the speakers to include in their talks some-
thing about the status of the American Indian. ELLA BAKE from

. New York did inciude a paragraph from the ‘paper the Washington.
State delegation submitted to Congress. This was entitled,
"American Indians and the Struggle for Peace". It had been
prepared by LONNIE HEALY aithough at its bottom it carried the
notation "(Prepared by the Jeannette Rankin Brigade Delegation
from Washington State)."

RADER,- HEALY, and CORR became indignant because the
audience did not give a standing ovation to Mrs. MARTIN L. KING,

Jr. or any of the Negro speakers.

HEALY expressed great dissatisfaction with the
basic organization of the gathering. She wanted an organi-
zational meeting instead of a raily type meeting which
occurred. HALONEN and ROBEL agreed somewhat. HEALY implied
the whole thing was a waste of her time.

In the workshop section of the meeting, HALONEN
worked in the legislative action section; HELEN FRENCH and
ELAINE HORSLEY in the electoral campaigns; and HEALY and
CORR in racism. Here, too, the younger women were very
critical. HEALY, particularly, resented having men as
"resource people” for the group. She said she thought this
was a women's congress. TAIMI said she found herself in a
situation that was quite different in that she was working
with a very broad spectrum of politically and economically oriented
individuals and it was a real learning experience... ELAINE
HORSLEY was anxious to get back home and work for peace while
the spirit of JEANNETTE RANKIN was still fresh. She and
HELEN FRENCH expressed the view the congress met the needs
of American women in giving a concrete program on which to work.

Tuesday,’ January 16, 1968, was for lobbying. The
Seattle and Tacoma people were told to meet at the Methodist
Building, 100 Maryland Avenue. HALONEN, ROBEL, HEALY, HORSLEY,
and HELEN FRENCH arrived before the appointed time. After about
an hour, EMELIA CASSIDY arrived stating RADER had an eye problem
and would be unable to attend. Mrs. BACKUP joined the group.
LINDA CORR and ZEFRA were too tired to get up so early. The
group called on Washington State's Senators JACKSON and MAGNUSON,
but they were not in their offices. After leaving a copy of
the women's petition and a questionnaire prepared by the
Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (see attachment)
they called on Washington State's Congressmen FLOYD HICKS and
BROCK ADAMC. Mr, HICKS was out of town. Mrs. HORSLEY knew the;

personnel. She asked that they relate to him that she was
vitally interested in peace and social justice.

Congressman BROCK ADAMS was in his office and spent
about twenty minutes talking with the group concerning his
political views and some of the political machinations of his
party. The group then began to disintegrate. ELAINE HORSLEY
left to get a 2:30 flight to Boston where she would visit her
son who is attending Harvard University.

After some sightseeing in the afternoon, HALONEN,
ROBEL, and Mrs, BACKUP checked into the Plaza Hotel since
they were going to stay a day om two .onger for some workshops.
RADER stayed also. The rest of the group, HEALY, CORR, ZEFRA
(STUDAMIRE), CASSIDY, and FRENCH wen: to Friendship Airport
and boarded UAL Flight 41 for Seattle.

While in Washington, HEALY kept trying to call a
CARL BLOICE who the source thought used to be either in Seattle
or San Francisco, but she never reached him.
The workshops held on January 15th after the march were:
(1) Legislative Action
(2) Electoral Campaign
(3) Press

(4) New Women in New World

(5) War at Home

(6) Resistance
(a) Action
(b) Draft

On January: 23, 1968, the fifth source advised a meeting
of the Trade Union CP Club was held at Tacoma, Washington, on
January 18, 1968, at which EMELIA CASSIDY, also known as MILLIE
CASSIDY, a member of that club, reported on her trip to Washington,
D.C. She stated she stayed at DONNA ALLEN's home there. She said
MARJORIE RADER got an eye infection which kept her from going to
the march. RADER remained at ALLEN's residence. She added

ZEFRA STUDAMIRE shouldn't have gone because she was uncooperative
and would not attend anything. She'was rude, said her bed was

too low and complained about the food. Some or all of these

troubles might be attributed to the fact STUDAMIRE is expecting
a baby in April. CASSIDY stated there were too many rules to
follow.

The delegates weren't premitted to carry a nail file,
wear peace buttons, or exhibit RANKIN buttons. They had to walk
six abreast and were not allowed to march around the White
House. She said a suit will be brought in court for this
denial of their raghts. She went on to state each person had
or was given $10.00 to carry on his person so he could not
be arrested for vagrancy.

CASSIDY said a nurse, Mrs. HELEN Mz (COOK, had been
very helpful to the group. COOK told CASSIDY ‘she could be reached
at 719 Beechwood Road, Media, Pennsylvania, if more information
is desired concerning Veterans for Peace, which was not further
described.

GUY RADER, a CP member at this meeting, tried to stop
CASSIDY when the latter complained ZEFRA STUDAMIRE was too
immature to have been sent to the conference, but CASSIDY wasn't
easy to stop. She was incensed over the fact money had been used
for STUDAMIRE's trip and the latter refused to cooperate. RADER
and STUDAMIRE remained in Washington, D.C. after the conference
to handle some business with the Student Non-Violent Coordinating -
Committee (SNCC) according to CASSIDY.

itself with racial matters in the United

A, DIAS AND THE STRUGGLE FC T

Teday, in hattle Cree:, Michigan, the city's seal, adopted in 1551,
it and violence because it pictures a white man hitting an «narmed
harif‘e bute. Some Indian youth view the television program

vuster’ as indicacive of racist America. The National Coniress of American
Tadians opposes cnis distortion of hiscory. Beatings and murder of Indians
1a iitine go unchallenged. Congress voted in 195 to open up Indian land
reservations to state jurisdiction. In actuality, this rides established
tribal courts and federal jurisdiction. It gives local bigoted authorities
more opportunity to harrass and open the way to termination of our treaties
and in several places resulted in actual loss of Land.

It is as deadly to be an Indian in America as it is to be a soldier
in Viet Nam. In the three years before 1997, more Indian children below the
age of 16 had died in this country than the 6,628 U. S. combat casualties of
the entire Viet Nam War (as of the end of 1966). Most of these were children
below the age of six.

The price we pay is the built-in racism our children are taught in
school, over television, in-cartoons; the Indian has become a joie, to white
Americans, We pay because we don't know our own history.

The thread of struggle for self-determination runs through the history
of Indian-Americans, When a few Indian youth speak of Red Power, the roots go
deep into their history in finding nourishment for this demand. Just as some
Negro leaders today speak of W.E.B, DuBois as having raised the same issue cf
identity long before the level of struggle, which is Black Power, arrived.
This struggle has gone on for 400 years.

The Indian people have been sendiny spokesmen to bring their grievances

“and their positions before the power structure of this country for two hundred

years. They have fought in the courts since at least 1330 when the case of
the Cherokee Nation vs. Georgia tested the ability and the willingness of the
United States to protect an Indian Tribe in its efforts at self-determination.

The Vietnamese war is 2 continuation of the whole racist war we have.
waged against the Indian People. Understanding this is a part of understanding
the Viet Nam var. We respond to what is happening to Vietnamese children, yet
the Indian people have suffered from the same policy of extermination and
destruction of their identity.

We must unite with ‘the strivings of those who have had to deal with
United States’ genocide for 200 years!

We can help to push the United States to ratify the United Nations
Resolution, "Treaty Against Genocide", that the United States should correct
the history and policy of genicide against the Indian people. Today this
refers to the destruction of their identity as'a people and line with the :
struggles of people for their identity all over the world. To stop the policy
of genocide, of raciam, to develop compensatory steps to undo the effects of
the crimes against the Indian people, to remove the oppression of the Indian ., |
people} ie S2eceunbeeabssese eyvalll sSuauausEauEce veeEEruee(L SCE! etal Beuteoe geecoeeen)

All the forces in this country cannot win democratic power without
waiing this correction of what waa done to the American Indian people.

tern eieera apogee in the United States began with passage of

ne Eccinl Security Actr--iIn 1935, authorizing federal grants to
states for public ansistance and chila welfare programe, 1
the Washington Legirlrture wi the Paupers Law of 1654 ena’
enactcd a State Social Securi y Law. "Welfare" hus been a bone of
contention ever since.

Greenleizh Repor’ -

In 1963, the Washington Legislature SRT ete $20, 000 for a study
of the state's public assistance programs. The study was made by
Greenleigh Associates, and the Greenleigh Report was presented in
December, 1964,

This report stated that public assistance grants in

Washington, with standar s based on 1959 prices and

12% ratable reductions,t.* ‘e 40% below the minimun

Standards for health and decency, Speaking of child ’

welfare needs, the report said:"There is an excessive

and increasing rate of referral of children to the

Juvenile Courts, both for dependency and delinquency,

There is an excessive and increasing trend for children

to be removed from their naturol families and ¢ared

for elsewhere,"

WHAT ABOUT RATABLE REDUCTIONS?

The 1965 Legislature removed the ratable reductions. The 1967
Legislature ordered the Dept. of Public Assistance to bring itts
pricing standard'ts up to 1967 levels.

New standards were put into effect July first. Increased allowances
for rent vary from county to county. Other allowances were increased]
an average of 10-3/4%.In King County the total increase was 16%,
Thus, King County grants have been increased by 28% since 1964,
but the cost of living has increased by at least 5%. Grants are still
17% less than acceptable levels.
The maximum grant for a Seattle family consisting of
tuo adults, a boy 13, and a girl 8, is $285.80 a
month--$3,429 a year. But recent changes in the
Federal Social Security Law cast a shadow on even
this figure. The local welfare officials ik not
offer any puess a8 to whot soy harnon 2 YEW RATABLE
REDUCTIONS ARE ALWAYS A POSSTBILIVY.

There is much talk of getting people off welfare by putting them to
work, Yet who will take care of the children? Child care costs fro:
$60 to $80 per child per month in Seattle, y

Some examples of women's wages:
Nurses Aid - $1.40 per hour ~-- $2912.00 “per year

WORKERS WORLD PARTY

On April 17, 1959, a confidential source advised
that on February 12, 1859, a Socialist Workers Party (SWP)
minority group under the leadership of National Committee
member SAM BALLAN, split from the SWP,

The source stated that this minority ground,
veferred to as the Marcyites, after many years of program
and policy differences on varied issues concerning tactics
and interpretation of political events, svlit from the SWP
on the grounds that the Party was liquidating itself by
departing from the Marxist precepts of LEON TROTSKY and
vetreating from the fight for the world socialist
revolution. The final issue which ultimately forced the
split was the minority's opposition to the SWP regroupment
pony which involved cooperation with the Communist Party

(CP) periphery-individuals characterized by the minority
as petty- bourgeois,

The minority program, according to the source,
advocated unconditional defense of the Soviet Union and has
as its goal the building of a revolutionary party with a
complete proletarian orientation for the purpose of overthrowing
capitalism in the United States and throughout the world,

: On May 12, 1960, source advised that this minority
group had chosen the name Workers World Party.

on May 1, 1967, a second confidential source
advised that the Workers World Party, which maintains head-
quarters at 46 West 21st Street, New York, New York, supports
the People's Republic of China in its ideological dispute
. with the Soviet Union,

The SWP and CP have been designated
