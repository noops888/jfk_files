SUBJECT: DEMONSTRATIONS, WASHINGTON, D. C., AND

SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA, NOVEMBER 20, 1971,

SPONSORED BY THE WOMEN'S NATIONAL ABORTION

ACTION COALITION.....

This memorandum advises of demonstrations being scheduled in

Washington, D. C., and San Francisco, California, on 11/20/71 to build

public support for the repeal of antiabortion laws.

The Women's National Abortion Action Coalition was formed at a

conference held at Columbia University, New York City, in July, 1971, which

was attended by approximately 1, 000 women from 29 states. The conference

voted to make a woman's right to abortion a national and political issue.

Subsequent to its formation, the coalition called for demonstrations in

San Francisco and Washington on 11/20/71 to build public support for the

repeal of all antiabortion laws, to protest forced sterilization, and to call

for an end to restrictive contraceptive laws. A source of the Washington

Field Office has advised that the march in Washington is supported by the

: Young Socialist Alliance, the youth group of the Socialist Workers Party

(SWP). Carol Lipman, who is a member of the SWP, is Project Director

of the Washington march.

D.C

Coalition leaders in requesting permit for the demonstration have

jestimated that participation in the Washington march will range between

/10, 000 and 20, 000 persons. The Washington Field Office has developed

information that 46 buses have been chartered to bring participants to the

demonstration. Participants will represent some 80 cities. The Metropolitan

Police Department anticipates participation will be in the vicinity of 5,000 person:

REC-23.

Demonstrators are scheduled to assemble at the Ellipse between

¡ 10 a.m. and 12 noon and will march via 17th Street to H Street, dowl H Street

¡ to 15th Street, down 15th Street to Pennsylvania Avenue, and then easton

Pennsylvania Avenue to the west steps of the Capitol. A rally will be held

at the latter site between 2 and 6 p.m.

As. the youth organization of the Socialist Workers

Party (SWP), the Young Socialist Alliance (YSA) serves

ag the main source of recruitment into that organization.

The YSA is described in the masthead of its official

publication, "The Young Socialist Organizer," as "A

multinational revolutionary socialist youth organization."

The SWP has been designated pursuant to Executive

Order 10450.

On November 18, 1971, the confidential source listea

above and a second confidential source who has furnished

"reliable information in

the past advised approximately. 15

individuals would be attending the demonstration in

washington, D. C., from Indiana University, Bloomington,

Indiana.

The individuals traveling were to represent tha

BAC headed by Paula Savich, Chairwoman and YSA member.

Included in those scheduled to travel were approximately five

or six members of the YSA from Indiana University and plans

were for individuals to travel in two Ford Econoline vans

rented from U-Haul,. Bloomington, Indiana. ' Original plans had

called for a bus to be chartered; however, the lack of

individuals signing up to attend the demonstration resulted in.

the cancellation of tha bus:

On November 16, 1971, an article entitled "Abortion

Repeal March Plans Set"

appeared on page 12 of the "Indiana

Daily Student", a local cannua daily newbager. The article

indicated approximately 40 student, were to travel to

Washington, D. C., and that Student Body President Mary Scifres

had been invited by the WONAAC to speak at a rally on the

Capitol steos in Washington, D. C. According to the article,

Seifres had not: decided whether or not to accept the

invitation. Paula Savich; Chairwoman for the local comnittee,

according to the article, stated,

"It is important that this

march be really big"

She indicated that they were taking

reservations for the bus trip to washington.

Or November 30, 1971, an article appeared on page 9

supra, captioned "Women.

The article stated that less

than the forty students who had been expected to attend the

demonstration actually attended.

The article indicated that

the large number of persons expected to attend the

Washington, D. C., demonstration from all over the country

did not materialize.

The article. also stated that student

Body President Mary Seifres, who had had to decline an

invitation by the demonstration sponsors to abeak at the

march because of obligations at Indiana University, preparea

a statement to be read.

Her statement and several

other

statements, however;

ware not read because of the lack of time

due to frequent breakdown of gound equipment delaying speeches.

According to

the article, Paula Savich had expected a better turn-

out from Indiana University..

On January 17, 1972, the second confidential source

mentioned. above advised that the BAC was not currently active.

and

that it was not expacted to be active in the near future

unless other demonstrations such as the demonstration held in

Washington, D. C., on November 20, 1971, called for support

from

RE:

(TROTSKYIST)

minus initidnt siter

On November 13, 1971, a source advised that the

Women's National Abortion Coalition (WONAAC) planned to

hold demonstrations at Washington, D. C. and San Francisco,

california on November 20, 1971.

The purpose of the

demonstrations were to call for

the repeal of all abortion,

contraception and forced sterilization laws.

The" Women's

Right to Choose of Maryland, the Baltimore, Maryland

affiliate of WONAAC was to organize busing and housing

arrangements for out-of-state women.

On November 22, 1971, a source advised that the

Women's Right to Choose of Maryland, working from 3028

Greenmout Avenue, Baltimore, Maryland, were unsuccessful

in attempts to generate enthusiasm for the WONNAC demonstration

among Baltimore area women.

Therefore, the plan to charter

a bus for the purpose of transporting

• demonstrators to the

Washington, D. C. rally was cancelled.

On November 30, 1971, a second source advised

that the Women's Right to Choose of Maryland had been

formed as an

"ad hoc" group for the specific purpose of

supporting the November 20, 1971 Washington, D. C. demonstra-

tion. The source furiner stated unau the women's Right

to Choose of Maryland ceased to exist, following this

demonstration, and is now efunct.

National Abortion Action

Coalition (WONAAC) Convention,

February 11 - 13, 1972

Boston,

Massachusetts

On February 18, 1972, source, who has furnished

reliable information in the past, furnished the following

information:

A Women's National Abortion Action Coalition

(WONAAC) Convention was held on the Boston University campus,

Boston, Massachusetts, during the period of February 11 -

13, 1972.

Approximately 1,000 persons were in attendance

at this convention which was held to determine future action

Of WONAAC and to allow diverse factions within the Women's

Abortion Movement to join ranks under one issue.

Female members of the Socialist Workers Party (57P)

and Young Socialist Alliance (YSA) fron all over the county

were requested by the national office of the SWP and YSA

to attend this convention in order to insure the effective

control of the convention by the SWP.

forkers the youth organization of the Socialist

Party (SHP), the Young Socialist Alliance:

(ISA) serves as the

main source of recruitment

into that organization.

The YSA is described

in the masthead of its official publication,

"The Young Socialist Organizer

," as "A multi-

national revolutionary socialist youth organi-

zation,"

The SWP has been designated pursuant to

Executive Order 10450.

Re: WONAAC

The SWP specifically wished the convention to

adopt a one-issue position, that being the complete

control of the fenale

body by the individual female.

This specific issue,

"women control their bodies" was

adopted by the women's organizati on and all other propo-

sals were rejected.

Workshops were organized for each of the many

separate racial and ethnis groups represented at the

conference.

Workshops were based on appeal to the speci-

fic group intended and all were supposedly controlled by

the sVP.

A Black, Raza, Asian-American women's workshop

was held on February 12, 1972, with 35 persons attending.

Among the issues discussed at

the workshop were the

attempts of democratic and republican presidential candi-

dates to capitalize on minority group attitudes in regard

to the abortion movement and the fact that minority groups

all to often find themselves without a voice when real

issues are involved.

of particular importance to the group was the

La Raza Unida

Party, a legitimate political party in Texas

which serves to unite Mexican Americans. Of

equal impor-

tance was the Gay Liberation movement, which the group

felt expresses the plight of gay females who do not want

children and are forced to live with men because of the

mores of American society.

Attendees agreed that the one issue of abortion

law. repeal will serve to unite women under one banner-and'..

more effectively serre

the woren's

lovement.

The convention adjourned after an

agreement that

an "Abortion Action Week" would be held May 1 - 6, 1972.

This action would serve to keep public attention focused

on the need to legalize abortion and to seek effective

support from

the many thousands of women who want to right

to choose.

II. ACTIVITIES

A. Conferences and Demonstrations •

1. WONAAC Founding Conference was held in New York

City, New York, July 16-18, 1971.

This conference called for

on gordon aston Cal formal, ront the theme of ironel

(WF I-1, 7/21/71)

a. On November 20, 1971, approximately 1,500 romen,

representing womens liberation grouds from the East

Coast and

Mid-West, gathered on the Ellide in TDC, in response to the

call by WONAAC to march on the United States Capitol to demand

the redeal of all abortion laws. This grouD dearted the

Ellipse at approximately 10:30 a.m. on that date and marched

along Pennsylvania Avende, M.W., to tue rest side of lie Capitol

Building.

There the marchers assembled for a rally which

concluded at approximately 4:00 p.m. on the same date. There

were no incidents of violence and the march and rally were

Deaceful throughout.

WFO 100-55420

and the demonstration ended without incident.

(Physical observation, Special

Agents, FBI, 1/13/72)

2. Second WONAAC Conference was held in Boston,

Massachusetts,

February 11-13, 1972. Approximately 1,300

women attended the conference, which once again re-established

and reiterated WONAAC's call for abortion on demand.

It was

noted during the conference that WONAAC had been unable to

create anything like a national campaign and that local meetings

across the country had been disadpointingly small. It was

pointed out that WONAAC had failed to attract the large numbers

of working women, housewives, and students concerned with the

abortion issue, including the majority of women's liberationists

and abortion reform activists. It was felt that the movement

could not succeed without the support of the working women.

At the close of the conference, WONAAC strongly endorsed

the "Abortion Rights Act of 1972," walch is to be introduced in

the U. S. Congress by Congresswoman BELLA ABZUG From New York.

This bill would override all laws which impose sanctions upon''

those who choose to exercise their individual right to an abortion.

(WE I-1, 2/14/72)

a. Proposed Actions

It was moved and adopted during the above conference

that WONAAC sponsor a week of local abortion activities, May 1-6,

1972, consisting of educational programs, legislative

support,

judicial action, and culminating

• in local

or regional demonstra-

tions on May 6, 1972, around the demand for redeal of all anti-

abortion laws and restrictive contraception laws and an end to

forced sterilization.

(WF I-1, 2/14/72)

In addition, the following secondary pronosals were

adopted during the conference:

NW 68262 Docld:32989545 Page 137

CONFIDENTIAL

WFO 100-55420

1. That a telegram be sent to the New York

State Court of Appeals and New York Governor

NELSON A. ROCKEFELLER, condemning the court's

February 10, 1972, decision denying women on

Medicaid

the right to abortions on demand.

2. That the coalition continue to organize black,

Puerto Rican, Chicano, native American and Asian

American participation in their activities.

3. That members of local coalitions confront

candidates for office and force them to take a

stand on abortion, and that they publicize those

who oppose abortion so that the voters can see

where these politicians stand.

4. That the coalition make a special effort to

reach out to

and involve "gay" women in their

activities.

(WF I-1, 2/14/72) 1

YSA and SWP members of WONAAC felt the conference to

be a success in that opposition proposals submitted were turned

in favor of those proposals backed by the YSA-SWP women.

Washington Field.

The State University of New York at Binghamton

is part of the University system of the State of New York,

and the University at Binghamton has an enrollment of

approximately 7,500

students.

The student newspaper

published at the University twice weekly during the school

year in its issue of 10/15/71 carried a brief ad in the

classified section as follows:

"Women who have had abortions needed to relate

their experiences to other women, educate all women

about abortion at abortion speak out October 21. Contact

Linda L., extention 4130."

The 11/12/71, issue of the "Pipedream", student

newspaper published at the State University 'of New York

at Binghamton, carries an announcement that the Binghamton

Womens Abortion Coalition was selling bus tickets. for the

Womens March on Washington for repeal of all abortion laws,

repeal of all contraception laws and no force sterilization

for 11/20/71. Women and men were invited to attend and

Cars and

volunteers were needed and they were to contact LINDA LOEW

at extention 4129.

Former At 3487-PSI, who is familiar with New

Left activities on the campus of the State University of

New York at Binghamton was contacted regularly during the

school year of 1971-72 and he stated that he id see

some signs on bulletin boards in the Fall of 1971 about

abortion organizations, but never knew them to be of much

success on campus.

activity or signs on any bulletin boards from the period

of approximately January, 1972 until school closed in

May, 1972.

This source was contacted 5/16/72. He stated

also at that time that LINDA LOEW has been a close

associate of BETTY, SACHS who is the leader of the Young

Socialist Alliance Chapter on campus at the University.

Informant stated that there was no organization formed

his knowledge of a Womens Abortion Action Coalition in

the Binghamton area.

Other sources familiar with New Left activities

on the campus of the State University of New York at

Binghamton, were contacted during May, 1972, and two

sources advised that they knew of no organization of

Womens Abortion Action Coalition on the campus or in the

Binghamton vicinity during the past year.

Albany Division has had an investigation pending

on LINDA LOEW and a report is being written with appropriate

recommendation for administrative action on LINDA LOEW.

In view of the lack of activity of an Abortion Coalition

organization in the Binghamton area, no further investigation

is being conducted by Albany.

part reported that more than 800 women from accoss the

country had gathered for a confarence at Boston University

the weekend of February 11-13, 1972 to plan a strategy

to win repeal of all laws that prohibit abortion.

would endorse the latest Federal bill to nullify all

state laws restricting abortion. "The Abortion Rights

YOU CANNOT HAVE

WARS WITHOUT

• WOMEN

Women must use their minds, their voices, and

their bodies to stop the killing in Vietnam; to do

less is to ignore our special responsibilities to

the human race.

"10, 000 women have sat back and let their sons

be killed in Vietnam. If we had 10, 000 women

willing to go to jail if necessary we could stop

the war in Vietnam. You cannot have wars with-

out women. "

Jeannette Rankin made the above statement in

May of this year. Fifty years ago, as the first

woman elected to Congress, she voted against

World War I. She has consistently maintained

her struggle for peace, and at 86 she is as coura.

geous and vigorous as ever--an inspiration to all

women.

The presence of the United States forces in the in

ernal struggle of Vietnam is immoral and illegal.

There can be no possible justification for our inte

ference in the domestic affairs of this tiny distant

land.

This 86-year-old woman has stated that she is wi

ing to stay in jail until the bombing is stopped.

N

all women are free to join her, but we can assure

her that thousands of women will march peacefull

beside her. Some will picket, others will go to ja

with Miss Rankin. Every woman's participation i

On January 8th, women from all over the land wil

Chairman, said attention shoula ba placea on three political

questions - peace, civil rights, and labor. Under peace, he

At another section meeting,

February 5, 1966, TAIMI HALONEN was praiseù for effective

peace work and for her help in developing unity among the peace

forces.

Section-wide concentration was urged in assisting

SWAP to visit 1,000 workers on the Vietnam issue.

A third source advised on February 24, 1966, a

Northwest District CP Committee meeting was held at Seattle

BRIGADE FORMED TO CONFRONT CONGRESS

Helena, Montana

November 27, 1967

To all American Women:

I ain proud of the fact that my first

vote cast in Congress was a vote

against war.

It was the first oppor-

unity for a woman to vote, because I

was the first woman to be elected to

Congress.

I believed then, as I do today,

that women are the

ones that must be

concerned with the needs and develop-

ment of the human race.

I have always

fought for the dignity of all human

beings - for those of the present as

well as those of future generations.

I will continue to struggle as long

as I live. I hope all women will res-

pond to the following call and join me

in Washington on January 8, 1968, the

opening day of Congress.

Jeannette Rankin

A CALL TO ALL AMERICAN WOMEN who

are outraged by the ruthless slaughter

in Vietnam and the persistent neglect

of human needs at home TO COME TO

WASHINGTON ON JANUARY 8

AMERICAN WOMEN represent 51% of the

Demonstrate it to the Congress of the

United States! Come to Washington on

January 8 as Congress opens in joint

session.

Support Jeannette Rankin as

she leads a representative delegation

of American women to the Capitol to

demand that:

*Congress, as its first order

of business, resolve to end

the war in Victnam and imnedi-

ately arrange for the with-

drawal of all American troops.

*Congress use its power to make

reparations for the ravaged land

we leave behind in Vietnam.

*Congress listen to what the

American people are saying and

refuse the insatiable demands of

the military-industrial complex.

WOMEN OF AMERICA, our power is un-

limited. On January 8, American women

will:

*PETITION the United States Con-

gress

*CONVENE a Congress of American

Women that afternoon to develop

programs to meet the crisis in

America - programs which will

express our political power,

a "Call" from the Jeannette Rankin Brigade (JRB) "To all

American women"

, announcing a proposed march on washington,

D. C.,

on January 8, 1968, when the United States Congress

opens in joint session. This march would be to demand that

Congress, as its Iirst order of business, resolve to end

• the war in Vietnam and immediately arrange for the with

Rankin Brigade should be made up of only those women who

volunteer to participate with the prior understanding that

they should be ready to spend at least two months in jail

for the commission of civil disobedience while in

washington,

D.: C.

Sunderland also suggested that a good way to recruit

women to join the Brigade would be, to make a pitch,

recruits when Mary Clarke, Dagmar Wilson and Ruth Krause

• are making their respective speaking engagements across the

United States since their return from a trip to North Vietnam,

which they visited as representatives of WSF during the d

fall of 1967.

Source Four advised during the summer of 1965

that June Sunderland, 3730 Hollister Avenue,

Santa Barbara, California, had attended a 1967

"peace conference" In Helsinki, Finland, at the

Invitation of the Communist Party (CP),

and that

funds to cover her expenses were raised in part

by the CP; and that following her attendance at

the Helsinki affair she went on to Russia for ten

days at the invitation and expense of the Soviet

Government.

Source One learned that a communication was re

ceived from eastern sponsors of the JRB on December 7, 1967,

Indicating that the JRB march on Washington might not

held on January 8, 1968, but possibly would be set back until

either the 15th or 22nd of January 1968, depending upon

the date that the United States. Congress would reconvene.

The communication indicated that since the entire purpose

of the Brigade would be to confront the opening joint session

of Congress that it would be futile to schedule the march

prior to the date Congress would reconvene. The suggestion

was made that recruitment of local women to participate in

the uRB be held in abeyance until a conficmation had been

obtained indicating the date on which Congress would reconvene.

Source One, had Indicated that although the "Call"

JANUARY 8, 1968

INFORMATION CONCERNING

Reference is made to a previous memorandum dated

November 2%, 1967, concerning captioned demonstration which

was titled Jeannette Rankin's Brigade, Information Concerning.

On December 13, 1967, a confidential source who has

furnished reliable information

in the past, made available a

leaflet received from ANCI KOPPEL, leader of Seattle Women -

Act for Peace (SWAP), which indicates SWAP is attempting to

help mobilize à "Nationwide Congress of Women" to be held in

Washington, D. C., January 8, 1968, on the opening day of

Congress.

The leaflet suggests participants "represent

ourselves in Congress" and "test our WOMAN POWER."

A repro-

duction of the leaflet is attached.

JEANNETE RANKIN, the Chairman of the Brigade,

is an 86-year-old resident of Watkinsville,

Georgia, who served in the House of Repre-

sentatives as a Congresswoman from Montana from

1917 to 1919 and who was elected to that office

for one term in 1940.

She has repeatedly opposed

U. S. involvement in

foreign wars and voted

against declarations of war by the U. S. in both

World Wars I and II.

ANCI KOPPEL and SWAP are characterized in the

appendix.

On December 14, 1967, DALE JENSEN, Charter Service

edition reflecting that in November, 1961, when con-

cern mounted over radioactive fallout from nuclear

testing, a group of women in washington, D. C. started

Women Strike for Peace.

The idea spread rapidly through-

Women For Peace groups in the San Francisco Bay area.

These groups support programs to achieve goals such as:

(1) Continued disarmament negotiations.

(2) A strong and flexible United Nations.

(3)

Planning now at state

and national levels for

conversion to peace-time economy and positive

efforts to ease world tensions.

The women act as individuals and as a group, with specific

actions suggested by individuals and groups

from all over

the world.

Decision to participate jointly on any given

suggestion is democratly arrived at by members of the Co-

ordinating Committee.

Effective cooperation with other

peace groups is encouraged. Monthly Coordinating Comnittee

meetings aid general meetings, as warranted, ara open to

all and annunced in nailings to nemoers.

There are no

dues or membership forms nor conditions for membership.

To stir an awareness of the need for peace, Women For

November 27, 1967

TO ALL AMERICAN WOMEN,

I am proud of the fact that my first vote cast in Congress

was a vote against war. It was the first opportunity for a

woman to vote because I was the first woman to be elected

to Congress.

I believed then as I do today that women are the ones who

must be concerned with the needs and development of the

human race, I have always fought for the dignity of all

human beings - for those of the present as well as those

of future generations.

I will continue to struggle as long as I live.

I hope all women will respond to the following CALL, and

join me in Washington on January 8, 1968, the ppening

day of Congress.

With highest hopes,

WOMEN OF AMERICA, our power is unlimited. On January 8, American women will:

PETITION the United States Congress

CONVENE a Congress of American Women that afternoon to develop

programs to meet the crisis in America-programs which will express

Jeannette Rankin made the above statement in

May of this year.

Fifty years ago, as the first

woman elected to Congress, she voted against World

Far I. She has consistently maintained her strug-

Ele for peace, and at 8e she is as courageous and

vigorous as ever - an inspiration to all women.

The presence of the United States forces in

PORTLAND WOMEN FOR PEACE

P. 0. BOX 13061

ORTLAND ONGONERAL

Deceriber 18, 1967

Dear Friend:

We are sending this letter to you and others from whom we have not heard much

recently, in the hope of re-enlisting your efforts in the Women for Peace

movement.

It has been too long since we last heard directly from many of you,

and our meetings with those of you whom we have seen recently have been brief.

Of course, we know the paralyzing sense of frustration we all feel occasionally,

as ie learn of the mounting horrors in Victnam. But this feeling is only

temporary, and quickly gives way to activity.

As women, we bear the major

responsibility for the preservation of life, and thus a major responsibility

in the peace movement.

Enclosed you will find an announcement of the latest national women's effort

for peace.

Several peace groups in Portland are cooperating in raising funds

to send representatives to lashington. He hope that you will also support this

effort, to insure representation from Portland Women for Peace.

The coupon

on the enclosed notice is for your use in this effort.

In addition, we will have a supportive peaceful demonstration

in Portland at

from noon to I p.M., leafleting as we walk.

We hope, if you cannot go to lashington, yourself, that you will contribute to

• heLp someone eise to go,

and that you will also join with us at the pioneer

•Post Office at noon Monday, January 15th:

In addition, please let us hear from you on your ideas of what more we might

do locally.

We have some ideas too, which we hope to share with you, and on

which we shall reed much help.

Please get in touch with one of us soon. You, help, ideas, and efforts are

urgently needed.

JEANNETTE RANKIN

Holena, Montana

November 27, 1967:

To all American Women:

ESHADENTIAL

I an proud of the fact that my first vove cast in Congress was a vote against war.

It was the first opportunity for a woman to vote; because I was the first woman:

to be clected to Congress.

I believed then, as I do today, that women are the ones that must be concerned

with the

needs, and, development of the human race.

I have always fought for the

dimity of all human boings -- for those of the présent as well as those of future

generations..

I will continue to struggle as long as I live. I hope all women will respond to

...the following. call and join me in Washington on January 15

1900, the opening day

of Congress:

Dear Friend:

He are sending this letter to you and oliors from whom we have not heard much

recently, in the hope of re-enlisting your offorts in the Women for Peace

movement.

It has been too long since we last hoard directly from many of you,

and our meetings with those of you whom we have seen recently have been brief.

Of course, we know the paralyzing sense of frustration we all feel occasionally,

as ive learn of the mounting horrors in Vietnam.

But this feeling is only

temporary, and quickly gives way to activity.

is women, we bear the major

responsibility for the preservation of life, and thus a major responsibility

in the peace movement,

Inclosed you will find an announcement of the latest national women's effort

for peace.

Several peace groups in Portland are cooperating in raising funds

to send representatives to Washington.

We hope that you will also support this

effort, to insure representation from Portland Women for Peace.

The coupon

on the

enclosed notice is for your use in this effort.

In addition, we will have a supportive peaceful demonstration

dignity of all human beings - for those of the proset as well as those of future

generations. •

133 West 72nd Street, New York City, originally scheduled

a demonstration in Washington, D.C. on January 8, 1968, to

The source stated that Senator Mansfield had not

Captain Robert Krahling, United States Capito.

Police,

advised on January s, 1968, that a delegation Iron

the JRB and their attorney, Josephtforer, met with officials

of the United States Capitol Police on January 2, 1968,

concerning details of the proposed demonstration.

These Li

individuals were advised by the United States Capitol Police

that they cannot demonstrate on the Capitol grounds in

a group or carcy placards, as such activity is prohibited

.ocom

by rules of Congress.

Forer, as attorney fos the group,

advised the officials that these women will be coming to

the Capitol as individuals and although they will be walking

together they

can only be kept out of the Capitol building

if the police

exclude

all visitors from the United states

Capitol.

Forer argued that such a demonstration on the

Capitol grounds is not a violation of the law by the

participants but a violation of the United States Government

in refusing to allow its citizens to present their grievances

to Congress,

Captain Krahling advised that in addition to

Joseph Forer,

the members of the above delegation included

the following individuals:

WOMEN FOR PEACE aka

Women Strike for Peace

The "Berkeley Daily Gazette,"

a daily newspaper of

general circulation published in Berkeley, California,

contained an article in

the November 19, 1965, evening

edition reflecting that in November, 1961, when con-

cern mounted over radioactive fallout from nuclear

testing, a group of women in Washington, D. C. started

Women Strike for Peace.

The idea spread rapidly through-

out the country and now embraces 900 groups, including

Women For Peace groups in the San Francisco Bay area.

These groups support programs to achieve goals such as:

(1) Continued disarmament negotiations.

(2) A strong and flexible United Nations. •

(3)

Planning now at state and national levels for

conversion to peace-time economy and positive

efforts to ease world tensions.

The women act as individuals and as a group, with specific

actions suggested by individuals and groups from all over

the world.

Decision to participate jointly on any given

suggestion is democratly arrived at by members of the co-.

ordinating Committee. Effective cooperation with other

peace groups is encouraged. Monthly Coordinating Committee

meetings and general meetings, as warranted, are open to

and and announced in mailings to members. There are no

dues or membership forms nor conditions

for membership.

To stir an awareness of the need for peace, Homen For

reace encourage public education in peace objectives at

Local schools and sponsor peace-oriented demonstrations

the group attempts to influence government officials

by letters and conferences.

CHICAGO COUNCIL OF AMERICAN-SOVIET

TOLATIONS, Formerly known as Chicago

council of American-Soviet Friendship

EDWIN GORDON FOX, 7147 Jeffrey Avenue, Chicago,

Illinois, (now deceased) made available in January, 1954,

the

"First Annual Report CCASF," an undated

publication which

stated that the Chicago Council of American-Soviet Friendship

(CCASF) was incorporated in July, 1943.

This document stated,

"The Council's affiliation with the National Council of

American-Soviet Friendship (NCASF) was validated August 11,

(1943). The present name was adopted to conform to standard

national practice.

It should be noted, however, that the

Chicago Council is entirely autonomous; the government of its

affairs rests exclusively in the hands of its Chicago Executive

Board,"

On April 8, 1965, a source furnished information to

the effect that as of March 11, 1965, this organization would

be known as the Chicago Council

of American-Soviet Relations

(CCASR) • MANDEL TERMAN continued to be listed as Chairman of

the new organization.

During April, 1965, a second source advised that

MANDEL TERMAN had

arbitrarily dissolved the Board of Directors,

assumed all financial and other functions of the organization,

and

was maintaining existing records of the organization at

his residence, 660 West Irving Park Road, Chicago, Illinois.

The aims and purposes of this organization continued to be

to work for peaceful coexistence and friendship with the USSR.

While it claimed to be an autonomous organization, its program

followed the NCASf and it was in frequent contact with the

NCASF.

On November 5, 1958, a third source advised that in

the early 1940s, MANDEL TERMAN was a member-at-large of the

Communist Party (CP) of Illinois. FERMAN was in Russia in

November, 1958, where he had gone to discuss the treatment of

Jews and to discuss Jewish culture in the USSR with the

leadership of the Soviet Union.

CHICAGO COUNCIL OF AMERICAN-

In january, 1966,

& fourth source advised that the

CCASR went out of existence in the

spring of 1965 due to the

health condition of MANDEL A. FURNAN.

The offices ci the

CCASR, formerly located at 32 West Randolph Street, Chicago,

were for a short time carried at HANDEL TERMAN's home resi-

dence,

660 West Irving Park Road,

Chicago.

During the Fall

of 1965 due to the defunctness of the CCASh, the CP of Illinois

found it necessary to sponsor a rally honoring the 48th

anniversary of the

Russian Revolutio, under a temporary

committee called "The Chicago Committee for American-Soviet

Friendship Rally," This rally was held on November 7, 1965,

and once the rally was

held this temporary committee went

out of existence.

The fourth

source advised that as of the present

time the CCASR is delunet in the Chicago area and any future

rally to be held on the American-soviet friendship theme will

have to be organized by the CP of Illinois on a temporary

basis.

The NCASE ins been

TO ALL AMERICAN WOMEN,

• ... •..

I am proud of the fact that my first vote cast in Congress

was a vote against war. It was the first opportunity for a

woman to vote because I was the first woman to be elected

to Congress.

I believed then as I do today that women are the ones who

must be concerned with the needs and development of the

human race. I have always fought for the dignity of all

human beings - for those of the present as well as those

of future generations.

I will continue to struggle as long as I live.

I hope all women will respond to the following CALL, and

join me in Washington on January 8, 1968, the opening

day of Congress.

With highest hopes,

A CALL

TO AMERICAN WOMEN

who are outraged by the ruthless slaughter in Vietnam

and the persistent neglect of human needs at home

TO COME TO WASHINGTON JANUARY 15. & 16

AMERICAN WOMEN constitute 51% of the voting population, yet a high percentage of us don't vote. •

It is time forewomen to break out of their societal molds and take their place as effective, vocal citi-

zens. WOMEN CAN ELECT the President they want; Women can determine the political, social and

economic direction of the nation. WE HAVE WOMEN POWER. Let's use it to demonstrate our

opposition to this war to the Congress of the United States.

We are a broad coalition of women from many areas of American life. We shall meet in Washington

on January 15 for the opening of Congress to demand the following:

1. CONGRESS, AS ITS FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS, RESOLVE TO END THE

WAR IN VIETNAM AND IMMEDIATELY ARRANGE FOR THE WITHDRAWAL

OF ALL AMERICAN TROOPS.

2. CONGRESS USE ITS POWER TO HEAL A SICK SOCIETY AT HOME.

ri

CONGRESS USE ITS POWER TO MAKE REPARATION FOR THE RAVAGED

LAND WE LEAVE BEHIND IN VIETNAM.

4. CONGRESS LISTEN TO WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE SAYING AND

REFUSE THE INSATIABLE DEMANDS OF THE MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL

COMPLEX.

After we petition the United States Congress, we will hold our own congress to articulate our position

on the basic problem of achieving peace. We declare our intention to return to our communities and

mobilize women to dedicate ourselves to reshaping American society, and restoring our country to a

position of honor in the community of nations.

On January 15, we will meet at the Union Depot in Washington, D.C., at 11:30 A.M., and walk behind

our delegation which will present our petition to the U.S. Congress.

On January 16, many of us will stay in Washington to begin implementation of these demands by

presenting them to our Congressmen and Senators. We hope you can stay.

Re New York letter to the Bureau, 6/6/72; Bureau 0-7

to New York, 1/12/72; and Philadelphia letter to the Bureau,

2/28/73.

As outlined in referenced New York letter, the

New York Office noted, as far back as June, 1972, it

recognized that, although several leaders

of WONAAC were

known to be SWP members,

their activities, as pertaining

to

"ONAAC, had been directed tora the legal

repeal of all

restrictive abortion laws, and investigation had disclosed

no indication that WONAAC, as an organization, had engaged in

any subversive or vidence

prone activity.

Referenced Bureau O-7, referencing the aforementioned

as office of origin, had overall responsibility for captioned

case and submit semi-annual reports.

A review of the results of the continuing investigation

Of WONAAC, together with all indices and references pertaining

thereto, since dune t912, reflects no apparent change in the

activities or the organization o its membership from that

outlined above.

The New York Office Is in accord with the view of the

Philadelphia Division, as set forth in its referenced letter,

that WONAAC represents basically a social change vehicle which,

despite disparate political views of its leaders and membership,

deals with the single issue of abortion rights!

In view of instructions set forth in Bureau

Bureau reiterated its policy that the FBI has no interest

in individuals and organizations involved in legitimate

dissent and the recent United States Supreme Court decision

investigation of WONAAC as such

is not justified.

The New York Office further concurs with the

Philadelphia view that continued investigati on of the SWP

Re :

National Women's Political Caucus (NNPC)

Policy Council Meeting

Source, who has furnished reliable information in the

past, provided the following information on July 3, 1972:

A POliCy Council. Meeting of the National Women's

Political Caucus

(NVPC) was held in Washington, D.C. during

the period June 24, 1972 - June 25, 1972.

The NWPC is a legitimate, loosely-knit, open

organization of politically motivated women

seeking equal recognition

in the American

community.

During the Policy Council. Meeting there were no

overt attempts by any organized aroup to influence the policy

meeting and there were no individuals present who identified

themselves as members of any organization which might be construed

as subversive and/o supporting any cause except legitimate

change.

Of

significance, however, was the fact that literature

of the Women's National

Abortion Action Coalition (WONAAC) was

present in brochures and pamphlets located throughout the meeting

area.

All of the WONAAC material was geared to the abortion

movement and specifically the WONAAC conference scheduled for

Hunter College, New York, July 15 - 16, 1972..

WONAAC was founded in July, 1971. for the purpose of

forming a national movement of groups scattered

throughout the United States who favor and

now work to legalize abortion.

The Young Socialist

AdLlance lIsA and Socialist Workers Party (SWP)

are playing a major role in toNAAC.

The SWp has been designated pursuant to

Executive Order 10450.

Re:

NVPC Policy Council Meeting

As the youth organization of the SWP, the

YSA serves as the main source of recruitment into

that organization.

The YSA is described in the

masthead of its official publication, "The Young

Socialist Organizer:" as

"a multinational

revolutionary socialist youth organization."

During the council meeting on June 21, 1972, Mary

Clarke, who is associated with the Southern California WPC,

an affiliate of the NWPC: advised a group of policy council

members that WONAAC had been using the Southern California WPC

name as an endorser of WONAAC. Clarke also stated that MONAAC

had passed out propaganda at a caucus rally in California

and

vere very effective at taking control of small gatherings:

The Chairwoman from Nassau County in New York, whose

name was not recalled, defended

WONAAC stating that "they were

a good groupi

This woman's position was not supported ana,

in general, WONAAC literature was not accepted bu those persons

present,

Jill ruckelshaus, a new member of the Policy Council,

is reportedly concerned about the SWP's

attempts to align

itself with the abortion movement and will be using her newly

gained position to fight SWP attempts at control of local

MPC groups.

The NWPC organizing brochure Duhlished by the NIPC

has been written to assist individual PC groups in organizing.

The brochure lists political parties and para-political

organizations to be contacted br caucus organizers when

forming

the nucleus of a PC. Among those listed was the SWP. After

discussions at the caucus it was determined that the swp should

be removed from the list.

The new edition of the upC organizing

brochure will not list the SWP; it has been replaced by National

Peace Action Coalition (NRAC) .

The NPAC was

founded in 1970 by members of the sp.

Its basic objective is to unite masses of people

including labor unions: CIs, and the black

community

• in the struggle to end United States

intervention in Southeast Asia through orderly and

peaceful tactics.

Confidential sources one, two and three, all of

whom have furnished reliable information in the past, advised

on. July 1o, 19, and 20, 1972, respectively, that a Women's

National Abortion Action Coalition HONAIC, Conference was

nela at hunter college, Park Avenue and o9th Street, on

July 15 and 16, 1972.

Confidential source number one advised that

New York City was picked for the site of this convention

because this city is considered to be the center of the most

powerful anti-abortion effort so far.

The WONAAC Conference was open to all women

Who supported the Abortion Law Repeal Movement.

Registration

was $3.00 per person.

Housing and chila care facilities were

available.

There were approximately 800 women in attendance

at this conference.

Discussions held at this conference centered on

plans for (one) future activity in the campaign to repeal

all anti-abortion and contraception laws and (two to end

forced sterilization.

A discussion was held concerning the attacks

being made by the Catholic Church Flerarchy and other

anti-abortion groups against women's rights to their

own bodies.

WONAAC is aware of the fact that progress for

these matters will not come easy, that it will be fought by

various groups step by step all the way, therefore, this

conference was called to aiscuss all the different approaches

and to decide on the major direction for WONAAC to take..

A National VONAC structure proposal was

presented, which

siated in part as follows:

"All women are welcome in HONAC: Black,

women, high schost, college, and

working women, women

from political orgonizations, trade unions, the militarys

and communities across the country. We are united in un-

compromising struegle for our connon goal: the right of

all women to control fully their own reproductive lives..."

"The National Conference shall be the highest

decision-making body of MONAC, and shall operate on the

basis of one woman, one vote.

"There shall be a National Coordinating Committee

(NCC) composed of one woman from each national organization,

area coalition, and group supporting and building WONAAC...

There shall also be a Working Committee (WC),

which is a sabaconmittee of the NCC and which is composed

In addition to the above, a proposal "that the

National Office of the Women's National Abortion Action

coalition establish an emergency cach fund, from which to

contribute significant amounts of money to organizations

and individuals who are

working to achieve goals compatible

with those of WONAAC...

"That the National Office of WONAAO, as Its first

act of financial support, pledge $2,000 to the Kennedy-Schulder

suit against the tar-exempt status of the Roman Catholic Church,

since the Church has violated restrictions on its political

activity by lobbying for anti-abortion legislation.

confidential source number two related that the

evening plenary

session of WONAAC occurred on July 15, 1972,

and it was immediately apparent that the Socialist

Workers Party - Young Socialist Alliance (SWP-YSA) group

dominated the meeting. Independent women who wanted to make

statements during this session were voted down by SWP floor

leaders and these same

persons continued to vote as a bloc

on all issues.

The group of independent women fron various geogra

phic areas, that is those women who were not associated with the

SWP or YSA, went together after the plenary session was adjourned

and considered the problem of. how to handle the SWP leaders.

While these women were not political realists in their goals,

they did believe In working throughout the existing system

rather than functioning with the SWP in their eventual goal

of revolution.

It was decided that the independent feminists would

no longer continue hassling within WONAAC.

They did not want

to have decisions for them being structured by a male dominates

group. They also decided that money being collected by WONAAC

in the name of abortion law change was not being used for that

purpose, but rather to sustain members of the SiP-ySA.

The sunday morning session, July 16, 1972, was

labeled "Meeting to Discuss Internal.

About 35

independents attended and a few number of SWP-YSA members

and

sympathizers were present.

Independents there were from New

There were approximately 700-800 women in attendance.

at the afternoon session.

According to one of the SwP

leaders, these women were from 31 states and three countries-

Canada,

Italy and' Sweden.

The states that had more representation

than others were Ohio, Illinois, New York, and Massachusetts.

Most of the problems and differences between the

independents and the SWP centered around approaches to abortion

law reform.

The SWP was charged with always having demonstra-

tions and

sallies and

never doing any work through the legis

lative process.

The independents stated that they were tired of this

hassle and that they believed there were more effective ways

to change abortion laws

than carrying placards in the streets.

After the independent women publicly resigned in

Iront of the plenary session, two other coordinators announced

they were staying on. One was Barbara Roberts, the other's

name is unknown.

Linda Jenness made a final plea for the independent

women to reconsider. The removal of the independents from WONAAC

has debilitated the organization and most independent representa-

tives will be going back to their own cities to work for abortion

law change in organizations which have no connection with the

SWP.

The concern still exists, however, that WONAAC wilL

be able to collect monies in the name of abortion reform and

there is also the concern that women new to the movement will

join in a mistaken notion that they will be furthering

abortion law reform.

Independents vowed before leaving New York that

they would try to publicize activities from the Swp in an

effort to prevent this.

The YSA is described in the masthead

of its official publication, "The loung

The SiP has been designated pursuant

Of WONAAC in the Philadelphia area and

that he was not aware of

any information which would reflect that Philadelphia WONAAC was

substantially controlled by the SWP. Source explained that the

abortion rights issue had frequently been discussed at many of the

recent public forum type meetings sponsored by the Philadelphia

SWP and held at the Philadelphia SWP Headquarters at 1004 Filbert

Street in Philadelphia.

The discussions held on the abortion

rights issue indicated

that the SWP felt that the capitalistic

system had used the dual issues of abortion and women's liberation

to keep women in a position of inferiority, whereas the socialistic

system being promoted by the sw would be in favor of abortion anc

women's liberation, and WONAAC would therefore naturally attract

to their organization.

At four closed meetings of the TCB-SWP held on

various dates between January 26, 1972, and April 3, 1972,

the women's liberation movement and some of the activities

of the abortion action group were discussed. Included among

these discussions were proposed attendance by local repre-

sentatives at a WONAAC conference scheduled to be held at

Boston, Massachusetts, February 11-13, 1972. At a meeting

held April 3, 1972, discussions centered around a report

presented concerning an abortion action week scheduled to

be held in May, 1972, culminating in a May 6 rally at the

State Capitol

Building in St. Paul, Minnesota.

March 22, 1972.

Items included during these discussions were an MWAAC action

conference scheduled to be held at the University of Minnesota

abortion action week scheduled

to be held during the period

The Young Socialist Alliance-Twin Cities

Group is the Youth Branch of the Twin Cities

Branch-socialist Workers Party (TCB-sWO), an

affiliate of the Socialist Workers Party (SWP).

As the youth organization of the Socialist

Workers Party (SWP), the Young Socialist Alliance

(YSA) serves as the

main source of recruitment

into that organization.

The YSA is described in

the masthead of its official publication,

"The

Young Socialist Organizer, " as "A multinational

revolutionary socialist youth organization."

The MWAAC rally held May 6, 1972, began at the

residence of the governor of the State of Minnesota,

1006

Summit Avenue, St. Paul, Minnesota, at approximately 3:30P.M.

and proceeded

to the State Capitol

Building where the rally

calling for the repeal of all abortion laws and emphasizing

the demand for the right to legal abortions was held. The

included representatives from the YSA-TCG and the TCB-SWP.

decided that an International Tribunal was planned for

October 21, 1972. The International Tribunal would be

held in New York City, New York, and it was hoped that

plans could be made for a local tribunal scheduled to be

held October 13, 1972, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, after

which individuals would be designated

to attend the inter-

national meeting scheduled for New York City. This July,

1972, meeting was the first activity on the part of the

MWAAC as a ned organized effort following the May 6, 1972,

rally.

MP T-1 on

August 9, 1972

Individuals known to be involved in the women's

liberation movement in the Twin Cities area of Minneapolis

and St. Paul, Minnesota, have, during the past six months,

shown little or no interest in the organization known as

the

MWAAC.

Former leaders in the women's liberation movement

have become aware of the SP influence among the leaders of

the group, and have adopted a hands off policy from active

participation in the affairs of this group. While the

May 6, 1972, rally in St. Paul, Minnesota, was attended by

some 200 individuals, their attendance was considered to be

due to individual interest in the abortion issue.

MP T-2 on

August 17, 1972

SWP INFLUENCE

The MWAAC is not a committee of the TCB-SWP, nor

is it a part of the YSA-TCG.

Women's liberation is a

topic

of general interest and concern to the membership of the

TCB-SWP, and the anti-abortion standard taken by MWAAC is

one aspect of the women's liberation movement of continued

interest.

Members of the YSA-TCG have in the past, expressed

interest in the support of women's liberation as a matter of

policy.

The anti-abortion, or so called legal abortion

movement, is one aspect of this women's liberatión movement

which continues to be of concern to members of the YSA-TCG,

both male and female.

While the vast majority of women in

the State of Minnesota support either the repeal or changes

in present state laws on abortion, supporters of this repeal

or change also include professional women, medical doctors,

lawyers, municipal court judges, and individuals from all

walks of life.

National Movement of Independent Groups throughout the US

who favored legalized abortions

and to end restrictive con-

traception laws and forced sterilization. National and NY

State staff offices located 150 5th Avenue, NYC, NY. WONAAC

does not maintain formal membership, and funds obtained

Source

advised February, 1972, that as result of de-escalation,

Vietnam War, YSA-NYL plans to concentrate in area of

Women's Liberation Movement through influence in WONAAC.

Activities of WONAAC dutifully reported at regular mem

bership meetings YSA-NYu during period March, 1972, through

October, 1972. CAROL EATON, National Staff Member, advised

under pretext in November, 1972, SWP/YSA influence not now

significant, and WONAAC has always accepted help from

whatever source offered.

WONAAC International Tribunal

DETAILS:

Investigation in this case is predicated upon

receipt of information in July, 1971, from NY T-I, alleging

in New York City (NYC), details of which will be set out

more fully hereinafter.

As the youth organization of the

SWP, the YSA serves as the main

source of recruitment into that

organization.

The YSA is described

in the masthead of its official

publication, "The Young Socialist

Organizer", as "a Multi-National

Revolutionary Socialist Youth

Organization"

The SWP has been designated pur-

suant to Executive Order 10450.

I .

ORGANIZATIONAL DATA

A. Origin and Scope

NY T-2 on July 21, 1971, and NY I-3 on October 1,

1971, furnished information that over 1,000 women met in

conference at Columbla University, NYC, NY, on July 16;

1971, through July 18, 1971, to form a National Movement

of independent groups scattered throughout the United

States (US) who favored and had worked to legalize abortion.

As a result of this conference, WONAAC was founded.

B. Aims and Purposes

In the WONAAC national newsletter, dated September 16,

1971, WONAAC was self-described as a nationally coordina-

ted abortion law repeal campaign including legislation;

legal action, and nationally coordinated mass demonstrations

in Washington, DC, and San Francisco, on November 20, 1971,

for the repeal of all anti-abortion laws and corollary

demands of no forced sterilization, and the repeal of all

restrictive contraception laws.

WONAAC claims to reach

all women, black; Chinaca; Latina; Asian; Puerto Rican;

native American women; campus women; gay women; high

school women; housewives; professional, welfare, and

working women; young women; women from churches, political

organizations, trade unions, the military, and communities

across the country:

C. Headquarters

On November 22, 1972, a Special Agent (SA) of

the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), utilizing a

pretext, contacted an individual self-identified as CAROL

EATON at telephone number 675-9150, located at 150 5th

Avenue, NYC, NY.

National Staff member of WONAAC, advised that the National

and NY Staffs of WONAAC are headquartered at this address

D. When Meetings Held

According to CAROL EATON, regular NY Coalition

meetings of WONAAC are held every other Wednesday evening

at Religious Center at New York University, 2 Washington

Square North, NYC, NY. EATON stated that most MY State

staff members are

present at these meetings and at least

one or more National Staff members also try to be in

attendance.

Other than this, state and national staffs

meet periodically, as business demands.

E. Officers

EATON identified the following individuals as

current officers of WONAAC:

National Staff

National Coordinator

SUSAN LAMONT

(MARTENANARKUS, NY

CAROIXEATON

NY State Staff Wel

Coordinator

NY 100-174481

F.

Membership and Finances

According to EATON, WONAAC does not maintain a

formal membership, as such,

and financially exists only

through voluntary contributions.

She stated that all

staff memöers, National and NY State, serve on a voluntary

basis, receive no salary, and get only a small "subsistance

allowance" which the staff has found necessary to supplement

with their own personal funds in order to get by.

G.

WONAAC Affiliates

CAROL EATON stated there are presently 36 WONAAC

affiliates, also called "coalitions" throughout the us, and

that most states of the union are represented by an affiliate

or coalition.

II.

YSA-SWP INFLUENCE AND CONTROL

OVER WONAAC

NY T-1 provided information on July 22, 1971,

that the First National Womens Abortion Conference was

held at Columbia University, NYC, NY, from July 16, 1971,

to July 18, 1971, which resulted in the founding of WONAAC.

NY I-1 stated that it was immediately apparent that this

conference was taken over and influenced by YSA-SWP members

who infiltrated the various conference committees and

workshops which were established to help formulate the

main direction the Coalition would follow in the future.

NY T-I stated that it seemed certain the YSA-SWP would,

in the future, dictate policy for this organization and

would be able

to control the utilization of WoNAAC funds.

On August 5, 1971, NY I-4 provided a leaflet

captioned, "What Every Woman Should Know". This leaflet,

which was

published by Feminist Organization for Communi-

cation; Action and Service (F.O.C.A.S.), related the following:

"The

• Womens National Abortion Coalition has

been called and organized by the Swe and its aftiliate,

the YSA, including women supposedly representing Women's

Liberation groups, who in truth represent, first, the

4

NW 68262 Docld:32989545 Page 447

---

## Page 448

NY 100-174481

SWP and YSA. These women attach more importance to their

political movement than to the Women's Liberation Movement.

And when 77% of the women in this country are for reform

of abortion laws, there is fertile soil for a political:

party to build itself on. The SWP/YSA realizes this and

is taking advantage of it."

On August 5, 1971, a leaflet

captioned "F.0.C.A.S." revealed

in part as follows:

"A nucleus of about eight feminists

have formed FOCAS, Feminist

Organization for Communication,

Action anâ Service.

FOCAS evolved

from the Women's Strike Coalition

(WSC), which the Socialist Workers

Party abruptly abandoned on May

25th in order to form the committee

for WONAAC.

Since that time a

nucleus of women from WSC together

with like-minded feminists pre-

served the WSC in order to main-

tain and expand a multi-issue

action-oriented Women's Libera~

tion coalition in the NYC area.

Assisted by loans from supporting

feminists, the new WSC paid

back nearly a thousand of the

three thousand dollars of debts

incurred by the SWP women who

had controlled the old wSC.

The "Militant" issue of August 6, 1971, page five,

in an article entitled, "Abortion Campaign Counters Red-

Baiting", revealed in part, with respect to the founding

WONAAC conference in July, 1971:

"The Militant" is a weekly news-

paper of the SWP.

"There were many members of the SWP and YSA at the

conference, and SWers and YSAers are among those who

have worked most consistently for

NY I-5 advised on November 12, 1971, that a Ny

Planning Meeting of WONAAC was held at LOIB Student Center,

NY University, NY, on November 11, 1971, to lay plans

for a scheduled November 20, 1971

demonstration in Washington,

According to this source, this meeting was completely

dominated

and controlled by members of the SWP.

NY I-6 related on November 16, 1971, that the Upper

West Side Branch of the YSA planned to send a

contingent

of its members to Washington, DC, on November 20, 1971,

in order to participate in the planned demonstration there

on that date. •

NY I-6 stated that practically all the members of the

uptown branch of the YSA, NY, were expected to participate

in this activity.

NY I-5 related on January 20, 1972, that the scheduled

November 20, 1971 march in Washington was "crucial" to

all SWP and YSA branches in that it afforded an opportunity

for selling of "The Militant"

and other SWP/YSA literature,

and also afforded an opportunity for "intervening " in the

action via distribution of SWP Election Campaign literature.

NY T-8 on February 11, 1972, and NY T-9 and NY T-10

on February 14, 1972, provided information that a WONAAC

convention was held February 11, 1972, to February 13, 1972,

. at Hayden Hall, Boston University, Boston, Mässachusetts.

The general theme of this convention was

"How to Win

Abortion Law Repeal". NY I-8 stated that approximately

30 members of the YSA or SWP Boston Chapters were observed.

in attendance at this convention.

NY I-7 related on February 14, 1972, that because of the

de-escalation of the Vietnam War by the NIXON

Administration,

6

NW 68262 Docld:32989545 Page 449

## Page 450

NY 100÷174481

Committee (SMC) and NY National Peace Action Coalition

(NPAC), both of which organizations they dominate, would

also concentrate in the area of the Women's Liberation

Movement through their influence in WONAAC.

The SMC is controlled by the

SWP and its youth affiliate,

YSA.

SMC initiates and supports

public demonstrations against

the war in Southeast Asia.

NAC was founded in 1970 by

members of the SWP.

Its objec-

tive is the immediate, total

and unconditional withdrawal

of all US forces and material

in Southeast Asia.

NY I-7 advised on various dates, March 23, 1972,

through October 17, 1972, that activities of WONAAC were

dutifully reported

and included on the agenda at regular

meetings of the Upper West Side Branch, YSA-New York Local

(NYL) during that period.

NY T-5 advised on April 18, 1972, that the leader-

ship of WONAAC was then dominated by the SWP.

NY I-7 related on July 7, 1972, that at a WONAAC

meeting held June 27, 1972, at 706 Broadway, NYC, NY,

starting at 6:40 PM, it was announced that even though

WONAAC previously had accused various female activists

working along with them in the Women's Liberation struggle

of red baiting because of the stand they had taken against

the SWP-Young Socialist Alliance (YSA), at present they

forced to work with these individuals to help strengthen

the WONAAC cause.

At this meeting, certain WONAAC StalI members

walked out and voiced their disapproval of the meeting

being taken over by a majority of SWP-YSA members.

They indicated that the SWP-YSA has no right to be in a

policy-making position in WONAAC.

7

NW 68262 Docld:32989545 Page 450

## Page 451

NY 100-174481

NY T-7 on July 18, 1972, and NY I-ll on July 19,

1972, provided information that a WONAAC conference was

held at Hunter College, Park Avenue and 69th Street on

July 15, 1972 and July 16, 1972.

NY T-7 stated that NYC was picked as the site of

this convention because this city is considered to be

the center of the most powerful anti-abortion effort so far.

Discussionsheld at this conference centered on

plans for (one)-future activity in the campaign to repeal

all anti-abortion and contraception laws and (two)-to

end forced sterilization.

•A discussion was held concerning the attacks

being made by the Catholic Church Hierarchy and other

anti-abortion groups against women's rights to their own

bodies:

NY T-11 related that the evening plenary session

Of WONAAC occurred on July 15, 1972, and it was immediately

apparent that the SWP-YSA groups dominated the meeting.

Independent women who wanted to make statements during

this session were voted down by SW 'floor leaders and

these same persons continued to vote as a block on all

issues.

The group of independent women from various

geographic areas, that is, those women who were not

associated with the SWP or YSA, went together after the

plenary session was adjourned and considered the problem

of how to handle the SWP leaders.

While these women

were not political realists in their goals, they did

believe in working throughout the existing system rather

than functioning with the SWP in their eventual goal of

revolution.

It was decided that the independent feminists

would no longer continue hassling within WONAAC.

They

did not want to have decisions for them being structured

by a male dominated group.

They also decided that money

being collected by WONAAC in the name of abortion law

NY 100-174481

change was not being used for that purpose, but rather

to sustain members of the SWP-YSA.

The Sunday morning session, July 16, 1972, was

labeled "Meeting to Discuss Internal Hassles.

About 35

independents attended and a few number of SWP-YSA members

and sympathizers were present. Independents there were

from New Haven, Boston, Detroit, New York (NÝ), Chicago,

Philadelphia,

and San Francisco.

The independents did not waiver in their firm

opposition to SWP-YSA control of WONAAC. Six national

coordinators of WONAAC were independents and decided to

resign publicly at the afternoon plenary session.

also decided to combat SWP control of the feminist move-

ment through the various publications.

JUDY SIPHERS, San Francisco; ANN C DAVIDSON, Philadelphia

ROSEYWEBER, NY; VICKIESLINGER, Columbia, South Carolina;

NANCY, ROLE, NY; and ELLENASHAPIRO, NY.

There were approximately 700-800 women in atten-

dance at the afternoon session.

According to one of the

SWP leaders, these women were from 31 states and three

countries-Canada, Italy and Sweden.

The states that had

more representation than others were Onlo, Illinois, New

York and Massachusetts.

Most of the problems and differences between the

independents and the SWP centered around approaches to

abortion law reform. The SWP was charged with always

having demonstrations and rallies and never doing any

work through the legislative process.

The independents stated that they were tired of

this hassle and that they believed there were more ef-

fective ways to change abortion laws than carrying placards

in the streets.

NY 100-174481

After the independent women publicly resigned in

ront of the plenary session, two other coordinators announcec

they were staying

on.

One was BARBARAXROBERTS, the other's

name is unknown.

EDER OF SUBJECT CECANISATION

MANDER OF SUBJECI COALITION

LINDA JENNESS made a final plea for the indepen-

dent women to reconsider.

The removal of the independents

from WONAAC has debilitated the organization and most

independent, representatives will be going back to their

own cities to work for abortion law change in organizations

which have no connection with the SWP.

The concern still exists, however, that WONAAC will

be able to collect monies in the name of abortion reform

and there is also the concern that women new to the move-

mond sh m

ment will join in a mistaken notion that they will be

furthering abortion law reform.

Independents vowed before leaving NY that they

would try to publicize activities from the SWP in an

effort to prevent this.

III. OBSERVATION OF CURRENT NATIONAL

STAFF MEMBER REGARDING YSA/SWP INFLUENCE

When contacted under pretext on November 24,

Staff member, and previously mentioned in this report,

related that she has been

inception. EATON, While averring in wovAAc since its

she is definitely not a

YSA, SWP, or member of any "radical group",

acknowleaged

there always have been SWP, YSA and "radical" elements

in WONAAC.

She went on to state, however, that WONAAC

has never allied itself politically with any organization

or individual, including any of the political candidates

in the recent

political election and, despite its diverse

makeup as too ideological beliefs of its membership,

WONAAC is basically an organization which strives only

to the objectives for which it was originally founded.

To this end, she went on, WONAAC would accept help from

whatever source offered.

NY 100-174481

EATON admitted there were some problems in

the past with regard to friction within WONAAC about SWP

and YSA influence.

She stated, however, this matter, to

her observation, never seemed a serious one,

and is quite

minimal today.

With regard to the "walk out" of six

national coordinators at the July, 1972 conference in NYC,

she stated the walk out did not occur, in fact, because:

of the SWP/YSA influence question, but rather because

those who walked out believed WONAAC should be a "referral

agency"*

, while those who stayed felt it should not.

By

referral agency, EATON statedshe means an agency which would refer

callers to a specific location or place where abortions

could be obtained:

IV. PLANNED PROJECTS

CAROL EATON advised that WONAAC plans an inter-

national Tribunal march to be held in NYC, NY, from March 9, •

1972, to March 11, 1972. She stated plans have not yet been

finalized, including the exact location or site this event

will take place.

However, she noted that SIMONE/BEAUVOIR,

a Parisian, well known in the Women's Liberation Movement,

would be honorary chairwoman.

WOMEN'S NATIONAL ABORTION

ACTION COALITION (WONAAC)

During the latter part of february, 1973, a confidential

source, who has furnished reliable information in the past,

advised that the Washington, D.C. (WDC) Chapter of the Women's

National Abortion Action Coalition (D.C. WONAAC) is scheduled

to participate in an "International Woman's Day Solidarity

Meeting"

scheduled to be held in New York City, New York on

Saturaay, March 10, 1973, place to be announced.

The national office of WONAAC is located at

150 Fifth Avenue, New York City, New York.

WONAAC goals are

self-defined as

"working

on a national scale to make abortion legal,

to end restrictive contraception laws, and

to end forced sterilization."

According to the above source, a flyer distributed

by D.C. WONAAC disclosed that among those individuals

scheduled to speak at the meeting are; GISELE HALIMI, described

as a leader of "Choisir," a French abortion rights organization;

MICHELE CHEVALIER, described as a defendent in a French abortion

trial; and CLAUDE

SERVAN SCHREIBER, described as

a feminist

journalist and as a leader of "Choisir".

According to the above source, members of the

WDC Locals of the Young Socialist Alliance (YSA) and the

Socialist Workers Party (SWP) have been urged to participate

in the International Womans Day Solidarity Meeting•

As the youth organization of the SWP, the

YSA serves as the main source of recruitment

into that organization.

The YSA is

described in the masthead of its official

publication "The Young Socialist Organizer",

as "A multinational revolutionary socialist

youth organization."

The SWP has been designated pursuant to

Executive Order 10450.

RePElet 2/28/73.

The Women's National Abortion Action Coalition (HONAAC)

has been

the subject oi a separate investigation by the Bureau

in nunerous offices.

In referenced letter, Philadelphia pointed

out that WONAAC represents a lasic social change desling with

abortion rights and that in view of the fact the U.S. Supreme

Court upheld the right of abortion, the continued investigation

Di WONAAC at this tine does not appeaz to be desirable and

should ba discontinued. Philadelphia also suggested that

continued investigation of the Socialist Workers Party (SMP)

2 to 304918

and its youth group, the Young Socialist Alliance (YSA), should

determine pertinent activities of MONAAC.

After caraiul consideration of this ratter, the Bureau

agrees with the observations oi the Philadelphia Office that the

investigation of WONAAC should

be discontinued.

However, in view

pursuant to Executive Order 10450, it is the responsibility of the

Bureau to investigate and report pertinent information relating

to the extent of STiP domination and control of captioned

organization.

Therefore, recipients should close separate

investigations concerning WONAAC.

In the future, report above-

described information regarding WONAAC under appropriate subheading

The case file of captioned organization has been

In view of the fact that woNAC represents basically

a social change vehicle dealing with the single issue of

abortion rights and the fact that a recent U. S. Supreme

the political value of this issue, it would appear that a

must be conducted in a most discreet manner and limited

to established sources.

No action is to be taken by you

"Throughout history few things have been more

universal or known fewer national boundaries than the .

suffering.of women from the denial of our right to control

of the United States took inspiration from their British sisters

and went on to build part. of. the international movement

through, which women won the. right to vote, ciatise, iral.

atrial Today, in every corner of the earth, laws deny

women the right to abortion, the right to decide whether of

not to have children.. Now a new generation of women has

begun to stand up for our rights.

The struggle for the

right to abortion is rapidly crossing boundaries of nations

and continents, of language and background. We have inspired

one another and learned fron one another. s:.':.

"The coalition, which comprises about 30 women's

•groups, will also demonstrate against forced

sterilization

and restrictive contraception laws and plans to hold

national abortion hearings in Washington before the march."

First source advised on October 15, 1971, that the

November 20, 1971, rally. has received mixed

support from

various Washington, D. C., women:'s liberation groups.

Several radical vomen's groups refused to endorse the November

20, 1971, action because they view it as a Young Socialist

•Alliance (YSA) /Socialist Workers Party (SVP) Front which will

use these rallies to further its own recruitment drive.

Furthermore, they considered YSA/SWP to be "non-feminist".

Main support for the November 20, 1971, demonstration will come

from the WSA Women's Fraction Group.

Subcommittees of the JRB have been meeting in the

headquarters of WSP at 5899 West Pico Boulevard, and WIA at

5009 West Pico Boulevara, Los Angeles. During the most

recent of these subcommittee meetings, held during the first

week in January 1968, at the latter location, much of the

discussion was related to proposed action in Southern California

by women who would be unable to travel to washington, D. C.s

for the January 15th confrontation with Congress.

Minor changes in the previously announced schedule

of local activities for January 15, 1968, were agreed upon

at this meeting, as follows:

Old California State Building,

First and Broadway, Los Angeles.

women willing to go to prison if necessary, that would

end

it.

You cannot have wars without women."

JEANNETTE RANKIN

HELENA, MONTANA

November 27, 1967

TO ALL AMERICAN WOMEN,

I am proud of the fact that my first vote cast in Congress

was a vote against war. It was the first opportunity for a

woman to vote because I was the first woman to be elected

to Congress.

I believed then as I do today that women are the ones who

must be concerned with the needs and development of the

human race. I have always fought for the dignity of all

human beings -- for those of the present as well as those

of future generations.

I will continue to struggle as long as I live.

I hope all women will respond to the following CALL, and

join me in Washington on January 8, 1968, the opening

day of Congress.

With highest hopes,

of the problems of our crisis-ridden society by seriously working for

job-training, eliminating poverty and discrimination, and conducting

a massive campaign against racism and bigotry in our schools,

governmental agencies, or wherever it appears.

Women constitute 51% of the American electorate. 1968 is an election year. If

we devote ourselves wholeheartedly to it, we can force the administration to

End the War, and to change our foreign policies; to restore our nation to a

position of honor in the community of nations; to reshape American society

Dear WSPER:

fomen Strike for Peace nationally is suoporting the Jeannette Rankin Brigade.

Planelois, trainloads and carloads of women will be coming into Washington on Mon-

day, January 15th, from all over the country.

'le are particularly pleased with this action because it represents for the first

time a real coalition of women's peace groups, church groups; theatre personalities, .

and community leaders.

The Day is envisioned

as a solemn, dignified confrontation of those who should be

representing the ever growing opposition to the war. We ask that you write your Con-

gressnen urging that they support the four points listed in the enclosed Call as Con

gress reconvenes.

Later in the afternoon at our Women's Congress we want to be able to

report on Congressional responses.

We will all meet at Union Station in Washington at 11:30 AM and slowly walk to the

Capitol. We ask the women to wear black.

We will be led by Jeannette Rankin who will

croceed to the top of the Capitol steps with a representative delegation of 50 women to

resent our petition io the two men who represent the whole of Congress, Senator Mike

ansfield and Speaker of the House McCormack. The delegation will read the demands be

ore the assembled women and the two Congressmen. Leaving the Hill, the women will enter

puses for a motorcade to a Congress of American Women (place to be announced). . Women

pill present an analysis of the current crisis on the war front and the domestic fxont,

-eading to suggestions for program and actions to be taken back to our communities for

Lementation.

Women may choose to remain in Washington the next day to meet with their Congressmen.

I you wish to stay and wish help in securing accommodations, contact the hospitality com

ittee, 2140 P. St. NoW. Washington, DC (293-2020). We regret that in order to get the

owest

train fare we had to guarantee return the same day; therefore you would have to

inance your own trip back on the 16th.

Our hope is that 10,000 women will converge upon Washington. We urge you to parti

ipate.

Yours for Peace,

Ethel Taylor

antiwar groups mobilized

against the war in Veitnam.

As the cost of the war in lives

and money mounts daily, the

women of this. country call upon

congress to take action against

it.

To support the senators and

• Congressmen who oppose the war,

to encourage those who are troubled

but silent, to speak out, and to

make our position known to those

who still support this immoral

war, we, as women of Hawaii, are

gathered here.

Our message to

Reps. Mink and, Matsunaga, to

Sens. Fong and Inouye, is that

women will no longer give their sons and loved ones to a government

waging a genocidal war...

women will no longer accept a government which represents a military

and industrial machine rather than its people...

women will no

longer consent to raise their children in the blight

and neglect of a society geared to profit and war...

women grieve for suffering people all over the world and will no longer

remain silent while the gap widens between the rich and the poor...

We ask our government to design and carry out a domestic program

commensurate with the needs of the American people; to foltow a

policy of non-intervention in the affairs of other countries; to

pursue our official committment to disarmament, and to respect

international law.

American women who, as women everywhere, are the bearers and conservers

of life, will not stand ídly by as life is destroyed in our name.

About two hundred Oahu women have signed the following petition to

Congress:

As Congress reconvenes, we urge that its first order of business

be to put an end to the war in Vietnam and arrange for the withdrawal

of

American troops; and that the Congress turn its attention to

ametiorating the crisis in America.

We urge the Congress to heal a sick society at home, to make reparations

for the ravaged land we leave behind in Vietnam and to refuse to

listen to the insatiable demands of the military-industrial complex.

Information has previously been disseminated

to the White House and other interested agencies concerning

the plans of captioned organization, a nationwide group of

women who are opposed to the war in Vietnam, to stage a

demonstration in Washington, D.C. on 1/15/68 and present a

petition to Congress demanding

an end to the Vietnam war.

This demonstration was held as scheduled on 1/15/68.

The demonstrators marched from Union Station to

Union Square at the foot of Capitol Hill by way of Louisiana

Avenue.

The group was

preceded by several individuals

Crisis at Home."

Several women followed the marchers

carrying another banner which

read "United States Women

Unite, End the War in Vietnam." Initially, the group carried

other

placards which read "End the War" and "LBJ Eats

Imperial Margarine."

However,

at the request of authorities,

these placards were discarded.

Before the demonstrators left Union Station, a

delegation of 15 women, including Jeannette Rankin, drove

to the Capitol where they presented a petition to

Representative John W. McCormack, Speaker of the House of

Representatives, and to Senator

Michael J. Mansfield.

The

petition entitled "A Petition to the 90th

Congress" pointed

out the opposition of women of the United States to the

ruthless slaughter in Vietnam and the persistantneglect to

human needs at home and demanded Congress as the first order

of business resolve to end the

war in Vietnam and immediately

withdraw all America troops.

It called for Congress to use its

power to help a sick society at home, to make

reparations for

destruction in Vietnam and to listen

to what the American people

are saying and refuse the insatiable demands of the military

industrial complex.

the need for education in order

to change: United States policy and stated that their demonstra

JANUARY 15, 1968

Chairman of the Brigade, announced to the demonstrators that this

local demonstration was principally gathered to support women

from around the United States who were gathered in Washington,

D.C. today, as part of a nation-wide demonstration sponsored by

the Jeannette Rankin Brigade, to petition Congress to resolve

the conflict in Vietnam.

Bridges stated that inasmuch as it

was

not possible for the demonstrators to personally contact

their congressmen,

most of whom were out of town; that following

the presentation of a petition to Mayor Joseph Alioto, the

demonstrators would then proceed to the Western Union Office on

10th and Market Streets

in San Francisco, so that the women

protestors could send wires to their congressmen, protesting

United States policies in Vietnam.

Bridges indicated that the

petitioners would request Mayor Alioto to convey to Congress.

their petition, which among other things urged Congress, as its

first order of business, to resolve to end the War in Vietnam and

immediately arrange for

withdrawal of all American troops from

Vietnam; for Congress to use its power to heal the sick society

at home

and to make reparations for the ravaged lands left

behind in Vietnam.

Approximately ten minutes later the Mayor of

San Francisco appeared on the steps of the City Hall and announced

to the demonstrators that he would gladly transmit their

Mayor Alioto stated that he fully

believed in the constitutional right of peaceful assemdLy.

He indicated, however, that because he had consented to

transmit the demonstrators' petition to Washington, he did not

necessarily agree with it.

The Mayor then stated that it

was his personal opinion that the United States Government and

the Johnson Administration had done all in its power, to attempt

to come to a peaceful and honorable solution in the Vietnamese

War. He related that he felt that it was now up to the other

side to make the same attempts to arrive at a

peaceful solution

in the Vietnamese conflict.

At approximately 12:45 p.m., the demonstrators proceeded

to the Western Union Office located at l0th and Market Streets

in San Francisco, so that wires could be sent to their congressmen

in Washington.

A Special Agent of the fBl observed one blaine

Yoneda. participating in the above demonstration and following

the demonstration Yoneda was observed to return to her employment

at the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union

(ILWU) - Pacific Maritime Association, Pension Fund, at 150

Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco.

A second source advised on December 4, 1967, that

Elaine Yoneda is a current and active member of the Communist

Party (CP).

On January 15, 1968, a Special Agent of the FBI

observed a silent protest by a group of women on the lawn

of Colton Hall, Monterey, California, between 3:00 and 5:00 p.m.

These women were ostensibly gathered

to support the demonstration

being held in Washington, D.C., sponsored by the Jeannette Rankin

Brigade.

There were no speeches given; the demonstrators merely

conducted

a silent vigil.

A one page leaflet captioned "Women To Take First

Step to End The War" printed by the Jeannette Rankin Brigade,

at 150 Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco, California, was handed

out at the above demonstration.

A Xeroxed duplication of this

leaflet is appended to this memorandum.

Re: DEMONSTRATION PROTESTING UNITED

WASHINGTON; D. C.,

JANUARY 15, 1968

INFORMATION CONCERNING

Reference is made to a memorandum,

captioned as above, dated December 28,

1967, at Miami, Florida. The memorandum

concerned a call issued by the Jeannette

Rankin Brigade for American Women to travel

to Washington, D. C. on January 15, 1968,

to petition the United States Congress to

end the war in Viet Nam.

A source, on January 15, 1968, advised that the Miami

Chapter of the Women's International League for Peace and

Freedom (WILPF) had scheduled a demonstration to take place

January 15, 1968, at Miami, Florida.

The demonstration

would be a

support activity for the

Jeannette Rankin Brigade

that would be in Washington, D. C. on that date to petition

Congress to end the war in Viet Nam.

The January 16, 1968, Issue of

the "Miami Herald,"

a local Miami, Florida

newspaper, contained an article entitled

"Five Thousand Women Join Viet lar Protest."

The article identified Jeanette Rankin

as an 87 year old wonan pacifist and

former member of Congress who voted in

Congress against the American entry into

both world wars.

A Special Agent of the Federal Bureau of Investi-

gation (FBI) on January 15, 1968, observed an anti-war

demonstration take place in Miami, Florida. Approximately

70 participants, mostly elderly women, assembled at the

Torch of Friendship, Bayfront Park, downtown Miami, at

2:00 p.m. They stood in silent vigil, some wearing black

slogans:

"Peace Throughout the Earth"

"We Demand An End To The War In Viet Nam Immediately"

"Peace On Earth. Good Will To All Men"

"Join Our Silent Vigil For Peace In Viet Nam"

"Vietnamese Are Our Brothers Whom We Kill"

"For A World Without War"

"We Pause To Remember Our Brothers Who Gave Their

Lives In Viet Nam"

Literature distributed identified the sponsor of

the demonstration as the "Women's International League for

Peace and Freedom" (see attached xerox copy) :

The participants, following the vigil, continued

their demonstration by walking in single file with the

anti-war signs through the downtown city streets to the

Federal Building where they dispersed at 3:15 p.m.

No incidents were observed to occur.

Source also advised that at least six people from

greater Miami had considered traveling to Washington, D. C.

to participate in the demonstration in that city being

sponsored by the Jeannette Rankin Brigade although no firm

plans had been made. Among these individuals was Greta

/Lynch.

A second source in April, 1951, advised

that Greta Lynch that year stated she

had been expelled from the Communist party.

Sources utilized in this memorandum have furnished

reliable information

in the past.

on Monday, January 15, 1968, Special Agents of the

Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)

Portland Office observed

approximately forty women conducting a peaceful silent pick-

eting demonstration on the sidewalk counter clockwise around

the block encompassing the Pioneer Branch, U.S. Post Office

(USPO), 520 S.l. Morrison Street, Portland, Oregon, from noon

to 1:00 p.M.

The majority of women were middle aged, wore

back clothing, carried Dlack umbrellas and some carried signs

with wording,

"No More War" and "The Women's Vote is a Vote

for Peace".

Three women representing the black community wero

also scheduled to fly to Washington from the Southern

attornia iRs committee they were bobbie hoagesarthea

and Glory Roberts. Two women affiliated with

the peace ortented Pasadena Chapter of the Women's International

League for Peace and Freedom; Cathy Hofer and Marian Beardsley,

were also to join the above

women for the flight to washington,

according to Source One.

On January 15, 1968, Special Agents of the Los Angeles

Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation observed a

group of women assemble in front of the Old State Bullding, 217

West First Street (First and Broadway, in the downtown Civic

Center), Los Angeles, Califomia, at

approximately 9:30 AM.

The women were carrying placards indicating they were the

local representation of the JRB. They also had two leaflets

for distribution (Xerox copies of which are appended

to this

memorandum) which called for women to participate and which

indicated that a voting block of American women had the power

to put an ena to the war in Vietnam.

These leaflets bore the

address of the JRB as 5899 West Pico Boulevard, Los Angeles,

California (90019), which is the address of the headquarters of

the WSP in Southern California.

Starting shortly after 10:00 AM, the women proceeded

to hold a rally on the south steps of the Old State Building,

with the

speakers utilizing an electronic amplification system,

which was' held by actress Leslie Parrish.

Source One indicated that Parrish had originally been

scheduled to fly to washington, D. C., to participate in the

JRB action at the Capitol, but

changed her plans at the last

minute. In order to remain in Los Angeles.

The rally was headed by Tima Tomash, who acted as

the local URb organizer and answered some of the questions

regarding the JPB from members of the news media on the scene.

Veronica Sissons, acted as mistress of ceremonies. Speakers

Included Mary Henry. Negro civil rights and poverty worker;

(who has been identifled by Sources One and

active in recent months in disturbances at Manual Arts High

School, Los Angeles, which resulted in a court injunction to

prohibit her entering those school grounds); and television

actress Ellen Micrae.

The speakers all called for a coalition

of women to form a strong voting block which could produce

legislation to end the war In Vietnam, end poverty and "legislated

Injustice"

At 10:50 AM, the women marched to the steps on the

First Street side of the Los Angeles City Hall for a second

rally.

A count made as the demonstrators marched between the

Old State Building and the City Hall revealed that 250

adult Caucasians (majority of whom were women dressed in

black), and eight non-Caucasian adults were involved, plus

The mother of one of the children

had a cardboard sign, depicting a bomb and the caption, "I'm

Glad I'm Not Vietnamese"

strapped to the back of her son who

appeared to be less than

four years of age.

With Veronica Sissons again acting as mistress of / y

ceremonies; the rally was addressed by Chamlobte Sherman,

Margaret Wright, Tima Tomash, and Jily Schary.

The latteri

was introduced as a radio commentator employed by Los Angeles

Radio Station KUAC.

She joined the others in calling for a

coalition of women

• to influence legislation and bring an end to

the war in Vietnam. She also called for support of other "liberal

radio broadcasters on our side"

, one of whom she named as

William Winter.

(The "Daily People's World"

, west coast

communist newspaper, in its edition oi June 11, 1940,

described

William Winter as chairman of a local citizens!

committee to

safeguard the Joint Anti-Fascist Reîuge Committee, which

organization has been cited pursuant to Executive

Order 10450).

Charlotte Sherman was introduced as the wife of : .

i:: " Laurence Sherman,

it being pointed out that he was an

- -

unsuccessful

candidate for public office, on a peace slate,

during 1967; but that both he and his wife were continuing

the

fight for an end to the war in Vietnan.

She said,

"It is time.

for us to re-examine our role. as women.

Women are a vehicle

We will not be a vehicle for perpetuation

them.

Margaret Wright stated that wherees the majority of

women in the demonstration were wearing black to denote mourning,

that she and her non-caucasian associates who feel,

"Black is

beautiful" were dressed in white to indicate their

attitude of

mouring. She called for the elimination of ROIC (Reserve

Officers Training Corps) from local high schools and junior

colleges, adding,

"They have got to get

live bullets out of the

schools,

and get

some live teachers in."

She repeated these

same statements during the afternoon when the JRB moved to

the Los Angeles City Board of Education.

As the rally was

breaking up, wright grabbed the

public address system and

said that it had been learned that

the City Council was in session inside the City Hall Building.

She urged the women not to disperse, but to join her and...

others in invading the City Council Chambers with a demand

that the JRB be allowed to speak to the Council even though

they had not made previous arrangements for a place on the

agenda that day.

Some of the women were already out of range

of the public address system and did not hear this announcement

by Wright, having already been dismissed by. Sissons and told to

reconvene at the Board of Education following luncheon.

Approximately 200 of the demonstrators did enter

the Council Chambers. They got word to the councilmen, through

one of the staff members, that they wished to be heard.

room, Tima Tomash rushed

to the front shouting demands that

city legislators.

During. the noon hour some of the women distributed.

leaflets in the City Hall and on the surrounding streets in

the downtown Civic Center.

At 1:00 PM, the womén,

whose numbers had by that

time been reduced to 125, massed in the patio of the. Los

Angeles City Board of Education, 450 North Grand Avenue,

Los Angeles. Sissons, Wright and Tomash addressed-the

assembled demonstrators, pointing out that money spent in

Vietnam could be better spent in education.

Wright claimed

that many of the so-called student "arop-outs" are in reality

"push-outs"

, claiming that she herseli was one of the latter.

She said,

"we need books, not bomos.

We know this is

a racist

war and

we blacks are.not going to fight a racist war"

indicated that rather than fight overseas, the black people

would remain at home and fight the racists. She also said,

"Just because I'm pro-plack doesn't necessarily mean I'm anti-.

white."

Wright said, "I'm not political, but I am honest. I

can't honestly get up and say the pledge

of allegiance to

the

American flag, because I really don't have llberty and justice;

so I just get up and stand and won't repeat the pledge.

Later, when she observed a photograph of President Johnson

hanging from a wall in the Administration Building at the

Los Angeles City Board of Education, she told the JRB women

with her, "

"We shouldn't have to look at such pornographic

pictures.

Wright said that her arrest at the hands of Los

Angeles City Concol Security Officers, during the recent.

Manual Arts High School disturbance,

had at least one bright

result. She said that at the time of her arrest it had been

hall as she was too heavy for then to carry. Then she added

that excuse as she has lost thirty pounds in the meantime.

The speeches in the patio ended at 1:30 PM and many

of the women leit immediately.

Seventy-eight women remained

and attempted to enter a special committee meeting being attended

by some of the School Board members.

They were inforned by a

member of the administrative staff-that the public meeting of the

School Board would not be held until 4:00 PM, the regularly

scheduled meeting time.. The women milled around in the hallway

outside the meeting room, until finally a staff member came

out

and told them that two members of the School Board, Reverend

James E. Jones and Dr. Julian. Nava, had agreed to grant them

an

audience. The women were then ushered into the public board

room of the School Board where they waited until 2:00 PM at

which time the above-named Board members granted the demonstrators

a short audience and answered some questions put to them by the

One question, as to how much longer the members of the

School Board were going to permit recruiters from the armed

forces to interview students at local- high schools and junior

colleges remained unanswered, but Dr. Nava pointed out to the

women that he had seen nothing wrong in entering the armed

forces to fight for this country himself when he vas 17 years

of age, and he could see nothing wrong in other young men who

wanted to do the same today. The demonstration was concluded

by 3:00 PM. There were no incidents and no arrests.

Placards carried during this demonsuration in los

Angeles bore the following captions:

-"Eat Texas Beef, Not L.B.J. Baloney"

"Woman Power is Vote Power is Peace Power"

"Draft Beer Not Students"

"Where Have All the Men Gone-To Graveyards"

"Jeannette Rankin Brigade-Women's Votes Count, End

In the

same house report.

"The Southern Patriot" was cited

as an "organ" of the scil.

An amendment to the charter of the SCHw dated

April 26, 1946, changed its name to the Southern Conference

Educational Fund, Incorporated (SCEF) and stated'its purpose

of SCEr, editorial and business offices of which are

located

at 3210 West Broadway, Louisville, kentucky,

Eastern office of which is locared at Suite 412, 799

Broadway, New York City. New York.

"The southern Patriot"

is published once each month, except, Tuly. See? is stated

to be dedicated to ending discrimination based on race,

creed, color, sex, national origin or economic condition.

Carl Braden

is identifzed as Executive Director

o1 SCEr and Anne Braden

as editor of "the Southern Patriot."

Alberta Ahearn, 2311 Payne Street, Louisville,

nentucky, a seli-admitted tormer member of the communist

SCEF (Continued)

continued as an independent organization, rallying support

for integration and democracy and helping to stimulate

and nurture new movements of the early 1960's. The SCEF

maintained headquarters in Louisiana for twenty years, but

in 1966 moved its headquarters to Louisville, Kentucky.

A

source advised on March 2, 1961, that Claude

Lightfoot, a Communist Party functionary, stated at a meeting

of the Communist Party in Baltimore, Maryland, on February 25,

1961, that the Communist Party is not connected with any

progressive movement but indirectly they do have some influence

in the SCEF.

A second source, who is familiar with some phases

of Communist Party activity in the New Orleans area, advised

on June 3, 1966, that during the time that the SCHW was in

existence, members of the Communist Party were members of

and worked actively in the SCHw; however, since the formation

of the SCEF, Communist Party members have not been encouraged

to work in the scEF.

The source stated that the SCEr is

a progressive, liberal organization, which he considers a

Communist Party front organization because it has gone along

with the Communist Party on certain issues, particularly

on the racial issue.

A third source advised on May 25, 1965, that

George Meyers, a Communist Party functionary, expressed

great admiration for Carl and Anne Braden and the SCEF,

with which they are affiliated, and expressed the view

that the SCEF is the best organization in the South as far

as doing effective work is concerned and that they have a

better idea of what they are doing, where they are heading,

and influence other organizations for the better.

The second source also advised on June 3, 1966,

that many people who are officials and supporters of the

SCEF, while liberal in their views, are by no means Communists.

FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE

The April 6, 1960, edition of "The New York Times"

newspaper contained a

full-page advertisement captioned

"What Is Really Happening In Cuba," placed by the Fair Play

for Cuba Committee (FPCC). This advertisement announced the

formation of the FPCC in New York City and declared the FPCC

intended to promulgate "the truth about revolutionary Cuba" to

neutralize the distorted American press:

"The New York Times" edition of January 11, 1961,

reported that at a hearing conducted before the United States

Senate Internal Security Subcommittee on January 10, 1961,

Dr. Charles A. Santos-Buch identified himself and Robert Taber

as organizers of the FPCC.

ot the rPG. He also e

He also testified he and Taber

obtained funds from the Cuban Government which were applied

toward the cost of the aforementioned advertisement.

On May 16, 1963, a source advised that during the

first two years of the FPCC's existence there was a struggle

between Communist Party (CP) and Socialist Workers Party (SWP)

elements to exert their power within the FPCC and thereby

influence FPCC policy. This source added that during the past

year there had

been a

successful effort by FPCC leadership to

minimiza the role of these and other organizations in the FPCC

so that

their influence as of May, 1963, war merligible.

The SWP has been designated pursuan: to Executive

Order 10450.

On May 20, 1963, a second source rivised that Vincent

"Ted" Tee, FDCC National Office Director, wes then formulating

FPCC policy and had indicated that he had no intention of

permitting FPCC policy to be determined by any other organization.

This source stated that Lee believed that the IPCC should.

"..

advocate resumption of diplomatic relations between Cuba and

the United States and should support the right of

Cubans to manage their revolution without intesierence from

other nations.

Les 21d

not advocate supporti.; the Cuban

revolution per se.

The November 23, 1963, edition of "The New York Times"

reported that Sensic: Thomas J. Dodd of Connecticut had called

FPCC "the chief public relations instrument of the Castro network

in the United States."

It is to be noted that Senator Dodd was

a member of the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee which

twice conducted hearings on the FPCC.

VITTEE (CONT' D)

The December 27, 1963, edition of "The New York World

augIam and Sun" newspaper stated that the pro-Castro FPCC

seeking to go out of business and

that its prime activity

during its lifetime had been sponsorship of pro-Castro street

rallies and mass picket lines, and the direction of an active

propaganda mill highlighting illegal travel-to-Cuba campaigns.

Its comparatively brief span of life was attributed to mounting

anti-Castro American public opinion, the 1962 Congressional

hearings which disclosed FPCC financing by Castro's United

Natiors Delegation, and ultimately, the bad publicity which

the FPCC received

from disclosure of activities on its behalf

by suspected presidential assassin Lee H. Oswald.

source advised that v.

on February &y. 9ee, the previously mentioned second

had recently remarked that tha

FPCC was dead

and that

there were no plans to organize another

simiiar urganization.

On April 13, 1964, a third source advised that there

had not been any FPCC

activity in many months and that the

FPCC had been

dissolved.

TAIMI HALONEN and THORUN ROBEL were midiy self-

critical about not working for the programs the younger women

were promoting. TAIMI said she was tired after working long

hours on the Seattle conference to be held Saturday, January

20th at Mt, Zion Baptist Church

in Seattle at which

Seattle delegation would report. HALONEN made the observation,

however, that the women working

on the program were all very

experienced leaders and she trusted they would formulate a

satisfactory program.

On Monday, January 15, 1968, the delegates including

the group from Washington State, met at the Union Station in

Washington, D.C.

It was learned here that the instructions

which had been given the day before at the Shoreham Hotel were

evidently for the California

group only, because many California

people had been badiy beaten in previous demonstrations and

they were very cautious and somewhat apprehensive.

official pattern was different.

Mimeographed sheets headed

"Jearrette Rankin Brigade - Information and Instructions" were

passed out and

these appeared to be the official instructions.

RADER defended herself when TAIMI HALONEN criticized

her for bringing ZEFRA along since

ZEFRA is at least six months

~pregnant.

After the demonstration, HEALY and RADER spent much

of the time urging the speakers to

include in their talks some-

thing about the

status of the American Indian. ELLA BAKER from

New York did include a paragraph from the paper the Washington.

State delegation submitted to Congress.

HEALY expressed great dissatisfaction with the

basic organization of the gathering.

She wanted an organi,

zational meeting instead of a raily type meeting which

occurred. HALONEN and ROBEL agreed somewhat. HEALY implied

the whole thing was a waste of her time.

In the workshop section of the meeting, HALONEN

worked

in the legislative action section; HELEN FRENCH and

ELAINE HORSLEY in the electoral campaigns; and HEALY and

CORR in racism.

Here, too, the younger women were very

critical. HEALY, particularly, resented having men as

"resource people" for the group.

a women's congress. TAIMI said she found herself in a

situation that was quite different in that she was working

with a

very broad spectrum of

politically and economically oriented

individuals and it was a real learning experience.. ELAINE

HORSLEY was anxious to get back home and work for peace while

the spirit of JEANNETTE RANKIN was still fresh.

She and

HELEN FRENCH expressed

the view the congress met the needs

of American women in giving a concrete program on which to work.

Tuesday, January 16, 1968, was for lobbying. The

Seattle and Tacona people were

told

to meet at the Methodist

Building, 100 Maryland Avenue.

HALONEN,

ROBEL, HEALY, HORSLEY,

and HELEN FRENCH arrived before the appointed time. After about

an hour, EMELIA CASSIDY arrived stating RADER had an eye problem

and would be unable to attend.

Mrs. BACKUP joined the group.

LINDA CORR and ZEFRA were too tired to get up so early.

The

group called on Washington State's Senators JACKSON and MAGNUSON,

but they were not in their offices.

Iician rich a rif'e butü. Sore Indian youth view the television prograin

jistori as indicaiira of Incist America.

The National Congeess of Am'rican

Indians opposes

inis distorcion of hiscory. Beatings and murder of Indians

in linine go unchallenged. Congress voted in 195 io open up Indian land

reservations to state jurisdiction. In actuality, this rides established

cribal courts and federal jurisdiction. It gives local bigoted authorities

more opportunity to harrass and open the way to termination of our treaties

and in several places resulted in actual loss of land.

It Is as deadly to be an Indian in America as it is to be a soldier

in Viet Nam.

In che three years before 1907, more Indian childien

below the

age of lu had died in this country than the 6,623 U. S. combat casualties of

tle entire Viet Nan War (as of the end of 1960). Most of these were children

beior the age of six.

The price we pay is the built-in racism our children are taught in

school, over television, in cartoons; the Indian has become a joise, to white

Anericans:

We pay because we don't know our own history,

The thread of

struggle for self-determination runs through the history

of Indian-Americans.

When a few Indian youth speak of Red Power, the roots go

deep into their history in finding nourishment for this demand. Just as some

Negro leaders today speal of W.E.B. DuBois as having raised the same issue of

identity long before the level of struggle, which is Black Power, arrived.

This struggle has gone on for 400 years.

The Indian people have been sending spokesmen to bring their grievances

and their positions before the power structure of this country for two hundred

years. They have fought in the courts since at least 1330 when the case of

the Cherokee Nation Vs. Georgia tested the ability and the willingness of the

United States to protect an Indian Tribe in its efforts at self-determination.

The Vietnamese war is a continuation of the whole racist war we have

waged against the Indian People. Understanding this is a part of understanding

the Viet Nam war.

We respond to what is happening to Vietnamese children, yet

the Indian people have suffered from the same policy of extermination and

destruction of their identity.

We must unite with the strivings of those who have had to deal with

United States'

genocide for 200 years!

We can help to push the United States to ratify the United Nations

Resolution, "Ireaty Against Genocide", that the United States should correct

the history and policy of genicide against the Indian people.

Today this

refers to the desiruction of their identity as a people and linte with the

struggles of people for their identity all over the world. Io stop the policy

of genocide, of racisin, to develop compensatory steps to undo the effects of

Lne crimes

against the

people!

All the forces in this country cannot win democratic power without

naiting this correction of what was done to the American Indian people.

and unconstitutional infringement of their first Menuent Tagio to does

free speech and the right to petition their government for a redress of

grievances.

Upon informing the Capitol Police of their planned march to the Capitol building

to present their petition, the women were threatened with arrest under 40 U.s.C.

193 (a) et. seg. which, after desining the area cousidered Capitol Grounds, states:

"It is forbidden to parade, stand, or move in processions

or assemblages in said United States Capitol Grounds, or to,

display therein any flag, banner, or device designed or

adapted to bring into public notice any party, organization,.

or movement...

The statute further provides that exceptions from these prescriptive provisions

will be made in the discretion of certain Congressional leaders and/or Capitol

Police. The exceptions are allowed on "ocassions of national interest becoming

the congnizance and entertainment of Congress."

The petition of the Jeannette Rankin Brigade apparently does not become "the

entertainment of Congress" and arrests were threatened. Therefore the suit which

was files prays for the convening of a three-judge Federal District Court which

is requested to enjoin the operation and enforcement of the statute and to •

declare it unconstitutional. We have asked the Federal District Court for the

Districtof Columbia to grant us this relief on an emergency basis prior to

January 15th. Our request was denied.

The same request was made to the District

of Columbia Court of Appeals and was likewise denied. As it was then impossible

to obtain relief prior to January 15th the Brigade's attorneys are continuing the

appeal on a non-emergency basis in the Court of Appeals and have every confidence

of ultimate victory.

This is far from the last time that these women or any other Americans intend

to appear in their nation's Capitol to petition their government. Hopefully this

will be the last time that they find it so difficult to do so.

In 1963, the Washington Legislature apporriated $20,000 for a stuay

of the state's public assistance programs.

The study was made by

Greenleigh Associates, and the Greenleigh Report was presentod

Decembar, 1964.

Tils report stated that public assistance grants in

Washington, with standals based on 1959 prices and

12% ratable reductions, 1? e 40% below the minimum

standards for health and decency.

Speaking of child

welfare needs, the report sald:"There 1s an excessive

and Increasing rate of referral of chilaren to the

Juvenile Courts, both for dependency and delinquency.

There is an excessive and increasing trend for children

to be removed from their natural families and cared

for olsewhere."

WHAI ABOUT RATABLE REDUCTIONS?

The 1965 Legislature removed the ratable reductions. The 196?

Legislature ordered the Dept. of Public Assistance to bring 1t's

pricing standard's up to 1967 levels.

standards were put into effect July first. Increased allowances

for rent vary from county to county. Other allowances were increased

an average of 10-3/4%aIn King County the total increase was 16%.

Thus, king county grants have been increased by 28% since 1964,

but the cost of living has increased by at least 5% Grants are stll

17% less than acceptable levels.

The maximum grant for a Seattle family consisting of

two adults,

a boy 13, and a g1r1 8, 1s $285.80 a

month--$3,429 a year.

But recent changes in the

Federal Social Security Law cast a shadow on even

this figure.

NEW FATABLE

REDUCTIONS ARE AIWAYS A POSSIBILITY.

There 1s much talk of getting people off welfare by putting them to

WORKERS WORLD PARTY

On April 17, 1959, a confidential source advised

that on February 12, 1959, a Socialist

Workers Party (SWP)

minority group under the leadership of National Committee

member SAM BALLAN, split from the SWP.

The source stated that this minority groud,

referred to as the Marcyites, after many years of program

and policy differences on varied issues concerning tactics

and interpretation of political events:

split from the swe

grounds that the Party was liquidating itself b

departing from the Marxist precepts of LEON TROTSKY and

retreating from the fight for the world socialist

revolution.

The final issue which ultimately forced the

split was

the minority's opposition to the SWP regroupment

policy which involved cooperation with the Communist Party.

(P) periphery-individuals characterized by the minority

as petty-bourgeois.

the minority program, according to the source,

advocated unconditional defense of the Soviet Union and has

as its goal the building of a revolutionary party with a

complete proletarian orientation for the purpose of overthrowing

capitalism in the United States and throughout the world.

On May 12, 1960, source advised that this minority

group had chosen the name Workers World Party.

• On May 1, 1967, a second confidential source

advised that the Workers World Party, which maintains head- :

quarters at 46 West 21st Street, New

York, lew York, supports

the People's Republic of China in its ideological dispute

with the Soviet Union.

The SWiP and CP have been designated

pursuant to. Executive Order 10450.
