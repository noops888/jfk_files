DL 92-36 ;

Dallas T-24 advised on June 5, 1961, Justice of
the Peace GLEN BYRD said CIVELLO was highly perturbed
because JOE CAMPISI introduced CIVELLO to ASAC BREEN on
the night of June 4, 1961. T-24 said it is the concensus of
opinion of those in attendance that CAMPISI would be admonished
by CIVELLO because of the incident. T-24 said JOE CAMPISI
continues to be the weak link among the Italian gamblers.

T-24 further advised that PETE INTERRANTE, owner
Ross's Drive-In, McKinney and Lemmon Streets is a cohort of
JOE CIVELLO's. T-24 recalled INTERRANTE a few years ago
was practically pennyless, however, recently he has acquired
a car for himself as well as buy a new Corvette for his son,
He further stated PETE INTERRANTE will purchase any hot or
stolen merchandise that comes to his attention and will do
practically anything to make a dollar. He stated the premises
that Ross's Drive-In is located on is owned by JOE CIVELLO and
he is confident that since PETE INTERRANTE did not have any
funds for which to. do business, that CIVELLO undoubtedly put
up the funds for this business. He stated that he feels he
also has an underworld contact with CIVELLO and:sikéee his.
association with CIVELLO/hi appeared to come into considerable
amounts of money. He recalled that Ross's Drive-In had i
formerly been under the maiden name of PETE's wife, named |
JOSEPHINE (last name unknown) however, she recently had the
registration of the property changed to JOSEPHINE INTERRANTE,
T-24 recalled that he and PETE INTERRANTE had a partnership
relation for a two week period a few years ago for the purpose
of going into business and getting a beer license, however,
he later learned INTERRANTE has a long criminal record and’ that
the City would not authorize the issuance of a beer license to!
PETE INTERRANTE, Thereafter the partnership was disbanded. He
stated he feels that if INTERRANTE's background is brought to the
attention of local authorities the beer license for that property
will be repealed,

T-24 recalled the name which he had previously forgotten
as the man in the telephone company in Dallas who is closely
associated with the Italian criminal. element. He said ‘the man's
name is ACE LEWIS. |

The true identity of the above person is believed to!

be A. C. LEWIS, an executive in the business office of the H
Southwestern Bell Telephone Company. |
