The Honorable Edvard H. Levi
The Attorney General
Washington, D. C. 20530

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

On May 12, 1975, I wrote to you making a general request.
for documents in the possession of the Department of Justice
(inciuding the FBI) which relate to the subjeat of planned or
attempted or actual assassinetions. I aleo specifically referred:<
to a Justice Department file relating to the possible prosecution’
of a Mr. Giancana, and perhaps of others, for an allegedly 111:
wiretap. On May 20, 1975, Departuent of Justice file #82-16-5
(relating to « Las Vegas wiretap matter and the alleged connection:
of the CIA therevith) was made available at the Department for ~
review by Mesers. Schwarz and Smothers. On June 5, 1975, five —
additional documents vere made available to Messrs. Schwars and
Smothers at the Department of Justice. From our counsels' review
of the foregoing, it appears that there must be certain additional
documents including: -

(1) a memorandum written by Former Director Hoover
reflecting a meeting between him and Former Attorney General
Robert F. Kennedy on May 9, 1962; and

(2) underlying material sefleating an interview or
interviews by the FBI of Mr. Sheffield Edwards, formerly
Director of Security of the CIA and Robert Maheu, a suspect

appears thet there must be some such under-
Tying: from owe understanding under usual practice,
is thet it°appears that the deseription of such interviews in the
. May 22, 1961 memorandum sent to the Justice Department by the FBI
is slightly different than the description of those matters in the
Mareh 6, 1967 letters from Mr. Wannall to Mr, Sullivan and from
the Director of the FBI to the Attorney General.

understand
that you vanted « letter from the Committee itself. Accordingly,
_ today the Committee unanimously concluded that al) the dooments
referred to above should be delivered,

The matter ve are investigating is of utmost dmportance
under cur mandate. The President has, moreover, assuped the
Committees and ths public that all the material will be delivered
to us. Obvieusly we will handle the material with the appropriate
care as required by our Rules and agreencates.

Sinee the uaterial (or at least the parts specified
above) is already collected, we would expect that it could be
delivered forthwith.

Sincerely yours,

Frank Chureh
Chairman

Of course, it is possible that counsels’ notes, based upon a hasty i
reading of both sets of documents, are incomplete but that simply i
illustrates why it is se imgortant that the Committee have the

actual doeunents.

. MEMORANDUM SS

To: Bill Miller ree, S
Fritz Schwarz S

From: Bill Bader

Date: June 23, 1975

Subj: White House Holdings of. National Security Council,
Rockefeller Commission, and CIA Files

At the request of the Committee the White House made avail-
able last Friday for Senatorial and staff examination at the
white’ House a number of files on the subject of assassination .
allegations drawn from the National Security Council, the
Rockefeller Commission, and the CIA. The White House has also
agreed to bring these files to Capitol Hill for use by the
Committee during hearings.

Over the past three days a number of Senators and the Staff
have reviewed the documents with the hope that these files would
provide the necessary background for the sessions scheduled this
week with Messrs. Bundy, McNamara, Rusk, et al. It is’ the
‘Staff's conclusion that the documents are not adequate for this
purpose. ;

By way of background, at the time when discussion and plan-
ning of assassinations were in fashion there were several
relevant layers of the National Security Council structure;

the NSC Standing Group, the Special Group (whether it be called

HW 50955 Docld:32423485 Page 12


ae

$412 or.303), the Special Group (Augmented)., and the Special
Group (Counterinsurgency or CI). To do a: thorough job of
examining the command structure as it relates to the assassina-
tion issue, the Committee will have to examine the complete
records of all. these groups.

The files available. at the White House are not adequate
for this purpose, consisting largely of Castro materials with

the only complete Castro file being that of the Special Group
(Augmented) /MONGOOSE files of 1962. ;

Available at the White House

1. Special Group (Augmented) - MONGOOSE - minutes and
supporting papers for 27 meetings held between 26 February and
26 October 1962.. [MONGOOSE was suspended in‘late October of
1962 when the U.S. struck a deal with the Russians over Cuba
after the missile crisis.]

2. Various Special Group Minutes from January of 1960
to 1964:

13 January 1960
14 March 1960

25 August 1960
27 October 1960
3 November 1960
23 March 1961

6 October 1961
12 November 1963
18 June 1964

30 July 1964

HW 50955 Docld:32423485 Page 13


NW 50955

These minutes range from a discussion of Lumumba
(25 August -1960)'to Mafia plans against Castro (8 June 1964). -
These few documents may.or-may not be the sum total of Special
Group consideration of "assassination" issues from 1960 to 1964.
The file also includes a number of NSC memos on the Castro
problem. :

3. . CIA files .on MONGOOSE

Approximately 33 documents. on MONGOOSE drawn from the

CIA files. Most of these materials were once available to
us at Langley. Contains a number of John McCone's notes on
Special Group (Augmented) meeting.

4. Rockefeller Commission Documents on Assassinations.

(a) “Summary of Facts of CIA involvment in Assassina-
tion Plots. An 86-page paper prepared by Rocke-
feller Commission staff.

(b) Two Dominican Republic files with CIA/State material

(c).. Some material on ZRRIFLE, QUWIN and MONGOOSE

Relevant Material Not Available at. the White House

The most important problem with the NSC records is the
limitation -- with the partial exception of the Trujillo mater-
jals --.to the Castro issue. The NSC and its various components
may never have.considered the personal futures of Diem, Sukarno,
Duvalier or Lumumba (beyond the one reference mentioned above),
but until we review the records (he Committed will not be able
to speak authoritatively and confidently on the assassination

issue.
