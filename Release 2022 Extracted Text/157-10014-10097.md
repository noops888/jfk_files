Dear Hank:

On Monday morning, June 2, Burt Wides of our

Staff relayed to you my request that various docus

ments be made available to us, if possible, when

Mr. Breckenridge testified that afternoon, or a

soon as possible thereafter.

The Agency was not able to provide us with

these documents when Mr. Breckenridge came to testify,

but he indicated that they were being assembled.

I agreed to furnish a letter confirming the earlier

request, but emphasized to Mr. Breckenridge the in-

portance of our obtaining these documents

in connec-

tion with the inquiry this week. He agreed that the

effort to collect them would go thrward while the

Agency was awaiting receipt of this lotter.

The following are the items we would like to

have as soon as possible, but in any event no later

than the close of business on thursday, so that we

can use them in connection with Mr. McCone's testimony

dune 6.

Dear Mº. Attorney General:

On May 12, 1975, I vrote to you miing & reneral request.

for doeuments in the posession of the Departmant of Justioe

(Including the FAI) vhich ralate to the subjeet of planned or

attempted of actual assassinations. I also specifleally referred

to a Juntico Department file relating to the posiblo promecution.

additional doements vero made avilable to Nemary. Schers and

Smothere at the Department of Justier. From ou counsela' review

of the foregoing, 1t appenre that there must be certaia additional

doerments ineluding:

(1) a memorandu written by Forar Director Hoover

reflecting a meeting between him and Formor Attorney General

Robert 7. Kennedy on MY 9, 1962; and

(2) underlying mterial nflecting a laterior of

Intervie by the FBI of l. Sherfleld Edwards, formerly

Director of Security of the CIA and Fobert Mahmi, a mumpeet

ahit appears that there must be some such under

it from our understanding under usuni practice,

In that it appeare that the description of such latervlevs in the

• May 22, 1961 memorandun sent to the Justice Department by the FBI

is slightly different than the description of those matters in the

March 6, 1967 letters from ir. Waanall to Mr. Sullivas and from

SENSITIVE

Date:

Subj:

•June 23, 1975

White House Holdings of National Security Council,

Rockefeller Commission, and CIA Files

At the request of the Committee the White House made avail-

able

last Friday for Senatorial and staff examination at the

White' House a number of files on the subject of assassination

allegations drawn from the National Security Council, the

Rockefeller Commission, and the CIA. The White House has also

agreed to bring these files to Capitol Hill for use by the

Committee during hearings.

Over the past three days a number of Senators and the Staff

have reviewed the documents with the hope that these files would

provide the necessary background for the sessions scheduled this

week with Messrs. Bundy, McNamara, Rusk, et al: It is the

Staff's conclusion that the documents are not adequate for this

purpose.

By way of background, at the time when discussion and plan-

ning of assassinations were in fashion there were several

relevant layers of the National Security Council structure;

the NSC Standing Group, the Special Group (whether it be called

NW 50955

2.

5412 or: 303), the Special Group (Augmented), and the Special

Group (Counterinsurgency or CI). To do a thorough job of

examining the command structure as it relates to the assassina-

tion issue, the Committee will have to examine the complete

records of all these groups.

The files available at the White House are not adequate

for this purpose, consisting largely of Castro materials with

the only complete Castro file being that of the Special Group

(Augmented) /MONGOOSE files of 1962.

Available at the White House

1. Special Group (Augmented) - MONGOOSE - minutes and

supporting papers for 27 meetings held between 26 February and

26 October 1962. [MONGOOSE was suspended in late October of

1962 when the U.S. struck a deal with the Russians over Cuba

after the missile. crisis.]

2. Various Special Group Minutes from January of 1960

to 1964:

13 January 1960

14 March 1960

25 August 1960

27 October 1960

3

November 1960

March 1961

6 October 1961

18 June 1964

30 July 1964

## Page 14

3.

These minutes range from a discussion of Lumumba

(25 August 1960) to Mafia plans against Castro (18 June 1964).

These few documents may or may not be the sum total of Special

Group consideration of "assassination" issues from 1960 to 1964.

The file also includes a number of NSC memos on the Castro

problem.

3. • CIA files on MONGOOSE:

.. Approximately 33 documents on MONGOOSE drawn from the

CIA files.

Most of these materials were once available to

us at Langley. Contains a number of John McCone's notes on

Special Group (Augmented) meeting.

4. Rockefeller Commission Documents on Assassinations.

(a) "Summary of Facts of CIA involvment in Assassina-

tion Plots.

An 86-page paper prepared by Rocke-

feller Commission staff.

(b) Two Dominican Republic files with CIA/State material

(c). Some material on ZRRIFLE, QJWIN and MONGOOSE

Relevant Material Not Available at the White. House

The most important problem with the NSC records is the

limitation -- with the partial exception of the Trujillo mater-

ials.--. to the Castro issue. The NSC and its various components

may never have considered the personal futures of Diem, Sukarno,

Duvalier or Lumumba (beyond the one reference mentioned above),

but until we review the records the Committeg will not be able

to speak authoritatively and confidently on the assassination

issue.
