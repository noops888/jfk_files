1. In 1961 George Campbell was hired by IBM and
sent to Vienna, Austria as a systems engineer. On 11
June 1968, George Campbell, in an interview with an :

officer of this Agency, reported a recruitment attempt

by a Soviet employee of the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA), Mikhail Vlasovich Ivanov, which, Campbell
said, had United States security as its ultimate goal.
Campbell gave the following information by way- of his
background:

a) that he spent his youth in the state of

Washington

b) that he acquired a BS in mathematics at the
University of Washington (CA 53-567)

c) that he worked for two years in the engineer-
.ing department of Boeing Aircraft (CA $7-S9?)

(Ivanov (DOB 1 Dec 31) first appeared in the West as ee . 4
head of the computer section of IAEA in January 1966. :
There were no prior traces on Ivanov). Campbell stated
that he first came into contact with Ivanov in the

summer of 1966 (July or August). Campbell further said ‘

that one of his main jobs was to gain the confidence of
Ivanov with respect to selling to the IAEA an advanced model
of the IBM 360. Campbell went on te relate that his
relationship with Ivanov had developed in such a fashion

as to indicate that Ivanov was developing him for the
benefit of Soviet Intelligence.

2. Vienna Station, after June 68 interviews,

decided to use Campbell as a ‘window’ on Ivanov, which
Campbell agreed to. After it appeared to Headquarters:
that Ivanov was more in control of Campbell than we

were, a.decision was made to terminate: Campbell's

relationship with Ivanov. The plan to terminate the

relationship was as follows:

a) Campbell would go to several meetings with

Ivanov in which Cazpbell would be ‘wired’ for sound

“ b) Ivanov would then be presented with the

recordings of the meeting, told that "US security’

had been on to him all throughout his relationship

with Campbell, and that he, Ivanov, might be

exposed for utilizing the United Nations activity
(IAEA) as cover for espionage purposes.
On 10 Jan 69 Ivanov was presented with recordings of the
meetings with Campbell, but he refused to take them. 2 ‘
Last available information on Ivanov indicates that he . i
departed Vienna PCS in April 1970. Last available infor- i
mation on Campbell is that he was still in Vienna in
January 1970.
3. It will be noted (paragraph one} that Campbell
told the Vienna Station officer, in June 1968, that he

had first met Ivanov in 1966, a period cf two years, It

should be pointed out that a transcript of a conversa- :

tion between Campbell and Ivanov (6 Sep 68) mutually’ a . Ai

acknowledged knowing each other for ten years. Further,

Campbell was not questioned concerning this discrepancy.
4. In George Campbell's CI/OA folder, there is

identified as a possible trace from an ONI Investigative

“report, dated 1 March 61, one George Sheffield Campbell. Sire ir
George S. Campbell on 18 Nov 60 (date of interview),

ans was a graduate student in mathematics at the University
of Washington. He was being interviewed as a ‘developed
informant" in the case of William Hamilton Martin, the

«°.... NSA defector. Campbell said that he had met Martin

Willian Hamilton Martin was a graduate student in

mathenatics at University of Washington). (Note that

1 the transcript of the 6 Sep 68 Ivanov-Campbell meeting : . 4
indicates that they have known each other since circa H ae
1958 and that the ONI report indicates that Martin had
known Campbell since 1957).

that the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee (SISS)

i lists the following information for one James
Hamilton Martin:
i a) Member of International Brigade

b) age (in 1937); 27

c) address: 800 Stewart Avenue, Garden City,

Long Island, New York

d) San Francisco Series Passport #31264,
issued 25 August 1937

(Note that year and month of James Hanilton Martin

passport issue coincide with year and month of William
Hamilton Martin move to Washington State). It is
conceivable, therefore, that James Hamilton Martin and
John Hamilton Martin are connected with the same pass-
port, i.e.,
Sames
a) The Johan Hamilton Martin who went over to
the Spanish Civil War, was killed and the Soviets
substituted an Intelligence Officer in his place,
Tames

_ _b) that John Hamilton Martin turned his pass-
port in upon arrival in Spain, as was the practice,

and it was ‘lost' and used in a slightly altered

fashion by a Soviet Intelligence Officer. So ieee

dee iat
Also, in its study of the Institute of Pacific Relations con :

(IPR), the SISS shows that in June 1944 one Nellie

Wright, not further identified, was employed in a

clerical capacity by the IPR.
j 7. It is suggested, at this point, based largely

on the striking facial similarity of Ivaney and

Willian Hamilton Martin, that Ivanov and Willian

nA
Hanilton Martin are one in the same person. Further,
' that William Hamilton Martin is possibly Soviet Illegal

Intelligence Officer who 'defected' in 1960 and

i reappeared in Vienna in 1966 as Mikhail Vlasovich

Ivanov. This theory, in light of Campbell's relation-

ship with both Martin and Ivanov, would necessitate

Canpbells knowledge that Ivanov and Martin were the ee

$ame person. A plausible explanation as to why the
Soviets would risk drawing attention to the Ivanov/
Campbell. relationship lies in the fact that this Agency
installed an audio penetration in Ivanov's apartment in
Vienna in July 1966. Vienna station, at that time,
suspected Ivanov of being a KGB S&T officer. The

» Soviets at a later date may have discovered the audio

| penetration of Ivanov's apartment, at which operations

_ coferning Campbell may have been discussed, and decided sos ee
. that the best way to protect Ivanov an¢ Carpbell was to

ure
Campbell ‘walk in" and ‘tell all’.
