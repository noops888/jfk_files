confidence and use you as an entree with the

and

other, excellent Bureau

contacts The recommendation was also specifically made that "due to your

peculiar personality" Horton should be the new Canadian

répresentative

because of his so cailed ability to handle people," meaning of course,

he is expected to cultivate and properly handle you for the, benefit of CIA.

It is therefore quite evident that CIA personnel are not only unfairly

judging you, but also have every intention of using you as a "stepping-Stonel

for their own designs.

This infornation is being pointed out to you so that you may be

completely aware of the situation. You should be particularly alert to prevent

being used

as any such "steppingstone" for CIA or Horton. CIA should develop

Its own contacts without depending upon the excellent relationships already

established between the FBI and Canadian

official channels only that Liaison

necessary for the coordination of domestic and foreign matters is necessary and

it should be most circumspect.
