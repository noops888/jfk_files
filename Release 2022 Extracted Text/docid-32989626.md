memorandum advised CIA had prepared a, document citing instances
wherein CIA believed some of its activities may have exceeded Qi
its legal mandate. Portions of this CIA document were
furnished this Bureau and referenced memorandum requested
documents pertaining to a particular Bureau division and/or
Intelligence Division section be reviewed to identify the
subject matter and make an assessment as to whether any
compromise to this Bureau's operation is involved. Those i
portions of the CIA document pertaining to the IS-2 Section j; |
of the Intelligence Division are pages 29, 30, 171, 190, ly
191, 193, 194, 197, 198, 203, 330, and 482. :

A review has been made of the material, supra, and a
the following comments apply: cal

Pages 29, 30, under the heading "Merrimac," refer
to recruitment and handling of "several Agents" to covertly
monitor dissident groups in the Washington area and states
one was so successful the"Agent"was turned over to the FBI.
We have no idea who the "Agent" was and in absence of identi-
fying information no compromise exists to Bureau operations. :

Memorandum to Mr. W. R, Wannall
Re: Senstudy 75
62-116395

Pages 193, 194, refer to CIA participation in prepara-
tion of several short intelligence memoranda dealing with the
foreign connections of U. S, organizations and activists
involved in the anti-war movement. Reference is made to.‘
collecting information from their own sources “and through
liaisen with the FBI." A reference is also made to primary
source of information being "sensitive intercepts produced
by NSA." While these pages do not directly compromise
Bureau operations, disclosure of NSA intercepts could well
indirectly adversely affect Bureau operations by disclosure

of sensitive techniques which . produce extremely valuable
information to the intelligence community, of which the FBI
is a part.

Pages 197, 198, refer to the response to an inquiry
as to involvement in domestic affairs by the Director, Central
Reference Service, cla, and in no way compromises Bureau
operations.

Page 203 refers to a similar response by Director,
Foreign Broadcast Information Service, CIA, and includes a
reference to their monitoring foreign broadcasts of Jane
Fonda and Ramsey Clark and furnishing transcripts at the
request of the’ FBI and Department of Justice for consideration
for possible trial use. There is no compromise of Bureau
operations involved as this was to be evidence in a public
trial and would have required CIA personnel to publicly
testify.

Page 330 again makes reference to "Restless Youth"
and use of FBI reports. It also refers to a 1967 CIA study
of "SDS and its foreign ties." The page, itself, dces not
compromise Bureau operations.

Page 482 refers to a "project MPLODESTAR," which
involved manipulation of assets against targets in the
"leftist and communist milieu in various parts of the world."
Comments include "each case is cleared with the FBI..." The
page itself dces not compromise Bureau operations.

RE: SENSTUDY

The following are comments prepared by the Radio
Engineering Section of the FBI Laboratory and relate to copies of
excerpted pages from a report written by the Central Intelligence
Agency. Comments are keyed to page numbers which appear in
the lower right-hand corner of each sheet.

1, Page 00112

Paragraph b. refers to FBI purchases of television
equipment and is accurate as to equipment obtained. According to
Bureau records, Purchase Order #21100 was issued to CIA on
4/11/73 and was amended 9/24/73. The items were 1 each WTC-20
@ $18, 300 and 1 each WTC-23 @ $18, 600. Purchase Order #21469
dated 5/1/73 was issued to CIA for 2 each lens systems totaling $11, 200.

No damage would be suffered by release of this information.
2. Page 00118

Item 9 lists 50 "Actuators, Recorders." This entry is
partially correct.

Bureau records show that Purchase Order 8989 was
issued to CIA on 11/17/71 for 30 each QTC-lls at $488.25, and 20 each
QTC-12As at $236. 25.

No damage would be suffered by release of this information.

Item ll lists 1 "Camera, Video." This entry could refer to
that transaction detailed in Purchase Order #18301 issued to CIA on
11/27/72 for 1 each WTC-20 camera in the amount of $18,400. Tubes
installed in these cameras were of the type mentioned under Item 12
and 13 below.

Item 12 lists 1 "Tube, Image, Burn-Resistance, Equivalent
of WL 30691," This entry is accurate.



me aa

e- @
TYP SECRET,

Purchase Order #16555 was issued to CIA on 9/21/72 in the
amount of $4,639. The video tube was for use in a closed circuit
television camera.

Item 13 lists 2 "Tube, Image, WL 30691" as having been
furnished the FBI on 3/26/71 at a cost of $4,607 each. This entry
is probably a duplication of Item 4 on page 0019. Bureau records
show that Purchase Order #5450 dated 5/21/71 was issued to CIA
for this equipment for use in CCTV cameras. No purchase order
to support two such acquisitions (March and May) could be located.

Item 14 lists 2 "Cameras, Television" at.a unit cost of
$18,300. This entry probably refers to that equipment acquired under
Purchase Order #21100 and is detailed in Paragraph b. page 00112, above.

No damage would be suffered by release of this information.
3. Page 00119

Item 2 lists 25 "Actuators, Recorders." The entry is
accurate.

Purchase Order #17204 was issued to CIA on 10/18/72 for 25
each QTC-lls @ $591.94. This equipment is identical to that obtained on
Purchase Order #8989 mentioned above.

Item 3 lists "Tube, Image, Burn-Resistance" etc., and is a
duplication of Item 12 on page 00118. Note identical dates.

Item 4 lists "Tube, Image, WL 30691" and is believed to refer
to the transaction carried as Item 13 on page 00118.

Items 5, 6, and 7 list "Transmitters, Module, Plug-In,
and Power Supply - UWP-39A."' These entries are essentially accurate.

Purchase Order #4203 was issued to CIA on 4/6/71 for
2 each transmitters SRT-67 @ $1372. 35; 1 each transmitter QRT-10A
@3160. 33; 1 each module QWT-18 @ $1247. 40; and, 1 each power
supply UWP-39A @ $538. 65.

No damage would be suffered by release of this information.

Item (A) is believed to be accurate and in the absence of
additional detail no serious damage would be suffered by release of
this information.

Item (B) is accurate and as long as target is not specifically
identified no serious damage should be incurred. It should be recognized,
however, that although the concept of intercepting cryptographic
machine emanations would come as no surprise to those familiar with
intelligence work, confirmation of a functioning system could encourage
implementation of countermeasures which would deprive the U.S. of
invaluable information.

Item (C) is accurate except that the equipment has not been
operated for some time. Without specific identification no serious
damage would result from disclosure of this information.

Item (D) is inaccurate to the extent that it states that
"installation is not fully operational because the full complement
of personnel have not yet arrived." Aside from that,disclosure
of information could lead the knowledgeable foreign government to be
certain of Bureau's participation and take whatever diplomatic steps
they felt necessary. Decision to withhold is an operational/political
one rather than one which would affect technical capabilities and, therefore,
the Laboratory is making no recommendations in this regard.

5. Page 00222

Item (E) is accurate and entirely too revealing. If there
is any way this item can be deleted from material yet to be given to
anyone outside the intelligence community, it should be done. As %
written, it suggests a concerted effort toward a penetration to be
attempted in the future. Disclosure of this information could easily
negate millions of dollars already spent and literally years of work
already performed - the largest single project ever undertaken by
this Bureau. In view of our responsibilities in the counter-intelligence
field, the FBI, as well as the intelligence community, and perhaps the
free world as well, would suffer incalculable harm from release of this
information. It would also be appropriate for the Intelligence Division
to comment on this item.

NW 65360 Docld:32989626 Page 8 TOP-SEERZ



Item (F) is accurate and, although its disclosure is
confirmatory no serious technical damage would result from its
disclosure. To our knowledge, there has been no diplomatic
protest, disclosure could precipitate such protest. Intelligence
Division may wish to comment regarding this possibility.

Item (G) asserts that in one case it is known that CIA
equipment was used against a "domestic target." This is insufficient
information to identify this matter.

(Item 6, pgs. 182 & 202)

With regard to press allegations concerning the use
of polygraph, it was noted that during July 1971 the President
was alleged to be furious with unauthorized disclosure of
classified information relative to the SALT Talks as disclosed
in the New York Times. The President directed a sweeping
investigation to determine the source of the disclosure and
this was conducted under the direction of Mr. Egil Krogh and
others of the White House Staff.

A subsequent article in the Washington Post dated
September 3, 1971 stated that a State Department spokesman
had acknowledged at a news briefing that agents of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation had polygraphed State Department
employees suspected of leaking information on the SALT Talks
in July. This statement is not accurate and the Director of
the FBI (J. Edgar Hoover) denied this allegation in a letter
to the Washington Post and said that the polygraph examinations
had been conducted by another agency.

As noted in the CIA notes in fact, it was CIA that
conducted the polygraph examination in conjunction with the
State Department and the FBI was not involved in any way in
these polygraph examinations. It is recalled that FBI
officials had been called to a White House meeting headed
by Mr. Krogh in which it was indicated we might have to
conduct some polygraph examinations and weré so alerted. A
subsequent call from the White House to the FBI instructed
that the FBI polygraph examinations would not be required.

In view of above, it does not appear the FBI would
incur any damage to its reputation or recognized use of the
polygraph in carefully selected criminal and security matters
in which we have jurisdiction.

(Item 7, pgs 65- 67) | (RE

In regard to the CIA notes concerning the subject
of the lending of Arabic linguists to the FBI, the following
is noted:

The FBI's linguistic capacity is limited to those
foreign languages in which translators can be fully utilized
on a full-time basis. When we need translations of foreign
language material beyond our normal translation capacity,
we turn to the governmental linguistic community for
assistance. Such help has been obtained in the past from
such agencies as the Library of Congress, Voice of America,
Foreign Service Institute, Defense Language Institute,

CIA, NSA, Bureau of Indian Affairs, U. S. Information
Agency and Smithsonian Institution. On occasions, we
have also turned to private citizens for help in very
unique situations involving exotic or rare languages.

The massacre of the Israeli athletes in Munich
at the 1972 Summer Olympics and other Arab terrorist
acts fomented a situation involving the national security
of the United States. The FBI needed immediate assistance
in the Arabic language field. A program was immediately
instituted to hire our own Arabic translators and, in the
interim period, CIA lent to our Washington Field Office the
necessary Arabic translators to fulfill our responsibilities.

The opening of the People's Republic of China
Liaison Office in Washington also created a need in the
Washington Field Office for Chinese translators with
special talents. Two such translators were borrowed from
CIA and one of them became an FBI employee for a short
time following his retirement from CIA.

All arrangements for the loan of Arabic and Chinese

linguists from CIA were effected by the Intelligence Division and

the Washington Field Office through their liaison with CIA, and
the FBI Laboratory was not directly involved.

In summary, the CIA notes are accurate. It is
not believed, however, that the FBI would incur any
embarrassment or damages as a result of this interagency
cooperation.

DISCUSSIONS ON IMAGERY ENHANCEMENT TECHNIQUES

Current personnel are unable to verify or
disclaim contact with CIA regarding this photographic technique.

In all likelihood, this contact was made in
conjunction with our continuing technical liaison with other Federal
agencies.

This consultation was entirely proper and made

to augment the Bureau's capabilities in this area. No deleterious
effect can be seen as a result of exposure of this information.

PURCHASE OF CAMERAS
(Item 8, Pg. 00118)

The F.B.I., by purchase order #1793
dated 1/20/72, contracted for the purchase of 10 Tessina
cameras on a transfer of funds basis arranged as a result
of our liaison with the Technical Services Division of CIA.
Cost of these cameras amounted to $7, 000.

The Tessina camera is a small, sophisticated
camera which is employed in concealment devices needed.
for photographic surveillances.

Although the exact nature of the concealment
devices we employ is not publicized, the disclosure of the
fact that we purchased cameras suitable for this use is not
considered inimical to our operations.

concerning an interview of him by

trip involving investigations of any FBI matter occurring
within that road trip and such assignments were not neces-
sarily connected with the Security Squad. SA Hamilton
advised he was reassigned to the Security Squad in Atlanta
during the Spring or early Summer of 1964 or 1965, and he
believed that, according to his best recollection, this
was in 1964,

The SSC Staff Members questioned SA Hamilton as
to what, if any, assignment he had regarding the inves-
tigation of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., or with the
Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). SA
Hamilton advised that upon his reassignment to the Security
Squad, he was assigned to monitor a wiretap; on SCLC and
on the residence of King. The Staff Members inquired as
to the number of lines monitored and as to the location
of the technical installation. SA Hamilton recalled
that lines on the SCLC switchboard and SCLC Wide Area
Telephone Service (WATS) as well as the residence tele-
phone of King were monitored. The Staff Members inquired
whether tapes of conversations were made from the techni-
cal installation and SA Hamilton replied that occasionally
when it was necessary to record more than one telephone
conversation occurring at the same time, that he occa-
sionally would tape one conversation while preparing a
handwritten log of another, that thereafter the conver-
sation recorded on tape was reduced to a handwritten log
when time permitted. The Staff Members asked what was
done with the recorded tapes following the completion of
the recording and Hamilton advised that when the conver-
sation had been reduced to writing on a log and the tape
was used up, that as best as he could recall, the tape
was erased and then reused. The Staff Members asked
whether such tapes were reviewed by other FBI personnel
and SA Hamilton stated he could not recall any situation
where this occurred. The Staff Members inquired as to
whether such tapes were further maintained or placed

somewhere else and SA Hamilton replied he was not aware
of any instance where this was done. The Staff Members
asked to whom the case on King was assigned and who was
the supervisor of the squad at the time that SA Hamilton
was assigned to the monitoring of the installation. They
were advised the agent assigned to the case was former
SA Robert Nichols and the supervisor was Charles Harding.
At that point the Staff Members inquired as to who was
the supervisor of the Security Squad when SA Hamilton
was first assigned to Atlanta and who were the succeeding
supervisors on that squad. They were advised that Mr.
Henry Rowse was the supervisor when Hamilton was first
assigned to Atlanta and that upon Rowse's transfer to
FBI Headquarters, Harding became the supervisor. There-
after, in approximately 1968, Charles Haynes replaced
Harding as supervisor of the Security Squad in Atlanta.
The Staff Members inquired as to the reason for the
replacement of Harding by Haynes. Hamilton advised

that was an administrative decision made by FBI Headquarters
and since that did not relate to the investigation per-
taining to Doctor Martin Luther King, Jr., he would respect-
fully decline to discuss that matter. The Staff Members
subsequently asked if SA Nichols was subsequently assigned
to the Valdosta, Georgia, Resident Agency of the Atlanta
Office and, then transferred to another field office.

SA Hamilton advised that was correct. The Staff Members
inquired as to the reason for SA Nichols' transfer to
another field office, to which SA Hamilton replied he
felt that question did not relate to the investigation
of King and involved an administrative decision by FBI
Headquarters; and, therefore, declined to answer.

The Staff Members, after being advised by SA
Hamilton that he was assigned to monitoring the technical
installation .for a period of approximately four months,
inquired as to whether he was ever subsequently assigned
to any investigation relating to King or SCLC. Hamilton
advised the case concerning SCLC was assigned to him

upon the retirement of former SA Alan Sentinella in
approximately 1970. The Staff Members inquired as to the
period of time thereafter that SCLC remained under inves-
tigation and what basis if any there was for closing

the case. SA Hamilton pointed out that since the re-
assignment of the case to him occurred after the death
of King, he felt that question did not directly relate
to the investigation of King: and that prior to fur-
nishing an answer to that question, he felt he should
confer with a FBI Headquarters representative who was
then present in the Atlanta Office of the FBI. The
Staff Members advised they did desire an answer to that
question and approved of a consultation between SA
Hamilton and the FBI Headquarters representative. SA
Hamilton conferred with the FBI Headquarters represen-
tative then in the Atlanta Office of the FBI and it

was agreed the question regarding the closing of SCLC
and the assignment of that case to SA Hamilton was outside
“the parameter of the authority given to SA Hamilton by
FBI Headquarters regarding discussion of Doctor Martin
Luther King, Jr. However, in the spirit of cooperation,
it was agreed that SA Hamilton would answer the question
of the Staff Members in this regard. Thereafter, SA
Hamilton advised the FBI investigation regarding SCLC
was closed about 1972 or 1973 since a review of the

case file failed to reflect any influence by individuals
or organizations having affiliations with communist
background. In view of that, it was felt the SCLC case
should be closed.

The Staff Members inquired as to who made the
decision regarding closing of SCLC and whether the matter
was first discussed with FBI Headquarters or other indi-
viduals within the Atlanta Office of the FBI or if it
was a decision made by SA Hamilton alone. Hamilton
advised that as he recalled, he reviewed the SCLC case
file from that time to a substantial period in the past
and that he recénimended to the supervisor of the Security

Squad that the case be closed since there had been no known
communist influence upon the activities of the SCLC
organization for a long period of time. In response

to the mechanics of closing the case they were advised
that SA Hamilton dictated a letter to FBI Headquarters
from the Special Agent in Charge of the Atlanta Office,
advising that a review of the file reflected no commmist
influence upon the activities of SCLC and that unless
advised to the contrary by FBI Headquarters, the case
was being closed. The Staff Members asked if a form
letter was used whereby blanks were filled in and they
were advised this was not the case. The Staff Members
inquired if FBI Headquarters agreed with the closing and
SA Hamilton advised that to his knowledge, no communica-
tion was thereafter received from Headquarters which
would disagree with the closing of that case. The Staff
Members inquired as to whether SA Hamilton or anyone in
Atlanta conferred with any persons in the New York Office
of the FBI prior to closing the case and SA Hamilton
advised that to his knowledge this did not occur. The
Staff Members then inquired as to the basis for closing
the case on SCLC as compared with the basis for opening
the case originally. Hamilton advised he did not speci-
fically recall the wording of any commmications upon
which the case was originally opened, however, a review
of the case at the time it was closed did not indicate
that SCLC might be involved in any activities which
could constitute a violation of the Internal Security
Statutes. The Staff Members inquired as to whether the
investigation was based upon the Smith Act and SA Hamilton
stated he did not recall specifically seeing the words
"Smith Act", however, FBI investigations regarding communist
influence was based upon the communist goal of forceable
overthrow of the U.S. Government.

The Staff Members asked if, after the death of
King, whether Stanley Levison was in contact with Reverend

Ralph Abernathy, President of SCLC. They were advised by
Hamilton that that question was not related to the FBI's
investigation of Doctor Martin Luther King, Jr., and he
would decline to discuss that matter without further con-
sultation with FBI Headquarters representative in the
Atlanta Office. The Staff Members did not ask that
Hamilton then discuss that point with the Headquarters
representative. :

The Staff Members inquired as to the identities of
other FBI personnel assigned to the monitoring of the tech-
nical installation and SA Hamilton advised he recalled that
at that time SA Robert Thomson and SA John Benton were assigned
to monitoring, however, SA Hamilton could not recall the
identities of other agents assigned during the period of
time he was assigned to the monitoring of the installation.
Staff Members inquired as to the reason for SA Hamilton being
removed from the assignment of monitoring the installation
and Hamilton replied that he requested he be removed for the
purpose of being reassigned to security investigative matters.
Hamilton stated that shortly after discussing this desire with
Supervisor Harding, he was taken off the assignment and was
given other investigative assignments. They inquired as to
whether Hamilton questioned the propriety of the technical
installation regarding King and SCLC and Hamilton replied
that he did not question such propriety. The Staff Members
inquired as to the names Hamilton was instructed to listen
for on the installation and Hamilton replied he recalls being
instructed to listen for conversations of individuals by
the names of Stanley Levison and Harry Wachtel. They asked
if he was instructed to listen for conversations of indivi-
duals by the names of Helstein and O'Dell. Hamilton advised
the name Helstein was familiar although he could not recall
specific instructions regarding him but recalled that he was
instructed and did listen for conversations of Hunter Pitts
O'Dell.

Staff Members asked whether the Atlanta FBI Office
maintained subfiles regarding Doctor Martin Luther

King, Jr., or SCLC or whether the Atlanta Office or FBI
Headquarters maintained a JUNE file regarding King. SA
Hamilton advised he could not recall the maintaining of
subfiles and could not recall a JUNE file relating to
King. They asked if the FBI maintained a case regarding
Mrs. Martin Luther King, Jr., and SA Hamilton advised he
could not recall at this time whether such a file was
maintained on Mrs. King.

During the interview the Staff Members asked
who handled the arrangements for renting the apartment
where the technical installation was located and where
it was located. Hamilton advised the installation was
located in an apartment at 300 West Peachtree Street,
but he could not recall in which apartment it was located.
The inquired as to the identities of the individuals
who handled the rental and who made the tent payments and
SA Hamilton advised he did not know that information.
They asked whether or not FBI inspectors ever inspected
the installation or if during the course of an inspec=
tion of the FBI Office in Atlanta whether they visited
the installation. Hamilton advised he was not aware
of any inspection of the installation or visit of it
by inspectors.

The Staff Members asked if Hamilton could recall
any contact with King by any political personalities,
public officials, or officeholders, to which Hamilton
replied he could not at that time recall any such
contacts.

immediately assigned to the Security Squad. Im reply toa
question as to what type of investigations he handled,

SA Burgess replied that he was mainly involved in civil rights
type investigations.

Mr. Epstein asked SA Burgess when he was assigned
to monitoring the telephone tap of Doctor Martin Luther King, Jr.
SA Burgess replied to the best of his recollection he was
assigned to these duties from the end of November, 1965, until
sometime in June, 1966. SA Burgess was asked if he could pin
down exactly the date of his assignment to this monitoring
duty and SA Burgess replied that he recalled the general time

_peried quite well as he had recently undergone surgery before

this assignment and after extensive sick leave, went almost
immediately on the monitoring duty.

Mr. Epstein asked SA Burgess what his understanding
was as to why this telephone tap on Doctor Martin Luther King, Jr.
was being used. SA Burgess replied that it was his understanding
and recollection that three or four individuals who had heavy
and extensive Communist Party or Marxist affiliations and
connections had an inordinabé influence and control over
Doctor Martin Luther King, Jr. insofar as policies, objectives
and activities of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference
(SCLQ. SA Burgess replied it was his understanding that
these three or four aforementioned individuals' influence over
King extended so far as preparing his speeches and public
statements and that it was also his understanding that the
Attorney General at the time the telephone tap was instituted,
Robert Kennedy, had approved of and insisted upon this
investigative technique.

SA Burgess was then asked if he thought the telephone
tap on Doctor King was justified and SA Burgess replied that
he thought it was fully justified in light of the time and
circumstances and the position of Doctor King.

SA Burgess was then asked about the personal type
information regarding personal misconduct, whether or not
he felt the collecting of this type of information was
justified. SA Burgess replied that information regarding
personal misconduct or immoral activities on the part of
King was not the prime purpose or interest of the telephone
monitoring, but that he did feel that evidence of gross
personal misconduct and completely amoral activities was
significant in this particular case, bearing in mind the
original justification for the telephone monitor and the
fact that Doctor Martin Luther King, Jr. was a moral leader
of world stature and a religious personality. SA Burgess
said that he therefore felt a complete double standard of
personal conduct as opposed to public image was significant
inasmuch as such behavior would make Doctor King subject
to pressure or blackmail by the worst criminal or subversive
elements in our society.

SA Burgess was asked if the type of information
regarding Doctor King's personal misconduct was disseminated
to other agencies or the press and SA Burgess replied that
he did not know. SA Burgess was asked if he ever disseminated
any information regarding the personal misconduct on the
part of Doctor King to the press or others, and SA Burgess
replied he had not.

Mr. Epstein said that he assumed that SA Burgess
was aware of some of the allegations that had appeared in
the press regarding FBI dissemination of this type of
information, and SA Burgess replied that he was aware of some
of these allegations but he had no specific knowledge regarding
these matters. :

SA Burgess was asked if he ever reviewed the
communications regarding Doctor King based upon information
monitored, and SA Burgess replied that he merely recorded
the results of the interception of telephone conversations.

SA Burgess was then asked for the physical location
from which the telephones were monitored and if this physical
location was an apartment in the Peachtree Towers. SA Burgess
replied in the affirmative, but said he could not recall the
exact apartment number or the floor on which it was located.

SA Burgess was asked if the apartment from which
the telephones were monitored was a one or two bedroom
apartment and if he knew any of the neighbors or if he
recalled maid service to the apartment. SA Burgess replied
that he believed it was a one bedroom apartment, did not
wecall any of the neighbors and insofar as he recalled,
there was no maid or janitorial service.

equipment was located, SA Burgess replied to his recollection
it was in the bedroom of the apartment.

SA Burgess was asked if inspectors were at the
apartment and if odd-hour shifts were maintained. SA Burgess
advised that he recalled that odd=-hour shifts were maintained,
but he did not recall any inspection of the apartment.

Mr. Epstein asked SA Burgess if he recalled what
his duties were prior to the time that he was assigned to the
aforementioned monitoring and SA Burgess replied, general
security work and particularly civil rights cases which
included the observation of civil rights demonstrations in
various locations.

Mr. Epstein then asked about general policy regarding
observation of demonstrations, whether it came from Washington.
or originated in the field, and whether the instructions to
observe demonstrations came by SAC letter to the field.

SA Burgess replied that insofar as he knew it was the general
policy of the Bureau for a number of years to observe at any
type of demonstration involving civil rights type matters

where the possibility of violence existed so that firsthand
observation of any possible violation of Federal statutes
could be - had by impartial observers, and that any
subsequent investigation would not be dependent upon the
sometimes impassioned observations of persons on either side
of a controversial issue.

At this point in the conversation, Mr. Epstein
was reminded by SA Burgess that the purpose of the interview
was the investigation of Doctor Martin Luther King, Jr., and
Mr. Epstein replied that he was interested in observations
of vivil rights matters insofar as Doctor King was involved.

SA Burgess replied that the only specific demonstration
or civil rights activity he recalled in which he acted as an
observer where Doctor Martin Luther King, Jr. or SCLC was
involved was in Americus, Georgia, in 1965, and he could recall
very little regarding this matter. fee!

SA Burgess was asked at one point during the interview
if, during the time he served as a monitor on the telephone tap
of Doctor. King, there was a tap on SNCC. SA Burgess repdied
that he had no recollection of a telephone tap on SNCC, (Student
Nonviolent Coordinating Committee).

Mr. Epstein asked why SA Burgess was removed from
monitoring telephones mentioned above. SA Burgess said that it
was at his request as he had completely recovered from a
debilitating illness and was very frankly quite bored with an
inactive assignment.

; Mr. Epstein asked if SA Burgess remained on the
Security Squad in the Atlanta Office and what type of cases
he handled after that period. SA Burgess replied that he
did remain on the Security Squad until December, 1966 or
January, 1967, and that he had handled general security matters,
but not the investigation of Doctor Martin Luther King, Jr.

Mr. Epstein asked why SA Burgess was reassigned and
was advised it was a routine administrative reassignment,

Mr. Epstein then asked SA Burgess if he was quite
certain of his period of assignment to monitoring the
telephones of Doctor King and SA Burgess replied that he was
virtually certain that assignment to these duties was from
within ten days before or after Thanksgiving, 1965, until
sometime during June, 1966, because of the aforementioned
surgery approximately six weeks prior to his assignment
on these duties.

Mr. Epstein asked if SA Burgess could ascertain
the date of his surgery from his doctor or hospital records.
SA Burgess replied that surgery had taken place at St.
Joseph's Infirmary immediately adjacent to the FBI office
and he would attempt to ascertain the date. Mr. Epstein
asked if SA Burgess would be willing to telephone the
hospital at that time in an attempt to verify this date.

SA Burgess replied that old hospital records are sometimes
difficult to locate and from experience, it would probably
take two or three days.

In response to a question as to whether anyone
else immediately available could recall the date of this
surgery, SA Burgess replied that his wife might recall.
Mr. Epstein then asked SA Burgess if he would be willing
to telephone his wife in an attempt to determine the date of
his surgery. At-that point in the interview, SA Burgess
did telephone his wife who informed SA Burgess that she
thought SA Burgess had undergone surgery during mid-September,
1965. This was communicated to Mr. Epstein.

Mr. Epstein also asked SA Burgess whether or not any
record in the Atlanta Office would pin down the exact dates
of his assignment to monitor the King telephones. SA Burgess
replied that he knew of no such record.

Mr. Epstein asked if an amnual fitness or performance
report would show his assignment at that time, and SA Burgess

replied that he believed these performance reports merely |
stated general assignments, such as general security, etc.,
and the location of these reports were unknown to him.

Mr. Epstein asked if SA Burgess had seen his annual
performance reports and SA Burgess replied that he had.

At the conclusion of the interview, Mr. Epstein
asked if he might have SA Burgess’ home telephone number
and if he might call him at a later date to obtain from
.SA Burgess the date of the aforementioned surgery, if SA
Burgess was able to ascertain this date. SA Burgess did
furnish Mr. Epstein his home telephone number and advised
he would attempt to determine the date of this surgery.

of Martin Luther King were covered in this telephone tap.

purpose of this technical installation, to which he replied
that it was to determine the degree of subversive influence,
if any, over the activities of the SCLC sponsored civil
rights demonstrations and programs.

Inquiry was made as to who instructed the installation
of such technical coverage and SA Miller replied that he un-
doubtedly received these instructions from his immediate
supervisor and/or the Special Agent in Charge of the Atlanta
Office at that time. When asked whether these instructions
were written or verbal, SA Miller replied that he could not
specifically recall, but was reasonably sure that if written
they would have also been discussed verbally, both with his
supervisor and the Special Agent in Charge.

Telephone Company who provided such information and it

and was terminated at 3:10 P. M. Epstein asked all of the
questions during the interview. Haynes was not advised of
his rights or of the purpose of the interview. Early in the
interview, Haynes informed Epstein he was under the impression
the purpose of the interview was to obtain information re-
garding Martin Luther King, Jr., and Epstein confirmed this
explaining King, the SCLC*and the marches were so closely
related it was necessary to go into some of these things.

Epstein asked Haynes his title and was informed
Haynes is a Special Agent Supervisor in the Atlanta Office
of the FBI, supervising the Number 3 Squad which is generally
known as the security squad. He asked when Haynes became a
supervisor and was informed he was appointed in August, 1968.
Epstein asked who served as supervisor of the squad prior to
Haynes and was advised SA Charles S, Harding, now retired,

preceded Haynes as supervisor. He asked why Harding was
replaced and Haynes stated it was a decision made by the
Bureau. which was an administrative matter and not pertinent
to the inquiry regarding Martin Luther King, Jr. Epstein
did not pursue this question any further.

Epstein asked when the investigation regarding King
started and if there was a file open prior to the time the
investigation was authorized. Haynes replied he did not know
when the file was opened or when the investigation was
authorized. Haynes was. asked when the technical coverage
regarding King was instituted and when it was discontinued,
and he replied to the best of his knowledge it was instituted
during about November, 1963, and Haynes monitored it until
about January 4, 1964, when Haynes became ill from a kidney
stone attack, thereafter entering the hospital in Atlanta on
January 8, 1964. Epstein asked Haynes if he returned to
monitoring the surveillance later and Haynes replied that he
did not return to the assignment on a full-time basis, but
probably relieved other individuals monitoring several times
during a period which may have continued as long as a year.

Epstein asked when the King case was closed and
Haynes replied he did not know, but felt sure it was some-
time prior to April, 1968. Haynes was asked who made the
decision to close the file, and he stated he did not know.
Epstein asked when the SCLC case was closed and Haynes
stated he did not recall, but did remember that SCLC activity
"wound down" considerably prior to King’ s death, and even
more so after King's death to the point that the information
did not warrant maintaining the file in»a pending status.
When asked who gave instructions to close the file, Haynes
stated that he did not recall but that it was possible that
the Atlanta Office took the action closing the file, and it
was even possible that Haynes may have approved such action
administratively; however, he does not recall.

INTERVIEW OF FBI SPECIAL AGENT( (SA)
CHARLES T. HAYNES BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS

Epstein asked if it would be customary for New
York to send Atlanta any information they received regarding
Stanley Levison and if so what file it would be put in. It
was explained to Epstein it would be necessary to know the
nature of such information before answering such a question,
however, since Atlanta did not have any pending investigation
regarding Levison or SCLC there would be no reason for New
York to send any information regarding Levison to Atlanta
unless they had some reason to request information concerning
some pending investigation. Epstein pressed the question of
whether New York would continue to send Atlanta information
concerning Levison and he was informed, based on information
available at Atlanta, there was no reason for New York to
send the information to Atlanta regarding Levison, without
requesting investigation; however, it was possible that they
may have some reason for having sent information to Atlanta
for informational purposes.

Epstein asked where the monitoring of the King
technical surveillance was conducted and he was advised by
Haynes it was conducted in the Peachtree Towers Building.

He asked the room number and Haynes replied he did not
recall the room number but did recall it was on one of the
upper floors of the building. He asked who made the in-
stallation and handled the contact with the telephone company,
and Haynes replied he did not know, that the equipment was
in the apartment when Haynes was instructed to report there
for the monitoring assignment. Epstein asked who else was
present in the apartment at the time and was advised that

SA Alden F, Miller was present, connected the equipment

and instructed Haynes in the operation of the equipment. In
response to the question of other Agents monitoring the
technical surveillance at the time, Haynes stated to the best
of his knowledge he was probably the first Agent to monitor
the surveillance, with the technical assistance of SA Miller.

Epstein asked the name of the person who rented
the apartment at the Peachtree Towers and Haynes replied
he did not know. He asked if such information was available
in the files of the Atlanta Office and Haynes replied he

did not know, explaining that such information may have been
made a matter of record, and yet may not have been made a
matter of record, Epstein stated that at this point he would
- stop the questioning in order for Haynes to go upstairs to the
FBI Office and review the files to determine whether or not
such information was in the files, Haynes explained that such
a project would probably entail extensive file review in order
to state whether such information was, or was not, in the file.
Epstein asked if Haynes could have someone else conduct the
necessary file review regarding this matter, at which time
Haynes replied he would request a break at this point to con-
sult with an FBIHQ representative in the FBI Office. After
consulting with the FBIHQ representative for approximately
five minutes, Haynes returned to Senator Talmadge's office

and informed Epstein that the clearance for the interview was
based on what Haynes could remember regarding King and not

on information from the files. Epstein was advised that. any
request by him for information from the files should be submitted
in writing in the usual manner . Epstein did not pursue this
matter any further.

Epstein asked if Haynes knew Bill Sullivan and if
he recalled him coming to Atlanta. Haynes replied that he
did know Sullivan and recalled him coming to Atlanta in the
1960's at least on one occasion and possibly twice. Haynes
explained he recalled Sullivan coming to Atlanta in the early
or middle 1960's in connection with a regional type FBI
conference regarding developing and handling of informants
in Klan organizations, and possibly a second visit at a later
time, but no other details were recalled.

Epstein asked Haynes if he knew of any instance where
an Agent in Atlanta furnished any information regarding King
or the SCLC to the news media and Haynes replied he did not.

Epstein asked if Atlanta had a COINTELPRO file re-
garding King or the SCLC and Haynes advised it: did not. Haynes
was asked if he knew of any COINTELPRO information regarding
King or the SCLC and Haynes stated he did not. When asked
where such material would be filed, Haynes: stated that since
he knew of none he did not know where it would be filed. When
asked if such information could be in the case file, Haynes
advised it was possible.

Epstein asked if the Atlanta Office participated
in the COINTELPRO retrieval project and was advised by
Haynes he thought so; however, Haynes was not familiar enough
with the particular project he had in mind to be sure. Haynes
explained he had in mind a project around the first of 1975,
which had to do with declassifying certain previously identified
COINTELPRO correspondence and subsequently classifying some
material also connected with COINTELPRO. Epstein wanted to
know if any COINTELPRO information regarding King or SCLC was
included in this information and he was informed Haynes had
no knowledge of such, but the details of the project were -
handled by another Agent under Haynes' supervision. Haynes
was requested to identify the Agent and replied he would have
to have a few minutes to consult with an FBIHQ representative
in the FBI Office prior to answering this question. Epstein
contacted the FBIHQ representative in the Atlanta Office
telephonically, requesting him to come down to Senator
Talmadge's office and conferred with him for approximately
five minutes, during which time Haynes was not present. At
the conclusion of this conference, upon advice of the FBIHQ
representative Haynes informed Epstein the Agent who handled
the above-mentioned project was SA Edward A. Shea.

Epstein terminated the interview at 3:10 P. M.

INTERVIEW OF FBI SPECIAL AGENT (SA)
EDWARD A. SHEA BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS

SA Shea was then asked by Mr. Epstein about a re-
view project he had handled earlier in the year pertaining
to the Counterintelligence Program (COINTELPRO) in the
Atlanta Division and what it involved.

SA Shea mentioned that in approximately the latter
part of December, 1974, or early January, 1975, he had been
assigned to handle a project dealing with COINTELPRO in the
Atlanta Office.

FBI Headquarters (FBIHQ) had sent out communications
to various field offices around the latter part of December,
1974, or early January, 1975, relative to the COINTELPRO-Hate
Groups, Black Nationalist Hate Groups, New Left, and Communist
Party, U. S. of America (CP,USA). In these communications
FBIHQ had indicated it was in receipt of a request under the
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) for documents relating to
the COINTELPRO. As a result, FBIHQ had reviewed its files
on COINTELPRO and classified various documents. FBIHQ listed
these documents in work papers which were sent out to the
various field offices, including Atlanta, as enclosures to
the FBIHQ communications. These work papers listed documents
that were to be classified in each office and recipients
were instructed to review the work papers to make sure all
copies of ‘these documents classified by FBIHQ were so classi-
fied in the field office files on COINTELPRO. These work
papers showed the classification assigned to the particular
document, the identifying number of the classifying officer,
the exemption category and the date it was classified by
FBIHQ.

In addition, these FBIHQ communications instructed
the recipient field offices to review its various COINTELPRO
files, such as the ones on the Hate Groups, Black Nationalist
Hate Groups, etc. to insure that all other documents in these
| files which were classifiable were so classified. These
| were to include memoranda and letters to other offices, etc.
The office that originated the communication had the re-
sponsibility of notifying other recipients of these
communications so their copies could also be classified.

INTERVIEW OF FBI SPECIAL AGENT (SA)
EDWARD A. SHEA BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS

Based on these FBIHQ communications, SA Shea,
who handled this project by himself, located all the documents
listed in the FBIHQ work papers and classified them according
to the information set out in the work papers.

In addition, SA Shea also reviewed each of the
Atlanta COINTELPRO files on the categories previously mentioned,
for any further documents that should be classified.

SA Shea recalled that in this part of the review he
did locate various documents in these files which he felt re-
quired classification.

SA Shea could not recall any specific documents
that he so classified but did remember classifying a number
of documents in the COINTELPRO-Hate Group file and COINTELPRO-
CP,USA file. These documents selected by SA Shea were then
classified, and copies designated for any other Atlanta files
were then located and classified; in addition, FBIHQ and other
field offices that had been furnished copies of these documents
were then notified by Atlanta to locate their copies of these
documents and classify them according to information furnished
by Atlanta. :

SA Shea pointed out to the SSC Staff Members that
he recalled that subsequently FBIHQ had sent back communi-~
cations to Atlanta relative to documents SA Shea had classified
in both the COINTELPRO-Hate Group and COINTELPRO-GP,USA files.
FBIHQ instructed that all those classified by SA Shea in the
COINTELPRO-Hate Group file be declassified as they did not
warrant classification and also a number in the COINTELPRO-
CP,USA file also were to be declassified, which was done by
SA Shea.

The SSC Staff Members then inquired if during this
review of the COINTELPRO files, whether SA Shea had noted any
COINTELPRO actions, any recommended actions, or any COINTELPRO
suggestions which were directed against Reverend Martin Luther
King, Jr., Coretta King or the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference (SCLC). SA Shea indicated that in carrying out
this project, his purpose was first to locate the COINTELPRO
documents listed by FBIHQ in their work papers and classify
them; next he was also to review the Atlanta COINTELPRO files
to see if any other COINTELPRO documents prepared by Atlanta
required classification.

U. S, SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE
TO STUDY GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS

INTERVIEW OF FBI SPECIAL AGENT (SA)
EDWARD A, SHEA BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS

In handling this project, SA Shea was primarily
interested in classifying the documents in these COINTELPRO
files and little notice was made of any specific COINTELPRO
actions actually being recommended in these documents. SA
Shea pointed out that in his review he did not recall any
COINTELPRO action that had been directed or recommended
against Reverend King, his wife, Coretta, or SCLC.

SA Shea was then questioned as to whether he could
recall in his review, having to classify any Atlanta COINTELPRO
document in which a copy may have been designated for the case
file on SCLC, and SA Shea indicated that he could not recall
or remember anything specific on this.

Mr. Epstein then inquired if the Atlanta Office
had any COINTELPRO files which only pertained to organizations,
in which all information relative to a particular organization
like the Young Socialist Alliance (YSA), or the Socialist
Workers Party (SWP) would be located. SA Shea indicated there
was no such specific breakdown in the Atlanta COINTELPRO files
as they were set up under broad group categories, such as Hate
Groups, Black Hate Groups, New Left, etc.

Mr. Epstein then asked if SA Shea had ever been
involved in handling any COINTELPRO matters when he was
assigned to the Cleveland Office or whether the Cleveland
Office ever had any COINTELPRO actions against Reverend King
or SCLC. SA Shea indicated that he understood that the
questioning of him would be limited to his review of the
Atlanta COINTELPRO files earlier in the year, for the classi-
fication purposes; SA Shea suggested that this should be
discussed with the FBIHQ representative, who was in the Atlanta
Office at the time, to resolve this; however, Mr. Epstein did
not pursue this. :

Mr. Epstein then inquired, that prior to the FBI
instituting the COINTELPRO, and prior to the various field
offices setting up COINTELPRO files, if some Agent made a
suggestion about a counterintelligence action, would such a

suggestion, say in the form of a memorandum or letter, be
placed in the case file of the organization or the individual
against whom the action was being directed. SA Shea indicated
he had no knowledge of any such suggestions ever being made
in the form of memoranda, letters, etc., suggesting a counter-
intelligence action being directed against anyone or any
organization prior to the institution of the actual COINTELPRO
by FBIHQ.

Mr. Epstein then asked, if when FBIHQ instituted
the COINTELPRO and the various field offices set up COINTELPRO
files, was there any retrieval of any documents made from any
files dating back prior to the commencement of COINTELPRO,
that were then placed in any of Atlanta's COINTELPRO files.

SA Shea indicated that in his review of the various COINTELPRO
files earlier in the year, he had not noted any such indi-
cation of this.

Mr. Epstein then asked if SA Shea was aware of any
review program dealing with COINTELPRO in which any documents
were removed from COINTELPRO files. SA Shea stated emphatically
that there was no program to ever remove any documents dealing
with COINTELPRO from Atlanta's COINTELPRO files or from any
Atlanta files.

On several occasions during the interview of SA

Shea, Mr. Epstein would come back to his line of questioning
about SA Shea's review of the COINTELPRO files earlier in the
year and whether SA Shea could recall any COINTELPRO action

- or COINTELPRO suggested action against Reverend King, Mrs.
King or SCLC. SA Shea on each occasion pointed out that he
could not recall seeing any documents in any of the COINTELPRO
files which related to any such action directed against the
Kings or SCLC.

Mr. Epstein on one occasion asked SA Shea if, during
the time he had been assigned to the Atlanta Office, he had
ever hear of any COINTELPRO action, or any suggested action,
directed against Reverend King, his wife, or SCLC, and SA
Shea replied that he had not.

Mr. Epstein also asked if SA Shea was aware of
any COINTELPRO action or recommended action being made
after FBIHQ has discontinued the COINTELPRO, and SA Shea
indicated he knew of no actions or recommendations being
made,

During the interview, Mr. Epstein did most of the
questioning and Mrs. DeOreo took extensive notes; both SSC
Staff Members were pleasant and cordial during the entire
interview, which ended at approximately 10:37 A, M.

Director Secty —

Michael Epstein, Staff Member, Senate Select Com-
mites requested that Staff interview be arranged with
lor Sevmor Phillips s concerning the Bureau's investigation of
sari Loree bs . .He requested the interview be held at
10 a.aivy He was advised that this was not possible
and that sometime next week would be more acceptable. It was

agreed that the interview would be conducted at 10 a.m. on
Monday, 8/4/75.

In. view of the ongoing discussions between the
Department, representatives of the King family, and the Senate
Select Committee concerning Committee access to information con-

_ cerning Martin Luther King, Michael Shaheen was contacted con-
. cerning this interview.

It was pointed out to Mr. Shaheen that Mr. Phillips
had a great ‘deal of knowledge concerning the King investigation
and it could be assumed that information would be disclosed
during interview which might contravene an agreement with the
King family should such an agreement become perfected. Since
the Department was to meet with representatives of the King
family and Senate Select Committee members on 7/31/75, it was 4)
suggested that any decision concerning Mr. Phillips’ interview
e held in abeyance pending a resolution of this problem. Patil
Shaheen agreed.

Shaheen subsequently advised SA Daly that the meeting
with the King family representatives, Senate Select Committee
representatives and the Department. ‘had not resulted in an agree-
ment. He said he had discussed the pending interview of
Mr. Phillips with the Committee Staff representatives and they
said they would furnish guidelines. concerning the topics to. be
covered during the interview. Shaheen indicated these guidelines
would be consistent with the King family's. concerns regarding the
production of information from Bureau files. cone

a RE: SENSTUDY 75

Steven Blackhurst, Deputy Special Counsel for
Intelligence Coordination, later advised Inspector Hotis that
SA Phillips could discuss any aspect of the investigation other
than information developed through wiretaps or microphone
surveillance. Mr. Epstein assured him that he was not ‘interested
in the substance of any conversation that might have been overheard,
but would inquire into such procedural matters as. the number of
wiretaps installed and the identity of persons who authorized them.

RECOMMENDATIONS :

(1) That SA Phillips be released from existing employ-
ment agreement for purposes of this interview, consistent with
the above limitations.

(2) That an Intelligence Division representative
be available but not present during the interview of SA
Phillips in the event that questions arise concerning the
proper scope of the caren

e@ EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT Se

As consideration for employment in the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBD, United

States Department of Justice, and as a condition for continued employment, { hereby declare
that I intend te be governed by and I will comply with the following provisions:

(1) ‘That I am hereby advised and I understand that Federal law such as
Title 18, United States Code, Sections 793, 794, and 798; Order of the
President of the United States (Executive Order 11652); and regulations
issued by the Attorney General of the United States (28 Code of Federal
Regulations, Sections 16.21 through 16.26) prohibit loss, misuse, or un-
authorized disclosure or production of national security information, other
classified information and other nonclassified information in the files of
the FBI;

(2) I understand that unauthorized disclosure of information in the files -
of the FBI or information I may acquire as an employee of the FBI could
result in impairment of national security, place human life in jeopardy, or
result in the denial of due process to a person or persons who are subjects
of an FBI investigation, or prevent the FBI from effectively discharging its
responsibilities. I understand the need for this secrecy agreement; there-
fore, as consideration for employment I agree that I will never divulge,
publish, or reveal either by word or conduct, or by other means disclose to
any unauthorized recipient without official written authorization by the
Director of the FBI or his delegate, any information from the investigatory
files of the FBI or any information relating tc material contained in the-files,
or disclose any information or produce any material acquired as a part of the
performance of my official duties or because of my official status. The burden.
is on me to determine, prior to disclosure, whether information may be disclosed
and in this regard I agree to request approval of the Director of the FBI in each
such instance by presenting the full text of my proposed disclosure in writing to
the Director of the FBI at least thirty (30) days prior to disclosure. I understand
that this agreement is hot intended to apply to information which has been placed
in the public domain or to prevent me from writing or speaking about the FBI but
it is intended to prevent disclosure of information where disclosure would be
contrary to law, regulation or public policy. I agree the Director of the FBI is
ig a better position than I to make that determination;

(8) I agree that all information acquired by me in connection with my official
duties with the FBI and all official material to which I have access remains
the property of the United States of America, and I will surrender upon demand
by the Director of the FBI or his delegate, or upon separation from the FBI, any
material relating to such information or property in my possession;

(4) That I understand unauthorized disclosure may be a violation of Federal
law and prosecuted as 4 criminal offense and in addition to this agreement may
be enforced by means of an injunction or other civil remedy.

I accept the above provisions as conditions for my employment and continued employment

in the FBI. I agree to comply with these provisions both during my employment in the FBI and
following termination of such employment.

OFFICE OF SHE ATTORNEY GHVERAD

. May 15, 1956.
ORDER NO. 116-56

It is the policy of the Department of Justice to extend the fullest
possible cooperation to congressionsl committees requesting information from
departmental files, interviews with department employees, testimony of depart-
ment personnel, or testimony of Federal prisoners. ‘The following procedures
are preseribed in order to effectuate this policy on a basis which will be
mutually satisfactory to the congressional committees and to the Department.
(This order supersedes the Deputy Attorney General's Memorandum No. 5, dated
March 23, 1953, and his Memorandum No. 97, dated August 5, 1954. It formal-
izes the Attorney General's press release of November 5, 1953, establishing ~
procedures to permit committees of the Congress and their authorized repre-
sentatives to interview and to take sworn testimony from Federal prisoners.
It supplements Order No. 3229 (Revised) dated January 13, 1953, and Order
No. 3464, Supplement No. 4 (Revised) dated January 13, 1953 (with Memorandum
of "Authorization Unfer Order No. 3464 Supplement No. 4 (Revised)" dated
Jonvery 13, 1953), insofar as said orders have reference to procedures to be
followed in the Department's relations, with congressional committees. In
support of this order, reference should be had to the President's letter
dated May 17; 1954, addressed to the Secretary of Defense, and to the Attorney
General's Memorandum which accompanied it.]

A. REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION FROM DEPARTMENT FILES

1. Congressional committee requests for the examination of files
or other confidential information should be reduced to writing, signed by

_ the chairman of the committee, and addressed to the Deputy Attorney General,

who is responsible for the coordination of our liaison with Congress and
congressional'committees. The request shall state the specific information
sought as well as the specific cbjective for which it is sought. The Deputy
Attorney General will forward the request to the appropriate division where a
reply will be prepared and returned for the Deputy Attorney General's signa-
ture and dispatch to the chairman of ,the committee.

2. if the request concerns a closed case, i. e., one in which
there is no litigation or administrative action pending or contemplated,
the file may be wade available for review in the Department, in the presence
of the official or employee having custody thereof. The following procedure
shall be followed in such casés:

a. The reply letter will advise the committee that the
file is available for examination and set forth the
Mame, telephone extension number, and room number of
the person whe will have custody of the file to be

Z reviewed; :

4



| NW 65360 Docid:32989626 Page 123

. b. Before making the file available to the committee
representative all reports and memoranda from the FBI
as well as investigative reports from any other agency,
will be removed from the file and not be made available
for examination; provided however that if the committee
representative states that it is essential that information
from the FBI reports and memoranda be made available,
he will ve advised that the request will be considered
by the Department. Thereafter a summary of the contents
of the FBI reports and memoranda involved will be
prepared which will not disclose investigative tech-
niques, the Identity of confidential informants, or
other matters which might jeopardize the investigative
operations of the FBI. This summary will be forwarded
by the division to the FBI with a request for advice as

- to whether the FBI has any objection to examination of
such summary by the committee representative. The file
will not be physically relinquished from the custody of
the Department. If.the committee representative desires
to’ examine investigative reports from other government
agencies, contained in the files of the Department, he
wlll ve advised to direct his request to the agency whose
reports are concerned. ~«

Peo

3. Z£ the request concerns an open case, i. e., one which liti-
gation or administrative action is pending or contemplated, the file may
not be made available. for examination by the committee's representative.
The following procedure Shall be followed:

a. The reply letter should advise the committee that
its request concerns a case in which litigation or
administrative action is pending or contemplated, and
state that the file cannot be made available until the
“tase is completed; and

b. Should briefly set forth the status of the case in
as much detail as is practicable and prudent without
jeopardizing the pending contemplated litigation or
administrative action.

B. REQUESTS FOR INTERVIEWS WITH DEPARTMENTAL PERSONNEL

1. Requests for interviews with departmental personnel regarding
any official matters within the Department should be reduced to writing,

signed by the chairman of the committee, and addressed to the Deputy Attorney

General. When the approval of the Deputy Attorney General is given, the
employee is expected to discuss such matters freely and cooperatively with
the representative, subject te the limitations prescribed in A respecting
open cases and data in investigative reports}



NW 65360 Docld:32989626 Page 124

a@ memorandum outlining his testimony with a copy routed to his division head
and a copy routed to the Deputy Attorney General.

D. REQUESTS OF CONGRESSIONAL COMMITIEES FOR THE TESTIMONY OF FEDERAL PRISONERS

Because of the custodial hazards involved and the extent to which
their public testimony may affect the discipline and well-being of the institu-
tion, it is the policy of the Department not to deliver Federal prisoners out-
side the penal institution in which they are incarcerated for the purpose of
being interviewed or examined under oath by congressional committees. However,
when it appears-that no pending investigation or legal proceeding will be
adversely affected thereby and that the public interest will not be otherwise
edversely affected, Federal prisoners may be interviewed or examined under oath
by congressional committees in the institution in which they are incarcerated
under the following procedures, and with the specific advance approval of the

‘Deputy Attorney General.

1. Arrangements for interviewing and taking of sworn testimony
from a Federal prisoner by a committee of the Congress or the authorized
representatives of such a committee shall be made in the form of a written
request by the chairman of the committee.to the Deputy Attorney General.

2. Such written request shall be made at least ten (10) days
prior to the requested date for the interview and the taking of testimony
and shall be accompanied by written evidence that authorization for the
interview or the taking of sworn testimony was approved by vote of the com-
mittee. Such réquest shall contain a statement of the purpose and the sub«
jects upon bir the prisoner will be interrogated as vell as the names of
all persons other than the representatives of the Department of Justice who
will be predents

3. A member of the interested committee of the Congress shall be
present during the entire time of the interrogation.

other witness who is not e prisoner.

5. The warden of the penal institution shall have complete
authority in conformity with the requirements of security and the mainte-
nance of discipline to limit the number of persons who will-be present at

E, OBSERVERS IN ASTENDANCE “AT COMMITTEE HEARINGS ©

matters Within its responsibility, and in order that the Deputy Attorney
General may properly coordinate the Department's liaison with Congress and
its committees, each division that has an observer in attendance at a

NEWS CONFERENCE OF CLARENCE M. KELLEY

DIRECTOR, FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

7 JULY 14, 1975

MR. KELLEY: Good morning. 4 I have very few statements to make as.

an opening. I just want to say that this is a further

attempt on my part to be a little nore available.

Frankly, it is something which I hope we can continue

and I.have not in the past been premeditatively evasive

nor reluctant to appear before you. But, frankly, I've
been pretty busy with a number of other things. I want to
let you know that we're continuing our efforts to try to
improve the rapport between us. We will continue to do
some things and hopefully, in the future we can get together
more frequently on the basis of some of our past meetings
which I think have been very fruitful. So now I'll throw
it open for questions and these lights are a little bit
strong but I'll try to be able to identify you. Do you
have any questions?

QUESTION: : Do you have any evidence, sir, or any information leading
you to suspect any CIA Agents have been planted in any man-
ner or form in any executive agencies for the purpose of
. transmitting evidence back to the CIA about that agency?

MR. KELL I have no evidence whatsoever brought to my attention

and I certainly know of none.
QUESTION: Sir, do you have ongoing programs trying to check out

that sort of thing? Do you look for it?

NW 65360 Docld:32989626 Page 144



MR. KELLEY:
QUESTION:
MR. KELLEY:

We have no ongoing programs whatsoever and have had no

reports that it has occurred and this is something new

to us.

Sir, there have been complaints repeatedly in recent days
from Congressmen and Senators on the Hill who are charged
with investigating the FBI and its domestic surveillance

in past years that they are not getting the information
that they need. We heard from Senator Church maybe yester-
day. Can you respond to that?

The allegation has been made to the effect that the FBI

is dragging its feet, so to speak, and slow to respond

to the requests of the Church committee for information
relative to past abuses by the FBI in the intelligence field
and it's even been said from time to time that this reluc-
tance is reflective of an effort to preserve the image of
Mr. Hoover. First, I want you to know that in giving
instructions in this matter, it has been consistently

my policy to say that we should be completely candid

and forthright. And we should respond in whatever manner
we can consistent, of course, with some restrictions--those
being a matter of confidentiality and right to privacy.
Insofar as dragging our feet, the letter which was sent to.
us was dated May 14, 1975. We immediately embarked on a

program to try to respond. In May, 1975, I remember it was

NW 65360 Docld:32989626 Page 145



the last half of May, we devoted 323 man days to try to re-
spond and to date have added another over 400 hours and it's
a total dedication of personnel--of 102 of our people.
We have 102 people who are responding to this request.
The reason why it has taken this much time and this great
amount of manpower is that we must ‘go. through all of
this material very carefully to preserve, of course,
the privacy of those who may be mentioned and also to
assure that matters of grave import are no so
disclosed. We are trying at best we can to resolve
in favor of making them available. I think this number
102 is very significant inasmuch as in the work of the
Freedom of Information, there are also over 102, about
105 people, dedicated to fulfilling our obligations there.
So, we have almost 210 people engaged in these two
enterprises and this has a great impact upon our capabili-
ties. Does that answer your question?

QUESTION: Can you tell us why Senator Church would be complaining?

MR, KELLEY: Why he what?

QUESTION: Why he would be complaining?

MR. KELLEY: No sir, I don't know. Some of these things, of course,
may be thought to be too slow and it's thought perhaps

that all you have to do is to remove the material from

NW 65360 Docld:32989626 Page 146



_ NW 65360 Docld:32989626 Page 147

oer: @ a
Ee eeNenner aes j !

the file and send it on up. We have already submitted

a great deal of it and intend within the next 10 days to
complete the entire matter.

QUESTION: Is in any of that material now in the Justice Department
awaiting approval of the Attorney General?

MR. KELLEY: Yes, some of it is in the hands of the Department ready
to be.transmitted. That's our first step--after we make
our survey, to ship it over to them, they review it and then
send it on through. ;

QUESTION: Well, has it been there for a while?

MR. KELLEY: I can't tell you exactly what length of time but I can say

: that within about 10 days, we'll have ours completed and
you can gage thereafter what type of delay is experienced
through the Department. ,

QUESTION: Mr. Kelley, Senator Church says that you won't allow him
and his staff to interview FBI Agents and that's one of
the complaints he makes about the lack of cooperation.

Is that true that you will not allow the Senate staff to
interview FBI Agents?

MR. KELLEY: We have gone through a procedure whereby ex-FBI Agents
may have available to them our people in order to consult
with them as to any matter which might, be thought to

violative of some of the confidentiality provisions; and



Cn aes @ @

we have not, to my knowledge, denied the right of anyone
presently employed to be interviewed with, of course arin
the requirements that if they want to consult with us

they ‘may do so.

QUESTION: Well, in other words, you're saying ‘that FBI Agents aa
be interviewed by the Senate staff. “Is that correct?

MR. KELLEY: Let me just check that. Mr. Mintz, is that correct? Have

i we denied any?

MR. MINTZ: We have not denied any. We've not indicated to anyone
we would not let them be interviewed.

QUESTION: What was that Mr. Kelley, about ex--I didn't understand,

; : “about ex-FBI Agents?

MR. KELLEY: Ex-FBI Agents, when called, and we're advised, are informed
that one of our people can be present outside the inter-
view room for consultation by that interviewee with our
people to determine whether or not a certain question is
beyond the purview of his capability, and we do not say to
him that he cannot answer but we do say here are the rules,
the regulations, the law and you can be guided in accordance
with your own dictates. But wé make available to him a con-

sultant, so to speak.
|

| .
| QUESTION: Is that a requirement or..?
| :

MR. KELLEY: That's an agreement between us.

QUESTION: In other words, when an ex-Agent goes up, he has to have

somebody?

ea ardent ta el ret renee te de - 2 nein ee ee ee eee eee eee

No sir, he does not have to have but we inform him that
he may have if he so desires.

During your confirmation hearings two years ago,

you advocated or said that you would like to see

more Congressional oversight of the FBI. You think now
that there's too much, just about right, or not enough
oversight?

It is true that I said during my confirmation that I do
not object to FBI Congressional oversight. One has been
established and I have met with them on several occasions
to set an oversight committee. There is also a House
so-called oversight committee--it's the House Judiciary
Committee--there are others who may by virtue of their
jurisdiction feel that they, too, have oversight. We do
no oppose House oversight. Frankly, I would like to have
a joint committee of oversight so that we can know
precisely to whom we should report and they, in turn, know
precisely to whom any oversight problems can be referred.
Basically, in other words, I do not object to oversight--
t do think that it would be much better if we could have
it well-structured so that it will be clearly understood
by all parties concerned as to what they are going to do

and: how they are to do it.



QUESTION:

MR.

KELLEY:

QUESTION:

MR.

KELLEY:

@ : e

Mr. Kelley, do you feel the oversight being conducted now
between the Senate and House is probing too deeply into the
FBI--do you feel that any of the operations of the FBI have
been hurt by the investigations going on now?

I do not construe the activities of the oversight a

as having delved too deeply into the work of the FBI. We do
on occasion feel that perhaps some matters need protection,
particularly those involving national security, but I have
no objection in the exchange in oversight groups of any
matter in which we are engaged. I think, as a matter of
fact, that this is a proper balance insofar as keeping us
in line and I also welcome it inasmuch as it gives us an
opportunity to explain just what and how we do things. I
do not object to the exchange, in other words.

Mr. Kelley, you said that you're not attempting to preserve
the image of J. Edgar Hoover and, apparently, you know
what will be in the information that is to go out of your
office in 10 days. Can you tell us, when that information
gets up to the Hill and assuming it's made public, are there
going to be some more bomb shells about the FBI that we
haven't heard about or is this all information which has
generally been made public?

I don't know of any bomb shells, so to speak. In the news
media, there have been many things discussed, many reports
made, and in those matters I think that just about every-

thing that we know about has been already, at least to

NW 65360 Docld:32989626 Page 150



terete @ a @

some extent, discussed and, to some extent, publicized.
I am convinced that in these matters where there might be
some criticism, there is an underlying intent to do that
which is good for the Nation. I have not come across any
activities which I would construe as being illegal, being
directed toward personal gain or to enhance the reputation
of anyone. I see nothing untoward in these activities, in
other words, as they will be reviewed by the various groups.
QUESTION: Now, Mr. Kelley, Mr. Sullivan said about a week ago, that

he assumed there had been some national security break-ins

—e

over the years and I'm just wondering if there have been
national security break-ins, say in the last five years,
roughly what number are we talking about and why aren't
: they illegal? What's the legal authority?
MR. KELLEY: There have been statements made about surreptitious
entries and the latest was that statement made
by Mr. Sullivan who just retired as the Assistant
Director in Charge of the Los Angeles Office; and there
have been, of course, reports in the media that the
Department of Justice has been inquiring into allegations
that our people have engaged in surreptitious entries or,
as they are sometimes termed, burglaries. Yes, the FBI
has conducted surreptitious entries in securing information

i relative to the security of the Nation. However, in 1966,

NW 65360 Docld:32989626 Page 151



ate a @ @

all such activity was terminated with the exception of -~
a small amount of actions which were conducted in connection
with foreign counterintelligence investigations which we
felt had a grave impact upon the security of the Nation.
And again, a I just said, I feel that the FBI personnel
participating in or approving such activities acted in
good faith with the belief that national security interests
were paramount and their actions were reasonable. I'm
always mindful of a story I heard Many years ago about two

t neighbors who started some arguments which, obviously,
were going to terminate into difficulties. One of the
neighbors started a campaign to build himself up with
shadowboxing, punching the bag and so forth, and it appeared
very likely that he was going to be in pretty good shape :
in order to beat up his neighbor and so the neighbor,
thereafter, concerned as to what would happen to him,
started to defend himself. You don't wait until the Ve
climax which could be the putsch--you start preparing
yourself and so I think that the FBI and its officials
construed this as paramount again in the protection of
the country.

QUESTION: . You said that in 1966, there were a small amount of

burglaries. I'm just wondering how small is small and

MR. KELLEY:

QUESTION:

who gave the OK. Did this come from President Johnson -
or Président Nixon or was this a decision made by Attorney
General..... ,
This matter will be discussed in subsequent hearings
and in reports, and further than what I have stated, I
cannot comment.

Mr. Kelley, were these directed against Americans or
foreign pérsons?

I would prefer not at this point to make any comments
further and particularly not in particularity as to who
may have been the ones against whom they were directed.
Well, were they all conducted in this country or were
some conducted overseas? ;

I know of none overseas. :

Sir, going back to prior to 1966, why was the procedure
changed in 1966? ,

By virtue of the feeling of Mr. Hoover that, under the
then-prevailing philosophy and the feeling that possibly
in the context of the times, this was not a viable
procedure--they were stopped. It was Mr. Hoover's
decision.

Sir, can we infer that there were quite a number, a
large number, of burglaries prior to 1966, but fewer

since then?

-~10-

NW 65360 Doctd:32989626 Page 153



MR. KELLEY: You cannot infer anything because I have not told you
of any number. I can only say that they were stopped
in 1966. As to the number, I cannot actually tell you how

many nor can I say that it's quite a number or very few.

ANSWER:

NW 65360 Docld:32989626 Page 155

Why can't you tell us the number?

Because we're going to make reports to our Congres-
sional groups and to the Department of Justice and,
frankly, I can't tell you the number myself. We
don't have any....

They did not entirely stop in 1966? There were
some that did get, you say, a small number after
1966?

There may have been some after 1966 which were,

of course, in the field of foreign counterintelli-
gence, and such that it would make a grave impact
on our....

Before that, they were not with the field of foreign
counterintelligence?

Oh, yes, there were some in that field also.

There were others that were not in the field of
foreign counterintelligence before 1966?

You recall that I said in the context of the time,

it may well have been that prior to that time national
security or counterintelligence or whatever terminology
you might want to use could have included other areas.
But, then you began to compartmentize various types

of activities and then it became evident that the

area of foreign counterintelligence national security
certainly should be differentiated from domestic
security.

But, Mr. Kelley, what policy have you followed in
the time that you have been Director? Is this type
of activity, has it been permitted? Is it policy
now to conduct this kind of activity?

I have not had a single request to conduct such
activity since I have been made Director. If ever
anything of this type comes up, and I can't foresee
this need, but, if it ever did come up and it became
a matter of grave concern, a matter which is to be
solved only through such activity, I would present
it to the Attorney General and would be guided by
his opinion as to such activity. Frankly, I have
not had any such request since I have come aboard.

-12-



QUESTION: Is that in the foreign field, Mr. Kelley. Is that
limited to the foreign field when you say such
activity?

ANSWER: Yes, sir. Foreign intelligence, counterintelli-

gence, national security, whatever terminology
you want to use.

QUESTION: Back prior to 1966, were any of those in say
organized crime investigations?

ANSWER: I know of none.

QUESTION: Would you characterize, Mr. Kelley, what areas they

were in, please. What areas the pre-1966 burglaries
took place? Characterize the kinds of investiga-
tions they concern?

ANSWER: I can not at this point characterize them because I.
just don't know how they were to be characterized.
But, it could be that, I would guess, that the
great majority of them are what we now term counter-
foreign, counterintelligence, or national security.
I would say that in all probability the geat majority

concern is.

QUESTION: Have you reviewed them from a legal point of view
to determine whether any of them at all were con-
ducted without proper legal authority?

ANSWER: We have discussed ‘them with the Department, and will
place them in their hands and they will make such
a review.

QUESTION: I wanted to ask you if this goes back to World War

II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Cold War

QUESTION: Is it possible to get court authorization by warrant

permission. There is some dictum to indicate, at
present, that this may be brought up later. But, I
know of no authorization which can be obtained per se
for a surreptitious entry. And, at this point, of
course, the feeling is that these confined as they
are to foreign counterintelligence it flows from
presidential authority as it applies also to the
warrantless wiretaps.

Weren't the civil rights groups, Mr. Kelley, among
some of the organizations who were burglarized?

I'm not going to say anything about where they were,
or against which organizations they were directed,
only to say that they were, Mr. Nelson, and I hope
that will satisfy you, and I hope that if there is
any revelation to be made later that they can be as
complete as possible because, again, we feel that
the intent was a very good one and there was no
illegality concerned. And the impact of it was to
protect the country. :

Sir, how can you say that there was no illegality
concerned if the Constitution says that you have to
have a search warrant to make an entry and without,
as I understand it, even checking this with the
Attorney General, these Agents burglarized private
premises?

The resolution of the problem which you now present
is up to the Department and the courts, and I, of
course, will not engage in anything except to say
that in the defense of the men who authorized and
participated, that they had this intent and within
every criminal violation there is a necessity that
there be the ingredient of intent and there was none
here as far as I can determine.

Mr. Kelley, would you say, sir, that most of these
requests for surreptitious entry flowed from presi-
dential authority? Is that what you said, sir?

No, I did not say that. I did not give a complete
outline as to what the authorization was. And, this
again will be a matter which will be discussed in

the reviews of the Department and the various Congres-
sional committees.

QUESTION:

ANSWER:

Sir, would you say that the Cubans who burglarized
Daniel Elzberg's:psychiatrist's office should not
have been convicted then since they thought that
they were on a national security mission? They
didn't intend to violate any laws. That was their
testimony.

I have no judgment insofar as that because my
province is in presenting the facts and for the
review and determination by the courts and if such
an inference was made it was not intended by me

to give them any sanctuary. I'm trying to keep in
the area of our facts and that particular thing as
to whether or not they had any intent or whether or
not it is a viable defense is up to the courts.

Mr. Kelley, did you twice mention that you expect
some resolution to this question in the courts?
How is it going to get into the courts?

I don't know. It possibly will be some sort of a
defense, rather some sort of a presentation to the
courts by the Attorney General. He has indicated
that perhaps this being a Constitutional question--
it being a matter of the executive privilege of the
presidential power~-that it might well be necessary
to have such a review to determine.

Were all of these break-ins conducted with the
permission of either the Attorney General or the
President at the time? Or were there any that were
conducted without such approval?

I cannot, at this point, give you any particulars
about the program. I just say, as I did before,
and this....

Because you don't know or because you're withholding
comment?

I'm withholding comment.

Mr. Kelley, I'm still unclear about distinction
between break-ins before 1966 and afterward. Is the
reduction in number the only change that was made or
was there change in the limitations on the targets
that were used?

There was a change insofar as the targets just being

in the subsequent area confined to those matters which
were concerned in foreign counterintelligence.

that also for the good of the country?

ANSWER: Your statement, was that also for the good of the
country to do that, to damage the reputation, was
not the issue. As you pose your question, you
answered substantially my response that would be
made. Yes, I think that the purpose here was to
do something that would ultimately end to the
benefit of the Nation. In other words, I think
in the so-called COINTEL Program, which you men-
tioned, that the intent there was one which had



adequate basis. As to the programs, now, indi-
vidually activities within those programs may be
suspect. I have said and repeated that some of

those activities I would not feel are proper today. I
wasn't there during the time that all of these programs
were developed, nor certainly the approval of the
various activities within those programs. Were I to
have been there, there is some that perhaps I might
have said, "No I don't think this is proper." TI have
the benefit of hindsight. I have the benefit of exper-
ience in local law enforcement which, I think, prepares
me to better understand perhaps the impact of some of
these types of things. They are not at all unknown in
the field of law enforcement. In some degree or another
almost all the law enforcement has engaged in some
similar types of activities. Not perhaps to the sophisti-
cation as the COINTEL Program, but the context of the
time is felt necessary in the present day. We realize
that different standards should be applied and they are
and we do not engage in those activities now. Since
April, 1971, we cut them off.

(NOTE TO CORRESPONDENTS AND EDITORS: The preced-
ing comment by Mr. Kelley concerning local police
use of efforts similar to COINTELPRO may be open
to misinterpretation. At his direction the FBI
later issued his clarifying statement: "I had in
mind that law enforcement agencies have used
methods designed to create disunity among the
criminal element, particularly in organized crime
and hoodlum gangs. Probably most common was
labeling a crime figure as a police informant

to discredit and destroy his criminal influence.
These activities to pit one crime figure against
another have achieved success in neutralizing
the criminal element.")

QUESTION: You said that you disagreed with some of the activities,
that they were not proper programs. Alright, does that
mean that there are variations of COINTEL Programs
still going on?

ANSWER: In the first place, we deliniate certain programs.
That's the overall structure of the full system.
Within each of these programs there were some activ-
ities, individual activities. I feel that the setup
of the programs certainly was directed properly, that
is, with the intent to preserve the Nation. Insofar
as some individual activities, yes, I feel that some

were, in today’s context particularly, imprudent and

being investigated by the Department and is being
investigated by the various committees, particu-
larly the Select Committee of Congress and, I'm
not saying that Clarence Kelley engaged in such

I'm merely saying that these have been presented

at some length and any publicity that might be
given them will be that which will be given by
those more knowledgeable than I.

Mr. Kelley, to your knowledge have any members of
the FBI been involved in the planning or execution
of assassinations?

No, sir. I know of none.

Mr. Kelley, how about the break-in of embassies
here in Washington. Have any members of the FBI
gained surreptitious entry into any embassies in
Washington?

Without naming or designating victims or insti-
tutions, I can only say that there were a few
concerned with counterintelligence--foreign in
nature--subsequent to 1966. Further then that
I cannot say.

A few is 10, 20, 100? When you say few, I'm sure
that I'm lost as to how few is a few.

Not many.

Was a lot of this done in Washington as opposed
to other cities in the country?

There were not a lot, I'm confident of that. And,
frankly, I don’t think that all of the few were
confined to Washington, D. C., but I can't tell
you absolutely that that is true.

Is there any agreement with the Justice Department

not to prosecute people who may stray from or ~
commit crimes but, rather to handle it with
internal discipline?

not operate under such arrangement. No, there is

conclusion. I can assure you absolutely that
this is my policy, is the policy of the Bureau,
and that we will pursue them as vigorously as
we possibly can. There's nothing worse in my
estimation than the betrayal of trust and that's
what we have when one of your own people defects
and gives sanctuary and assistance to the
cerminal world.

How do you account than for the fact that there
has been no one who has strayed across the line
in all these years? It's almost unhuman.

Well, I appreciate your compliment, Mr. Kelly,
which I agree with, there has been none. There
have been, of course, some allegations made

from time to time, all of which have been pursued
and found to be groundless. I think that it's
inherent in an organization which is closely
serutinized, an organization which has a strong
inspection system but, more than anything else,

is the choice of people who are not susceptible

to this type of thing. Unquestionably, in such

a screening process some might get through.

But, than, within the FBI is a built-in system
which further prevents this possibility and that

is a tremendous pride in this very matter. That
is, that there has been no corruption. And, I

am confident that Agents working with one another,
although, will, of course, on occasion be sym-
pathetic to an Agent who possibly may be drinking
too much or may possibly, for other reasons in

the area the morals might digress to some extent,
they absolutely will not countenance corruption

or defection to the criminal element or otherwise
contaminate that splendid reputation of the Bureau.
It's a unique situation. It's difficult for some
to understand. But, it's a built-in barrier to

an extension of this type of activity and, some-
thing of which we will have tremendous pride and I
personally would not hesitate one second to pursue
any allegations such as this, feeling that although
it may get wide publicity, although it may, to some
extent, harm the credibility of the FBI, it must

be done. And, I assure you, will be done. Unusual
perhaps, but nonetheless, it is present and we will
persist with this type of activity. We don't ask
our Agents to squeel on one another, we point out
the splendid reputation that is inherent within
our tradition and is one of the finest traditions
you can possibly build.

QUESTION:

MR, KELLEY:

QUESTION:

MR, KELLEY:

Mr. Kelley, earlier you spoke of the advantages and limitations
of hindsight. After having examined the records of the break-ins
and other surreptitious activity, you observed that you thought it
was well intentioned, I believe, in most cases. Did you also
observe that there was any gross misuse of authority inthe -°
process of that?

I do not note in these activities any gross misuse of authority.

I see a consistent thread of well-intentioned activities. Perhaps
now in the present society, and in the context of now and in those

times, I do not feel that it was a corruption of the trust that

"has been placed in us. As now we have determined a valuation

that perhaps could be wrong, but in those days there was no
intention to engage in activities which were prohibited, illegal,

or otherwise wrong.

Mr. Kelley, why wouldn't an act like the bugging of Martin Luther
King's hotel room have been a betrayal of trust? These Agents
took an oath under the Constitution and that was prohibited by
Federal law at that time. ,

There have been a number of articles written about this situation.

“In reviewing this situation, I feel that the authority stemmed from

the proper source. It was a matter which was construed in those
times as of considerable concern to the country, and the FBI acted

in accordance with the request which was made that it be installed.

You say that it was a matter which was then a violation of the
law. Within the warrantless wiretaps under ordinary circum-
stances they could conceivably be construed as a violation, but
under the umbrella of the protection of the country they have

been authorized, so I don't subscribe to the feeling that they

- knowingly, in such an installation, vilated the law with the

intent to violate the law.

Mr. Kelley, do you still--does the FBI still--compile personal
information on the personal behavior of Members of Congress,
members of the press, and other people?

The FRL receives a great deal of information from time to time.
We are charged when we have a complaint to write up that :
complaint. We feel that not only are we following the archival
rules that such must be recorded, but also we feel in discharge
of our duties we should record it because such information might
well dovetail with some investigation that we are conducting.
People come to us to tell about these things for reasons--not

just to spill out gossip and rumor and to possibly put someone

on the spot. We inform them, for example, at the time they
submit this information a record will be made’ of this but if it is
outside the jurisdiction of the FBI we so state. They know before
they leave, for example, that nothing will be done about it other

than to record it.

with the responsibility of looking into this then within a few

after a statement appeared in the paper mentioning these files ;

make a listing of them, categorizing them. ‘Some of them, of

reasonable guideline which says we either do or do not preserve
them. 1 am anxious for us to do our work the way it should be ,

Mr. Kelley, there have been suggestions that your absences
from Washington for family reasons have prevented you from
getting the kind of control of the Bureau that you would have if
you were here all the time. Iam wondering how you respond

to that kind of suggestion?

confident that the executive staff of this Bureau is solidly behind
me. I say this inasmuch as I have somewhat a feeling such as

McWilliams, and John McCaffrey, attended this Soviet Operations
course at CIA Headquarters, The course ran from May 14 to
May 25, 1973, Special Agent McCaffrey only attended one week
while Rice and McWilliams attended for two weeks,

The primary reason for FBI inclusion in this course
was because, at that time, the three Special Agents were
members of the new Training Unit, INTD, and we were seeking
educational guidance and ideas for our basic CI courses then
under development. We benefited from this course because we

i borrowed a few educational ideas and techniques from CIA's
method of handling its course,

Director Sec'y

To advise review of pages 188, 189, 283 and 330 eh.
of Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)_« document which Senate 4/7"
Select Committee has had access to and which reportedly
makes reference to extremely sensitive Bureau operations
determined such pages do not compromise or damage FBI
operations or sources which relate to IS-l1 Section. The
CIA document is fully identified in memorandum from
Mr. W. O. Cregar to Mr. W. R. Wannall dated 7/24/75 under
instant caption. ‘

Re page 188

This page reveals CIA began to follow Caribbean
black radicalism in earnest in 1968 and as a result CIA's
Directorate of Intelligence published studies on 8/6/69
and 6/12/70. This page revealed in each of these studies
there was a single paragraph devoted to ties with U. S. black
power movement and primarily concerned visits of Stokely
Carmichael and other U. S. black power activists to the
Caribbean. The second study was to pay special attention to
links between black radicalism in the Caribbean and advocates
of black power in U. S. This page reveals these studies

did not provide meaningful evidence of important links between
militant blacks in the U. S. and the Caribbean. g/
RECEB V4 HS,

These CIA studies were furnished FBI, Laat
157-8415-247 and 190-12-324-257. The 8/6/69 study revealed
the Jamaican Government had officially banned the travel
to Jamaica by Stokely Carmichael, H. "Rap" Brown and James
Forman. These individuals were hot further identified and
no additional information was set forth in thab™stttdy= ~some
concerning their possible travel to Jamaica. ~

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: SENSTUDY 75

The study on page 13 reports "Unlike its fairly frequent
contacts with Black Panthers and other radicals in the U. S.,
the Castro Regime seems to have refrained from more than
occasional communications and expressions of moral support
for the Caribbean groups." No specific data is set forth
regarding contacts between Black Panthers and other radicals
in the U. S. and the Gastro Regime. Paragraph number 33 on
page 13 of this study notes that the extent of relations
between black power groups in the Garibbean and similar
organizations in the U. S. is vague. Activities of "the
more activist Negro leaders in the U. S. such as Stokely
Carmichael and Elijah Muhammad have been followed closely
in Jamaica and other places. There have been visits by
Carmichael and other U. S. black power exponents to some
of the Caribbean Islands." The study notes these visits have
been limited in the past two or three years because of a ban
on the travel of certain U. S. Negro spokesmen by the
Governments of Jamaica, Antigua and Trinidad-Tobago. The
study notes the latter government had refused to permit
Carmichael to enter the country despite the fact that he is
a native of trinidad.

The 6/12/70 study on page seven noted that available
evidence suggested that contact between Caribbean groups and
the black power. movement in the U. S. is infrequent. It
reported there was a two-way flow of visitors including
occasional speaking tours by Carmichael and one or two other
radicals. It was presumed that exchanges of views and |
sharing of information occurred but the study noted there
was no firm evidence of funding or direction by U. S. groups.

There is no data on page 188 or published in the
two CIA studies which would compromise or damage FBI operations
or sources.

Re page 189

This page indicates that for several months in the
first half of 1968 the Caribbean branch (apparently of the
Director of Current Intelligence, CIA) wrote periodic typescript
memoranda on Carmichael's travel abroad during a period when he
had dropped out of public view. This page indicates that it was
felt these memoranda were for internal CIA use only although
a copy of one such memorandum was inadvertently sent to the FBI.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: SENSTUDY 75

Bureau file 100-446080 contains numerous communications
from CIA concerning Stokely Carmichael's activities and travel
during late 1967 and early 1968. These memoranda included
data concerning Cuban Intelligence Service contacts with
Carmichael and his travel, including trips to North Vietnam
and Algeria.

It is probable these memoranda were furnished FBI
due to our interest in establishing the degree of foreign
influence or funding in relation to Carmichael's activities
in the U. Ss.

Data on page 189 and in the memoranda furnished by CIA
concerning Carmichael's whereabouts during this period does
not compromise or damage FBI operations or informants.

Re page 283 7

This page noted under date of 12/10/70 that "DDI"
noted press accounts of Director Hoover's 11/19/70 statement
reported that the Black Panthers are supported by terrorist
organizations. This page reveals’ that someone: with CIA had
examined FBI's related files and also those of CIA and could
locate no indication of any relationship between FEDAYEEN and
the Black Panthers. This page revealed a CIA employee provided
"Director," probably the CIA Director, with a memorandum-:on
this topic.

FBI Annual Report for the Fiscal Year 1970 released
10/30/70 revealed the Black Panther Party (BPP) ideology showed
an increasing emphasis on the teachings and writings of the
Premier of North Korea; that BPP spokesmen repeatedly
confirmed their belief in Marxism-Leninism; that the inter-
national influence of BPP grew with support groups being organized
in foreign countries; and a BPP international staff was
operating in Algeria. The Annual Report revealed the head of the
BPP International Staff had established a relationship with
Al Fatah, the Arab guerrilla organization, which relationship
had manifested an outpouring of anti~Semitic and anti-Zionist
propaganda in the BPP newspaper. i

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: SENSTUDY 75

Since the reference to Mr. Hoover's statement
concerning support being received by the BPP has been made
public, the data on page 283 would not damage or compromise
FBI operations or sources.

Re page 330

The three paragraphs under the caption "Black
Radicalism" on this page briefly summarized the data reported
by CIA on page 188. Data on this page does not compromise
or damage FBI operations or sources.

Re: Further Documents Pertaining to the

Policies and Procedures
(Appendix B, Part I, Item l.a.)

NOTe:

The material to be reviewed consists of clean
Xerox copies of the approximately 335 selected SAC
letters and Memoranda, Each of the SAC Letters and
Memoranda was reviewed by the following Divisional
representatives who cleared such material for review
by the SSC Staff with respect to their Division's
interests: Identification - J. T. Stewart, Training -
J. 8. Reilly, Administrative - F. Woodworth, Files and
Communications - H. R. Hauer, General Investigative -
J. W. Hines, Laboratory - R. F. Petty, External Affairs -
D. L. Divan, Special Investigative - J. &, McHale,
Inspection - F. B, Griffith, Legal Counsel ~- P. V. Daly,
Computer Systems - C. D, Neudorfer, INID reviewers vho
cleared the above material with respect to INTD interests
for reviewing by the SSC Staff were: J. W. Johnson
(1971 - 1972), H. W. Dare (1962 - 1966), R. D. Hampton
(1968 - 1973 - 1974 ~ 1975), R. L. Moore (1964 - 1965 -
1967), K. A. Mendenhall (1960 - 1969), and T. &. Burns, Jr.
(1961 - 1963 - 1970). Excisions were made in the material
by the above INID personnel with regard to protection of
sources, third agency considerations and with respect to
sensitive methods and techniques. Since the material is
to be reviewed at FBI Headquarters and in order to expedite
the process of making the material available and avoid
unnecessary extensive effort, the various SAC letters and
Memoranda have not been classified nor have they been
excised with regard to privacy considerations in all instances.
The SSC Staff representative(s) will be orally advised of the
above at the time of their review at FBI Headquarters. Should
the SSC Staff seek certain specific copies of the SAC Letters
or Memoranda, those items selected will then be appraised
with regard to classification and privacy considerations,
prior to furnishing any copies to the SSC Staff for
their off-premises perusal. None reviewed pertained to OPE
responsibilities.
