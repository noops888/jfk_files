Puerto Rico.

Background file research Indicates that Ray received a-
graduate scholarshIp from the Cuban Ministry of Publle
Works In 1947 to study clvIl engineering at the University
of Utah. He returned to Cuba.In 1949 and was appointed

a designer for the Cuban National Development Corporation
and then chlef of {tts structural department In charge of
bridges and highways. In 1952 he became project manager
for Frederick Snare Corporation of New York In construction
of the Havana Hilton Hotel. In May, 1957, he organltzed
the Civic Resistance Movement (MRC), an underground
organization which supervised acts of sabetege against

the Batista regime. Following the Revolution, Ray was
appolInted Hinister of Public Works by Castro In February,
1959. He officlatly resigned his position in November,
1959.

During the interview, Ray sald that he had been active In
anti-Castro activity, organizing underground activity In
Havana, prior to his resignation as Minister of Public
Works. Hts brother, who reportedly tater committed sulcide,
had been arrested by Castro tn March of 1959 for counter-
revolutionary activity. Ray sald his anti-Castro
activity eventually ted to his founding the Revolutionary.
Movement of the People (MRP) around May of 1960. Among
those Ray mentloned as betng.also Instrumental. In the
founding of the MRP were Rufo Lopez-Fresquet and Rogelto
Cisneros.

When asked, Ray said there were no Americans tInvolved in the
founding of ‘the MRP, He sald, however, that there was one
who. had been active with him in anti-Batista operations and
later gave him support for his anti-Castro activities. His
name was Ira Wolfe. "He was very close to me personally and
we considered him Tike a Cuban," Ray sald. At the time,
Wolfe was a sales representaty¥e for a kitchen equipment
firm and married to a Cuban. “After he left Cuba, he was
dtvorced snd went to work for what Ray described as a
telephone company-related firm In Texas. ~He dled there about
flve years ago at about 55 years old. Ray described Wolfe

as tall, heavily bullt, with black halr and a round face.

Although Ray sald he was not as close to htm as he was

to Ira Wolfe, another man who provided anti-Castro support
and was active on his own In anti-Castro activity was
Wolfe's brother-in-law, the brother of his Cuban wife.
Ray sald he didn't at the moment remember his first name,
but his last name was Rosello. Ray sald he had known him
for a number of years because he worked for a firm that
sold ceramic. tile and that he had sold the tite for the
tunne! through Havana which Ray had been in charge of
buliding In the mid-'50s. Roselfo, sald Ray, was somehow
involved In the sale of weapons to Israel. Ray belleves
that Wolfe's ex-wife, Angela Rosello, may be living tn
the Miaml area.

Ray sald he had been In touch with Individuals connected
with the Amerlcan Embassy In Havana both before and after
oy) he Castrq Revolution. One contact he recalls was with
i itm Knoel,/the first of which was around September, 1958.
tay sald, noel jtotd htm that he represented an agency

Interested In tntelligence and propaganda and he wanted
Yo exchange ideas and information concerning the Z6th

of July Movement. Ray sald he seamed particularty Interested

In whether or not there any Communists with Castre In
the Sterra Maestra.

to meet with! Knoel About: the time he went underground with

After the Titineet Bs Ray said, he recelved another request
anti-Castro activifles. That was a general mesating about

what was happening at the time but It resulted In the setting
up of a channel for the passing of messages between them later.

Ray sald thatf/Knoek}did not offer him any financlal support

at the time, t+ he later promised equipment which was supposed
to be air dropped to MRP guerillas the Escambray mountains.

The equipment never arrived and{knoe| later told tim there
was a "mix up" sald Ray.

Ray sald he was unfamtft tar with and had no contact with
David Phillips or Col. Sam Kal! at the Amertcan Embassy.

Ray sald he first met Antonto Vectana In Puerto Rico after
Vecltana came Into exite. Although Vectana was a mehber of
his MRP movement at the time, Ray sald that Veclana's
-attempt to assassinate Castro In October, 1961, In Havana
was not officially planned or sanctloned by the Movement.
Ray explained that, as the leader of the MRP, he did not
belleve that leadership. assassination should be a key part
of the Movement's strategy. He sald It had too many “bad
aspects" to It as a strategy, the princlpal one belng It
misted the members of the movement Into belleving that the

movement would be successful as soon as the opposition leader

was removed, That, sald Ray, has a "weakening effect" on
a movement's over-all. strategy and the reason why he never

-more-


sponsored a plan to assassinate Castro. "However," sald
Ray, "that doesn't mean we should not take the opportunity
to do so If It arises."

Ray sald Seat, although he never met Veciana In Cuba, he
knew of him and his support of the MRP at the time. "I know
that he was very close to Rufo Lopez-Fresquet, the Minister
of Finance, and that he was working at the bank and that
through Lopez-Fresquet he was able to get some contributions:
to the Movement. 1 know he was very active."

Ray sald that he heard through the underground that Veclana
was planning the Castro assassination attempt and that he
had gotten a bazooka for It. He tater heard that Veclana
himself had left Cuba the day before the assassination
attempt and that he later gave the excuse that he had to
helptsome people excape In a boat and that he had to Jump
Into the boat himself to do so. "The story was that the
attempt fatled because of the confusion that followed after

he tet," sald Ray. .

Ray sald that thdre was no Indication at the time that an
American was behind Veciana's planning of the assassination
attempt. He knew of no American that Veclana might have
been assoclating with at the time. Ray said he could not
identify Maurice Bishop, nor did his characteristics or
sketch resemble anyone he knew, although he sald there was
some resembiance to a U.S. government official he met In
Tampa-when he first arrived tn exile. He sald he met

at feast four government officlals In Tampa while being

put up In a motel there, but he wasn't told whether they
wore CIA or FBI. Ray sald he doesn't recat! even the name
gtven to him of the one who resembled Bishop and he doesn't
recall.that it was "BIshop."

What Ray does recall about his Initial debriefing tn Tampa
when he entered the U.S. In October or November, 1960,

was that he was eventually told that a Mr. Frank Bender
wanted to talk with him. Bender then arrived and he had

@ long conference with him. Ray sald he got the Impression
that Bender. was mostly..Interested In.hIs philosophy about
how Cuba should be governadn after: the overthrow.-of. Castro,
but. Ray said he-found It a bit strange that Bender was
specifically: Interested in the future of the King Ranch

In Ray's viston of the future of Cuba. "I don't think

he ilked my answer.too.much,".said Ray, "because | told

him that the most Important thing. was to develop the
overall economy ofthe country. and that, although | had ><:
nothing agalnst.the King Ranch, they would have to contribute
more to the economy of the country. ! don't think he liked
that answer too much.”

(hen asked, Ray sald he was not famillar with the name
of Jack Matone who, according to a fille review, was assoclated
with fhe King Ranch tn Cuba.)

Ray sald he subsequently had a number of meetings with
Bender In Miami, a few of which concerned his and the

MRP's Jolning of the untted Frente prior to the Bay of

Pigs Invasion. Ray was asked Tf he was aware at the

time of the opposition of the CIA's political tlalson,

E. Howard. Hunt, to his Joining the Frente. [ln his book,
Give Us This Bay, Hunt potnts to Ray's Joining the Frente
as oné of fhe key reasons he resigned his position.

Ray sald he was not specifically aware of Hunt's opposition
to him at the time. He said, In fact, that he never met

E, Howard Hunt, or "Eduardo," but knew only that the CIA's
"Golden Boy,” as he was known, Manolo Artime, had the
personal support of a very Influential and powerful government
official whoy, Ray sald he later found out, was Hunt.

Rey sald thet

tan r ti Ris Bock and of
his relationship to the. Frente was misteading. Ray sald

he was not anxious to Jofn The Frente and that he resisted
dolng so for some time. "We were In touch with the feaders
of the front at the time,” sald Ray, "people Ilka Tony
Verona, and we told them, why should we Join and be so
restralned as you, why should we want to become part of

the sétuation Just to be like a poker chip with somebody.
elss running the show and not knowing what you are fighting
for?” Ray also sald that because hIs group was so well
organized within Cuba at the time and had deep underground
penetration, some other exile Cuban groups were aiso not
anxlous to welcome him In the front because they were Strold
he wold take control of It.

Ray said opposition to him also came from certain Influential
and wealthy, anti-Castro Americans who saw the Frente as -: 7
<a, "soclal ctub” where. they could have Influence and, If. succe St
reap thelr benefits later In Cuba. He specifically cited Es
Whiltam pouley as one such. Ray sald he met Pawley only once.
"AT The time," he satd, "there was a tot of heavy propaganda.
agalnst us going around Miami. They were saying 'Fidelissim
stn Fidel' and that type of thing, accusing us of being
Communists. One of-the members of our organization happene
to. have an office close to Pawley's ‘and got to meet him and
then arranged a meeting between us. ~So | went to meet him,
It.was very Interesting because | found the man very arrogant.
We started discussing Cuba and the future of Cuba and so forth,
and then he sald he:was-gotng to be.sincere with-me. “He sald
he believed that when Fidel. was overthrown It -would be.better
'fol were assassinated and that somebody might. Just do It."

Ray also revealed another Instance concerning mention of
assassinating him. That was shortly after March, 1961,
and the formation of the Cuban Revolutionary Counsé!l was
announced, with Ray as a key member, Ray sald he had

a very close friend who had been a detective under Batista
and had also had contact with the FBI both before and
after the Revodution. Ray characterized the friend as
"a very honest man," despite the fact he worked under
Batista, and one he trusted. After the Council was
announced, Ray sald, this friend called him and told him
he had been at a meeting composed of former members of
Batista's Bureau of Investigation, called BRAC, which
Ray characterized as "a repressive organization." Ray.
sald: "One of those at this meeting In this house In
Milam! totd my friend that they belleved that Castro was
going to be overthrown by the United States and that
since | was getting too much power, they should eliminate
me. My friend warned me that | should be careful. He
said they made mention of using an American to do the
job of kififng me instead of a Cuban. Even now I do not
know If the CIA had anything to do with that, or whether
It was Just-thls group of Batistdites." Ray sald that
at the time he was told that. the teader of the group

was named Faget (first name unrecollected), who Is now
dead. (Ray sald he believes his son Is working for U.S.
Customs tn Miamt,)

Ray sald he had heard of Frank Florin! about that time

but he never met him, "| heard of Florint,® he sald,

"and |. was’ told that he was something IIke an adventurer,
aman of actlon with many contacts, but | had no direct
knowledge of him. He was Involved more with the Batisttanos.”
Ray sald he knows of no relationship between E. Howard

Hunt and Frank Florin at the time.

Concerning the Castro assassination attempt tn Chile In 1971
organized by Antonto Veclana, Ray sald he was not assoclated.
with It nor did he know of anyone, except for Vectana hIimsel
Involved with It who had previously worked with hIm. He was
told, however, that Luis Posada may have been Involved, and
he remembers Posada aS someone Cisneros once recrulted for
an Inftttration misston Into Cuba. "Later," sald Ray, "I found
out he was so close to the CIA | decided not to use him ‘
anymore,” Ray sald he does not know Lucito Pena.or his
Involvement In the Chile attempt.

Speculating as to who could have Introduced Maurice Bishop
to Veclana, Ray sald there Is the possiblilty that Rufo

Lope: resquettcould have been the IInk without knowing
. ufo Ts a good friend of mine,” sald Ray, "but he

usually talks too much to be directly Invo¥ved In
clandestine activity. But at the time Rufo had very
close assoclation with high government offictals and

the CIA and | know that he and Veciana were very good
friends and In the same business sphere. | would say he
may have mentioned Veclana's name to some of those people
and they contacted Veclana as a result, knowing from

Rufo of Veciana's feelings about Castro.”

Ray's feelings toward Veclana took a negative turn In 1972, #
he said, when he was organizing the Parte Partido Revoluctonario
de Pueblo (People's Revolutionary Party) In Puerto Rico.

This was, sald Ray, a great effort to reinvigorate the
anti-Castro movement, Ray said that Vectana wanted to

become part of the group. "At that time," said Ray, "we

knew he was working In Bolivia and traveling around

Latin America ‘and we thought he could be of help to us."

Ray sald that Veclana promised that he could get $10,000

to contribute to the movement, but the money was never

produced. "Almost as soon as he Joined,” sald Ray

“he began participating In an attempt to divide the

movement. _He made a declaration accusing us of being

In consortment with Castro and he knew that was a Ile.
Everything he said was just so unbelievable and he had

things printed about me In Replica accusing me of everything.

He Just made everything up. Ray blames Vecltana for

the tack of success of the movement and says he does not
understand why he attacked him. Baslcalyy, he sald, he
“belteves Veciana Is an opportunist.

Ray was asked }f he was famillar with the Moa Bay Mingng
Company. He sald he was. He recalls a meeting around
June, 1959, when he was stif! In Castro's cabinet. "We
wotld meet at the Banco International everytThursday tn
the afternoon with a group that dealt with. the economic
Problems of the new government," he sald. "Lopez-Fresquet
was the Finance Minister at the time. At one meeting, tf
- remember Regino Botl, who was Minister of Economics, sald
iethat the peoplé from Moa Bay had contacted him to see what
could be done with the government to re-establish thelr
operation.:. They had about a $70 miliion Investment. But
Castro sald not to deal with them because they had worked
“too, close with the Bat$sta government."

ssRay was asked If he remembered where he was on November

75 22,. 1963. Around that. time, he Saltd, he was spending most
of his time In Puerto Rico but flying regularly to varlous
countryes In Latin America. The day that Kennedy was killed,
he said, he was-at a°JURE meeting In Ceracas, Group leaders
from varlous countries were there, he said, and he remembers
; the assistant to the President of Venezuela coming In after
ebunch with the news that President Kennedy was shot.

Ray sald he also recalls that Rogello Cisneros was at that
JURE hieeting. When told that a file review revealed that
Cisneros was reportedly scheduled to be Involved In a
pick-up of a chebe of arms on Regaldo Cay on November 23,
1963, a date which was changed to November 25th at the
last minute, Ray said he recalled generally such an
opesation. "Ye had a boat In Costa Rica and we were supposed.
to pick up some weapons. there but there was a mix up. I
can't recall the details or the date eaactly," he said.
"Actually, Clsneros was the coordinator of such operations.
! was Informed of them, but he was the direct coordinator
after they were Improved.” :

Ray was asked about his relationship with Andrew St. George
who, according to file review, was with him on an attempted
Inflltration Into Cuba. "I think | first met him In Havana,”
sald Ray, "when he passed through there on the way to the
Sierra Maestras to see Castro. 1! met him several times later
when I came Into exile and we exchanged Information and
ideas. -He has something about him, a sincerity, that 1
tike."

Ray said he was not aware of the close relationship between

Andrew St. George and Mitchel! Livingston WerBell I1tl.
Asked If he had ever had any dealings with WerBell, Ray
sald: "The sunavabitch. . 1 would like to punch him In the
nose, If you will forgive my saying that." Ray said his

feelings about WerBell are based on an Incldent that happened

In the Dominican Republic In 1965, At the time, after two
fallures, a final major Inflitration operation Into Cuba

was belng planned. "This was to be the first of a series

of long and. slow steps to bulld.a permanent opposition

movement against Castro Inside Cuba. This’ was supposed to

be a very significant operation, not Just another quick :
raid." Ray sald he had already had his share of problems ~

with the operation before his encounter with WerBell. Origtnall
Tt was to be based: out-of Costa Rica, but political problems
developed there and he had to move the operation out. He
made arrangements to send the Infiltration boat, the Venus,
on to the Dominican Republic with its grew to set up a base *
there. Meanwhile, a supply of arms that were especially
fabricated for JBRE In’Californta were selzed in California
(They had been financed, sald Ray, by a major "Buy-A-RIfle-Fo
$92" campaign among Cuban exI!es; more than $100,000 was e
ralsed.) Then came the revolution In the Dominican Republic ==
and the appearance on the scene of Mitchell WerBell. Ray

sald he frantically made arrangements with the Venezuelan
government to move his base of operations there and sent $750
of his personal money to the crew of the Venus for fuel to
move the bodt as quickly as possIbJe to Venezuela and out from
betwean the warring factions In the Dominican Republic. However,

what he later discovered, Ray sald, was that WerBell was
conspiring with hts boat's crew, and malnly its leader,
Jose Rabell, to convince them to go to Miami with the boat
Instead of Venezuela. That, of course, aborted the
inflitration operation, "That's how WerBell stole our

boat from us,” sald Ray. “After that our whole effort to
get going agatn failed. By that time | was completely
broke." Ray sald he never di@ find out why WerBall was

tn the Dominican Republic or why he stole the boat from :
them. "I belleve he was a CIA man," said Ray. Ray sald he
eventually wound up giving the boat to Nino Diaz for his
anti-Castro operations. q

Ray was asked about the Incldent concerning the vistt of

“"Leon Oswald" to Stivia Odio. Ray sald that when he was

first questioned about it by the FBI, he was asked mostly
about his feelings about her relltability and accuracy.
"They told me that she said she had met Oswald,” he said.
"I don't remember them telling me. that the men who came to
her. said they were members og JURE and were interested In
buying arms. i don't think that was toid to me. i Toid
them that | knew-she had some domestic problems and that
she was under.emotional strain from her divorce when she
was tlving here In Puerto Rico, but t told them | would
say she was sane, I think she was a good person, a very
bright person and a sane person.”

Ray was asked If he was ever told that Silvia Odlo's syster
also saw the three men who.visited her apartment. He :
seemed surprised. "t never did know that!" he sald. "That
to me-has.a-lot of beartng. They never did tel! me that.
This Is. the. first time | learned about. that.”

Ray sald that at the.time he knew of no members of JURE
going through Dallas In search of:money of arms.. He
does not recall anyone by the name.of Leopoldo.or Angelo.

“,assoctated with JURE at the time..-Ray sald he had no
* Amertean:contacts. In Datlas or major financial support

from. anyéne there.

Rey also sald he did: not recognize.or had no assoclation

‘Bernardo DeTorres, Sam Acosta, Larrie Schmidt, Robert

Morris, Tony Sforza, Warren Frank and David Morales.
