MEMORANDUM FOR: Anthony A. Lapham

October 7, 1977

FROM eet : ALR. Cinquegrana ‘
Office of General Counsel |
; SUBJECT : BLUEBIRD/ARTICHOKE Soft File Review - "Kelly" -
' Dimitrov, D.A.

1. Ihave been reviewing summary sheets prepared by the Office of
Security concerning several hundred soft files on individuals associated,
or considered for association, in some way with the Agency's BLUEBIRD/
ARTICHOKE activities. In the course of that review I came upon the follow- ©
ing case which I discussed with Dick Lansdale and which we agreed should
be brought to your attention for your information and whatever action you
may deem appropriate.

2. As is indicated in the attached copy of the soft file summary and
the 27 January 1952 memorandum upon which it is based, D. A. Dimitrov,
designated "Kelly," is a Bulgarian expatriate who appears to have been
imprisoned in Greece some time in 1950 and 1951 on false pretenses because
the Agency feared he would accept an offer from French Intelligence. After
six months in custody, he was flown to Panama where he was misrepresented
as a psychopath and confined in a U.S. Military Hospital for several months.
The official security file shows he was then removed from the hospital and
held by the Agency at Fort Clayton in Panama for three years. He was then
returned:-to Greece and ultimately allowed to enter the U.S. as a refugee.

_ It appears from the attached copy of a 7 February 1952 memorandum that. -
the "Artichoke approach," i.e., the use of drugs to reverse his hostility
toward the U.S. and U.S. intelligence agencies, was never consummated.

3. This man has had several contacts with the Agency since coming
to the U.S. In 1961 an Assistant to the DCI was contacted by a representative
of Parade magazine who had been informed by Dimitrov of his confinement
by the Agency. The Office of Security responded to the effect that this man
was disreputable, unreliable, and full of wild stories about CIA. As you
will note from the attached transcript of an 8 September interview on Good
Morning America, Mr. Dimitrov (now General Dimitrov and known as General
Donald A. Donaldson) apparently is alive and alleging that he knows who
ordered the assassination of President Kennedy.

4. Based solely upon the soft file summary, and prior to reviewing
the official security file from which I extracted the additional details, it
appeared to me that the nature of the Agency's treatment of Dimitrov might

: be something which should be brought to the attention of appropriate -

i officials both within and outside the Agency. The fact that he is still

: active and is making allegations connected with the oman assassination
may add yet another dimension to this story.

Soft File Summary

Title of File: Kelly

Brief Biographic Data: Kelly's true name is :
DIMITROV, a 29-year-old. Bulgarian who was head of
a small political party based in Greece and »,
ostensibly working for Bulgarian independence.

Nature of Relationship/ Interest: It was learned

that French Intelligence Service was attempting

to bribe KELLY and make him.a double agent and :
Kelly -appeared to be interested in the French offers.
Accordingly, a plan was made to have KELLY believe
that he was going to be assassinated and for protec-
tion he was placed in custody of the Greek police

who then put him in prison. KELLY was held in the
prison for six months until the Greek authorities
decided that KELLY was was a nuisance and they told
our people to take him back. - He was then flown to
Panama where; through arrangement, he was placed in

a U. S. military hospital as a psychopathic patient.
According to the 25 January 1952 memorandum, KELLY
had been in the hospital for several months and the
hospital authorities want him out since he is causing
problems. He is not a psychopathic personality.
Because of his confinement in a Greek prison and his ~
stay in a military hospital, KELLY became very hostile
toward the United States and our intelligence opera-

tions in particular.

OPC was considering an "ARTICHOKE" “approach to KELLY
to see if it would be possible to reorient KELLY
favorably toward us. However, OPC advised on

2 February 1952 that some opposition had arisen in
the top level of OPC to the handling of the KELLY
case in the manner that had been proposed. - Since
this opposition had arisen, nothing would be done
to the KELLY case.

Period of Relationship: No dates supplied

Indications of Drug Experimentation: None found
Co-optee Interest: Not indicated

‘TW. O£fice of Security File Summary - DIMITROV, Dimitre
Adamov (lyle 0. aed (QKSTAIR) (SHAN/BGCONVOY)
#46165 :

1. Short Summary of Agency Interest/Use:

The file was opened in October 1950, when DIMITROV
was of operational interest to the Agency while

employed for Radio Athens in Greece. Previously,
DIMITROV had fled from Bulgaria in July 1947. As
of October 1951, DIMITROV was in a hospital in
South America, apparently under Agency auspices.

In 1956 DIMITROV was brought to the United States,
‘apparently after returning to Athens from South
America, and the Agency made no further operational™ .
use of DIMITROV. In June 1960 DIMITROV [under case
#33259--Dimiter DIMITROFF ("Diko")]. had contact -
with the Contact Division outlining his background,
: : “Claiming financial difficulties, and requesting the
tec} Agency back his plans for covert ‘activity ‘against

' ce Bulgaria. The. Agency apparently took no action in

‘this regard. During this contact DIMITROV claimed
that circa 1951 he was held ina Eocpiteu cous in.
‘Panama City.

of Mr. Bannernan for the purpose of a conference with one oe .

. and as a "protaction”, he was placed in custody of the Greek Police

who threw Kefly into a Greek prison. Kelly was held in ths Grsek pri-

“json for six months until the Gresk authorities decided that Kelly was .
. & nuisance and they told our people to take him back. Since our

people were unable to dispose of Kelly in Greece, thay flew hin to _
Panama where, through arrangement, he was placed in a U.S. Military
Hospital as a psychopathic patient. Kelly new has been in the U.S.
military hospital for several months and the hospital authorities now

\ want to get him out since he is causing considerable trouble, bothering

: a patients, etc. Kelly is not a psychopathic personality.

* Gpurtehet® explained that they can dispose of Kelly by: the simple ws
process of sending him to a friend of his in Caracas, Venezuela, and

’ as far as they are concerned, that type of disposal is perfectly o.k.

However, bacause of his confinement in a Greek prison and his stay in
a military hospital, Kelly has become very hostile toward the United
States and our intelligence operations in particular. Hence, O7C is

-considsring an "Artichokes" approach to Kelly to see if it would ba

possible to re-orient Kelly favorably toward us. This operation, which
will necessarily involvs the use of drags is being considered by OPC
with a possibility that Dr. Ecks and Mike Gladych will carry out the
operation presumably at the military hospital in Panama. Also in-
volved in this would be a Bulgarian interpreter who is a consultant

‘to this Agency since neither Ecks nor Gladych speak Bulgarian. |

Mr. Bannerman pointed out toGrichat® that this type of ceed
could only be carried out with the authorization of Security and that,
“under no circumstances whatsoever, could anyons but an authorized M.D.
administer drags to any subject of this Agency of any type. Banzarzan
pointed out that there was a strong possibility that the military
