1, Following are the results of the debriefing of AMMPAUNA-14 in
the JMWAVE area from 22 November to 2 December 1963.

2. AHMPFAUNA-14 did not leave her apartment all day Sunday, 6 Oct.
@a Honday, 7 October, she went to work as usual, When she arrived, she
found a letter waiting for her which had been forwarded to her office
froa her accommodation address; it was in AMPAUNA-1's handwriting and
contained nothing of any interest, so she: was sure there was a secret
writing message on it.

3, At 1255 hours two men arrived at the office, one about 45 years
old and short, who from his appearance might have been a bus driver,
and the other a very young dark-skinned man. They waiked into the
office vestibule and told the guard that they wanted to see AMFAUNA-14, |
The guard came into the office to give AMFAUNA-14 the message, and the
two men followed right behind. They told AMFAUNA-14 that she had to
come with them to identify an arrested person, AMFAUNA-14 said that
sho would have to ask her supervisor for permission to leave, because
it was not yet closing time. She turned to go back into the office,
and the two men followed her in, The supervisor told her that it
would be all right for her to go, but said that she should check in by
phone if there were any difficulty. AMFAUNA+14's father and uncle,
both of whom work in the same office, asked whether they could come
with her, The men said no, because she would be coming right back;
they said they were taking her to "G-2" headquarters in La Vibora.

“trom AMPAUNA-1 by leaving, 4 k of a fellow employee
together with some potatoes and a carrot for.cover, but the men would
“not let her. She did, however, nage to destroy a page from her note-

book containing telephone numbers.

5. At the DSE headquarters in Villa Maristas, AMFAUNA-14 was
turned over to a militiawoman who had her strip and performed a body
rs gearoh on her, She was fingerprinted and pnotographed and her biogyaph
data were taken down, after which she waa locked in a cell which had
an adjoining private bath. Nothing else of importance happened for
the rest of the day.

6. During her four-day detention period, AMFAUNA- 14 4 was handled

“hyde gerae Francisco ABAD: AMTAUNA-14 believes that this is hie

al name, yoduce himself, but she saw the name on her
release sapere which | he signed, He was born about 1918 and is about
58*4" tall, weighs about 160 pounds, and haz a fat build, aquiline nose,
greenish eyes, dark skin, grey-brown wavy hair, rough laborer's hands,
and two teeth missing from the lower juw. He smokes both cigars and
cigarettes, his manner was soft and kindly, and AMFAUNA-14 believes
he is probably poorly educated. He is married, but AMFAUNA-14 did not
arn whether he has children or what his address is. He wears civiliai
“plothes and drives a black 1956 Pontiac with a grey roof. Discussing
e AMCOG household, AMFAUNA-14 was told by Pedro
brother_of Justo CARRILLO) that Pedro knows ABAD.
KBAD is part Jewish and\an old Communist who worked

alf of Fidel 7 uring the Batista

mariod. Pedro CARRILLO thinke that ABAD may now have some regrets
about the course he has taken,

(>) "Carlos" aka "Samuel": AMFAUNA-14 does not know hie true
name, He was born abou or perhaps a little earlier, He is re
about 5'6" tall, weighs about 150 pounds, and has a muscular build, ~
Grooping eyelids, light olive skin, wavy chestnut hair with a widows
peak. He is a nervous pacer, and walks with his head bent forward and
tilted slightly to one side. An expression which he frequently used
was "0.K." pronounced "OKAH" with the accent on the first syllable.

He told AMFAUNA-14 that he had been a student in the Commercial School
of Havana, that he had worked clandestinely under the Batista regime,
had been arrested by Col, Esteban VENTURA Novo, had been released due
to the influence of his father, and had gotten. out.of the country with
the aid of the Méxican Ambas r to Cuba, coming then to the United
States. He drives a 1959 black and white Chevrolet Corvair, wears
civilian cloth and carries a pistol, sometimes a .45 and sometimes
a .38, AMFAUNA-14 believes him to be a 100% Communist, She thinks he
may have been somewhat better trained than Francisco ABAD and may have
been somewhat superior in rank, although this was never clearly evident;
There ceemed to be a little professional jealousy between the two men.
If she told one man something which she had been unable to remember
for the other, the second would show signs of jealousy or resentment.
"Carlos" subsequently told AMPAUNA-14 to phone 61-4319 and ask for
“Samuel” when she wanted to reach him. She phoned him at this number
about ten times in all. The phone was alwaye answered by the same
woman, except for, once when a boy answered and then led for his
mcther to come and take the Phone, AMFAUNA-14 would ask for "Samuel"
aud the woman would invariably reply that he was not there, AMVAUNA-
14 would then ask the woman to take a message for him to please call
“Dolores, The woman would always reply “Yes, Comrade." Discussing
this person later within the AMCOG household, AMFAUNA-14 was told by

A3VAUHA-14's -conncction with NEGRET had been, AMFAUNA-14 said that
MBGRET had been in her house once, and once in her mother

18, At this point ‘in the interrogation, ABAD was called away and
AMPAUNA~14 was returned to her cell, Two hours later the interrogation
was rosuned, %

13. ABAD picked up where he had left off, and asked AMFAUNA-14
what connection she had had with Angel BRINGAS. AMFAUNA~-14 said that
she had known BRINGAS no better than ahe had known NEGRET. ABAD said
that she was lying and urged tha: cooperate. AMFAUNA-14 promised
that she would coopera’ ABAD said that NEGRET had told the DSE that
AMPAUWA-14 had had sexual relations with BRINGAS, and AMFAUKA-14 denied
the allegation.

ret d to her colt. When she returned to the interrogation room,
she faw that ABAD had an envelope containing what she recognized to be
papers taken from her apartment, including airline passenger manifests,
ciphering material, instructions for using the deciphering material,
and insurance policies and personal papers belonging to AMFAUNA-1.

‘situation, °

15. - ABAD began by telling her that she was in a very serious 8
situation, because he knew that she had had very close connections

with a agent, ABAD asked whether AMFAUNA-1 was identical with
Rulte,* AMPAUNA-14 gaid that AMFAUNA-1 had been known as "Julio,"

ABAD then wanted to know whether NEGRET had been working with "Julio."

ed the information that "Julio’
and that AMFAUNA-14 had been
the cutout between then, uf "Julio's" existance, ABAD
wanted to know. ANFAUNA-14 said that hera2d not 4 that she had brought
NMBGRET mail and money which she had gotten from "Julio," and had picked
wail up from him and delive it to "Julio," but that NEGRET had

never known "Julio's" identity. i

16, ‘The truth about AMFAUNA-14's relations with NEGRET and BRINGAS
according to her statements to her KUBARK case officer in November 1963
in the JMWAVE aroa, is as follows:

(a) In about mid-1962, AMCOG-2 asked AMFAUNA-14 to serve as
cutout ‘between herself and an unidentifi d agent, and ANFAUNA-14
agreed. AMFAUNA-14 was driven to the meeting site, which was on the
sidewa. ke in front of a textile factory near Calle 100 in Marianao, by
"s chauffour, a Spa d named "Segundo," This agent introduced
himself to AMFAUNA-14 on i as. "Bl *NEGRO", and AMFAUNA-14 described .
herself to him as an employee of an unidentified embassy. For contact
purposes, "El Negro" gave her the telephone number 29-4900 or 20-4900,

(b) Later, when AMFAUNA-14 began to trust "El Negro" more,
ehe gave him the telephone number of her mother, She learned that
*RT Ragrofa" true nama war tate Rraulio VILLAR Negret, and that he
‘Adved in a omall room in the rear of the textile factory, The telephon
fiumber which he had given her was always answered by a woman whose
fame whe learned to be "Maximina," :
i (c) VILLAR Negret was born about 1928, and was about 5'11"
tall with broad shoulders and.a strong build. He had black wavy hair,
brown eycs, an olive skin, ‘and a face marked by acne. AMFAUNA-14 =~
. Mever learned anything about his family directly from him, but DSE
efficers told her that he was married with one child,
i

(4) VILLAR Negret was

en action component of this organization, but more recently had de-

pvoted himself to intelligence collection. AMFAUNA-14 brought hb:

(f) According to what the DSE officers told her, "El Negro"

a (g) On 12 or 13 October 1963, af AMFAUNA-14 had been re-
leased, she was telephoned at her place of loyment ‘by Angel BRINGAS
who told her guardedly that "Bl Negro" had been arrested and said that
he would like to send a female cousin of his to talk to AMFAUNA-14. A
meeting was arranged in the home of ANFAUNA-14's mother, The female
cousin, whose name was "Gladys", told AMYAUNA-14 that BRINGAS had gone
into niaing and wondered whether "the family with which she worked"
the AMCOGS) could help him get into asylum, AMFAUNA-14 said that she
doubted this, "Gladys" told AMFAUNA-14 that, in case it were possible
to do anything for BRINGAS, she should tclephone "Gladys" with an
dmnocent message. It was understood that a meeting would take place at
1800 hours on the same day of the telephone call at the Ten Cent Store
S9rd between 10th and 12th in Vedado.  AMFAUNA-14 does not remember
Gladys' telephone number which was left with her mother.

(bh) In spite of what AMFAUNA-14 told the DSE, AMFAUNA-1 had
bad nothing to do with NEGRET. AMFAUNA-14 had told this story to pro-
tect ANCOG-2. NEGRET had known that AMCOG-2 was involved, and had once
had a meeting with her in her home, Nevertheless, AMFAUNA-14 briefed
ANCOG-2 on the cover story which she had told the DSE and told her that,
4m case ashe were ever arrested and questioned, she should admit having
talked to NEGRET in her home, but deny having been involved in the
communications channel or knowing anything about it,

17, ABAD appeared to be particularly interested in how NEGRET and

"Julio" obtained their funds, and kept returning to thie subject during
the interrogation. :

16, ABAD then addressed himself to the contents of the envelope
and a guitcase found in AMFAUNA-14's apartment, He commented that all
these things appeared to belong to AMFAUNA-1 and his son, and asked how
they happened to be there, AMFAUNA-14 replied that AMFAUNA-1 and his”
gon, together with AMFAUNA-3, had been hiding for a few days in her
apartment because their usual hiding place had become unavailable.

19. ABAD wanted to know how and when AMFAUNA-14 had first niet
AMPAUHA-1, AMFAUNA-14 replied that she had met AMFAUNA-1 in about —
Vebruary 1062, that AMFAUNA-1 had regularly parked his car in a lot near
her office and that they had s each other on the street frequently,
that AMFAUNA-1: hed finally spo! to her, and that a friendship had:~
doveloped which finally turned into a love affair. (Comment: This was
& lie told to conceal the fact that it had been AMCUTLER-2 who had in-
troduced ther.) She said that AMFAUNA-1 had been her lover until about.
July 1962 when she broke up with him because he was too busy with
clandestine work to pay the proper amount of attention to her.

20, ABAD asked what part AMFAUNA-14 had played in AMFAUNA-1's
Clandestine activitt AMPAUNA-14 replied that AMFAUNA-1..would some-
tises telephone her © at night to invite her to go out for a ride,
and she would then find that AMFAUNA-1 was going out to have agent
gootings and wanted her along for cover. ABAD asked whom AMFAUNA-1 had
been meeting. AMPAUNA-14 mentioned. a person known as "Gustavo" and
SSS" sta use emevious orion,



gave the physical description of AMFAUNA-24, whom she knew to be sa: !
out of Cuba. (She never knew AMFAUNA-24's true name.) She also mentioned
Manolo *VILLANANAN, the true name of AMFAUNA-13 (whom she: had. known
only as ANFAUNA-1's business partner but when she thought she ‘could
safely mention now that he was out of Cuba,) For good measure she added
@ notional name and physical description. :

91. Referring back to AMFAUNA-1'a automobile, ABAD asked what
kind of a car he had driven, AMFAUNA-14 replied that it was a gray
Chevrolet Impa She repeated that AMFAUNA-1 had formerly parked it

jad not n it recently. ABAD
did not know, He
asked what the license number on th , and said she did not
aeeeinont never asked anything about the third car which AMFAUNA-1 had
obta: .

« ABAD commented that the DSE had observed AMFAUNA-1 in his
gutomobile in the Havana dock area on 1 January 1963, having a meeting
with another person, (AMFAUNA-14 recalls that this other person was
AMPAUNA-24, and that he and AMFUANA-1 had rendezvoused in the dock area
after an attempt to pick up AMFAUNA-1's radio.

23, With reference to the KUBARK agent known as "Julio", whom
they bad recently identified with AKFAUNA-1, ABAD said that he knew
that "Julio" had left Cuba in October 1962 and believed that he had
gone to Burope, but he said he did not know whether "Julio" had gone
clandestinely or legally.

24, AMPAUNA-14 was asked about AMFAUNA-1's subsources in other
provinces, but she suid she knew nothing about them. ABAD said he was
gure that ANPAUWA-1 had a gond aource on the Tala of Pinas. Whore war
name might be "Raul". ABAD also mentioned the name of a person who had
been shot about two weeks previously and who he believed had been work-
ing ca AMPAUNA-1. (AMFAUNA-14 does not remember the name of this
person, :

25. ABAD asked if AMFAUNA-1's son had helped him in this clandes~:
tine work. ANFAUNA-14 replied that the son had been with AMFAUNA-1
freqvently, but that she thought it was only because he was helping
AMPAUNZ-1 with hie business and that the son probably had had nothing
to do with clandestine work. . -

26, ABAD again turned to the envelope of papers found in AMFAUNA~14{a
t, and maid he could see she was not cooperating with him, She
was not volunteering information, he said, but iting to be asked
questions, ABAD said he was sure that there was much that AMFAUNA-14
could tell him spontaneously, and he intimated that there might be a-
chance for her to rehabilitate herself.

27, ABAD asked her where the passenger lista came from. AMFAUNA-14
weplied that they had been left in her apartment by AMFAUNA-1, who
dntended to instruct her later by SW what to do with them. She said
that AMPAUKA~1 had trained her in this system, and had left ber his
materials, co that he could use her as a stop-gap communications link
while he was trying to reorganize his net. Site a8 ACA

26. ABAD told her that this was plainly Ue,

‘the lists were dated later than AMFAUNA-1's departure date. He said he

they had been brought to AMFAUNA-14's apartment by,AMCUTLER-2,
‘gno had been observed coming there on 5 October with Loli RREOSO,
(fais was true, according to AMFAUNA-14. AMCUTLER-2 and Lolin CORREOSO
hed brought the pasgenger manifests to AMFAUNA-14's house at about 1630
or 1700 hours on 5 October, and had stayed about fifteen minutes. AT
1400 hours that same day, AMFAUNA-14 had had a meeting with AMPAUNA-39,
the first in two weeks, initiated by AMFAUNA-39 by means of a telephone
cali to AMPAUNA-1's mother who was serving as cutout between then.
ANPAINA-39 had called the meeting to ask whether she had recei:
instructions from AMFAUNA-1 as to how to,act in e of an in

been under intensive surveillance that day; either AMCUTLER-2 had been
under surveillance on 5 October, or she herself had been under some. kind
of periodic spot check. )

39. ABAD asked AMFAUNA-14 how had become acquainted with
ANCUTLER-3, and ANFAUNA-14 repjied that she had met AMCUTLER-2 through
AMPAUNA-15, the wife of a cousin of AWFAUNA~-14 who is a prisoner on the
Isle of Pines,

ABAD then asked AMFAUNA-14 where her SW materials were, which
surprised AMFAUNA-14 because she had thought they had m found during
her house rch and were part of the incriminating envelope which ABAD
was holding. AMFAUNA-14 told ABAD where to look for the materials, and
he sent somebody to get then.

‘ 931. ABAD wanted to know how AMFAUNA-i and AMFAUNA-3 had gotten out
of Cuba. AMFAUNA-14 gaid she did not know. She said she understood they|
wore to get their instruction on the street once they had left her apart-|
ment.

$2. ABAD abruptly asked AMFAUNA-14 whether she knew anybody in
uyano, AMPAUNA-14 said she did not. ABAD then produced a photograph
of AMPAUNA-14 together with AMFAUNA-1 and 29/and told her that she
had boon in 2's home in Luyano with AMFAUNA-1 on Saturday, 7 Septe!
He asked AMFAUNA<14!whethorlAM@BE32 were employed in an embassy, AMFAUN,
14 said she did not know but that’she thought so. She said she knew

to be a personal friend of AMFAUNA-1, and thought that he might

occasionally have helped AMFAUNA-1 with his mail. (It was true that
MIPAUWA-14 had gone to ‘s house on 7 September with AMFAUNA-1.

the A¥COG house, and AMFAUNA-14 said that she had. Throughout the

asked whether AMFAUNA-14 had been a good friend of AMFAUNA-3, and she

AMPAUNA~3 speak about the Escambray insurgents. AMFAUNA-14 d at v }
she had not. ABAD asked whether AMFAUNA-3 had had contacts with any

bassy people, for example the Spanish Embavsy. AMFAUNA-14 said that

she did not know of any such contacts.

37. "How abcut ANCUTLER-2?" askec ABAD. "We know that she spends
® lot of time there,” AMFAUNA-]4 said she did not know,

— ABAD asked AMFAUNA-14 if she were a revolutionary, AMFAUNA-14
said that ehe not, but that neither was the against the revolution,
She said that had joined the militia early in the revolution, but
had so0oB dropped out because there were some things about the revolution
which @ did not understand. For instance, she could not underetand
why thore should be so many shortages and rationing, whereas before the
revolution there had been plenty. ABAD exp)sined that the shortages wer
the result of the imperialist blockade of Cuba, AMFAUNA-14 seid that
she could understand this, but that it did not explain why there should
be a shortage of coffee when Cuba grew its own, ABAD said that coffee
was in short supply because Cuba was sending coffee to the Soviet Union
in gratitude for Soviet assistance in overcoming shortages caused by the
imporialist blockade, AMFAUNA-14 replied that this was very logical
now that it had been explained to her, and said she wondered why the
revolutionary government did not publicly say so in order to put an end
to public grumbling on the subject. Ei

38, Barly in the morning of 9 October, ABAD produced the letter ™
which AMPAUNA-14 received from AMFAUNA-1 on 7 October and held up the
Jetter to the light, peta tr it carefully for. traces of SW, AMFAUNA-

she was unable to get a good look at. All were very surprised and
disappointed when né secret writing appeared. They kept asking her if
were sure she was doing it right, and began intimating that she was
d ceiving them. (Station Comment: It is indeed surprising that no
secret writing appeared, because this letter was almost undoubtedly the-
one containing SW message no, 1 to AMFAUNA-14.) ig

40, ASMPAUNA-14 also explained the use of _ carbons, The only
gocommodation addreas she gave away was AMF, \VE area post
office box, She deliberately protected the ddress (the
home of AMPAN-2), not knowing whether this re or a fictitious
person, M2

41, "Carl ind ABAD now invited AMFAUNA-14 to work with them. She
Feplied that she might be willing to do so, but first wanted to know
what work would be expected of her, For instance, she said, she would
not inform on people in her office. They told her that this would not
be askedof her, because that sort of work is done by the Defense
Committees. Her work, they said, would be much more important, namely
waintaining a link between themselves and KUBARK. She said that would
be all right, but she was afraid that it would not last long because
KUBARK would probably put her on ice as soon as they learned that she
had been arrested. They told her not to worry about that, .

42, -“Carlos" and ABAD suggested to her that AMFAUNA-1 had briefed
her to agree to cooperate with them, She denied this, claiming that she
had not really wanted to work with AMFAUNA-1 at all, but had merely let
herself be imposed on for old times sake. They asked whether they
could trust her, She said she thought so, and asked whether she could
trust them to ksep their promises, They assured her that she could,
and said ehe would be released the following day.

43. In the morning of 10 October, after: being to1d that she was to
be released, AMPAUNA-14 was moved to a smaller cell without a bath. She
sont for ABAD and complained that he-had double-crossed her. He told



14-00000

her that he was going to keep his word and release her, but that her
original cell was needed for some new prisoners who were expected. He
said that the DSE had received advance word that .a boatload of refugees
were going to try to leave Cuba that night. Many of them were women,
and one of there was pregnant, so he wantec the larger cell with bath

drinks when she wanted them, and he seemed to be

jed whenever she wert, AKI'AUNA-14 believes that it hag
been the DSE's intention from the very beginning to recruit her, be-
cause she doubts that all DSE prisoners are treated as well.

45, The first SW message which AMFAUNA-14 wrote while under DSE
control was dated 10 October, the day of her release, The DSE officers
asked her what her control signal. was, and she replied that it was a
rubrio, but also included her true control signal, She deliberately
numbered her first controlled SW message no. 2, to conceal the fact
that she had already written several messages containing intelligence
reports,

: 46. In all she wrote three SW messages under control. She was
obliged to write each one in duplicate, one ‘of which was mailed and the
other given to the DSE for study.. One day "Carlos" came to her very
angrily, said he doubted that her carbons were anything more than

hing about it, but that if by chance he had
tried to develop the letters she had written with the pills he had
taken:.from her, it would not work. This surprised "Carlos," and
-AMFAUNA-14 explained that there were two different SW systems, one for .
outgoing mail and the other for incoming. "Carlos" then asked her if |
there were any significance to the size of envelope used, or to the way:
the letter paper was folded, AMFAUNA-14 said she did not think so,
AMFAUNA-14 feels that "Carlos" and ABAD never completely believed that
ehe had an SW system, because none of the letters which she received
disclosed SW when developed, and none of the letters which she wrote
showed any traces of SW when held up to glancing light.

*. 47, "Carlos" was the DSE officer who maintained contact with
AMPAUNA-14 after her release. For two or three weeks he saw her every
day at her apartment, sometimes for only twanty minutes, and sometimes
gtaying for several hours, frequently late at night. Occasionally he
called her at her office, Finally AMFAUNA-14 told him that she had to
get up early in the morning to go to work, and asked him to visit her
early in the evening, which he agreed to do. At. the time of the in-
tercepted AMGLOSSY landing in Pinar del Rio, "Carlos" did not visit
“AMPAUNA-14 for five days, When he finally returned, he was dirty,
gweaty and tired, He dictated an SW letter he wanted AMFAUNA-14 to
send to KUBARE, and while she was writing it he fell asleep.

“68, AMFAUNA-14 had to prepare written reports for him, which she

:“pigned. with the pseudonym "Dolores," He told her never to call him at

DOB fheadquartere, because he was never there, Once he brought her a
book on Marxism to read, and promised to take her someday to visit a
collective farm in Pinar del Rio Province.

49. Despite his occasional efforts to get her to pick up the thread:
of the AMFAUNA net, AMPAUNA-14 believes that the primary target she was
intended to work against. was the AMCOG household. From remarks made by
both ABAD and "Carlos", she deduced that they already had an informer
in the house, but that they were not satisfied with his production,
Toward the end of her period of DSE -controlled activi: phe felt that
the D8E was becoming relatively less interested in AM 1 and his ~
‘net, and more in the ANCOG household. , ce

(a) Before leaving Cuba, AMPAUNA-1 had asked AMCUTLER-2 to

might come addressed to "Betty." One day. a colored woman called at
MICUTLER-2'5 coffee shop on Calle San Rafael with a package addressed

AMFAUNA-14 asked her not to do it so soon after her visit, but AMCUTLER-

that AMCUTLER-2 had spoken of taking a holiday at Varadero,

November, At this meeting he asked her to try to make contact with
AMFAUNA-3's brother who he said had. been transferred to a hospital in
Las Villas, AMFAUNA-14 said she would try, but thought it would be-
@ifficult. This was the last time she saw "Carlos," He telephoned her
again on 16 November t ask what was new, and this was their last
telephone contact.

72, When AMFAUNA-14 arrived at AMCOG-3's house at about 2000: hours
on 15 November 1963 tor the regular Friday night supper, he took her
aside and said he wanted to speak to her privately later. At about
2330 hours she went to his room. There he told her that he had received
orders that she was to leave Cuba the following week. He said that
precise instructions were to come on 16 and 17 November, so he made a
lunch date with her for Sunday noon at his house.

73,  AMFAUNA-14 was frightened by this. She did not sleep well
Priday or Saturday nights, and spent Saturday in her home.

74, Sunday afternoon in AMCOG-3's house, AMCOG-3 told her that she
was to leave the following day. She said that she did not want to,
AMCOG-3 responded that this was an order. He said that the DSE would
probably arrest her again soon, and for her own safety and that of other:
she must leave. He added that there were others who were to leave too,
whose departure had been made conditional upon her own,

75. AMFAUNA-14 asked whether AMCUTLER-2 were one of these other
people who were to leave too, and AMCOG-3 replied that she was. AMFAUNA.
14 told him that she thought AMCUTLER-2 would not agree to leave. AMC
said that he thought she would because the orders had been couched in
very strong terns, : :

76. He then showed her the instructions, both for herself and for

wR-2. He had her type her instructions on a piece of paper, and
then memorize them. 7

77, Then AMCOG-3 gave AMFAUNA-14 the following verbal. messages ‘to
deliver when she reached JMWAVE:

(a) A colonel fnu LANDEIRA, a tank expert who had been. in the
Cuban Army under GRAU and PRIO, is a prisoner on a farm in Havana Prog
vince He is given three days off per week to go home. His wife know!
in advance when he will be coming out, AMCOG-3 does not know the wife;
but has indirect contact to her, AMCOG-3 says the man is horest and
intelligent and a real soldier, and if we want him out AMCOG-3 can
arrange it.

b) As of about 1800 hours on 17 November, 4 young

had been moved to new hiding place, AMCOG-3 was considering trying H
to help the young man into asylum in the Uruguayan Embassy through a ie
certain ("Pepin") whose identity is not known to AMFAUNA-14 but; who she
thinks ie pn UFuguayan attache,
(c) AMCOG-3 is out of one-time pada and needs a resupply,
(4) It te very possible that AMCUd-3 may be able to obtain _ i

and forward a copy of AMFAUNA- 14 DSE dossier.

78. On Monday morning, 18 November, AMFAUNA-14 dressed as she had
been instructed, and stuffed a pair of slacks and sneakers into the
etraw handbag which she had been told to carry. At 1300 hours she left
her office id proceeded on foot to the co;‘ner of Atares and Arango in
Reparto Luyano, arriving there at 1400 hours. Here she exceeded her
instructions, waiting for AMCUTLER-2 not five minutes but fifteen, She
then walked very slowly toward Calzada Luyano, hoping that AMCUTLER-2
might overtake her, This consumed another ten minutes, and by the time ‘
she reached the Calzada Luyano it was too late for. her to walk the re-
mainder of the distance, so she took a taxi, ‘

79, AMFAUNA-14 discharged the taxi one block before theParque de
la Virgen del Camino and walked the rest of the way. She went to the
sbrine where she prayed for a few minutes, and then sat on a bench
from which she could see the whole park. ‘

80. At 1510 hours a 1954 Buick taxi arrived at the park, The
driver stayed in the car, and two men - a colored man and a fair-haired
man - got out and walked around for about ten minutes, Finally they
approached her and gave the challenge, to which she gave the correct
response, One of the men then said simply "Follow me", They took her
back to the taxi and put her in the back seat with one of the men, the aes
other two riding in front. 7

81, . They headed out of the city. When the reached the Carretera
de Varadero, one of the men asked her politely if she would mind keepin,
ber eyes directed down toward the floor and not look out the window.
Bhe rode this way for about two hours. By then it was dark, and she wa
told she could look up again, She took advantage of the opportunity to
change into her slacks and sneakers.

823, Finally the car stopped, and she and her two escorts got out. a
They walked a long time. At one point, whistle signals were exchanged af
with 3 one in the darkness, and two other men appeared, one of whom oa
wos AM@EE}2. AMFAUNA-14 and AMWEE}2 greeted each other politely, but
pretendeddnot to know each other. 9

83, They did a lot more walking and joined up with another man, wh
turned out to be the radio man. He had a lot of equipment with him,
and AMFAUNA-14 and “et helped to carry it.

84. They now reached the mangrove and began to walk through water,
At o} point their guide became briefly lost, but found his way again
almost::immediately. When they came to the open water, one of the guide:
went forward and gignalled, The boat came in in response to the signal
AMPAUNA-14 p| 2, and the radio man walked out into knee-deep water
and climbed into the boat, which already had a crew of two.

85. The boat proceeded out to an unidentified key, The crew con-
cealed it in the mangrove, cleverly lacing and tying branches together
over it to form a camouflage cover, There they went to sleep.

86, The following day, 19 November, was spent at this spot. A
radio message was received during the day, At night the boat put -out
for Cayo Kegano, The waves were enormous, and. AMFAUNA-14 was terribly
seasick. The boat remained at the rendezvous point until 1045 hours, <"
with ANMPAUNA-14 pleading for the crew to return to land, saying she
would rather be shot than remain so seasick. Finally the crew did put
back, saying that the ship probably would not come because thé Bea, was

she was hauled out by ‘the armpits on 21 November, AMFAUNA-14 never left]

@1. AMFAUNA~14 says that the AMHICK team performed very well, The
pickup in the park was done excellently, The slight delay while they
looked her over, she says, was due to the fact that the men had ex-
pected another woman to be with her, and they were waiting a few minute
in case the other woman should show up. The AMHICK. team said that the
had also boen briefed that she would be wearing her hair in a bun,

She had not been briefed accordingly, and she was wearing her hair
down her back in & pony tail, This discrepancy did not cause any con-
fusion, because every other item of the visual recognition signals 4

92. AMFAUNA-14 was impressed by the precise timing of the team's
movements, by the fact that everybody was whsre he was supposed to be
at the time indicated. She expressed admiration for their seamanship,
and their ability to pick out one spot of mangrove from another in
the pitch darknese,

93. She says that, during these trying days, the team members were
always in calm control of the situation, and never failing in their
courtesy to her,

94, Regarding AMCUTLER~2, AMFAUNA-14 is sure that the exfiltration
instructions reached her, They were taken, she said, by Lolita FORMOS
who had been standing by for them from Friday to Sunday. What Lolita
did with them, AMFAUNA-14 does not know. She knows that we had
suggested that Lolita take them to AMFAUNA-1's nother, but she also
knows that we had indicated to ANCOG-3 that AMFAUNA-1's mother might
be under surveillance, so she thinks Lolita might have taken them
directly to AMCUTLER-2. In any case, she knows that messages sent
proviously by AMCOG-3 to AMCUTLER-2 reached the latter, and she sees
no reason to assume. that these instructions did not.

:

95,. It does not surprise AMFAUNA-14 that AMCUTLER-2 did not follow
he. orders, .ANMCUTLER-2, she says, plays her own game with little: con-
ration for others, Between the time that AMFAUNA-1 left Cuba on
September, and the time that AMFAUNA-14 was arrested on 7 October,
AMCUTLER-2 had visited AMFAUNA-14's apartment twice. On both occasiéng,

AMPAUNA-14 had asked her to remove the suitcase that AMFAUNA-1 had left
behind, but on both occasions AMCUTLER-2 had found some excuse not to
do so. When AMFAUNA-14 visited AMCUTLER-2 in her home in, Guanabacos
on 3 November for the purpose of coordinating their cover stories,
AMCUTLER-2 did not seem very interested in coordinating stories or
anything ie, AMFAUNA-14 believes that AMCUTLER-2 may be working for

AMCUTLER-1 and AMCUTLER-2. oe ee - \

Besides the dangers of the trip, she would be leaving her mother and

Sign a confersion implicating them. While she appears to be trying not
to be overly critical of AMCUTLFR-2, she has commented that AMCUTLER-2
knows far more members of the AMFAUNA net than she herself does, 80
that the reasons requiring the exfiltration of AMFAUNA-14 should be
even more compelling for AMCUTLER-2.
