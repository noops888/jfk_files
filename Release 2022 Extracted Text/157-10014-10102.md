Short_Chronology*

Counterespionage work as FBI agent
Joined CIA as head of Soviet Intelligence Branch

Deputy Assistant Director, Office of Special Operations
(which became DDP)

Chief of Station, Berlin (Berlin Tunnel operation)

Became Chief of Foreign Intelligence staff Division D
(FI/D) which handles communications intelligence and
sensitive methods of obtaining it (e.g., surreptitious
entries)

BISSELL (DDP) asks HARVEY to establish an EXECUTIVE
ACTION capability under project ZRRIFLE. Harvey claims
Bissell said he had been "twice urged by the White
House" to establish such a capability. Bissell and
Edwards separately brief Harvey on the Phase I assassina-
tion plot run by Sheffield EDWARDS and James O'CONNELL
(Office of Security) which involved criminal syndicate
connections.

{In early February Edwards had the POISON PILLS tested;
in late February~early March, the pills were sent into
Cuba by O'Connell through Roselli. ]

HARVEY uses agent QJWIN (recruited earlier by ARNOLD
SILVER for use in an assassination operation against
LUMUMBA) as the principle asset for ZRRIFLE.

According to Dr. GUNN (Office of Medical Services),
HARVEY asked about the pills he tested. Gunn briefed
Harvey, who told him to brief SIDNEY GOTTLIEB about
techniques but not targets.

Bay of Pigs invasion fails; JFK appoints Taylor
Committee. EDWARDS halts or suspends PHASE I.

* Most of the reference to Cuba or Executive Action came from the 1967

IG Report.

TOP’ SECRET

Beginning of PHASE II: BISSELL instructs HARVEY to
apply the ZRRIFLE assassination capability to Castro.
Harvey takes over the criminal syndicate contacts
developed in Phase I, HARVEY is told by HELMS that he
is to take over the CIA Cuba task force.

MC CONE-replaces Allen Dulles as DCI

EDWARDS meets with FBI to ask them not to prosecute
the Rowan wiretap case because of CIA concern

HELMS (DDP nominee) authorizes HARVEY to handle
ZRRIFLE project with unvouchered funds.

HARVEY, ROSELLI, O'CONNELL, and perhaps MAHEU meet
in New York to plan Phase II. (Harvey disputes
O'Connell's recollection that Maheu was there and
knowledgeable of Phase II.) Both Edwards and Harvey
check with HELMS before the meeting is arranged.
Harvey begins regular reporting to Helms on Phase II.

Harvey says he took over an "ongoing operation" from
O'Connell.

HARVEY, ROSELLI, and O'CONNELL meet in Miami. At
this point Roselli is using Tony VARONA and "MACEO"
as contacts with Cuba rather than Trafficante.

Pills are delivered to Harvey in Washington.

HARVEY passes the pills to ROSELLI in Florida.
Roselli was to give the pills to Varona, who had an
asset in Cuba with access to Castro's restaurant.

HARVEY, with help of Ted SHACKLEY (Chief of JMWAVE
station in Miami), loaded arms and equipment in a
U-Haul truck which was left in a parking lot for
Roselli, who delivered it to a Cuban contact.

HARVEY is told by EDWARDS that the "tacit approval"
of the DCI should be obtained if Roselli was to be
used any further. Harvey told Edwards that Roselli
would not be used any more. (According to Edwards'
memorandum of 5/14/75.)

Intense contact between HARVEY and ROSELLI. Roselli
reports that pills are in Cuba at the restaurant
frequented by Castro awaiting the opportunity to use
then.

EDWARDS and HOUSTON brief ATTORNEY GENERAL ROBERT F.
KENNEDY on PHASE I of the assassination operation.

Edwards tells HARVEY of the briefing of RFK. Harvey
says that he briefed HELMS about this and advised
against briefing McCone (DCI) or Carter (DDCI); Helms
agreed.

DONOVAN negotiates for return of Bay of Pigs prisoners.

ROSELLI tells HARVEY that VARONA has sent three men to
Cuba to recruit others for the pill plot.

Special Group (Augmented) meets on OPERATION MONGOOSE.
HARVEY said that McNAMARA raised the subject of
assassinations at this meeting.

General LANSDALE'S memorandum assigns to HARVEY the
drafting of an outline of intelligence, political,
economic, and paramilitary activities for the
implementation of MONGOOSE. The task includes
planning for "splitting the regime, including liquida~
tion of leaders".

HARVEY writes a memorandum to DDP HELMS saying that

he advised Lansdale's aide FRANK HAND. to excise the
words “including liquidation of leaders" from the
LANSDALE memo because of "the inadmissibility and
stupidity of putting this type of comment in writing

in such a document". Harvey also tells Helms that

he has "careful notes" on McNamara's discussion of
assassination at the Special Group meeting of August 10.

Pills still in place; HARVEY learns that VARONA is
ready to send another team to Cuba.

CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS

HARVEY and ROSELLI agree in Los Angeles to call off
the operation, although not to ‘break baa ae

entries, interception of couriers and other sensitive methods

During all of this period he had inany occasions to
work directly with Mr. Helms and had a close working rela-
tionship with him.

The beginning of 1961, he was asked by Mr. Bissell to’

explore the possibilities of setting up a "executive action
capability" within CIA. In the Fall he was ‘asked by Mr.
Bissell to turn his attention with regard to the general
-area of executive action to the specific target of Castro
and, particularly, to take over one ongoing operation from
the Office of Security. Shortly thereafter, but as a distintt

In December 1967 he ceased his full time relationship with FILE

the Agency. -He continued for a few months to wrap things up
and to consult. Since then, however, he has no connection
with the Agency and is presently in private life.

[As an ‘aside for those who do not know, the reason his
appearance here has been so delayed-is that when I first
called him several weeks ago, he indicated that his wife was
ill and might have to go into the hospital and that he had
other serious personal commitments. We had further conversa
tions about his trying to arrange at some point to come in
when he informed me that his mother was gravely ill. We had
scheduled a visit by myself out to Indianapolis last week,
but his mother passed away. Although he still had personal
commitments and obligations in Indianapolis this week as a
result,which prevented his coming to Washington, he consente
to my interviewing him out.there as a prelude to his testimony

LUMUMBA

I first explored the events related by Mr. O'Donnell in
1960, and Mr. Harvey's knowledge generally about the Congo
and the death of Lumumba. He emphasized that he had known
of no credible evidence of CIA involvement with the actual
death of Lumumba. I asked what he meant by credible. evidenc
and what “looser “evidence he had,aha he indicated that he was
referring to various allegations and news stories he was

aware of.

many on a special assignment at the time O'Donnell actually
spoke to Bissell about going to the Congo. However, he is
quite eain that both O'Donnell and Bissell mentioned it
to him thereafter. He believes O'Donnell mentioned it to
him shortly thereafter and it might have been very close in
time to the conversation with Bissell. His best recollec-
tion is that,as O'Donnell recounted the meeting with Bissel
Bissell-was dearly requesting him to. go on a definite mis-

Sion to try to assassinate Lumumba. O'Donnell told Harvey

how vigorously he had objected and also related that he had

gone to mention it to Mx vey does not recall
whether O'Donnell said he had gone to see Gottlieb.

Thereafter, perhaps in the course of th initial reques

to set up ZRRIFLE, or perhaps at a different time, Harvey
clearly recalls that Bissell also told him about the inci-
dent, and again his impression is that Bissell recounted
that he had requested O'Donnell to.undertake a specific
mission.
At this point we talked, however, about the fact that

there would always be the possibility of a no/go fail-safe

To summarize at the outset, the following is the thrus

of what Harvey would testify to regarding QJWIN/ZRRIFLE:
Harvey regarded ZRRIFLE as the overall project crypt under
which QJWIN as an asset operation was going forward. He had
discussed with Silver the general assignment of exploring
executive action capability, and the possibility that eithe
QUWIN or that other criminals whom WIN helped to spot might
be assets. He never did more than review some of them as
possibilities in the course of his taking an inventory.
However, he did not use WIN or anyone WIN spotted in con-
nection with any assassination operations against Castro

or otherwise, nor did he even discuss the concept with any
of them. He did not stockpile any materials or discuss pre

liminary targets or make plans or evaluations premised on

particular tentative targets. Essentially, he ¢ assed

the technological, human asset, and organizational poten-

tials in being,or which might be organized, under the cland-

Helms and Bissell that the possibilities of effective dis-
creet action were slim. He also concluded that it was
“yidiculous" to try and set up a general reserve capability

at least the only one close to having. a chance at secure
success, Was to simply appoint a single senior officer to do
everything: to run. the operation, kill the person, bury the
body, and tell no one. In regard to Castro, he had used th
ZRRIELE project as the administrative hook for his billing
and so forth, and said that at some times there were mix-
ups in terms of the financing offices, so that QJWIN/ZRRIFL
might be used. He did not completely explain why on some
of his own bills he seems to have indicated QJWIN/
ZRRIFLE, but we did not have time to pursue this at greater
length, whether he would regard this as his own slip or

indicate that to some extent they were written up by others},

the bottom line. is that he would swear that QJWIN was never
_———————

involved in an i rg_operation nor, for
example, ever in the United States, although there is a
plane trip ticket from Miami to Chicago which is charged
to "QJWIN/ZRRIFLE" (Harvey says it was a plane trip of
Roselli's, which was the only thing he ever paid for of

Roselli's.)

WATERVIEW AND MEET

In early 1961 Bissell asked Harvey to explore an FILE

executive action capability. Harvey confirmed and said he
firmly recalls that Bissell on at least two occasions indi-
cated to Harvey that he, Bissell, had been repeatedly im-
portuned by the White House to explore such a capability.
The first time Bissell spoke to him, Harvey thinks, was
early on,and at least one other time occurred which was iki

whether he mentioned anyone at the White House. Harvey

thinks that if Bissell had said that he had been directly
asked by the President, then Harvey wuld have remembered
it even today. His impression is that the implication in
_Bissell's conversation with Harvey was that the White House
had initiated its but he said that he couldn't be sure
whether Bissell had said the White House wanted it set up
to be ready. in being or whether the White House wanted the
possibility explored. Harvey elaborated that the White Hous¢
might say “create such a capability" , or might say "deter-
mine whether it would be a good idea to set up such a
capability" or might say "see if it would be possible. to
set up such a capability."

Harvey is fairly certain that Bissell did not indicate

whether Dulles knew about this White House request, nor coujd

Harvey be sure whether Bissell had indicated whether it was

White House who had made the request. Again, he has the

impression, although he can remember nothing express, that
at the time -he received the distinct impression Bissell's
conversation at the White House had only been a short time

prior to his conversation with Harvey. When pressed, he

said he was not sure and he might even have spoken to Bissell
a short time before the Kennedy inauguration (which would

have meant that Bissell was more likely to have been oe
to the Eisenhower White House as having pressured Bissell Vy
to set up an exécutive action capability.) On the other

hand, he has the strong impression that the second time he

was told by Bissell, i.e., in the fall, Bissell again impli¢d
that the renewed pressures had been recent, thereby strongl
suggesting that, at least at that point it was the Kennedy
White House which was- involved.

Bissell asked him to explore the current clandestine
services capability to make recommendations on how such an
operation should be set up. He does not recall Bissell men
tioning Castro, Lumumba or Trujillo, although it is possibl
that it was at that time that Bissell told Harvey about his
approach: to O'Donnell (and as noted above, Harvey definitel
remembers that,at some point Bissell did do that). But
Harvey does not preclude the possibility that there was a
general discussion of the kinds of situations when that

capability might be useful to have, and that this could hav

included discussions of Trujillo, Castro and Lumumba..He FILE:

simply does not remember and does not think they discussed
the project in terms of likely specific targets.

Either at that first meeting with Bissell or shortly
thereafter, Harvey learned that Arnold Silver and Sidney
Gottlieb had been "cut in" by Bissell on Bissell's interest
in executive action capability. Harvey thought this was
unfortunate, but it was done. Harvey also thought Bissell
should have known better than to discuss Lumumba with
O'Donnell, although Harvey understands and fully respects
O'Donnell's. moral scruples against being involved.

Also, shortly after being asked to set up executive
action capability, Harvey learned about the Cuban operation
involving the Office of Security and understood. that both
J.C. King and J. Esterline were witting, as well as O'Conne41
and Edwards. Harvey is not sure why Bissell would have tol
Silver about the executive action project. But he has a
vague recollection that at some point Bissell indicated to
him that Silver had_an_asset who might be useful. (So pre-
sumably Bissell knew about QJWIN, perhaps from O'Donnell's

Se of him in the Congo.)
Tiver, in any event, knew: (1) that Bissell was

interested in setting up an executive action capability,

and (2) that Bissell had spoken to Ilarvey about it. There-

after he and Silver spoke about it (see -discussion of notes

HW 50955 DocId:32423490 Page 19


AW 50955 Docld:32423490 Page 20

in the file, infra.) Silver's relationship to the entire
project was really threefold: (1) he was actively running
QUWIN the asset, (2) QUWIN was spotting people whom Harvey
assumes Arnold was considering both for normal Division D
type surreptitious entry and code-stealing, and executive
action capability, and (3) Silver did explore the general
concept involved for setting up such capability with itarvey|
We next spoke about the portion of the report suggest-
ing that Harvey had been briefed about the technical de-
velopments of capabilities under the Roselli plot. Harvey
said that he does not recall the name and is fairly certain
he never met or dealt with Dr. Treichler, the person who
actually made the pills in the TSD. He did know both Sid
Gottlieb and "Manny" Gunn fairly well. He said that in
terms of his general professional duties as a Station Chief
and counterespionage expert against the Soviets, he had
madé it a point of keeping fairly current in background
knowledge on the enemy's capabilities for assassination.
He had therefore discussed the latest state of the art with
the Office of Medical Services (where Gunn was) and TSD
(here Gottlieb was). He said he had also discussed with
those offices medical and other scientific aspects of
interrogation techniques (e.g. truth serum) and control
Toihadue: (e.g. post-hypnotic suggestion for controlling
agents). He had had general discussions, therefore, with
both Gunn and Gottlieb. However, he does seem to recall
a discussion of specific techniques with Gunn at one point,

although he is not positive this was after he had been

The reference to Notes hereafter refers to a package
of three sets of notes which we had xeroxed by the Agency.
The first two or three pages which are not in Harvey's
handwriting appear to be a draft of what would be the basic
project outline used as a cover for the ZRRIFLE project.

It does discuss QUWIN as the asset and does indicate that
he will be used to spot other criminals for sensitive pro-
jects. But unlike the subsequent notes, it does not discus
issues regarding the setting up of an assassination capa-
bility. The next set of notes which are in large writing
on pages covered with various doodles are those identifiedty
Harvey es his. From looking at them, he judged that they wer
notes based on two successive conversations. First, with |
sidney Gottlieb on the 25th of January, 1961 and then on
the 26th of January with Arnold Silver. Harvey concluded

that the first conversation with Gottlieb ranged across a

variety of activities which fell within the framework of
Gottlieb's position at TSD. (Harvey speculated Gottlieb
had just. become Acting Director or taken over some other
high post in Tsp.) His conclusion in this regard is based
in part on references in that first section of his notes
to items which he recalls and which he wuld swear have
nothing to do with ZRRIFLE. For example, there is a dis-

cussion of "GE Basic Sounds Project""translation machine"

“thenomena" and "(vy with C.B. [then something illegible])".
Below that appears “commint gear'' and under that is '"Anes-
thesia." Harvey said that there was a project to develop |
a new kind of translating machine and also one to translate

The first part of the Notes of the 25th/1 meeting with
Sidney Gottlieb is headed "Executive Action." Harvey could
not recall what he meant by ‘the phrase "the magic button"

but said that he assumed this was a euphemism either he or

Gottlieb used, for whatever mechanism was eventually chosen.
He could not understand the reference to the narcotics FILE
bureau, except that if Gottlieb or he at that point knew
about QJWIN they might have been aware of his initial in- |
volvement with American intelligence agencies in a narcotic
enforcement operation. The reference to "RIS 201 cover
caution" meant that-if there was an attempt to get a fake
201 file as cover involving the person allegedly in some
operation relevant to the Russian intelligence Set thi
had to be done with great caution. Harvey speculated that
the word "bankruptcy" referred to the same considerations
discussed below -- that there was a. bankruptcy of policy on
the part of the CIA or USA if there had to be a resort to
assassination. (This might frame an interesting general

policy question for Harvey.)

Harvey did not know what "no star" meant. I asked him
if that might refer to the star file system, and he said that
when he was in the Agency he didn't know about one or does
not recall one now. He thinks the reference to "eyes
Jim A. -- contradistinct from U-2" may, have meant that the
check of any assets to be used through the cI Division, a
normal operating technique, in this case should be done on
an "eyes only" basis. through Angleton. He also thought the
reference to the U-2 might mean that unlike that operation,
this project should not be run on such a compartmented basig,
that any assets to be used were not checked with ct (so that
the counterespionage protective resources of the Agency

were utilized.) Harvey thinks that the phrase "not a TSD

problem" probably meant that he was saying that TSD as a FILE:
unit should not be involved in this project, even if some-
one like Gottlieb and one or two trusted people were work-
ing on it for him.

Harvey said the phrase “apply brakes" meant that one
should be able to have a fail-safe mechanism if the situa-
tion changed or that it might have referred to the fact thaf
one hiouldn't jump into this kind of thing too precipitously}.
He said that the phrase “Jast resort. . . beyond last re-
sort and a confession of weakness" meant just what it said
-- ‘that this was a last resort and a profession of weakness
or bankruptcy of U.S. policy. He was not sure why there
was a reference to "pyBenefactor" but said that this might
mean they had discussed situations where such a capability
might be used. (It should be noted at this point, however,
that later on Harvey said he would swear that-he never had
anything to do with Trujillo, did not particularly examine
the possibilities of peculiar needs ‘of such an operation,
and has no first hand knowledge of any involvement we may
have had in that area.) Finally, he said the phrase
“assumptions . . . examples of three single ‘wrong!,"
would seem to suggest that several examples were discussed

(possibly including Trujillo as one) and that Harvey car

that assumptions made in regard to each case by Gottlieb

or someone else were erroneous.

[By the way, I asked Harvey if "ZRACORN" and "ZRRAG- FILE:
TIME" were crypts for projects or were sensitivity indicators,
routing labels, or other control indicators. He said he
could not recall the projects, but thought they would have
been projects and not indicators. He said, however, they
might have been generic labels for a category of projects
and not referring to a specific project. This possibly
contrasts with what the IG's office told David Aaron and
myself, namely, that they were some sort of sensitivity and
control indicators. We can pursue this.

The second part of the two sheets of Harvey's notes
which he said were from a conversation with Silver are fair}
ly self explanatory. ‘The notes on the right hand side _
"Max 2/3 . . . B-WKH-AS-Sid-resev-substitute-[illegible]"

we did not discuss, but I strongly presume this means

a maximum of two or three persons with Bissell, Harvey and
Silver already involved, the possibility of Gottlieb being
included, but with some reservations as a member of the
group. :

Harvey and I did discuss item 8, which refers to a
principal agent, the possibility of using QJWIN, and then
says "AF proj. draft -- LCH -- tested 1500 from NB -- mask
spot[{spat?] rqm still AF project [name illegible]." Harvey
said the initials probably did refer to Lester Heuck, but
since he had never’ discussed ZRRIFLE with Houck at that tim

or later, he assumes ‘that this referred to the fact that

HW 50955 DocId:32423490 Page 25


INTERVIEW AND MEETING SUM

Heuck might have been familiar with QJWIN's role in Africa

We algo discussed item 12 which refers to a cover file
created to prove RIS [illegible] and point 13 which notes
that there was a danger of RIS counteraction if we tried

to put the blame on tle Russians.

J did not discuss with Harvey all of the consideration
listed on the two pages of notes which appear immediately
after his in the file. His best guess was that they were.
notes prepared by Arnold Silver, either.as a result of the
conversation between Silver and Harvey or simply based, on
Silver's preparing a paper at Harvey's request after they
had talked. Harvey said, however, he thought he recognized
some of the concepts expressed as his own. I did ask him
about the referénce to “our own experience (Bangkok and
effect on DDP)'". After some thought, he said it might have
referred to some incident in Thailand, but he could not
remember it. I asked him if he remembered the Killim case;
it refreshed his recollection. He said he had heard about
it; he did not know any of the details but thought that's
probably what the reference was to. I also asked him what

he thought the first sentence of point number three in. this

set of notes meant: "Maximum security, KUBARK only PILE:

(e.g.-what does Siragusa now know?)" He said that since

the first part means it obviously should be handled within

CIA, the question was what Siragusa, a leading BNDD man

who often worked with the CIA, knew, possibly about QJWIN

if he were to be an asset(because of WIN's earlier work on

narcotics cases, supra.) We then discussed the last sentenc

of point three which is a question: "DCI officially advisedpP"
Harvey said this would have been a legitimate policy

point,at least to raise for consideration. In effect, it

was extending the notion of plausible deniability down one

level to protect ‘the DCI in case there was a flap. He does

not recall any decisions on this point, but simply that it

was a policy issue. to be laid on the table. (Compare his

arguments in regard to why McCone might not have been

apprised of the Phase II operation.)

At this point Harvey revicwed the rest of the file
memos I had brought, With regard to the accounting againpt

Roselli, he. suggested that. he always thought of ZRRIFLE as
the overarching crypt within which were the QJWIN operation
and the ZRRIFLE :° ~ explpration of executive action
He said that he used QJWIN/ZRRIFLE sometimes in connection

One initial mixup by the finance section which resulted in

regard to a note that refened to Henry Manfreddi, vey
did not know why his name was on notes in the QJWIN

file, except that he was a highly talented narcotics expert
who worked both in the Justice Department and the CIA and
who might have been involved in the evaluating of or check-
ing on potential assets whom QJWIN had spotted in Italy.
(The file does reveal that QJWIN spotted assets in Italy.)

With regard to the small note in the file that simply

says "John Ralston — John Roselli -- William Walker."

Page 28



Harvey said that that was a note he left for Helms when he | yqrp:
went to’ Rome $o that Helms would be alert if anything came

in either for himself (he was William Walker) or for Roselli

or relating to Roselli (who was "Ralston").

Harvey again summarized ZRRIFLE as follows:

(1) A search for what assets and capabilities might
be available; (2) No recruitment of anyone in general or
for specific targets; (3) no preliminary targetting of any
victims, even in a general way; (4) no stockpiling of
lethal equipment or 'merchandise".

He said that he kept both Helms and Bissell generally
informed of his progress. He had briefed Helms on the
assignment shortly after being given it by Bissell because
Helms, @S number 2 in DDP,was too likely to see something
something coming in or to be working on an independent pro-
ject in the same area or related with someone else, and he
thought it was important that Helms knew generally what
Harvey was working on and that he had an assignment to do
it from Bissell. ee

Bissell.did not talk too much about why Edwards was in
charge of Phase I of the mob operation. Harvey thinks that
Bissell may have indicated . some
question about whether they should have gotten into it with
Edwards and O'Connell.

Before describing Bissell's instructions to Harvey in
November to turn ZRRIFLE to Castro, Harvey jumped ahead and
we discussed the setup of Task Force W. He made clear that

he was instructed to do this by llclms, not Bissell, It was

¢lear Bissell was on his way out. Helms asked Harvey to

do it, As his condition,Harvey got a promise that he could
put in totally fresh people and not take anyone from the
old Latin American division, which did not please them,

‘this setup of Task Force W was something that he
undertook in December, farlier,- probably in November, Bissell
had suggested he direct his attention regarding executive
action capability to Castro, and specifically asked him to
take over the Office of Security operation. Harvey

emphasized that the destruction of Castro was the top priority

that time. They wanted him overthrown at all costs, on the

by clandestine means. Harvey said he told his superiow tha
he. could produce a provisional government for a few days on

the island which. could ask for help, but that was really

all that he could guarantee and that then the U.S. would
have to send in assistance -- which the Kennedys were un-
willing to do. As a result, he says, there was a great
sense of frustration and an effort to try to comply with
Kennedy's wishes to topple the regime clandestinely. He
says that Sissel! reiterated at that time the statement that
he was being prodded by the White Ilouse to explore the
questions of executive action capability. (It is not clear

from my notes whether Harvey was saying that this time

Bissell said the push from the White House was for executive

action capability against Castro, or still in/a general

sense. Obviously, this should be nailed down.)

INTERVIEW AND MEBTTING SI

When I asked Harvey whether it was possible that [;

all Bissell had said in the fall was that the Kennedys wanted
to topple Castro's government, Harvey said, "No." Bissell
clearly said that the White House had reiterated its interept
in executive action (i.e. assassination) capability. We
discussed whether it was not inconsistent or at least
incongruous for the White House to ask for a general capa-
bility to be explored, if the President in fact knew of the
ongoing Maheu-Roselli plot. Harvey said that if the White
House had authorized the go-ahead for Phase I initially it
would not have been good form for Dulles to have told then
of the actual specifics of the plot, or the day by day
account of its going forward. ‘Therefore, he said, it was
possible the White House merely knew they had approved CIA'
pursuing executive action against Castro, but not -knowing

how it. was coming ,and, therefore, in the fall. asking the

people to pursue generally the possibility of using assassina-

Harvey said shortly after Bissell had asked him to turn
his attention to Castro, Bissell authorized and Harvey re-

ceived a briefing from Edwards on the Phase I project. Shortly

after, Harvey in turn briefed Helms in general on the proje¢t.
!

: Later,

Harvey said that he recalls Edwards briefing him on Edwards'
and Houston's conversations with Kennedy (RFK), But he does
not remember what Edwards said, or whether Edwards said

that Kennedy had been upset in regard to the Mafia use wien|

out his knowledge or the assassination effort without his
knowledge. Harvey does remember Kennedy was angry. Nor
does he recall whether Edwards indicated they had told RFK
it was a finished operation or not.

Harvey indicated that he had spoken with Helms prior
to having Edwards introduce him to Roselli. He did not
know if it was then or at a later time that he and Helms
discussed not briefing McCone, but he agrees that
definitely did take place. He gave a variety of reasons.
The first, again, was that it did n&t."happen on McCone's
watch," so why tell him about a potentially messy situation
or involve him in it? The second argument was that he,
in fact, did not think much of the operation, was skeptical
from the outset as to whether anything was really going
forward in Cuba, or was just a lot of third and fourth hand
allegations of accomplishment, In general, thought the
whole setup stank. He was taking time to sort it out and
see what it really looked like before abandoning it and in
the meanwhile it was going forward but did not seem worth
discussing with McCone. He also mentioned the question of
plausible deniability for the DCI as a possible, why he migh
have urged on Helms that McCone not be briefed. In any
event, he says it was definitely Helms" decision.

Harvey does recall being told that the pills were passdd
into Cuba in the late spring, although he again emphasized
that all of the information on this project was third and

fourth hand. He recalled the van of equipment given to Verdna

as his price for involvement and that some firearms were
involved, including possibly sniper-scope rifles. He also
recalls a yoport that three men were going into Cuba later
in the early summer jbut did not associate this in his mind
with the possibility of using the pills, as distinct from
the possibility of using firearms against Castro. He also

reemphasize/ that, it was taking
him a while to sort out. the project, get a feel for the
people, the credibility, the security problems, and so
forth, which is one reason why he kept on, even though he
had low hopes for it from the outset.

With the missile crisis imminent -- and we did have

advanced knowledge of at least a general military buildup -
Harvey said he was unwilling to toss away any assets that
might, be useful against Castro, and the plan was generally
kept in operation ‘through that time. But he said that as
soon as the crisis was over, he indicated to. Roselli he
wanted the project to be cut off, albeit gradually so +s

not to engender hard feelings or other side effects.

Shortly thereafter the plans to end the project were cut,
although the relationship continued on and was only gradually
ended over the first part of 1963. (There are expense sheet

for Miami as late as April 1963.)

that he often suggested he was expressing Bobby Kennedy's
views or speaking for him and that there was always some
question there. (I don't know how strongly Harvey would
testify along these lines, however. He is generally very
hesitant to poor-mouth anyone.) Harvey said that he knew
of no basis for Lansdale to have originally put the refer-
ence to liquidating leaders as a study item in the memorandam
which upset him so. He said that whenever Lansdale thereat er
tried to raise the subject with him he did, as the 1967 study

With regard to Phase II, and the actual operations,
Harvey said that all the stories about Roselli: being invol ed
in boat trips to Cuba and other heroics were a lot of "crag"--
although he is quick to defend Roselli's patriotism and
his contribution as the middle man in this operation. He
also disclaimed any knowledge of other plots against Castra,

peerecte He said that he knew nothin
about plots to assassinate Castro coming-out of Guantanamo
any involvement of Barker, Sturgis, or any first-hand know-+
ledge of the Cubella plot, although he later learned of it.

Our final reprise was on the question of the general
policy of the period,. ~~ He said he wanted to emphasize
that ,given the Kennedys’ strong commitment to getting rid

of Castro and their contemplation of violent overthrow or

attack, he thinks the entire situation could be summarized
that (implicitly, even if they had not specifically auth-
orized Phase I and Phase II) the shooting of one Cuban,
even Fidel, by another Cuban, was not a major change or
new departure in U.S. policy that would have required

‘additional approval.

Indianapolis, June 19, 1975 FILE
Interviewer - Burt Wides.

I flew out to Indianapolis on the evening of the 18th
and interviewed Mr. Harvey from 7:30 until approximately
12:30 on the morning of the 19th. .

We first reviewed Mr. Harvey's career outline. He was
with the FBI from 1940 until 1947 and worked on German and
Soviet counterespionage cases, including the Elizabeth
Bentley case and several of: the major cases involving our us
of Nazi agents as double agents during WWII. In 1947 he worked
briefly for the Central Intelligence Group and then its suc-~
cessor, the CIA.

His first position with the CIA was as head of the Sovie|
Intelligence Branch in the Soviet Union Division. This was
the unit in charge of counterintelligence against Soviet
intelligence services at the inception of the CIA. Harvey was
shortly thereafter given an additional hat while retaining
the first position. The additional job was the coordinator
for the clandestine.services on communications intelligence.
In the summer of 1948 he became the Deputy Assistant Director}
of the Office of Special Operations (predecessor of DDP) in
charge of counterespionage. From the fall of 1952 until 1959
he was Station Chief in Berlin. During the early to mid-50's
he was in charge of the famous Berlin Tunnel operation, .which
tunneled under the East German telephone junction points from

West. Berlin.

Washington, D. C. 20510

Dear Fritz:

In response to your telephone call of 27 June 1975,
I offer you the following based on my memory of certain
events and the atmosphere of the times: (Please note
that my records on this era are not all that precise.
My memory is vivid and may be biased. However, as a
close observer, here is what I recall, for what it is
worth.) :

You should be aware that this Agency felt itself
to be under very strong pressure in the early 1960s to
bring about change in the Cuban regime. This pressure
was strongest after the Bay of Pigs incident in April
1961 and although it dissipated somewhat after the Cuban
Missile Crisis in October 1962, it has never really
completely disappeared. In any event, when Mr. Robert F.
Kennedy accepted the proposals by General Lansdale which
led to the formation of the MONGOOSE Project, it was
clear to the DCI, Mr. John A. McCone, that the major tasks
in. this broad covert action program would fall on CIA.
McCone in turn made it clear to Agency officials that
this task was very much a direct charge on the Agency.
It should also be noted that from the beginning, there
was little hope that the program as conceived would
actually achieve its purpose which was to bring about
the removal of the Castro government. and to replace it
with one whose interests would be more compatible with
American interests and the interests of other governments
in the Western Hemisphere.

William K. ‘Harvey, who was placed in charge of the

Agency's Cuban Task Force, has, as you know, a very
special type of personality. Both his manner and his

method, in my opinion, tend to be thorough, comprehensive,

and time-consuming.

Because of the nature of his assign-

ment and because of his personality traits, his personal
relations, particularly with General Lansdale and with
the Attorney General, were never very pleasant to begin
with, and tended to deteriorate steadily.

A climax of sorts occurred at a meeting of the
Special Group Augmented during which the Chairman asked
. a specific question, noting that he had ten minutes in
which to hear the reply and wanted a crisp answer within

that period.

Mr. Harvey was not forthcoming, and the

Chairman left the meeting after ten minutes expressing
strong dissatisfaction with things in general and Harvey

in particular.

After this meeting it was clear to McCone that
Harvey had broken his lance and would have to be replaced.
In due course, he was replaced.

During the Cuban Missile Crisis, when it was
virtually impossible to get access to top officials in the
government and get their guidance on day-to-day affairs;
Harvey, who did indeed try to get such guidance, on his
own concluded that United States policy was headed toward
a full-scale invasion of Cuba. He ordered a number of
agent teams to be dispatched to the island for intelligence
collection and to be in place as assets to support a con-
ventional military operation. General Lansdale claimed
this was done without his knowledge and authorization and
there was a confrontation in McCone's office. McCone
concluded that unless these teams were being sent to
satisfy specific requirements by the Secretary of State
and the Secretary of Defense that they should be recalled.
Since there was no such requirement, they were recalled.
In a separate meeting, McCone reassured Lansdale that
he was in fact Chief of Operations. As a result of this,
Harvey earned another black mark as not being fully under

control.

I trust the foregoing will be of some value to you.
