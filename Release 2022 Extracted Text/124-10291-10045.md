THAT HIS PRESENCE IN CHILE NOT BE MADE A MATTER OF PUBLIC

KNOWLEDGE. FOR THIS REASON, THE MEETING WAS ARRANGED TO TAKE

PLACE IN THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE RATHER THAN AT DIEGO PORTALES

GOVERAMENT HOUSE, WHERE THERE IS A GREATER RISK OF DISCOVERY BY

[IN CARACAS COMMENTED THAT ALTHOUGH RIVAS HAS, ON OCCASION, HANDLSD (5)

SPECIAL ASSIGNMENTS FOR THE PEREZ ADMINISTRATION, SUCH AN

ASSIGNMENT AS DESCRIBED IN THIS REPORT IS UNUSUAL. IT IS OUT OF

CHARACTER FOR PEREZ TO EXPLAIN OR APOLOGIZE FOR HIS ACTIONS AND

IT APPEARS STRANGE THAT A PEREZ REFRESENTATIVE WOULD ADMIT THAT

BOSCH HAS POWERFUL FRIENDS IN THE VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT WHEN THE

GOVERNMENT HAS GONE TO GREAT LENOTHS TO ATTEMPT TO HIDE THIS FACT.)
