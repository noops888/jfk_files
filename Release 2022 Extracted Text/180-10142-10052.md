An Agency official who was a DDO records expert and

efforts concerning the John F. Kennedy assassination, gave

the Committee a somewhat different explanation of the

circumstances surrounding the term "AG" and its placement on

Oswald's opening form. This individual testified that "AG"

In responding to a request for the criteria used in
compiling a "Watch List," the CIA referred to a section of

the Report to the President by the Commission on CIA Activities

Individuals or organizations of particular intelligence
interest (one should also add counterintelligence
interest) were specified in Watch Lists provided

-to the mail project by the Counterintelligence Staff,.

number of names on the Watch List varied, from time

to time, but on the average, the list included
approximately 300 names, including about 100 furnished
by the FBI. The Watch List included the names of -
foreigners and of United States citizens.

A review of Oswald's correspondence with the American

embassy in Moscow indicates that on February 13, 1961, the

embassy received a letter from him in which he expressed a

“desire to return to the United States if...some agreement

[eould be reached/ concerning the dropping of any legal

proceedings against /him7." __/ On February 28, 1961,. the

embassy sought guidance from the State Department concerning
Oswald's potential liability to criminal prosecution. / f

The State Department, however, responded ‘on April 13, 1961 that

it was "not in a position to advise Mr. Oswald whether upon his 5

desired return to the United. States he may be amenable to f
prosecution for any possible offenses committed in violation

of the laws of the United States..." / - [

On May 10, 1961, Oswald wrote the embassy demanding a é

American political and economic conditions resulting
from his extensive travel in South and Central America

Access to a. Military Intelligence file, which the ¢
Department of Defense never gave to the Warren Commission, was
not possible because the Department of Defense had destroyed
the file as part of a general program aimed at eliminating all
of its files pertaining to nonmilitary personnel. In
“response to a Committee inquiry, the Department of Defense
gave the following explanation for the file's. destruction:

1. Dossier AB 652876, OSWALD, Lee Harvey, was
identified for deletion from IRR (Intelligence
Records and Reports) holdings on Julian date

\ 73060 (1 March 1973) as stamped on the micro-

‘ filmed dossier cover. It is not possible to

determine the actual date when physical
destruction was accomplished, but is credibly
surmised that the destruction was accomplished
within a period not greater than sixty days
following the identification for deletion.

Evidence such as the type of deletion record
available, the individual clerk involved in

the identification, and the projects in progress
at the time of deletion, all indicate the dossier
deletion resulted from the implementation of a
Department of the Army, Adjutant General letter
dated 1 June 1971, subject: Acquisition of
Information Concerning Persons and Organizations
not Affiliated with the Department of Defense (DOD)
(Incl 1). Basically, the letter called for the
elimination of files on non-DOD affiliated
persons and organizations.

2.° It is not possible to determine who accomplished
the actual physical destruction of the dossier.

The individual identifying the dossier for deletion
can be determined from the clerk number appearing

on the available deletion record. The number
indicates that Lyndall E. Harp was the identifying
clerk. Harp was an employee of the IRR from 1969
until late 1973, at which time she transferred

to the Defense Investigative Service, Fort Holabird,
Maryland, where she is still a civil service
employee. The individual ordering the destruction
or deletion cannot be determined. However, available
evidence indicates that the dossier was identified
for deletion under a set of criteria applied by

IRR clerks to all files. The basis for these
criteria were established in the 1 June 1971 letter.
There is no indication that the dossier was specifically
identified for review or. deletion. All evidence
shows that the file was reviewed as part of a
generally applied program to eliminate any dossier
concerning persons not affiliated with DOD.

3. The exact material contained in the dossier
cannot be determined at this time. ‘However,
discussions with all available persons who recall
seeing the dossier reveal that it most probably
included: newspaper clippings relating to pro-
Cuban activities of Oswald, several Federal
Bureau of Investigation reports, and possibly
some Army counterintelligence reports. None of
the persons indicated that they remember any

significant information in the dossier. It should
be noted here that the Army was not asked to
investigate the assassination. Consequently, any
Army derived information was turned over to the
appropriate civil authority.

4. At the time of the destruction of ‘the Oswald

disposal authority contained in the DOD Memorandum
to Secretaries of the Military Departments, OASD(A),
9 February 1972, subject: Records Disposal
Authority (Incl 2). The memorandum forwards
National Archivist disposal criteria which is
similar in nature to the requirements outlined

in the 1 June 1971 instructions.. It was not

until 1975 that the Archivist changed the criteria
to ensure non-destruction of investigative records
that may be of historical value. /

Upon receipt of this information, the Committee

orally requested the destruction order relating to the file

on Oswald. In a letter dated September 13, 1978, the General

Counsel of the Department of.the Army replied that no such

order existed:

Army regulations do not require any type of

specific order before intelligence files can be
destroyed, and none was prepared in connection

with the destruction of the Oswald file. As a rule,
investigative information on persons not directly
affiliated with the Defense Department can be retained
in Army files only for short periods of time and in
carefully regulated circumstances. The Oswald file
