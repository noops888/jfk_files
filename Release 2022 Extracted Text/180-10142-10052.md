this matter.

The Committee sought to resolve the issue of Oswald's

alleged association with the CIA by conducting an inquiry

that went beyond the threshold level of obtaining statements

from two of the Agency's most senior officials. Instead,

more analytical investigative approach was utilized.

First, an effort was made to identify circumstances either

For example, the Oswald file was purportedly opened

because he was considered to be a potential counterintelligence

he had ever had any relationship with the CIA. Nevertheless,

because the Committee was aware of at least one instance

Agency officials questioned by

the Committee have testified that the substance of the

October 31, 1959 cable was sufficiently important to warrant

the opening of a 201 file. In fact, however, Oswald's file

was not opened until December 9, 1960.

The CIA was requested by the Committee to indicate

where documents pertaining to Oswald had been disseminated

internally and stored prior to the opening of his 201 file.

•In response, the Agency advised the Committee that because

document dissemination records of low national security

significance are retained for only a five-year period, they

are no longer in existence for the years

1959-1963.

Consequently, the Agency was unable to explain either when

these documents had been received or by which component.

An Agency memorandum, dated September 18, 1975,

indicates that Oswald's file was opened on December 9, 1960

by virtue of the receipt of five documents: two from the

FBI, two from the State Department, and one from the Navy.

This reasoning, however, is inconsistent with the presence

in Oswald's file of four State Department documents dated in

1959 and a fifth dated May 25, 1960. It is, of course,

possible that the September 18, 1975 memorandum is referring

to

State Department documents that were received by the

"AG. "

This code was reportedly added to Oswald's

opening form because of the comment on the form that he had

defected to the Soviet Union in 1959.

An Agency official who was a DDO records expert and

for many years had been involved in the CIA's investigative

efforts concerning the John F. Kennedy assassination, gave

the Committee a somewhat different explanation of the

circumstances surrounding the term "AG" and its placement on

Oswald's opening form. This individual testified that "AG"

was an example of a code used to aid in preparing computer

listings of occupational groupings or intelligence affiliations.

He explained that these codes always utilized two letters and

that in this case, the first letter "A" nust have represented

Commurism, while the second letter would represent some

category within the Communist structure.

His recollection was that at the time of the

assassination, the "AG" code was not yet in existence because

there were no provisions then in effect within the Agency for

the indexing of American defectors. He recalled that it was

only during the life of the Warren Commission that the CIA

realized that its records system lacked provisions for

indexing an individual such as Oswald. Consequently, the

CIA then revised its records handbook to include authorization

for indexing American defectors and established a code for

its computer system to be used for the category of "American

defectors." Although this Individual did not know when the

that it would have to have been following the addition of

the American defector code, thus placing the time somewhere

in the middle of the Warren Commission's investigation. He

Why does the opening form for bee Harvey Oswald's

201 file indicate that the file was to be restricted?

The form that was used to initiate the opening of lee

Harvey Oswald's 201 file contains a notation indicating that

the file was to be "restricted." This indication was

considered potentially significant because of the CIA's

practice of restricting agents' files to persons on a "need

acces.

to know" basis.

Further investigation, however, revealed that restricting

access to a file was not necessarily indicative of any relation-

ship with the CIA.

The individual who actually placed the restriction on

Oswald's file testified that this was done simply to allow

her to remain aware of any developments that might have

occurred with regard to the file. This purpose was achieved

ecause any person seeking access to the file tirst had t

the Committee discovered an unsigned memorandum to the Chief

of Counterintelligence, Research and Analysis, dated

February 1964, which stated that 37 documents were missing

from Oswald's 201 file. According to the memorandum, this

statement was based upon a comparison of a machine listing

of documents officially recorded as being in the 201 file and

those documents actually physically available in the file.

In response to a Committee inquiry, the CIA advised

that because Oswald's file was so active during the course of

up-to-date machine listings

were produced periodically. On this basis, the Agency stated

"it must be assumed that whoever was responsible for

maintaining the Oswald file brought thié

Because this response was incomplete, the author of

file was not always necessary.

arranged the actual interview with Oswald.. She met with Oswald

just once. She believes that MoVickar called her on November 17,

the day after her interview with Oswald, and asked her to supper.

That evening at supper they discussed her interview with Oswald.

McVickar indicated a general concern about Oswald and felt that

pushed Oswald further

in the direction of defection. McVickar

some superficial intelligence training. This training mainly

involved lectures on Soviet life and instructions on remembering

tour of duty in Moscow, Davison was asked by an Embassy

employee, whose name he no longer remembers, to obseive a

The Committee reviewed Gaudet's CIA file, but found

neither any record reflecting a contact between him and the

Agency after 1961, nor any indication that he had "performed

Rankin, dated September. 14, 1964, added that during the 1964

European

cities issued Soviet tourist visas in from five to

seven days.

In an effort to resolve this issue, the Committee has

reviewed the CIA file on Gregory Golub, who was the Soviet

Consul in Helsinki when Oswald was issued his tourist visa.

Golub's file reveals that, in addition to his Consular

activities, he was suspected to have been an officer

of the Soviet KGB.

Two CIA dispatches from Helsinki concerning Golub

are of particular significance with regard to the time

the Soviet Union. The first dispatch records that Golub

disclosed during a luncheon conversation that:

Americans visas without prior approval from

He (Golub) stated that this would

make his job much easier, and as long as

he was convinced the American was "all right"

The Committee found no evidence suggestive of any

Moreover, the

Agency's investigative efforts, prior to the assassination,

regarding Oswald's presence in Mexico City served to confirm

the absence of any relationship with him. Specifically, when

apprised of his possible presence in Mexico City, the Agency

the avert nature and frequency of Oswald's contacts with

the Cuban and Soviet Consulates (i.e., a total of at least five

visits) also tended to indicate that Oswald was not under. the

direction of any professional intelligence officers.

Lee-Hasvey Oswald's Military Records

The Committee reviewed Oswald's military records because

of allegations that he had received intelligence training

and had participated in intelligence operations during his

term of service. Particular attention was given to the

charges that Oswald's early discharge from the Marine Corps

was designed to serve as a cover for an intelligence

assignment and that his records reflected neither his true

security clearance nor a substantial period of service in

Taivan.

These allegations were considered relevant to the

question of whether Oswald had been performing intelligence

he had ever received any intelligence training or performed

on any intelligence assignments during his term of service.

Col. Robert E. Jones, Operations Officer of the U.S. Army's

Oswald, and raised the possibility that he had intelligence

associations of some kind. The Committee's investigation,

however, revealed that military intelligence officials had

opened a file on Oswald because he was perceived as a possible

counterintelligence threat.

June of 1963 he had been serving as Operations Officer of the

112th Military Intelligence Group at Fort Sam Houston, Texas.*

Under the Group's control were seven regions encompassing five

states:

Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, New Mexico, and Oklahoma.

that

Oswald first came to his attention in mid-1963 through information

to the effect that Oswald had been arrested there in connection

with Fair Play for Cuba Committee activities.

Has a result of

this information, the 112th Military Intelligence Group took

an interest in Oswald as a possible counterintelligence

threat. The Group collected information from local agencies

and the military central records facility, and opened a file

under the names Lee Harvey Oswald and A. J. Hidell. Placed

in this file were documents and newspaper articles on such

topics as Oswald's defection to the Soviet Union, his travels

there, his marriage to a Russian national, his return to the

United States, and his pro-Cuba activities in New Orleans.

at consistent with FBI communications that were generated as

a result of the information which he initially provided.

Access to Oswald's Military Intelligence file, which the

Department of Defense never gave to the Warren Commission, was

not possible because the Department of Defense had destroyed

the file as part of

a general program aimed at eliminating all

of its files pertaining to nonmilitary personnel. . In

response to a Committee inquiry, the Department of Defense

gave the following explanation for the file's destruction:

1. Dossier AB 652876, OSWALD, Lee Harvey, was

identified for deletion from IRR (Intelligence

Records and Reports) holdings on Julian date

73060 (1 March 1973) as stamped on the micro-

filmed

dossier cover.

It is not possible to

determine the actual date when physical

destruction was accomplished, but is credibly

surmised

that the destruction was accomplished

within a period not greater than sixty days

following the identification for deletion.

Evidence such as the type of deletion record

the identification, and the projects in progress

at the time of deletion, all indicate the dossier

deletion resulted from the implementation of a

Department of the Army, Adjutant General letter

dated I June 1971, subject: Acquisition of

InFormation Concerning Persons and Organizations

not Affiliated with the Department of Defense (DOD)

(Incl 1).

Basically, the letter called for the

elimination of files on non-DOD affiliated

persons and organizations.

2. It is not possible to determine who accomplished

the actual physical destruction of the dossier.

The individual identifying the dossier for deletion

can be determined from

the clerk number appearing

on the available deletion record.

The number

indicates that Lyndall E. Harp was the identifying

clerk.

Harp was an employee of the IRR from 1969

until late 1973, at which time she transferred

to the Defense Investigative Service, Fort Holabira,

Maryland, where she is still a civil service

employee.

The individual ordering the destruction

or deletion cannot be determined.

However, available

evidence indicates that the dossier was identified

for deletion under a set of criteria applied by

IRR clerks to all files.

The basis for these

criteria were established in the 1 June 1971 letter.

There is no indication that the dossier was specifically

identified for review or deletion.

All evidence

shows that the file was reviewed

as part of a

generally applied program to eliminate any dossier

concerning persons not affiliated with DOD.

3. The exact material contained in the dossier

cannot be determined at this time.

However,

discussions with all available persons who recall

seeing the dossier reveal that it most probably

included:

newspaper clippings relating to pro-

Cuban activities of Oswald, several Federal

Bureau of Investigation reports, and possibly

be noted here that the Army was not asked to

investigate the assassination.

Consequently, any

Army derived informationwas turned over to the

appropriate civil authority.

At the time of the destruction of the Oswald

dossier, IRR was operating under the records

disposal authority contained in the DOD Memorandum

to Secretaries of the Military Departments, OASD (A) .

9 February 1972, subject:

The memorandum forwards

Archivist disposal criteria which is

similar in nature to the requirements outlined

in the 1 June 1971 instructions..

It was not

until 1975 that the Archivist changed the criteria

to ensure non-destruction of investigative records

that may be of historical value.

Upon receipt of this information, the Committee

orally requested the destruction order relating to the file

on Oswald. In a letter dated September 13, 1978, the General

Counsel of the Department of. the Army replied that no such

order existed:

Army regulations do not require any type of

specific order before intelligence files can be

destroyed, and none was prepared in connection

with the destruction of the Oswald file.

As a rule,

investigative information on persons not directly

affiliated with the Defense Department can be retained

in Army files only for short periods of time and in

carefully regulated circumstances. The Oswald file

finds this "routine" destruction of the

Oswald file extremely troublesome, especially when viewed in

light of the Department of Defense's failure to make this file

available to the Warren Commission. Despite the credibility

of Jones' testimony, without access to this

file the question

of Oswald's possible affiliation with military intelligence

cannot be fully resolved.
