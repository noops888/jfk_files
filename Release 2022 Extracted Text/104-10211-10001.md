During the year April 1964-April 1965 NOSENKO was under the

medical care of a clA psychiatrist

who visited NOSHiNO at regular

intervals, usually weekly, to examine him physically ard to listen

to any comments NOSENKO might have about himself and his situation.

The psychiatrist familiarized himself with availabie materials on

NOSENKO, particularly with reports of his behavior in the months

immediately following the defection. A report which he submitted

on 20 December 1964 is given below.

B. Views of Intelligence Pelsonnel

1. Statement by DERYABIN

a. Introduction

Former KGB officer Peter Sergeyevich DERYABIN has followed

closely the entire course of CIA's investigation of NOSENKO and

his information.

He took part in the interrogations of NOSENKO

1n April 1964, January-February 1965, and October 1966 as an ob-

server and consultant, and he personally questioned NOSENKO during

July and hugust 1965 concerning certain aspects of his personal

past and early KOB career.

On the basis of his direct, personal

knodledge of conditions within the Soviet Union and of KGY organi-

zation ard procedures prior to his defection in February 1954,

-supplemented by cortinuing study of later informatión from a

variety of sources, DERYABIN is of the opinion that much of what

NOSENKO has said about himself and the KGB is purposefully false

or distorted.

Although DERY¿BIN has been able to offer authorita-

tive comment on many aspects of NOSENKO's story, the folloring

section of this paper is limited to his remarks

concerning liOSEN-

KO's entry into the KGB (ther. MVD)

and his Communist Party affili-

ation,

both of wlich fall into the period when DERYABIN was active

as a KGB (then MVD) staff officer.

DERYABIN personally interro-

gated NOSENKO on these topics in the summer of 1965.

Since DER-

YABIN was a personrel officer of the KGB (then GB and MVD) in

Moscow, dith long experience

in Communist Party activities, at

the time NOSENKO claims to have entered the American Department

of the KGB Second Chief Directorate,

he is particularly qualified

to comment on these aspects of NOSENKO's story.

DERYABIN, as a

Soviet Army officer, das graduated in 1945

from the higher counterintelligence school of Smersh (counter-

intelligence dith the Soviet Armed

Forces).

Folloving this he

worked in Naval. Smersh in Moscow and in March 1947 began to work

in the MGB as a

case officer in the Central Personnel Directorate.

Shortly afterwards,

when his superior was appointed Deputy Chief

of the Chief Guards Directorate for Personnel, DERYABIN trans-

ferred with him to the Guards Directorate.

tie served as a Guards

Directorate personnel officer until May 1952, rising through the

ranks from case officer to the position of Chief of Section.

of his responsibilities was the approval of personnel for service

in various units of the Guards Directorate, and he was also

charge of supervising personnel and security matters concerning

one of the Directorate's surveillance sub-sece10n5.

After requesting a change from personnel to operational

duties, DERYABIN was transferred in May 1952 to the Austro-German

Department' of the MGB Foreign Intelligence Directorate.

Until

December 1952 he served as the Deputy Chief of a sub-section in

che Counterintelligence Sektor (desk)

of the Austro-German Depart-

ment.

He was then appointed Deputy Chief of the intelligence

Sektor of the same department.

¿ position he held until March

1953.

From farch until September 1953, DERYABIN was the Deputy

Chief of the section in MGB Headquarters which

was responsible

for the security of Soviets stationed in Austria and Germany:

In September 1953 he das transferred to Vienna, where he became

Deputy Chief of the section in the MVD Legal Residency respong-

¡ble for the security of Soviets in Austria. He defected to

American authorities on 15 February 1954.

b. DERYABIN '8 Comments

The following statements by DERYABIN are based or. his question-

1ng of NOSENKO between 26 July and 13 August 1965.

The questiong

were during this period. Although the Soviet State Secu-

rity Service did not become known as the KGB until March 1954,

this term is used for convenience sake, except where the specific

comments follod:

"NOSENKO'S Acceptance into State Security*

"Taking NOSENKO's. own statements at face value, it is highly

improbable that a person such

as he has described himself to be

dould be acceptable for a position as a staff officer in State

Security.

The folloving factors are important in this regard:

It was the policy of State Security to avoid hiring

the children of high govertment officials.

b. Until STALIN's death in March 1953, KOBULOV, the

man who supposedly helped NOSENKO gain entrance into the

service, had no influence inside the NGS apparatus.

about 1948 until 9 or 10 March 1953, KOBULOV had no office

Irside the MGB or the :D buildings... I know personally that

in these years KOBULOV worked in Germany as Deputy Chief of

the GUSIMZ (Chief Directorate of Soviet Properties Abroad) **

which was once directly under the Council of Ministers and

later under the Ministry of Foreign Trade.

The office was

(If one accepts

KOBULOV das not then in State §ecurity.

It is impossible that State Security

would accept him kroring in advance that on his birthday ne

Party membership.

iven for the son of a Mirister, the Secre-

tary of the komsomol Conmittee of the KGS would have to talk

for his acceptance, especially for the Internal Counterintel-

a Minister and one sho is recommended by KOBULOV, the secre-

tary would request from NOSENKO a recommendatior. for Party

membership from the members of the Communist Party where

NOSENKO used to work, in this case the GRU.

In this way the

secretary of the Komsomol would be sure himself that NOSENKO

would become a candidate member of the Communist Party during

the next year.

"However, even acceptirg that despite these obstacles and

contradictions the KGB dould have accepted him, ore

remember laccording to roSaNKO's oun statemenis) that NOSENKO's

file contained the folio.ing negative points.*

They are serious

factors and certain of them alone would be erough to cause the

rejection; the totality makes it difficult to believe that at a

time of crisis in the State Security organs anyone would take the

respor. sibility of accepting him:

Subject was already married and divorced before entry

Into State Security.

He had been married to General TELEGIN's daughter

and TELSGIN had beer. arrested by State Security and was in

jail the day that Subject entered State Security.

NOSENKO said that there was a file on losenko's

father in which compromising material was collected on

Subject's family.

NOSENKO agreed that one piece of infor-

nation that would have-been in this file was the fäct that

his maternal grandfather died ir. a Soviet prison while under

sentence as a counter-revolutionary..

The social status background in the life of Subject's

nother was nobility.

The shooting incident in Lenirgrad during Horld

War Il and his desertion fron the Naval School in Baku

would have played a very negative role in any consideration

of his acceptance into State Security.

Subject never completed high school in the romal

f.

fashion.

Subject was a poor student at the Irstitute of Inter-

national Relations.

h. It should be added that the KGB would definitely

krod that NOSEUKO. was involved in an automobile accident

in 1947 and was interrogated by the Militia (traffic court),

found guilty.

fined.

This would definitely play a

negative role in NOSENKO's admission to the KGS.

NOSENKO would never be allowed to enter the KGB having

just recovered from tuberculosis.*

In fact, there was a rule

at that time that no person who ever had tuberculoss (even

twertyyears earlier) would ke permitted to work in the KGB.

"In addition, after acceptance, the fact that KOBULOV was a

personal friend of subject's father, as he has told us, would

have been noted in the file and would have played a negative role

in permitting Subject to continue to work in State Security after

KOBULOV's arrest in June 1953.

"I asked Subject how he answered some of the questions in the

anketa (entry questionnaire), particularly the questions on his

former wife, her relatives.

and on his mother's ancestry.** I

then asked

subject how it was, taking into account his mother's

aristocratic ancestry, the fact that her father died in jail, the

Trotskyite allegations against Subject's father, the fact that

Subject's former father-in-law (TELEGIN) was still in jail, and

the fact that Supject was present when TELEGIN's apartnent was

searched--that he had been accepted into the kes.

particularly

in 1953 during the confusion and changes after the death of STALIN.

Subject admitted that the question was logical.

and said that he

could only assume that the influence of KOBULOV and the important

and influential position of his own father outweighed these nega-

tive factors.

He also cited his GRU experience in this connectior..

"I then asked Subject how he had reported his second marriage

to the KGB.

He replied that before the marriage he had mentioned

* NOSENKO first meritioned having had tuberculosis during the June

1962 meetings, when he described it as a minor case but said he

He next nertioned

his illness in 1966, describing how he sometimes coughed up a

"glass of blood" at a time: Although DERYABIN's questioning

covered this part of NOSENKO's life in detail, there was no

mention of tuberculosis in July and August 1965.

1t briefly to GORBATENKO, ard that he had unofficially rur. a name

check on his prospective

bride (which was 'clean'),

and that after

the marriage he had filled out another arketa ir. which he included

all the required data on his wife and her relatives. After con-

siderable prompting, Subject said that he tad indicated trat she

and her parerts had been in france, but that he had concealed the

fact that her graranother had been

ir. German-occupied territory

during the war.

He admitted that the KGB would have learned this

in a routine check, however.)

I then reviewed for Subject the

negative security factors mentioned above, adding the arrest of

KOBULOV, the fact that his ned wife and her parents had been

abroad, the fact that her grandmother was in Serman-occupied

territory, the fact that Subject was now over-age for the Komsomol

but not yet a Party member or candidate, and the fact that Subject

received a 15-day sentence for misuse of cover documents and 1r.-

curring venereal disease, and asked if he didn't think that his

personnel file had been reviewed in 1954, and if so, what grounds

there could have been for retaining him in the KGB.

Subject said

that he thought that his file probably was reviered but that

again the influence of his father had

saved him.

Subject added

that another important factor was probably his language qualifi-

cation and particularly his higher educatior.

I pointed out to

Subject that if his second wife and her parents had been abroad

it was impossible that her name check could have been negative.

He admitted it was illogical, but insisted that this was

"NOSENKO 'g. Knowledge of KGB, 1953-54

"Entry Date into KGB: NOSENKO was reminded that he had pre-

viously given varying dates for his entry on duty in the KCB.

replied that he did not remember the exact date, but he was sure

that it was in the middle of March 1953 - perhaps 13 or 15 March

(15 March 1953 was a Sunday).

He would give no explanation for

why he previously claimed to have entered the KGB in

In fact it would be very unusual for a KGB officer to

forget his exact entry-on-duty date to the very day because it

1s used to compute length of service and must be entered on vari-

ous forms from time to time.

"Numerical resignation of the Intelligence and Counterintelli-

gence Directorates in 195j: Agked to describe what directorates

existed in the MVD while BERIYA was Minister (March-June 1953).

NOSENKO named the First Chief Directorate (FCD) and the Second

Chief Directorate (SCD) which he said were the intelligence ard

counterintelligence directorates respectively.

Asked if he were

sure, NOSENKO said he was positive.

and that the only change that

took place was that later, under KAÜGLOV, for a few months only,

the FCD became the SiD, ard vice versa.

NOSENKO stuck to this

even when told he was wrong; he did not say he did not know or

did not rementer. perhaps realizing that he could not claim not

to remember chat directorate he served in.

(Actually, the change

in numerical designations was instituted by BERIYA right after

STALIN's death in March 1953 and persisted until the KGB was

organized in March 1954.

Thus, NOSENtO does not know what the

correct designation of his own directorate was at the time that

he allegedly

ertered on duty with Soviet State Security and for

the entire first year of his alleged service there.

• NOSENKO on other occasions has given various reasons why he

told CIA that he joined the KCB in 1952. See Part V.B.

MVD Leadership, 1953-54: Asked to nare the chiefs of the

and separate departments of the MVD under BERIYA

and KRUGLOV, NOSENKO named nine out of 28.

He was unable to name

the Chief of the Irtolligence Directorate, sajing that he remem-

bered only SAKHAROVSKIY (PANUSHKIN was Chier untii 1955). iiked

to name KRUGLOV's deputies, NOSENKO named Only ROMASHKOV ani

SEROV, and was ignorant of

such prominent deputies as LUNFY ad

SHATALIN.

Told that a Secretary of the Central Committee of ire

OPSU was one of KRUGLOV's deputies at this time (SHATALIN), !OS-

ENKO flatly denied that this was possible.

"Organization of KGS: NOSEIKO did not know when the KGB was

organized (March 1954).

He said that it was in early 1955 or

late 1954.

Iold that he was a year off and asked to think it

over, NOSENKO insisted that he was right.

"Processing Procedures for Employment with KGB: NOSENKO'S

story about how he

was processed for emploiment with the kGB in

1953 is inconsistent with the procedures used at that time.

He

does not know many

of the things that he should know about er-

trance procedures; he is wrong about many of the things that he

claims to remember.

The disparities are so great that they can-

not be explaired

(as NOSEIKO attempts to do)

by the claim that

KOBULOV's recommendation resulted in a simplified entrance pro-

cedure for NOSENkO.

"The most important document fiiled out by prospective em-

ployees of Soviet State Security is a detailed personal history

questionnaire, called in Russian Anketa spets-alnoco naznachentya

sot rudnika KGB.

This exhaustive questionnaire is 16 pages long,

and filling it

out is an experience that one is not likely to

forget.

A background investigation is run on the basis of this

questionnaire, which itself becomes a permanent and prominent

feature of the employee's personnel file.

NOSENKO remembers

filling out a questionnaire, but does not know its designation.

He asserts that it was only 4-6 pages long.

He asserts that he

filled it out at home, and submitted it in two copies shortly

before entering on duty.

Actually, this questionaire was re-

quired in ore copy only, and was never permitted to be taken

home since it was a classified document (even when not filled

in).*

"NOSENKO insists that he did not have to take a medical exam-

ination prior to entering the KGB.

This is not possible.

an examination was a routine and mandatory part of the processing.

I cannot think of any instance in which it wouid be waived.**

DERYABIN's views are based on NOSENKO's statements ir. August

1965.

In his original biographical statement (1962), NOSENKO

said that no anketa was required.

He implied as nuch in his

most recent statement in April 1966, after being questioned

by DERYABIN.. This statement is given in Part V.B.

"NOSENKO's descriptior of the secrecy agreener. that he

signed then entering on duty with, the KGB is corpletely unlike

the agreement that was in use at that time for staft employees.

It may be significant that NOSDily's description os tho secrecy

agreement he recalls signing resenbles che

secrecy afreuments

that were taken from

agents.

"NOSETKO Insists that he did not fill cut iny other forms,

questiornaires, or papers when entering

the KGo.

Actually, there

were

a number of other routine fors that had to be filled out by

applicants and neu employees.

"Location of ROZiaNKO's office: NOSENKO says that all his

entry processing was handled by a personnel officer ramed POZHEN-

KO and his staff.

He asserts that ROZlEYKO's office, which nos-

INKO visited several times in early 1953, as located on the oth

floor, Bth entry, Buildirg No. 12, Dzerzhinskiy Street.

In fact,

neither ROZHENKO nor any officers or units of the Personnel De-

partment were located in the 8th entry.

They were all (ircluding

ROZHENKO) located on the oth and ith floors of the 7th entry of

Buildirg No. 12.*

"Rank Pay: Asked about his salary when he first started to

work in the KGB, NOSENKO said he got a basic salary of 1700 rubles

as a case officer, 500 rubles for hig rank of lieutenant, plus

secrecy, language, and longevity pay. lie insistes that this vas

correct, even

aren told that KGB officers were no longer being

paid for rant

in March 1953, and said that although he remembered

that there was one year--1954--when they were not paid for rank.

he was sure that when he first entered on duty he received this

pay.

Salary for rank was taken aday from State Security officers

in September 1952 ard was not restored until April 1954.

"Promotion to Senior Lieutenant: In giving the chronology

of his promotion to various military ranks, NOSENKO claimed to

have been promoted to senior lieutenant in

April 1953, shortly

after joinirg the KGB.

Told that this was impossible, and that

no one in the KGB was promoted as this time; NOSENKO replied that

he couldn't say about anyone else but he was sure that he had re-

ceived his promotion at that time.

In fact, this is impossible:

all promotions in the KGB were frozen from the time BERIYA took

over as minister (March 1953) until late 1953.

"Visitor's Pass Procedures: In talking about his first visit

to the KGB to process for employment, NOSENKO was unable to re-

call the procedures employed by the KGS Pass Office in issuing

visitor's passes.

Specifically, he maintained that the name of

the interviewer was not indicated on the pass.

In fact.. the

name of the interviewer did appear on the pass and the inter-

viewer had full responsibility for the visitor while he was on

KGB premises.

While it is understardable that NOSeNKo might

have forgotter the details in olved if he had only visited there

a few times more than ten years ago, if he worked at KGB-head-.

quarters for over ten-years-as a staff. officer-and particularly

as a super:isor he would have frequent occasion to admit visitors.

and thus should krow visitor's pass procedures quite vell.

- - -

*NOSENKO has since said that he spoke to no personnel officers

prior to acceptance by the KGB of afterwards, thereby indicating

that his statements to DERYABIN were untrue.

that an officer who served in the KGB at the time could have for-

Asked to describe the sign in front of the KGB

one in 1953) but mentioned that there was a Castronom (food store)

next to the KGB Club.

NOSENKO seems to be unaware that the K.I. has not existed since

and the building at the igri-

cultural Exhibition were one and the same place.

"NOSENKO' 3 Claim to Have Been a Komsomol: Sparetery in the

Second Chief Directorate, KGB

"NOSEriKO claimed to have become a member of the Komsomol

Organization (K/O) of the KGB when he entered on duty in March

1953, to love been elected as Secretary of Komsomol Organization

of the Second Chief Directorate in the fall of 1953, and to have

moved because he used operational-alias documerts in obtaining

treatment for a venereal disease he had incurred.

He claims to

have been excluded from the komsonol, without prejudice, when he

attained his 27th birthday in October 1954.

"Asked to describe how he transferred from the koinsomol organ-

ization of the Naval Intelligence Post in the Baltic to the Kom-

soirol Organization of the KGB, NOSENKO gave an entirely incorrect

description of this procedure, both as regards deregistration from

the K/O in the Baltic, and registration with the k/0 in the KGB.

He stated that he was issued

a new Komsomol registration card by

the KUB K/O, without reference to the previous K/O in the Baltic;

this 1s impossible.

"NOSENKO could not describe the duties of a K/O secretary in a

specific manner.

"NOSENKO did not know who was the secretary of the overall KGB

The secretary of the SCD K/O would

be directly subordinate

to him and would deal with him frequently.

"NOSENKO was unable to describe his dealings with the KGB K/O

or the identities or responsibilities of the people with whom he

dealt there.

"NOSENKO insisted that in 1953-54, the maximum age for a Kom-

somol member was 27.

In actual fact, the maximum age was 26 (it

was raised later).

This point is important, both because NOSENKO

should know exactly if he had served as a K/O secretary, and also

because it refutes

his story that he was excluded from the Kom-

somol for over-age in 1954.

"NOSENKO maintained that all the members of his K/O paid dues

In the amount of 2 percent of their monthly salaries.

Incorrect, as monthly Komsomol dues were calculated on a sliding

scale determined by wage group:

at that time, Komsomol members

earning up to 500 rubles monthly paid 0.5 percert: those earning

500 to 1500 rubles paid 1 percent, and those

earning over 1500

rubles paid 1.5 percent.

The K/O secretary collects the dues,

could not be forgotten. "

Although DERYABIN's direct knowledge of the KGB erded in 1954,

his detailed Information of KGB procedures has been undates with

regara to what NOSENKO has said about KGS procedures, DERYABIN

stated:

"Asked to describe how he conducted name checks on a

Soviet citizen and on a new arrival to the American Embassy in

1953-54, NOSENKO gave a superficial description of how such

checks were done.

However,

he resisted every attempt to get sim

to describe this process in detail, and he made several blunders

which show thât he never actually ran such a check himself.

For

example, he did not know where the records of all Soviet citizens

who have been tried are kept, and he attempted to improvise an

answer (completely wrong) that they would check with the Militia

about this.

NOSENKO correctly said that Archives were located

on Kirov Street, but he was completely unabie to stretch his

limited knowledge to provide a description of now these various

repositories were actually checked.

NOSRUKO was also asked to

describe 1n detaid how he ran such a check on a soviet citizen

in the 1950-59 period.

Here again he was in difficulty and re-

fused even to try.

He did not even know the everyday term Spets-

proverka, which

means a check for clearance.

"It was particularly interesting that he did not feel able to

dispute my challenges of his information, even though he undoubt -

edly knows that I do not have first-hand krowledge of procedures

in this period.

I even tested this on one occasion by asking

NOSENKO the difference between the lst Spets Otdel (Special

Department - KGB cards and files) and the Operati:to-Uchetniy

Ordel (Operational Reports Department - the functional name for

the Ist Special Department).

He answered that the ist Special

Departmert holas the files on Soviet criminal cases rile the

Operational Reports Department is for political and espionage

cases.

It seems he invented this answer on the spot.

In addi-

tion, it is wrong that political and security cards are separate

from criminal cres in the lst Special Department.

They were

In my time and must still be compined in one card file.

"NOSENKO states that he knows nothing about the files of

the First Chief Directorate.

It is unbelievable that in ten

years of service in the Second Chief Directorate NOSENKO never

Raw a First Chief Directorate file; how else would he be able

to check information on toreigners, especially on American Em-

bassy personnel?

The first stage in such a check is an inquiry

to the First Chief Directorate and a check of any files they

may have on the subject.

According to his own account, NOSENKO

Bhould have been doing this type of thing the whole of his ten

years of service, without regard to whether he was assigned-to

the Anerican Department or the Ipurist Department."

mong them, they command an extensive knowledge of

the Soviet Intelligence Services,

and they have had a variety

of agent- and defector-handling experience.

NOSENKO was talked to and questioned in several

types of

circunstances:

- In five tightly organized meetings in 1962 in

Geneva with limited time available for each of a wide

- In concentrated but somewhat longer meetings in

to put pressure on NOSENKO or express doubts about his

- Under

April 1964 and January-March 1965).

- In extended, detailed debriefing sessions which

NOSENKO could not evade

(May-November 1964, May 1965,

July-August 1965, and Oçtober 1966).

Thus there were

opportunitiep to note his performance and reac-

tions under varied degrees of stress and control.

The features of NOSENKQ's conduct, manner, and techniques

discussed below are

confined

to those which were clearly and con-

sistently observed by all of the officers involved.

b. NOSENKO's Conduct in Meetingg

NOSENKO in brief, super-icial,

uncritical debriefings (of

the sort which characterized the 1962 and 1964 Geneva meetings

and the debriefings. prior to 4 April 1964) was reasonabig con-

vincing in his manner.

For example, on the basis of the hur-

ried sessions of June

1962 in Geneva, which did not allow tire

for systenatic or detailed questioning, the CIA case officer

in commenting on NOSENKO's conduct mentioned "the ease of his

manner, the sureness of his knowledge of matters which

have known, and the amount of checkable information he provided."

NOSENKO seemed to that case officer to be "under little or no

restraint as to the amount and nature of what he told us

"made a convincing and good

personal impression: a vigorors.

temperamental and vital man."

Similarly, nothing in NOSENKO's

manner caused doubts on

the

part of the FBI represertatives who

took NOSENKO's reports in February, March, and early April 1964.

It became apparent, howver, when the cases ROSENKO had

mentioned briefly in early meetirgs were taken up in detail in

leisurcly debriefings after the defection, that he could not add

facts corsistent with what he had

said before.

He was unable to

recall related incidents or additional circunstances which did

not come to mind in the first telling, despite being ardes by

questioning from different angles or

in different coatexts.

sae results were obtained in exhausting his store of operational

leads (with a half dozen exceptions) and his information on KGB

procedures,

installations, and operational methods:

Having once

reported on these general topics, NOSENKO could offer nothing

more when debriefed again, regardless of the

method of question-

ing tried.

Repeatedly he used the same stories to illustrate

his points; new stories did not emerge.

In a period of nine

months, NOSENKO was drained of information on nis persona and

professional experiences

and knowleage.,

Never befere had the

SIA case officers encounteres a defector who

was totally de-

A technique NOSENKO has frequently used to explain his in-

ability to supply details and to forestall further questicring

has been to claim poor memory.

"Different people have different

types of memories," he has said on many occasions, or on others:

I have told what I remember."

The case officers who have

handled NOSENKO agree, on the other hand, that he has an excel-

lent memory,

although perhaps a peculiar one:

NOSENKO dia not

always recall most easily those events which had occurred most

recently, or those incidents which were most closely related to

him.

He was able, for

to remember detailed information

on the penetration of the Courier Transier Station in Paris and

to give a long, detailed, and ordered account of the compromise

of PENKOVSKIY,

in neither of which he claimed ary personal role:

he has been

able to name hundreds of KGB officers, to gi:e the

dates on

of them transferred from one corponent of

the Second Chief

Directorate to another, and to describe their

Yet NOSENKO forgot there

he himself served in the GRU; he could not consistently dis-

cribe the circumstances of his divorce; he failed to provide a

consistent date for his entry into the KGB and for his transfer

from the American Department to the Tourist Department in 1962.

Likewise, NOSENKO remembered details of KGB operations which,

like the

"ANDREY" case in 1953, took place in the relatively

dis-

tant past, but he could not recall the travels, friends, and

activities of his own target. john V. ABIÜN or details of opera-

tions against many American code clerks in 1960 and 1961.

These limitations of knowiedge ard quirks of memory were

evident rot

only during meetings when HOSENKO was being desriesed.

Irey were also apparent in the interrogacions which supplanted

the debriefings.

c.

NOSENKO's Behavior Under Interrogation

(1) Introduction

In the many and long interrogation sessions there emerged

habits of behavior noticeable to each of the CiA officers present.

Trese characteristics of NOSENKO were his manner of recourting

events and his evasiveness, inprovisaiions, ard other defersive

tenniques. They are reviered belok.

(il) Manner of Recounting Brents

Typical of NOSENKO's performance in the interrogations vere

the following points:

- Talking about operatiors he supeivised ard about his per-

the KSB Headquarters aspects

of other operations,

NOSENKO habitually used the passive voice ("'it was decided") or

irdicated that he was not alore in these activities ("there was

по

ascourting on who was working on any cose cierx case--it was

GRYAZNOV, KOSCLAPOY, NOSENKO, and also working kas KLYPIN, GRIBAN-

nie made the decision--I and KOVSHUK and GRYAZNOV.

"or "I

when asked where a par-

ticular conversation

rarely located it in his own

office ('I was

in KOVSHUK's offlie wher KOSLOV sailed him about

the trip" or "I was Ir KLYPIN's office ard he was

calkirg to

KOVSHUK:").

"he said to me," etc.!, but it was in just such matters that

NOSENKO most often contradicted himself le,g.. his relatiorship

with GRIBANOV and his part in the recruitrent approach to the

American code clerk James STORSBERGI.

- In repeating certain stories (the CHEREPANOV case and the

provocation against Professor Frederick BARGHOCFN are examples!

NOSENKO gave them in precisely the same order, without addition

presented the

facts each time in nearly idertical order.

for more details on these cases, he irvarlably insisted--often

with triitation--that he knew rothing more ard if he did, he

would have reported it.

Other factors contributed to the su-

pression that in such instances NOSENKO had delivered his infor-

nation

by rote:

Statements like "I don't remember what I told

you before" when queried agair. on a particular case; detachment

and a lack of emotion when describing the compromise of soviets.

who, like himself, had cooperated wich American Iatelligence:

POPOV, PENKOVSKIY, and CHEREPAVOV: an irability to correlate

dates and events in different operations which he said he was

handling

such as conflicts in the timirg of his approach to

X.E. JOHNSON and in the date he gave for johr. V. AIDIAN's visit

to the Pushkin Street dead drop, and conflict betteen the dates

of his participation in the MCRONE case and his travel co Cuba).

- NOSENKO, with a few excuptions (notably the compromise of

PENKOVSKIY and

the ASIDIAN visir: to the dead drop site), could

not supply specific or approxiate dates for operational activi-

ties during the period of his

service in the U.S. Imbassy Section.

Beyond recourse to the phrase "1960, 1961," he refused to estimate

the dates or to associate these

activities with the time of the

year or events in his personal life.

(111) Evasion, Improvisation, and Other Defenses

In the debriefings before the interrogations, ROSENKO avoided

questions and topics not of his own choosing, saying that he would

give full details "later," when systematic debriefing began.

when the question or topic came up anew in a later debriefing.

re would plead fatigue or boredom and propose:

we drink; tomorrow we work."

Prior to d April 1964 he provided

only accounts of operations selected by himself; it was only

after 4 April 1964 that he could be, constrained to reply to de-

tailed questioning on other matters.

From that point on, other evasive tactics became familiar

to his

interrogators.

He would try to change the

subject or

to shift from the specific event to a generalized account of how

such things were done in principle.

He would claim bad memory

on grounds that, for example, operations against U.S. Embassy

personnel were hopeless and

useless anyway.

lie would dismiss the

details

or the entire operation

as unimportant (for example, the

microphones in the U.S. Embassy).

He would set out reasons

for

his ignorance of things he admittedly should have known (his own

"poor performance,"

preoccupation with other matters, inattention

to duty, absence fron the KGB while on vacation, lack of time to

master details because he was a supervisor).

Unable to name or

talk about KGB indigenous agents working against Americans, in-

clusing those in operations under his supervision, NOSENKO

disparaged the quality of, such

agents ("they never reported any-

thing of interest on anyone"); he cited their low educational

level and their inferior status as servants and employees as

one reason none of them could give the KGB operationally useful

information.

In fact; the record of many indicated previous em-

ployment which would demand at least the equivalent of a college

degree or certificate from a technical institute.

Numerous maids

were former school teachers, one was formerly a chemist.

When evasion failed, it seemed to the interrogators that

NOSENKO improvised his answers.

Some of these evident improvisa-

tions led him into unacceptabie statements or positions.

To use

his response. to the questioning

on John V. ABIDIAN as an example:

Not knowing about ABIDIAN's car,

he said the KGB could not get

at it.

In fact, the car was held by. Soviet customs

for two

weeks, and later NOSENKO himself spoke about the way the KGB used

Embassy chauffeurs

for access to cars.)

Not knowing

of ABIDIAN'S

trips out of the USSR, he claimed that the

kGB had no way to

find out where Embassy officers went when they made trips out of

the country.

(In fact, ABIDIAN had told his language teacher

each time

and she, as NOSENKO said, was a KGB agent; al3o,

ABIDIAN

arranged his trips by long-distance phone from Moscow to his des-

tination abroad, and the KGB can cover such calls.)

Not knowing

of ABIDIAN's trip within the USSR, he

spoke of a vacation which

he latter admitted to be false.

Asked why he did not know personal

KOVSHUk did havo a copy in his

which didn't list AbIDIA'i."

Under pressure about ABIDIAN's visit

to Pushkin Strcet, NOSENIO said the XGB thought that ABIDIAN maY

As another example, when he

NOSE:IKO labeled it as such

Later, when the name was men-

tioned again, he asxed:

"Who's BLAKE?"

On other occasions, when his self-contradictiong were pointed

out or when he admitted ignorance of matters ha acinowledge he

should have known, NOSENKO would fall back upon che of the follow-

ing lines of defense:

- "What I know I tell you;

what I remember I tell

you, " or "I don't know," "I car't explain," ... or a shiug.

- The details, even if corfused or contradictory, are

not important.

He repeatedly urged that his interrogators check

an independent penriration of the KGB--there it would

verify that his name is registered as the case officer who

opened, held ard turned over the ABIDIAN file and thus that

he was a KGB officer.*

NOSENKO referred to this method of corroborating him at least

20 times during the interrogations of January-larch 1965.

on 1 February 1965 that "maybe the day will come when you have

& source to check and you will find out" (that he was ABIDIAN's

case officer). Later in the same interrogation session, he added:

"I see how poor and miserable I'm looking with ragard to ABIDIAN's

filc, but anyore who can check in (KGB) Archives will see."

On

Or. l6 February he

said:

"Tine

In one hour to a check via such a source.

He repeatedly stated

that "time will show" that he is not a provocateur.

At one point

he engaged in the following dialogue with his interrogators:

NOSENKO:

That e'll nagyou that, is you check, you'll find

INTERROGATOR:

He're not disputing that you worked for the kGB.

We're disputing that you held the positions you

say you held in the kGB.

would find that I was only in these two departrents

and only in these positions...

(later in the session)

NOSENKO:

NOSENKO:

Maybe you can check

HOSENKO:

Yes, but maybe your acquaintances can check with

someone, because anyone in the kGB should know

that, yes, there was a liOSENKO.

INTERROGATOR: Should we ask someone like VAKHRUSHEV OF SUSLOV?

because I gave you their rames.

NOSENKO:

sure.

d. Additional Observations

(1) Inquisitiveress About CIA

NOSENKO's questions about CIA and its activities seemed to his

interrogators

to be beyond the interest or curiosity expected of

Soviet Intelligence defectors.

Frequently

he asked, even while

discussing his own KGB responsibilities:

"You tell me about a case.

and I will remember details.

Other examples of NOSENKO's inquisi-

tiveness--include-the-following:-

- When shown the CIA publication "Checklist of Soviet

Officials Abroad during the 1964 meetings in Geneva, NOSENKO

made inquiries about what organization prepared "t and to what

part of the U.S. Government that organization is subordinate.

## Page 30

TOP SECHEl

631.

- In January 1964, entirely out of context, he asked

whether

(He was not able to explain in

later questioning why he had not informed CIA about the case

before he made the foregoing inguiry.)

- NOSENKO asked precisely how American Intelligence col-

lection in the USSR is directed and coordinated.

The CIA case

officer responded:

"What was thut question?"

NOSENKO there-

upon said:

"It was not a question--just general interest."

When the case officer urged him to repeat the question, he re-

talk about it and diverted the conversation to other

matters.

- He asked where CIA secretaries resided in the Washing-

ton area.

- NOSENKO tried to find out the grades of the CIA offi-

cers in contact with him.

- NOSENKO inquired in early 1964 whether the CIA offi-

cer who met him in Gereva two years earlier had received a

medal for that phase of the operation.

(li) Acceptance of Contrary Information from Other sources

Inder Interrogation.

even when

accused of lying, NOSENKO

challenged the validity of CIN's information

nor claimed

superior knowledge. The only facts he challenged strongly were

Incontestably true, such as the date of GOLITSYN's defection, the

of ABIDIAN's visit to the Pushkin Street dead drop, KOSO-

LAPOV's travel separate from JENNER, and KOSOLAPOV's November 1960

trip to Helsinki.

times that he accepted that

CIA knew more than he did on tovics including conditions in the

OSSR and cases and people for whon he clained direct responsibility.

He never challenged DERIABIN's statements about KGB procedures,

although aware that his own information was more recert.

(e) Discussions with NOSENKO On His Own Performance

After admitting his inability to respond to questions about

operations

in which he said he participated, NOSENKO sometimes

gave a general appraisal of his own performance.

He would admit

that it was

"impossible to have such memory breaks" and agree

that his response was neither reasonable nor acceptable ("In your

place I wouldn't believe it either," or on another occasion,

"It

will look bad to your boss"). Admitting that the guestions

were

fair, logical, and clearly put, he acknowledged at least a dozen

• times during

the January-March 1965 interrogation that his per-

formance under questioning was bad and unacceptable.

He also admitted that most of the leads he had passed were

largely useless.

Out of the 150-or-so-he-said he had provided.

he stated that the great majority were

"no good,"

unimportant, or

people with wron the KGB had not worked ("Maybe

'ANDREY' became

not interesting to KGB, changed jobs, and was not so important any

"some of the agents recruited by the Seventh Department

weren't meeting the KGB": ets.)

He consistently estimated, how-

ever, that there were about 20 to 25 "good" leads.

2. Test In October 1965 on Lee Harvey OSWALD

a. Introduction

CIA conducted i

polygraph examination of NOSENXO on

18 October 1956 on

ise subject of Lee Harvey OSWALD.*

Since the previous polygraph test in April 1964, NOSENKO

had been under close security guard, his novenents restricted,

and in the interin had been interrogated in detail and accused

of bad faith in dealing with U.S. Government authorities.

NOSENKO had not been

interviewed by ClA during the six nonths

prior to October 1966.

He had had no access to alcohol or

drugs, his food consumption had been normal, ard his sleep

had been adequate.

NOSENKO was given no advance notice of the polygraph

examination.

Upon entering the room where it was to take

place, he immediately recognized the officer present as the

person who administered the first CIA polygraph test two and

one-half years earlier.

NOSENKO correctly

said that they had

first met on 4 April 1964.

In the pre-test interview, questions on the OSWALD case

were put to NOSENKO in Russian, his answers (also in Rusylan)

were recorded, the operation of the machine was explained,

and clarifications of the questions ard his answers were

nade.

NOSENKO'S BONA PIDES: ANALYSIS ÄND CONCLUSIONS

Introduction

It is standard prosedure to assess the bona fides of each

intelligence and counterirtelligence source, and special care is

required in

assessing

sources of infomation

relevant to the secu-

rity of the United States.

A much more prominent factor in this assessment, however.

is NOSENKO's om testimony.

CIA has exhaustively debriefed and

interrogated NOSENKO, his leads were checked, his information was

studied, and a large body of facts pertinent to his bona fides

dag thus assembled.

These details, as well as direct eviderce

from other sources and the views

of specialists affiliated with

CIA, have been presented in Part IIi. through. Part VII. of this

paper.

Tre basic questions with regard to the bona fides of

NOSENKO are the following:

- Is there reason to question the gereral accuracy

sill completeness of NOSENKO's accounts of his situation

and motivations in contactirg CIA and later defecting,

his personal life, military service, positions in the

KGB, personal participation in KGB operations, know-

ledgeabirity

about KGB

activities and the way he learned

of then, and his associations with KGB personnel?

- If there are grounds for doubting the general

accuracy and completeness of these accounts, then what

are the explanations for NOSENKO's actions,

for the

nature of the information he has provided, and for

other Soviet sources having authenticated his personal

In assessing the bona fides of NOSEVKO, the classic method

has been used: evaluating his production and sourcirg, examining

his autobiography, and appraisirg him and the circumstances of

this operation.

These points, "it? the conclusions dramn from

each, are reviered belor.

The ciscussion continues with a survey

of the sources who have corroborated NOSENKO'S background and

status, and this is followed by argurertations on the various

hypotheses which could explain NOSEVKO as a source.

The final

portion is a summary of conclusions about NOSENKO's bona fides.

B. Evaluation of Production

Introduction

There are several standards which may be applied to the assess-

ment of a source's production.

Each of them is qualified; none 19

likely to be conclusive by itself; and all of them tugelher may ros

permit a definite conclusion, although they do contribute to a

broader assessmert of bona fides. The standards are:

First, how does the information

At the same time, current inforration

organization of an

service is of classic interest to

opposirg intelliger.ce ard security services.. Organizational

changes are irdicators of policy and planning trends in the ser-

vice; short of a penetration of the service's leadership, such

changes are perhaps tre

most reliable reflection of changes in

operational exphasis and tactics.

Had NOSENKO's information on the organization of the KGB

been novel in this sense, it would have been of corsiderable

value, while the exposure of this intomation--although perhaps

riot a

major loss to the Soviets--would nonetheless nave been

against the KGb's best interests.

RiOSENKO's reports on

the

organization of the. KGB in 1964

(Pages 352-358)

agree with and

are a logical extersion of that framerork of KGB organization

newly revealed by the 1961 sources.

but this weighs reither for

nor against him as the source:

In the absence of contradictory

information, he cannot be subject to criticism or to suspicion

becaise his reports

show no redirection of the thrust of the

KGB.

Furtnermore, NOSEKO's staterents indicating that there

have been no major changes in the

years between the 1959 re-

organization and 1964 are asseptabie in the light of available

information from other sources.

rhe information which nostro

provided on

the KGB's organization therefore neither supports

nor discredits his bona fides.

NOSENKO's information oi some 1,000 Soviets connected with

Intelligence and security activities

is an impressive achieve-

ment of memory.

must be evalu-

ated according to the damage inflicted upon the Soviets by his

exposure of these personalities.

In this respect, the discus-

sion must concern ned identifications, for intelligence person-

alities previously exposed could not be danaged any further by

a repetition of their compromise.

This discussion must be fur-

ther restricted to new identificationg of staff persowel, be-

cause

the entire soviet population is available to the KGB for

occasional use

as it

sees fit, with the loyalty and discretion

of the individual as the only limiting factors; to learn that a

Soviet employed at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow is an agent re-

porting to the KCB is to learn nothing that has not already

been taken

for granted, and besides,

no action or such infor-

mation can be taken.

HOSENKo's intelligence personality Identifications

do not constitute a factor in finding for or açainst his bona fides.

NOSEiKO has been the source of any interesting details and

examples of KGB noius operardi (Pages 359-340), but while useful

for illistrative purposes and valuable because of the fact that

the material nas easily coliatable for study purposes, none of

the methods described could be corsidered

their exposure in any

event would rot prevent their cortinued use

in the future.

POSENKO's discussior. of tre orly double agent case

NOSENKD has shown himself to be both uninformed and inaccurate

Thus, information on thr more up-to-date forms, co-

ordination requirements, mechanization of records and tracing

mechanisms, etc., could have been a singular contribution

to our

knowledge; NOSENKO could not describe anything of this

sort.

reporting is available

(based on not having been a KGB Headquarters officer.

3. Operational Leads

a. Introduction

Consideration of NOSENKO's operational leads must take into

account the KGB positions and personal associations (with attendant

access to informarion) which NoStrO has claimed for himself.

Indicated lial the breadth of hig knonledge about KGB agent opera-

tions and development cases increased as he rose from case officer

in the U.S. Embassy Section

in 1953-1955 and in the Arerican lourist

Section in 1955-1958 to become Deputy Chies of the latter section

in 1958-1959, Deputy Chief of the U.S. Embassy Section in 1960-1961,

and finally Deputy Chief of the Tourist Department from 1962 until

his defection.

Simultaneously he established lasting contacts with

his KGB colleagues so that, for example, even after leaving the

U.S. Embassy Section for the second time, in December 1961, NOSENKO

kept abreast of its most important activities.

On these grounds

NOSENKO presented himself as

an authoritative source, one who

could detail the

successes and failures of the KGB in recruiting

Westerners--especially Americans--in the USSR over the years from

1953 through 1963.

Repeatedly NOSENKO asserted that his leads to

KGB agents constituted proof of his bona fides.

b. Operations Involving Americars

NOSENY drew a picture of the recruitment scene in Moscow

showing that:

- Since the "ANDREY" case of the early 1950's* the KGB

recruited no Americans on the U.S. Embassy staff, succeed-

ing only in recruiting one contract employee who was in

NOSINKO reported on recruitment approaches

the case officer.

- The rumber of American visitors recruited by the KG3

in 1962-1963 was 14, and if there had been others, NOSENKO

would have known about them in light of his senior position

in the Tourist Department during that period.

Moreover.

for

the jears before 1962, NOSF'KO provided leads to 19 other

Imerican tourists whom the KGB recruitea, plus ore who was

serving the GRU when he came to Moscow.

MOSENKO also de-

scribed 18 development cases ard nine

irvestigations in

which the targets were American tourists.

As for KGB operations outside tre Soviet Union, NOSENKO gave leaás

to four recruited Americars about whom he learned through corver-

sations with KGB associates:

a U.S.

intelligerce officer having

the XGB cryptonym "SASHA" (stall unidentified), a penstration of

Orly Courier Transfer Station (idertified as Sergeant Robert Lee

and two

agents in Ger.eva (naines rot given and as yet ret

positively identified):

an American tourist with whose

In addition, NOSEYKO de-

scribed two development cases with U,S, citizens.

Fron his know-

ledge of the "SASHA" operation, NOSENKO also knew that the KGB

had no ager.t sources able to supply irformation concerning the

Cuban missile crisis of October 1962.

(i) Completeness, Accuracy Detail and Consistency of Reporting

If he occupied the various KGB positions as claimed, if his

access were as broad as he said it was, NOSENKO has provided a

co..prehensite. review of KGB operations involving Americans in

the USSR.

Other information, towever, contradicts NOSENKO's assurances

on all major

cases involving Americans working

at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow:

- GOLITSYN's reports indicate that a U.S. military code

clerk was recruited in 1960.

and other factors point toward

this person being Janes STORSBERG or possibly willian HURLEY

(Pages 166-182).

against Embassy code clerks in 1960-1961, stated that

Both agree the approsch was made in the latter part

of 1961.

- GOLITSYN's reports cover six other operations (Pages

595-598) which NOSEiKO has rot mentioned:

The KGS's recruit-

ment of a female employee at the Enbassy in 1957, the pre-

sence of a code clerk in the ambassy in 1960 who was a Kes

agent, an unsuccessful recruitment approach to a female sec-

retary at the Enbassy prior to July 1960, the KGB plan to

complete the recruitment of an anericar diplomat following

his rsassignment from Moscow in 1959, the KGB's recruitmert

the last of these cases; see beiow.)

On the basis of available information, NOSENKO cannot be

faulted on the completeness of his reporting about American tour-

ists recruited, approached, and under development by the KGB, but

he could cite only one instance of KüB investigations uncovering

In addition, a number of Americans--e.g., Walter RASK, Adam

BROCHES, Herry APISSON, Herbert HOlARD,

Vasiliy VOLKOV, william

WILLACE, Thomas Whitney, and Stanley ZIRING--denied having been

recruited by the KGB, as NOSENKO said they had been.

The only noteworthy internal inconsistencies in NOSEYKO's

reporting on KGB operations involving Americans appear in the

HARISTONE case, where he has given conflicting information on the

KGB's ability to obtain photographic evidence of his homosexuality,

and in his advice on how to identify "AIDREY"--that he was the only

witness to testify in Roy RieDaS'

trial and that he did not testify

at Roy RHODES! trial but was only interviewid in the pre-trial in-

vestigation once.

Part VIII.U. covers the extent of his knowledge

about American cases in which

he took part persorally or as a

supervisor.

Regarding others to which his official positions did

not give him access, NOSENKO has indicated that it was his per-

sonal

contact with KGB colleagues which

enabled him to report on

nine recruitments (Hersert HOWARD, Sam AFFE, the KGS agent in

France.

the YOUNGER couple, "SASHA"; and two unnamed agents in

Geneval, three development

cases (George VAN LAETHEM, Attorney

General Robert KENNEDY,

and Stephen HOFFMAN) : three unsuccessful

recruitment approaches (Richard HARNSTONE, Peter BINDER, and

Collette SCHWARZENBACi); and three investigations (Thomas BARTHE-

LEMY, LEWiS BO.IN, and George WINTERS) .

NOSEiNO's alleged asso-

ciates in the ngs thus gave him the names of four recruited agents

and sufficient details for one more to be identified by subsequent

investigation, JOiSON.

All of the NOSENKO leads to developmental

operations, unsuccessful recruitment approaches, and investigations

have been identified.

(11) Damage to the Soviets

Three criteria can be used in assessing the harm to Soviet

Interests caused by NOSENKO's operational leads to Americans:

First, the originality of nis information on recruited

agents and unsuccessful recruitment approaches;

Second, the agents' access to classified information

at the time

he reported on them; and

Ieceivad from other sources.

the pages balto or entifying chen net atala

There is no reason to believe that NOSENKO's information on 22

Americang under investigation while in the USSR could have damaged

the KGB, especially since all of them had left the Soviet Union

before the NOSENKO leads were received (Pages 402-410).

In an-

-other-category,-NOSANKO's leads. to.35.Americans under_development

(Pages 379-397), there is no means for evaluating their impor-

tance to the KGB because it is impossible to estimate with con-

fidence the likelihood of the KGB recruiting some or any of these

targets; vulnerability and assessment data, when coupled with

spasmodic of

even continuing KGB access to the target, would be

no guarantee

that he is recruitable.

Nevertheless,

following

the criteria listed above, NOSE.XO's statements on KGB operation-

al interest stemming from their homosexuality did bring about the

recall of Robert ARMSTRONG and Stephen HOFFMAN from the U.S.

Embassy in Moscow.

NOSINKO was the first source to report on the KGS recruit-

ments of 22 tourists inone with access to classified materials

and on 11 of whom there was previous derogatory information):

four correspondents lone said by NOSiixO to have become inacti:e

and

on two

of whom there was previous derogatory informationi:

the American Express Company representative in Mossor; a contrari.

employee of USIA who had earlier declared his intent to marry a

Soviet national; and two agents whose names were not known to

NOSENKO but who were identifiable.

The latter two agents were:

- Doyle W. SMITH (KGB cryptonym "ANDREY"), a cipher

machine rechanic at the U.S. Embassy in doscow recruited in

ly supplying valuable information in June 1962. SMITH lost

his access to classifled information through retirement from

the U.S. Army on 30 November 1961, or about six months before

NOSENKO first reported on him (Pages 413-426).

- U.S. Army Sergeant Robert Lee JOHNSCH, who with his

wife Hedwig began collaborating with the KGB in 1952 and

who made James MINTKENBAUGH an agent of the KGB in 1953

(Pages 427-462).

Hedwig JOiNSUN discontinued her role in

the operation in 1953, although thereatter remaining know-

ledgeable of the KGB activities of her husband and MINTKEN-

BAUGH; according to MINTKENBAUGH, who lost access to classi-

fled information in 1954, he had no direct contact with the

KGB after the late summer or early autumn of 1953 (about

three to five months before NOSENKO first gave the lead on

JOHNSON) & JOHNSON was still on active duty with the U.s.

Army and in contact with the KGB when NOSEIKO reported in

January 1964 about the existence of this agent.

Thus from a total of 30 original and identifiable leads, only one

agent had access to classified information as of the date when

NOSENKO's reporting on him began.

By the criteria given in the

preceeding paragraph, the single

operational lead from NOSENKO

which_could have damaged Soviet interests was that which un-

covered JOHNSON.

It is debatable, however, whether the JOHNSO!! lead consti-

tuted a serious loss to the KGB.

In the first place.

if JOhNSON

can be believed, he gave the Soviets but one classified document

while in charge

of the "Classified Control Center" at Camp Des

Loges between August 1963 and May 1964.

His KGB case officer

later told him, JOHNSO: said, that the information he could pro-

vide was not worth the risk involved and that no future attempts

of this sort should be made.

JOHNSON also stated that he felt

his espionage work at Camp Des Loges had not been very profitable

for the Soviets,

adding that his case officer had shown dis-

interest in his proposal to obtain for the KGe a top secret

document he (JOHNSON) thought of greater importance than any

other to which he had access.

(NOSENKO indicated that JOHNSON

10st his

access in the spring of 1963, while at the orly courier

Transfer

Station.)

In the second place, as the KGB knew, the

behavior

of liedwig JOHNSON, a mental case, was unpredictable.

Finally,

regarded the KGB's instructions to compartment their activitles

threesome is difficult handling problems. Given these apparent

factors, the NOSEliO lead may have been

considered expencable by

the KGB, without jung-lasting adverse effect on che fulfillrent

of its overall intelligence requirements.

ROSELiKO was the first source to identify Janes STORSBEFG, a

U.S. military code clerk stationed at the Moscow Embassy, as a

target who had rejected the KGB's recruitment offer (Pages 165-

The inforration was received from NOSENKO after STORSBERG

discharged from the U.s. Army,

and when interricted on the

basis of this information,

STORSBERG generally confired NCSENKO's

reporting on the case.

GORITSYN had carlier reportes on what nay

have been the same iGB oparation, but SOLITSY. i believed the mili-

tary cose clerk had been recruited; from what GOLITS!N had pre-

viously told ClA and from later investigations, it seens possible

that

the KGB recruited either STOMSBERG or Wililam HURiEY (who

NOSENKO said was rut recruited or approached by tre 1G3). If it

is assumed that STORSBERG was not recruited in the approach de-

scribed by NOSENKO and in the operation discussed by GOLITSYN,

the KGB

suffered no loss in the American services learring

of

this case.

If it

is assumed on the other hand that STORSBERG Or

HURLEY was recruited,

the reporting by noseuro assisies the KGB--

not the Aterican

services--by deflecting security investigations

from a recruited agent of the KGB.

•(iii) Importance or Usefulness

The American leads from NOSENKD enabled U.S. security author -

ities to:

- Confirm previous information on the recruitsents of

13 tourists and three correspondeats;

- Verify previous derogatory infommation on lil tourists,

two correspondents, and perhaps ore military code clerk,

STORSBERG;

- Remove two homosexuals from the U.S. Embassy in

Moscow; and

- Identify 32 KGB agents including Hedwig JOHNSON and

MINTKENBAUGi. *

One or possibly tao of these 32 agents (SMITH and possibly HOliARD)

past had been in a position to pass classified information

to the KGB, and a third (JOHNSON) had current access to classified

information and current contact with the KGB; the two honosexuals

at the Moscow Embassy (APMSTRONG and HOFFMAN) presurably also had

access to classified infornation.

From the stanapoint of pro-.

tecting_the_security of the U.S:

Government, NOSENKO brought to

an end the JOliNSON operation and the KGB's potential™

for recruit

ing ARMSTRONG and HOFFMAN.

Against this product of NOSENKO's reporting must be balanced

the amourts

of money and manpower that were needed for u.s. secu-

city authorities to exhaust and investigate NOSENKO's infornation

on

19 recruitments, 35 developmental targets, seven ursuccesstul

recruitment approaches, ard 33 investigations by the iGB--a total

of 113 operational leads.

and interrogation of NOSEiKO on these cases, but the investigative

work in the United States was acconpliched mostly by other

agencies.

It would seen, however, that the JOHNSOy operation

was the only MOSLiKO lead to be important or useful.

(2v) Remarks

Judged by his major inaccuracies and by the demonstrable in-

completeress in some

of his reporting, loSiNKO is not an authori-

tative or reliable

source of information on operations against

Americans by the U.S. ¿massy Section and the inerican

untrustworthy in other categories of operational

ileacs, there is no reason to accept at face value NOSENKO's state-

ment that smith was the only Moscow smoussy enficyce working with

"the KGB from 1953 through 1063; indeed, evicence to the contrary

exists.

The

same maj te true

regarding Anericar courists and

correspondents

in Moscow, i.e., other recruitments not mentioned

by NOSENKO could have occurred. Purchermore, wich the question-

able exception of the JOHNSGY case, the KGB lost nothing of great

value in consequence of NOSENKo's leads but garred an advantage

by occupyirg the

attention and facilities of Auerican security

authorities.

It is therefore concluded that NOSENKO has withhold infor-

mation on recruitrents of Anericans in lioscow,

or he is unable to

provide a comprehensive review of such activities because he did

not hold the claireá positions in the U.S. Encassy and American

Tourist Sections.

Either explanation forces strong reservations

fides of NOSENKO as a genuine scurce, and these

reinforced by the relative costs to the KGB and

U.S. security authorities

of the NOSESKo leads.. By itself, this

evaluation of his production on American cases

suggests the possi

bility that the KGB dispatched NOSENKO to report to CIA, and that

the KGB did so for tre purpose of misleading the U.S. security

Less were well en their way to identifying the source of the

Admiralty documents identifled by GOLITSYN, having narrowed

their list of suspects to 20 (including VASSALI) by 11 June 1962.

When they received the fragment of NOSENKO information which

focused

on the british Elbassy in Moscow, the nunter was reduced

to VASSALL and one other.

Although

the NOSENKO information

apparently confirned the already solid suspicions of vASSALL,

there is rescate believe that the identification would have

been accomplished without this information.

The

lead was there-

fore not ner or exclusive information, and NOSENKO himself ad-

mitted in 1964 that he krew that GOLITSYN had knom of the case

from the latter's work in the information (Reports) Department.

not be evaluated on the basis of completeness because he

has made

no claim to full

access to such information or to positiong

which

would have given

him better access. Except for tiose he said he

was informed of in connection with possibie use against U.S.

embassy targets, he has usually sourced such third-national

leads as he did have to particularly close relations with the

responsible case officer.

It would not be valid to argue that

a source of

one lead should have told him of others, or that he

should have had more close friends in the KGB.

Thus on all

the NOSEiKO leads to operations against

able to explain why he would need this list to know the locations

of the microphores when he had been daily receiving, selecting,

and distributing the product of all of them for two years.

1larly, it was never clear why NOSENKO did not remember in 1962

that there were eleven points--as the list showed--rather than

the four-to-aix NOSENXO reported on in 1962.

NOSEXO's account of how the product from the microphones was

distributed and exploited would inevitably mean that all KGB case

officers who had served in the U.S. Embassy Section sirce the

microphones were installed would know of their existene: -despite

any effort to paraphrase and disguise the product as "agent re-

ports."

NOSENKO noretheless maintalned in 1962 that "it is a

tremendous secret that le are listening to you," ard that che

microphones were known to so few that any countermeasures the

Americans might take on the basis of NOSaNKO's statements could

reflect dangernusly a him as the source.*

Accepting at face value NOSENKO's claimed lack of aptitude

and interest in technical matters, and therefore nis inability

To provide

specific technical details concerning electronic oper-

ations against the American Embassy, it is still noteworthy that:

- NOSENKO did not know the purpose of the so-called

- Although he claimed to have personally pa-ticipated

North Hing at the time of its, renovation for occupancy

- NOSENKO knew nothing of the general lines of research

and developmeat to substitute for or improve the fading

microphone coverage of the U.S. Embassy.

These three points relate to aspects of the KGE's audio-technical

attack on the U.S. Embassy in which the reporting of a source in

NOSENKO's claimed position, no matter what his technical aptitude.

could have been detrirental to Soviet interests.

That they both knew of ut were

NOSENKO's sourcing of his information on electronie opera-

His knowledge of the location and production of these microphones,

as well as the existence,

nature, and purpose of other electronic

his alleged position in the U.S. Embassy Section ard his particu-

lar responsibility for audio sperations.

For these reasons

5. The BELITSKIY Case

8. Introduer son

NOSENKO reported to CiA in June 1962 las one of the two items

he wanted to sell) that he of its agents, the Soviet interpreter

BELITSKIY,

was in fact a KGB double agent who had been planted on

CIA (Pages 517-529) •

NOSENKO said that this was a case run by the

Second

("Active Line") Section, but that he personally had a role

in the management of the case in May 1962 in Ceneva.

NOSENKO was

able to give certain inside information on this case; for example.

he knew the nicknames ustd by the ClA case officers with the agent.

b. Discussion

NOSENKO's information, at least in its general outlines, was

correct.

CIA had been running BELITSKIY as an agent, and the CIA

case officers (alias "Bob" ard "Henry," the latter from Washington

aS NOSEiKO said nad just completed a series of meetings with

BELITSKIY in rieneva.

Important aspects of his information were

inaccurate:

BELITSKIY had been recruited a year before NOSENKO'S

date

of

1959, and in Brussels,

not lordon.

Also, NOSEViO's claim

that this was a Second Chief Directorate operation aimed at en-

ticing CIA into meetings in the USSR was not borne out by the

history of the case or by RELITSKlY's conduct, although it cannot

be excluded that this was a long-term

still

sought without appearing to.

thus is not as accurate as could be expected if his own role in

it had been as claimed.

NOSENKO's description of his own involvement is not consis-

tent

with observed Soviet practice or with operational logic.

NOSENKO said

in both 1962 and 1964 that he had had orders to

supervise the handling of this case in Geneva in the spring of

1962.

The reason was that the case officer for BELITSKIY in

Gereva (ARTEMEV) was young and inexperienced and had not even

worked on the BELITSKIY case before.

NOSEiKO was saying in

effect--with the authority of direct knowledge and official re-

sponsibility--that BELITSKIY, a prominent Soviet citizen having

personal contacts with well placed members of the Soviet Goverr.-

ment, a man who had beer. under the ostensible control of a hos-

tile irtelligence service (CIA) for four years, was sent by the

KGB to Geneva for the purpose of recontacting

CIA, with pre-

pared information,

that the KGB did not send with him the

case officer or any member of the section responsible

for the operation.

Instead, the KGB turned over the respongi-

bility to a young and inexperienced KGB officer who happened to

se in Geneva to protect the security of a delegation and who

had had no prior connection with

the BELITSKIY case nor even

local knowledge of Geneva conditions; then, after BELITSKIY was

already in Geneva,

the KGB had cabled instructions that NoSenKo,

who had no reed to know of the case and had learned of it only

unofficially from conversations in 1960-1961 with the section

Chief responsible, who had no experierce or training in handl-

ing double agent operations, ard who was similarly in Geneva

by chance with delegation security functions, should quide the

"less experienced" case officer."

NOSENKO shored

under questioning, he did not know the contents of any of the

positive intolligence BELITSKIY was to pass to CIA as disinfor-

mation; he did not know BELITSKIY's Moscow or Geneva pattern

of movement or contacts; he did not know in detail hos or when

the operation

started; he did not krow the nature of degree of

British involvement, nor the operational details and contact

arrangements.

NOSE:iKO said that BELITSKIY had been placed on a

Geneva delegation in the hope that ClA might be able to find"

recontact him.*

C. Remarks

The circumstances above not only cast doubt on MOSENKO's

version of the case and his own accegg but also sliggest that

NOSENKO did not have a theoretical appreciation of hor double

agents are handled.

The examples he gave of his "guidance" to

ARTEMEV are few in number.

NOSENKO algo stated in 196÷ that he

had arranged the actual introduction to ifI.ITSKIY of SISLoV, the

TASS man, to provide for BELITSKIY's need of a notioral subsource

for some of his disinformation; NOSENKO by October 1966 had appar-

ently forgotten this event, for he stated unequivocally that kis-

LOV had had no

connection whatever with

the BELITSKIY case. NOS-

ENKO claimed to have met BELITSKIY, but did not recognize his

photo when shown it in 1966.

tions against American tourists in 1959--including clandestine

service since then.

The only other evidence avaiiable is analytical. POPOV was

transferred to the Illegals handling unit in Berlin on 28 June

1957, an assigment of high sensitivity. Urtil mid-hugust he

handled five

Illegals, thereafter only one, TAIROVA, in October

1957. • Following home leave from 12 December 1957 to 19 January

1958, he was again transferred, this time to à position where

Illegals and productive GRU sources of intelligence were not ex-

posed to him.

between March and November 1958 there were signs

of a KGB investigation of the Illegals handling. unit where POPOV

formerly served, and he was recalled to Moscow in November of that

These facts can be interpreted as follows::

- POPOV's status as a CIA source was not compromised before

his transfer to the Illegals handling unit.

- POPOV's status was compromised before his recall to Moscod

in November 1958, probably before his reassignment from the

Illegals handling unit in January 1958, and possibly some time

earlier.

The latter possibility is apparent from the Soviets'

knowledge that the TAIROVA couple was under surveillance in

December 1957 (and until March 1958); it is also noteworthy

that, after having met five Illegals in less than one and one-

half months prior to 13 August 1957, POPOV subsequently was

involved personally with only one other, TAIROVA, in October

1957.

- The KGB, realizing that POPOV was a CIA source, chose to

keep him in Berlin

until November 1958 in order to investigate

the possibility of his operating in conjunction with other

This line of reasoning, if accepted, would confirm GOLITSYN's in-

formation that a KGB agent compromised POPOV prior to the arrival

of ZHUKOV in Berlin, an arrival date falling some time before

23 November 1957.

NOSENKO did not know or did not report to cia that the

This fact suggests that either NOSEIKO was

deliberately withholding from CiA inforration of vital import-

ance in the PENKOVSKIY compromise, or he was unaware of the

KGg's possession of this information, despite his claired posi-

tior. in the U.S. Embassy Section and responsibility for cover-

age of ABIDIAY.

The fact that his story on the pairOYsKIY

"official report" of the KUB, does rot

c. Compror ise of CHEREPANOV

(1) Introduction

NOSENKO'& stories on the compromises of POPOV and PeNKOV

SKIY were examined for their accuracy as to tiring and cause. In

the case of CHEREPANOV (Pages 548-558), there is no question

about

when the so-called CHEREPANOV papers were passed, nor how the #GB

openly learred of the U.S. Embassy's possession

of the papers.

The chief question is the

authenticity of the documents themselves,

with the subsidiary implications, if they are not authentic, that

the passage of the papers was instigated by the KGB, and that

there could have been neither a compromise of nor a search for

CHEREPANOV, as described by NOSENKO

and attested to by his travel

authorization (sae

also Part VIII.D.8.).

(11) The Operational Plan in Draft

Examiration of one draft document--the operational plan

against the CiA officer WINTERS--reveals the following points

related to fora:

- Although only a draft, the title of the case officer,

the designation of his office, the title of his supervisor

as approving authority, and the designation of his office

component as well as the title of the confirming authority

(the head of the department) are spelled out in full, even

including the subordination of the KGB to the Council of

Hinisters of the USSR.

KGB practice, as reported by

other sources and as logic would dictate, does not require

that this be done, cumbersome as these desigrations are,

and the typist routinely fills them in as the official

copy is typed from the draft.

- Although only a draft, this document has been signed

by KOVSHUK as

being approved, which is against connon

sense and KGB practice.

NOSENKO himself noted this dis-

crepancy, asking nimself aloud why kovSHuk had done this.

- Although only a draft, the name of the target of

the plan appears several times, but earlier KGB defectors

have stated and NOSENKO himself has confined that the

nane is left out of drafts

so the typist ir

the typing

pool will not krow the identity of the subject of the

report; a blank line is used wherever the name is to

appear to be filled in by hand by the case officer after

the document comes back from the typist.

- On the basis of references to LANGELLE and POPOV,

this plan (which is not dated) would have to have been

drafted sometine after October 1959.

WINTERS by this

time had been in Moscow since August 1958, had been de-

tected in operational letter-mailing, and

had been

associating wich KGB officers, etc.

he 16 always referred to an true rare.

but this is contrary

to the usage in the other operational plans in the package.

It 1s also contrary to KGB practice, as described by NOSei-

KO and other sources.

- The draft cited several technical aids to be used in

the clandestine study of nInteRs.

It not only gives the KGB

cryptonym of metro and "ieptun-80" for two of these techni-

ques, but inmediately thereafter explains for what purpose

each one uf them is used. In the other operational plans

from CHEREPANOV, and in conformance with the established

KGB practice of

inserting cryptonums for such devices,

these preparations are not only not described, but the

olank. Line typed by the typist has been filled in by hand

after typing.

In addition to the above points ot form, this same document

contains statements which run courter to rigid KGB practice and

which

are internally contractory,

especially noteworthy in en

approved draft. One of the objectives arnourced in the plan 1s

to investigate two Soviet citizens who were detected in contact

with

WINTERS

in Moscow; one of the two is identified parenthetic-

ally as having gore abroad.

This document, if genuine, would be

an admission

on the part of the case offices,

and as approval

thereof by his supervisor, that a Soviet citizen who had been

observed in contact with an identified officer of American intel-

ligence had been cleared by the KGB for travel abroad before the

nature of that contact had been satisfactorily determined by the

KGB.

This is in contradiction to all available informatior. con-

cerning KGB travel clearances, which are denied on the basis of

unauthorized contacts

between

soviet citizens and foreigners in

the Soviet Union, not to mention vesterr. Intelligence officers.

The draft, which corsisty of only three paragraphs. can

be sun-

marized briefly by paragraph to demonstrate the intenal contra-

dictions:

- To establish the nature of NINTERS: intelligence

activities in the USSR, six speciäl tasks will be carried

including round-the-clock surveillance, metka.

"Neptun-80," hiiden microphores. other. audio-devices.

and investigation of already idertified Soviet citizens.

- Because he already been identified as an irtelli-

and he has a hostile attitude toward the

USSR, there is no basis for recruitment; therefore the

actions outlined in the first paragraph will not be

carried out because they might alarm him and cause him

to leave the USSR prematurely.

- Despite the statemerts of the second paragraph.

which indicate that recruitment is out of the question

and which precludes putting into effect the measures

outlined in the first paragraph, this third paragraph

sets forth the expectation that just before wiltErs"

scheduled departure and depending on further accumula-

tion of materials on WINTERS: ard the prevailing polit-

ical climate a the time.

an opportunity is likely to

arise which will permit testing the possibility of

recruiting him.

to the authenticity of the

papers arid of NOSaNKO's accourt on

CHERLPANOV.

is a short summary of the operational activity

of the CIA officer WiNGELLE, covering the compromise of POrOV.

The document says in part:

"Ir. January 1959 a letter with secret

writirg mailed by

WINTERS, was intercepted and was addressed. to a Soviet citizen.

ing to the cortents of the letter.

it was clearly established

that FOFOV was an American agert..."

This coincides precisely with NOSENKO's accourt of POPOV's

compromise (see Payes 532 and 6531.

Unlike GOLITSYN's recollec-

-don of the official report which he read, there is ro reference

in this document to the report of about 1957 from ar agent source

that there as a leak of GRU irformation; ror is there reference

to the indication that the KGS knew that LiNGELLE had been posted

to Moscow in order to nardle a special agent, for this reason

placing LANGELLE under heavy surveillance.

If bott. of these

items were in the official report which GoLitSyli read, their

omission from the sinary report in what purports to be cHiere-

PANOV's handiTiting is roteworthy, particularly since CHEREPANOV

was supposed to have been in the same office (roon) as the casa

officer working agairst LANGELLE during the time the LANGELLE/

POPOV cperation was investigated by the KGe.

the purposes of casing a drop site and putting down tre dead

drop, respectively.

The document further stated that the dead

dron had been put down for REPNIKov.

an agent of Attrican Intel-

ligence who had recently been arrested by the Moscow KGB.

TwO

errors of fact in this passago belie KGB practice as known from

mEnY SOUICES!

- There is no reason to doubt that the KGB observed

LANGELLE on the two occasions of his visits to Lenin Hills,

both times to case a proposed dead dios site.

soth sites

involved staircases, but they were two different stair-

cases in the same general area of the Lenin Hills park.

Since it is a fact that INGELLE did not put down a dead

arop on either occasion. KGB gurveillance could not have

seen him do so.

If the KGb nad reason to suspect that he

had done so, but could not locate it

since it was not

there). the KGB would feel the necessity--even more than

in the case of ABIDIAN and the Pushkin Street drop--to put

24-hour surveillance on the area for a reasonable length

of time, in order to apprehend the agent for whom it was

intended.

The dead drop was not actually put down until

7 June 1958 (during twilight), ten days after the second

casing.

Assumiig the KGB had not stopped its coverage

of the arta after only ten days, the CIA agent who did

put down the dead drop must have been observed doing this.

CHEREPANOV'S note thus erred by attributing to LANGELLE

an action which the KGB knew he had not taken and which

the KGB almost certainly knew someore else had taken.

- At the time the dead drop was put down, it had not

been designated for any agent, REPLIKOV ircluded. It

was a contingency dead drop, to be activated at some

time in the future as necegsary; the agent for whom it

might have been designated could conceivably not even

be recruited until long after the dead drop was loaded.

REPNIKOV, identified in the document as the person in-

tended to unload it, was not a recruited agent of Ameri-

can Intelligence either at the time of the drop-loading ,

or at any time thereafter; neither was any dead drop

contemplated for him in the event that he might be re-

cruited.

Nothing that was in the drop could have sug-

gested REPNIKOV as the intended recipler.t.

Again.

CHEREPANOV's note erroneously and groundlessly assigned

the dead drop to REPNIKOV whereas in fact this dead drop

was unassigned by cIA..

If this document were or purported to be the official

version of the activities of LANGELLE, in typed or printed

form, these errors

in fact could be interpreted as

intentional

and part of the sanitization, or part of

an effort to make the

KGB investigative work look better than it was.

As 1t is a

handwritten copy, supposedly in the writing of. the person who

intended to give the document to the U.S. Government and harm

the KGB, and since CHEREPANOV supposedly would have had access

to the true facts, the absence of some coment further indi-

cates that the document was intentionally inaccurate and in-

complete.

(iv) Remarks

That at least two of the documents were not authentic is

evidence that the CHEREPANOV papers were designed by the KGB

for American Intelligence consumption.

There is no

sensitive information contained in any of the

documents; that is, they are not worth the risk of stealing

either in helpirg the west or damaging the KGB.

It is further

questionable how CHEREPANOV was able to steal drafts destined

for destruction which are dated August 1958, March 1959, and so

on, ¿i he tidd not acquired his motivation of bitterness

against

the KGB until 1961, as indicated by NOSENKO and other sources.

It is also possible to question numerous other aspects of the

CHEREFAVOV case, some datirg from the eariiest known history of

the man and others nore recent.

This seems unnecessary in view

of the analysis of the WINTERs document and the LANGELLs sunmary.

It follows that the CHEREPINOV incident was a provocative

plan of the KGB.

NOSENKO'S StorY about CHEREPANOV, a mutually

confirming source on KGB affairs, must be interpreted as an

indication

that he has deliberately lied in reporting

on the

CHEREPANOV case and his part in the investigation, now shown

to have been spurious.

He has also lied in attesting to the

validity of the CHEREPANOV documents and thereby to the validity

of his

own information on the same topics which those documents

also covered.

Remarks

NOSENiO's errors concerning "ANDRIY" (particularir his early

insistence that "ANDREY" had loft Moscon years before NOSENiO en-

tered the XGB) make it impossible thur NOSESKO could have learned

of the case in the nay ho lates said he did.

NOSENKO's accounts of how he learned of the "Paris agent"' are

vazue and vary with each telliag; they

also depend hearily on coin-

(As pointed out to NOSENKO, the assignment to the cold.

in the area, but there is in the region a well-known city

In earlier accounts he said that he

the Soviet Far East.

c. Remarks

The notes above on NOSENKO's career do not treat most of the

changes of story, contradictions, corrections, or inaccuracies in

NOSENKO's accounts:

Variations of dates may be attributable to

faulty memory, changes in the story might have resulted fron his

own elaborations and

exaggerationg, and inaccuracies might be

explained by his inattention or indifference to detail. If all

the details were to be considered, the story would become even

nore confused.

Certain general aspects stand out, however:

NOSE:KO's description of his naval GPJ service cannot be

accepted as

true.

On the basis of his statements, It appears

moreover that he was never a naval officur, nor an officer of any

other regular military service.

Since NOSENKO claims that his GIU status and service provided

him the platform for a transfer into the KGB (without such for-

malities as medical examination, personnel interviews or question-

naires), this conclusion is relevant to his clain of KSB staff

status from

1952 or 1953.

3. Entry Into the KGB

a. Eligibility

The previous section discussed VOSTKO's eligisility for

admission to the raval GRU and concluded with the remark that,

on the bagis of what NOSEliKO has told CIA about his earlier

life, he could not have been accepted for service in Naval

Intelligence.

Ascorcing to inforrition available to CIA fron

several knowledgeable sources, the iGB has more stringent entry

requirements than any other Soviet organization.

ord must be impeccable.

a course in Marxism Leninism, and a prior rejection by the KGB

itself:

Tre only change since the carlier rejection had beer,

according to NOSENKO, two years of undistinguished military ser-

vice in the Naval GRU.

Moreover, during this naval duty NOSENKO said he had con-

tracted tuberculosis,

for which he ias still under treatment

at the time he entered the State Security Service.

NOSENKO has

indicated on

separate occasions that his illness was a matter

of record with the Gru, and that the reason he did not have to

take a physical examination for entry into the KGB was the avail-

ability of GRU records.

According to DERYABIN, however, KGB

regulations at that time would have precluded admission to KGB

ranks if there was a recent history of tuberculosis even though

already arrested.

b. Date of Entry

NOSENKO has given a variety of dates for his entry on duty

with the KGB

and has provided severa! reasons for his charges of

stOry (Pages 36-89).

During his

first reeting with CIA, when

NOSENKO gave a brief personal and professional autobiography, he

said that he had joined the KGB i.: February or March 1953.

In

1964, however, first while scill attached to the Soviet Disarma-

ment

Delegation and later when reviewing and signing a bio-

graphic history prepared by CIA on the basis of his own account,

NOSENKO set this date back a jear, to early 1952.

During the

interrogations of April 1964, after naming several other dates!

NOSENKO returned to the original one, March 1953,

and has remained

with this version since

that time.

NOSENKO has given

two aif-

ferent reasons for this change of dates (which,

he said in octo

ber 1966, was conscious deception).

In the April 1964 interrogations.

he explained that he had failed his examination in Marxism-Leninism

at the

Institute of International Affairs, which forced hin to

take all his

exans over again and delayed his career:

This was

"unpleasant, NOSENKO said,

and he was attempting to conceal it

from CIA.

In the October

1956 interrogations,

NOSENKO gave a new

and different reason.

He described hod he had been rejected for

employment by State

Security while at the Institute and was trying

to cover up for this because he thought CIA would not believe

that he had first been rejected and then, later, accepted by the KGB.

April 1964 interrogations.

NOSENKO's explanations of why he re-

vised the story have been

inconsistent and have forced him into

684.

Because of this and, in the absence of

any pressure of any kind lincluding any apparent psychological

pressurel to lie about his date of entry, the most logical explana

tion for this change is that HOSENKO forgot in early 1364 either

when he joined the KGB ard/or what he had told CIA in 1952.

DERYABIN ras comerted on the significarce which the date of entry

holds for a KGB officer.

He expressed the opinion that it wou!d

be unusual for a KGB officer to forget this date.

NOSENKO was questioned at length by DERYABIN (Pages 616-619)

the tiring of his entry on duty with the kge.

result of this irterrogation it was determined that NOSENKO was

unavare that at the time he said he joined the KGB, the present

First Chief Directorate was designated the Secord Chief Direc-

torate and vice versa.

Therefore, NOSENKO would have joined a

component entitled the First Chief Directorate in March 1953,

not the Second Chief Directorate as le says.

NOSENKO did not

know or had forgotten various other facts,

including the date

that the MVD was

redesignated the KCB, and misstated che loca-

tiors and existerce of various buiidings and offices

vicinity of the KGB Headguarters buildirg in early 1953.

Ir. June 1962 NOSENKO said several times, in different meet-

ings, that the KGB agent "ANDREY" (Pages 413-414) had been re-

cruited and had left Moscow before he, HOSENKO, entered

the KGB.

He estimated the date as 1949-1550.

NOSENKO knew that "ANDPEY"

was associated in Moscow with RiODIS and when told that RHODES

was trere from 1951 to 1953, admitted that the date he gave might

be "tory.

NOSENKO continued to say, however, that "ANDREY" was

recruited before he

(NOSElKO) became

a KjB officer, and later

reverted again to his estimate that "ANDREi" was recruited in

1949-1950.

Wher. he returned to Geneva

ir. 1964, NOSENKO changed

this story and said that during has 1953-1955 tour in the u.s.

Enbassy Section he saw cipher specialist SELEZNOV, who had come

there io consult on the then-active

"ANDREY" case.

NOSENKO was

unable to explain how he could have been sure in 1962 that the

"ANDREY" case was before his time; when re said in 1961 that

this was not so.

Dayle SMITH confessed that he was

recruited by

the KGB in late

1953, and records show that he left Moscow in

early 1954.

c. Circuistances of Entry

NOSENKO has consistently related his entrance into the KGB

to discussions he had with General KOBULOV in early 1953 in Mos-

cow, after returning from the Baltic.

However, he has changed the

date of these discussions with KOBULOV virtually every time he

has told this story.

In June 1962, NOSENKO said he talked with

KOBULOV at the NOSENKO dacha while on leave in March 1953; during

the april 1964 interrogations he changed the date to February

1953; in April 1965 NOSENKO said he spoke to KOBULOV at the

KOBULOV dacha in January 1953 while on leave and that he liveo

at home and was at the

"disposal of GRU personnel" during Febru-

ary and March.

Finally, in April 1966, ROSENKO said he first

spoke to KOBULOV at KOBULOV's dacha on

New Years Day 1953, that

he was subsequently "resting" at a sanitorium connected with his

tuberculosis of the year befure, and that he spoke

again to

KOBULOV or. the day of STALIN's funeral, while home

for a few days

from the sanitorium.

It was at this second encounter with KOBULOV

that the latter promised to concern hinself with NOSENKO's entry

into the KGB.

In 1962 NOSESTO described the simple procedure by which he

entered the KGS, volunteering that there has no need to fill out

a questionnaire

(arxetal as the KGB already had his files fron

the GRU.

In April 1964 when asked if he had not been required

to fill out any questionnaires or other docurents, NOSENKO des-

cribed the anketa and other forg he completed (saying he took

them home to do sol and his various interviews with. KGB per-

sonnel officers.

He was interrogated in detail on these claims

by

DERYABIN in 1965,

to whom he gave descriptions, albeit in-

accurate,

of the various forms and of his visits to KGB Personnel.

In 1966 NCSENKO wrote in his autobiography that there were no

talks with KGB Personnel before or after his acceptance and in-

plied that there were no forms to fill out.

d. Remarks

According to all of NOSENKO's stories, his GRU service was

the springboard for his acceptance into the KGB.

to the early version was facilitated by the availability

of his GRU personnel file; yet cin has concluded that NOSENKO

it appears highly improbable that he

waa ever in Primorsk under any circumstances.

On the basis of gererally available information concerning

soviet realities at the time of NOSENKO's clained entry into the

*GB, supported by the expert testimony of DERYABIN (who was in

then MVD, in Moscow at the time and h.d been himself a

KGB personnel officer until less than a year earlier), a person

with the background NOSENKO has given could rot be accepted into

the KGB in the marner he claims.

Ilis health alone would seem

to have precluded this, but in addition, NOSENKO descrited a

series of incidents in his life equally likely to cause rejection.

NOSENKO's mistakes,

changes of story,

and apparent fabrications

add to the unlikelihood of his account.

It is concluded that,

as in the case of NOSENKO'S GRU ser-

vice, either NOSENKO and those who have supported aspects of

his story have seriously distorted his past life, or he did not

enter the KGB.

targets during these two years were at first Aserican correspond-

ents in Moscow and later American Aray Attaches at the Embassy.

NOSENKO sought to avoid discussion of his own or other KGB

activity during this period and on occasion he has tried to dis-

miss the whole period as

"not Iclevant" and "of ro

consequence.

NOSENKO has repeatedly said that he "found hinself" only after

his

initial service in the U.S. Embassy Section.

b. Work Against Anerican Correspondents

NOSENKO exempted himself fron reporting details of KGB work

against any specific American correspondent in Moscow in 1953-

1954 (Pages 93-96) by saying that,

as a new, very junior employee

he had no access to operational files and did not participate

personally in the handling of any of the currespondents.

Although

able to identify four correspondents in Moscow no were

then re-

cruited KGB agents, NOSENKO learned this information either in

conversations with his superior KOZLOV or at some point and in

some undefined way after he no longer was working against these

targets.

NOSENKO's early months in the job were spent reading

personality (not operational)

files on a number of the corres-

pondents

in Moscow

(none of which indicated the individual's de-

velopmental or agent status) and familiarizing himself with KGB

methods.

Later NOSENKO was assigned the "agent network" of

drivers, clerical personnel,

and domestics

surrounding four.of

the correspondents (two of

whom were recruited "GS agents at

the time); he met with them periodicaily to determine whether

they had. devaloped any important information.

Even here,

NOSENKO appears to have beer. given very little responsibility:

His superior KOZIOV often wert along to the reetings with. NOSENKO,

first to show him how to handle the agents and afterward when-

ever something interesting would begin to develop.

called neither their names nor personalia concerning them.

the last period in which HOSENKO had no supervisory responsibility

to divert his attention fron personal operational duties.

NOSENKO could not recember when he toud over responsibility

for the Army Attaches, and he named two other iGB officers boforo

settling

upon BuDYLDIN

as the person from whon he received the

Attaches' files.

Then belittling his earlier respongibilities

for correspondents, he bas sald several times that he had been io

Assuming that NOSEVO entered

tbe KGB in the middle of March 1953, this would date his transfer

to work against the Attachos in

the fall of that year.

In dig-

cussing this transfer itsell, however, NOSENKO has congistently

said that it took place in 1954.

Asked when

in 1954, NOSENKO

has variously replied "at the beginning of 1954," January 1954,

and Mey 1954.

Under interrogation in early 1905, NOSENKO TE-

fused to estimate when he took over this responsibility.

He hag

always said that he turned over these duties and transferred fros

the U.S. Embassy Section in June 1955, when the Tourist Department

WAS

established within the Scoond Chief Directorate.

NOSENKO has said in different contoxts that as the American

Department case officer responsible for cperations against the

U.S. Arny Attaches he received and was responsible for assinilat-

1ng the product of a wide variety of sources on the individuals

who were his targets.

He has mentioned information received from

the KGB First Chief

(foreigo Intelligence) Directorate; the

Archives of the HGB/MVD/KGB; micropiones which were emplaced

about a year before MOSESKO entered the American Department*; a

network of Soviet chauffeurs, cooks, language instructors, and

other agents in the Eubassy who together provided little uscul

Information; permarent and roving surveillance patrois outside

the Embassy; fixed observation posts next to, across from and

Dear the Embassy; advance notification of intent to travel by

the Attaches and

their itfreraries; and reports fron outside Hos-

cow, including surveillance, agent networks, the Militia, and the

military.

The point of collecting and assimilating this infor-

matIon, NOSENKO said, was to be able to know what the Attaches

vere doidg in Moscow

ard thereby to control their intelligence

collection activities.

Far less important was the goal of re-

cruiting Military Attaches; NOSENKO knew of only several 10-

stances when this was atteupted, and all of these efforts failed.

Tbe KGB's priseipal interest in control rather than recruit-

ment has been NOSENKO's explanation for knowing little about the

backgrounds ard personal lives of his targets--such information,

ho stated, simply was not pertinent to the primary mission of

*On some occasions NOSENKO has said that the microphones in the

offices were his most valuable source of informa-

tion on his targets of 1954-1955; at other times

that he knew nothing of these microphones until he reentered the

U.S. Embassy Section in 1960; and at still other times he claimed

to have known only of their existence during 1953-1955 but

where any were located.

control.*

He has also used this explanation to support his clain

that there were no recruitments

of ailitary attaches during this

period.

An exception, wherein the KGB did carefully compiie a great

deal of vulnerability data on ar. Army Attache, has described by

NOSENKO in connection with the approach to walter MÜLE (Page 104).

On the basis of these expianations, NOSENKO's knowledge of the

official and unofficial activities of his alleged targets in this

period deserves atrention.

NOSENKO knew almost nothing about the personal backgrounds

and families of the eight members of the Army Attache Office

whor he identified as his targets (Pages 99-100). hlthough he was

able to identify each by rant. and position in the rabassy--sone-

times inaccurately--ard

a few cases to describe certain of

their operational activities, he was unaware of or had

forgotten

such facts as:

and 1955, was

asso one arrested Mcce set the army ouasice of 955-

in 1954.

- Assistant Army Attache Ira RICHARDS was a language

student of GROMOKOVA (identified by NOSENKO as a KGB agent) ;

by RICHARDS' account she sought to elicit biographic data

from him during the lessons.

- William STROUD, the issistant Amy Attache, travelled

to kharkov in May 1955 to interivew an American defector.

(NOSENKO has identified Frank SISCOE, "ho accompanied STROUD;

as a suspected CIA officer; he nas coopted by CIA.)

NOSENKO, furthermore, was ignorant of important events, known

independently to CIA, which were within the sphere of what he

claimed was his direct, personal responsibility:

- NOSENKO claimed direct personal jesponsibility for

the file of and operational activity against Lieutenant

Colonel Howard FELCHLIN (Pages 191-103).

He ciaimed to be

receiving agert infornation on him but could not recall the

names or cryptoryms of

any such agents.

Gile said, sor

exarple:

•I think FELCHLiN must have had a maid,

and she

would have been a KGB agent.")

NOSENKO described FELCHLIN

as by far the most aggressive of his

targets

and hence the

object of special interest; yet he did not know or remember

ROSENKO himself, when giving the reason why he did not know

more details about the

U.S. Embassy Section's targets while

he was its Deputy Chief in 1960-1961, said that as a supervisor

he was too busy overseeing subordinates; hence,. NOSElKO con-

tinued, he could not be expected to remember as many such de-

tails

as would be possible had he been a case officer working

daily with only four or five files.

In another context, NOSENKO

explained why he was unable to supply the details of planning

and organizing operations

tourists in the period 1955-

1959; he contrasted operations against tourists, who often

cane and went in a matter. of a few days, to

the work against

the Military Attaches and diploats stationed in Moscow on

perarent assignments, who could be studied systematically and

anything about FELCHLIN's background, presurably well docu-

mented by the KGB because FELCHEI!: had been to the USSR in

two different capacities, merchant seaman and diplomatic

courier, prior to arriving in Moscow as the assistant Alms

Attache: also FELCHLIN had had prior official association

with GRU officers in Austria, Germany, and the United States,

and he continued to be ir. liaison with one of them in Moscow.

NOSEYKO could recall nothing about FELCHLIN's intelligence

activities in the USSR or his trips about the country, or

what had been done about them by the KiB. In speaking of

F'ELCHLIN's expulsion from the Soviet Union, NOSENKO reforted

the KGB file noted that FELCHLIN had been caught taking

photographs on some occasion, but he did not know trat FEI,-

CHLIN in June 1954 was arrested in Kiev with another Assist-

ant Army Attache, F.J. YENGER.

(Erroneously identifica by

NOSENKO as an Air Force Attache, YEAGER likewise should have

been NOSENKO's targe:. NOSENtO also did not know that

FELCHLIl, with another AImy Attacne and iwo Air. Force Attaches,

in September 1953 had rade an irprecedented train trip through-

out Siberia and that six months later, at the end of March

1954, had been the subject of a rewspaper article which

charged tr.at they had lost

"spy documents" on the train.

NOSENKO was unable to provide a date

for FELCHLIN's expul-

sior from the soviet Unior., and he knew nothing of the

un-

usual circunstances of FELCHLIN's departure from Moscow;

le insisted that nobody else was declarea persona non grate

along with FELCHLIN.

In fact, FELCHLIN was

expelled along

with dir force taJor alter MOHINNEY, and the Soviets re-

fused to permit the iwo to leave Moscow aboard the Ambassa-

dor's personal plane until imbassador BOHLEN hinself protested.

Confronted by his laci of krowiedge of the persona non

Irata action, NOSENKO said that he could noi be expected to

now the details because this incident occurred after he

transferred from the U.S. Embassy Sectior to the Tourist

Department in June 1955.

NOSENKO was

then told the recorded

date of the expulsion, 3 July 1954, and he replied that this

was not true.

- Discrepancies appeared in NOSENKO's account of one

of the best known incidents

in the history of KGB operations

against the American officials in the Soviet Union, the

subject of reports by GOLITSYN and other CIA sources and the

subject of training caterials. This was the seizure

sensitive technical collection equipment on 5 May 1955 in

Stalingrad from three Assistant Military Attaches from the

U.S. Embassy--Major John S. BENSON, Captain STROUD, and

Captain MULE--and their expulsion

from the Soviet Union two

days later.

NOSENKO claimed direct responsibility for KGB

work against these officers (Pages 103-105); he described

an earlier attempt to defect MulE, his own plans for seizing

this equipment at a railroad station outside Moscow, and his

role in developing plans for the successful operation in

Stalingrad.

When

NOSENKO was pressed under interrogation to

give the actres he said he eate operation es carried sona

non grata action,

after he was in the Tourist Department and therefore he knew

no more about it.

nhen

told that the operation took place

at least a month before

his alleged transfer, NOSENKO could

offer no explanation for his lack of knowledge.

- NOSENKO identified George VAN LAÊTHEM as an Assistant

Air Attache in 1953 or 1954: he was a target of another U.S.

Embassy Section officer, and an unsuccessful KGB development

operation was carried out against him.

NOSENKO did not krow

that VAY LASTHEM was actually

an Assistant Army Attache, who

left Moscow in March 1953 and was succeeded by NOSENKO's Own

target halter MULE (ste above) .

What NCSaNKO additionally

did not know is that In Moscow VAN LiêThay was the Attache

cryptographic security officer, the superior of Dayle SMITH

(the subject of NOSE KO's "INDREY" lead--see below)

friend of the motor pool sergeart Roy RHODES,

a KGB agent.

NOSENKO furthermore did not know that on 19 March 1955,

again as an himy Attache, and unly two years after beirg

transferred from Moscow,

VAN LAETHEM was again sent to Mos-

cow, ostensibly on a PCS assignmert but actually on tempor-

ary duty.

account should have been responsible for him. VAN

progran at the Enbarsy.

(VAN L'ETHIN'S sEcond tour 1n

Moscow involved the planned use of the elestronic equipment.

which was seized In Stalingrad while VAN LAETHEM was still

in Moscow.)

d. Additional Reporting

His information or two other operatiors involving Americans

was said by NOSENKO to stem from his 1953-1955 service in the U.S.

Embassy Section.

One was the recrüitment of the military cipher

rachire mechanic having the KGB cryptonym

"ANDREY" (Dayle SMITH,

see Pages 413-426

and further comments in Part VIII.B.3. and

VIII.C.).

NOSENKO in 1962 was sure not only that this recruit-

ment

took place before he joined the KGB but that "ANDREY" had

left the USSR by then as well: he repeatedly estimated "ANDREY'S"

recruittent date as "1949-1950." At all times he has claimed

certainty that

"ANDREY" was the last KGB recruitment in the

Embassy until the time of NOSENKO's defection in Jaruary 1964.

In 1964, however, NOSE:,KO changed his story and said "ANDREY"

was active while NOSENKO was in the U.S. Embassy Section ii. 1954-

1955.

The other operation was an unsuccessful recruitment approach

atove)

meeting with the KGB arranged through letters wnich

had been

sent to SMITH.

This occurred in 1954 or 1955, NOSENKO

said, and in support of the recruitment approach, he handled

SMITH admitted to J.S. authorities

having received four letters from the KGB between 2 and 5 June

1956 la year after NOSENKO dated his departure from the U.S.

Embassy Section), but he denied having had any personal meetings

with KGB officers.

e. Remarks

NOSENKO's accounts of the 1953-1955 period are confused,

contradictory,

incomplete and inaccurate.

He has been inconsistent in dating

his shift of responsibilities withir. the U.S. Embassy Section,

in dating his departure from the Section (viz., the timing of

the Stalingrad incident and the approach to SMITti), and in dating

his first knowledge of the microphones in the Embassy.

8. Introduction

NOSENKO's activities from June 1955 to January 1960, his

first period of alleged seivice with the ivericar-british-Canair

jan Section of tourist Department of the KGB Second Chief Diree-

torate, are described in Pages 107-151. For the purloses of the

followirg diecussion, it is convenient to divide this period i-to

two parts.

The first uf these covers the years fron Jure 1955

to June 1958, when NOSENKO said re

tional activity.

operation in which his participation is confirmed) took place a

year later,

in June 1956, when he assisted in the honosexual en-

trapment and recuitrent o! Richard BURGI (Pages 113-120).

This

recruitment, which cocurred close in time to the Minister NOSENKO's

death, was by NOSENKO's account a turning point in his personal

and professional life. Lith it, NOSENKO began to acquire a sense

of self-confidence and responsibility and began to

"grow" fron a

wastrel

into an effective and successful KGB officer.

As a re-

sult of this operation, the first successfui recruitnent in the

then short history of the Tourist Department, NOSENKO first came

into personal contact üith General GRIBAiOr.

iccording to ali

accourts prior to October 1965, when he retracted the claim,

the three years preceding his pronotion

in June 1958 to the position of Deputy Chief of the American-

Canadian-british Tourist Section, hereafter referred to as the

Arcrican Icurist Section.

The oniy case of the june 1955-Jure 1958 period resulting

in agent contacts abroad, and the one to which NCSElKO ascribed

the greatest importance, was the recruitment of BurGI. For this

reason, the BUPGI operation is discussed in detail below, with

particular attention being

given to those aspects of tre case

which reflect upon NOSENiO's own personal role.

(ii) The BURGI Case

NOSE-KO's statements of this operation generally agreed with

that BURGI provicca to

the FBI in 1957.

The part NOSENKO played

in the case, both in his brief initial presence with the two

homosexuals in the Moscow restaurar: on the evening of BURG!'s

compromise 120 Jure 1356) and in the fiev events 123-28 June 1990)

were discrepancies

between NOSINKO's and BurGi's versions, but

most of these couls sten from NOSINkS's faulty nerory nine years

after the events.

¡Such discrepancies include losinKO's iailure

to remember his first Moscow meetings with BURGI: the identity,

role.

or even existence of the person "Anatoliy" whon BURGI says

introduced him

tO HOSENKO and participated in the homosexual

compromise; whether NOSENKO was at the kiev airport to meet BURGI;

the locatica of NOSENKO's bedroom in the

Kiev Hotel as compared

tO BURGI'S; NOSEIKO's reference to BURGI's "interpreter" when in

fact BURGI neither had nor needed one; and NOSEliKO's failure to

remember the unusual circunstances of BURGI's departure from

Kiev.)

Other contradictions and onissions in NOSENKO's reporting

relate to natters of greater operationai consequence:

- NOSENKO was Unable to say when or how the KGS first

learned that BURGI, tas a homosexual, nor could he remember

who flist proposed an operation agairst him.

- NOSENKO gave a confused and evasive account of his

dealings with the first Chief Directorate on this case.

- NOSENKO insisted that there was no official file on

BURGI, and that none was opened as a result of this opera-

tion.

The initiative for the operation came, he said, fron

the Second Chief Directorate, and when NOSENKO traced BURGI

in the First Chief Directorate, there was no information on

him there.*

The KGB's only information on

BURGI: at the

time of the compromise came from BURGl's visa application

(which showed him to be a professor of Russian)

and a few

agent reports from the preceding days in Moscow:

on the other hand, reported that during the recruitar:

c. Promotion to Deputy Chief of Section

NOSENKO said that in June 1958, when the unit that rad

formerl: handled tourists from all countries was resiganized into

two sections, he was promoted from the rank or senior

cer to that of Deputy Chief of the newly created american Tourist

NOSENKO said that this section was the most important

Tourist Department,

and that he did not know why he,

in particular, had been chosen its Deputy Chief but was certain

that GRIBANOV had no voice in

d. Knowledge of Section's Staff and gent Persornel

NOSENKO has named with clarity and consistency the other

officers of the American Tourist Section during this period.

The

Soviet agents of his section whom NOSENKO has identified were

mostly his own; he said that the agents were corstantly shifted

from case officer to case officer and hence it was "difficult to

say just who handled which agents."

NOSENKO said he had approxi-

mately eight soviet agents in 1958 ard about 12 or 14 in 1953, -

most of them employed by inturist (Pages 109-112).

With the ex-

ception of the two homosexuals, YEEPElOV and VOLKOV discussed

separately below, NOSENKO cannot supply personal data on nis own

agents or remember specific jobs they did for the KGB.

Kncwledge of Section's Activities

As of June 1958, according to NGSINKO, the work of the

section of which he was deputy chief was

"just getting going."

Its mission was, first of ail, to detect western Intelligence

officers and agents anong the

increasing flow of tourists visit-

ing the Soviet

Union; only secondarily was the section directed

toward the recruitment of KGB agents from among these tourists.

In his new position NOSENKO was responsibie for supervising

other officers in the section in efforts along these lires.

Be-

cause of this and because at GRIBANOV's request he personally

reviewed KGB information on the use of tourist cover by western

intelligence

services and KGB counteraction through 1958 (Pages

• 145-146), NOSENKO made

a number of statenents concerning these

subjects during the 1955-1959 period.

CIA started its so-called "legal travelle."

there is: firm collateral information on what the KGB krew of

this operational program. In view of NOSENKO's duties in the

American Tourist Section and the section's prime mission, he should

have knowledge of agent compromises during 1958 and 1959.

to collateral holdings, what NOSENKO did and did not

compared with information from other sources. These

facts are reviewed below.

(1) BLAKE

A valuable source of information for the KGB in its planning

for the operational activity of its Tourist Department in the

late 1950'g and early 1960's was the Englishman, George BLAKE

(Pages 146-147).

BLAKE has confessed that in the summer of 1959

he-passed the KGB a 19-page summary of the results of a_three-day

meeting during the first week of June 1959, between representa-

tives of CIA and MI-6; these sessiong were

trine pertaining to tourist-type operations and stressed CIA's

reliance on tourist agents for the spotting, recontacting, assess-

ment, and camunicatiors support of interral assets.

While NOSENKO has displayed some familiarity with cIA modus

operandi in tre field of tourist operations, he has never

tiored that the KGB was in possession

of documentary reporting

which descrited these rethods in full detail.

not appear to be aware of who Blike was, nuch less of his 1m-

portance to the KGE.

NOSENKO never volunteered the name of

BLAKE in his debriefings, and when specifically asked in 1962

about SLAKE, the KGB

agent in British Intelligence, he said

that he had read the dossier and that BLÄKE had been "an agent

of the second (Britisti Department (of the Seccra

when the name BLAKE das mentiored, he asked:

BLAKE had, in addition, passed to thr KGB a photocopy of

a 21-page sunmary report of a secord, isliov-ip conference be-

tween CIA and MI-6 on "legal travel" op.! cions which was held

in Washington from 20 to 25 Aprli 1960.

iNSENKO, although not

in the Tourist Department at the time the latter report was

received by the KGB, said that he reviewed all important ma-

terials of the Anerican Tourist Section when he became its Chief

in January 1962.

Asked whether the Tourist Departrent had re-

ceived documentary irformation from ary agent source while

NOSENKO waS away

fron the department in the years 1960-1961,

he replied that none had and that he knew of no agent who could

have provided such documentary irformation.

(i1) GOLITSYN Document

NOSENKO in 1964 reported knowing that GOLITSYN at the time

of his defection in December 1961 took with him an official

top secret KGB documert concerning Western Intelligence oprira-

tional activity in the field of tourisn (Pages 147-149).

this fact in the Jure 1962 neetings.

Although

NOSENKO also stated that this document had been prepared by

the Tourist Department,

he has not been able to describe the

document in detail and specifically did rot mention that this

particular document was in large part based, as subsequent

analysis has shown, upon the above-mentored reports submitted

to the KGB by George BLAKE.

(111) Tour1st Agents

NOSENKO asserted that the KGB detected no agents among

American tourists during the years 1958 or 1959,

and that ro

tourists had been caught in the act of mailing letters,

servic-

ing dead drops, or contacting agents, except ore in 1959 whose

name.

NOSENKO said, was MacGuIre

(actually McGOWAN in 1958).

NOSENKO signed a statement attesting to these facts.

The KGB docurent supplied by GOLITSYN, however, refers to

a number of cases cf American tourists wo vere ioura by tre

KGB to be engaged in intelligence colieccion or intelligence

support activities.

In addition to MeGohi, the GOLItSyN docu:

the cases of SIYARD, GrAY and pElliCIS, all of then

in 1358 and 1959.

Inese years

coincide with the time when NOSENiO clains to lave been Deputy

Chief of the section wich was responsible for monitoring and

uncovering

activities of this sort, bat NOSENKO has never zen-

Furtherture, the annual reports of the section

which HOSENKO would nave helred to write, by virtue of nis

clained position as Deputy Chief of the merican Tourist Sectioi,

presumably included all of these cases.

f. NOSENKO '& Tourigt Paper

NOSÈNKO was questioned at lergth on the review of western

tourist operations unici ne clained to have written for GRiZANOV.

He said he gathered the material for this study from carlier

annual reports

of the Tourist Departnent and by talking with

varinus case officers, then took the study to GRIDA:OV's

office. NOSENKO could rot remember whether he discussed his

firdings with GRIBANOV, could noù give any exanpies of the

information which re incluled in the report (other than statis-

tical information on the ircrease in foreign courism),

could

not recall what the report said about ClA tourist operations

lother than there appeared to be increased use of tourists

travellirg by automobile), and dij not knon what other american

Intelligence services were sending agents into the Soviet Union

under tourist cover during these years.

On the basis of his

Insearch for this report

and his cin experience, NCSENiO said

he knew that KGB operations againt tourists had been develop-

ing slowly and that.

at the time the report was written during

the tourigt. season

of 1959, the KGB knew little about the use

of tourism by the irerican services.

BLAKE'& confession that he passed documentary information

on this subject to the I'GB, but more particularly the intensity

of KGB operations against tourists ät this time as reflected

in the GOLITSYN docurent and other reports indicate, that this

statement by NOSESiO must be erroreois.

g. The OSWALD Case

According to NOSE:RO's account of his direct involvement

in the case of Lee Harvey OSWALD (Pages 136-114), his partici-

pation seemed to sten solely from his supervisory role

Deputy Chief of the Arerican Section.

In this capacity, NOSENKO

said, he was

the one wno made the decision that OSWALD was

"not normal" and of no interest to the KGB.

On other occasions

NOSENKO has reported that he made this decision together with

his subordinate

KRUPNOV, or that "they decided," or

decided."

NOSENKO's information or. the handling of OSWALD in

1959 is unique, and there is no collateral information against

which it can be reliably measured.

The resuits of the poly-

graph

U.S. authorities about it.

in this

opcration, not obtain permission to travel alone with the ayent

to Lvov and Minsk after the recruitment; the local KGB's in

Uzhgorod, Lvov, and Minsk did that, he said.

NOSENKO Could

not

describe KGB arrangements and support in Lvov and Minsk,

where he said "the only thing I needed was a car from the air-

port to the city." a

Als said they travelled by train.)

Likewise, NOSENKO was unable to describe the KGB procedures

for clearance, tracing, reporting and other management of this

operation.

(iv) The Agent PRIPPEL

FRIPPEL (Pages 129-135) is the only American citizen with

whom NOSENtO ever had more than fleeting operational contact

in his whole KGB career and is the only foreiyn agent he claims

to have run for tore

than two bestings at any time in his car-

eer with the exception of rascals, pages 201-212, and "PROKHOR,"

Pages 173-181).

The Anerican Express Company representative

in Moscow, FRIPPEL has not recruited so that he could report

on American tourists visiting the Soviet Union, or on official

and unofficial

Anericans living there,

but in hopes of learn-

ing about approaches being made to members of Soviet delegations

visiting the United States.

with a weaith of reporting assets

in Moscow, NOSENKO said, the KGB did not need him there. When

PRIPPEL was reassigned to New York City, however, there

were

no plans to contact hin through the local KGB Legal Residency.

FRIPPEL is identified by. *GB cryptonym in the CHEREPANOV papers

as a suspected American Intelligence agent.

That FRIPPEL Was

considered such by the iGg is confired by statements of a self-

admitted KGB agent in contact with the Anerican tourist ROBERTS

in 1962.

NOSEND said ?RIPPEL was his agent and said, repeatedly:

"I recruited him myself."

In 1962 no other KGB officer was

mentioned by NOSENko, who quoted from a ninter of his conver-

sations with FRiPPEL.

In 1964 NOSENKO said he and CHELNOROV

"had carried out the

recruitment together," but NOSENKO was the

case officer.

According to PRIPPEL'S account, CHELNCKOV bas

the senior officer in the recruitment and in the later reetings.

NOSENKO never met PRIPPEL alone while FRIPPEL was stationed

in MOscow.

The only times he ever did so were later, he said,

then PRIPPEL returned to the USSR, and these consisted of a brief

visit to FRIPPEL's hotel room during FRIP?EL'& visit to Moscow

in the sumer of 1962 and a short meeting in Odessa where FRIP-

PEs was on a cruiss in February 1963.

FRIPPEL reportedly was

In further reference to NOSENKO's claime to having been

the case officer in these various operstiona, te has been agable

to recount in any detail KGB ataff procedures involved in these

operations, such as name-tracing, coordinating with other con-

ponents, obtaining approvala for action, etc.

ROSENKO

knew nothing

about the documents on such operations which BLAKE

gave the KGB and which can be presured to have been of the ut-

most interest to the American Toulot Section, among all KGB

Hendguarters elementa.

These documents offered saterial that

could have proven valuable to the preparation of NOSENKO's Own

paper on Western tourist operations; they were used in the genu-

Ine KGB paper written by the Tourist Department and passed to

CIA by GOLITSYN.

As with his status as a case officer in the

American Tourist Section, NOSENKO the Deputy Chief could not

describe how data on tourists was received, general and spe-

cific plans laid, events discussed, decisions made, and lpads

channeled.

The foregoing paragraphs suggest the conclusion that NOSENXO

not a senior case officer or the Deputy Chief of the Ameri

an Tourist Section.

while the methods of the Tourist Depart-

ment are not independently known in detail, it is conceivable

that what NOSENKO did on behalf of the KGB

(not necessarily the

American Tourist Section) could have been accomplished by a

principal agent.

These conclusiong do not cast doubt about

the facts presented by NOSENKO on the KGB investigations in the

OSWALD case but merely rule out the possibility of NOSENKO's

having been involved with this case in any way prior to the

assassination of President Kennedy.

was part of his (GRIBANOV's) plans and was primarily to put

new ilte into operations against American code clerks, the

primary target of the Second Chicl Directorate.

did not tell him why he, instead of another, had been

selected for this job, although NOSENKO had the impression

it was because of his

achievements in the Tourist Depart-

ment. (see Part VIII.R.3.).

NOSSNKO'S transfer could not

rave been a result of his close personal relationship with

GRIBANOV or because his father was a friend of GRIBANOV's:

NOSENKO has admitted that he exaggerated the closchess of

his relationship with the Chief of the Second Chief Directo-

rate and nost recently (February 1965) said that he had few

personal contacts with him outside of work; NOSENKO has also

said that his father never net GRIBANOV.

NOSENKO Initially said that he relieved nobody on

coming into the section.

He eventually recalled, however,

that BAKHVALOV was his predecessor but left the scction

before he (NOSENKO) arrived.

NOSENKO's confusion on this

point, his description of how he assumed custody of certain

from BAKHVAINV although the latter had transferred to

another department, and the opportunities NOSENTO had to

name BAKHVALOV as his predecessor before he eventually did

so are described on Pages 154-156.

c. Functions as Deputy Chief

In NOSENKO's view the transfer to become Deputy Chief

of the section from the same position in another section

was definitely an important promotion:

He now became

second-in-charge of the most important operational section

of the entire Second Chief Directorate.

As KOVSHUK's

NOSENKO had the right and obligation to be aware of

all activities in order to exercise his general supervisory

funstions and so as to be prepared to become the Acting

Chief of the section when necessary.

NOSENKO said that consequently nothing was hidden from

ties during the relatively recent years of 1960 ard 1961

in the years before and after this period.

the section's operationg, to supervise in particular opera-

tional activity against American diplomatic personnel assigned

to the U.S. Fabassy.

NOSENKO had been specifically instructed

by GRIBANOV and American Department Chief KLYPIl to concentrate

his efforts on the supervision of operationg against the

most important American recruitment target, the code clerks

at the Embassy, with the alm of revitalizing these acti

vitles and making recruitments.

been

none since

the early 1950's.) According to the agreed-

upon

division of labor, NOSENXO also assumed cese officer

additionally, he was responsible for maintaining

the section's file on factors pertaining to the physical

security of the Embassy and for receiving and disseninating

materials frou the microphones concealed in various U.S.

These were functions held, JOSENKO said,

by his predecessor BAKHVALOV and were turned over by NOSENKO

at the end of 1961 to his successor GRYAZNOV: Apart fron

these duties, which apparently

were routinely assumed by

the Deputy Chief, NOSENKO supervised, during the early part

d. Knowledgeability as Deputy and Acting Chief

As deputy to KOVSHUK, NOSENKO said, he nas aware of

all the operationg being conducted by the section during

this two-year period; by his own

nothing was

kept Iron him.

There were in these two years a total of

over three months when KOVSHUK was ill or on leave, and at

these times NOSENKO was acting chief of the section.

the administrative work and operational activity of the en-

tiresection and,

in particular, assumed KOVSHUK's work 1n

directing operations against diplomatic personnel assigned to

in Moscow.

Therefore, pér:inent to his

clains are the facts presented in the following paragraphs.

NOSENKO could not remember any operational decisions

that he made as acting chief, or any specific or unusual

occurrences during these times.

In ansuer to a question,

NOSENKO said that the only specific responsibility of KOVSHCK's

which he handled in the Chief's absence was reporting to the

Chief of the First Department about all correspondence going

out of the U.S. Embassy Section.

NOSENKO did not meet any of KOVSHUK's agents during his

the American correspondent STEVENS (about whom NOSENKO had

reported in connection

with his responsibilities in 1953-55).

NOSENKO also said that in 1960 KOVSHUK recruited PREISFREUND,

although earlier he had reported that he (NOSENKO) had dose

NOSENKO sald that he carefully directed the work of GRYAZiON

and approving

or disapproving all operational neasures. NOSENKO originally

asserted that he had also read and studied all the files

duâl cases, however,

he retracted these statcuents and said

that ho say tave skinned some of the files, that he did not

CIA has two types of information against which the re-

ports Irom NOSENKO can be compared.

The first consistg of

the detailed debriefings of code clerks returaing frem

Moscow, adainistered routinely by the Department of State

and the milltary services; it also includes the special de-

briefings and interrogations of the Department of State,

the FBI, and CIA as a follow-up to KGB opcrational activity

which hag become known

from various sources.

On this basis,

CIA has

accumulated a considerable amount of colliteral

infornation on the activitles

of the U.S. Erbassy section

involving United States code clerks during the porind NOSEN-

KO sald be was its Deputy Chiel.

The second type of infor-

nation is the reporting on KGB operations by GULITSIN sho,

fron contacts with U.S. Embassy Section officers in loscow

and Helsinki, was able to provide several leads to what he

said were recruited American code clerks.

GOLITSIN's infor-

nation thereby directly contradicts ISENKO's statement that

the KGB had

no successes in its code clerk recruitment opera-

tions from the

earl! 1950's to the end of 1963, and none of

the

subjects of GOLIlSYN's leads have been positively identi-

fied.

Some of GOLITS"S's information has been gererally

substantiated by other

sources.

In one case, this confirma-

tion has core iron NOSENKO himself, whose information on the

STORSBERG operation, on the agent PREISFREUND's role in it,

and on GOLITSYN's knowledge of KGB use of PREISFELD pre-

srints

evidence that KOSOLiPOV did in

fact travel on the Helsinki-

Hoscow train with an American code clerk at the time and

under the cover GOLITSYN reported. NOSENKO denied that such

& trip was made by XOSOLAPOV.

NOSENKO has been questioned in detail about each of the

code clerks serving in Moscow during 1960 and 1961.

YOSENKO 's

Information on a number of other cases,

less important in

his opinion, 1s described in the tabulation of American

case leads giver. on

Pages 364-410.

Certain of these cases

are further

examined below to determine whether NOSESKO'g

knowledge equates with details which the deputy and acting

chief of the U.S. Enbassy Section could reasonably be

expected to know and retain.

(1) The STORSBERG Case

The operation against STORSBERG (Pages 166-185) was,

the nust important case he had as supervisor

of code clerk operations.

The KGB, while able to break

certain State Department ciphers, had had

no success with

military cryptographic systems,

and therefore NOSENKO

"dropped everything for a year" to involve himself with the

development of James STORSBERG, th military code clerk at

the U.S. Embassy.

The following facts are pertinent to an

evaluation of NOSENKO's story of this case.

NOSENKO originally raised the STORSBERG case indirectly

at his first meeting with ClA on 9 June 1962.

told how

GOLITSYN, during a visit to the American Department in 1960,

at a time NOSENKO was on leave, had requested permission

to use a U.S.

Embassy Section agent, a Finn, in his orn opera-

tions

in Helsinki.

During his discussions in the American

Department, GOLITSIN learned that this Finnish agent was

being

used

in operations against Embassy employees living in

America House.

NOSENKO said that the KGB realized that

GOLITSIT bad

passed

this information on to the Americans

following his defection, for the regulations goverring

visits to America House

by

third

nationals had been tightened.

At this mecting NOSENKO did not name the Finnish

agent or

specify

his involvement in any particular operational acti-

vity nor did he date the visit by GoLlISYN.

Later in the 1962 meetings NOSENKO gave a detailed

summary of the Finnish agent's involvement in the unsuccess-

recruitment attempt against an Ancricar military code

NOSENKO, without naming the Finn or the American,

sald that he personally conducted the recruitment confron-

tation with GRIBANOV present.

These early accounts were full

of quotes of what NOSENKO said to the American and vice

versa, descriptions of the American's reaction to the confron-

tation, and statements of NOSENKO'S admiration for the Ameri-

can despite his refusal to work.

Following his defection,

NOSENKO recounted the case in even greater detail, in fact,

in more detail than he gave for any other case.

He identi-

fied the Fion as PREISFREUND ard the American

as STORSBERG

and described ard referred to the case whenever possible

(over 50 times).

When asked for details of other code clerk

for example, he repeatedly diverted to discussion of

the STORSBERG CaSe

to illustrate how the KCB operated against

code clerks in general.

After defecting NOSENKO denied that he

personally con-

frosted STORSBERG.

He said that his personal

role was limited

to directing STORSBERG into the hotel rood where the approach

was made; after first saying that he had never

clained any

other role, he admitted that he may have been "paisting"

admission came only after the tape of NOSEKD's 1962

statezents had been played to him and he had successively

said that (a) it was not bis volce,

(b) he was druick in

1962, (c) the CIA case officer in Geneva had nade him

nervous, and (d) CIA probably spliced various pieces of

tapa together to nake this false one. Still, NOSENKO

said, he directed the entire operation from beginning to end,

it was his most important case..

Interrogated further

corcerning his role in the STORSBERG operation in October

NOSEYKO said that he had never read the KGB file on

STORSBERG, which was hold by GRYAZNOV.

GOLITSYN, as NOSENKO reported, didvisit the American

Department, did request permission to use PREISFREUND opera-

tionally in Helsinki, and did report this to CIA in late

1961 following his defection.

GOLITSY also reported that;

in denying his request, KOlSHUK told him that PREISFREUND

had recently been used in the successful recruitment of an.

American Embassy employce, possibly a military man and pos-

sibly a code clerk or diplomat; therefore, KOVSHLK said,

PREISFFEUND could rot be used for six morths or so in other

optrations, for otherwise the Anericans might becone suspi-

NOSENKO has not reported these details, but has said

only that GOLITSIN ras instructed

to drop interest in PREIS-

FREIND because PREISFREUND belonged to the American Department

of the Second Chief Directorate.

NOSENKO volunteered at his first meeting with CIA that

he was on leave outside of Noscow on

the uccasion of CoLITSYN's

visit to the inerican Department.

Since defecting he has

insisted with

absolute certainty that

this visit took place

in the late

spring or carly summer of 1961 and has described

his leave, wheie

he went and with whon. GOLITSlY's passport

and ClA travel data show that GOLITSY? was un TDY in Moscow

in danuary 1961.*

Told this, NOSESTO said that it is untrue,

that he recallrd being told of COLITSIN's visit after his

return fron leave in July 1961, and that he was certain that

ke (NOSENKO) was in Moscow in January 1961.

JOSENKO has indirectly confirmed that the oprration of

which GOLITSYN learned during this visit to the Ancrican

Department was the operation against STORSBERG. He did so by

bis assertion that PREISFREUND, his own agrnt, was used in

only one uperation, that against STORSBERG.

Thus, as to the

outcone of this operation, there is a conflict between NOSEN-

KO's infornation and that earlier provided by COLITSiN.

There is also a conflict between NOSENKO's statements that

the recruitment approach took place some time after May 1961

(NOSINKO's dates have varied from June to October 1961,

STORSBERG said it was in October 1961) and GOLIISTN's state-

ment that this approach had already been made in January 1961

when he learned of it.

OLITSYN provided a second lead which YOSENKO appear.

GOLITSIN sald that during a visit to the Anerican Department

*GOLITSYN has based his assertion that JOSENKO was not in

in the spring of 1960, * he learned Iron GRYNZiOV that he

(GRYAZOV) had devrloped an operation against an American

military

code clerk to the point that the KGB nas "99

poir cent" certain that a recruitient approach to this code

clark would be succesaful.

hark-up cryptographic duties in STORSBERG's absencr.

If

SOStiXO's report that there was no developaont of or approach

tO MUKLEY can be accepted, this load from GOLITSIY would

apply to STORSBERG rather

than HIRLEY. There is s conflict

hotween NOSENKO's Information on the STORSBERis case and this

second GOLITSYY lead In that GOLITSIN described an operation

which was in its final stages in the spring of 1960, whoreas

JOSENO

(as

well

as STORSBERG) asserted that the STORSBFEG

op.:ration was just under way at this time and was long and

drawn-out.

(11) The JENNER Case

Apart from the STORSBERG operation, NOSENKO has been

able to supply the greatest amount of detail concerning the

opcration (also unsuccessful) against the State Departrent

pouch clerk Paul JEWER (Pages 186-196).

This case developed

as a result of an idea originated by NOSENKO himself shortly

after

he

arrived in the U.S. Embassy Section.

Because of

the iraccessibility of American code clerks to the KGB in

Moscow, It was JOSEiKO's plan to send a KGB officer to liel-

sinks in order to strike up an acquairtance with a code

clerk entering the Soviet Union aboard the Helsinki-yoscow

train.

The first (ard last) time this was attempted, NO-

SENKO related, was in March 1960, when the KCB learned that

JENNER, listed as a "secretary-archivist" and thus assumed

by thie?

KGB to be a code clerk,

was scheduled to transit

Holsinki en routr. to his assignsent at the ü.S. Embassy in

Under NOSENKO'S supervision KOSOLAPOr therefore

travrlled to Helsinki and boarded the same train as JENNER.'

Additionally, GRINNOV took a KGB female agert to the town,

of ryborg, on the Finno-Soviet border, and placed her on the

samE: train.

Botn KOSOLAPOV and the Somale agent met and

spoke with JENNER en route to l'oscow, and the girl gave him

her telephone number, asking hia to call her.

Aftor JANER'S

arrival in Moscow,

both KOSOLAPOV and GRYAZNOV subnitted

vritten reports to JOSENKO describing the contacts on the

train.

Although the KGB later found out that JENNER was only

a pouch clerk,

not a cryptographer, he was cunsidered of

interest and when JENNER failed to telephone the female

agent, the two were brought together in a

"chance neeting"

at the doscow airport.

JanER would have no part of the

agent's invitations, however, and the operation therefore

went no, further.

*When NOSENKO was told of the GOLITSYN visit in May or June

1960, he denled that it took place, sajing that he reces-

sarily would know if it had.

the Holgink1-110scon train.

He alsu reported having boen

given a tol phone nuther by the girl and later reported

having been recontacted by her at the boscow airport.

NOSENKO identified KOLOSOV's photograph as that

of his subordinate KOSOLAPO!.

(NOSENKO earlier said that

he did not know whether KOSOLAPOV used an alins for this

trip, what that alias might have been, or whether KOSOLAPOV

had an alias passport; he agreed that he would have had to

authorize such a passport.)

When he was told of ClA evidence

that KOSOLAPOV did not travel on the same train as JENNER

and therefore could not have met and talked with him as

JOSENKO had reorted, NOSENKO relused to believe it; he in-

sistrd that he had read the reports of both KOSOLIPOV and

GRYAZNOY, and that the events were exactly as he described

them.

(111) The GARLAID Case

1:6:

i..

GOLITSYN told CIA after his defection that while he was

stationed in Helsinki, probabl; in November--not March --1960,

KOSOLAPOV travelled to Finland under alias and commercial

cover in order to make the acquaintance of an American code

clerk on the

Helsinki-joscow train.

KOSOLAPOV's arrival had

beca announced by a cable from KGB Headquarters to the

Helsinki Legal Residercy.

According to GOLITSTi, the Legal

Residency learned which train this American was

to board and

succecded in placing KOSOLIPOV in the same compartment with

him.

GOLITSYN saw KUSOLAPOV board the train with this Aueri-

can.

later, when another American Department officer visited

Helsirki, COLITSYN asked him how KOSOLAFUV's operation with

the code

clerk had gone; fron the officer's refusal to answer,

GOLITSYN assumed that it had been a success.

KOSOLAPUV made & second

trip to Helsinki in Novender 1960, again under the KOLOSOV

KOSOLAPOV left

Helsinki by train on 16 Novenber 1960 and that one

travelling companions on this train was GARLAND,

en route to Moscow to assume his duties as chief of the

State Department code room at the American Embassy (Page

198). There were no other Americans on this train.

Told that KOSOLAPOV had made a trip to Helsinki in

November 1960 and had travelled to Moscow on the same train

an American code clerk, one of his on targets, NOSENKO

said that this could not be.

He agreed that, as in the case

Of KOSOLAPOY's trip to meet JENNER, he would necessarily

have been involved in the planning of such a second trip

and would have had to approve arrangements and correspondence

in cunnection with it.

Even if such a trip took place wher

NOSENKO was out of lloscow, he said, the details of it would

have beon known to him upon his return, and he would not

have

forkotten about the trip.

(In fact, CIA travel records show

that KOSOLAPOV arrived in Helsinki on 12 Novcaber 1960 and

that JOSENKO left Moscow for Ansterdam, en route to Cuba,

on 15 jovember.) NOSENKO has not changed his position that

there was no such trip.

(1v) The MORONE Caso

• Like the STORSBERG operation, the MORONE case was Bea-

tloned at NOSENXO's first meeting with CIA; he cited 1t as

an examplo of a technique which YOSENKO introduced for using

third nationals to obtain accessto American code clerlis ubo

were reluctant to establish contacts with Soviet citizens.

Accordirg to NOSENKO's most recent version, given in early

1965, the KGB learned that MORONE and a Marine Guard (BEGGS)

planned to travel to larsaw on leave.

KOSOLAPOV thereupon

drew up an operational plan, edited by NOSEVO and KOVSKUY

and approved by GRIBANOV, proposing that a ferale agent of

the Polish UB be introduced to MOROlE on the joscow to war-

saw train for the purpose of obtaining comprorising naterials.

KOSOLAPOV arranged with Polish liaison officials in Moscow

to have such an agent sent to Muscow, net her when she

arrived, and briefed her on the upcration.

She was then

placed

On MORONE's train together with a KGB techniciar.

whose task it was to obtain tape recordings of the compro

ud se.

Events went according to plan:

MORONE. "et the girl

and was intinate with tor on the train, but when the tech-

niciar. reported to NOSENKO the day after the train arrived

in Harsaw, he said

that the tape recordlugs were of low

quality and unsuitable for their intended purpose.

In a

further attempt to acquire conploaking material on MORONE,

KOSOLAPUV later brought the UB agent to Moscow, and on this

occasion plotographs were obtained of their intimacies in

a doscow

hotel

rOOm.

Still, the KGB felt, there was not

rhough blackmail matcrial to ensure recruitment, and it was

further planned to have the America House maid IVANOVA

attempt to lure MORONE to a roun in Moscow where truly

compraising photographs of intimacies with a Soviet citi

zen could be obtained.

Possibly because they noticed MORONE'S

interest in IVAJOVA,

NOSE:KO said, the Americans ordered

VORONE out of Moscow before further steps could be takes.

Although NOSENKO provided a considerable amount of

detail on MORONE's trip to Warsaw,

there were numerous

variationg in his different accounts.

In 1962 he said

that he had handled the entire operation himself,

including

telephoning tarsaw with the request for the girl; he also

said that the UB obtained compromising photographs in Warsaw

and that several nonths latei the female agent was brought

to Moscow expressly for the purpose of introducing MORONE to

a Suviet girlfriend.

This, NOSENKO said, was successful and

abile

still in place in Geneva on 1 February 1964 NOSENKO gave a

different version:

"Re," he said, arranged for the girl by

& dispatch pouched to the KGB advisor in Warsaw; moreover,

the Poles,

who had obtained compromising photographs in Mar-

Saw, sent the KGB only pictures of the two kissing, keeping

the best ones for themselves,

and this is thy she had to be

brought to boscow.

NOSENKO told the FBI later in February

1964 that compromising photographs had been obtained in War-

sau but no recruitment was attempted because KHRUSHCHEV had

States.

When in February 1365 it was pointed out that MOPONE

arrived in Harsad on 14 December

1960 and that NOSENKO left

for Cuba on 15 Nevember 1950, NOSENKO revised his story of

receiving the peisonal report of the technician to say that

he had perhaps read the technician's report after returning

from Cuba in vecember

1960.

Fecords show, horever, that MoRoNE left Moscow

on 13 November 1960, arriving in Warsaw on the l4th; from

NOSENKO, the officer

on 15 November 1960 with a dele-

gation goirg to cuba.

NOSENKO has been questioned concerning the KGB agents

in contact with MORONE and what was learned

from then. He

reported that an Egyptian agent visited inerica House, met

MORONE there,

but did not report anything of interest

con-

cerning hin.

NOSEIXO also mentioned IVANOVA, a said

at

America House, who knew MORONE and whom the iGB wanted to use

to lure MOPONE into a compromising situation. (see above).

NOSENKO said that he, himself, had net with IVANOVA several

times to discuss MORONE, but that he could not recall azy-

thing specific of interest or use that she reported concerning

have had direct contact with an American stationed in dos-

(NOSENKO said on ong uccasion that this was the only

free-tu-lace encounter he could recall;

and,

on another,

that it was possible that SlURSEFRG--the onl; other possibility--

may not have seen his on the nijht he was approached in the

KEYSERS therefore is the only independent

Americas solice ho could confirm that OSENKO was involved

NOSESKO hinself pollited out, horever, that this cor-

tact was of very short duration, and that it was possible

trat KEYSERS would not recognize him.

This was the case:

KEYSERS failed to identily NOSENKO's photograph and described

the officer no approached him as a man considerably older,

and probably of a much heavier build than NUSEKO

Although YOSESKO was able to provide a descriptio? of

this incident, he did not know much about the overall KGB

case against KEYSERS and a number of discrepancies have been

He said that, in fact, KEYSERS

(Thus HOSENKO had forgotten the name of the one

In Pebruary 1965 NOSENKO said that the KGB belleved

that KEYSERS did not report the receipt of the defection

letter and that there was no indication that he had from

microphones

or telephone coverage of the U.S. Enbassy.

In

fact, KEŸSERS reported the letter at once in the office of

NOSENKO did not know correctly where or how the KGB

delvered to KEYSERS the letter which preceded the airport

approach which NOSEKO claimed to have made.

(vi). Other Code Clerk Cases

Frark DAY:

NOSESKO identified DAY as &

State Departuent

code

clers and the target of either KOSOLAPOV or GRYAZNOV.

As with all other code clerks, NOSENKO was asked whether he

knew of any interesting irfornation about DAY, whether be

knew of any

Of DAY's friends in Moscow, or of his travels

inside and outside the Soviet Union, etc.

SOSENKO answered

"no" to all these questions.

He said that the KGB had no

derogatory information on DAY, was unarare of any vulner-

abilities he might have had, and that no

operational mes-

sures were taken against hin.

Records show that DAY was in

Moscow fros ¿ay 1960 to October 1961:

velled to

Caucasus with his friend, the U.S. Agricul

tural Attache BROWN,

later reported that the two were under surveillance by five

persons at all times on this trip,

that on ore occasion they

found four "repairaen" in their hotel room upon returning

unexpectedly ahead of schedule, and that another time during

'attractive and available Soviet fenale" was

placed in their train compartment.

code clerk ard the target of KOSOLAPOY.

NOSENKO did not

ground information the KGB might have had about hin.

described an operation against TAYLOR wnich centered around

his intinacy with a Russian maid (a KGB agent) and his sym

pathy towards the Soviet Union

and its people.

No compro-

mising photographs were obtained of TAYLOR and the mald,

however, and no approach was made to him, possibly because

did not want to jeopardize the more important STORS-

BERG case by creating a "flap." According to TAYLOR, he was

intimate witn his maid fron about September 1960 until the

beginning of 1961.

On one occasion they were intimate 1o a

"friend's apartment" in Moscow.

J. Responsibility of Supervising Military Attache Operationg

On 29 January 1965 NOSEAXO told his interrogator that

for the first five or s1x sonths of 1960, Immediatoly after

transferring to the U.S. Embassy Soction and as part of his

responsibilitles as 119 Deputy Chlo!, he supervised Second

Chief Directorato activitlos against American service at-

taches in koscow.

Ey this ho meant, NOSE'KO said, that when

GAVRILENKO (the Case OffICer for Air Force Attaches),

KURILENKO (Army Attaches), or BELOGLAZOV (Naval Attaches and

Marines) had

any questions of reports to submit, they would

come to his rathor than to KOVSHUK, the Chief of the section,

about six months he wag relieved of tbis duty because

his other duties did not allow sufficient time for this

function and because it was considered more suitable that

ALESHIN, recently assigned to the American Department as

Deputy Chief, be given this responsibility.

NOSENXO had previously been questloned in detail on

his resposibilities in the U.S. Embassy Section, and had never

bofore mentioned this one.

JOSEKO told CI.' in June 1964

that when he reported for duty in the U.S. Egbassy Section

k. IDY to Bulgaria and the LUNT Case

In the spring of 1361, NOSENKO said, four nonths after

returning fron Cuba, he was told unexpectedly that in about

a week's time he would leave for bulzaria to consult with

the Arerican Departuent of the Bulgarian MVR corcerning

operations against the Anerican Legation in Sofia

(Pages

279-283)•

NOSENKO flew to Sofia in early April 1961, where

he was net by A.S. HOLLOV,

an advisor there and a forker

employee of the Second Chief Directorate whom NOSEYXO had

known at KGB Headquarters.

NOSENKO remained in Bulgaria

until about the middle of May:

while there he discussed

matters and particular

cases with the Bul-

garians, gave

several lectures on operations against Aneri-

can installations and personnel as well as against tourists,.

and finally

directed the successful homosexual operation

against the American Professor LUST.

Aside from being told that he would be advising che

Bulgarian service on operations against Americans at the

Legation in Sofia, NOSENKO auparently received no prepara

tion for this trip.

He said in answer to specific questions

that nobody told him what he was supposed to discuss with

the Bulgarians, that he did not meet with the Bulgarian

liaison representatives in Moscon before leaving, and that

ie knew nothing of the organication, personnel, area of

responsibility, or problems of the

Arerican Departmert of

the Bulgarian service before arriving in Sofia.

NOSENKO was selected for this mission despite the fact

that he was extremely busy with his duties in the U.S. Erbassy

Section (see above

discussion of his responsibilities for

code clerks, ABIDIAN, and the military attaches) and despite

the fact that KOLLOV was

permanently assigned

as an advisor

in Sofia.

POSENKO described KOZLOV in another context as a

"very experienced officer" and has said that KOZLOY was. Chief

of the American Departeent until 1953 and then from June 1955

until sometime in 1958 was Deputy Chief of the Tourist De:

partment, Second Chief Directorate.

(KOZLOV, assisted by

NOSENKO, had recruited BURG! in June 1956.)

Asked why KOZLOV

could not have advised the Bulgarians, NOSENKO said that he

was too busy advising on higher levels and had been away

from active operations in Moscow too long.

NOSENKO gave only a general description of his duties.

as an advisor on operations against the American Legation.

On the other hand, he accidentally became involved

in a homo-.

sexual ertrapnent operation against an American tourist sho

was visiting Bulgaria, and he has described this operation

in considerable detail.

(NOSENKO's previous speciality was

tourist operations, particularly those involving homosexual

compromise.)

NOSENKO's story about his role in the LUNT case changed

greatly between 1962 and 1964.

I. Transfer to the Tourist Department

Of GRIBINOV's decision to pronote hinto the position of

Deputy Chief of the eatire American Department:

JOSENKO. -=

however, knew that his chief and friend KOVSHUr ranted the

Job. and that FEDOSEYEV (Chief of the Department) also favored

KOVSHUK for this position.

Realizing that his own appoini-

ment would therefore place him in a difficult position ard

wighing to avoid this, SOSENKO spoke to the Chief of the

Tourist Department, CHELSOKOV, about returning there. At

CHELSOKOV'6 SUGGeStIOn, NOSENKO went to GRIBAYOV with the

request to be returned to the Tourist Departuent as Chief

of the American Tourist Section, with the understadding that

he would be rade Deputy Chief of the fourist Department

upon the retirement of the incumbent. BALDIN, in July 1962.

To this GRIBANOV

agreed.

NOSENKO said that GRIBINOV did

not discuss with himhis reasons for wanting to appoint him

Deputy Chief of the American Department or for appointing

him Chief of the American Tourist Section, nor did he discuss

with JOSENKO his personal requirements for these positions.

On one occasion,

in early 1965, NOSENKO said that it was

because GRIBANOY "thought I was a tough guy, a good case

officer.

In 1959 I saw hin often and

was involved in a lot.

of questiors which vere reported to him."

According to

his most recent version, NOSENKO was officially trangferred

fron the American Department at the end of December 1951

and reported

for duty in the Tourist Department on about

3 January 1962.

KOVSHLK, who was also a candidate for the job as Deputy

Chief of the

the Soviet Union in 1959: Furthermore, NOSENKO's perfor-

mance as Deputy Chief of the U.S. Embassy Section. as he

admitted under interrogation, was "not good."

NOSENKO has given many contradictory dates for his

transfer to the Tourist Department.

at various times that this took place in January 1962 and

In February 1962: in 1964 he tined the transfer as falling

D. Remarks

For no single responsibility has NOSENKO substantiated

his alleged service as Deputy Chief of the U.S. Embassy

Section in the years 1960-1961.

His statements about the

appointsent to and transier fron this position have been

Inconsistent; bis comparatively narrow experience and his

acknowledged falschoods about a persodel relationship

with

the Chief of the KGB Second Chief Directorate, GRIBANOV,

dispel the likelihood that those personnel asgiganents were

made in the way be claims.

Repeatedly he has been contra-

dictory about his activities during this two-year perlod,

shifting his story to suit the occasion and ignoring bou

each succeeding version nade all of his claius increaglogly

¡acredible.

The limited extent of NOSENKO's information

betrays a lack of faniliarity with detalls on the duties,

targets,

and most of the operations which he has ascribed

to hirself; in a certain few instances, however, such as

his description of ABIDIAN's route to

the Pushkin Street dead

drop, he has recounted events jugt as they are known fron

other sources to have occurred.

Nevertheless, where col-

lateral information has covered the few subjects on which

he provided derails, it has almost invarlably contradicted

bim and showed his to be ignorant of significant facts.

The reporting by HOSENKO thus was 5o

superficial._so in-

and so demonstrably erroneous ag to suggest without

reservation that he never cerved as an. officer. in the u.S.

Embassy Séction, zuch less as its Deputy Chief..

All avail-

able evidence, excluding that from certain Soviats who were

CIA and FBI sources (see Parto VIII.H. and VII.I. below),

combines to formulate this conclusion.

7. Tourist department (1962-1964)

a. Introduction

NOSLUKO agreed during the interrogations at che beginning

of 1965 that he must have reported for duty as Chief of the

American Tourist Section on about 3 January 1952.*

In tris

job he was responsible

for pianning and supervising KGB acti-

vities against all tourists of Anerican, British, and Caradian

nationalities arrivirg in the UssR, and

his duties also encon-

passed preparations fur the coming tourist season (Pages 295-

287).

In July 1962, in conformity with GRIbANUV's intentions,

NOSENKO was pronoted to the position of Deputy Chief of the

entire Tourist Department; it had a taule of organization o!

to 100 staff officers, was responsible for handlarg overa-

tions against all tourists to the Soviet Union, and mairtined

used in these operations.

A year later NOSENKO

received the title of First Deputy Chief of the Departnert, a

"paper" pronotion as there was no other deputy.

During this

pericd in the Tourist Department, in addition to his supervi-

iconcerning which he has not been questioned in

detail), NOSEliKO took personal part in approaches to several

tourists, organized and directed the arrest of an American

tourist on horosexual charges, and met wich a number of agents.

It was his serior supervisory position that involied him in two

of the nost widely publicized cases of this pericd, the arrest

Of BARGHOORN and the case of OSWALi.

b. ibse:ices from Moscow

During

his two years in the Tourist Department, NOSENKO

was available to perform his assigned duties only part of the

time. After arriving in the American Tourist Section and after

the approach to JOHNSON on 5 January 1962, NOSENKO spent sev-

eral weeks

"getting the feel" of things by talking to case offi-

cers, reviewing reports of the section's activities during the

previous tro years,

and discussing plans for the up-coning tour-

ist season.

In mid-February he began preparations for his

assign-

ment to Gereva with the Disarmament Delegation.

NOSENKO has

...-

said that this involved discussions with the Eleventh Depart-

ment of the Second Chief Directorate, responsible for arranging

for security coverage of Soviet delegations going abroad, as

well as with the case officers responsible for the irvestigation

of suspected American agent SIlAKHOV.

NOSENKO said that he did

this on a part-time basis in addition to his regular duties,

but has lited in another context that these preparations required

sufficient time to make it impossible for him to take a personal

part in the recruituent of BIENSTOCK ir. February 1962.

15 March 1962, NOSENKO arrived in Geneva, remaining

there with

the delegation until 15 June, when he left Geneva by train to

to Moscow to reassume

his duties as Chief of Section.

He said that he had no deputy chief in this position, and it

is unclear who performed these functions in his absenca.

according to NOSENKO's account, of the six months he was Chief

" This date was settled upon after he acknowledged that his

approach to the American tourist W.E. JOHNSON must have

occurred on 5 January. as CIA records show.

The W.E. JCHNSO: Provocation

JOHNSON (Pages 289-293), NOSEKO said, was in Moscow as

a tourist in early January 1902 ard was considered for recruit-

ment, but

a decision was

made that he was not worth the effort

as he had no access to clissifies materiuls and lived too far

from the KGB Legal Residencies in rashirigton and lew York city.

(JCHNSON's home was in Texas.)

Several days after this deci-

sion vas

made, postal interceprs showed that JCINSON was writing

abusive letters concerning

ine Soviet Union.

They were "so

bitter"

and critical that the Kod decided that something had

to be done to stop him.

At abuit the sane

time the KGB received

an indication that JOHiO was a runosexual, ard it was decided

to entrap him

on this basis and furce him to promise not to

write any more letters or criticizo the USSR in articles

when

he returned to

the United States.

The compromise was effected

by use of NOSEnko's homoserual agents, and NOSENKO was able to

describe the confrortation scene, his second meeting with JOHN-:

SON; and JOHNSON's frigatened telephore call to the U.S. Enbassy

reporting that NOSENKO had recortacted him.

NOSENKO told CIA in June 1962 that he had taken part in

this operation

"In January."

name and the date "5 January 1962, "Which was noted JOHNSON's

of the approach, but NOSENKO insisted that the date bore no

cause he wore no overcoat.

It was only when confronted with

official U.S. records that NOSENKO agreed in early 1965 that

the apprcach was in January and recalled that it was made

immediately after NOSENKO returned to che Tourist Department.*

NOSENKO said that when JOHNSON first arrived in Moscow

there was consideration of recruiting him, but that there was

a decision against this as he was of little intelligence value.

Then JOHNSON mailed insulting letters which were picked up

through postal intecept. About the sane time there were indi-

cations of homosexuality.

Then the operation was mounted

CPSU Central Committee and ceased agent work.

Altreigh she

was inactive, NOSENKO continued to be registered as ¿er case

officer until 1964, when he defected.

(1) PRIPPEL

Having left his assignment in Moscow in early 1951, FRIPPEL

(Pages 129-133' and' Part VIII.D.5.) returned several tines to

the soviet Union in 1962 and 1963.

NOSENKO, who remained his

case officer although FRIPIEL now lived and worked in New York

City, met him each time.

FRIPPEL said there were three such

occasions, in February 1962 when he net once with liOSEiKO and

CHELNOKOV

in Odessa, and two later times in Moscow and Odessa,

when NOSENKO came alone.

NOSENKO denied that he

met PRIPPEL

in Odessa in February 1962 with CHELNOKOV, but said that he met

twice with him alone after returning to Moscow from Geneva.

The first of these meetings was in the gurmer of 1962 when

FRIP-

PEL was accompanying

a group of American newspaper editors tour-

ing the Soviet Union:

FRIPPEL said NOSENKO called briefly at

his hotel room to enquire what questions the editors planned

to ask KHRUSHCHEV during a planned interview.

When FRIPPEL

said he did not know, NOSENKO departed and FRIPPEL later re-

ported that he did not see NOSENKO again on this trip.

(NOSENKO

said he called again after the interview to learn the

"reactions"

of the editors.)

The second meeting was in Odessa, when FRIPPEL,

visited the Soviet Union as a guide on a tour ship. According

to FRIPPEL,

it was on this occasion that NOSENKO apparently made

a phone call to ask permission to go aboard FRIPPEL's ship, and

It might have been at this meeting or the earlier one that

NOSENKO told him something of his personal background.

(FRIPPEL

knew a considerable amount of information about NOSENKO's father

and family.) NOSENKO denied the possibility that he would have

to request permission to board the vessel and said that if he

had told FRIPPEL anything about himself, it was when! he was

drunk.

Both FRIPPEL and NOSENKO agreed that FRIPPEL provided

no information of value during any of these meetirgs..

(11) SVENCHANSKIY

NOSENKO has cited SVENCHANSKIY, KGB cryptonym "ANOD," as

an example of the Second Chief Directorate's use of foreign

travel agents to signal the KGB when an interesting tourist is

about to visit the Soviet Union (Pages 295-298).

SVENCHANSKIY

was recruited for this purpose, NOSENKO said, in 1961 and used

to send open-code signals to the Tourist Department by marking

visa applications whenever he spotted anything significant.

Some of SVENCHANSKIY's signals had been, considered, NOSENKO

said, "of definite operational interest."

NOSENKO took the case over from the previous handling officer,

NOSKOV,

and his name was listed in SVENCHANSKIY'} file as the

responsible officer.

NOSENKO first said that he had read SVENCHANSKIY's file

then changed this to say that he had only skimmed it.

later in the year.

On both

occasions, NOSROV was present.

NOSETTO said that at the tine SVENCHANSKIY das recruited

in 1961 that, because SVENCHANSKIY was known to have had con-

tacts with AUTORS ir. New York,

there was some suspicion that

he might be an FBI agent. NOSENKO was unable to be more pre-

cise as to the basis for these suspicions ard, when asked how

NOSKOV had resolved them, was able to say only tha: NOSKOV

"felt" that SVENCHANSKIY

was not an Anerican agent.

NOSENKO Knew little about SVENCHANSKIY's baciground from

the one-volume file kept on him in the tourist Department:

He

did know that SVENCHANSKIY was recruited in 1961 on the promise

of commercial favors, that he had at one tine been detected

in blackmarket transactions in the USSR, and that in addition

to his travel agency, SVENCHANSKIY ran a Russian-language book-

store in Chicago.

PBI and CIA records show that SVENCHANSKIY

has been employed by a series of registered Soviet Government

organizations in the United States since the early 1930's,

that he was released from his position as a United ations radio

officer broadcasting to the Soviet Union in 1952 when he failed

to answer questions of the Senate Interral Security Committee

concerning

alleged subversive activity, and that both his travel

agency ard his book store are affiliated with registered Sov-

¡et agencies,

Inturist and Mechkniga.

Allegations on file of

SVENCHANSKIY's Communist sympathies and probable Soviet espion-

age activities date back to

the second World war.

Sonya worked for SVENCHANSKIY in New York, but said that she

is not a KGB agent and was not the one who marked the visa

applications.

e. The OSWALD Investigation

NOSENKO

said, he was directiy irvolved in the investigation of OSWALD's

activities in Minsk which was ordered after the assassination

of President KENNEDY (Pages 136-144 and Part VIII.D.5.).

is from his role at this time and his reading of the Minsk KGB

file on OSWAID that NCSENKO derived his authority to state that

the KGB "washed its hands of OSALD" after his attempted sui-

cide in the USSR, that there was no attempt to recruit either

OSWALD or his wife, and that KGB interest in OSWALD while he

lived in Minsk was restricted to passive observation.

g. Remarks

Leaving

visory jobs in the Tourist Departnent in 1962-1953, when he

indicated he was absent frow KGB Headquarters nearly half of

the tine, his persoral rose in operations and investigations

plausible in others.

E. Examination of other Aspecto of NOSENKO's Biography

1. KGB Awards ant Ranks

a. Awards

At various times since contacting CIA in 1962, NOSENKO

described a series of awards and decorations which

he received

over the years

for his parformance of duties in the Second Chief

Directorate

(Pages 313-321).

le claired to have received the

Order of Lenin, the Order of the Red Star, and the Order of the

Red Banner, he said he received a special

commendation fron

KGB

Chairman SEROV for nis role in the BURGI recruitment and

the same award in 1959 for his recruitment of all of the Ameri..

can or British tourists recruited that year by

the KGB (three

American homosexuals).

NOSENKO told of a

number of other conmerdations which he received--almost one

year--for his

"general good work."

In October 1966 NOSENKO

said that he never received any awards for his KGB operational

performarce, only a medal for satisfactory completion of 10

years of KGB service and a Red Arny anniversary medal.

b. Ranks

NOSENKO's descriptions of his various rark promotions fol-

low a similar but more complicated pattern (Pages 322-326).

He has given

trio

separate sets of circumstances

for his.first

promotion, from junior lieutenant to lieutenant.

According to

the first of these, the one NOSENKO adhered to during 1964 and

1965,

he was prototed to che rank of lieutenant while serving

in the far East with the raval GRU at the beginning of 1951.

NOSENKO explained

that the required time in grade is sometimes

cut in half

for officers serving at this undesirable post, and

that this is why he

was promoted after only six months of

active duty.

In 1966 NOSENKO gaid for the first time that he

did rot enter on active duty until March 1951 and that his

promotion to lieutenant was in mid-1952, while stationed in

Sovetsk, on the Baltic.

In all his accounts, NOSENKO has said

that he

entered the KGB with the ank of lieutenant as this

had been his rank in the naval GrU.*

During his first meetings with CIA in Geneva during 1962

NOSENKO claimed then to be a KGB major and said that he had

already completed the necessary time in grade for a lieutenant

colonelcy.

gave an apparently accurate description

of the structure of his salary as a

major (so nuch for rank,

so much for longevity, etc.) and pointed out that he was fill-

ing a position (Chief of Section) normally held by a lieutenant

On contacting CIA again in 1964, NOSENKO claimed the

rank of lieutenant colonel.

He supported this claim with the

TDY authorization issued for the CHEREPANOV search, " which

gave NOSENKO's rank as lieutenant colone! and vas signed by

GRISkiOV himself and testified to it by his signalure on the

"official biographical statement" prepared in Frankfurt.

The first major change in NOSENKO's story of his promo-

tions cane durirg the interrogations of january 1965 wnen he

volunteered out of context and for no clear Icagon that he had

never held the rani of major but rather, because of a series

of administrative slip-ups and GRIBliOV's advis: and help, haà

jumped directly from the rark of caprain, which

ho received

in 1956, to the rank of lieutenant coionel in I:to 1963.

NOSENKO was later to claim that he had never said

in 1962 tha:

he las a major."

In an unsolicited statelent given to cIA i April 1966,

NOSENKO wrole that he was only a captain and that the TDY authori-

zation for the CHEREPNSOY search had been filled out in error.

c. ¡emarks

NOSENKO's admissions regarding his awirds and pionotions

directly affect his self-portraiture as a successfu! and rapidly

rising KG3 officer.

They also have a bearing

of the

alleged reasons for this rise Clientsan

presented the chard to resenko.

The

same is true

moted circotly from senior lieutenant to major in 1959; when

Department made a mistare an

2. Affiliation with Communist parti Organs

a. Introduction

NOSENKO drifted into the komsomo:, he said, in 1943 or

1944 without giving the step any thoight whatsoever.

all of

his friends at the Baku school were joining, so NOSENSO did

too.

He remained an Indifferent member of

this

Communist

youth organization throughout his school and university years,

and during his first year as a KGB officer.

Ог.

arriving in the U.S. Embassy Section of the American Depart-

ment in 1953, NOSENKO told CIA, he was appointed secretaly of

the small Komsomol organization of the Second Chief Director-

ate, a group of about 17 members.

b. Discussion

NOSENHO was questioned by DERYABIN on his duties as Kom-

somol Secretary (Pages 623) and, although able to give a super-

ficial account of these functions, was fourd to be unaware of

certain basic information which DERYABIN felt a person

in this

positior.

should have.

Thus, for example, NOSLiKO provided a

description of the system of levying dues on konsomol mambers

which was substantially incorrect and was unavare that a kom-

somol Congress (the first in sany years and therefore a major

event) had been hold during his claimed tenure as secretary.

NOSENKO said that he held the position of Komosmol Organi-

zation Secretary

until the late spring or early summer of 1954,

when he got into trouble for naving used official KGB alias

documentation to conceal the fact that he received treatent

for venereal disease contracted from a prostitute.

Immediately

after

this incident, said NOSENKO, he was removed

from nis

position

and a

"strict reprimand"

was placed in his Kom-

sorel file.

Several months thereafter, on the eve of his 27th

birthday, NOSENKO was forced out of the Konsonol because he was

too old.

For over a year, until January 1956 when NOSEliKO was

admitted as a candidate member of the Cormurist Party of the

Soviet Union. he was the orly officer in the KGB who was neither

a Komsorol nor a

Party member.

LOSENKO's accourt of his expul-

sion

fron the Konso=ol

on reaching his lith birthday is con-

tradicted by the official Statutes of the Konsonol in effect

at that time.

These regulations stipulate a maximum age of

25 years and

NOSENKO should therefore have beer forced out at

the

end of October 1953, upon reaching his 26th birthday.

This

was explained to HOSENKO, biho

insisted that he remained a member

until he became 27 years old and that no special exceptions

were made in his case.

c. Remarks

The fact that NOSENKO is incorrect regarding the age limi-

tation sakes

it doubtful that his account of the venereal

disease incident and his removal from the Komsomol Secretary-

ship is true.

The date which he gives to this incident is

after that on which he should have been expelled from the Kom-

(Additionally, NOSENKO's descriptions of the veneral

disease incident, his

use of false documents, and his subsequent

punishaent by the KGB and the Komsomol have been inconsistent:

3. Schooling

a. Irtroduction

There is relatively little reliable collateral irformation

concerning

NOSENKO's schooling up until 1950.

Other than what

he himself has reported, available information consists of over!!

press releases pertaining to the Minister NOSENKO's career land

giving his location at various times) and comments by one KGB

officer and one defector.

NOSENKO's own account, together with

references to these other sources, is summarized below.

With the exception of minor variations in dates, attrlbut-

able to memory, NOSENKO's. story of his early years until the

• beginning of World War II, when he had just completed the sixth

grade ir. Moscow, has been generally consistent in its varioug

tellirgs.

Moreover, his accourts of having studied in Lenin-

grad and Moscow agree with information concerning the positions

and movements of the elder NOSeiko during these years.

In con-

trast,

the period immediately following, during which NoSENKO

allegedly received his early training in naval matters is char-

acterized with frequent changes of story, contradictions, and

admitted falsehood.

b. Discussion

In 1968 and 1965 HOSENKO recalled that he enrolled in the

Moscow special naval school in the summer of 1941, immediately

after the Germans attacked the Soviet Union, and was evacuzled

with the entire school from Moscow to Kuybyshev in September

to begir. studies in the seventh grade.

(As article in tre Sou-

Let Arny newspaper Kragnaya Zvezda (Red Star) on 14 Jeruary 1967

confirmed that seven special naval schools were established in

the Soviet Union in April 1940.

Ore of these was in Moscow.

However, to be eligible for admission, one had to have completedi

the seventh grade. The article did not indicate that the Moscow

school was evacuated.) In April 1966, NOSENKO remembered that

he did not go to Kuybyshey at this time but rather had been

evacuated so Chelyabinsk with his mother and entered the seventh

grade of a regular school.

In keeping with his respective accounts, NOSENKO said in

secured admission to the Leningrad Naval Preparatory

with which he was evacuated by train to taxu in

the fall of that year.

In April 1966, after Inserting the year

spent at Chelyabinsk with his mother, NOSENKO moved all events

up a year and wote in his autobiography that he enterca the

Kuybyshev school in the fall of 1942 rather than the fall of

NOSENKO also wrote at this time that he transferred to

the leningrad preparatory school and travelled to Baku in the

fall of 1943, not 1942.*

" Describing the reasons for his transfer to the Leningrad Naval

Preparatory School, HOSENKO explained that the Moscow special

scrool was evacuated further to Achinsk in Siberia and

that this was farther from home than he wished to go.

Red Star article mentioned above said that the special naval

schools were all closed in

The special school

•apparently therefore was not transferred further to Achinek,

but was shut down.

accounts of his escape from school

to join the soviet front against the Germans at Tuapse; now he

admitted thet this was a lie.

By cuttirg the time he was in

Baxu from 1s months to about three, MUSENKO also admitted im-

plicitly that his accounts of the basic trainirg he received

in the preparatory school, of the summer he spert working at

the school rather than returning to Moscow on vacatic., ard of

his "certainty" that he celebrated his 15th birthday in Baku

were also false.

NOSINKO has been relatively consistent in recounting the

events of 1944.

In 1964, 1965 and again in 1366 he told of

studying as an external"

student in yoscow to complete his

ninth year of schooling and of rejoining his classmates from

Baku when the naval preparatory school returned to Lenirgrad

in the autumn of 1÷44.

On

several occasiong during 1964 and

1965, NOSENKO described how he and his classmates spent October

and November 1944 working in the woods near 'Ler.ingrad before

beginning their terth grade studies late in the

year; he omitted

this account from nis April 1966 autobiography.

NOSENKO's account of the next years is similarly marked

with a rumber of inconsistencies and falsehoods.

(In the

latter category he has claimed and later admitted as untrue that

he atterded

the Frunze Haval Academy

from 1943

to 1244, that

he was on active military duty until being demovilized

in 1915,

and that he was shot ir the hand by a jealous young

naval offi-

cer in 1945.)

According to the account given under interroga-

tion in April 1964, NOSE:KO was shot in

the hand at a party in

the end of April 1945, was hospitalized, resigned

from the

preparatory school, and received a certificate of satisfactory

completion of the

tenth

grade, although he had been in school

only since November 1944.

In 1965 and 1966 NOSENKO said, re-

spectively, that he was shot by a naval officer in february

or March

1945

and that he shot hinself in

"early" 1945; since

the 1964 interrogations he has claimed only that he received

a statement of the courses he had attended at the preparatory

school and that he completed the tenth grade at the Shipbuild-

ing Tekhnikum in Leningrad.

P. Appraisals of NOSENKO, his Motivation, and Other Opera-

Fional Circunstances

1. Introduction

Appraisals of NOSENKO the uan and of his notivationg

must be founded, as with any source, on lactors which are

often immeasureable, but fever reservations need be attached

to an appraigal of the other circunstances allecting the

course of events in Geneva in 1982 and 1964.

These opera-

tional circumstances can be analyzed.and evaluated in much

and

blography for they are tangible pleces of evidence.

In the

next portions of this paper are

presented these appraisals,

which draw chiefly upon Pages 603-641 (for NOSENKO the man),

Pages 20-29 (for his motivations), and Pazes 11-19 and 30-

43 (for the operational circustances).

2. NOSENKO

The CIA specialists who assessed NOSENKO foubd hin to

be of above-average intelligence, one of them sayiog that

"his effoctive intelligence is nore cleverness than intel-

lectuality, more shrewduess than efficlency."

of good menory and, as illustraled ba bis repeating certain

numerous internal cöntradictious in NOSENKO's recountings

of varlous events, he himself claimed an odd or poor menory,

debriefed within a rolatively short period.

Parts VII.D. and VIII.E. discuss NOSENKO's truthfulness

with reference to his Soviet

Intelligence ard

personal

backgrounds.

Here may be added other observations by the

CIA specialists:

NOSENKO can exercise deception cleverly,

he improvised

was evasive under interrogation, and he

has & "renarkable" disregard for the truth where it serves

his purposes.

The results of the polygraph examination were

that NOSENKO "attempted deliberate deception."

The gaps and errors in, NOSENKO's testinony therefore

do not seem attributable to

low intelligence or to consis-

tently poor memory, but to a couscious attempt to mislead

Independently, then, this conclusion

raises the questions of whether NOSENKO vas dispatched by

the KGB and 11

so, why he was chosen.

Regarding the latter

point, it 1s noted that a CIA csychiatrist observed:

"This

man is capable

of playing a role and playing it effectively,"

and that a CIA psychologist stated:

3. Motivation

Part of one's sotivation for such a drastic act as

treason or defection may not be wholly cooscious, and there

may be underljing causes which any source night not sent

or be able to adait even to hinself.

Thus, That lOSENKo

said about notivation need not be taken at face value, and

Ior this reason the whole question of his motivation must

remain a minor weight in the overall assessent of bona fides.

NOSENKO has tried to present a meaninglul expla-alloa

and

has changed or adjusted his story to this end.

initlally insisted

that he had no ideological motives but

simply vanted to "make a deal" in order to get out of

trouble; yet this claim is open to question:

The anoust of

operational money which NOSENKO needed to replace vas hardly

enuugh to have driven hia to treason, especially sisce

there were friends

in Genera like GUK and MISLOV uto might

have helped hin sake up his loss.

Furtherzore, only tre

days after ClA had rescued him with the funds. NOSENKO

the CIA noack in

snother drunken debauchery (with the

same companion) and came back needing more.

The discre-

pancy between the degree of the nerd and the seriousness of

of the act was so evident that the CIA case officer commented

to JOSENKO at the outset that there must be some deeper

explanation for his act. Thereupon YOSENKO added set

reasons:

His distaste

for certain aspects of the regise,

his resentment of KHRUSHCHEY, aad his liking for imericans.

By his defection in 1964 NOSENKO changed the course of

his life, although he had said in 1962, forcefully aad

unequivocally.

that he would never do so unless in acute

In 1964 he could give no conerent explanation for

the change of heart and in October 1966 he denied, for the

first time, that hehad said in 1462 that he would not de-

fect. His

only motivation was that, having risen to the

Level of Deputy Departent Chief, be would not get to travel

abroad any more.

(This contradicts NOSE'KO's 1962 state-

anticipating innirent prosotion to Deputy Department

Chief, he said that he would leave the USSR at least once

a year in the future.)

For no visible reason NOSESKO seems

to have abandoned a purportedly successful and promising

career, an undisturbed janily life and children of shom

lond, cast shane on his father's menory and his re-

maining relatives, and departed forever fron his ors country.

His own unease concerning his motivation evidently con-

tinued until, in 1965,

he wrote one cohesive explaiation.

No part of this statement was ever borne out by his conduct,

attitudes, remarks or reactions.

He appeared, wherever his

reactions

seemed spontaneous,

to dislike the United States,

to have no interest in it politically, culturally.

scenically, and to preserve a preference for the üSSR.

CIA graphologist commented on NOSENKO's "strong enotional

traditionel background," while a CIA psycholo-

gist reported:

he has not defected in spite

of his attempt to intellectually rationalize that he bas."

The psychologist also said that it is

"alnost impossible to

determine his true loyalties and true beliefs."

did so in Geneva, NOSENKO has given different ansters at

different trees.

Hig stories of sleply "dropping in and

hangirg arourd" for lack of anything better to do are

unacceprable in terus of know or likely Sovlet practice.

His explanation that it was due to ISYMBAL's auspices or

or Intervention vere contradicted by: First, his oft con-

fused eccounts of his relationship with ISYUBAL; and second,

his own statements at other tines that it yas GUK who ras

primarily responsible for NOSENtO's visits to the Residency.

NOSENKO had a full day free for meetings on l1 JuDe

1962, although thereafter he liaited meeting tines to shortei

and

shorter perlods until his departure.

This seemed

natural at the time since he dould presumably huve his own

responsibilities and would need to be seen by his Soviet

colleagues in his proper surroundings.

However, in 1964

he seeged not to tave any official respoasibilities or any

calls on his time:

He was willing to spend all his time in

seetings with CIA. Although this could be explained by the

fact that he plained to defect anyaay, it nevertheless would

have tavolved unnecessary risks to a geruine source about

to becone a defector.

Ho showed no concern at the time.

but later (1n 1966),

he said that he had been in fact afraid;

It was for this reason that he invented the Moscoo recall

telegran,

in order to hasten nis defection and put an end

to his fears of getting caught.

It is, of course, impossible

to nake conclusive judgments on Soviet practice, but one

would expect.

If NOSENKO were not engaged in security duties,

that he would be required to participate for cover reasons

in nore of the Soviet delegation's official activity.

He

said that any absence could be explained as "security duties,"

since everyone on the Soviet Delegation knew or suspected

that he was a KGB officer.

This unconcern for the suspicions

of otber Soviets conforms neither with observed Soviet

practice nor with reports fron other sources thet Soviet

intelligence and security officers under cover go to 50ue

pains to hide their true affiliation.

NOSENKO explained the contrast betreen his freedom

and availability

by the fact that in 1964 he had no personal friends iD

Geneva; in 1962 both GUK and KISLOV expected to see bia 1o

his free time. (This story does not explain tis ability in

1964 to get asay during conference working hours; seitker

GUK nor KISLOV affected this in 1962.)

was only tro weeks before his departure..

e. Willinaress to Meet CIA

Although in 1962 MOSENKO claimed that te wanted to

sell only two specific items for the noncy he had lost, and

cher. aisappear, there were indications from the outset

that

se expected and

planned to core back for further meetings

with CIA.

At this first meeting he called attention to

certain infornation in his possession about POPOV, hinting

that he would tell it later; even as he protested his unwilling-

ness

to continue meeting with cla,

he was giving ample

detaiis about himself which would inevitably have compro

mised him to CIA and forced his future collaboration.

Befora

he finally agreed to return for more incetings,

he said:

"Mayte I'll reet you again Monday' (tlio days after the firs:

neeting).

NOSESKO refused, despite

gation in 1966.

out by Special

Intellicerce.)

g. Remarks

The operational circumstances so far reviewed point

out the facts that:

- NOSENKO was inconsistent if not cortradictory in

stating his reasons for being in Geneva in 1962 and

1964;

- He had unusual access to the KGB Legal Residency

and an availabiliiy for meeting CIA that seemed to

impinge upon his security:

- He was willing to return to meetings with CIA al-

though having

at first said that there were but two

iters of information for sale:

- He was "in place" as a CIA source for the last

six of his 100 or so days in Geneva in 1962, thus

restricting the anount of time he could provide continu

ing reporting on the local legal Residency: and

- After 12 days in the same status in 1964.

forced the defection by the KGB recall telegram, which

appears to have been a fabrication.

Taken

together, these facts suggest the possibilities

that the KGB sent NOSENKO to Geneva on toth occasions for

the purpose of contacting CIA, that the KGB wanted the

opportunity to gauge ClA's reactions to the walk-in 1o 1962

and to the defection plans in 1904, and that the KGB guld d

NOSE.KO after contact was established in both years.

A further examination of the operational circunstances

1n

Geneva lends credence to these possibilitles.

During the

1962 meetings. NOSENKO would frequently. anster ClA questiong

"I will have to think about that tonight,

"I viil have some time tonight to jot down and prepare a

ne the tong

"or

good angver for you," or "I don't ant to give you an answer

to that right off--1 an afraid to mislead you."

He would

return to a later meeting with the inforuation, after having

visited the Legal Residency.

In 1964 there were other

exasples of what may have been backstage guidance by the

KGB:

-Ho called for an urgent special neeting to cor-

rect sunething he had said in an earlier deeting.

Initially NOSENKO had named ZUJU'S instead of KEYSERS

as the U.S. Embassy code clerk

whom he had personally

approached in 1961.

This seened remarkably urgent and

important to him at the time, and in retrospect this

case gains special importance:

It was the only time

he claimed to have had direct contact with a U.S.

Embassy staff employee

during his alleged tour in the

American Department in 1960-1961. If he could not

remember this one name, it might call his entire story

into question.

It is hard to find gnother explanation;

had he simply made a careless mistake, with his cus-

tomary indifference to names and dates. NOSENKO mould

be unlikely to mull over what he had said at the meeting

nor to bother about correcting a minor misstatement.

luch less would he feel compelled to call an energency

meeting to do so.

-He cane to meetings with "chance" itens picked

up at the Legal Residency, each of which would require

quick action and the commitment of assets on the part

of CIA in Geneva.

Also, NOSENKO originally said in

January 1964 that he wanted to defect right away, but

various steps taken or planned by his ClA handlers

kept him in place for a time.

Each step, however. was

quickly negated-usually at the dext meeting--by some

information NOSFNKO bad picked up by chance.

-He asked, out of context and without any explana-

tion, whether

GOLITSYN had told CIA that the President

of Finland was a Soviet agent, and laler could not

coherently explain

where be had heard this,

why he had

not told CIA about it in

1962, and why he had asked.

In addition, the Soviet reactions to the defection were

unprecedented and contrasted sharply with, for example, the

Soviets' avoidance of

publicity concerning GOLITSYS's defec-

t 100 in 1961.

The post-defection actions bj the Soviet

Government created publicity which had the superficial effact

of underlining NOSENKO's authenticity, establishing him as

• public figure, confirning that he had a fanily,

and veri-

Iying that his defection vas of alarming consequence.

H. Alternative Explanations

1. Introduction

• Parts VIII.B. through VIII.P. have discussed the

inaccuracies, self-admitted contradictions, inconsistencies,

and incompleteness

of NOSENKO's reporting about himself and

the KGB.

Coldectively,

these important flaws in the story

of and by NOSENKO make

it necessary to choose an explanation

for his actions and the nature of his information.

There

are three alternatives:

Pirst, NOSENKO was a KGB officer but (a) has

a faulty or

selective

mesory, has embellished or

boasted, or his reporting has been influenced by a

combination thereof; or (b) he is irsane.

Second, NOSENKO lied about himself in order to

save face.

Third, NOSELKO has misrepresented himself, either

on his own

of at the instigation. of the KGB.

Each of these mutually exclusive alternatives is discussed

below.

2. First Alternative

According to one postulate, NOSENKO was an officer in

the KGB but has

a faulty menory,

has a selective memory,

and/or has embellished or boasted:

a. Faulty Memory

NOSENKO himself has repeatedly appealed for understanding

that "different peple have different memories"

and that

his own is "funny," and

this is supported by his forgetful-

ness and errors concerning events he is known indesendently

to have lived through, such as

the BurGi and tell cases.

But it

cannot be said

that he is, In general.

"very bad with

names, ' because he nas almost total

recall of names and

positions of hundreds of iGB officers in the erican and

jourist Departments.

He has a good memory for teces and

rarely failed to recognize photograng of

people he claimed

to know.

He remembered consistently details about certain

operations (the compromise and investigation of PENKOVSKIY,

the surveillance of ABIDIAN to Pushkin Street, the JENNER:

case, the arrest of BARGHOORN, and the search for CHEREPANOV.

to cite a few examples).

NOSENKO was precisely accurate in

his recollection of most of his dealings with CIA personnel

from

June 1962 onward.

b. Selective Memory

Although having a selective nemory is probably true of

nearly everyone, a CIA psychologist has described NOSENKO as

a psychopath who would register each passing event only in

relation to its effect on himielt at that moment.

This

would inevitably make him indiffurent to the characteristics

of other people,

for example, and to the sequence in which

events transpired; the aspects important to him might rot

appear so to a nore objective observer.

such a person would

760.

suppress unpleasant menories and would have no real appro-

clation of or respoct for an

"objective truth."

Hig re-

porting, like his perception and his menory, might therefore

seen distorted.

He right recount events according to tig

mood of the moment.

Thus, fo example, 11 real attachronts

to family or friends is Irpossible for a psychopath, there

be an explanation as to why NOSENKO cannot easily remember

his childrens' birthdays, why in 1962 (or 1965) he appears

to have lied-or been indifferent to the truth--about hig

older daughter's schooling, and why be cannot recall when

he first married.

In theory this bypothesis can explain

any aberration, sinco 1t involves the unknowable.

In itg

most extreme form, by describing NOSENKO as one unable to

discriminate between fact and fancy, it would encompass and

explain away the facts that his story i8 obviously untrue

and contradictory in major ways; that his account of his

personal and professional life and his rendition of the.

Information he knows are so vague and unsubstantial; that

he cannot (and/or does not care to) remender or recount

how he did the things he did.

Most important,

it woula

dismiss any conciusions based on NOSENKO's testimony siace

nothing NOSENKO said

could be taken seriously.

This hypo-

thesis,

however, is unsupportable because of several

factors.

First, NOSENKO claims--and other sources confirn--that

he quickly rose to high supervisory responsibility in a

counterintelligence organization which is known to require

attention to detail.

He would have risen in the KGB while

overconing the black marks in his file:

scandal, indiscip-

line,

negative backgroud factors, and bad Party

record.

NOSENKO

admits that his performance was not good; he was

luattentive and inactive and almost none of his

operational

activity was carried

out unaccompanied.

That his rise re-

sulted fron his father's influence or GRIBANOV's is unten-

able, for his father died in 1956 and GRIBANOV's patronage

(itself open to the strongest doubt) would not and could not

be dispensed upon such a mental case.

Mental aberration to

the degree which would explain his poor performance under

CIA interrogation would necessarily have hindered his per-

formance of KGB duties, denied him special privileges,

and

and hence cost him the carcer which NOSENKO has claimed for

himself.

A second factor negating this hypothesis of a psycho-

pathic personality is that such a person could be induced

to recall certain details with the help of discussion,

questioning, and reminders, whereas NOSENKO's vague and hazy

reports seem to represent the absolute limits of his memory

or knowledge.

Years of questioning have not succeeded in

dredging up any ner details or incidents.

when reminded,

he could not recall, for example, one of KOSOLAPOV'S IDYS to

Helsinki, the details of the seizure of electronic equipment

fron the U.S. Army Attaches at Stalingrad, the correct date

of GOLITSYN's defection, or the presence

of KHRUSHCHEY in

Moscow at the time of the decision to arrest BARGHOORN.

Another factor is the impossibility of applying this

hypothesis to the totality. of NOSENKO's reporting.

hypothesis holds that some things are important to him and

are not,

and that he therefore rememhers the former

and forgets the latter, it 1s refuted by the inability to

find a catogory of information about himself which he con-

sistently remembered nor Ras that he consisiently forgot.

If what is important is his con direct experiences, fur

example, it is odd that he recalled the operations of otbers

better than his van; he renembered the danes of hundreds of

but could not recall names of his own agents

and people

invoived in his own carrer; he could recount

details of the PENNOVSKIY investigation, in which he did

not participate, but not of the discovery of American spies

among tourists,

such

aS MCGONAY, for which he ras responsible;

he reneubered details of the 1955 MALIA case in which he

did not meet the target personally but forgot details of the

1961 KEYSERS case in which he did. If it is the importance

to him of recruitment operations against U.S. Embussy en-

ployees which permitted hin to recall some details of the

STORSBERG and MULE opcrations, it is nut inportant enough

to help hin recall

some of the other details which were

equally pertinent to nim personally; and it is not selectivo

memory which made him forget alsost every

detail about CIA

personnel in Moscow and KGB action against them.

If it 1s

said that his parental family is importart to him & hence

his memory of his father's funeral and the names of his

uncles and aunts), it is odd that he cannot recall details

about his childhood. If drinking with important people 15

meaningful to him, it would explain why he rememberg one

GRIBANOV evening with

sharp ciarity, but it does not explain

why he cannot remember the other two times, not even in what

scagon of the year or in what restaurant they took place.

Finally, with reference to the "selective menory" hypo-

thesis, it is precisely in matters NOSENKO said he remembers

best and which he told cost confidently that the majority of.

Inexplicable contradictions arise.

from his claim to have been directly responsible for ABIDIAN

or on his story of the Pushkin Street dead drop, among

numerous examples.

c. Embellishment

The third possibility is that he has simply embellished

and boasted, while underlying his story is a core of truth

somewhere near

what he has reported.

NOSENKO has, after all,

admitted many "white lies" and boasts ("painting"

he called it). Also, in the interrogations there were

repeated signs that he was fabricating and improvising, often

in ways which led him into more contradictions and further

admissions of white lies.

Perhaps then, according to this

hypothesis, he simply invented,

on his

ons, various aspects

of his career.

Perhaps he dated his entry

earlier to make himself seen more experienced, and invented

his service in the American Department to make himself nore

interesting to American Intelligence. Perhaps he was only

a principal agent, not a staff officer, but learned enough

from his operations and fron his handlers to think be could

pose as one.

This hypothesis would certainly explala sany

of the dublous aspects:

the story of his career, his lack

of information on KGB staff procedures, his ignorance of

major KGB events and sources, the degree of his relationship

with GRIBANOV, etc.

This theory, however, founders on &

Nore

of the foregoing results in an truacation of trianity and

tere are countless other argunents which would irvalidate

3. Second ¿ltcrpative

It has also been postulated that NOSENtO li a psycho-

path,

By this line of reasoning, HOSENKO has

ahich shows his to ve a lieutenant colonel, and

764.

There remains the possibility that NOSENKO has misrep-

resented himself and is a witting part of a KGB operation.

Thig

hypothesis could accormodate the argument that the KGB would

not dispatch. a KGB staff officer as a double agert against a

hostile service because, whether of not the argurent is valid,

NOSENKO las indicated in Part VIII.D, above) has not proven his

claim to having

served as an officer of the KGB. If he has

been and is now

under iGB control, it would appear that he was

being built up for years to look like an officer and was showr

to lesterners in certain recruitment oferations.*

This could

explain NOSENKO's revelations to FRIpPEL and others about his

family and background; the otherwise pointless W.E. JOHNSON

case, and NOSE!KO's aypearance in the BARGHOORN interrogation.

It could explain NOStliko's uneven memory and performance under

detailed questionir.g: Much of what he should have known by

personal experience could have been mercly memorized as part

of his KGB briefing.

Nothing in liOSEN"O's procuction (see

Part ViIl.B. above)

would preclude his being a KGS-dispatched

agent.

That he was a KGB-dispatched agent was the conclusion

independently arrived

at by the cla speciaiist who administered

Indicated the nature of his responsibilitles in esther of these

Department of the Internal Counterintelligence Uirectorate, although

certain activitles of cormon interest with the latter would appear

logical. RUSETO's description of his alleged dutles with corres-

then, an encounter between JULITSYN and rinself could not have

been in the course of interdepartmental liaison between their

respective units, nor could it have occurred in MOSaiKO's office.

have led GULITSYN to make the unfounded assumption that NOSENKO

was a member of the staff within the auerican Departrent.
