as scon as Source was taken to the DGI Headquarters, Source was
told to choose a pseudonym, After Source chose the pseudonym
“¥ictor FERNANDEZ", Norberto HERNANDEZ Curbelo, who was then in
charge of the Departamento de Liberacion Nacional (National
Liberation Department - LN) operations for Central America under
the MS Sectidn, sent a memorandum to the DGI Personne] Depart-
ment giving the pseudonym as belonging to Source. The actual
forwarding memorandum was sent by the Secret Office. This was an
essential step because payrolls were always made out in pseudonyn.
The normal pseudonym consists of a given namc and a surname, and
can be used by the given name, surname, or both together. Since
each officer chooses his on pseudotym, thore is sometimes dupli-
cation, with two persons choosing the same name, When this
happens nothing is done if the two persons are working in different
departments of the DGI. If. for any reason there is @ shift in
Personne] which brings the two persons with the same pseudonyms,
first or last names, into the same department, one or the other
wall havo to change his pseudonym in order to avoid confusion.

Innediately upon joining the DGI, Source was assigned to the
Salvador Desk in the Seccion Central (Central American Section)
of the LN Department, where he continued to work. He was started
at once on reading the desk operational files and very soon was
given operational files from other desks to-also read, He re-
ceived only minimal security briefings and was told to invent for
hinself some sort of reasonable cover job. Source kept his old
Ministry of Internal Trade identification card to use as cover.
As soon as employment was mentioned to him he was told that he
was being recruited by ™ and that it was for espionage.
