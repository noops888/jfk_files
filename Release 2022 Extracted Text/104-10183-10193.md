After being told that it was probably unwise from a secur-

its point of view for KUBARK to attempt to get AMLASH/1 an in-

vitation to the 16th National Assembly of Surgeons in Vexico

City in November, and after clearing the action with the under-

signed, ANWHIP/l called Manual RODRIGUEZ in Mexico at his last

knoxn address (his father's); AJWHIP/1 reached RODRIGUEZ in

Cuernavaca (phone 22317), Mexico. He learned that RODRIGUEZ

is now married, has two children, and is director of the govt

hospital in Cuernavaca. AWHIP explained the situation, giving

as his reason for wanting to see AMLiSH/l the fact that he had

some family business he wished to discuss with the former, and

asked RODRIGUEZ'S help in getting an invitation to the above

Assembly.

RODRIGUEZ said that he was going to Mexico City on

Nonday and would see what he could do on Monday,

31 August.

He will call AWHIP/l in New York either Monday

or Tuesday.

AWWHIP/I will put off his European trip until he hears from

RODRIGUEZ.
