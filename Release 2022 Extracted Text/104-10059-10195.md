on 12 March 1964 who would have known if Oswald had been a

CIA informant?

Answer: : :

1964 meeting was Mr. David E. Murphy, then Chief of the Soviet
Russia Division, DDP. See paragraph 6 of the Tab 9 memorandum

_he- and Mr. Murphy were the two Clandestine Services officers

agent for CIA in the Soviet Union.

Mexico Station Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Embassies (1963)

1. “Unilateral Coverage:
Esse seeeieep este From the time the Mexico Station was opened in [April 1947 until’
the arrival of Mr. Win Scott as Chief of Station in 1955, the Station had. *

- developed a support apparatus to exploit leads from the Soviet Embassy in!

Mexico City. This umbrella type project (LIPSTICK) consisted of multiline
phone taps, three photographic sites, ‘a mobile surveillance team and.a_
mail intercept operation. ~ a ane

Telephone taps (LIFEAT) were placed by fan employee of the Tocal
telephone company who was handled by a Station case officer. The number
ae . of lines tapped was limited only by the availability of a listening post .
nearby and the availability of langauge (English, Spanish, Soviet, Polish,
Czech, etc.) transcribers. Generally, these were Mexican or Mexican-
American recruited agents. :

Three photographic sites were handled by a Station case officer z

assisted by technicians on TDY from Headquarters who advised the Station

eaten at

on the best types of cameras, films, and concealment devices. These
operations had sub-crypts under project LIPSTICK (namely: LIMITED, LILYRIC .
and LICALLA). LIMITED was a fixed site directly opposite the Soviet Em-
bassy (across the street) which had both a vehicle and a pedestrian en-

trance. The gate to the Soviet Embassy was on the northwest corner of the

“ Soviet compound and the LIMITED site was diagonally across a double laned

street on the southeast corner of that block. (See attached diagram).
LIMITED was the first photo base and operated strictly on an experimental
basis. in the early stages. This base, however, was closed when the Sta-

tion received word that the photograph of the “unidentified man" was

» being released by the Warren Commission. |. LILYRIC was an alternate Photo~ :

graphic base. It was located in an upper story of an apartment building
on the same side of the street as the LIMITED site but in the middle of
the block south. It had a planted view of the front gate of the Soviet
Embassy. LICALLA, the third photographic site, was located in one of a

row of four houses on the south side of the Soviet Embassy compound.

This site overlooked the back garden of the Soviet Embassy compound. The ;

purpose of this operation was to get good identification photographs of
Soviet personnel. The three photographic sites were managed by a re-
cruited agent who was a Mexican citizen, the son of an American mother
and Mexican father (deceased). This agent collected the film. from the .
LIMITED and LILYRIC sites three times a week. The film was then de-
veloped and printed into 8 x 10 contact print strips. -LICALLA film was
originally processed in the Station but in early rect due to the resig-
nation of a technician, this film like that of LIMITED and LILYRIC was =

processed on the outside by a recruited agent.

Mobile surveillance was conducted by two American staff officers.
These two officers organized a surveillance team of six recruited agents
which used late model cars and a panel truck for surveillance. The ‘team
could be activated by radio from the LIMITED site whenever someone of
interest left the gate of the Soviet Embassy. These agents were aware of
the LIMITED site since they had been issued LIMITED photographs for
identification purposes. el : , i

The Station also conducted a [unilateral] mail intercept operation,
LIBIGHT, which was handled by an American case officer. fA recruited
Mexican agent, who had a semiofficial status| obtained selected letters
from a subagent Employed by the Mexican Agee system]

{Liaison a unreliable and insecure as characterized by

of Federal Security (DFS), Pith which we eaitucted Maison}, was a hip-
pocket group run out of the Mexican Ministry of Government. This Ministry
was principally occupied with political investigations and control of
foreigners. Their agents were sees Tl and corrupt. fa Station
officer trained a number of them in name ‘tracing and travel contyol. . In

1958, at the instigation of a Mexican official, a joint telephone tap -

operation came into existence. The operation, which became known as

cipals,\ the Station chief, himself, became the project case officer.’ A

‘bassies in {anticipation of possible coverage.| The Station immediately

disconnected all of the unilateral Fstephone taps on these Embassies sol
that they would not be discovered when the Mexicans hooked up their

taps. The Mexicans |\soon thereafter connected five Cuban lines, five

_ Soviet lines, three Czech lines, two Polish lines, and one Yugoslav

line. At the listening post, a live monitor made short summaries of

conversations of interest. which were then included ina daily resume

for the Chief of Station. Later, when a reel was completely recorded,

full transcripts were typed and passed to the Station; however, there

ey a Tanguage other than spanish or’ English were taken to another location i
for translation and typing. Mr. Boris Tarasoff did the Russian transla-
‘tions but because of the volume of Russian conversations, the. translations
usually ran about a week behind ‘the date of _ conversation.

As soon as the Station ‘learned that an American identifying hin 7

self as Lee Oswald _Phoned the Soviet Embassy, Miss Ann Goodpasture of _

" Station started screening all photographs. However, here again, there

was a backlog because the photographs were picked up three times a week =
but those picked up were usually for dates a few days before since the -
technician who was processing the film, did so on a night-time basis.
Further, photographs were not made initially until a complete roll OF
film was used. Later this was changed and the operator cleared the camera ~
at the end of each day regardless of amount of unused film remaining.
The instructions were to cover the entire work day (office hours) and to
photograph all. Soviets, their families, all foreigners, and cars with
foreign license plates. Human error did occur but generally the agents
were conscientious. The Cuban Embassy coverage ‘had more sophisticated :
equipment using a pulse camera which frequently developed mechanical dif-
ficulties. ; :

Oswald came to the attention of the listening post: operators: .

from a tap of the Soviet line. It was picked up and taken to Mr. Boris



Tarasoff for translation because the caller was trying to speak in Russian. :

There was some delay because Station personnel waited to compare the
photographs with the typed transcript. All transcripts were made in

either Spanish or English since the Chief of Station could read only

these two languages and because he personally screened the transcripts

for operational leads.
