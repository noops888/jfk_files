"A suit for $150,000 damages was filed against
East Bay authorities today by Robert Scheer, editor
and writer for Ramparts Magazine.

“The action in federal court named Sheriff Frank
Madigan, the County of Alameda, and the City of
Berkeley as defendants.

"It grew out of Scheer's arrest--among 391
others--during the People's Park demonstrations in
Berkeley last May 22, an arrest which he claimed
violated his ‘rights under the lst, 4th, 5th, 6th,
8th, and 14th Amendments.

"Scheer, saying he was present as a member
of the working press, charged that he was held at
the Santa Rita prison farm, denied the right to
counsel or access to bail, and physically and
mentally harassed, assaulted and punished.

“Subsequently, all the charges on which he
was arrested were dismissed by the Berkeley-Albany
municipal court, he added."

"At the unauthorized appearance of the mime

troupe in the College of Law Great Hall, where

audible references to sexual organs were made by
the troupe. In addition, one of the male mime
troupe members, in enacting a protest against
ecological pollution, fondled the breast of a

further describes itself as the "Black Community: News Service,"
states that the BPP advocates the use of guns and guerrilla
tactics in its revolutionary program to end oppression. of. the
black people. Residents of the black community are urged to
arm themselves against the police who are consistently referred
to in the publication as "pigs" who should be killed.

"The Black Panther" issue,of September 7, 1968, contains
an editorial by BPP Minister of Education, George Mason Murray,
which ends with the following:

"Black men. Black people, colored persons of. America,
revolt everywhere! Arm yourselves. The only culture worth
keeping is a revolutionary culture. Change. Freedom everywhere.
Dynamite! Black Power. Use the gun. Kill the pigs everywhere."

Included in the introduction to an article appearing
in the October 5, 1968, edition of "The Black Panther" is the
statement, "ewe will not dissent from American po vernnente
We will’ overthrow it."

Issues of "The Black Panther" regularly contain quotations
from the writings of Chairman MAO Tse-tung of the People's
Republic of China and feature MAO's statement that "political
power grows out of the barrel of a gun."
