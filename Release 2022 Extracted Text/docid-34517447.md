"Pamparts" in a letter to subscribers dated

May 1, 1968, announced that beginning June 1,

yearly subscription price of $15.

In this

...the first national publication to consis-

tently reveal the ribbon of lies supporting

America's involvement in Vietnam; we stripped

the curtain from America's

'invisible government'

by exposing CIA's unlicensed intrusion into our

domestic lives; we dared to write about the

applications of the Catholic Church's political

power; we warned, vears before the Kerner

report, that white racism was the base of

America's racial problems;we blasted away at

the corroded institutions

of Cold War liberalism.

" 'Ramparts' is now the largest left-of-center

commercial magazine in the history of the United

which ends with the following:

"Black men. Black people, colored persons of America,

power grows out of the barrel of a

gun."
