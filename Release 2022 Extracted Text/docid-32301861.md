On 1/31/62, PCI WALLACE O'REILLY advised that
the Alcohol Beverage Control (ABC), Department of the State
of New Jersey, is insisting that all members of the teamsters
unions complete a questionnaire which in part pertains to
their criminal background if any. In cases where a teamster
member has been arrested, he is required to set forth on
this questionnaire the date of his arrest, the charge,
and the disposition, plus a photograph for the files of the
ABC. As a result of the *s insistence that this
questionnaire be complet in its entirety, ANTHONY
PROVENZANO ordered JAI FRIEDLAND, attorney for Teamsters
Joint Council 73, to fight this issue in the courts if
nécessary in order. to prevent the disclosure of any teamster's
background.

O'REILLY related that as a result of this request
by ABC, PROVENZANO had a wemo prepared and distributed
to all teamsters within the State of New Jersey, which
informed the membership that this order by the ABC was
illegal and that the membership was not required to complete
the portion of the questionnaire which pertained to the
criminal background. PCI O'REILLY advised further that
this memo instructed the membership to immediately report
any situation where the management of a particular firm
insisted that this be completed... This was to have
been immediately reported to PROVENZANO’s office but
under no circumstances were the members to complete it
if they did not desire to.

PCI stated that JACOB fatEDLAND's son, DAVID,
@ young attorney, who recently joined his father's
. practice, was understood to have been responsible for the
research into the legal precedence on this matter.

On 3/28/62, PCI FINKLE was recontacted, at which
time he advised that approximately one month ago he attended
a Local 560 Board of Trustees’ meeting in the offices of
the local’s attorney, Mr. JACOB FRIEDLAND, He stated that
during the course of this meeting, FRIEDLAND announced
that the loan of $275,000 of Welfare Fund money, which was
to have been made available to the owners of the Pine Brook
Auction, Route 46, Pine Brook, New Jersey, had fallen
through in that it had been determined by FRIEDLAND that
the owner of this establishment had committed suicide.

FINELE stated that although he has been unable
to determine the identities of the individuals who are
to receive a $200,000.00 loan for the renovation of their
bowling alley located in the vicinity of New Brunswick,
New Jersey, he has received information indicating that
this business firm is owned by two brothers of Italian
extraction who reside in the North Hudson County area.
FINKLE advised that PROVENZANO has apparently issued
orders to bis business agents and organizors to be more
discreet in their dealings with employers as conversation
in the trucking industry indicates that very few employers
are at this time having difficulty with the enforcement
of the area wide contract. FINELE stated that this is a
result of the adverse publicity which PROVENZANO has re=
ceived in local newspapers of late and believes this
period of relative peace will continue at least through
the period in which his ow litigation is pending.

®INKLE stated that inquiries by the FBI at
trucking terminals through the metropolitan Newark
area have also alerted the business agents, stewards,
and organizors; and, therefore, they are being very
circumspect in their dealings with the employers and
teamster members.

FINKLE stated that he will attempt to dis-
creetly obtain the identities of the owners of the
bowling alley establishment to whom PROWENZANO is making
available $200,000 of Local 560 Welfare Fund money.

ADMINISTRATIVE

On 2/8/62, PCI CLIFFORD FINKLE, SR. was contacted,
at which time he advised that several matters had been
brought to his attention concerning the activities of
Local 560 which he thought worthy of mention, He explained
that since the inception of 560°s Welfare and Pension
Programs, the Passaic-Bergen Counties Fund has operated at
a profit, whereas the Hudson County Fund has had deficits
periodically. PCI explained that even though this fact
is easily proven by the annual audits, Local 560's attorney,
JACOB FRIEDLAND, attended the last Board of Trustees
mesting which was held just prior to Christmas (1961) and
demanded that the Passaic-Bergen Board of Trustees (FINKLE.
is a Boadd member) raise the employer contribution rate
from $.31 per hour to the Hudson County rate of $.33 per
hour.

FINKLE stated that he was vacationing in Florida
at the time of this meeting, however, learmed on return
that the other two employer trustees, ALBERT SCALETTI and
ALBERT MARCHINI, voted against the proposal of FRIEDLAND.
FINKLE learned that FRIEDLAND explained to the Board that’
the $.02 differential between the Hudson and the Passaic-
Bergen Fund had created suspicion among the Hudson County
Terminal owners and investigative agencies and felt that
both funds should therefore immediately establish the same
identical contributory rates.

FINELE stated that the second problem brought
before the Trustees has been FRIEDLAND’s insistance that
the employers of all 560 members contribute the $.33 per
hour Welfare and Pension rate for all casual help regard=
less of whether the individuals are members of 560, The
PCE explained that in the majority of cases where a
terminal requires additional man power, generally in
Passaic and Bergen Counties, the union is unable to supply
the men needed. When this occurs, he and other terminal
operators have an available supply of labor which will
work their regular employment and thereafter join the
night or early morning shifts at the particular terminal
in need of man power. He related that in almost all cases .
when this type of labor is hired, the men are members of unions
other than 560. FRIEDLAND’s insistance that the trucking

operators contribute $.33 an hour for non-Teamster help
which is hired, is not only suspicious but unjustified.

He stated that when the employer members of the

Board of Trustees refused to vote in favor of these two
proposals by FRIEDLAND, FRIEDLAND demanded that they bring
the matters before the New Jersey State Board of Mediation,
1100 Raymond Boulevard, Newark, New Jersey. FINKLE
thereafter produced a copy of State Mediator’s THOMAS A.
KNOWLTON'’s decision and award in both of the above proposals.
Both questions, namely, increasing the Passaic-Bergen
truckers contribution to $.33 per hour and the contribution
of $.33 to 560°s Welfare and Pension Fund for non-union

- men, was adjudicated in favor of the union, both effective
as of 2/1/62, .

FINELE stated that he and all other trucking .
employers with whom he has been in contact since this
decision was reached by KNOWLTON, are outraged for several
reasons: first, why should the Pagsaic-Bergen operators
be forced to increase their rates from $,.31 to $.33
per hour when their fund issolvent and Hudson County's
Fund which receives $.33 per hour is running into deficit;
second, why should the employers in Passaic and Bergen
Counties contribute Welfare and Pension monies to 560
for men who are not members of that union, particularly,
when these men will not be entitled to insurance, medical
treatment and pension rights under 560°s contract.

/ iy

Bes

PCI stated that he is of the opinion that State
Mediator THOMAS AS KNOWLTON has been “bought” by PROVENZANO

in order to have rehdered a decision im the union's favor.

FINELE related that the next matter brought to
his attention involves the loans of $200,000.00 and
$275,000.00 by Local 560°s Welfare Fund to two separate
business firms within the past three mnths.

PCI explained that one SEYMOUR)|PASKOW, a Newark /:-
realtor, approached the Passaic-Bergen dounty Board of
Txtistees and informed them that he had ‘learned that Local 560
was making available funds ‘for mortgages.  PASKOW stated
that he then had two clients in need ofworking capital and
thereafter presented to the Board a picture of his clients’
net worth, including bills, rent, and potential.

FINKLE stated that on the approval of the trustees
of the Passaic and Bergen Counties Fund and PROVENZANO,
PASKOW was furnished checks in the amount of $200,000.00 and
$275,000 500.

FINELE related that the loan of $200,000 at 6 per
cent interest for an unrecalled number of years went. to two
_ brothers, the names of whom he, could not recall who own a
bowling alley located in New Brunswick, New.Jersey. This
loan was ostensibly. for improvements of their alleys.

The sum of $275,000 at 6 per cent for fifteen years
was furnished the owners of the Pine Brook Auction, Route 46,
Pine Brook, New Jersey, FINKLE stated that: this group
placed their building and 12 acres of land up.as collateral
for this loan.

PCI: advised that he possesses no derogatory
information concerning PASKOW .of the firmS he represented
_ in these negotiations; however, he thought this information.
worthy of mention, FINKLE did state, however, that a —
possibility exists that PROVENZANO and others in the
Teamsters Union who would finally authorize these leans
could be receiving a percentage of the mortgage. money
for having placed their stamp of. approval on these matters.
It should be noted that in the other case where the PCI
made available ‘information concerning a $400,000 loan’ by
560 to the United States Glass and Chemical Company of
Pittsburgh and New. York, an investigation revealed that
this firm was,at the time of the loan, under investigation
by the Securities. Exchange Commission. It was determined
that this firm had changed its name to United States
Diversified Industries asa result of this pending
investigation.

At the eonelusion of the contact with PINKLE,
he made available the following documents, which were
photostated and returned:
