ADHINISTRATIVE

On 1/31/62, PCI WALLACE O'REILLY advised that

the Alcohol Beverage Control (ABC), Department of the State

of New Jersey, is insisting that all members of the teamsters

unions complete a questionnaire which in part pertains to

In cases where a teamster

member has been arrested, he is required to set forth on

this questionnaire the date of his arrest, the charge,

and the disposition, plus a photograph for the files

of the

ABC. As a result of the ABC's insistence that this

questionnaire be completed in its entirety, ANTHONY

PROVENZANO ordered JACOB FRIEDLAND, attorney for Teansters

Joint Council 73, to fight this issue in the courts 1f

necessary in order. to prevent the disclosure of any teamster's

background.

O'REILLY related that as a result of this request.

DY AbC, PROVENGANO had a memO prepared and distributed

to all

teansters within the state of New Jersey, which

informed the membership that this order by the ABC was

illegal and that the membership was not required to complete

the portion of the questionnaire which pertained to the

criminal background. PCI O'REILLY advised further that

this memo instructed the membership to immediately report

any situation where the management of a particular firm

Insisted that this be completed.. This was to have

been imnediately reported to PROVENZANO's office but

under no circumstances were the members to complete it

if they did not desire to.

ius stated that JACOB FRIEDLAND's son, davId,

* young attorney, who recently joined his father's

practice, was understood to have been responsible for the

research

into the legal precedence on this matter.

O'REILLY stated that the recent arrest of

SALVATORE, BRIGUGLIO, NUNZIO PROVENZANO, and EUSTICE ROPER

by the New York City Police Department has not been dig.

cussed by any of the officials of Local 560 to date.:

PcI stated that the fact that they have not discussed

this matter indicates that the lesser known figure of

these three; namely, ROBER, will in all probability

be ordered to aumit the extortion and thereby exonerate

PROVENZANO's brother, NUNZIO, and BRIGUGLIO.

At that point, O'REILLY made available a 29-

page pamphlet entitled,.

"Your Pension Program, Pension

On 3/28/62, PCI FINKLE was recontacted, at which

time he advised that

approximately one month ago

he attended

& Local 560 Board of Trustees' meeting in the offices of

the local's attorney, Nt. JACOB FRIEDLAND, He stated that

during the course of this meeting, FRIEDLAND announced

that the loan of $275,000 of Welfare Fund woney, which was

to have been made available to the owners of the Pine Brook

Auction, Route 46, Pine Brook, New Jersey, had fallen

through in that it had been determined by FRIEDLAND that

the owner of this establishment had committed suicide.

PINKLE stated that although he has been unable

to determine the identities of the individuals who are

to receive a $200, 000.00 loan for the renovation of their

this business firm is owned by two brothers of Italian

extraction who reside in the North Hudson County area.

FINKLE advised that PROVENZANO has apparentLy issued

of the area wide contract.

FINKLE stated that this 1s a

result of the adverse publicity which PROVENZANO has rec

ceived in local newspapers of late and believes this

period of relative peace will continue at least through

the period in which his ow litigation 1s pending.

TINKLE stated that inquiries by the FBI at

trucking terminals through the netropolitan Newark

ares have also alerted the business agents, stewards,

and organitors; and, therefore, they are being very

circuspect in their dealings with the employers and

teamster members.

FInKIt stated that he will attempt to dis

creetly obtain the identities of the owners of the

bowling alley establishment to whom PROVENZANO is making

available $200, 000 of Local 560 Welfare Fund money.

ADMINISTRATIVE

On 2/8/62, PCI CLIFFORD FINKLE, SR. was contacted,

at which time he advised that several matters had been

brought to his attention concerning the setivities of

Local 560 which he thought worthy of mention. He explained

that since the inception of 560°s Welfare and Pension

Prograns, the Passaid-Bergen Counties Fund has operated at

a profit,

whereas the Hudson County Fund has had deficits

periodically. PCI explained that even though this fact

is easily proven by the annual audits, Local 560's attorney,

JACOB FRIEDLAND, attended the last Board of Trustees

meeting which was held just prior to Christmas (1961)

and

demanded that the Passaid-Bergen Board of Trustees (FINALE

is & Bosad member) raise the employer contribution rate

from $.31 per hour to the Hudson County rate of $.33 per

hour.

FINKLE stated that he was vacationing in Florida

at the time of this weeting, however, learned on return

that the other two employer

trustees, ALBERT SCALETTI and

ALBERT MARCHINI, voted against the proposal of FRIEDLaNd.

FINKLE learned that FRIEDLAND explained to the Board that'

the $.02 differential between the Hudson and the Passaic.

Bergen Fund had created suspicion among the Hudson County

Terminal owners and investigative agencies and felt that

both funds should therefore immediately establish the same

Identical contributory rates.

FINE stated that the second problem brought

before the Trustees has been FRIEDLAND's insistance that

the employers of all 560 members contribute the $ 33 per

hour Welfare and Pension rate for all casual help regard.

dess of mether the sad in ane member o se

The

Pe explained that lu the majority of cases where a

terminal requires additional

was power, generally in

Passaic and Bergen Counties, the union is unable to supply

the men needed. When this occurs, he and other terminal

operators have an available supply of labor which will

work their regular employment and thereafter join the

night or early morning shifts at the particular terminad

in need of man power.

He related that is almost all cases

when this type of labor is

hired, the men are members of unions

other than 560.

FRIEDLAND's insistance that the trucking

only suspicious but unjustified.

He stated that when the employer members of the

Board of Trustees refused to vote in favor of these two

proposals by FRIEDLAND, FRIEDLAND demanded that they bring

the matters before the

New Jersey State Board of Mediation,

1100 Raymond Boulevard, Newark, New Jersey.

FINKLE

thereafter produced a copy of State Mediator's THOMAS A.

KNONLTON's decision and award in both of the above proposals.

Both questions, namely, Increasing the Passaid-Bergen

truckers contribution to $ 33 per hour and the contribution

of $.33 to 560's Helfare and Pension Fund for non-union

men, was adjudicated in lavor of the union, both effective

as of 2/1/62.

FInKLE stated that he and ald other trucking:

decision was reached by KNOILTON, are outraged for several

pCI stated that he is of the opinion that State

Mediator THOMAS A. KNOWLION has been "bought" by PROVENZANO

in order

• to have rendered a decision in the union's favor.

FINKLE related that the next matter brought to

his attention involves the loans of $200,000.00 and

$275,000.00 by Local 560°g Welfare Fund to two separate

PCI explained that one SEYMOUR PASROW, & Newark!

of the Passace and Bergen counties fund and pRovenzard,

PASKOW was furnished checks in the amount of $200,000.00

and

placed their building and 12 acres of land up as collateral

for this loan.

PCI advised that he possesses no derogatory

information concerning PASKOW of the firus he represented

in these negotiations; however,. he. thought this information

worthy of mention.

FINKLE did state, however,

that a

possibility exists that PROVENZANO and others in the

Teamsters Union who would finally authorize

these loans

could be receiving a percentage of the mortgage. money

It should be noted that in the other case where the PCI

made available information concerning & $400, 000 loan by

560 to the United States Glass and Chemicad Company of

Pittsburg, and New for, an investigation revealed that
