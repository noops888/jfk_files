SUBJECT: Activities of Dale SMITH

1. Attached is a newspaper interview with American
Black Power advocate Dale SMITH, which was published in |
Sdndags Aktuelt, 7 July i968, and which gives a fair des]
Gription oY SYYFH's views as they have been expressed on
other occasions.

2. SMITH mentions a television program waich had been
filmed but not shown by Danish TV. The program was, in fact,
shown on the week the interview appeared; the title was “The
Negro in Denmark” and a group of five American Negroes had a
fine time sitting around a table in a dark, smoke-filied set
meant te appear as a cafe, damning white America , capitalism,
Russian communism, and - most emphatically ~ Denmark, 211
with a fine disdain for iegie or sequence of though:.
