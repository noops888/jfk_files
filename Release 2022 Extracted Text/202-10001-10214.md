* Items marked by asterisk were approved by Special Group (Augmented}, 5 March 1962.

CONSIDERATIONS

There is a risk that this action will disclose this U.S.
intelligence activity within Cuba. Selected personnel
are being intensively trained. This first team has 2
agents. An area in which resistance has been reported
has been selected. Agent operations must stay alive,
taake useful contacts, and report securely to CIA.
Physical risk to personnel is substantial, due to lack
of intelligence. First reports from first team are
expected by the end of March, while reports from the
second and third teams, dispatched in March, are ex-
pected to start in April.

Many of the agents infiltrated into Cuba will be trained
for paramilitary skills as well as intelligence collection,
with the thought that they will be in place inside Cuba

and ready to act whenever paramilitary operations are
decided upon. However, CIA has noted that, once the
agents are inside Cuba, they cannot be controlled
effectively from outside Cuba, although every effort j
will be made to attempt such control, i

PURPOSE
/
To collect intelligence, /

To ready agent operations.

To exploit the intelligence possi-
bilities of former residents of
Cuba (including U.S. citizens) now
in the United States.

To collect intelligence in a Latin
atmosphere, at different levels thar.
now seem possible in the continental
U.S., to spot additional intelligence
assets and to provide security
against Communist agent operations.

Items marked by asterisk were approved by Special Group (Augmented),

CONSIDERATIONS

Possible future use in communications and support.

Effectiveness and numbers are dependent upon purpose
of recruitment, nature of training, and policy decisions
controlling these factors. If the recruitment and train-
ing are for resistance activities, the task of recruit~
ment and training will be much less difficult than if
they are limited te intelligence~-collection purposes
only.

There are "colonies" in Washington, D,C., and other
U.S. cities which are "little Cubas." Family, Church,
and business interests provoke unusual personal ties
inside Cuba for some of these residents; a real potential
exists for collection of intelligence not otherwise avail-
able. (FBI support and coordination is basic in this
effort. }

Number of agente in each team and selection of areas
will be determined by developments of the previous
actions and by conditions.

Numbers, areas, and supplies are completely dependent
upon conditions at the time, and upon policy approval of
methods to be used (that is, if air delivery can be used,
or if this activity must depend upon maritime delivery).
