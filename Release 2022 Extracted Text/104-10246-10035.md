Operational Activities:

This Project continued

as before

for the major portion of this period with KDAFGHAN providing photo

coverage for eight hours per day,

This later proved unuseable as sunlight playing on the mirror oft

the lens was plainly visible from the target area in the afternoons

The Agent returned to the use of his old equipment. It being the

current Case Officer's practice to hold nearly all

meetings with

this Agent in the Case Officer's auto about once every two weeks we

decided to terminate the KDAFGHAN safehouse as unnecessary. :

O4KDAFGHAN-1

was notified of this in early June and nearly collapsed.

The safehouse had been his refuge from the: OP and his mother, a

02(KDAFGHAN-2. We intended to put him on vacation when it was decided

(References B and C) to terminate him and his Project. C The last

portion of this period was then spent in closing down the operation,

removing equipment from the OP, restoring the OP to itsjoriginal

condition and then assisting the Agents in their preparations for

resettling to Madrid.

All of this was finally accomplished by

31 July and the Agents were formally terminated on 1 August...cors

period.

Security: There were no security incidents during this

3. Agent Personnel: The termination of these two Agents

came as a severe shock to both; they were not prepared for it.

They have adapted fairly well and now are looking forward to

their new life in Spain. They intend to depart Mexico for Madrid

on l September.

Production: Production for this period was normal until

20 June when it ceased permanently.

5.

Administrative/Finance:

There was a large amount

administrative detail involving Headquarters

and the Madr 1d) 75-2

Station in the resettlement of these two Agents.

This has been

discussed in separate cable traffic.

Costs exceeded the programmed

amount because of the large severance pay paid both

agents who

over ten years service each.02(KDAFGHAN-1 was paid U.S. $8,170.00

and KDAFGHAN-2 was paid U.S. $2, 228.48.

Plans: We have no plans to replace KDAFGHAN with another

strictly photo-surveillance project.

The production does not

justify the cost.

However, we do have plans to obtain a multi-

purpose basehouse in the

area that can serve as a site for taking

when necessary, serve as a LP for future audio operations

against AMFINK, and

as a base from which to dispatch a future

surveillance team.

The PBRUMEN section has already started the

search for agent

assets who,

in turn, can look for an appropriate

The acquisition of the latter will be the most difficult as

rental property is at a premium in the AMFINK area.

Headquarters

will be kept informed of our progress.
