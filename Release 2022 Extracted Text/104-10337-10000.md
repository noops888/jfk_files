ARRB Proposals to Expedite Review of Assassination Records

I. Re-location of Sequestered Collection to ARRB site will
allow ARRB staff on-site access to identify relevant/key
files and documents, and review Agency designated non-
related material.

Comment :

It is not feasible to transfer the entire collection
and continue CIA's review. Parts of the collection can be
transferred on temporary basis without impeding HRG's review
provided security and DO concerns are satisfied.

Security Requiremen’ ue.
1) Agency Controlled Secure Area -- construction cost/who
pays? [ARRB should pick up this cost.]

2) Document Access Control:
a) During work-day -- detailed CIA reviewers or
designated ARRB staffer?
b) after hours -- CIA guard or existing guard force?

DO Concerns:

Provided security requirements are met, DO has no
objections to portions of the JFK sequestered collection
being temporarily housed at ARRB site as needed for review.
(Note: Fred W. is checking with DO security re requirements
for storing records off-site.]

HRG Requirements:

1) Office/ workspace for HRG project officer and two or
three reviewers.

[Depending on security requirements, 2 HRG reviewers could
either be assigned to ARRB on a regular basis or report
there as needed -- project officer will be visiting ARRB
site on regular basis.]

2) Secure phone and FAX (STU IIIs) is a necessity; video
Conference capability would enhance communications.

3) Computer support -- PC/Word Processing is a necessity;
direct link to HRG index would enhance capability to handle
ARRB Staff questions and expedite review.

4) Priority Courier Service from IP at ARRB


13-00000

II. Expedite the review of the Sequestered Collection by
focusing on most relevant files/documents and not sending
duplicates to the Board for action.

Comment :

HRG has already implemented a review focusing on
documents that have not been acted on by the Board;
duplicates are flagged and will be prepared for NARA later.

"Due to the duplicate search, the amount of time for an HRG

reviewer to review a box has increased, but the number of
documents per box for action has decreased.

A targeted /subject approach (identify and review most
relevant material first) will be difficult to implement
given current state of HRG index.

Additional review and computer support will be need to
meet the Board's request.

Requirements:
1) Increase HRG re-review team to 4 or 5 reviewers.

2) Begin separate review of HSCA material including
documents held by the ARRB -- 2 reviewers.

[Note: HSCA material is a high priority of the Board;
however, since most HSCA documents are releasable in full,
the review generate few documents for Board action.]

3) Enhancements to the HRG index/data base will be required
to facilitate searching and identifying duplicates (work
already under way) .

4) Communications and computer support -- same as Request I

III.



13-00000

Resource Requirements/impact

Note: Detailing two or three CIA reviewers to ARRB will
offset much of the negative impact of the move to IP. In
addition to controlling access to CIA records, these
reviewers would:

1)perform quality control review of documents prepared
for the Board at IP [processing mistakes have been a
continuing problem in the review] :

2)handle questions from the ARRB staff consulting with
project officer and IP HRG/DO reviewers as necessary

3)Review HSCA material being held by ARRB and 3rd

Agency documents [a DO reviewer would join the HRG
reviewers when documents were ready for DO review]

CONFIDENTIAL

MEMORANDUM FOR: Executive Director

THROUGH: Deputy Director for Operations
General Counsel
Director, Center for the Study
of Intelligence

FROM: John F. Pereira
Chief, Historical Review Group, CSI

SUBJECT: JFK Board Request for Transfer
of CIA Documents

(U) This memorandum is for your information. It
summarizés arrangements between CIA and the JFK
Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) to transfer
certain CIA records to the Board's offices.

(FOUO) Background: During a meeting with you on 16
October, ARRB Chairman John Tunheim requested that the
Agency transfer a large quantity of records related to the
JFK assassination. The request was based on the Board's
need to have the documents--totaling approximately 190,000
pages--reviewed by the Board's staff. Judge Tunheim and
other Board members consider it unworkable for their staff
to review the documents in the (Q@nternational Point )Building,
to which the records would be moved when the Center for the
Study of Intelligence moves there in mid-November. :

(C) The principal issue raised by the request is one of
control over and protéction of the sensitive CIA (mainly DO)
records once they are transferred to the Board's offices in
the District at 600 E Street, N.W. The Board has agreed to
construct a dedicated secure facility (SCIF), access to
which would be controlled by Agency personnel. {Rog
DCI Area Security Officer, has conducted a
preliminary survey of the space where the SCIF would be
located, and concludes that the proposed security te.

arrepgements wut beacceR able.
OPER SI SNe e oN

(FOUO) A second issue concerns funding for the
construction of the SCIF. There would also be additional
costs for installation of a secure telephone and a secure
fax, which are needed to allow secure communications with
(international Point). We are proposing that the Agency and
ARRB share the costs, but it is possible that the Agency
will be asked to reimburse the Board for whatever funds they

expend. In any event, we do not believe that the costs will
be great.



13-00000

(FOUO) Conclusion: Our judgement is that the Agency \ cake
should comply with the JFK Board's request to transfer the. re0! }
records, but that the ‘granstesPohould cieariy be documented
as temporary. The documents would be provided in
increments. Once the Board's staff has reviewed a group of
records, they would be returned to the Agency for final
review and sanitization, before they are released to the
National Archives. We plan to detail to the Board a small
number of reviewers from the Historical Review Group who
would control access to the documents and also assist in
coordinating the records review.

(FOUO) Unless you have objections, we plan to transfer
to the JFK Board the records requested by the Board's

Chairman. The will be contingent on the
installation of anfapproved security facility and’an
agreement on funding~

MEMORANDUM FOR: Executive Director
Assassination Records Review Board

FROM: John H. Hedley
Chair, CIA Publications Review Board
SUBJECT: Classification Review Process for Non-official .
Publications

1. I presently serve as the Chair of the Publications
Review Board (PRB) for the United States Central Intelligence
Agency (“CIA or. “Agency”) and have held this position since
January 1996. I also hold the position Chief of the Publications
Review Division, the entity which coordinates and otherwise
supports the review process of the Publications Review Board. I
have served as an intelligence officer for the CIA for 33 years
and have held a variety of senior positions of management and
analytical responsibility including serving as managing editor of
the Agency’s daily national intelligence publication and as
editor of the President’s Daily Brief. I have also served as
Deputy Director for Public Relations in the CIA’s Office of
Public Affairs. I hold a doctorate degree from the University of
Missouri, a masters from the University of Tulsa and an
undergraduate degree from the University of Kansas. I have
served as CIA Officer in Residence at the Institute for the Study
of Diplomacy in Georgetown University’s School of Foreign
Service, and currently teach a seminar entitled “CIA and the
Changing Role of U.S. Intelligence” at Georgetown.

2. The purpose of this memorandum is to provide the
Assassination Records Review Board with an understanding of the
classification review activities undertaken by the CIA’s
Publications Review Board vis-a-vis the personal writings of CIA
employees, former employees or other associates who, by virtue of
their secrecy agreement have an obligation to protect classified
information and submit personal writings for review pursuant to
that obligation.

3. The PRB deals primarily with the manuscripts of former
employees who are writing as private citizens; the information
they propose to publish is private property and proprietary in


13-00000

nature. Current employees normally submit material intended for
nonofficial publication through their supervisory chain of ,
command to their Deputy Director or Head of Independent Office.
However, any supervisory official in the author’s chain of
command may submit the material to the Board for a decision.

This may be done when the corporate process of a Board review is
deemed more appropriate because the proposed publication involves
the equities or expertise of more than one Directorate or
Independent Office or has Agency-wide implications. It is for
these reasons that the Center for the Study of Intelligence has
routinely sent manuscripts, written by both current and former
employees and under consideration for publication in Studies in
Intelligence, to the Publications Review Board.

4. All submissions deemed by the author as not containing:
classified information and any submissions having questions as to
proper classification have been reviewed! -- pursuant to the
personal manuscript standards -- to ensure the unclassified
nature of the article or to identify classified information and
suggest changes to eliminate classification concerns. When an
article has been deemed to contain classified information, and it
has been subsequently requested to be published in unclassified

~-““form or otherwise made available to the public, it has been
reviewed by the same process discussed previously to allow
declassification or the creation of a redacted (i.e., modified)
and hence unclassified version.

5. By deeming or marking a given article as classified, the
PRB represents only that this personal writing contains some
information of a classified nature by the US Govérnment; in our
view, that fact has not altered the nature of this private work
oer converted it into an official federal record containing
official government information. Indeed,.this practice of
marking has been followed (as required) whether the personal
writing is intended for publication in a classified version of
Studies or by a private publisher.

John H. Hedley

1 pursuant to Agency regulations, practice, and available resources, this
review may be conducted by the Historical Review Program, the concerned
operational component (current employees only), or, most frequently, by the.
Publications Review Board (PRB). The PRB is the primary organization
responsible for reviews of private writings proposed for publication; all
writings by former Agency employees (which constitute the vast majority of
private writings) are conducted by PRB.

_ MEMORANDUM FOR: Executive Director
Assassination Records Review Board

FROM: Brian S. Latell
Chairman, Editorial Board
Studies in Intelligence

SUBJECT: Mission, Character, and Publication Practices
of Studies in Intelligence

1. I am the Director of the Center for the Study of
Intelligence (“CSI”). for the US Central Intelligence Agency (“CIA
or “Agency”) and have held this position since September 1994. I
am also the Chairman of the Editorial Board (“Board”) for Studies
in Intelligence (“Studies”), a publication of CSI. I have served
as a foreign intelligence officer for the United States:
Government for nearly 36 years and, at CIA, have held a variety
of senior positions of management and analytical responsibility
including serving as a member of the National Intelligence
Council from.1980 to 1994 and as National Intelligence Officer
. (NIO) for Latin America for four of those years. I hold
doctorate, masters and undergraduate degrees from Georgetown
University, have served as a Visiting Scholar at the Hoover
Institution at Stanford University, and for the last twenty years
have held an appointment to the faculty of Georgetown
University’s School of Foreign Service as an Adjunct Professor.

2. The purpose of this memorandum is to provide the
Assassination Records Review Board with my view of the historical
mission, character, and publication practices of Studies as a
classified publication disseminated within the Intelligence
Community and in other versions as an unclassified publication
available to the public. :

3. The mission of Studies has been to promote scholarship
and reflection in intelligence literature and better the
understanding of the intelligence profession. Articles published
by Studies are intended for educational,and professional purposes
and present the personal, academic and professional views of
individual authors. The responsibility for accepting or

7:34 aM = 2/17/98


13-00000

om

rejecting articles that are submitted rests with the Board. A
key criterion for publication has been whether articles make a
contribution to the literature of intelligence; other criteria
include the originality, quality, and importance of the material.
Articles submitted have not been required to be coordinated
through official channels and, indeed, have not been routinely
vetted through management by either the Board or individual
authors. In addition to senior Agency officers, the Board also
has members who serve in senior positions in other agencies of
the Intelligence Community or who have in the past served in such
capacities.

4. In earlier years of the more than 40-year history of
Studies, articles were primarily written by then-current CIA
employees. In the past decade, however, Studies has been :
enriched by an increasing number of submissions by authors from
other components of the Intelligence Community, from members of
the academic cémmunity in the United States and abroad, and from
private citizens, most of whom have had some past intelligence
connection.

5. ‘once articles, intended either as classified or
unclassified, are submitted for consideration in Studies, they
are circulated to the members of the Board for their review. The
Board then decides whether an article meets the criteria for
publication and, if it does, begins the publication process. All
submissions deemed by the CIA author to be unclassified have been
submitted to CIA’s Publications Review Board (PRB) for
verification. If the Board is concerned about the level of
sensitivity of a classified article, it has sought opinions of
relevant experts as to whether the article, or portions of it,
.should be published or redacted. Such reviews historically have
been pursuant to the PRB’s standards for personal manuscripts and
not the more stringent standards for official CIA records.
Subsequently, articles are edited and published in one of the
quarterly classified issues of Studies. Most of the unclassified
articles published in this version are subsequently selected by
the Board to also be published in one of the two annual
unclassified issues of Studies.

6. The independence and integrity of the Board, and its
historical commitment to professional traditions, has never to my
knowledge been questioned by Agency management. I, as well as
several of my predecessors, can recall no cases of interference
by Agency management with the publication decisions of the Board,
no matter how controversial the subject matter or how critical an
author might be of CIA management. Indeed, Studies articles
historically embody the personal, professional research, and
reflections of their authors. The very intent of the journal is


professional and scholarly and this has been so from the founding
by the pre~eminent intelligence officer Sherman Kent in 1955.

7. %In sum, while Studies in Intelligence is published under
the auspices of the United States Government, articles
historically were neither intended to express official or
officially-sanctioned information nor have they been considered
to be an official release of official Executive Branch
information. Rather, Studies have been regarded as a forum for

, Personal, professional, and scholarly expressions of the authors.
