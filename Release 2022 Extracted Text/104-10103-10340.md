in Spein-(which:Eepinosa entered illegally), Espinosa was in-~
formed that.there is a. plan to:overthrow the Castro regime

and to kill. Castro.and some.of his main’ leaders. The plot is
led by Cubelef andsome of'the-March 13°Movement, plus (I be-
lieve) some:military officers; They-must move very quickly —

_ because: more ‘and «more people are. learning of ‘the plot and

there-is growing risk of exposure, ‘They are anxious to have
some coordination, .or at leeet- consultation, with responsible
Americens, ./ They ‘are :not:confident: that ‘they could ‘win an‘all-
out fight against the Cestro forces, and are ‘thinking more in
terms of taking control for a short time (perhaps only a few
hours) ,-killing Castro and his most ‘effective men “(thus
ruining -the Castro movement: forever), @nd then trying to hold
out..for as -long.as ‘feasible, ‘ It+is essential that ‘they know
what,-if anything,/:the Americans might“do to help, now and/or

running out. Espinosa's friends in Paris keep calling him,
cautiously asking whether there has been some "response",

but Espinosa has had to keep putting them off, Meanwhile,
the Cuban who was waiting in Spain for the answer has had to
return.” Espinosa keeps waitin’ to ‘hear whether the Americans
will play ball with ‘the Cibeldg ‘group. “The plot has lasted
for over 18 months, and the plotters plan to go ahead very
soon no matter whether the Americans “play ball" or not, One
veagon is that they almost have to go ahead now, for the plot

will soon be discovered and then it will be entirely hopeless.

Espinosa also referred to a jeweler by the name of
eppeizino spelling?), located at 47th Street, in New York
City. TeppéJiino works for CIA and has frequent contact with
the Cuban Ambassador, in Paris, . The Ambassador regularly dis~
poses of jewelry and other valuables made available from Cuba,
He does this through Tepp no. However, the latter fools
CIA. , For example, the Ambassador agrees to sell for $80,000.
Teppéliino informs CIA the price is §110,000, and quietly
pockets the difference, On the other hand, Teppéjtino and

CIA think the Cuban Ambassador does not know he is working for
CIA, but the Ambassador does know,

Espinosa is determined to bring the very dengerous
situation o€ the Cuban plot to the attention of some top level
official in the United States Government unless he receives
at leact some reply from CIA.

Comment :

Espinosa was not overly tense and did not indulge in his-
trionics, but I felt he was quite determined to push this
matter further if he did not get some response within the very.
near future. I cannot, and do not have to, judge his reli-
zbility on the basis of this one conversation, However, af 1
had to guess at thie point I would be inclined to accept most
of what he said about actual events. But of course there are
all sorts of obvious possibilities, including provocation,

In accordance with what we agreed on, while Espinosa was
