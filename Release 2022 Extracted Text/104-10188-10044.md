PROJECT BRIEFING

LIENVOY WH ~- Mexico a
ADDP approval of renewal 1 Feb 63 - 31 Jan 64
Project provides for a joint CIA/Mexican Government
telephone tap center and for a nonofficial liaison rela-
tionship which provides access to the highest levels of
the Mexican Government. All Soviet and Czechoslovak
installations and major anti-U.S. elements are covered
by the operation. | -

Project has provided Station with a channel to the
President of Mexico which is effective, rapid and covert,
and was particularly worthwhile in making arrangements
for President Kennedy's visit to Mexico in June 1962.
The Mexican President was also briefed ‘on the Cuban
situation through this channel. The joint tap center
provides coverage of 30 lines yielding positive and CI
information of value. Division reports 236 positive
disseminations on a variety of topics with concentration
on Communist and anti-U.S. activity. A large amount of
information not disseminated 1s used by other U.S.
agencies in Mexico. The Station feels that this opera-
tion contributes greatly to the present friendly attitude
of Mexican Government leaders toward U.S. policies.

FI oyeration employing audio surveillance and liaisen-on-the
highest governaent level

: 1. PI/UM files contain 255 positive inforaation disseminations
produced by Project LIENVCY during calendar year 1962 — 130 regular CS
dissemination, 116 teletrre reports on subjects of current or priority
interest, and nine transnittals of official documents from Communist or
leftist orgartzations in Mexico, LIENVOY reports provided information

on the Nexican Corrmunist Party (PON), the Popular Socialist Party (PPS),
the now but 4nereasingly rewerful National Liberation Novement (MLN) —

an anti-U3, proZuba Com: Front, on other Fron or leftist organize-
tions, ant on Individuals sctive in these organizations. Among the persons
of intelligence interest most extensively reportat on were Vicente LOMRARDO
Toledano, head of the PPS and an official in the Norld Federation of Trade
Unions; Jorge L. TAMAYO Castillefos, an avowed Marxist appointed to a
govornment position; Braulic 'ALDONADO Sandez, Conmunist former governor
of ja California; the former president of Mexicg General Lazaro CARDENAS

countries; on Communist ani leftist publications; on Prensa Latina and
other Cuban propaganda efforcs in Mexico; on the reaction of Maclean and

secretly by pro-Commihist nesters of the MIN. Anong the disseminations

which had to ¢o with Cuba, a tumber reported the transshipment of goods, a
subject of special intellisence interest and one, which reported the views
of high-level government officials concerning the Cuban crisis, was described

by OCIts analyst as extrenciy valuable.

REQUFST FOR PHOJECT LIEXVOY RENEWAL

A. Current Objectives,

The objectives of this project remain the same as those stated in
the last renewal request, The project continues to provide the Mexico
Station with a scooth and rapid channel to Mexico's highest political
figures, The Principal Acent continues to be a close associate of rres LOPEZ
Mateos .° The intercept center has undergone no major changes during
the past year,

1, ARDE-6 Objectives Priority A, 1, a; Priority A, 3, 3, b, ¢;
and Priority B, 2 and 3 continue to be effectively covered by this
project. Cordial and friendly relations continue between
Government of Nexico leaders and the Chief of Station, Mexico,
During the past year, the Chief of Station, Mexico, at the
request of the Chief, ODAGID, Mexico, has held a nunber of covert
meetings with .treéifnt to convey ODYOKE policy ma.ters,

Chief, ODACID, renains pleased with ibis access to Mexics:

officials,

2, ALL Soviet and Czechoslovak installations in
Mexieo City are covered by this project, The Case Officer
for Soviet Operations and the Case Officer for Soviet Satellite
Operations rely heavily on this product for operational ‘leads
and data to support double agent operations.

3. All zajor -PBPRINE elements. in Mexico City ere
covered by this project,

4, Targets of opportunity which appear to be hostile
eritical to PEPRIME or to the present Government of Mexico ere
covered by this project, :

4
All major objectives of the project are being effectively reslizat,

B, Changes,

At a yet to be aetersined date, 1t 1s planned to move the {1
center from its present location, ‘Two reasons are behind this
1) security, since the present base has been used for almost three years:
and 2) to provide the center with more mobile equipment, Such equfpcent
1s now under consideration by KURIOP and when it becoues availedle, an
amendment to this project will be forwarded requesting approval for the
transfer of the intercept center,

The activities report forwarues. to heaaquarters ench month Lists
the intelli reports received from Unis project, During 1962 there

were 534 intelligence reports produced by this project which were
forwarded to Headquarters through 1 December 10¢2, All of these
concerned HED-6 reporting priorities and current requirements levied
by Headquarters and the ODACID instellation,

In addition, this project produces a large amount of information
which is not disseminated on a current basis but is reported to ODACID,
ODENVY and other ODYOKE agencies in reply to o steady stream of routine
file trace requests, These file trace requests run into the thousands
each month, It would be difficult to determine the exact percentage of
the information produced by LIENVOY; but in many Instances Involving
prominent Mexican Government officials, larce portions of the file came
to us through LIENVOY coverage,

D. Effectiveness,

‘The LIENVOY project provides the Station with a channel to the
highest level of the Mexican Government which fs both effective and
rapid as well as covert, The Station continues to receive the daily
“resumen” highlights from the thirty (30) lines covered. A high
percentage of current intelligenes ic disseminated fron these datly

: reports, In eddition, full transcripts are received on Soviet and
Czech ‘Lines and on any of the thirty targets we may request. A good
part of this 1s personality data useful only to KUDARK and in come cases
to ODEMWVY, In addition. the project provides a cupport mechanism for
covering targets of interest to KUGARK or other ODYOKE agencies,

E. Problems,

‘There have been no significant security, cover, control or liaison
problems during, the past year, z

F, Ltatson.

From a liaison point of view, the Station believes that this project
contriuutes greatly to the present friendly attitude of the Mexican

Government leadelS toward ODYOKE policies, ‘The liaison remains
clandestine in nature though contacts between the Chief of Station and Pres LOFES

Mateos are usually made at the request of the Chief, OVACID, Mexico,

G. fnterareney Gooniinatton.

The Chief, ODACID, Mexico, is the only ODYOXE representative in
Hexico outside KUSANK who is awere of this project. His role has been
