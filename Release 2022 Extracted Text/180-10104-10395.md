I can surmise,

Nevertheless chere are a few nf the more significant points

developed from Ray:

when Ray was interviewed by the Fel concerning the visit that

with Rays organization JURE, Ray was not told that themen

claimed that association and he was not told that. odio was

specifically introduced

that he was simply told that

Lee Harvey Oswald once came to hier door and that the Felagent

wanted to know from him whether she was mentally stable..

Ray's first contact with the American EmbassySin Havana was

when he was working underground. for Castro before the Revolution.

That was in 1958-and it

was with a man named Cadwell. (Question:

Howard Hunt (whose book "Give Us This Day" he says is full
