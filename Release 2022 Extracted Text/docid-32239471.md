Final Determination Notification

AGENCY : HSCA

RECORD NUMBER

: 180-10060-10463

RECORD SERIES

: STAFF PAYROLL RECORDS

AGENCY FILE NUMBER

Heleased under the John F.

Kennedy Assassination

Records Collection Act of

1992 (44 USC 2107 Note].

Case#:Nw 66261 Date:

09-01-2022

December 8, 1995

Status of Document:

Postponed in Part

Number of releases of previously postponed information: 19

Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors

including: (a) the significant historical interest in the document in question; (b) the

absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United

States or to any individual.

Number of Postponements: 15

Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.

Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could

reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that invasion of

privacy would be so substantial that it outweighs the public interest.

Substitute Language: SSN

Date of Next Review: 2017
