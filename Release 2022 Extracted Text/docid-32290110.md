A. GAMBLING
T. BOOKMAKING

Investigation of bookmaking in the New Orleans

Area has revealed that up through September 13, 1961,
- bookmakers were receiving results of out-of-state races
through Nola Printing Company, the local race wire service,
which discontinued operations on that date because of the
existence of new Federal legislation pertaining to inter-
state gambling activities. Investigation has disclosed that
since September 13, 1961, bookmakers in the New Orleans Area
have not been able to obtain out-of-state race results on
the same day that races are run. They have had to rely on
race results obtained through legitimate news media, and
the New Orleans Times Picayune Newspaper has been their prin-
cipal source of this information, in so far as horse races
are concerned. Investigation has disclosed that from September
13, 1961, to November 23, 1961, local bookmakers' business
was seriously curtailed; however, the New Orleans Fair Grounds
Race Trask began its 1961 winter meet on November 23, 1961.
This meet continued until March 10, 1962. During the period
of the Fair Grounds' meet, local bodkmakers* business picked
up considerably and again’ fell off after March 10, 1962.

a. NOLA PRINTING COMPANY, 530 IRIS AVENUE, JERFERSON
PARISH, LOUISIANA : i :

Our investigation of Nola Printing Company
during the past five years has disclosed that it was
the race wire service for this section of the United
States. Nola operated until September 13, 1961,
when it terminated its race wire service on that
date, which was the day President KENNEDY signed
into law Federal legislation concerning interstate
gambling activities.

PCI's RAYMOND L, ROLLING and ALBERT L.
PILSBURY, JR., both of whom are cognizant of gambling
activities in Jefferson Parish, have advised that
Nola had exclusive territorial rights to furnish
results of horse races to bookmakers in Louisiana,
Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas, East Texas, and
some Eastern States, but not Florida. ROLLING has
been a bookmaker in Jefferson Parish for many years
and subscribed to Nola's service. PELSBURY has been

in various gambling casinos.
: In addition to providing the results
of horse races by telephone communications facilities,
Nola also publishes the Daily Sports Bulletin, which
lists the horses and odds .on races being run at
most of the tracks throughout the United States.
With regard to the odds published by the Daily Sports
Bulletin, these are the odds established each morn-
ing by the racing Secretaries at the various race
tracks and are the odds that appear on paramutual
boards ‘at thés@ttrabkssghortly before the beginning
of each race. The racing schedules listed in the

pany. -On December 17, 1957, PCI ROLLING advised
‘that. Nola is managed by PORETTO; that it is the
general opinion.among bookmakers in Jefferson Parish
that Nola is controlled by CARLOS MARCELLO and that
one of MARCELLO{s brothers, JOSEPH, was made a partner
ef Nola to oversee the operation and protect CARLOS
MARCELLO's interest.

On July 13, 1961; July 20, 1961, and
September 5, 1961, PCI ROLLING, who then operated
a horse race book in Jefferson Parish, advised
that Nola was still furnishing horse race informa-
tion to bookmakers. On September 20, 1961, Attorney
HILLARY J. GAUDIN, New Orleans, advised he is the
Attorney for Nola. He identified PORETTO as one
of the partners of Nola and stated that Nola is

in the business of disseminating results of horse
races, but ceased operating as a race wire service
on September 13, 1961. On February 2, 1962, PORETTO
advised SA REGIS L, KENNEDY that Nola Printing Com-
pany is not putting out race results for the New
Orleans Fair Grounds Race Track or any other race
track. He said he would not reactivate Nola as a
race wire service as long as there is any doubt
about the new Federal legislation pertaining - to
interstate gambling,

After Nola ceased its operations, on.
September 13, 1961, investigation disclosed that
bookmakers in Jefferson Parish and the New Orleans
Area began to receivéix results of races being run
at the New Orleans Fair Grounds Race Track when
that track opened its winter meet on Thanksgiving
Day, November 23, 1961. On December 7, 1961, PCI
HOWARD DANIEL BAUTSCH, who operates a horse race.
book at Manuel's Restaurant, 952 Jefferson Highway,
advised that he had been receiving race results
from the Fair Grounds since November 23, 1961. He
Said he did not know who. was operating the service
but ABEL JOHN CHAUVIN had contacted him about buyipe
the service. BAUTSCH said the service consisted of
actual broadcast of the races as they were being
run at the Fair Grounds, It is to be noted that
the 1961 winter meet of the Fair Grounds operated
from November 23, 1961, to March 10, 1962. This
track has only one meet a year, which begins each
year on Thanksgiving Day.

CHAUVIN's service ran through December 21,
1961. On December 22, 1961, PCI ROLLING advised
that on the previous day CHAUVIN announced over his
wire service that he had received information that
somebody, without his authority, was "bootlegging"
his service to the Mississippi Gulf Coast in viola~
tion of the new Federal laws pertaining to inter-
state gambling. ROLLING said CHAUVIN commented
that if this illicit transmission did not discontinue
immediately his service would shut down. ROLLING
said that on December 22, 1961, when bookmakers
called CHAUVIN service for Fair Grounds results
of that day they were advised that the service had
been discontinued.

CHAUVIN was interviewed on March 14, 1962,
and he advised that he had operated a race wire ser=-
vice from November 23, 1961, to December 21,.1961,
discontinuing it -because he received information. ae

that individuals unknown to him and without his’
authority were “bootlegging” his service to the
Mississippi Gulf Coast. CHAUVIN said he operated
this service from 3646 Airline Highway, Jefferson
Parish, utilizing 18 telephones in this place.

(in this connection, investigation of Nola Print-
ing Company disclosed that this was the central
point from which Nola's race wire service was dissemi-
nated when Nola was in operation.) CHAUVIN said
JOSEPH A. PORETTO and Nola Printing Company had no
connection with his race wire service and that he
was renting the premises at 3646 Airline Highway
from JOSEPH PORETTO and JOSEPH MARCELLO, who owned
the property. CHAUVIN claimed that he had only
approximately 17 paying subscribers to his service
and complained that one of his main difficulties
in operating the service was that bookmakers in
Jefferson Parish were stealing it and not paying
for it. He said he determined that some 80 book-
makers were actually receiving. the service but only
about 17 were paying him for it.

ANTHONY JOSEPH LUPO was interviewed by
Agents at Nola Printing Company, 530 Iris Avenue,
on June 22, 1962. LUPO identified himself as
the publisher of the Daily Sports Bulletin. He
said the Bulletin is still being published and
that is the only activity taking place at 530 Iris’
Avenue. LUPO said in the old days Nola employed
25 to 30 men but now there were only four or five
men on the payroll and only about 600 copies of
the Daily Sports Bulletin are printed each day.
LUPO said these are sold only in Louisiana and
none are mailed out of the State, as he does not
desire to become involved in a possible violation
of any of the new Federal legislation pertaining
to interstate gambling activities.

After ABEL JOHN CHAUVIN cut off his
service to local bookmakers on December 22, 1961,
PCI RAYMOND ROLLING said that for a few days
there was no organized service from the Fair Grounds.
On January 5, 1962, ROLLING said that SAM SAIA,
a long-time bookmaker in the New Orleans area, was
then providing results of Fair Grounds races only

to bookmakers along Jefferson Highway in Jefferson
Parish. On February 2, 1962, ROLLING said service
from the Fair Grounds had been very poor since CHAUVIN
ceased operating in December and at that time various
bookmakers had devised their own systems of obtaining
race results from the Fair Grounds on an individual
basis. He said that, to cut down expensés, they

were sharing the results with each other,

The following is a summary of investigations conducted
by the New Orleans Office since Nola Printing Company went out
of business as a race wire service in September, 1961. Thése
investigations dd:os not reveal that there is any race wire ser-
vice available to bookmakers in the New Orleans Metropolitan
area which would enable them to pay off winning bettors on
the same day that out-of-state races are run.”

Nola Printing Company went out of business in September,
1961, none of the bookmakers in the New Orleans area are
receiving out of state race results on the same day that
races are being run. All three have pointed out that
because of the fact that no race wire service is available
in the New Orleans area, they are unable to past post book-
makers in this area, They advised that one of the essential
elements to a successful past posting operation is that the
victim bookmaker must be handling considerable action and be
busily occupied in his profession. Since there is no race
wire service in the New Orleans area at this time, the
business of the bookmakers has been seriously affected with
the result that they are unable to past post these books.

In this connection, WARE said he has traveled
throughout Louisiana, both before and after September, 1961
and has found that the same conditions exist in such areas
as Monroe, Shreveport, Baton Rouge and Lake Charles, Louisiana.
He explained that without a race ‘wire service in the Louisiana
area, bookmaking business is "dead" and as long as it remains
"dead" he cannot successfully past post bookmakers,

HOWARD DANIEL BAUTSCH, a PCI who is active as a
bookmaker at 952 Jefferson Highway, which is Manuel's Restaurant
and Bar, advised on May 22, 1962 and July 13, 1962 that there
is no service in the New Orleans area providing the identities
and the mutual prices of winners of horse races at out of state

“ racetracks, BAUTSCH stated that there has been no race wire
service since Nola Printing Company terminated its operations
in September, 1961. He stated that this has greatly affected
his business and the business of other bookmakers in the New
Orleans Metropolitan area. BAUTSCH stated that he relies on
the daily racing form and the two New Orleans newspapers for
his out of state race results and pays his customers who
make winning bets on the day following the races, after he
has ‘read the race results in these publications. He stated that

| NW 68262 Docld:32290110 Page 7


Oy

NO 92-390/lam

this same procedure is used by all the other bookmakers in

the area. He said that his volume of business prior to
September, 1961 was so large that he is positive that if

race wire service was available in the New Orleans area, it

would be offered to him; therefore he is positive that no a
such service is available. a

PCI RAYMOND’ L. ROLLING, also an active bookmaker
in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, advised on April.16 and
September 12, 1962, that there is no race wire service in
the New Orleans area and there has been none since Nola we
Printing Company terminated its service in September, 1961. :

Recently, information has come to the attention
of this office concerning two sources through which some
bookmakers and betters can obtain the identities of lninning i
horses at out of state racetracks,

On June 6, 1962, EDWARD WARE, oR. referred to
above, advised that within the past few weeks he had been
able to obtain some of the winning horses at: out of state
racetracks between 45 minutes to 14 hours after the races
were run. He said he contacted. three different individuals 3
in the city who occasionally would have the identities of - 2
winning.horses only. These individuals would not have the E
identities of place and show horses nor would they have the {|
paramutual prices on these horses, WARE stated the source |
of this information was an employee of the New Orleans Times |
Picayune Newspaper who obtained the race information from the | ;
Associated Press Sports Ticker. This employee would then go |!
out ‘to a barroom located at the corner of St. Charles and | r
Poydras Streets which is near the Times Picayune Building '
where he would make the information available. WARE said the
information was never ayailable after 4:00 PM each day which
indicated to him that the employee of the newspaper got off from
work at that time. He said that the racing information
provided through this source was not complete-enough or reliable

| Nw 68262 Docld:32290110 Page 8


i NO 92-390/lam

enough for bookmakers to pay off bets and could only be
used by some to satisfy their curiousity as to what horses
may have won races at some of the Eastern tracks. WARE
said that on some afternoons the source would only be able
to provide the names of one or two winning horses at only

i one track and on other afternoons the source might have the
i names of considerably more winners but on no occasion has
this source ever had enough information to enable bookmakers
to use the information in connection with their business.

On September 21, 1962, WARE advised that he had
determined that the employee at the Times Picayune Newspaper
I is a person named "TONY and that TONY is a relative of a
person named "JUNIOR" who he understands is a partner of
NICK NUCCIO, a bookmaker in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana.

i Investigation is continuing to determine the

P identity of the Times Picayune employee and the identities
[ of the individuals utilizing the information supplied by
this employee.

With regard to the other source of out of state
race information available to certain bookmakers and betters,
Mr. &. CHANDLER JOSEY, Special Agent, Southern Bell Telephone
and Telegraph Company, New Orleans, advised on September 18,
1962 that he was investigating a matter where an unknown
individual was using pay telephones in the New Orleans area
to make long distance calls to Chicago telephone Number WE-
9-1900, The individual making these calls to this number is
retrieving the change he uses in making these calls thereby
defrauding the telephone company of the revenue of these
calls. JOSEY advised that he had determined that this Chicago
telephone number dispenses horse race information approximately
30 minutes after races have been run. He said that this
information is apparently put on a tape recording so that
when any person calls the number they can receive the infor-
mation along with a short commercial announcement advertising
a publication known as "The Green Sheet". Mr. JOSEY stated

| NW 68262 Docld:32290110 Page 9



NO 92-390/iam

that the identity of winning horses at various racetracks
are given along with the paramutual prices on the winning
horses. He said that this telephone number does not
dispense the identities of second and third place horses
or the paramutual prices on these horses.

In this connection, PCI EDWARD WARE, JR., advised
on September 21, 1962 that he was aware of the Chicago
telephone number and he had called this number for his own
personal use to find out whether a particular horse he may
have bet on had actually won. WARE said calling parties
cannot determine the identities of second and third place
horses through this number nor can they obtain the mutual
prices for second and third place horses. He said the
information which could be obtained by calling this number
was not complete enoughtfor any bookmaker to utilize the ,
information obtained in connection with his wagering business
as a bookmaker must have complete results,. which would include
the three winning horses of each race at each major race-
track in the country.

Investigation. is continuing to determine additional

information concerning this telephone number and the use of
this number by betters and bookmakers in the New Orleans area,

With regard to these football parley cards,
EDGAR BABCOCK, operator of the Dixie Kitchen Lounge,
711 Metairie Road, Metairie, Louisiana, a suburb of the
City of New Orleans, located in Jefferson Parish, advised
he is currently operating a horse race book at the Dixie
Kitchen Lounge. BABCOCK stated he did not handle football
parley cards during the past football season because he
had bad luck financially with a football parley card of
his own which he tried to promote about two years ago.
BABCOCK said his own parley card was called the Buzzing
Bee card and he almost went broke when he had a large
number of winning piayers for two successive weekends,
based.on poor "line" information he was receiving from
Manuel's Restaurant on Jefferson Highway in Jefferson
Parish.

PCI ANTHONY WILLIAM FREDO who claims he is one

of the best handicappers of the football games in the country

and who claims to have worked for LEO SCHAFFER in Canada,
Chicago, and Terre Haute, Indiana, has advised that anyone
successfully operating football parley cards would have to
receive good handicapping information, FREDO stated that
he knows of no one in Louisiana who is good enough to
handicap college and professional football games and that
the "line" used by successful football parley card operators
would have to come from somewhere out of Louisiana, as he,
FREDO refuses to give his selections to any of the gamblers
in the New Orleans area, FREDO who is now an insurance
salesman, advised he still handicaps college and profes~
sional football games merely as an avocation but he does
sell this information to Maison Blanche Department Store
in New Orleans who publishes his selections under the
caption, "Mr, VIP" in Maison Blanche ads on the sports
pages of New Orleans newspapers each Friday during the
football season,

On May 18, 1962, NY 3368-C-TE was interviewed
by Agents of. the New York’ Office. New York has advised
that this informant has. been associated with the higher.
members of the criminal element in the New York City
metropolitan area for a numbercof years. During this
period he recalled the names of a number of individuals
who were either talked about or pointed out to him as
members of the Italian criminal syndicate from various
areas of the, United States. One of these individuals
was CARLOS. MARCELLO of New Orleans.

The Philadebphia Office has a confidential

source who overheard a conversation in the Sicilian dialedt

tion. the comment was made that CARLOS MARCELLO is the

i represéntando officiale from New Orleans. These individuals
t were discussing the Government's efforts to deport MARCELLO
and they mentioned that MARCELLO is acquainted with SANTO

Nola Printing Company and one of the five partners of this
business which up until September, 1961, disseminated race
horse information and the results of races at.all tracks
throughout the United States to bookmakers inithe New .

has revealed that he operates the Town and Country Restaurant
and Lounge, 1221 Airline Highway, Jefferson Parish, Louisiana.

Efforts are being made to develop PORETTO as a top
echelon informant. ‘

On February 2, 1962, PORETTO advised that Nola
Printing Company was. not disseminating racing results
from any race. track including the New Orleans Fair Grounds
Track, He said he is not going to reinstitute Nola Race
Wire Service as long as there is any doubt about the new

DI PIAZZO, commonly known as SAM DI PIAZZA, resides

at No. 6 Pamela Place, Arabi, Louisiana. On December 17, 1957,
former CI, ALBERT L. PILSBURY, JR., who personally knows

DX PIAZZO and who has worked in DI PIAZZO's book making estab-
lishment, advised that he considered DI PIAZZO a big time

book maker. PILSBURY, who is a book maker and professional
gambler, said DI PIAZZO was then operating a book making
establishment at 1609 Angela Street in Arabi. PILSBURY stated
DI PIAZZO had several contacts working in the telephone company
in New Orleans who were making free long distance telephone
calls for him in connection with his gambling activities.

On January 10, 1958, information furnished by PILSBURY
was confidentially supplied to Mr. DRURY THOMPSON, Legal
Division, Southern Bell Telephone Company, New Orleans. Mr.
THOMPSON said that since June of 1957 Southern Bell had suspected
that some of its employees were making free long distance tele-
hone calls for individuals in the New Orleans area and efforts
were being made to determine the extent and scope of their
activities. Mr. THOMPSON identified four telephone company employees
who were making free long distance telephone calls and furnished
a list of telephone numbers in various sections of the United
States which had been obtained by the telephone company during
its oo

On instructions of the Bureau the information furnished

c+ PROSTITUTION

Sgt. FRED SOULE, Commanding Officer, New Orleans

Police Department, Vice Squad, advised September 21, 1962,

that prostitution activities in the City of New Orleans are
curtailed and closed almost completely. He advised that NORMA
WALLACE, operator of the largest house of prostitution in the
south at 1026 Conti Street, was arrested July 2, 1962, and
subsequently sentenced to 90 days in jail. SOULE advised

that this is NORMA WALLACE's first and only conviction although
she has been operating a house of prostitution in New Orleans
for the past 30 years. Her house at 1026 Conti Street is
closed and up for sale. NORMA WALLACE is an informant of the
New Orleans Office and states that she does not intend to
reopen 1026 Conti Street as a house of prostitution and hopes

‘ to sell it for $75,000. Another New Orleans madam, SUE

HENDRICKS, was arrested by the District Attorney's Office
according to SOULE and is now awaiting trial and she has given

“up her activities. SOULE advised that he is currently working
on the prostitution activities of a number of New Orleans cab
drivers who are operating with individual prostitutes. These
girls are working primarily in the larger hotels and motels
such as the Roosevelt Hotel, Monteleone Hotel and the Fontainebleau
Motor Hotel. SOULE advised that the house detectives in these
places are protecting these prostitutes. SOULE stated that he
has been able with the cooperation of the management at some

of these places to send disguised Vice Officers into the estab-
lishment, secure prostitution dates, and has a number of cases
pending against individual prostitutes. ‘

Deputy Sheriff JOSEPH BATTAGLIAA, Jefferson Parish
Sheriff's Office, advised on September 7, 1962, that the
Sheriff's Office of Jefferson Parish has been tedeing a lot
of action in Jefferson Parish against prostitution in Jefferson
Parish, and making numerous arrests, however, this is strictly
“show boating". He stated that while the prostitutes are _
arrested they are usually released immediately and no action
is ever takan by the District Attorney's Office. BATTAGLIA®
advised that the following are the principal locations ‘in**”
Jefferson Parish where prostitution activities are going on:

in the Huey Distributing Company, a pinball and music
distributor, which is one of the business interests
pelonging to the MARCELLOs. CARLOS MARCELLO has reported
income on his tax returns from the Huey Distributing Company.
Deputy Sheriff GILLESPIE advised on October 7, 1958, that
one of MARCELLO's daughters had been hired by the Parish

of Jefferson and was employed in the office of PHILLIP SMITH,
then the Parish Attorney.

Information is available indicating a close
alignment between CARLOS MARCELLO and Louisiana Governor
JIMMIE H. DAVIS. In this regard, on May 4, 1961, Mr,
CHARLES W. ERDMANN, Civil Defense Director for the City
of New Orleans, furnished information to this office that
CARLOS MARCELLO endeavored to help him receive from Governor
DAVIS the appointment as New Orleans Civil Defense Director.
Mr. ERDMANN said he wanted it known that he did not solicit
MARCELLO's assistance, nor did he feel that MARCELLO's
actions in any way aided in his receiving this appointment.
He said that on March 14, 1961, at the suggestion of the
then Mayor of New Orleans, DE LESSEPS S, MORRISON, he
went to the office of Mr. CHARLES SPENCER, who was formerly
President of Jefferson Parish... Mayor MORRISON felt that
ERDMANN should seek Mr. SPENCER's assistance in getting
the appointment of Civil Defense Director. On his arrival
at Mr. SPENCER's office, ERDMANN found that CARLOS MARCELLO
was then in SPENCER's office. MARCELLO told ERDMANN that he
was going to Baton Rouge to see Governor DAVIS on the
following morning and that he wanted to recommend to the
Governor that ERDMANN receive the appointment. . MARCELLO
said he was doing this as a personal favor not only for
ERDMANN but for Mr, SPENCER, At MARCELLO's insistence,
ERDMANN prepared a short resume of his background and left
the resume at the Town and Country Motel as MARCELLO had
suggested. On March 24,1961, MARCELLO telephoned ERDMANN
and criticized ERDMANN for having had Mayor MORRISON write
a letter recommending ERDMANN's appointment. MARCELLO
said that Governor DAVIS had not been pleased with receiving
the letter of nomination from the Mayor.

Parish coin machine distributor and a bail bondsman in
Jefferson Parish, advised that thére is no doubt in his
mind that Sheriff JOHN G. FITZGERALD has allowed gamblers
to operate in Jefferson Parish. DARGIS said that persons
interested in seeing gambling operate in the parish have
“wined and dined" FITZGERALD ever/since he became Sheriff.
DARGIS said he has heard ‘rumors that FITZGERALD has been
provided with women whenever he wanted. them, and in this
way, persons interested in seeing gambling continue have
more or less compromised FITZGERALD to the extend that it
is difficult for him to turn down their requests or refuse
them whenever they ask for a favor.

On September 12, 1962, PCI RAYMOND L, ROLLING
advised of a conversation he recently had with AL SCHORLING
after SCHORLING had been drinking. Investigation concerning
the Chesterfield Club, a gambling casino in Jefferson
Parish, has disclosed that SCHORLING is connected with
the operation of that club. SCHORLING told ROLLING that the
profits of the Chesterfield Club are split as follows:

AL SCHORLING - 10%; ALBERT J. SALZER - 20%;

FRANK L, TRIDICO - 10%; CARLOS and JOSEPH
MARCELLO - 30%; SALVADOR BOHEMIA - 10%;

Jefferson Parish District Attorney FRANK

LANGRIDGE - 10%; Sheriff JOHN G. FITZGERALD - 10%.

SCHORLING told ROLLING that he was the one. who
"took care" of the District. Attorney and Sheriff FITZGERALD.
ROLLING advised that he is of the opinion that the reason
CARLOS and JOSEPH MARCELLO receive 30% of the profits of
the. Chesterfield Club is because CARLOS MARCELLO is the
person responsible for insuring that the Chesterfield Club
can operate unmolested and without harassment by state.

Agents interviewed JOSEPH TARANTO at the 406 Club
in Biloxi on April 13, 1962, and he admitted making local
pets on sporting events and paying off on the bases of resul\
received through regular news media. He claimed he had
discontinued gambling and bookmaking operations of an
interstate nature since September, 1961,and because he cannot
obtain race wire service, he refuses to take bets on horses
at least fifteen minutes prior to published post times in
order to avoid being past posted. TARANTO said he was
getting out-of the bookmaking business because it is no
longer financially successful.

On July 23, 1962, HARRY BENNETT told Agents he was
still accepting local bets but denied having anything.to do with
bookmaking activities having an interstate character.

€. PROSTITUTION

Principal prestitution activity in the Southern

Judicial District of Mississippi is centered on the Gulf
Cosst. For some time this Office has been conducting investi-~
gation concerning a large prostitution ring operating in the
Gulf Coast area. This case is entitled, "HUGH R. BROACH, JR.;
JGSEPH ASA GARRIGA, EY AL} VIRGINIA ARAIM, aka., ET AL; WSTA =
CONSPIRACY," (Bureau Pile 31-89143; New Orleans File 31-7380).
Et is expected that this case will be presented to a Federal

Grand Jury in the Southern District of Mississippi about October

1, 1962.

On February 28, 1962, NO 1017.— C, who has been
asseciated with members of the criminal element for the past

20 years, advised SA PERCY V. RICHARDSON that the only organized

prostitution on the Mississippi Gulf Coast is that operated

by JOSEPH ASA GARRIGA, JR:, and his brother, EDDIE CARL GARRIGA, .

out of theig night club, Bob and Joe's Lounge, Pat Harrison
Avenue, Biloxi, Mississippi. This Informant said the GARRIGAs
have worked prostitutes from Mobile, Alabama, and New Orleans
and Bogalusa, Louisiana,

On Harch 1, 1962, DOROTHY ALLEN CORTEZ, a narcotics
addict and prostitute, advised in confidence when interviewed

Lounge as a house of prostitution utilizing girls from New
Grleans and other locales. The place is patronized primarily
by service men from nearby Keesler Air Force Base and dates

ave filled in the cabins lecated in the rear of the Lounge.

The Informant said ASA GARRIGA is known for his brutal treat~
ment of Bis girls and said he makes it a policy te personally

in the Harrison County Jail at Gulfport. GARRIGA came to her
cell in the jail and agreed to go her bond if she would agree
to hustle for him. Informant said thereafter she had sexual re-
lations with GARRIGA im an apartment on the first fleor of

the Harrison County Jail and, two or three days later, GARRIGA
made her bond.

On April 10, 1962, NO 1017 ~ C (identified above)

‘advised that ASA and EDDIE GABRIGA had apparently leased the

Beb and Joe's Lounge to IVAN “LANEY” ORRELS. Informant believes
ORRELS was merely a front for the GARRAGAs. On March 30, 1962,
ORRELS, when interviewed at Bob and Jee*’s Lounge, told Agents
he had leased this place from ASA GARRIGA and he was now the
sole owner. Gn September 14, 1962, NO 1178 « C, a prostitute,
advised that ASA GARRIGA was then trying to open a joint at
Pass Christian, Mississippi, with the aid of Constable BRAVO
WOODCOCK, with the. place to be operated by a girl friend of
WOODCCCK’s. The Infermant said that Bob and Joe's Lounge

has been closed since about the middle of August, 1962, when
Sheriff CURTIS ©, DEDEAUX raided the place and arrested IVAN
"LANEY" ORRELS and his associates. The Informant stated that
Sheriff DEDEAUK has had a “falling out" with both ORRELS and
ASA GARRIGA for some unknown reason. The Informant said that °*
recently she heard that DEDEAUX was madgat GARRIGA because

of some slurring remark GARRIGA had recently made concerning

NO 1002-C said all of the above obtain their
whiskey from Louisiana distributors, and all are believed
to sell whiskey in areas outside Harrison County, as well
aS.in Harrison County.

On September 13, 1962, NO 1115-C, Bay St. Louis,
Mississippi, who is acquainted with criminal activities
in that area, advised that Stieffel Brothers is a whole-
sale liquor distributer at Waveland, Mississippi. Infor-

mant said Hancock County Sheriff GERALD V. PRICE, SR. is aa4

rted to have recently purchased an interest in Stieffel

from whiskey coming through Hancock County destined for
wholesalers in adjoining Harrison County. if

Investigation has revealed that "moonshiners"
in Pearl River County are the principal sources of
“Roonshine" whiskey in the Southern Judicial District of
Mississippi. On April 4, 1962, ROLAND CRANFORD, Alcohol

EB. BOMBINGS

On June 12, 1961, the personal automobile of
Sheriff DEDEAUX, who then lived in Mississippi City,
was demolished by explosives as the car sat in front of the

. DEDEAUX apartment at about 2:30 AM. Buring the early -

morning hours of September 2, 1962, the private plane of
District Attorney J, BOYCE HOLLIMAN was destroyed by a
bemb at Wiggins, Mississippi.

With regard to bombing of DEDEAUX's automobile,
on February 13, 1962, NO 1017-C, anassociate of the
criminal element on the Gulf Coast and a former tavern
owner there, advised it was generally believed among the
criminal element of Harrison County that the bombing of
DEDEAUX's car was the result of animosity on the part of
Al, C; ROBINSON and GRADY ALLEN who were being investigated
by the Sheriff's Office for involvement in narcotics.
Informant said it is believed among the criminal element
that OLIUS MC CRORY, JR., a beotlegger and thief and an
associate of ROBENSON actually placed the explosives in
the car,

fhe informant said it is also generally believed
by the criminal element that MC CRORY,may have bombed
HOLLIMAN's plane and represented individuals in the county
who resented having been prosecuted by HOLLIMAN.

On June 5, 1962, Detective H. gd. BADNER, Sheriff's
Office, Gulfport, advised he had taken a statement from
ISENE CRAIN FAVRE, former wife of HORACE CRAIN in which
she alleged that HORACE CRAIN, HAROLD WARE BURT and DAVID
KRAKER bombed DEDEAUX's automobile;; LADNER said these three
individuals ha@ been arrested and questioned concerning
the bembing but no admissions were obtained from them

was reportedly done by GEORGE FUQUA (top hoodlum of the Dallas.
Division) who had a grudge against DEDEAUX for jailing FruquA

_@nd a companion, JAMES DOLAND, along with FUQUA'’s girl friend

FE. GRAFT AND CORRUPTION

On the basis of information furnished by informants
and through information developed by our Agents through other
investigations, it is apparent that law enforcement officials
in the Mississippi Gulf Coast area permit gambling and the
sale of whiskey because they are receiving pay-offs.

On March 24, 1962, NO 1002-C, a tavern operator
and gambler in Pass Christian, Mississippi, said that all
tax paid whiskey in Harrison County and numerous counties
north of the Coast to the Meridian, Mississippi area, is
hehdled through three wholesalers. These are GROVER :
GRAHAM, JR., D. J. VENUS, and JAMES MITCHELL, The informant
said Harrison County: Sheriff, CURTIS 0, DEDEAUX, and Harrison
County Jail Warden, LAWRENCE MENSI, are silent partners with
MITCHELL. Informant gaid the "rake off" to law enforcement
officers on the cases of whiskey sold by thése wholesalers
runs between $7.00 and $8.00 per case when all involved have
taken their cut. The informant said most individuals buy-
ing whiskey from these wholesalers feel that Governor ROSS
BARNETT gets paid off on the basis of $1.00 per case.

JOHN E. MONTGOMERY, Internal Revenue Service
Mississippi advised on Apri 262 2

‘on May 9, 1962, NO 1002-c, a Pass Christian
tavern operator and gambler, again advised that the pay-off
on liquor per case was from $7.00 to $8.00. The informant

9-4 -33341

| NW 68262 Docld:32290110 Page 29



NO 92-390

said this pay-off is collected by the three wholesalers

in Harrison County by adding it to the cost of the liquor.
The informant said the division of the pay-off at the begin-
ning of DEDEAUX's term of office was a five-way split
between DEDEAUX, former Harrison County Sheriff. J. J. WITT-
MAN, former Harrison County Sheriff LAZ QUAVE, present
District Attorney H. EOYCE HOLLEMAN, and Harrison County

Attorney GASTON HUGHES.

On June 28, 1962, this informant said that he
has been connected with illegal activities most of his
adult life and is aware of official sanction of illegal
activity in various parts of the country..He said that

_ Harrison County officials at the present time are the

worst he has ever encountered. He said that with very
few exceptions, the elected officials are tied in with
illegal activity in some manner.

On June 21, 1962, NO 1017-C, 2 former tavern

“ operator and an asseciate of the criminal element on the

Gulf Coast, advised that he had never seen things as bad
as the current situation existing in the Harrison County
Sheriff's Office, and the degree of association of in-
dividuals in that office with local hoodlums. Informant
said Lieutenant ROBERT PARKER and Deputy Sheriff HUGH R.
BROACH, Harrison County Sheriff's Office, are in his
opinion involved in ASA GARRIGA's house of prostitution
at Bob & Joe's Lounge in Biloxi.

Informant said that Sheriff CURTIS DEDEAUX is

an alcoholic and when intoxicated is extremely unreason-
able, having a dual personality.

\ om April 11, 1962, NO 1187-C, a Negro nightclub
owner, advised that DEDEAUK had fired two of his Negro
Deputy Sheriffs, CHARLES HOPPZR and . FESSE WILLIAMS, because

68

they were "cutting into" the pay-off by Negro tavern
operators to the Sheriff by taking pay-offs of their
own. This information was confirmed on April 24, 1962,
* by NO 1131-C, who frequents Negro taverns in the Gulf-
port area, who said he had picked up rumors of the
: reason these deputies were fired through talking to
ae various Negro tavern operators in the area, who were
not in sympathy with the Deputies.

As noted above, the Mississippi National Guard
raided three gambling establishments in Harrison County on
the evening of 6/13/62. On 6/14/62, NO 1178C, a former
barmaid in one of the gambling spots in Gulfport and a
prostitute, advised that she learned that Sheriff DEDEAUX
got very upset because he received no advance warning con-
cerning these raids. The informant said DEDEAUX ordered
all intoxicating beverages on the coast removed from
sight and ordered some of the establishments on the coast
to close temporarily to avoid further raids, According to
the informant, DEDEAUX got "roaring drunk" in his office
on the night of 6/13/62, and on the following morning he
had to be taken to the. hospital because of his intoxicated
condition.

With regard to Sheriff DEDEAUX's alcoholism, on
7/10/62, NO 1190C, a professional bail bondsman having
access to the Harrison County Sheriff's Office, said that
on the night of 7/5/62 DEDEAUX became quite intoxicated
and belligerent. He called in his entire staff and in
abusive language criticized them for what he termed their
disloyalty to him. Two or three deputies resigned during
DEDEAUX's harangue, and one of them had to be physically
restrained from assaulting DEDEAUX. The informant said
that for the past two or three weeks prior to the date
of the interview, DEDEAUX had been constantly in a state
of intoxication and was in and out of his office at all
hours of the day and night frequently issuing countermanding
orders thus creating a state of confusion and indecision on
the part of his entire staff. ‘

As noted in the prostitution section of this
brief, LINDA CORTEZ admitted in an interview that she
had been confined to the Harrison County Jail and was
bonded out of jail by ASA GARRIGA in order to hustle for
him after having had sexual relations with him in an
apartment on the first floor of the jail. In this connection,
Sergeant HUGH BROACH, Jr., Harrison County Deputy Sheriff,
admitted to our agents on 3/6/62 that on three or four
occasions in July, 1961, he had taken GARRIGA upstairs to
see CORTEZ, who was then a prisoner in the jail.

On 9/10/62, Lt. ROBERT PARKER, Harrison County
Sheriff's Office, furnished the following information in

‘confidence to agents: ASA :

ASA GARRIGA has been operating Bob and Joe's
Lounge and the cabins back of this place as a house of
prostitution for over a year with the full knowledge and
consent of Sheriff CURTIS 0. DEDEAUX. The Sheriff allowed
GARRIGA to operate because GARRIGA was paying off DEDEAUX
and Constables PETE PARKER and JERRY TIBLIER. Another

NO 92-390/ev

reason, according to PARKER, that.GARRIGA could operate
without fear of molestation from DEDEAUX, is because
GARRIGA knew that DEDEAUX previously had sexual relations
with GARRIGA's young sister while the latter was a prisoner
in the Harrison County Jail. :

PARKER stated that GARRIGA leased Bob and Joe's
Lounge. to IVAN ORRELS in March, 1962, and later wanted to
get ORRELS out of the place so he could take it over
again. PARKER claimed GARRIGA used his influence over
DEDEAUX to cause DEDEAUX to conduct numerous raids in the
place thereby forcing ORRELS to close it. PARKER said

_ this place is due to reopen with ASA and EDDIE GARRIGA

running it again.

PARKER said that while the GARRIGA brothers
were operating there at Bob and Joe's Lounge they were
paying Constables PARKER and TIBLIER $125.00 to $150.00
a month and allowing them free access to the prostitute
in this place, iJ

PARKER said that. since DEDEAUX has been sheriff
and until about three months ago there had been a monthly
payoff going from the Sheriff's Office to Jackson, Missis-
Sippi, presumably to Governor BARNETT, PARKER said he did
not know the amount. but had heard it. ran in the vicinity
of $40,000.00.a month, and he understood Deputy Sheriff
HUGH BROACH, Jr., would take -the money to Jackson when he
fered prisoners to the State Hospital. at Whitfield near

fackson.

PARKER ‘said that. HUGH BROACH has:a one-half
interest in the Peppermint Lounge.on Pat Harrison Avenue
in Biloxi.

-PARKER stated that.some. of the trusties working
in the Identification Bureau-at.the Sheriff's Office dispose
of records at random and on occasion have sexual. relations
with women prisoners in the jail. He said Sheriff DEDEAUX
is an alcoholic frequently coming to the office at night
drunk and belligerent, firing his: entire staff only ‘to
rehire them the next day.

With regard :to possible payoffs to. Governor

BARNETT, on 9/12/62 "NO 1002C,..a-gambler and tavern operator
in Pass Christian, in. commenting about a payoff of’ $7.00

to $8.00 a case on whiskey. sold in Harrison County, stated

Gulfport Daily Herald newspaper reported that AARON M.
KOHN, Managing Director, Metropolitan Crime Commission of
New Orleans, in a speech on the Gulf Coast, stated that
JAKE and JOHN MLADNICH, operators of the Cabana Beach ©
Motel. and Trader’:John's Sea 'n Sirloin Room in Mississippi
City were closely ‘allied with the MARCELLO interests in
New Orleans. According to the article, KOHN linked a «~
coin-operated novelty company in Biloxi with one in New
Orleans, named: people connected with book layoffs in the
area and called out ‘the names of about a dozen lounges

on the Gulf Coast which he said ‘had connections with ‘New
Orleans racketeers, The story reported that JAKE and JOHN
MLADNICH appeared at this meeting and publicly stated that
they. had no connection with the MARCELLO operation.

‘The 8/23/62 issue .of this newspaper publicized
the fact that Sheriff DEDEAUX. was critical of KOHN in his
remarks. In’ this’ connection, NO:-1190C,' a professional
bail. bondsman who frequents. the Harrison County Sheriff's
Office, said on. 9/13/62 that DEDEAUX had: been highly ..
incensed. over .KOHN's remarks¢. THis informant said he had
heard it ramored before that CARLOS MARCELLO might have'a
connection with the MLADNICH ‘holdings in Mississippi City,
but he had no information that this was so’ and. was. of the
opinion that these rumors.merely developed because the
MLADNICH family have been successful in their business’
interests and are mederately wealthy, > '' ; suliticcad

Our investigation of CARLOS. MARCELLO has not

disclosed that he has any connection with gambling and
other vice on the Mississippi Guif Coast.
