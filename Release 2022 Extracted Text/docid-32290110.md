GAMBLING

I. BOOKMAKING

Investigation of bookmaking in the New Orleans

Area has revealed that up through September 13, 1961,

bookmakers were receiving results of out-of-state races

through Nola Printing Company, the local race wire service,

which discontinued operations

on that date because of the

existence of new Federal legislation pertaining to inter-

State gamoring activities.

Investigation has disclosed that

since september 15, 1951, bookmakers in the New Orleans Area

have not been able

to obtain out-of-state race results on

the same day that races are run.. They have had to rely on

race results obtained through legitimate news media, and

the New Orleans Times Picayune Newspaper has been their prin-

cipal source of this information, in so far as horse races

are concerned.

Investigation has disclosed that

from September

13, 1961, to November 23, 1961, local bookmakers' business

was seriously curtailed; however, the New Orleans Fair Grounds

Race Track began its 1961 winter meet on November 23, 1961.

This meet continued

until March 10, 1962.

During the period

of the Fair Grounds' meet, local bookmakers' business picked

up considerably and again fell off after March 10, 1962.

NOLA PRINTING COMPANY, 530 IRIS AVENUE, JEPTERSON

PARISH, LOUISIANA

Our investigation of Nola Printing Company

during the past five years has disclosed that it was

the race wire service for this section of the United

Nola operated until September 13, 1961,

when it terminated its race wire service on that

date, which was the day President HENNEdY signed

into

law Federal legislation concerning interstate

gambling activities.

PCI'S RAYMOND L. ROLLING and ALBERT L.

PILSBURY, JR., both of whom are cognizant of gambling

activities in

Jefferson Parish, have advised that

Nola had exclusive territorial

rights to furnish

results of horse races to bookmakers in Louisiana,

Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas, East Texas, and

some Eastern States, but not Florida.

ROLLING has

been a bookmaker in Jefferson Parish

for many year's

and subscribed to Nola's service.

On January 13, 1958, Internal Reyenue

Agent NAURBON L. PERRY advised that

JFK Law 11(a)

PORETTO is Manager of Nola Printing Com-

pany :

December 17, 1957, PCI ROLLING advised

that Nola is managed by PORETTO; that it is the

general opinion among bookmakers in Jefferson Parish

that Nola is controlled by CARLOS MARCELLO and that

one of MARCELLO! brothers, JOSEPH, was made a partner

of Nola to oversee the operation and protect CARLOS

MARCELLO's interest.

On July 13, 1961; July 20, 1961, and

September 5, 1961, PCI ROLLING, who then operated

a horse race book

in Jefferson

Parish, advised

that Nola was still furnishing horse race informa-

tion to bookmakers.

• On September 20, 1961, Attorney

HILLARY J. GAUDIN,

New Orleans, advised he

is the

Attorney for Nola.

He identified PORETTO as one

of the partners of Nola and stated that Nola is

in the business of disseminating results of horse

races, but ceased operating as a race wire service

on September 13, 1961.

On February 2, 1962, PORETTO

advised SA REGIS L. KENNEDY that Nola

Printing Com-

pany is not putting out race results for the New

Orleans Fair Grounds Race Track or any other race

track.

He said he would not reactivate Nola as a

race

wire service as long as there is any doubt

about the new Federal legislation pertaining to

interstate gambling.

After Nola ceased its operations, on

September 13, 1961, investigation disclosed that

bookmakers in Jefferson Parish and the New Orleans

Area began to receiveng results of races being run

at the New Orleans Fair Grounds Race Track when

that track opened its winter meet on Thanksgiving

Day, November 23, 1961.

On December 7, 1961, PCI

HOWARD DANIEL BAUTSCH, who operates a horse race

book at Manuel's Restaurant, 952 Jefferson Higaway,

advised that he had been receiving race results

from the lair Grounds since November 23, 1961. He

said he did not know who was operating the service

but ABEL JOHN CHAUVIN had contacted him about buyigg

the service. BAUTSCH said the service consisted of

actual broadcast of the races as they were being

run at the Fair Grounds.

It is to be noted that

the 1961 winter meet of

the Fair Grounds operated

from November 23, 1961, to March 10, 1962. This

track has only one meet a year, which begins each

year on Thanksgiving Day.

CHAUVIN's service ran through December 21,

1961. On December 22, 1961, PCI ROLLING advised

that on the previous day CHAUVIN announced over his

wire service that he had received information that

somebody, without his authority, was "bootlegging"

his service to the Mississippi

Gulf Coast in viola-

tion of the new Federal laws pertaining to inter-

state gambling.

ROLLING said CHAUVIN commented

that if this illicit transmission did not discontinue

Immediately his service would shut down. ROLLING

said that on December 22, 1961, when bookmakers

called CHAUVIN service for Pair Grounds results

of that day they were advised that the service had

been discontinued.

CHAUVIN was interviewed on March 14, 1962,

and he advised that he had operated a race wire ser-

vice from November 23, 1961, to December 21, 1961,

discontinuing it because he received information

NW 68262 Docld:32290110 Page 4

NO 92-390 /tal

that individuals unknown to him and without his

authority were "bootlegging" his service to the

Mississippi Gulf Coast.

CHAUVIN said he operated

this service from 3646 Airline Highway, Jefferson

Parish, utilizing 18 telephones in this place.

(In this connection, investigation of Nola Print

ing Company disclosed

that this was the central

point fron which Nola's race wire service was dissemi-

nated when Nola was in operation. › CHAUVIN said

JOSEPH A. PORETTO and Nola Printing Company had no

connection with his race wire service and that he

was renting the premises at 3646 Airline Highway

frOm JOSEPH PORETTO and JOSEPH MARCELLO, who owned

CHAUVIN claimed that he had only

approximately 17 paying subscribers to his service

and complained that one of his main difficulties

in operating the service was that bookmakers in

Jefferson Parish were stealing it and not paying

for it. He said he determined that some 80 book-

makers were actually receiving the service but only

about 17 were paying him for it.

ANTHONY JOSEPH LUPO was interviewed by

Agents at Nola Printing Company, 530 Iris Avenue,

on June 22, 1962.

LUPO identified himself

as

the publisher of the Dally Sports Bulletin. He

said the Bulletin is still being published and

that is

the only activity taking place at 530 Iris

Avenue.

LUPO said in the old days Nola employed

25 to 30 men but now there were only four or five

men on the payroll and only about 600 copies of

the Dally Sports Bulletin are printed each day.

LUPO said these are sold only in Louisiana and

none

are mailed out of the state, as he does not

desire to become involved li a possible violation

of any of the new Federal legislation pertaining

to interstate gambling activities.

After ABEL JOHN CHAUVIN cut off his

service to local bookmakers on December 22, 1961,

PCI RAYMOND ROLLING said that for a few days

there was no organized service from the Fair Grounds.

On January 5, 1962, ROLLING said that SAM SAIA,

a long-time

bookmaker in the New Orleans area, was

then providing results of Fair Grounds races only

509-1338

NW 68262 Docld:32290110 Page 5

to bookmakers along Jefferson Highway in Jefferson

Parish.

On February 2, 1962, ROLLING said service

from the Fair Grounds had been very poor since CHAUVIN

ceased operating in December and at that time various

bookmakers had devised their own systems of obtaining

race results from the Fair Grounds on an individual

basis:

He said that, to cut down expenses, they

were sharing the results with each other.

The following is a summary of investigations conducted

by the New Orleans Office since Nola Printing Company went out

of business as a race wire service in September, 1961.

These

investigationsdd o not reveal that there is any

race wire ser

vice available to bookmakers in the New Orleans Metropolitan

area which would enable them to pay off winning bettors on

the same day that out-of-state races are run.

Nola Printing Company went out of business in September,

1961, none of the bookmakers in the New Orleans area are

receiving out of state race results on the same day that

stato race

races are being run. All three have pointed out that

because of the fact that no race wire service is available

in the New Orleans area,

they are unable to past post book-

makers in this area.

They advised that one of the essential

elements to a successful past posting operation is that the

victim bookmaker must be handling considerable action and be

busily occupied in his profession.

Since there is no race

wire service in the New Orleans area at this time, the

business of the bookmakers has been seriously affected with

the result that they are unable to past post these books.

In this connection, WARE said he has traveled

throughout Louisiana,

both before and after September, 1961

and has found that the same conditions exist in such areas

as Monroe, Shreveport, Baton Rouge and Lake Charles, Louisiana.

He explained that without a race wire service in the Louisiana

area,

bookmaking business is "dead" and as long as it remains

"dead" he cannot successfully past post bookmakers.

HOWARD DANIEL BAUTSCH, a PCI who is active as a

bookmaker at 952 Jefferson Highway, which is Manuel's Restaurant

and Bax, advised on May 22, 1962 and July 13, 1962 that there

is no service in the New Orleans area providing the identities

and the mutual prices of winners of horse races at out of state

racetracks. BAUTSCH stated that there has been no race wire

service since Nola Printing Company terminated its operations

in September, 1961.

He stated that this has greatly affected

his business and the business of other bookmakers in the New

Orleans Metropolitan area.

BAUTSCH stated that he relies on

the daily racing form and the two New Orleans newspapers for

his out of state race results and pays his customers who

make winning bets on the day following the races, after he

has read the

race results in

these publications.

He stated that

SAT. 12s

NW 68262 Docld:32290110 Page 7

## Page 8

NO 92-390/1am

this same procedure is used by all the other bookmakers in

the area.

He said

that his volume of business prior to

September, 1961 was so large that he is positive that if

race vire service was available in

the New Orleans area, it

would be offered to him; therefore he is positive that no

such service is available.

PCI RAYMOND L. ROLLING, also an active bookmaker

in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana,

advised on April 16 and

September 12, 1962, that there is no race wire service in

the New Orleans area and there has been none since Nola

Printing Company terminated its service in September, 1961.

Recently, information has come to the attention

of this office concerning two sources through which some

bookmakers and betters can obtain the identities of winning

horses at out of state racetracks.

On June 6, 1962, EDWARD WARE, JR., referred to

above, advised that within the past few weeks he had been

able to obtain some of the winning horses at out of state

racetracks between 45 minutes to l2 hours after the races

were run. He said he contacted three different individuals

in the city who occasionally would have the identities of

winning horses only.

These individuals would not have the

identities of place and show horses nor would they have the

paramutual prices on these horses. WARE stated the source

of this information was an employee of the New Orleans Times

Picayune Newspaper who obtained the race information from the

Associated Press Sports Ticker. This employee would then go

out to a barroom located at the corner of st.. Charles and

Poydras Streets which is near the Times Picayune Building

where he would make the information available. WARF said the

information was never available after 4:00 PM each day which

indicated to him that the employee of the newspaper got off from

work at that time.

He said that the racing information

provided through this source was not complete enough or reliable

NW 68262 Docld:32290110 Page 8

---

## Page 9

NO 92-390/1am

enough for bookmakers to pay off bets and could only be

used by some to satisfy their curiosity as to what horses

may have won races at some of the Eastern tracks. WARE

said that on some afternoons the source would only be able

to provide the names of one or two winning horses at only

one track and on other afternoons the source might have the

names of considerably more winners but on no occasion has

this source ever had enough information to enable bookmakers

to use the information in connection with their business.

On September 21, 1962, WARE advised that he had

determined that the employee at the Times Picayune Newspaper

is a person named "TONY" and that TONY is a relative of a

person named "JUNIOR" who he understands is a partner of

NICK NUCCIO, a bookmaker in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana.

Investigation is continuing to determine the

identity of the Times Picayune employee and the identities

of the individuals utilizing the information supplied by

this employee.

With regard to the other source of out of state

race information available to certain bookmakers and betters,

MT. T. CHANDLER JOSEY, Special Agent, Southern Bell Telephone

and Telegraph Company, New Orleans,

advised on September 18,

1962 that he was investigating a matter where an unknown

individual was using pay telephones in the New Orleans area

to make long distance calls to Chicago telephone Number WE-

9-1900.

The individual making these calls to this number is

retrieving the change he uses in making these calls thereby

defrauding the telephone company of the revenue of these

calls. JOSEY advised that he had determined that this Chicago

telephone number dispenses horse race information approximately

30 minutes after races have been run.

He said that this

information is apparently put on a tape recording so that

when any person calls the number they can receive the infor-

mation along with a short commercial announcement advertising

a publication known as "The Green Sheet". Mr. JOSEY stated

NW 68262 Docld:32290110 Page 9

---

## Page 10

NO 92-390/1am

that the identity of winning horses at various racetracks

are given along with the paramutual prices on the winning

horses

He said that this telephone number does not

dispense the identities of second and third place horses

or the paramutual prices on these horses.

In this connection, PCI EDWARD WARE, JE., advised

on September 21, 1962 that he was aware of the Chicago

telephone number and he had called this number for his own

personal use to find out whether a particular horse he may

have bet on had actually won.

WARE said calling parties

cannot determine the identities of second and third place

horses through this number nor can they obtain the mutual

prices

for second and third place horses.

He said the

information which could be obtained by calling this number

was not complete enoughtfor any bookmaker to utilize the

information obtained in connection with his wagering business

as a bookmaker must have complete results, which would include

the three winning horses of each race at each major race-

track in the country.

Investigation is continuing to determine additional

information concerning this telephone number and the use of

this number by betters and bookmakers in the New Orleans area.

With regard to these football parley cards,

he is currently operating a horse race book at the Dixie

Kitchen Lounge.

BABCOCK stated he did not handle football

parley cards during the past football season because he

had bad luck financially with a football parley card of

his own which he tried to promote about two years ago.

BABCOCK said his own parley card was called the Buzzing

Bee card and he almost went broke when he had a large

number of winning players for two successive weekends,

based on poor "line" information he was receiving from

Manuel's Restaurant on Jefferson Highway in Jefferson

Parish.

PCI ANTHONY WILLIAM FREDO who claims he is one

of the best handicappers of the football games in the country

and who claims to have worked for LEO SCHAFFER in Canada,

Chicago, and Terre Haute, Indiana, has advised that anyone

successfully operating football parley cards would have to

receive good handicapping information. FREDO stated that

he knows of no one in Louisiana who is good enough to

handicap college and professional football games and that

the "line" used by successful football parley card operators

would have to come from somewhere out of Louisiana, as he,

FREDO refuses to give his selections to any of the

gamblers

in the New Orleans area. FREDO who is now an insurance

salesman, advised he still handicaps college and profes-

sional football games merely as an avocation but he does

sell this information to Maison Blanche Department Store

in New Orleans who publishes his selections under the

caption, "Mr. VIP" in Maison Blanche ads on the sports

pages of New Orleans newspapers each Friday during the

football season.

C• PROSTITUTION

Sgt. FRED SOULE, Commanding Officer, New Orleans

Police Department, Vice Squad, advised September 21, 1962,

that prostitution activities in the city of New Orleans are

curtailed and closed almost completely.

He advised that NORMA

WALLACE, operator of the largest house of prostitution in the

,south at 1026 Conti Street, was arrested July 2, 1962, and

subsequently sentenced to 90 days in jail.

that this is NORMA WALlACE's first and only conviction although

et and only couvactaon

SOULE advised

she has been operating a house of prostitution in New Orleans

for the past 30 years.

Her house at 1026 Conti Street 1s

closed and up for sale. NORMA WALLACE 1s an Informant of the

New Orleans Office and states that she does not intend to

reopen 1026 Conti Street as a house of prostitution and hopes

to sell it for $75,000.

Another New Orleans madam, SUE

HENDRICKS, was arrested by the District Attorney's Office

according

to SOULE and is now awaiting trial and she has given

up her activities.

SOULE advised that he is currently working

on the prostitution activities of a number of New Orleans cab

drivers who are operating with individual prostitutes.

These

girls are working primarily in the larger hotels and motels

such as the Roosevelt Hotel, Monteleone Hotel and the Fontainebleau

Motor Hotel.. SOULE advised

that the house detectives in these

places are protecting these prostitutes.

SOULE stated that he

has been able with the cooperation of the management at some

of these places to send disguised Vice Officers into the estab

lishment, secure prostitution dates, and has a number of cases

pending against individual prostitutes.

Deputy Sheriff JOSEPH BATTAGLIA, Jefferson Parish

Sheriff's Office, advised on September Y, 1962, that the

Sheriff's Office of Jefferson Parish has

been ttaking a lot

of action in Jefferson Parish against prostitution in Jefferson

Parish, and making numerous arrests, however, this is strictly

"show boating".

He stated that while the prostitutes are

arrested they are usually released immediately and no action

is ever taken by the District Attorney's Office.

Sheriff GILlesPlE advised on October l, 1950, that

one of MARCELLO's daughters had been hired by the Paris

of Jefferson and was employed in the office of PHILLIP SMITH,

then the Parish Attorney.

Information 1s available indicating a close

alignment between CARLOS MARCELLO and Louisiana Governor

JINNIE H. DAVIS.

In this regard, on May 4, 1961, Mr.

CHARLES W. ERDMANN, Civil Defense Director

for the City

of New Orleans, furnished information to this office that

CARLOS MARCELLO endeavored to help him receive from Governor

DAVIS the appointment as New Orleans Civil Defense Director.

Mr. ERDMANN said he wanted it known that he did not solicit

MARCELLO's assistance, nor did he feel that MARCELLO's

actions in any way aided in his receiving this appointment.

He said that on March 14, 1961, at the suggestion of the

then Mayor of New Orleans, DE LESSEPS S. MORRISON, he

went to the office of Mr. CHARLES SPENCER, who was formerly

President of Jefferson Parish.

Mayor MORRISON felt that

ERDMANN should seek Mr. SPENCER's assistance in getting

the appointment of Civil Defense Director.

on his arrival

at Mr. SPENCER's office, ERDMANN found that CARLOS MARCELLO

MARCELLO told ERDMANN that he

was going to Baton Rouge to see Governor DAVIS on the

following morning and

that he wanted to recommend to the

Governor that ERDMANN receive the appointment. • MARCELLO

said he was doing this as a personal favor not only for

ERDMANN but for Mr. SPENCER.

ERDMANN prepared a short

the resume at the Town and Country Motel as MARCELLO had

suggested.

On March 24, 1961, MARCELLO telephoned ERDMANN

and criticized ERDMANN for having had Mayor MORRISON write

a letter recommending ERDMANN's appointment.

MARCELLO

said that Governor DAVIS had not been pleased with receiving

the letter of nomination from the Mayor.

Parish coin machine distributor and a bail bondsman in

Jefferson Parish, advised that there is no doubt in his

mind that Sheriff JOHN G. FITZGERALD has allowed gamblers

to operate in Jefferson Parish. DARGIS said that persons

interested in seeing gambling operate in the parish have

"wined and dined" FITZGERALD ever since he became Sheriff.

DARGIS said he has heard rumors that FITZGERALD has been

provided with women whenever he wanted them, and in this

way, persons interested in seeing gambling continue have

more or less compromised FIIZGERALD to the extend that it

1s difficult for him to turn down their requests or refuse

them whenever they ask for a favor.

On September 12, 1962, PCI RAYMOND L. ROLLING

advised of a conversation he recently had with AL SCHORLING

after SCHORLING had been drinking. Investigation concerning

the Chesterfield Club, a gambling casino in Jefferson

Parish, has disclosed

that SCHORLING is connected with

the operation of that club.

SCHORLING told ROLLING that the

profits of the Chesterfield Club are

split as follows:

AL SCHORLING - 10%; ALBERT J. SALZER - 20%;

FRANK L. TRIDICO - 10%; CARLOS and JOSEPH

MARCELLO - 30%; SALVADOR BOHEMIA - 10%;

Jefferson Parish District Attorney FRANK

LANGRIDGE - 10%; Sheriff JOHN G. FITZGERALD - 10%.

SCHORLING told ROLLING that he was the one who

"took care" of the District Attorney and Sheriff FITZGERALD.

ROLLING advised that he is of the opinion that the reason

CARLOS and JOSEPH MARCELLO receive 30% of the profits of

the. Chesterfield Club 1s because CARLOS MARCELLO 1s the

person responsible for insuring that the Chesterfield Club

can operate unmolested and without harassment by state

authorities.

F. CRAFT AND CORRUPTION

On the basis of information furnished by informants

and through information developed by our Agents through other

investigations, it is apparent that lay enforcement officials

in the Mississippi Gulf Coast area permit gambling and the

sale of whiskey because they are receiving pay-offs.

On March 24, 1962, NO 1002-C, a tavern operator

and gambler in Pass Christian, Mississippi, said that all

tax pald whiskey in Harrison County and numerous counties

north of the Coast to the Meridian, Mississippi area, 1$

hahdled through three wholesalers.

These are GROVER

GRAHAM, JR., D. J. VENUS,

and JANIss MITCheLL.

The informant

said Harrison County Sheriff, CURTIS O. DEDEAUX, and Harrison

County Jail Warden, LAWRENCE MENSI, are Silent partners with

MITCHELL. Informant said the "rake off" to law enforcement

offleers

on the cases of whiskey sold by these wholesalers

runs between $7.00 and $8.00 per case when all involved have

taken their cut.

The informant said most individuals buy-

1ng

whiskey from these wholesalers feel

that Governor ROSS

BARNETT gets paid off on the basis of $1.00 per case.

said this pay off is collected by the three wholesalers

in Harrison County by adding it to the cost of the liquer.

The informant said the division of the pay-off at the begin-

ning of DEDEAUX's term of office was a five-way split

between DEDEAUX, former Harrison County Sberiff J. J. WITT-

man, former Harrison county Sheriff Liz QuAVE, present

District Attorney H. BOYCK HOLLEMAN, and Harrison County

Attorney GASTON HUGHES.

On June 28,

1962, this informant said that he

has been connected with illegal activities most of his

adult life and is aware

of official sanction of illegal

activity in various parts of the country.. He said that

Harrison County officials at the present time are the

worst he has ever encountered.

illegal activity in sone manner.

On June 21, 1962, NO 1017-C, a former tavern

operator and an associate of the criminal element on the

Gulf Coast, advised that he had never seen things as bad

the current situation existing in the Harrison County

Sheriff's Office, and the degree of association of 1n-

dividuals in that office with local hoodluns.

Informant

said Lieutenant BOBERT PARKER and Deputy Sheriff HUGH R.

BROACH, Harrison County Sheriff's Office, are in his

opinion involved in ASA GARRIGA's house of prostitution

at Bob & Joe's Lounge in Biloxl.

Informant said that Sheriff CURTIS DEDEAUX 1s

an alcoholic and when intoxicated is extremely unreason-

able, having a dual personality.

On April 11, 196z, NO 118%-C, & Negro nightclub

As noted above, the Mississippi National Guard

raided three gambling establishments

In Harrison County on

the evening of 6/13/62.

On 6/14/62, NO 11780, a former

barmaid in one of the gambling spots in Gulfport and a

prostitute, advised that she learned that Sheriff DEDEAUX

got very upset because he received no advance warning con-

cerning these raids.

The informant said DEDEAUX ordered

all intoxicating beverages on the coast removed from

sight and ordered some of the establishments on the coast

to close temporarily to avoid further raids. According to

informant, DEDEAUX got "roaring drunk" in his office

on the night of 6/13/62, and on the following morning he

had to be taken to the hospital because of his intoxicated

condition.

With regard to Sheriff DEDEAUX's alcoholism, on

7/10/62, NO 11900, a professional bail bondsman having

access

to the Harrison County Sheriff's Office, said that

on the night of 7/5/62 DEDEAUX became quite Intoxicated

and belligerent. He called in his entire staff and in

abusive language criticized them for what he termed their

disloyalty to him.

Two or three deputles resigned during

DEDEAUX's harangue, and one of them had to be physically

restrained from assaulting DEDEAUX. The Informant said

that for the past two or three weeks prior to the date

of the interview, DEDEAUX had been constantly in a state

of intoxication and was in and out of his office at all

hours of the day and night frequently issuing countermanding

orders

thus creating a state of confusion and indecision on

the part of his entire staff.

As noted in the prostitution section of this

brief, LINDA CORTEZ admitted in an interview that she

had been confined to the Harrison County Jail and was

bonded out of jail by ASA GARRIGA in order to hustle for

him after having had sexual relations with him in an

apartment on the first floor of the jail. In this connection,

sergeant huGh BroACh, Jr., harrison County Deputy Sheriff,

admitted to our agents on 3/6/62 that on three or four

occasions in July, 1961, he had taken CARRIGA upstairs to

see CORTEZ, who was

then a prisoner in the jail.

On 9/10/62, Lt. ROBERT PARKER, Harrison County

Sheriff's Office,

furnished the following Information in

confidence to agents:

ASA

ASA GARRIGA has been operating Bob and Joe's

Lounge and the cabins back of this place as a house of

prostitution for over a year with the full knowledge and

consent of Sheriff CURTIS O. DEDEAUX. The Sheriff allowed

GARRIGA to operate because GARRIGA was paying off DEDEAUX

and Constables PETE PARKER and JERRY TIBLIER.

reason, according to PARKeR, that GARRIGA cOuld operate

without fear of molestation

from DEDEAUX, Is becaUse

GARRIGA knew

that DEDEAUX previously had

sexual relations

with GARRIGA's young sister while the latter was a prisoner

in the Harrison County Jail.

PARKER stated that GARRIGA leased Bob and Joe's

Lounge to IVAN ORRELS in March, 1962, and later wanted to

get ORRELS out of the place so

he could take it over

again.

PARKER claimed GARRIGA used his influence over

DEDEAUX to cause DEDEAUX to conduct numerous raids in the

place thereby forcing ORRELS to close it.

PARKER said

this place is due to reopen with ASA and EDDIE GARRIGA

running it again.

PARKER said that while the GARRIGA brothers

were operating there at Bob and Joe's Lounge they were

in this place.

PARKER said that since DEDEAUX has been sheriff

and until about three months ago there had been a monthly

payoff going from the Sheriff's Office to Jackson, Miss1s-

sippi, presumably to Governor BARNETT. PARKER said he did

not know the amount but had heard it ran in the vicinity

of $40,000.00 a month,

and he understood Deputy Sheriff

HUGH BROACH, Jr., would take the money to Jackson when he

delivered prisoners to the State Hospital at Whitfield near

Jackson.

PARKER said that HUGH BROACH has a one-half

interest in the Peppermint Lounge on Pat Harrison Avenue

in Biloxi.

PARKER stated that some of the trusties working

in the Identification Bureau at the Sheriff's Office dispose

of records at random and on occasion have sexual relations

with women prisoners in the jail.

He said Sheriff DEDEAUX

1s an alcoholic frequently coming to the office at night

drunk and belligerent, firing his entire staff only to

rehire them the next day.

With regard to possible payoffs to Governor

BARNETT, on 9/12/62 NO 1002C, a gambler and tavern operator

in Pass Christian, in commenting about a payoff of $7.00

to $8.00 a case on whiskey sold in Harrison County, stated

that as far as he had been able to learn Governor BARNETT

1s still getting between $20,000.00 to $30,000.00 per month

from whiskey sales on the Gulf Coast. Informant was unable

to advise: the method of payment or who was involved directly

in making the payment.

Gulfport Daily Herald newspaper reported that AARON M.

KOHN, Managing Director, Metropolitan Crime Commission of

New Orleans, in a speech on the Gulf Coast, stated that

JAKE and JOHN MLADNICH, operators of the Cabana Beach

Motel and Trader John's Sea 'n Sirloin Room In Mississippi

City were closely allied with the MARCELLO Interests in

New Orleans•

According to the article, KOHN linked a

coin-operated novelty company in Biloxi with one in New

Orleans, named people connected with book layoffs in the

area and called out the names of about a dozen lounges

on the Gulf Coast which he said had connections with New

Orleans racketeers;

The story reported that JAKE and JOHN

MLADNICH appeared at this meeting and publlely stated that

they. had no connection with the MARCELLO operation.

The 8/23/62 1ssue of this newspaper publicized

the fact that Sheriff DEDEAUX was critical of KOHN in his

remarks:

In this connection, NO 1190C, a professional

bail bondsman who frequents the Harrison County Sheriff's

Office, said on 9/13/02 that DeduAux nad been nighty

incensed over KOHN's remarks. THis informant said he had

heard it rumored before that CARLOS MARCELLO might have a

connection with the MLADNICH holdings in Mississippi city,

but he had no information that this was so and was of the

opinion that these rumors merely developed because the

MLADNICH family have been successful in their business

interests and are moderately wealthy:

Our investigation of CARLOS: MARCELLO has not

disclosed that he has any connection with gambling and

other vice on the Mississippi Gulf Coast.
