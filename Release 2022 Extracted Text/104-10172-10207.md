or ask the question ina furtive esuuer. iovever, the rooa was fairly
noisy, sad LORANOV™ would have probutly realised that tre conversation could
not be overheard. It is sosewhst strane ne referred to A:LAJLE by "GOLUBTSIN®

ebvious lie. We can only guoes at t-is stage of the contact that | LOBANOV
ao Gizply interested in finding out what happened $o AZLADLE. [t would
sem logical that LOBANOV nad known previously thst CQTILLS has had eome
