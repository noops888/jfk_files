UsrnazdezYeame in to ace me today and fools that he would 1tke to
atime oa in tho mochsnical drafting a3 well aa in. the baoic prolini~
wary wir which he has beea.taking in draving. There are aoze things
Which I vould liko to pags along to you of witich you may not be avore.

Bp uat41 a yoar 20st. Hernanded was. a savero optleptic ond had sany
cclzerese At that tie, ho had a cranval ozeration which hea helped hia
consizercbly. Moro recently in tho last afcht contha, he atates that he:

kanova $¢ end you aro avaro of it, thore 4s no reuson to bo dicturbed by ite
Mofo sericus 10 probably the fact that he 1o under modicaticn — barbitue
Féten ‘of one kind or another — under preecrigtion of a doctor to prevent
bie feo iuvins actoures, and thio tends to make hin oporata clowly andy
of course, to bo drowcy. Novover, he states that he has novor fallon |

esleep in tho class.

Previozs to 49, he had takon one yoar of electrical ongincoring in
Favora. - ito io vory cericue about leurning mach‘ne design and 1s intcrcoted
thts arca. Ilo atatea that ho has never copicd a otnglo draving and haa
done everything on his T aloo questioned hin ax to whcthor ho untore
etecd yoor icctures and what you put on the blacxtoard, an' he ctetcs that
ho. écea tut thet ho works slowly. I thought that if ho cold ap.ly coro
+ tine, that ho probably would bo able to keop up casier boinz ono who worka
elosly and drafting boing a course based primarily on the asount of tise
Qpgilec. No caid that he thought that he could coae in about 15 minutos
early acd do a littlo work bofore the clasa started, but that he eculd not
wors at howe for lack ef instruments and that the room was éloacd to hia

except for thig 15 minute period.
