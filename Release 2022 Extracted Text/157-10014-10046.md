Mr. Baron. Finally, are you aware that all your Constitu-
tional rights are intact before the Committee here today,
sincluding your Fifth Amendment rights to remain silent?

Mr. Halley. Yes, I am.

I are contemplating having a Senator swear you in and ask you if
|) Your transcript is true to the best of your knowledge at some
Point as soon as Possible as it can be arranged after today's

session.

Mr. Halley. Yes. The statement that you have just made

is my understanding of the agreement that we entered into prior
to this conversation going on the record.

Mr. Baron. Thank you.

Let us‘bagin then with ‘some very‘ broad questions: * :-
about your background in the Agency. Can you tell me what you
were doing in the Agency prior to your involvement with the
IMWAVE station?

Mr. Halley. I became involved with the Cuban affair in
approximately February of 1962. At that time, I was in Head-

quarters. TI was Chief of Forsiqn Intelligence Activities for thk

Eastern European Division. I was asked to be released from thosk

duties to conduct a survey of the opportunities for running
intelligence operations against Cuba. I was released from those
‘duties; I did engage in a survey of the possibilities for runninal
intelligence, counterintelligence, paramilitary operations
against Cuba.

Mr. Baron. Your position as Chief of Foreign Intelligence
for Eastern Europe did not involve Cuba in any way? That was

your last position before you became involved in Cuban affairs,

Soviet operations and East German operations.

is that correct?

Mr. Halley. That is correct.

I want to qualify that. Undoubtedly, there wera some
actions that were being conducted in the Eastern European area
that reflected on Cuba, but I was not involved in the Bay of Pig¢
Operation. I was not fully focused on Cuban operations until
approximately February of 1962.

Mr. Baron. At what point did you join the Agency?

Mr. Halley. I joined the Agency originally in 1951.

Mr. Baron. In a very general way, can you describe the

nature of your activities at the Agency prior to February of seat

Mr. Halley. When I was first assigned to the Agency, I was
an Army officer on active duty. I went through the usual Agency
training program. I was assigned to Eastern European activities
where I originally was focused on Polish and German operations

I subsequently served from 1952 to 1959 in Germany.:.In the
course of that. service, I spent most of my time working on the
Eastern European satellites, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary,

Romania, Bulgaria. In addition, I was involved on occasion in

Mr. Baron. Did you have any involvement in Latin American
affairs prior to February of '62?

Mr. Halley. Yes. In the period 1960-62, I.was ‘responsible!
for setting up operational activity in Latin America that

was targetted more explicitly on the Fastern European satellites

This was in a period of tim

where the Eastern European satellites were expanding thétr

Presence in Latin America. In my duties in the Eastern European

Division, IT was responsible for gettina this program coing in

Latin America, so I did have an extensive exposure to Latin

America: in the period '60 to ieee as I recall those dates.

The accuracy of those dates can he chacked from ny official

travel records, and so on.

Mr. Baron. During that period of time you were actually

in Latin America helping to set up this progran?
Mr. Halley. No, I was stationed in Washington, but 1

fravelled to Latin America during this particular period of

time.

Mr. Baron. Did you travel to Cuba at any point during the

course of that operation?

Mr. Halley. Not specifically. I think 1 transitted Cuba
on air stops being routed to various countries. 1 think I was
at one or two Cuban airfields, but simply in transit.

Mr. Baron. Not long enough even to talk to the people at

Mr. Halley. No, I had no contact at any time with the
Havana Station.

Mr. Baron. Did you pick up. during this period of time,

toward the Castro government? Could you characterize that

T

attitude, if you did?

Mr. Halley. I certainly was aware, I think, of the broad
political trend in the Hemisphere at that time, my interest was
much More narrowly focused at that time on the Eastern European

targets, and on the Soviet target, and I was not certainly

specializing in Cuban affairs at that juncture.

Mr. Baron. Cuba was not viewed at that juncture as part of
the Soviet target, as a Soviet satellite?

Mr. Halley. No, it was not.

Mr. Baron. Coming then to February of '62, is that the
point at which you joined the JMWAVE Station in Miami?

Mr. Halley. No. When I first entered into this survey,
it was to do this on a TDY basis, temporary duty assignment,
to complete a report on my findings, to report those at that
particular juncture to Mr. Harvey who was the head of the Task
Force that was attempting to expand intelligence coverage of
Cuba and I was not assigned to the station at that particular
point in time.

Mr. Baron. At what point did you join the JMWAVE Station?

Mr. Halley. Shortly after having completes this survey.
These dates are blurred now because the survey soon turned into

from my service records, but after having completed the survey

Mr. Baron. Would you assume that that was sometime before
the end of May of '62?

Mr. Halley. Yes. It was Probably before that, but as I
Say, there are a couple of weeks gap that we would have to look

Ge
at my service record to get the exact dates, but certainly it
could have been March, it could have been April? But I Yeserve,
you know, the right to check my record if that is a critical
point in terms of what you are trying to establish.

Mr. Baron. Certainly.

I should say generally at this point, if anything we cover
today gives you that kind of problem it would be immensely
helpful to us if you would check your answers against. documents
that might be available in the CIA.

Mr. Halley. Yes, all right.

Mr. Baron. In fact, let me ask you if you would check thay
one out, because it would be useful to know exactly when you
Joined the JMWAVE station.

During the period of time before you joined IMWAVE, while
you were conducting the survey, did you report to anyone other
than William Harvey?

behalf of the task force commander, who was Mr. Harvey. While
Iwas in Miami conducting the survey, I obviously discussed

matters pertaining to that survey to the team who was then in
charge of the operational activity in Miami. That team was

essentially headed by Mr. Al Cox,.who has since died.

Mr. Baron. Was that team the equivalent of JMWAVE station?

Mr. Halley. Yes. Mr. Cox was the head, then, of what woul
be the equivalent of the JMWAVE Station.

Mr. Baron. Was he the head of JMWAVE until the pint when

you replaced him, or until the point you became Chief of the
JMWAVE Station?

Mr. Halley. That is correct. . He was the head of that
unit until such time as I Teplaced him.

Mr. Baron. Were you aware during this survey that you

were conducting of any link between Task Force W and the so-callba
Special Group in the White House which was part of the National
Security Council structure and used the project namec! MONGOOSE
for anti-Cuban operations?

Mr. Halley. My understanding at the time that I conducted

this survey was that there was a three-man group in existence

which was headed by Mr. Robert Kennedy that was conducting a

Cuba. The other members of that particular group were General

Lansdale and Mr. Helms.
This three-man group had subordinate to it for all practicafl
purposes the task force unit which was managed by Mr. Harvey.

know the exact words you used. I am not familiar with that
terminology.

Mr Baron. During the whole period of your involvement
with JMWAVE, you were not made aware of Project MONGOOSE as
such?

Mr. Halley. I am not aware of Project MONGOOSE. 1 do not
recall it as an acronym, cryptonym or anything alse that was in
common usage in my conversations.

Also, you have to understand that during that particular
time, Mr. Harvey was subordinate to the normal Agency chain of
command. In other words, he had parallel lines, if you will.
There was this three-man Task Force to whom he was reporting
regularly. At the same time, as the Task Force Commander, he
was reporting to the then-DDP who was Mr. Helms.

Me Baron. You began your survey just about the time that
Mr. Helms replaced Mr. Bissell as pop?

Mr. Halley. That is right.

Mr. Baron. Were you aware of the command relationship

Harvey as head of Task Force W? Did that group task Harvey
directly, or did Harvey's assignments have to come through Helms
and through the DCI as opposed to this group that did not includ
the DCI?

really talking about parallel lines.

In other words, this
three-man group was meeting. Mr. Helms was both a member of

that particular group and the DDP. Therefore, when he came back

from one of these meetings and issued instructions to Mr. Harvey
it was, you know, tantamount to these things coming through two

channels simultaneously, one coming from this three-man task

force and the other instruction simultaneously coming from Mr.
Helms who was the DDP.

Mr. Baron. As far as Mr. Iarvey was concerned, an assign-

ment or order from Richard Helms .was an order to be taken’ at

face value? Harvey did not have to question whether it had the

stamp of approval from the DCI or not? Would that have been
your operating understanding?

Mr. Halley. That would have been my understanding, yes.
Certainly an instruction received from Mr. Helms was a valid
Agency instruction.

Mr. Baron. The DCI at this point was John McCone.

Mr. Halley. That is correct. :

Mr. Baron. Do you have any knowledge of the relationship

Mr. Malley. Not on a day to day basis. Once I went to
Miami, I came back on a regular basis to review operational
plans and programs. On one occasion I accompanied Mr. NcCone
to the White House to give a presentation or sit in while the

presentation was being made.

Mr. Baron. Where was this? What was the forum in which
the presentation was made.

Mr. Halley. This was a meeting with President Kennedy and
other members of ‘the then-Cabinet were present at that particular
Meeting.

Mr. Baron. Was that a Cabinet meeting or.was it a Special
Group meeting as a sub-unit of tha National Security Council?

Mr. Halley. You know, that happened in 1962. This is
1975. I do not recall then with precision as to whether it was
a meeting of the Cabinet or whether it was a meating of the
National Security Council, or whather it was a meeting of the
Spacial Group.

Mr. Baron. That: is perfectly understandable. Do you cer
which Cabinet members were present at that meeting?

Mr. Halley. .Yes.. My recollection of that was that Mr.
McNamara was present, Mr. Rusk Was present, Mr. Kennedy, the
Attorney General, was present. You know, I am just vague now
at this particular point. Those are the ones that stick out in
my memory as being present.

Mr. Baron. Was the DCI present?

Mr. Halley. Yes, the DCI was present, and he gave a
Portion of the presentation. As I recall, Mr. FitzGerald gave
the other portion of the presentation.

Mr. Halley. Yes, I am aware of the term Special Group.

T am aware that the chronology of the 303 Committee, Special

earlier, that particular time, I cannot distinguish between
whether this was an ad hoc meeting or this was a Special Group
Meeting, or what it was.

Mr. Baron. Did you assume at that time that the three-man
group that you referred to, including- the Attorney ‘General,
General Lansdale and Richard Helms, had a formal relationship
to this larger Special Group? In other words, was that three-

man group a kind of decision-making sub-unit of the Special

“Group, or do you think it operated entirely independent from

the National Security Council structure.

Mr. Malley. I do not think I ean give you an authoritative
answer to that. I would go back to what I Previously told
you. When I entered into this project in February of '62, the

chain of command that I was familiar with was this three-man

group in constant contact with Mr. Harvey. The second chain
of command, paralleling that, was Mr. Harvey Teporting to the
DDP and the DDP subsequently reporting through his chain of
command to the Director, and that would be the only way that

I could characterize that with any accuracy,

Mr. Baron. Did those two chains of command continue. .
as the channels of decision-making and tasking when you were --
or during your tenure as Chief of Station.at *IMWAVE? "*

Mr. Halley. That relationship changed, and again I do
not have the date at my fingertips at what time that changed.

I know that shortly thereafter I was in Miami, General
Lansdale came down to visit me, to talk with me, about the
Progress that was being made in the operational program. At
some point after that, this three-man group for all intents
and purposes disappeared, General Lansdale was reassigned;
the group broke up; subsequent reviews of the program were made
at the Special Group level. as an example, we would have to
submit every month the number of operations that we were going

to run, such as infiltrations into Cuba through what would be

“paramilitary means, and these were approved hy the Special

Group. There was an approval procedure for setting those up,
SO Subsequently the three-man group disappeared and the regular
mechanism of the Special Group came into play.

I am sorry, I cannot give you a precise date for that

Change, but I am sure it is in the record and I am sure you even

have the date because the Agency has been Yesearching all sorts
of material for you. I feel that you would just have to get
those dates for the Yecord,

Mr. Baron. We can do that.

Would you say that every major operation that you undertook
at JMWAVE would have been approved by the Special Group or at
least they would have been put on notice of the nature of any
major operation that you were planning?

Mr. Halley. Why do you hot define for me what you consider|
to be a major operation so we do not get into, you know, a
Problem? T£‘you feek-that you ee alee a

Mr. Baron. Perhaps we can turn it around and say, could
you characterize the kinds of operations generally that you
would refer to this three-man group initially, Pg the Special
Group later, for their approval, or at least to put them on
notice,.. the kinds that you might not refer and instead proceed
unilaterally?

Mr. Halley. Initially, the three~man group was seized

with the problem of conducting the survey of what could be

upon, my understanding of this, as I told you, thr three-man
group was disbanded or atrophied or went on to other things
and then the formal mechanism came in for approval, that is,

the Special Group. as Procedures. became more formalized, we

had to submit a monthly schedule of the kind of Operations that

would be conducted against Cuba in the Paramilitary Fields.

In other words, if wa were going to run an operation that.
was going to be a cache replacement in the Cuban mai land, that
had to be put in, say in our October schedule, that dctober
Schedule had to be submitted to the Washington Headquarters so
they could make it available to the Special: Group sometima in
September. so 1 would regard a cache, say the lowes: kind of

Operation in terms of sensitivity, and then you could’ move up

from team infiltrations that had to be approved in advance,
Fesupply missions, Paramiltary operations against fixed instal-
lations would all be approved.

Mr. Baron. If there had been any operation with}the
assassination of Fidel Castro, or other high Cuban government
leaders as its objective, would such an operation havi been
referred to either the three-man group or later the Special
Group.

Mr. Halley. I£ such an operation had been proposed. from

Miami, it would have had to have gone through that particular
Process,

Mr. Baron. Your answer seems to indicate that only
Operations that originated at the JMWAVE Station would be
referred up for approval. Is that correct?

Mr. Halley. That is the kind of aetivity that I have

Mr. Baron. We will go over some statements, but in trying
to recover this ground one more time, I think it is important
to distinguish an attempt to pin the responsibility on you,
which I am not trying to do by my questioning ~-

Mr. Halley. That is a complicated question.

Mr. Baron. The attempt to simply -- undoubtedly, the
attempt to simply bring out your knowledge and any awareness
that you may have had of any kind of operation that had assassina

Mr. Halley. Right, and I will stand by my answer; that is,
T put forth no plans, I know of no plans put forth, you know,
during my tenure in Miami in which assassination was part of
the operational rationale. You know, the only way we can clarif
this perhaps to your satisfaction is to discuss some specifics,
Tf you are prepared to talk about specifics, maybe I can deal
with those within the framework of that general statement that
T made, you know. I know how Cubans talk. I know the rumors
that have existed over the years, I simply do not want to be
identified with any action conducted by some group over which
T had no knowledge or control. that is my key point.

Mr. Baron. I think that answers it for now, and we will
cover some specifics later.

One more question on this dual chain of command: on the
one hand, the Agency chain of command from the DDP to Harvey
fo you at JMWAVE, and on the other hand, the three-man decision
making group consisting of the Attorney General, Lansdale and
Helms. Would you say in the early days that this three-man

group appeared to you to be in control of the decision making

“before the Special Group stepped in, that decisions were made ©

in a less formal way than they were later under the Special
Group?

Mr. Halley. I really could not address myself to that.
In other words, I never sat in on a Meeting of the three-man

group. In other words --

Mr. Baron, What about the kind of Yeporting that was

required of you by the three-man group as opposed to the Special

Group?

Mr. Halley. My requitements for reporting really stemmed
in the early days from Narvey. If there were any special

requirements, he was taking “them* from -the -three-man group and

translating them and, in fact, much of the system of reporting
in those early days was generated by me sand’ what%I' thought.
was .required to keep Mr. Harvey as a Task Force Commander
fully informed. I think that you undoubtedly know from the

record that I worked for Mr. Harvey prior to 1962 and therefore

Iwas familiar, you know, with his style of operation and thought
Thad a clear understanding of what he needed in an informationah
Sense. So when I went to Miami, T organized much of the
Feporting flow upward, if you will, from the field unit to
Headquarters.

Mr. Baron. tlad you worked for Mr. Harvey in Germany?

Mr. Halley. Yes, I had.

Mr. Baron. In Berlin?

Mr. Walley. Yes, sir.

Mr. Baron. This was on the famous and successful tunnel
Operation?

Mr. Halley. No, I do not deserve any credit for the tunnel
operation. That is Mr. Harvey's activity. He kept that very

tightly compartmented and in the days when that was going on, 1

funnel for both of these chains of command; as far as you were
concerned, you received directives from him, whatever the source
may have been originally, is that correct?

the control of money and so forth was vested in the Task Force
Commander, Mr. Harvey,

Therefore, I never dealt with this three-man group as a
body. I dealt with the individuals, you know, and various

mutations.

Mr. Baron. Would you say that the three-man group had a

less formal, more free-wheeling style of dacision making, “J ° |.
there was a real change in the rigor with which you were requires

Mr. Halley. I would have to say that the total reporting

Cannot ascribe this to the difference of style of the three-man
SFOUP aS opposed to the Agency chain of command or subsequent
with the requirements of the special Group. This evolved from

and I felt that that was a perfectly legitimate function of
that body.

Mr. Baron. Who. briefed you on the existence of the body?

Mr. Halley. My recollection of the initial briefing was
from Mr. Harvey.

Mr. Baron. Do you recall how he described that three-man
Group and the responsibilities?

Mr. Halley. No. This was 1962, and this is 1975. As
you know from my records, these intervening years have been
very active for me, therefore, I do not remember with precision
that conversation in all of its details. I do recall my first
briefing on the existence of this three-man group being from
Harvey.

Mr. Baron. You mentioned that General Lansdale might
occasionally meet with you personally. This is in Miami, at
IMWAVE Station?

Mr. Halley. I can only recall at this Point one specific
meeting where he came down to Florida in Miami to visit.

Mr. Baron. What was the substance of that meeting?

Mr. Halley. He was given some briefings by my state on
their areas of Specialization, whether it was foreign intelli-
gence collection, whether it was maritime activities, or whether
it was paramilitary activities. 1 spent a lot of time with him.

Mr. Barony. What period of tima would you place this in?
Mr. Halley. Probably sometinie in_the summer of "62,
because my family was already in Miami at that point, and when

weapons has a different view on what is the ideal weapon. If

Therefore, when we were Standardizing weapons to our

in terms of, you know, muzzle velocity, rateiof: fire, .weight ~

Therefore the term assassination was just a part of the 1ife,

implanting your starget and the guard stumbles on you, you know,
the guard force then becomes an immediate! risk to your operation
and usually there is a fire fight. Therefore, this becomes a
question of weapons. In othar words, what weapon is going to

appreciated.

Mr. Halley. I think what I would like to do is to try to
put this into some perspective.

The perspective really starts with the failure of the Bay
of Pigs Operation. After the failure of the Bay of Pigs, the
Kennedy -Administration wanted another look taken at the problem
of Cuba. In order to get that other look started, the Kennedy
Administration created this threa-man task force or this three-
man group and wanted to see what else could be done against
Cuba, and that is when I came into this problem in February of
"62.

Mr. Baron. Is it possible that the three-man group that
you are referring to is actually the Robert Kennedy-Maxwell
Taylor Board of Inquiry into the reasons for the failure of the
Bay of Pigs operation?

Mr. Halley. This three-man group stemmed out of that
inquiry. What its relationship was to the inquiry, I do not kno
because I was not involved and I never had an opportunity once

I plunged into this job, to go back and read those historical

and so forth, but I have never read it.

All right.

Therefore, my first task wherl I became involved in this
was the task of coming up with an operational plan to see what

kinds of intelligence could be collected in Cuba, so that by

collecting this intelligence, an assessment could be made based
on hard facts as to what could be done against Castro. In other
words; the difference here was that people thought that the Bay
of Pigs operation was not soundly grounded in intelligence.
Therefore, this was an attempt to start the collection of
intelligence to see what could be done. °

In order to collect intelligence at that particular time,
it was believed that all avenues of approach should be used,
so that meant classical foreign intelligence operations,
counterintelligence operations, the debriefing of refugees, and
the use of paramilitary means to put teams into Cuba to collect
intelligence on that part of the island that could not be
covered by what you would call the More classical means of

foreign intelligence collection.

As the program was started essentially by me or accelerated
by me, we in fact got caught up with the Cuban Missile Crisis --4
that is, the advent of the Soviet intervention into Cuba -- and
our whole effort shifted to covering that Soviet build-up in
Cuba, and this was an integral part to our having datected the
“Soviet build-up and the United States government taking the
actions which they did, that is, to verify this.

There was a great problem for a while when we were all
talking about hard intelligence, the ‘President, John Kennedy,
was telling us, give us hard intelligence. We thouqht we were

Mr. Walley. In addition, we were continuing to support
certain elements of resistance, you know, that were still there
that were not in the Army.

Mr. Baron. What kinds of elements ware those?

Mr. Halley. These were paramilitary forces that were in
Cuba, that we had put in or established contact with, or people
who were already in the bush who we had already established
contact with or they had established contact with us, and we

trouble --

Mr. Baron.

Could you explain what different categories of

companies you were receiving help from at that point, and about

how many of each there might have been?

Mr. Halley. I do not think I could'do that. We are

talking about hundreds of companies that we used during that

Period of time. Some of them might simply have been a company

set up and registered and run out of some attorney's

office. It simply provided back stopping for the ownership of

I had access to the files to answer your question, it would

Mr. Baron. “Did you also have extensive cooperation from

civic officials and law enforcement agencies in being allowed

Mr. IHalley. You have asked me, in essence, three
questions.

Mr. Baron. Right-

Mr. Halley. Let me try to divide that and deal with each
question separately.

Let me first, deal with the vessels. Every vessel that we
had was appropriately registered. There were no short-cuts:
insofar as the U.S. Coast Guard was concerned. That is, any
vessel that was registered in the United States met appropriate
safety standards and so forth, so we were not putting any
vessels into the water that any citizen could not have put into
the water. That is we are talking about ten, fifteen, twenty

foot boats, thirty foot boats, thirty-five foot boats, things

like that. These hoats were owned in‘either a-corporate. name

or by a private individual who had to register them with the

Coast Guard and pass normal Coast Guard requlations.

Mr. Baron. You did have general arrangements or agreements
with law enforcement agencies throughout Florida for the
treatment of CIA operatives who were affiliated with the JMWAVE
Station?

Mr. Halley. We did have, through our Office of Security,
@ continuing dialogue with a number of law enforcement agencies
in Florida. If a problem developed, wa would then contact them
and look at the issue within the context of what had transpired.
Certainly there was no immunity. tn other words, this has to be
looked at on a case by case basis,

For instance, you know, we had a training site in north

was drunk and disorderly in town and could not speak English,

Mr. Baron,

Back to the structure of the relationships

between yourself as Chief of Station at JMWAVE and any operative:

it be fair to say that any activities run out of the Station

know this Station went through several mutations in organization

during its existence. I guess the organizational structure that

existed for the longest period of time was somathing like I am
going to describe to you.

There was a Chief of Station, which was myself. I had a

Deputy Chief of Station for operations. That is the gentleman

who is now retired, I think he is still alive, by the name of

Moore, Robert Moore. I had a second Deputy Chief of Station and

he was for Support Patterns. That is a gentleman who is also

Tetired, a Mr. Corris.

Then the rest of the Station was organized into a number of

branches. Each branch was organized along functional lines.

Let me give you an example. There was a Foreign Intelligence
These were people in, what in my terminology would be

classical foreign intelligence operations. That is, trying to

recruit a Cuban diplomat abroad, as an example, dealing with,

communicate with us, through which they could communicate to us.

Then there was the Paramilitary Branch. This was the
group that ran the commando operations. This was the group that
ran, and put péople back into Cuba, into resistance groups, or
established contact with resistance groups. This was a group
that also worked in putting in caches that would supply people,
either paramilitary forcas in Cuba or agents that were being
run by the Foreign Intelligence Group.

All right. Then there was a Covert Action, people who
dealt with exiled refugee groups that were involved in radio
activities, publications, that kind of thing. ‘Then there is a
whole panoply of -- then there was Maritime, in terms of
finance, and so on. Security was a branch. Obviously, under
that kind of system, no executive, whether he is president of

operational reviews were conducted.

misimpression that tha only People involved in CIA operations
were People who were paid by the Agency. Isn't it also true
that there were many members of Cuban exile groups in Florida
who participated voluntarily from time to time in CIA sponsored

operations?

during this period of time there were a lot of independent

“Cuban groups who claimed that they had sponsorship from the

to, I think they are called L pills, or something, as they
were referred to in those days.

Mr. Baron. Why were they called L pills?

Mr. Hallev. Everything has a number or nomenclature, I
do not know.

Mr. Baron. Did you ever hear of poison pills to be used
in assassination operations against Fidel Castro or other
Cuban leaders?

Mr. Halley. No.

Is that referencing to this material that I might have
provided for Narvey? Because if that is the case, I can dispel
“that quickly, because I would not have had access to them.
Mr. Baron. You would not have access to poison pills?
Mr. Halley. No, I would not have access to them.

Mr. Baron. Why not?

Mr. Halley. I did not have them in my inventory. That is

Mr. Baron. They would have had to come directly from

Mr. Halley. That is what I'm trying to clarify what it is
that you are trying to establish from me.

In other words, if you are Saying --

Mr. Baron. Let us move further, I think we can be more
specific now.

We have a document that. I am about to show you. I just
wanted to clear up. the background of it before we discussed
the document.

Mr. Halley. Let me just make this point. If you are
talking about drug pills, I had no source of such things, so
if that is the nature of your question, I can say I had nothing

to do with that. If you are talking about, you know —-

Mr. Baron. Arms and equipment --
Mr. Nalley. -- weapons or something, yes, that was in my

inventory. I could have issued that to Harvey, you know, guns,

ammunition, plastics, that kind of thing I could have had

‘access to, yes. That is why I am trying to sort out really

where the thrust of your questioning is.

Mr. Baron. There were two prongs: to the question, you
have picked both of them up. One is whether you had ever heard
of poison pills in connection with an assassination operation

against Fidel Castro, and your testimony would be that you had

not, is that correct?

Mr. Halley. That is rights I would not have had access
to those pills myself, nor did the Station. In other words, if
I had wanted something like that, I would have had to corres-
ponded with Washington in order to have had access to it, if
in fact it existed. coe

Mr. Baron. You never had any such correspondence?

Mr. Halley. I never had any correspondence that I can
recall.

Mr. Baron. The other problem was the supply of arms and
equipment to which you already replied.

Have you ever read that Inspector General's Report of
1967, prepared at the request of the PCI to fill him in on any

assassination efforts to which the CIA may have been connected?

Mr. Halley. No, I have not read the report.

Mr. Baron. Before you came here today you were not shown
any excerpts from this report to refresh your recollection at
the CIA?

Mr. Halley. The IG Report?

Mr. Baron. Yes.

Mr. Malley. No, I havs not.

Mr. Baron. Were you shown any other documents at the CIA

Mr. Halley. I talked to Walt Elder on the phone. You know
the people who are involved in this thing. I have asked for
that, I talked to our attorney, Clarke --

Mr. Baron. George Clarke?

Mr. Halley. Yes.

-- I talked to a number of people, I asked to see the
newspaper clipping from the Miami IMerald on the McGovern
activity. Yes, I have looked at that kind of thing. But I
have not looked at the specific IG Report. I have not read it,
I have not seen an extract of the IG Report.

Mr. Baron. Were you given any specific instructions as to
the kinds of things that, you could say or not say here today?

Mr. Halley. _ You know, nothing beyond what you and I
touched on which you have already put on the record.

Mr. Baron. Which is not to mention the names of CIA
officers who are still operating under cover?

Mr. Halley. Right, or agents who would still be viable

the portions that I will bracket which deal with a report of
a meeting between yourseif and William tlarvey involving the
supply of arms and equipment.

(Pause) ’

Mr. Halley. I have no reason to doubt this. I may have
provided this support. I do not recall sitting in a parking lot
observing --

Mr, Baron. For the record, wa are discussing the passage
that begins, "When the pills were given to Varona through
Roselli, Varona requested arms and equipment needed for the
support of his end of the operation. Roselli passed the request
to Harvey. Harvey, with the help of (Mr. Halley], the chief
of the JMWAVE Station, procured" .---

Continuing.--And then it continues to say a large shopping
list of arms and equipment, which cost about $5,000 and were
supplied in a parking lot of a drive-in restaurant in a rented
U-Haul truck.

Would the cost of $5,000 have been an unusual expenditure
at that time at JMWAVE Station for arms and equipment?

Mr. Halley. No, $5,990 would not have been an unusual
expenditure.

Mr. Baron. Not unusual enough, in fact, for you to have
a particular memory of the event?

Mr. Halley. No.

Now that I read over this thing, I do recall, as I told
you earlier before you showed ma this document something about
a rented truck and being involved with Harvey in providing him
some logistical support for an activity. I do not recall this
specific list of equipment beinq-involved,. you know, soiewhere
you got this and if I could check it against the files, if there
are any files available, I could verify whether this is correct.
or not.

Mr. Baron. Whether or not the particular list is correct,
you would say that these couple of passages from the IG Report
generally characterize youf involvement with Harvey in this
one incident correctly?

Mr. Halley. I would want to sharpen this up, because you
have one, two, two paragraphs here. In the first paragraph
there is a reference to some pills. I had nothing to do with
any pills. I have no recollection of any pills

Mr. Baron, Let us jump then to the very last statement and

let me ask you if this confirms your own sense of your knowledge

The report says: “Harvey says that (Halley]" -~ here I

am using your alias =--"never knew to whom delivery was made nor
for what purpose. Halley] was merely called upon to furnish
support for a headquarters operation from which he was otherwise

Mr. Halley. I would say that is correct.

IT want to be meticulously correct here. I do not recall the
specifics of this inventory of equipment. I do not recall,
you know, sitting in a parking lot, survedlling any kind of a

Mr. Baron. At that time, if Harvey had made a request of

detonators, .30 caliber rifles, .45 caliber handguns, radios

and boat radar, would you have supplied that equipment to Harvey

or to anyone he designated without asking him what the purpose

of the operation was?

Mr. Halley. Yes, I would have supplied 4t to Harvey or
to his designated representative, depending on how that person
identified himself to ma with the equipment that he requested.
That was my chain of command and, if he had told me that he
had wanted this material for any operational activity, T would
have seen to it that it was issued to him. That is the way the
Agency functions.

Mr. Baron. Would it have been standard procedure in a
paramilitary operation to procure equipment that would not have
been traceable to the United States as the IG Report indicates
was done in this case?

It depends on what was the

And this plot by William larvey's own admission was directed

Mr.

an avid scuba diver is well-known to me. As I recall, somewhere
in this thing there was a refugee group or Cuban exile group

exploding sea shells.

Mr. Baron. You do not recall ever hearing Desmond
FitzGerald mention that subject or hearing that Desmond
FitzGerald was involved in exploring that possibility, plenting
an exploding sea shell?

Mr. Halley. The exploding sea shell is enough of an off-
beat kind of thing that I think I would have recalled it. I
don't recall it.

I do recall Castro's scuba diving, and that representing
a vulnerability and somewhere in the recesses of my memory,
that does strike a bell with me that some exile group, somebody
was talking about Fidel Castro being vulnerable while he was
scuba diving.

Mr. Baron. Did you'ever hear of a plan to present Castro
with a skin-diving suit in which bacteria injurious to his health
would have been cultured, bacteria that would have produced
tuberculosis and would have produced a dreadful disease?

Mr. Halley. I have never heard of any bacteria approach
to the problem of dealing with Fidel Castro.

I do want to come back to this that I do recall something
about scuba diving, you know, on the range of Fidei being

vulnerable at the time he was scuha diving, but I do not recall

exploding sea shells or bacteria.

Mr. Baron. Other than what you read recently in the papers
did you acquire any knowledge during your period as Chief of
Station at JMWAVE of John Roselli's involvement in Cuban
operations?

Mr. Halley. No. I had the impression from larvey going
off that he was meeting with somebody, and at one point in time
I came to the impression that he was meeting a guy by the name
of John. Who John was, I had no idea. Wa were involved in an
attempt to try to find two Soviets at one point who were of
interest. The’ fellow who provided the lead to that had been
a member of one of the casinos in Cuba at some time.

Mr. Baron. Do yeu remamber who that was?

Mr. Halley. No, I do not. I do not remember the man's
name. It may come to me. You are asking me things, that

I also think that there was soma large scandal, when I was

trouble sorting this out, I want you to understand that --

Mr. Baron. I understand that clearly.

I told you I made my own deduction that John, the one that

I was involved in '62 and '65 I did not know anything about
Sam Giancana. I have since read in the Press about him.
Therefore, the name is familiar to me today.

Mr. Baron. Did you know at that time that Sheffield

connected in any way with those efforts against Castro personall
or against the Castro government?

Mr. Halley. At that time, Shef Edwards was known to me
as Director of Security. That is all. I had no knowledge of
his involvement in any activity against Fidel Castro in a
Personal sense.

Shef Edwards did help Security Officers assigned to my
staff in Miami. Therefore I would periodically go to him about

is Tony Varona.
Mr. Halley. Yes.

Mr. Baron. You said that you did know Tony Varona?

Mr. Halley. I know of Tony Varona, that he was leader of
the consejo, the revolutionary counsel that had been set up to
sort of administer the Bay of Pigs operation. In the post
Bay of Pigs era, Nua Cardona and Tony Varona were people who
still appeared on the exile seene and were prominent. We had
some dealings with Nua Cardona, officers in the Station had
dealings with Nua Cardona and Tony. Varona to pay off, you know,
injuries to peopoe who had been suffered during the Bay of Pigs,
I kaow who he is and so
forth, the name is very familiar to me. I never personally met
with Tony Varona.

Mr. Baron. Were you aware that William Harvey had an
independent line of communication with Tony Varona?
I am not.

Mr, Halley. No,

Mr. Baron. Would it surprise you if that wete the case?
Mr. Halley. The Tony Varona thing would surprise me,
frankly. I think I would not -- I would be surprised, yes.

Mr. Baron. Why is that?

Mr.

Halley. Well, because here is a-case where the guy
was a prominent exile figure,,essentially residing in Miami, and

I knew of no contacts or had “no reasons to suspect any contacts

with this kind of an exile figure, though once it specifically
appeared, I was aware of and it was discussed. This was done
under FitzGerald's stewardship with the Task Force. I was
aware of that. I vould be surprised if someone was in touch
with Tony Varona and I did not know about it, I£ you told me
that is what happened, that is what Narvey has testified to,
I accept that. I am surprised by it.

Mr. Baron. What was the nature of the CIA relationship
to Artime?

Mr. Halley. Well, the Miami Station had no direct: relation
ship with him. As to the nature of the project, you know Artime'

ran‘from the Agency, from other people who actually worked with

‘him on a first time basis.

Mr. Baron. Were you aware of a project called AMLASH?
Mr. Walley. Let me make sure we are talking about the same
thing.

Mr. Baron. We have just gone off the record to straighten
out the fact that we are both talking about the same Cuban’ high
military officer who was known to the CIA by the eryptonym of

AMLASH.

Correct me if I am wrong, Mr. Halley, that you and I agree

that we are referring to the same parson that we have identified
off the record?

Mr. Walley. Yes, we have

Mr. Baron. Were you aware of contacts between AMLASH-1,
as he was known, and Artime?

Mr. Halley. I think at the time that: this was going on, I
do not know whether I was or I was not -- I was aware that the
CIA was in touch with AMLASH.

Mr. Raron. Did: you deal directly with the case officers
who ran AMLASH? :

Mr. Halley. I did not. My recollection of this AMLASH
case is as follows. .At:some point in time; I-had.a conversation
with Desmond FitzGerald in Washington during one of my periodic
visits to Washington from Miami. We discussed at that meeting
‘the nature of our approach to the military establishment in
Cuba. In the context of that conversation, Mr. FitzGerald asked
me if I thought whether it would be a good idea for him to meet
one of these Cuban military personalities, and he subsequently
identified to me the personality he was talking about was

AMLASH-1.

My advice to him was that it would probably not be & good
idea for him to meet him, and the only thing that I could see

coming out of that kind of a contact would be that he, Mr.

FitzGerald, would get a personal feel for what makes some of

these people tick, in human terms, and that that probably was

too high a price to pay for the prospect if anything went wrong,

an individual as prominent in Washington as,

worth what would be gained from that meeting.

Mr. Baron.

Would this have been in the fall of 1963?

Mr. Halley.

I have no recollection of the time.
Subsequent to that, Mr. FitzGerald told me that he had

indeed met him and that he had had an interesting conversation

with him. I subsequently recall that this gentleman was met

in Spain at some point in time --

Mr. Baron.

This gentleman being AMLASH-1?

Mr. Halley.

This gentleman, being AMLASH-1, was met in

Spain. I also recall after having left the Cuban activity that

“I read a Press article showing that. he had been apprehended

and I remember reading the publicity of that particular

activity. It is also my recollection that we put in a cache

for him.

That is about the sum and substance of it.

Mr. Halley. It was a cache. I think that you could::1

recall specifically what the material was that was in the

Mr. Baron. At the point that you were having these
conversations with Desmond PiteGerald, though, in the first
instance the prospect of his contact directly with AMLASH-1,
in the second instance his reaction to his contact with AMLASH-1
do you recall FitzGerald mentioning to you the fact that

AMLASH had requested assurances that*high officials of the U.

government would stand behind him if he undertook operations on
behalf of the CIA?

Mr. Halley. I do not recall this at the time.

You know, I also want to say, as you probably know from
the record, I was later Chief of the wi Division from 1972 to
1973, and I did read some of the files. 1 am familiar with
the case. But at the time -- I am trying to be schizophrenic,
you know, to put this in the time sequence in which we are
+talking about. My recollection of that is that I did not know
that.

Mr. Baron. It would then be your testimony that Mr.
FitzGerald never broached with you the subject of making a
representation to AMLASH-1 that Robert Kennedy or other high

officials of the U.S. government would stand behind him?

Mr. Halley. I do not recall that kind of a conversation

taking place with FitzGerald inthis timeframe that we are
talking about.

Mr. Baron. Do you recall any such conversation at any
point?

Mr. Halley.

No, I do not, in the timeframe that we are
talking about.

Mr. Baron.

When I say at any point, I mean at any point
since 1962.

Mr. Halley. Well, you know, in tha period 1972-73, I did
look at some of. the.files, I did read some of the files. I am
familiar that such conversations took place and that there
were a series of meetings. You know, I know who the case
officer was and so forth.

Mr. Baron. You never discussed the subject directly with
FitzGerald?

Mr. lialley. With FitzGerald, no. I can only say that my
knowledge of that is secondhand from having subsequently read
the files.

Mr. Baron. Was it your impression at that time that one
of the objectives of the contact with AMLASH-1 was the assassinaft
tion of Fidel Castro or other high Cuban leaders?

Mr. Halley.

No. I never had the impression that assassina

tion was a thrust of the activity. In other words, we were

working across-the-board, both in the context that Desmond

‘existing leadership going to be during this event, who has

FitzGeralé and his staff were working on what I was doing in
Miami to try to establish contacts with the Cuban military.
In other words, we saw this as a multi-faceted approach. First,
we wanted penetrations of the Cuban military so that we could
collect intelligence. What were their strengths, weaknesses,
what was their mood, where were things going? Secondly, we
wanted from these sources operational intelligence. Who -- in
other words, who in these groups were dissatisfied as Fidel
consolidated. Who could provide leadership for a counter-
movement against Fidel?

We were looking for people, once we had identified them,
to see if we could establish contacts with any of these leaders
so we could see whether there was a basis for working toward
an overthrow of the Castro government. You know, those were
the basic steps.

Now as you ae down to talking about how you overthrow
Castro, obviously the question comes in of how toes a ‘group who
wants to run a coup or take power take power, and obviously
one of the things that has to be looked at is where does the
control of the various units. So our discussions were all in
that context.

Mr. Baron. Would it have surprised you or would it
surprise you now to learn that at least part of the contact
with AMLASH would have involved planning for an assassination

the contact with Artime?

Mr. Halley. You mean the CIA contact with Artime?

Mr. Baron. Yes,

Mr. Halley. As a concept, the Artime thing was looked at
as another track, an approach to the overall Cuban problem to
see if they could sort of do it on their own, If they could
simply be given, you know, X number of dollars, some equipment,

some guidance, and give them an opportunity to find a Cuban

solution to what was a Cuban problem.

and if you have-not, you should talk to the people who ran the
Artima operation, when this was set up, I think I partiéipated
in giving Artime some tutorial training for a couple of weeks

when this operation was first established in order to familiariz

him with some of the problems of trying to manage a large
operation against Cuba because fe had been out of things for a
couple of years.

Mr. Baron. Were you aware that he had been supplied a
weapon which we already agreed could be characterized as an
assassination weapon?

Mr. Halley. You say “we." You and I?

Mr. Baron. Yes.

Mr. Halley. Which weapon was that?

Mr. Baron. A high-powered rifle with long-range and low
muzzle velocity.

Mr. Halley. I am aware of the fact of this project that
Artime was involved in that. he got a number of weapons, any
number of which could have.been used for sniper type activities.
I am aware of the fact that he had a base in Nicaragua to
‘have activities, so I would find it hard to single out a weapon.
My recollection of that that he was given a large number of
weapons.

Mr. Baron. Was one of Artime's objectives to have been
to assassinate Fidel Castro?

Mr, Halley. Not that I am aware of.

| Nicaraguan government, and therefore there was a part of the

“whole cover’ story, if you will, for him.

Mr. Baron. Did you ever hear any discussion to the
effect that the Agency was attempting to achieva through Artime
indirectly. what they did not want to achieve directly ina
fashion that would be attributed to the CIA, namely the
assassination of Castro?

Mr. Halley. I think that you have tied two issues together
there and I do not think I can answer the question that way.

I would like to separate the question into two parts.

Mr. Baron. Go ahead.

Mr. Halley. The first part, as I mentioned to you earlier
the CIA did establish a. relationship with Artime and he was
given funds and other support to run his approach to solving
the Cuban problem. le was one of two such activities that were
run at the time. And therefore I think that your statement is
correct that perhaps he was set up so that there could be no
direct attribution in his activities to the United States,
because he set up a base in Nicaragua, and the story as I recall

it was put out that he was receiving assistance from the

So, yes, there was an attempt to set him up as a parallel
track or a separate track. That does not follow from that, in
my perspective, that was geared towards an assassination
operation, because that was a fantastically large operation

involving lots of people, you know, with substantial amounts of

money. I was opposed to it at the tima. And once it was set
up, and I did what I was supposed to do, which was to train
Artime and contribute to his training, I then did not pay an
awful lot of.attention to the thing except what I picked up,
you know, over the years, and again in the '72-'73 period,
and talked to officers who had, you know, fore intimate knowledg¢

of it and got an appraisal of it rears what they thought had
occurred.

Mr. Baron. Had you heard at any point that Artime was
supplied weapons for the specific purpose of assassinating
Castro?

Mr. Halley. No, not for the specific purpose of assassina-
ting Castro.

Mr. Baron. Was it your general impression that AMLASII-1
was a reliable agent?

Mr. Halley. I really'do not know that much about him,
you know. This was an operation that was run at that time out
of Washington and, you know, my knowledge was as I described it
to you, the conversations with FitzGerald, Madrid, newspaper
‘articles, so forth, in that particular timeframe.

Mr. Baron. Did the CIA to your knowledge use any gambling
Syndicate contacts inside Cuba or people outside Cuba who were
connected to gambling interests inside Cuba for any operational
purpose including the intelligence gathering?

in the popular jargon.

Mr, Halley. Let me go back. You asked me about ZRRIFLE.
This is one of a thousand or hundreds of cryptonyms. Every day
I read, you know, hundreds of pages of traffic, so when you ask
me do I know what Z2RRIFLE is, I must answer you off the top of
my head no. I have tried to be helpful. T have asked you
several times if you could give me a steering tip or show me
what direction you are going, I might be able to try to comment
on it, but 2RRIFLE as such means nothing to me. You really
could not expect that it would, given the thousands of these
things that come across my dssk.

Mr. Baron. That is absolutely understandable. TI want to
try to see what happens in the way of getting an unrefreshed
recollection from you, then I will go back over these two,
especially the next one, QUWIN. Do you recall a CIA asset who
went by the cryptonym QJWIN?

Mr. Halley. No. I have no knowledge of tlarvey being

Mr. Baron. Harvey has testified, as has Richard Bissell,
I will represent to you, that instruction was given by Bissell
to Harvey to set up, to develop such a capability in early 1961
and that Harvey took steps to develop such a capability in
coordination with an asset in New York named QJWIN and I think
that period of greatest activity was in 1962 and WIN was
involved in spotting potential assets among the criminal under-
world in Europe and might be used for any number of dirty
deeds.

Mr. diGenova. It should be emphasized that the Executive

Action Plan that you are referring to has had as its goal the

incapacitation of foreign leaders, one possibility of

-incapacitation being the ultimate weapon, assassination. It

was just not assassination. It was a spectrum of activities
that could be used to incapacitate a foreign leader anywhere
from illness, chemical warfare, and then including death.

Me. Baron. Let us pick out some specifics and discuss
them briefly here.

Near the beginning of this article, it mentions that JMWAVE
Station operated within an annual budget of well in excess of
$50 million.

Would that be accurate to you?

Mr. Halley. .I do not recall whether that is an accurate

figure. We would have to go back to the records. You know, as
I explained to you earlier, the start of the operation taking
place in March and escalatéd'up, to a high’ point! and. then
dropped off. In the budgetary cycle, we are dealing with a

of figures, and I would not want to give you an inaccurate

mass
answer. That is something that could be researched -- we have
the files -- rather than speculate for youon the buildup and

_ reduction in the operation. I do not feel that is usefuly

Mr. Baron. As a ballpark figure, would you be able to

place the annual budget of the Station in the neighborhood
of tens of millions of dollars?

Mr. Halley. No, I would not, because of this transition,

“you know, period, the costs were very high in the beginning to

get a start-up operation, brought to a certain peak, and then

tapered off and starting to be peeled back, 1 would not want

to draw a figure of --

Mr. diGenova. What would the start-up cost?

In terms of what they involved or dollars?

Mr. Halley. I have no recollection of the dollars.

Mr. Baron. Would you say that $50 million would be in the

right ballpark for your activities at the peak?

Mr. Halley. I just have no recollection of the dollar
figure. You might want.to get that figure when you can retrieve
it in the files. It is available.

Mr. Baron. Were the operations of JMWAVE coordinated with
other Latin American CIA Station's, as the article indicates
here?

Mr. Halley. I think my recollection of that phase is that
Cuban activities with other Latin American’ stations were

coordinated with JMWAVE.

Mr. Baron. Coordinated with JMWAVE?
Mc, Halley, With JMWAVE.
Mr. Baron. Who had the central coordinating responsibility

Mr. Halley. Washington.

Mr, Baron. Was that. delegated by Washington to you?

Mr. Halley. No. Essentially Washington had the overall
‘coordinating responsibility, but that needs some elaboration.
Let me say that we would become aware in our activities in
Miami that a number of interesting people had come in on a
flight to Mexico City. We would send a cable down to Mexico
City with an information copy to Washington outlining who we

were interested in, and I would probably send somebody down to

Mexico to look at the particular Cuban or the operational
opportunity in conjunction with the Station Chief in Mexico
City. So we were in some cases a clearinghouse.

The final coordination authority rested in Washington. 1
will say that if Miami wanted to do something and for local
Political reasons in Mexico thé Mexican Station Chief did not.
want to do it, that would be adjudicated, not by Miami, but by
Washington.

Mr. Baron. Let me quote you a passage here and see if it
comports with our discussions earlier of spacial arrangements
you may have, the JMWAVE Station may have had, with law enforce-
ment authorities in Florida.

The article says: "All the boat missions to Cuba were tech

Guard."

Is that generally accurate?

Mr. Halley. I think, as I described to you before, there

‘was coordination with the Coast Guard in terms of vessel

departures. The other is Immigration?

Mr. Baron. Customs, Immigration and Coast Guard.

Mr. Halley. Immigration, there would not have been
coordination on a particular, you know, boat dispatch. On the
other hand, let's say if a mission aborted for some reason and

Now the third group was Customs. Customs did have a

off the Florida Keys in particular, those were coordinated with
the Coast Guard so they would not be expending their manpewer

Agency was doing.

Mr. Paron. The article continues to say: “rt was illegal
for agents to travel around with machine guns and Plastic
explosives in the cars, as they often did. The station had to
establish liaison with seventeen police jurisdictions alonq
the Florida coast and into the Keys. The result was that
any agent who was arrested for anything from drunken driving to
illegal possession of firearms would be quickly released."

into two parts. There were no firearms ~~

Mr. Baron. I am not saying firearms supplied to them by

the CIA for a CIA mission or any agent travelling down the

-gtreet in Miami who happened to have a Saturday tight Special
in his car or who happened to be drunk while driving. Would
such a person be released right away or once the CIA connection
surfaced?

the case would be looked at at that particular point and if he
had a Saturday Night Special, you know) there would not be any
intervention on his behalf because it had nothing to do with
his task on the behalf of CIA.

I did mention to you earlier we had training camps in variou
parts of the State. If somebody came out of the training camp
and did get drunk and was picked up and did not speak English
or something and the police jurisdictions did have a way of
getting in touch with us and we might intervene on a case of
disorderly conduct.

Mr. diGenova. How was that established, the relationship o

liaison with these jurisdictions. Had it been set up with

JMWAVE directly through Washington and down through the FBI?
How had that been done?

Mr. Halley. It varied. When we started expanding the
operation, you know, there had already been a Station there
and there also were two security units in the greater Miami
area. In some cases the existing contacts at the Station were
expanded, the same with Dade County. In other cases, the
security of personnel who had established contact with other
jurisdictions were used to effect the introduction. In some
cases, we had our security people who were on my staff go out
to these jurisdictions and identify themselves simply with a

badge and a name and discuss the kinds of things that they were

interested in so that there would not bea cross ‘of ‘problems
with these jurisdictions and therefore a liaison was opened on
that basis, a multiplicity of approaches.

Mr. Baron. The article discusses the fact that regular
commando raids were run out of JMWAVE Station to the shore of
Cuba, and that those commandog-were equipped with all kinds of
explosives and armaments.

Is that generally a fair statement, that we were running on|
a regular basis commando raids to Cuba?

Mr. Halley. Yes. There were a serias of commando raids
run from the Miami Station against targets in Cuba.

Mr. Baron. Were assassination weapons, that is, high-power|
rifles with low muzzle velocity and telescopic sights, supplied
to those commando teams as a matter of course?

Mr. Halley. .No, they were not. For most of those
commando teams, you were looking for a different kind of a
weapon, You are looking for a weapon with a high range of fire
power over a short distance to deal with an emergency situation

rather than the kind of, you know, weapon that we are talking

“about.

In other words, you would find that type of a group armed
with a submachine gun, as for example.

Mr. Baron. If an assassination weapon as we have
described it was supplied to a commando team, they would have
to have a specific purpose in mind for its use?

TOP SECRET



prone (Ares 202) 544-6000

Mr. Halley. Yes.

Also, again, all of these weapons were controlled, the
weapons that were issued at the time of the mission on the
mother ship and picked up on the team's return to the mother

ship, so there was accountability for the weapons.

Mr. Baron. ‘Would it have been unusual to supply what we

have called an assassination weapon to a commando team?
Me. Hall Well, that depends on the mission: For
instance, let me use an example.

Most of the missions that were run were run aqainst targets

wthat were in fairly close proximity to the shore. If you are

going to put a party to attack your objectives, let us say the
objective was a petroleum storage tank, if you were going to do
this by putting charges up against the petroleum storage tank
that meant that you had to have a group infiltrate close

énough to put the charges on the tank. Some distance away
from them you would give them a second element of the commando
team which would be providing covering fire for this group in
case they got into trouble and cannot handle it on the ground.
This covering fire group might have had a light machine gun

a Belgian weapon. They could have these kinds of weapons and
they did have these kinds of weapons’ which in the definition you!
are using could be used as a sniper weapon or whatever, but the
basic reason for having that weapon was to provide fire support

for the other members uf the commando team. And therefore when

this mission was over and they returned, those weapons were
taken back from them and accounted for. They were shaken down
so that we did not have weapons disappearing out of our
control.

Mr. Baron. Such weapons, high-powered rifles with telescop
scopes, conceivably with silencers, were supplied with some
regularity, but they were kept under tight control?

Mr, Halley. We had high-powered rifles. I cannot think noy
of a case where there was a sniper scope attached to the rifle
I can think of no case where there was a silencer attached to
a rifle in any of these commando raids. There were a number of
raids conducted, some of them involved teams of fifteen or
twenty men. I am not prepared to say that no man ever had one
but I do. not recall one. You know, if you gave me an inventory

infiltration team. He was a UDT man.

Mr. Baron. In the Harper's articla, {t says that Martinez
indicated that "More than once he was given personal charge of
weapons drops in which special rifles with silencers and tele-
scopic sights were left in designated inland spots."

Do you know of a factual basis for that statement?

Mr. Halley. Martinez is undoubtedly factually correct when
he says he put caches on the ‘coast ofCuba that contained weapons
I do not know how he would be able to tell what kind of weapons
were in the cache. The reason I say that is that when one of
thess missions were planned, the cache was put together and
packed by our logistics group and once the cache was put
together it was brought on board the vessel and the cache was
then turned over to the team for infiltration so he would never
have seen the contents of the cache, he would not have opened
it up because it was always in a sealed container.

It is conceivable that in the pre-mission briefing that
he got before he went down that he was told that we are putting
in a cache containing a radio or putting in a cache containing
weapons because that would influence what he selected as a
cache type. In other words, if it were a radio, we would want
it higher and drier than we would a can containing weapons that
were wraped in cosmolene and so forth. He might know that they
were weapons, but he wouldn't know that they were silenced

and they had a scope. I must honestly say to you TI doubt that.

Mr. Baron. Pid you know of any weapons drops that were

mada for the purpose of supplying someone inside Cuba with a
weapon for the assassination of Fidel Castro?

Mr. Halley. No, not for that clearly stated purpose. As
I told you, we put a lot of weapons caches in. The weapons were
multi-purpose weapons, could be usgd. I know of no cache that
went in specifically for the task of playing a contributory role
to assassinating Fidel Castro.

Mr. Baron. It would not have been contrary to the policy
directives under which you were operating at the time to
supply such a weapon to someone inside Cuba who miqht have
access to Castro?

Mr. Halley. No, it would not have been. For instance,
I can remember several resistance groups thdt’we had that had tw
three hundred men that we were supplying on a regular basis.

Hr, diGenova, Inside Cuba?

Mr. Halley. Inside Cuba, that were essentially living in

| the bush to a large extent, whom we did supply weapons to and

got ammunition to them and so forth. And that was why I was
very careful when you mentioned this linkage before to saying
that I could not be a guarantor as to what these men would do
with these weapons once they got their hands on them. They
were free agents.

Mr. diGenova. This is an interesting point. This has
come up before. We are aware of our reading of the record that

there is little if anything we can do to control those weapons

course, was understood that thare was a lack of control, and

to the extent that it was a problem, it existed and had to be
tolerated because of the nature of the operation, would that

be correct?

Mr. Halley. I do not know whether I want to phrase it
exactly as you have in terms of this lack of control. Our
mission in dealing with these groups was to first, to put them
in areas where we did not have other intelligence covers. Their|
first task was to collect intelligence.

The: second task was to organize a resistance which would
take armed action if we ever got a total package put together

missions. Once we issued the weapons to the team leader, if
“you will, he had freedom to recruit from among the peasants
anybody he wanted to. If he gave the peasant a weapon, thers
was no guarantee either by the team leader or by us that that
peasant would not do something that we did not want him to do.

Mr. diGenova. Were there any restrictions, once,

example, those weapons caches were delivered either by land or

for

air -- and we have spoken to Mr. Murray who was in the Havana
Station, for example, for avhila and Arthur Avignon who

was head of the Havana Station for awhile who indicated that
they were aware of the weapons drops and.were intimately
familiar with where they would be.

Mr. Halley. That wus all before my time. TI have no
knowledge of that. During my time, we made no drops by air.
Mr. diGenova. Were there any limitations that were
placed of how the weapons would be used that were delivered into

Cuba to these internal resistance groups?

Mr. Halley. I cannot speak to this period that you are
addressing.

Mr. diGenova. During your period.

Mr. Halley. Ouring my period, ths weapons were issued
essentially as self-protection for the people who were living
in the bush. Secondly, to be used in a military operation at

such time as we got the whole package together. Thirdly, they

‘were to be used for self-protection if they conducted raids,

ambushes, sabotage operations.

this article that I would like to ask you to comment on

were powerful rifles with sophisticated scopes, Springfields

sent to shoot pigeons or to kill rabbits. Everyone in the
Underground was plotting to kill Castro and the CIA was helping
the Underground. I was with the Underground as well as thea CIh,
So you can see I was involved in, the plots too, but that is

also obvious."

You commented before that there was a lot of talk in the
air about assassinating Castro. Martinez seems to ba taking
that a few steps further, saying that there were actual plots
underway in the Cuban Underground to assassinate Castro and
that people who worked with the CIA were aware of those plots
and were aiding them in effect by the weapons they were
supplying.

Is that an accurate statement?

Mr. Halley. No, I do not think I can go along with that

statement. Martinez' role as I described it to you, he is

accurate when he says that weapons were put -in-and that
he participated in putting them in. I again question how he

I just do not see that,
I would have to accept that as a sort of secondhand statement

Mr. diGenova. Could he have found out about this after
the fact from people that he knew in Cuba, members of the
resistance in Cuba that he knew of who would have told him the
nature of the items that they would have received in a cache

delivery? Would that be one way that he could have found out?

Was he that intimately involved, to your knowledge?

Mr. Walley. He was not at the time. This is the period

that I am familiar with, '62-'65. I do not know. Maybe some
of these people have come out since then, and maybe he has
talked to people who have come out in '68, '69, things like that
I cannot exclude that.

At the time, I do not think, however, he would have had
that kind of firsthand knowledge, and therefore I have trouble
with that statement and I cannot identify with it.

Mr. Baron. The Harper's article says: "By the end of
1961, several men affiliated with the CIA had already been
foiled in attempts to kill him" -- meaning Castro -- "among
them, Luis Toroella, executed; Eloy Gutierrez Menoyo, still in
prison; William Morgan, executed; and Antonio Veciana, escaped
to the United States. lad these men succeeded, their efforts
would have been tied to the U.S. only indirectly, if at all."

Mr, Halley. No, there is no connection that I know of
between these names and CIA. This guy Luis Toroella does not
ring any bells with me. Eloy Gutierrez Menoyo was a leader of

Alpha 66. He may have been in Cuba in '61. During the time

that I was involved in Cuban affairs he was in exile for -- he
was in Miami for -a long period of time.

Mr. Baron. Can you explain what Alpha 66 is for the
record?

Mr. Halley. Alpha 66 was a Cuban exile organization that
was engaged in a number of raids against the Cuban government.
They claimed to have attacked Cuban shipping, fishing boats, and
cleimed to have an organization in Cuba that was a resistance
organization. Gutierrez Menoyo was therefore a well-known name
to me. We had no direct contact with him.
William Morgan is also a well-known name. Wis activities
and exploits in Cuba are well-known to anybody that has dealt
with Cuban affairs.

Mr. Baron. Do you have any knowledge of a connection
between any of these people and assassination attempts against
Fidel Castro?

Mr. Halley. I have none, no connection hetween these names
and CIA and attempts to assassinate Fidel Castro.

been involved in assassination attempts whether or not they

Gutierrez Menoyo sitting here and if he were to say in 1962 1
attempted to shoot Fidel Castro, that is Gutierrez Menoyo did
this, I would have no reason to doubt. I would have no basis
for proving it, wither.

Mr. Baron. You have naver heard of these alleged assassins
tion attempts before?

Mr, Halley. No.

Morgan's name I would have to do a file trace to get myself
back up to date. Morgan did get himself in trouble with Fidel
over some issue,, as I recall was in prison. I do not recall,
remember if he was executed, although this says he was executed.

Mr. Baron. What about the last nama on the list
Antonio Veciana?

Mr. Halley. That is a name that rings a bell with me, but
IT do not attach anything to it. In other words, it is a name
T have probably read in various and sundry kinds of reports.

Mr. Baron. Muring your tenure, would you have been in a

attempts against Castro, {£ that were indeed the fact?

Gutierrez Menoyo. We did have a steady stream of reporting on

the activities of all exile groups and Alphs 66 was high on the
list of groups that had a capability of doing this kind of
thing. Therefore, they received quite a bit of coverage from
us, from the FBI, from Customs, and others.

They were on everybody's sort* of watch list.

Mr. Baron. Do you have any recollection of Cuesta

Valle's specific activities with the CIA?
Mr. Halley.

No. I would have to run traces on him and

take a look at what the information is.

Mr. Baron. Was Frank Sturgis connected with the JMWAVE

Station? “

Mr. Halley. He was not.

Mr. Not under the name of Frank Fiorino either?

Baron.

Mr. Halley. No, he was not. This is again one of these

great myths. At this whole Cuba thing, Frank Sturgis was a
soldier of fortune, was constantly involved on the periphery
of the Cuban exile community. tle was involved in free lance
Operations against Cuba. He was somebody that the FBI,
Customs, CIA, everybody, reported on. le was a household name,
but he was not. on the CIA payroll during the period that I was
involved in Cuban affairs, that is the payroll of the Miami
Station. I remember name traces being run on this guy and so
forth, and the Agency had no contact with him during that
Period of time.

Mx. Baron. Are you aware of his ‘ever having been on the
payroll of the CIA?

Mr.

Halley. I personally am not aware of it, and I think,

you know,if you had gone to the Agency that they must shave ‘given
you all sorts of traces on this fellow afid.told you the same
thing.

Baron. Are you aware of the AMOT program?

Walley. Yes, I am.

Baron. How'was that spelled?

Halley. AMOT.

Baron. What was that program?

Halley. That was a program involving a Cuban emigre
group that was used as an operational support mechanism to

support the Miami Station.

Mr. Baron. What kind of support did they provide?

Mr. Halley. They were interviewers of refugees who came
out of Cuba. They provided translator personnel to translate
the Spanish language publications that were of interest to us.
They provided information on the various mainstream activities
that were going on in the Cuban exile community.

Mr. Baron. Did they provide support for paramilitary
operations against Cuba?

Mr. Halley. They might have identified people whom they
thought we should interview or look to or see if they would
fit into other paramilitary programs. In other words, they
had the contacts.in the Cuban community. Say we had a require-
ment for a diesel engineer. We would say to the AMOT organiza-
tion, we would say we are looking for a Cuban who is a diesel
engineer who has a first engine's license, and they would go
through all of their contacts until they would come up with

one, a Week or ten days or whatever, having identified

Send somebody around to talk to him independent of them and
pick him up to work for us in our maritime activities.

It was that kind of operational support.

Mr. Baron. People who were part of this program were
not used as paramilitary operatives, at least insofar as they
operated under the aegis of this program. There were some of
them who may have been in the paramilitary program and then
left it and were subsequently picked up in the AMUT organiza-
tion.

Could we go off the record for a moment?

(Discussion off the record.)

Mr. Malley. We are now back on the record.

The AMOTs also worked with us on a common project, which
was monitoring Cuban naval traffic, things like that, so they
were used across the hoard for operational support tasks.

Mr. Baron. One more general question.

Did the JMWAVE Station have an operational relationship
with the FBI?

Mr. Halley. I would not

Mr. Baron. Was the FBI involved in supporting your
activities in any way?
Mr. Halley. I would rather phrase that in my language,

because I think

Mr. Halley. Ido not know if your question means the same
thing to me. I would prefer to say we had a liaison relation-
ship with the FBI, that is, on matters dealing with counter-

intelligence matters. There was a regular-exchange of data

with the FBI.

There was an exchange of name traces on people
that they were conducting investigations on, for countérintelli
gence purposes,We would trace certain individuals and with the
FBI there were a couple of counterintelligenca cases that we
discovered that were turned over to the FRI.
So this is in the context of the normal CIA-FBI liaison
that existed between the two aqencies.

Mr. Baron. But the FBI was not involved in supporting

paramilitary commando raids to the shore of Cuba, is that

correct?
Mr. Halley. I do not know what you are driving at

there. I am having a little trouble with that. are you saying

that the FBI dispatched paramilitary teams to Cuba as

an organization?

Mr. Baron. Were they involved in paramilitary training

“of any of the CIA operatives?

Mr. Halley. No. ‘The FBI did not train any CIA personnel
during my tenure in the Miami Station.

Mr. Baron. Did the FBI at any point provide with you
links to people who had gambling interests inside Cuba?

Mr. Walley. No. We covered the gambling thing previously.

Mr. Halley.

I read this somewhere in tha record in post
years, but I was not aware of this at the time, at the time I
was in Miami.
Mr. Baron. Were you aware that serious consideration had
been given to the tactic of assassination at CIA Meadquarters
during your period of involvement ‘with Cuban affairs?
Mr. Halley. No, that is in the period 1962 to '65.when
I was the Station Chief in Miami, I was not aware of any serious
you know, program operational effort towards assassinating
Castro.

Mr. Baron.

Were you aware that serious consideration had

been given to’ the tactic or to the use of the tool of assassina-

“tion at CIA Headquarters prior to your coming on as JMWAVE

Mr. Halley. No, I was not aware of any, you know, planned

Mr. Halley. I went through this before bafore you came

in and explained to Mr. Baron that the subject of assassination

was constantly being discussed in the Cuban community and was a

part of the fabric of the times.

Mr. diGenova. That I am aware of.

You are not the only

one who has expressed that. knowledge that they were all saying

let's kill him, let's get together: °.

Mr. Halley. There was a lot of discussion of this kind of

subject of assassination and that is why I keep trying to be

precise that there was no programmatic operational program that

I was aware of to assassinate Castro.

Mr. Baron. Although the context in which we discussed the

talk that was in the air of assassinating Castro was coffee shop

in Miami and conversation among Cubans as opposed to conversa-

tions among high CIA officials back in Headquarters, were you

aware that there were at least serious discussions of the

use of assassination against Castre at CIA Headquarters?

Mr. Halley. No, I was not. We are plowing the same ground]

that we covered before in this.
As I indicated to you, people would come out of Cuba and
discuss these kinds of things. Some of these were reported in,

you know, traffic back to Washington. People would discuss

what are the prospects of somebody assigned to assassinate

Castro. In that particular context, yes, discussions on the

assassination of Castro took place. That is why I keep coming

back, if you are saying that if anybody outlined an opsrational
Plan to me, did I help construct the plan, did I make a contri-
bution to a plan, my answer {s again no. Wa talked earlier,
you asked me about those exploding sea shells of which'I said
I had never heard of but I had heard discussions of Castro's
vulnerability because he was a scuba diver. And you asked me
about bacteria, I said I had never heard of an introduction of
bacteria, but I had heard again about Castro's vulnerability
in this context. Where I heard it, as I told you before, I do
not remember.

Mr. Baron. I realize We are plowing some of the same
furroughs again. I am trying to be meticulous in the way you
were before. You just now said that the subject of assassina~
tion probably came up in the context of discussing the contin-
gencies of Castro's death. Did it come up in terms of discus-
sing whether or not a plan should be put together to assassinate
Castro, whether or not an operation should be mounted --

Mr. Halley. “I cannot recall any such discussion, but in

any state where there is a leadership dominated by one man, it

‘is always a discussion of succession. That question has come

up, you know, if something happened to Fidel Castro, if he is
thrown over, if he does something foolish himself or if somebody
is successful in assassinating him, somebody who decides sudden-
ly to take his machetti and just get out in the sugar cane

field, again, the question was, who replaces Castro, and we

Mr. Baron. Again, discussion of what to do upon the

Mr. Halley. Non-Agency induced.

Mr. Baron. As opposed to this, which is my
Were you aware of any kind of a discussion at CIA Headquarters
on whether or not the CIA should induce the death of Fidel
Castro? :

Mr. Halley. I do not recall any such discussion. That
is why I have gone into all this background to try to explain
the mood of the times and that is why I keep referring to, in
my Sense of the word, as a professional intelligence officer,

of an operational plan, I was not a participant in any discus-

‘sion in which an operational plan for the assassination of

Castro was discussed. That is, I think, the heart of the
matter.

in terms of reporting from Miami?

Mr, Halley. Could we go off the record?

(Discussion off the record.)

Mr. diGenova. Mr, Halley, we have just had a brief
discussion here about some of the things that were covered
before I arrived by Mr. Baron and*you. I do not want to cover
any more of that ground.

it is my understanding in discussing the structure of
JMWAVE's relationship with Headquarters, General Lansdale's
name came up, and that on one occasion, General Lansdale actuall
came down to Miami to visit the Station to gat firsthand
knowledge of what was transpiring. Ts that correct?

Mr. Halley. That is correct.

Mr. diGenova. Do you have-any idea when that was?

Mr. Halley. No. I stated earlier it was in 1962. It
Probably was in the summer of 1962 hecause it was after my
family arrived in Miami. I do not remember the exact dates.
It could be established probably from records of the Agency.

I do not recall it specifically.

Mr. diGenova. To your knowledge, did he-travel by himself
or was he with compatriots or aides?

Mr. Halley. My recollection of that was that he came down
on a special airplane. There may have been other people on the
plane with him, I do not recall, but he landed at Homestead
Air Force Base. As I recall, we picked him up from there.

Mr. diGenova. Did General Lansdale travel under his own

or under a cover name?

Mr. Halley. Throughout the time that he was in contact

me and the Station he was operating as General Lansdale.

Mr. diGenova. Did he hava contact when ha was there with

of the assets themselves? ~

Mr. Halley. lie had no contact with any Cubans that I am
aware of. He did spend the night that he came down with some
friends at Homestead Air Force Base, but I do not recall, I
would have no way of knowing what he did that evening.

Mr. diGenova. For the time that he was at JMWAVR he was
with officials such as yourself who had a supervisory capacity
at JMWAVE Station?

Mr. Halley. That is correct.

Mr, diGenova. I have no further questions.

Mr. Baron. On the record, I just want to thank you for
your testimony here today. It has been a long day and we
have gone over a lot of things quite carefully and it has been
most informative.

I would also like to ask you, if you would, to pursue for
us that one name of the man who was connected with gambling
interests in Cuba and supplied somé intelligence to JMWAVE
Station.
