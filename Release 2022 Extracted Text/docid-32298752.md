The informant further stated that

BETTOR boasts of keeping a dual set of books, one being a true set

for the MANNARINOs' use, and the other a false set.

MANNARIN® :

The informant surmised that SAM MANNARINO is handling

most of the legitimate enterprises for the MANNARINO organization

while GABRIEL controls the gambling and other illicit enterprises.

A reliable informant on May I1, 1956, advised SA PORTELLA that

SAM MANNARINO had recently made trips to Chicago for an unknown

purpose and that for the past two months MANNARINO had been paying

him $200 a week for locating property which MANNARINe would

subsequently purchase: According to the informant, practically

all the property purchased by MANNARINO is recorded in the name of

a relative or an employee of the Nu Ken Iron and Steel Company

telephones for the MANNARINOS.

ZERVIS further stated that the

MANNARINOs contool the numbers racket in New Kensington and that

FRINKIE PHILLIPS, father of FRANKIE PHILLIPS, is hated by SAM

MANNARINO but respected by GABRIEL MANNARINO because GABRIEL

realizes that FRINKIE PHILLIPS remains very close to BILL NOWE and

Judge BAUER, because of their control of all rackets and gambling

in Westmoreland County. ZERVIS advised further that GABRIEL

MANNARINO continues to

operate his gambling establishments and

therefore must show FRINKIE PHILLIPS some consideration in order

not to incur the wrath of BILL NOWE.
