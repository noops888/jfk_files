2022 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992

MEMORANDUM FOR:

FILE

Talking to Hank Schorr today, he passed the following

interesting detail on ISCA reqaests:

Cos now holds for HSCà review some 1,850 documents

on individuals on whom requests were made, plus another

414 documents on orgenizations.

This covers about 30

individuals (there was no record in CCS on a much larger

number of people). He adds that he could not tell me

how many files were involved, nor now many pages there

were per document.

He states that no one from fisca has come down to 100k

at the first document.

He states that CCS is up to date on all requests

received by it, which has been reported to siDDo

(now Shepanek) •

I wonder if this has been reported to sca people,

and in what form.

And what does fiscA understand to

be its responsibility to review material when reported

ready for review?
