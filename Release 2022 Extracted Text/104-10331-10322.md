MEMORANDUM FOR THE FILE

SUBJECT: ADDO Briefing of JFK Board

1. On 14 November, ADDO (Dawid Edger briefed the
Assassination Records Review Board and selected staff on
the subject of protecting the names of stations that appear
in JFK documents. Also attending from the DO were Bill
McNair, Fred Wickham, and Eleanor Neiman. Barry Harreldon
and I participated for HRG. (C) ;

2. (Bag ex) reviewed a number of points that were
included in a recent memorandum from the DDO to the Board
on the subject. He told the Board that the Agency agreed
to acknowledge several stations for the relevant period,
but that it was important to protect many others. He said
that the Agency would appeal if the Board did not agree to
delete the names of stations in the latter category. (C)

3. We discussed possible options that the Board might
consider e.g., substituting wording ‘such as “European
station”, or writing a summary of certain cables for release
without identifying specific stations. (FOUO)

4. The Board was non-committal, but clearly was
finding it difficult to assess the damage to current CIA
operations that would be caused by releasing the locations
of stations in 30-year old documents. (FOUO)
