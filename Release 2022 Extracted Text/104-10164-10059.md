2022 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992

i.

SEGRET

MEN: RANDUM FOR: Chief, WH/4/PM

SUBJECT:

Francisco (Frank) BARSES, Wealthy Cuban

with RR, Sugar and Rice Holdings

14 July 1960

1: I Intervieved Willlan C. DAVIS, now of ICA and former employee

of Subject, regarding BARjaS. Attached are 00 and CI reports of inter-

views with DAvIs.

c. In talláng to DAVIS, I stressed the subject of BARES "organization" .

now many in it? How organized? What kind of comminications? Where locatedi

waat 18 their motivation? DAVIS has no detailed information on 1t, but

sald 1f Frank BARiS gives the word, they would go into action against CASTRO.

This certainly looks like a built-in railroed disruption capability, because

If BARUES hes followers anywhere, it would be on the RR systen. Also, the

BARIES family name would seem to have political and propaganda value. I

asked if there is any BATISTA tie-up and DAVIS said emphatically no. He

‚SAYS BARDES' goal 1s an anti-Communist regime In Cuba.

The arranged plan 1s for DAVIS' wife to call BARiS (11 there 1s

U.B. Interest) and say DAVIS 18 sick.

BARLS wIll then come to Beaumont,

Texas, the first part of August for 2 days only and meet DAVIS there.

4. Hould like to discuss further with you. this looks l1ke & good

posalbillty of developing a capability in Camaguey and Oriente where we

need it badly, Communicationo esthor by radlo and/or sW appear posaiblo.
