7 MENORANDUM FOR: Chief, WH/l/PM 14 duly 1960
t SUBJECT: Freneisco (Frank) » Wealthy Cuban eaua
with RR, Sugar and Rite Holdings ‘

1. I interviewed William C. DAVIS, nov of ICA end former employee

of Subject, regarding BARPES. Attached are 00 and CI reports of inter-
views with DAVIS.

2. In talking to DAVIS, I stressed the subject of BARFES “organization” - .
how many in it? How organized? What kind of communications? Where located?
What is their motivation? DAVIS has no detailed information on it, but
said if Frank Gives the word, they would go into action against CASTRO.
This certainly looks like a built-in railrosd disruption capability, because
if BARYES

hes followers anywhere, it would be on the RR system. Also, the
BAMFES family name would seem to

i

have political and propaganda value. I
asked if there is eny BATISTA tie-up and DAVIS said emphatically no. He

-Seys BARYES' goal is an anti-Communist regime in Cuba.

3+ The arranged plen is for DAVIS' wife to call BARFES (if there is
U.B. interest) and say DAVIS is sick. will then come to

Beaumont,
Texas, the first part of August for 2 days only and meet DAVIS there.
4, Would like to discuss further with you. This looks like a good

possibility of developing a capability in Comaguey and Oriente where ve
need it badly. Communications either by radio and/or BW appear possible.
