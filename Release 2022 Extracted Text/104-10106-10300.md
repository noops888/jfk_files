Yurily Ivanovich NOSENKO

IDENTIFICATION: NOSENKO, Yurily Ivanovich, a Soviet
KGB officer who defected in 1964 and
was subsequently involuntarily con-
fined in the U.S. by the Agency for
a period of approximately three years.

BACKGROUND H NOSENKO first contacted Agency per-
sonnel in Switzerland in June 1962
and. subsequently defected. in January
1964. NOSENKO was brought to the U.S.
and after a period of relative freedom
he was involuntarily confined in
a April 1964. From April 1964 to
August 1965, -he was confined at an
Agency controlled site in Clinton, '
Maryland. From August 1965 to

Oc, “NOSENKO was confined
at Virginia. In October
1967, he was returned to the Washington

area, given increasing amounts of
freedom until he was given total free-
dom in April 1969. NOSENKO became a
U.S. citizen in April 1974. NOSENKO
was employed by the Agency as a
consultant in March 1969 and continues
under contract to date. His present
salary is $23,500 per year.

APPROVAL : (1) The legal basis to confine NOSENKO
against his will was discussed by
Mr. Richard Helms, DD/P, and others with
the Deputy Attorney General on 2 April
1964 (Tab 1). On 3 April 1964, the
Agency General Counsel, Mr. Lawrence
Houston, advised the Director of Security
by memorandum that such confinement was
proper (Tab 2).

fo

(2) There are a series of lettérs from
the DDCI, DCI and others to various
agencies, including the Department of
Justice and the White House, covering
the period 1964 to 1969, evidencing
awareness of these agencies of the
NOSENKO affair (Tab 3).

(3) The conditions of NOSENKO's confine-

ment were established by the Office of
Security (Tabs 4 § 5).

CG (¢€

RESULTS 4 By memorandum dated 2 October 1968,
the Director of Security forwarded
two reports to the DDCI summarizing
the results of the NOSENKO case to
that date. The reports are voluminous.
One was prepared by the Office of
Security and the other by the FBI.
Both reports conclude that NOSENKO
was a bona fide defector. A draft
memorandum attached to this file,
dated 21 October 1968 and prepared
by the CI Staff, raises question
regarding NOSENKO's bona fides
and challenges the above two reports.

TERMINATION 3 NOSENKO continues under contract to
the Agency. He is brought to Washington
periodically to consult on matters ,
germane to his background and experience.
Various reports are available in the
files of the Office of Security which
detail financial aspects of this case.
No final accounting has been made since
the project continues.

caaae COMMENTS. H (1) While the Office of Security files

: do document the rationale for the original
confinement of NOSENKO, they do not
document the rationale for his continued
confinement over so long a period of time.
A memorandum dated 5 August 1969 states
that various congressional staff officers
were briefed on NOSENKO and states that
concern for his safety, as well as con-
cern regarding his bona fides, prompted
the prolonged confinement. (See Tab 6)

(2) Office of Security files document
a period in 1969 during which a mail
cover was placed on NOSENKO.

(3) During the above period, NOSENKO

was allowed a pleasure trip to Florida.
During this trip, Agency personnel, with
apparent Headquarters approval, obtained
the services of prostitutes. This
apparently occurred on at least two
occasions.

MEMORANDUM FOR-RECORD ”

SUSJECT: Discussion with Deputy Atterney:. ”
c _ General on Nosenko Case 9.

_ » Nr. Houston and Mr. Murphy get with
the Deputy Attorney General and nembers of his staff to
discuss subject case, - Present from Mr. Katzenbach's—
staff were Messrs. Foley, Yeagley and Rois. ssstsssscrdia

126 Myr. Helms explained the Nosenko case briefly ~,
and indicated that shortly we would be faced with what
we at least considered to be two problems on which we
would like the advice of the Department of Justice,
First, we would seeon feel coupelled to begin hostile i
interrogation of Nosenko in order to arrive at the truth

; which ve detained Nosenko against his will for this pur-
pose. Second,’ we would have to be ready after deternin-

ing. that we could obtain no additional information from *
Nosenko to deport him, We had thought of taking him to.

- Germany: and transferring him to Soviat custody-in Borlin.. -

where this has been done a number of tines in the Past. .

Q 3. There was soae discussion of whether deportation
to another country wight be a consideration. Mr. Halas
explained we would prabably face publicity probleas in
deporting to a third country of the kind we would en-
counter if ho were free in the U, S. Nr.’ Helms noted
there were many itens of. information which we and the

FBI realize are of no Significance because of the file
holdings»we have but which an unscrupulous néwspaper nan
could use to creato: sischies, This aspect was then dropped
and it was the consensus. that Berlin was probably the best
place, :

4. The question of the basis for detention was again
raised and related by Mr. Foloy to the conditions under
which Nosenko is in this country. He is hore as an “ox~
clusion and parole case" which means he has not been
adnitted and has been paroled to the Agency which is
responsible for him while he is in this country. This

parole can be interpreted’ to mean’ parole to a specific
locale which would provide sone justificatiog for our. aH
detaining hin for questioning, It was then pointed out, ~
however, that) if he said he wished to leave the country
to return to the Soviet Union, technically we would not .
bo able to detain hin-further. | In this event, we would
be faced with the need to deport his quickly and quietly
and for this purpose the. immigration warrant of arrest.
and deportatio: Was probably the“best instrument,

.. Se: Mrs. Katzenbsch asked Mr. Foley to check iate -
this and Hr. Foley will in turn contact Mr. Houston,
Mr. Houston will in turn discuss the problem with CIA-—
Office of Security officials to get the background-of
their liaison with the INS on these matters. iueiuatt

6. Mr. Helus thanked. Mr. Katzenbach for his assistance
and wo departed amid sone jovial banter with respect to
“The Spy Who Came in Fros the Cold" about what we expected
to happen to him when he started to clisb aver that "wali"

a bie SUBJECT: .— . Parole Status of Defectors

:. 1, On 2 April 1964 we had a discussion with the Department —*
of Justice or the status of aliens whose inspection by I&NS is deferred
upon arrival at our request and who are then paroled to this Agency. *

. It was the position of the Department of Justice that we were responsible
“for taking any action necessary to carry out the terms of the parole.

2, As you know,. a basic parole agreement was executed by the

Attorney General and the DCI on 10 February 1955. After setting up
:, conditions for authorizing parole in any one case, the.agreement states: i
" “After parole of such aliens, the Central Intelligence Agency will assume ..*
responsibility for care, supervision and control of a.kind and degree it ‘1

believes consistent with the internal Security needs of the United States

during continuance of their parole status. This means that the

responsible Agency officials must take the minimum action necessary —

- to protect the internal security needs of the United States. The word
“minimum" is not necessarily a limitation. It merely means that good
judgment must be used as to what kind and degree of action is necessary,’

aay

3. The agreement further provides that upon-completion of the
parolee's intelligence or operational purposes in the United States or if
internal security reasons so require, the alien will be removed from
this country through arrangements made by the Agency and, in such a
case, the A; Will infornr ‘vice in advance of each proposed’
