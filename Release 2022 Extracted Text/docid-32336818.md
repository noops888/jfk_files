This letter advised that a controlled source in Cuba

reported information which he received June 29, 1960 from a

close associate of his in frequent contact with Comandante

WILLIAM A. MORGAN, Director of Restocking Rivers, Cuban Ministry

of Agriculture. The source evaluation shown is that of sub-

"About 19 June 1960, MORGAN held a meeting

in his home with a group of five persons. Comandante

ELOY GUTIERREZ MENOYO was the only one of the group

identified by name; one other was identified as a

Naval Warrant Officer. The group, described as

members of the "Escambray Group'

and said by sub-

source to be pledged against Communism, agreed that

FIDEL CASTRO and his government are Communist. The

group plotted an anti-CASTRO revolt at the meeting

but sub-source reported no firm date for the revolt.

MORGAN said that the time for revolt would be in about

six to twelve weeks and for that reason he refused

an offer from an unidentified Cuban Army Officer of

keys to a warehouse which contains arms, ammunition,

The letter indicated that the following information

The letter continued:

"Prior to 31 August 1960, MORGAN stated that the

350 to 400 deserters in the Sierra de Santiago, Cuba,

are there due to the anti-Communist sentiment which is

the result of the intense Communist activities in

Las Villas, Camaguey, and Oriente Provinces.

The

presenceof these deserters in the Sierra de Santiago

caused CASTRO to replace the Regimental Commander in

Trinidad; to recall one thousand militiamen from the

area; and to threaten drastic action if the counter-

revolutionaries do not surrender soon. In the counter-

revolution, the chiefs will be Comandante GUTIERREL

MENOYO, who has returned from Spain; (FNU) ASCENSIO,

eventually cause the defection of one-half the CASTRO

army before the beginning of the counter-attack or the
