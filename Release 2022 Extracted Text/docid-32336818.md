This letter was signed by R. D. ALBRO,-Colonel, GS,
chief, Collection Division. fe

This letter advised that a controlled source in Cuba
reported information which he received June 29, 1960 from a
close associate of his in frequent contact with Comandante
WILLIAM A. MORGAN, Director of Restocking Rivers, Cuban Ministry
of Agriculture. The source evaluation shown is that of sub-

source. (>

"About 19 June 1960, MORGAN held a meeting
in his home with a group of five persons. Comandante
ELOY GUTIERREZ MENOYO was the only one of the group
identified by name; one other was identified as a
Naval Warrant Officer. The group, described as
members of the “Escambray Group' and said by sub-
source to be pledged against Communism, agreed that
FIDEL CASTRO and his government are Communist. The
group plotted an anti-CASTRO revolt at the meeting
but sub-source reported no firm date for the revolt.
MORGAN said that the time for revolt would be in about
six to twelve weeks and for that reason he refused
an offer from an unidentified Cuban Army Officer of
keys to a warehouse which contains arms, ammunition,
and trucks. I is not known whether the army officer (Fa.

"was present at the meeting or whether the offer

had been made at an earlier time. In their planning,
the group discussed guerrilla warfare but in the

end favored a plan to attack within the cities and
to seize leaders, armed posts, and communication
centers. The 'Escambray Group' believes that a

CASTRO's downfall within ninety aed from date of

The letter indicated that the following information
was received from the controlled source in Cuba who had occasional
personal contact with MORGAN. On August 31, 1960, MORGAN
said that on the day that the counterrevolution begins in
Cuba, he and his wife will travel to the Escambray hills, while
his two infant children, accompanied by MORGAN's wife's
sister, will seek asylum in te Latin American Embassy, from
vu where they wll seék permission to trayel to Toledo, the city of
residence of MORGAN's parents. MORGAN said that. any attempt by
MORGAN to seek asylum or to rebel, would invoke CASTRO's ~
threat against his life, and he added that there were CASTRO
spies within his, MORGAN's, group. (The source evaluation listed
for this was D-6). )
