Mad-

I must say I think Ferguson is right, and
far better from standpoint US-Moreecen
relations just to let matter drift away, AmI
correct in deducing that main reason Mrs. Kennedy
wants publicity is because King reportedly took
this villa away from somebody to give to her.
¥ this is case, King will no doubt find seme
other way to avoid returuing villa,

6, Kennedy ts alao protected because
if og moter ever becomes public again, she
has of course already declined it,

if you agres, I'd like to clue Rabat

sconest, co poor Fergie doesn't give word to
press before we reprieve him.
