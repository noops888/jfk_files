viad-

I must say I think Fergusan is right, and

far better from standpoint US-Moroccan

relations just to let matter drill away. Ans 1

correet in deducing that main reason Mrs. Kennedy

wants publicity is because King reportedly took

this villa away from somebody to give lo hes.

If this in case, Kiag will no doubt and same

other way to avoid retursing villa.

Mrs, Kennedy in alao protected because

if house matter ever becomes public again, she

has of course already declined it.

If you agres, I'd Itke to clue Rabat

soonest, so poor Fergle doesn't give woad to

presa before we reprieve him.
