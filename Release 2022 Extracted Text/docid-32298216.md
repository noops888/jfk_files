with the rackets for many years. He stated that SHUTRUMP has

done time in the Federal Penitentiary at Milan, Michigan, on

an income tax evasion conviction.

CV I-49 advised on July 22, 1964, he had visited

FRANK MEZZATESTA, Kent, Ohio, that evening, and while there,

MEZZATESTA's nephew, ANTHONY MADAFFARE, appeared at the house,

riding a motor scooter.

I ANTHONY WAS STATEd

CV. T-49 stated the conversation again

got around to Youngstown and both MADAFFARE and NEZZATESTA

cautioned him to stay away from Youngstown. MADAFFARE stated

that over in Italy when a man has a friend, he can trust him,

but stated that in Youngstown "friend kills friend."

CV I-49 stated he learned that MADAFFARE was probably

closer to DOMINICK MOIO than was MEZZATESTA.

He stated from

their conversation, he gathered that MOIO ana MADAFFARE had

lived together and, although they did not say specifically,

he gathered it had been in Youngstown. He stated he got the

definite impression that MADAFFARE had more definite infor-

mation about MOIO's activities than did MEZZATESTA.

CV T-49 advised that MEZZATESTA in talking about the

bombing of BILLY NAPLES on July 1, 1902, stated that Mole had

been responsible and that

"they"

had ordered him to do this.

He stated he, himself, liked BILLY NAPLES, but when such a

thing was ordered, he was powerless to interfere.

MEZZATESTA

also stated that MOIO made the mistake of working for too many

factions and he would work for any group for money, and that

was what finally caused his death when it was determined that

he had "hit" some member of the "organization."

assumed they meant either CAVALLARO or VINCENT J. DE NIRO, Who

was killed July 17, 1961, while MOIO was in the employ of

BILLY NAPLES.

CV I-24 advised on July 24, 1964, that when the barbut

game operated in Youngstown on South

Avenue, and possibly. r

Struthers, Ohio, JERRY CONTI had a piece of

the game; however,

he was later cut out, apparently when CHARLES CAVALIARO shared

and was definitely out of the game when it operated in Campbell,

ohio.

Re:

DOMINICK MOIO - DECEASED

CV T-1 advised on June 29, 1964, that in conversation

on the night of June 28, 1964, he learned from his source that

DOMINICK MOIO was Involved in both the BILLY NAPLES and the

CAVALLAR bombing murders, but did not know by whom he was

employed. He stated MOIO was killed because he "knew too much,"

and whoever was involved was afraid of him. CV T-l also stated

his source told him that MOIO was allegedly a brother-in-law of

PAT FERRUCCIO of Canton, Ohio, and it was behind FERRUCCIO's

club in Canton that MOIO was killed, and the body placed in the

trunk of his car and driven to a rural section outside of Canton

where It was recovered on September 3, 1963.

the former girlfriend of DOMINICK MOIO, had visited him recently

on two occasions. On one of these occasions, he stated she was

about to tell him something regarding BILLY NAPLES, but they were

by a customer and she never completed what she was

going to say. CV T-51 stated he has not visited CONSTANTINO at

her home because her two daughters might get the wrong impression

and tell others about his visit. CV T-51 agreed that CONSTANTINO

would undoubtedly have much information about the activities of

MOTO and his relations with BILLY and JOEY NAPLES.

CV T-51 pointed out that as he had previously reported,

CONSTANTINO had told him that she believed the NAPLEs brothers

were responsible for MOIO's death and she had warned MOIO prior

to his death to stay away from the NAPLES.

CV T-51 stated

CONSTANTINO never explained to him why she was so afraid of

the NAPLES.

CV T-51 also stated that only a short time after MOIO

met CONSTANTINO, MOIO was working behind the bar.

He stated

that at that time a Youngstown police officer named BILLY KELLY

was also a frequent visitor at the tavern operated by CONSTANTINO

and probably became as well acquainted with MOIO as did CV I-51.

He stated that on one occasion BILLY KELLY approached him with

a request that he, CV T-51, borrow $5,000 from MOIO and that

KELLY and he would then start their own business. He recalled

that subsequent to MOIO's death he mentioned this to KELLY,

whose remark was, "It is too bad we didn't borrow the money

because now we wouldn't have to pay it back."

It was pointed out to cv T-51 that at the time. of

BILLY NAPLES! death, he must have had some conversation with

both MOIO and CONSTANTINO regarding NAPLES! death, since he was

aware of the friendship between MOIO and NAPLES.

he stated that

if there was any conversation, he does not now recal. what was

said.

CV I-51 advised that recently LOU TORMA (phortetic)

(LOUIS LE PORES), who was employed by the NAPhas brothers as

a repairman in the operation of the United Music Company, had

contacted him to buy some electronic parts. TORMA appeared

accompanied by an individual whom he described as short,

wearing a hat and glasses, and who it would appear was probably

PAUL HOLOVATICH who is associated with the NAPLES brothers in

the Center Sandwich Shop operation. ' He stated he inquired of

were being bothered by the local police and the

FORmA as to how business was going, and ToM rellederdis."

At this point, the individual belleved to be HoLovalich reminded

TORMA of the time he stopped the "federals" with his car.

HOLOVATICH then terminated his statement with "those s-- b--."

He stated he does not

know HOLOVATICh.

CV T-51 advised that in 1957, PAUL CLAUTTI of Youngs-

town and

CAVALLARO were partners in a trucking company for about

three or four months. CAVALIARO put up most of the money ano

they had three or four dump trucks which they used to haul gravel

from Pennsylvania to Liberty Township, Ohio, north of Youngstown,

where a sewer line was being installed. CV I-51 stated that

because of the Inexperienced truck drivers whom they employed,

one of whom wrecked the truck, the business was not successful

and folded:

It was pointed out to Cv T-51 of the FBI's intense

interest in solving the CAVALIARO bombing.

He stated he was

very interested in determining who was responsible for the killing

and added he belleved ANGELINE CONSTANTINO had considerable Infor-

mation regarding MOIO's activities.

He stated he did not know

personally whether MOIO was involved in the CAVALIARO k11ling,

RE:

VINCENT J. DE NIRO

(Bombing-Murder VIctim 7/17/61

CV T-60 was again questioned on March 26, 1964,

regarding information he had previously furnished regarding

the bombing death of VINCENT J. DE NIRO at Youngstown (July 17,

1961). He stated that several days before the contaet,

FRANK LENTINE, Youngstown burglar, had mentioned to him a

possible "house score" where a considerable amount of cash

belonging to the late DE NIRO was supposed to have been kept.

LENTINE stated that the residence Involved is the present

residence of the parents of DE NIRO and where his brother,

LOUIS DE NIRO,

resides. According to LENTINE,

when DE NIRO

was alive he always had a barber come to his home. One occasion,

according to this barber, he was at DE NIRO's home and arter

giving him a hair cut, DENIRO did not have any cash on him.

This barber stated he

usually was paid $10 or $20 for each

visit.

On this particular occasion, DE NIRO, after noticing he had no

cash,

then pressed a button which opened a door leading to the

attic.

DE NIRO went into the attic and came down and gave the

barber a $10 bill.

LENTINE's belief was that the attle 1s the

location of DE NIRO's money.

Cv T-60 stated that

shot at several times, but these instances were never reported

to the police. He stated LENTINE made reference to several

occasions that "they" really "ahly. "to do away with de NIRo,

but never further identified

LENTINE also

stated that "they" just prior to the death of DE NIRO, had followed

his activities very closely and knew that DE NIRO waS

using three

different autos since he was aware that someone was trying to

k1ll him. LENTINE further stated that at thetime of his death,

all three cars had actually been wired for explosives and that

on the Sunday evening that DE NIRO was killed, the car that he

actually used and was blown up in, a short time before, had been

driven by EDITH MAGNOLIA'S (DE NIRO's girlfriend) son,

NICK, who

parked it on Market Street.

CV T-60 stated that when this car was wired with the

explosives, a truck was pulled up to the area and a man with a

machine gun was stationed inside the truck to protect the

Individuals that placed the explosives in the car.

CV T-60 stated he did not ask LENTINE who was behind

the killing of DE NIRO since he did not want to make his interest

known since this was a subjeet that 1s not generally discussed.

son of PAUL ROMEO of Campbell; one FRANK

STRINGSE, WK, *STRINGY" (phonetie) of Cleveland of Fittsburgh

and SAM WOSOKI,

former Pittsburgh bondsman, are now associated

together writing performance bonds for area contractors.

He

stated that ROMEO is taking GUERRIERI around to the various

contractors soliciting business.

He stated the deal is for the

contractor to put up the sum of $1,000 with GUERRIERI when he bids

the Job, and if a contract is let to that particular contractor,

then the fee is 2 percent of the contract,

up to one-half million

dollars.

Anything over this figure the contractor must put up

office is next door to GUERRIERI's other company,

AAA Bonding

Agency, 401 Central Tower, Youngstown, phone RI 7-6230.

CV T-81 stated that to date GUERRIERI has solicited one

customer, one ART MARINELLI.

He was questioned as to the going

legitimate rate for these performance bonds, and he advised that the

rate 1s one-half percent. The reason they sell at 2 percent,

according to ev T-81, is that these contractors, because of

reputation, cannot purchase performance bonds from ethieal bonding

or surety companies.

He further stated that thehead of the Continental

Surety Company Is one ALLEN ROSS of Pittsburgh. He was questioned

as to whether or not he may be identical with AL ZETD and he

stated he does not know for sure, but thought possibly they may

be one and the same.

On August 11, 1964, CV T-82 advised that the deal to

sell the Chez Paree Club to PETRELLA and LATONE actually fell

through because they could not gather enough money to close the

deal. He advised that this past week he was contacted by PETRELLA

and LATONE and they attempted to collect the $500 down payment

they had made on the deal and he stated he advised them he would

attempt pa eater

return the $500 if they would pay him the $600 which represented

the costs incurred by him in attempting to close the deal. He

stated PETRELLA became angry and threatened him that he would

do $5,000 damage to his property if he did not come up with the

take off his coat and roll up his

sleeves and they would fight It

out right then ana there.

He also asked PETRELLA 1f he was

threatening him, and PETRELLA told him he was not. PETRELLA

theo told on that he would have to report evans' because

i to return

the $500 to JASPER JOSEPH AIELIO, JR., aka.,

because the

$500 was actually AIELLO's money and CV T-82 told PETRELLA that he

CV T-49 advised on July 22, 1964, he had visited

FRANK MEZZATESTA,

Kent, Ohio, that evening, and while there,

MEZZATESTA's nephew, ANTHONY MADAFFARE, appeared at the house,

riding a motor scooter. CV T-49 stated the conversation again

got around to Youngstown and both MADAFFARE and MEZZATESTA

cautioned him to stay away from Youngstown. MADAFFARE stated

that over in Italy when a man has a friend, he can trust him,

but stated that In Youngstown "friend kills friend."

CV T-49 stated he learned that MADAFFARE was probably

closer to DOMINICK MOIO than was MEZZATESTA.

He stated from

their conversation, he gathered that MOIO and MADAFFARE had

lived together and, although they did not say specifically,

he gathered it had been In Youngstown.

He stated he got the

definite Impression that MADAFFARE had more definite infor-

mation about MOIO's activities than did MEZZATESTA.

CV I-49 advised that MEZZATESTA in talking about the

bombing of BILLY NAPLES on July 1, 1962, stated that MOIO had

been responsible and that

"they" had ordered him to do this.

He stated he, himself, liked BILLY NAPLES, but when such a

thing was ordered, he was powerless to interfere.

MEZZATESTA

also stated that Molo made

factions and he would work for any group for money, and that

was what finally caused his death when it was determined that

he had "hit" some member of the "organization."

was killed July 17, 1961, while MOIO was in the employ of

CV I-24 advised on July 24, 1964, that when the barbut

game operated in Youngstown on South

Avenue, and possibly in

struthers, Onio, JERRY CONtI had a piece of

the game; however,

he was later cut out, apparently when CHARLES CAVALLARO shared

and was definitely out of the game when it operated in Campbell,

Ohio.

Re:

DOMINICK MOIO - DECEASED

CV T-1 advised on June 29, 1964, that in conversation

on the night of June 28, 1964, he learned from his source that

DOMINICK MOIO was Involved In

both the BILLY NAPLES and the

CAVALIARO bombing murders, but did not know by whom he was

and whoever was Involved was afraid of him. CV T-l also stated

his source told him that MOIO was allegedly a brother-in-law of

PAT FERRUCCIO of Canton, Ohio,

and it was behind FERRUCCIO's

club in Canton that MOID was killed, and the body placed in the

trunk of his car and driven to a rural section outside of Canton

where it was recovered on September 3, 1963.

CV T-51 stated on July 1, 1964, that ANGELINE CONSTANTINO,

the former girlfriend of DOMINICK MOIO, had visited him recently

on two occasions. On one of these occasions, he stated she was

about to tell him something regarding BILLY NAPLES, but they were

interrupted by a customer and she never completed what she was

going to say..

CV. T-51 stated he has not visited CONSTANTINO at

her home because her two daughters might get the wrong impression

and tell others about his visit. CV T-51 agreed that CONSTANTINO

would undoubtedly have much information about the activities of

MOIO and his relations with BILLY and JOEY NAPLES.

CONSTANTINO had told him that she belleved the NAPLES brothers

were responsible for MOIO's death and she had warned Nolo prior

to his death to stay away from the NAPLES.. CV T-51 stated

CONSTANTINO never explained to him why she was so afraid of

the NAPLES.

CV T-51 also stated that only a short time after MOIO

met CONSTANTINO, MOIO was working behind the bar. He stated

that at that time a Youngstown police officer named BILLY KELLY

was also a frequent visitor at the tavern operated by CONSTANIINO

and probably became as well acquainted with MOIl as did CV T-51.

He stated that on one occasion BILLY KELLY approached him with

a request that he, CV T-51, borrow $5,000 from MOIO and that

KELLY and he would then start their own business. He recalled

that subsequent to MOIO's death he mentioned this to KELLY,

whose remark was, "It is too bad we didn't borrow the money

because now we wouldn't have to pay it back."

It was pointed out to CV T-51 that at the time of

BILLY NAPLES! death, he must have had some conversation with

both MOIO and CONSTANTINO regarding NAPLES! death, since he was

aware of the friendship between MOIO and NAPLES.

He/stated that

It there was any conversation, he does not now recall what was

said.

CV I-51 advised that recently LOU TORMA (phoretic)

(LOUIS LE PORIS), who was employed by the NAPLES brothers as

a repairman in the operation of the United Music Company, had

contacted him to buy some electronic parts.

TORNA appeared

accompanied by an individual whom he described as short,

wearing a hat and glasses, and who it would appear was probably

PAUL HOLOVATICH who is associated with the NAPLES brothers in

the Center Sandwich Shop operation. ' He stated he inguired of

TORMA as to how business was going, and TorMA reprederals."

being bothered by the local police and the

At this point, the individual belleved to be HOLOVATICH reminded

TORMA of the time he stopped the "federals" with his car.

HOLOVATICH then terminated his statement with "those s-- b--."

He stated he does not know HOLOVATICH.

CV T-51 advised that in 1957, PAUL CLAUTTI of Youngs-

town and CAVALLARO were partners in a trucking company for about

three or four months.

CAVALLArO put up most of the money and

they had three or four dump trucks which they used to haul gratel

from Pennsylvania to Liberty Township, Ohio, north of Youngstown,

where a sewer line was being installed. CV T-51 stated that

because of the inexperienced truck drivers whom they employed,

one of whom wrecked the

truck, the business was not successful

and folded.

It was pointed out to Cv I-51 of the FBI's intense

Interest in solving the CAVALLARO bombing. He stated he was

very interested In determining who was responsible for the killing

and added he believed ANGELINE CONSTANTINO had considerable Infor-

mation regarding MOIO's activities.

He stated he did not know

personally whether MOIO was Involved in the CAVALLARO k1lling,
