with the rackets for many years. He stated that SHUTRUMP has
done time in the Federal Penitentiary at Milan, Michigan,. on
an income tax evasion. conviction.

CV T-49 advised on July 22, 1964, he had visited
FRANK MEZZATESTA, Kent, Ohio, that evening; and while there,
MEZZATESTA's nephew, ANTHONY MADAFFARE, appeared at the house,
riding a motor scooter. CV, T-49 stated the conversation again
got around to Youngstown and both MADAFFARE and MEZZATESTA
cautioned him to stay away from Youngstown. MADAFFARE stated
that over in Italy when a man has a friend, he can trust him,
but stated that in Youngstown "friend kills friend."

(
i
i

cv T-49 stated he learned that MADAFFARE was probably
closer to DOMINICK MOLO than was MEZZATESTA. He stated from
their conversation; he gathered that MOIO and MADAFFARE had \
lived together and, although they did not say specifically,
. he gathered it had been in Youngstown. He stated he got the
definite impression that MADAFFARE had more definite infor-
mation about MOIO's activities than did MEZZATESTA.

CV T-49 advised that MEZZATESTA in talking about the
bombing of BILIEY NAPLES on July 1, 1962, stated that. MOIO had
been responsible and that "they" had ordered him to do this.
He stated he, himself, liked BILLY NAPLES, but when sucha
thing was ordered, he was powerless to interfere. MEZZATESTA
also stated that MOIO made the mistake of working for too many
factions and he would work for any group for money, and that
was what finally caused his death when it was determined that
he had "hit": some member of the "organization."

Cv T-49 stated nei ther MEZZATESTA nor MADAFFARE men-
tioned who MOIO had "hit" from the "organization," but he
assumed they meant either CAVALLARO or VINCENT J. DE NIRO, who
was killed July 17, 1961, while MOIO was in the employ of
BILLY NAPLES.

CV T-24 advised on July 24, 1964, that when the barbut
game operated in Youngstown on South Avenue, and possibly in ji
Struthers, Ohio, JERRY CONTI had a piece of the game; however, |
he was later cut out, apparently when CHARLES CAVALLARO shared
and was definitely out of the game when it operated in. Campbell,
Ohio.

Re:: -DOMINICK MOIO - DECEASED

CV T-1 advised on June 29, 1964, that in conversation
on the night of June 28, 1964, he learned from’his source that
DOMINICK MOIO was involved in’ both. the BILLY NAPLES and the
CAVALLARO bombing. murders, but did not know by whom he was ‘
employed. He stated MOIO was killed because he "Imew too much,"
and whoever was. involved was afraid of him. CV T-1 also. stated
his source told him that MOIO was allegedly a brother-in-law of
PAT FERRUCCIO of Canton, Ohio, and it was. behind FERRUCCIO's
elub in Canton that MOIO was killed, and the body placed in the
trunk of his' car and driven to a. rural section. outside of Canton
where it was’ recovered.on September 3, 1963.

CV T-51 stated on July 1, 1964, that ANGELINE CONSTANTINO,

the former girlfriend of DOMINICK MOIO, -+had visited him recently

on two.occasions. On one of these occasions, he stated she was
about to tell him something regarding BILLY NAPLES, but they were
interrupted by a customer and she never completed what she was
going to say. CV T-51 stated he has not visited CONSTANTINO at

her home because her two daughters might get the wrong impression
and tell others. about: his visit. CV T-51 agreed that CONSTANTINO
would undoubtedly have much information.about the activities of
MOLO.and his relations with BILLY and JOEY NAPLES.

CV T-51 pointed out that as he had previously reported,
CONSTANTINO had told him that she believed the NAPLES brothers
were responsible for MOIO's death and she had warned MOIO prior
to his death to stay away from the NAPLES. CV T-51 stated
CONSTANTINO never explained to him why she was so afraid of
the NAPLES.

CV T-51 also stated that only a short time after MOIO
met CONSTANTINO, MOIO was working behind the bar, He stated
that at that time a Youngstowm police officer named BILLY.
was also a frequent visitor at the tavern operated by CONSTANTINO
and probably became as well acquainted with MOIO as did CV T-51.
He stated that on one occasion BILLY KELLY approached him with
a@ request that he, CV T-51, borrow $5,000 from MOIO and that
KELLY and he would then start their own business. He recalled
that subsequent to MOIO's death he mentioned this to KELLY,

whose remark was, "It is too bad we didn't borrow the money
because now we wouldn't have to pay it back."

It was pointed out to CV T-51 that at the time, of
BILLY NAPLES' death, he must have had some. conversation with
both MOIO and CONSTANTINO regarding NAPLES' death, singe. he was
aware of the friendship. between’ MOIO and NAPLES. -He/stated that
if there was any conversation, he does not now recall what was
said.

: CV £-51 advised that recently LOU TORMA: (phorietic)
(LOUIS LE. PORIS), who was employed by the NAPLES brothers as
a repairman in the operation of the United Music Company, had
contacted him to buy some electronic parts. TORMA appqared
“accompanied by an individual whom he described as short,
wearing a het and glasses, and who it would appear was probably
PAUL HOLOVATICH who is associated with the NAPLES. brothers in
the Center Sandwich Shop operation. ' He stated he inquired of
TORMA.as to how business was going, and TORMA re: lied they
were being bothered by the local police and the 'federals."
At this point, the individual believed to be HOLOVATICH reminded
TORMA of the time he stopped the "federals" with his car.
HOLOVATICH ‘then terminated his statement with "those s-- b<-."
He stated he does not know HOLOVATICH.

CV T-51 advised that in 1957, PAUL CLAUTTI of Youngs~
town and CAVALLARO were partners in a trucking company for about
three or four months.. CAVALLARO: put up most of the money. and |:
they had three or four dump trucks which they used to haul gravel
from. Pennsylvania to. Liberty Township, Ohio, north of Youngstown,
where a sewer line was being installed. cV T-51 stated that-
because of the inexperienced truck drivers whom. they employed,
one ras Lar wrecked the truck, the business. was not successful
and. folded.

It was pointed out to CV T-51 of the FBI's intense
interest in solving the CAVALLARO bombing. He stated he was
very interested in determining who was ‘responsible for the killing
and added he believed ANGELINE CONSTANTINO had considerable infor-
mation regarding MOLO's. activities. He stated he did not. mow
personally whether MOIO was involved in the CAVALLARO killing,

RE: VINCENT J. DE NIRO

(Bombing-Murder Victim 7/17/61

CV T-60 was again questioned on March 26, 1964,
regarding information he: had previously furnished regarding
the bombing death of VINCENT J. DE NIRO at Youngstown (July 17,
1961). Ge stated that several days before the contact,
FRANK LENTINE, Youngstown burglar, had mentioned to him a
possible "house score" where a considerable amount of cash
belonging to the late DE NIRO was supposed. to have been kept,
LENTINE stated that the residence involved is the present
residence of the parénts of DE NIRO and where his brother,
LOUIS DE NIRO, resides. According to LENTINE, when DE NIRO
was alive he always had a, barber come to‘his home. One occasion,
according to this barber, he was’ at DE NIRO's home and after
giving him a hair cut, DENIRO did not have. any cash on him.
This barber stated he usually was paid $10 or $20 for each visit.
On this particular. occasion, DE NIRO, after. noticing he had no
cash, then pressed a button which. opened a door leading to. the
attic. DE NIRO went into.the attic and came down and gave the
barber @ $10 bill. ‘LENTINE's belief was that the attic is the
location of DE NIRO's money.

Regarding. VINCENT..J, DE NIRO, CV T-60 stated that
ac¢ording to LENTINE, prior to DE NIRO's..death,. DE NIRO had been
shot at séveral times, but these instancés were never reported
to the police. .Hé stated LENPINE made reference to several
o¢éasions that "they" really wanted todo away With DE NIRO, .
but never furthér identifiéd "they." LENTINE also. ete

stated that. "they". just. prior-to the death of. DE NIRO, haa’ followed

his activities very closely and knew that DE NIRO was using. three
different autos since he Was aware that someone was trying to
kil] him... LENTINE further stated that. at thetime of. his death,
&ll three cars had actually been. wired for explosives.and that
on the Sunday evening that DE NIRO was-killed,.the ¢ar that he
actually used and. was. blown up in, a short time before, had been
driven by EDITH MAGNOLIA's (DE NIRO's girlfriend) son, NICK, who
parked it on Market Street. e

CV T-60 stated that when this car was wired with the
explosives, a truck was pulled up to the area and a man with a
machine gun was stationed inside the truck to protect the
individuals that placed the explosives in the car. é

CV T-60 stated he did not ask LENTINE who was behind
the killing of DE NIRO since he did not want to make his interest
known since this was a subject that is not generally discussed.

RE: "The Organization"

The Pittsburgh Office advised on March 17, 1964, that
CV T-80 advised SA JOHNS. PORTELLA on February 28, 1964, that
at Youngstown, or anywhere elsé, there is only one gambling
organization or gambling syndicate governed by Italians, He
stated that within this main body it 1s. only natural to find
people who comé from Sicily, who are called Sicilians, or
Calabrese, or people who come from Naples who call themselves
Neapolitans, etc. :

cv T-80 stated that insofar as he knows there are no
two organizations in. Youngstown, Cleveland, or elsewhere; but
there is definitely-a younger. element in almost every city striving
to take over from the older element. CV T-80 stated that even
when the younger element. gained control, big decisions are still
passed on by the older'heads in the organizations, and when. there
is a disagreement of what is to be done, you have a situation
such as the one that. errupted.in New York with the GALLO boys.

é The Cincinnati Office advised on April 16, 1964, ‘that
on March 16, 1964, CV.Ts73 advised SA E, ARTHUR RIEGE he has no
knowledge as to the identity of persons.in Steubenville, Ohio,
that are members of the Calabrese Group of the Cleveland = = ~~

present time regarding LOUIS TIBERIO, owner of the Tropics
Lounge, and allegedly involved in. ,Pookmaking activities, Through
DOMINICK MALLAMO, aka., "BIG DOM,” leader in the "Calabrese
Organization," he has learned’ that TIBERIO is not making a payoff
to MALLAMO as are other gambling operators, and for this reason,
PIRERIO could be hurt. CV T-1 stated he will endeavor to maintain
a close contact with MALLAMO in this regard, but does not
think any plans have been formulated to date to hurt TIBERIO.
He states that all of the operators in the Youngstown: area,
including NAPLES and PETER FETCHET, pay off to MALLAMO.

CV T-1 advised on May 11, 1964, that on the afternoon

brought ‘in or was not made available to , DELSANTER, as DELSANTER
stated "there should be more than five." DELSANTER also stated.
that the barbut game could not reopen as "There's too. many FBI's

CV T-81 stated on August 3, 1964,.that MARIO GUERRIERI
of Youngstown; MIKE ROMEO, son of PAUL ROMEO of Campbell; one FRANK

“STRINGESI, aka., "STRINGY" (phoneti¢) of Cleveland or Pittsburgh

and SAM WOSOKI, former pittsburgh bondsman,.are now associated
together writing performance bonds for area contractors, “He
stated that ROMEO is taking GUERRIERI around to the various
contractors soliciting business. He stated the deal is for the
eontractor to put up the sum of $1,000 with GUERRIERI when he bids
the job, and if a contract is let to that: particular contractor,

“then the fee is 2 percent of the contract, up to ‘one-half million

dollars. Anything over this figure the contractor must put up
$2,000 and then the fee is the same, 2 percent. The company is
operated under the name of Continental Surety Company and the
office is next door to GUERRIERI'S other company, AAA Bonding
Agency, 401 Central Tower, Youngstown,” phone RI.7+6230. :

CV T-81 stated. that to date GUERRIERI has solicited one
customer, one ART MARINELLI, He was questioned as to the going
legitimate rate for these. performance bonds; and he advised that the
rate 1s oné-half percent... The reason they sell at 2 percent,
according to Cv 7-81, is that these ‘contractors, because of
reputation, cannot purchase performance ponds from ethical ‘bonding
or surety companies. : "

He further stated that thehead of the Continenta}
Surety Company is one ALLEN ROSS of: Pittsburgh. He was questioned
as to whether or not he may be identical with AL ZEID and he
stated he does not know for sure, but. thought possibly. they may
be one and the same. : J ae

On August. 11,1964, CV .T-82 advised that the deal to
sell the Chez Paree Club to PETRELLA and LATONE actually fell
through because they could not. gather enough money .to:-close:.the
deal. He.advised that this past week he. was contacted. by PETRELLA
and LATONE and they attempted to collect. the. $500. down payment. .-
they had made. on the. deal and.he stated he advised them he would
return the $500 if they would pay him the $600. which représented
the costs incurred by him in attempting to. close the deal. He
stated PETRELLA became angry and threatened him that- he would
do $5,000 damage to his property if he did not come up’with -the

NW 68262 Docld:32298216 Page 12


CV 157-127

$500, and he told PETRELLA that if he wanted to fight he would

‘take off his coat and roll up his sleeves and they would fight 1t

out right then and there. He also asked PETRELLA if he was.
threatening him, and PETRELLA told:him he was'not. | PETRELLA

also told him that he would have to report CV T-82's refusal to return
the $500 to JASPER JOSEPH AIELIO, JR., aka., "RATS," because the

$500 was actually AIELLO's money and CV T-82 told PETRELLA that he
did not care who he reported it to, but if anything happened to him
er his property he would hold PETRELLA personally responsible.

J. DE NIRO, bombing murder victim at Youngstown, July 17, 1961,
operated a crap -game in a building next to the Pines Nite Club
on Route 422, east of Youngstown, DITTA was working at the game.
He stated DITTA just stood around and loaned money to anyone
who went broké in the game. He stated that he, himself, went
broke one night and DITTA loaned him $400, and he paid DITTA
back the following evening. He stated he always assumed that
DITTA at that time was on DE NIRO's payroll. He also recalled
from the past that DITTA was a good friend of CAVALLARO.

: CV T-62 advised on June 22, 1964, when asked if he
knew NICK. DITTA, that he definitely knew DITTA and that he
frequently came into the “A" Lounge- while it was in operation
in Youngstown. CV T-62 stated he heard DITTA was a killer from
Detroit, but knew little of his activities in Youngstown or
elsewhere. He said he felt sure that DITTA was a close friend
of "FATS" AIELLO and DICK STEWART.

CV T-61 advised on July 14, 1964, he had been talking
to MIKE ROMEO of Youngstown, brother of PAUL ROMEO whom he.
described.as a "Mafia member." He stated that MIKE told him
that Mrs. DE NIRO, mother of slain Youngstown racketeer VINCENT
J. DE NIRO, had paid a sum of money to DOMINICK MOIO (deceased).
to avenge the death of her son. He stated that MIKE told him
that MOIO came to Mrs. DE NIRO with the proposition. ¢V T-61
stated that in this particular instance, in. his opinion, MOIO
was simply being an opportunist since he had probably already
received the contract from the "Cleveland syndicate" to avenge
DE NIRO's death. He stated that subsequently MOIO did activel;
participate in the bombing death of BILLY NAPLES (July 1, 1962
who the syndicate felt was responsible for the bombing. death
of DE NIRO (July .17, 1961). He reiterated the fact that sub-
sequently MOIO was responsible for and actively participated
in‘the bombing death of CHARLES. CAVALLARO and his son, for ‘the
NAPLES brothers, JOEY and JIMMY, and that MOIO was subsequently
eliminated by. the "Cleveland syndicate" for his participation
in the CAVALLARO bombing.

: CV T-67 advised on July 15, 1964, that he did not know
what the connection between VICTOR SHUTRUMP, Youngstown building
contractor, and NICK DITTA, Detroit hoodlum might be. He stated
that DITTA at one time lived in Youngstown and has been connected

NW 68262 Docld:32298216 Page 15


with the rackets for many years. He stated that SHUTRUMP has
done time in. the Federal Penitentiary at Milan, Michigan, on
an income tax evasion. conviction. :

cV T-49 advised on July 22, 1964, he had visited
FRANK MEZZATESTA, Kent, Ohio, that evening, and while there,
MEZZATESTA's nephew, ANTHONY MADAFFARE, appeared at the house,
riding a motor scooter, CV T-49 stated the conversation again
got around to Youngstown and both MADAFFARE and MEZZATESTA
cautioned him to stay away from Youngstown. MADAFFARE stated
that over in Italy when a man has a friend, he can trust him,
but stated that in Youngstown "friend kills friend."

cv T-49 stated he learned that MADAFFARE was probably
closer to DOMINICK MOIO than was MEZZATESTA, He stated from
their conversation, he gathered that MOIO and MADAFFARE had
lived together and, although they did not say specifically,
he gathered it had been in Youngstown. He stated he got the
definite impression that MADAFFARE had more. definite infor-
mation about MOIO's activities than did MEZZATESTA.

. CV T-49 advised that MEZZATESTA in talking about the
bombing of BILLY NAPLES on July 1, 1962, stated that MOIO had
been responsible and that "they" had ordered him to do this.
He stated he, himself, liked BILLY NAPLES, but when such a
thing was ordered, he was powerless to interfere. MEZZATESTA
also stated that MOIO made the mistake of working for too many
factions and he would work for any group for money, and that
was what finally caused his death when it was determined that
he had "hit" some member of the "organization."

ev T-49 stated nel ther MEZZATESTA nor MADAFFARE men-
tioned who MOIO had "hit" from the "organization," but he
assumed they meant either CAVALLARO or VINCENT J. DE NIRO, who
was killed July 17, 1961, while MOTO was in the employ of
BILLY NAPLES.

CV T-24 advised on July 24, 1964, that when the barbut
game operated in Youngstown on South Avenue, and possibly in
Struthers, Ohio, JERRY CONTI had a piece of the game; however,
he was later cut out, apparently when CHARLES CAVALLARO shared
and was definitely out of the game when it operated in Campbell,
Ohio.

Re: _DOMINICK MOIO -- DECEASED

CV T-1 advised on June 29, 1964, that in conversation
on the night of June 28,.1964, he learned from‘his source that
_ DOMINICK MOIO was involved in both the BILLY NAPLES and the
CAVALLARO bombing murders, but did not know by. whom he was
employed. He stated: MOIO was killed because he "Imew too much,”
and whoever was. involved was afraid of him, CV T-1 also. stated
his. source told him that MOIO was allegedly a brother-in-law of
PAT FERRUCCIO of Canton, Ohio, and it was. behind FERRUCCIO's
club in Canton that MOIO was killed, and the body placed in the.
trunk of his’ car and driven to a rural section. outside of Canton.
Where it was recovered on September 3, 1963.

CV T-51 stated on July 1, 1964, that ANGELINE CONSTANTINO,

the former girlfriend of DOMINICK MOIO,-had visited him recently
on. two occasions. On one of these occasions, he stated. she was
about to tell him something regarding BILLY NAPLES, but they were
interrupted by a customer and she never completed what she was
going to say. CV. T-51 stated he has not visited CONSTANTINO at
her home because her two daughters might get the wrong impression
and tell others about his visit. CV T-51 agreed that CONSTANTINO
would undoubtedly have much information about the activities of
MOIO.and his relations with BILLY and JOEY NAPLES.

Cv T-51 pointed out that as he had previously reported,
CONSTANTINO had told him that she believed the. NAPLES brothers
were responsible for MOIO's death and she had warned MOIO prior
to his death to stay away from the NAPLES.. CV T-51 stated
CONSTANTINO never explained to him why she was so afraid-of
the NAPLES.

CV T-51 also stated that only a short time after MOTO
met CONSTANTINO, MOIO was working behind the bar. He stated
that at that time a Youngstown police officer named BILLY. KELLY
was also a frequent visitor at the tavern operated by CONSTANTINO
and probably became as well acquainted with MOIO as did CV T-51,
He: stated that on one occasion BILLY KELLY approached him with
a request that he, CV T-51, borrow. $5,000 from MOIO and that
KELLY and he would then start. their own business. He recalled
that subsequent to MOIO's death he mentioned this to KELLY,

| NW 68262 Docld:32298216 Page 17



whose remark was, "It is too bad we didn't borrow the money
because now we wouldn't have to pay it back."

_It was pointed out to CV T-51 that at the time. of.
BILLY NAPLES' death, he must have had some conversation with
_both MOLO and CONSTANTINO regarding NAPLES! death, singe he was
aware of the friendship between’ MOIO and NAPLES. -Hé/stated that
if there was any conversation, he does not now recall what. was
said.

cv rs advised that recently LOU TORMA (phorietic)
(LOUIS LE PORIS), who was employed by the NAPLES brothers as

a repairman in the operation of the United Music Comp: > had
-gontacted him to buy some electronic parts. TORMA appeared
accompanied by an indtvidual whom he described as short,

wearing a het and glasses, and who it would appear was iprobably
PAUL HOLOVATICH who is associated with the NAPLES brothers. in
the Genter Sandwich Shop operation. ! He stated he inquired of
TORMA as to how business was going, and TORMA replied hey

were being bothered by the local police and the "federdls."

At this point, the individual believed to. be HOLOVATICH reminded
TORMA of the time he stopped the "federals" with his car,
HOLOVATICH then terminated his statement with "those s-- b--."
He stated he does not know HOLOVATICH.

CV T-51 advised that in 1957, PAUL CLAUTTI of Youngs-
town and CAVALLARO were partners in a trucking company for about
three or four months, CAVALLARO put up most of the money and .:.
they had three or four dump trucks which they used to haul gravel
from Pennsylvania to Liberty Township, Ohio, north of Youngstown; .
where a sewer line was being installed. CV T-51 stated that
because of the inexperienced truck. drivers whom they employed
oe whom wrecked the truck, the business. was. not successful,
and folded.

It was pointed out to CV T-51 of the FBI's. intense
interest in solving the CAVALLARO bombing. He stated he was
very interested in determining who was responsible for the. killing
and added he believed ANGELINE CONSTANTINO had considerable infor-
mation regarding MOLO's activities. He stated he did not. know
personally whether MOIO was involved in the CAVALLARO killing,.
