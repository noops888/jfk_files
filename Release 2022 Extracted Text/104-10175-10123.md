1. You will remember that we were able to provide some
advice on precautions against kidnapping to key members of the
Arerican Chamber of Commerce which resulted in ers reer of:
gratitude froz those who knew the source. (See, fal 41,286 of
16 November 1971.) Now, [K JACETONE-1 tells me, police of the
Distrito Federal have incréased patrol activities around some
U.S. firms, on the basis of supposed information that. there are
threats against,these firms or that someone plans to “do something"
against then. if CETONE-1 p22e74 me a pamphlet picked up during
the demonstration on 17°May of which I attach a cop: AOU Gad
see from this why the businessmen might be disturbe: the anti-
-2,U:S.-business thene is secondary, in my opinion, and so I told

CETON to the opposition's primary target, the GOM. Also,
‘told him, we have no recent or speci:ic information of any
group’s planning anything against U.S. firms. (We shall check
with] RBGLACTER-S to see if he has anything.)

2. Biicmose- askéd me if we had anything on plant pro-
tection which he couid circulate to the membership in the same
way he did our other production. This would be a pamphlet or a
series of suggestions as to how a store or factory or office
could take precautions against bomb throwing, bonb plantang,
incendiaries, and the like (That is, it need not deai with
other aspects of security 3nst theft ard burglarly but with
Tupamaro-style attacks against facilities.) We don't have any-
thing of the sort on hand here and we don't have anyone Locally
expert in this. It seems to us the sort of thing wiich WOBONE
might be able to produce or to get from someone such as the New.
York City Police. You probably have better ideas. If you send
us a study, let us know what security might be involved :
SKBACETONE-i took my composition and used it literally.

3. I always feel a bit defensive about these requests:
the easy way would be to tell them to go take care of this
themselves. It still seems to me that we can earn or keep
some good will this way as.well as actually helping, perhaps,
to prevent unpleasantness. I hope you can do this without too
much trouble but I do think it is vorth some. Obviously, the
group ouch appreciated their lunch with you early this month
and this does help out the Stationys work.
