2022 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992

4-37098664792

21 October 1970

MEMORANDUM FOR: AC/MH/COG

SUBJECT

: Release of AMCALL-1

1. The negotiation for AMCALL-l's release was completed

by AMECRU-1 on 26 August and $120,000 ransom was paid to the

Cuban negotiator in Paris at that time. $70,000 of the ransou

was provided by the Agency and the $50,000 balance was paid

by representatives of the Catholic Church. AMECRU-1 anticipated

AMCALL-1's release would be effected within two months from the

time the negotiation was completed. If the Cubans meet this

tentative time schedule, AMCALL-1 should arrive In Madrid by

the last week of October.

2. Since the Cuban Government nas been unpredictable as

to the actual date of release in other cases of ransomed prisoners,

there would appear to be no cause for alarm that nothing further

has been heard about-AMCALL-l's release. Although AMSIGH-2 was

released within one month of the time his ransom was paid, AMRIPE-2

was not released for two months. The Cuban Government demonstrated

its good faith in these negotiations by refunding the AMPANIC-7

ransom but they have consistently refused to set a definite time

table for release of any prisoner which, they insist, Is dictated

by individual circumstances and internal conditions at a specific

time.
