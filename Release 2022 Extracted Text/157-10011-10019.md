Mr. Breckinridge. Well, formerly by Mr-Colby's

That was the judgment of the people who intended to

Senator Schweiker. Whether he knew it, in view of the

fact that he had a criminal record and the Agency hired him, how

could he not know that he was being retained on that asset basis!

What other assets did they have?

I think that the discussicn is more public than it is an

issue that is raised within the Agency, The Agency’, operating

overseas, violates the laws of the country on occasion in which

it operates. It recruits people to give information on their

the following; this is under the heading April 1962:

"Edwards recalls Harvey contacting him in April and

asking to be put in touch with Roselli. Edwards said that

he verified Helms'approval and then made the arrangements.

Harvey states that he briefed Helms before his first meeting

with Roselli, explaining its purpose, and he also reported to

Helms the result of his meeting with Roselli. Harvey states that
