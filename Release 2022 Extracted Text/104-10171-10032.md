ACTION: At your discretion i
BEF: UPGA-A212 “2 Ame 1962 \
1. A. D. Ring & Associates, consulting radio engineers in Washington, D.C.,

have recently completed a study on the effectiveness of a special audio service to
~"the Havana area. The study is attached herevith. Its conclusions are thatr

@. Operation vith tvo low-pover transmitters and 35-foot antennas vould
result in o.linited audio service along the shore line and to the rieing ground
* : fumediately inland. The signal vould be very veak and subject to interference
fro televisica stations on the adjacent channel and could be jamed vith ainieun
effort.

bd. A moderate ‘ncrease in antenna height and a small increase in pover
would increase the service only @ small amount and would not produce any
significant inprovenent or render jJamuing particularly difficult.

¢. Transmission froa a height of sane 5000 fest, using only moderate
povar (100 watts to 1 kilowatt), vould result in a significant improvement in
service in all areas and produce a signal requiring considerable effort to Jan.

| 2 As these conclusions suggest, transmissions from an airplane would be the
wost effective, vhile transmissions frou, the urface vith antennas of up to 35
in feet have Linited effectiveness. Hevertheless, Reference and other debriefings
of persona caning out of Cuba have given evidence of the apparent effectiveness
of the AMSPELL TV intrustons in the Ravana area and tndicate that they are vorth
} continuing until som: more effective medium is put into use.
