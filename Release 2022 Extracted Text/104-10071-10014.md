in Xingston that it had learned that the group planned

to sená

a small delegation to the area near the

American Embassy around noon on 8 April to see whether

they could start any disturbances.

The group had

considered stoning the imbassy, but gave up this idea..

The Black Power advocate from the United States is

reported to have commented that since the Goyeznment

of Jamaica is in complete sympatby with Dr. King, it

will be difficult to get demonstrations started...

The

police belleve it is uncertain that the group vill

take any action.

The police are expected to have a

stand-by force

to neet any adverse development, and

feel that they can control the situation.

graduatas of the University of the West Indies (UNI),

success.
