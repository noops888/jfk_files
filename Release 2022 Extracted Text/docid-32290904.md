DE TORRES related he was not close to TRAFFICANTE but claimed
that through his informant, CISCO, he would be able to secure
further information regarding TRAFFICANTE, DE TORRES stated

he originally advised Federal Narcotics Agent DAVIS of the
above information in ‘November, 1961. He said DAVIS told him
there was a $10,000.00. reward for information in the ANASTASIA
homicide, but later stated that after checking with authorities
in New York City he had ascertained the reward was only
$7,000.00.. According to Detective GRAFF, there is.no reward
‘in this case.

Detective GRAFF identified CISCO as UBALDO SANTACROCE,
New York City Police Department, Number B-474573, also known
as CISCO BOB, and interviewed him. SANTACROCE stated he’ was
presently employed on the docks in Hoboken, New Jersey, on
the "Sun Dance", a fishing boat. SANTACROCE admitted he had
told people he had worked for ANASTASIA, but told Detective
GRAFF there was no truth in these statements. It was ascer-
tained SANTACROCE was a narcotics user, and he was characterized
as a "bum" whose information could not be considered reliable.

MARCERIA was identified.as JOSE RAMON FAYAT, 441
Southwest 4th Street, Miami, Florida, owner of the Ideal
Restaurant, 755 West Flagler Street, Miami, Florida. However, be
SANTACROCE could not substantiate any of the story he had : &
furnished’ DE TORRES. .

Detective GRAFF advised he had closed out this
phase of his investigation as to the ANASTASIA killing as
being based on unreliable information. |

Betective GRAFF stated it is the policy of the
District Attorney's Office in New York County that no
indictment be issued until that office is ready to apprehend
those: named in the indictment.
