DE TORRES related he was not close to TRAFFICANTE but claimed

that through his informant, cisco, he would be able to secure

further information regarding TRAFFICANTE. DE TORRES stated

he originally advised Federal Narcotics Agent DAVIS of the :

above information in November, 1961.

He said DAVIS told him

there was a $10,000.00 reward for information in the ANASTASIA

homicido, but later stated that after checking with authorities

in New. York City he had ascertained the reward was only

$7,000.00. According to Detective

GRAFt, there is no reward

in this case.

Detective GRAFF 1dentified CISCO as UBALDO SANTACROCE,

New York City Police Department, Number B-474573, also known

as CISCO BOB, and interviewed him.

SANtAChOOL stated he was

presently employed on the docks in Hoboken, New Jersey, on

the "Sun Dance"

,a fishing boat.

SANTACroCk admitted he had

told people he had worked for ANASTASIA, but told Detective

GRAFF there was no truth in these statements.

It was ascer-

tained SANTACROCE was a narcotics user, and he was characterized

as a "bun" whose information could not

be considered rellable.

MARCERIA was identified as JOSE RAMON FAYAT, 441

Southwest 4th Street, Miami, Florida, owner of the Ideal

Restaurant,

755 West

Flagler Street,

Miami, Florida.

However,

SANTACROCE could not

substantiate any of the

story he had

furnished'Ds TORRES.

Detective GRAFF advised he had closed out this

phase of his investigation as to the ANASTASIA k1lling as

being based on unreliable information.

Detective GRAFF stated it is the policy of the

District Attorney's Office in New York County that no

indictment be issued until that office is ready to apprehend

those named in the indictment.
