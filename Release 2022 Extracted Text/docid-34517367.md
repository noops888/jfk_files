considerable contact with members of the Russian Consulate in San Francisco. Informant (S»

stated that John Orloff had stated that in July 1944 three Russian Engineers had visited)

a factory in San Francisco, which manufactured nautical and surveying instruments. The

engineers had been taken on a tour of the factory and one of the engineers wanted to know

the metal from which a magnetic needle was made. Orloff said that he had been the trans

lator, for these engineers, and that the company official leading the tour at the factory.

refused to furnish this information to the Russians, saying that it was SECRET. Orloff-(s

told the Russian engineer that the metal was not SECRET and he would get anything the

(S

and that anything Russia does is correst to Orloff's way of thinking.. (tab 8)

they have developed friends among the Russian people, mainly because of their. co

background. (tab 10).

Informant revealed that Vera Onick's parents exert a great deal of influence ver
