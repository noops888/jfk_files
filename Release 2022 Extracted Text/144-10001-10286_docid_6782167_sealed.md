A visit made to the Takeo province on the 12th gave Prince
SIHANOUK an opportunity to deliver,*a new speech. .The United
States was violently taken to task, and the Prince announced
his decision to recall Mr. NONG KIMNY and almost all: the
personnel of the Khmer -Embassy in Washington and to leave only
the Cultural Attachd there as Chargd d'Affaires. He justified
this step by the United States Ambassador's recent "protest"
to the President of the council against the “hate campaign”
initiated in Cambodia following the death of Marshal{ THANARAT,

a campaign which did not spare President KENNEDY's memory.
Threats of a complete break were even made in the event that
the hate campaign continued.

The Prince also took up--but much more moderate ly--the
question of relations’ [1 gr M] Vietnam and stated that the
Vietnamese Government had already been able to seizé one of
the Free Khmer transmitting stations and hoped to discover the other
one soon. He added that Mr. TRAN CHANH THANH, former Vietnamese
Ambassador to Tunisia, was to come to Cambodia at any moment to
begin negotiations but that he was maintaining the five
conditions that’ he had set up for the resumption of ‘normal.
relations with’ South Vietnam.

Finally’, the Chief of .State announced the forthcoming arrival
of Mr. MESSMER and a French delegation and expressed his confidence

emphasized, “it will be necessary for France to respect the
