Msg Nr: 201 s : :

Reference repercussions in the soviet Union’ to the assassination
of President KENNEDY. . id . .

Basing the first on personal judgment and the others on veports
from reliable diplomatic sources, I wi}l give: the following evalua-
tions: . .

The deep grief produced hete by, the assassination was?
absolutely spontaneous and can be .explained by the high culture of
the Soviet people, which enables.‘them to rise above world events,
and by traditional Russian sentimentality.

The moment the news was -received, because of’ the possibility of
international complications -the military authorities ‘increased! their
security measures. These have now returned to normal.

High-ranking Soviet” officials aré concerned over what interna
tional policy the new President will.pursue, especially with réspect
to Cuba, and, although it seems that’ MIKOYAN's feelings, after'
speaking with the President and other high-ranking United States
officials, were mogerately calm, - Soviet leaders are waiting to ‘learn
how the matter of,’the purchase of ‘wheat in the United’ States. wfll be
resolved and alsé for the conclusion of a new Soviet-United States
cultural agreemént, in order to Sbtain a more clear idea of the above-
mentioned polity.

((A)) Reissyué based on better thet.
