In August 1951 the Agency vas Interested In contacting Professor

Sdouard POLDINI, & geophysicist and professor st the Univeraity of

Geneva and formerly an employee of the SCHLUMBERGER CORPORATION 10

Faris, for operational use. He was to be used as a chennel to a Janus

KANTAS sho could give Infomation about the fate of the previous employees of

the Jersey Company In Hungary, the production figures and extent of

exploitation of existing o1l flelds and exploration of nev o1l fielde

together with the names of the officiale of the Russian Hungaries Coupeny

ho took over the Jersey Company.

In March 1953 the SCHLUMBERGER file reflects that an FBI source

furnished information that one Maurice Fenri MARIIM, employed as an

engineer by the SCHLUMBERGER Company, Paris, France, received & letter

dated 27 July 1951 at Moscow fron one Siegfied Stefanovitch MOROSOFE,

asting MARTIN for speclalized Information concerning geophysics. The

letter requested that MARIIN's reply be forwarded to Moscow through an Inter-

mediary. From January 1932 unt11 April 1937 MARIIN represented the SCHLUMBERGER

Company In Russia as an engineer, and it was thougit that the correspondence

from MOROSOFT may represent a soviet attempt to resume contact with MARTIN

and develop clendestine relations with him. The FBI conducted an InvestI-

gation asted June 1953 and determined that Naurice HenrI MARTIN resided

at Nod R1ll, Wilton, Connecticut and was employed by the SCHLUMnE

Well Surveying CO., Ridgefield, Connecticut. Informants advised that

although MARTIN was strongly nationalistic toward france, be gave every

Indication of belag ent1-Bussian and there vas no evidence d CP activities.
