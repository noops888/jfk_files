In March 1953 the SCHLUMBERGER file reflects that an FBI source
furnished information thet one Meurice Henri MARTIN, employed es an
engineer by the SCHLUMBERGER Compsny, Paris, France, received e letter
dated 27 July 1951 at Moscow from one Bieg@ied Stefanovitch MOROSOFF,
aeking MARTIN for specialized information concerning geophysics. The
letter requested that MARTIN's reply be forwarded to Moscow through sn inter-
mediary. From January 1932 util April 1937 MARTIN represented the SCHLUMBERGER
Company in Russia as en engineer, end it wes thought that the correspondence
from MOROSOFF may represent a Soviet attempt to resume contact with MARTIN
and Gevelop clandestine relations with him. The FBI conducted an investi«-
gation dated Jime 1953 and determined that Maurice Henri MARTIN resided
at Nod Hill, Wilton, Connecticut end was employed by the SCHLUMBERGER
Well Surveying Co., Ridgefield, Connecticut. Informants advised that
although MARTIN was strongly nationalistic toward France, he pave every
4ndication of being enti-Russian and there was no evidenceof CP activities.
