place during AMKHIP-1's most recent sojourn in Europe (January-
cet ies February 1965) in company with ANLASH-1. Meeting was also er
used to determine AMWHIP-1's willingness to participate in the
“discord program" using,@NSNAFU-19 as the unwitting recipient
of certain rumors, the’details, of which are covered in
subsequent paragraphs. H

2, It might be noted for the record that this meeting was
scheduled for the morning of 18 February, but due to

3. The following information on the various topics as ait

indicated concern basically those requirements which have

been intended for, and levied on, AMLASH-1. However, due to

the fact that AMMHIP-1 was together in Europe with AMLASH-1,

AMWHIP-1:was- debriefed oa the requirements on the outside

chance that he.might have sone complimentary information on them.

: a. (@rlando Blanco) Cuban Diplomat in (Bern, Switzerland.)
\IWHIP-1 was-unable-to give any additional information on
0G (Bianco)as he had not met the man in Europe and ddes not remember
Raving met him in Havana. (AMWHIP-1 stated that ANLASH-1
claimed that he (AMWHIP-1) had in fact met Blancoa ‘number
of years ago in Havana, but AMWHIP says he truly does not
remember,the man.) He stated that any additional information
on @lanco)would haveoto come from either ANLASH-1 or ANLASH-3.
In approaching Blanco>for cooperation, AMWHIP strongly
suggested that it would be best to useoAMLASH-3 for the
initial contact. AMNHIP stated that (BLANCO )knew AMLASH-3 well
and that he was a trusted representative (and therefore anti-
Castro) of AMLASH-1 AMWHIP-1 was told we were looking into
Blanc) and also into@UNOPS-1, Attache Cuban Embassy, (iadrid:)

stated that QUHOPS would do what he could to help but that
in exchange for this he wanted to get his wife, two children,
and his mother~in-laweto the United States along with himself.
AMNHIP-1 stated that QDHOPS' plan in brief was to accept
the guard duty on Sunday thus making probably only himcelf
and the wife of code clerk present in the embassy, We -
thanked AMWHIP for his information and suggestions and
stated that they would be conveyed to the appropriate parties

concerned. a

dg. “Venezuelan” Returning from Moscow. Regarding the
Venezuelan who has reportedly to have Just come from Moscow
and returning to Cuba, AMWHIP-1 stated that he had no
information to contribute about the man. He did say, however,
that one time duringphis recent trip to the Cuban Embassy
Paris talking with QUNSNAFU-19, the Ambassador had interrupted
their conversation in order to talk to two men (about 30-35
years old). AMWHIP-1 met them briefly and was told by one
of them that they were from Oriente Province. AMWHIP—1
Stated that he could tell immediately by their accents
that they were not Cuban. In order to confirm this he
asked them where in Oriente they were from because one of the
Cuban officials in Paris was from Oriente and always wanted
fo chat with any people from Oriente who passed through Paris.
After a brief stumbling exercise, groping for a name of a
city in Oriente, the "Cuban" confessed that they were not
Cubans but Venezuelans. AMWHIP did not have suffident time
to learn more about them.a2The two Venezuelans spent about
thirty minutes talking withCUNSNAFU-19 while AMWHIP was there,
He did not know how much longer previous to this thirty
minutes that the Venezuelans had been in thevEmbassy or to whom
else they talked. ANWHIP-1 suggested that (UNSNAFU-9 might
be able to obtain the names of the two Venezuelans in question.

As a support service for a Paris Station)operation to get

NAFU-19 membership in the Gaslight Club where it would be
attempted to run a highly desirable female agent against him.
AMLASH-1 stated that he had been unable, due tOWUNSNAFU-19's
busy schedule, to get the latter down to the Gaslight Club
and enrolled as a member. AMHIP stated, however. that he
could do the job just as well by taking out a gift menbership
for AFU-L9ethrough the Gaslight Club in New York City.
and sending @SSNAFU-19's membership card and key to him in
Paris. We encouraged AMWHIP-1 to do this and to keep us
advised of his progress.

J. AMLASH-1's Accommodation Address Arrangement:
AMWHIP-1 stated that he had reviewed accommodation sses
with ANLASH-1 and had given appropriate instructions to
AMWHIP-2 in the event of the receipt of letters from
Havana signed by AMLASH-1 or signed by a "Cuban" whom,
AMWHIP-2 did not know: (Comment: it was a good thing we
reviewed accommodation addiess With AMMHIP-1, see below.)
For the record AMLASH-1 will address his letters to, ANWHIP-2
either in care of his business address in Rome which is:

Cavaliere Hilto.
Jewelry Shop
Mente Mario
Roma

P-2's business address in-Geneva (which incidentally
is identical with his home address, as AMWHIP-2 operates in
Geneva from his apartment): Rue Crespin, Gen i

(It should be noted that AMWHIP-2 intends to open a proper
office in Geneva in-the near future. However, this is no
particular reason for changing the accommodation address in
Geneva.) AMWHIP~1 stated that he had given the undersigned's
postoffice box in Washington (William A. Thompson, P.O.

Box 7224 Apex Station, Washington, D.C. to AMWHIP-2, believing
that this would expedite our receipt of letters from AMLASH-1.
AMWHIP-1 was told that his concern for rapid transmittal of
the letters was certainly appreciated, but that for security
sake, it was much better that they be forwarded in a cover
envelope to. AMWHIP's address in New York City, -preferably,

his business address. AMWHIP was also told to remind
AMKHIP-2 that he'should handle the letters he received from
Havana as little as possible and put them:in cover envelopes
and send them as quickly as possible to AMWHIP-1 in New York
City. In this connection it remains the problem of obtaining
these letters on a expeditious basis when AMWHIP-1 is, for
example, out of town for a prolonged absence. It is
Suggested that William Thompson's accommodation business

in Washington be given to AMWHIP’s father so that he may
forward AMWHIP-2's Tetters to Washington without undue delay.
(This is an excellent example of a breakdown in compartmentation

in Cuban operations.) .

k. Paris Embassy Personnel. According to a telephone
call on 18 February from AMLASH-I in Paris, AMWHIP<] stated
that AMLASH-1 had said that WUNSYAFU-8 and, perhaps GNBNAFU-9
would. be out of jobs in the ned future in accordance with

z,the present economy drive by the Cubans. AMLASH stated that
O'(USSNAFU-8 most certainly would be ousted, while (USS NAFU-9's
case was more uncertain, oe



personally end. did : arily s
financial picture of the Cuban government.
that AMLASH-I-had told him that such an act

arrangements of his own, without regard or without. cons'

national ‘finances. gis

He also stated that he believed these factories were for
the processing of agricultural products of some type. Also,

concerning the silver, according to AMWHIP-1, that 30% had_
consisted of “worked”

AMWHIP stated ‘that™ this ‘entire offering of silver a
had eventually been sold on the spot in Havana for c Sh.
an unknown person.of Turkisb/Italian background. AMWHIP
‘tried to find out the identity of the person but net

reveal the identity. of the buyer. AMWHIP-1 offered to
or ask Iglesias. for.thée name; but we cautioned against’
as showing undue interest in the matter. i Ass t
that if he, ever saw Iglesias in. person and could safely ask
him he should do so together with any details he. could | eeine
obtain about the transaction, ‘as it was related to Cuban |
financial problems. AMWHIP-1 stated that on his return |

also stated that AMLASH-1 had asked Jose Iglesias in Havana
for some 3,000 pesos, Iglesiag was not able to raise the sum
,at the tine requested. Whether or not. he is attempting to do «
SO now, or has succeeded in doing ‘so during ANLASH-1's abse:
is not known at this time. -It, should be noted that during.
discussions concerning’ the AMBIDDY/ANLASH relationship, -AMWHIP-
stated that ANBIDDY had told-AMLASH of at least some portion of
his: connections with the Americans. AMWHIP-1 stated that he had
sat in on the discussions during which time. AMBIDDY purportedly
made this statement. AMWHIP also stated, as he had-done ia
Previous meetings, that neither he or AMLASH could understand
why the Americans. did nok :make.further use of AMLASH-3 and
AMLASH-2. He also felt: that there’were many bits and piec
of the whole picture tl were not tied into a neat bundle“an °
utilized to their full extent by the Americans. The undersigned
at no time admitted that. he. was aware of any ANBIDDY/Amer.
relationship as alluded to by ANWHIP-1.

©, "For. the record, AMWHIP-1 again stressed the fact that.
he felt. that he could produce ‘more information and better serve
XUBARX interests if he had a case officer who knew all aspects
of the AMLASH complex and the cast of other Cuban characters ‘in

access. He emphasized that (Pari: officer (R. Owen) (and
Presumably other European-based ‘case officers@3with whom he
has dealt) was very helpful -and that he enjoyed their relation:
but that there was an obvious lack of depth of knowledge of all
aspects of an AMLASH-AMWHIP operation and also of those principally

AMWHIP-1 stated that he.‘thought that he could carry this ‘of
". oUwithout (UNSNAFU-19 being suspicious. He stated that this ‘type
of information would have ‘to come forth at the right moment in:
a natural manner, and during a rather lengthy personal meeting.

He was in agreement with the undersigned's idea ee
to play it as safely as possible, this meeting with @/SSNAFU-19.
“should not take place at least until after the 24th of Februa:
the expected return date of ‘ANLASH-1 to Havana: Both ee this


reason and for AXMHIP-s own business matters, we will program
his return to Europe for sometime during the first or second Ee
weeks of March 1965. ANWHIP-1 was told that arrangements would be
made for him to know about. or actually to meet, the ostensible
“Source of this information in New York sometime during the last
week of February or the first week of March. He was told also
to keep in touch with the undersigned in the event of any

Y mews received from Europe concerning AMLASH-1 or any of the
cast of characters in this memorandua.
