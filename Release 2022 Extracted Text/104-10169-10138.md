guided by an ideological system (with personal modifications) with

vather meticulously, especially for the purpose of creating a proper
tmpression, In reality, she exercises a number of camouflaging
capacitics most cleverly and skillfully. This is intensified by
considerable self-deceptive and dramatic abilities, Her emotional
ietortion is more of pathological than of criminal Rature, with the
veoult of being emotionally not reliable and trustworthy. She may

W6e to accuse her of wrong doing or arguing with her beca: she is

very subjective. No matter what, she is alwaya right, as far as
he Is concerned and she turns everything around in her favor. There

hardly a demarcation line. Her Paycho-physical resources-are_
drained by her emotional tensiveness and ‘Complexity, but she has
sufficient energy and strength at her disposal to “upport her general

Purposes,

Summary: ‘
The writer has a variety of good Innate capacities which should
qualify her as a corapetent worker in her Professional field. Shs slsc
has some potentialities which could be utilized for covert activities.
- However, her serious emotional distortion is the basié for considerable

unrelability and inconsistency of her attitudes, a condition which may
be rather well camouflaged.
