ANTRUNK OPERATIONS

After three unsuccessful attempts to launch Operation AMTRUNK VII
during the month of February, Operation AMIRUNK VIII in mid-March was
partially successful. The two major objectives of this operation were:
one, to re-contact ANTRUNK-10; and two,to bring into the infiltration/
exfiltration area a cache of weapons and explosives as requested by
AMLASH-1. Operation AMTRUNK VIII was successful only tn fulfilling the
latter objective because the team was fired upon by a patrol craft at the
start of tho infiltrstion phase, and, after returning the fire, escaped
to an alternate coastal landing area. The cache was emplaced in Lorth-
wester:: Las Villas Province on 19 March, the evening before the team's
exfiltration. Directions for its recovery were sent to AXTRUNK-10 by
8/# on 23 March, In addition to the weapons and explosives, the cache
Qlso contained an OWL receiver for AHTRUNK-10, (complete with directions
and schedules) and extra 8/W¥ supplies for both ANTRUNK=-10 and AMTRUNK~-11.
Arrangements are in process to send ANTRUNK-13 to Mexico City to attenpt
the recruitment of Jose Alberto SEMIDEY Isalgue, a Cubana pilot who is an
Ainfl¢ential figure in civil and military aviation and a frequent personal
pilot for Raul CASTRO, There are no immediate plans to remount another
infiltration at least until AMTRUNK-10 notifies the Station whether or
not he has been successful in recovering the AMLASH cache.
