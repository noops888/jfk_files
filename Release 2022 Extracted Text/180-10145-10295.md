Note: Cover note pencilled comment (Thé:content is so biased and mixed
with untruth that it would be a disservice to the intelligence commnity
to disseminate it.

Synopsis of paragraphs 1-ll. Dr. Salas says during his childhood Ray was

a Protestant but today is completely atheistic. Said Ray organized the MRC
against Batista and shortly after Batista's fall, MRC end 26th of July
Movement fused into one, ana as soon as Castro came into power, control

of the organization was given to the Commnists. ‘Tells of Ray's association
with Castro and that he did not resign his position when his own brother
was renounced by Castro. Stated that Ray's rupture with Fidel was due

to the fact shat Ray opposed the idea of shooting Hubert Matos as a

traitor. Ray resigned his post but said publicly that he approved and
supported the Castro regime without any mental reservations. Says in
Cuban clandestine circles Ray is regarded as boastful, ostentatious and:
deceitful. Intimate friends of Ray feel that he is a man of anti-democratic
procedures, and does not like to take advice, even from members of his own
movenent.

Synopsis of paragraph 12. Dr. Alvarez said Ray was in favor of maintaining
relations with USSR and not making Commmist Party illegal. Seid that

‘though Ray withdrew all these statements when threatened with press
coverage, Alvarez thinks they are representative of Ray's thinking and
would try to put ideas into practive if he ever came to power. Alverez
also mentioned Rays thinking on nationalization of public services,
socialized medicine, nationalization of banks, etc.

Synopsis of paragraph 13. Dr. Beruff seid Ray well-intentioned with no
Communist tendencies. Cited a meeting at which the basic points of the

MRP platform were discussed and said that since Ray was in disagreement with
the others on most of the points, Dr. Felipe Pazos acted as chairman of the
meeting and Ray argued his case as a simple member of the group. Out of this
meeting came a declaration of 14 points, including the nationalization of
the banks and public utilities.

On 9 March, Ray said that ideas attributed to him in paragraph 12 were not
true and part of a “campaign against him by Mr. Pawley of the i city

Signed: Calvin Hicks WH/4/PM/operations

“Ray is balieved to have accomplished pratically nothing towards the effort
to overthow Castro. Instead, it seems that whenever we played with his so-
called assets, we were burned. He is notorious for claiming assets or
operations, several days after some other group had already set them up or
claimed them. Whenever it came to producing and backing up his claims, he
always came up with excuses for not producing, rather than results. He has
always tended to try to take over other goups, rather than cooperate with
them, and when he couldn't take them over he would "politic" against then.
His actions all seemed to be directed toward making him the future power
in Cuba rather than toward overthrowing Castro. It is believed that Manolo
RAY is so far "left" in his thinking that he would be as dangerous (or more
so in the long run) to United States interests as Castro, if he ever got to
be the power in Cuba."

1. Cable to JMWAVE from Director
Date: August 1, 1961

FBI conducting investigation on MRP and Ray and Director indicates he
needs to know purpose of investigation to respond properly.

2. Dispatch from Chief of Base, JMWAVE
Date: August 4, 1961
Subject: Debriefing of Father Bastarrica

Father Bastarrica recently arrived from Cuba as a political exile. At a’
luncheon meeting, he reported as follows: c
MRP formed in Cuba around 26 July 1960. Organizers were Dr. Amalio Fiallo
Gonzalez, Dr. Antonio Fernandez Nuevo, Reynol Gonzalez, Humberto Perez Herrera.
All these men belonged to group called Accion Democratica. The name of MRP
was suggested by Raul Chibas and in itself it does not constitute a party
or group but rather a coalition of several small groups, which were the
following:

a. The 20 May group, led by Manuel Ray

b. Accion Democratica, led by Dr. Fiallo

¢. Accion Verde Olivo, led by Dr. Rufo Lopez Fresquet

d. 30 November Movement, led by David Salvador (never really joined)

e. Chibas' group with Jorge Beruff and Felipe Pazos

f. Dr. Valdez Pino, in asylum in Embassy of Peru and belonged

ree to accion Democratica.

Father Bastarrica's opinion of Ray is that he had no way of judging whether
Ray is Commmist or Marxist. lacks quality of leadership because he
does not publically hold to a definite political, social and economic ideology.
He appears to agree with every person he talks to, never arguing with them
or opposing them, all of which shows he has no ideology and makes him a
very dangerous man. Is extremely ambitous for himself, with great desire
for power.

Origin of Autonomous Operations

Integrated Covert Action Program for Cuba, approved by Higher Authority
in June 1963, provided for "support of autonomous anti-Castro Cuban groups
to supplement and assist in the execution" of other courses of action.
Concept was first voiced in Sept. 1962 in Walter Rostow's proposal for a
“Track Two" approach to Cuban operations. Parallel to regular CIA-
controlled Cuban teams, CIA wokld extend financial aid and some advice and
guidance to independent and uncontrolled Cuban leaders such as Manuel Ray.

Rules of Engagement incorporated into June 1963 program.

1. "It is the keystone of autonomous operations that they will be
executed exclusively by Cuban nationals motivated by the conviction that the
overthrow of the Castro/Commnist regime must be accomplished by Cubans,
both inside and outside Cuba acting in consonance. 7

2. The effort will probably cost many Cuban lives. If this cost
in lives becomes unacceptable to the U.S. conscience, autonomous operations
can be effectively halted by the withdrawal of U.S. support; but once halted,
they cannot be resumed.

3. All autonomous operations will be mounted outside the territory
of the United States.

4, The United States Government must be prepared to deny publicly
any participation in these acts no matter how loud or even how accurate may
be the reports of Us S, complicity.

5. The United States presence and direct participation in the
operation would be kept to an absolute minimum. Before entering into an
operational relationship with a group, the U.S. representative will make it
clear that his Government has no intention of intervening militarily, except
to counter intervention by the Soviets. An experienced CIA officer would be
assigned to work with the group in a liaison capacity. He would provide
general advice as requested as well as funds and necessary material support.
He may be expected to influence but not control the conduct of operations.

6. These operations would not be undertaken within a fixed time
schedule."

"Ray Said To leave For Cuba Landing - Castro Foe, Balked in May, Reported
on Way Again."

4, Memo for the Record, dtd 11 Sept 1964 from Alfonso Rodreguez

On Aug 2h, 1954, Rogelio Cisneros called to report his resignation from JURE.
Stated Ray incapable of directing both political and military activities.
Cisneros thinks Raul Chibas will soon also resign. Cisneros said Ray not
prepared for ill-fated May attempt into Cuba and Cisneros thinks Ray had
believed he could arrange for CIA to take him into Cuba. "Ray is politically
uvpnformed --- politically that which he last read". Cisneros further stated
that he believed Ray had planned his entire return-to-Cuba angle with President
Kennedy and the presidential elections of November 1964 in mind. According to
him, Ray planned to make JURE and Ray outstanding . liberal and democractic
exile group with the thought that prior to the 1964 elections, Mr. Kennedy
would have to do something about Cuba. With Kennedy's death, according to
Cisneros, all of Ray's plans went awry. Rodriguez expresses to Cisneros
that this seems like a far-fetched possibility and Cisneros admits he got
idea out of thin air, but said theory widely held within Directorate of JURE.

5. Memo for the Record ~ draft - dtd 22 Sept 196 - Alfonso Rodriguez
Conclusions "I recommend we give Ray wnat he asks and close the JURE books
for good. Tf Ray is succesful in Cuba he will not need our help, if he is
not, our help won't do much good.

"He is honest and at least the money will lergely be spent for the
purpose he wants to achief . ©

Source: Cuban National (Alien File a-12570921) who asked for an
interview on occasion of first contact with CIA.

Cannot vouch for his bona fides. Had credential indicating membership in
branch of revolutionary army's intelligence service, now in exile in U.S.
and maintaing connections with colleagues in that country.

A friend of his reports plans to assassinate top Castro leadership in Cuba.
To be done by poison -- "Clostridium Botulinum" which is strong, odorless,
and tasteless. Takes about 12 days to kill. About 5cc would do the job.
Waiting for next visit of major delegation from a Communist country --
dinner in honor of the occasion should bring together most of the important
menbers_of the regime and that is when the attempt will be made.

Branch from Daniels. Source is Ernesto Dezaldo + Cuban lawyer now
living in New york City. Stated the MRP in Havena is far less radical then

under the leadership of Ray, who has been completely discredited in recent
months. Primary purpose today is (a) assassination of top leaders in Castro
regime and (B) sabotage of important industrial and government installations
in Hevana. Strength of MRP in Havana estimated to exceed 1,000 -- success
measured more in terms of fund raising ability and blowing up of buildings.

to get rid of Castro. Claimed that prior to invasion, is was possible to
buy almost anything in Cuba from Castro officials -- they were tainted by
corruption. Since Castro's victory at Bay of Pigs, his popular support is
estimated to be around 90-85%. Most support is out of fear because the
people believe he will be in power permanently. Borja said DRE outside of

: & On 11/15/60, Parlett|alias Bender met with Ray in complete privacy.

: "Unquestionably, thé youthful, softspoken, unassuming, almost hume Ray
is a naturel leader of highest intellect, deepest sincerity and convistion."
Ray's political posture doubtful as far as U.S. government acceptance is
concerned. i :

Explained to Ray the U.S. government's desire to have all Cuban exiles
unified in their efforts. Ray Says MRP does not wish to reinstate 1950
constitution. Provisional governmant of 30 honorable Cubans would be
established and elections held 18 months thereafter. Castro laws passed
at beginning of his regime to be promigated. State would regulate

private investment and utilities would be nationalized.

Ray wants to keep MRP "lean and hungry" -- each member to have specific
responsibilities ani feel important to revolution.

Ray asked for permission to start a fund drive in Cuba and U.S. Also
asked for $10,000 by next Wednesday -- Bender made commitment.

[parted netteves net result of meeting was establishment of private MRP-
U.S. link and door remains open for some kind of relationship with FRD.
Ray. agrees to discuss this with Miro Cardona. Of all the groups being
supported, FRD, MRP and MRR are most significant. All Cuban groups seem
to be looking to Bender group to show a preference before joining one of
the above three. How long current flexibility can be maintained is
problematical.

“Ray has indicated to WAVE sources that whereas he is not persona grata

with the Agency, he has important political connections in Washington and

is thus kept informed of much of the Agency's activities. Ray's new
organization is not to be military or engage in military thrusts against
Cuba because military activity is presently controlled by the Agency and

with Castro but because of a heated discussion with the Minister of Labor.
