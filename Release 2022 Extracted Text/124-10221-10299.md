CASTRO reviewed the film prior to its

was sent back to their group for revision.

A number of cuts

D(AL)

DE ARMAS recalled, that again on his own, he made a

statement at the beginning of the press conference in which he

remarked that the statements he was making were voluntary. His

interview with CASTRO lasted for approximately twenty minutes and

he expressed a completely willing and positive attitude to CASTRO

in the release of the press conference.

He did not object in any

way to the revisions which CASTRO had found necessary.

DE ARMAS'

impression from his interview with CASTRO was that CASTRO attempted

to convey the impression to him that he or the Cuban Government were

doing DE ARMAS a favor in permitting him to make the press release.

At this point in the interview, DE ARMAS explained

that he did not feel that the information that he furnished in

the press release was of any great damage to the United States

Government in that it contained many obvious untruths ang

misinformation. As an example, he purposely identified Mr.

FRED DUNCAN aS

an employee of the CIA when he is actually

an employee of DEA He reiterated that his motivation throughout

all of this activity was to ingratiate himself with the Cuban

Government in order to place himself in a position whereby

he could be of assistance to the United States Government. DE ARMAS

accepted full responsibility for all

his actions as .

FARMAS noted that he had made some comments concerning.

MARTINEZ whom he identified as a Cuban exile who left

DE ARMAS did not know MARTINEZ 'and

information was reflected in his news release.

RE: JANUES IBOARDO DE ARMAS $ COMI

In regards to the ROLANDO MASFERRER murder, DE ARMAS claimed

that Abdala considered MASFERRERas an obstacle to Its efforts and

had formulated plans for his assassination.

The possibility of

planting C-4 plastic explosive in his automobile was explored.

After a number of discussions, of which DE ARMAS was privy,

someone in Abdala made the statement to forget about the

plans to kill MASFERRER. DE ARMAS stated that shortly thereafter

MASFERRER was killed when his automobile was bombed.

After the

bombing,

Mr. ROBERT MILLS of the FBI Miami, approached DE ARMAS and

inquired as to any information he may have

as to the bombing and whether

he was personally involved in it.

DE ARMAS advised MILLS of the discussions

denied any direct knowledge 'of MASFERRER's murder.

Cuban Intelligence were aware that DE ARMAS was affiliated

with Abdala and they also believed that he had direct knowledge of

the MASFERRER Killing. As a result, during his debriefings, DE ARMAS

attributed the receipt of plastic explosiye C-4 from BoB MILLs whom

he purposely identified/asja CIA Officer.

Then he claimed that he gave u

the explosives to Abdala with the implication that Abdala

responsible for MASFERRER's murder.

DE ARMAS claimed that an individual named MA

LESN

although claiming to be an anti-Castro Cuban in the Miami,

ETorida
