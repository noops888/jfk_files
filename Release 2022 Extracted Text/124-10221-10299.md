tape was completed to the satisfaction of his
Intelligence*¢orroboraters and he described the finished product
as a “bombshell”. The tape was then submitted to FIDEL CASTRO i
for review and approval. CASTRO reviewed the film prior to its

submission to the Political Bureau and after CASTRO's review it

was sent back to their group for revision. A number of cuts . ‘
were made in the video tape which is apparent #hen viewed in ~ +
that the tape in part lacks continuity. ) '

Reference to ERASTOS FERNANDEZ and ORLAND GARCIA

ASCUAL appears to have been the case officer handling
E ARMAS, told DE ARMAS that CASTRO desired to speak to him
after reviewing the tape. DE ARMAS was placed on standby to
await a summons from CASTRO for interview. About 2 o'clock

DE ARMAS and that for his own reasons CASTRO wanted a number

of revisions made in the tape. CASTRO's attitude implied that he
was permitting the DE ARMAS news release and pointed ,ou hat
that release was purely voluntary on DE ARMAS' part. AL)

RE of MANUEL LF ARDO DE ony fe

Ses

DE ARMAS recalled, that again on his own, he made a
statement at the beginning of the press conference in which he
remarked that the statements he was making were voluntary. His
interview with CASTRO lasted for approximately twenty minutes and
he expressed a completely willing and positive.attitude to CASTRO
in the release of the press conference. He did not object in any
way to the revisions which CASTRO had found necessary. DE ARMAS’
impression from his interview with CASTRO was that CASTRO attempted
to convey the impression to him that he or the Cuban Government were
doing DE ARMAS a favor in permitting him to make the press release.

At this point in the interview, DE ARMAS explained a
that he did not feel that the information that he furnished in
the press release was of any great damage to the United States
Government in that it contained many obvious untruths a:
misinformation. As an example, he purposely identified it ae

\
FRED DUNCAN as an lloyee of the CIA when he is actually |
an _ employee of DEx Bapuie reiterated that his motivation throughou w)
all of this activity was to ingratiate himself with the Cuban i

Government in order to place himsélf in a position whereby

he could be of assistance to the United States Government. DE ARMAS
accepted full responsibility for all is actions as. : \
noted throughout this entire attair. C

P2ARMAS noted that he had made some comments concerning:
one MARTINEZ whom he identified as a Cuban exile who left
Cubs” sometime ing the revolution and is connécted with the

Anti-CASTRO news media. DE ARMAS did not know MARTINEZ ‘and
was simply briefed on his activities by Cuban Intelligence, which
information was reflected in his news release. He also referred to

a ole iphonetic) in the same context. He recalls having

In regards to the ROL Ie} SFE: R rder, DE ARMAS claimed
that Abdala considered MASP as stacle T efforts and
had formulated plans for his assassination. The possibility of
planting C-4 plastic explosive in his automobile was explored.
after a number of discussions, of which DE ARMAS was privy, ‘|
someone in Abdala made the statement to forget about the |
plans to kill MASFERRER. DE ARMAS stated that shortly thereafter
MASFERRER was killed when his automobile was bombed. After the
bombing, Mr. ROBERT MILLS of the, FBI Miami, approached DE ARMAS and |
inquired as to any information he may have as to the bombing and whether
he was personally involved in it. DE ARMAS advised MILLS of the discussions
within ABDALA concerning the possible assassination of M SFERRER but
denied any direct knowledge ‘of MASFERRER's murder. fe) :

Cuban Intelligence were aware that DE ARMAS was affiliated
with Abdala and they also believed that he had direct knowledge of
the MASFERRER killing. As a result, during his debriefings, DE_ARMAS
attributed the receipt of plastic explosjye c-4 from BOB MILLS (whom ae
he purposely identified’as?’’a CIA officer tg) Taen he claimed that he gave(U) \
the explosives to Abdala‘wi'th the implicatton that Abdala was
responsible for MASFERRER'S murder. ¢

DE ARMAS claimed that an ifdividual named
although claiming to be an anti-Castro Cuban in the Miami,
aréa, is a close personal friend of CASTRO and RAUL CASTRO. He is
the, director of an anti-Castro magazi et the feeling in Havana is
‘that he may be working for CASTRO. fai c ap ik

The bombing of WOBA Broadcaster ZL was pee
also discussed with DE ARMAS. DE ARMAS claiméd that shortly ater [
furnishing his press release he was naturally branded as a traitor |
by the Cuban Community in Miami. MOULION took the position a

publicly that the full story concerning DE ARMAS had not come to
light and thereafter statements concerning his treason were unfounded
at the time. About 3 days after his defense of DE ARMAS,

his automobile was bombed. with the result that MOULION 4 :
lost both his legs. DE ARMAS had no knowledge of the bombing eu B:
of MOULION's car. However, the offigjal Cuban sentiment is that——7_
the bombing was performed by suey s group. The Cuban bee
Government is elated over this because TA who has alwasy been” éne
of the leaders of the anti-Castro movement in Miami, had now resorted to
radical terrorist action, fearful as many other anti-Castro Cubans -

are, that the United States will resume diplomatic relations with
