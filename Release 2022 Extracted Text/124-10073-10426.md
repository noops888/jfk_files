Background

ELENA GARRO DE PAZ, or Mise GARRO as Mr. THOMAS calis
ber, is a well known figure in Mexican political, social and.
literary circles. She was a playwright: and well known to many
officials of the Embassy including the then’ Ambaseador
-FREEMAN, the then Deputy Chief of Missien CLARENCE
‘and many others. All of those officials éxpresaed ‘to.
various .cceasions the opinion that Mies GARROG ig
person and a scintillating conversationalist, but
vivid imagination and frequently appears to be unab:.
between truth and fiction. Although ‘interesting

who acquired this intelligence information, I feel a .
responsibility for seeing it through to its final evaluation.”

It appears, therefore, that Mr. THOMAS has now decided that he

and not the FBI or the Department of Justice is the one to

decide how the story given by Miss GARRO is to be evaluated.

The concept that every person who passes on to another govern-
ment agency information relating to matters within the jurisdiction
of that agency has the responsibility and authority to review

and evaluate the action taken by that agency is, of course,
untenable.

/. Further question concerning Mr. THOMAS' judgment is
raisedoy item 3 of paragraph 10 of his memorangum furnished to
, the Secretary of State. Any reference to the Petose and delicate YS)
/ relationship between the head of CIA Mexico a top Mexican
f officials,if true, is a very highly classified matter and any
"leak" or revelation to unauthorized individuals concerning such
an arrangement would, in view of the delicate Mexican political
situation, be disastrous to the Mexican Government as well as
to Mexican-American relations. The delicacy of the situation
has recently been greatly augmented by the published Cuban
J allegation that one of the officers of the Mexican Embassy in
Havana one acting as a CIA spy with the knowledge of the Mexican

Governmen Mr. THOMAS, however, included such a highly
classifie eference in a memorandum which he classified only
as "confidential", contrary to regulations relative to classification
. of documents. While this reference relates to the activities and
, Operations of another Government agency and therefore is not of
\ primary concern to the Bureau, it is nevertheless called to the
\ Bureau's attention foy,consideration in evaluating Mr. THOMAS’
\current allegations. (

An additional copy of this letter is being forwarded
for,use in the event the Bureau desires to forward a copy to
Dallas which received a copy of referenced letter.
