spring of

a an an actone entionist as further at(u)

was well-known that prior to the Bay of Pigs invasion,

there were military units who trained in Nicaragua at

which time IGLESIAS became friendly with General SOMOZA

President of Nicaragua.

ANTONIO IGLESIAS is one of the main witnesses

to this impersonation and it is anticipated he will be

a witness in the subsequent trial of GUILLERMO J.

YGLESIAS. The reason for IGLESIAS' recent residence

in Nicaragua is not believed to be related with any

efforts to evade being a witness in this matter.

Current investigation of subject as requested

by the Bureau has included Miami Office indices check

with local sources and informants and related inquiry.

Subject's background and activities as set out herein,

indicate that he is well regarded in the Cuban community

as anti-CASTRO, anti-communist, and pro-United States.

He is not currently active or involved in Cuban terrorist

activities and there is no indication his activities would

pose any threat to the internal security of the United

warranted in this matter at this i eavestigation is
