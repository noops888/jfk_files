MEMORANDUM FOi: Special Agent in Charge
Miami Field Office

SUBJECT : Field Office Memorandut
Re:

1. Ihave nav read with care the referenced memorand
which deals specifially with charges by a {Srmer agent Wilfredo
"Pancho'"' VARONA against his handler known as "Frank" or
Enrique. As you wil have perceived from reading VARONA's
file by the time you read this memorandum, Mr. VARONA is not
well regarded by ow~ Station and/or the people who have handled
him to date. This onstitutes the reason for his termination. I
would also like you7o examine the field traces on Mr. Charles
GOVEA, an attachnent to this memorandum. These traces
indicate that Mr. GOVEA has had in the past, and possibly still
may have, some cortact with Castro intelligence organizations.
We are presently wciting for a more complete read-out on Mr.
GOVEA from the Nev York Office of the FBI. Understandably,
therefore, you can ice we look somewhat askance at the GOVEA/
VERONA informatio. Although wé recognize the integrity of
the unwitting intermediary Mr. Winston Guest of Palm Beach,
Florida, we also re:ognize the implications for "Frank" in Mr.
GOVEA's knowleds: of our affairs given his possible Castro
intelligence connecton. Axiomatically, we will be interested in
knowing, at some pont in the near future, whether "Frank's"
true identity is knovn by either VARONA or GOVEA.

{ 2. Ihave ditcussed this memorandum in detail with
"Frank", Our view on VARONA's allegations are presented
below, keyed to you: basic memorandum.

a. is paragraph 4 of your memorandum of
11 June 196%:

Mr. VARONA was recruited sometime
during 1957 ‘3y Mr. \William Murray then assigned to
the Agency': Station in Havana. He was subsequently
handled by N=. Jack Stewart) another Agency Officer
presently stcioned in Kingston, Jamaica. Later, still
in Cuba, he was handled by Mr, Frank Belsito now serving
in Panama 21d Emilio Rodriguez (deceased.) Mr. Rodrigu
turned Mr. ARONA over to "Frank" in November 1960. >
In August 1911, Mr. VARONA took asylum in the Brazilian
Embassy indavana. He was later granted "salvo conducto"
to Rio de Jmeiro. In the interim "Frank" was exfiltrated
from Cuba tthe U.S. When Mr. VARONA arrived in the
Florida area during March 1962, he was met by his Havana
Case Office> "Frank" who continued to handle him until
August 1962, at which time he was turned over to the Greek
Case Officexhe refers to. The Greek Case Officer handled
him for app:aximately three years. Along about 1965, the
Greek Case Dfficer turned Mr. VARONA over to Mr. Al

- McQuade ak: Fred who handled Mr. VARONA until May

1968, at whi:h time he was'‘turned over to "Pepe" intro-
duced by '"F:ank" who served as an intermediary because
of his previats connection with Mr. VARONA. Pepe's ‘
specific job:vas to give Mr. VARONA one last chance to
prove that h: could be productive before being terminated.
Pepe, an exjerienced agent handler's problems with Mr.
VARONA weze precisely like those of his predecessors.
He found Mr, VARONA to be untruthful, bellicose and
generally uniatisfactory for any form of continued employ-
ment by WE. Miami. Therefore, after due consideration
of Mr. VARONA's potential to cause trouble because of
his long exp:rience with the Agency, the decision was |
taken to terninate him recognizing full well there might

be security ::percussions.



In tle light of the foregoing, it is worrisome
to find out tlat Mr. VARONA is aware that "Frank"
recently recsived transfer orders from the Organization,
We need maze information on this. We suspect that the
origin of this statement is the fact that Mr. VARONA
recently met"F rank" on the street in Mexico City by
complete haypenstance. During that meeting "Frank"
alluded to th: fact that he was no longer working in
Miami (althagh in fact he was) to confuse Mr. VARONA
as to his true whereabouts. It should be noted that Mr.
VARONA reérs to "Frank" as "Frank" because at one
point during the time that he was being handled by
"Frank", othzrwise known as Enrique, he instructed _
Mr. VARON: to introduce him to the Vasco de CUNHA
family as "Frank" Stevens, otherwise he had known
"Frank" und:r the name, Enrique. The basis for Mr.
VARONA sasing that he believed "Frank" mishandled
the WOFIRM program in many ways appears to be
vituperation plus frustration. The vituperation being
a basic ingredient in his opportunistic character.

b. Fe paragraph 5 of your memorandum of
11 June 196%.

That "F rank" had certain responsibilities
re Juanita Cistro is very true. "Frank" was funda-
mentally ressonsible for the defection of Juanita Castro
although Mr. VARONA furnished the lead. The '"Frank"/'
Juanita Cast:o relationship is now quasi-legendary. He
did not fumbe the very difficult handling of this contro-
versial persin. Mr. VARONA would have been in no
position to laow the load placed upon "Frank" by the
Agency in tring to gain operational mileage from Miss
Castro. Re-he information that "Frank" was in posses-
sion of infornation which could have resulted in the
assassination of Fidel Castro, the following comment |
must be mad: This refers to the Plan RAPHAEL which



/

involved Mr. FARONA's brother. "Frank" was not
the Case Offz:er on this operation, although he had
originally re:ruited Mr. VARONA's brother in Cuba
prior to his ixfiltration, The Case Officer for the
RAPHAEL overation, if one considers that there was
a case offices, would have been Stephen P. Mangello.

-Re Mr. VAFONA's charge that five of his family went to

jail in Cuba and four of his friends ''went to the wall" in
Cuba becaute of the shortcomings of "Frank," “F yank" has
the following specifically to say in rebuttal:

'VAEONA was continuously admonished from
the time of ‘Hs arrival in the U.S. in March 1962 to
be discreet roncerning his connection as well as his
relatives! cmnection with the Agency. It was common
knowledge ix. the exile community that VARONA and
his family vere dedicating their lives to the overthrow
of Castro. No member of VARONA's family was
molested by Castro until the exfiltration of VARONA's
brother in 264. VARONA's brother left a wife and
two childre1 behind and later within a period of three
months initated divorce proceedings. VARONA's
brother anc probably his wife, and possibly other
members o: the family knew of Plan RAPHAEL. It
would be cult, if well nigh impossible, to ascertain
who could jzve been the cause of the arrest of members
of VARON£!s family, since besides the family members,
other agems who were also involved in this Plan were
arrested aiapproximately the same time. Re the four
friends "wie went to the wall," this appears to be sheer
embellishnent on the part of Mr. VARONA."

c. Re paragraph 6 of your memorandum of
11 June 19:4:

and, who-v cks directly for "Frank" is oné_Joa

a pte

Mr. VARON: is not informed on other Station
operations, 10 it is understandable that in his
attempt to bing attention to himself that he

would focus m those things he is aware of.

Mr. VARON3's opinion of Mr. SANGENIS and

his handling of money is his own opinion. The
Station's viev is that it is lamentable that Mr.
VARONA, over the years, did not show the same
amount of personal dedication to getting the job
done that M:.. SANGENIS has shown. Again, it
appears to bz one more vituperative allegation
which has litle basis, based on information so far
provided by Mr. VARONA. einer

d. ®e paragraph 7 of your memorandum of
11 June 196%

*WARONA was in fact the messenger sent
by "Frank''vo the person who was going to conduct
the exfiltration of "F rank" and several.co-workers
in June 1961. He did not, as he suggests, have a
prime or oxanizing role in this exfiltration which
was, in faci, handled by the! |family,

as wad\truein "Frank's case.

e. la paragraph 8 of your memorandum of
11 June 196": j :

x is truethat Mx, VARONA is a good
friend of théVasée de C family. He got to
know this fariily when VAs¢oL XKO-was Ambassador
to Cuba. Tic Ambassador gave }im asylum. during the
BATISTA p:riod, and this formdd basis of their’
friendship. From time to time over the years, the



Agency fount it useful to use this friendship as a
means of coitrolling Mr. VARONA when he became
unmanageabe.

f. Ke paragraphs 9 and 10 of yor memorandum
of 11 June 1/69:

Ve know thaty
at least one trticle fx VIDA 7
information. however, to effect that he is being
at all succe:sful in re-esjdbhishing and/or revitalizing
the old "Autmtico" Party. Giken his unfavorable
reputation irthe Cuban community, it is unlikely that
he would enjy any success in this endeavor.

g. Te paragraph 11 of your memorandum of
11 June 196%:

44 should be noted: that Mr. Osortoy DAVILA,-.—~
presently livng in Miami, is thé brothecvuf a prominent
Communist in Cuba today and should be viewed in that
light. “Fraik's'' recollection of the situation involving
servants ant the ASPRU home, which he took over with
the servants. does not jive with Mr. VARONA's report.
There were «vo white and two black servants in the
house. -The sight of the Bay of Pigs invasion, the Cuban
Internal Ser-ice sent agents to the ASPRU home to pick
up "Frank.' One colored and one white servant were at
home at thattime and they told the DSE agents that
"Frank" war "a gay blade'' and would not be home until
early the ne:= morning. The DSE left the residence
leaving behind a note for "Frank'' to report to their
headquarter: the following morning. In this context,
it should be 1vted that "Frank's" cover in Cuba during
the period ix.question was that of a professional gambler;
a cover whic: served him well during most of his service
there,

h, Ee paragraph 12 of your memorandum of
11 June 196*:

&) "Frank" has no knowledge of the material
referred to. A further check will be made to determine
if this information was passed to "Pepe" who vo uld have
made it avaZable to the Station.

(:) This material apparently was passed to
"Pepe" and subsequently analyzed by the Station. DSE
personalities were carded. Mr. VARONA's statement
that "Frank" did not properly utilize the information
again appears to be another vituperative attempt to eee
strike at "Fsank" who he apparently blames for his
downfall witi the Agency.

&), (4), (e), (£). No Comment.

‘@), (h), (i), Gj). This is probably completely
fabricated material. Nevertheless because of its rather
sensational zature, the Station would be interested in
receiving trie copies of this material so that it can be
analyzed in He light of specific, positive collection,
evidentiary material at hand. It would also be appreci-
ated if your zffice could glean the source.or sources of
this alleged? sensational material.

be sheer fatxication. oes

z. If you read the foregoing analysis in the light of Mr.
VARONA's file, I bzlieve you will clearly ascertain that we
put little, if any, cmfidence in any statements made by Mr.
VARONA. We are deeply troubled, however, by the fact that
Mr. VARONA has used one Mr. Charles GOV:
of getting to the er*nent American citizeh Mr. Wi
who in turn used his good offices to establish contact with you.
We consider it highty important to determine whether Mr>
has any current comection with Cuban intelligence and to that
end, we have urgeniy requested from the Bureau any and all
current information bearing on the matter. Although Mr.
VARONA cannot provide Cuban intelligence through Mr. GOVEA
anything really curzent, he could albeit unwittingly provide a
tremendous amount of information dealing with Agency modus
operandi which we vould not like them to have. This becomes
quite important in view of the fact that we have several indications
of aggressive DGI/TN operations to gain information on the AMOT
as well as our AMC3AFT operations.

3. Your pa:agraph 15 clearly reveals the fact that
VARONA has an ax: to grind and he has chosen this way of
reingratiating hims:<f with the Agency by passing information
on "Frank" the man who handled him for the longest period of
time. For tactical yolitical reasons you may deem it wise to
“receive his report: under no circumstances, however, would '
we want this to be wed as a bridge to become involved in again
with a man in whose integrity or objectivity we have no confidence
whatsoever. To rexerate re the previous paragraph, we are most
concerned about GCTEA and if we can develop any current infor-
mation on Mr. GOVEA's contacts with Cuban intelligence, we
believe it will be ne:essary to get some word to Mr. Guest to
disengage himself f::m contact with this person.



4. This menorandum has not been completely researched.
It is suggested, how-ver, that you forward it with your memorandum
of 11 June 1969 to yiur office so that this matter may be placed in

perspective.

5. I would eppreciate notification when you forward your
memorandum to you Headquarters as I would like to furnish a
copy simultaneously along with my analysis of the situation. I
appreciate your pranptness in bringing the VARONA/GOVEA

contact to my attention.
