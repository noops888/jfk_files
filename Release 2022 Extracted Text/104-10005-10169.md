Ss surmise that the references in CSW ALD's 9 November
letter to a coun who had elnce- been replaces most refer te: Cuban’ *
Cenaul Eusebig HZOUZ, who left Mexice for Cube on permanent
transfer on 18 November 1963, four days before the axsassination.
A2OUS hed been in Mexico for 1@ years and { wag known a8 early
! as September 1963 that \ QUE was te be replaced.» His replacement
H did arrive in September. 4. QUE was scheduled to leave in Cetobar
: but did not leave until 18 Nevember.

We do not know who might have told Of 4LD that 4 SQUE
or any other Cuban had been or was to be replaced, but we
epeculate that Slivia Duran or some Soviet official might have
mentioned it if Cf% ALD complained about 4 200 ©
with him.
