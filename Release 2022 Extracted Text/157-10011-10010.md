QCCURRENCE? »1 Special Group heard Mr. Merchant state his opinion that the only

solution is to move the Guatemalan train activities to the United States even though
the U. S. could probably not get away with this either. A number of alternative
base sites for the training of the Cubans was considered both in the United States,
in Puerto Rico, or in the Panama Canal zone. Mr. Douglas
felt the "U. S. capability for intervention in Cuba will probably not be effective
enough unless there is more overt participation than has been contemplated to date." -
"Mr. Grey supported this general position, stating that when the current Cuban

plan was approved, the situation in that country was different than it is now.

Since then, the Cubans have received sizeable amounts of bloc arms and have or~
ganized a malitia. Mr. Gray wondered how a few hundred exiles could be."

"Mr. Mann expressed the opinion that the way to proceed is to seal Cuba off from

the rest of Latin America and settle down for a one- or two-year wait..."

Lansdale states, "On October 30-31 for an 'Eyes Only’ back-
ground memorandum requested by Rosgwell Gilpatric, information was requested
from CIA on the current status of all operations. CIA reported all militant
operations have been ordered held at a stop, although the volatile Cubans
were frustrated and not under complete control. The Matahambre operation mo

ao was not mentioned by the CIA in reporting in operational teams inside Cuba, ae

oo although I asked for specifics on militant teams inside. Two action teams
CIA reported as being inside Cuba were described as in place only collecting
intelligence, not actions, (sabotage,etc. )*

(OCCURRENCE: President Kennedy's visit to Mexico greatly enhanced U.S. goodwill in
;- Mexico. It fulfilled U.S. plans to impress upon Castro that Mexico is solidly with the
United States and the West. State believes this should ease the way for future discussions
about Cuba with the Mexicans. Re: Operation MONGOOSE, the joint communique issued by
President Kenedy and President Lopez Mateos included a phrase which was 'They proposed

to respect and maintain the principles of non intervention--whether this intervention

-may come from a continental or extracontinental state--and of self-determination of
“~peoples.'' In response to a Lansdale query, the Department of State noted that ''There

. were no developments resulting: from the President's trip to Mexico including the text

of the joint United States-Mexico communique which alter, the basic guidelines which govern
the Cuba Project." Lansdale noted that the CIA now hadiils iansmin Havana operating.

In addition there are agents and teams in the provinces. "Voice of Cuba"! broadcasts from
the U.S. Navy submarine were successful. ‘It is noted that UPI carried this news item

but spiced it up with added stories of Castro's use of militia against guerillas in Pantarzas.

* McCone explained the situation which has resulted in a group led by
Senor, ehWacquiring B-26's which are now in Costa Rica prepared to conduct a bombing
raid on Cuba. The group discussed a draft State Department cable to various Latin
American embassies related to this incident. It was agreed that the point should be
made in the cable that any such contemplated raid would be premature at this time. Dis-
association of the United States from any such endeavor was to be accomplished by leaking
_ stories of the impending raid to the press.
