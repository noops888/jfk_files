Origin and Development of Beheiren ts
(1) Founding: Beheiren was organized in
April 1965, nominally as a politically inde-
pendent group of intellectuals and cultured

- persons whose’ purpose was "to help restore
peace in Vietnam." Actually, it is a loosely
organized group of ex-Japan Communist Party _
(JCP) members, progressive intellectuals, ete

-. leftist. cultured persons, and leftwing students -
banded together in the namé of opposition to the.
Vietnam War by two common. denominators; dedicated
anti-Americanism and refusal to be dominated or
controlled by the orthodox JCP. z Le

(2) Hard-Core Secretariat: The real force
behind the organization of Beheiren has been

.a brillant Communist named YOSHIKAWA Yuichi,
whose conspiratorial organizational Skills have .
been perhaps the most indispensable ingredients
in Beheiren's development.” YOSHIKAWA was expelled
from Tokyo University for his role as an All-

‘Japan Federation of Student Self-Government

N.S.~Japan Security Treaty riots, He then went
. “into full time JCP mass movement professional
work, becoming the Secretariat official in
‘charge of international relations for the Japan
Peace Committee. YOSHIKAWA broke with the JCP :
“in late’ 1964, following the rupture in relations’ -
_ between the JCP and the Communist Party of the :

S7>~Soviet Union (CPSU) in May that year. The inspir-

ation for Beheiren springs in large measure fron
YOSHIKAWA's personal desire to use his organiza-
tional talents “in countering the JCP and its
Japan Peace Committee. YOSHIKAWA, in addition
to being a well qualified English linguist him-
self, years ago surrounded himself with a small
following of similarly qualified lieutenants,
whom he brought along into Beheiren to give him
the necessary depth and experience -to run this
new organization. YOSHIKAWA functions as
Beheiren's Secretary General.

ee ty

+3) Respectable Intellectual Front: Following”
{fundamental Communist principles for mass move-
ment work, the ex-JCP organizers of Beheiren:-<*3-
kept themselves ‘in the background and lined up
_@ humber of prominent Japanese progressive

- intellectuals and leftist cultured persons to"
front for Beheiren. The choice of ODA Makoto,
ex-Fulbrighter and popular young novelist, jto +.
_, be the Chairman was a fortunate move for Ree
:. Beheiren... ODA has_ taken to this front work

_ like a duck to water. It has given him a

chance to give unbridled vent to his own latent’
anti-American feelings, puffed him up to the ~~
extent that he has been dubbed "the emperor" |
by other Beheiren activists, and given him at
long last an ideological mission to pursue. ie
-. YOSHIKAWA has one magnificently in feeding
ODA's ego needs and in. infusing and indoctrin;
ting ODA so that his words and actions take
sufficiently: virulent anti-American overtones,
/ ODA has seryed another vital function for
Beheiren by “recruiting a. sizable number of
fellow intellectuals. to join the ranks of
Beheiren activist; (See paragraph 4 for a
listing. of a: number. of those Japanese who have
been identified as active lean supporters
or sympathizers.) = ;

~ . (4), Organizational Development: In its two:
. and one-half year history, Beheiren has not *

changed appreciably its organizational format,

although it has moved its office three times :

‘and modified its'name even oftener., Beheiren

is not a "mass organization," because it has

had no sizable- popular backing to the present

, time.. Its.hard core, secretariat organization

is run by: YOSHIKAWA and his lieutenants, ‘Its

public image,-intellectual front is led by ODA,

and given body by a score of like-minded intel- |.

- lectual friends of ODA and YOSHIKAWA, who form ~

~ the loose body of Beheiren's activist leadership,

. Under this Beheiren leadership superstructure’

lies a base of only several hundred Beheiren |

"rank-and-file" supporters, mostly young Japanese

:, students. Organizationally, Beheiren has no

. formal membership system, so its base of support~__

ers is fluid and not precisely measurable,

However, the base support for Beheiren has

’

SECRET =.

definitely been ‘on the upswing during 1967, and
made such notable strides during the past summer
that JCP Headquarters officials finally felt:
constrained to note with concern that Beheiren
was .beginning to drain off a growing number of
progressive youth who otherwise would have been
absorbed into the JCP's own youth movement,
Beheiren leaders have tried to help this growth
along by. setting up a youth section, calling it.
"Young Beheiren." Beheiren's imaginative actions
and publicity-conscious programs have been Benito
responsible for its recent growth, and this nee
period of growth seems to be now on the verge
of really gaining momentum, As a result of its
role in the case of the four deserting. sailors,
Beheiren has reaped bountiful publicity, has
succeeded in touching-a delicate Japanese’ public.
_merve.of sympathy and pacifism, opening a flood-
ce gate of support for Beheiren from all over Japan,
When this'case fades from the limelight, it is
still most likely that a fair percentage of the
current wave of popular support for Beheiren
?Will. solidify into permanent mass backing,
-giving Beheiren, for the first time, a tei
ful base to support its future activities,

(5) Activities ‘and Accomplishments: Beheiren
has engaged in a number of propaganda actions,
and participated in international anti-Vietnam
War activities. It has tried to cooperate with
certain front activities in Japan controlled by
the JCP, most notably the Japan Committee to
‘Investigate War Crimes in Vietnam activities,’
which culminated in the Tokyo Court of August
1967, but has been soundly and rudely rebuffed
by the JCP, In spite of this, Beheiren has
churned’ along at its own pace, with a continu-
ing series of anti-Vietnam War actions, most of :
~them related in some way to the American pacifist ~
movement, In this regard, Beheiren has. succeeded
in cornering a virtual monopoly on Japanese
“ contacts with U.S. pacifist movements and
effectually capitalized on this to.promote its
own action program, The case of the four
deserting sailors, while an apparent lucky . e 3
windfall for Beheiren, only points up the fact Hee : ait
that Beheiren, through past organizational work i
and promotional activities, was ready and capable | r

(unique in Japan in this regard) to take the
ball and run“with it. Beheiren ran all the way
and scored its most notable success since it was
organized. (Paragraph 5 contains a listing of
Beheiren's more notable activities since its.
founding. Paragraph,6 is a partial listing of
fordigners who have been in contact with or
cooperated with Beheiren.) . 4s

b. The Case‘of the Four Sailor Deserters and
Behsizen

(1). How It Started: The consensus of all Ne
-available press reports, with no recorded dissent’
indicates that the four sailors voluntarily left
their ship, went AWOL, and ended up wallowing
around Tokyo's hippie-land. Precisely what
personal grievances prompted the four to embark
on this misadventure is not known. But, up to
this point, the four could fairly be categorized
as misguided youngsters, gone astray in a foreign
land, and due to get slapped back in line with
traditional Navy justice. when they finally
decided to stop the fun and go back to the ship.
So far, this made their case far —— unique.

(2) How It Became an Incident: ‘Instead of
returning to their ship of their own volition
or being apprehended by the Shore Patrol, the
four made contact with Beheiren leaders. Again,
press reports indicate that this was just a
goincidence, that there was no pre-planning by
“the four to contact Beheiren. There is no
available reporting that indicates otherwise.
But, once the Beheiren people made contact, they
. recognized. the potential Esra and moved
fast for, the kill, :

e (3) Beheiren Takes Over: When the four made
contact with Beheiren, it suddenly became an - Heaps
entirely different ball game. Beheiren had. a '
everything needed to capitalize on this:. veteran —~ ;
activist leaders who are experienced enough to
recognize the windfall that had come their way; H
an apparatus that could provide hiding -places i
for the four; long standing liaison contacts . {

propaganda potential (such as preparing a :
"movie film for the initial Beheiren press con- *
ference announcing the desertion, prepared more _

‘English speaking activists capable of sympathiz-
ing, encouraging, soothing, or agitating the
four young sailors, so that there Would be no
turning back, :

-. (4) The Beheiren Apparatus at Work: While seus
:many Of the small pieces of this puzzle, which
- would put the whole case in proper detailed
+ .y-, Chronological order and eliminate speculation

on minor points, are still missing, the follow-
“’ ing elements,. all part of the ‘Beheiren appardtus,
make up the bulk of the picture: $

BT (a)? ‘Hide-out: | When Beheiren oe hold of
the four on 26 October, they had to be

* hidden out for the approximate two week

, period until their exit from Japan could
be arranged, This presented Beheiren no °
great logistical problem. A number of :
the Beheiren activist leaders have homes
well suited to harboring fugitives. For 7
example, Beheiren activist eee a —
Mitsusada has a villa hidden away in =
Chigasaki, which was used on the night of

. 12 September for a meeting of about 20 top
“Beheiren leaders, and which would be highly |
suitable for hiding the four deserters. —

. Other private dwellings, belonging to
Beheiren. leaders and loyal supporters, are
‘scattered throughout: both the Kanto (Tokyo) ~
and Kansai (Osaka, Kobe, Kyoto) areas,

(b) Beheiren-Soviet Liaison: Beheiren |
Secretary General YOSHIKAWA has maintained
periodic contact with Soviet Embassy
officials for years. Beheiren Chairman

ODA has met Soviet Peace Committee officials
in Moscow, In the case of the four sailors,
- information provided by a reliable sensitive
source has clearly established that both

up.in Moscow on 20 November, The press has: -

speculated,widely and unanimously thatthe four

‘left Japan on the Soviet passenger ship BAIKAL -

‘on 11 November, Again, there is no dissenting

, opinion, overt or covert, The only mystery

. concerning this final phase of the Japanese

portion of this case concerns the mechanics of .

: how the four boarded the BAIKAL and who assisted
in the maneuver, - But with the sailing of the
BAIKAL from Yokohama, Beheiren completed its

-most highly successful and beautifully executed
activity in its two and one-half year history.

, Not: only did Beheiren smear the United States

Government's image in Japan, gain a vast amount

of priceless publicity that will swell the ranks

of. its supporters and be invaluable in future
