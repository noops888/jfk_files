1, LIBNVOY reported that on 6 February 1970 Valery KOSTIKOV (201-
305052), 2nd fecretary of the Soviet Embassy in Mexico, received:a long-
distance tolephone call from Guatemala, The operator asked for KOSTIZOV
by name, then told the caller “Hr. HONTENEGKO, I have your call to Hezico
ready". hen KOSTIKOV came to the phone, the caller stated he was call-
ing on behalf of the Guatemalan University Students Organization, but did
Bot further identify hinself. The caller and KOSTIKOV discussed the USSR
} mational soccer team and its scheduled appearance in-Guaterala, EOSTIZOV
gtated he was not certain exactly what date the teas was scheduled to
arrive in Guatemala, ard suggested that the caller contact the soccer
federation in El Salvador, where the team.would be playing prior to its
argival in Guatezala. The caller also inquirod whether there was any in-
formation on the Ballet. (Reference) end was told that there was noac.

2. Yt should be poted that normally queries concerning the Sevict
soccer team or the appearance of 2 Russias Ballet troupe would be
handled by one of tho Cultural or Sports Affaire officers of the Embassy.
KOSTIEOV's participation in these matters, .e5. reported above, would seem’ ~}
to confira previous Station reporting that KOSTIKOV handles dealings be-
tween the Soviet Embassy in Mexico and Guatemalan leftist organizations.

the reporting period, Yach reeting date is established at
the preceding meeting and no furthor contact or confirmation is
required, LICOWL-1 arrives by bus at a car pick-up point and
is then driven by the case officer to a small coffee shop
where ho reviews his diary with the case officer. Due to the
nature of his job and the level of his access, LICOWLel is not
in a position to do nore currently than to report on the brief
encounters he has with MIIHARSHZers who come into his store, IMis
reports normally consist of his assessment of- personalitics,
description of new arrivals and, occasionally, biographic
information he has becn’able to pick up.- He. also gives. tinely
reports of demonstrations and other unusual activity in the
vicinity of the MHEAKSH installation,

d, LIEWPTY-3; LIEMPTY-3 is met at irregular intervals at
various out-of-the-way restaurants for tho purpose of briefing
and debriefing on operational assignments and discussion of his
written reports, Meetings are arrenged by phone using open
code, His most recent assignnent has. eon the “developnent,
assessment, and recruitment of 201-810981, LIESPTY-3 has few
peers at the art of developing an operational lead, but his
extensive operational activity in past years against the LEHARSI
target has required that he be uscd sparingly, selectively,
and always under alias, Development of 201-810981 has been
his only assignment during the reporting pericd, and LIEDTY-3
made good early progress, Purporting to.be the representative
of a film club for architects, LIEMPTY-3 was able to get 201-
810981 to agree to become a consultant, Thereafter, LIEPTY-3
continued to ask questions about 201-81C981's work, te the point
where 201-810981 realized that more than a film club for
architects was involved, At this point it was decided to-let
LIEWPTY-3 break cover, recruit 201-810981 to supply information
on the work of his office (but not--at this point--the people
in his office), and continue to handle. him. until the recruitment
was firm and previous questions about the stability and

reliability of 201-S10981 had been resolved, This was done,
and 201-S10981 accepted recruitment, knowing that WOLADY
intelligence was involved. LIEPTY-3 teld several meetings with
201-8169S1 after recruitment, and countersurveillance.did not
reveal any signs of MHHARSH surveillance, For about a month,
however, LIENPTY-3 hus not. been able to contact 201-810981,,

and it is possible that. the latter. has developed cold fect.

handle this case for the timc being, Ii he is unable to
reestablish contact, he will be given another 1 to follow

up. LISNPTY-3'is a very active person vho has an extremely

full business day, with many. contac The Station. belicves
that within ‘this busy “cover” 1ifé;“LIEPry-3 can handle
selected operational tasks without coming to hostile attention,
As long as proges wceuciiy precautions wre taken oy aim in wis
operational activities, and by hin and the Statioa officer al
(who ueets hin if alias) in thdir meetings, there is no reason |
why LIE’PTY-5 cannot be a useful part-tine contributor to the -
Station's REDTUP progran for the foreseczble future,

e. LIRCCKET=1:

1) LIROCKET-1 is met monthly, tine and place arranged
at the previous meeting, During these uectings he is debricfed
on his twice-weekly teaching rcessions at the MIHARSH Embassy.
His regular student has becn the Subject of 201-028975, and he
has had occasional dealings with other IIiARSHers, particulerly
AESEASICK, The meetings with 201-02°063 bave not been. of
particular interest, and we had been waiting impatiently for
the latter's replacement to arrive, so that LIROCKET-1 would
have a better target to work on, It was LINOCKET-1 who
came up with the first local confirmation of the identity of
this replacenent (MEXICO CITY 1105, 2 August 1969). Dealings
with AKSDASICK have been concerned with attempts by the
director of the school where LINCCKET-1 teaches to borrow
sociological films from the MHIMARSH film office.

2) It now appears, however, that LIROCKET=1 has
feached the end of the line, For some tice he has‘been involved
in a rather messy divorce action, and in August LIROCKET-1
reported that his wife had denounced him to Mexican authorities
as an RVROCK agent (a few months previously,’ she had denounced
him as an MIARSH agent). LINOCKET-1 was not inclined.to take
his wife's.ravings too seriously sinco he- considered her slightly
nuts, However, LIENVOY reported that on 16 September 1969
LIRNOCKET-1's wife called 201-028975 and told him'she had to see h:
urgently on something of extreme interest about her husband,
201-028975 told hex to come to tho Ebassy, which she did, and
she presumably repeated her accusation, Since that tine,
LIROCKLT~1 has received a polite brush-off. He has been told
that the HNNARSH Embassy has run out of funds for English -
language training, and that there would. -be..no. more “lessons . >
unless. 201-028975's replacement, ox the nev Awbassador (when
and if. one arrives). wanted to rehiro him. He was told,
however, to check in xegularly, and he was given,°as usual,
an invitation to the annual MHHARSH national day reception (he
did not attend because he was ill). LIROCKET-1 has not spoken
with 201-028575 since his wife's visit--all dealings have been
through AEPOLYP, who has for some time been the paymaster for
LIROCKET-1.

3) LIROCKET~1 was not aware of his wife's visit, and
even after the case officer, without telling him that we knew
of the visit, brought LIROCKET-1 around to the conclusion that
she might have done this, he still does not think that she
spilled the beans to 201-028975,. (It is apparent that the
MHHARSHers, whether or- not they believe Mrs. LIROCKET=1's
story, have concluded that LIROCKET-1 represents a-security.
hazard, and they are sinply going to drop him, LIROCKLT-1
will continue to press the MHHARSHers for an answer regarding
his future with them, and if, as suspected, they keep putting
him off, he will be instructed to break contact. and he will be
terminated by the Station.)

4) Other than the blowing of LIROCKET-1 himself,
little damage has been done, The wife has never seen the current
case officer and knows none of the meeting .arrangenents -or-.other

in which Subject of 201-505870 resides, He-.maintains a daily
log of the movements and activitics of this and other IUIARSiers,
and he reports the license plates and description of visitors
to the building, Ho was met weekly for a total of 12 tines,
always in a small restaurant within walking distance of the
downtown office where he works a half day. Nceting hours aro
pre-arranged. to permit LISACK-4 to attend on the way to or
from this second job, He compensates for his lack of formal
education by responsiveness to case officer direction, natural
intelligence and cooperation,

i. LISACK-6: He is the portero of the building in which
Subjects of 201-837203 and 201-788861 (who took the apartment
of Subject of 201-205304) reside. He maintains a daily log
of these two MIHANSHers, their families and visitors. He was
met 12 times during the ‘period. Since he-cannot.be absent fron
the building for over thirty minutes without arousing suspicion,

“ meetings are always for a brief ten minutes and are held ina

nearby’ park. As has been reported, the case officer who handles
LISACK-6 became the target of unknown surveillance in August,
and again in October, following meetings with LISACK-6, Thc
Station believes that the surveillance was accidental, in that
the meeting place was in a neighborhood frequented by *nale and
female prostitutes and other undesirable characters. In any
event, LISACK~6 has been put on ice, to be revived if the
occupants of his building become higher priority targets.

j. LISACK-7:, She was not met during the reporting period.
She remains a “reserve asset" for special requirements in the
real estate field for such potential uses as safehouse rental,

‘key acquisitions and locating tenants when needed. Although

there is: no immediate requirement for her talents, we would.
like to maintain her Operational Approval so that she can be
called on as a cleared asset when needed.

There are no problems connected with this Project,

‘here are no known unresolved probleas of security, The

security problens relating to LINOCKET-1 asd LISACK-C (diecussed
above) Are under control vith no adverse “eficcts noted.

Plans

a. There are several assets ‘of the REDTOP section who
have been carried uncer SB/COA for a fairly lng period of
time. Since the targets of their access:chango fron time to
time, as well as the nature of the information they provide,
we do not believe they warrant special or new projects to
cover ther. We do believe, hovever,.that they cbould be
brought under a project to facilitate orderly reporting and
administration without resorting to separate progress reports
on each,

b, Since their activities closely parallel those of
assets already covered by LISACK, we belicve it would be
logical to include LIRODBIN-1 and -2, LIORDER-1 and Subject

of 201-643659 (on whoa we are awaiting an Operational Approval)
in this Project. Although none of these is paid a salary,

such a change will require some cost amendment to the Project
to account for minor operational expenses which have heretofore
been charged to SB/OJA. Separate correspondence will follow
on these assets.

¢, There are several additional assets currently in the
devolopmental stage who may eventually be administered under
LISACK. ‘These include Subject of HMMA-37742 of 28 August 1969,
targetted against AEPOLYP; Subject of 201-351552, targetted
against AEMERGER; Subject of 201-848881, currently in sccial
contact with Subjects of 201-259563 and "201-02: 20063 under
Station direction; and Subject * 201-859225, who reports on
his-contacts with Subjects of 201-305052 and 201-744341,
among othcr MUHARSHers.

SOVIET EXBASSY IN MEXICO HAS LARGE
STAFF WHICH DOES LITTLE WORK

by Carlos Montiel

Source: Ls Prensa Libre (Free Press), 6 May 1969, San Jose,
Mexico City ‘-- In.a letter addressed to our editorial

department Peruvian. newsmen informed me that, being acquainted...
i with my article “Ahora Peru" [Now Peru], they asked that country's
chancellor, Edgardo Jarrin, whether the arrival of a Soviet trade
mission in Peru would be only the prelude to another more important
“mission, that of Soviet diplomatic representation. ...... .
In that article Tpobsorved that members of the Soviet’
: embassy in Mexico City had predicted in that city's social eee
: circles that in less than 2 weeks Peru would establish diploratic
relations with the Kremlin at the embassy level.
7 a “ kecording to the letter, barely 3 days later the Lima daily
ots La Prensa confirned with prominent play the report that I had made i

". in El Universal Grafico whose substance I had obtained thanks to
the. indiscretion of Soviet diplomats’ included. in the "cocktail
circuit" organized here among the ambassadors and trade representatives,

of foreign countries.

huge mansion that could serve as a den of vampires? The mystery
deepens if one considers that the Mexican embassy staff in Moscow
barely numbers six or seven employees whereas the USSR has more
than a hundred in Mexico. Why does the Soviet Union have such a
large erioassy staff in our country se it does what ours does in
Hoscow?" :

Bil wee ey,

’ This is the amusing story of a "spree" which began in

the frosty dawn of 12 December among bubbles of expensive

sh wines in the "red light" district of Mexico City and reached <

its conclusion very far off, at Ciudad Victoria. what are
‘involved are two Marxist-Leninists froz the,Soviet Union who,
on breaking, the chains of disgraceful tyranny weighing on
Yrespectable diplomats, “tanked up" in tourgeois bars, not in
order to cheer up and forget some sorrowful episode or other
“abuse and insults at Mexico and Mexicans under the pretext . .
y that when ore is "tipsy™ everything thet he does is absolved.
‘The diplomats of the Russian embassy in Mexico, Valery .
Kostikov, second secretary, and Vladislav Koromovshxin, attache,

‘not only forgot among hippies thessociaiist ethics in order to

indulge in a “small drink among those who are in the limelight" ~



but, in the midst of a tig "binge™ made possible by hateful

capitalist brandy and whiskey, they decided to accomsany four

4  eurincers of PEMEX [Petroteos Mexicanos; Mexican Petroleux} in
ae
F + an old automobile to Ciudad Mante. On the way, after the

custozary excesses that alcoholic fumes provoke, the "wine™
drove the Hussians to the worst extremes of crudeness exidiic.
without any of the "academic bearing" that the Frier.dship
University of Moscow notes as the major assets acquired by the
progressive men of Leninism. Accordingly, abuse rained on
the Mexicans. . a

.. The four PEMEX. engineers, as any well-born sons would

have done, defended their country with firmness. Thereupon,
the Xussians suddenly became transformed into diploxat-gunmen; *
brandishing their weapons at the engineers. However, no douct *
because Russians are better at getting ready to handle remote-
“-eortrolled spaceships directed at the moon.than.in the skillful
discharge of prosaic pistols, they found themselves.disarmed ‘>

ae short oraet by the Mexicans.

On reaching, Ciudad Victoria the PEYEX engineers handed
“the Russian attaches and their guns over to the local authorities.

Despite the unanimous desire of all those present to see the

Soviet representatives get their comeuppare e the latter, with

insult ia, arromance, insisted that their diplomatic eal ‘te

respected,

with the Chinese government of Mso Tse-tunz se insistent on.

2, It ls interesting to noze that LICOWL-! describes KOSTIKOV as follows:
He Is a man who would do anything to anybody, He ts without morals, education
or manners, H+ uses foul language and has no respect for others, When
KOSTIKOV drinks at his (LICOWL-I's) escablishment, with Sovlet women present,
KOSTIKOV will run his hand over the legs of the wives of other Soviet employees,
while thelr husbands are present, and thinknozhing of it, According to LICOWL-1,
the husbands say nothing when KOSTIKOV does this, (Comment: However, from
a recent LICOWL-lI tape, It appears that Yurly Aleksandrovich ANDRIANOV,
GRU chauffeur, was complaining to Viktor Petrovich KALININ, administrative
employee, that his wife was running around with KOSTIKOV and he ||
was golng to say-something-to KOSTIKOV - cient ‘but had not said a word to »
him as yet.)

Valerly Vladimtrovich KOSTIKOV, =.
- Valerly Vladimirovich KOSTIKOV Is approximately 35 years of age,
corpulent and paunchy, with a rouad somewhat fleshy face that sports a
“$5 o'clock shadow, and wears oversized tinted glasses in dark heavy frames,

- >. which partially obscure a palr of small, but plercing eyes. His heavy jowla,

- Intimate frlends,

AN 1% HAMA 2551 b..

phigh et gt

thin lips, wide nostrils and dark hair add to an ipresston that his features

_ are more of a Semitic, or a Near-Eastern type than that of a Slav, A
shapeless dark sult-coat, carelessly put over a white shirt, with unbuttoned
collar, through which protrudes a <uft of dark hair complete a photograph of

‘ Valerly Viadimirovich KOSTIKOV, Attache ot the Consular Office and

_ Identifted member of the KGB, ce i

KOSTIKOV arrived in Mexico In December 1961 and assumed his duties:
. 8 an attache at the USSR Coasulate at the Soviet Embassy tn Mexico City.
Owing to his extrovert nature and. propensity for drinking, he soon acquired ae
: Several “buddles" of simUar background and with similar tastes, Among

these individuals, his closest assoclates have

en, or still-are, the following: *
itally Bortsovich SHUBIN, Attache and Identified member of the KGB, who
left for the USSR in July 1964; Ivan Gavrilovich ALFERIYEV, Pravda Corres-
: pondent and KGB officer, who left for the USSR tn October 1964; and Oleg
- Maksimovich NECHIPORENKO, Vice-Consul and Idearified member of the Kes,
who Is stlll In Mexico, and who has accepted KOSTIKOV into his circle of

war corr Dore ge Sos



However, It was mostly with SHUBIN and. ALFERIYEYV that KOSTIKOV

: felt entirely at ease, Meny a time KOSTIKOV would talk to-elther one of

“ them en the phone and Indulge tn a friendly exchange of obscealtles, where-
as he has never spoken to NECHIPORENKO In a like: menner, even though

; .. KOSTIKOV has been a frequent guest at NECHIPORENKO's hotise, KOSTIKOV
» developed an exceedingly close relationship with SHUBIN, They used-to

travel together to varlous parts of the country and to spend time together

with thelr familles-at the Casino de la Selva, @ hotel In Cuernavaca, But

it was ALFERIYEV's wife Roza, who became the prime target of KOSTIKOV's

attentions, An embittered acrimontous woman, Roza, who despised her

i husband and had a flerce hatred for NECHIPORENKO, was transformed into

_ . a different human being when KOSTIKOV talked to her. on the phone In his

best unctuous and lngratlatlod manner, It is impossible ro say whether they

"had sexual relations, bat the obvious and stroag sexual overtones tn Roza's

voice led one to Presume that she had more than just-a friendly interest in

. KOSTIKOV, who on the other hand, was Liens using Roza as a target for :

his amorous or Ulicit aspirations,

Ik seems thay KOSTIKOV Is quite preoccupled with matters of sex and tf

ven an opportunity would turn Into a verttable profligate, Apparently his ©



wlhfe Roza has 2. tolerant.attlrude towards KOSTIKOV's probable inciur-
sons Into the domain of maital Infidelity, siice, on one occasion,
waen KOSTIKOY had been Invired to a supposed stag party at ALFERIYEV's.
~ home, and Roza KOSTIKOV had phoned to caution KOSTIKOV agalust

drinking too much, a womzn answered the call and then called KOSTIKOV

weet" i" - to the phone, When Roza talked to KOSTIKOV It sounded that she was more
peeved at the fact that she had not been invited to the party rather than that
other women were present there at the tlme,

When KOSTIKOV atarted talking to hls wife on thls particular call, he

already had had a few drinks and tn disguised votce spoke to her in Spanish,
French and English, posslbly to Impress those who were present. His
Spanish !s quite good and fluent, his French Is rather tolerable, but his
English ls somewhat stlited and of a school-room type, Possibly, he studied
. these languages at the Moscow Institute of Languages, :
_ This fluency in Spanish affords KOSTIKOV.a great latitude for ‘making *
frlends among Mexicans and-his easy-going earthy approach Is presumably
* of considerable hetp to him In developing contacts. Since his consular
“duties are quite negligible, he can easily engage In this sort of activity.
In fact, this neglect of officlal dutles prompted a heated argument between
"_ ; NECHIPORENKO and the visiting Soviet correspondent Timur GAYDAR,


who declared tha: ostensibly the constilar stafi does not preform any useful .
function, but just loats around, H‘s assertion has been confirmed in part

by the attitude of this particular group of Soviet Embassy employees, who
quite often seek some diversion of a non-Intellectual type.. Thus, on ‘one
occasion, when a group of Soviet touristhas a brlef stay tn Mexio, one of.
them - a woman, complained during a phone call to the Embassy that
KOSTIKOY and Leonid Vasilyevich NIKIFOROV, Intourtst representative

In Mexico, had taken the group leaders to NIKIFOROY's apartment ny

order to have a few drinks, leaving the rest of the tourlsts without any

, Information about thelr next move and letting them shift for themselves,

Since the departure of SHUBIN and ALFERIYEV, KOSTIKOY has starved
+ to “cultivate” NIKIFOROV, presumably as a potential drinking companion, .-..”-
and has been talking to him on the phone a number of tlmes recently tn quie
a famillar tone of voice, It seems that. NIKIFOROV, a younger:man, Is
being Influenced by KOSTIKOV toa certain degree. 7

_». KOSTIKOV's family life does no:appear.to be-a- stormy one} because bis’ -
ee wife Roza A, sounds easy~golng and friendly, She Is-in charge of the Embassy’:
: dining-room, Her co-workers treat her with a good-humored tolerance and
> | a slight contemp:. KOSTIKOV's daughter Svetlana, born in 1959, seems to

be an average child, who does not —— rt honing — to her



To sum:sartze KOSTIKOV's character traits and abilitles: KOSTIKO

1s.well trusted to take trips around the country In the company of ‘another :
Soviet Embassy employee on varlous matters of Importance and, on
occasions, ‘he acts as an Interpreter for visiting Soviet officials. His
known physical defect Is weak eyes, Sometime ago KOSTIKOV called. up

an eye-speciallst for an appolntment, because his eyes were troubling him

and that {s probably the reason for hls wearing tinted glasses. Sometimes
Mexicans refer to him 3s the man with glasses, It ts quite possible that an at
"auto accident KOSTIKOV had in’ Vera_cruz may have been caused by his

: somewhat defective vision and was not the result of carelessaess, ‘However, .
* when KOSTIKOV was excusing himself for it, GARMASHEV, to whom |
he spoke on the phone, told him dryly that tt was about time KOSTIKOV

learned to drive, : aa Grae

Owing to this shortcoming of having weak.eyes and his physical make

up, KOSTIKOV does not parttclpate In vartous Indoor or outdoor sports as
much as do other members of the Soviet Embassy, It seems that billlards -

* are about the most strenuous execise that he undertakes, However, it must

not be surmised that he Is a weak Individual In a physical sense and will
probably give.a good account of himself lf a situation will demand tt.
"Smoked"

. Maay of his tntimate collaborators call him "Kopchenyy” or



, standards forged ahead and became "somebodies",

” tain zest and bravado, It appears that he has no moral, religious, or

: “any other type of scruples. He Is vulgar, untidy and lecherous, with a

“In addition, it must be noted that he ts a shrewd and regourceful Individeal

which In Russlaa slang may-mean an individual with adark skin, or may :
refer to the fact of his wearing tinted glasses, or it may signify that he wenr
through a achool of hard knoc ka :

T Is quite certain that KOSTIKOV and ALFERIYEV belong to the 6 same

group of former hoollgans, wo by dint of sheer disregard: for mcral

KOSTIKOV seems to be quite unsrupulous, ready to perform any sort

of task set before him, not in a cold and methodical way, but with a cer-

penchant for using lewd and obscene expressions In conversation with

bis "buddies", with whom he drinks quite a lot. circumstances permitting,

unquestionably loyal to the Communist system,
