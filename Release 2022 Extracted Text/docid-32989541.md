A SubstantiveriSsues Regarding
the Future of the FBI

FROM:

Pursuant to our conversation earlier this week, I hereby
submit a list of issues that will undoubtedly be coming up from
time to time regarding the present and future status of the FBI.
This list is by no means exhaustive, but is a good starting point
from which to go forward and come to grips with many of the
problems that will have to be addressed in the near future in one
form or another. The list, in no particular order, is as follows:

|

1. Wiretaps. The whole question of wiretaps should be
reviewed with a view toward developing a firm Department-wide

policy on the issues involved.

(All the issues surrounding the appointment and tenure of the Director

should be explored. ) i

t
i 5., Should the FBI be an independent agency or continue as part
: lot the Justice Department? The pros and cons of this recurrent question
> should bé analyzed again with the purpose of adopting a firm policy.

| 4, Should the FBI Director be appointed for a term of years?

6. Assuming the FBI remains a part of the Justice Department,
what should be the relationship of the Director to the Attorney General?
All the organizational and substantive relationships should be examined.

I. Investigative techniques. The whole question of the variety
of techniques from clearly legal to clearly illegal should be examined
i in some detail. In addition, the question of authorization and
coe Congressional oversight should be touched upon in this examination.

8. The whole question of files and their disclosure must be
studied with a view toward understanding why files are kept, what
categories of files there are, what information is contained in the
files and whether the purposes for maintaining files are being met
under present policy. In the issue of disclosure, when, where, and
to whom must also be thoroughly examined.

9. The question of a Civilian Review Board for the intelligence
gathering activities of the FBI should be examined. This is a recurrent
. suggestion which came up at the Princeton conference in addition to
other forums.

10. What should be the relationship between the FBI and the other
Departments and Agencies. of the Federal Government? To what extent
should the FBI keep tabs ort,other Departments and Agencies through
the development of sources — in those Agencies ?

ll. Should the FBI have foreign officers reporting. directly to-—
the Director ? 7

This list is not exhaustive, but should get us started toward an
indepth examination of some of the problems facing the Bureau in the
future.

Reference is made to my memorandum to the Attorney General
August 7, 1973, captioned as above, which among cther things proposed
that an Executive order be issued which would define FBI responsibilities
concerning Federal statutes relating to the national security.

My memorandum made reference to new guidelines recently
issued in manual form and to a study which was prepared in August,
1972, at the request of Acting Director L. Patrick Gray, I.

On August 15, 1978, Mr. Jack Goldkiang, Office of Legal
Counsel, Department of Justice, called Mr. Nicholas P. Callahan's office
and referred to the guidelines and study mentioned above. He said that
these documents are likely to be pertinent to his analysis of the proposal
set forth in my memorandum, and he asked that the two documents be
made available to him.

For your information, the guidelines referred to are the
recently revised Section 87 of our Manual of Instructions concerning
Investigations of Subversive Organizations and Individuals. As you
know, our Manual of Instructions has not heretofore been disseminated
outside the FBI, although this particular Section (87) was loaned to ‘

of the Department by Senator Edward M. barren Ree. 77

“ISSUE: Should the Intelligence Gathering-Function of the PST
Be Separated From the Law Enforcement Function of the
FBI?

Note that the issue, as originally raised, referred
to law enforcement and intelligence functions. What was meant
by intelligence was the missions of internal security and
counterintelligence. Criminal’ intelligence, e.g., against
organized crime, was intended to fall within the law enforce-
ment mission. However, the functions of the FBI do not neatly
fall within "intelligence" and “law enforcement" categories.
Internal security cases are both intelligence and law enforce-
ment operations, and counterintelligence sometimes involves
eee arrests and prosecutions, i.e., law enforcement. To most
accurately reflect the diverse missions of the FBI the terms
law enforcem2nt, internal security, and counterintelligence
will be used eeeeeee this paper.

Preface

1. The Problem: revolves around the question whether the
three missions can be accommodated by one agency. That is,
finer in nature that an organizabional strna~

| - ture set up to perform one of the missions absolutely cannot

| perform the others; or can all three missions be accommodated

4 but’ only to the detriment of the others; or can all the missions
i be adequately performed by one agency?

are t

2. The Present Policy: is that all three missions are per-

4 : formed by the FBI. The FBI organizational structure is pri-
marily a unitary one, i.e., there is one organization with a
multiplicity of .responsibilities, .which can be broken down
into three general missions, law enforcoment, internal secu-
rity (domestic) and csunterintelligence (foreign), The
organization's personnel are hired and catalogued into one

of three general functional categories, agent, stend, and to
a lesser degree, clerks, without further differentiation base
on mission, i.e., no employees, with rare exceptions, are
criminal or counterintelligence specialists, all are gener-
alists and are regularly interchanged among the three general
missions. The administration of cases at headquarters and,

to a lesser extent, the conduct of investigations in the fielé
follow the same format in all three general areas of responsi-
bility.

“ eo

The underlying rationale for, and history behind,
these concepts is:

Personnel - the generalist allows for a highly
flexible, mobile force which can be deployed, generally sole}
on the basis of manpower needs, i.e., any agent can do -any
job in the FBI. There are some exceptions; some employees
have unique abilities which tend to make them less mobile in
the eyes of administrators, e.g., language or technical
factors in the case of agent deployment and promotion; they
are more determinative in cases of clerks: special employees,
translators, etc.

Administration of cases and conduct of investigation
these were originally geared to accommodate a relatively
criminal and civil investigative matters, and as the resp
bilities of the organization grew they were modified and adasted,
within the unitary structure, to accommodate the various
missions. Thus they are quite similar in all three missions.

“3, . The Issues Raised: al

a. Are the missions of law enforcement, internal
“ .. security, and counterintelligence separable?

b. If so, is complete separation possible, practical
or politically feasible or desirable?

c. Can the three missions be accommodated in one
organization?

d. By doing so, do any of the missions suffer?
e. If all three missions can be accommodated in

one agency, is the FBI currently doing it the
best way possible? ”

£. %If not, is it practically or politically feasi
‘ble or desirable to change the FBI's way of
forming the mission?

g. Why are other Western intelligence services
separate from law enforcement agencies?

4] NW 65360 Docld:32989541 Page 9



e®

eat Options for Future Policy:

The missions of law enforcement, internal security,
and counterintelligence are separate, distinct and distinguishable
functions, even though each partakes a little of each other. .
Law enforcement is investigation after a crime has been .committed
to identify suspects and build a, case for prosecution; counter-
intelligence is the identification, penetration and neutralization
of foreign intelligence activity in the U. S.; and internal
security is identification and thwarting of home-grown plots
to subvert the government and activities within the U. S. in
illegal support of foreign causes, eee by U. S. citizens
of foreigners. . . i

Paes

The missions overlap to some degree. For example,

law enforcement requires some intelligence collection, and is
intimately concerned with internal security criminal acts, e.g.,
foreign related terrorist bombings, skyjackings, gunning, and
subversive groups' kidnappings; bank robberies, bombings, etc.
Counterintelligence sometimes results in criminal prosecution,
and some internal security groups are funded by, and act on
behalf of, foreign intelligence services. Internal security is

My is for ite investigation is that ante nalitically
motivated, are. “being committed in violation of the U. S.
criminal law. Yet, the investigation may be a continuing effort,
based on continuing acts threatening the internal security
without actually violating the criminal law, and thus the investi-
gation is more like a counterintelligence investigation, than
like the typical law enforcement closed cycle of crime, investiga
and prosecution.

While counterintelligence could adequately, and
with. more success in some cases, be handled by an organization
totally separate from one with law enforcement powers, internal
security work, in many cases, is directly rélated to criminal
prosecution. There has been little effort, and less success,
in most English speaking Western democracies in prosecuting
domestic “subversives," even those with foreign ties; however,
prosecution is often a principal, if not primary, objective in
cases involving emigre bombing and harassment of foreign
diplomatic establishments, fund and arms procurement for
foreign political groups, politically motivated te:rorist
acts, e.g., skyjacking, etc.

NW 65360 Doctd:32989541 Page 10 7


| : An examination of the services of the democracies
mentioned above, viz., Britian, Australia and Canada, reveal
that all do distinguish between the pure law enforcement
function and the counterintelligence/internal security eco
function; however, there is not a total separation of the
functions. For example, the British Security Service (HI-5) |
handles counterintelligence exclusively with MI-5 case officers,
but places it's internal security investigations in the hands

of the Special Branches of the local constabularies (comparable
to the intelligence divisions of‘local U. S. police departments).
j The Australian Security Intelligence Organization (ASIO),
modeled after MI-5, and of recent vintage (post W.W.II),
handles all counterintelligence and internal security investi-
gation with its own officers; however, it is rivailed to some
extent in the internal security field by the Intelligence
Bureau of the national Commonwealth Police. The Royal

Canadian Mounted Police, a truly national police force, with
extensive local and Federal jurisdiction, has branched. off

its intelligence division into a new, near autonomous Security
Service, with operational procedures more akin to MI-5 and

j ASIO than to traditional law enforcement.

a In short, these countries recognize that the

; political, social and foreign policy considerations which :
must ao into counterintelligence and internal security investi-
gations make them a different animal from "routine" criminal
investigation; yet, they also recognize that the agency with
internal-security jurisdiction must also have an intimate

and close working relationship with a law enforcement agency.

: Complete separation, at least of the internal security
function from law enforcement, does not appear to be

a’ ‘gjpractically feasible. MI-5 and ASIO were oviginated without

oY ow Jlaw enforcement powers, and MI-5 candidly admits it would
oh ela P fi : y
ys like to become part of a national police force. _RCMP Security
wet Service case officers would not consider surrendering their
ca police powers. 7

nett haa NER OTA lth bi

Separation of the counterintelligence function
would be more practically feasible; however, the commingling
of counterintelligence and internal security interests, and
the threat of a merger of the counterintelligence function,
with the positive foreign intelligence collection agency,
especially in the U. S., are both practical and political
reasons militating against this course.

' Separation of the internal security function also

| presents serious political considerations. Internal security

“or as some say, at least in reference to its "subversive"
investigations, political intelligence, is the most controversial
of government's intelligence collection activities. In the
U. S., this function was originally given to the FBI which
had established for itself a repptation for being responsible,
competent, and most importantly, politically neutral, and had
the confidence of most Americans. It is recognized that this
reputation is not etched in stone, and that because of the
diversity of peoples, political views, and activities tolerated
in the U. S. no internal security agency can, using human
judgement, attempt to fulfill its responsibility without
offending someone, sometime, someplace.

4
}

It-is to the advantage of an internal security
agency, which is subjected to such political pressures, to
ional be somewhat insulated by being part of a larger, respected

organization which has a high profile as a competent and fair

investigative agency in the less politically complex law
enforcement and counterintelligence fields. Adding to this
insulation is the tradition of FBI political independence, and
the usw Conysessivual coucesn wilh heepliy the PDE politically
independent. While the law enforcement and counterintelligence
wings of the FBI dislike the controversies into which its
internal security wings drags the FBI name, separation of
internal security into a separate agency would probably subject
it to more intense political pressures, both from within the
administration and without, which pressures it might not be
capable of withstanding. Such separation appears politically
unfeasible and undesirable.

- - Practical considerations against divestiture of
the counterintelligence and internal security furctions from
the FBI are that: basic criminal investigative experience
equips men in many areas to be intelligence officers; a pool
of trained criminal investigators is available to the intelligences
missions to draw from, either on an ad hoc emergency basis,
e.g., seizure of an embassy or political kidnapping or skyjacking,
or as candidates for the position of intelligence officer;~
B a divestiture might result in the loss to the counterintelligence
d and internal security wings of the. effective use of the FBI nane,
reputation, and contacts and sources built-up over years using
the FBI name.

The RCMP has shown that all three missions can
be accommodated in one agency, although the distinctive
character of each mission requires internal adjustments of
policy, structure, administration, personnel considerations,
and operations.

Implementation of adjus tments within the FBI.
is being considered at this time’:

Consequently, based on above considerations, the
FBI recommends that all three missions of law enforcement,
internal ‘security, and counterintelligence remain with the
FBI.

| - I. AUTHORIZATION OF CONSENSUAL, TITLE III, AND NATIONAL
| | | SECURITY ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCES

~

The legal ee of the above types
of electronic surveillance differs, and in part as a con-
L sequence of that, the administrative procedure for securing
authorization to use each type differs.

A. Consensual
: - The current law is that as long as one party to a
conversation, whether over the telephone or in person, consents
to a monitoring of that conversation by another or a recording
of that conversation by another or by himself, such a monitoring
.or recording is'legal, and may be introduced into evidence ‘in a .
legal proceeding. : 7 : i

At present, the monitoring or recording of telephone
rare conversations by the FBI with the consent of one of the parties,
: e.g., via a device attached to the consenting party's telephone
or a monitoring via use of an extension telephone, is authorized
‘internally within the FBI by either a Special Agent in Charge
.or, if the case is "sensitive," by a Headquarters official,
generally the Director. On the other hand, the present policy
with regard to consensual monitoring of nontelephone conversations,
@.g-, body or hidden recorders or transmitters, is that the
Attorney General must approve these in advance, except in an
emergency, at which time the Director (or someone designated
by him) can approve them and then promptly notify the Attorney
General. The method of requesting Attorney General approval,
or of notifying the Attorney General of the exercise of the
emergency authorization, is a memorandum to the Attorney General
setting forth the identity of the target, the background of
the case, and the reason for-the request or authorization.

B. Title III

ae These electronic surveillances are permitted. by
act of Congress for the purpose of gathering evidence of
enumerated crimes. A requirement for the submission of
an affidavit to a court showing probable cause that a crime
’ is being committed and that evidence not obtainable otherwise
» ean be obtained via the electronic surveillance is set

\ :
NW 65360 Docld:32989541 Page20-



forth in the statute.. Current procedure is to submit to

the Attorney General a copy of the affidavit the FBI proposes

to submit to the court, with a cover memorandum setting forth

the background of the case. The affidavit has been worked out :
between FBI field personnel andthe local United States or. wd
Strike Force attorney, and between FBI Headquarters personnel

and Department of Justice attorneys before submission to the

Attorney General. The Attorney General either approves | ii
or disapproves proceeding with the application for court aco
_approval via a memorandum to the Director. 7 : i

National Security

: aI
ia o The continuous position of the Department of i}
Justice and several Presidents has been that the President : ie
has the constitutional power to authorize warrantless Y
electronic surveillances in the exercise of his Articles II j
and IV responsibilities “to conduct foreign affairs" and
"to protect the States against invasion." This power has i
‘generally been exercised by the Attorney General for the
; °° President. While not specifically approving this interpre-
j tation or intending to grant or restrict any powers along
| ‘’ these lines, but rather as a declaration of noninterference,
ieceeee Congress, when it passed Title III, stated in 18 U.S.C. 2511(3)
|: °° that nothing in Chapter 119, Title 18, of the U.S.C. or in Section
605 of the Federal Communications Act of 1934 limited the con-
i stitutional powers of the President (whatever they might be) to
authorize electronic surveillance: (1) to protect the Nation
against actual or potential attack or other hostile acts of a
foreign power; (2) to obtain foreign intelligence information
deemed essential to the security of the United States; (3) to
\ protect national security information against foreign intelligence
« activities; (4) to protect the United States against the over-
+ throw of the Government by force or other unlawful means; (5)
(to protect) against any other clear and present danger to the
“ structure or existence of the Government.

In United States versus U.S. District Court for the
Eastern District of Michigan (407 U.S. 297), commonly called
the Keith case after Judge Damon Keith, the Supreme Court held
nt that the President did not have the power to authorize warrant~
less electronic surveillance directed against purely domestic
organizations (and their members). The Court stated that the
issue in Keith fell within the language of categories 4 and

| NW.65360Docld:32989541 Page 24



5, as above, of 18 U.S.C. 2511(3), and that it was not deciding
on’cases. involving individuals or organizations that had a
"significant connection" with a foreign power.

Consequently, since Keith, the only requests for

national security warrantless electronic surveillance referred

to the Attorney General for approval involve individuals or
organizations with a "significant connection" with a foreign.
power. The procedure for submitting these requests is uniform.
fhe Director submits to the Attorney General a memorandum

. requesting approval for initiation or continuation of an
electronic surveillance on a particular individual or organization:
an attachment which is a summary of background information and
‘the circumstances on which the request is based; and a memorand
from the Attorney General to the Director approving the electronic
surveillance based on, and in the language of, one or more

of categories 1 - 3 of 18.U.S.C. 2511(3). If the Attorney
. - General approves the electronic surveillance, he signs and
{re returns this latter memorandum and keeps for his records a copy
:.° of the Director's memorandum to him and a copy of the attached

*.. summary. : SEE :

NW 65360 Docid:32989541 Page 22



“XI, BACKGROUND OF FEDERAL ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE LAW

iene The term electronic surveillance encompasses both
wiretapping (tap), i.e., the interception of a telephone
conversation by a third party, and microphone surveillance

. (bug), i.e., the interception of a nontelephone conversation
by means of a microphone which can lead either to a recorder
or merély transmit the conversation to a third party, or
both. Both wiretapping and microphone surveillance can be
conducted with or without the knowledge and consent of the
parties to the conversation. Consensual monitoring, i.e.,
tapping or bugging with the consent of one of the parties
to the conversation, has generally been held to be legal,
and is not considered in the following discussion. ;

The separate development of the law pertaining, to
wiretapping and microphone surveillance is, since passage of
‘Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of
1968 and the Keith decision, apparently of historical interest

: Prior to Title III and Keith, the law that developed
around electronic surveillances concerned itself primarily
with the admissibility of evidence obtained from electronic
surveillances rather than with the basic issue of the

“"legality" of electronic surveillance itself. -Evidence, or
evidence obtained from leads, gathered via wiretapping was
excluded from any criminal prosecution on the basis that pre-
-sentation of such evidence was a "disclosure" prohibited by
Section 605 of the Federal Communications Act; and evidence, or
evidence obtained from leads, gathered via a microphone surveil-

. lance or a wiretap was excluded if it was determined the instal
lation required a "trespass" and was thus an unlawful Search and
seizure. (These decisions often turned on technicalities
such as minimal physical penetration by a "spike mike.")

Pitle III established the Congressional intention
that electronic surveillance, under specific conditions, is
to be lawful and the evidence obtained therefrom admissible.

Title III also, while not conferring any statutory
authority on the President, indirectly recognized that he was
authorizing warrantless electronic surveillances in matters



affecting national security, and stated that Title III or Section
605 of the Federal Communications Act did not- affect any such
Powers. he might have. ‘.

Title III did not distinguish between wiretaps
and microphone surveillances, and court decisions since
Title IIIT involving both criminal and national security
matters seem to be drifting away from the artificial bases |
that distinguished these electronic surveillances in the past
and are lodking at the real issue of governmental powers
versus Fourth Amendment rights and the right to privacy.
The requirement of prior judicial review, the element on
which Keith turned, is a new factor in judicial consideration
of electronic surveillances, introduced by Title III.

NATIONAL

Domestic

The Keith Decision

. The case originated as ‘U.S. versus Plamondon, : [.
: et al., and involved Federal prosecution of defendants accused
- of bombing the CIA office in Ann Arbor, Michigan, in
September, 1968. Pursuant to a defense motion, Federal
, Government electronic surveillance records were checked and
revealed Plamondon had been intercepted via a national security :
wixetap on the Black Panther Party office in Oakland, California. :

ae : Under current court procedure “vegarding national
security electronic surveillances, the Government is required

. to disclose to the court all interceptions; the judge then

‘Fr determines whether the interception was legal or illegal.

7 If he finds it to be illegal, he orders the prosecution to

‘make available to the defense all the logs and tapes pertaining
‘to the interception so that the defense can determine if any

, of the case against it is based on illegally obtained eléctronic
iia uirrnTEvioTiE evidence.

The trial Judge Damon:Keith held that the President
had no power to authorize electronic surveillance of the
Black Panther Party without prior judicial approval, i.e.,

a warrant, that therefore the wiretap was illegal, and the
prosecution had to turn the logs and tapes of the conversation
- over to the defense. . H

The Government appealed this decision to the |
Supreme Court, thus the case at that level was titled U.S. ‘
versus U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan,
commonly called the Keith case.

On June 19, 1972, the Supreme Court affirmed Keith's
decision and held that the President has no warrantless,
national security power to authorize electronic surveillance
of domestic organizations (or their members). The Supreme
Court defined a domestic organization as one having no

"significant connection" heal a foreign power, its agents
or agencies.

The Justice Department, in the words of Deputy
Assistant Attorney General Kevin J. Maroney before the Senate
Subcommittee on Administrative Practice and Procedure on June 29,

- 1972, stated that it understands "significant connection" to

:.-Mean that the domestic organization must be substantially
‘financed by, or in active collaboration with a foreign power
for the purpose of committing unlawful activities against the
United States Government.

2. Guidelines and Procedures Currently Used by the FBI and
- the Department of Justice in Determining Whether a
Proposed National Security Electronic Surveillance Falls
Liner sent the Keith Decision

tis The Keith decision applies solely to a domestic
organization (and its members ) "with no significant
connection with a foreign power." The issues are what
constitute a “domestic organization" and “significant
“connection. "

The Department of Justice has qaeued the FBI no formal .
‘oral or any written 1 guidelines on these issues.

The reason is that the standard to be applied
“as a "facts and circumstances" test in each case in the light
of the Supreme Court's language in the Keith case and the
- Department of Justice's position as stated by Mr. Maroney
. before the Subcommittee.

The Supreme Court in Keith said that while it was
"attempt (ing) no precise definition" the scope of its decision
was limited to a "domestic organization...composed of citizens
of the United Statés...which has no. significant connection
with a foreign power, it agents or agencies." The Court
‘also recognized the difficulty in distinguishing "between
. 'domestic' and 'foreign' unlawful activities directed against
the Government of the United States where there is collabora-
tion in varying degrees between domestic groups or organizations
and agents or agencies of a foreign power."

pat The Subcommittee asked the Department of Justice
what level of foreign dominance and control of a domestic
group would be considered sufficient to bring the group into the

area of foreign activities on which the Court has not yet ruled.
Maroney replied:

“De

\

NW_65360_Docld:32989541_ Page 26



“"Phe Keith decision has suggested a standard of
‘significant connection with a foreign power, its agents
or’ agencies.' We do not interpret this as meaning casual,
unrelated contacts and communications with foreign governments
or agencies thereof. We would not try to apply this standard
without the presence of such factors as substantial financing,
control by or active collaboration with a foreign government
and agencies thereof in unlawful activities directed against
the Government of the United States. Obviously, such factors
will be présent in a very minimum number of situations.
(Emphasis added.)

- "J wish to assure ‘the (sub) Committee on behalf
of the Attorney General, that the Department of Justice
accepts both the letter and the spirit of the Court's ruling
in the Keith case. It is the intention of the Executive

" Branch to utilize electronic surveillance in present and

future national security matters in full and ungrudging

_ application of the rationale of the decision." (Emphasis
_ added. )

“The FBI carried on an informal dialogue with

- the Department of Justice after the Keith decision in an

attempt to establish some general guidelines in the abstract,
but the discussions eventually came back to the above language,
and the conclusion that each case requires a facts and circum-

stances test,- and an exercise of the independent judgment of the
. Attorney General on the facts presented.

-As a result, the FBI submitted some borderline
cases, which it recognized as such, to the Attorney General
in order to get a feeling of how he and the Department of
Justice applied the above standard to specific fact situa-
tions. Some were approved, some refused. As a result

_ the FBI feels it has-a fairly clear idea of the outer limits,

beyond which no electronic surveillance will be approved.

The lack of formal guidelines beyond the Court's
language and Maroney's testimony presents no practical or
administrative difficulty within the FBI. As Maroney noted,
the factors he related would be present in a very minimum
number of casés. That is true. Prior to Keith, domestic
national security electronic surveillances conducted by the FBI
had been winding down for some time. At the time of the Keith
decision only six, four telephone and two microphone, were in

. \

effect. The few cases in which are present some of the ~~
factors noted by Maroney are subjected to joint scrutiny by,
and discussion between, FBI field and Headquarters supervisory
personnel, and only after these feel the FBI may have a case
does the field initiate the request, which must be personally
approved by the field supervisor and the Special Agent in
Charge. Upon receipt, the Headquarters supervisor drafts a
Memorandum to the Attorney General, setting forth all pertinent
facts, including those showing foreign involvement, on which
the request is believed justified. He must also be able to
-justify the request in the language of one or more of the first’
three categories of 18 U.S.C. 2511(3). The request is presented
through channels (i.e., Headquarters unit chief, section chief,
branch chief, Assistant Director of the Intelligence Division,
Associate Director, and Director) to the Attorney General who
“must make an independent judgment.

cio ‘There are arguments pro and con that the lack of
- _. formal written guidelines pose an added threat to the Fourth
“fy . Amendment rights or right to privacy of a domestic organization

.seem to be based on the supposition that formal guidelines would
-be exclusive, and binding in all instances. Any guidelines
issued would probably be moré illustrative of the above
standard than definitive. Formal written guidelines made
available to the public might curtail criticism that we are
operating without a definitive standard, however, they might
also trigger criticism that they are too vague, not inter-
pretive of the Court's intent, etc.; and, should a case
arise that does not fit squarely within the guidelines but
could possibly be justified on a broader standard, reasonably
-within the Court's language, we could be criticized for not
+ adhering to our own guidelines. Both career professionals in
h the FBI and Department of Justice attorneys review the electronic
ua surveillance request for need, sufficiency, and legality. The
q, Department of Justice. has committed itself, and the FBI, to
‘abiding by the letter, spirit, and rationale of the Keith
decision (and has expanded upon the decision to the extent of
Maroney's testimony). If legal action ensues, whether criminal
er civil, the courts in looking at the legality of a national
security electronic surveillance are bound only by the Keith
@ecision regardless of any Department of Justice guidelines.

_ In summary then, the procedure is: the FBI does not
submit a request to the Attorney General for approval of an
electronic surveillance upon a domestic organization composed of

-9 -

or individual. The argument that it does pose an added threat wovid



United States citizens, unless it has a "significant connection"
with a foreign power, its agents or agencies; by "significant
connection" the FBI and the Department of Justice understan

that the domestic organization must be substantially financed
by, controlled by, or in active collaboration with such foreign
power for the purposes of committing unlawful activities against
the United States Government. The FBI presents its request to t!
Attorney General with all the facts and circumstances on which
request is_based, and he must exercise an independent judgnient as

_, to whether the request falls within this standard and the letter,
spirit, and rationale of the Keith decision.

BRERRER ERE

: . “Senator Kennedy has He ana concern in the past
that | a political appointee, the Attorney General, rather than
-career professionals, is the final authority on these matters.

' This is a two-edged sword. If the ultimate authority were non-

public career professionals, there would be less response
from them than from the appointee of an elected official
to public pressure criticizing procedures and decisions.

On the other hand, the Attorney General's decision

". could possibly be based more on personal political attitudes and
Hl motivation than on his interpretation of the law.

The present procedure attempts to meet both short-
comings. The Attorney General does not recommend or initiate
electronic surveillance requests; they are initiated by and
processed through several levels of career professionals who at
each step judge whether the request falls within the standard.
The request is then sent to the Attorney General, who refers it
to the Internal Security Section, Criminal Division, of the
Department for its independent judgment, before he makes the
ultimate decision. Thus, any electronic surveillance request, if
it makes it to the Attorney General, has already been approved
by the career professionals. It is arguable that a career
professional might be more cautious if he, and his agency, bore
the final authority and responsibility rather than passing both
on to another agency. There is no airtight response to this;
it is a question of human motivation, sense of obligation, duty
and responsiblity. The impulse to be less than diligent is
countered by an employee's een and career
considerations.

7 “ fhe President has no warrantless power to authorize

He may have the power to subject’ domestic targets to electronic
surveillance, but these electronic surveillances must be
subjected to prior judicial review, i.e., a warrant, before.
installation. Admissibility of evidence obtained from such
electronic surveillances is a correlative question, not yet
Girectly considered. Presumably, such evidence would be
admissible. : :

B. _ Foreign

The legality = and admissibility of evidence issues”
have not yet been directly considered by the Supreme Court.
The issue of “legality, " based on whether prior judicial review
is required (key issue in Keith), was resolved in the Govern-

“ment! s favor by the United States District Court, District of

New Jersey, in United States versus Ivanov. Following an eX

‘ parte, in camera inspection of the surveillance logs by the
_ district « court and argument on the legality issue by the parties,

the court sustained the authority of the Attorney General to

‘acquire foreign intelligence information by warrantless electronic
‘surveillance.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Third
Circuit reversed and remanded, assuming, arguendo, that the
President did have such authority and that therefore any electronic
surveillances in the case were legal. Further, the Appellate
Court felt it had to assume "in the present posture" of the case,

-that the case was in fact built on electronic surveillance

evidence. Consequently, the Appellate Court held that since

- the case arose prior to passage of Title III, Section 605 of

the Federal Communications Act of 1934 applied, and it prohibited
“@ivulging" of electronic idersliharrntiniia results as evidence in
court.

The issue of the legality of foreign national security
electronic surveillances is also currently under advisement by
the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit in the case of United States versus Enten. In Keith,
the Supreme Court spec ally noted that two lower courts (the
Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in United States versus Clay,

-11,-



430 F.2a 165 (1970) and the United States District Court, Central
District of California in United States versus Smith, 321 F.
Supp. 424 (1971)) have held that “warrantless surveillance...
‘may be constitutional where foreign powers are involved." .

The argument that even foreign related electronic’
surveillances should be subject to initial judicial review is
based on the argument that this is the only guaranteed method
of protecting the Fourth Amendment rights and right to privacy
of aliens, and United States citizens who might be involved.

The argument on the other side is that the nature and objective’
- of the activity, viz., foreign intelligence gathering,:- the needs
of security, the many nonprosecutive factors to be considered,
and often the time element, do not lend themselves to effective
or efficient initial judicial review; consequently, the Govern-

-ment must be granted a measure of confidence to utilize this

technique on its own authority, with the safeguards of protection

from conviction or the remedies of a civil action available to
_any target of an electronic surveillance, if the Government
abuses this authority.

: This area-is still in limbo, the same condition as
prior to Title IIIT and Keith. Until Ivanov and Enten, or more
likely until a post Section 2511(3) espionage case, actually
built on electronic surveillance evidence, are decided by the
Supreme Court, the Government, to be safe, must be willing to
‘sacrifice a criminal prosecution to stadheneeaa electronic surveil-
lance intelligence.

SECURITY ELECTRONIC’ SURVEILLANCES

classified Appendix)



Vv. DOMESTIC "INTERNAL SECURITY" ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE:
+ ALTERNATIVES TO KEITH PROHIBITION

There are several elements within United States
society which pose a threat to the safety and tranquility of
segments of that society, e.g., police officers, symbols of
the "Establishment," etc. While some of these elements claim
to be “revolutionary” and claim as an ultimate objective the
overthrow of the United States Government, there is no respon-
‘sible opinion that feels any of these elements have any chance
of success in toppling the Government. Yet, they do pose a
significant threat of inflicting serious, and sometimes ex~
tensive, damage on individuals and property.

Ser eee een

He In combatting these elements, law enforcement is
confronted with the opposite of its usual task. Ordinarily, law
enforcement is confronted with a completed crime and investigates
+ to identify suspects and to prove guilt; in these cases it has
» the suspects, e.g., individuals or groups have said they intend to
murder police officers, bomb buildings, etc., so law enforcement's
_ job is then to thwart commission of the crime. This is an intel-
- ligence investigation. It is conducted prior to a threatened
: criminal act, not after the act, and as such ranges wider and 7
* .looks into more fawcets of the suspect's behavior. Yet, it is f
not a "fishing expedition"; it is based on some solid indication
. ‘that the suspect intends tor and has the capability of,. committing
* some crime.

-Because of the exaggerated rhetoric of many of these
elements, which never do actually commit a crime, the difficulties
in identifying specific individuals as suspects, in showing a
cause-effect relationship between the urgings and claims of group
leaders andthe act of the actual triggerman or bomber, and in
showing suspected imminence of the criminal act, it is almost
impossible to make a probable cause showing, as we understand

_ that term today, to support a warrant for restricted types of
investigation. Essentially what law enforcement has, or depend.
on your emphasis, all that law enforcement has, is a suspicion,
based on stated criminal objectives of these elements, claims of

o¢ criminal accomplishments, and indications from behavior and
attitudes, that these elements may engage in destructive criminal
behavior sometime in the future. 2

\

—NW_65360-Docld:32989541_ Page 33



Because these elements threaten and commit crimes in
furtherance of their stated goal of overthrowing the United States
Government, investigation of them has often proceeded on a
“national security" basis; and because there is no practical,
immediate prospect of their accomplishing this goal, the “nationai
security" foundation for investigation of them has, in many
quarters, not been taken seriously, and is often suspect because
of the latitude that has been allowed in "national security”
investigations as opposed to simple criminal investigations.

The difficulty is that these domestic "internal securi
cases lie somewhere between what is generally accepted as "natio.
security" matters and plain, simple criminal violations. If one
interprets national security to mean only matters which threaten
the stability of the Government, either from within or without,
then these cases are not national security matters; yet, they
pose a threat to the safety and tranquility of the community

‘beyond individual incidents of crime, or even random sprees of

eriminal acts by an individual or group.’ These cases also’ have
some effect on national and international attitudes towards U.S.
standards, morale, government, law enforcement, and the elements
involved, e.g., "Why can't law enforcement protect society, and
itself, against attacks"; or "These people are victims of a
repressive system and attack is their only effective avenue of
protest for change." 7

Consequently, law enforcement is confronted with a
situation wherein it is threatened with criminal acts in further-
ance of a claimed political goal, the mere condition of being so
threatened often having an impact beyond a completed routine
eriminal act (although many of these threats are eventually

. Carried out); yet, this condition is generally insufficient to

show probable cause to justify a warrant for an electronic
surveillance.

Assuming that there is valuable intelligence to be

. obtained from electronic surveillance in these matters to be

used in attempting to thwart these crimes, how can we fill the
void created by Keith?

Title III has very limited value in this area. Its
stated purpose is to gather evidence of crimes that we have
probable cause to believe are being, or are about to ‘be, committed.
it is doubtful whether the threats of these elements, or even
evidence of past attacks, would be sufficient probable cause to
support a continuing electronic surveillance with no specific crims

-~ 15 ~
\

NW 65360 Doctd:32989541 Page 34



in immediate view. Title III could perhaps be used in sonié of t
cases where the investigation has developed to a point where we
have probable cause for a specific crime, but the probable cause
would be momentary and would expire after the act or probability
“of the act. Title III also has limited value for continuing
intelligence purposes because of its applicability only to
specified crimes; the short time period (30 days per request);

the requirement that the target eventually be given notice and

the results of the electronic surveillance (this can be postponed
but not indefinitely); and the number of people who could become
involved with and thus aware of a recurring monthly application to
a court. ;

After the Keith decision, there was extensive debate
within the FBI and between the FBI and,the Department of Justice
on its effect, and how we could proceed, within the Keith
restriction, in cases where we felt there was a clear “internal
security" (which went undefined) threat where electronic surveil-
lance would be valuable. It was accepted that Title III would be
of minimal value because of the problems noted above. Within the
FBI it was also argued, and finally accepted, that FRCrP 41,
might be utilized to obtain a routine search warrant to install
an electronic surveillance where Title III was inapplicable.
Assistant Attorney General Olson and Deputy Assistant Attorney
General Maroney disagreed, feeling that Title III was intended to
preempt all other methods of securing electronic surveillances,
besides Presidentially approved surveillances.

The argument is largely theoretical. FRCrP 41, like

Title III, requires a showing of probable cause, so it like-
wise is available only when specified criminal acts are believed
to be going on or are imminent. FRCrP 41 warrants must also be
executed forthwith, and notice must be given to the target and
he must be served with an inventory of the items seized. Given
a case which falls within both Title III and FRCrP 41, Title III

“ procedures are preferable because they are less restrictive and
more clear cut since they deal exclusively with electronic
surveillances. :

Title III is fairly broad in specifying the crimes for
which electronic surveillances can be authorized under its sections.
It is difficult to think of a threat to the internal security so
significant that acts in furtherance of the threat would not
involve criminal violations specified in Title III. Of course,
the FBI would be limited to basing its requests for electronic
surveillances on Federal crimes enumerated in Title III, and the



threatened destructive acts might involve solely local offenses,
e.g., murders of policemen. Title III provides for local
authorities to use electronic surveillances in such Sarecaaase

Even assuming that there was a case falling outside of
Title III, but within FRCrP 41, the FBI is still limited to
using “search warrants obtained thereunder to seize evidence of
Federal crimes; if the threatened act is a local violation only
FRCrP 41 is of no value to the FBI.

Without a showing of probable cause of an ongoing or

imminent crime, it is doubtful if either Title III or’FRCrP 41
could be used to secure an electronic surveillance. It is belie
an ongoing intelligence-gathering electronic surveillance based
on indications but not probable cause, that the target might
engage in purely domestic criminal activity, for the purpose of

"thwarting that activity, no matter how potentially destructive,
‘will require enabling legislation. Mr. Maroney in his testimony
before the Senate Subcommittee on Administrative Practice and
Procedure stated that the Department of Justice was not request
such legislation at that time, but that if it became evident that
a void clearly detrimental to United States security interests
had been created by Keith, the Department of Justice will seek
new: legislation, : :

Chance for passage of stitch legislation at this time
is probably nil. :

2. Counterintelligence

Electronic surveillances assist our counterintelligencs
efforts by providing personality data and information regarding
the contacts and activities of known and suspected foreign
intelligence officers. This information assists in planning
counterintelligence activity, assessing defection potential,
analyzing routines and patterns, conserving manpower, and in
directing sources against these officers.
SEWSITVE FOREIGN INTELLIGENEE INFORMATION

There are currently 165 known and _70 suspected Soviet
intelligence officers, and 72 | known and 430 suspected Soviet-
:bloc intelligence officers in the United States.

Examples of information obtained via electronic
‘surveillance of value to our counterintelligence responsibility
are as follows:

An individual was detected in contact with a hostile
-intelligence service in September, 1972. He expressed a desire.
to defect and to offer information regarding United States naval
intelligence to which he had access. Although the interception
did not give us his name, it provided sufficient information to
conduct an investigation which established his identity, con-
firmed that he had been engaged in very sensitive naval
communications intelligence, and disclosed that he was a fugitive
wanted on local charges. He was arrested on November 23, 1972.

- In one case, electronic surveillance furnished infor-
mation, within four days of its installation, of a contact
between an official of the Soviet Illegal Support Branch and
ah individual who appears to be a Soviet illegal agent.

\ ; Electronic surveillance furnished information con-
j cerning an attempt in 1969 by a United States serviceman to
: defect to the Soviets.

An example of the value of electronic surveillance
coverage in foreign terrorist matters involved an Al Fatah leader
formerly in the United States. In the Summer of 1972 he
departed this country for a visit to.the Middle East. He later
applied for a reentry permit which was denied. In late
November, 1972, a telephone surveillance disclosed a contact
by an individual suspected to be the Al Fatah leader. An

investigation was initiated and a second electronic surveillance

using a variation of his family name. This information enabled
his arrest by the Immigration and Naturalization Senvices

B. Domestic

The: primary value derived from intelligence gathering,
as opposed to evidentiary, electronic surveillances in this area
is in obtaining plans for carrying out threatened criminal acts,
evidence of foreign influence or financing, and information

- which assists in planning apprehensions of wanted individuals
with less risk to the lives of officers and bystanders.

. Examples: Via electronic surveillance of the Black
Panther Party, Cleaver Faction, in New York City; Huey P.
Newton in Oakland, California; and the Los Angeles Black Panther
Party, the following information was obtained. e-

On November 6, 1971, plans to kill New York Police
Commissioner Murphy were discussed. :

On September 14, 1971, use of police radios to monitor
- New York city Police Department activity was discussed.

On April 26, 1971, electronic surveillance identified
Robert Vickers ‘as the assailant:of a New York City police officer
‘killed April 19, 1971. (Although this information was also
‘evidentiary, it identified Vickers as a triggerman for the group
who could be used in the future.)

‘ i" On December 28, 1970, electronic surveillance reported
CH that Newton received $1,400 from a Swedish group.

On September 20, 1971, electronic surveillance reported
a communication between Newton, and the President of Tanzania.

On September 28, 1971, electronic surveillance reported
Newton's travel plans to China, and on hadiutit 19, 1971, it

_ ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE

1. The Problem:

: Use of electronic surveillance falls into three broad areas:
criminal, domestic national Shanta and foreign national security.
: Little policy consideration need be given to use in criminal
eases. Such use is prescribed and proscribed in Title III of the Omnibus
Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, has been upheld by the courts,
and has been used to great advantage unde? the current procedures and
policy. In short, there is no policy problem in this area.

. " Electronic surveillance in both domestic and foreign national
security eases is primarily used for intelligence purposes, not evidentiary
purposes; however, it often produces information of evidentiary value.

5 : The only Congressionally approved electronic surveillance
is s for the sole purpose of obtaining evidence of stated crimes (Title III).

Foreign national security electronic surveillances produce a

good deal of positive intelligence value to U.S. foreign policymakers, a

good deal of information necessary for counterintelligence activity, and,
. rarely, information of evidentiary value.

Domestic national security electronic surveillances produce
-information valuable to law enforcement in thwarting murders, serious
epi to persons, and extensive damage to property, and also, rarely,
information of evidentiary value.

Electronic surveillance in domestic national security cases
which was previously approved by the Attorney General for the President
utilizing his Constitutional powers has been prohibited by the Supreme
Court in the Keith case, i.e., held illegal without prior judicial approval.

nel without. the express approval of the FBI.

NW 65360 Docid:32989541 Page 42



The issue of the legality of warrantless, Presidentially
approved electronic surveillance in foreign national security cases has not
yet been decided by the Supreme Court; this issue is now pending in two
circu Courts of Appeals.

Thus the specific problems with regard to domestic national
security electronic surveillance are that it produces information of value
not obtainable by other means; it has been prohibited without prior

- judicial approval; there is no mechanism to obtain prior judicial approval.
_Consequently, we conduct no domestic national security electronic surveil-
* lances.
i absent . The specific problems with regard to foreign national security
: electronic surveillance are that: it produces information of value not
.Obtainable by other means; the legality of the President to authorize its
use without prior judicial review is being challenged; if it is held illegal
. there probably will also be no mechanism to obtain prior judicial review;
current court procedure requires in camera disclosure of the existence
‘of national security electronic surveillance in criminal trials and if found
“ . illegal, disclosure of the content of the intercepts to the defense, which
for overriding security and foreign policy reasons can usually not be made.

*" 2. Present Policy
_ Domestic National Security Cases:
We do not conduct electronic surveillance in these cases.

Foreign National Security Cases:

a . "+ Pending Supreme Court consideration of the "legality" of
-electronic surveillance in these cases, they continue to be approved by
* the Attorney General, and utilized without warrant.

3. The Issues

7 The main issue in both domestic and foreign national security
electronic surveillance cases is the right and need of the Government to
obtain intelligence information in cases involving (1) U.S. foreign policy
considerations; (2) threats to our security as a nation from without; and

. (3) threats to the tranquility and safety of U.S. society from within,

: versus 4th Amendment rights and the right to privacy. 7

z - ‘The specific issues with regard ‘to domestic eases are: (1) Is
the threat to the safety and tranquility of U.S. society posed by certain
domestic groups of such magnitude to justify electronic ‘surveillance as an
intelligence-gathering device to be used against them? (2) If so, is the
threat of national, i.e., Federal dimensions, or is the threat primarily to
local or regional interests? (3) If this coverage is needed, has Keith
presented obstacles; and if so, how can they be overcome? (4) If ' i
enabling legislation is the answer to (3), should the electronic surveil- 7
lance intelligence-gathering authority be given to the: Federal or local
government, or both as in Title III? What should enabling legislation

"> entail? (5) Is there any option other than enabling legislation?

The primary issue with regard to foreign cases is: Is
Presidentially approved, warrantless electronic surveillance in cases
involving a "significant connection" with a foreign power constitutional,
eeeee or "legal." On the resolution of this issue hangs all else in these cases,
viz., admissibility of electronic surveillance evidence in court; degree of
disclosure to be required in criminal proceedings; and if held illegal,
the judicial review procedure to be proposed in order to continue such
surveillances, if they are deemed of sufficient importance to continue them
in the face of additional risks inherent in a judicial review.

4. Options for Future Policy

The chief issue for future policy consideration is, will the
Department support the argument for the need for intelligence electronic
surveillance? In foreign cases? In comecee cases?

4 oe If so, then the discussion centers on Department policy
q regarding the means to effect such surveillances.

Foreign national security cases: REECE E Eee EEE EEE araaneeL ae

“Hopefully, the examples of intelligence value set out in the
classified appendix of the attached study carried the argument that
electronic surveillance in these cases is highly desirable, if not essential,

- to our counterintelligence efforts and to our foreign policy considerations.
Even without specific examples of value derived from these surveillances,
the bottom line argument is that electronic surveillance of foreign intelli-
gence services is at least an inconvenience to them, and makes it more
difficult for them to carry on their intelligence activities.

NW 65360 Docld:32989541 Page 44.



at

The present Sean is to Sper! the legality 0 of the President's
authority to conduct this surveillance without warrant, to restrict disclosure
of the existence or contents of such surveillances, and presumably, to
support the argument that any evidence obtained from such surveillance is
admissible in a criminal proceeding.

These issues are discussed very well in the Government's
petition for rehearing in U.S. v. Ivanov, attached. Also attached is a
classified memorandum summarizing the case up to the petition for
rehearing. :

Until these issues are resolved, consideration of future policy
options would be speculative, and may be unnecessary.

Domestic national security cases:

The FBI Intelligence Division feels there is something of
intelligence value to be gained from electronic surveillance coverage of
some domestic groups. The opinion of former Assistant Attorney General
Olson and Deputy Assistant Attorney General Maroney is that there is no

". need to utilize this type of electronic surveillance and therefore no need

to seek enabling legislation at this time, but that if a need does appear
the Government will seek such legislation.

The examples set out in the classified appendix to the attached
study show the value that can be derived from intelligence coverage of

“domestic groups. Is information of'this type worth the financial man-

power expenditure (which is considerable) to obtain it? Is it worth the
task of trying to write enabling legislation (providing for judicial review

to satisfy Keith) to allow intelligence electronic surveillance in domestic
eases? Is it worth the fearsome battle such a bill would cause in Congress?
Does such a bill have a chance at this time, or in the foreseeable future?

: Upon reconsideration, the blanket pessimisim on chance for
passage of such legislation in the attached ‘study seems extreme. It is
believed that the Department and the FBI should attempt to write a bill,
with as restrictive judiciel control as necessary in order to obtain Con-.
gressional approval, to permit intelligence electronic surveillance against
domestic groups which threaten death or "extensive damage" (to be either
defined or specifically enumerated, e.g., plane hijackings, bombings,

NW 65360 Docld:32989541 Page 45



. murders of officials or police, etc). A restrictive enumeration of specific
acts which if threatened, but not to the extent of producing probable
cause, would justify appeal to a court or magistrate for an intelligence -
electronic surveillance, might have some chance for passage. The
judicial review would satisfy the 4th Amendment requirements; and a
specific list of acts limited to major contemporary concerns would allow
for item deletions and additions as conditions change. Such a specific

* section to the bill would allow for not only effective qe review,

“but also effective Congressional review.

Fare Such a bill, in our opinion, should avoid mention of contro-

. versial and difficult to define terms such as "domestic national security,"
"internal security," "threats to the existence or structure of the Govern-

“ ment," and all terms with political connotations; and should use terms
emphasizing the aim of preventing serious criminal acts which threaten:

‘- life and limb (without mention of motivation, whether political or otherwise).

In our opinion, such a bill should make intelligence elec-

‘tronic surveillance available to both local and Federal agencies. It is

envisioned that such a bill would cover purely local groups which, e.g.,

threaten murder of local police officers, and groups national in scope,

"As discussed in the attached study, Title III and FRCrP 41
do not seem to offer practical alternatives for this type of coverage.

Beeeet) ‘on | dune 21, 1973, the U. s. Court of Appeals for the

‘Third Circuit reversed the conviction of Ivanov for violations
a of 18 U.S.C. 794 (a) and (c), and 18 U.S.C. 951, and the court
eee the case for further proceedings.

* BACKGROUND

Ivanov, an Amtorg Trading Corporation chauffeur, and
Butenko, aU. S. citizen, were originally convicted of a
violation of 18 U.S.C. 794 (a) and (c) (espionage) and a .
‘ conspiracy violation of 18 U.S.C. 951 (by causing Butenko to
. °act as an agent of the Soviet Union without prior notification
to hates vu. Ss. Secretary of State). : 2

: “On appeal the ‘Supreme Court found the electronic
surveillance issue in their cases was "nearly identical" to

“the electronic surveillance issue in Alderman et al v. U. S.,

and considered it in conjunction with that case (394 U.S. 165)..

" (Alderman had been convicted of conspiracy to transmit :
Hwaederens threats in interstate commerce.) i :

af In Alderman the Supreme Court, noting that no evidence
or evidence obtained from leads which were obtained from an
illegal electronic surveillance i.e., one which violated a
efendant's 4th Amendment rights, could be utilized in a criminal
trial, disregarded the Government's contention that a trial
court's in camera inspection of electronic surveillance records
was sufficient, and held that the defendant was the only one
- dn a position to adequitely knowingly review such records to
@etermine if the case against him was built on electronic
‘surveillance. Consequently the defendant was to be given
access in a discovery hearing to illegal electronic surveil--
lance records of interceptions of his conversations.

former, it was not in the latter and might prejudice on-going
‘intelligence operations vital to the national security. In

these cases, he argued on behalf of disclosure to the defendant

Of only those portions which the trial court in camera found

: "arguably relevant" to the Government's case against the defendant.

The Ivanov and Butenko cases were remanded to the

District Court, 1) to determine whether there was electronic

surveillance which violated either defendant's 4th Amendment

: rights and 2) if so, to determine whether any of the intercepted.
conversations were relevant to his conviction. The Supreme

Court stated that if the District Court found 1) that there

was electronic surveillance but it did not violate the defendant's

4th Amendment rights, or 2) there was electronic surveillance

. Which did violate the defendant's 4th Amendment rights but his

‘conviction was not tainted by evidence obtained from that surveil

“lance, the District Court should enter new judgements of conviction

. based on the existing record, along with its further findings,

.thus preserving the defendant's right to further appeal.

fi “On remand in Ivanov the case revolved around two sets
; Of FBI electronic surveillances on which Ivanov was monitored

*, “during 1963: 1) 2 microphones at the homes of Ivanov and Karats
-a KGB officer and neighbor of Ivanov (for the sake of argument,
the District Court held them both to be directed at Ivanov),

and 2) a wiretap on the Soviet Mission to the United

Nations, and a wiretap and a microphone at Amtorg.

The residence microphones, which at that time Depart-.
.Ment procedures did not require to be authorized by the Attorney
°. General, were conceded by the Government to be illegal, thus
. falling within the disclosure requirement of Alderman. The
District Court held that the Government, on remand, made full
disclosure on these microphones, after some argument, and
ruled that the defendant had not shown, and the Government
had carried its burden to refute, that Ivanov's case was
built on evidence from these microphones. =

The more important issues. related to the other set of
Surveillances. The Government contended that those surveillances
were duly authorized under the President's national security

therefore it was not required to disclose the logs to the
efense or to participate in an evidentiary hearing regarding

. °.,+£inding on remand in Butenko (318 F. Supp. 66), agreed, finding
that these surveillances and the Government's use ofthe logs
-from them did not violate Section 605 of the Communications

Fsebebbiia to disclose or participate in an evidentiary hearing.
The District Court in Butenko found that 4th Amendment
ights are not absolute, that there are exceptions to the warzan
“requirement, and that the President's responsibility for fore
_ affairs and national security do not preclude him from autho:
va warrantless foreign intelligence electronic surveillance.
‘It also found that, since Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control

- Appellant

“-He argues that Section 605 itself, its legislative
history, and subsequent case law do not indicate that Section
605 intended to prohibit the President from utilizing electzroni
surveillance to gather foreign intelligence or to use thi
information gathered in cases involving a defendant's foreign
~ intelligence gathering. He traces the legislative history
Communications Act and finds its main purpose was to establis
a Communications Commission and that it extended to wire
communications almost the identical provisions of Section
27 of the Radio Act of 1927, which was thought neither to apply
to federal officers nor to bar testimony relating to the
- contents of radio messages intercepted by them. Judge Adam
“notes there was no Congressional debate over the meanin
provisions of Section 605, implying-that if it had been
to limit the President's foreign intelligence powers, there
‘ probably would have been debate.

. Similarly, Judge Adams finds that in response to th
Government's argument in Nardone that "a construction be gives -
‘... Section 605 which would exclude Federal agents since it is

-.*improbable. Congress intended to ... impede ... the detection

7 .punishment of crime.", the Supreme Court concluded "that

he “question is one of policy. Judge Adams argues that where
_» | the Supreme Court might, as a matter of policy, find that
fase) - Congress intended to exclude electronic surveillance evidence
7 a in run-of-the-mill domestic criminal cases, there is no evi

. ‘it would extend the exclusion to cases involving the gat:
- of foreign intelligence. Additionally, this surveillance
not aimed solely at securing evidence to convict a person ci
erime, but at gathering foréign intelligence deemed esse
to the security of the U. S. He thus concludes that the N
interpretation of Section 605 is not applicable ‘to thi
~-O£f case, and argues that in view of the breadth of the
. President's authority in foreign affairs, Section 605 should
: be interpreted to limit that power only if Congress' intent
to do so is clearly manifest, which he argues it is not. .

Judge Adams then addresses the constitutional
question avoided by the majority, viz., does the 4th AR.
allow the President to authorize warrantless electro
lances in foreign intelligence cases. He concludes that i
does. He argues that constitutional rights are not absolute
they must be weighed against competing rights; and the 4th
Amendment prohibits only unreasonable searches and seizures.

2 Judge Adams finds that the constitutional responsi-

- that the gathering of foreign intelligence and the protecting
-. against foreign intelligence activities is concerned with the
very existence of the nation; that as a result, the President
vhas great latitude in this area; and that to require a

Thus concluding that the 4th Amendment does not and

as the courts cannot, prohibit the President from utilizing

that a defendant's 4th Amendment rights can still be reconciled
with the President's electronic surveillance power by a judicial
post surveillance review. If the court finds that the surveil-
lance is related to the conduct of foreign affairs it would,

tu As previously noted Alderman dealt exclusively with
“dltegal electronic surveillances, i.é., surveillances in

- Yyiolation of a defendant's 4th Amendment rights. It did not
distinguish between "routine" criminal cases and foreign
intelligence-esvionage cases when it required that full
disclosure of all interceptions of the defendant be made to him
so that he, in an adversary proceeding, might determine if

“the Government's case against him was "tainted." Justice Harlan,
“objecting to full disclosure in foreign intelligence-espionage
cases, and on behalf of disclosure only of portions deemed
"arguably relevant" to the Government's case by the trial court
after an in camera review, did not raise the issue of "legal"

.vws. “illegal” electronic surveillance, so presumably he was

‘also talking about, and intending to limit disclosure even on
surveillances ‘which violated the 4th Amendment.

*’ The Third Circuit Court of Appeals assumes the
Ivanov surveillances in issue were legal, but still cites
Alderman as requiring an evidentiary hearing, and without that
“hearing feels it must conclude that Ivanov's conviction was

which: must be excluded under Section 605.

cSat 7 At the conclusion of Rlderman, when renanding

ae Ivanov, the Supreme Court instructed the District Court that
if it found the surveillance in question did not epee the
defendant's 4th Amendment rights it should reimpose jud¢ements
of conviction. The Supreme Court did not consider t
of Section 605 on the cases before it in Alderman.

: The case has been remanded for further proceedings,
, apparently an evidentiary hearing on the second set of surveil-
lances. The Government can opt to save Ivanov's conviction

by participating in such a hearing, since none of his case

was actually built on surveillance information; however this
would require disclosure to Ivanov of his intercepted conversa-
tion at the Mission and Amtorg, a disclosure concession we don'+
want to have to make because of the impact it would have on
diplomatic relations, ongoing counterintelligence operations,
and possibily on future prosecutions. Additionally, the
salvaging of Ivanov's conviction falls far short of the original
purpose of continuing the appeals in this case, viz., to obtain

a Supreme Court ruling on the legality of Presidential warrantless
+ foreign intelligence electronic surveillances. Consequently,

the Government probably will either ask for dismissal of the

‘ease or appeal the Third Circuit's ruling to the Supreme Court.

i If Ivanov is appealed the Supreme Court will face
three possible issues, the 4th Amendment issue of the legality
of warrantless foreign intelligence electronic surveillance,

- the disclosure issue, and the Section 605 evidentiary issue
_The Court could seize onto the Section 605 evidentiary issue,
“not considered by it in Alderman, to dispose of the case without
reaching the 4th Amendment or disclosure questions; or it coulé
stand on its instructions to the District Court and rule on the
-District Court's remand finding that Raise surveillance did not
violate the 4th Amendment.

. I£ the Supreme Court found the surveillance illegal,
" presumably Alderman's requirement of full disclosure would apoly,
and the case would be remanded for an evidentiary hearing to
exclude any electronic surveillance evidence, and the Section .
605 issue would be avoided. :

If the Court found the iapetae meraaiei legal it could:

) extend “Alderman and “require full ‘disclosure °
interceptions even if legal, possibly arguing something to
effect that Congress.in Title III has imposed the requi
of full disclosure in those cdses, and that a similar s.
Should be imposed on Presidential surveillances;

i 2) allow in camera review and require disclosure
.. to elements “arguably relevant" to the Government's case;

3) not require disclosure at all if the Government

intelligence, possibly arguing that since the defendant's r
against unreasonable search and seizure were not violated, +
has not beén injured, the Government's case is not illega
"tainted," therefore,.disclosure is not necessary, and, aé
ally, disclosure would be very damaging to national security.

- Even if the surveillances were found legal, however,
the Section 605 evidentiary issue would remain. A Hear

CONCLUSION

The constitutional issue here is, as was the issue~™

in Nardone, a policy question. Given today's climate and

public attitude towards electronic surveillances in general,

unchecked Presidential (White House) power, the distinction

between use of electronic surveillance for intelligence purposes
-vs. use for criminal prosecution, and the Supreme Court's

tradition of avoiding constitutional issues if it can decide

a case on lesser issues, I am inclined to think the Court would
. gxasp the "out" of the Section 605 evidentiary issue, thus
~ leaving the constitutional issue unresolved and allowing
Presidentially approved foreign intelligence electronic surveil-
ances to continue for the time being.

7 The practical result of this of course would be only
to reverse the conviction of one man, Ivanov, presently at home

“in the Soviet Union. This ruling would not preclude post 1968

prosecutions based on foreign intelligence electronic surveil-

. .lance information, since 2511 (3) presumably expresses

“) Congress’! intent to negate the evidentiary effect of Section

i. 605 with respect to such cases: "The contents of any wire or

, °° Oval communication intercepted by authority of the President in
| “-the exercise of the (powers enumerated in the statute, generally

ae elating. to foreign intelligence. and efforts to unlawfully over-

“throw or endanger the structure of the Government) may be
received in:evidence in any trial, hearing or other proceeding -
only where such interception was reasonable..."

With the Section 605 evidentiary obstacle presumably
disposed of by 2511 (3), it would seem that a post 1968 case
on facts similar to Ivanov,:or preferably one actually built on
electronic surveillance information, would be the best vehicle
for eventually getting a ruling on the 4th Amendment issue. ~

During our meeting on July 26, 1973, ‘you referred to a discussion
you had with Senator Charles McC. Mathias, Jr., of Maryland during your con-
firmation hearings as to the statutory authority of the FBI and the Department of
Justice in the field of domestic intelligence investigations. You then asked
Mr. William D. Ruckelshaus to work with the FBI in weighing the pros and cons
with regard to statutory authority in this area, I mentioned that research was
being performed on this subject at the present time and that we would be in .

* touch with Mr. Ruckelshaus with regard to this matter when we have completed.
the results of our consideration and findings within the FBI.

Actually, a study has been going on in the FBI for more than two oa
years as to the scope of FBI jurisdiction and authority in domestic intelligence—_
investigations. When Mr. L. Patrick Gray, lil, was designated as Acting
Director of the FBI, he instructed that a position paper be prepared concern-
ing the jurisdiction and authority of the FBI to conduct domestic intelligence ;

H investigations. A position paper was prepared which in essence stated that i.
y authority of the FEI in this field is based on legislative enactments, even |
though we may have publicly relied heavily on Presidential directives as the
basis for such authority. Mr. Gray ordered an in-depth study made of the
position and in August, 1972, a detailed report was furnished to him. The

following is a summary of that report. REC.2 ae

Over a period of several months there were a number of man

‘The Attorney General

: : A major thrust of Professor Elliff's paper concerned FBI authority
derived from legislative enactments as opposed to that derived from Presidential
directives, beginning with a dircctive issued by President Roosevelt in
September, 1939. Professor Elliff is of the opinion that the 1939 directive,
which was reiterated on three subsequent occasions, was magnified by the
FSI from its original purpose to a definitive order to conduct intelligence-type
investigations.

Senator Sam J. Ervin, as you know, had been probing into the
nature and extent of Fil intelligence-type investigations. Senator Ervin had
even announced that he intended to propose legislation to prohibit the FBI
from investigating any person without thet individual's consent, unless the
Government has reason to believe that person has committed a crime or is
about to commit a crime. Other Congressmen indicated a similar interest
in FBI investigative activities.

’ Our study revealed that the FBI had declared publicly over a

long period of time that its responsibilities in the domestic intelligence field
are authorized under legislative enactments, Presidential directives, and
instructions of the Attorney General. The Presidential directives are obviously
the 1) directive dated September 6, 1939, and reiterated January 8, 1943;

duly 24, 1950; and December 15, 1953, and 2) Executive Order 10450 dated
April 27, 1953 (and amended but not yet implemented by Executive Order

11605 dated duly 2, 1971).

In carefully analyzing the language of the first directive, dated

September 6, 1939, and considering that the subsequent dircctives are all

hinged on that one, we believe that there is a misconception as to the extent

of jurisdiction or authority conveyed to the FBI by these directives. It

appears that while the 1939 directive fixed responsibility on the FBI to handle

espionage, sabotage, and neutrality matters, it did not convey any authority

or jurisdiction which the FBI did not already have from legislative enactments.
: It is difficult to read into this directive or in any of those which followed any

authority to conduct intelligence-type investigations which would or could

not be conducted under an umbrella of legislative enactments.

The Attorney General

& As a matter of historical fact, President Roosevelt in August,
1936, did request former Director J. Edgar Hoover to conduct investigations
of subversive activities in this country, including communism and fascism.
This request, however, was a confidential oral request and there is doubt
that any record of it was made outside the FBI. This request, or Presidential
mandate, was based, incidentally, on the fact that the law provided that the
FEI could conduct such investigations if the Secretary of State should so

request.

The study revealed that while the 1939 et seq. directives did not
grant any special intelligence-gathering authority to the FBI, we were respon-
sible under these directives to collect all intelligence information furnished
by local, state, and Fedcral law enforcement agencies and patriotic citizens
end te sift and coordinate all such information for indications of subversive |
activity covered by Federal statutes. :

The study concluded that the FBI has the responsibility to con-
duct whatever investigations are necessary to determine if statutes relating
to espionage, sabotage, insurrection or rebellion, sedition, seditious con~
spiracy, advocacy of overthrowing the Government, and other such crimes
affecting the national security have been violated. In this connecticn we
note that in « leiter dated September 14, 1967, the Department of Justice
advised that the FBI is continually alert to the problem of recurring riots H
and is submitting intelligence reports to the Department of Justice concern- f
ing such activity. This letter enumerated several Federal statutes and

. 6tated these could be applicable in using maximum availsble resources, te
investigative and intelligence, to collect and report all facts bearing on

; the question of schemes or conspirecies to plan, promote or aggravate riot
ane activity.

In other words, the Department was requesting all possible i
intelligence-type investigative activity based _on the existence of certain f
li

i

statutes. We see this as being no different from our intelligence-type
investigations relating to plans of groups or individuals to overthrow,
destroy, interfere with or threaten the survival of effective operation of
national, state, and local governments.

The Attorney General ;
Based on this study, we believe thet had there never been a
single one of the Presidential directives in question the FBI would have
eonducted and will, through necessity, continue to conduct the same intelli-
.gence-type investigations as were conducted from 1839 to the present date.
We also believe, however, that in order to counter the criticism end skepti~
eism of such individuals os Professor Elliff and Senator Sam J. Ervin that
an up-to-date Executive order should be issued clearly esteblishing a need
. for intelligenee-type investigations and delinesting a clear authority for the
che FBI to conduct such investigations based on guidelines esiablished by the
Attorney General and adhering to constitutional principles.

a The study concluded with two basic recommendations.
1) That the Department of Justice be requested to sponsor eomprehensive
legislation spelling out the F8I's investigative authority in the collection of
intelligence information relating to the national security and; 2) that the
Department of Justice be requested to seak a comprehensive Executive order
which would cover any possible gap between statutory authority and Executive
necessity in protection of the national security.

At first glance these recommendations may appear to contradict
our position that we already have statutory authority to conduct security~type
investigations; that this being the case we do not need additional legislative
enactinents, nor do we need an Executive order. But being realistic we think
| that the basic statutes upon which we rely for our authority to conduct
domestic intelligence investigations need to be updated to fit 1973 needs.
Title 18 U.S.C. Sections 2383, 2384, and 2385 relate to the national security,
but the legislative history of 2383 and 2384 indicates that they were designed
for the Civil War era, not the Twentieth Century, and Section 2385 has been
reduced to a fragile shell by the Supreme Court, These statutes are unques-
tionably still valid, but updating is certainly indicated. The bilis introduced
- aS H.R, 6046 and S. 1400 in the $3rd Congress appear to contain language which
should fill our statutory needs, except perhaps jor those groups, such as the
Ku Klax Klan, which do not seek to overthrow the Government, but never-
theless are tctalitarian in nature and seek to deprive constitutionally guaranteed
rights.

The Attorney General

i

- As to the need for an Executive order, we think that two issues
are involved. We have statutory authority, but what we need is a definitive
requirement from the President as to the nature and type of intelligence data
he requires in the pursuit of his responsibilities based on our statutory

* authority. In other words, there is a need, from cur standpoint, for both

authoritative and definitive guidelines. The statutes give us the authority.
The Executive order would define our national security objectives.

Members of Congress, including such men as Senator Robert C.

_ Byrd of West Virginia, have proposed legislation to spell out jurisdiction and

authority of the FBI in this field. It would appear that the President would
rather spell out his own requirements in an Executive order instead of having
Congress tell him what the FBI might do to. help him fulfill his obligations and
responsibilities as Fresident.

* The political climate of suspicion and distrust resulting from

. disclosures coming out of the Watergate hearings could present an obstacle

to getting any such Executive order signed in the immediate future. However,
the rationale is nevertheless valid and when scrutinized closely, the language
in the Executive order we hereinafter propose establishes definitive guidelines
which have heretofore been unclear. It igs my belief that we should go forward
with this.

We therefore propose and recommend that an Executive order
along the following lines be submitied te the White House with a strong
recommendation for approval. The language which follows is merely to
iustrate the type of Executive order which we think would be appropriate
and does not necessarily represent an ideal format or style which should
be submitted to the White House.

killing of police officers who, by their uniform, are a symbol of the democratic
establishment; hijacking of aircraft in furtherance of revolutionary movements:
terrorist assaults on foreign diplomatic personnel and establishments; and open
declaration of war on our form of government are only. a few of the violent acts
which have been perpetrated by domestic subversives who seek to destroy or

- seriously cripple our Government. Terrorist guerrilla attacks which were

- once confined to far away places and related to problems of no immediate con-
eern of ours are now possible in this country. Foreign terrorist groups in
collusion with domestic terrorists have laid plans for an airport massacre of
the type which recently occurred in Israel. Other foreign terrorist elements
have laid plans for terrorist attacks on American soil. Already one foreign
official has been assassinated, possibly by terrorists.

It would be folly to adopt an investigative policy based on
the concept of investigation only when there is reason to believe a crime
involving the national security has been committed. The FBI must
obviously anticipate the crimes deseribed above. We believe that in
-order for the Government to be in position to defend itself against revolu-
tionary and terrorist efforts to destroy it, the FBI must have sufficient
investigative authority to conduct intelligence-type investigations not
normally associated with enforcement of the statutes. in other words we
think the President has the inherent Executive power to expand by further
defining the FBI's investigative authority to enable it to develop advance
information concerning the plans and aspirations of terrorists and revolu-
tionaries who seek to overthrow or destroy the Government. However, we
also believe that such expanded authority must be formally set forth in an
Executive order and that this recommendation is responsive in the Attorney
General's expressed interest in leying more formal guidelines to our work
in areas where definition is not now clear.

We consider the issuance of a new Executive order delineating
our jurisdiction, authority, and responsibility to gather and report intelligence
information relating to the national security to be a very important and high
priority matter. We believe the issuance of guidelines by the Attorney General
under Title 28, Section 533, United States Code, to be equally important.

For your information, our own investigative guidelines as con-
tained in our Manual of Instructions relating to domestic subversive investiga-
tions have been completely rewritten fo conform with the concept that our
domestic intelligence-type investigations are based on Federal statutes. These
‘guidelines provide that in each instance, the domestic intelligence investigation
must be predicated on information indicating that the organization or individual
is engaged in activity which could involve a violation of specific statutes relating
to the national security. A copy of the new guidelines was previously provided

" to the Department of Justice in connection wiih the request of Senator Edward M.

Kennedy to obtain a copy of the FBI's Section 87 of the Manual of Instructions.
The effective date of the new guidelines was August 1, 1973.

The Deputy Attorney Generai

After assuming the office of Director I have had an
opportunity to afford further thought to this question and appreciate that
there are some substantial considerations that question whether the
Director of the FBI should be restricted to a given term of office. From
a practical standgoiut, it {s doubted that legislation to specificclly restrict
the term of office of a Presidential appointee is necessary. We know of
no clear-cut authority to remove an official who has received a Presidential
appointment. However, in the final analysis, the President would likely
get his way because he has the power to appoint a suceessor, in this case
the Director. In effect, in absence of tenure, the Director will be serving
at the pleasure of whoever is President.

Should the position of Director of the FBI be singled out for
restriction as te term of office? An informal check by this Bureau has
disclosed no restrictions on the tenure of heads of cther investigative
agencies; namely, Central Intelligence Agency, Drug Enforcement
Administration, and Seeret Service. Accordingiy, to single out the
Directorship of the FBI would be in effect an exeeption. To provide
tenure for the Director of the FBI would be tantamount fo placing him
in the same category as heads and commissioners of regulatory bodies
and the Interstate Commeree Cormmmission who do serve for specific
periods. The latter officials make regulatory decisions affecting the
Nation and specific terms of office have the effect of assuring a
continuing balance of political power. The office of Director of the
FBI is not political.

Experience has. shown that cooperation by other law
enforcement agencies and the general public has been instrumental
in FBI investigative success. While it cannot be precisely measured,
the degree of confidence inspired by the individual serving as Director
influences the quality and quantity of such cooperation. The office of
Director, a non-political one, has been charged with the responsibility
of providing factual information upon which administrations of diverse
_ political persuasions could formulate prosecutive policy and look after
. the internal pacaenees interests of the country. Singling out the position

The Deputy Attorney General

of Director of the FBI for a restricted term of offtee could suggest
that perhaps the confidence heretofore placed in the FBI is no longer
merited. Whether this would have any impact on the confidence and
ccoperation by the public would be problematic.

After weighing the foregoing and considering the unique
role of and r:gerd for the Director of the FAI, it is my conclusion that
the Nation would feel comfortable with tenure for the Director of the :

. KBE, and tenure would contribute toward countering any constreetion |
that appointment of any Director was political in the sense that the !
Directorship would not necessarily change hands with each administration.
I feel the incumbent sences a greater independence through tenure.

I feel that tenure should be for a perlod such as nine years
to minimize the occasions when appointive consideration would coincide
with a change in administrations. Such a period would also provide the |
incembent a sufficient feeling of independence. However, this Buresu
defers to the Department on the subject of leagth of time.

A brief look at history indicates that in 1908 Congress cane
the Bureau of investigation and designated it as a part of the Departm
of Justice. The main reason for this action was that a certain void
existed prior to this time in the enforcement function performed by the§
Attorney General, While the Department traditinnally bore the responsi-
bility of enforcing the laws of the United States and prosectiting violators uv |
of ee laws, there existed no permanent group of individuals who could

‘conduct the fact-finding investigations necessary to sustain successful
prosecutions, The creation of this “detective” force by sai itil aimed
to Mond that void, .

: ’ Over the years the responsibilities of this agency, which pierces
became known as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), have increased
tremendously. From a small agency charged with the task of conducting
investigations regarding relatively few matters, the FBI has developed into
an agency held accountable for investigating violations of over 180 categories
of Federal Law. In addition, the FBI has become more than just an investi-
gating agency, due to ite maintenance of various data in certain areas
indispensable to a criminal justice system.

The proposal to make the FBI an independent agency within the
Executive Branch has been voiced on several occasions in Congress.
Within the very recent past two bills were introduced in the Senate to
achieve this aim. Additionally, as far back as 1947, Congressional
sentiment existed to separate the FBI as an independent agency.

The proponents of this move have made it clear that the possi-
bility of a politically motivated FBI has caused them great concern and
led to the introduction of measures which they feel would go a long way
toward preventing undue political influence. The argument is made that
the Attorney General is almost always a political appoiniee of the President,
whose views generally conform with his own. Those espousing this argu-
ment point to recent events as examples of how an Attorney General could
use his position to political advantage and fear that because of this-mciivation
“he could easily manipulate an agency possessing vast amounts of sensitive x
information and substantial resources, such as the FBI, and easily misuse :
this organization which is subject to his directives as a part of the Depart-
ment he heads,

: The question Seaeee! at this point whether : Peet of. the FBI from
the Department of Justice is the proper means of assuring its justifiable
degree of independence and freedom from undue political pressure. The



ers of the FBI as an rpeiy agency ‘would pee mean
that the Director wouid no longer report to the Attorney General, but
would instead be responsible directly to the White House, as is the
ease with existing independent agencies. There appears to be some
serious doubt whether an FEL Director would ke more or less subject
to political pressure when. placed in this posture, The FBI must be
responsive to the desires and needs of the American public and in
this sense only should it be considered politically responsive. The
danger of becoming enmeshed in partisan political dealings might easily
be increased by removing this additional layer of Executive Branch
responsibility which now exists in the person of the Attorney General.

: Opponents of these proposed Senate bills note that, while some
danger does exist in the FRI's reporting to a political appointee, a far
greater danger would exist if the FBI, performing as an independent
agency, became the arm of a politicaliy motivated Director who was
responsible to no one but the White House.

ics " When one considers the possibility of an ae FBI, it is
difficult to ignore the specter of a national police force at the disposal
of the incumbent administration, a condition generally repugnant to our
citizens.

: The relationship between the veneer and the prosecutor is
avery delicate, yet vital one. Neither can properly fulfill his role
‘without the wholehearted assistance of the other. So it is with the FBI

. and the Department of Justice. A close working relationship has
developed and must be maintained if the responsibilities of each are
to be met, :

‘The FBI does need a certain amount of independence and this
fact has been recognized by even its most severe critics, in addition,
Congress, in creating a new Subcommittee on FBI Gversight, has in
effect insured a certain degree of FBI independence.

. Issue #6: Assuming the FEI remains a part of the Justice
Department, what should be the relationship of the Director to the Attorney
General? All the organizational and substantive chaseenituti ae shouid be
examined.

1. The problem: By Caeeioal enactment, the Attorney
General has been designated the head of the Department of Justice and has
been charged with the responsibility of supervising and directing the
administration and operation of that Department. Further, the Federal
Bureau of Investigation has been placed in the Department of Justice with -
the Director of the FBI as its head. The FBI, through Congressional
enactment, Executive Order, and Directive of the Attorney General, has
been charged with the responsibility of performing certain duties subject.
to the general supervision and direction of the Attorney General. The Director
of the FBI, a Bureau chief within the Department, having been granted
enormous responsibility, musi atiain a proper balance between independence
and responsiveness in order to properly discharge this responsibility. 7

2. The present policy: Disclosures of political and business
corruption and unethical practices during the investigation of land-fraud and
antitrust cases in the early 1900's, coupled with the recognition of the need
for an investigative arm within the Department of Justice subject to its
control, led to the creation of the Eureau of Investigation (forerunner of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation) within the Department in 1908. in an effort
to reverse a trend of political influence within the Bureau and the Department,
Attorney General Harlan Fiske Stone in 1224 appointed J. Edgar Hoover as
Acting Director of the Bureau, Shortly thereafter Attorney General Stone
dictated that the Director of the FBi be directly responsible to him with respect
to the operations of the Eureau as a whole. in addition, it was understood that
the Bureau was to operate iree oi political influence and limit its investigative
activity to certain violations over which the Bureau had jurisdiction.

This pact was formed to give the Director, charged primarily
with delegated investigative responsibility, a degree of independence
recognized as so necessary for him to properly discharge his duties and

; NW 65360 Docld:32989541 Page 97



still remain subordinate to the Attorney General, who had been charged
primarily with a prosecutive function. Codification of duties to be performed
by the Attorney General as head of the Department oi Justice, and the Director |
ag head of the FBI within that Department, plus recognition that both must
attempt to perform their related duties within the criminal justice system

to the optimum, has led to the necessity for a substantial degree of inde-
pendence on the part of the Director, balanced with a responsiveness by

him to reasoned counsel, guidance, supervision and control by the Attorney
General. i

3. The issues raised:

(a) During the “Princeton Conference" it was said that time and
practice have made the FBI a totally separate power answerable to no .cne.
More specifically, the Attorneys General, Fresidents and Congress have
granted power and responsibility to the FBI but have failed to direct, guide
and control it.

({b) During the course of the FBI investigation of the “Watergate
break-in, * allegations were made that the FEI has been too responsive to
demands made upon it, particularly those of a political nature.

4, Options for future policy:’ The Director of the FBI, as head

of the principal investigative Eureau within the Department of Justice,

must be permitted to discharge his responsibilities iree from political or
unethical pressure. This must be balanced with his responsibility to remain
responsive to the Attorney General's leadership and direction of that Depart-
ment having as one of its principal functions the enforcement of the Federal
-law through prosecniion, A Congressional oversight committee, available
to give the FBI counsel, guidance and direction, could greatly assist the FBI
in achieving and maintaining this balance.

There must be an efficient working relationship, with free and
open channels of communication between the Director and the Attorney
General, due to their mutual and interlocking responsibilities in the criminal
justice field, primarily investigative on the part of the FEI and prosecutive
on the part of the Department. This relationship should generate, at
descending levels in the Department and the FBI, a commitment to accomplish
.an efficient work flow, in appreciation of the impact of this interaction on the

“26

NW 65360_Docld:32989541 Page 98



-..entire criminal justice system. Because of the multiple and varied responsi-
- bilities of the FBI, the Attorney General-Director relationship and the i
counterpart division relationships should insure a smooth and coordinated
effort which will enable the accomplishment of major objectives, while at
_ ', the same time providing necessary FBI services to other elements of the
- eriminal justice system. PEEEEEEEEEEE a cr

7 That we are well aware of our role and sesponsibilities in this
Tegard, and to cite only one of several examples, is evidenced by the opera-
tion of the Computerized Criminal History Program which provides much
needed data to all branches of the system. Thus, to the extent possible, i
these relationships should be such that both objective achievement and cri
assistance between components oi the systems are enhanced. : :

: With regard to other continuing relationships having a ae on
| + the Attorney General-FBI Director relationship, the FRI head must communi-
: eate directly with the Eresident on occasion, and with the recent esiablish-

ment of a Congressional oversight committee, direct contact will be main-
. tained with this group. Concerning uitimate alternatives in the relationship,
. the FBI Director must be in a position to register reasoned disagreement at
I. .. times and, if the situation dictates, to take up important matters of disagree-
i ment with the President and with the Congressional oversight committee.

FILES AND THEIR DISCLOSURE

I. Problem:

Mr. William D. Ruckelshaus, in item #8 of memorandum to the Director
dated 1/20/73, stated, ''The whole question of files and their disclosure must
be studied with a view toward understanding why files are kept, what categories
of files there are, what information is contained in the files and whether the
purposes for maintaining files are being met under present policy. In the
issue of disclosure, when, where, and ‘to whom must also be thoroughly
examined. ' |

As problems involved in creation and maintenance of files and disclosure
of information contained in them are rather complex they are being discussed
separately. Identification Division records consisting of fingerprint cards
and identification records (Rap Sheets) are not considered to fall in this
category of "Files" and their use is not being commented upon.

it, Present Policy
A. Why Files Are Kept:

Age of information in FBI files covers a relatively short span of years.
FBI had very few files until the President in 1939, directed the FBI be responsible
for the Internal Security of the United States. In view of this, andasthe number {
af violations of law over which the FBI has jurisdiction has nearly doubled since
1939, the vast majority of FBi files have been created since +939,

Regulations of National Archives and Records Service, (NARS) General
Services Administration, which are based on Title 44, Chapter 33, Sections
3301 and 2302, U.S. Code, govern the type of ma 1 which we m must maintain.
Record material is described as including "all books, papers, maps, photegr
er other documentary materials, regardless of physical form or cheracte:
made or received by an agency of ti.2 United States Governmont under Feder
Law or in connection with the transaction of public business and preserved or
1 appeopriate for preservation by that agency or its Ievitimate successor as
f evidence of the organization, functions, policies, decisioas, procedures
tions, or other activities of the Government or because of the informational
value of data contained therein,"

This document is prepared in response to your request and is not for dissemi-
nation ovtside your Committee. Its use is limited to -official proceedings by
your Committee and the content may nut as aati to unauthorized person-
nel without the express approval 6

oa A (CONTINUED vis)"

NW 65360 Docld:32989541 Page 106



ate elietnentnnnnsin nt nn nnd mtr seenatasnasa

In view of this definition of record material, we are required to retain
any material which we have made or received during the course of public
business, and which has been preserved or is appropriate for preservation.

In 1969, NARS surveyed the records of the Department of Justice
including those of FBI and subsequently instructed that certain categories
of FBI files at FBIHQ be retained indefinitely. Included were files which
would have historical value and would document policies, procedures, functions,
budgetary policies, etc. In addition, vast majority of investigative files must ~
be kept indefinitely although it was prescribed that only a representative samplin
of certain types of lations at five year intervals be retained. These require-
ments apply only to filés at FBIHQ. NARS has previously approved destruction
of closed field files as all pertinent information is in file at FBIHQ. Asa
practical matter, however, field investigative files are retained 20 years
before being destroyed.

ag

: =a to
The FBI has an active program to keep its records at ee barest

minimum, While certain categories of our files, as previously mentioned, must
be retained permanently, some are obsolete and valueless. With approval of
WARS we destroy certain categorics of such obsolete material. Examples of
the larger categories are: Results of investigations over 25 years old regarding
alleged subversive and espionage activities wherein complaints were nebulous
and no derogatory information was developed, and investigations where the
perpetrators of the crimes were never identified.

In order to reduce ~mount of storage space required for files we
microfilm, with approval of NARS, majority of files regarding criminal
violations which are over 10 years old.

B. Categories of Files

Material is filed into one of the following general types of files:

Main Files

A main file is opened on an individual, organization, or subject matter
when there will be an adequate volume of mail or the matter is deemed of
sufficient importance to be assembled in one place. Main files are referred
to as "Case Files" when we are making an investigation,

INW 65360 Docld:32989541 Page 107



General Files
General files are used for nonspecific violations, complaints over
which we have no jurisdiction, and miscellaneous matters, General files-are
also maintained on various individuals; organizations; foreign, local, and state
law enforcement agencies as well as Federal agencies (for information regarding
cooperation, liaison, general organization, etc.); associations; patriotic organi-
zations such as the American Legion; newspapers, magazines, radio and television
stations which cooperate with the Bureau in publishing fugitives.and to whom we
give press releases; and activities of foreign nations such as Soviet and satellite
activities, etc, :

Control Files

Control files are maintained for the purpose of having all information
regarding a specific matter immediately available without the necessity of
reviewing numerous case files, An example is ''Threats Against the President,"
Individual case files are opened for each threat on which we conduct an investi-
gation; however, a copy is placed in the control file so that all such threats are
recorded in one place,

Policy Files
A policy file is maintained for each violation over which the FBI has
investigative jurisdiction along with various specific programs arising from
this jurisdiction, :

‘Administrative Files

Administrative files are maintained on statistical reports, appropriations,
conferences, training schools, FBI National Academy matters, and related
subjects,

Set-up Files

These are files which are set up by locality or special « tegory with
subs for field offices, states, continents, or foreign nations, Almost any type
of file can be made a set-up file if the volume of mail expected is great enough
or if the supervision of the subject matter is divided among several Special
Agent Supervisors according to locality,

j NW 65360 Docld:32989541 Page 108



C. Type of Information Contained in the Files

7 :
Generally speaking, there are no limits as to the type of information
ju our files. The FBI, by the very nature of its jurisdiction and its worldwide
reputation as an elite law enforcement agency, attracts information. In addition
to being responsible for investigations relating to interstate criminal activity
throughout the United States, the FBI is also responsible for the Internal Security
of the United States. Any intelligence organization survives on information
uncovered by investigation or received from other sources. Citizens write to
the FBI regarding any matter which they feel is against the best interests of the
United States or where they feel an individual or organization might be violating
alaw. The average citizen is not aware of the jurisdiction of the various
investigative agencies, local, state or Federal and many of them bring their
problems to the FBI. The FBI will promptly disseminate any matter which is
under the jurisdiction of another agency to that agency. The nondisseminated
information is either acted upon and filed, -or filed because no action is required.

In addition to the filing of material relating to criminal and security
matters, the Bureau is responsible for a number of applicant-type (background)
investigations and the information developed during these investigations is filed.

D. Disclosure of Information in FBI Files

i. Responsibility for Proper Utilization of Information

Among the foremost of the FBI's responsibilities is the proper utilization
of information received either through investigative activities or through other
mens as this information may be of vital interest to another Government agency
or a local law enforcement agency. It is extremely important that the FBI keep
these agencies informed concerning matters in which they would have a legitimate
interest. Information is disseminated at both field and Headquarters level, with
FBIHQ making the information available to Federal agencies at the national level.

2. Basis for Dissemination

a. To Government Agencies

The FBI is under cbligation to act as a clearing house for information which
affects the Internal Security of the United States. This obligation is based on the
folowing: : ;

‘{ NW 65360 Docld:32989541 Page 109



1. ‘Beginning in 1939, various Presidential directives requested all
law enforcement officers to report information regarding espionage, sabotage,
subversive activities and related matters to the FBI. These directives charge
the FSI with the responsibility of correlating the material and referring maiters
under jurisdiction of other Federal agencies to the appropriate agencies.

2. The Delimitations Agreement between the FBI and the Armed Forces
intelligence agencies provides that the responsibilities assumed by one organization
in a given field carries with it the obligation to exchange freely and directly with
other subscribing organizations all information of mutual interest. In addition,
a supplemental agreement, provides that certain information of general interest
to the intelligence services of the Armed Forces be furnished them. ~

3. The National Security Act of 1947 provides that upon written request
from the Director of Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) the Bureau shall make
| available information for correlation, evaluation and dissemination essential to
| national security. :

4, Executive Order 10450 (Security of Government Employees) requires
the FBI to check names of all civil applicants and civil incumbents of any
department or agency of the Executive Branch against records of the FBI.

5. Supplement Number Four (Revised) of Departmental Order 3464,
signed by the Attorney General in January, 1953, classified all official records
and information of the FBI as "Confidential. "’ However, in accordance with
long-standing policy concurred in by the Attorney General, the practice of
passing to other Government agencies information coming to the FBI's attention
in connection with the conduct of investigations normally within the Bureau's
jurisdiction was entirely appropriate and correct. The Attorney General advised
the Bureau it would be remiss in its duty if it failed to pass along information
which rnight prove of interest to the general welfare. ~

bp. White House Requests

Pursuant to requests from the White House, the names of individuals who
attend, serve or perform at White House functions, or who may be considered
for Presidential appointments are checked against Bureau files including
Identification Division records for any derogatory data which indicates the indi-
vidual might pose a threat or embarrassment to the President or members of
his family. Such requests are handled expeditiously and any derogatory infor-
mation is reported directly to the White House staff security officer by appropriate
communications depending upon the time factors involved. At the request of
the White House, the FBI conducts background investigations on Presidential
appointees, White House employees and Cahanine having regular access to the
White House.

“Bo ce
NUW'65360~BUcIdl:32989544—Page4Q————



For a number of years we have followed the practice of furnishing

significant intelligence information, both in the domestic and foreign areas,
on a timely basis directly to the White House concurrent with the dissemination
of the same data to the Attorney General and other interested agencies, The
Bureau disseminates by teletype to the White House and other interested agencies
summary data concerning civil unrest and acts of violence as they occur in the’. - -
U.S. We also provide the White House by letter or teletype, as circumstances
indicate, top-level intelligence data developed through our sources when it
appears the President or senior members of his staff would have an interest,
Much of this originates with our Legats and through our coverage of foreign
establishments in the U.S: Simultaneous dissemination is made to the Attorney
General who is advised of our dissemination to the White House. i

Jt is noted that frequently the value of information being disseminated
. depends entirely on the timeliness of our dissemination. Therefore, direct
and immediate dissemination to the White House is the only effective way to
handle these matters.

FBI Legal Counsel on 1/20/72, set forth the opinion that the FBI had no
legal basis to disseminate information to the White House concerning a current
criminal case, It is the obligation of the FBite keep the orney General
fully informed and leave further dissemination to him. Acting FBI Director
Gray instructed this policy be followed and we have been complying with this
direction.

c. Exceptions

1. Congressional Committees

The Attorney General on 6/14/54, ruled that the FBI shall make name
checks and investigations of individuais being considered for staff positions of
the following Congressional Committees when such requests are made by the
chairmen:

a. Senate and House Appropriations Committee ©

b. Senate and House Judiciary Committee

ec. Joint Committee on Atomic Energy
7 (Cooperation extended to this Committee pursuant to
‘the Atomic Energy Act of 1946)

d. Senate Armed Services Committee

of \

NW 65360 Docld:32989541 Page 111” ~5 (a) -



e. Senate Foreign Relations Committee
2. Supreme Court
The Bureau conducts name checks for the Supreme Court, which checks

are normally limited to employees such as charwomen, elevator operators and

fe individuals of this type.

3. Foreign Intelligences Services

As a matter of cooperation with friendly intelligence services, the Bureau
conducts name checks for the following such agencies who have Baison
feprenceenyes stationed i in Washington, D.C.

- Royal Canadian Mounted Police (Canada)
be MI-5 British Security Service :

ce. Australian Security Intelligence eer en
d. New Zealand Security Service (New Zealand)

: e. French Foreign Intelligence and Counterespionage
Service

£. MI-6 (British Secret itenigence Service) |
& BFSS (Bureau For State Security) “outh Africa)

In Addition, name check requests are conducted for cooperative foreign.
police and intelligence services through the Bureau's Legal Attaches stationed
in foreign countries. In a very limited number, name check requests are
handled for cooperative foreign police agencies by direct correspondence.

i. d. To Local and State Law Enforcement Agencies

The FBI traditionally has csoperated with local and state law enforcement
agencies in matters of common interest. Pertinent information regarding local
criminal matters if furnished to local and state law enforcement agencies when
such dissemination will not jeopardize FBI investigations or informants, During

Fiscal Year 1973, 189,910 items of criminal information were furnished by the
( FBI to local and state law enforcement avencies,

’ \ ona tae

NW 65360 Docld:32989541 Page 112



E. Type of Information Disseminated

Name check requests received from agencies within the Executive
Branch, as a general rule, are checked against FBI files for "'subversive-type" ~
references only and criminal-type references are not reviewed. However, for
some agencies, at their specific request, all references in Bureau files are
reviewed. All agencies are aware of the limitation on the type of search made
as they are furnished a copy of an FBI booklet describing procedures for
requested name checks.

The policy of disseminating only "subversive-type" information is based
on the fact that any agency desiring to obtain a copy of the individual's identificatio
record showing his arrests may do so by submitting a separate request directly
to the Identification Division. A second reason for limiting the search is due to
economy as searching criminal-type references would require additional personnel
and an increase in the cost of conducting name checks.

SAAN ana YO tienen

In response to name check requests, the Bureau disseminates the results
of Bureau investigations, information received from reliable sources concerning
membership in subversive groups, pertinent public source information, and.
information which good judgment and common sense dictate should be furnished.
Information falling in the category of rumor or gossip which is found in Bureau
files is not disseminated unless a compelling reason exists therefor, and when
such information is disseminated to a requesting agency, that agency is alerted
to the nature of the information and the fact that it has not been verified by the
FBI. * :

Derogatory information on Federal employees is furnished to the Civil
Service Commission and where common sense dictates, it is also furnished to
the employing agency. 7

F. How Dissemination is Made . -

I. Name Checks

When possible a copy of the FBI communications is furnished to the
requesting agency. A record is maintained on the original of this communication.
.that a copy was furnished to the particular agency. When information is located
in numerous FBI communications, the pertinent data is abstracted and summarize
into a separate communication. A copy of this communication is retained in FBI
files. Agri

Risa Dike taintsaeaneimah i MielDinatatedy meal Sain aretadr taiAiainentiees]

2. Other Than Name Check Requests

Any information received by the FBI which is of interest to another
Federal Agency is furnished in writing to that agency. :

G. Protection of Information Disseminated

When reports or letterhead memoranda already in the file are disseminated
to a requesting agency, each such document contains the following statement:

"This document contains neither recommendations
: “ * nor conclusions of the FBI. It is the property of
the FBI and is loaned to your agency; it and its
contents are not to be distributed outside your
agency.’ 7 7 inet

Data abstracted from the files and disseminated by letter or in letterhead
_ memoranda form contains, in substance, terminology appearing above. 5

Im. Issues

Basic issue appears to be whether FBI should retain and disseminate
information in its files which is not acquired as a direct result of its investi-
gations. z :

IV. Options

There are-no options. We are required by law to retain information
which has been made or received in connection with the transaction of public
business and which has been preserved or which is appropriate for preservation
as evidence of the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures,
operations, or other activities or because of the informational value of data
contained there. With respect to the dissemination of information to Federal
agencies, we are required by law, Presidential directives, and instructions
of theAttorney General to furnish information in our files to agencies of the
Executive Branch. The exception: cited previously are logical and no change
is believed necessary.

Likewise, the welfare of the general public requires that we continue.
our policy of furnishing pertinent information regarding local criminal matters
to local and state jaw enforcement agencies.

“96 Problem - The question of a Civilian Review Board for the intelligence-
gathering activities of the FBI should be examined. This is a recurrent

suggestion which came up at the Princeton Conference, in addition to other
forums. F

icy - There is no Civilian Review Board to monitor the FBI inasmuch
as oon checks and reins are available to check or control the FBI.
(See Options) i :

Issue - Is it necessary to have a group of civilians review the FBI's
policy and activities to insure that nothing eee is sa done and to
handle complaints regarding the FBI?

Options ~ No Civilian Review Board is vequired sinee numerous means-
exist to control the FBI. These specifically include: a Senate Oversight
Committee, the Senate and House Appropriations Committees, the Office
of Management and Budget, the National Security Council, the President's
Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, the Civil Service Commission, the :
Attorney General, the Department of Justice, the Federal Courts, the news

. Media, and of course public opinion. The President's Foreign Intelligence :
Advisory. Board is in reality a civilian review board for the President.
Its members are non-government personnel qualified in matters relating

. to national defense on the basis of their knowledge and experience.
Especially is the FBI opposed to the concept of civilian boards exploring
the field of FBI counterintelligence and intelligence-gathering operations
which would adversely affect this Bureau's relations with foreign intelli-
gence agencies. In general, we feel that the Congressional oversight
concept should have put this question to rest.

I. “THE PROBLEM:

: ‘What should be the relationship between the Federal Bureau of
‘. Investigation and the other Departments.and Agencies of the Federal Govern- ~
ament? To what extent should the Federal Bureau of Investigation keep tabs
*on other Departments and Agencies through the development of sources and
sinformants in those Agencies?

TL THE PRESENT POLICY: _ : : SEES oad

-A. Relationship between the Federal Bureau of Investigation and
-other Departments and Agencies of the Federal Government

: ’ The Federal Bureau of Investigation enjoys a close working

-relationship with the other Departments and Agencies. of the Federal Govern-
= ‘ment and traditionally has cooperated fully with local, State and Federal 7
agencies in matters of common interest.

‘Cooperation among the Federai Bureau of Investigation and other
Federal Departments and Agencies takes-a variety of forms, including high-
Jevel coordinating committees, contractual agreements, and written suide-
lines for investigative jurisdiction in areas in which the Federal Bureau of |
investigation and one or more Departments or Agencies have concurrent juris-
diction and share responsibility for enforcing a Federal Statute. The purposes
of the committees, agreements, and guidelines are to promote the closest
possible cooperation and coordination between the involved agencies, to insure

there is no duplication of effort in any field, and to insure that proper coverage :

is maintained.

In addition to the above cooperative means, the Federal Bureau *
-of Investigation maintains the following programs relevant to its relation-
ship with other Federal Agencies and Departments:

4, FBI Liaison Program

In order to insure adequate and effective liaison arrangements
. wiih other Government agencies, the Federal Bureau of Investigation main-
tains a Liaison Section within iis Intelligence Division at Federal Bureau of
Investigation Headquarters. ‘The objective of this section is to insure that
the Federal Bureau of Invesiigation's business with other U. S. Government
_ Agencies is accomplished promptly, effectively, econornically, and with a
minimum of jurisdictional or policy problems, through appropriate high-
level liaison with key officials of these Agencies, paces

By the establishment of effective liaison contacts, we recognize.
and solve minor problems before they become major problems, requiring

--protracted and expensive negotiations between the Federal Bureau of investi-
‘gation and other Agencies. These objectives are achieved by placing experience

~ FBI representatives in contact with officials at the highest levels of other

Government Agencies where the Federal Bureau of Investigation either needs
‘assistance or has concurrent interests: ‘The Federal Agencies with which the
: Federal Bureau of Investigation currently maintains direct personal liaison are:

-a) The White House

{c) National Security Council
.. d) Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board

_ NW 65360 Docld:32989541 Page 120

{o) U. S. Marshal Service

Liaison with other Federal Agencies is handled by receiving
-telephone calls and visits from representatives of those Agencies, and by
~contacts with them on an irregular basis as the need may arise.

In addition to maintaining close liaison with various Federal
Agencies at the Headquarters level in Washington, D.C., FBI regulations

-eall for an effective liaison program at the field level.

“The Special Agents

ain Charge (SACs) of the FBI's fifty-nine field offices are directed to speci-
‘fically designate an Agent (or Agents) to be responsible for developing and
maintaining liaison with other Federal Agencies represented locally. In
each instance, liaison contacts are developed to include a.closé friendly
relationship, mutual understanding of the Federal Eurcau of Investigation
and Agency jurisdictions, and an indicaicd willingness by the Agency repre-
sentative to coordinate activitics and to discuss problems of mutual interest.

< \



.2. Dissemination of Information

’ The proper utilization of information received by the FBI,
“gither through investigation or otherwise, is foremost among our responsi-
bilities. Such information may be of vital interest to another Government
Agency and/or local law enforcement agency, and it is not FBI policy to
withhold from dissemination information to which other agencies are justi-
fiably entitled. Dissemination of information to other agencies is handled at
-. the Headquariers level in Washington, D.C., as well as in the field,

- The FBI serves as a clearing house for information affecting the
“internal security of the United States. This is based on various Presidential
directives which have specifically requested all law enforcement officers to

report information regarding espionage, sabotage,- subversive activities,

and related matters to the FBI. These directives charge the FBI with the

responsibility of correlating this material and referring matters which are’

“under the jurisdiction of any other Federal Agency with responsibilities in

this fieid to the appropriate Agencies. y

“Various agreements between the FBI and other Federal Agencies

-provide for exchange of information of mutual interest and require that the
FBI disseminate certain information to other Departments and Agencies of
the Federal Government. An example is the agreement between the FBI and
U. S. Secret Service concerning protective responsibilities which requires
that we disseminate to Secret Service certain information which by its Hee
reveals a definite or possible threat to the President's safety.

Under provisions of Executive Order 10450 the FBI checks names
‘of all civil applicants and civil incumbents of any department or agency of the
‘Executive Branch against FBI records.

In August, 1972, the FBI instituted a program aimed at providing
effective and expanded coordination of efforts with the local, state and Federal
Agencies having direct responsibilities in the narcotics field. Each FBI

+ office has designated an Agent to act ina liaison capacity as a narcotics
soordinaior and FBI Headquirters has designated a national narcotics
coordinator io expedite this program. Any information received by the FBI
concerning narcotics is promptly disseminated to the Drug Enforcement
Administration, which is charged with the responsibility of enforcing the
various drug laws.

NW 65360 Docld:32989541 Page 121



- Laboratory are. made available on a cost-free basis to all Federal Agencies in

3. Cooperative Services

in its traditional role of seeking professionalism at all levels
of law enforcement, the FBI is enthusiastically committed to providing
expert assisiance to local, State and Federal law enforcement agencies.
“Some of ihe facilities of the FBI available to Federal law enforcement
sagencies are:
(a) The FBI Identification Division. The FBI is the central repository for
-finger print identification information. - Data from the identification records
are furnished to law enforcement and governmental agencies at the Federal,
State, and local levels for official use only.

{b) The FBI Laboratory. The FBI maintains a well-equipped technical laboratoy
at its Headquarters in Washington, D.C., for the investigative and probative
ase of local, State and Federal law enforcement agencies, and prosecutors
throughout the United States. An excellent working relationship now exisis’
between the FBI Laboratory and the laboratories of other Federal Agencies
for ithe exchange of technical data and procedures. The services of the FBI

~civil and criminal matters, and to State-and local law-enforcement agencies
in criminal maiteys only. Expanded programs of scientific aid and trainingto
State and local crime laboratories are presently under development and wili
involve the continuing, close cooperative efforts.of local, Siate and Federal
Agencies and the FBI.

(c) The National Crime Information Center (NCIC). The FBI's NCIC isa
computerized information system established as a service to all law enforce-
ment agencies--local, State and Federal. The system operates by means

-of computers, data transmission over communication lines, and telecommunica4
tion devices. Its objective is to improve the effectiveness of law enforcement
through the more efficient handling and exchange-of documented police informa-
tion. In the beginning NCIC contained data concerning stolen property and
wanted persons. In November, 1971, NCIC operations were expanded to

include a file of offenders' criminal histories, which is known.as the Computeri:
Criminal History (CCH) file.

(ad) The FBI National Academy. Since its establishment in 1935, the FPI
National Academy has provided a professional training program of highest
‘quality to career officers from throughout the law enforcement community.
At its new training facilities at Quantico, Virginia, during Fiscal 1973,

4, 044 officers from various local, state, Federal and friendly. foreign law

enforcement agencies completed the iniensive 12-week course. This course
is designed to enhance an officer's capabilities as a law enforcement
administrator and to better prepare him to teach. his fellow officers,

‘of the Federal Government,

Although many officers from other Federal law enforcement agencies attend
the FBI National Academy each year, the number in attendance is limited
due to the mandate that the FBI provide this service to local and state law
enforcement officers.

‘B. Extent to which the FBI should keep tabs on other Departments
and Agencies through’the development of s sources and informants
tn those Agencies

‘The FBI does not have the authority or responsibility to keep
‘tabs on other Departments and Agencies of the Federal Government;
therefore, it does not have any policy whereby it checks on other Depart-
ments and Agencies. Because of the lack of FBI jurisdiction to keep tabs
‘on other Federal Departments and Agencies, no effort has ever been made

_ for the development of sources and informants in those Agencies for that

“purpose.

Although the FBI does not keep tabs on other Departments and
-Agencies, it has long been an accepted procedure among other Agencies of
the Government thgt the FBI would conduct investigations of violations of
‘Federal law in those Agencies where primary investigative jurisdiction is
‘vested in the FBI, and we do so ona regular basis. Violations of Federal
Jaw involving personnel of other Government Agencies over which the FBI
has statutory investigative jurisdiction include bribery, civil rights,
Fraud Against the Government, Theft of Government Property, and Federal
Housing Adminisiration matiers. This is not a situation unique to the FEL
A comparable situation exists in which the U. S. Secret Service is charged
«with investigating the theft of a Government check. It carries out its ©
responsibilities not only in its own Department (Treasury) but in all other
Federal Agencies as well.

pita THE ISSUES RAISED:

A. Relationship between the Federal Bureau of Investigation and
other Departments and Agencies of the Federal Government

No issues are known to have been raised relative to the FBI's
-present policy regarding its relationship with other Departments and Agcncies

\



“B. Extent to which the FBI should keep tabs on other Departments
rand Agencies through the development of sources and informants
_in those Agencies

In regard to the present policy of not developing sources and
informants in other Federal Depirtments and Agencies for the purpose of
-keeping tabs on those agencies, no issues are known to have been raised.

“ IV. © OPTIONS FOR FUTURE POLICY:

A. Relationship between the Federal Bureau of Investigation and
‘other Departments and Agencies of the Federal Government

It is imperative that there.be.a friendiy, cooperative association
between the FBI and other Departments and Agencies of the Federal Govern-
ment, There must be an efficient working relationship, with free and open
channels of commynications, among all Federal Agencies. The Direcior of
‘the FBI and the heads of other Federal Agencies should confer periodically
on matters of mutual interest and definitely work together on all occasions.

In order to avoid duplication of effort and problems of jurisdictional responsi-
bilities there should be a clear delineation of duties and investigative limits |
for all Federal investigative Agencies. |

A prevailing cooperative spirit throughout the entire Federal

daw enforcement community is a vital necessity in our Nation's war on |
crime and subversion, The rapid escalation of serious crime and the |
complexities of upholding the law in today's society have made it imperative
that information, expertise, and resources be freely and expeditiously shared
‘by all Federal investigative Agencies. Coopera tion is a bilateral obligation.
If the FBI does not continue to cooperate and reciprocate in exchange of

- information and resources with other Federal Agencies, it cannot conduct
@ success{ul operation. “Therefore, itis my recommendation that the FBI
-continue its policy of working closely and cooperating fully with other Depart-
-ments and Agencies of the Federal Government.

NW 65360 Docld:32989541- Page 124. .



-B. Extent to-which the FBI should keep tabs on other Departments
‘and Agencies through the development of sources and informants
in those Agencies

i Inasmuch as no issues have been raised regarding the FBI's
current policy in this area, and since a change in policy involving the FBI
keeping tabs on other Federal Departments and Agencies through the
‘development of sources and informants in those agencies could be most
‘detrimental to all concerned, I recommend there be no change in the FBI's
‘present policy in this area,

11. Problem - Should the FBI pave foreign officers reporting directly to the
Director? ,_ 7 : 7 La
/ oa Policy - The FBI has had Agents stationed abroad in American Embassies

since 1940. This has not been a secret or classified fact. They are known .

as Legal Attaches and are not operational, They do not conduct investiga-

tions but depend upon law enforcement and security agencies of the host -

- government for coverage of FBI leads overseas. They maintain regular i
Haison with such agencies in countries where stationed, as well asin other |

:gounteles that they visit on road ‘trips . ‘
s

: ‘Legal Attaches are 3 regularly called upon to secure in-depth
cooperation from foreign agencies on criminal and security matiers which
are frequently of a complicated and sensitive nature. These matters fre-
quently include requests for surveillances, complicated interviews, informa-

- tion from normally confidential records of foreign agencies, apprehensions
and informal deportations. In order to handle such matters effectively, a
Legal Attache must be proficient in the language of the foreign country
involved and must have an extensive knowledge of its culture, customs and
judicial process. On the other hand, he must have a thorough knowledge of
FBI jurisdiction, regulations and policy. This knowledge, which can only
be achieved through years of experience as an FBI Agent, is extremely broad.

* In addition, in order to maintain the cooperation of foreign
“agencies, Legal Attaches assist these agencies by having investigations con-
" ducted in the United States concerning matters of interest to the foreign
a countries involved. These matters frequently involve major criminal cases,
espionage and terrorist cases which are often of substantive interest to the
FBI. .
Numerous problems arise in connection with handling leads.
abroad and matiers in this country on behalf of foreign countries. Since
each country is different with regard to its laws, customs, language and
_ tradition, the FBI has found it necessary and in fact invaluable to have a
man stationed abroad, on the scene, who can insure that prompt and efficient
action is taken and that cooperative relationships are nurtured and protected.

Isgue ~ Is the FBI to continue using Legal Attaches to meets its pene
abroad? .

Options: Pee : if eseeaeeteee :
.1. Retain FBI representatives to carry out functions which have :
i - “ served since 1940 to assist the FBI and U.S. law enforcement agencies in their

responsibilities having foreign ramifications, as well as to assist foreign law
enforcement and security agencies.

‘The liaison function of FBI representatives serves to develop
, and maintain close, cooperative relationships with police and other investi-
gative agencies of the countries covered. In the modern-day world, with
the speed and facility of communication and transportation, crime has taken
on immense international aspects which require constant liaison attention.

. Accomplishments attained by the EBI through the liaison activities
4 of the Legal Attaches with foreign law enforement agencies in the past fiscal
year (1973) include 1,047 FBI fugitives located; 109 fugitives located for state,
local and other agencies; 167 automobiles recovered; and total property y
recovered worth $2,260,725 .00. : : ;
: “Ret tention of Legal Attaches will permit further accomplishments 7
such as in several specific cases set forth below.. It is firmly believed that
, these successes would not have occurred in the absence of personal and
| . direct FBI liaison with foreign police agencies in the countries involved.

particular Legal Attache. In addition, he recently uncovered an international
_ eae theft ring involving the theft of over 480 cars stolen in the U.S. and
valued at $708, 000.

The Legal Attache, Buenos Aires, located and is currently
‘attempting to. arrange for the return of a subject from Argentina who was
involved in a $200,000 fraudulent traveler's check case, This office has
also been successful in tentatively identifying two individuais in Argentina
who have been involved in the disposition of part of $8,000 worth of securities
and blank money orders stolen in Chicago in 1971 during a robbery in which
the owner was shot. This Legal Attache was commended by the American
Ambassador in Buenos Aires for the part he played in the successful recovery
’ of a hijacked American airliner in Buenos Aires which occurred without loss
of life or damage to the aircraft. The Legal Attache, Buenos Aires, also
played a leading role in preventing Meyer Lansky, the financial wizard of U.S.
organized crime, from receiving asylum in South America. This action resulted
in Lansky's return io the U.S. and arrest by the FBI on Federal criminal ecn-
tempt charges.

: The Legal Attache, London, has valuable contacts not only
with New Scotland Yard but also with all major police departments in
Great Britain. Time end again his office has acted as a conduit in major
cases involving British British and FBI interests. He also maintains close liaison

ane with British intelligence services, The recent rash of letter bombs, one of
AoN & we) of which wounded an employee of the British Embassy in Washington, has
Gore e? ‘galled for immediate and close laison with British authorities. FBI bomb
; ene experts collaborated closely with Scotland Yard in London to the benefit of
of both agencies. Since the U.S. and Great Britain are prime targets of Soviet

- espionage, numerous instances of cooperation in this very delicate end
secretive field have oceurred between the FBI and the British intelligence
service. This would hia most difficult had we not hada Legal Attache stationed
in London, :

“The Legal Attaches in Manila and Mexico City combined in a

joint effort which resulted in the cepture and return to the U.S. of a fugitive

in connection with the theft of over 1 million dollars in California, This

individual had fled to Australia in 1970 and extradition was impossible. The

Legal Attache, Manila, who handles Australia, determined that subject

regularly traveled to Mexico. The Legal Attache, Mexico City, arranged for
‘his apprehension by Mexican authorities on a visit to that couniry.

: -Another example of the importance of foreign offices concerns
the kidnaping of a Mexican child in Pueblo, Mexico, by an American citizen.

. Rensom in the emount of $165,000 was paid in New Orleans and the child was
‘safely recovered in a motel in Louisiana. Mexican police authorities developed
very little information concerning this matter. The Legal Attache, Mexico City,

". however, through investigative guidance established the identity of the kid-
naper and the fact that he had an estranged wife residing in Australia. The
Legal Attache, Manila, working through Australian police had this woman inter-
viewed with negative results. Australian police authorities were then
guided into checking her finances and determined she had received large
sums of money from Tel Aviv, Israel.

The Legal Attache, Tel Aviv, through Israeli police located the
subject, "yecovered part of the ransom money and arranged for his extradition
to the U.S, where he is awaiting trial in New Orleans. There is no doubt
that this case would not have been solved had we not had Legal Attaches in

. the above-mentioned locations. The foreign police agencies involved had
come up with negative information and only through personal contact and
on-the-scene counsel by our experienced Legal Attaches, were local author-
ities able to produce the information required for the successful conclusion
of this case. i :

The Legal Attache, Tel Aviv, has effected a close working

ve
Pu * velationship with Israeli police and intelligence agencies and regularly
cote furnishes information which is vital to our coverage of the militant Jewish
wens Defense League's activities in the U.S. and of Arab terrorist activities. It |
I

is extremely doubtful that we would regulariy receive such information were
it not for the presence of our representative in Israel.

The tracing of Watergate funds by Legal Attache, Mexico City,
through established Mexican banking sources, is another example of the _
capabilities developed by our Legal Attache system. '

2, Attempt to accomplish FB! responsibilities with foreign :
“ramifications by having other Embassy personnel handle FBI work. This 22
option, while removing FBI personnel from foreign embassies, would require
an increase in State Department personnel to assume a work load, based i
on August 31, 1973, figures, of 4,283 FBI cases in the 20 FBI pests abroad, cH ast
including 734 in Mexico, 527 in Hong Kong, 498 in Canada and 401?.. ;
in Great Britain. Expenses involved in the returning of all FBI personnel
and equipment in these 20 offices would bé considerable and wovld be
doubled hy similar expenses to assign additional State Department personnel
abroad to handle the work formerly handled by FBI personnel.

More important, such a change would resuit in the FBI being
represented abroad by personnel with no experience in law enforcement
and no knowledge of the internal policies and regulations of the FBI, It
~would also result in a person outside the Bureau, not under FBI control,
becoming intimately acquainted with numerous sensitive matters and thereby
. opening the gate to leaks or other embarrassing situations from a security
point of view. It is not believed that Foreign Service officers who differ
greatly in background, experience and training from law enforcement officers
: eould effectively represent the FBI with foreign law enforcement and security
‘agencies ‘

| caehas : ’ 3, Have FBI interests abroad handled by the Drug Enforcement

: Agency, Immigration and Naturalization Service, U.S. Customs Service,

’ U.S. Secret Service or other Federal law enforcement agencies which currently

maintain liaison offices abroad. None of these agencies have the broad scope

_. of investigative jurisdiction which the FBI is required to shoulder, Their

foeR - °, standards, policies, methods of operations, investigative techniques and

haan a calibre of personnel differ greatly from that of the Bureau. Some of these

| agencies are actually operational abroad. No matter how well intentioned such :
a representative might be on behalf of the FBI, it is not felt that he would
have the necessary experience and/or knowledge of Bureau operations to
successfully function as a representative of the FBI. Itis, therefore, not
Leet that this option would be advantageous .

4, End all FBI pursuit of foreign ramifications in criminal and
. security responsibilities by FBI personnel stationed abroad and conduct them
by direct communications, This option does not appear to have any edvantageous
_ aspects and ‘would tend to stifle effective foreign liaison. Only a man on the
scene can be thoroughly aware of the local customs, tradition and judicial
process of the numerous foreign countries involved. Each country is different
and the unique understanding of these differences is vital for successful
communication and cooperation. It is not believed that a supervisor stationed
‘in Washington can adequately grasp these unique situations. If such an option
is adopted, it is felt that our present outstanding relationships with hundreds
of foreign police agencies would quickly disintegrate. Furtherfnore, such
communications, because of a lack of direct cable connections with foreign
| countries, would force the FBI to utilize direct mail or public cable systems as
i opposed to secure methods presently being utilized. This would not only
- .°" @reate long delays, but would also pose serious security risks. This option
acco is, therefore, not acceptable.
1 Conclusion

- Por the reasons set out above, it is felt that the only effective
way for the FBI to discharge the full scope of its responsibilities is to maintein
its Haison posts abroad.
