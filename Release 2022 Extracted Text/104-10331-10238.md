It was very good to meet with you again in Washington on June 12.

I am writing to confirm our recent convereation about the CIA's release
of documents about me to the National Archives. fs I explained to you at
cur meeting, I am very displeased that this was done without ny knowled-

wery personal nature. Other pages deal with with some very sensitive
cases. which I gave the Agency about other people. The information in
these rerorts was given freely and accurately by me to the CIA officers
