raised questions, Dointing out that over

the years, all relations with the Dutch authorities bad

been handled through ClAsHe indicated that before there

was any change in procedure, it sould be necessary for

CIA and FBI to come to some form of an agreement. Allen

Dulles subsequently expressed disappointment in that bis

Agency had not been contacted by the Bureau prior to

exploring the liaison arrangement. We eventually conferred

with CIA and came to an agreement satisfactory to all

parties

concerned.

Again, CIA could cite this as an instance where

we failed to coordinate with the Agency in line with

National Security Council Directives.

In the latter part of 1959 we gave consideration to

establishing a Legal

Attache in Copenhagen, Denmark. The

purpose of the assignment was to follow Bureau leads in

Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Holland. He did not inform

• CIA of our intentions.

(26) BUREAU DISSEMINATION OF COUNTERINTELLIGINCE

INFORMATION TO FOREIGN SERVICES - DATE

By letter dated

ДАТЕ

, CIA raised

questions concerning

the propriety of Bureau dissemination

of counterintelligence information to foreign intelligence

services. CIA, at that time, had particular reference to

Information which our Legal Attache had transmitted to the

FoREintelligence service concerninE roB operations. CIA

took the position that pursuant to the coordinating

Directive, the Bureau was obligated to coordinate with

CIA prior to such dissemination.

The particular data

hạd emanated from one of our sensitive ForbeN sources

CODENAME Ne responded to CIA by stating that the

information was the product of an internal security

operation and

did not relate to ady operational activity

abroad, CIA again surrendered. The Agency could argue

that lt was responsible for following soviet matters

with the fella intelligence service and that we had an

obligation of coordinating with the Agency.

TITLE OF BOOK

BOOK AUTHORED BY

In August

1963, we received information ind1-

cating that

material for a book pertaining to activities of U. S.

intelligence activities.

contarted

the Bureau. It was recommended that liaison orally advise

CIA that

AUTHOR

preparing a book con-

cerning U.S. intelligence

agencies. The Director. noted

"I see no reason doing so."

It is not known if. CIA was aware of the contact

with the Bureau. AUTHeR

subsequently published the

book which contained extremely derogatory information

concerning CIA.

(28) COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES - AFRICA

In April, 1960, CIA inquired if the Bureau would

give any consideration to assisting the Agency toward

developing coverage in Africa. CIA was looking for the

services of any Negro informant who might be available.

The Agency also inquired about placing a Negro in the

Communist Party, USA, under a plan which would have as

an eventual objective, the sending of the informant to

SEGRET

•Africa under an appropriate cover and for an extended

We told CIA we had no informants available

because they were necessary for our own operations.

We

took the position that me saw no benefit to be gained by

loaning an informant on a short or long term basis.

This

item is being mentioned because Africa

has become vitally important to U.S. interest, bearing

in mind that böth the Soviets and

Chinese Communists have

made significant inroads into the area.

CIA could argue

that as early as 1960, it had the foresight to recognize

the need for additional coverage, that it appealed to the

Bureau for assistance, and that we did not cooperate.

(29) ADVISING THE WHITE HOUSE REGARDING CRITICISM

OF INTELLIGENCE OPERATIONS - EUROPE

By letter dated October 23, 1964, we furnished

the White House information received

by our Legal Attache

from the

SOURGE

He was critical

of intelligence operations in Europe and made particular

reference to the overstaffing of personnel.

He do not know if. CIA became cognizant of the

existence of the Bureau letter bearing in mind that the

Agency undoubtedly would have considered the document as

relating to its operations.

We do knöw that for several years,

CIA personnel have been assigned to the thite House and had

access to considerable information.

(30) THE PRESIDENT'S FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE ADVISORY

BOARD AND JOHN LAC CONB

In day, 1963, we became embroiled with CIA in a

rather critical conflict as a result of communication the

Bureau sent to the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory

Board.

The matter dealt with consideration that might be

given to increasing wire taps on diplomatic establishnents.
