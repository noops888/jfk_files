A erie UPRISING JULY 26, 1953

The July-27, 1953, issue of the biiani Herald
ed an article entitled "Rebels Fail to Seize Two
GUTHO<TH, Herald Staff Writer, who
veported that fifty-three persons were killed and dozens
wounded early Sunday (July 26, 1953) when armed rebels
disguised as soldiers failed to seize two Cuban army
een against the regime of President
‘This article disclosed thet the main
uprising occurred at Santiago de Cuba in Oriente Province
and that a rural guard post in the city of Bayamo, 150 miles
northwest of Santiago was also attacked.

This article stated that S3AvISTA blamed the
attack on the followers of deposed President CARLOS PRIO
SOCARRAS,. who was ousted by BaTISTa in a bloodless coup d!tetat
on March 10, 1952. In the same article it was Dace that
PRIO denied this accusation and said thet when and if £
should ever direct a revolution against the 3 ST. government ,
‘the will be leading it in front and would sot be at home in
Miami".

Miami Informant T-1, of known reliability, who is
well informed.concerning UsskLOS PiIO, and some o
ates, learned on July 2 1953, that when CARLOS £
received news of the above described uprising he i
that it cane as a complete surprise to him. He
sity as to the identity of the parties or group behind
this disturbance. Subsequently on July 26, 27, and 28,
Miami Informant T-1 and Miami Informants qe 2 and T-3, also
of known reliability, who are well informed concer. i
and some of his close associates in
RlCar RDO ARTIGAS, aer Chief of the Cuban Lovtery under PRIO,
d his wife, 50L ALS-«, and SEGUNDO JURTI, former
x nister of Interior under PRI0, also were s prised over the
uprising end made vigorous efforts to ascertain who was
behind the uprising.

i, rep

Miami Informant T+l reported on July 26 that C.AL0S
PRIO felt the whole affair of the uprising was Novagy''. He
gave a statement to the press on the same date to the effect
that BaTISTa is protecting the Comuunists internally although

MM 2-165

blaming them externally for the uprising. PRIO described
FIDEL CuSTRO, leader of the es Down et

f nism, and said that many of those who were killed
by BATISTAts men came from distinguished Cuban families,

PRIO also took this opportunity, according to the
informant, to point out that when he, PRIO, became President
of Cuba he closed down the Communist newspaper "Hoy", but
that it was re-opened by BaTISTA, and he claimed the number
of Communists in Cuba has increased from 20,000 to-150,000
during BATISTA's present. regime. He claimed BaTISTA is facing
a bad economic depression, and that if he, PRI0, were back
in Cuba, he would immediately arrange for free elections so
that the people could _vlect a constitutional President.

An article entitled "Dictator Batista Slaps
Martial Law Over Cuba", which appeared in the July 28) 1953
issue of the Miami Herald by the Assgociated Fress with a
Havana dateline, reported that BATISTA slapped martial law
over Cuba July 26, 1953, after crushing an attack by some
230 armed rebels on two Army posts.

Miaini radio broadcasts disdosed on the evening of
July 29, 1953 that Cuban planes had strafed two boats, the
"Benson* and the "Babe" of Liberian and Honduran registry
respectively, although American operated, which resulted
in the wounding of two British subjects and one Honduran.
Miami informant T-1 reported on the evening of July 29,
that PRIO received news of this incident with disbelief,
After the news was confirmed, PAIO remarked thet the incident
should certainly be of interest to American authorities,
RICaRDO ARTIG:S, according to T-2, expressed the opinion
that the "BATIST. people must be crazy".

On July 27, 1953, Miami Informant T-4 of known
reliability advised that LUIS GUSTAVO FERN DEZ, personal
Secretary to C.uRLCS PRIO disclosed that the Cuban uprising
was not caused by "our people’, but that it arose because
of student action.

Miami Informant T-5, of known reliability, reported
on July 29, 1953, that information emanating from the Cuban
Military Intelligence Service reflects that the uprising ‘was

MM 2-165

caused by members of the Orthodox Party of which FIDEL CASTRO,
the revolt leader, is a member, with the assistance of the :
Communist Party, and that the uprising was not sanctioned

by. PRIO and members of his autentico Parti. This informant
said that PRIO had planned action with the assistance of the
Orthodox Party, this action to take place following the
election of JOSE FIGURES, Presidential Candidate in Costa
Rica, who’ had promised PRIO aid and assistance in the event
he were elected. Inforuant pointed out that FIGURES, according
to the newspapers, was elected President of Costa Rica on
July 28, 1953. tet i

Miami I,formants T-1, 2, and 3 learned that a
number of Autentico Parti members such as 4XTCNIO VARONO,
LOMBERTO DIAZ, and DIEGO.EJIaS have been released by Cuban
authorities following their arrest. These same “informants
advised that no information came tc their attentiorl showing move-
ment of PRIO followers from Miami to Cuba prior to this
uprising, and that they had received no other evidence
indicating that PRIO was in any way responsible for the
uprising.

Miami Informant T-1 learned on July 30 that CaRLOS
PRIO reported to GUILLERMO .LONSO PUJOL, who s Vice-
President of Cuba during the Presidency of PRI0, that most
of the participants in this uprising were students led by
PIDEL CASTRO, and that most of these were members of the
Orthodox Party, and that most of *our friends" were also
arrested. Among these he named were ROBERT J
EXILIO OCHGA Y OCHOA, both u 2
and that a complaint had been filed by the Cuban Government
against PRIO. PRIO also related the machine-gunning of
two people by the Cuban Government. When ask by PudJOL
if PRIO were still optimistic after all this, PRIO replied
in the affirmative, stating the Cuban people could just not
wait. “He also disclosed that all this that has occurred in
Cuba had not hurt his cause one bit.

T-2 reported on July 30, 1953, that one of PRIO's
followers, Comaandant ZORILLiS, who has recently arrived in
Miami, disclosed he had just hed an interview with LUIS
ORTEG:. of theCuban newspaper "#1 Pueblo", who had been beaten

and whose newspaper had been destroyed following the uprising
of July 26. According to this information furnished by
ORTEGA, prisoners were being taken throughout Havana, and
trucks had been loaded with cadavers and driven to Santiago
where the bodies were thrown so as to indicate they had been
killed in Santiago. ORTEGA described the situation as being
critical and expected a "blow up". ZORILL:S it was learned
considered ORTHGA a very strange individual, but did not
.question his reliability. He said there were 400 dead now

in Cuba as a result of this uprising.

The Miami Herald on August 2, 1953, carried an
article entitled "Prio Classes Batista with Red Chiefs"
wherein it was stated CANLOS PRIO charged that the strafing
of two banana boats by Cuban war planes put Batista on the

“same level with Russia's masters.

This article, in part, quoted PRIO as follows:

"'That brutal and inhuman action ordered by the dictator
of Cuba is typical of the disregard which dictators

feel toward internat’ onal rights and the unwritten laws
which guide the actions of democratic governments ‘and
free peoples.

"'Thataction, which is along the same line as the
shooting down’of unarmed american and British transports
by Soviet planes, shows the unity of procedures used

by. dictatorships - whether it bethe system ruling Cuba,
or the system which pretends to impose itself on the
civilized world from Moscow.!

" The american people, he said, received a 'rude reminder
of the dictators! disregard of human principles and
common decency' this week when an american B-50 bomber
was shot down over the Sea of Japan by Russian fighters.

"Prio charged further that reports 'filtering' out-of
Cuba indicate that Batista has unleashed ‘a wave of
terror.!"

MM 2-165

Miami Informant T-25, of known reliability,
and who is personally acquainted with some leading members
of the PRIO group,’ learned on August. 3, 1953, that C.RLOS
PRIO in discussing this uprising stated, "The case of
MONCADA aRMORY, was a tremendously stupid action on the
t of a boy mentally unbalanced... He never received any
aid from me or anyone taking a part in the central directive
movement. had nothing, absolutely nothing, to do with
thet uprising. Theplans of FIDEL C.STRO were crazy.
What did he accomplish by taking of MONCADA's armory when
in one hour's time he would have over his head ali of
BaTISTA's air force? Further, FIDEL CASTRO was so stupid
as to have some messages already printed and signed by
him as 'President in arms' of the Republic of Cuba. ‘There
is no sense in all tnis unfortunate episode at Santiago
de Cuba, but to give opportunity to BaTISTA to make a
forced demonstration and fanfare. At the same time only
a mentally unbalanced individual could lead 150:young men
into a sure massacre. fFIDEL never had over 25 or 40 rifles.
The rest of his followers went into the fight armed only
with machetes and knives although they were promised rifles
before reaching the Moncada armory. These rifles never.
reached their hands. No one in our organized revolutionary
movement against BaTISTA had anything to do with FIDEL."

II, INCIDENTS INVOLVING CUBANS IN MIAN

As Leaflets Distributed By Cuban Liberty Action:

The May 20, 1953, issue of the Miami Herald
carried an article entitled "Anti-Batista Plans Carried
to Cubans Here", This article disclosed that leaflets
signed by the Cuban Liberty action (Miami Br: h) were
distributed) in Miami denouncing Cuban President BATISTA
on the occasion of a ceremony scheduled in Mizini to honor
Cuban Patriot JOSE MuRTI.* Two Cuban officials, Dr. RaFAEL
L. DIAZ ~ BALART, Cuban Under-Secretary of Interior, and
Dr. HTPOLITO VaLELLA, head of theCuban Tourist Bureau,
came to Miami to present a bust of MARTI to the University
of Miami. The leaflets above described claim that these
men did not represent the Cuban people, but that: “in
reality, they represent t anti-Democratic government
of Dictator FULGENCIO BuTIST.." He was denounced as a
"pro-Communist and anti-Democratic dictator, a thief of
the public treasury like PERON in argentina, MiLENKOF in
Russia, TRUJILLO in Dominean Republié.” ‘The leaflets
concluded, "Our brothers died in Korea for the liberty of
the world. Do not’ become an accomplice of the friends
of these assassins. Join our consignee: freedom for the
Cuban people." This article disclosed that VIDAL ORALES
of Miami, described as a leader in the distribution of
these leaflets, said they were put out by the Miami Branch
of the'Cuban Liberty Action, a group recently organized
in Cuba to oppose BATISTA. The leaflets were printed in
both Spanish and English. :

a)

On May 21, 1953, T-5 reported that VIDAL sORALZS
served in the United St:tes Army during World War II

and had been living in Miami on 39th Avenud between First
and Second Streets, N. W., with ORLANDO GARCIA, who was
arrested about eight months ago by the Miami Police Department.
in connection with a murder charge in Cuba, but who ws
subsequently released. T-5 said that he learned that

sLVAREZ RUEDA, 228 N. We. 26th avenue, Miami, was associated
with MORALES in the distribution of these leaflets. He

. describes RUEDA as having served as a Lieutenant in the

Radio Technical Department of the Cuban Police Department
under President GRiU, and said he has lived in Miami about

7 36

| NW 64954 Docld:34517419 Page 13



MM 2-165

six years. He also reported that RUEDA received a jail
sentence for dealing in contraband during the PRIO regime.
He said RUEDs has no obvious source of income and yet
reportedly possessed money.

Miami Informant T-6, of known reliability,
reported on May 21, 1953, that VIDAL HORsLES is a member
of the Union Insurrectional Revolutionary of Cuba, this
being a revolutionary group of gangsters which was
abolished by BATISTA.

Both T-5 and T-6 expressed the opinion. that the
Cuban Liberty Action was planned by VIDAL MORALES, ALVAREZ
RUEDA and perhaps others for this specific purpose, and
that it was not actually an organization as such. Neither
T-5 nor T-6 had ever heard of this organization before.

On June 3, 1953, Mr. ANTONIO PRIO, who called at
the Miami Office relative to another matter, wes shown

one of the above described leaflets. ANTONIO PRIO,who is
the brother of CARLOS PRIO stated he did not know VIDAL
MORALES, and that -iOR.LES had no connection whatsoever
with CaRLOS PRIO or members of his. party, and that. the
incident was undoubtedly inspired by Cuban students in
Miami who are opposed to B.TISTA. ANTONIO PRIO said he
possessed no knowledge of the existence of any organization
known as the Cuban Liberty Action.

B. Assault of Cuban army Officer in Miami, July 6, 1953:

On July 13, 1953, Miami Informant T=5 reported
that on duly 6, 1953, LEON DE DIOT, a Major inthe Cuban
army, who was then in Miami en route to Jacksonville, Florida,
to engage in a competitive pistol match along with other
meinbers of his team, was assaulted at Walgreen's Drug Store,
Flagler Street and Southeast Second ivenue, by CESAR VEGA
whom the informant described as being a Cuban ruffian who
is associated with the PRIO group in Miami. T-5 said that.
VEG was waring brass knucks when he struck Major DIOT.

The informant said that CESAR VEG. is closely
associated with RUBEN aCOSTa, a Cuban attorney, VID:AL
MORALES, above described, and one BLaNCO, all of whom he
said are mmbers of the PRIO group.

MM 2-165

The informant said he. had also learned that VaGa,
aCOSTA, and other’ Cubans also went, to the room of another
Cuban at the hotel. Belforte, and started to assault this
Cuban but were forced to leave hurriglly when help approached.

Miami Informant T-1 learned on July 6, 1953, that
C.RLOS PRIO arranged to contact one of the Cuban Military
Officers in the same group going to Jacksonville, concerning
the above described incident. PRiO advised that he was
not behind the incident and had nothing against the Cuban
amy.

C. Cuban Day Celebration, July 11, 1953:

The July 12, 1953, issue of the Miami Daily News
carried an article entitled "Cuban Consul Trades Punches
With Heckler". This article reflected that EDU.RDO HERN.NDEZ,
Cuban Consul at Miami and an unidentified heckler engaged
ina brief fist fight following Cuban Day celebrations
which were held in Bayfront Park, Miami, on July 11, 1953,
in honor of JOSE M.RTI, Cuban Patriot. This article
disclosed the proceedings were interrupted by a heckler
who shouted, "Viva Cuba - without Batista. Down with the
dictatorship."

Miami Informant T-6 reported on July 15, 1953,
that the fisticuffs between Consul HERNaNDEZ and his
assailant took place in the Minerva Restaurant located
about two blocks from Bayfront Park, following the
ceremonies in the park. T-6 said that HERNANDEZ! assailant,
identified as CESAR V struck HERNANDEZ after HERNANDEZ
pointed out to VEGA tha although they had personal
differences about politics, they should attempt to observe
civil law in Miami. T-6 said that actually forty to fifty
punches were exchanged by VEGa and HERNANDEZ.

T-6 expressed the opinion that he felt that this
incident along with others mentioned above were part of an
"organized deal" to enbarrass the B.TISTA Government.

On.duly 28, T-6 reported that an unidentified

man speaking Spanish telephonically contacted an employee
of the Cuban Consulate in Miami, and stated he was going

to wrack the Consulate and attack the Consul. T-6 also
learned that two or three Cubans had been asking questions
of consulate employees the preceding day - while they were
waiting for an elevator on the grourid floor of the ;
Consulate building. At the same time, according to T-6,

the Cuban Consul received a report’ to the effect that several
Cubans were overheard talking in the Paula Restaurant at
Miami. They made statements to the effect that they planned
to attack the Consulate, According to T-6, the Miami

Police Department had placed police: guards around the
consulate.

The July 28, 1953, issue of the Miami Daily News
carriadl an article entitled, "Tension High Here 0 Cuban
Revolt" by HILT SOSIN, Miami Daily News Staff Writer. This
article reflected that tension mounted in Miami's Cuban
colony as some Havana newspapers arrived in Miami showing
the evidence of considerable suppression and
ship as an aftermath of an uprising against B..
This article disclosed that the United States Department of
State had informed the Miami Policé Department about threats
received by the Cuban Consul, and that as a result a 24
hour police guard was placed on the Consulate which is
located on the fourth floor of the Pan American
Building.

E, Attempt to Picket the Cuban Consulate:

. Detective Lieutenant C. W. PRICE, Miami Police
Department, reported-on July 28, 1953, that on the preceding
day a group of three men came to the police department
and asked for a perait to picket the Cuban Consulate. When
asked the purpose of the picketing they replied this was
their only method of protesting the present system of
Government in Cuba, and to let the american people know
their views, and that all Cubans do not approve. at that
time they were told no permit was required so long as no
disorder resulted in which case police action would be

immediately taken. These men pledged that nothing but
peaceful action was planned. | oH

Mr. PRICE said that later, however, the United
States Department of State, according to a newspaper article,
contacted Chief of Police WaLTER E. HEADLEY at his home,
end Chief Hi..DLEY ordered that no picketing would be
permitted in view of the reported threats alleged to have
been reccived by the Cuban Consul.

Detective. Lieutenant PRICE said that on the
morning of July 28, the same group of three men, accompanied
by a woman, came into the police department again, stating
they had read the article in the Miami Herald, and desired
further informition. They appeared cooperative, and

issued prohibiting the picketing of the Cuban Consul as
not being in the best interests of the United States, and
that a violation of this order would result in arrests
boing.made. Lt. PRICE said that these people did not appear
to be offended or chagrined at the decision, and readily
agreed to abide by it. Also, they exhibited no intention
to take Court action to determine their entitlement to
picket.

One of the picketers, GILBERTO DELG.DO, left
a sample of the handbill which they had planned to distribute
to the public while picketing. This handbill, which is being
retained in the files ofthe Miami Office, reads as follows:

"TO THE aMERICAN PEOPLE: Cuba, under RBatista's
dictatorship, is'now living the terror of its full
impact. The Dictator is interested only in repressing
the efforts the Cuban people are making to restore

our Constitution and our rights; and as a regime of force,
their methods of necessity include the lash, the
machine gun, the black jack, torture and beatings.

This bloody rule,is disguised asa! evolent

yesterday's 52, as the result of the fight against

thet ELISEO RIERA GOMEZ, who was alleged to serve as a
public relations man for CuRLOS PRIO, advised ANTONIO PRIO
on that date concerning plans to picket the Cuban Consul.
It appeared to T-3 that RIHRA was making some of the
arrangements. R8IfRa planned to have six picketers carrying
signs condemning the Batista Government as being a pro-
Comnaunist dictatorship, to distribute literature and to
carry Cuban and American flags. The informant learned

that RISRA was also in touch with SEGUNDO CURTI concerning
this matter. Miami Informant T-7 learned on July 28, 1953,
thet when RIERA informed .NTONIO PRIO that it appeared that
the police might stop the picketers, but that photographers
were present at the fan American Bank Building where the
Consulate.is located, aNTONIO PRIO pointed out that the
publicity which might be obtained through the photographers
was the important thing. This informant also learned on

with a Cuban flag to use if they succeeded in getting
permission to picket the Consulate.

On May 12, 1953, Miami Informants T-10 and T-11
reported that they had a discussion with ELISEO RIERA, an
employee of the Miami-Daily News, who indicated to them that
he was working closely with the PRIO people, disclosed that
PRIO s goi to try to take back Cuba, and that it would
be a "bloody" affair. RIERA said that the PRIO group has as
many armed men in Cuba as have the BATISTA people.

On May 12, 1953, T-5 reported having received infor-
mation emanating from the Cuban Intelligence Service
PRIO was planning an uprising against BATISTA on or
May 19 or 20, 1953.

Miami Informant T-12, of known reliability,
a Federal Agency engaged in inves
May 22, 1953, that CARLOS PRIO, - AUF
former Minister of Education and State under PRIO,
FERNANDEZ; orthodox delegates who are folldéwers of
OCHOA, delegates of the Federacion and %studiantal versitaria,
and others met in Mexico early in Abril, 1953, to discuss
SANCHEZ ANANGO's plans for an armed attack against the forces
of BATISTA in Cuba. It was stated that the failure of th
plan to bribe certain high officials in the BATISTA Go
left no alternative but force. It was stated that la
quantities of arms were reportedly already available in Cuba
for attacks planned on Campo Columbia, the Cubana Fortress,
police stations and naval stations in Havana. The time for
this attack was not set according to information received by
T-12, but it was agreed by those oersons that it would ve wise
to wait until such time as thé economic situation of the country
should become more critical or until some unexpected event
should occur which would permit an auspicious opportunity for
implementation of the plan. (u)

ami Informant T-13, of known reliability, being
employed by T-12, reported having just received
information from a source considered liable that an alert
had been issued to opposition groups Havana to be prepared
for immediate action and the source was of the opinion that
it was entirely possible that some revolutionary movement
would be started in the early morning hours of May 28, 1953,
and if not then, within the next few days. (u)

Miami Informant T-14, of knownreliability, and
who is acquainted with many. Cubans in Miami, reported on June
9, 1953, that he had received information from a friend who
i the home of FRANCISCO PRIO, who had disclosed that
the PRIO group has everything they need by way of equipment
and are now ready to start operations, The exact time was
not disclosed.

Miami Informant T-15 reported on Maye 29, 19
former Senator PELAYO CUERVO NAVARRO, apparently a sym
with the ENILIO OCHOA faction of the Orthodox Party, which
seemed to be implicated in revolt plans. with PRIO's Authentic
Party, appeared on a “Meet the Press".program televi
Cuban Station CMC on May 26, 1953. During a questi
answer session, PaLAYO implied or stated six times tb he
believed violence would be justified in the event a peaceful
solution could not be found for Cuba”s political problems.

He insisted that there is an “attitude of rebellion" among the
people and he said "As soon as there is a propitious situation,
Iam sure that the Cuban people will fulfil their duty has
always happened." Another theme to which he returned several
times was that the army was sensitive to the will of the people
and knowing that the "moment is drawing near when voice

of the people is going to rule." T-15 said that PELAYO was
arrested by the Cuban Intelligence Service as he‘left the
broadcasting station but was later released although it was
reported that criminal charges would be brought against him for
defamation, i

Miami Informant T-16, who is believed;to be reliable,
but who represents the BATISTA Government, reported on June 10,
1953, that a meeting of the Orthodox Party of Cuba held
at the Whitehall Hotel, New Y: y, on the even
1953. Among those present as speakers were MARIN
JESU DE GALINDO, JUAN DIAZ, a Dominic: EMILIO OCHOA
A. Also present was JOSE Al
a member of the Authentic Party. Informant said that
theme of all of the talks made by these speakers was that a
demand would be made of. RATISTA for a free election in Cuba.
If this demand were not met the Government of BATISTA would
be overthrown by force. OCHOA stated that a final. decision
was made at Montreal and that the two biggest parties in Cuba,

being the Orthodox Party and the Authentic Party, had decided
to overthrow Ista. The informant.said that all the speakers
urged those in attendance to be ready to shed their blood for
Cuba, This statement brought enthusiastic applause from the
audience. Among those present was JOSE DUARTE, who sat at

the speakers' table and was introduced as a Cuban hero.
Informant said that he was convinced that within the t month
or six weeks, an attempt would be made by the supporters of
CARLOS PRIO to overthrow the BATISTA Regime in Cuba by force.

Miami Informant T-1 reported on June 15, 1953, that
GUILL@RMO ALONSO PUJOL, former Vice President under PHIO, told
PRIO that SERGIO CARBO, publisher. of Prensa Libra Ha
with whom PUJOL had apparently had a serious discussion, wa
on the side of PRIO, but that CARBO felt horror at the thought
of what might happen as a result of the warlike situation which
Cuba was facir

Miami Informant T-5 reported on July 13, 1953, that
RUBEN GARCIA CHELIN, a close relative and associate of CARLOS
PRIO, who is residing in Miami, had warned an acquaintance
against going to Cuba at that time, insinuating that a revolution
might occur in the very near future.

The July 27, 1953 issue of the
an article entitled "PRIO Benies any Tie
wherein PRIO was questioned as to whether he had
to do with the uprising of July 24, 1953. On that oc
PRIO was quoted as stating, "I know nothing about this r olt,
but if it fails, there will be others. There will be revolts
as long as BATISTA continues to hold the vower in Cuba which
the people did not give to him.

"I have said before the people of Cuba will never
tolerate a dictatorship. For that reason wa may see at any
time an uprising of the people and the army itself against
BATISTA.

“T don't know anything about the revolt today, but
any time I.am directing such a movement, I will be 2m the
scene leading that movement."

, On July 31, 1953, Miami Informant T-17, of know
reliability, stated that it is being reported around Miami
that the wife of FULGENCIO BATISTA, head of the Cuban Govern-
ment, has just gone to England with a large amount of money.
T-17 said that he interpreted this report, if true, as meaning
that BATISTA may be making arrangements for flight from Cuba.

Miami Informant T-1 learned on August 3, 1953,
that PRIO, wnen called upon to evaluate a plan of action
which was not. fully described to the informant, stated that the
plan was absolutely impossible, that everything whi
to Cuba at the present time is impossible, that wh
planned is impossible because of circumstances whi

pointed out th two American controllal boats were fired upon,
that everybody is stopped, houses searched, t all leade’
the party are prisoners, that airplanes and coast guardsmen
are patrolling the island, and that the situation is in-a
state of panic.

out of the presidential palace, No, BATISTA is directly

The informant got the impression that perhaps
PRIO intended that his plans should take a Cuban
holiday within the near future so t the Cuban

people could enjoy a double celebration. He pointed out

VI. EFFORTS TO UNIFY THE AUTHENTIC AND ORTHODOX
“PARTIES FOR JOINT ACTION AGAINST BATISTA

A. Montreal Conference

The June 2, 1953 issue of the Gazette, Montreal,
Canada, carried an article entitled, "Exiled Cuban Leaders
Map Joint Fight Against BATISTA," which reflected that
exiled Cubans, leaders in the fieldsof politics, labor, youth,
and professions, met June 1, 1953 at Montreal in an attempt
to arrive at a common policy in their fight against President
FULGENCIO -BATISTA.

This article disclosed that the two big parties
represented were the Cuban Revolutionary Party (Authentic)
and the Cuban Peoples Party (Orthodox). CARLOS HEVIA, who had
been scheduled to run as Presidential candidate on the Authentic
Party ticket in the June, 1952 elections until the coup d'etat
of BATISTA on March 10, 1952 upset his plans, was reported as
stating that the meetings in Montreal were to.consolidate
the opposition immediately and to bring about the return of
constitutional government in Cuba.

CARLOS PRIO SOCARRAS, EMILIO OCHOA y OCHOA,
President of the Orthodox Party;: and MANUEL A. de VARONA’ y LAREDO,
President of the Authentic Party, issued the following statement
at this conference: ’

"The conference that we have been holding in
Montreal with high representatives of both parties
looks forward to the establishment of a national unity
in an endeavor to do away with the dictatorship in
Cuba through the re-establishment of the Ae aes
institutions of Cuba.

"The Authentic and Orthodox parties hope

to arrive, as a result of these meetings, at an under- |
standing, and they are sure this will be the basis of |

“of a patriotic agreement of the opposition, which:
does not mean an electoral cealition in the future,
because the ends that. move them now are of a national
character,.for the defence of the constitution and
laws which have been violated,

"We will endeavor to avoid for our country
a fratricidal war to which Cuba is being 1éd by the
usurper regime,"

This article distlosed that this joint meeting
was attended by the following members of the Orthodox Party:

‘Dr. EMILIO OCHOA y OCHOA
_ Dr, JOSE M, GUTIERREZ
JOSE PARDO LLADA
YSIDERO FIGUEROA
Dr, RAUL de JUAN, professional representative
JANIER LEZCANO, labor representative

For the Authentic Party -

Dr. SOCARRAS

Dr. GUILLERMO ALANSQ PUJAL

Dr. MANUEL A. de VERONA LAREDO

Dr. EDUARDO PROVOS,

Dr. JUAN A, RUBIO PADILLO

CARLOS HEVIA, all party representatives;

ANTONIO SANTIAGO, youth representative

Dr. ARACELIO AZCUAY, professional representative

Dr. LOUIS GUSTAVO FERNANDEZ, personal secretary to
SOCARRAS

Col, RAFAEL YSQUIERDO, personal assistant to
SOCARRAS.

Miami Informant T-21, of known reliability, who
is employed by a Federal Agency, reported that a 500-word
declaration, in Spanish, was issued to the press by leaders
of the above-mentioned parties and that this declaration was
summarized as follows by the La Presse:

"_.---the Cuban- people have repudiated the regime
of the usurpers, demanding a return to constitutional
and democratic order by a government. capable of holding

ed
"free general dections,

o---- The Cuban crisis cannot be resolved otherwise
than by restoration of the Constitution of 1940,
which spoke the free will of the people.

Nonna the Party of the Cuban eople (orthodox)
and the Cuban Revolutionary Party (authentic) have
deeided to bring into being a constructive force of
patriotic unity.

"The two parties judge it indispensable to form a
provisional government which will re-establish the
electoral law of 1943. The signstory parties reject
as electoral weapons, attacks on persons, gangsterism
and terrorist maneuvers, They promise Cuba for the
day of her resurrection, an era of peace.and legality,"

é T-25 learned on August 3, 1953 that CARLOS PRIO
in describing the Montreal Conference stated, "What we agreed
in Montreal was in reference to a taster plant to liouidate
BATISTA's regime, We did not agree to any political alliance,
as each party will maintain his automony and freedom of action
in the political field as soon as we dispose of BATISTA'ts
machinery in Cuba. A provisional government will be installed
in the Government at the time with me at its head for the
balange of the time BATISTA took away from me and presidential
elections will be held immediately afterwards with full
guarantees to all. We just want to continue the national march
of democracy which has been interrupted by BATISTA's gangsterism.”

Intelligence Service to the effect. that persons representing
CARLOS PRIO weie believed to have purchased. 400 rubber boats
from a Miami veterans! surplus store located on Biscayne
Boulevard in Miami at 12th Street Northeast; that these boats
were in boxes in storage with the Withers Storage Company
and were to be delivered, or may already have been delivered,
to an address in Mexico. T-5 said that the Cuban Military
Intelligence Service received this information froma person
in the Cuban Navy who in turn received it from a Cuban who
is employed by the surplus store in Miami.

On May 21, Mr. A, KRAVITZ and W. A. WEINTRAUB,
owners of Surplus Outlet, Inc., wholesalers and retailers
operating the Veterans Surplus Outlet Store, 1215 Biscayne
Boulevard, Miami, advised that they have sold only two
rubber boats within recent months and that in all probability

it would be impossible to purchase 400 rubber boats in all

of south Florida inasmuch as there is but small demand for
boats or rafts of this type and that customarily retailers
and wholesalers do not stock up on this item.

Their store manager, AURILO MUZARIETA, who said
that he is an American citizen born in Cuba, reported that
several weeks previous DIEGO VICENTE TEJERA, whom he described
as being former Minister of Education under the PRIO regime
and who claimed to own a boat or yacht, came into the Veteran
Surplus Store and purchased two automatically. inflated rubber
rafts at $95. each. A sample of one of these rafts was pointed
out and it is observed that it is of the type formerly used
by the U. S. Navy Airforce for emergency landings and is
automatically inflated by means of an oxygen cartridge. It
appeared to be capable of carrying ten or twelve men. Mr,-
KRAVITS and Mr, WEINTRAUB said that the few sales they make
of this item are usually to yacht owners or operaters of
public and private swimming pools.

It was also stated, according to T-26, that PRIO
has employed a former United States Army colonel named
SKOLOSKI, whose job is to recruit war veterans to form an
army to invade Cuba; that SKOLOSKI has disappeared from
Miami and is believed in Mexico; that he is offering recruits {
$25. a day and expenses and an insurance policy. It was stated :
that it was not known how many veterans he has recruited,
but that a great many veterans had been recently inquiring !
in Miami for SKOLOSKI.

T-26 said that the Cuban Foreign Minister also
advised that two boats 158 feet long called the CRISTOBAL
CARRIER and the ANCON TRADER had been acquired from the
Panama Cabotage Agency; this purchase having been made by
SEGUNDO CURTI, who was PRIO's Minister of the Interior.
These -boats were described as former Naval vessels, aluminum
with black bottom.

According to T-26, it was also stated that inter-
views between PRIO and his people concerning these matters .
are held in the Hotel Royal York, 5875 Collins Avenue, Miami
Beach.

On June 2, 1953, Mr, E. T. LUCAS, room clerk,
Hotel Royal York, reported that there are no Cubans
registered at that hotel and that no meetings of Cubans
have been held there to the best of his knowledge.

Miami Informant T~27, of known reliability,
reported on June 2, 1953, that as of June 2 CARLOS PRIO
SOCARROS had a balance of only $37.03 in his account and
that he or one of his representatives last entered the |
safety deposit box of that bank on March 15, 1953. T-27
possessed no knowledge of $19,000. having been withdrawn
from the North Shore Bank. by PRIO.

Miami Informant T-5 reported on June 2,.1953, that
he had received no information indicating that Colonel |
SKOLUSAThas been recruiting in Miami or elsewhere on behalf
of the PRIO group. Records of the Miami Veterans Administra-
tion, Credit Bureau and Police Department contain no reference
to a person who can be identified as Colonel SKOLOSKI.

On May 21, 1953 Mr.- WAYNE WITHERS of the Withers
Storage and Transportation Company, advised that his concern-
possessed no record whatsoever of having either stored or
transported any rubber boats or boxes believed to contain
rubber boats during the past year or so. Examination of
the records in his office failed to'disclose the storage
or shipment of any items which appeared to correspond with
the above during the past two months.

Miami Informant T-5 reported on the same date
that DIEGO VICENTE TEJERA is a very close associate of CARLOS
PRIO and his brothers and is also a close friend of JOSE
LUGO on whose farm.in Cuba the Cuban police found a quantity
of arms and ammunition. Informant said that LUGO is consider-
ed a dangerous ganster type of individual. He said that for
a while DIEGO VICENTE TEJERA was with LUGO at the Colonial
Hotel in Miami. He also stated that DIEGO VICENTE TEJERA
had flown to Bimini on a Chalk Airline when the "Bonito"
encountered engine trouble there preparatory to making plans
to depart for Mexico. It is to be recalled that AURELINO
‘SANCHEZ ARANGO, former Minister of Education and State under
PRIO, along with others, was on the "Bonito" and was traveling
under an assumed name when this boat landed at the port of
New Orleans during the early part of. 1953 after having been
towed there by another vessel. T-5 said that DIEGO drives
a Cadillac automobile bearing Cuban license 168519.

Miami Informant T-26, of known reliability, being
an employee of a Federal agency which has offices in Havana,
submitted a report dated May 15, 1953 to the effect that
the Cuban Foreign Minister had advised that on May 9, four
rubber boats, capacity 25 men each, were transferred to the
general cargo warehouse, Miami, these boats having been
acquired by DIEGO VICENTE TEJERA, former Cuban Senator, from
the Veteran Surplus Outlet, Inc., 1215 Biscayne Boulevard,
Miami; and that these boats were paid for by CARLOS PRIO
with the intention of sending them to another port, possibly
Veracruz or another Mexican port.

According to T-26, it was stated that this
operation cost $19,000., which was taken from the safety
deposit box of PRIO at the North Shore Bank, Miami Beach,
where PRIO allegedly keeps a large amount of cash.

On May 25, 1953 Miami Informant T-28, of known
reliability, who conducts investigations for a Federal
agency, reported that he had received similar information
as that attributed above to.T-26. T-28 said that pursuant
to his duties, he had made inquiry concerning the CRISTOBAL

7 CARRIER and the ANCON TRADER and had interviewed ROD PICKARD,
Miami Ships, 2051 N. W. llth Street, -who, along with THOMAS
J. MC CRORY, 615 S. W. 2nd Avenue, Miami, were ship brokers
handling the sale of these two vessels.

According to T-28, PICKARD reported that both of
these vessels were purchased from the Condenser Service
and Engineering Company, Inc., Seaboard Trust Building,
Hoboken, New Jersey and were paid for by G. PETTERSON of
the Estrella Fruit Shipping Corporation, 133 North Front
Street, New Orleans, Louisiana. The purchase price was
$18,000. for each vessel. They weré purchased for the
Panama Cabotage Agency, North Avenue 72, Panama. -PICKARD
maintained that the Panama Cabotage Agency is a carrier
organization working for the Estrella Fruit Company out of
Ecuador. He said that the principal of the Estrella
Company is FOLK ANDERSON, who is supposed to be a multi-
millionaire. The principals of the Panama Cabotage Agency
are VIGGO LARSEN, Director and President; PABLO OTHON
VALDELAMAR, 43rd Street and 39th, Panama, Director and
Treasurer, and F. S. TAPIA C., Secretary, Central Avenue
number 98, Panama.

T-28 said that the State Department license
number for the export of both vessels was nuniber 263 and
that the U. S. Maritime Administration transport number
was MA-938. He said that both orders were issued to
demilitarized vessels identified as LSI number 664 and
596, both vessels being renamed the CRISTOBAL CARRIER
and the ANCON TRADER respectively by the Panama Cabotage

_ Agency. Both of these ships were built for the U. S. Navy
at the Brooklyn Naval Yard. in 1934. .

T-28 said that ROD PICKARD expressed the opinion

that the purchase and intended. use of these vessels is
legitimate. He said that both were being outfitted as

fruit carriers. He-said that HARRY ARTHUR GREENFIELD was
the escrow agent in the transaction involving sale of these
vessels, PICKARD said that he was applying for a State

- Department export license, stating that the purpose for

which these vessels would be used was banana carriers in
Central and South American coastwide service by the
Agencia de. Cabotage, S. A., Republic, Panama. PICKARD
said that professional registration had been issued for
these vessels by the Panamanian Consul, Jacksonville, on
March 29, 1953.

Miami Informant T-29, of known reliability, who
is employed by the Federal agency which conducts investiga--
tion reported-on May 27, 1953 that the Panamanian Consul
in Jacksonville had advised that his records show that
both the CRISTOBAL and the ANCON TRADER were transferred
on February 3, 1953 from the Condenser Service and Engineer-
ing Company to the Agencia de-Cabotage and that T. J. MC CRORY
handled the sale. The Consul said that he had issued only
a temporary license.

T-29 also reported that he has received information
to the effect that THOMAS J. MC CRORY, mentioned above, has
been seen with SEGUNDO CURTI, former Minister of the Interior
under PRIO, who is closely associated in Miami with PRIO;

On June 5, 1953, Miami Informant T-30; of known
reliability, who is well acquainted with waterfront activities
in_the Miami area, reported that on that: same date a boat
belonging to_one TOM MC CRORY had cleared Miami for Cay

‘Sal, Bahama Islands, British West Indies. T-30 described

the boat as being a 63.foot trash boat of the type used
during World War II which is known as THE ARB, registered
in New Orleans, Louisiana, registration number 204653, the
owner being the Estrella Fruit and Shipping Company, 113
North Front Street, New Orleans.

T-30 said that in addition to MC CRORY, who acted
as captain, there were two other persons on the boat, one
of these was HENRY M. WATKINS, background information unknown
to the informant. The other was DIEGO T. RESCALVO, a Cuban

and an attorney by profession, -who resides at 1133 Sevilla
Avenue, Corai Gables.

T-30 said that MC CRORY claimed that he end his
two crew .wembers were going on a fishing trip to Way Sal,
this being a v small and uninhabited island and secluded.
T-30 noticed that; although the trip was ostensibly for fish-
ing surposes, that the three men carried only a very small
amount of food and only enough for one or two meals. The
informant also observed that DIEGO T. RESCALVO- had a pistol
strapped to his side and the informant felt that these three
men were not actually going on a fishing trip at all.

: On June 11 this same informant advised, relative
to the above mentioned ARB, that the three men left Miami
about 5:30 or 6:00 p.m. on June 5, and that MC CRORY seemed
in a particular big hurry to obtain clearance and leave
Miami. The informant also was of the opinion that that
was not the customary time of day that fishermen leave Miami
on such a trip. Informant said that MC CRORY resides at :
3950 N. W. 3rd Street, Miami: The Miami telephone directory
reflects that T. J. MC CRORY, ship broker, resides at 3950
N. W. 3rd Street and has offices at 615 S. W. 2nd Avenue.

On June 5, 1953, Miami Informant T-31, of known
reliability, who is well informed concerning waterfront
activities in the Miami area, advised that MC CRORY-had
consulted him as to whether it would be necessary to
obtain official clearance from Miami in order to go fishing
at Cay Sal, Bahama Islands. T-31 described MC CRORY as
being a. ship broker whose reputation for honesty and fair
dealings is not too good. T-31 said that he had heard
rumors that MC CRORY might be involved in smuggling and he
pointed out that Cay Sal would be an ideal place for that
type of operation as it is only forty miles north of Cuba
and would be a good place to rendezvous with boats or
persons who may be involved in any illegal operation. On
dune 12, this informant reported that following MC CRORY's
return from Cay Sal he had attempted to question him
discreetly concerning the purpose of his trip there but

- 46 =

that MC CRORY was very cagey and would furnish no information
as to what he’ had been doing, except that he had gone
crawfishing.

Miami Informant T-32, who is. believed to be
reliable and who is personally acquainted with THOMAS J.
MC CRORY, reported on June 11, 1953, that MC CRORY had
recently disclosed to him that he owns or has control of
a boat and that he is working for the "PRIO people" in
Miami relative to a revolt which PRIO is planning against
BATISTA. T-32 said that MC CRORY also mentioned having
a fast cruiser which was being outfitted by a boat yard
in the Miami River and that he had, two other ships which
were being worked on. He implied that these boats were
to be used in connection with his plans with the PRIO
people. He also claimed to have one flying boat which is
propelled by two airplane engines with propellers in the
rear. T-32 said that MC CRORY "shoots off at the mouth"
and likes to create the impression that he is an adventurer
who is steeped in intrigued. T-32 said that MC CRORY has
bragged that he himself would take. part in the invasion
of Cuba along with the PRIO forces and that on one occasion
he invited the informant to go along with him. MC CRORY
also claimed that he has been transporting guns to a point
near Key West.

The informant said that MC CRORY frequently
associates with a Captain ERICKSON (later identified as
Captain BURT T. ERICKSON) a boat skipper and’ that during
the previous year MC CRORY and ERICKSON, sailing a ship
under Nova Scotian registry, transported some material
from the Bahama Islands.into Cuba but that something
went wrong and they got into trouble with the Cuban
authorities. T-32 believed that ERICKSON was probably
involved with MC CRORY in the event MC CRORY was actually
working for the PRIO group.

On June 14, 1953, T-32 reported that he had

again seen MC CRORY who stated that. something was going to
"pop" almost any day now and MC CRORY again invited the

Cuba by the PRIO people took place. The informant said
that Captain ERICKSON, driving an automobile bearing
Florida license 1-98270, was seen by him with MC CRORY:

that day. Records of the Dade County Automobile License
Bureau reflect that this license is issued to BURT T.
ERICKSON, 3614 N. W. 12th Street for a 1948 Chevrolet

sedan. Informant said that MC CRORY indicated he was
leaving that evening for a trip of approximately three

or four days duration. He did not disclose his destination.

Miami Informant T-33, of known reliability
who is a representative of a federal agency which
conducts investigations, reported on June 17, 1953
that it had come to the attention of his agency that

NING STAR was owned by JACK BRC a native of

Packard motors. T-33 possessed no evidence that the
presence of either TH MORNING STAR or the N&LSON IT

at Cay. Sal had anything to do with the ARB.

iaformation received by T-34 to the effect that cars from
Miami were coming to this boat and that a crew man mounted
guard on deck with a rifle. T-34 said that following an
all-night surveillance at Davie boat dock s at Marathon,
during which time no activity was observed aboard the N.

on July 3, 1953 records of the Marine Desk, Immigration &
Naturalization Service, Miami, which reflected that the ANB
arvived in Miami June 9, 1953 from Cay Sal, British Yest Indies.
Those listed on board were THOMAS MC ORORY, listed as Master,

vessel from Miami June 5, 1953. He was described as a Cuban
citizen. His status, according to the manifest record at
the Marine Desk was changed from.Seaman to that of temporary
visitor, this being based upon the fact that he possessed a
temporary visitor's visa which allowed him to remain in the

Shipbuilding Corporation was the type of repairing and
overhauling which was ordinarily done on vessels of that type
which had been out of commission for a long tims. He said
that both the boats were properly equipped to engage in the
transportation of bananas but that neither was refrigerated
inasmuch as refrigeration equipment was not require
banana trade, He said that neither vessel possessed any
or other armament and he had no reason to believe that
vessel was to be used for anything other than banana trade.

This informant said that the Miami Shipbuilding
Corporation is also building a metal barge which will be
propelled by two airplane engines with airplane propellers
in the rear, He explained that some months ago MC C2l0RY came
to the Miami Shipbuilding Corporation with plans drawn up by
30B HOBBS, a Miami boat designer, for the construction of a
special barge to be used by the Estrella Fruit Company in
connection with the operation of its Ecuadorian busines
MC CRORY explained that some of the. banana plantations which
are located in the interior of Scuador can not be reached
by vessels going upstream because of the shallow swift
currents. -It had been the practice of the Ustrella Fruit
Company to fly rubber boats by plane to these plantations
so that the bananas could be floated downstream on board
these rafts. According to MC ClORY the barge now under
construction by the Miami Shipbuilding Corporation will be
used to transport these rubber boats upstream to the
plantations, the barge being constructed for operation in
swift shallow streams, T-36 said he had learned that MG CRORY
had originally intended to ship this barge to Zcuador on either
the CRISTOBAL CARRIER or the ANCON TRADER tut had been unable
to obtain an export license because of some legal technicality.

T-36 said that BURT ERICKSON is an old-time ship
captain who is frequently employed by MC CRORY to transport
yachts and other crafts which he has sold to their »vurchasers.

T-36 said he possessed no evidence that either
MC CRORY or ERICKSON were engaged in any illezal activity.

On July 20, 1953, Miami Informant T-37, of known

A certificate of clearance was also filed by ATKINSON
for the ARB described as a motor vessel of American rezistry,
15 ton, captained by JOHN F. MANNION. This certificate
reflected that there had been only two men on board. The
boat was equipped with 500 gallons of gasoline for fuel and
20 gallons for oil.

All of the above described vessels were cleared by
Customs July 18, 1953,

On July 22, 1953, Miami Informant T-37 advised that
all three of the above described vessels were still in port
and that 4 SON had advised U. S. Customs that the delay
in their departure was due to refrigeration trouble. It is
to be noted, however, that Miami Informant T-36 pointed out
that neither the ANCON TRADER nor the CRISTOSAL CARRI
equipped with refrigeration equipment. T-37 said that
agents searched the CRISTOBAL CARRISR and the ANCON TRADER,
July 20, 1953, with negative results.

Miami Informant T-38, of known reliability,
at about 4:00 F. id on July 24, 1953, that the
and the CRISTOB:L CARRIZR had cast anchor and were being
towed down the Miami ver toward the open sea. He said that
the ARB, which had been docked adjacent to the ANCON Ti Ry
was scheduled to leave Miami at about 6:30 F. M. This informant
said he had observed no suspicious activity around any of
these boats and that the only material which appeared to have
been loaded on any of them seemed to be food supplies.

» Miami Informant T-34 reported on July 26, 1953 that
the ARB was searched shortly before it cast off on the late
afternoon or early evening of July 24, 1953 and that it
contained nothing of a suspicious nature on board. He said
that the two rear fuel tanks were empty but that the two
side tanks were apparently filled. There were only two men
on board and one, the captain, was observed proceeding toward
a building in which the office of T 3 J. MC CRORY is
located, immediately prior to departure. T-34 said that this
skipper, JOHN MANNION and HERBERT M DA, the seaman, on
board reported that they would stop at Dinner Key, a harvor
at Coconut Grove, Miami, for additional fuel before leaving
the Florida coast.

au said that although the CRISTOBAL
the ANCOM TRADER were observed off the coast near Marathon
on the day following their departure from the port of Miami,
that the 3 had completely disapveared following its departure
from the port of. Miami. ATKINSON, the agent for all three
of these boats had previously reported to T-37 that the three
boats would travel in convoy and that the ARB was edng
only as far as Christobal, Panama, its destination.

On July 30, 1953, T-3) advised that the "ARB" had
arrived at the Port of Key West, Florida on the preceding
Sunday, July 26,-1953, with four men on board. T-3l advised
it had been ascertained through an Informant that one of
these men on board had been addressed as TOM, and answered
the general description of THOMAS J, McCRORY.

On August 3, 1953, T-39, reported that the "ARB"
was still in Key West amd that McCRORY had been observed to
visit this boat for approximately one hour on August 2, 1953.

On August }, 1953, Miami Informant T-.0, of known
reliability, being an official of a Federal Agency which con-
ducts investigations, reported that the "ARB" was still at
Key West, Florida, and that the Master of that boat, JOHN
MANNION, had disclosed that he had intended to depart at mid-
night for, Belizes, Honduras.

It is to be noted from the above-described infor-
mation, that the "ARB" departed from Miami on July 2h, 1953,
with two men on board, at which time it was destined to
Cristobal, Panama Canal Zone, and that it arrived two days
later at Key West with four men on board; that as of August
lh, 1953, it was prepared to depart for the Port of Belize rather
than the Panama Canal Zone. It is also to be noted that this
boat did not travel in convoy with the "Cristobal Carrier"
and the "Ancon Trader" as was originally planned.

On August 6, 1953, T-lO advised that the U. S. Cus-
toms Service had placed a $1,000.00 penalty against the "ARB"
and that this boat cannot depart from the Port of Key West
until this sum is paid or until bond is posted. Informant ex-
plained that this penalty was based upon the fact that U. S.
Customs in Miami had granted clearance to the "ARB" on July 18,
1953, and that this boat did not depart within the forty-eight
hour period or obtain an extension as required under the law;
and that, further, the "ARB" after arriving at Key West (which
was not its announced port of destination) did not report to
Customs within a twenty-four hour limit and did not report
within the forty-eight hour period..

T-4L0 said that an attempt had been made to interview
the Master of the "Arb" at Key West, but that this individual
was in a drunken condition and could..not be interviewed. How-
ever, it was ascertained through inquiry that McCRORY had re-
cently been seen in Key West in the company of a woman, as-
certained not to be his wife.

T-40 said that on August 5, 1953, Mrs. THOMAS J.
McCRORY, accompanied by ARTHUR ATKINSON, called at the office
of the U. 8, Customs in Miami relative to the "Arb", and that
Mrs. McCRORY stated that her husband, who had ailegedly departed
from the United States, would want to fire JOHN MANNION Master
of the "Arb", because of his conduct and because of the diffi-
culties in which this vessel had been placed. T-40 said that
Mrs. McCRORY apparently did not know that her husband had al-
ready been down to Key West with another woman and had visited
the “Arb” there.

“With regard to DIEGO VINCENTE TEJERA y RESCALVO

With further reference to the above-described boats,
on July 31, 1953, Mr. GUSTAV PETERSON of the Estrella Fruit
Company, New Orleans, advised that the "Cristobal Carrier" and
the "Ancon Trader" were: purchased from the Condenser Service
and Engineering Company by the Agencias De Cabotaje, S. A.,

a Panamanian Corporation, the Estrella Fruit Shipping Company
acting solely as Disbursing Agent in the deal. Estrella is
the sole agent in the United States for Compania De Astral,
S.A., of Panama, whose foreign representative, FOLKE ANDERSON,
instructed PETTERSON in this matter.

PETTERSON advised the only connection he knows of
between ASTRAL and CABOTAJE is that they are routine business
friends and he is confident that FOLKE ANDERSON is not di-
rectly connected with CABOTAJE. The air rescue boat, the "ARB"
has been owned by ESTRELLA since July 30, 1951, and was ac-
quired at the request of ANDERSON, who wanted the use of it
for pleasure when in Miami, Florida, and who has used it for
that. purpose. He advised that the "ARB" has been loaned to
ASTRAL.

According to PETTERSON, as he understands it, the
"ARB" together with the "ANCON TRADER" and the "CRISTOBAL CARRIER,"’
left Miami July 2h, 1953, and should reach the Panama Canal July 31,
1953. He understands that CABOTAJE still owns the LCI's.
The destination of all three vessels is Esmeraldas, Ecuador,
where the LCI's will be used for coastwise hauling of bananas
and the "ARB" will serve ASTRAL as a utility vessel.

PETTERSON advised he first met THOMAS J. McCRORY
in Miami in late August, 1952. ANDERSON had apparently
known McCRORY before. . PETTERSON's first business dealing
with McCRORY was in the purchase of the LCI's in February,
1953. Since that time, McCRORY has been the ship Agent for
all three vessels with virtually unlimited authority in re-
spect to maintenance, equipping, crewing and arranging their
departure.

PETTERSON states that McCRORY advised him by tele-
phone, July 28, 1953, that these vessels were off Honduras
and "doing all right". He did not indicate the three vessels
were traveling together and PETTERSON assumed they were.

On July 3, 1953, McCRORY wrote PETTERSON as follows:
"The Ancon Trader, Cristobal Carrier, and crash boat are ready
for clearance to Ecuador as soon as fuel and stores are aboard.
They are only partially crewed but the hands are available and
will be signed on as soon as you are ready. The enclosed state~
ment is complete up to July 1, with the exception of dockage
charges. It was not possible to take the air boat on her trials
as scheduled due to changes necessary in the engine cooling de-
sign, but she will definitely be ready for the trials on duly
6 and I am certain they will be successful. We have continued
our efforts to sell the Arb. Early in June we gave a weekend
demonstration to Diego Rescalvo, a very wealthy Cuban. Went to
Salt Key 100 miles south of here. So far it has only amounted
to a shakedown cruise but he may make an offer now that I have i
told him we are definitely leaving.’ I have quoted him $30,000. |
due to the improvements.” H

“Mr. PETTERSON said he had no knowledge of any Cubans.
other than the individual mentioned by McCRORY in above letter
as being interested in any of these vessels. He said he did
not know the person named by McCRORY nor did he know PRIO or
any of PRIC's close associates. He advised that HENRY M.
WATKINS and BURT ERICKSON were unknown to him.

On August 3, 1953, Mr. PETTERSON advised he had re- }
ceived information from the Continental Shipping Corporation :
of the Panama Canal Zone, ‘that the "Cristobal" Carrier and the |
"Ancon Trader" had arrived at Cristobal in the Panama Canal |
Zone at 10:00 P.M., August 1, 1953. He said no mention was made

JULY 19, 1953 BY CUBAN
AUTHORITIES

Miami Informants T-5 and T-6 reported on July 27,
1953, that on Sunday, July 19, 1953, the CubanNayy seized
at Cay Sal (also known as Salt Key), a cache of arms in an
abandoned shack. This seizure was the result of a tip re-
ceived by the Cuban authorities. T-5 stated that this indivi-
dual who furnished the tip had been employed to guard these
armsSe

T-5 and T-6 attributed this arms cache to CARLOS
PRIO and his follers and stated that this material was ap-
parently to be used against the Batista Government.

According to T-5 and 6, the weapons seized were as
follows:

6 45 Calibre Thompson sub-machine guns
10,000 rounds: of M+1 cartridges

These Informants said that there were four boxes of
45 calibre ammunition, each bearing a wax seal reading
"Secretaria de Guerra y Marina - IGE - Delegacion de Muni-
ciones", which T-5 said is a term used by the Secretary of
War and Navy of the Mexican Government. He said that inside
of these boxes was a slip of paper bearing a rubber stamp
seal reflecting that this ammunition had been counted by E,
LOYO on behalf of EMILEO LOYO GONZALES, Captain of the Second
Infantry, this being written in Spanish.

Inside of each of the four boxes were addresses as
follows: Box #1 - Nicanor Fernandez, Aurora Y S, Diaz Miro,
Tampico, Mexico; Box #2, Isauro Villarreal, AUDUANA,:117
Norte Tampico, Mexico; Box #3 Jabonera de Tampico SA, 3rd
Avenue Y SLETA, Tampico, Mexico; Box #,, Casa Grenior 3A,
Avenue EJER Cito Nacional 209, Mexico d f.

“T-5 was of the opinion that these labels indicated |
where the boxes of ammmition had been obtained. :

T-5 also exhibited two labels, one of these had been
removed from a shotgun box of a Browning automatic shot gun,
St. Louis, Missouri, which bore Number 384962, on which had
been pasted a very small label of Montgomery Ward. Another
small label which he exhibited had been removed from another
box which indicated that the gun had been handled by the A. Jy
Anderson Company, Ft, Worth, Texas, He said there were no. ad-
ditional labels on any of the other boxes containing individual
shotguns.

T-5 and T-6 also said that inside the shack where
the above described ammunitions were found, there were signs
or placards which are usually posed on a stake, bearing the
names "Salty IIIy"Marathorit and'UJumbo", They did not know the
significiance of these names but were of the opinion that they
might be the names of yachts or boats which may have had some~
thing to do with the presence of the above described munitions.

The July 28, 1953 issue of the Miami Herald carried
a photograph of BATISTA and a number of Cuban Naval Officers
examining a package containing what appeared to be 45 calibre
revolvers. Underneath this photograph it was stated, "Cache
of arms being examined by President FULGENCIO BATISTA and

large letters on the wall of the shack, It is also noted, ac-
cording to this photograph, that the hand gernades were in a
box on which could be seen the following - "Mexico - Aceitera
Y Jabonera Frontizea S.A,, Monterry"., Tel 126-90".

T-5 also exhibited a label reading as follows:
"50 cartridges - ball, calibre 30, M1, Mar 520, Lot L013204,
Black City Arsenal. He said that this label had been taken
from one of the boxes of 30 calibre ammunition

A photogr:phic copy of the 30 calibre ammunition
box label and one t-ken from the automatic shot gun box,
described above, are being retained in the files of the Miami

Miami ‘informant T-42, of known- reliability, reported in June
i 1953 that one GUILLERMO FUENTES GONZALEZ traveling on a Mexican passport
issued at Mexico City in Fébruary 1953 was expected to arrive in Kings-
ton, Jamaica, by air on May 21, 1953, and was believed to have in his
possession arms and marked maps of Cuba, and to be a person connected
with anti-Batista activities.. According to T-42, this man was located
at the Myrtle Bank Hotel in Kingston, It was confidentially ascertained
that he had in his possession a Mauser and a Spanish revolver and approxi~
i mately ninety rounds of ammunition, On the basis of this information,
! FUENTES was arrested on the morning of May 22, 1953, on a charge of » —
illegal importation of arms into the British Colony of Jamaica, After
hearing before a local magistrate in Jamaica, he was remanded in custody
and placed in the local jail. After this his remaining effects were
examined by the authoritics in Jamaica, at which time a large number of
papers and a series of maps of the island of Cuba and City of Havana
were found,

In addition to these items, a pilot's license issued to AURELIANO
SANCHEZ ARANGO was discovered. A statement was taken from this man, at
which time he admitted that:his true identity was. that of SANCHEZ ARANGO
and that he was the former Foreign Minister of Cuba in the government of
CARLOS PRIO, who was overthrown by BATISTA.

SANCHEZ ARANGO also stated, according to T=-42, that he was in
charge of the underground movement dedicated to the overthrow of BATISTA,
but that he regrettod very much his indiscretion in, bringing arms to
Jamaica, He advised that he had no intent to use. the arms or to conspire
in revolution in Jamaica, but was enroute to Haiti, He also claimed that
he was a close friend of British Foreign Minister ANTHONY EDEN, °

T-42 said that no detailed inquiry was made in regard to his
intended revolutionary activities, :

It was ascertained from SANCHEZ ARANGO, however, that he was
enroute to Haiti for the purpose of making a contact in Port-Au-Prince,

T-42 said that this man had in his possession a round trip ticket
from Mexico City to Ciudad Trujillo, Dominican Republic, He denied, how-
ever, that he was enroute to this City, stating that he had bought this

_ ticket merely to throw off anyone that might be interested in his destina~
tion, He also denied that he had ever been to Ciudad Trujillo, but exami-
nation of his Mexican passport reflected he had been therein April 1953 or
that someone using the identical passport had been theré, Narcan

Embassy in Mexico information to the effect that SANCHEZ ARANGO possesses
two passports issued in names other than his own ~ GUILLERMO FUENTES
GONZALEZ and JOSE VICTOR SANCHEZ-VALADEZ,. According to this informant
it was also reported that SANCHEZ ARANGO, traveling as FUENTES, arrived
on May 31, 1953, at the Mexico City Airport from Panama and was met by
six persons, one of whom was identical with the photograph of RAUL RODRI-
GUEZ y SANTOS,

This informant stated that the following persons are known con-
tacts of SANCHEZ ARANGO: a

RICARDO ARTIGAS No, 5-547, Dalido Island, Miami, Beach,
Florida,

LUIS G. FERNANDEZ, 2320 Tyger (Tyler??) Peck (?), Miami,
Florida.

MURIEL LEDERER, 5644 Netherlands Avenue, Riverdale 7,

that same day, T-1 gathered the impression that considerable importance
was attached to.this rendezvous, it being noted that it is generally cus-
tomary for a Chief of State to receive callers at his home or office,
Special Agent MELVIN A, THOMPSON and the writer ascertained by physical
surveillance that this meeting took place at 10:25 iM on July 24, 1953, H
at the Casa Marina Resteurant. It was observed that PRIO was driven to

this rendezvous by SEGUNDO CURTI, former Minister of Interiér under PRIO,

and that immediately upon arrival in the parking area of this restaurant

PRIO, carrying a briefcase, got into another car bearing Florida license

1B 3112, and drove off with the two occupants of this car, followed by

CURTI at a discreet distance, At 11:00 AM PRIO and CURTI, in the latter's
automobile, left Key Biscayne followed by the other car, It was observed

by the writer that one of these men, not the driver, bore a striking resan-

blance to a photograph of AURELIANO SANCHEZ ARANGO, It was noted, however,

that this person. was clean shaven, although the latter's photograph. possessed

by the Miami Office reflects that he has a mustache, It appeared that occu-

pants of the two automobiles were exercising caution to determine if they

were under surveillance. Consequently, the surveillance was dropped as both

cars left Key. Biscayne, 7

With regard to the cer bearing license 1E 3112, Florida, Mrs,
MAE DAY of Curry U-Drive-It Company, Miami Beach, reported on July 16, 1953,
that this car, owned by the Curry U-Drive-It Company, .was rented on June 27,
1953, to JOSE VEGA, Miami address c/o Gateway-Hotel, Miami Springs, home
address 19 Evergreen Avenue, Lynbrook, New York, ‘and possessor of New York
operator's license 561-6765, Mrs. DAY said that VEGA had previously rented
this automobile from May 11, 1953, to June 23, 1953.

_.- The writer observed during the above described surveillance 'y how
ever, that the driver of this car is not identical to the JOSE VEGA who is
registered at the Miami Gateway Hotel, The driver on that day appeared to
be about forty years of age with black hair, black heavy mustache, dark com-
plexion and of a rather muscular build,

In connection with the above information it is to be noted, as
reported under Section 9 above, that the "Arb", “Christoball Carrier", and
the "Ancon Trader" cast anchor from the Port of Miami on the late afternoon
and early evening of July 24, 1953, after having originally cleared with
Customs for July 18, 1953,

It is not known, however, whether the presence of the above des-
cribed individual, who bore a striking resemblance to SANCHEZ ARANGO, had
anything to do with these three boats,

XII. ALLEGED ARMS TRAFFIC

A. A Proposition to Purchase by Fernandez Castro and Jose Orgaz:

On June 21, 1953, T-14 reported that on June 20, 1953, JOSE
ORGAZ, an import-export man living in Miami, and a Cuban named FERNANDEZ
CASTRO called on T~14 and wanted to purchase 5, 000 submachine guns and
1,000 pistols, as well. as ammunition for both types of.weapons, to be
smuggled by the seller into Cuba,

T-14 explained that he himself has many contacts with Cubans
in the Miami area and has in the past dealt in arms sales, but that he
wants to avoid violating any Federal laws, including the Neutrality Act
which prohibits the sm ng of arms and anmunition from the United States
to Cuba, T-1) said th 2 advised ORGAZ and FERNANDEZ CASTRO that he was
not interested in that portion of their proposition to smuggle arms and
ammunition into Cuba, but that he was interested in selling the guns that
they wanted to buy. He said that he quoted them a price of $220 apiece
for the submachine guns and he received the impression that they considered
this a fair price.

T-l, said that he also asked them if these guns were being pur-
chased on behalf of the PRIO group and they replied in the negative, but
declined to state who they were representing,

T-14 seid that when these two men left him they indicated that
they were departing for Havena by plane the following morning at about
9:30 o'clock.

T-14, explained thet JESSE A, VICKERS of Miami is trying to find
a buyer for a large quantity of arms and ammunition which are presently
stored in Italy. -T-1) said that VICKERS is the Miami agent for a group of
men who own these materials, T-14 said that he has received the impression
that the owners are American end Italians and include certain "racket"
individuals, T-14 said-that CASTRO and ORGAZ were informed about these
particular guns.

J. A. VICKERS, born March 25, 1907, in Atlanta, was investigated
. in 1949 concerning the purchase of a plane reportedly to be used in an at~
tempted invasion of the Dominican Republic, but prosecution against him i
was declined. In 1946 VICKERS, the Chairman of the Disposal Classification
Board Supply Division, Miami Air Depot; was investigated for fraud eageinst
the Government and under the Surplus Property Act relative to the unlawful
scrapping of material. Prosecution was not authorized. In 1950 information

MM 2-165

was received that VICKERS was involved in a scheme to purchase arms for
the Caribbean Legion for use against the Dominican Republic, This scheme
did not pass the planning stage, VICKERS, who operates the Federated
Sales Company, Miami, was interviewed by the Miami Office May 4, 1953,
relative to his possession of ten fake M3 guns, These guns had been
shipped from El Paso, Texas, to VICKERS by ED BROWDER, who paid 300,00
by means of a bad check to an El Paso metal concern to have these weapons
made up to his order, BROWDER was subsequently arrested on a bad check
charge, VICKERS upon interview by Special Agent MELVIN 4, THOMPSON and
the writer concerning these guns, claimed that BROWDER had said thet he
had obtained these M3 guns after they had been disposed of by the U. S,
Government as beyond repair and not usable, but that BROWDER felt that
they could be put in shape for resale, VICKERS cleimed that he agreed to
teke ten of these guns at $10 each upon the condition that they could be
reconditioned for sale; that he planned to resell these guns to the Cuban
Government if they could be reconditioned, He claimed thet he made no
effort, however, to dispose of these guns after he examined them and found
them to be beyond a state of repair, At that time VICKERS told the inter-
viewing agents that he was not then engaged in the sale or exporting of
any guns, although he would have attempted to have disposed of the M3 guns,
which were then in his possession, He said that BROWDER claimed to be in
@ position to obtain more of these guns in the event that VICKERS found
these could be reconditioned, i

T-14 described JOSE ORGAZ as being a small wiry individual who
resides in Miami and who apparently was born in Cuba, He said that ORGAZ
appeared to be serving as an intermediary for CASTRO,

TL, described FERNANDEZ CASTRO as follows:

Age 45 to 50
Height 6!

Complexion Light

Hair Brown

Weight 180 lbs,

Build Rugged

Speech, Speaks good English

Occupation Was, or still may be, a General

in the Cuban Army,

On June 22, 1953, examination at Immigration and Naturalization
Service of the manifest for Pen American flight 421, which departed from
Miami for Havana on that date, reflected that JOSEPH R, ORGAZ and ARTURO
PLUTARCO FERNANDEZ DE CASTRO DIAZ were passengers on this flight,

Examination of Visitor Permit Card T-226804 at INS on June 22,
reflected that ARTURO PLUTARCO FERNANDEZ DE. CASTRO DIAZ, born June 28,
1905, at Matanzas, Cardenas, Cuba; home address Primclles 320 Cerro,
Havana, Cuba; described as an employee by occupation, was admitted to
the United States at Miami on June 19, 1953, destined to ANGELA ORGAZ,
5320 S, W, Second Street, Miami, until June 26, 1953,. He was in posses-
sion of Cuban passport number 25726 scheduled to expire August 17, 1956.
This card reflected that FERNANDEZ is six feet tall, had brown hair,
brown eyes, is of the Cuban.race and that his wife is C. LOPEZ. He de-
parted from Miami on June 21, 1953.

On June 14, 1953, T-43, of known reliability and who is also
a personal friend of J@E ORGAZ, advised thet ORGAZ had returned to Cuba
over the weekend and had entered « hospital for an operation. He said
that on the previous Friday, June 19, 1953, ORG:Z exhibited to T+43 some
chest X-rays which he had just had taken in Cuba, T-43 said that’ he re-
ferred these X-rays to a Miami doctor who expressed the ovinion that ORGAZ
has a lung cancer of a very serious nature, T-43 said that ORG:Z-had lost
a great amount of weight and appeared to be in a very serious condition,
although he, ORGsZ, himself did not know that he had a possible lung. can-
cer,

On June 26, 1953, T-43 said that ORGAZ had returned to Miami to
enter the Veterans Administration Hospital for an operation inasmuch as
the Havena doctor declined to operate at the last moment. T-43 has advised
that ORGAZ served in World War IIT as a momber of the American military ser-
vice and fought overseas, Several days later the Miami newspapers announced
the death of JOSH ORGAZ at the Veterans Administration hospital.

T-43 said thet during the pre

operation, T-43 described DeCASTRO as being a close onal friend of
ORGAZ and as having been former head of the Cuban Secret Police who was
dismissed from Office when BATISTA staged his coup d! etat. T-43 said that
DeCASTRO had served under the PRIO government as well. as from previous
Cuban governments in that capacity.. He said. that so far as he knows DeCASTRO
is presently unemployed, He also said that he had gathered from conversations
with ORG\Z and DeCASTRO that DeCASTRO was one of the few Cuban officials who
had left office without making a personal fortune.

rifles described above on behelf of PRIO. interest,

. On June 9, 1953, Miami informant T-44, of known reliability, who
is an officer of a Federal agency which conducts investigations, reported
that on May 19, 1953, PaUL B, HICKMAN, 213 Northeast Second avenue, Miami,
Florida, an aircraft parts dealer, was in New York for the purpose of pur-
cashing 5,000 carbines for HARRY S. CANE of the Cane Importing, Company of ‘
Miami, I’ was ascertained thet HICKMAN did not mow whether the carbines
were destined for Cuba or other Latin American countries, However, HICKMAN
approached Dr, ALBERT W. MORRIS, 54 Buckingham Street, Sp: ingfield, Massachu-
setts, owner of the Morris Engineering Company, who advised HICKMAN that he
could provide the desired quantity of carbines, On May 20, 1953, HICKMAN
met MCRRIS at the Belmont Plaza Hotel, New York City, at which time HICKMAN
became convinced that MORRIS could not.supply the required amount of carbines
and the deal fell through. HICKMAN subsequently returned to Miami, :

About the end of May 1953 ERWIN STRAUSS, attorney, New York City,

advised ALFRED MANHEIM, New York City, that the Morris Engineering Company

. of Springfield had from 2,000 to 3,500 carbines stored in New dersey which

and wished to use a middle man. DAM disclosed that the Morris Engineering
Company had 2,000 carbines stored in New Jersey, and that the Cubans had
offered to pay $70 each for them, iccording to informant, DAM stated that
Dr. MRIS had already made a commitment to the Cubans, who had been placed

on June 9, 1953, that he thought the sale of the 1,000 rifles mentioned
above by T-5 was still in a negotiating stage pending the ability of the
Cubans to ship them out of the country, He was of the opinion that BETTY

LB. Proposition Made to Miami Informant T-14 at El Toledo
Restaurant. Miami, Florida:

On May 28, 1953, Miami. Informant T-14 reported that
in about November or December, 1952. a Cuban, whose identity
was never disclosed to the Informant. asked the Informant to
come to the El Toledo Restaurant, Biscayne Boulevard at
Northeast 2nd Street, which is operated by JOB and FRANK
MIGUEL, wno at that time were employed to guard PRIO's resi-
dence. While there, this Cuban provositioned T~i4 abcut
taking out of the United States a shipment of arms for CARLOS
PRIO. It was implied that these arms wer: lovated somewhere
in the West or Southwest. Informant said that he turned down
this offer, explaining he did not want to violate the
Neutrality Act. Informant said he then exhibited to this
Cuban a list of arms located in Europe which he knows to be
for sale. Subsequentiy, the Informant was placed ia touch
with another individual who was represented as being one of
PRIO's men, but this party told Informant that PRIO was not
interested in those arms. Informant said that these Cubans
were very "cozy" and their names were not disclosed to the
Informant. However, the Informant said he got the impression,
during his discussions with both of these Cubans, that CARLOS
PRIO is wary of confidence schemes, and, although willing to
utilize the services of T-14 in transporting out of the
United States arms already possessed by PRIO, that PRIO is
unwilling to take any risks in purchasing arms. Informant
said that it is rumored around Miami among persons who have
in the past dealt in arms that PR2O is acquiring arms and
munitions from the Mexican Government. T-14 claims he has
been frequently approached by representatives of various
Latin countries, who 2 interested in buying arms and other
eguipment for their respective countries,

extra money while working on his job with the United States
Time Corporation in Texas. SILVERSTEIN-explained that he is
in the market for 1,000 M-1 rifles, and, in view of the fact
that Texas laws concerning the sale. of firearms are. very lax,
he felt that the Informant would-be in a good position while
traveling around Texas to contact various gunsmiths and other
ayms dealers in order to locate a supply of M-l's. After any
batch of guns is located, T-48 should then telephonically
contact SILVERSTEIN collect, and SILVERSTEIN would then fly
to Texas, where he would handle further negotiations.

SILVERSTEIN told 7-48 that he was trying to purchase
these guns on behalf of the PRIO grouo (CARLOS PRIO SCCARRAS,
former president of Cuba now living in Miami after being over-
thrown by BATISTA March 10, 1952). SILVERSTEIN described his
Cuban contact as being one of the victims in the $240,000.00
robbery which took place at Fort Worth, Texas. SILVERSTEIN
added: that T-48 could offer up to $70.00 apiece for each of
whese weapons and that he, himself, expected to get $100.00
apiece for them,

SILVERSTEIN claimed that this was a "hot" proposi-
tion and that immediate action must be taken, because they
might not be needed after a thirty-day period. SILVERSTEIN
also indicated he was interested in: obtaining grenades
or anything else in heavy guns. SILVERSTEIN indicated that
T-48 should be able to make $2,000.00 or $3,000.00 as his
share in arranging such a deal.

SILVERSTEIN also related to T-48 that on a previous
occasion he had flown to Canada, near Buffalo, New York,
relative to a shipment of guns which were to be shipped from
Canada to the United States, where,they were to be repacked
for a customer in this country. He explained that all he had
to do on that occasion was to sign some sort of an export
license near the border. He also related that on another
occasion he had gone to New York and from there to Gonnecticut,
where he had participated in a meeting, along with ten or
eleven other people, concerning a gun d » and the guns in
this instance were supposed to be located in Canada and were
to be reshipped to Connecticut for purchase for the "old man,"
but that this deal fell through because someone in the group
offered to sell similar guns at $48.00 apiece. On this

“ occasion, -according to SILVERSTEIN, the Cuban customer had
paid $7,000.00 to have a plane and several trucks available
for use at a warehouse in the New York area.

MM (2-165

T-48 said that he left the door open, but made
no commitment following this first discussion with SILVERSTEIN.

On July 17, 1953, T-48 telephonically advised that
he had revisited SILVERSTEIN at Sussman's Luggage Shop. When
he entered the store, SILVERSTEIN was talking long distance
with a party in New York City. SILVERSTEIN later explained
to T-48 that about thirty minutes previously (at about 2:00
PM), he had just been talking to a Cuban who had flown up
from Havana and who was again immediately departing for
Havana following a-proposition made by this Cuban to SILVER-
STEIN to purchase five sub-machine guns of .45 caliber.
SILVERSTEIN said that he told the Cuban thet he should return
to Miami with the necessary money on the following. Monday
(July 20),-and that he, SILVERSTEIN, would have the guns
ready for delivery by the following Wednesday. SILVERSTEIN
explained that he had just called New York City in an effort
to locate five machine guns, and that he hoped to have these
guns in Miami before next Wednesday, but that it might be
necessary for him to fly to New York in order to obtain them.
He did not disclose the identity of this Cuban to T-48, but
indicated that this Cuban was connected with the PRIO group.

SILVERSTEIN also told T-48 that he has in his
possession a letter from one of PRIO's aides requesting
SILVERSTEIN to come see CARLOS PRIO at his Miami home.
SILVERSTEIN said that after receiving this letter he went to
PRIO's home in company with this Cuban aide, but they were
told that PRIO had left about an hour previously for Boston,
Massachusetts, for medical treatment. The aide then suggested
that they call on PRIO's brother, but. SILVERSTEIN declined,
stating that he wanted to see only PRIO.

When T-48 questioned SILVERSTEIN concerning the
Texas gun proposition, SILVERSTEIN said that the guns would
be shipped to Mexico until they were needed by the PRIO
_ people, and that this matter had the sanction of the Mexican
government. SILVERSTEIN also told T-48 that the United States
Government did not care for the BATISTA ime and would not
make an issue of anything so long as the guns go to an anti-
BATISTA crowd. 7

. T-48 furnished the following description of

E.__Anonymous Report Concerning Rifle Shipment to Cuba:

On June 5, 1953, Miami Informant T-49, of known
reliability, being an employee of a Federal Agency which
conducts investigations, reported that he had received a
letter reading as follows:

"To:
U.S. Border Patrol
Ft. Myers, Fla.

"In the near future, watch out for .
the possible trans-shipment of 5000 rifles
to Cuba via local shrimp boat. Watch for
middle age man with Polish, accent possibly
owner or operator."

/s/ “AMERICAN CITIZEN"

T-h9 said that it was his opinion that this is a
result of the rumors that. PRIO-is going to return to Cuba and
take over.

G. Comment by CARLOS PRIO Relative to Arms Smuggling in
August, 1953: eeneteoeosocasaos

Miami Informant 1-25 reported that CARLOS PRIO has
made the following comment concerning the smuggling of arms
into Cuba by his group.

MM 2=165

PRIO reported, "Yes, we have succeeded in smuggling
armament into Cuba. Our movement, when the cry for freedom
and democracy is given, will constitute the strongest and best
organized attack on tyrany ever registered in the history of
the Western Hemisphere. We have to clean Cuba, not just of
BATISTA and his gangsters, but we will have to go deeper into
the very roots of each tyranical plant. I do not claim my
administration is absolutely clean and honest, because that
is physically impossible in a democracy, but at least those
sinners in my. administration are politicians and not henchmen
or gangsters. Our revolution will clearly reflect the word.
It will not be just a coup to gain power, but a complete
cleaning up job throughout our country.

"Because of the attitude of the United States Depart-
ment of State, I have at all times been most careful in hand-
ling my-revolutionary business. Up to date no one can put
their finger on me. Yes, I have been in full command of many
armament purchases right here in the United States, but no one
can ever-prove that. I-have always dealt through four or five
persons and never directly with just: one."

XIII. FINANCES OF PRIO

Miami Informant T-4 reported on April 23, 1953,
that as of that date CARLOS FPRIO had a balance of only $500.00

Miami Informant.T-50, of known reliability, reported
on June 2, 1953, that the First National Bank of Miami possessed
no record of a $50,000.00 check allegedly deposited by PRIO on
May 27, 1953, at. the Guaranty Trust Company, New York City.

On June 2nd, T-50 said PRIO does not maintain an account at
this bank. :

With reference to this $50,000.00 check, Miami
Informant T-51, of known reliability, reported on May 29, 1953,
that CARLOS PRIO SOCARRAS deposited a 50,000.00 check to his

Miami Informant T-25 learned on August 3, 1953,
that PRIO has indicated that he keeps his money in’a number
of different banks outside of Cuba, primarily in the United

States and in Mexico.

XIV. ALLEGED MEETING OF CUBANS TO BOMB HAVANA

Miami Informant T-5 reported on July 13, 1953,
that on July 11, 1953, he had receiyed a report from Cuba
through official. channels to the effect that there. had been
a meeting of Cubans at 1811 S, W, 2nd Road, Telephone 82-2086,
and that this meeting had been held for the purpose of planning
the bombing of Havana. T-5. said that his. source was of the
opinion that the PRIO group would cause a bomb to be dropped
in Havana in order to arouse the students to a revolt against
BATISTA from within the country. :

Miami Informant 1-53, of known reliability,
reported that Telephone 62-2086, at 1811'S. W. 2nd Road, :is
assigned to RAFAEL PEREZ of the same address. T-5 said that ‘
RAFAEL PEREZ is a cousin,or other distant relative, of CARLOS

“PRIO and is one of PRIO's followers. *

XV. CONCERNING JOSEPH AND FRANK MIGUEL,
: ti FORMER GUARDS AT PRIO RESIDENCE,
: 2100 SOUTH’ MIAMI AVENUE

: Miami Informant T-54, of known reliability, who
is_presently acquainted with ANTONIO PRIO, brother of CARLOS
PRIO, reported on June 2, 1953, that ANTONIO PRIO had recently
come to him for advice, explaining that his brother CARLOS had
until recently in his employ, two guards, JOSEPH and FRANK
MIGUEL, Miami policemen, who during their off-hours were engaged
by PRIO to guard his family and residence at 2100 South Miami
Avenue. According to the information furnished the Informant
by ANTONIO PRIO, about three months previously an unidentified
individual approached FRANK MIGUEL and told him that they would
pay the MIGUEL brothers well if they would "get lost." This
information came to the attention of ANTONIO PRIO but, at the
time, he did not give the matter much.thought. However,
because of subsequent developments, ANPONIO. had reason to
suspect the reliability and intentions of JOSEPH and FRANK
MIGUEL, and desired for Informant to advise the Federal Bureau
of Investigation concerning his suspicions. ANTONIO PRIO told
the Informant that. he feared for his brother's life and safety.
The Informant stated that because of the information obtained
by ANTONIO and his brother, CARLOS PRIO, the two MIGUEL
brothers were dismissed as guards and another private detective
agency hired to perform this service.

MM 2-165

On’ June 3, 1953, ANTONIO PRIO,accompanied by T~5h,
called at the Miami Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
At this time, ANTONIO PRIO, speaking through T-5), as interpreter ;
advised the writer as follows. fe i

ANTONIO PRIO said that shortly after CARLOS PRIO
acquired his present residence at 2100 South Miami Avenue,
following his flight to Miami after having been overthrown by
BATISTA on March 10 1952, CARLOS acquired the services of
JOSEPH and FRANK MIGUEL, both Miami policemen, ‘to guard his
residence and family, because he feared that BATISTA or some
‘of his followers might attempt to harm PRIO or some member of
his family or might attempt some act on the premises which
would prove embarrasing to PRIO, ANTONIO said that his
brother was happy to have two Miami policemen employed in this
Capacity, because of the effect it would have upon the people
in. Cuba from a psychological standpoint. During the time the
two MIGUEL brothers were employed there, ANTONIO PRIO said
that he, himself, gave them money to purchase the El Toledo
Restaurant at Biscayne Boulevard and Northeast 2nd Street,
ANTONIO said this was done as a friendly gesture and that
it was in the nature of a loan to a friend. ANTONIO said that
an investigator from thé Miani Police Department had recently
questioned CARLOS PRIO concerning his employment, of the two
MIGUEL brothers, this inquiry apparently being made from'a
police administrative standpoint, and that this was the reason
given to-the MIGUELs by CARLOS PRIO for their dismissal from
his service. E

ANTONIO explained, however, that the real reason

for their dismissal was because of information received by

the PRIOs reflecting that the MIGUEL brothers might actually

be in the pay of BATISTA. ANTONIO said that shortly prior to
their dismissal, it was ascertained that both JOSEPH and FRANK
MIGUEL, without notifying PRIO, took a trip to Cuba, where an
official police car was placed at their disposal while there ;
and where they talked to Colonel HERNANDO HERNANDEZ, who on

one occasion had accused the exiled PRIOs ing responsible
for a cache of arms located in Cuba. ANTO TO said that he also
learned through comections in Cuba that the two MIGUEL
_ brothers, upon their arrival. in Havana in the early part of

May, were met at the airport by a man influential with the
BATISTA regime. ANTONIO PRIO said that because of security
reasons, he did not wish to diselesethe identity of this man

who met the MIGUEL brothers because it would place his
informant in jeopardy. ANTONIO saia he also learned that

wy

MM 2-165

neither of the MIGUEL brothers was searched, although it was
undoubtedly common knowledge that they were employed at that
time by CARLOS PRIO. He said the MIGUELs remained in Havana
several.days and almost immediately. following their return
each purchased.a Cadillac. He said neither of these cars

was new and that the price of one was $2,600.00, less an
$800.00 trade-in. He did not know the value of the other car.
ANTONIO said that He possessed no knowledge of any other
unusual expenditures by the MIGUELs.

ANTONIO: PRIO said that when. the MIGUEL brothers
were confronted concerning their trip to:Cuba, FRANK MIGUEL
admitted that almost: immediately after their arrival at the ;
airport in Havana, JOSEPH, MIGUEL’ telephoned the Policé Station.

ANTONIO PRIO said he had also ascertained that
in Miami the MIGUELs had passed around remarks to the éffect

‘that they soon’ expected ‘to bé in a position to do big business

in Cuba or Mexico.

ANTONIO. also. said that he had been informed by a
contact in Miami that the. two MIGUEL brothers had been in
the services of BATISTA for the preceeding ‘three months.
ANTONIO said that. he had. reason to believe’ this report’ accurate,
inasmuch as his source, although representing BATISTA in Miami ¢
in some capacity which ANTONIO did not disclose, had, along
with his family, been previously aided in Cuba by ANTONIO.

ANTONIO stated that on the previous night, June 2,
1953, he had been visited by JOSEPH MIGUEL, who wanted to
know why he and his brother’were let. go. It was then that

“ANTONIO and his brother, FRANCISCO PRIO, told MIGUEL that

inasmuch as the police had been inquiring about the MIGUELs,

- it was felt that they should be dismissed from PRIO's services

and also that they wanted to employ. additional: protection. On
that occasion, upon being questioned,. JOSEPH MIGUEL claimed
that he had gone to Havana in connection with advertising
propaganda which he intended to start in connection with the
El Toledo Restaurant. ANTONIO expressed the opinion, however,
that the amount of business done at the Bl Toledo Restaurant
does not warrant such advertising.

: Miami Informant T-5 reported on May 27, 1953,
that FRANK and JOSEPH ‘MIGUEL arrived in Havana, Cuba, on
May 1, 1953, and returned to Miami via Pan American Airways

NW 64954 Docld:34517419 Page 91


MM 2-165

Flight #496 on May 3, 1953.. He said that. since their return
to Miami, they have twice been to New York City. He was of
the opinion that they had gone there on business for PRIO.

XVI. GENERAL ANSEIMO PAULINO, THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC

Miami Informant T-1 reported on July 6, 1953,
that PRIO was contacted under rather mysterious circuinstances
by an individual who was ascertained to be registered in Room
1107, Columbus Hotel, Miami, T-1 said that PRIO and this :
individual agreed, through intermediaries, to meet each other
near the P.& 0 Docks, Biscayne Boulevard, at about 10:00 PM
that same evenings It appeared that they were anxious not
to be observed in the company of each other. Miami Informant
T-55, of known reliability, reported on July 6, 1953, that
Mr. and Mrs. ANSELMO PAULINO, MAX GOMEZ, #76 Trujilio,
Dominican Republic, were registered in Room 1107 of the
Columbus Hotel. Informant said that this man referred to as
General was once previously in Miami with RAFAEL TRUJILLO,
former President of the Dominican Kepublic, arriving together
by yacht. This occurred approximately one year ago.

It was ascertained by the writer through physical
surveillance that the rendevouz did not take place as
scheduled, Miami Informant T-1 reported later the same: day
that confusion had apparently arisen concerning the place of
the appointment, and he was unable to state whether this
meeting was actually held.

With reference to ANSELMO PAULINO, Miami Informant,
T-56, of unknown reliability, reported on November’ 13, 1952,
that he had been approached in late December, 1951, by :
Dominican Republic Consul, PEDRO BLANDINO, in Miami, ‘to handle
a kidnapping for the Dominicans for a price. T-55 received
$1,000.00 and travel expenses to Ciudad Trujillo, Dominican
Republic, on or about April’6 or 8, 1952, for this purpose.
After arriving in Ciudad Trujillo, he was propositioned by
General ANSELMO PAULINO of TRUJILLO's cabinet to effect the
kidnapping of ‘ENRIQUE HENRIQUEZ (Dominican’ brother-in-law
of CARLOS PRIO), and-by, GURL RAMERIZ, who was then
in Guatemala. He was offéred $35,000.00 but claimed he refused
this proposition.

A. Leading PRIO Associates Located in Miami

Miami Informants T-1, 2,°and 3, and Miami Informants
T-57 and 58, of known reliability, all of whom are well informed
concerning PRIO and his immediate associates, have advised over
a period of time that SEGUNDO CURTI, former Minister of Interior
under the PRIO regime, who resides at 60 S. W. 25th Road, Miami,
appears to be one of PRIO's most trusted and important associates;
that RICARDO ARTIGAS, former Chief of the Cuban lottery under
PRIO, who resides at 727 Hast Dilido Drive, Miami Beach, visits
PRIO almost daily. and appears to be high in his confidence; that
Colonel RAFAEL IZQUIRDO, Military Aid to PRIO, who resides at 2.9
S. W. 23rd Road, Miami, enjoys a very close personal relationship
with PRIO and apparently has his complete confidence; and that
DIEGO VICENTE TEJBRA y RESCALVO, previously mentioned in this
report under Section IX, appears to be one of the key lieutenants
in the PRIO group.

According to these. informants, PRIO's brothers, ANTONIO
and FRANCISCO, do not appear to be too deeply involved, expecially
FRANCISCO, who is presently in California ona pleasure trip,
after having left Miami in early, June, 1953, for New York City.

B, Visitors to the PRIO Group in Miami
Miami Informants T-1, 2, and 3 have reported that among

a constant stream of Cubans who have ‘visited PRIO and his leading

associates during the past few months are the following.

under the PRIO Government, who was in Miami on June 12 and July
5, 1953. ‘

FELIX LANCIS, a medical doctor who was in Miami on June
13, 1953. Miami Informant T-5 has advised that LANCIS served
under the GRAU Government as a Prime Minister; that he is not ‘
especially a good friend of PRIO, but served as a liaison man
between PRIO and GRAU in connection with the Montreal Conference.
He said that LANCIS had planned to run as President on the
Authentic Party ticket last June, but that PRIO had chosen. CARLOS
HEVIA over LANCIS.

Miami around June 18, 1953. .

i CANDIDO de la TORRE, who was one of the victims in the
$240,000 Fort Worth, Texas robbery, who was in Miami dune 23,-and
who again arrived July 30, 1953.

CHINO MIRANDA, who was in Miami around June 30, 1953
and who, according to T-5, is a musician, resides in Havana, Cuba,
and is a close personal friend of CARLOS and FRANCISCO PRIO and
frequently travels between Cuba and Miami. 1-5 said this man is
politically interesting. :

DIEGO MEJIAS, who arrived in Miami on or about July 5,
1953 for a brief trip. It appeared, according to these informants,
that considerable importance was attached to his presence. T-5 .
has stated- that this man is undoubtedly identical to DIEGO SERGIO
MEJIAS who was Minister of Communications during the PRIO regime,
who served as a former Senator in the GRAU administration, and who’
travels back and forth frequently between Miami and Cuba.

i JUAN RIOS MONTEAGRO arrived with his family in Miami iz
from Mexico on August 1, 1953. T-5 has stated that MONTEAGRO is
a very close personal friend of SEGUNDO CURTI, is an aviator, and
appears.to be very active in the PRIO Party. :

: Miami Informants T-1, 2,'3 and 5 above have also
advised during this period that RUBEN GARCIA CHELIN, 2200 S. W.
Second Avenue, appears to enjoy the confidence of PRIO and his
closest associates. T-5 has advised that CHELIN is either the ‘
adopted or illegitimate son of PRIO's father, was raised in
PRIO's house, and resides next door to FRANCISCO PRIO, He
described CHELIN as being a dwarfish sort of individual about
5'2" or 5' 3" tall, with a very large head and about forty years
of age. He said that CHELIN's wife is now obtaining a divorce
from him and he is living with another woman by the name of
JOSEPHINA at his residence.” T-5.said that CHELIN had recently
gone to New York City on a trip with RAFAEL PEREZ, who is wanted

Miami Informants T-1° and 3 have also learned that on
June.22, 1953 an individual subsequently identified as NORMAN
made an appointment to see PRIO at his home under rather :
confidential circumstances. It appeared to thé informant that
PRIO was anxious not to have anybody know that NORMAN was coming
to his home. It was observed on that evening at the time of the
appointment a car bearing Florida license 1W10858 was parked at
the gate to PRIO's residence. This car, according to the Dade
County Motor Vehicle Bureau, is registered to ETHEL ROTHMAN, 425
Surfside Boulevard, for a 1953 Oldsmobile coupe.

Miami Informant T-59, of unknown reliability, who is
well informed concerning gambling activities in the Miami. area,-
advised that NORMAN ROTHMAN lives at 425 Surfside Boulevard,
Miami Beach, while in this area. This informant said that NORMAN
ROTHMAN drives a green Oldsmobile coupe while in Miami. The
informant has stated that NORMAN ROTHMAN is a front for the
MANNARINO gang of New Kensington, Pennsylvania, a well known mafia
organization actively engaged in gambling. enterprises in Cuba and
New Kensington, Pennsylvania. This informant has also stated that
ROTHMAN was at one time manager of the gambling casino at the
Sans Souci Hotel in Cuba.

7 Miami Informant T-1.subsequently ascertained that PRIO
apparently had a very low regard for ROTHMAN, however T-1 was
unable to ascertain the nature of their contact.

GC. RE: CARLOS HEVIA

: Miami Informant T-1 reported. in July, 1953, that CARLOS
HEVIA, who resides at 2475 Brickell Avenue while in Miami, is
présently residing at the Lexington Hotel, New York City. It is
to be recalled that HEVIA had been picked by PRIO to run as
Presidential candidate on the Authentic’ Party ticket for the
June, 1952, presidential elections in’ Cuba. However, this failed
to materialize when: BATISTA executed a coup d'etat March 10, 1952
and consequently cancelled the June, 1952 elections. tee

Miami Informant T-25 learned on August 3, 1953 that PRIO
in commenting on CARLOS HEVIA stated that he had sent HEVIA up
north so that HEVIA could take care of many important business
matters for PRIO in New York. .This informant got the impression
that PRIO was referring to his plans to overthrow BATISTA.
