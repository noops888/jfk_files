reported that fifty-ühree persons were killed and dozens

wounded early sunday (July 20, 1953) when arned rebels

disguised as soldiers failed to seize two Cuban army

garrisons in uprisings against the regime of President

FOLGENCIO BATISiA.

This article disclosed that the main

uprising occurred at santiago de Cuba in Oriente Province

and that a rural guard post in the city of Bayamo, 150 miles

northwest of Santiago was also attacked.

This article stated that BATISTA blamed

the

attack on the followers of deposed President CARLOS PRIO

SOCARRIS, who was ousted by BatIsta in a bloodless coup d'etat

on March

10, 1952. In the same article it was reported that

PRiO denied

this accusation and said that when and if he

should ever direct a revolution against the 3 lIst government,

"he will be leading it in front and would not be at home in

Miami.

Miami Iniormant It, of known reliability, who is

vield informed concerning CarLos PIO, and some of his associ-

aües, Learned on July 20, 1953, that when CARLOS ERIC

received news of the above described uprising he indicated

that it came as a complete surprise to him.

He expressed

curiosity as to the identity of the parties or group behind

this disturbance.

Subsequently on July 26, 27, and 28,

Miami Informant

I-1 and Miami Informants T-2 and 1-3, also

of known reliability, who are well informed concer. ing PRiC

and some of his close associates in Miami, reported that

RICARDO ARTIG.S, former Chief of the Cuban Loitery under PRIO,

and his wife, mason AbBa, and SaGUNDO CURTI, former

Minister of Interior under

PRiO, also were surprised over the

uprising and made vigorous efforts to ascertain who was

behind the uprising.

Miami Infornant I-1 reported on July 28 that Clos

PRIO felt the whole affair of the uprising was

"crazyi?.

He

gave a statement to the press on the same date to the

effect

that BiTISTA is protecting the Communists internally although

blaming them externally for the uprising. PRIO described

FIDEL CASTRO, Leader of the revolt,

as a we known enemy

ef Communism, and said that many of those who were killed

by BATISTA's men came from distinguished Cuban fanilies.

PRIO also took this opportunity, according to the

informant, to point out that when he, PRIO, became President

of Cuba he closed down the Communist newspaper

that it was re-opened by BATISTA,

oI communists in Cuba has increased from 20,000 to 150,000

during BATISTA's present regime.

He claimed BATISTA is facing

a bad economic depression, and that if he,

PRIO, were back

in Cuba, he would immediately arrange for free elections so

that the

people could

Plact a constitutional President.

An article entitled "Dictator Batista Slaps

Martial Law Over Cuba", which appeared in the July 28, 1953

issue of the Miami Herald by the Associated Press with a

Havana dateline,

reported that BATISTA slapped martial law

over Cuba July

26, 1953, after crushing an attack by some

230 armed rebels on two

Army posts.

Miani radio broadcasts disdosed on the evening of

July 29, 1953 that Cuban planes had strafed two boats, the

"Benson"

and the "Babe"' of Liberian and Honduran registry

respectively, elthough imerican operated, which resulted

in the wounding of two British subjects and one Honduran.

I-1 reported on the evening of July 24,

that PRIO received news of this incident with disbelief.

after the news was confirmed, PRIO remarked that the incident

should certainly be of interestto imerican authorities.

RICARDO ARTIGS, according to I-2, expressed the opinion

that the "BATIST. people must be crazy".

On July 27, 1953, Miami Informant I-4 of known

reliability advised that LUIS GUSI.VO FERNNDEZ, personal

secretary to CARLOS PRIO disclosed that the Cuban uprising

was not caused by lour people", but that it arose because

of student action.

Miami Informant I-5, of known reliab lity, reported

on July 29, 1953, that information emanating from the Cuban

Military Intelligence Service reflects that the uprising was

caused by menbers of the Orthodox Party of which FIDEL CASTRO!

the revolt leader, is a member, with the assistance of the

Communist Party, and that the uprising was not sanctioned

by. PRIO and members of his iutentico Parti. This informant

said that PRIO had planned action with the assistance of the

Orthodox Party, this action to take place following the

eLection of Josh FIGuRes,

"Presidential Candidate in Costa

Rica, who had promised PRIO aid and assistance in the event

he were elected. Informant pointed out that FIGURES, according

to the newspapers, was elected President of Costa Rica on

July 28, 1953.

Miami Informants I-1, 2, and 3 learned

that a

number of sutentico Parti members

such as iNTONIO VARONO,

LOMBERTO DIAZ, and DIEGO EJIAS have been released by Cuban

authorities following their arrest.

These same informants

advised that no information came to their attention showing move-

of PRIO followers from Miami to Cuba prior to this

uprising, and that they had received no other evidence

indicating that PRIO was in any way responsible for the

uprising.

Miami Informant T-1 learned on July 30 that CARLOS

PRIO reported to GUILLERNO ALONSO PUJOL, Who was Vice-

President of Cuba during the Presidency

Of PRIO, that most

of the participants in this uprising were students led by

FIDEL CASTRO, and that inost of these were menbers of the

Orthodox Party, and that most of "our friends" were also

arrested.

Among these he named were ROBERTO GRAMONTE and

E Into oCHOnY OCHOA, both members of the Orthodox Party,

and that a complaint had been filed by the Cuban Government

against PRiO.

PRIO also related the machine-gunning of

two people by the Cuban Government.

When asked by PuJOL

if PRIO were still optimistic after all this, PRIO replied

in the affirmative, stating the Cuban people

could just not

wait. He also disclosed that all this that has occurred in

Cuba had not hurt his cause one bit.

I-2 reported on July 30, 1953, that one of PRIo's

followers, Commandant ZORILLS, who has recently arrived in

Miami, disclosed he had just had an interview with LUIS

According

to this information furnished by

where the bodies were thrown so as to indicate they had been

considered ORTEGA a very strange individual, but did not

question his reliability.

He said there were 400. dead now

in cuba as a result of this uprising.

the Miami herald on hugust 2, 1953, carried ar

article entitled "Prio Classes Batista

with Red Chiefs"

wherein it was stated CARLOS PRIO charged that the strafing

of two banana boats by Cuban war planes put Batista on the

same level with Russia's masters.

This article, in part, quoted PRIO as follows:

"'That brutal and inhuman action ordered by the dictator

of Cuba is typical of the disregard which dictators

feel toward internat onal rights and the unwritten laws

which guide

the actions of democratic governments and

free peoples.

"'Thataction, which is along the same line as the

shooting down of unarmed merican and British transports

by soviet planes, shows the unity of procedures used

by. dictatorships - whether it bethe system ruling Cuba,

or the system which pretends

to impose itself on the

civilized world from

Moscow.'

" The imerican people, he said, received a 'rude reminder

of the dictators' disregard of

human principles and

comnon decency' this week when an American B-50 bomber

was shot down over the sea of Japan by Russian fighters.

"Prio charged further that reports 'filtering' out of

Cuba indicate that Batista has unleashed a wave of

terror.!"

I had nothing, absolutely nothing, to do with

that uprising. Theplans of FIDEL CASTRO were crazy.

What did he

accomplish by taking of MONCADA's Armory when

in one hour's time he would have over his head all of

BATISTA's air force?

further, FIDEL CASTRO was so stupid

as to have some messages already printed and signed by

him as 'President in Arms' of the Republic of Cuba.

is no sense in all this unfortunate episode at Santiago

ie cuba, but to give opportunity to BATISTA to make a

same time only

a mentally unbalanced individual could lead 150 young men

into a sure massacre.

Fidel never had over 25 or 40 rifles.

The rest of his followers went into the fight armed only

with machetes and knives although they were promised rifles

before reaching the Moncada Armory.

These rifles never

reached their hands. No one in our organized revolutionary

movement against BATISTA had anything to do with FIDEL."

II. INCIDENTS INVOLVING CUBANS IN MIAMI

1. Leaflets Distributed By Cuban Liberty Action:

The May 20, 1953, issue of the Miami Herald

carried an article entitled "Anti-Batista Plans Carried

to Cubans Here".

This article disclosed that leaflets

signed by the Cuban Liberty action (Miami Branch) were

distributed in Miami denouncing Cuban President BATISTA

on the occasion of a ceremony scheduled in Miani to honor

Cuban Patriot JOSE M.RTI.

Two Cuban officials, Dr. RAFAEL

L. DIAZ - BLART, Cuban Under-Secretary of Interior, and

DI. HIPOLITO VAlELla; head of theCuban Iourist Bureau,

came to Miami to present a bust of MARTI to the University

of Miami.

The leaflets above described claim that these

men did not represent the Cuban

people, but that "in

reality, they represent the anti-Democratic government

of Dictator

FULGENCIO BATISTA."

He was denounced as a

"pro-Communist and anti-Democratic dictator, a thief of

the public treasury Like PERON in argentina, MaLENkOF in

ruSSIa, TRUJILLO in Dominican Republic. The leaflets

concluded, "Our brothers died in korea for the liberty of

the world. Do not become an accomplice of the friends

of these assassins. Join our consignee:

freedom for the

Cuban people."

This article disclosed that VIDAL MORALES

of Miami, described as a leader in the distribution of

these leaflets, said they were put out by the Miami Branch

of the" Cuban Liberty Action"

• a group recently organized

in Cuba to oppose BATISTi.

The leaflets were printed ir

both Spanish and English.

On May 21,

1953, T-5 reported that VIDAl, MORALES

served in the United St-tes

army during world war II

and had been living in Miami on 39th Avenue between First

He also reported that RUED. received a jail

sentence for dealing in contraband during the PRIO regime.

He said RUEDa has no obvious source of income and yet

reportedly possessed money.

Miami Informant I-6, of known reliability,

reportea on May 24, 1953, that VIDaL MORALEs is a member

of the Union Insurrectional Revolutionary of Cuba, this

being a revolutionary group of gangsters which was

abolished by BATISTA.

Both T-5 and I-6 expressed the opinion that the

cuban Liberty action was planned by VIDAL MORALES, ALVAREZ

RUEDa and perhaps others for this specific purpose, and

was not actually an organization as such.

Neither

T-5 nor T-6 had ever heard of this organization before.

the Miami Of sun roderive gardee

• On cune 3, 1153, Mr. ANIONIO PRIO, who called at

to another matter, was shown

one of the above described leaflets. ANTONIO PRIO, who is

the brother of CARLOS PRIO stated he did not know VIDAL

MOR LES, and that OR LES had no connection whatsoever

with CARLOS PRIO or members of his party, and that the

incident was undoubtedly inspired by Cuban students in

Miami who are opposed to BITISTA.

ANTONIO PRIO said he

possessed no knowledge of the existence of any organization

known as the Cuban Liberty iction.

Be Assault of Cuban Army Officer in Miami, July 6, 1953:

On July 13, 1953, Miami Informant I-5 reported

that on July 6, 1953,

army, who was then in Miami en route to Jacksonville, Florida,

to engage in a competitive pistol match along with other

meinbers of his team, was assaulted at Walgreen's Drug Store,

Flagler Street and Southeast Second avenue, by CESAR VEGi

whom

the informant described as being a Cuban ruffian who

is associated with the PRIO group in Miami.

I-5 said that

VEGA was wearing brass knucks when he struck Major DIOT.

The informant said that CESAR. VEG. is closely

associated with RUBEN ACOSIr, a Cuban attorney, VIDai

MORALES, above described, and one BraNco, all of whom he

said are members of the PRiO group.

The informant said he had also learned that VeGA,

#COSTA, and other Cubans also went to the room of another

Cuban at the hotel. Belforte, and started to assault this

Cuban but were forced

to leave hurridly when help approached.

Miami Informant I-1 learned on July 6, 1953, that

CARLOS PRIO arranged to contact one of the Cuban Military

officers in the same group going to Jacksonville he waming

the above described incident.

PRiO advised that

C. Cuban Day Celebration, July 11, 1953:

The July 12, 1953, issue of the Miami Daily News

carried an article entitled

"Cuban Consul Trades Punches

Heckler". This

article reflected that EDUARDO HERN NDEZ,

Cuban Consul at Miami and an unidentified heckler engaged

brief fist fight following Cuban Day celebrations

which were held in Bayiront Park, Miami, on July 11, 1953,

in honor of JOSE M..RTI, Cuban Patriot.

This article

disclosed the proceedings were interrupted by a heckler

who shouted, "Viva Cuba - without Batista. Down with

dictatorship."

Miami Informant I-6 reported on July 15, 1953,

that the fisticuffs between Consul HERNANDEZ and his

assailant took place in the Minerva Restaurant located

about two blocks from

Bayfront Park, following the

ceremonies in the park.

T-6 said that HERNANDEZ' assailant,

identified as CESAR VEG., struck HERNANDEZ after HERNANDEZ

pointed out to VEGA that

although they had personal

differences about politics, they should attempt to observe

civil law in Miami.

T-6 said that actually forty to fifty

punches were exchanged by VEG. and HERNANDEZ.

T-6 expressed the opinion that he felt that this

incident along with others mentioned above were part of an

"organized deal" to embarrass the B.TISTA Government.

On July 28, T-6 reported that an unidentified

man speaking Spanish

telephonically contacted an employee

of the Cuban

Consulate in Miami,

and stated he was going

to wreck the Consulate and attack the Consul.

T-6 also

learned that two or three Cubans had been asking questions

of consulate employees

the preceding day while they were

waiting for an elevator on the ground floor of the

Consulate building.

At the same time, according to I-6,

the Cuban Consul received a report to the effect that several

Cubans wore overheard talking in the Paula Restaurant at

Miami.

According to T-6, the Miami

Police Department had placed police guards

around the

consulate.

The July 28, 1953, issue of the Miami Daily News

carra an article entitled,

"Tension High Here Over Cuban

revolt" by MILI SOSIN, Miami Daily News Staff Writer.

article reirected that tension mounted in Miami's Cuban

colony as some Havana newspapers arrived in Miami showing

the evidence of considerable suppression and heavy censor-

ship as an aftermath of an uprising against BATISTA.

Inis article disclosed that the United States

Department.of

received by the Cuban Consul, and that as a result a 24

hour police guard wes placed

E. ittempt to Picket the Cuban Consulate:

Detective Lieutenant C. W. PRICE, Miami Police

Department, reported on July 28, 1953, that on the preceding

day a group of three

men come to the police department

and asked for a permit to picket the Cuban Consulate.

When

asked the purpose of the picketing they replied this was

their only method of protesting the present systen of

Government in Cuba, and to let the merican people know

their views, and that all Cubans do not approve.

At that

time they were told no permit was required

so long as no

disorder resulted in which

immediately token. These men pledged that nothing but

peaceful action was planned...

Mr. PRICE said that later, however, the United

States Department of State,

according to a newspaper article,

contacted Chief of Police WALTER E. HEADLEY at his home,

and Chief HE DLEY ordered that no picketing would be

permitted in view of the reported

threats alleged to have

been received by the Cuban Consul.

Detective Lieutenant PRICE said that on the

further information.

They appeared cooperative, and

sincere. Lt. PRICE informed them that orders had been

issued prohibiting the picketing of the Cuban Consul as

not being in the best interests of the United states, and

that a violation of this order would result in arrests

being made. Lt. PRICE said that these people did not appear

to be ofiended or chagrined at the decision, and readily

agreed to abide by it.

Also, they exhibited no intention

to take Court action to determine their entitlement to

picket.

One of the picketers, GILBERTO DELG.DO, left

a sample of the handbill which they had planned to distribute

to the public while picketing: This handbill, which is being

retained in the files ofthe Miami Office, reads as follows:

"TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE: Cuba, under Batista's

dictatorship, is now living the terror of its full

impact.

The

Dictator is interested only in repressing

the efforts the Cuban people are making to restore

our Constitution and our rights; and as a regime of force,

their methods of necessity include the lash, the

machine gun, the black jack, torture and beatings.

This bloody rule is disguised as a 'Benevolent

Dictatorship'.

Many people have been killed, including

yesterday's 52, as the result of the fight against

Batista's tyrany. Batista is döuble-crossing the

United States by dealing with Communist

and keeping

RIERA planned to have six picketers carrying

signs condemning the Batista Government as being a pro-

PRIO was then in Mexico, presumably for the purpose of organizing

certain phases of the action planned by the PRIO group.

The April 30, 1953, issue of the Miami Herald carried

an article entitled "Cuban Invasion Force Masses,

Paper Reports, "

bearing an Associated Press, Mexico City date line. This

article reported that the newspeper Ultimas Noticias disclosed

that three hundred mercenaries were gathered on a remote coast

and Costa Ricans who had been recruited by the opponents of

BATISTA.

It was stated that this force planned to use small

sailing boats to leave the Cuban coast and to seize a small

town for the center of an armed revolt. The report disclosed

that friends of CARLOS PRIO financed the movement. The article

also stated that there was no confirmation of this report

from any quarter there.

The May 1, 1953, issue of the Miami Herald carried an

article entitled "PIO denies any plan of Invasion.

In this

article PRIO stated that the above-described article was

"absolutely lacking in veracity" and attributed it to propaganda

from any

direction.

This article said that PRIO had arrived the pre-

ceeding Monday from Mexico City and planned to return there

soon.

the PRIO group has as

many armed men in Cuba as have the BATISTA people.

On lay 12, 1953, I-5 reported having received infor-

mation emanating from the Cuban Intelligence Service that

PRIO was planning an uprising against BATISIA on or about

May 19 or 20, 1953.

Miami Informant I-12, of known reliability, being

a federal Agency engaged in investigative work, reported on

May 22, 1953s that CARLOS PRIO, AURGLIANO SANCHEZ ARANGO

former

Minister of Education and State under PRIO, DUPOMIC

FERNANDEZ; orthodox" delegates who are followers of ExILIO

OCHOA, delegates of the Federacion and studiantal Universitaria,

and others met in Mexico early in

April; 1953, to discuss

SANCHEZ ARANGO's plans for an armed attack against the forces

of BATISTA in Cuba.

It was stated that the failure of the

plan to bribe certain high officials in the BATISTA Government

left no alternative but lorce.

It was stated that large

quantities of arms were reportedly already available in Cuba

for attacks planned

on Campo Columbia,

the Cubana Fortress,

police stations and naval stations in

Havana.

The time for

this attack was not set according to information received by

I-12,

but it was agreed by those persons that it would be wise

to wait until such time as the economic situation of the country

should become more critical or until some unexpected event

should occur which would permit an auspicious opportunity for

implementation of the plan. (u)

Miami Informant I-13, of known reliability, being

an official employed by I-12, reported having just received

information from a source considered reliable that an alert

had been issued to opposition groups in Havana to be prepared

Miami Informant T-14, of known reliability, and

who is acquainted with many Cubans in Miami, reported on June

9, 1953; that he had received information from a friend who

visited the home of FRANCISCO PRIO, who had disclosed that

the PRIO group has everything they need by way of equipment

and

are now ready to start operations.

The exact time was

not disclosed.

Miami Informant I-15 reported on May 29, 1953, that

former Senator PELAYO CUERVO NAVARRO, apparently a sympathizer

with the EMILIO OCHOA faction of the

• Orthodox arty, which

seemed to be implicated in revolt plans with PRIO's Authentic

Party, appeared on a

"Meet the Press" program televised over

During a question and

stated six times that he

believed violence would be justified in the event a peaceful

solution could not be found for Cuba's political problems.

He insisted that there is an "attitude of rebellion among

people and he said "As soon as there is a propitious situation,

I am sure that the Cuban people will fulfil their duty as has

always happened." Another theme to which he returned several

times was that the army was sensitive to the will of the people

and knowing that the "moment is drawing near when the voice

of the people is going to rule."

T-15 said that PELAYO was

arrested by the Cuban Intelligence Service as he left the

broadcasting station but was later released although it was

reported that criminal charges would be brought against him for

defamation.

Miami Informant I-16, who is believed to be reliable,

but who represents the BATISIA Government, reported on June 10,

1953, that a meeting of the Orthodox Party of Cuba was held

at the whitehall hotel, New York City, on the evening of June 8,

1953•

Among those present as speakers were MARINO SUAREL,

EMILIO OCHOA and

PARDO LLADA. Also present

If this demand were not met the Government of BATISTA would

be overthrown by force.

The informant said that all the speakers

urged those in attendance to be ready to shed their blood for

This statement brought enthusiastic applause from the

audience.

Among those

present was

JOSE DUARTE, who sat at

the speakers' table and

was introduced as a Cuban hero.

Informant said that he was convinced that within the next month

or six weeks, an attempt would be made by the supporters of

CARLOS FRIO to overthrow the BATISTA Regime in Cuba by force.

Miami Informant I-l reported on June 15, 1953, that

ALONSO PUJOL, former Vice President under PRIO, told

PRIO that SERGIO CARBO, publisher of Prensa Libra Havana,

with whom PUJOI, had apparently had a serious discussion, was

on the side of PRIO, but that CARBO felt horror at the

thought

of what might happen as a result of the warlike situation which

Cuba was facing.

Miami Informant T-5 reported on July 13, 1953, that

RUBEN GARCIA CHELIN, a

close relative and associate of CARLOS

PRIO, who is residing in Miami, had warned an acquaintance

against going to Cuba at that time, insinuating that a revolution

might occur in the very near future.

The July 27, 1953 issue of the Miami Herald carried

an article entitled "PRIO Denies any Tie

With Cuban revolt,"

wherein iRld was questioned as to whether he had had anything

to do with the uprising of July 24, 1953. On that occasion

"I know nothing about this revolt,

There will be revolts

as long as BATISTA continues to hold the power in Cuba which

the people did not give to him.

"I have said before the people of Cuba will never

tolerate a dictatorship. For that

reason we may see at any

time an uprising of the

people and the army itself against

BATISTA.

"I don't know anything about the revolt today, but

On July 31, 1953, Miami Informant I-17, of known

reliability, scated

that it is being reported around Miami

that the wife of FULGENCIO BATISTA,

head of the Cuban Govern-

ment, has

just gone to ungland with a large amount of money.

T-17

said

that he interpreted this report, if true, as meaning

that BATISTA mey be making arrangements for flight

from Cuba.

Miami Informant T-l learned

on August 3, 1953,

that PRIO, when called upon to evaluate a pian of action

which was not fully described to the informant, stated that the

i de that the

plan was absolutely impossible, that everything which referred

to Cuba

at the present time is impossible, that what had been

planned is impossible

because of circumstances which now exist

in Cuba as a result of the uprising of July 24, 1953. PRIO

pointed

out that two American controlled boats were fired upon,

that everybody is stopped, houses searched, that all leaders of

the party are prisoners, that airplanes and

coast guardsmen

are patrolling the island, and that the situation is in a

state of panic.

It appeared to the informant that PRIO. felt that

because of these circumstances, it would be necessary to re-.

adjust

and revise the plan which had been previously greed

upon.

Miami Informant I-25 learned on August 3, 1953, that

CARLOS PRIO disclosed that his group is definitely planning

to overthrow BATISTA and that "the revolution will constitute

a double celebration in the history of Cuba. As I have told

you, this revolution will not just be a coup to take BATISTA

out

si the presidential palace.

responsible for many killings.

Nois just an asgassin end

BATISTA is directly

assassins pay for their

sins with their lives. BATISTA will

pay for his crimes with his

own life."

The informant got the impression that perhaps

PRIO intended that his plans should take effect on a Cuban

holiday within the near future so that on that date the Cuban

people could enjoy a double celebration.

He pointed out

:that the next major Cuban holiday is October 10, 1953.

in describing the Montreal Conference

stated,

"What we agreed

in Montreal

was in reference to a

'master plan' to liquidate

BATISTA's regime.

We did not agree to any political alliance,

as each party will maintain his automony and freedom of action

in the political field as soon as we dispose of BATISTA's

machinery in Cuba. A provisional government will be installed

in the Government at the time with me at its head for the

balange of the time BATISTA took away from me and presidential

elections will be held immediately afterwards with full

guarantees to all.

We just want to continue the national march

of democracy which has been interrupted by BATISTA's gangsterism."

IX. ARMS SHIPMENTS ALLEGEDLY INVOLVING THE

MARB, THE "CRISTOBAL CARRIERT AND "ANCON

TRADER. "

On May 21, 1953, Miami Informant I-5 reported

having received information emanated from the Cuban Military

Intelligence Service to the effect that persons representing

CARLOS PRIO were believed to have purchased. 400 rubber boats.

from a Miami veterans' surplus store located' on Biscayne

Boulevard in Miami at 12th Street Northeast; that

these boats

were in boxes in storage with the Withers Storage Company

and were to be delivered, or may already have been delivered,

to an address in Mexico..

T-5 said that the Cuban Military

Intelligence Service received this information from a person

in the Cuban Navy who in turn received it from a Cuban who

is employed by the surplus store in Miami.

On May 21, Mr. A. KRAVITZ and W. A. WEINTRAUB,

owners of Surplus Outlet, Inc., wholesalers and retailers

12L5 Discayne

rubber boats within recent months and that in all probability

it would be impossible to purchase 400 rubber boats in all

of south Florida inasmuch as there is but small demand for

boats of rafts of this type and that customarily retailers

and wholesalers do not stock up on this item.

Their store manager, AURILO MUZARIETA, who said

that he is an American citizen born in Cuba, reported that

several weeks previous DIEGO VICENTE TEJERA, whom he described

as being former Minister of Education under

and who claimed to own a boat or yacht, came into the veterar

surplus Store and purchased two automatically inflated rubber

rafts at $95. each.

A sample of one of these rafts was pointed

out and it is observed that it is of the type formerly used

by the U. S: Navy Airforce for emergency landings and is

automatically inflated by means of an oxygen cartridge.

It

appeared to be capable of carrying ten or twelve men.

Mr.•

KRAVITS and Mr. WEINTRAUB said that the few sales they make

of this item are usually to yacht owners or operators of

public and private swimming pools.

It was also stated,

according to 1-20, that PRo

has employed

a former United States Army colonel named

SKOLOSKI, whose job is to recruit war veterans to form an

army to invade Cuba; that SKOLOSKI has disappeared from

Miami and is believed in Mexico; that he is offering recruits

$25. a day and expenses and an insurance policy.

It was stated

that it was not known how many veterans he has recruited,

but that a great many veterans had been recently inquiring

in Miami for SKOLOSKI.

T-26 said that the Cuban Foreign Minister also

advised that two boats 158 feet long called the CRISTOBAL

CARRIER and the ANCON TRADER had been acquired from the

Panama Cabotage Agency; this purchase having been made by

SEGUNDO CURTI, who was

PRIO's Minister of the Interior.

These boats were described as former Naval vessels, aluminum

with black bottom..

According to I-26, it was also stated that inter-

views between PRIO and his people concerning these matters

are held in the hotel Royal York, 5875 Collins Avenue, Miami

Beach.

On June 2, 1953, Mr. E. T. LUCAS, room clerk,

lotel Hoyal lork, reported that there are no Cubans

registered at that hotel and that no meetings of Cubans

have been held there to the best of his knowledge.

Miami Informant I-5 reported on June 2, 1953, that

he had received no information indicating that Colonel

SKOLSKIhas been recruiting in Miami or elsewhere on behalf

PRIO, along with others, was on the "Bonito" and was traveling

under an assumed name when this boat landed at the port ol

New Orleans during the early part of 1953 after having been

towed there by another vessel. T-5 said that DIEGO drives

a Cadillac automobile bearing Cuban license 168519.

Miami Informant I-26, of known reliability, being

Shipbuilding Corporation was the type of repairing and

overhauling which was ordinarily done on vessels of that type

which had been out of commission for a long time.

He said

that both the boats were properly equipped to engage in the

transportation of bananas out that neither was reirigerated

inasmuch as refrigeration equipment was not required in the

banana trade.

He said that neither vessel possessed

any guns

or other armament and he had no reason to believe that either

vessel was to be used for anything other than banana trade.

This informant said that the Miami Shipbuilding

Corporation is also building a metal barge which will be

propelled by two airplane engines with airplane propellers

in the rear. He explained that some months ago MC ChORY came

to the Miami Shipbuilding Corporation with plans drawn up by

30B HOBBS, a Miami boat designer

for the construction of a

special barge to be used by the Estrella Fruit Company ir

connection with the operation of its ¿cuadorian business.

Nic crons explained that some of the banana plantations which

are located in the interior of Ecuador can not be reached

by vessels going upstream because of the shallow swift

currents. It had been the practice of the Estrella Fruit

Company to fly rubber boats by plane to these plantations

so that the bananas could be floated downstream on board

According to MC ChORY the barge now under

construction by the Miami Shipbuilding Corporation will be

used to transport these rubber boats upstream to the

plantations, the barge being constructed for operation in

swift shallow streams.

T-36 said he had learned that MC CRORY

had originally intended to ship this barge to Ecuador on either

: the CRISTOBAL CARRIER or the ANCON TRADER but had been unable

to obtain an export license because of some legal technicality.

T-36 said that BuRT BRICKSON is an old-time ship

captain who is freouently employed by MC CRORY to transport

yachts and other crafts which he has sold to their purchasers.

T-36 said he possessed no evidence that either

MC CRORY Or ERICKSON were engaged in any illegal activity.

Customs July 18, 1953.

I-37 said that during the preceeding

week ATKINSON

presented

a declaration to Customs to export a

barge and motors

but that this declaration was rejected because he possessed

no

State Department export license.

T-37 said that HENRY M. WATKINS resides at 1036 S. W.

On July 22, 1953, Miami Informant I-37 advised that

all three of the above described vessels were still in port

and that kikiNsoN had advised U. S. Customs that the delay

in their departure was due to refrigeration trouble. It is

to be noted, however, that Miami Informant 1-36 pointed out

that neither ühe ANCoN Iravat nor the CrISTOsAL CARdion are

equipped with refrigeration equipment. T-37 said that Customs

agents searched the CRISTOBAL CARRIER

and the ANCON TRADER,

July 20, 1953, with negative results.

at about 4:00: M. on July 24, 1953, that the ANCON

and the CRISTOBAL CARRIOR had cast anchor and were being

towed down the Miami River toward the open sea.

He said that

the ARB, which had been docked adjacent to the

ANCON TRADER,

was

scheduled to leave Miami at about 6:30 P.M.

This irformant

said he had observed no suspicious activity around any of

these boats and that the only material which appeared to have

been loaded on any of them seemed to be food supplies.

• Miami Informant I-34 reported

on July 26, 1953 that

the ARB was searched shortly before it cast off on

the late

afternoon or early evening of July 24, 1953 and that it

contained nothing of a suspicious nature on board.

He said

that the two rear fuel tanks were empty but that the two

side tanks were apparently filled. There were only two men

on boara and one,

that the Arb had completely disappeared following its departure

from the

ATKINSON, the agent for all three

On July 30, 1953, T-34 advised that the "ARB" had

arrived at the Port of Key West, Florida on the preceding

Sunday, July 26, 1953, with four men on board.

T-34 advised

it had been ascertained through an Informant that one of

these men

on board had been addressed as TOM, and answered

the general description of THOMAS J. MCCRORY.

On August 3, 1953, I-39, reported that the "ARB"

was

still in Key West and that McCRORY had been observed to

visit this boat for approximately one hour on August 2, 1953.

On August 4, 1953, Miami Informant I-40, of known

reliability, being an

official of a Federal Agency which con-

ducts investigations; reported that the "ARB"

was still at

Key West, Florida, and that the Master of that boat, JOHN

MANNION, had disclosed that he had intended to depart at mia-

night for Belizes, Honduras.

It is to be noted from the above-described infor-

mation, that the "ARB" departed from Miami on July 24, 1953,

with two men on board, at which time it was destined to

Cristobal, Panama Canal Zone, and that it arrived two days

later at Key West with four

men on board; that as of August

4, 1953, it was prepared to depart for the Port of Belize rather

than the Panama Canal Zone. It is also to be noted that this

boat did not travel in convoy with the "Cristobal Carrier"

and the "Ancon Trader"

as was originally planned.

On August 6, 1953, T-40 advised that the U.S. Cus-

toms Service had placed a $1,000.00 penalty against the

and that this boat cannot depart from the Port of Key West

until this sum is paid or until bond is posted. Informant ex-

plained that this penalty was based upon the fact that U. s.

Customs in Miami had granted clearance to the "ARB" on July 18,

1953, and that this boat did not depart within the forty-eight

hour

period or obtain an extension as required under the law;

and that, further, the "ARB"

arriving at Key West (which

was not its announced port of destination)

did not report to

Customs within a twenty-four hour limit and did not report

within the forty-eight hour period..

With further reference to the above-described boats,

on July 31, 1953, Mr. GUSTAV PETERSON of the Estrella Fruit

Company, New Orleans, advised that the "Cristobal Carrier"

"Ancon Trader" were purchased from the Condenser Service

i too set go one onl

and Engineering Company by the Agencias De Cabotaje, S. A.,

a Panamanian Corporation, the Estrella Fruit Shipping Company

acting solely as Disbursing Agent in the deal.

Estrella is

the sole agent in the United States for Compania De Astral,

S.A., of Panama, whose foreign representative, FOLKE ANDERSON,

instructed PETTERSON in this matter:

PETTERSON advised the only connection he knows

of

between ASTRAL and CABOTAJE is that they are routine business

friends and he is confident that FOLKE ANDERSON is not di-

rectly connected with CABOTAJE.

The air rescue boat, the "ARB"

has been owned by ESTRELLA since July 30, 1951, and was ac-

quired at the request of ANDERSON, who wanted

the use of it

l'or pleasure when in Miami, Florida, and who has used it for

that purpose. He advised that the

"ARB" has been loaned to

ASTRAL.

According to PETTERSON, as he understands it, the

"ARB" together with the

"ANCON TRADER" and the "CRISTOBAL CARRIER,"

left Miami July 24, 1953, and should reach the Panama Canal July

He understands that CABOTAJE still owns the LOI's.

The destination of all three vessels is Emeraldas, Ecuador,

where the LCI's will

be used for coastwise hauling of bananas

and the "ARB" will serve ASTRAL as a utility vessel.

PETTERSON advised he first met THOMAS J. McCRORY

in Miami in late August, 1952.

ANDERSON

had apparently

known McCRORY before. PETTERSON's first business dealing

with McCRORY was in the purchase of

• the LCI's in February,

1953. Since that time, McCRORY has been the ship Agent for

three vessels with virtually unlimited authority in re-

spect to maintenance, equipping, crewing and arranging their

departure.

other than the individual mentioned by. McCRORY

He said he did

not know the person named by McCRORY nor did he know PRIO or

any of PRIo's close associates. .

He advised that HENRY M.

WATKINS and BURT ERICKSON were unknown to him.

On August 3, 1953, Mr. PETTERSON advised he had re-

ceived information from the

Continental shipping Corporation

of the Panama Canal Zone, that the "Cristobal" Carrier and the

"Ancon Trader" had arrived at Cristobal in the Panama Canal

45 Calibre Thompson sub-machine guns

10,000 rounds of M-l cartridges

2000 rounds of 45 calibre cartridges

ACTIVITIES OF AURELIANO SANCHEZ ARANGO

Miami informant T-42, of known- reliability, reported in June

1953 that one GUILLERMO FUENTES GONZALEZ traveling on a Mexican passport

issued at Mexico City in February 1953 was expected to arrive in Kings-

ton; Jamaica, by air on May 21, 1953, and was believed to have in his

possession arms and marked maps of Cuba, and to be a person connected

with anti-Batista activities.: According to T-4?,

this man was located

at the Myrtle Bank Hotel in Kingston.

It was confidentially ascertained

that he had in his possession a Mauser and a Spanish revolver and approxi-

mately ninety rounds of anmunition.

On the basis of this information,

FUENTES was arrested on the morning of May 22, 1953, on a charge of

Illegal importation of arms into the British Colony of Jamaica.

After

hearing before a local magistrate in Jamaica, he was remanded in custody

and placed in the local jail.

After this his remaining effects were

examined by the authorities in Jamaica, at which time a large number of

papers and a series of maps of the island of Cuba and City of Havana

were found.

SANCHEZ ARANGO was discovered. A statement was taken from this man, at

which time he admitted that his true identity was that of SANCHEZ ARANGO

and that he was the former Foreign Minister of Cuba in the government of

CARLOS PRIO, who was overthrown by BATISTA.

SANCHEZ ARANGO also stated, according to T-42, that he was in

charge of the underground movement dedicated to the overthrow of BATISTA,

but that he regrettod very much his indiscretion in bringing arms to

Jamaica.

He advised that he had no intent to use the arms or to conspire

in revolution in Jamaica, but was enroute to Haiti. He also claimed that

he was a close friend of British Foreign Minister ANTHONY EDEN.

I-42 said that no detailed inquiry was made in regard to his

intended revolutionary activities.

It was ascertained from SANCHEZ ARANGO, however, that he was

enroute to Haiti for the purpose of making a contact in Port-Au-Prince.

tion.

He also denied that he had ever been to Ciudad Trujillo, but exami-

lation of his Mexican passport reflected he had been there in April 1953 or

that someone using the identical passport had been there

Embassy in Mexico information to the effect that SANCHEZ ARANGO possesses

two passports issued in names other than his own - GUILTERMO FUENTES

six persons, one of whom was identical with the photograph of RAUL RODRI-

GUEZ y SANTOS.

This informant stated that the following persons are known con-

tacts of SANCHEZ ARANGO:

RICARDO ARTIGAS No. 5-5447, Dalido Island, Miami Beach,

Florida.

LUIS G. FERNANDEZ, 2320 Tyger (Tyler??) Peck (?), Miami,

Florida.

MURIFI LEDERER, 5644 Netherlands Avenue, Riverdale 71,

that

same day.

T-I gathered the impression that considerable importance

was attached to this rendezvous, it being noted that it is generally cus-

tomary for a Chief of State to receive callers at his home or office.

Special Agent MELVIN A. THOMPSON and the writer ascertained by physical

surveillance that this meeting took place at 10:25 AM on July 24, 1953,

It was observed that PRIQ was driven to

this rendezvous by SEGUNDO CURTI, former Minister of Interior under PRIO,

and that immediately upon arrival in the parking area of this restaurant

PRIO, carrying a briefcase, got into another car bearing Florida license

lE 3112, and drove off with the two occupants of this car, followed by

CURTI at a discreet distance. At 11:00 AM PRIO and CURTI, in the latter's

automobile, left Key Biscayne followed by the other car.

It was observed

by the writer that one of these men, not the driver, bore a striking resem-

blance to a photograph of AURELIANO SANCHEZ ARANGO.

It was noted, however,

that this person was clean shaven, although the latter's photograph possessed

by the Miami Office reflects that he has a mustache.

It appeared that occu-

pants of the two automobiles were exercising caution to determine if they

were under surveillance.

Consequently, the surveillance was dropped as both

cars left Key. Biscayne.

With regard to the car bearing license

• 1E 3112, Florida, Mrs.

MAE DAY of Curry U-Drive-It Company, Miami Beach, reported on July 16, 1953,

that this car, owned by the Curry U-Drive-It Company, was rented on June 27,

1953, to JOSE VEGA, Miami address c/o Gateway Hotel, Miami Springs, home

address 19 Evergreen Avenue, Lynbrook, New York, and possessor of New York

operator's license 561-0705. Mrs. DAY said that VEGA had previously rented

this automobile from May 11, 1953, to June 23, 1953.

The writer observed during the above described surveillance, how

ever, that the driver of this car is not identical to the JOSE VEGA who is

registered at the Miami Gateway Hotel. The driver on that day appeared to

be about forty years of age with black hair, black heavy mustache, dark com-

plexion and of a rather muscular build.

In connection with the above information it is to be noted, as

reported under Section 9 above, that the "Arb", "Christoball Carrier", and

the "Ancon Trader' cast anchor from the Port of Miami on the late afternoon

inder set con above ,

and early evening of July 24, 1953, after having originally cleared with

Customs for July 18, 1953.

It is not known, however, whether the presence of the above des-

cribed individual, who bore a striking resemblance to SANCHEZ ARANGO, had

anything to do with these three

boats.

ALLEGED ARMS TRAFFIC

A. 1 Proposition to Purchase by Fernandez Castro and Jose Orgaz:

On June 21, 1953, I-I4 reported that on June 20, 1953, JOSE

ORGAZ, an import-export man living in Miami, and a Cuban named FERNANDEZ

CASTRO called on T-14 and wanted to purchase 5,000 submachine guns and

1,000 pistols, as well as ammunition for both types of weapons, to be

smuggled by the seller into Cuba.

T-14 explained that he himself has many contacts with Cubans

in the Miami area and has in the past dealt in arms sales, but that he

wants to avoid violating any Federal lews, including the Neutrality

Act

anmunition from the United States

to Cuba. T-14 said that he advised ORGAZ and FERNANDEZ CASTRO that he was

not interested in that portion of their proposition to smuggle arms and

ammunition into Cube, but that he was interested in selling the guns that

they wanted to buy.

He said that he quoted them a price of $220 apiece

for the submachine guns and he received the impression that they considered

this a fair price.

T-14 said that he also asked them if these guns were being pur

chased on behalf of the PRIO group and they replied in the negative, but

declined to state who they were representing.

T-14 said that when these two men left him they indicated that

they were departing for Havana by plane the following morning at about

9:30 o'clock.

T-1/ explained that JESSE A. VICKERS of Miami is trying to find

a buyer for a large quantity of arms and ammunition which are presently

stored in Italy. 'I-ly said that VICKERS is the Miami agent for a group of

men who own these materials.. T-ly said that he has received the impression

that the owners are American and Italians and include certain "racket"

individuals. T-I4 said that CASTRO and ORGn were informed about these

particular

guns.

J. A. VICKERS, born March 25, 1907, in Atlanta, was investigated

in 1949 concerning the purchase of a plane reportedly to be used in an at

tempted invasion of the Dominican Republic, but prosecution against him

was declined.

In 1946 VICKERS, the Chairman of the Disposal Classification

Board Supply Division, Miami Air Depot; was investigated for fraud against

the Government and under the Surplus Property det relative to the unlawful

scrapping of material. Prosecution was not authorized. In 1950 information

was

received that VICKERS was involved in a scheme to purchase arms for

the Caribbean Legion for use against the Dominican Republic.

This scheme

did not pass the planning stage.

VICherus, who operates the Federated

Sales Company, Miami, was interviewed by the Miami Office May 4, 1953,

relative to his possession of ten fake M3 guns.

These guns had been

shipped fron El Paso, Texas, to VICKERS by ED BROWDER,

who paid $300,00

by means of a bad check to an El Paso metal concern to have these weapons

made up to his order. BROWDER was subsequently arrested on a bad check

VICKERS upon interview by Special Agent MELVTN A. THOMPSON and

the writer concerning these guns, claimed that BROWDER had said that he

had obtained these M3 guns after they had been disposed of by the U. S.

Government as beyond repair and not usable, but that BROWDER felt that

VICKERS claimed that he agreed to

take ten of these guns at $10 each upon the condition that they could be

reconditioned for sale; that he planned to resell these guns to the Cuban

He claimed thet he made no

effort, however, to dispose of these guns

after he examined them and found

them to be beyond a state of repair. it that time VICKERS told the inter-

viewing agents that he was not then

engaged in the sale or exporting of

any guns, although he would have attempted to have disposed of the M3 guns,

which were then in his possession. He said that BROWDER claimed to be in

a position to obtain more of these guns in the event that VICKERS found

these could be reconditioned.

I-14 described JOSE ORGAZ as being a small wiry individual who

resides in Miami and who apparently was born in Cuba,

He said that ORGAZ

appeared to be serving as an intermediary for CASTRO.

This card reflected that FERNaNdEZ is six feet tall, had brown hair,

brown eyes, is of the Cuban race and that his wife is C. LOPEZ. He de-

a personal friend. of JOSE ORGAZ, advised that ORGAZ had returned to Cuba

over the weekend and had entered a hospital for an operation.

that on the previous Friday, June 19, 1953, ORGiZ exhibited to I-43 some

chest X-rays which he had just had taken in Cuba. T-43 said that he re-

ferred these X-rays to a Miami doctor who expressed the opinion that ORGAZ

T-3 said that ORGAZ had lost

a great amount of weight and appeared to be in a very serious condition,

although he, ORGa?, hinself did not know that he had a possible lung. can-

cer.

On June 26, 1953, I-43 said that ORGAZ had returned to Miami to

enter the Veterans Administration Hospital for an operation inasmuch as

the Havana doctor declined to operate at the last moment.

T-43 has advised

that ORGAZ served in World War II as a member of the American military ser-

vice and fought overseas.

the death of JOSE ORGAZ at the Veterans Administration hospital.:

T-43 said that during the pravious weekend a Mr.. DeCASTRO was in

Miami with ORGAZ in order to assist ORGAZ in returning to Miami for the

operation. T-43 described DeCASTRO as being a close personal friend of

ORGAZ and

as having been former head of the Cuban Secret Police who was

dismissed from Office when BATISTA staged his coup d' etat. I-43 said that

DeCASTRO had served under the PRIO government as well as from previous

suban governments in that capacity. He said. that so far as he knows DeCASTRO

with ORGAZ and DeCASTRO that DeCASTRO was one of the few Cuban officials who

had left office without making a personal fortune.

Reported Sale by C. E. Cresswell, New York CIty, of 1.000 Rifles to

Aircraft Purchase Service, New Jersey, on Behalf Prio Interest:

On June 8, 1953, Miami informant I-5 reported having received

information that day from a source believed by him to be reliable in New

York City to the effect that on June 7, 1953, or shortly prior thereto,

C. E. CRASSWELL, 99 Hudson Street, New York City, had sold 1,000 rifles

to the kircraft Purchase Service of New Jersey, which reportedly had a

plane at an airport near Newark, New Jersey, to receive delivery of these

rifles on June 9, 1953.

Informant said that BETTY CRESSWELL of the C. E.

Cresswell Company allegedly had knowledge of these facts and that JOSE DUARTE,

a Cuban, who was allegedly involved with the group of Cubans who were victi-

mized at Fort Worth, Texas in connection with the $240,000 robbery there,

was believed implicated in connection with the deal involving the 1,000

rifles described above on behelf of PRIO interest.

On June 9, 1953, Miami informant I-44, of known reliability, who

is an oflicer of a Federal

agency which conducts investigations, reported

that on May 19, 1953, PAUL B. HICKMAN, 213 Northeast Second Avenue; Miami,

Florida, an aircraft

parts dealer, was in New York for the purpose of pur-

cashing

5,000 carbines for. HARRY S. CANE of the Cane Importing Company of

Miami,

It was ascertained that HICKMAN did not know whether the carbines

were destined for Cuba or other Latin American countries. However, HICKMAN

approached Dr. ALBERT W. MORRIS, 54 Buckingham Street, Springfield, Massachu-

setts, owner of the Morris Engineering Company, who advised HICKMAN that he

provide the desired quantity of carbines, On May 20, 1953, HICKMAN

met MCRRIS at the Belmont Plaza Hotel, New York City, at which time HICKMAN

became convinced that MORRIS could not supply the required amount of carbines

and the deal fell through. HICKMAN subsequently returned to Miami.

About the end of May 1953 ERWIN STRAUSS, attorney, New York City,

advised ALFRED MANHEIM, New York City, that the Morris Engineering Company

for sale, and he arranged for MANHEIM to meet EVERETT-S. DAM,

a Vice

President of the Morris Engineering Company who was staying at the Hotel

on June 3, and that DAM reported that two weeks previously Dr. MORRIS had

been approached by two Cubans relative to purchase of 2,000 carbines, which

they intended to fly to Cuba. The Cubans also exhibited $100,000 which they

had in a suitcase. Informant said that on June 7, DAM disclosed that the

Cubans attempting to purchase the carbines owned a C-46 aircraft which

the Morris Engineering Company did not want to deal with the Cubans directly

and wished to use a middle man. DAM disclosed that the Morris Engineering

Company had 2,000 carbines stored in New Jersey, and that the Cubans had

offered to pay $70 each for them.

iccording to informant, DAM stated that

Dr. MORRIS had already made a commitment to the Cubans, who had been placed

in touch with Dr. MORRIS by PAUL B. HICKMAN of Miami.

However, MORRIS did

not want to deal with HICKMAN as he did not trust him and intended to put:

him out of the deal.. The informant also advised that C. ELIZABETH CRESSWELL,

operator of the Aircraft Purchase Service, 99 Hudson Street, New York City,

was a business associate of HICKMAN's.

Miami. Informant I-45, who is believed to be reliable, reported

on June 9, 1953, that he thought the sale of the 1,000 rifles mentioned

above by I-S was still in a negotiating stage pending the ability of the

Cubans to ship them out of the country.

He was of the opinion that BETTY

CRESSWELL was involved in that transaction in that she had sold a C-46

aircraft to the Cuban group, which this informant believed to be stored

the Teterboro Airport in New Jersey.

Miami informant I-46, of unknown reliability, reported that when

PAUL B. HICKMAN of Miami met Dr. MORRIS on May 20, 1953, HICKMAN was accom-

panied by the following persons:

was negotiating, and that

within forty-eight hours he would pick up 2,000

carbines in the truck and

deliver them to a nearby airport where they would

be flown to Cuba,

On June 16, 1953, Mr. H. C. STUART, Ramy Manager, Dade County

It was ascertained that the Flying Tigers has no agent in Miami.

that, PAUL B. HICKMAN of Miami, Florida, had furnished information to his

gency for a period of several months, during which time HICKMAN was found

to be an erratic individual.

I-47 exhibited a letter dated May 25 from a representative of

his organization in New York City enclosing a letter by HICKMAN concern-

ing a Mr. CANE who wanted to buy 5,000 rifles from HICKMAN.

At that time

HICKMAN was residing at the Belmont Plaza Hotel, New York City.

On May 19, 1953, according to the New York Office I-47, HICKMAN

reappeared and advised that on or about May 1, 1953, Dr. STUART KELLY, who

that CANE had phoned him when HICKMAN was staying at the Hilton Hotel,

Fort Worth, Texas, and asked if he could get 5,000 carbines for CANE for

approximately $70 each. Upon his return to New. York City, HICKMiN contacted

placed him in touch with a Dr. MORRIS of Springfield, Massachusetts, who

was supposed to supply the carbines..

On May 20, 1953, according to T-47's New York Office, HICKM N

advised that a PHIL CASANI of the Trager Trading Company of Miami, and

a MIke sUsSM, presumably owner of a pawn shop in Miami, TOM OLSONg and

a man named NIGRO, the last two being associstes of HICKMAN, arrived in

New York City to consummate the deal, which celled for delivery of 1,000

carbines every three days at some point in New York stete. Later in the

day HICKM/N again contacted I-47's agency and advised that Dr. MORRIS had

backed out on learning the deal was illegal inasmuch as licenses had to

be obtained. Later, HICKMAN advised T-47's New York Agency that MORRIS

had consented and that the guns were to be delivered in New Jersey. How-

ever, on May 21, HICKMAN advised that the number of carbines had been re-

duced to. 250 for delivery each day instead of 1,000 every three days, and

that they were to be loaded aboard a C-46 plane at an unidentified airport

about one hour's drive from New York City.

On May 25, 1953, HICKMIN again advised that the deal had fallen

through as no one could furnish the carbines, and he stated that OLSON

and CASANI had returned to Miami and that SUSSMAN and NIGRO had left New

York for an unknown destination.

T-47 reported that Dr. STUART KELLY, a retired medical doctor,

is the head of Stuart Kelly Associates, and that KaLLY had been financing

D. Proposition Made to Miami Informant I-14 at El Toledo

- Restaurant: Miami, Florida:

On May 28, 1953, Miami Informant I-14 reported that

in about November or December:

1952: a Cuban, whose identity

was never disclosed to the Informant. asked the Informant to

come to the El Toledo Restaurant, Biscayne Boulevard at

Nerüheast 2nd Street, which is operated by JOE and FRANK

MIGUEl, who at that time were employed to guard PRiDis resi-

dence.

While there,

this Cuban propositioned T-it ahout

taking out of the United States a shipment of arms for CARLOS

FRIO.

It was implied that these arms were located

somewhere

in the West or Southwest.

Informans said that he turned down

this offer, explaining he did not want to violate the

Neutrality

Informant said he then exhibited to this

cuban a list of arms located in Burove which he knows to be

fer sale.

Subsequently, the Informant was placed in touch

another individual

who was represented as being one of

PRIO's men, but this party told Informant that PRIO was not

interested

in those arms. Informant said that these Cubans

were very "cozy" and their names were not disclosed to the

Informant. However, the Informant said he got the impression,

during his discussions with both of these Cubans, that CARLOS

PRIO is wary of confidence schemes, and, although willing to

utilize the services of I-lt in transporting out of the

United States arms already possessed by PRIO, that PRio 1s

unwilling to take any risks in purchasing arms.

Informant

said that it is rumored around Miami among persons who have

in the past dealt in arms that PRO is acquiring

arms and

munitions from the Mexican Government.

I-14 claims he has

been frequently approached by representatives of various

Latin countries, who are interested in buying arms and other

equipment for their respective countries.

On July 17, 1953, Miami Informant I-48, who is

believed to

information:

I-48 explained that on the same morning he had

visited his personal friend, MIKE SILVURSTEIN, a former school-

mate who operates Sussman's Luggage Shop at 238 North Miami

tion, SILVERSTEIN asked T-48 how

Time Corporation in Texas.

SILVERSTEIN explained that he is

in the market for 1,000 M-1 rifles, and

in view of the fact

that Texas laws concerning the sale of firearms are very lax,

he felt, that the Informant would be in a good position while

• M-1'so

After any

contact sitestEN collect, and SilveRstell would then fly

to Texas, where he would handle further negotiations..

SILVERSTEIN told I-48 that he was trying to purchase

these guns on behalf of the PRIO group (CARLOS PRIO SOCARRAS,

Former

president of Cuba now living in Miami after being over-

thrown by BATISTA March 10, 1952) •

SILVERSTEIN described his

Cuban contact as being one of the vietims in the $240, 000.00

Obbery which took place at l'ort Worth

Texas.

SILVERSTEIN

added that T-48 could offer up to $70.00 apiece for each of

ünese weapons and that he, himself, expected to get $100.00

apiece for them.

SILVERSTEIN claimed that this was a "hot" proposi-

clon and that immediate action must be taken, because they

nignt not be needed alter a thirty-day period. VIRotEIN

also indicated he was interested in obtaining grenades

or anything else in heavy guns.

SILVERSTEIN indicated that

T-48 should be able to make $2,000.00 or $3,000.00 as his

share in arranging such a deal.

SILVERSTEIN also related to T-48 that on a previous

occasion he had flown to Canada, near Buffalo, New York,

relative to a shipment of guns which were to be shipped

Canada to the United States, where they were to be repacked

for a customer in this country.

He explained that all he had

to do on that occasion was to

sign some sort of an export

license near the border.

He also related that on another

os casion he had gone to New ork and from there to Connecticut,

where he nad participated in a meeting, along with ten or

eleven other people, concerning a gun dea, and the guns ir

this instance were supposed to be located in Canada and were

to be reshipped to Connecticut for purchase for the "old man,"

but that this deal fell through because someone in the group

offered to sell similar guns at $48.00 apiece. On this

occasion, according to silverstein, the cuban customer had

several trucks available

for use at a warehouse in the New York area...

possession a letter from one of PRIO's aides requesting

SIIVERSTEIN to

Texas gun proposition, SILVERSTEIN said that the guns would

PRIO reported, "Yes, we have succeeded in smuggling

armament into Cuba.

Our

movement, when the cry for freedom

and democracy is given, will constitute the strongest and best.

organized attack on tyrany ever

registered in the history of

the Western Hemisphere.

We have to clean Cuba, not just of

BATISTA and his gangsters, but we will have to go deeper in o

the very roots of each tyranical plant.

I do not claim my

administration is absolutely clean and honest, because that

is physically impossible in a democracy, but at least those

sinners in my administration are politicians and not henchmen

or gangsters.

Our revolution will clearly reflect the word.

It will not be just a coup to gain power, but a complete

cleaning up job throughout our country.

"Because of the attitude of the United States Depart-

ment of State, I have at all times been most careful in hand-

ling my revolutionary business.

Up to date no one can put

finger on me.

Yes, I have been in full command of many

armament purchases right here in the united states, but no one

can ever. prove that.

I have alwavs dealt through four or five

persons and never directly with just one."

and that this meeting had been held for the purpose of planning

Miami Informant T-54, of known reliability, who.

is presently acquainted with ANTONIO PRIO, brother of

come to him for advice, explaining that his brother CARLOS had

until recently in his employ, two guards, JOSEPH and FRANK

MIGUEL, Miami policemen, who during their off-hours were engaged

by PRIO to guard his family and residence at 2100 South Miami

According to the information furnished the Informant

by ANTONIO PRIO, about three months previously an unidentified

CAL

On June 3, 1953, ANTONIO PRIO;accompanied by 1-5,

called at the Miami Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

At this time, ANTONIO PRIO, speaking through T-54 as interpreter,

advised the writer as follows.

ANTONIO PRIO said that shortly after CARLOS PRIO

acquired his present residence at 2100 South Miami Avenue,

following his flight to Miami after having been overthrown

'of his followers might attempt to harm PRIO or some member of

his family or might attempt some act on the premises which

would prove embarrasing to PRIO: ANTONIO said that his

brother was happy to have two Miami policemen employed in this

because of the effect it would have upon the people

in. Cuba

capacity from a psychological standpoint. During the time the

two MIGUEL brothers were employed there, ANTONIO PRIO said

that he, himself, gave

then money to purchase the El Toledo

Restaurant at Biscayne Boulevard and Northeast 2nd Street.

ANTONIO said this was done as a friendly gesture and that

It was in the nature of

a loan to a friend.

ANTONIO said that

an investigator from the Miani Police Department had recently

questioned CARLOS PRIO concerning his employment, of the two

MIGUEL brothers, this inquiry apparently being made from'a

police administrative standpoint, and that this was the reason

given to the MIGUEls by CARLOS PRIO for their dismissal from

his service.

ANTONIO explained, however, that the read reason

for their dismissal was because of information received by

the PRIOs reflecting that the MIGUEL brothers might actually

be in the pay of BATISTA. ANTONIO said that shortly prior to

their dismissal; it was ascertained that both JOSEPH and FRANK

MIGUEL, without

notifying PRIO, took a trip to Cuba, where an

official police car was placed

at their disposal while there

and where they talked to colonel HERNANDO HERNANDEZ, who on

one occasion had accused

responsible

for a cache of arms located in Cuba. ANTONIO said that he also

learned through connections in Cuba that the two MIGUEL

brothers, upon their arrival in Havana in the early part of

BATistA regime:

were met at the airport by a man influential with the

ANTONIO PRIO said that because of security

reasons, he did not wish to disclosethe identity of this man

who met

the MiGuel brothers because It would place his

informant in jeopardy. ANTONIO said he also learned that

neither of the MIGUEL brothers was searched, although it was

undoubtedly common knowledge that they were

employed at that

time by CARLOS PRIO. He said the MIGUELs remained in Havana

several days. and almost immediately. following their return

each purchased. a Cadillac. He said

neither of these cars

was new and that the price of one was $2,600.00, less an

$800.00 trade-in.

He did not know. the value of the other car.

ANTONIO said that he possessed no knowledge of any other

unusual expenditures by the MIGUEls.

ANTONIO PRIO said that when the MIGUEL brothers

were confronted concerning their trip to Cuba, FRANK MIGUEL

admitted that almost immediately after their arrival at the

airport in Havana, JOSEPI MIGUEL telephoned the Policé Station:

ANTONIO PRIO said he had also ascertained that

in Miami the MIGUELs had passed around remarks to the effect

that they soon expected to bè in a position to do big business

in Cuba or Mexico.

ANTONIO also said that he had been informed by a

contact in Miami that the two MIGUEL brothers had been in

the services of BAtIstA for the preceeding three months.

ANTONIO said that he had reason to believe this report accurate,

inasmuch as his source, although representing BATISTA in Miami

in some capacity which ANTONIO did not disclose, had, along

with his family, been previously aided in Cuba by ANTONIO.

ANTONIO stated that on the previous night; June 2,

1953, he had been visited by JOSEPH MIGUEL, who wanted to

know why he and his brother were let go. It was then that

ANTONIO and his brother, FRANCISCO PRIO, told MIGUEL that

inasmuch as the police had been inquiring about the MIGUELs,

it was felt that they should be dismissed from PRIO's services

and also that they wanted

to employ, additional protection.

that occasion, upon being questioned, JOSEPH MIGUEL claimed

that he had gone to Havana in connection with advertising

propaganda which he intended to start in connection with the

El Toledo Restaurant.

ANTONIO expressed the opinion, however,

that the amount of business done at the El Toledo Restaurant

does not warrant such advertising.

Miami Informant I-5 reported on May 27, 1953,

that FRANK and JOSEPH MIGUEL arrived in Havana, Cuba, on

May 1, 1953, and returned to Miami via Pan American Airways

appointment to see PRIO at his home under rather

confidential circumstances.

It appeared to the informant that

PRIO was anxious not to have anybody know that NORMAN was coming

to his home. It was observed on that evening at the time of the

appointment a car bearing Florida license IW10858 was parked

the gate to PRIO's residence.

Miami Informant 1-1 reported in July, 1953, that CARLOS

HaVIA, who resides at 2475 Brickell Avenue while in Miami, is

presently residing at the Lexington Hotel, New York City. It is

to be recalled that HeVIA had been picked by PRIO to run as

Presidential candidate on the Authentic Party ticket for the

June, 1952,

presidential elections in Cuba:

However, this failed

to materialize when BATISTA executed a coup d'etat March 10, 1952

and consequently cancelled the June, 1952 elections:

Miami Informant I-25 learned on August 3, 1953 that PRIO

in commenting on CARLOS HEVIA stated that he had sent HEVIA up

north so that HEVIA could take care of many important business

matters for PRIO in New York. This informant got the impression
