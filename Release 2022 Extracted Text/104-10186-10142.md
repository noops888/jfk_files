source: A former Cuban IS officer who served with the Cuban Int elligence
Service until April 1964.

The Direccion General de Inteligencia (General Directorate of
Intelligence - DGI) does not make ary regular payments to revo-
lutionary groups but pays them only when they have submitted a
plan for revolutionary action (armed struggle) ard have had it
approved in Havana. Tnrerefore, there is no standard amount paid
to any one group or disbursed in any one country per month or
year, and if no armed strugele is in progress or bteirg planned,
ho money is given out. Funds expended in Latin Americ. on the
above basis include the following:

Guatemala : During 1963, the DGI paid out about U.S. . :
$250,000. The Yon Sosa group got about :
$200,000 in one year for its activities
(included in the $250,000) .

E1 Salvador : In August-September 1963, when the Salvadoran
revolutionaries were preparing for armed struggle,
‘they received U.S.$50,000. They used the funds
for propaganda, however, and were net given any
mere because they had, in DGI terms, misused
the money. :

Nicaragua : During 196% the DGI disbursed some U.S.$15,000.

In addition, the professor, who was one cf the

liaison officers in Mexico, won a suit for some
damage from a company (perhaps Pan American
Airlines) ard was awarded U.S.$30,000, some of
which he turned over to the guerrillas he
represented, a
