The DOI gave almost rothing to Costa Rica

because there was no revolutionary activity.

The DGI gave Honduran revolutionaries a little

more than to the Costa Ricans because aftor

ine disturbance in lal: 1963 there was almost

no revolutionary action, mos: of the

guerrillas were in exile, and there was a

considerable probion caused by the tendency

o1 guerrilla agents trained in Cuba to spilt

off from the Party and make their own way.

Before August 1963, the DGI had given the

Vangardia de Ascion Nacional (VAN) some

u.s. $30,000.

When the Departamento de

Liberacion Nacional (National Liberation

Department - LN) and the Illegal Department

of the Del separated 12 D-Cember 1963

chey had previously been combined in one

¿A (Irtelligence) Section), the VaN opera-

tions were transferred exclusively to the

Illegal Departmert.

Somewhat later they

were returned to the l Department.

What

sums of money were expended during

the

period of exclusive Illegal Department

control are not known.

Between 1960 and 1964, the DGI put out more

than U.S.$1,000,000 for revolutionary

activities in Venezuela, in

addition to an

unknown amount of arms supplied from Cuba.

Moreover, one of the best Cuban guerrilla

fighters,

Major Abelardo COLONE Ibarra,

went to Venezuela in 1962 and was still the

director of operations in 1964.

If COLOME

returned to Cuba after April 1964, when he

was known to be there, he was probably only

back temporarily to collect more money.
