MEMORANDUM FOR THE kECO.D
SUBJECT: Anatole Re ROSEXXO

1, i 31 March and 1 and 2 April 1969, Anatole was
consulis: about the NOSENKO case asa fcllow-up to the late
January 1969 meetings. He gave recommendations concerning
the procedures and topics to be covered during the begia-
ning phases of additional elicitation from NOSENXO which is
to begin secon,

2. To provide a basis for discussion certain papers
had been prepared for Anatole's review. (See Attachment A
for list.) These papers were basically questionnaires about

some of the unresolved or questionable aspects of the

NOSENKO case based largely on the Ceuiiai themes Anatole
had highlighted on 17 January 1969 when he consented after
reviewing the October 1957-December 1968 intervicys of
NOSENKO, (See transcripts KY 1, 2, 3 and 4.) Other papers
concerned topics related to the NOSENXO case, memoranda
NOSENKO had written, summaries and questionnaires prepared

fron both collateral information and NOSENXO's information

and summaries and questionnaires prepared exclusively on
the basis of information obtained from NOSENKO during the
1967-68 interview period. Each of these papers was read by
Anatole. Anatole's comment, our discussion, or any comment
is detailed in Attachment B, which sets forth crucial ques-
tions in the NOSENKO case,

3. Anatole was told The Director had decided that the
question of NOSENKO's bona fides had not been resolved and
had directed that additional elicitation and questioning of
NOSENKO would be undertaken immediately and expeditiously
pursued. It was understood, of course, as Anatole knew,
that he was to make a major contribution to the questioning
of NOSENKO and that information to this end would be made
available to him: there will be the closest coordination
with him, including a timely review of future transcripts
based on the new elicitation phase. It was understood his
views, Comments and recommendations will be transmitted and
seriously considered if not explicitly implemented. Anatole
emphasized the need for him to review in advance all topics,
if not in all cases the specific questions, to be discussed
with NOSENKO after the new elicitation phase begins. He
understands the new elicitation phase will begin with Attach-

ment C and that there will be no additional topics discussed

with NOSENKO until after Anatole has an opportunity to
review them and comment, :

4, The following summary points emerged during the
course of our discussions as things which must be considered «
in the NOSENXO case information and as papers or question-
naires are outlined and topics selected for further elicita- |
tion from NOSENKO: : |

a. NOSENKO, as I understand the situation, has
had full access to newspapers, magazines, tadio and TV since
approximately August 1968, Anatole was told I have no
knowledge of the periodicals or tooks he has read.

b. NOSENKO has recently been afforded a controlled
break from isolation and an opportunity to have feminine
companionship.

¢. Since December 1968 the FBI has been inter-
viewing NOSENKO about topics previously discussed as well as
other matters of interest to the FBI which do not originate
with NOSENXO. Anatole noted that FBI access to NOSENXO must

be controlled according to the new elicitation procedures.

d. That it is my opinion only that NOSENKO may

think he is entering into or close to entering into a new

relationship with the Agency on the basis that he has



Satisfactorily a fered all questions during the period
1967-68. as

e. That it has not been possible and it may never
be possible te isolate or pinpoint either the exact informa-
tion or the point in time when NOSENKO was given new infor-
mation or additional information which might be relevant
upon analysis to the question of his bona ficcs or his mission,

f£. To date there has been a concentration on pre-
paring elicitation questions on the basis of information
obtained during 1967-68 period because (a) this is the infor-
mation Anatole has reviewed, and (b) this information-has been
considered to be the standard for assessing NOSENKO and his
information and arriving at conclusions, since these inter-
views were designed to elicit information which would help
resolve discrepancies apparent in his previous statements,
and (c) at this time this information is better organized
and in contrast to information from 1962, 1964, etc., is
retrievable as an accurate or literal NOSENKO statement.

g- That the summaries and questionnaires, prepared
to date may not include every comment or statement NOSENKO
has made during the 1967-68 period because it has not yet

been possible to isolate, by indexing and extraction, every

reference to a person or a topic, Anatole was told that

the sorting or isolation proces» has been completed only
throuyh Memorandvm N-188, from a total of approximately 260
memoranda. It was emphasized that most topics and persons
were discussed with NOSENKO several times at varying intervals,
and that the majority of topics were not covered to completion
in one or two interviews. NOSENXO also wrote memoranda on :
topics which may not have been covered during interview or
which may relate to interview topics but which have not yet
been correlated with the interviews,

h. That research and analysis on most topics is
incomplete, both with respect to collateral information and
previous statements from NOSENKO,

i. That, as Anatole knows, there is certain collateral
or related information such as information from the FBI con-
cerning NOSENKO which has not been made available to hin.
Anatole realizes this type of information may be vital to any
consideration of the NOSENKO case and he also points out the
possible if not probable relationship between FBI information
and sources and the problem of penetration of American intel-
ligence and Soviet disinformation. He hopes the FBI will

agree to release pertinent information to him and discuss

tens

:

sources in the near future. He realizes any analysis or
assessment of the NOSENXO case will suffer to the extent
information is withheld from him. Anatole understands the
problem even though he obviously does not accept it as
logical or helpful. He stresses the need for us to press
the FBI to make appropriate information available to hin.

j. That information we are dealing with in the
transcripts of the 1967-68 NOSENXO interviews is not neces-
sarily information previously known to or discussed with
NOSENKO and that, for instance, the body of informaticn re-
sulting from the 1967-68 information has been expanded con-
siderably by NOSENKO's review of hundreds of names and
photographs provided him. It was also noted that it has not
yet been possible to isolate topics new to NOSENKO about
which he was asked to comment during this period. Neither
have we been able to isclate or determine when in the past
new, topics or questions of possible significance were intro-
duced to NOSENKO, :

4, We discussed in detail Anatole's recommendations
and evolved an initial selection of Crucial Questions (Attach-
ment B) and from these the first topics and/or questions to

begin in the new elicitation phase with NOSENXO (Attachment C).

oer


Anatole expects to review and comment and to frame additional
questions after he reviews the transcripts of the first

elicitations. He has requested and expecis, as this can be

accomplished, to review and comaent about a summary of each
Crucial Question.. The summary is to set forth both collateral
and NOSENKO information and detail, with attachments if neces-
sary, exactly what NOSENKO has said. Also, pertinent photo-
graphs and appropriate other documentation is to be attached
for comment or verification of identity by Anatole. Anatole
insists that he review and assist in the framing of all ques-
tions to be aed of NOSENKO and he states that he will
stipulate the order of questioning by both topic and specific
question where appropriate. He will specify or indicate areas
as set forth in Attachment C where questioning may proceed
without his detailed guidance but he expects to be consulted
about each topic. He pisns to carefully tailor the elicitation
approach and, morc importantly, to set down detailed guidelines

to follow when the elicitation or questioning becomes more

. direct and concerned with those subjects considered, now or

later as revised, Crucial Questions. Anatole foresees a period
of relatively bland elicitation which will be followed by a
gradual sharpening of questions to the point where there will

be a confrontation or hostile interrogation. He also foresees



fay wee

-8-

another polygraph examination either before or after the
period of confrontation. The method or approach to the
elicitation from NOSENKO is elaborated in Attachment C.
Anatole's recommendations about confrontation tactics will
follow after the results of the elicitation phase have been
analyzed. During the period NOSENKO is being asked to com-
ment initially, work on additional elicitation topics will
continue, .

5S. Anatole continues to express his concern about the
problem of an Agency penetration and his absolute belief
that there is a continuing need to strictly compartment as
many aspects of our research as possible and to restrict
knowledge about our continuing efforts and particularly the
details to get to the bottom of the NOSENKO case. © He
emphasizes the need to severely limit dissemination of the
results of the elicitation from NOSENKO although he under-
stands it will be necessary to provide the results to the
FBI, He is concerned about the dissemination of his KY tapes
and the possible implications since he now believes he may
have erred in outlining too many areas of concern in the
context of considering NOSENKO's bona fides. Anatole was

told the KY tapes have not yet been made available to the



Deunci

os Po

igs

FBI but that, of course, he would be advised about any
proposal or decision to disseminate thea.

6. In relation to the point about Anatole’s concern
about knowledge of his information I told Anatole that it €
would be necessary for him to comment in detail in the
future as he had recently on certain items. He was told
that, as he knew, we arc at a stage-in the NOSENKO case
where details such as the organizational assignments of

individuals and identifications and the number of leads : i

provided were tending to obscure the Crucial Questions

and divert our attention from the central problem oi why
NOSENKO would have been dispatched. I told Anatole quite
frankly there was a feeling he had not been fully cooperative
on the NOSENKO case. There was a belief that he should
furnish the details of his knowledge about individuals,

operations, the KGB, etc., so that others can try to judge

, the accuracy or inaccuracy of NOSENKO's information. .

Anatole was told that it would come as no surprise to him to

learn that the fact he has not told everything he knows is

since it is obvious his detailed knowledge has had and will

have a direct bearing on the NOSENKO case. Anatole firmly

i
still a problem and that there may be some misunderstandings



-10-

but anicably reaffirmed his position concerning cooperation
on the NOSENKO case. He said (a) it was obvious that
research to date and collateral information supports his
position that NOSENKO is 2 dispatched agent; (b) that he
will continue to cooperate fully as he has when there has
been an exchange of informacion; (c) that he would not give
details now because to do so would result in a situation
where it is "Anatole ‘against NOSENXO" and it is obvious that
more evidence than this is required for an objective conclusion
about NOSENKO; (d) that details will follow after research is
analyzed or during the process of analysis as we examine
information and the details are pertinent; (e) that it is
unnecessary for him at this time to give additional details
ateut personnel or the KGB organization except when these
details reflect on major items -- overall these details are
not crucial and there is nothing to gain by considering small
items and details. If, however, small details become a major
point such as in connection with KOVSHUKY CHURANOV, cox" ana
GRYAZNOV' then duging the review he will pinpoint the specific
and detailed contradictions. He reiterated his previous con-
ments pointed to the waste of time and diversion involved in
-pursuing details and leads to recruitments or persons of

interest to the KGB when there is nothing crucial or significant

involved.

CRUCIAL QUESTIGNS

A. ANATOLE was consulted 31 March and 1 and 2 April 1969
concerning his rocomnendations on how to proceed to clicit
additional information {rom NCSENKO. ANATOLE offered specific

topics and questions about which NOSENXO is to be questioned

after setting forth items or topics which ANATOLE considers
the CRUCIAL QUESTIONS which need explanation or resolution.
Theso CRUCIAL QUESTIONS are set forth below with comment or
notations which emerged during our discussions.

: 3B, ANATOLE understands that the immediate period of
elicitation from NOSENKO is part of the program to attempt to
resolve the bona fides of NOSENKO. Ile understands that his
participation and contribution is actually the implementation
of the program he originally believed was to be followed
before there were any conclusions about NOSENKO's bona fides.
ANATOLE had been reviewing his file material and the transcripts
of his comments in January 1969 (The KY transcripts) so he
was prepared to discuss aspects of the CRUCIAL QUESTIONS as
well as spscific clicitation topics. As our contribution to
the discussion with ANATOLE we had prepared 26 papers relating
specifically to NOSENKO and I had notes concerning other points

or topics to be discussed, Each paper was read by ANATOLE, he



wn

on
-t

retained certain of the papers and, as set forth below, he
conmented about certain of the papers or related matters.
After outlining the CRUCIAL QUESTIONS we vorked out an elici-

tation guide to be followed with NOSENKO as tho beginning of -

_the program, ‘The elicitation guide is detailed separately.

C. ANATOLE submits the following as his recommendation

about how to proceed with NOSES
; 1. Isolate the CRUCIAL QUESTIONS for our guidance
and consideration, (we basically accomplished this 31 March
and 1 and 2 April although obviously these nay be revised)

2, Devise questions for elicitation. The questioning
Of NOSENXO is to begin immediately and is to follow the pro-

cedures set forth separately. (The initial phase of this was

- accomplished, Additional or revised clicitation topics or

questions will be censidered when the results of the first
elicitation phase are reviewed with ANATOLE).

vs 3. A polygraph examination. (ANATOLE believes another
polygraph based on questions he will help frame will be ossential.
It is his opinion that it will be possible to make the polygraph
neaningful if questions are based on a careful review of the
results of the clicitation and specifically on the basis of

his knowledge. ANATOLE believes it should be possible to use

the polyzreph effectively and to eliminate or explain more

adequately the qualifications concerning NOSENKO's veracity

such as “substantially truthful" by pinpointing questions

and areas where there remains dowst. ANATOLE agreed there
might be a question of when a polygraph examination should
be adninistered sinco it might be wore effective after the
confrontation or hostile interrogation of NOSENXO.)

4. A hostilo/confrontation interrogation phase at
which time NOSENXO would be faced with the errors, incon-
sistencios, falsehoods, otc. in his story ant advised that
his nission failed. This phase of the approach to NOSENKO
would only be undertaken upon conclusion of the elicitation
phase or if or when NOSENXO's attitude changes during the
elicitation phase. The confrontation would be undertaken
only when full research on covery aspect of cach CRUCIAL
QUESTION has been completed and specific questions are
framed with ANATOLB on the beeis ef NOSENKO's information or
answers and all collateral information, In this connection
ANATOLE expects continuing research on each crucial question
so that each can be examined on the basis of a summary of all
information about the question, the details of what NOSENKO
has said and related or collateral information such as
photographs or documents, etc. The hostile interrogation phase
ANATOLE anticipates will be undertaken only after full consid-
eration of all possible problems. For exanplo ANATOLE stresses
he will need to review the Bagley letter of November 1966 to ~
NOSENKO since this will be a key element in considsring how to

proceed with the confrontation as well as to attenpt to deternine



satisfactorily answered all questions during the period
1967-68.

e. That it has not been possible and it may never
be possible tc isolate or pinpoint either the exact informa-
tion or the point in time when NOSENXO was given new infor-
nation or additional information which night be relevant
upon analysis to the question of his bona fides or his nission.

f. To date there has been a concentration on pre-
paring elicitation questions on the basis of information
obtained during 1967-68 period because (a) this is the infor-

* mation Anatole has reviewed, and (b) this information has been
considered to be the standard for assessing NOSENKO and his
information and arriving at conclusions, since these inter-
views were designed to elicit information which would help
resolve discrepancies apparent in his previous statements,
and (c) at this time this information is better organized

-and in contrast to information from 1962, 1964, etc., is i
retrievable as an accurate or literal NOSENKO statement.

CRUCIAL QUESTIONS

A. ANATOLE was consulted 31 March and 1 and 2 April 1969

concerning his recomendations on how to proceed to clicit

additional information {rom NOSENKO. ANATOLE offered specific.

topics and questions about which NOSENKO is to be questioned
after setting forth items or topics which ANATOLE considers

ANATOLE had been reviewing his filo material and the transcripts

was prepared to discuss aspects of the CRUCIAL QUESTIONS as
well as specific clicitation topics. As our contribution to
the discussion with ANATOLE we had prepared 26 papers relating

cennented about certain of the papers or related matters.
After outlining the CRUCIAL QUESTIONS we worked out an clici-
tation guide to be followed with NOSENKO as tho beginning of
the program. ‘he clicitation guide is detailed separately.

C. ANATOLE submits the following as his recoanendation

It is his opinion that it will be possible to make tho polygraph
meaningful if questions are based on a careful review of the

might be a question of when a polygraph examination should
be adainistered sinco it night be vore effective after the
confrontation or hostile interrogation of NOSENXO.)

4. A hostilo/confroatation intorrogation phase at
which time NOSENKO would be faced with the errors, incon-
sistencies, falsehoods, otc. in his story and advised that

‘ his mission failed. This phase of the approach to NOSENKO
would only be undertaken upon conclusion of the elicitation

so that each can be examined on the basis of a summary of all
information about the question, the dotails of what NCSENKO
has said and related or collateral information such as

photographs or documents, etc. The hostile interrogation phase

what influence that letter hes had on NCSENKO during tho 67-638

interviows.
D. It was necessary to enphausize to ANATOLE the fact Hl

that at this tine it is not possible for me to assure hia that

everything NOSENXO has said on any topic has been recovered

or is retrievable even for the interview period of 1967-1963

(and 69). Noting the papers we had prepared ANATOLE had to

bo told there was no assurance that everytaing NCSENKO has

said was included or considered when attenpting to extract

(ot summarize his statements about a person or event. Specif-

ically it was noted that with a fow exceptions no topic or
7 ” Gtem is: {fully covered during one or two interviows. Even
though ANATOLE recognized the problem based on his review of
the transcripts of tho 1967-68 interviews it was necessary
te emphasize the fact that the validity of any given question
we had framed wight be challenged, reversed or modified es the
process of indexiag. the transcripts continued. ANATOLE was
told that as of 31 Narch 1969 we had been able to index and
extract the transcripts and nomoranda of the 1967-68 interviews.
only through N-188 of approxinately 260 N-menoranda, ANATOLE

also was told it is not possible to be certain that all previous

infornation from NOSENXO can be accurately and fully recovered,

nation from subsequent statements nodified as a result of
questioning. ‘This problem is an inportant consideration
because the approach to the olicitation phase was developed
with this in nind., Essentially it was agreed with ANATOLE
that despite previous statenonts or information from NOSENXO
the elicitation phase would be nanaged to attempt to obtain
from NOSENXO everything he has to offer or say about each
GRUCIAL QUESTION at this tine without reference to any previous

statement. It is ANATOLE's opinion that if NOSENXO provides
a ‘full statement without proapting that further questioning

can bo meaningful after analysis of _ statement despite

the possibility NOSENXO has modified or ‘revised his infornation

key iteas of diversion,

E, In reply to ANATOLE's question he was told that the
FBI continued to intorview NOSENXO usually with Nr. Solie
present but that I did not know in advance anything about the
topics of any interviews. I told ANATOLE it was my opinion
that once clicitation from NCSENXO began on the basis of his
recommendations that other interviews would stop. Ye
recognized and agreed that there night be a tactical and/or
psychological problem with NOSENKO by shifting tho interview
technique to elicitation rather than consultation and a
response to questionins. ANATOLE could not eaphasize too
strongly-the need to let NOSENXO respond fully with nininal
prodding or stimulation and without refreshing his memory.
ANATOLE was told it was my understanding the elicitation :

phase. would be conducted by Mr. Solie without FBI partici-

‘pation although I did tell ANATOLE that the elicitation trans~

cript results would undoubtedly be given to the FBI just as

have the result$’of all the 1967-69 interviews. |

. F. ANATOLE expects and recomsends that the period of
elicitation will be followed by the period of intcrrogation
or confrontation to be conducted by a tean of threo persons -
The security expert, Mr. Solic; a counterintelligence specialist

who Knows related cases and Cl problens, and a Soviet specialist.

ANATOLE says this team approach will be necessary to inplement

a fast moving interrogation, based on the script he will help

devise, which will not permit NOSENKO tine to reflect or
think about his answers. ‘The tactic will be to insist on

ipmediate and full answers and ANATOLE insists that once the

new elicitation phase begins NOSENKO not be pormitted to

write any answers: He is not to be yiven any written essiga-

ments: every response and reply is to be oral and transcribed

and NOSENXO must be encouraged and permitted to respond fully: _
he is not to be asked to confira or deny any statement nor is
he to be assisted in replying to any question with suggestions
or reminders,

G. ANATOLE recognizes the problem of information froa
FBI sources and the release of this information to hin. He
respects the FBI need to protect its sources and understands
the FBI attitude even though he quite obviously disagrees. He
believes that our failure to nake relevant information available
to hin is shortsighted and lessens both his effectiveness and.
cur ability to decipher the NOSENKO puzzle faster. ANATOLE
recalls that at the time NUSENKO defected in 1964 and there
was discussion with the FRI about the SASHA leud and related
matters he asked for FBI file and source information pertinent

to the probleas, ANATOLE continues to belicve there probably



is a serious question about the possivle siznificance of

i the bona fF

Ss of FBI

ENKO te penetrat’ os of the FRI

sources in terms of misinformation (disinfornation) ina

relation to both % KO and other infernation. lie is of

the opinion that a FBI source(s) prob y Cane tu the PEI

after his defection and perhaps after * "KO's contact if
not dispatch in 1964, Ie suggests the possibility there nay

be a false arrest and show trial of a F351 source in order to

further bolster NOSENKXO's story. Although it has not been

possible to discuss this aspect of the NXO story with
ANATOLE it seems clear that if we are to gain {ull nousure
from ANATOLE it will be necessary for the FBI to approve
or conduct a bricfing of ANATOLE appropriate to puting a
perspective on the F2I sources so he can assess what they

have said about NOSENKO and COLITZYN.
TIO:

_ oH. The following are the CRUCIAL which are to

form the basis for clicitation fro NOSENKO. They are set
forth in the order discussed.

1. Misinformation in the Second Chief Directorate (SCD)

(This is an ammediato topic for elicitation as set forth separately)

2. Leadership of the KG3 :

rlore thoroughly with AWATOLE beforo the question is raised
with NOSENXO again. ANATOLE was emphatic in stating that it

had been a mistake to raise the subject of the KGB policy and

1959 reorganization with NOSENKO. He read the paper with
attachments but deferred comment except to note that NOSENKO
had said very little of significance. It was at this tine
that ANATOLE first noted it was a mistake to permit NOSENKO

to write memoranda, ANATOLE obviously considers this aspect
of the NOSENKO case most important and a topic which requires
his study particularly in view of the fact ho now has extracts
fromthe GOLENIEWSKI letters which relate to the 1959 KGB
reorganization and disinformation. ANATOLE also did not recall

the book so it will be necessary to make cortain he has a

copy.)
os 6. Penetration of the American Enbassy Moscow

(ANATOLE considers this a most important topic which requires
additional study and elicitation later after research will
permit us to assess NOSENKO's statements rapidly. ANATOLE
reiterates his concern that it is exactly and specifically

in this area that NOSENKO's reassurance of no KGB successes
is most likely diversion. ANATOLE expressed his concern that
in January he may have commented too extensively and theoret-
ically about this problen. He now wants to re-examine this

problem and refocus everyone back uore precisely to NOSENKO

and his story)

problem and also be ultimately useful in confronting NOSENXO

9. Boris BELITSKIY Case (ANATOLE approved elicitation
and questioning on the basis of the summary and questionnaire.
ANATOLE stresses the need to confine the questioning to the
questionnaire and tho fact that NOSENKO is not to bo given
additional infornation about the case, its origins, ctc.,

either as we knew it or now know it froa ANATOLE, There will

be some tie-in to the elicitation about Vladiair Luovich ARTENOV

10, The 1960 period of NOSENKO's carcer.
This is to be an elicitation topic later after we
have summarized what we can about NOSENKO's story of this
period. In reply to ANATOLE's question based on his review

KO Timetable and Associates I told ANATOLE

of the paper KOS!

the researcher had found it impossible to date to sort out

and isolate NOSENKO's 1967-63 statements about his career
during the period 1960 to 1562. ANATOLE was told this was
obviously a priority job but that it just had been an in-
possible task without additional research and analysis. We
will discuss this fully when the isolation is completed and

in conjunction with other topics.
11, Vadim Viktorovich KOSOLAPOV 's Novenber 1960 trip.

This item is for later elicitation after nore
resoarch is completed about the code clerks, perhaps a reinves-
tigation to make positive identifications, etc. ANATOLE asked
if KosoLapov's trip to Copenhagen was confirred (N-167 pg. 16)
and I told hin I thought it was under a different nane.

ANATOLE would like details.

of the opinion new questions can ‘ho asked but agreed to defer
elicitation on this case primarily because I pointed out

that in 1965 a paper was written setting forth apparont

inherent security weaknesses in the Johnson case sone of which
at loast suggested strongly that, in addition to Johnson's :
lack of access at one tine, the KGB could have anticipated

a blow at any monent. I outlined sone of the points I recall
about the weaknesses of the principals and quite frankly I

told ANATOLE that I doudted that anyone currently of the opinion
NOSENKO is bona fide would be any nore inclined ‘to credit the
1965 paper today than he has in the past. I agreed that it
uight be useful to again atteapt to get NOSENKO's story about
the JONSON case when this story would be exclusively NOSENKO's.

13. Aleksey HMikhaylovich GORBATENXO.

ANATOLE wants NOSENKO to tell in detail everything
he knows about GORBATENXO, ANATOLE notes the 1955 promotion is

a key element but stresses no gention of this is to be made

Despite previous mentions of CORBATENKO, which

to NOSENK
should be collated, NOSENXO is to restate everything completely.

14, Serafin Nikalayevich LYAL

Elicitation about LYALIN is to follow lator.
All references to LYALIN by NOSENKO should be collated with
collateral infornation about hin. If there is a photograph
of LYALIN, ANATOLE wants to sce it to verify any NOSENKO
identification.
as. Vladislav Hikhaylovich KOVSHUX. ANATONE

considers NOSENKO's information about KOVSHUX most inportant

as a later clicitation point. Ie does not want NOSENKXO asked
any questions about KOVSHUX which nay relate to KOVSHUK's
trip to the U.S.A. or KOVSHUK's association with KISLOV. If
NOSENXO in cennection with detailing the biographios of his

friends includes any of this about KOVSHUX he is NOT to be
questioned on this matter or about the wonan trouble previously
mentioned,

ANATOLE needs exact dates KOVSHUK was in the U.S.

. and ‘ony details of activities he can be given from FBI reporting.

In coniection with our discussion about KOVSHUK possibly working
with and associating with journalists ANATOLE said he recalled
an incident which he thinks took place in 1959 whon he met
XOVSHUK on the street not far from the KGB offices when KOVSHUK
signalled him not to speak. ANATOLE did not and observed

KOVSIUX meet a Soviet journalist in an apparent agent type meeting.



ANATOLE said he had forgotten this incident and he never spoke
to KGVSIUX about it. ANATOLE cannot recall the nane of the
journalist but said he recalls knowing hin slightly. He wit
try to recall the name. (Note for SM check: did KOVSHUX per
NOSENKO work vs. Americans with journalists and specifically
Ed Stevens?)

16, Eugene Peter SLREBRENNIXOV.

ANATOLE says what NOSENKO has said is clear
but that this needs full research and analysis - what he said
contrasted with what NOSENXO said and what, SERESRENNIKOV said -
before asking NOSENKO about this again.

17, Adan BROCHES Case

ANATOLE was told this lead information was being
roviewed in detail, That there was some apparent confusion
and possibly nisinterpretation or nisunderstanding about his
lead information. ;

ANATOLE ‘reiterated his point that the KGB wanted
to reestablish relations which had been broken after BROCHES
left France. ANATOLE knows about this from reading ZARUBIN
paper and he knows that the KGB wanted to talk to ZARUBIN
about this. :

ANATOLE said that he would leave the decision
about when NOSENKG would be asked about BROCHES again to SH -
it could Se innediately when the review was completed or later.
The review is in process and we will have to see what FBI

nay have asked receatly.

18. IN, A later topic.

19, The ¥ Papers

ANATOLE stresses the issportanca of this case

but says this must be a later topic for NOSENKO probably in

interrogation although it may be useful to have NOSENXO :

reviow his knowledge again in detail before confrontation. {
ANATOLE referred to the need to unalyze

the results of the BOWDEN investigation before proceeding too

far with HOSENKO. In this connection ANATOLE was told State

i Security was securely organizing this investigation and that
" .4t was currently planned that interviews would comaenco with

BOWDEN first including mention to BOWDEN about his nention

in the CHEREPANOV papers. In response to ANATOLE's question
: * ho was told that to ay knowledge the FBI did not yet know
ee abotit the BOWDEN investigation since to date it was a State
i Department inquiry based on a need to clarify certain possible
problems. ANATOLE said that he saw CHERHPANOV after CHEREPANOY
ae ‘had’ transferred to the American Embassy Section wearing a
Lt. Col, military uniform. ANATOLE said this was unusual and
it suggests to him that CHEREPANOV was ongaged in an operation,
i perhaps a contact posing as a nilitary beginning in 1959.
He said CNEREPANOV had as a constant companion a young man in
the Anerican Department but ANATOLE cannot recall the young

NOSENKO had naned any Friends of CHEREPANOV but would check
for nanes. NATOLE said he recailed also there was 2 big
change in CHEREPANOV's attitude aad demeanor between cerly

1959 to mid - 1969 or, nore probably, Dec. 1960 whea

ANATOLE sew Cherepanov 2zain. E said he can only
interpret that CHEREPANCV was in a better mood, more confident
in personality because he nay have had sone operational
success. ANATOLE is of the opinion that CHSREPANCY’s chango
in demeanor and mood could only relate to American Eabassy
operations.
29, The ALES Case

ANATOLE says this is not really a crucial

question although en important case which needs resolution

eventually along lines sea forth in the paper NOS.

Homosexual Aspects but not on the basis of the h
angle (see separate Giscussion re homosexual aspects).

21. The TOPO¥ and PENKOVSXIY Cases

hip with GUX

ANATOLE emphasized the need to get fron MOSENKO complete
details about his friends or clained friends. ANATOLE agreed
with the line of inquiry outlined in the paper "Knowledge Because
of Association with other KGB Officers" and said elicitation
should include information sufficient to give tis in one nlace

a perspective on NOSENKO's associates and friends. This topic

can be covered immediately.

TOLE stresses real inportance
of Guk, Kovshuk and Churanov to NOSENKO. He notes Guk's wife

was the daughter of a minister and asks if NOSENKO could have

introduced then. He also points out CHURANOV in school with
NOSENKO.

239 ane ees
ANATOLE agreed elicitation on this tepic should wegin
.inmediately and was most interested in the possible significance
of this case vis a vis disinformation. le noted, of course, the
different perspective on the case and that apparently when this
case was considered in the context of support to NOSENKO's bona

fides analysis had not taken into account the actual origins:

and developrent of the case. ANATOLE innediately connected the

whoa was in contact with the British and CIA. ANATOLE emphasized
his view that NOSEUKO should not be given a hint about the actual

nnings of the case to prevent NOSENKO fron modifying his story

or being led to explanations. NOSEYKO should retell his account
of the (EERE case and then be asked the auestions listed
without confrontation or explanation.

24.

(Seo N-24 - This 2 later tonic) ANATOLE requests
everything available about GINSRURG and srecifically everything
NOSENKO has ever said. After the research ANATOLE thinks he
‘can spot sonething in connection with GINSPUSG which is significant
but which he says eludes hin at this cime.

missed or overlooked. fie says cannot recall the necessary

ANATOLE an aa
pointed out the b..ic and only question with espect to NOSENXO

is misinformation and he sees no advantage or assistance
resulting from questiois about GOLITZYN, However, he said this
was not his decision. He was told the paper about the GOLITZYN
question was prepared by a researcher who works exclusively
at this tine on the 1967-1968 materials end the researcher
responded to a general requirement to extract information and
frane questions to be asked of NOSENKO which could be tested
against known information. The researcher obviously believes
that if NOSENKO were to make a false or misleading statement
which GOLITZYN has or could deny or prove wrong NOSENKO would
be in a bind. ANATOLE was also told he nust understand that
+"compartnentation in research and on NOSENKO as well as on
“larger issues means that we will review a few papers which are
useless in the larger context eventhough to the researcher who

has. a narrow view the concern is real.)

“40, Gennadiy Ivanovich GRYAZNOV.
‘ ” RNATOLE's reaction to the questions and paper was that they

Will not accomplish much of significance re GRYAZNOV since he

‘ thinks there is a GRYAZNOV relationship to the code clerk cases
which can only be determined after that research and analysis
of information about GRYAZNOV. He agreed the questions could
be used later during elicitation as tine fillers and preliminary
to hard questions but not nuch will come because the questions

are not to the point, which he did not explain fully.

ANATOLF. did specifically challenge “OSENZO's story of his
close relationship with G2YAZNMY as a lle. ANATOLE notes the
possibility there was leazage of his identification to the FAI

NOSENXO's story of a Close relatienship with GRYAZNOV in 1962

is prohably false because there was no previous relationship

leading to this. ANATOLE said definitely that GPYAENOV would

have been punished if the EGR knew he was identified as a source

to build up his relationship with GRYAZ"OV and down-play or,

immediately conceded this is really not a problen since NOSENKO

B, "NOSENKO - Homosexual Aspects"

ANATOLE questions any assumption that NOSENKO had any

“expertise" on homo operations. He just does not think NOSENXO
was an "expert" or a "specialist" and points out he can run

doubts he would have been consulted hy anyone as a “specialist”.

In view basic doubts if any questions ‘o be used should be

“woven into other topics and not tresiei as separate subject.

41, RUNYANTSEV |
After reading the paper ANATOLE said there is nothing :
to ask NOSENKO at this time, ANATOLE maintains this will be a
special question later. ANATOLE directly relates the RUMYANTSEV
case to what he considers was the serious mistake of asking
*.SROSENKO about the May 1959 conference. (See N-223) He also
thinks further questions on the conference should only come
later. ANATOLE saw clearly why no questions should have been
asked about RUMYANTSEV and May 59 Conference but after nistake
made it may be we will want to adjust and consider what we might

gain by some questions during elicitation or if touching on this



i
i

point will upset the phasing of questions to NOSENXO. This
matter will be discussed further after AATOLE reads the papers
carefully. ANATOLE was told it will be clear to him that the

May 59 meeting was known through GOLIENEWSKI and there was i

some indication fron this source also of wide scale a
nation programs. It was also noted that in my opinion the
questions for NOSENKO, even with hindsight and ny knowledge of ~ |
how seriously GOLIT2YN's infornation about this conference has

been viewed, were normal intelligence officer questions which

NOSENKO could expect based on the overt information made available.

Certainly the questions were not unusual except for the fact

wothat they indeed were different from other questions asked of

:NOSENXO because they touched en political matters. To the extent
that N-228 showed NOSENKO someone at a lato dato was interested
in political natters NOSENKO may have been alerted. Certainly it
would seem those questions were completely out of context -

out of the blue so to speak - and since there was no follow-up
NOSENKO™ nay feel there is“no real interest because there has
“been no ‘real interest in natters political with hin.

A. “NOSENKO - Uso of Alias by KGB Officers"

ANATOLE “connented these were very good questions. They
could be asked during elicitation or later during the crucial
or hard questioning phase when we were assured of fast follow-up
questioning.

B. “NOSENKO - Knowledge Because of Association with other H

KBG Officers".

ANATOLE thought this was exccllent approach. He



-37-

comaented in connection with paras 9 and 11 and using this paper
stressed need to elicit all possiblo from NOSENKO orally during
interview and no written nemorandua. ANATOLE outlined need for
NOSENKO to list exact dates of all his service assignments;
when he first met each officer; detailed biography of each
officer, etc. He retained without conment the 28 March 1949
addendum re RAROVSKIY, KUTYREV, and SUROV.
; 42, Nikolay S. SKVORTSOV and Vladinir Vasilyevich KRIVOSHEY
ANATOLE, as with these officers, separately lists KGB
lait officers of special significance as part of the enumeration of
<= CRUCIAL QUESTIONS because they are’ not only prominent in
=OSENKO's story but also of major concern to us since they work
on “against Americans, They are important even without NOSENKO.
In most instances also there will be the initial new elicitation
: . about them from NOSENKO. Then NOSENKO's previous information
{ will be collated and compared with collateral information,
: including previous information from GOLITZYN, after which ANATOLE
i - will review, comment with new information, if any, and frame
i pertinent questions for NOSENKO. Specifically ANATOLE says
: that NOSENKO's statement he consulted SKVORTSOV about tourist
operations 1955-59 is nonsense. SKVORTSOV was in Gernany until
1959. NOSENKO should be asked what kind of tourist operations,

etc.

44, GRIBANOV (GORBUNOY)
ANATOLE stresses the importance of collating all
information about the activitios of GRIBANOV and separate the
sourcing.
45. NOSENKO-Asen GEORGIEV Case
ANATOLE believes these questions useful now in
elicitation phase, He wants to review everything NOSENXO has
said about Anatoliy S. KOZLOV and view any photos. I could
not confirm that KOZLOV had participated in the GEEQ®case.
ANATOLE asks if we can confirm KOZLOY was Chief of the Anerican
Section when NOSENKU left the Section in 1955 and what NOSENXO
said about early relations including precise dates when NOSENKO H
says KOZLOV was his boss. In this connection it is noted that
NOSENKO says KOZLOV was Chicf of Dept I (Pago 1 of p2per) then
Tioputy Chief of Dept 7 (page 4). ANATOLE says as clicitation
question NOSENKO should be asked why the demotion and also what

happened to GORBATENKO.

Not unexpectedly, ANATOLE said he vould eventually
want to see the file on the GEORGIEY case to see what the
tie-in to the Sovicts may have been.

ANATOLE wants background and photograph. ANATOLE
thinks questions re Egil SUNDAR needed and that NOSENKO should
fully explain how and why he became involved with a journalist
and what kind of an agent was SUNDAR and his background, etc.
» SUNDAR's targets shculd be described fully and NOSE®XO should
explain the relevancy of this to tourist operations.

B. ANATOLE asked about the Arsene FRIPPEL case but 1
could not answer with complete assurance the details of his
recruitment, admissions, identifications, etc, ANATOLE was told,
however, everyone satisfied about this apparently but would check,

C. ANATOLE suggests full exploration with NOSENKO to
get his explanation for the use of the technicians IVANOV, SERGEY,
and LEBEDEV, Lev A, in the recruitment of the British tourist
Eric LUKIS? Is there a relationship to the Johnson case.

50, Ivan Alekseyevich YEROFEYEV

ANATOLE wants photo and travel record.

“g@ List of all CIA personnel in contact with Soviets in Berlin.

(Page 2) He said he had originally or carlier asked for this

several times and he related this request to the larger question
of his analysis which he raised with Mr. Solie and which has

gone unanswered - he asked for and wants a list of all CIA
people in overt contact with Soviets world-wide. My only comment
was to the point that compilation of such lists was difficult

if not impossible.
$1, Ivan Abramovich PANASENKO

See 50.
52. PIVNEV .
ANATOLE says this topic is definit.y a confrontation -

“topic. Specifically he noted para 7 in this connection.

ANATOLE says he needs the substance of the follow-up

and results of the @S@5=mp case to frame questions re PIVNEV
but he also makes the point he considers the G2M@ee case
ca important separately from considerations of NOSENKO. He recalled
‘ Mr. O'NEAL was to review the file with him and arrange interview
Of SERRE but he has heard nothing. On the basis of short
-‘discussion ANATOLE believes there aro unexplored aspects to this
case and parallels with the RUMYANTSEY, case as far as NOSENKO
is concerned which may go to penetration in the AM EMB, Moscow
or even to Germany. The timing is important. . i ete
A. Aleksandr Konstantinovich KISLOV
ANATOLE relates interest in KISLOV to KOVSHUK as well

as to the BELITSKIY case to begin in overall elicitation about

KGS officers. He wants to review tie F831 information about



“athnpmor tranny mettre anette comet A rn neha uit srt ayn mtn

-41-

KISLOV's U.S. activities and surveillance reports of his
association with KOVSHUX. All the questions re KISLOV should
be used in elicitation.

; B. In connection with NOSENKO's stories about his status
and cover in Geneva in 1962 and 1964, ANATOLE would like to
review all verified info against NOSENXO's statements. For
example was his diplomatic passport verified, etc.

€. ANATOLE would like to review the lists of other members

i of the delegations of which he was a member as well as the

lists of other delegations there at the same time.

(SM NOTE: Check N-127, page 7 - he could take orders of
Chairman on POPOY case. Compare with other info re POPOV case
from NOSENXO, Why would.he,have orders on POPOV case in his
safe in 19647 .The order was put out in 1959 (58760}..NOSENKO

i would know this in 1962 - immediately after American Section duty.
He would have it or access to it but why as late as 1964 in
Tourigz Dept.)

D. After considerable reflection ANATOLE thinks it is quite
possible that NOSENKO held the rank of Lt. Col. but that when he

{ saw he was suspect on the rank issue because his actual history

and his assignnents as he described then did not warrant the

Lt. Col. rank whiehewsesett}aey to cover his dispatch/mission
and the reward he received he decided to agree and downplay his

S2ET :

importance. Ne had to accede to his interviewers to avoid more
questions about why and how he became a Lt. Col. ANATOLE
thinks he may have been revarded (pronoted) quietly with only

a very few persons knowledgable. (S' NOTE: Check all reports.)

ANATOLE suggests this question for polygraph: “Did the
travel document you brought reflect your true rank on the basis
of your success and achievements of your game with AIS which
began in June 1962 in Geneva?

In this connection also ANATOLE points to two promotions
in one year (1962) (See N-181 PE 27): Chief of Section then
‘Deputy Chicf of Department. How has NOSENXO explained this
when he was not in his first job even three nonths and he had
no major successes in Geneva (except contact with CIA?) - What

«, were the cases he handled and the recruitments he made in 19627

53. American Anbassadors

ANATOLE believes at a later date NOSENKO should be
asked or confronted about operations against American Ambassadors.

: However, as an olicitation question ANATOLE thinks he
should be asked if he knew of any Anerican Ambassador who was
recruited at any time by SCD?

Later, under the hostile interrogation he would be
asked if he knew about an important high level SCD American
agent who was recontacted and reactivated when he visited Hoscow
in 1959. Other questions to follow from the team of interrogators

such as who did or would have handled this agent, etc.



54, Yuriy CUK's Agent_in Washington
ANATOLE thinks this case needs attention again even
though it may not bear on the NOSENKO case. He says it needs
analysis and future research on tho basis of whit action the
FBI took, If there is something pertinent to NOSENKO wo can
consider for later use.
55. Yuriy Vasilyevich KROTKOV
ANATOLE says we should extract and review what
NOSENKO has said about KROTKOV and line out the parallels
in the info. ANATOLE notes KROTKOV - Oct 1963; Cherepanov ~
Nov 1963 and NOSENKO - Jan 1964, and he thinks we need to frame
questions to include KROTKOV in cur considerations. He recalls

KROTKOV promised an exposé of the KGB and this never canee

about.

level provocation could b2 run, Furthermore, his most
recent cozzents do in fact provide useful support to our
analysis which had already been conpleted. We do need now
to assess how much GOLITSY% nay be in a position to help

in our assessment and future handling of NOS Q and other
ramifications of this KGL provocation. His value and future
contribution can be assessed on several levels:

a. How much new hard information can he
contribute?

b. flow much new insight can he provide us
through his own knowlecse of KGB procedures and
personnel applied to tho naterials of this case?

c. How auch guidance can he provide in our
future nanipulation of these operations and in
breaking KROTKOV and NCSENKO?

2. Point "a" is discussed in paragraph 5 below. While
there are several useful iteas, the total of new hard facts

2ats and analysis, is disappointing as one would

3, Se are faced at this point with the eninently con-
plicated task of breaking NJSENkO. (hile preparing to do
so we are keeping hin productive and exanining the ramifi-
cations of the operation.) Our great need now is for hard,
incoatrovertible facts with ch ve can confront NOSENXO,
to prove to hin that our conviction about his ilt is
based on sonething more than analysis, which is what he
now evidently thinks it is. For this, our only imnediate
asset is GOLITSYN, who locas so importantly as a factor in
this operation, We therefore hope, despite GOLITSYN's
relative lack of contribution thus far, to exhaust all pos-
sibilities and get fron hin every possible detail. Therefore,
since there are many loose ends and unclear bits fron his
29 June report, we are prepiring followup questions for
GOLITSYN which night assist our task, Some of these questions
are attached hereto as Attachnrent A.

4. GOLITSYN's principal report on the NOSENKO case was
contained in the oral presentation of 28 June 1964. As
background for his study of the case, GOLITSYN was given a
wide range of materials on %OSENXO including 113 pages of
responses to specific questions GOLITSY. wanted put to
NOSENKO (see attachnent B for a listing of all materials
pertaining to NOSENKO which were shown to GOLITSYN). In
addition, GOLITSYN was given the CHEREPANOV papers with
supporting documentation, as well as the KROTKOV case and
manuscript, the BELITSKIY, the UNACUTE and POPOV cases.

In general, this was nearly everything available to us in
our analysis of 25 March, 1] May and 8 July, with the ex-
ception oz the SCOTCH case.

S. Statenents of fact: What GOLITSYN could contribute
in the fora of personal knowledge, as against supposition,
is sunnarized in the subparz3raphs below, Comments on each
point are appended shere appropriate. Several of these
points are of real assistance, but certain aspects of their
conteat or presentation weakens their iapact or opens then
aad the source's accuracy to sole question,

a. This mun is the persen he says he is,
Yuriy Ivanovich KO, the son of forver ‘linister
J, and he really was a kGS officer.

ent

(1) COLITSYS knows this because he says
he knew NOSENKO p rsonally, havin t his tuo

Was there on other business. GOLT SYN also net

x NkO said in the Tourist Department.
GOLITSYN asked hia about CilURANOV. In addition,
-~NOSENKO and GOLITSYN*know“one anothér indirectly

through their conaon friends CiHURANOV, GUK,
KASIIEYEV, etc.

(2) NOSENKO, however, could not identify
the photo of GOLITSYN and, when told who it was,
repeated his earlier statements that he had
never net GOLITSYN and would of course renecber
YF he had. He had once been shown a group photo
of hia, (It is difficult to sce why NOSENKO
would lie about this, since we clearly could
check through GOLITSYN and a contrary statenent
would throw ediate doubt on NOSENKO's bena
fides, and there would apparently be nothing for
him to lose merely adnitting it. This raises the
question of why GOLITSYN might lie about this
point, similarly not very easy to answer.) 2

b. NOSENKO served in II/1/i from 1953 until 1957
or 1958, and was specifically responsible during the
period 1953-54 for Ancrican military personnel in the
Embassy, In 1955-57-58 he may have had the sane
responsibilities, or may have been working against
other assy personnel or correspondents; but was
definitely in II/1/1.

Comments:

(1) NOSENKO says he was in II/1/1, working
first against correspondents and then against
nilitary personnel, fron “arch 1953 until mid- 1955,
and claias then to have transferred to the 7th

Directorate (11/7).

(2) In our oun anclysis of NOSENE
story (11 ‘fay report) we had expresse
that “OSEN i

he entered and what he did, and since his later

c. NOSE: served {ros 1957 or 1953 in the #4
Tourist Departnent (11/7), where in 1959 he was a
senior case officer,

Connents:

(1) As noted above, this contradicts

NOSENKO's story of having nade this transfer
in mid-1955, thus creating a period of to to
three years which NOSENKO's legend is trying

i to cover up. This suggests to GOLITSYN that
there was some success in the Enbassy during
this period, which is supported by other ob-
servations (see below).

(2) There is reason to doubt the validity
of GOLITSYN's statement, since NOSENKO is in-
dependently known to have been involved in at
least one, and perhaps two, strictly tourist-
type operations involving U. S, citizens in the
period 1956-1958. One was Richard BURGI, whoa
NOSENKO recruited in June 1956 in the company of
Anatoliy KOZLOV, Chief of II/7, who has confirned
NOSENKO's story and identified his picture.
There was possibly one other American, Gisella
Harris, in 1957 (she tentatively but uncertainly
identified his photo) and he clains to have worked
on three foreigners, one of whom, Sir Alan Lane,
British, has confirmed the story and recognized
NOSENXO's photo. The tvo others (Ilans GERKENS,

a Geraan and fnu SUENDER, a Norwegian) have not
yet been identified.

Edvard Saith, onted in 1964 with
this carlier statene *, .JSENKO vigorously

denied it, His earlier clain could thus
have been a slip, or perhaps nerely a gratui-
tous boast (paralleling his 1962 clain to
have been involved in the October 1959
attempt against Russ Langelle).

(c) SENKO has reported personal par-
ticipation ia only a few checkable tourist-
line activities during the years 1955-58
although his year 1959 is replete with then,
almost all confirned independently.

{d) The only other indeperdeatly known
activity of NOSENKO durinz this period was
two trips to England in August 1987 and
October 1958. These, he claims, were merely
to serve as watchdog for two Soviet sporting
groups (and to give hin sone flavor of the
West). They could presuaably have taken hin
fron II/1 just as well as from 11/7.

NOS!

@ did not work in II/1 at any time in

1969, and therefore it is unthinkable that he was there
for the one year 1961 either,

nts:

(1) This confirus our finding, 2s reported

in Il “iny report.

(2) GOLITSYN claits to kaow this because he was

c I1/1 in December
ked with the then of II/t/t,

He would have known if NOSESKO wore
in the section then at all, nuch less as deputy
chier,

However:

- NOSENKO vas away in Cuba until 13
Decenber 1960 and thus nay not have

beon there at the tine. Nonetheless,

the Fact t he had becove Deputy

would presuzably have coz2 out of :
GOLITsyYs" s talks with KOVSHUK, anyway. i

GOLITSYN had earlier said that PETROV
was chief of I1/1/1, GRYAZNOV the deputy.
Insofar as SR records show, GOLITSYN had
never named KOVSiiUX in this position, as
far as we know, until he saw the NOSENKO
materials, KOVSHUK was, of course, named
by GOLITSYN many times as an active case
officer in II/1/1.

e. Contrary to NOSENKO's statenent that GORBAT!
remained as chief of II/1 until 1959, GOLITSYN knew that
GORBATENKO was sent as senier KGB advisor to Hungary
shortly after the Nungarian Revolution, probably about He
January 1957,

Comnents:

(1) Since this is a high-powered job and
represented a promotion, GOLITSYN thinks it may
well have been given to GORBATENKO as a result of
success in operations against the American Embassy,
specifically a recruitnent. GOLITSYN thinks NOSENKXO ‘
may be covering this up by changing the dates of
GORSATENKO'S transfer, and associates this with
KOVSHUK's trip to the U. S. in early 1957, pre-
xmably to follow up or conplete a ‘loscow Embassy
recruitnent (about which trip NOSENKO also gave
apparent disinforaation, linking it to the "AXDREY"
case, te so all agree is wnlikely, especially
since left Moscow in the spring of 1954).

he clains, GOLITSYN "recalls" that this took place
in 1957 or 1958, not in 1954, and this was the reason
he was transferred out of the nore sensitive Aserican
Departuent to the Tourist Department.

Coanent:

(1) GOLITSYN also said that the events
“must have happened™ after NOSENKO became a CP
member (in 1956-57), sugg2sting GOLITSYN is
not stating a fact but naking a supposition,
It is not clear, in fact, whether GOLITSYN
knows or supposes that this caused \OSENKO's
transfer out of If/1 into II/7.

g. The post of Assistant Section Chief -- which
GOLITSYN says NOSENXO claimed to occupy in 1960-62 --
was abolished in 1959, those holding this title being
made senior case officers.

Note: GOLITSYN is apparentiy confusing
POMNACH (Assistant to the Chief)
AINACH (Deputy Chief).
NO also reported that Poanaches
were abolished and made senior case
officers, while Zannaches continue to
this day, GOLITSYN nust also believe
this, since he hes reported GRYAZNOV
as Zaanach II/1/l.

6. In addition to the opinions
connecte rized above, GOLITSYN provided
a nuaber of opinions, theories and suppositions on various
detailed aspects of this case. sy and large, these nerely
provide additional supzort for opinions already presented

Questions for GOLITSY% based on 29.

What is your opinicn of the general accaracy of K

(Aside fre ops and special incidentscanscted with provocation)

and the
(Aside fron

Any contradicti between your pre
information he provided re who was
GORBATENKO's departure date)

In your opinion, vould the KG3 give NOSENKO carte blanche to
tell. the truth re organization, personnel (including photo
idens) and procedure ? “ould it fee! 2 encash to persit
hin to make najor lies on this, esp. eral organization

ll
(such as Sluzhba, Directorate of Il, ete.)?

What are the specific points you think NOSENKO is lying about
re personnel? E
You reported earlicr that PETROV was chief of the lst (Embassy)
Section of the ican Departnent, anc GRYAZNOV the deputy,
as of 1960. NOS! O reports KOVSHUK had long been the chief,
PETROV never had been, and GRYAZNOV only becane deputy after
NOSENKO left in January 1962. ilow co you explain NOSENKO'S
statement?

What is your opinion about the general inforaation NOSENXO a
gave on Tourist Department ops, i. e., the totals he reported

{about 37 tourist agency owners and ecployees, about 25 non-
American tourists recruited, and a few miscellaneous others), i
plus about 19 American tourists - practically all already
Pdentificd, known or useless - and 5 Acerican tourist company =
personne 1? i

Do you know anything about the relative success in recruiting
tourists prior to 1961? Any considered solid or important?

Did you have direct, earlier, knowledge of NOSSNKO's career
and activity? ad you heard about his trouble with women,
the flaple reports as having occurred in 1954? (The trans-
cript leaves it unclear whether it was your belief that it
happened in 1957-S$ or whether it was hard fact.) ‘

Could you provide cetsils of the apprexisate date, location,
circuastances under which you net NOSE EXO cach tine?



Do you k

: Lid you hear fre1 XG5 personnel)
that NOs at cc Gb in 1953? Or is that rely
the first year you personally sav or heard about his? fiad
you ever heard of hin before 1953?

Vid you ever hear anytning about Nos:
than-his father, i. e., nis GRI servic
Institute of Foreign Relations), reside
neishbors?

ko'ts background other

Can yoa describe the Obzor you sav: on the POPOV case, par-
ticularly its format and length? (NISEXKO has described it
as hard-cardboard covered, only about five inches wide by
eight high, and about 20-25 pares long.) Are all obzors
produced in this or other standard fornat?

You have reported that a KG3 officer named KOTOY, formerly
in Yugoslav ops in Austria, suspected POPOY and was sent
in 1953 to Germany on the POPOV investigation. ive know of
no KOTOV in Vienna in the period concerned. Did you nean
Mikhail ZHUXOV? Another? Could you give us more details
on KOTOV, such as full nane, description, career?

Do you have any knowledge of direct contact between NOSENKO
and PREISFREUND? NOSEXKO clains not only to have been a
case officer for PREISFREUND, but to have been his close
friend, even prior to the time you left Helsinki. Can you
comnent?

What can you say about the selection of NOSENKO for the
trips to England in August 1957 and October 1958? Would
this be likely for Tourist or Ancrican Department officer?
