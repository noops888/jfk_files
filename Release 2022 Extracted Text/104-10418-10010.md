MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Rockefeller Commission Contact

Mason Cargill told me today that the reference

in the Commission report to an employee who was fired

because he abused a defector came from a deposition by

Dick Helms.

Helms

could not remember an exact name,

but from the description which he gave on his deposition,

it is clear that the employee who was fired was John

Torpats. He was discharged by Allen W. Dulles in 1960.

Torpats, hinself a Lithuanian refugee, was working

in the

in Frankiort, Germany•

In the course of interrogating another Lithuanian •

defector, Torpats beat him.

After Torpats was fired,

he sued the Director (then McCone) • He lost the case.
