our coiclusious just arrived at that Nosenko is not
a genuine defector but more probably an egent planted
onus by the KGB. Mr. [elias described-the basis for

.our belief and the means of arriving g t. Mr. Helms-

noted that we had discussed the Husenko case with the
Warren Commission because they had received a report
from the FBL based on the FIs ‘inter: rozetion of Nosenko
which pertained to the Oswild case. The report made a

se for the position that the Sevie nent

of President Kennedy. « The Cowaission was anxious to know
yeuction and.we informed them we were not sure of tho
s bona fides and therefore could not underwrite the
atements he had made.

2. Ambassador Thompson renirked that he had just
heard from Isaac Don Levine and that the latter intendod
to write a book on the Oswald case in which he hoped to
make the point that Oswald was mentally unbalanced and
was trying to.break up the Kennedy-Khrushchev. relation-
ship. EEE

3. We also related the Krotkov case in the United
Kingdua to the Nosenko case, explaining the way in which
the Soviets could hope, through accusations that forner
Ambassador to Moscow Maurice DeJean an agent, to
“cover" the nuncrous leaks of sensitive inforaation
suffered by the Freach Government and reported to us by
the defector Golitsyn.

decided to return Subject to Soviet control, he would

be served. wv an immigration warrant for deportation ures
able alicn, A€ters rds, he would be flown
rope and allowed to return to Soviet custody, .-We
would ‘probably wish to accouplish this in Berlin’ where
several such turn-bucks have been made in the past

and this has been accepted by the Soviets. Aabassador
Thompson asked why we could not indict the nan and tr
hin for espionage, ie explained that it would bo dif=
ficule to pro this even if he were to give us a full
ion sin the only evidence would be his own word,
Furthermore, we would be reluctant to becone involved in
the eviteble publicity that a trial of this nature would
cause, lie are anxious to tearn the truth but ‘ire not .
interested in a trial or punishacnt for Nosenko.

lor Thompson then said that the only aspect
g which gave him pause was the idea of re-
turning the nan to Soviot custody, Ue felt that we would
inevitably encounter criticism fron the. press if they
specu d ‘the turn-back was in exchange for the release
of the three flyers, This tho Government’ would very much
wish to avoid, Mr, Murphy showéd Ambassador Thompson the
dreft press. statement we had Prepared by which wo hoped
to make clear that this was not an exchange of any type
but related!solely to the fraudulent character of the
Nosenko defection. This accompanied by additional news-
paper publicity would serve to make. clear the real -reasons
for Nosenko'"s return,

6. Ina bricf aside with Mr. Davis, the discussion
of the letters cane up and we had an inconclusive dis-
cussion of them, ile agreed that the letter which was to
be read. by the wife on the Lmbassy prenises should not be
sent to the Embassy nor should the Embassy become involved
in this. We'also discussed the Possibility of sending the
other letter! through regular mail channels to the wife's
address, ‘We did not discuss what the Embassy was to say
if the wife called again and I feel I must go back to Mr,

Davis on this question,
