A. SUMMARY: In the period since ref prorress report
AMDENIN-1 has been primarily enraged in keeping his fences mended
with the various exile croups inthe area in anticipation of. mov-.
ing intaa,pesition in the AMEUD-1 orcan{zation in which he will

eaten from'these groups. In additién to this he has prepared

OPERATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS

2. In response to a Station request subject provided an
estimate of.the current situation in PBRUNEN. This report
stressed the points that the farmers and the fishermen. in PBRUMEN
are the most willing and capable of providing support to. resis-
tance activities as a result of their having suffered the:most at
the hands of the current administration after being largely
responsible for its obtaining power. He also provided a general
strategic plan of Oriente Province in which he defined the main
areas in which guerrilla elements can survive and how they can be
reached fron coastal resupply points. ‘His ability to do this is
based upon his being a native of the area and one who has been
primarily interested in its geography due to his former large.
agriculture holdings there. eaiiet

3._ He has had one meeting with AMBUD-1 for the purpose of
maintaining contact. His main question to AMBUD-1 ‘was with regard
to the latter's ability to actually control the people on his ‘staff.
He was disappointed by the reply which though positive could not be
supported with an example of where AM3UD-] had actually brought

about the dismissal of anvone had proved to be ineffective.
AMDENIM-1 is a rood friend of BUN-l as a result of his father's
long standing relationship with him, but at this point has very
, little respect fer him as a result of, as he says, AMBUD-1's
\ failure to actually make his orranization into an effective body

and to enpare in activities which actually detract from the success
of the current UMEN regime. It remains that he is willine te

Following his belief that the most insortant job at hand
is the development and maintenance of maritime reception points
> along the north coast of PBRUMEN, AMDENIMe] has devoted considerable
‘ time to readying assets among his exiled fisherman friends to make
contact with their former fisherman associates still based in
PBRUMEN, The foundation for this activity is quite: tenuous as a
vesult of a variety of factors which make it difficult. to arranee

Is This attempt was unsuccessful due tothe failure of the inside

to be exfiltrated on this Operation appeared in the JMWAVE area

They carried the message that someone had- stolen the-port chief's
Personal boat as a result of which the inside contact was unable
to depart on schedule due to the implementation of temporary re-
strictions until the theft had been investigated. ‘She. said the

7. INTELLIGENCE PRODUCTION: AMDENIM-1 has provided a number
of memoranda on developments within the various exile eroups in the
JMYAVE area, none of which qualify as intellizen: information but
all of which Gontripute the Station's bétter lerstandins of.
the local politics, Specifically, he has provided info on the
“political beliefs and background of most of the PBRUTEN exiled labor
leaders and the activities of the Bequer pro: He has also teen
helpful in clarifving the picture as to the movements within the
UR at this time while the Station is tryinr to determine how best
to orpanize this group in order to be able to take over its more
worthwhile features without becoming unduly committed to giving
it special -prominence in the exile community. He is being counted
on to help bring the UR into the AMBUD-1 organization as a means
of creating the appearance of greater unity among the exile

community,

8. COMMENTS AND FLANS: While no spectacular achievements are
resulting from AMDENIM-1's efforts at this point he is steadil
becoming more and more susceptible to KUBARK control and more
proresstona sg eftorts. A recent example isthe critique he
gave his fishermen for not realizing more information out of the
vefugecs they met at Anguila Key while waiting for their inside
contact, They had failed to adequately debrief two young men, who
had succeeded in surviving in PBRUMEN for over two months on their
own, on the basis that they were too young to be knowl: :
As it turned out the two refugees had used the cover ~o.
