ANNEX B
THE 201 SYSTEM

Rescission: Annex B of Chapter II, CSHB 70-1-1; 27 October 1966

1. INTRODUCTION

‘The 201 system provides a method for identifying a person of specific in-
terest to the Operations Directorate and for controlling and filing all pertinent
information about that person. The system also provides a means for identifying
subjects of 201 files from various categories of information about them and for
producing lisits of 201 personalities according to those eatenories. Only a rcla- aa
tively small number of personalities indexed are of sutficient interest to justify
opening a 201 dossier. These are normally subjects of extensive reporting and ~
CL investigation, prospective agents and sources, members of groups and organi-
zations of continuing target interest, or subjects on whom a volume of corre-
spondence has accumulated.

2. THE 201 SYSTEM

‘The principal features of the 201 system are:

‘a. The 201 Number: a unique number, i-e., 201-1234567, assigned to each
individual in the system to serve as identifying file number for reporting on that
individual

b. The 201 Dossier: thé official file containing the 201 opening form (Form
* 831) and all biographic reporting on and references to the individnal, i.e., pee-
sonal history, current status, and prospects. .

& The Master 201 Record: a machine record generated by the opening of
2.201 file, This record produces the master 201 reference for the Main Index and
stores the pertinent information which may later be retrieved for special listings.

&. Moin Index Master 201 Reference: this reference, printed in reply to an
Index Search Request, is printed as illustrated below. When data are absent
within the record, succeeding data items or lincs will be moved up and the ref-
erence consolidated. : :

¢. Ol Code: a two letter symbl used in conjunction with the 201 per-
sonality records in the 201 system to record the association of an individual
with organizations or activities of operational interest. OI codes cover intelli-
gence and security service affiliation, whether staff or agent, or known or
suspect, as well as activities of DDO interest. There are two cutegories of OL
codes for use Ly components:
(1) general OI codes (Attachment 4)
(2) Of codes assigned to a specific component for intelligence services
or other specific organizations.
A component may request an OI code be established by submitting a mem-

orandum to the DDO/RMO through the component Records Management
Officer.

A201 personality may be assigned two OI codes. An OI code may be assigned
when the 201 Personality File Action Request (Form 831) is initiated (see
paragraph 3b below) by filling in Boe 19 or 2 code may be assigned or added
at a later date by a Form 831 amendment.

‘The 201 system has the capability of producing machine listings of 201
personalities by OI codes. For example, if an Ol code has been opened for the
security service of a certain country a listing may be compiled of all members
of that service. .

£. 201 Machine Lists: produced from the mechanized 201 Index, based on
or other identifying information of personalities on whom 201 dossiers

exist.

3. OPENING A 201 DOSSIER

a. General

‘The opening of a 201 dossier is the prerogative of an operational com-
ponent, in coordination with the Information Services Group. An opening creates
4 master 201 record. Changes to the master record and the occasional closing
‘of a 201 dossier are controlled jointly by the desks and ISG. 201 dossiers may be
opened on persons who meet the carding criteria described in Chapter Il of this
handbook, when there is a reasonable expectation that additional information
will be acquired and filed in such a dossier. Generally dossiers are of ‘on
persons about whom counterintelligence information is being reported, and per-
sons of operational interest to the Operations Directorate, specifically those
persons for whom provisional operational approvals and operational approvals
are requested (see exception below). 201 files are not to be opened on staff
employees, staff agents and most categories of contract employees. Files on

persons who are only of local interest to a field station or Headquarters desk
and on whom no DDO records correspondence exists are not a part of the DDO _
records systém and are to be maintained by that unit. Some desks levy require
ments on ISG for automatic 201 openings on certain categories of persons whose
names appear in incoming dispatches. These’ are listed in Attachment 2. 201
dossiers should be opened in the following categories:

(1) Subjects of provisional operational approval and Sea ap-
proval requests. However, a file need not be opened when a POA is requested
for persons being trained for a foreign liaison service and who are of opera
tional interest for training purposes only.

(2) Persons for whom the field requests a 201 opening.

(3) MHFIXTURE personalities: bonafide diplomats of other than
denied area countries, in close association with stalf personnel.

4) Subjects of a Personal Record Questionnaire Part I.

sees) +7" (5) Persons on whom a Main Indes search reveals inforination in five ©
or more documents (see DOI 70-20).

(6) Subjects of Interagency Source Register memoranda from LSN/
ISR (opened only by IP/RMS).

b. Requesting 201 File Opening

Headquarters desks may open a 201 file by filling out and submitting
@ 201 Personality File Action Request (Form 631) to the Records Main-
tenance Section (IP/RMS). Form 831 is also used to create or amend the
master 201 record and 201 machine listings and to register the assign- ‘
ment of a cryptonym to a 201 personality. Attachment 3 consists of sample
201 Personality File Action Requests for opening and amending 20!'s. A field
station may request the opening of a 201 file by writing 201- in the Head-
quarters file or cross-reference box on the dispatch form and/or after the
7 subject's name in the body of the dispatch. A telepouch request for a 201 opening
5 is made by indicating 201- in the file number line. A cable request is made by
* placing 201- after the term “File” on the last line of the transmission. IP/AN
will open 201 files as requested by dispatch or telepouch but it is the responsi-
bility of the desk to respond to cable requests. Field stations are notified of
201 openings through receipt of the field master 201 record.

10. 201 MACHINE LISTINGS

Machine listings provide field stations and Headquarters desks with names
and 201 numbers in the requester’s particular geographic or functional area of
interest. If a component wishes to exclude a sensitive 201 personality from its
alphabetic, numeric, and eryptonym listings, this may be done when opening,

(Form 831) leave the country of location (Box 15) and interest desk (Box 16)
blink, use the non-country code 900 in the action box (Box 14), and indicate
permanent charge to the responsible desk. The only listing which will include the
201 number is the IP/201 record for the Vital Records program. 201 listings are
categorized as standard or nonstandard and as scheduled or special.

All standard listings are cumustive; previous editions inust be destroyed
upon receipt of current editions. These listings are by their very nature extremely
sensitive compilations of information and must be given every possible safeguard.

b. Non-Stondard Listings
Based on one or more of the following selection criteria: _
’ (1) Country of location
(2) OL codes (organization and/or intelligence atittion) ”
(3) Citizenship :
(4) Year of birth (plus or minus a given number of years)
(5) Occupation. a é
‘These selection criteria may be used singly or in combinations, For example,
a user could obtain a list of ull 201 personalities who have been assigned the
OI code of XX or codes of XX, XY, or XZ. A 201 personality list could elso be
produced of all persons who were bom in Germany between the years 1915
and 1920, with the occupation computer specialist, who are now citizens of the
United States, located in Mexico, and who had been assigned the OI code AA.
Note however that the listing would contain only those personalities with an
Ol code AA. Those personalities with an OI code other than AA and those
with no OI code would be excluded. The requester could however ask that
persons who have not been assigned an OI code also be included. Note also
that when retrieving lists based on occupation, the listing will be only as specific
‘as the occupation code (Attachment 1). The occupation cede for a courier

covers only a documented courier. Some occupation codes cover more than one ©

occupation. For example, the occupation code CRAF covers those who practice
some trade or manual occupation, i.e., carpenters, bricklayers, painters, mechanics
_ and electricians. If a list is requested for electricians, all otliers in this category
