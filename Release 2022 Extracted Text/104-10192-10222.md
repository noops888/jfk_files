s\delegation in Puerto Rico, and a letter from Enrique Villareal
‘de Ya Concepcion, HDC representative in Chile, indicated a
difforence of opinion within the organization concerning the
MDC's views regarding the Chilean Christian Democratic Party

and Eduardo Frei Montalva, President of Chile. Villareal re-

“vetgned from the upc.)

1, In a letter dated 29 July 1965 to the president of the Movimiento
Democrata Christiano (MDC, Christian Democratic Movement) in
Miami, the Puerto Rico delegation of tho MDC set forth its
views on what it considered a "conspiracy of silence” against -
Christian Democracy, It felt that the movement was being
harmed by deliberate distortion of facts, and that. the cam=
paign was intensified by. Chilean President Eduardo Frei :
Montalva's trip through Europe. The delegation took exception ©
to statements, about Cuba made by Frei, whom they considered
ill-informed, The delegation did not feel that public state~
ments should be made on this matter, but warned that Cubans
should be alert concerning Frei, The delegation suggested
that Frei should be censured by the national executive com~ |
mittee of the MDC, : :

agreed with the Puerto Rico delegation's concern about the
hostility. togard the MDC ‘in ‘the ‘press, and in political aod
religious circles; which. it said’was more intense in Miami
than in Puerto Rico, .Tho: letter pointed “out, however, that
there has béen a noticéable-chango in ‘the attitude of United
States Governsent officials toward the. MDC; that 'the MDC is
treated with, more respect ‘and consideration. This was
attributed to:the. grq#ing igportance of Christian Democracy
in intornational relations, due to Frei's. triumph and his

-

‘According’ to the letter,’ thé national executive committee of

the MDC has been observing Frei's actions with: growing alarm,

Since Frei's inaiiguration-in Novenbér 1964, the MDC has been:

inquiring ‘about. the.Chilean Government's attitude toward 2

Cuba, and 'tryfag.to exert influence over that attitude. In
<°dnterviows with Radomiro, Tomic, Chilean Ambassador to the
aited:States; Otto Boyo, Iiternational Relations Secretary.
“ef the Chilean Partido Deaocrata Christ}ano (PDC, Christian
Democratic Party) when he visited Miami,/ond with other tee
eaders of the PDC,’all said that Frei has. noty and ‘probably eg,

plexity of-the internal situation in Chile and because he
gould not act unilaterally in hemispheric mattérs,. They.
claim that. the statements attributed to Frei concerning Cuba
are loose quotations from ‘speeches, intended for internal

by the press.’ The letter continued, that it was not advisable |
to take a public stand against the statements attributed to
Frei as that would lead: to a public debate with’ the PDC and
‘as a result would place other parties of the Christian
Democrat Orgiinization of America (ODCA) in a position of
having to support one or the other. ;

‘The letter said that the MDC must gather documentation on what
Frei has said and written concerning Cuba, and assigned this
‘task to the Puerto Rico delegation, This documentation could
be studied at the next national congress, and from this
documentation it might ‘be possible to develop a good defense
for Christian Democracy and the MDC. It warned that this
problem must be bandied with self-control and without emotion,

Even though the MDC does not- like Frei's, position, he is the
first Christian Democrat to be elected president in,the

eon tinues.
to gain in stature internationally, Also, he shows respect
‘and sympathy toward the MDC, He is a responsible person and
is not pro-Communist nor does he sympathize with the regime
of Fidel Castro Ruz, It would be a disservice to Cuba and to
the HDC if a split were provoked between the MDC and the PDC
or with Frei, pereanally., On the contrary, the solution to
the problem is a rapprochement because the MDC has faith in
fhe PDC to understand the NDC's viewpoints when ‘they are |

presented clearly. :

In a letter dated 24 August 1965 to the president of the MDC,
Enrique Villareal de 1a Concepcion, MDC delegate in Chile,
said that he bad received notice from Laureano Batista Falla,
secretary of delegations of the MDC, that he (villareal)
would not represent ‘the MDC at the ODCA meeting in Venezuela
from 12 to 14 August because he worked in the international
department of the PDC. He said that he had decided to resign
from the MDC and continue his work in Chile and his work for
the Latin American Confederation of Christian Sindicalists
(CLASC), He said he felt it was impossible for him to do _
anything constructive for Cuba or for soctwl-€hristian % °“

He conéide: 't.a grave error for ‘the majority

‘A member of a group of Cuban enigres trained in the techniques”

The Ninth Congress of the Movimiento, Democrata Cristiano (MDC,
Christian Degocratic Movement) was held in Miami from 27 to 29
August 1965." There was little enthusiasm at the Congress asa
result of the dissatisfaction of the MDC with the Christian *
Democratic moverent ip Latin America, and the fact that an in=
creasing number of members of the MDC identify themselves with,
and support the foreign policy of, the United States,

It was decided at the Congress that the National Executive will
be. elected for a one-year term, starting with the election of
February 1966. The National Executive elected at the Congress
for the period tron September 1965 to February 1966 is composed
of the following:

President Laureano Batista Falla

Followers of Batista who attended the Congress said ‘that they - |
‘bad formed a block in the Organizacion Democrata Cristiano de
America (ODCA, Christian Democratic Organization of America)
with parties of other countries which agree with the stand of
tho. MDC on international affairs. This. bloc includes the
parties of Brazil; Peru, Venezuela ‘and Colombia. They plan

to compel the Chilean party aud others to take a more definite
stand against Communism and the-regime of Fidel Castro Ruz.

4, Members of the Military Sector of the MDC mét with the deje~
gates to the Congress on 29 August. Angel Hernandez Rojo’
asked that the military budget be ‘increased from $750.00 (U.S.)
per month to $70,000 per year, and that a base be established
in Central or South America, regardless of the distance from
Miami, He said that the MDC had sabotage and demolition,men
: and equipmént ready,.to operate’ in. four provinces of Cuba, and
‘ that a tedm of frogmen, which was: completing training in Puerto
Rico, would be ready to operate “in a few days". Ho said that
| they could not operate from the United States because of U.3,
j Customs, and that the political situation in the Dosinican
Republic makes it impossible. to operate from the MDC base
o thero, He added that two-boats which were at the base in the
! Dominican Republic could not be used, Hernandez asked that
each delegation establish.a-military nuclous, and said that
: be would visit each delegation to help organize the military
i element within two months, The members of the Puerto, Rico

ve Dy Gwillermo Marti’ Martinez, known to friends as "Bibi" is
also a key-figuro in the MDC, He is completely devoted to tho cause,
Although an attorney by profession, in-his late thirties, he makes a

Taree UNEVALUAT
AS young Cuban exile who has beontrainod in information colloction.
fia past reporting has beon accurate but lacks depth. This
information was obtaincd from a member of the KDC,

1. On 8 April 1965, Otto Boyer, foreign relations secretary of tho
Chilean Christian Democratic Party, arrivod in Miani, Florida,
for a one-day interview with mombers of tho. national exccutive
committee of the Hovimiento Democrata Cristiano (MDC, Christian
Democratic Movement), Juan Manucl Salvat Roque, leador of the
Directorio Revolucionario Esatudiantil (DRE, Studcnts* Revolutionary
Directoratc), was present for the intervicw, Doyer had just
spent more than 30 days touring Central Amorican eountries in an
effort to make direct contact with Christian Democratic Partios

in that area.

2, After his introduction, Boyor briofly ¢cscribed the history of
the Chilean Party fron the day it was foundod 30 years ago until
ite riso to power in 1964 with tho election to the ‘presidency of

Eduardo Frei.

3. During the course of the interview, boycr entertained polite but
energetic questions fron various members of the HDC, When he was
asked why President Frei wanted to Inve commercial relations with
the Communist countries, Loyer attempted to explain that the
decision was not based on idoology but on economics, Ho said that
Chile has a great neod for hard currency und that if the United
States can maintain commercial relations with the Communist

The dolesation from:New York, couposed of Cuarione Diaz Martinez
and Victor Datista Falla, did not arrive’until 21 February.

Hluriberto Porez Herrera presented tho report of the Puerto Rica

delegation, the highlights of which were as follows:

a. The activities of the MDC, delegation in Puerto Rico de=

| ereasod considerably during the past six months, This,

' he claimed, was due to the problens of tho Christian :
Democrats in Chile and to ‘the position talen by Eduardo _
Frei, President. of Chile, d

;The public activities of the MDC, such as the celebration
of the anniversary of Jose ‘lartils birthday and the houage
paid tp the Venezuéian portworiers for their boycott of
ships trading with Cuba, as well as the caupaign in favor
of a Cuban Govornnent in Lxile, had holped to overcore puch
of tho stagnation of the HDC in Puerto Rico,

The Puerto Rican delegation differs from the Miami delegation
in that it is made up of Cuban exiles of-a higher financial
standing tlian that of the average Cuban oxile residing in
Miamwi, The wembers of the Puorto Rican delegation contribute
one percent of tioir incoue to the ucC,

d, ‘The MDC is concerned over the. penetration of the Conuunist
;Party in-tho university and other centers of higher learning
“and sone of the terrorist activities of the Communists.
The SDC 13 also concerned over the attitude of the press
regarding the terrorist activities and feels that the. press
has pro-Communist leanings,

Later in the same session Perez spcke of the great value of
the Juventud Democrata Cristiana (JDC, Christian Democratic
Youth) of Cuba in Puerto lico and gave high praise to Montecliu
and Patterson, However; when there vas a discussion in the
Congross ubcut outlawing the Communist Party in a free Cuba,
Honteliu and Patterson said the Party should be recognized
as-a logal party and should be allowed to engaye in public
activities, When certain members of the Miami delegation
opposed this, Monteliu and Patterson accused the Miami dole~
gation of being fascist.

The report of the Mexican delegation was presented by Carmen
Yillarea de Guzman and included the following poiuts:

a. The Mexican delegation has 42 members. Nelations between
the different groups of Cuban exiles in Mexico are cordial;
- patriotic and public events are usually celebrated jointly.

b, The delegation is developing a plan for the establisiment
of radio courses about Christian Democratic doctrine,
Similar to those already established in Coloubia and ‘
Vonduras, As a result of. arrangenents wade by the ‘fexican-
delegation, it was possible to have a two-hour weetly
course on Christian economic doctrine given at the School
of- Economy of the University of iiexico, where a three-
hour. course in iarxisu is now being given,

aftor the scanda} in the Cuban Enbassy over the Contrabard
in blood plasma,

Carmen Villares proposed that a represontative of the military
section of the 4oC visit Mexico, Without foing into cotails
which she described as confidential, sie said there was a pos-
sibility that armed activities against the Castro regime could
bo carried out from ‘iexican territory.

Guariono Diaz ‘artinez presented the report from the New York
deleovation, It was larxely devoted to narrating the efforts
made fu support of a Cuban Government in Exile,

Following are soe of the resolutions ‘approved during the congress:

a. Reduction in the nuaber of nembers of the National Executive
Committee, thus increasing its mobility.

b. Eotablishment of nev requircuents for being eligible for
election to the National Executive Committee, such as having
taken a course in leadership or having sufficiont leader
ship ability, in the opinion of the executive committee, with-
out having passed such a course.

Increased control by the executive committee over the
activities of the delegations.

d, Compulsory participation of the executive committee in
the financial collections of the delegations,

e. Establishment of a regulation that a meaber of the National
Executive Conmittee cannot belong to any delegation,

- Elimination of the 4slitary Secretariat and the establish-
nent of control over uilitary activities by the president
of the National Executive Committce, The.uilitary section
cf the HDC is to be directed by a person designated by
the National Executive Committee who will formulate the
plans, projects, and budget for military actavities,
presenting theu for the approval of the president of the
executive committee. le, in turn, will have to inform
the members of the connittee only about those details
ghich he deens pertinent and which do not coupromise the
success of the planned activities,

In discussing the topic, “Nuestra Postura" ("Our Position")
some changes were observed in relation to those approved at
the previous congress, such as:

a, Disappearance of the attitude of defiance against the
United States Government, This was shown by the approval
of the results obtained so far in United States policy

towards Cuba,
b, Rejection of the thesis of the “betrayed Revolution,”

c. Optimism regarding a near solution of the Cuban problem,
The congress was inforned that the National Executive Comittee
had approved the idea of the formation of a Cuban Government
in Exile, although it had not made any commituents about the

manner of foruing it or the persons who should belong to it,
