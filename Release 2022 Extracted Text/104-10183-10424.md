1.

Carlos has never been active in politics and voted only

once in his life - for a candidate of the Authentic Party.

However, he has been active in revolutionary and counter-

revolutionary activities since 1952.

During the year 1952-53

he began conspiring against BATISTA acting as an acconnodation

addressee for Jose Antonio ECHEVARRIA (now deceased) and close

associates of ECHEVARRIA, inclading Rolando CUBELAS.

Others

invölved with Carlos in the anti-BATISTA activities included

Ricardo MIDIN Rivas (who had been a Senator in the Prio govern-

ment

and a Vinister in the Grau government and who now resides

in Miami), Sergio MEJIAS (who had been both Senator and Minister

during the Prio government, a representative ding the Grau

government and who is now the Mayor of Matanzas), Diego Vicente

During the revolutionary activity against 34IISC,

ECHEVARRIA and CUBELAS had as much or more prestige than Fidel

CASTRO but after BATISTA fled from Cuba, Fidel CASTRO maneuvered

himself into control of all of Cuba to

the detriment of other

revolutionary leaders.

CUBELAS accepted CASTRO's leadership

at first but became disenchanted as CASTRO turned towards

Ommunism and as CASTRO neglected the other revolutiomrs

leaders who had struggled

against BATISTA.

Is the result of

CAstRo's attitudes and

actions, many of the old revolutionaries

became counter-revolutionaries.

began working against the CASTRO regime in the same way as they

had worked against BATISTA.

The activities of Rolando CUBELAS and

those close to him, including Carlos, are covered in a separate

paragraph below.

C. Connection with the Agency

About 1957 Carlos and a Caban businessman named R: cardo

RIVON were approached by a Czech who said that he wished to

invest a substantial sum of money in Caba and who promised quick

and substantial profits if RIVON and Carlos would join

activities.

Rolando, in order to carry out his plan for a coup in

Cuba, has had to make

a number of persons knowledgeable to a

greater or lesser extent.

Those people who now are in Cuba

and who are aware of the plans of Rolando include the following:

Cdte Ramon GUIN (who has become quite nervous and who is drinking

heavily), Cate ([nu) NIEVES (whom Rolando considers absolutely

.. reliable

and a key figure in the plan and who now is in charge

of the port of Havana),

à Captain

whose name Carlos has furnished

to the Agency but whose

name he cannot recall, who now is an

artfllery chief),

a MiG pilot (who had sérved witholando during

the righting against BATISTA) 6E1 Moro" ACEF Jor (ACE) (whose

knowledge is dangerous because he is a coward who now hesitates

to bear any responsibility in carrying out the plan): Luis sora

(who now is rector of Habana University), Marcelino

ARTIME (an old revolutionary who is thoroughly reliable and who

is a close friend of Carlos), an individual whose

name Carlos

does not recall. but who is an uncle by marriage of Tony CASTEL

(whom Carlos considers to be a worthless person),

and at least

six or seven others whose names Carlos does not know.

In addition to these individuals who are aware of the

details of Rolando's plot, there are others whose support CUBELAS

believes he can count on once action is taken but who have not

made aware of

the plot (so far. as Carlos knows) up to the

present time.

These include the following: Cdte Efigenio

ALMEIJEIRAS Or ALMEJEIRAS, Cdte Juan ALMEIDA Bosque, Raul DIAZ

Arguelles,

a Cate who is known as "Julio El Grande"

, a Lieutenant

whose first name is Guillermo and who acts as Rolando's chauf-

30 officers

whose names are not known to Carlos, Faure CHOMON (whom Rolando

considers a communist at present but whom Rolando expects to

for personal benefit), and finally a number of

people in Las Villas.

The whole plot against Fidel CASTRO could be discovered

by the cuban security serv-ce because of the many individuals who

are aware of it and because some of them are irresponsible:

by the Cuban security service.

Carlos learned this through a

telephone call made by DE LEON. DE LEON said that the mother of

"El Loco",. who resides, in Miami, had just received a letter. irom

her sister in Havana with the foregoing news.

The letter said

that "El loco" is not in jäll and has been able to visit relatives

but that he must appear for questioning throughout the day and

is not allowed to sleep at home.

(Carlos suggests that the

Agency endeavor through its contacts in Miami

to get a copy of

the letter and to warn

the mother of "El Loco" that she should

not talk to anyone about it.)

E.

Miscellaneous comments of Carlos concerning people involved

the CUBELAS plot

(In addition to the comments which already have been

reflected in previous paragraphs,

Carlos made others which are

reflected here.)

"El Nago" ROBRENO is a thoroughly irresponsible

man whom Ramiro VALDEZ, Minister of Interior, forced to leave

Cuba because ROBRENO had caused so much

trouble for the Cuban

authorities.

ROBRENO is a drunkard and woman chaser who wants to

live an easy life but who is not willing to work and never has

worked throughout his life.

these admitted defccts,

ROBRENO admires and is loyal to Rolando CUBELAS.

Rolando is disenchanted with the Agency. He told

carlos that the Agency has had abundant opportunity to deal with

ARTIME - whom Rolardo does not trust and who told Rolando that

Rolando considered that the injection of ARTIME was a

21. If Rolando can get through the risks, inherent in

having so many people know about his plot,

during

the next couple

of months, he certainly will carry through with his plans -

this before the end of the year.

22.

Although

Carlos recognizes the defects of both "El

Mago" and "El Luco"

, he shares their opinion that the Agency has

not treated cither

them or Rolando fairly.

Carlos believes that

both these individuals, in addition to being useful in connection

with the plot, could have been useful in many other ways because

of their access to Cuban government representatives including

intelligence people in Europe and elsewhere.

"El Mago", who still

G. Ambassador CARRILLO

29.

Carlos first met CARRILLO about 1957 when CARRILLO

went to Carlos' store to price an engagement ring for Pepin

NARANJO. At that time CARRILLO was the treasurer for the DRE -

which was Rolando CUBELAS'

group.

Carlos bought some bonds and

also contributed money apart from bond purchases.

CARRILLO waS

once in Miami but the time is not known.

About 1958 CARRILLO WaS

exiled from Cuba and lived in Spain where he represented the DRE.

After the collapse of BATISTA, CARRILLO returned to Cuba.

In

early 1960 he was a functionary in the Protocol Department of

the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

At that time CARRILLO's wife

• became a

customer

of Carlos' store, buying quite a bit of

inexpensive jewelry.

30. To the best of Carlos' knowledge, CARRILLO does not

suspect that Carlos

is connected with

the Agency; CARRILLO knows

that Carlos is a friend of Rolando but does not know anything

about Rolando's plot against Fidel.

The dealings

between

CARRILLO and Carlos in connection with the latter's purchases

of Cuban government jewelry arose

because Carlos once had priced

jewelry in Havana.

CARRILLO remembered this and offered to sell

jewelry to Carlos.

When Carlos bought jewelry (on our behalf),

Carlos proposed to CARRILLO that the latter tell the Cuban

government that the jewelry was being sold at a lesser price

than that which Carlos was paying.

Carlos offered to arrange the

bill of sale

to show the lesser price so that CARRILLO could

keep the difference

CARRILLO refused indignantly.

Carlos believes that CARRILLD is playing square with ted Cuban

government. Carlos believes that CARRILLO, although not a

communist, is happy with his status and priveleges as Ambassador

and that CARRILLO is not likely to defect or to accept recruit-

ment.
