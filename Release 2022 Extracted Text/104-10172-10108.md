MEMORANDUM i
To : Chief, CI Staff
FROM : CI/OPS/WH

SUBJECT : Deportation of Maurice Halperin

1, Attached is 3 copy of MEXI 186 in which the station asked
for guidance on their effort to deport Halperin, We discussed this
on the morning of 12 September. During the afternoon of 12 Septem=
bor I received HMM-A-7904 which outlines the statione! efforts to

. bring about Halperin's deportation,

2, You will note from (para 2 of HMM-A-7904)-that the station
began ito effort on 21 August when LIKAYAK-~2 was asked by a Mexican
official for information on Halperin. It appearo that the atation then
went forward {a ‘an attempt to have Halperin deported without advising
Headquarters or the Legal Attache.

3. Thus, when it appeared from LIMEW's atatemente (see

, MEXI 186) that ODENVY did not.want American Communiets deported,

the station realised that it was working at croas purposes withthe

| Bureau since the station's efforts had Been in progresa for almost

three weeks.

4. That the Mexican government te probally confused at thie
‘moment ia indicated’by the fact that Gustavo Dyas Ordas-(see para 8
‘of dfepatch) who ie in touch with Santillan, probably knows that

‘Santillan 16 receiving information from LUKAYAK-2, who {a known

Little doubt that SUVTiLAis BEAD Hernandez, RONAN Lugo, and CARVAUAL were all

12, On either 2h or 25 Aucust R\ FXO Hernandez made a cryptic remark to LIKAYAK+2 to
the effoct that a high official of tie US Dnbassy in Mexico had seen the report
on HALP. iti and thought it excellent. In reply to LIKAYAK-2's questioning,
ROUERO Hornandez would not state now that official had come to see the report and
would only state that the official might have been tho Secretary to the Military

ted thnt HALPRRIN would be deported, that the President was studying the case and
that a lot of action could be expected, Rafael sHUERTA Nava, a police informant
on.Cormunist matters, hinted to (-2 that several raids were to be made in
the near future, one of which was to be in Cuernavaca, This led’ LIKAYAK=2 to
believe that the SIERIMHALPEXIN group was to be raided, as suggested by this
atation.

weekend to Cuerravaca.to locate the Alfred K. STERN home there. Ile stated it is
an imposing home, nearing completion, LIKAYAK=2 added that he has received a
report that Ralph SCOTT; the Stern colored American chauffeur, is the lover of a
negro. woman named "La Kartinique", who does semi-nude dances in Acapulco, and
that for that reason her residence may also be searched,

Meanwhile a technical surveillance was re-estaclished on tie home of HALP:RIN at
1215 hours‘on 2k august. This coverage, plus LCHAYFONL coverage, was held in the
belief that it could shed corsiderable lignt on developments in the case.
