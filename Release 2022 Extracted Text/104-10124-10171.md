MEMORANDUM FOR: Assistant for Public Affairs to the
Director of Central Intelligence

FROM: Robert W. Gambino
Director of Security

SUBJECT: Gordon Barton McLendon (U)

1. (UL) Reference is made to the attached Washington
Post article of 22 March 1978, which suggests that Subject
has proposed a weekly television series on the Central
Intelligence Agency.

2. (AIUO) Office of Security records reflect that
Subject was born 8 June 1921 in Paris, Texas and that he
served in the United States Navy during World War II. He
was graduated from Yale University in 1946, and later attended
Harvard Law School. As of 1952 he was serving as President of
the Liberty Broadcasting Company.

3. .(S) In early 1952 the Directorate of Operations (OPC)
requested a Covert Security Approval so that his firm might
provide accreditations | to a contract agent. The
request was subsequently denied following a field investiga-
tion which disclosed a question concerning his business
practices. It was brought to light that the Liberty Broad-

casting Company suspended operations in May 1952 and went into
bankruptcy the following month.

4. (S) In December 1965 the Directorate of Operations
again requested a Covert Security Approval on Subject in his

â€˜position with the McLendon Broadcast System, Dallas, Texas.

A field investigation in January 1966 was basically favorable.

5. (C) His 201 and security files show no evidence of
operational interest after 1966 and inquiries with appropriate
Directorate of Operations components indicate he probably was
never contacted or utilized in any capacity.
