7 Since his last Fitness Report, in June 1974, Mr. Woods has continued his extremely
fine performince as a conscientious, hardworking and. thoughtful records manager and ~
registry supervisor. The-CCS registry workload remains at about the same level as ~
previously reported, and Mr. Woods regularly works an hour or so of uninterrupted over-
time every working day personally reorganizing procedures, cleaning out, consolidating, |°
and retiring files. His enthusiastic determination in reducing the numbers of out-of-
date and no longer useful files is most exemplary. Knowing the numbers of primary and
supplemental files involved in this exercise, and as.a retiring supervisor, I can only

wish ata “good: luck"!

wr. Woods also continues eager to learn and use new methods and techniques. Ouring
this: reporting period, in aly, 3874, he took the Agency course. "Introduction to

Mr. Woods first made a survey of the. Augean, stable that the Italian Branch
files had become over many years of shifts in personnel,and chaiges.of direction,
He then reviewed, downgraded, and retired approximately 350 Top Secret docu-
ments with appropriate Project and Subject files and copies destroyed. At the
conipleticn of this there was not one Top Secret document on the Branch, He devised,
gained approval from Fi/D, and carried out a new. procedure for the downgrading of
TYLOTE material from Top Secret to Secret so that it could be retired. He retired

approximately 60 Project, 25 Subject, and fifty 201 files, He surveyed the

In the four months he has been under my supervision, Subject
has demonstrated that he merits in full measure the high opinion
of him held by his previous supervisor. Conscientious, careful,
fully knowledgeable of Registry procedures he has Kone about his
day-to-day tasks in an exceptionally proficient way without the =
need for constant supervision. He is prompt in his response to
requests and has an excellent sense of "get the job done". He
4s an intelligent and concerned suporvisor who has been meticulous
4n keeping his supervisors briefed on personnel and other problems
as they have arisen in the Station Registry. He appears fully
capable of assuming larger. responsibilities: in the records field.

The rating officer regrets that Subject's bea situation pre-
cance his staying for another tour.

With, about nineteen months experience managing the station
rogistry already under his bolt, his usefulness here increases.
He continues to demonstrate the same quietly effective leadorship

and talent for sound organization in his.own shop as were noted

on the last fitness report.
, While maintaining a high standard in the more routine day- i

to-day services and processes a registry is normally expected to. :
supply, hé has also been the catalyst for a thorough, carefully v
phased and continuing review and, where appropriate, purge of t
registry and other file holdings. Administering this ambitious ina
reduction program requires sound judgment and experience in

handling the detail in our existing records. Subject has these
qualities and has achieved impressive results. To complete

this task, he has asked to extend his tour here for one year

- pod until'Novomber 1971 atid Headquarters has approved this.
He is invariably completely responsive ‘to guidance. from
DCOS;. his immediate supervisor, ‘and conscientiously soeks to
achiove the work goals which aro idontified during our occa~
sional accomplishment and porformance consultations.

the

The

spirit of cooperation with which"ho deals with other station

personnel: is equally commendable.
No criticism can be made of his security and cover deportment.

This employee continues to be Chief of the Station Registry. During the past year ©
his level of performance can be properly evaluated as exception'hiy proficient. He
continues to welcome hard work, is not bothered by-constantly changing deadlines
and is able to fill in for any absent member of-his unit, and keep up his own work
as well, He is quite conscious of the value of Government personnel and materiel,
and does everything in his power to conserve these resources. He continues to come
{ up with new ideas on how to perform his functions in a more efficient and effective
manner. This results in benefits to the entire Station, It is regretable that the
position this employee fills does not allow for promotion since he has been perform:
at a level above his present grade for several years.

As the Chief of the ‘Tokyo Rogistry: this employee has performed well. -
He has abundant ‘energy and constantly comes up with ideas for the tmprovement
of the’ efficiency of his unit. He welcomes hard work and is able to fill in and
take over any job in his unit and keep up with his own duties as well, Asa -
aupervisor, he has a slight tendency to be arbitrary when convinced he is right.
This may be due to the fact that the Registry frequently operates under conditions
of pressure due to the recent reorganization, reduction, and relocation of the
Station, The Station has been required to get the Job done with fewer people and
under more difficult working conditions.

SUBJECT; Jamos 8, WOODS - Recommendation for Promotion

1. Subject has been in grade GS-10 since June 1968,
Based on his outstanding performance as Chief of Rogistry in
the Romo Station since June 30, 1971, he strongly merits
promotion to grade GS-11 at this time. When Subject took
over tho responsibility for Registry a year ago, he found a
system glutted with paper and bound up by a policy wh
(iscouragod getting rid of dt. He Lound many procedures in
forco which were out of dato, 1f not obsoicto, and proposed:

 stfeamlined procédures, which were adopted, to replace them,
Ho asked for and was given tho responsibility to analyzo and

distribute the cables, which had previously been a function
of the Chicf of Station's secrotary, He recommended. the
discontinuance of the abstract system, which proposal had
been adopted by most elements of the Station, Ne recommended
a reduction in the retention period for cable and dispatch
chronos. With tho help of a TDY team here for the first half
of. CY 1972, he devised and instituted a prograni of purging
the files. This program has resulted in tho disposition of
most of the departed Soviet files, a severe trimming of the
truo nano files, and the review, reduction and up~dating of

the project and operational ftles, AlL of this sork
entries on the i
tinent documents for tram:
qua In summary, Subject performed a thorough “house-
auning" of Station records in the full meaning of that ‘pa’
This program is by no means finished. In fact, Subject has
plins for continuing etforts along these lines which may es
to veturn to Head=
quarters not later than May 1974, The on-going program includes
© review and reorganization of the subject files, the encrypted
201's and the disposition (hopefully) of about 50 feet of micro-
film, A corollary to these projects will be a significant
redwction in the index cards, which at present lead to the micro~

“gilw'iind to other superfluous watersal we either have or will

destroy.
2, The equally important aspect of records management,

namely the introduction of procedures to lessen the likei



nad

4f not prevent tho reoccurrence of this pile-up of paper
is not lost on this officer. He constantly thinks in terms
of procedures and controls to accomplish this end.

i 3, Subject is dedicated, highly motivated, con-
wcientious, and bard working, He reports to.work cach day
ap hour hefore the Station opens in order to distribute the
cables by opening of business, He never hesitates to respond
positively to any request for help. Indeed, he solicits
work which he. believes can be done more easily or more simply
4p hia unit, In all respects, Subject is a trained, profes-
stonal records managoment officer who 1s thoughtful as well
as enthusiastic about his work,

moted to grade GS-11,
