Dear Mr. Blakey:

In regard to your 10 August 1978 request for information

concerning one Nestor Castellanos which you indicate was

withheld by the FBI under the third agency rule, I am pleased

to provide the following.

The intelligence report in question is a compendium of

material relating to various Cubans who were reported to be

studying in the USSR under scholarships granted by the Cuban

government during the period from 3 March to 6 August 1967:

The report makes no reference to a Nestor Castellanos.

Of possible relevance is a reference to a Jose Castellanos,

in which it was indicated that he (Castellanos) was an engineering

post graduate from the Cuban Institute of Meteorology who was

to specialize in hydro-meteorology at the Academy of Sciences and

who was

scheduled to depart (Cuba) on 27 April 1967 aboard a

Soviet ship. The foregoing is the only information contained

in the report relating to anyone surnamed Castellanos.

I hope you will find this information useful to your

investigation.

Sincerely,

John G. Kester

Special Assistant To

The Secretary
