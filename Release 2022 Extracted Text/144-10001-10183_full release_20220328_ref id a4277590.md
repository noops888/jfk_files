Dear Mr. Blakey:

In regard to your 10 August 1978 request for information
concerning one Nestor Castellanos which you indicate was
withheld by the FBI under the third agency rule, I am pleased

to provide the following.

The intelligence report in question is a compendium of

material relating to various Cubans who were reported to be
studying in the USSR under scholarships granted by the Cuban
government during the period from 3 March to 6 August 1967.
The report makes no reference to a Nestor Castellanos.

Of possible relevance is a reference to a Jose Castellanos,

in which it was indicated that he (Castellanos) was an engineering

post graduate from the Cuban Institute of Meteorology who was
* to specialize in hydro-meteorology at the Academy of Sciences and

who was scheduled. to depart (Cuba) on 27 April 1967 aboard a

Soviet ship. The foregoing is the only information contained

in the report relating to anyone surnamed Castellanos.
I hope you will find this information useful to your.
investigation.
: Sincerely,
John G. Kester

Special Assistant To
The Secretary
