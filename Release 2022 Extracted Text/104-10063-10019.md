1. A sensitive source has reported that one °« :
S;. EISENCHER of the Communist Party of the United States
of America (CPUSA) f his wife; and one Leon LNU/were
vacationing in Sochi, U.S.S.R., during August-September
1970.. (Comment: “-EJSENCHER is probably identical with
Sigmund EISENSCHER/(see your Milwaukee, Wisconsin,’
memorandum of 5 October 1970, Subject: Sigmund Gustav
EISENSCHER) ..: Leon LNU is probably ecentttes with Leon
LOVE ® ABureau file number 101- 5112). a

2.. According -to EISENSCHER the CPUSA has close to
14, -000 members ,* the. majority of whom are laborers.

Over 25 percent of the.members are blacks who function
basically in the North American black movement. The

Party has recently organized a young Communist movement. :.-

_ (Comment: This is probably the Young Workers Liberation

League.) .:The CPUSA participates heavily in the labor

movement. At a recent (unnamed) labor meeting of repre-
sentatives from various regions of the United States, the
CPUSA.had direct influence in 26 of the 50 unions repre-
sented. The-magazine Labor Party’plays an important role

.in-coordinating movenents within the labor ranks. Despite

numerous barriers (sic), the CPUSA is concentrating its
efforts in Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York, as well as
other regions of importance. The CPUSA has recently
adopted a common strategy towards the peace movement.
(Comment: . The indication here is’ that the Party did not .

bahahimminpeaed have a unified approach.)

: 3. EISENSCHER stated that criticisms of the Soviet
Union by the radical left Maoists, Fidelists, and Trot-
skyites cause problems, but they appear to have abated
somewhat. There has been a warming in the relations

_ between the CPUSA and the Communist Party of Cuba as a
