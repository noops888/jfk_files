Second Street, S.w.

Washington, D. C. 20515

Dear Mr. Fallis:

I have been advised by Ms. Sheila Lee, Staff Counselor, Select

Committee, to communicate with you regarding possible employment

by the committee.

Ms. Lee inquired as to my availability for possible full-time

work with the Select Committee.

I advised her because of my per-

sonal situation here, what with building a new house, etc.

would be extremely difficult for me to relocate to the Washington

area for an extended period of time.

However, I talked with Ms. Lee this morning and a suggestion was

made that I possibly could come to Washington and work for the

committee on a trial thirty-day period.

This would give me the

chance to evaluate the situation

and give your organization time to

evaluate me and my performance.

Should you wish to consider this type of arrangement, please ad-

vise and we shall explore this situation further. On that basis,

I will withhold any questions regarding salary, expenses, etc.;

until such time as you indicate whether the suggestion is amenable

to your particular operation.

Thanking you for your time and attention.
