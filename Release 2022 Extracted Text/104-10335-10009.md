Dear Ms. Denk:

Reference: (C) ARRB Request No. CIA-10, for information
on the Interagency Source Register

(U). The following is responsive to referent request.

(C) The Interagency Source Register| (ISR) is simply a
| dévice wheréby-agencies-within the intelligence community™
which recruit or deal with sources of foreign positive
intelligence outside the United States try to keep from |

bumping into’ each other in-the pursuit of such information.
It is for the further purpose of ensuring a source cannot
gain an unwarranted advantage by dealing with more than one
agency. Each agency is responsible for registering an
individual as a source with the ISR before using the
individual.

(C) The ISR was established in 1957 by the Intelligence
Advisory Committee, predecessor to the U.S. Intelligence
Board. The ISR was not used extensively during the years
1958- 1965 and we know of no system or procedure which took
its place. |

| (C) The first ISR regulations were in the form of
basic procedures each agency was to follow, procedures which
have gone through a number of reiterations. ARRB staff
members have reviewed the classified, current written
instruction “governing the Existence and use-of-the ISR ——
