I, PREFACE
A. Purpose of Paper
This paper has been prepared to compare the results
of the 1967-68 interrogations of YURI NOSENKO with a CIA
paper dated February, 1968, entitled "The Examination of

the Bona Fides of a KGB Defector."" This CIA paper was based

on previous interrogations of NOSENKO and concluded that

NOSENKO is not a bona fide defector ff) (4)

According to the paper, in arriving at this
conclusion the lengthy interrogations of NOSENKO, analysis
of KGB operations which he related and comparison of his.
assertions with collateral information from ether sources
were considered, Ku)

B. Background

For convenience in assessing these papers, the

following chronology of events is set forth: PRY UW) >
NOSENKO first made contact with CIA in Geneva in

June, 1962. After several meetings he returned to Russia

and was not again in contact with CIA until his return to @)
Geneva in January, 1964.. On his return to Geneva he ee

after his arrival in Moscow, fe

COMMENT : A number of previous CIA ‘conclusions
regarding this period were based on deficient =
interrogations of NOSENKO and inadequate
collateral inquiries. These conclusions have
been invalidated by current interrogation and
collateral inquiried and there is no substan-
tial basis for doubting NOSENKO's baste claims
regarding this period. SAC)

is alleged that NOSENKO did not indicate the sources from
which he obtained the information regarding the cases. 4)

During current interrogation NOSENKO provided sources
or logical explanation for his knowledge in sixteen of the
nineteen cases referred to above. He also provided adequate
clarification regarding three of the other five ¢ases which
ee subjects of CIA criticism. In addition a current review
of his notes by NOSENKO provided the translation "ECTOR",
instead. of "ACTOR" or proctor" | Peviousty obtained, as the
name of an agent. Collateral investigation has developed
a logical. suspect. by this name. (Logical suspects named :

which information was not obtained regarding
the sources for these cases were obviously

It is considered probable that the 1961
communication referred to by GOLITZYN is identical
with, or related to, data furnished by C jin (s)
1967 which. indicated KGB was emphasizing operations
against code clerks in 1961. The-contents of the
document made available by{—__jundoubteaty S)
emanated from JOHN DISCOE SMITH, a forter State
Department code clerk and erypta technietan-who
resigned in December, 1959, left. the United States
in:May.or June, 1960, and whose whereabouts. there- ae
after were. unknown until he. was publicized.as a i
defector by the Soviets: in.the. Fall -of .1967.;. Kw

In this. connection it is:not, clear how, GRYAZNOV
of the SCD would.have knowledge: of SMITH :in. the Spring
of 1960, If SMITH was. an agent prior to that:time he
would have been antagent.of FCD. .NOSENKO has. reported,
however, that..another friend of GRYAZNOV!s, NIKOLAY

The possibility exists that GOLITZYN obtained
information regarding the "real agent" from SKVORTSOV

rather than GRYAZNOV. SMITH could have arrived in

Moscow or otherwise have been in contact with
SKVORTSOV during the period April -. July, 1960,

1930's and before that had worked for the Young
Communist League in Leningrad. In the 1940's he

had worked for the Soviet "Embassy" in the USA and

1950's KGB stopped work with him as an agent and put his

file in the archives. He participated in many meetings |

and conferences relating to disarmament. In the late
1950's KGB started a "checking file" on him because cee
he was suspected of connections with American

Intelligence and there was a "signal" indicating - 3

a connection with the American diplomat (MARK. 5)
