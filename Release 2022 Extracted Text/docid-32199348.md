FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMETTTE

The April 6, 1960, edition of "The New York Times"
newspaper contained a full-page advertisement captioned
"What Is Really Happening in Cuba," placed by the Fair Play
for Cuba Committee (FPCC). This advertisement announced
the formation of the FPCC in New York City and declared the
FPCC intended to promulgate “the truth about revolutionary
Cuba" to neutralize the distorted American press.

. "The New York Times® edition of January 11, 1961,
reported that at a hearing conducted before the United States
Senate Internal Security Subcommittee on January 10, 1961,

Dr. CHARLES A. SANTOS-BUCH identified himself and ROBERT TABER
as organizers of the FPCC. He also testified he and TABER
obtained funds from the Cuban Government which were applied
toward the cost of the aforementioned advertisement.

On May 16, 1963, a source advised that during the
first two years of the FPCC's existence there was a struggle
between Communist Party (CP) and Socialist Workers Party (SWP)
elements to exert their power within the FPCC .and thereby
influence FPCC policy. ‘This source addéd that during the
past year there had been a successful effort by FPCC leadership
to minimize the role of these and other organizations in the
FPCC so that their influence as of May, 1963, was negligible.

The SWP has been designated by the Attorney
General of the United States pursuant to
Executive Order 10450,

On May 20, 1963, a second source advised that
VINCENT "TED" LEE, FPCC National Office Director, was then
formulating FPCC policy and had indicated that he had no
intention of permitting FPCC policy to be determined by any
other organization. This source stated that LEE believed
that the FPCC should advocate resumption of diplomatic
relations between Cuba and the United States and should
support the right of Cubans to manage their revolution without
interference from other nations. LEE did not advocate
supporting the Cuban revolution per se.

FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMIT™LE (cont'd.)

The November 23, 1963, edition of "The New York
Times" reported that Senator THOMAS J. DODD of Connecticut
had called FPCC "the chief public relations instrument of
the Castro network in tke United States." It is to be noted
that Senator DODD was a member of the Senate Internal
Security Subcommittee which twice conducted hearings on the
FPCC.

The December 27, 1963, edition of "The New York
World Telegram and Sun" newspaper stated that the pro-Castro
FPCC was seeking to go out of business and that its prime
activity during its lifetime had been sponsorship of pro-
Castro street rallies and mass picket lines, and the direction
of an active propaganda mill highlighting illegal travel-to-
Cuba campaigns. Its comparatively brief span of life was
attributed to mounting anti-Castro American public opinion,
the 1962 Congressional hearings which disclosed FPCC financing
by Castro's United Nations Delegation, md ultimately, the
bad publicity which the FPCC received from disclosure of
activities on its behalf by suspected Presidential assassin
LEE H. OSWALD. °

On February 6, 1964, the previousiy mentioned
second source advised that V. T. LEE had recently remarked
that the FPCC was dead and that there were no plans to ~
organize another similar organization.

On April 13, 1964, a third source advised that
there had not been any FPCC activity in many months and that
the FPCC had been dissolved.
