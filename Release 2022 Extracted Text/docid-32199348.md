FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTRE

00. от -010

The April 6, 1960, edition of "The New York Times"

newspaper contained a

full-page advertisement captioned

"What Is Really Happening in Cuba," placed by the Fair Play

for Cuba Committee (FPCC).

This advertisement announced

the formation of the FPSC in New York City and declared the

FPCC intended to promulgate "the truth about revolutionary

Cuba" to neutralize the distorted American press.

"The New York Times" edition of January 11, 1901,

reported that at a hearing conducted before the United States

Senate Internal Security Subcommittee on January 10, 1961,

Dr. CHARLES A. SANTOS-BUCH identified himself and ROBERT

TABER

as organizers of the FPCC.

He also testified he and TABER

obtained funds from the Cuban Government which were applied

toward the cost of the aforementioned advertisement.

On May 16, 1963, a source advised that during the

first two years of the FPCC's existence

there was a struggle

between Communist Party (CP) and Socialist Workers Party (SUP)

elements to exert their power within the FPCC and thereby

influence FPCC policy. This source added that during the

past year there had been a successful effort by EPCC leadership

to minimize the role of these and other organizations in the

FPCC so that their influence as of May, 1963, was negligible.

The SW has been designated by the Attorney

General of the United States pursuant to

Executive Order 10450.

On May 20, 1963, a second source advised that

VINCENT "TED" LEE, EPCC National Office Director, was then

formulating FPCC policy and had

indicated that he had no

intention of

permitting FPCC policy to be determined by any

other organization.

This source stated that LEE believed

that the FPCC should advocate resumption of diplomatic

relations between Cuba and the United States and should

support the right of Cubans to manage their revolution without

interference from other nations.

LEE did not advocate

supporting the Cuban revolution per se.

FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTLE (cont'a.)

The November 23, 1963, edition of "The New York

Times" reported that Senator THOMAS J. DODD of Connecticut

had called EPCC "the chief public relations instrument of

the Castro network in the United States." It is to be noted

that Senator DODD was a member of the Senate Internal

Security Subcommittee which twice conducted hearings on the

FPCC.

The December 27, 1963, edition of "The New York

World Telegram and Sun" newspaper stated that the pro-Castro

EPCC was seeking to go out of busiress and that its prime

activity during its lifetime had been sponsorship of pro-

Castro street rallies and mass picket lines, and the direction

an active propaganda mill highlighting illegal travel-to-

Cuba campaigns.

Its comparatively brief span of life was

attributed to mounting anti-Castro Anerican public opinion,

the 1962 Congressional

hearings which disclosed FPCC financing

by Castro's United Nations Delegation, and ultimately, the

Dad publicity which the FPCC received

from disclosure of

activities on its behalf by suspected Presidential assassin

LEE H. OSWALD.

On February 6, 1964, the previousiy mentioned

second source advised that V. T. LEE had recently remarked

that the FPCC was dead and that there were no plans to

organize another similar organization.

On April 13, 1964, a third source advised that

there had not been any

FPCC

activity in many months and that

the FPCC had been dissolved.
