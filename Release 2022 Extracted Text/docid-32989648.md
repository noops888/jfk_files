INTERNAL SECURITY - MISCELLANEOUS pop

This is to recommend that our field offices
prepare over-all quarterly reports on the New Left movement
in order that we can bring together all pertinent information
concerning this activity and be in a better position to
assess the movement's militancy and potential for violence.

The New Left movement is made up of numerous
organizations, temporary conferences and unaffiliated
individuals each promoting in varying degrees a strong,
anti-United States, violent, revolutionary position,

Although the field has conducted or is conducting investi-
gations of these individuals and organizations, there is need
to compile in a single investigative report a clear-cut
picture of the entire New Left movement which will identify
its leaders, sources of funds and propaganda outlets, and will
show the extent to which the New Left movement has been
influenced by domestic and foreign subversive elements,

Our plan is to have each office submit an initial
report by 12/1/68 and to thereafter submit reports on a
quarterly basis, f

RECOMMENDATION:

That the attached airtel with enclosures consisting
of report outline, subfile breakdown and reporting schedule
be sent to all offices ordering the preparation of these reports.

RE: NEW LEFT MOVEMENT

Within 30 days of receipt of this communication,
recipient offices are to advise under this caption the iden-
tities and file numbers of individuals to be included under
the expanded Key Activists Program on a UACB basis, Included
should be a brief statement relating the basis for designating
each individual as a Key Activist. At that time, under
individual case caption, a communication is to be forwarded
to the Bureau outlining what specific steps are being taken
to obtain adequate informant coverage of the individual.

It is expected the Key Activists Program will be
given intensive investigative attention and close supervision
by participating offices, You should be continuously alert
to recommend additions or deletions where warranted and not
wait for the Bureau to call to your attention the need to
inelude an active, obvious leader of New Left activities in
your division, Such communications should set out Key Activist
in parentheses after the character and contain adequate justi-
fication for recommended action, Key Activist should hot,
however, be used in the caption of any communication prepared
for dissemination, These individuals will be included in the
Security Index in Priority 1.

* To insure that the Bureau is kept abreast of the
day-to-day activities of the individuals designated as Key
Activists, each office must maintain high level informant
coverage on them as well as the organizations they are
affiliated with to develop information regarding their sources
of funds, foreign contacts and future plans. Live informant
coverage of these individuals and groups is absolutely essential
and is expected to receive priority attention. You shouid
explore all avenues of investigative coverage and submit any
recommendations under appropriate case caption for consideration
by the Bureau, .

All investigative matters pertaining to the New Left
movement are being closely followed by the Bureau. Key Activists
are considered to be of primary investigative importance and
cursory handling of these cases will not be tolerated, The
overall objective of this Program is to render Key Activists
ineffective and thereby radically restrict their influence and
the effectiveness of the New Left movement, in order to obtain
the desired results, it 1s expected intensive, aggressive
investigation will be afforded these cases,

RE: WEW LEFT MOVEMENT

It is imperative to note the shift to violence
in the New Left movement, Sabotage, arson, bombing and a
varioty of obstructive tactics have been openly advocated
during the past year. In September, 1968, within a five-day
period three ROTC establishments were sabotaged and a fourth
threatened, In addition, a Central Intelligence Agency office
at Aun Arbor, Michigan, was bombed during that month. These
instances of openly made plans for violence and the brazen
follow-through of action are examples of the problems facing
the Bureau in this field and the absolute need for intensive
investigative efforts in these matters, Successful prosecution
is the best deterrent to such unlawful activity. Intensive
investigations of Key Activists under this Program are logically
expected to result in prosecutions under substantive violations
within the Bureau's investigative jurisdiction,

NOTE:

The Key Activists Program was initiated to afford
critical cases close supervision to insure intensive
investigation by the field, Success with this Program
warrants broadening its scope. The above instructions are
to bring about an expanded Key Activists Program to afford
closér supervision of critical cases working toward making
these persons ineffective and impairing the New Left movement.

INTERNAL SECURITY ~ MISCELLANEOUS

Yhe Bureau has noted increasing evidence of a
continuing upsurge on the part of militant individuals and age
organizations to separate themselves from legitimate protest ‘
activities and to adopt a strong, anti-United States, violent,
revolutionary position, These activities are commonly referred
to as the New Left movement, The term "New Left" does not
refer to a definite organization, but to a movement which is
providing ideologies or platforms alternate to those of existing
communist and other basie revolutionary organizations, the
so-called "Old Left." The New Left movement is a loosely~bound,
free-wheeling, college-oriented movement spearheaded by the
Students for a Democratic Society and includes the more extreme
wand militant anti-Vietnam war and antidraft protest organizations.
whe militant leadership of these organizations appears determined
s-o continue to stage militant demonstration activities designed
vimarily to effect confrontation with authority, particularly
ith the Federal Government.

Although the field has conducted, or is conducting,
investigations of these individuals and organizations, there is
. a need to compile in a single investigative report a clear-cut
4 f& picture of the entire New Left movement which will identify its

leaders, sources of funds and propaganda outlets, and will show

New Left movement so that we may expand and intensify our
investigation of those phases indicating a need thereof,

It will also serve to alert Government officials concerning
the nature and extent of this aspect of subversive activities
and will provide a comprehensive study of the whole movement
from which its dangerousness to the national security can be
assessed,

In order to obtain this picture, a program is being
instituted immediately to prepare quarterly reports on the
over-all New Left movement throughout the United States,
Chicago is being designated office of origin and seven copies
of ali reports should be submitted by each field office. The
initial report, which should be submitted to reach the Bureau
by 12/1/68, will cover approximately the past two years of the
New Left movement. Yt will include information heretofore
reported under various titles and, of course, there will continue
to be a reporting of this type of information under various
other titles, After submission of the initial report, future
reports will be submitted on a quarterly basis according to
the enclosed schedule.

The initial report in this matter and succeeding
reports will be designed to precisely speli out the full extent
of the New Left movement, I¢ will separate words and intentions
from actions, mere participation from direct influence and the
bona fide activist from the mere "doxgooder," Offices which
have absolutely no information to report, either in the initial
report or the quarterly reports thereafter, will be permitted
to so advise the Bureau by Letter in lieu of a report,

The enclosed report outline should be followed as to
the numbered and lettered items, Where further breakdowns by 7
numbers and letters are practical, it will be permissible to
do so. The synopsis should be prepared for the purpose of ~
providing a complete summary from which the strength of the
movement in each field office territory can be quickly determined
and a conclusion drawn by the reader as to the movement's over=_
all militancy and potential for violence, Make certain the
synopsis is factual and supported by data in the details, a

Subfiles have been opened for each office and for
each topic, All communications and sections of the report
should refcr to the appropriate subfiles which are shown in
the enclosed subfile breakdown,

PURPOSE:

This is to recommend that our field offices conduct
a survey concerning publications of the New Left movement in
order to (1) provide for a centralized reporting of New Left
propaganda efforts, (2) to enable us to keep abreast of
current New Left activity in order that we may take advantage
of situations which could embarrass the New Left and (3) to
facilitate the necessary evaluation and analysis of New Left
propaganda at the Seat of Government.

BACKGROUND:

The New Left movement uses propaganda for various
reasons ranging from morale boosting to the generation of
public resentment of Government policy and action, There is
an urgent need to afford New Left propaganda efforts close
attention and a survey of this nature will be of great value
not only to the Seat of Government but to the individual field
offices in providing an over-all picture of New Left propaganda.

RECOMMENDATION:
That the attached letter to all offices be approved,

‘INTERNAL SECURITY - MISCELLANEOUS

One of the most important aspects in our current
investigation of the New Left movement involves the movement's
propaganda activities. We must afford this phase of New Left

ae efforts close attention so that we can keep abreast of current
7 New Left activities, take advantage of situations which could
embarrass the New Left movement and counter New Left propaganda.
In this connection, the prompt, accurate submission of
newspaper clippings is also essential ‘to the Bureau's keeping
promptly informed on these matters. s

With the foregoing as a background to underscore the
importance of this matter, the Bureau desires that all offices
immediately initiate a detailed survey concerning New Left-type
publications being printed and circulated in your territories |
on a regular basis. This will include both the official SESELOnREaEn
publications of New Left movement organizations as well as the
‘anarchist-type underground newspapers which are being printed
on a regular basis. Your survey should set forth information

Data developed should be set forth in a comprehensive

publications in your territory may be quickly grasped,

It will be your responsibility to secure and
carefully veview issues of New Left-type publications in
your territory and to take appropriate action on each article
of pertinence, It will, of course, be your decision as to
whether the pertinence of the information is such that the
Bureau should be immediately advised or whether it should be
merely included in the publications section of the next report
on the New Left movement.

Following this survey, which should reach the Bureau
by 11/26/68, each office should critically appraise its knowledge
of New Left-type publications within its division and should
comment specifically on the desirability and necessity of
instituting an investigation of any of these publications under
the provisions of Section 87E, Manual of Instructions.

You should also submit your recommendation concerning
publications which should be furnished the Bureau on a regular

7 is Further evidence of the violent nature of the
pe Weatherman leaders is shown by the attempted bombing of Detroit
,/Police facilities.on_3/6/70. by Weathermadpersonnel. led, by,Bill
Ayers, Another example of New Left violence is the threa_bombihgs
in New York City on_3/12/70 by a group calling itself "Revolutionary

OBSERVATIONS: It is imperative the field be made fully cognizant

of the importance of our investigations of all aspects of suspected
Weatherman activity, including bombings, arson, and locating
Weatherman individuals and leaders, The ident: on_of,
Weatherman communes and locating activists in t ke readily
available a suspect list for our use or the use of,local authorities,
where we have no jurisdiction, in instances of bombings and arson;
and in the event the Federal indictments are retumed in Chicago,
such a list would facilitate locating them as fugitives,

Because of the known violent nature of the Weatherman
faction, including extensive use of bombings and reported purchases
of firearms and ammunition, it is considered imperative, for the

| safety of “Agent personnel, that the field utilize a caution state-
ment on all Weatherman organization correspondence and on all
correspondence under individual captions concerning Weatherman
personnel, A suitable caution statement would be, "All Weatherman
personnel should be considered dangerous because of their known

| savocacy and use of explosives, reported acquisition of firearms,
and known propensity for violence,"

Students for a Democratic Seciety (SDS) leaders and activists
implemented their plans to go underground and form commando~
type units to engage in bombing, arson and assassination as
political weapons to bring about the revolution. PEER

On March G, 1970, two large undetonated bombs were
ocated in Detroit, Michigan, police facilities. Weatherman
activists were known to have planned to bomb these facilities.
tun March 6, 1970, a tremendous explosion destroyed the

having the wreckage, Theodore Gold, a known Weatherman
stivist was found dead in the wreckage and two other
unidentified bodies have also been found. On March 12, 1970,
three bombs caused extensive damage to three commercial
buildings in New York City. A group identifying itself as
"Revolutionary Force 9" claimed credit for these bombings.
Large quantities of explosives and quantities of firearms
have reportedly bsen purchased by Weatherman activists.
Evidence has also been developed that Weatherman recruiting
is taking place among Venceremos Brigade travelers to Cuba.

To secure approval for an SAC letter which authorizes
Special Agents in Charge or, in theirabsence, Assistant a
.Agents in Charge, to discuss matters relating to New Left
extremism in presently scheduled and future closed ana g)
and conferences with, local police officers.

BACKGROUND: . _

The following is set forth in response to suggesti ns
from several Special Agents in Charge and participants in the
recent New Left Movement Conference held on 9/10-11/70 that the
topic of New Left extremism be included in scheduled and future
law enforcement conferences and meetings, where attendance is
restricted to police, prosecutors and the judiciary.

x

Current Bureau policy concerning speeches by Special
Agents in Charge or Assistant Special Agents in Charge on
New Left matters is set forth in SAC Letter 70-8 dated 2/10/70
captioned "Speech Matters ~ New Left." This directive states
that Special Agents in Charge or Assistant Special Agents in
Charge cannot accept speeches on the subject of communism, and
this policy was to be followed in reference to speeches on the
subject of the New Left. The SAC Letter continues that in the

spread participation in briefings for local law enforcement
people and that requests for Seat of Government speakers should
be held to a minimum and submitted only in connection with
appearances before command-level law enforcement administrators,

\ 7 An exception to this policy was made, however, in
September, 1969, at which time Special Agents in Charge were

permitted to include material relating to the activities of
New Left extremists in their presentations at the 1969 Annual
Law Enforcement Conferences, which concerned extremist groups
and violence. These presentations were exceptionally well
received and served, to alert law enforcement officials through-
out the country to tne. threat posed by New Left extremists.

OBSERVATIONS :

7 Many New Left extremists and extremist groups have
now assumed a posture of criminality which dictates that all
levels of law enforcement tonsider tem for what they are--
criminals. They have directed their attacks, which includes
arson and bombing, ainst police and police installations
from coast to coast and Haye participated in bank robbery. There

.',is little doubt that local ‘law enforcement is as concerned with
these elements and the threat they present to our society as
with any other police hazard. Our field personnel have
reported that local police are looking to us for briefings
regarding New Left individuals and groups who are dedicated
to violence, terrorism and disruption. Our 1970 Annual Law
Enforcement Conferences deal with bombings and bomb threats,
and some Special Agents in Charge have requested permission
to include at these conferences a discussion or briefing
regarding New Left terrorists, including those who are Bureau

. fugitives. . a y

It is believed we should permit the Special Agent in
Charge, or the Assistant Special Agent in Charge, to brief
se lected groups of local law enforcement command and supervisory
personnel regarding New Left extremists, extremist groups
and violence, such as Students for a Democratic Society and

(B) NEW LEFT AND BLACK EXTREMIST TERRORISM - INFORMANT
COVERAGE -- You have heen advised in the past of the growing incidents
of terroristic acts by the New Left and black extremists and the need

for intensification of our investigations and development of new sources
to combat these escalating problems.

However, a review of the New Left Movement - Violence
airtels submitted monthly by each field office indicates generally that
your informant coverage of terrorist organizations and individuals is
grossly inadequate.

You are, therefore, instructed to immediately institute
an aggressive policy of developing new productive informants who can
infiltrate the ranks of terrorist organizations, their collectives,
communes and staffs of their underground newspapers. The Bureau
fully recognizes that the development of sources to penetrate these
groups is made extremely difficult because of their immoral conduct
and use of drugs. It calls for initiative and new approaches to develop
the needed intelligence information.

Concerning black extremists, it is essential that quality
informants are developed at a regular rate. These informants shouid
be the type who can obtain advance information concerning planned

.acts of violen¢e or who are in a position to furnish information concern-

ing contemplated acts of violence.

You should include in Item 4 of your monthly airtel on
"New Left - Violence; Internal Security - Miscellaneous (Weatherman) ,"
as outlined in Bureau airtel to all offices May 13, 1970, constructive
plans to implement the program outlined above concerning New Left
terrorist organizations through informant development. Recommendations
relating to the development of a specific source or plan of action should
be submitted to the Bureau by separate communication.

SAC LETTER 70-48 -3-

(C) SECURITY AND RACIAL INFORMANTS -- Never in our history have
we been confronted with as critical a need for informant coverage. Ter-
roristic violence surrounds us and more has been threatened. Bombings,
assassination of police officers, kidnapping and murder are all part of
the picture. Fanatics are at large who are at war with the Government
and the American people. Particularly critical is the need for reliable
information about the activities of violence-oriented youthful groups on
campus.

As you are aware, you have been previously instructed not
to use campus student informants under the age of 21. In view of cur-
rent circumstances, you are authorized to develop student security and
racial informants who are 18 years of age or older. This presents you
with a tremendous opportunity to expand your coverage, which is
expected. However, in no way are your obligations to exercise
selectivity and tight control lessened in this most sensitive area.

The tragic, violent aftermath of violence and destruction
on our campuses following the President's speech on Cambodia is
a clear warning of the impact cf New Left terrorist philosophy
and advocacy of street action, The ability of radical activists
to seize a controversial issue and whip up violent reaction
among large crowds is agzin demonstrated. The threat to the
Nation's ability to function io a crisis situation posed by
New Left extremists has never been more clearly drawn. This
grave threat requires immediste and positive steps be taken to
fulfill our responsibilities for protection cf the internal
security of the Nation. Implementation of our intensified
ihvestigations of New Left terrorism along the above lines within
the limitations of available manpower is imperative.

RECOMMENDATION: The attached airtel to the field be approved to
Begin rapid implementation of intensified investigations of New
Left terrorism, briefly indicating steps the Bureau is taking
along the above lines to permit reassignment of manpower. It
aiso instructs the field tosubmit by 6/15/70 an assessment of
their manpower situation at that time.

For purpose of investigations of these individuals, {
New Left terrorist is described as one who adheres to Weatherman] ., _
ideology of advocating a Marxist-Leninist revolution now and Var
uses terroristic tactics in furtherance of revolution. Activist
may or may not belong to an organization which adheres to this
idsology. Using this definition, an arrest during course of a
violent Weatherman action, such as "National Action" held in
Chicago in October, 1969, gives reason for rebuttable presumption
that arrested person is adherent to Weatherman ideology of
violeace and revolution described above. Mere denial of
adherence to Weatherman ideology during interview would not be
adequate rebuttal. Because of serious consequences to public
safety involved, extensive and exhaustive investigation to aa
positively disprove such adherence to Weatherman ideology must
exist prior to closing any investigation. a > : ,)

If individual resides in communal existence follow instructions
concerning these investigations set forth in retel. Determine
the source of income of these individuals. Valuable information
May come from establishing close liaison with local police
sources who have interest in these individuals because of their
propensity for violence and increased use of narcotics.

Consider all individuals falling in categories noted

for inclusion in Priority I of Security Index unless investigation

dictates otherwise. Advise Bureau of your reasoning if not

included. If individuals arealready on Security Index, you must

have established sources who can closely follow their current

whereabouts, Advise Bureau by letter every 45 days of individuals

in Priority I of Security Index, in these categories, of their
ete . current residence and any other pertinent information developed.

Consider all individuals defined previously for interview
during investigation. Adhere to Bureau instructions concerning
| . interviews of security subjects. Purpose of interviews is three~
| foid; to determine their cooperativeness with FBI, to possibly
develop them as informants and to ascertain if they have any
knowledge of Weatherman members currently wanted under the
Unlawful Flight to Avoid Prosecution warrants.

Yo facilitate handling at Bureau, all reports and other
communications on individuals falling within defined categories
will include the name Weatherman in the character whether or not
he is a Weatherman member, e.g.: SM - SDS (Weatherman), SM - ANA
(Weatherman) and SM ~ C (Weatherman). Bureau expects close coopera~
tion among all offices, and while one office may be considered
office of origin, any office with leads must handle same promptly
and efficiently.

Bureau will not tolerate a lackadaisical approach to
this matter. Potential propensity for violence by individuals
adhering to violent tactics of Weatherman group makes it our
responsibility to keep on top of situation. Agent personnel
must be aware of possible criminal violations on part of these
individuals and submit communications to Bureau under appropriate
caption if warranted. If local warrants are issued on these
individuals and facts are present, consider contacting local law
enforcement agencies to determine if there is justification for
pete entering case under Unlawful Flight to Avoid Prosecution
statute,

Problem of New Left violence and terrorism is serious
one and is growing. We must handle it at this time with existing
personnel complement of Bureau. As rapidly as possible begin
shifting personnel to this work from other work areas, except
for personnel specifically designated for organized crime work,
with emphasis on accomplishing necessary objectives rather than
desirable ones, Closely scrutinize work load fluctuations and
changes in your office. To secure manpower a continuing study
is being made at Bureau and by Inspection Staff to curtail work
requirements and streamline. Refer to SAC Letter 70~-25(B),
5/5/70. Major changes are contemplated around 7/1/70 in handling of
ITSMV and Deserter matters to enable more significant diversion
of manpower. Instructions will be forthcoming on this.

PRE ee

: PURPOSE: hae

To obtain authority for the attached airtel 7 the
field requesting financial information concerning New Left
groups.

BACKGROUND:

| By memorandum C, D., Brennan to W. C. Sullivan, dated

| 11/7/69, the Director approved a letter to all offices pointing
out the recurring allegations that various tax exempt charitable
foundations have contributed large sums of money, directly or
indirectly, to the Movement. It was also pointed out similar
allegations recur concerning financial "angels."" The field was
instructed to be particularly alert to such allegations and any
information developed along such lines should be promptly reported
to the Bureau with recommendations as to whether additional
investigation is warranted.

\ By letter dated 2/26/70, in response to a specific

' request, we furnished the White House with material concerning -
| income sources of revolutionary groups. Such an inquiry is

{ etndicative of the high-level interest in the financial aspects
of revolutionary activity. ;

Because of the sensitive nature of any direct intensive
financial investigation of large foundations or funds, prominent
wealthy individuals who limit their activities to financial
support, or politically oriented-groups such as the Vietnam
Moratorium Committee, embarrassment to the Bureau would likely
result. It must also be noted such financial support is so
diyerse as to frequently be in the form of furnishing bail money
to persons jailed during Peart purchase of eeu AB

RE: NEW LEFT MOVEMENT ~ FINANCES

and underwriting costs of large rallies or meetings. Such
aid rarely would be picked up in our review of bank records
of the organizations involved,

OBSERVATIONS :

In order to put these recurring allegations into
perspective and be in position to be responsive to future
high-level inquiries along this line, it would be desirable
to obtain from the field a comprehensive survey of known
instances of financial aid by foundations or funds, prominent
or wealthy individuals, or politically oriented groups, at
the same time it would be a propitious instance to reiterate
the Bureau's interest in these matters on a continuing basis.

RECOMMENDATION :

The attached airtel to the field be forwarded
containing instructions along the above lines.

(c) SEW LEFT MOVEMENT” POLICE TRAINING MATTERS -- Recent
developments involvitig Vidlence caused by New Left terrorists have
increased requests from the field for qualified speakers to appear before
selected local law enforcement officials to discuss New Left extremism
and violence. This subject matter was included in the 1969 Annual Law
: Enforcement Conferences and the presentations were highly successful.
co The Bureau, therefore, will consider requests from the field for Special’
Agents in Charge or, in their absence, Assistant Special Agents in
Charge to brief local law enforcement command and supervisory
,personnel regarding New Left extremism and violence at law enforcement
meetings and conferences where attendance is restricted to full-time,
duly constituted law enforcement officers.

In such appearances, you should restrict your comments to
_ information appearing in the document, "Youth in Rebellion, " previously
/ 4 provided to each office, to information available to each office in its New
Left quarterly reporis, and to data provided by the Bureau.

Any briefings or speeches scheduled for local law enforce-
ment officials regarding New Left extremism and violence should be
reported in advance to the Bureau, utilizing Form FD-132, and your
letter should clearly justify the desirability of the presentation and
should stipulate that all in attendance will be full-time, duly constituted
law enforcement personnel. Each such appearance will be examined closely
to determine if it is justified and will be worthwhile.

Very truly yours, .
John Edgar Hoover.

Conference to Mr. Tolson recommended that investigation be ie
initiated of individual members of the SDS and members of
procommunist New Left campus organizations who follow SDS
\

At the end of the 1969-70 academic year the

faction, had a membership of about 2,500 individuals. The
procommunist New Left-type campus organizations have a
membership of about 4,000. The purpose of the investigations
of these individuals is to determine the propensity for violence
by members of the above organizations. Attached is an airtel
to all offices advising of investigation of all members of
the SDS and militant New Left campus organizations.

In order that the Bureau remain aware of the number
of such cases handled by the field,.the field is being

SPECIAL BLACK NATIONALIST CONFERENCES 1
FEBRUARY 29, MARCH 1, AND MARCH 4-5, 1968 1

: 1

The recently-held racial intelligence Gontonanas
noted the fact that various black nationalist organizations
frequently call conferences or conventions of various types,
some on a regional and some on a national basis, Some
conferences are called for the purpose of forming new organi~
zations such as is the case in Detroit at the present time
where black nationalist leaders in that city have called for
a national conferenee in late March of this year for the
purpose of forming a Malcolm X society in honor of the late
Malxolm X Little, the militant black nationalist leader who
was killed in 1965,

The conference recommended that, based on submissions
‘from the field, the Bureau prepare and furnish all offices
on a monthly basis a calendar of scheduled racial events
~ throughout the country which are more than local in nature,
The conference felt that this would be beneficial in field
coverage of these events, noting the widespread travel on
the part of some black nationalists in attendance at various
conferences, s

It 1s believed that this suggestion is entirely
feasible, that in the Racial Intelligence Section we can
correlate this matter on the basis of information contained
in reguler corressondence from the field, and that it can be

This recommends that future monthly Racial Calendars
include all major scheduled affairs which gould logically
devetop” into a racial event’, :

Moore to Mr. W. C. Sullivan dated March 13, 1968, captioned f
"Special Black Nationalist Conference, September 29, March 1 {
and March 4-5, 1968; Black Nationalist Movement in the inn
United States,'' which established the procedure of sending a
monthly Racial Calendar to each continental field office. This
Racial Calendar sets forth the dates of black nationalist type
conferences and pertinent dates concerning racial events and
anniversaries for the coming month, The purpose of the Racial
Calendar is to assist the field in covering these events due
to the wide spread travel on the part of black nationalists to
attend these various conferences and take part in demonstrations“
commemorating certain dates,

s S- 5A AAV

It is frequently difficult to categorize pending
events as being strictly racial in nature. Cooperation between
black extremists and white subversives has been clearly portrayed
in recent months and continuing mutual assistance can be expected
during affairs of the antifascist , antidraft and anti-Vietnam
variety. For example, a demonstration organized by white
subversives can easily ae into a racial event.

The Director previously approved a memorandum GG. )

It is believed We" and oS ekte the Racial Calendar
to include major conferences, demonstrations and similar affairs
which are not racial matters but whichcould-devehop -inté same.

Reference is made to my memorandum of May 16, 1974
providing you with our opinion that investigation by the
FBI of the Nation of Islam (NOI) should continue. In the
interim we have had an opportunity to further consider whether”
the NOI's activities appear to violate certain statutes such Y
as Title 18, United States Code, Sections 231, 233 (Civil
bisorders); 241, 245 (Conspiracy to Deprive and Deprivation of
Civil Rights); and 2101 and 2102 (Riots).

Executive Order 10450 until the question of the continuation
of the Attorney General's list was resolved. On June 4, 1974// 5!
the President signed Executive Order 11785, which abolished a
the list and prohibited its use by any agency of the Gover Cf
ment. However, Section 8(a)(5) of Executive Order 10450, aq
revised by “Executive Order 11785 > requires that investigatidd Ss

to whether the continued investigation of the NOI is appro=

has recommended continued investigation for the reasons set
forth in my May 16 memorandum and on the basis of potential
violations of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2101 and 2102 (Riots).

Accordingly, continued investigation of this group is
warranted because its ‘xeported activities appear to come
within the criteria of Executive Order 10450, may involve
“potential Violations of .18 U:S.C. §§ 2101 and 2102 (Riots)
‘and, finally, represent a potential threat to the public

{ sugjecT: NOI - Extremist Matter

Reference is made to your letters of June 8, 1973,
August 6, 1973, and October 4, 1973, to me in which you
requested an opinion as to whether activities of the Nation
of Islam (NOI) come under the criteria of Executive Order, wih.
10450, whether any federal statutes had been violated and /2 47)
whether the investigation of the NOI should be continued ii
along current lines. A review has been made of pertinent
FBI reports of the activities of the organization, its
members and activities, and consultations have been held & 2
with members of your staff. As a result, it is our opinion’
that, for the time being, investigation of the NOI should

continue.
With respect to your specific questions, although our}
‘ review of FBI reports indicates that NOI may have engaged /
in activities which deprive citizens of constitutional
rights, and, therefore, it would come within the criteria
of Executive Order 10450, the Department is currently
reviewing the Attorney General's list for the purpose of
determining whether its continued existence is warranted.
Therefore, I do not think it advisable to base continued
investigation of the NOI on Executive Order 10450, until
this question is resolved,

-administered by this Division as to whether NOI's activities
should be investigated in light of statutes over which they,
and we, have jurisdiction.

A basi; for continued investigation was described by
Deputy Ass stant Attorney General Kevin T. Maroney when he
testified »efore the Committee on Internal Security of the
House of epresentatives on February 20, 1974. He pointed
out, inte : alia, that without a broad range of intelligence
informat: mn, the President and the departments and agencies
of the Executive Branch could not properly and adequately
protect our nation's security and enforce the numerous
statutes pertaining thereto. There is, in our view,
sufficient evidence to indicate that certain NOI members
have been involved in disturbances and attacks on police
throughout the country as noted in reports disseminated
to the Department of Justice, other executive agencies and to
the Secret Service in connection with its responsibility for
the *rotecliou of the DP: ident. Under these cirammstancas,
I feel the Department, and in particular the Attorney General,
must continue to be informed of those organizations that engage
in violence which represent a potential threat to the public
safety. Therefore, continued investigation of this group is
warranted.

If, during the course of your investigation, information
is developed that the NOI has changed its tactics and
objectives, and has assumed an attitude of non-violence, you
should again consult with the Department to reassess the
basis for continuing the investigation. In the interim,

I will apprise you of our decision as to whether NOI's
activities appear to violate certain statutes, e.g., Title 18,
United States Code, Sections 231, 233 (Civil Disorders),

241, 245 (Conspiring to Deprive and Deprivation of Civil
Rights), and 2101’ and 2102 (Riots).

BACKGROUND:



Memorandum to Mr. B. S, Miller
Re: Nation of Islam
25-330971

NOI a $3 million noninterest loan and promised an additional $6
million of assistance, Qatar and Abu Dahbi have donated $100,000
and $125,000, respectively, and Kuwait has indicated it is
considering a $2 million gift,

We have conducted a continuous security-type investiga-
tion of the NOI since 1953, Periodically, and most recently on
July 12, 1966, we have requested the Department's opinion concern-
ing possible prosecution of the NOI under appropriate statutes
or its designation under Executive Order 10450, The Department
has repeatedly declined to take action against the NOI citing
lack of adequate evidence of specific acts by its leaders resulting
in force being utilized or violence occurring, as well as referring
to the quasi-religious nature of the NOI as a further deterrent to
successful prosecution, In view of the character and activities
of the NOI, the Department requested by memorandum July 28, 1966,
that the NOI continue to be the subject of active investigation
and that the Department be furnished the results for examination
for possible violation of Federal statutes and for possible
designation under the provisions of Executive Order 10450,

During the period April 2, 1973 - May 25, 1973, five
one week in-service sessions of specialized training in black
extremist matters were conducted at the FBI Academy for selected
representatives from each FBI field office except Anchorage and
Honolulu, It was the consensus of those attending these sessions
that the NOI certainly warrants our continued investigative
attention in view of its substantially increased potential for
violence inthe-past two years,

As a considerable period of time has transpired since
the Department's last request for investigation regarding the
NOI, and in view of the increased propensity for violence of this
group, it appears in the Bureau's best interests to seek a
decision from the Department as to whether a prosecutable violation
exists concerning the NOI-and as to the desirability of continuing
this investigation,

ete Civil No. 72 61156 - N.D, Dhinois

Recently a suit for refund of income taxes for
the years 1966 and 1967, was instituted in the United
States District Court for the Northern District of
illinois, by Muhammed Ali. The suit seeks recovery
of $97,048.68 for the years in question based upon
a claimed deduction for contributions made to the
Holy Temple of Islam or the Nation. of Islam. In
the earlier of the two years Muhammed Ali allegedly
made a substantial contribution to the organization
and then borrowed the money from it on the same day.
As to that transaction we, of course, are maintaining
that there was no true contribution and that the two
transactions effectively eliminate any claim of
deduction. As an alternative defense for the first
year, and as a defense in the second year as well,
we are also contending that the recipient organi-~
zation was not one to which deductibility contributions
could be made since, under the statute, part of its
earnings inured to the benefit of certain individuals,
namely its leader Elijah Muhammed and members of his
family. Evidence available to us-indicates that 7
organization funds were used to purchase homes, cars,
and other things for such ij viduals, ~" °° ao" bb

OBSERVAT TONS:

The Nation of Islam is an all-Negro semireligious

organization which advocates a doctrine of violent hatred i

of the United States Government and the white race. The :
organization is headed by Elijah Muhammad with headquarters cd
in Chicago, Illinois. We have conducted a continuous

security-type investigation of this organization since 1953.
Periodically, we have requested the Department's opinion

as to possible prosecution of the Nation of Islam under

appropriate statutes or designation under Executive Order
7 10450, most recently on January 31, 1964.

a The Department has repeatedly declined to take
action against the Nation of Islam, citing lack of specific
acts of force or violence by its leaders or members. The
Department makes repeated reference to the quasi-religious
nature of the Nation of Islam as a further deterrent to
successful prosecution. Recognizing the threat to the
internal security of the Nation posed by the Nation of Islam,
the Department has requested our investigation be continued
and the names of appropriate Nation of Islam officials be
included in our Security Index and that they be considered
for apprehension during a period of national emergency.

While no new information has been developed
concerning specific acts by its leaders to cause acts
of force or violence to be committed, voluminous
additional information has been furnished the Department
Since the last request for a Brosecutive opinion was made
on January 31, 1964,

The Department apparently has no intention of
authorizing prosecution of the Nation of Islam, in absence
of the Nation of Islam causing large-scale riots, or
, virtual insurrection. However, it appears to be in the
Bureau's best interests to put the Department on record
once again as to whether a prosecutable violation exists
concerning the Nation of Islam.

training in judo and karate, and in some instances with guns,

At every meeting the white man is characterized as a devil, a
snake who has tortured the Negro and always will; that this white
devil must be exterminated along with his black sympathizers;
that the white man was alloted by Allah, their Supreme power, a
certain period on this earth and this period is now up; that all
NOI members must await the signal from Elijah Muhammad to indicate
the beginning of the extermination of the white devils to make
room for a Negro takeover of the country; that such a signal
would be forthcoming momentarily. Moreover, the NOI leaders,
Elijah Muhammad and Malcolm X and others, preach that they must
have a part of the territory of the United States as their own
exclusive territory together with sufficient financial means

to set them up economically independent. At their meetings, the
NOI members denigrate the American flag and-advocate disobedience
of any law contrary to the beliefs of the Muslims.

This reported information, however, is insufficient
to prove a policy of advocacy or approval of the commission of
acts of force or violence to deny other persons their rights
under the Constitution of thé United States.

The activities reported must be shown to be more than
mere prophecies or utterances made with the hope of ultimate
attainment of their desired aims. For example, while teaching
that the white man must be exterminated they do not say by whom
or how, There should be available evidence to show that thc
advocacy or approval of the commission of acts of violence to deny
others their Constitutional rights is calculated to incite the
members to action now or in the foreseeable future.; Evidence
is needed to show the specific acts taken by particular individual
leaders in advocating or approving acts of force and violence;
not that “heads will roll in the streets", which could be merely
a prediction, but rather what specific plan of action, direction
or urging has been made to bring about such event; not the abstract
teaching that Allah will cause the desired event, but the concrete
steps taken by specific individual leaders to effectuate their
goals. It is fully realized that such evidence is not easily
obtained even if it exists; and finally there seems to be some
indication that the leaders are becoming more cautious in their
utterances.

For the past several years, we have been periodically

it be supplied with a prosecutive summary-report setting forth evidence

: - In previous opinions, the Department advised a review of the
activities of the NOI did not constitute violations of any Federal

The Department in the past has advised there is insufficient
evidence toe establish a violation of any statute of which

this Bureau has investigative jurisdiction; the organization
appears to have no program of action which reasonably would

be calculated to bring about the overthrow of the United States
Government; -the language of the leadership is more calculated
and designed to arotise hatred and antipathy against the white
rate as a race, rather than against the Government; there is
insufficient basis upon which to proceed against the NOE
pursuant to the provisions of Executive Order 10450, The
epartnent has advised, however, it desires security-type
investigation be conducted concerning the leaders of the organiza-
tion and/or its active participating members for consideration
for apprehension during the peried of a national emergency

and for inclusion in the SI.

In view of the continuing reports and memoranda
which have been furnished the Department since the date of
the last Departmmtal opinion expressed in this matter (1-25-62),
it is deemed advisable to cbtain an opinion at this time
with respect to possible prosecution of the NOI or designation

“CONFIDENT EAL—

This is in response to your memorandum of January 10,
1962, inquiring about’ the possibility of designation of the
captioned organization pursuant to the provisions of
Executive Order No. 10450, and asking whether its activities
are in violation of any federal statute.

An examination of the reports and memoranda pertaining
to the subject organization fails to disclose sufficient
evidence to warrant prosecutive action against the leaders
under the Smith Act and other related statutes, or to justify
| the institution of designation proceedings. The reasons
set forth in our memorandum of September 21, 1960, are
relevant to the present situation.

Because of the radical, semi-secret, and violent nature
of this organization, and the continuing tendency on the part
of some of its leaders to use language of implied threats
against the Government, we are asking the Bureau to continue
its investigation of the organization and its leaders.

Mr. J. Walter’ Yeagley

NOTE ON YELLOW:

For several years the NOI, an all-Negro, fanatically
antiwhite organization headquartered in Chicago, has been under
investigation and copies of reports and memoranda reflecting this
investigation have been furnished’ thé Department on a continuing
basis. The Department has been requested at-various times to
furnish an opinion as to whether the information furnished would

. Support prosecutive action against the NOI. The Department in
the past has advised there is insufficient evidence to establish
a violation of any statute of which this Bureau has investigative

. jurisdiction; the organizations appears to have no program of
action which reasonably would be calculated to bring about the ©
overthrow of the U. S. Government; the language of the leadership
is more calculated and designed to arouse hatred and autipathy
aginst the white race as a race, rather than against the Government;
there is insufficient basis upon which to proceed against the
NOI pursuant to the provisions of Executive Order 10450. The
Department has advised, however, it desires security-type in- -
vestigation be conducted concerning the leaders of the organiza-
tion and/or its active participating members for consideration
for apprehension during the period of a national emergency and
for inclusion in the Security Index.

In view of the continuing reports and memoranda which
have been furnished the Department since the date of the last
Departmental opinion expressed in this matter (9-23-60) it is
deemed advisable to obtain an opinion at this time with respect
to possible prosecution of the NOI or designation under
Executive Order 10450.

this is in reply to your memorandum to the Attorney General
dated September 9, 1960, inquiring about the possibility of pro~
secutive action against the leaders or designation of the captioned
organization under provisions of Executive Order No. 10450.

The available evidence concerning the activities of the
leaders and members of this organization falls far short of the

sort to the use of virulent and vicious language which would incite
the members to individual acts.of violence against the white race,
it is more calculated and designed to arouse hatred and antipathy
against the white race as. a race, rather than against the Government.
There is evidence of language which speaks of the destruction of
america, but is couched more in terms of prophecy and prediction,
often referring to the "War of Armageddon," than in terms of incite-
ment to action, Moreover, the First Amendment would require :

organization '. . . seeking to alter the form of government by {\,

NOL's advocacy of future violent’ reprisals’ “for alleged wrongs com-
mitted against one or more of its members," the evidence is
insufficient at this time to meet the criterion that it has adopted

During the past years there has been an exchange of
correspondence petween this Bureau and the Department concerning
what Legal action, if any, can be taken against this organization
and/or its members. Tho Department by various memoranda has advised
_that a review of this matter has disclosed there iv insufficient

. evidence to establish a violation of the Smith Act of 1940 or any
other statute of which this Bureau has investigative jurisdictions
has disclosed the organization appears to have no program of action
which reasonably would be calculated to bring about or attempt to
bring about the violent overthrow of the United States Government;
and has disclosed there is insufficient basis upon which to
proceed against this organization pursuant to the provisions of
Executive Order 10450. The Department from time to tino has advised
. that it desires that security-type investigations be conducted
concerning the leaders of the organization and/or its active
participating members for consideration for apprehension during
ra period of a national emergency and for inclusion in the Security

ndex. : :

In view of the extreme radical and violent nature of this
organization and its leaders I thought this matter should be called
to your attention in order that you may consider whether there is
any legal action that can be taken or whether the organization can
be designated pursuant to the provisions of Executive Order 10450,

Reference is made to the Current Intelligence Analysis
dated August 31, 1960, on Nation of Islam (NOI). The Director
-inquired, "Has the Dept ruled on the NOI or are they still

-[| ‘considering’ it? H."

The NOI is an all~Negro, violently antiwhite fanatical
“group. It has been under investigation for the Peat several years
to determine if its activities bring it within the purview of
“Executive Order 10450 or in violation of any other Federal statutes.
Copies of our investigative reports are furnished the Department
on a continuing basis. We have closely followed the Department
to obtain an opinion whether the NOI should be designated pursuant
‘to Executive Order 10450 or the activities of the NOI are in
; violation of any Federal statutes.

‘To date the Department has not ruled that the activities
| of the organization warrant designation or are in violation of an
NI] federal statute, The Department in memorandum dated May 17, 1960,
& however, advised it has been the Department's policy not to designate
;SS religiots or quasi-religious organizations; further, the fact that
«@\jthe NOI is.a quasi-religious organization does not immunize it from
.2Xbeing designated under Executive Order 10450 but complicates the case
goby adding the issue of religious freedom to other Constitutional
y problems involved. The Department advised they will continue to.
examine information furnished by the Bureau relative to designating
the NOI pursuant to Executive Order 10450,

‘the Department by memorandum August 23,. 19583 advised: (1) that
the Bureau should continue to conduct security investigations of the
leaders and active participating members of the NOI; (2) that an
individual review andevaiuation of the derogatory information on each
of the leaders and active participating members should be conducted
to determine whether as individuals they should be included in the

CONFIDENTIAL

This is with further reference to your memorandum :;
dated June 19, 1959, wherein you request to be advised if
whether any action against the Nation of Islam (NOI) is ia
contemplated under provisions of Executive Order No.
10450.

As you know, it has been the Department's policy
not tc designate religious or quasi-religious organi-
zations. On the other hand, the NOI's basic tenets make
this a potentially dangerous organization in any emergency ©
For this reason, extensive study and consideration was

given the Bureau reports with a view of determining whether
\ the NOI falls within the purview of Executive Order No.
10450. :

As you have been previously advised, the designation
of NOI poses a number of legal problems. For example, the
inclusion of NOI under the category that it is an organi-~
zation" ... . seeking to alter the form of Government of
the United States by unconstitutional means", has been
determined to be inapplicable inasmuch as the language
used ‘by Elijah Muhammed and his ministers seeks to arouse
hatred and antipathy against the white race as a whole,
rather than seeking to alter the form of government, and
any language concerning the destruction of the government
usually has been couched in terms of prophecy or prediction
rather than in terms of incitement to action in the fore-
seeable future.

It has also been determined that there is insufficient
basis upon which to proceed against the NOI under any other.

doubtedly be reviewed by the courts not only from this as- i
pect, but also from the "freedom of religion" clause of the ;

reasons of which you have been apprised in our previous

Because of the repeated acts of disrespect to-

the NOI constituted an oryahization which should be considered a poten-

however, pon review of available evidence for use in administrative and
judicial, proceedings, it appears that the proof does not warrant either
Hesignation of the organization under 8.0. 10450 or institution of pro-

eedings pursuant to the provisions of the Smith Act of 1940. It was;
the Department's decision that designations pursuant to B.0. 10450,“
particularly in the case of religious or quasi-religious organizations,
should not -be made except upon the basis of evidence which can be
_ disclosed publicly in proceedings whenever the organization demands a
hearing under the existing rules promulgated by the Attorney General.
the Department requested that the Bureau continue to conduct security
type investigations of the leaders and active participating members of
the organization pursuant to the Security Index Program as well as i
investigation of the organization itself. We have continued to investi-

on a continuing basis with copies of reports concerning all investiga-
. tions.

As of 6/15/59 there were 400 NOI members on the Security

‘{ Index. The Department has recognized that this organization has El
dangerous potentiality as it accepts the fact that members of NOT i
should be on Security Index. In an emergency through the Emergency
Detention Program the effectiveness and operations of this organization
would be destroyed through the apprehension of its key members. On
1/11/56 we presented the facts of this case to the Department to see if
legal action could be taken, including placing the NOI on the Attorney
General's list of subversive organizations (pursuant to H.0.10450). ‘The
Department replied by memorandum 2/7/56 that the organization does not
werrant designation under &.0. 10450 or consideration under the Smith Act
of 1940. It is noted that we could expect considerable difficulty in |
producing witnesses to clearly depict the violent nature of this organi-
ization at any administrative hearing because we have gained most of our -
information from live Negro informants who would be extremely loathe to ‘
testify publicly because of the inherent physical danger from other members

i of the organization and ostricism.by other members of their race.

ACTION:

Despite the above, there is attached for your approval a letter
which raises again with the Department the question of possible legal
action against the NOI.

_Assistant Attorney General William F. Tompkins

With regard to the current use of the name

Nation of Islam as the title of this organization, Elijah
i Muhammad, in January, 1957, referred to his.organization
i- as the "Nation of Islam" and "“tuhammad's Temples of

Islam" and approved the afore-mentioned names as being

descriptive of his organization on a national basis.

Since the Nation of Islam and the Muslim Cult of Islan

are one and the same organization, in all instances where

informants have in the past furnished information relative

to the Muslim Cult of Islam and membership therein, such

information in the future will be attributed to the Nation

of Islam and membership therein. Likewise, the Fruit of

Islam and membership therein have the same relationship to

. the Nation of Islam as they had to the Muslim Cult of Islam,

As you know, this Division has had under review FBI pace
on the Muslim Cult of Islam since receipt of your memorandum to me of

The review wes being conducted with a view toward making a
determination as to whether or not the Muslim Cult of Islam should be
designated by the Attorney General, and also the effect the reported
membership in this organization would have on tie consideration of whe-
, ther an individual should be listed on the Security Index.

The memorandum to me of March 25, 1957, captioned "Emergency
Detention Program enclosed a copy of an FBI report dated March 12,
a 1957, at Atlanta captioned "James Alfred Martin, Jx., was" and bore the
i character "Security Matter--NOI." The first paragraph of the details
of this report reflects the following: "On January 21 and January 22,
1957, Confidential Informant Atlanta T-1, who has furnished reliable
information in the past, advised that the organization formerly referred
to as the ‘Muslim Cult of Islam' has been described by ELIJAH MUHAMMAD,
the national leader, as the ‘Nation of Islam! and/or#'Muhammad's_ Temples |
£ Islam!. The character of this case is therefore being. “changed “from
‘TSHCURTTY MATTER - MCI' to ‘SECURITY MATTER - nor."

It is not clear if your Bureau intends to , substitute the Nese
Nation of Islam" for the "Muslim Cult of Islam“ on the sole basis of 7
fete description furnished to Atlanta Informant T-1, nor is it clear wae
ther the “Muslim Cult of Islam" is no longer in existence.

If it is intended that the Nation of Islam be a substitute for
the Muslim Cult of Islam, it would be appreciated if you would ccettatal

mining whether a review of opinions previously rendered, in which the
Muslim Cult of Islam and membership therein was a factor, is necessary.

In comection with a recent review of the
files of the Philadelphia Haval Shipyard relating ee
_ Andrew Sohuson, the following was noted:

‘Prier to Johnson's resignation consideration |

was given by the employing agency to affording Johnson
a hearing on the basis of his meubership in the Muslim
Gult of Islaw. In this connection, the Assistant
Seoretary of the Navy in charge of personnel by Letter

, advised the Personnel Relations Office at the Philadelphia
Naval Shipyard that membership in the Muslim Gult of
Islam alone was not basis enough to hold a security hearing
as it was the opinion of the Lesal Departmont of the Secretary
of the Navy that the Muslim Cult of Islam was-a religious
orgenization, was founded as a religious organization, and not
an organization to overthrow the Government. It was also
stated that the organization had not been included on the
Attorney Genoralts list and there was no indication that it was
connected with the Communist Party. For these reasons the
Personnel Section at the Navy Yard was ordered by the Sere eae
of the Navy to discontinue the investigation of Johnson.

With further weference to the ‘Yaslin Cult of tdiam

it is noted in your memorandum to this Bureau dated February 7,
1956, entitled "program for Apprehension and Detention of
Persons Considered Potentially Dangerous to the Hational

' Defense and Publie Safety of the United States," you advised
that it appsared thet the teachings of the Cult would
constitute that organization a potentially dangerous
instrumentality in the event of a national emergency. It
was pointed out that from a review of available evidence for

(Beers use in administrative or judicial proceedings, however, it

- appeared thet the proof did not warrant either designation
of the organization under Executive Order 10450 or the

institution of proceedings under the, provisions ef the

According to Eli, Hoharmed, the national leader of the Cult, a
Allah, taught that 411 dark people are Asiatics and belong to ther

aiction of, ie Bureave of

Islam are (1) belief in Allah; (2) belief in the prophets;

United States since they are in slavery in this country. These are
among the reasons given by the leaders why Cult members should nob
register for Selective Service or serve in the armed forcess

Each Temple of the organization has a branch known as
the Fruit of Islan, composed of the able~bodied male memberse The
members of these groups are instructed in close order drill, self.
defense, eating habits, wearing apparel and the stndy of regula~
tions and doctrines of the Cult. In some of the Temples, addi~
tional courses of instruction in Mathemetics, English and Arabic
are also given,

The report cites four specific acts of violence in
which Cult members have been involveds These acts may be sum~
marized as follows:

Sater Spring, Maryland, Incident. A group of approximately .

30 Cult members was traveling in a day coach en route from Jersey City,
to Chicago, Shortly before arrival in Washington, D. C., some members
of the party became involved in a dispute with a railroad porter over
the issuance of a soiled pillow to one of the groupe Several menbers
of the group assaulted the porter, who then broke contact with the
group and reported the incident to the Station Master at Washington.
The train had departed Washington before any action could be taken,
but police in Silver Spring, Marylend, were requested to investigate
the incident. Upon boarding the train in Silver spring, four police

aroun were assaulted by Cult members and the guns and blackjacks. |

£ two were taken by Cult members. After. police reinforcements
arrived, nine Cult members were arrested and charged with assavlt and
battery, inciting a riot, and interfering with an officer in the pers
formance of his duties. Six defendants were tried, convicted, and
senténced to terms ranging from six months to twenty-one months,

Cincinnati, Ohio, Incident. After engaging in a street
fight, nine parsons were arrested, Seven identified themselves as
Cult members and the other two claimed that they were forner members,
but were still firm believers. Two were charged with assault with
intent to kill, by one of the victims, and with assault and battery,
by a policeman who had been struck duiting the fight.

Detroit, Eichigan, Incident. Two police officers who, Fi
tempted to have a double-parked auto moved from in front of the A
. Detroit Temple had their nightsticks taken from them, and were .

—NW68262-Docld:32989648—Page-154 aiananeaes ireaegaeh



severely beaten. The officers shot and wounded two of their attackers, . :
who were identified as Cult members, Three MCI members were tried :
and convicted of attempting to incite a riot.

San Diego, California Incident. A dinner was held at
Fort Rosecrans for the 102d Combat Engineers Battalion, a Negro
National Guard organization which had been called into Federal Service. 7
A civilian who attended the dinner, identified as Harrison“Cole, a, . bod
Cult member, engaged several of the recruits in conversation. ‘When
it was determined that he was malcing seditious statements to the
recruits, he was removed from the Fost by armed escort.

The report also contains numerous statements by Elijah
Mohammed and the various ministers of the organization. These state~
ments appear to advocate the violent overthrow of the Government and
the slaughter of the Whité race. The dominant theme of the utterances
is that 21). persons who are not members of the Cult willbe destroyed
in the War of Armageddon, at which time the Government will be
overthrown and the Muslims will come to power. There are also
statements which approve the acts of violence committed by the
Mau-Mau in Africa and the Puerto Rican Nationalists, and which exhort
Cult members to kill the white devils in order to bring about the
day of their deliverance. It should also be noted that the report
contains other statements by leaders of the organization to the
effect that the deliverance of the Muslims is to. be brought about
through a divine act of Allah, who will destroy the "wicked" and
overthrow their government without any assistance from Cult members.
According to this teaching, the role of the membership of the Cult
in the War of Armageddon will be entirely a passive one.

Although the report is replete with violent statements by
the leadership of the organization and there have been acts of
violence by the individual members, it is: believed that the evidence
fis insufficient to constitute a violation of the Smith Act, This
ooinion is based on the absence of evidence ofany lan oF program
of the organization which could reasonably be calculated to attempt
the violent overthrow of the Government.. The statements of the
leaders of the organization, while they do express the desira-
bility of overthrowing the Government, are more in. the realm
of prophecy than of an actual plan for,a violent. revolution. By
fhe sane vottény the acts oF Violence in which Cult” members have
engaged, fail to evidence any plan of the organization or its
leadership. All these acts are of the spontaneous type, and except
for the fact that the persons involved are members of the organ-
ization, have no connection at all, It is also believed that the

The report also eited the attempt of District 1 of the
Communist Party to infiltrate the Eoston Temple of the Cult.
Although the report contained no further information on this sub-
ject, it is noted that the file contains your memorandum dated
November 8, 1955, to the effect that the infiltration efforts
had been discontinued due to the extreme anti-White attitude of the
Cult. A

The files of the leaders of the organization are being
referred to the Criminal Division for a determination as to pose
sible violation of 50 U.S.C. App. 62, ives, knowingly counseling
persons to refuse or evade registration or service under the Universal
Military Training and Service Acte

: Subsequent to the review of this report there was received
in this Division your memorandum dated January 23, relating to in~ |
‘ormation furnished by Richard Huff concerning possession of weapons
1d hand grenades by the Cult in Georgia. According to the memo-
randum, the reliability of the informant has not been establishede

f it subsequently is determined that the informant is reliable,

: in the diseuasion had with you by Ur. Belmont
on September 8, 1955, when he delivered my memorandum

of September 7, 1955, it was agreed that there was a

need for a careful review by the Department of the

this organization constitutes a dangerous instrumentality
én the event of a national emergency. In the meantimes
while the Department was conducting this review, there
would not be furnished to the Department a list of Cult
members included on the Security Index. You were also
advised thats if the Department concluded from tts
review that the Muslim Cult of Islaa did not constitute

a potential threat to the internal security of this
country, we would take steps te remove from the

BUFILE. 25-330971 ‘fa dy
; J Acta Non vow,
The Chicago Office has submitted a comprehensive (\/.
summary report of 326 pages concerning the activities saat

of the Muslim Cult of Islam (MI).

The MCI was reportedly orgariized in 1930 im/etroit,

Michigan. The national_leader- since 1933 is Elijahfiehammed ..
who claims to have been sent by Allah, the Supreme Being, --- -~_/
to lead the Negroes out of slavery in the United States. ™
Members of the Cult fanatically follow the alleged teachings

7 i of Allah as interpreted by Elijah Mohammed and disavow allegiance

to the United States. Members pledge allegiance only to

Allah and Islam and believe that any civil law which conflicts

with Muslim law should be disobeyed. The Cult teaches

that members of the colored race cannot be considered citizens

of the United States since they are in slavery in this country

and must free themselves by destroying non-Muslims and

Christianity in the coming far of Armageddon." For this

purpose the Cult has a military branch called-they"Fruit of

islam" composed of all able-bodied menibers who participate’ -

in military drill and judo training.

The Department has advised the Bureau by letters etal
dated 2/9/53. and 1/26/55 that evidence presently available
in this case is insufficient to establish a violation of the
Smith Act, a conspiracy to violate the Smith Act or Title 18,
U.S.- Code 2384 (Seditious Conspiracy), |

in view of the fanatical beliefs of the MCI and
the. tense racial situation that exists today, it is believed
we should send the Department this summary report and the
exhibits thereto with the request that this material be
: ‘reviewed to determine if the activities of the MCI are in
A lviolation of any Federal statutes within the Bureau's jurisdiction.

The original of the attached menorandum dateg
September 7, 1955, to Assistant Attorney General Tompkins,
| was delivered personally by me on September 8 to Ur.

: Tompkins. JI advised him that in our gormespondence wtth

| the Department on the Muslim Cult of Islam, we had the

H dietinet impression that the Depariment has not thoroughly
reviewed the file and all investigative reports on this
organizatione I pointed out that there are apprortmately
150 persons on the Security Index who are connected with
this Cult and that the question involved is whether the
Department has sufficiently reviewed the file to arrive

at a conclusion as to wether membership in a leadership
capacity, or active capacity in the "Fruit of Islam"

(the milttary section of the Cult), should be considered
dangerous tn the event of an:emergencye I told Mro Tompkins i
that if the Department comes to the conclusion such persons 7 |
will not be dangerous in an emergency, this Bureau would |
immediately review the cases of the Security Index subjects
for appropriate action and that in the meantine the individual.
List of Security Index subjects is not being referred to the
Department for review.

Neate

I advised Ur. Tompkins that the memorandum-of ~
September % sets forth several incidents, together with the —
: background of this organization, wich reflect the need for
a careful review by the Department. Mro Tompkins agreed
and stated that a thorough review would be made and that he

instances of Violence Against Police Authority

On several occasions, the primitive hatred,
with whiek members are 80 imbued, exploded tnto open
violence. In June 1950 the Detrott Police, in
attenpting to solve @ traffic problem, were assaulted
by @ number of Hegroes in front of the Temple of {siame
The officers had their night sticks taken away, were
ferced to use fircarms, and were given @ severe beating
by the assenbled Hegrees. These Hegroes were tdentified
as nenubers ef the Yuslin Cult of Islame

Anather tnetdent occurred tn Septenber 2950,
in San Diego, involving two officers of the San Diege
Police Department who were attempting te serve a
braffte warrant. Upon erriving at the address, two
individuals eecosted the officers end advised then ~
the subject of the warrant was not at home. hen the
officers exhibited the warrant and expressed their
intention of searching the house, they were ruthiesaly .
atiacked. This perpetrated a near rtot and necessitated
the ealling eut af addittonal cars and epprorimately
twenty officers. Before the subject was taken into
custody and erder was restored, an unknown indtvidual
Jired three shots inte @ police ear. fé& was later
determined that the subject and the two individuale
who intercepted the officers were aii members af the
Sen Diego Temple of thea Huslim Cult of Islame

.fn Pebruary 195%, another incident occurred
whieh inuoived a disturbance between members of the
Culé whe were en route to the yearly convention in
Chicago. Heubers of the Hontgomery County Police in
Stiver Spring, Merylend, were alerted. Four policemen
who met the train and entered the car were assaulted

ay menbers ef the Culé. This necessitated a call far
police reinforcerentss, and nine members of the Cult
were reneved to the etation and charged with agsault,

Spposttion to Federal Authority

Such open defiance ts not relegated merely ta
dacal authority. In ulew of the stand this organteation
hos tekea in connection with service tn the armed forces,
members have consist ently, since the passage of the
Selective froining and Service Act of 1940, adhered
to the teachings of thetr leaders in refusing to registers
because they claim te be registered tn the book of Allah
$a the Holy City of Heace and cannot serve twa masterse
in 1942 taree leaders of the Cult, including Flijah Hohemmed,
and seventy menbers of the Chieaco Temple were arrested
by Agents of thie Bureau. The charges leveled against
the leaders tneluded yatiure to register for selective .
services, sedition end counseling their followers "that
members of the Temple of Islam should not go into the
Arny and Should ignore any cards or letters fron the
focal dreft board.” The indictments returned far sedition
ond conspiracy to comnts sedition were dismissed tn
Hey 1943; however, the three Leaders served prison
terns for scleetive serutee violations. Of the seventy
nenhere arrested, approzinately forty served prison terus
for violatton of the Seleetive Training and Service dot
af 2940,

Durtag the course of the Seeond #orld tar

throughout the country, cad @ nuaber of convictions were

and now with the threat of hostilities in the Far ast,
the Cult hag again taken an open stand gains’ service

to incluée in their teachinga auch information aes
"the black people heve oluays been helping the deviz

At the outbreak of war tn Xorea, the Cult |
timmedtately allied its sympathies with the cause of

Worth Korea and spoke in glowing terns of the strength
and power of their Korean brotheras

They have consistently referred to thei?
Astatic brothers in Russia, and, while there is no
evidence to prove affiltation with the Communist Party,
nany of the leaders have Jest no occasion to rise,
verbally, to the defense of the Soviet Manion in any
notter involving difficulties between the United States
and Bussia. :

and that non-Muslims and Christianity will be destroyed in the "War
of Armageddon.” Has military branch called "Fruit of Islam" (FOI).
Hembers sympathetic to Asiatic nations in any conflict with
western nations. Members have rebelled against police authority
on occasion, expressed opposition to Federal authority by refusel
to serve in military, teach disrespect for U.S. Government and
appear to be potential threat to internal security of U.S. We
investigate (1) functionaries, (2) members of the FOI, and
(3) active participants in the Cult. We have 151 included in the
| Seouriéy Index because of such activities.

Department considers available information insufficient
to classify MCI as dangerous organization, states Security Index
Status should be determined by substantiated evidence of each
respective..individual's anarchist and revolutionary activities and
beliefs as members of MCI and requests we furnish list of members —
included in Security Index. We feel that analysis of potential
dangerousness of this organization and its members has not been
subject of thorough study by Department. We propose to cite
specific instances of violence against police authority, opposition
to Federal authority, disloyalty and disrespect for U.S. Government
and request Department to further consider whether this

os As result of action taken by the Department to remove three
members of the Muslin Cult of Islam (UCI), all Government employees,
from the Security Index, we directed a letter to the Department August &,
1955, requesting advice as to (1) whether we should continue to conduct
security-type investigations of the leaders and active participating ;
members of the MCI ana particularly the members of the Fruit of Islam (For),
the military arm of the Cult, to determine whether the names of such
individuals should be added to the Security Index and (2) whether the
names of ail members of the MCI currently on the Security Index should
be removed from the Security Inder. :

* With respect to the questions posed to the Department, the
Department advised (1) that the Bureau should continue to conduct
Security-type tnvestigations of the leaders and active participating
members of the HCI and (2) that an individual review and evaluation

of derogatory information reported on each of the leaders and active
participating members of the Cult must be conducted to ascertain whether |
as individuals, they should be removed from the Security Inder or should
continue to be included, based on substanticedevidence of each respective
individual's anarchist and revolutionary activities and beliefs, as
members of the Cult. Tie Department further noted that on the basis of
available information the anarchist and revoluttonary statements

. reportedly made by @ single minister of the Cult are not of such oN as
: to indicate an aim or purpose of the Cult as enunciated by the prophe

: and leader, Elijah Mohammed, for uniform compliance by ail MCI temple ~*
ministers. iF :

j The Department concludes that statements and activities on the

: part of individual members of the Cult indicating anarchist and revolu=
tionary beliefs, will be determining factors in determining whether or not

{Such individual members come within the revised Security Index criteria.
The Department requests that a complete list of the names and FBI file
numbers of the members of the MCI currently ineluded in the Security
Index be made available and that the Internat Security Division be kept
informed of the individual members! activities on a continuing basis in
order that their cases may be revtewed or re-reviewed in light of any new

Hemorandum for Mr. Boardman:

Thumbnail Sketch of the CI?

Reliable informants report that this Cult is an organization
composed entirely of Negroes which was reportedly organized around
1930 in Detroit, Michigan. The national leader and founder ts
Elijah Mohammed who claims to have been sent by Allah to lead the Negroes
out of slavery in the Untted States. Members fanatically follow the
alieged teachings of Allah as interpreted by Mohammed and disavow
allegiance te the United States. Members pledged allegiance only to
Allah and Islam and believe any civil law which conflicts with Muslin
law should be disobeyed. The Cult teaches that members of the dark
skinned race cannot be considered citizens of the United States since
they are in slavery in this country and, therefore, must free themselves
by destroying non-xuslins and Christianity in the "War of Armageddon.” For
this purpose the Cult has a military branch called the Frutt of Islam
composed of all male able-bodied members who participate’ in military
drill and judo training, Members of the Cult also believe that they
gre.directly related to all Asiatic nations and any conflict involving
any Astatic nation and the Western nationsis considered a part of the
War of Armageddon in which the Asiatic nation will be victorious.

Instances of Violence Against Police Authority: °

- On several occasions the primitive hatred with which members
are so imbued, exploded into open violence. In June 1950 the Detroit
Police, in attempting to solve a traffic problem, were assaulted by a.
number of Negroes in front of the Temple of Islam. The officers had
their night sticks taken away , were forced to use firearms, and were
given a severe beating by the assembled Negroes. These Negroes were
identified as members of the Muslim Cult of Isilon.

Another incident occurred in September 1950 in San Diego,
involving two officers of the San Diego Police Department who were
attempting to serve a traffic warrant. Upon arrivingat the address,
two individuals accosted the officers and advised them the subject of the
warrant was not at home. When the officers exhibited the warrant and
expressed their intention of searching the house, they were ruthlessly
attacked. This perpetrated a near riot and necessitated the calling
out of additional cars and approximately twenty officers. Before the
Subject was takén -into custody and order was restored, an unknown
individual fired three shots into a police car. It was later determined
that the subject and the two individuals who intercepted the officers
were all members of the San Diego Temple of the Muslim Cult of Islam

Memorandum for Ur. Boardman:

In February, 1951, another incident occurred which involved
a disturbance between members of the Cult who were en route to the
yearly convention in Chicago. Members of the Montgomery County Police
in Stlver Spring, Maryland, were alerted. Four policemen who met the
train and entered the car were assaulted and had their guns and
blackjacks taken away from them by members of the Cult. This
necessinted a call for police reinforcements, and nine members of the
! Cult were removed to the station and charged with assault.

Opposition to Federal Authority:

i Such open defiance is not relegated merely to local authority.
: In view of the stand this organization has taken in connection with
Service in the armed forces, members have consistently, since the

passage of the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, adhered to the
teachings of their leaders in refusing to register, because they clain
‘to be registered in the book of Allah in the Holy City of Mecca and
cannot serve two masters. In 1942, three leaders of the HCI, including
Elijah Mohammed, and seventy members of the Chicago Temple were arrested
by Agents of the Bureau. The charges leveled against the leaders included
Jatlure to register for selective service, sedition and counseling their
followers "that members of the Temple of Islam should not go into the
Army and should ignore any cards or letters from the local draft board."
The indictments returned for sedition and conspiracy to commit sedition
were dismissed in May, 1943; however, the three leaders served prison
terms for selective service violations. Of the seventy members arrested,
approxinately forty served prison terms for violation of the Selective
Training and Service Act of 1940.

wt

During the course of the Second World War and the war in Korea,
such tncidents were repeated throughout the country, and @ number of
convictions were secured for violations of the Selective Service acts;
and now with the threat of hostilities in the Far East, the Cult has
again taken an open stand against service in the armed forces of the
United States. They continue to include in their teachings such
tnformation as:

The biack people have always been helping
the devil by fighting in his wars, but the
‘ Muslims do not go to war but rather to jail. ’

Those who register will be kicked out of
the nation of Islam and will die with the
white devils.

Memorandum for Mre Boardman:

Disloyalty and Disrespect for the United States Government:

Intertwined with defiance of the préuvisions of the Selective
Service acts is the vivid disloyalty to the Government and the continual
disrespect for its laws. Such comments as "no good Muslim registers
for the draft, vote or do anything else in the Devil's government," are
repeatedly made throughout the various temples, In 1942, Blijah Mohammed,
the leader of this Cult, described the American flag as follows: "The
flag you see, here is the flag of the white devil. The white that you
see, and notice that you don't see any black.any where on it, represents
the white race; the red represents the blood that they lose keeping it for
the white devil alone, the blue background, the white stars represent
justice to the whites, not the red men or the black men but only for
the white devils.”

ho: : When the United States was at war with Japan, the Cult considered
the Japanese their "little brown brothers® and gleefully predicted

the victory of the Land of the Rising Sun. At the outbreak of the war

tn Korea, the Cult immediately allied its sympathies and spoke in

glowing terms of the strength of their Korean brothers, They have
consistently referred.to their Astatic brothers in Russia, and, while

there is no evidence to prove affiliation with the Communist Party, many”
of the leaders have lost no occasion to rise, to the defense of the

Soviet Union in any matter inudlving difficulties between the United.
States and Russia,

Observations:

Based upon an analysis of the rabid teachings of this group, it
is definitely considered that these people present a threat to the 7
internal security of the United States, and would, with the right number
of followers and the opportunity, be more than wiiling to perform any
acts which would subvert American principles and endanger the eristence
of the American nation as such. Such a potential threat could materialize
by actual violence against civil authorities prior to a nationaL
emergency as has been done by the Nationalist Party of Puerto Rico or
by setzing upon the opportunity presented by a nationas emergency to
commit acts of violence based upon their hatred and disloyalty to the
Government of the United States. Our instructions to the field are that
security~type investigations are to be conducted on individual members
of the Cult who are reported to be (1) functionaries or leaders of the
Cult; (2) members of the military section of the Cult known as the
"Fruit of Islam" or (3) active participants in carrying out fanatical
and disloyal aims and purposes of the Cult. Individuals affiliated with
the Cult have been retained in the Security Index after careful evaluation
of their activities in furthering the violence and anarchist aims and |

purposes of the Cult under that portion of the revised Security Index

@ subversive organization has anarchist or revolutionary beliefs and is
likely to seize upon the opportunity presented by a national

emergency to,endanger the public safety as shown by overt acts or
statements within the last three years established through reliable
sources, informants or individuals.” As of the current date, we have
151 such individuals inciuded in the Security Inder. Extensive
investigation has been conducted of the activities of the organization
since 1942 and the numerous reports in the matter have been forwarded
to the Department. It appears from the comments contained in the
Department memorandum of August 23, 1955, thaé an analysis of the
potential dangerousness of this organization and tts members has not
been the subject of a thorough study by the Department. The Domestic
Intelligence Division feels that we should cite the information set
out previously herein and specifically draw the attention of the
Depariment to the organizational reports submitted concerning the
Muslim Cult of Islam, and request the Department to reconsider tts
‘stand in this matter. If the Department has @- technical legal
Teason for not desiring the names of these individuals included in
the Security Index, tt is felt that we should be so informed,

RECOMMENDATIONS:

(1) If you approve, there is attached a proposed Letter to
the Department along the lines mentioned above.

(2) It is recommended that we not furnish the Department a
list of the 151 individuals, MCI members, included in the Security
Index pending reconsideration by the Departmente

(8) The Department's correspondence indicates it has not thoroughly
reviewed the entire file on the Muslim Cult but it is basing fts opinion
on the statement of one minister. If you agree, Belmont widk delivers ij

for the Department to thoroughly review the file on thig organization W

prior to any decision as to the individual members. 4 4)

Reference is made to your memorandum dated August 8, 1955, in which
you wished to be advised whether the Buresu should continue to conduct
Security-typs investigations of the leaders and active participating members
of the Muslim Cult of Islam and its military edjunct, "Fruit of Islam", to ©
detoxmine whether the names of such individuals should be added to the
Security Index because of their anarchist and revolutionary activities and
beliefs, and further whether the names of all individuals who are currently
included in the Sesurity Index on a basis of the individual's anarchist and
revolutionary activities and beliefs as members of the Muslim Cult of Islan,
should be removed.

For your infommtion, the Security Index status of the three United
States Government Employees, HERBERT CAESAR, JEREMIAH PUGH and JAMES GRICE=
Trt, referred to in your memorandum, was considered under oli four provisions
‘4 the revised Criteria, and particularly under Criteria 1(s) which readss
"Investigation has developed informetion thet an individual though not a

Your attcntion is directed to our memorandum to the Buresu dated

August 10, 195k, captioned *Ekijah Mohammed, et al, Muslim Cult Islam,

| Internal Seourity-MCI®, in which it ues stated at that time that tho
fansticion of Muslin Cult of Islan members sppzars to be of such an
extreme dogrca as to render possible an outbreak of violence by Cult
members which might be similar in nature to the recently attempted ascags-
ination of the members of the House of Representatives by Puerto Rican
Nationalists, It hss been secertained that the basis for this conclusion
were the alleged revolutionary statements by ASBURY WILLIAMS, minister,
Temple #5, MCI, Cincinnati, Ohio, as reported in Bureau Report of Special
Agent Richard Ff. Lally, dated May 16, 195h, at Cincinnati, Ohio, and
credited to Confidential Informants Tel: and T<5 of know reliability.

On this point, it is to be noted that in reply to cur memorandum of
August 10, 1954, in which we requested a recevaluation of certain infor wants,
including Confidential Informants Tek and Te5 of the referenced SA Lally
report, the Bureau advised on Septerber 21, 195 that Confidential Intommnt
Gh is available to testify but is known to have furnished false inforaation
on one occasion, and advised further that Cenfidsntial Informant Ted is not
available to testify. In addition, the Burean advised on March 3, 1955,
that Confidential Informant Tel was being changed frem "of known reliability*
to “of unknom reliability”. : :

In this comectien, a Bureau report on ASBURY WILLIAMS dated September i
Uk, 195k, reflected the records of the Federel Correctional Institute at :
Milan, Michigan, as follouss : ;

"The subject was described in 1943 as exhibiting .

no evidence of major psychological or neuropsychiatric ‘
disorders. A diagnosis of the subject at that time
indicated that he exhibited a constitutional psychopathic co ‘
inferiority with psychosis. His mental deficiency is i
noted as 'fanilial, border Line type’. He was described :
as a *constitutional psychopathic stete » paranoid
peraonality’.” 5

The Bureau report furthor deseribed WILLIAMS as being of inferior intelligence
with @ mental age of between ten and eleven years of age with an I.Q. of
seventy to seventyoriine,

. In light of this later acquired information, the conclusions of ovr
August 10, 2954 memorandum necessarily requixed re-evaluation. On the basis :

NW 68262 Docld:32989648 Page 184.



of available information, the anarchist and revolutionary statements
reportedly made by ASBURY WILLIANS ond referenced in our Aveust 10th
memorandun, appear to be restricted to WIULIAMS, as a single minister
of the Cult, and a minister whe appears to be extremely radical, and
such revolutionary statements are not of a substential scope to indicate
an ain or purpose of the Cult as enunciated by the prophet and leader,

\ ELIJAH HOHAMMED, for uniform compliance by all MCI temple ministerss

You have advised that as of July 15, 1955, the date of the last
atatisticol review of the Security Index, the names of 12 Cult wenbers
were included in the Security Index. It is requested that thie Division
be furnished with a complets List of the names and FBI File numbers of the
menbers of ¢he Muslin Cult of Islam currently included in the Indox.

Considering that stetements and activities on the part of individual
nembers of the Cult, indicating anarchist and revolutionary beliefs, will
be determining factors in concluding whether or not such individvel members
come within the revicsd Security Index Criteria, it is deemed vital that
thie Division be kept informed of the individual members’ activities on a

, continuing basis, in order that their cases may be reviewed or re-reviewed
in light of aay new evidence or information. Therefore, is is requested
that you continue to conduct seeurityotype investigations of the leaders and
active participating members of the Muslim Cult of Islame

Memorandum for Mr. Boardman

Memorandum from Assistant Attorney General Tompkins
dated August 10, 1954, captioned "Elijah Mohammed, et al,
Muslim Cult of Islam, Internal Security ~ MCI," stated in part
that the MCI continues to foster a program of vicious racial
hatred, fanned continually by the fanatical preaching of
Mohammed and his ministers, bitterly denowcing the United
States Government, its flag and leaders, and proclaiming the
eventual destruction of the country and the white people thereof.
He further stated that the fanaticism of the MCI members appears
to be of such an extreme degree as to render possible an out~
break of violence by Cult members which might be similar in
nature to the attempted assassination of the members of the
House of Representatives by the Puerto Rican Nationalists.

OBSERVATIONS:

The conclusion reached by Mr. Tompkins in regard to
the three Federal Government employees in regard to the dangerousness
of the individuals or the anarchist and violent aims and purposes
of the MCI appears contrary to the observations in his memorandum
of August 10, 1954. :

Individuals deemed dangerous because of anarchist
or revolutionary acts or statements have been placed in the
Security Index both under the old Security Index criteria and
the revised criteria, even though there is no affiliation with
the CP or other Marxist revolutionary groups. The criteria
clearly spelled out this situation. A

The radical group of Negroes who are members of the
MCI are lead by Elijah Mohammed. They believe he is the “True
Prophet of Allah" and believe that any civil law which conflicts
with Muslim Law should be disobeyed. The members disavow
allegiance to the United States and pledge allegiance only to
Islam. They do not consider it their duty to register for
Selective Service. The members consider themselves merely slaves
- of this country who will continue to be slaves until they free
themselves. This Cult presents a threat to the internal security

similar to that presented by the Nationalist Party of
Puerto Rico, Their training, teachings and statenents
clearly depict them as potential security threats. Only
the Leaders, members of the Fruit of Islam and very
active participating members have been ineluded in the
Security Index. The three Federal employees fall within
these categoriese

AGITON:

If you approve, there is attached a memorandum
to Assistant Attorney General Tompkins requesting (1) advice
as to whether the investigations of individual members of
the Cult should be continued and (2) whether the names
of the other Security Index subjects who have been placed
in the Security Index because of their anarchist and
revolutionary beliefs in affiliation with the MCI should

be continued in the Security Indexo ie

This refers to my memorandum of September 8, 1953 ay.

The investigative reports reflect that the Moslem Cult of
Islem is deseribea by informants as a vicious and fanatical organi-
zation composed of Negroes whose meubers disavow allegiance to the
United States and declare allegiance only to Islam and Allshts
Prophet, Hlijah Mohammed, ‘The organization's rules imply civil dis-
obedience to the laws of the United States while awaiting the annihi-
Jation of the White Race in the Biblical reference to the "War of ;
Armageddon, i Ned dl

In connection with its policy of civil disobedience to caren i
the laws of the United States, several instances have been reported\ .

where leaders of this Cult have, during the course of meetings, made
statements to the effect that its members should not comply with the
Selective Service Laws and to disregard orders received from their
respective Local boards.

This attitude is apparently in line with its general
policy of opposition to civil authority and there is no specific
information developed which would establish that a conspiracy was
formed for the purpose of evading or counseling evasion of service
in the Armed Forces of the United States,

PIES DESTROYED : :
5 NOY 23 982 While there have been instances where individuals have .
Ouriseled such evasion, it could not be established that they were

on this phase of the case is not warranted. ‘In the circumstances,

on the part of the organization is desired at this time, However, it

The file in this case has been reviewed and it is my opinion “Sy fe
jest the evidence presently available is insufficient to establish a j{ j

violation of the Smith Act or a conspiracy to violate said Act. This <
conclusion has been reached in spite of the fact that the leaders of
the Cult, in some measure at least, advocate the desirability of the
violent overthrow of the existing Government. However, such advocacy
, is expressed more in the nature of a prophecy that such overthrow will
inevitably come about under the leadership of "Allah" in the "War of
Armageddon." The organization apnears to have no program of action
a which reasonably would be calculated to bring about or attempt to
7 bring about the violent overthrow of the Government. In addition,
Cane “ rol it is pointed out that the conclusion ‘ereinabove expressed is to
ie ee eee’ large extent influenced by my opinion that the evidence available

vi This is in response to your memorandum of December

with its attachment, in which you requested my views as to whether

the facts developed in the above matter warrant prosecution and also-
to be informed specifically of the extent of any further investigation
that is desirable.

7 The facts developed in the investigation to date are insif-
ficient at

e to prove that men within the draft age Gge ave been
actually » aided and abetted by members of the organization °

to evade registration and/or service in the Armed Forces. However,
since the investigative report of November 28, 1951, reveals that.

men within the critical age group may have been told by members of

the organization not to comply with the provisions of the Selective

. Service Act and to disregard orders received from their respective
local draft boards, I believe thatthe investigation should be con~ ae

tinued. In connection therewith I suggest, upon investi gation ion of
subséquent Selective Service violations by members of this cult, “that/|
the delinquent be interviewed, as in the past, with a vie to ascer>
taining whether hig delinquency_was_the_ “result” of being éotinseled by
amember or members of the organization. If this fact is established, \
it is requested that you endeavor to secure the names of those present
at that time, the date of the conversation and its substance in detail. «

The information available does not reflect a violation of the i
Sedition Statute, 18 U.S.C. 2387, since it does not appear that the “y
subject group or the members thereof have advised, counseled, urged, fe
or in any manner caused or attempted to cause insubordination, dis- Fe
loyalty, mutiny or refusal of duty by any member of the military or ot

A.1. BOTNICK
Regional Directar

July 21, 1909

Recently I was privileged to read an advance copy of a new and exciting book
entitled REPORT PROM ISRAEL, by Arnold Forster, General Counsel to the Anti-
Defamation League of B'nai B'rith and Director of ADL’s Civil Rights Division.

I had heared so much exciting shop talk about Arnold Forster's new book that E
wanted to read it as soon as possible to know the book and to be able to share with.
you this advance look.

In the summer of 1968 and again in early 1969, Arnold Forster was in Israel
with his tepe recorder, and there he produced many first-hand interviews’ with prom-
inent Arabs and Jews as weil as Christians and Moslems. The book is a narrative
version of these on-the-spot interviews and contains thorough coversage of such
major topics as the aftermath of the Six-Day War, terrorisim on the borders, a
united Jerusalem, the occupied areas, and Christians in Israel.

As I read the book I was caught up by the excitement of the interviews - the im
sights into the Israeli-Arab political picture; the explanation of the Soviet Union's
role in the Middle Bast by Netanel Lorch, Director of Information of Israel's
Foreign Ministry; interviews with Abba Eban, Israel's Foreign Minister; General Shloxa
Gazit, Liaison Officer to General Moshe Dayan; with Mordecai Gazit, Advisor to the
Prime Minister: Teddy Kollek, Mayor of Jerusalem; Avraham Harmon, President of
Hebrew University; with Aziz Shihadeh, Bethlehem-born Arab lawyer; with Father Johm
Roger, head of the Convent of Notre Dame in Jerusalem; Archbishop Bassilius, Chief
Secretary to the Greek Orthodox Patriarch; with Dr. G. Douglas Young, leadar of the
Protestant community in the Old City.

You too will feel the terrorism on the borders when you read Arnold Forster's
interview with General Aaron Yaariv, Intelligence Chief of Israel's Armed Forces,
who was Staff Chief in the Sinai campaign in 1956, as he describes the Arab
terrorist machinery. :

You will read at first hand what life is like in a settloment where terrorist
activity is fact of life - at Nahal Golan, a paramilitary settlement located on
lateau of the Golan mountain range, within a mile of the cease-fire line between.
and Syria.

It was here at Nahal Golan that Arnold Forster made a point to talk with nine-
ar-oi1c Anna Fuchs and David Simone. The spirit of these two young people

you, as you read how they reacted to the terrorist attacks. In the

d Simone, “Here (Nahal Golan) morale is very high. We have a wonderful

In presenting a clearer understanding of the new mood among young Blacks,
the discussion includes an explanation of their aims and objectives, laud-
ing the emergence of pride in self, race and history. However, those mili~
tants who seek to establish a separate society outside the framework of the
existing system are labeled "racists in reverse" who pose as a serious
threat to our society as white racists.

June, 1966

Dear Friend:

In view of the urgency of sustaining interest and stimulating commumity
action based on the findings of the National Advisory Commission on Civil
Disorders, we are pleased to advise of the availability of two new and im—
portant films. The films merit the widest possible audiences and serious
discussion,

REMEDY FOR RIOT

This CBS REPORTS film, based on the Report, examines the 1967 riots in the
framework established by President Johnson when he authorized the commis~
sion to find out "....what happened? Why did it happen? What can be done
to prevent it from happening again?"

The £ilm explores problems within the ghetto, the role of law enforcement
agencies, and the mood of white America. REMEDY FOR REOT explores what
several communities across the country are doing to relieve conditions which
sparked violence.

This unique film, featuring Harry Reasoner, speaks to all sectors of Ameri-~
can society, It should be seen by people in private industry to show what
Detroit automotive companies are doing to recruit employees from the ghetto.
Law enforcement personnel can gain from the experiences of Atlanta's Police
Chief, Herbert Jenkins, a member of the National Advisory Commission, who
has worked for years at improving relations between the police and ghetto
tesidents.

It is an excellent film which accomplishes a dual purpose: itmt only shows
causes of violence, it also speaks to the cures.

Dore Schary and Father Theodore Hesburgh, President of Notre Dame University

Mr. A, I. BOTNIK, Regional Director, Anti-
Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, South Central Region,
New Orleans, La., (phone - JA 2-9534), called this ~
afternoon to report that THOMAS ALBERT TARRANTS, JR.,
father of THOMAS ALBERT TARRANTS, III, called him the
morning of 2/24/70 for an appointment. BOTNIK made out as
though he were someone else and indicated he did not know
TARRANTS. TARRANTS stated he was coming to New Orleans to
see BOTNIK either at work or at his home.

Shortly thereafter BOTNIK notified the New Orleans
police of the call and they said that they, in turn, had
just received a call from TARRANTS, JR., wherein he
explained he probably had upset one of their citizens with
a prior call that date. The New Orleans police, who in
the meantime had contacted the Mobile Police, learned
that TARRANTS was coming to New Orleans and a description
of his automobile. They met him at the city limits, shook
down his car and removed a .30 caliber rifle he said he was
bringing with him. TARRANTS, accompanied by his 15-year-old
son, was taken to New Orleans Police Department where .

Mr. BOTNIK contacted him and, to the amazement of ali, all
TARRANTS said was, ''You are the man who set up my son,"
to which BOTNIK replied he did not know what TARRANTS was
talking about.

Recentiy I was privileged to read an advance copy of a new and exciting book
entitled REPORT FROM ISRAEL, by Arnold Forster, General Gounsel to the Anti-
Defamation League of B'nai B'rith and Director of ADL's Civil Rights Division.

I had hearé so much exciting shop talk about Arnold Forster's new book that E
wanted to read it as soon as possible to know the book and to be able to share with.
you this advance look. 7

In the summer of 1968 and again in early 1969, Arnold Forster was in Israel
with his tape recorder, and there he produced many first-hand interviews with pran-
inent Ar&bs and Jews as well as Christians and Moslems. The book is a narrative
q version of these on-the-spot interviews ang contains thorough coversage of such
major topics 2s the aftermath of the Six-Day War, terrorisim on the borders, a

united Jer the cocupied ereas, and Christians in Tsraal. :

As I read the book I*was caught up by the excitement of the interviews - the i
sights into the Israeli-Arab political picture; the explanation of the Soviet Union’
idle East by Netanel Lorch, Director of Information of Israel’s
stry; interviews with Abba Eben, Israel's Foreign Minister; General ShI
$on Officer to General Moshe Dayan; with Mordecai Gazit, Advisor to the

In, presenting a clearer understanding of the new mood among young Blacks,
the discussion includes an expiauation of their aims and! objectives, laud—
ing the emergence of pride in self, race and history. However, those mjli-

ATTEMPTED BOMBING OF RESIDENCE OF 7

BM

Mr. A. I. BOINIK, Regional Director, Anti-
Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, South Central Region,
New Orleans, La., (phone - JA 2- -9534) , called this
afternoon to report that THOMAS ALBERT TARRANTS, JR.,
father of THOMAS ALBERT TARRANTS, III, called him the
morning of 2/24/70 for an appointment. BOTNIK made out as
though he wore someone else. and indicated he did not know
TARRANTS, TARRANTS stated he was coming to New Orleans to
see BOTNIK either at work or at his home.

Shortly thereafter BOTNIK notified the New Orleans
policewof the call and they said that they, in turn, had
just received a call from TARRANTS, JR., wherein he
". explained he probably had upset one of their citizens with
a prior call that date. The New Orleans police, who in
the meantime had contacted the Mobile Police, learned
that TARRANTS was coming to New Orleans and a description
of his automobile. They met him at the city limits, shook
down his car and removed a .30 caliber rifle he said he was
bringing with him. TARRANTS, accompanied by his 15-year-old
Son, was taken to New Orleans Police Department where .

Mr. BOTNIK contacted him and, to the amazement of all, ail
TARRANTS said was, "You are the man who set up my son,”
to which BOTNIK replied he did not know a TARRANTS was

talking about.

In the sunmer of 1968 and again in early 1969, Arnold Forster was in Israel
with his tape recorder, and there he produced many first-hand interviews with pran-
inent Arabs and Jews as well as Christians and Moslems. The book is a narrative
version of these on-the-spot interviews angj contains thorough coversage of such

as the aftermath of the Six-Day War, terrorisim on the borders, a
jem, the ceevpied areas, and Christians in Tsrael.

Mr. A. I. BOTNIK, Regional Director, Anti-
Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, South Central Region,
New Orleans, La., (phone - JA 2-9534), called this ~
afternoon to report that THOMAS ALBERT TARRANTS, JR.,
father of THOMAS ALBERT TARRANTS, III, called him the
morning of 2/24/70 for an appointment. BOTNIK made out as
though ae were someone else and indicated he did not know
TARRANTS, TARRANTS$ stated he was coming to New Orleans to
see BOTNIK either at work or at his home.

Shortly thereafter BOTNIK notified the New Orleans
policewof the call and they said that they, in turn, had
just received a call from TARRANTS, JR., wherein he
. @xplained he probably had upset one of their citizens with
a prior call that date. The New Orleans police, who in
the meantime had contacted the Mobile Police, learned
that TARRANTS was coming to New Orleans and a description
of his automobile. They met him at the city limits, shook
down his car and removed a..30 caliber rifle he said he was
bringing with him. TARRANTS, accompanied by his 15-year-old
son, was taken to New Orleans Police Department where .

Mr. BOTNIK contacted him and, to the amazement of all, ait
TARRANTS said was, "You are the man who set up my son,”

to which BOTNIK replied he did not know what TARRANTS was
talking about.

. COMMUNIST INFLUENCE IN RACIAL MATTERS

INTERNAL SECURITY - COMMUNIST

This memorandum recommends a letter to all offices directing

| the field to broaden its efforts relating to communist influences in
the racial field so that the Bureau will be better able to keep pace
with the stepped-up efforts of the communists to penetrate and influ-
ence the racial movement. We are also directing the opening of a new
case file, both at the Seat of Government and in the field, which will
serve as a repository for all intelligence relating to this matter and
provide for the submission of quarterly investigative reports to the
Bureau. Heretofore, this intelligence was included in the quarterly
reports submitted concerning the Communist Party, USA, and in reports
covering various of the allied groups and individuals active in the
racial movement.

Coincident with the increased racial activities occurring
throughout the country the_past two years, the Communist Party, USA,
has expanded its efforts to gain control of the racial movement. This
has resulted in greater investigative effort on our part in the security
field. We have been regularly gathering extensive data depicting in
Many ways the communist influence and participation in the racial move-
ment. We must, however, increase these efforts to keep ahead of the if
communists' plans to infiltrate the racial picture. Our proposed al
instructions to the field are directed toward a broadening of our pro~; {
cedures which in turn will more fully and precisely provide us hate F
| the facts relating to the extent of communist influence,

With the foregoing es a background te underscore

In addition, the Bureau desires the field to compile -
in a singlo investigative report portinent information developed

tigative reports on a quarterly bagis. These reports should
include information hevetefore reported in the section entitled

@)2) The initial iavestigative veport is intended to priw
-maxily depict the current situation rather than serve as a
historical«type document. We ara therefore principally com
-eoxned with tho racial novencnt. duriag ¢he past year and three
quarters. Use the period comoncing 2/1/63 as a general guide-
line; however, extraordinary situations arising eariier should
bo considered for inclusion. Likewise, if a current situation
had ite genesis prior te 3/1/63 sufficient infermatien prior to
that date should be used to make the current situation meauingful.

(2) Generally speaking, 3¢ will bo necessary for only the
office covering an activity to royort At, as well as the char~
acterizotions of persona involved. For esanple, 22 a racial
demonstration took pince im Cleveland vith Cloveland residents
involved, it showid be veported by the Cleveland Office. If a
New York Office informant reports on the Cleveland matter te the
New York Office, 2¢ should not be reported by the Now York Office
but be considered by Clevoland in ite sebuiseion as Cloveland
Will alveady have been sent such infermation by the New Yori:
Office. On the other hand, fer such a farefliung activity as
the 8/23/63 Harch oa Wachincton, it will be incumbent upon cach
office having subjocts who attended or otherwise participated
to include tho ingernatien in its sulmission.

(8) The ettached outline should be follewed ag to the numbored
and lettered itens., Where Zurthor breakdowns by numbers and lottere
are practical, it will be vormissibie ¢a do se.

.{4) Whon an activity by an organization is reported under IZ,
the dotails should not be repeated undor 127i concerning the orcan«
ization. It will be necessary only, unJor TEI, to refer to the
particular activity os appearing under ii, :

(8) Where specific pertinent infermation set cut in the cute
line is not available through file review, immediate discreet
inquiry should be made te ostnin same. Fox example, if tho
officers of an organization covered undor IYI in the outline .
are not known, secure their identities. Gnly established reli=
abie sources may be contacted in this regard without prior
Bureau authority.

(7) Au original ond eight copies of all reports should
be submitted by each field office. Any office which has
absolutely no information to report, either in the initial
report or the quarterly weports thereafter, is permitted to

positive informatica, hewever limited, ig avallebie, it must

(8) The initial investigative report should be submitted

(8) All main headings denoted by Roman numerals 4a the
nttached outline must be accounted for im eli reports. If
thors is no information to report under a particular main
heading, the heading should appear, followed by a statement
"No information developed.”

€203 As to individuals involved, wo are concerned primarily
with subversive characterizing information coincident with the
period of activity. For cxanpie, if an individual organized,
_ participated ja or was otherwise asscciated with a racial activ<
aty on 2/1/64, his membership in the CDUSA and other subversive
Groups a9 of that date would be most portiment., Of course, if
& Gubversive connection as of the date of activity cannot be
established, the noxt best thing would be to establish a sub-
versive connection ag scom prior to the activity as possibie,
Gonerally speaking, characterizations of individuals should be
ag Succinct and pointed as possibie. For exampie, if an indi~
Vidual's Party membership is established, a long recitation of
other connections, such as vith fronts, vould be unnecessary.
Good judgment must be exercised in characterizing individuals,
as with a1 other phases reisting to the collection of facts for
the report. If a person holds a particulariy key position in

The purpose of this memorandum is to recommend that
attached letter be sent to the field discontinuing the submission of
a separate report on captioned matter and instructing ‘that the matter
be reported in the reports on the subversive group exerting such
influence, i

Prior to 1964 this subject matter was reported in a sqcttion
of the Communist Party, USA report or in the report of any othe:
subversive group, such as the-Socialist Workers Party, which was
attempting»to exert influence in racial matters, In 1964 a separate
investigation and report were initiated because of an increase in
communist attempts to influence the racial movement as the tempo of
activities in the racial field increased, The field was instructed
to submit separate quarterly reports containing all attempts by any
communist group to influence the ‘racial movement under the code

word "CIRM," : —9S: Ls
This communist influence has been decreasing and in the
first quarter of 1973 only 16 offices submitted reports in this
matter, the other offices submitting letters as no pertinent infor~
mation was developed, In line with our continuing efforts to relieve
the field of unnecessary reporting requirements in order to make more
‘time available for investigation and informant development, a change

RE: INTERNAL SECURITY SECTION
DOMESTIC INTELLIGENCE DIVISION

66~1885-S

Party members must take an active part in what they call this
"yevolutionary movement." This means more work in the field and
a greater volume of information coming into the Internal Security
Section, It_would be a bad mistake not to have adequate manpower
assigned to. analyzé, evaluate, correlate and.disseminate this
information at the Seat of Government,

IMPORTANCE OF THE CASE:

7 The Bureau is on record to the effect there is communist
penetration into the racial movement, Martin Luther King, head of
the SCLC, has challenged the Bureau on this point. Both sides in
the controversy over the current Civil Rights Bill which is pending
in the Senate may_well.ask the Bureau before the summer is over for

information concerning communist’ penetration into the racial nidve-
ment, It may become necessary for the Bureau to make some response.

‘If this does occur, it will be absolutely essential for us not only

to have all. the information, available but to have it in such form
that a proper. presentation of the facts can_be readily.made. This
is fundamental inasmuch as the whole subject of civil rights is the
primary*domestic issue on the political front today.

EXCLUSIVE ASSIGNMENT OF SUPERVISORS:

If you agree, two supervisors will be assigned exclusively

‘to the over-all problem of commudist penetration into the racial

movement, Supervisor Seymor a4 Phillips’ will be detached from the
CPUSA Unit and Supervisor Theddore P,ARosack will be detached from
the Communist Front Unit-and assigned as a team to these important
investigations, Supervisor Phillips has handled almost from its
inception the case entited "CPUSA, Negro Question, Communist
Influence in Racial Matters, Internal Security - C," Supervisor
Rosack has been supervising the investigations of communist pene-
tration into racial groups, some of the more important of which are
SCLC, CORE, SNICK and NAACP, Rosack will take with him a total of
91 cases involving communist penetration into the racial groups.

It is believed that these two experienced men can handle
the supervision of our investigations of communist activity in
racial groups. They cannot do it alone at such times as we may be
called upon to prepare special studies, working papers and briefs.
During such periods, I will~give these two men such assistance as.

they may need,

NEED FOR ADDITIONAL SUPERVISOR:

Supervisor Phillips will leave 69 cases which he is
currently supervising in the CPUSA Unit.” The three remaining men
in this Unit cannot absorb these 69 cases, This Unit is already
heavily assigned and a number of the javestigations being super=
vised by this Unit, such (see below)* the communist youth
groups and the appearance of communist leaders on college campuses,
require exacting and time-consuming attention, Supervisor Rosack
will leave 84 cases in the Communist Front Unit, and that Unit
with its two remaining supervisors will not be able to assimilate
these 84 cases, There will be a total of 153 cases left unassigned,
Although one supervisor cannot handle all 153 cases, we will be
able to assimilate these 153 cases, with some adjustments, with the
addition of one supervisor to the Section, —~

It is not possible to absorb these cases in other Units
of the Section with our current complement, In support of this
statement, I would like to point out that in January, 1963, we had
22 supervisors assigned to the Section and were carrying a load of
2,928 cases, We .currently have 19 supervisors assigned to the
Section and are carrying a load of 3, 293 cases. This is an increase
of, 365 cases and a decrease of three supervisors, We have had a
delinquency in the Section since January, 1964, We have not been
able to erase this delinquency although we have made a determined
“effort to do so and our voluntary overtine has" been considerably in
excess of two hours per man per day.°"

: We cannot foresee at this time for _how. long a period of
time it will be necessary for us to have two supervisors assigned
exclusively to the communist penetration into the racial movement —
cases; therefore, I suggest we have an additional supervisor

| assigned to the Section on_a tem mporary basis. It might be possible

to get a man from the Was ington

feid Office who has had previous

ment, It is contemplated that as soon as we can safely do so .
Supervisors Phillips and Rosack will be sent back to their respective
Units and at that time the supervisor from Washington Field Office

ADDENDUM BY INSPECTION Division ~ (2 Me 6/4/64

The Internal Security Section, Domestic Intelligence Division (DID), has
requested one additional supervisor to be assigned to that Section on a temporary basis
to handle case assignments vacated by two experienced supervisors whom DID desires
to devote full time to directing field efforts, correlating results, and preparing for
dissemination investigative information obtained resulting from strongly implied Com-
munist Party (CP) effo- .s to infiltrate and dominate noncommunist racial groups' effort.
in the Summer of 1964 » whip the racial situation to a peak period of disturbances.
Urgency for the FBI t' "stay ahead" of the situation is tied to pending civil rights
legislation and forese :able ramifications arising out of the complex political situations
in an election year w, :re civil rights and social disturbances will play a key role in
campaign efforts and ,ossibly election results.

The assigning of full-time personnel to the proposed correlation assignments
is considered to be established by recent occurrences not set out by DID in its request
and which tend to validate observations that the CP is eager to capitalize on, and contro:
if it can, the efforts of racial groups. (1) Demonstration at World's Fair opening, Apri
1964, resulted in a number of arrests and there was a definite indication ef communist
participation as well as direction of demonstrations. (2) On 5/18/64 New York State
was the scene of state-wide demonstrations against school segregation. Communists
participated and in other ways were involved. (3) Plans are underway for some form
of small size march on Washington 6/15/64 relative to civil rights legislation presently
being debated in the Senate. Communists are involved in this planned activity. (4)
During the last two weeks St. Augustine, Florida, has been the scene of a number of
racial demonstrations. Martin Luther King, Jr., an individual of extreme importance
to the Bureau from an investigative standpoint has rented a cottage in this area for three
months where it is anticipated he will become involved in long-range plans to demon-
strate in that area. (5) Cambridge, Maryland, for some time the seat of numerous
demonstrations, is of interest because of the influence in these demonstrations of one
of the party's national committee members. (6) There is some indication of a large
“civil rights rally to be held in Chicago some time in June, 1964, where communist
influence and participation are expected. (7) Martin Luther King and others have been
recruiting college students from various parts of the country to participate in a mass
voter registration project in the State of Mississippi. The usual communist elements
are expected to be involved. (8) Plans are already underway for some racial activity
to take place in commemoration of the 8/28/63 march on Washington and information
has been received indicating a nationwide work stoppage will be made. The above are
a sampling of the CP's interest in the race movement.

The above are among the considerations which the two agents assigned to
the special program would have to follow, correlate and disseminate, if necessary.

In addition to following and analyzing the flow of information already coming from the
field, in anticipation of the need to more clearly define tie extent of CP influence in
the racial'‘movement, DID recently issued instructions to the field to direct the field's
attention to this area of thinking and contemplates additional follow-up instructions in
the near future.

NW 68262 Docld:32989648 Page 286



pau The two Agents designated to b indle the ‘ine spec assignment have substantial
Case loads at this time and would contint : to handle some of the same cases they are
now supervising because of their pertine..ce to the proposed assignment; however, as
of 6/2/64, 78 cases of one supervisor and 69 (total 147) of the other would have to be '
reassigned to other supervisors in the Internal Security Section for handling if the two
Agents were assigned full time to the proposed project. Recent figures (6/2 20/64)
indicate the Internal Security Section had 19 Special Agents assigned to supervise 3293
cases. As of January, 1964, this section had 2928 cases and 22 supervisors or an .
increase of 365 cases + 1d a decrease of 3 supervisors. The overtime of the Internal
Security Section has b en consistent with the Division's overtime for two months and
above the Division's « sertime three of the last five months for which figures are avail-
able. In all instance ., the overtime has been substantially above two hours. In
addition, since 1/2/: 1, the Internal Security Section has had a total of 279 items or an
average of 12,6 iter ‘per week delinquent which it estimates would take approximately
19 additional hours per week to clear, implying that the present staff is not excessive.

CONCLUSIONS The Internal Security Section of DID in recognition of the need

for concentrated attention being given to the strongly implied CP
interest in the racial situation has proposed assigning on a temporary basis two of its
experienced supervisors to the direction and correlation of a program designed to give
closer scrutiny to developments arising out of communist interest in racial groups.
To accomplish this, that Section has requested the assignment of one Agent supervisor
who will handle a portiou of approximately 147 cases now Supervised by Lwo Ageuls -
and would be left unassigned after the assignments of the two men to the special project
Surplus assignments over and above those which one Agent could handle would be parce
out among other supervisors in the Section. The implied necessity for the next few
months of special attention being given to CP interests in and ambitions to control the
race picture is recognizable to the Inspection Division and other data obtained in survey
ing the DID request for one man on a temporary basis appears to be supported by case
load, overtime, delinquency, and the nature of the cases supervised. The placement
of a Washington Field Office Agent in this assignment as suggested by DID would, of

RE: INTERNAL SECURITY SECTION
DOMESTIC INTELLIGENCE DIVISION

66-1885-S

NEED FOR ADDITIONAL SUPERVISOR:

Supervisor Phillips will leave 69 cases which he is
currently supervising in the CPUSA Units” The three remaining men
in this Unit cannot absorb these 69 cases, This Unit is already
heavily assigned and a number of the investigations being super-
vised by this Unit, [such as the Solo casey the communist youth
groups and the appearance of communist leaders on college campuses,
require exacting and time-consuming attention, Supervisor Rosack
will leave 84 cases in the Communist Front Unit, and that Unit
with its two remaining supervisors will not be able to assimilate
these 84 cases, There will be a total of 153 cases left unassigned.
Although one supervisor cannot handle all 153 cases, we will be
able to assimilate these 153 cases, with some adjustments, with the
addition of one supervisor to the Section,

It is not possible to absorb these cases in other Units
of the Section with our current complement, In support of this
statement, I would like to point out that in January, 1963, we had
22 supervisors assigned to the Section and were carrying a load of
2,928 cases, We currently have 19 supervisors assigned to the
Section and are carrying a load of.3,293 cases. This is an increase
ef 365 cases and a decrease of three supervisors, We have had a
delinquency in the Section since January, 1964, We have not been
able to erase this delinquency although we have made a determined
effort to do so and our voluntary overtime has been considerably in
excess of two hours per man per day.’ °~”° :

We cannot foresee at this time for how longa period of
time it will be necessary for us to have two supervisors assigned
exclusively to the communist penetration into the racial movement

| cases; therefore » I suggest we have an be aban dy setiewaed apn.
assigned to the Section on a temporary basis. mig! ie poss: e
to get a man from the Washington Fi Office who has had previous
experience as a supervisor in Secur: work at the Seat of Govern-
ment, It is contemplated that as soon as we can safely do so 7
Supervisors Phillips and Rosack will be sent back to their respective
Units and at that time the supervisor from Washington Field Office

} will be sent back to his office.

ADDENDUM BY INSPECTION DIVISION AB seine 6/4/64

The Internal Security Section, Domestic Intelligence Division (DID), has
requested one additional supervisor to be assigned to that Section on a temporary basis
to handle case assignments vacated by two experienced supervisors whom DID desires
to devote full time to directing field efforts, correlating ‘results, and preparing for
dissemination investigative information obtained resulting from strongly implied Com-
munist Party (CP) efforts to infiltrate and dominate noncommunist racial groups' efforts
in the Summer of 1964 to whip the racial situation to a peak period of disturbances.
Urgency for the FBI to "stay ahead" of the situation is tied to pending civil rights
legislation and foreseeable ramifications arising out of the complex political situations
in an election year where civil rights and social disturbances will play a key role in
campaign efforts and possibly election results,

The assigning of full-time personnel to the proposed correlation assignments
is considered to be established by recent occurrences not set out by DID in its request
and which tend to validate observations that the CP is eager to capitalize on, and control
if it can, the efforts of racial groups. (1) Demonstration at World's Fair opening, April,
1964, resulted in a number of arrests and there was a definite indication of communist.
participation as well as direction of demonstrations. (2) On 5/18/64 New York State
was the scene of state-wide demonstrations against school segregation. Communists
participated and in other ways were involved. (3) Plans are underway for some form
of small size march on Washington 6/15/64 relative to civil rights legislation presently
being debated in the Senate. Communists are involved in this planned activity. (4)
During the last two weeks St. Augustine, Florida, has been the scene of a number of
racial demonstrations. Martin Luther King, Jr., an individual of extreme importance
to the Bureau from an investigative standpoint has rented a cottage in this area for three
months where it is anticipated he will become involved in long-range plans to demon-
strate in that area. (5) Cambridge, Maryland, for some time the seat of numerous
demonstrations, is of interest because of the influence in these demonstrations of one
of the party's national committee members. (6) There is some indication of a large
civil rights rally to be held in Chicago some time in June, 1964, where communist
influence and participation are expected. (7) Martin Luther King and others have been
recruiting college students from various parts of the country to participate in a mass
voter registration project in the State of Mississippi. The usual communist elements
are expected to be involved. (8) Plans are already underway for some racial activity
to take place in commemoration of the 8/28/63 march on Washington and information
has been received indicating a nationwide work stoppage will be made. The above are
a sampling of the CP's interest in the race movement.

The above are among the considerations which the two agents assigned to
the special program would have to follow, correlate and disseminate, if necessary.

In addition to following and analyzing the flow of information already coming from the
field, in anticipation of the need to more clearly define the extent of CP influence in
the racial movement, DID recently issued instructions to the field to direct the field's
attention to this area of thinking and contemplates additional follow-up instructions in
the near future,

NW 68262 Docld:32989648 Page 292



; “4
oS e 7 °

The two Agents designated to handle the special assignment have substantial
case loads at this time and would continue to handle some of the same cases they are
now supervising because of their pertinence to the proposed assignment; however, as
of 6/2/64, 78 cases of one supervisor and 69 (total 147) of the other would have to be
reassigned to other supervisors in the Internal Security Section for handling if the two
Agents were assigned full time to the proposed project. Recent figures (5/20/64)
indicate the Internal Security Section had 19 Special Agents assigned to supervise 3293
cases. As of January, 1964, this section had 2928 cases and 22 supervisors or an
increase of 365 cases and a decrease of 3 supervisors. The overtime of the Internal
Security Section has been consistent with the Division's overtime for two months and
above the Division's overtime three of the last five months for which figures are avail-
able. In all instances, the overtime has been substantially above two hours, In
addition, since 1/2/64, the Internal Security Section has had a total of 279 items or an
average of 12.6 items per week delinquent which it estimates would take approximately
19 additional hours per week to clear, implying that the present staff is not excessive.

CONCLUSIONS The Internal Security Section of DID in recognition of the need

for concentrated attention being given to the strongly implied CP
interest in the racial situation has proposed assigning on a temporary basis two of its
experienced supervisors to the direction and correlation of a program designed to give
closer scrutiny to developments arising out of communist interest in racial groups.
To accomplish this, that Section has requested the assignment of one Agent supervisor
who will handle a portion of approximately 147 cases now supervised by two Agents
and would be left unassigned after the assignments of the two men to the special project.
Surplus assignments over and above those which one Agent could handle would be parcel:
out among other supervisors in the Section. The implied necessity for the next few
months of special attention being given to CP interests in and ambitions to control the
race picture is recognizable to the Inspection Division and other data obtained in survey
ing the DID request for one man on a temporary basis appears to be supported by case
load, overtime, delinquency, and the nature of the cases supervised. The placement
of a Washington Field Office Agent in this assignment as suggested by DID would, of

course, inv staffi i i i i ite-up. The Inspection Div,

agrees aBvodie, Staging, cons ige Fahy qt pertinent to this wrt fie" resent time.

RECOMMENDATIONS 1, That one Special Agent be assigned to the Internal Security
Section, Domestic Intelligence Division, on temporary

basis. If approved, should be handled by Mr. Mohr's Office.

i
Y

2. That this situation be re-evaluated 10/1/64 in view of the
request for temporary assistance. The above date is compatible with Domestic
Intelligence Division and sh ould allow sufficient time for an accurate assessment
of the validity of the program involved. If approved, Domestic Intelligence Division
should submit memorandum 10/1/64 evaluating program and making appropriate
recommendations regarding assignment or reassignment of temporary supervisor.

_ My. memorandum to you. 5/20/64 pointed out the increasing work...

the racial movement and the importance of this problem to the Bureau.
&t was: recommended, and approved, that two Supervisors he separated
from their current assignments, one in the Communist Party Unit and
the other in the Communist Front Unit, and that they be attached to a
mewly created special Desk te concentrate on-the investigation into as
the cemnunist influence in racial matters. fo assimilate the other — :

visor be assigned on'a temporary basis with the thought that as soon as
we could safely do so, the two Supervisors concentrating on the commu—
nist influence in racial matters would ke sent back to their respective
Units, This matter was looked into by the inspection Division, which
Pecommended, and it was approved, that an additional Supervisor be.

that this situation be re-evaluated 10/1/64 and a memorandum submitted

ancreased. We have been handling a high volume of priority werk in 7
this area dealing with such major projects as the racial disorders and
demonstrations in New York City and the Mississippi Suumer Project +

This is presently taking the fuli time of one Supervisor, in addition ”
to a full-time clerical employee. iIn.this regard, it should be noted
that whereas we originally started this special Unit with two Super=
visors, we now have three. When the new Uait was created, there were 7
assigned to it approximately 120 cases. As of 10/1/64, this. figure t
has increased ta 134 cases. All indicators point to a continued heavy

work load relative to the communist influence in racial matters. This
has become a big factor relative to the forthcoming national elections

and, in addition, theré aré définite indications that the MSP will be ~~

a continuing thing, There have also been some indications that activ-
ities such as the MSP will extend into other states. In addition,
under date of 8/28/64, a letter was submitted to all offices instruct~
ing a broadening of our investigation into the communist influence in
racial matters and the setting up of a new and more intensified report-
ing procedure. Due 11/1/64 are comprehensive investigative reports
from all field offices which will provide centralized reporting on this
matter.
The Communist Front Unit, which is where the temporary Super~
visor is assigned, has also shown an increase in its case load. As of

10/1/64 the Communist Front Unit had 392 pending investigations as com-..

pared to 375 pending investigations as of 7/1/64. The recent Supreme
Court decisions favorable to the Party unde: various--facets of the
Internal Security Act of 1950 have breathed new life into the Party.
The Party is now taking bolder steps to carry on its work in mass
organizations, as well as creating new front organizations. One case
in point is that dealing with the W. E. B. DuBois Clubs of America,
Inc., the new national Party youth organization. The formation of
this youth group was finalized at a National Convention in June, 1964,
_Which was held in San Francisco, California, and was attended by
approximately 450 youths. Since that time several affiliates of this
group have come into existence. One of the plans for action decided
upon by the group was to have affiliates of the group formed on college
campuses throughout the United States; therefore, it can be expected
that in the immediate future after these various youths have returned
to their college campuses, they will form such campus groups. This
will represent not only an increase in case load, but will also
increase the work of the field in penetrating and following the
activities of such groups. This will call for close supervision of
these groups due to the nature of the make-up of the clubs and the

_ fact that they are located on college campuses in order to avoid any
embarrassment to the Bureau. It is also anticipated that with the
advent of the fall and winter seasons, the Party will step up its
activities in attempting to penetrate legitimate mass organizations
and in establishing new front groups to carry on the Party's work on. ~
issues in which the Party will have an interest.

ADDENDUM: (E ters 12/7/65)

,  Al‘review of the personnel file of SA Richard F. Bates reveals no reason
why he should not be approved as Supervisor in Charge of the Communist

by Domestic Intelligence Division. Bates has never been the subject of
disciplinary action more severe than censure. Prior to his transfer to the
Bureau he served as Supervisor of a Security Matter - C squad in the New York
Office for three years. He appears to be completely knowledgeable as to all
aspects of the Bureau's investigations of security matters, rated excellent
on the last annual performance rating. Weight and overtime satisfactory.

‘Accordingly, it is recommended that Supervisor Richard F. Bates be

to the Bureau must be made promptly.

The desirable coverage must include, but not be
limited to, the following investigation, These investigations
must be conducted with initiative and imagination in order that
the desired results are achieved, Each of these cases will
receive close scrutiny at the Bureau,

(1) All KBEs must be included in Priority I of
the Security Index, If not already so included, promptly
submit FD-122,

(2) All KBEs must be included in the Black
Nationalist Photograph Album (BNPA). Promptly submit
photograph and required background on each KBE not
presently in the BNPA and when a subject is designated
a KBE.

(3) All aspects of the finances of a KBE must
be determined, Bank accounts must be monitored, Safe
deposit boxes, investments, and hidden assets must be
located and available information regarding them must be
reported,

(4) Continued consideration must be given by
each office to develop means to neutralize the effectiveness
of each KBE, Any counterintelligence proposal must be approved
by the Bureau prior to implementation,

(5) Obtain suitable handwriting specimens of each
KBE to be placed in the National Security File in the
Laboratory, When possible, obtain specimens from public
records, law enforcement agencies, and similar sources.°
Send specimens to the Bureau under separate cover letter
by registered mail for the attention of the FBI Laboratory.
When they are of value as evidence, so state in the transmittal
letter and request their return after copies have been made.
Specimens should be sufficient to permit future comparisons by
the Laboratory.

“ (6) Particular efforts should be made to obtain records
of and/or reliable witnesses to, inflammatory statements made
which may subsequently become subject to criminal proceedings.
Promptly record all such information in interview report form.

(7) Where there appears to be a possible violation
of a statute within the investigative jurisdiction of the
Bureau, the substantive violation character should be included
in subsequent communications and the possible violation
vigorously investigated in accordance with existing instructions.

(8) Particular attention must be paid to travel by

its validity and the amount being charged to that card on a
continuing basis. Travel information must be submitted to
the Bureau and interested offices by appropriate communication
to permit coverage of the KBE, It will be the responsibility
of the office of origin to insure that the activities of the
KBE are covered by auxiliary offices.

(9) The Federal income tax returns of all KBEs must
be checked annually in accordance with existing instructions.

If no investigative summary report has been submitted
in each case, such a report must be submitted to the Bureau by

Because of theyiolence potential of all biack extremists,
we have required that the field give priority attentiom.to the

‘py the field indicates that there is a need for intensified coverage
on a group of black extremists who are either key leaders or
activists and are particularly extreme, agitative, anti-Government,
and vocal in their calls for terrorism and violence. Leaders of
the violence-prone Black Panther Party have indicated that the
"revolution" is entering the beginning phases of actual armed
struggle and our investigations indicate there are certain extremists
more likely to resort to or to order terrorism as a ate and
therefore require particular attention,

Memorandum to Mr. E. S. Miller
Re: Key Black Extremist Program

Inasmuch as KBE individuals are of the type who would be
subject to maximum investigative attention and close supervision,
the administration and supervision of this program entails only a
minimum amount of time above that which would normally be
expended on these cases.

The continuing revolutionary activities of the individuals
designated as KBEs warrant the close investigative and supervisory
attention required by the KBE program. This program will be
reevaluated in December, 1972.

RECOMMENDATION :

That the KBE program be continued.

Memorandum to Mr. E. S. Miller
Re: Key Extremist Program

The KBE program proved to be a successful vehicle to
insure constant and uniform investigation of such individuals by
the field and the KE concept should do likewise.

Appropriate Manual changes will be made. This program
will be reviewed in December, 1973.

RECOMMENDATION :
1. That the existing KBE program be revised to include

individuals involved in white-hate Klan-type and American Indian
extremist activity and redesignated the KE program.

2. That the attached airtel containing instructions in line
with the above be sent to all offices.

A preliminary analysis of the Key Extremist Program (KEP)
by FBIHQ, including discussions with supervisory and investigative {
personnel who have been attending special Extremist Matters In- :
Service ‘classes, ‘indicates that constant investigative attention is SO
not always being afforded individuals who have been designated as &
Key Extremists. All offices are reminded that KEP was instituted in Q
1970 es the Key Black Extremist Program to provide guidelines for
intensive investigation of certain black extremist leaders and 4
activists whose endorsement and/or involvement in revolutionary and Ny
terrorist activity warranted priority attention, In January, 1973,
the program was redesignated KEP and revised to include key white-hate _\
Klan-type extremists and American Indian extremists in addition to

black extremists, There are approximately 90 individuals throughout NS
the country currently designated as Key Extremists in some 27 field

Re: Key Extremist Program
157-8415

In order to make a thorough overall analysis and
reevaluation of the KEP at FBIHQ and to assist each office in
analyzing the effectiveness of its own program, the following survey
is to be conducted:

I, Each office is to examine pending cases on individual
extremists (black, white-hate Klan-type, and American Indian) within
its territory to insure all who warrant designation as a Key Extremist
are so designated and those individuals currently designated as Key
Extremists warrant retention as same, By airtel to reach the Bureau
by 7/2/73 under the caption. "Key Extremist Program, ___ Division,
Extremist Matters," advise the Bureau that this survey has been
completed and identify apnropriate individual extremists by name,"-
character, Bureau and field file numbers under the following self-
explanatory captions:

UA "Individuals Currently Designated Key Extremists"

B. "Individuals Designated Key Extremists Who No Longer
Warrant Retention as a Key Extremist"

C, “Individuals Who Warrant Designation as a Key Extremist"

If the answer under any one of the three captions is "None," so
state,

: II, Those offices with individual extremists listed under
above captions’ B and C, submit by the same date in airtel form
under the individual's case caption your recommendation for inclusion
or deletion of that individual from the KEP, Full justification
should be set out and Bureau will act on your recommendation,

III, Those offices with current individual Key Extremists
(caption A above) submit by the same date in airtel form under
the individual case cantion the answer to the following questions,
by number, relative to that individual:

1. Is the subject included on the ADEX? If not, and
recommendation to include or to delete from the old ADEX
criteria has not yet been submitted, submit your recommendation

submitted and the individual has not been included or has been

therein. .

3, Outline the nature of the coverage you have of subject's
finances, specifically indicating if bank accounts are or are
not being monitored. If bank accounts are not being monitored,
give reasons therefor.

4, If warranted, has the Bureau been specifically :
requested to obtain subject's tax returns? If not, give your
reasons for not considering this investigative step.

been completed on the subject?

If the answers to questions number 5 through 9 above are
in the negative, outline in another paragraph immediately under the
answer the specific steps underway or being instituted by your

office to fulfill this investigative requirement.

Some confusion regarding Key Extremists has arisen over
the new ADEX criteria outlined in Memorandum to All SACs 21-72 dated
9/12/72. This revised criteria make it possible to have an extremist
who warrants designation as a Key Extremist and yet does not meet the’
new criteria for inclusion on the ADEX, Such individuals may continue
to be designated as Key Extremists. : -

Additional confusion has also arisen over reporting require-
ments which were relaxed by above-mentioned Memorandum to Al] SACs.
Hereafter, individuals designated as Key Extremists are to be considered
as exceptions to the above memorandum under Item 4d, Page 8, and reports -
on Key Extremists are to be regularly submitted every 90 days. If no
report has been submitted on a Key Extremist within the past 90 days,
promptly prepare and submit an up-to-date report and submit follow-up
reports thereafter on a 90-day basis.

* Section 122 of the Manual of Instructions is being revised :
to outline more clearly the criteria for designating black, white-hate i
Klan-type, and American Indian extremists as Key Extremists as wel’ as :
the ADEX status of and reporting procedures for Key Extremists.

All offices insure in the future that hew cases on individual
extremists are carefully scrutinized to see if they warrant designation
as a Key Extremist, and that an appropriate recommendation is promptly
submitted to the Bureau.

Re: Key Extremist Program

Extremists under investigation, the identity of Key Extremists who
no longer warrant designation as such, the identity of individual
extremists who should.be designated Key Extremists, and to deter-
mine if required investigative steps are being followed with respect
to those individuals designated as Key Extremists.

: Originally, all Key Extremists were to be included in the
ADEX, Recent changes in ADEX criteria require an individual included
therein to be dangerous now to national security and some confusion
has resulted in the field over whether or not Key Extremists must be
removed as Key Extremists if they do not qualify for ADEX, The field
is being instructed that this is not necessary and an individual can
be a Key Extremist and still not qualify for ADEX, Confusion also
exists as to when reports are to be submitted on Key Extremists due
to recent relaxation of reporting rules. Original instructions
required reports on Key Extremists every 90 days and this is being
reiterated,

We currently have throughout the Uniied States a total of
90 individual extremists designated as Key Extremists in 27 separate
field offices, The New York Office has 19 and the San Francisco
Office has 16, The number of Key Extremists in the remaining 25
offices range from one to eight. The results of analysis by each
field office will be thoroughly analyzed and evaluated by the IS - 1
Section with additional instructions issued, if warranted.

RACIAL MATTERS Gat

4b"

In view of increasing problems with which we are
faced in the overall racial field, particularly in the
development of racial intelligence concerning militant awe
black nationalist elements, we have carefully analyzed our eee
informant program to place proper emphasis where needed,
Although we are making progress in developing racial sources
in the ghettos, we feel we can do much more and must do so
rapidly in the coming six months to be prepared for another
potential summer of violence. Proposed SAC letter attached.

a To accomplish our objective of thorough penetration
of the ghettos with a network of quality sources under a
crash program, the following procedures will be instituted to
carry out this program, The individuals we will be con-
tacting under this crash informant program will be living in
the ghettos; therefore, in the absence of any derogatory in
formation developed, background investigation should consist
of a check of field office indices, Bureau indices, FBI
Identification Division records, and local credit and arrest
records. Of course, prior to instituting any background
investigation to qualify a ghetto informant, he must be in a ;
position to furnish racial information and must be willing “homer,
to cooperate with the Bureau. This individual will be carried “
as a probationary racial informant and the Agent contacting
him will be constantly alert for any indications of character
traits or activities which might cause embarrassment to the
Bureau. In addition, the information furnished by such an
informant will not be taken face value but will be verified
through other sources and investigation where possible.

In addition, we are specifically instructing that
security informants active in the racial field be designated
as racial informants and that their activities be supervised
by the Racial Informant Desk. We are also reiterating our
instructions that it is imperative and essential that the
Bureau learn of any. advance planning or organized conspiracy

Memorandum to Mr. Sullivan

Re: Racial Informants

on the part of individuals or organizations in connection
with riots and racial disturbances, We are also reiterating
the instructions that informants should be alerted and di-
rected to obtain information concerning individuals who may
be stockpiling firebombs, Molotov cocktails, and weapons,
and to identify any groups of terrorists who may be planning
on carrying on a type of guerrilla warfare during riotous
situations.

In connection with our intensive investigation of

lack militant groups, we are requiring all offices engaged
in the Black Nationalist Groups TOPLEV Informant Program
(There are 35 field offices involved in this Program.) to
assign a minimum of one Agent to work exclusively on infor-
mant matters. The results of this endeavor will be reviewed
after a three-month pilot period and additional recommenda~
tions will be made accordingly. The field will be followed
closely to insure that the number and quality of racial in-
formants are developed at a regular rate.

(Gc) RACIAL INFORMANTS - RACIAL MATTERS -- In view of the in-
creasing problems with which we are faced in the racial field, particularly
in the development of racial intelligence concerning militant black
nationalist elements, a careful analysis of this matter has been made in
order to insure that proper emphasis is placed where needed. Also, in
order to afford better coordination over all interrelated racial security
matters (individuals and organizations) including the development of
racial informants, supervision is now being handled by the Racial
Intelligence Section of the Domestic Intelligence Division. For your
information, the Subversive Control Section is no longer in existence.
The investigation of the Communist Party and related matters other

than those with a racial aspect are being handled by the Internal Security
Section.

Our analysis of the racial informant program has shown
there is a definite need to develop additional penetrative coverage of the
militant black nationalist groups and the ghetto areas immediately to
be in a position to have maximum intelligence in anticipation of another
outburst of racial violence next summer.

In line with our objective, particular emphasis is being
placed on the development of ghetto-type racial informants. Individuals
to qualify as this type of informant must live or work in an area described
as a ghetto and, therefore, have access to pertinent racial information.
The steps necessary to qualify such an individual are as follows:

(1) The individual must have access to racial intelligence
information and must be willing to cooperate with the Bureau in furnish-
ing such information.

(2) In the absence of any derogatory information developed,
it will be necessary for you to check the following: field office indices,
FBI Identification Division records, and local credit and arrest records.
Of course, you must develop sufficient background data concerning each
prospective informant to allow an intelligent. check of the foregoing
records to be made. As to the method of recommending to the Bureau
that an individual be approved as a racial informant (ghetto-type), be
guided by the instructions set out in Section 130, Volume IV, Manual
of Instructions, concerning probationary racial informants.

“ o e

All individuals recommended and approved as ghetto-type
racial informants will be considered probationary racial informants
with the word "ghetto" after the informant's name or symbol. An
example of this is "John Jones, Probationary Racial Informant (Ghetto)"
or "NY 1234-R (PROB - Ghetto). "

Agents handling these ghetto-type probationary racial inform-
ants must be constantly alert for any indications of character traits or
activities of these informants which might cause embarrassment to the
Bureau. In addition, the information furnished by these informants
should not be taken at face value. A diligent attempt-must be made
to verify all information furnished by these informants through a
sources and/or investigation.

In addition, immediately review all security informant files
for the purpose of determining which security informants are solely or
predominantly active in the racial field. Examples would be individuals
furnishing information concerning the Minutemen, as well as the Nation
of Islam, Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, Congress of
Racial Equality, and other militant black nationalist-type groups. ‘The
security designation of these informants should be changed to the
appropriate racial informant designation. For example, a potential
security informant should be made a probationary racial informant and
a security informant should be designated as a racial informant. There-
after, they should be operated principally in the racial field and super-
vised by the Racial Informant Desk. When an informant is changed from
a security informant to a racial informant, the field classification
number should be changed to a 170 classification. Advise the Bureau
promptly as to which security informants are being converted to racial
informants.

In addition, each office having a, Black Nationalist Groups
TOPLEV Informant Program is to immediately assign at least one
Agent to work exclusively on developing informants under this Program.
Each office participating in this Program will submit at the end of a
three-month period appropriate observations as to the success of the
Program and recommendations as to its continuance.

As [have advised in the past, it is imperative and essential
that the Bureau learn of any indications of advance planning or organized

To obtain approval to send a letter to all con-
tinental offices concerning the need for additional ghetto

informant coverage.

BACKGROUND :

Following the murder of Martin Luther King, Jr.;
Bureau Agents conducted numerous interviews in ghetto

areas of U. S.

cities as a result of racial disorders.

views are avaluable source of untapped informant potential?

Productive contacts made with individuals diring these ual

By, following up these interviews by recontacting cooperative
residents of the ghetto areas, the Bureau can obtain a
higher quality and larger number of ghetto informants.
Receiving offices are instructed to exploit this situation
by developing, through contacts made during riots, additional
probationary racial informants (ghetto).

OBSERVATIONS:

) In the wake of the racial upheavals following the
EEE murder of Martin Luther King, Jr., numerous U. S. cities
\ roe experienced racial violence in various degrees.

\ In keeping the Bureau and interested agencies
fully advised of the rapidly developing events in these
cities, Bureau Agents interviewed a great number of
individuals who were in positions to report on the under-
currents prevalent in the ghetto areas of these cities.

Undoubtedly these interviews opened up a whole
new avenue of informant development, on a block-to-block :
basis, in the crucial areas of the ghettos of American dy

cities.
.

Those offices covering cities which recently
experienced racial strife are expected to take immediate
steps to exploit this situation and increase the quality
and quantity of ghetto informant coverage.

Those individuals in the ghetto areas who furnished
valuable information to the Bureau in these crises
should be reinterviewed and consideration given to oe

,On May 16, 1968, the Executive Conference, consisting
of Messrs, DeLoach, Mohr, Sullivan, Tavel, Casper, Callahan,
Trotter, Conrad, Gale, Bishop, Scatterday for Rosen, Walters
for Felt, and Beaver, considered a recommendation by Assistant
Director Sullivan that a survey be made of the Negro ghetto
areas where violence has occurred or where there is a concen-
tration of militant, violence~prone, black power elements in ;
order to determine the racial informant coverage in those areas,
Complete details are set out in attached memorandum and proposed
letter to all continental offices dealing with this matter,
Basically, the purpose of this survey is to enable both the
field and the Bureau to evaluate the adequacy of informant
coverage in these areas and to pinpoint areas in which added
coverage is needed,

The purpose of this memorandum is to recommend
approval for the attached letter to all continental field
divisions which contains instructions to furnish to the
Bureau information concerning ghetto-type informant coverage
in Negro ghetto areas where there has been violence or where
today there is a concentration of militant violence prone
black power elements and the adequacy of such coverage.

By SAC Letter 67-62 (G) dated 10/17/67 captioned
"Racial Informants, Racial Matters," all offices were given
instructions and guidelines for the development of ghetto-type
racial informants in areas where potential racial violence }
exists. We have aggressively followed this matterwith the f 7
field since that time but because of the widely divergent C/
nature of cities across the Nation where possible racial
problems exist, we have been unable to precisely evaluate the
extent of the need of ghetto-type informants in each division.
Attached letter to all continental offices requires the submission
by each office of factual information concerning the numbers
of all Negro ghetto areas where there has been violence or
where today there is a concentration of militant violence prone
black power elements, an estimate of the population of each
such area, and statistics concerning the numbers of ghetto-type
racial informants developed to cover such areas. It also
requires that each field division advise how many ghetto
informants it believes it should have in each of the above
type ghetto areas in order to provide the ae required

by the Bureau. ee oy -66- . oO. / LS

Memorandum to Mr. W. C. Sullivan

RE: RACIAL INFORMANTS

Attached letter will serve two purposes. Each
office will have to make a factual survey of pertinent
aspects of the racial problem in all urban areas covered
by it. This survey will serve to drive home to each office
the size of the potential problem in each division and will
force each office to formulate concrete plans for developing
adequate informant coverage where such has not already been
done. Secondly, the information submitted by each office
will give the Bureau a comprehensive picture of the potential
problem in each division which will enable the Bureau to
more effectively evaluate the adequacy of the ghetto-type
racial informant program in each office. Supervisory personnel
will be able to more easily detect shortcomings and weaknesses
in any given division with this information at hand.

To obtain the information requested by this letter
should not be a burden on the field in that it should only
take the time of one Agent for less than one day to compile
the information concerning the ghetto areas from the information
already available in the field divisions. It is to be noted
that on every inspection the inspector requires the field
to identify its ghetto areas and those areas having a potential
for violence.

RECOMMENDATION:

That the attached proposed letter to all continental
field offices in accordance with the above, be approved.

RE: RACIAL INFORMANTS

For your guidance, the goal you ‘Should be setting
as’to how many ghetto informants are needed in a particular
area is that your coverage should be such that you are completely
knowledgeable concerning all pertinent racial activities in a
particular area, The type of information you should be receiving
from your ghetto informants is advance information as to whether
anyone is planning to cause a racial disturbance, stockpiling
weapons for use during a racial disturbance, full details
concerning the activitles of militant black nationalists and
white extremists in ghetto areas, as well as any other activitier
which may bring about a racial disturbance,

I expect that immediate attention will be given this
matter and I alse expect that the Bureau will be kept advised
of progress being made in this field, Progress will be followed
closely and the desired results are expected to be produced,

RACIAL MATTERS

PURPOSE:

To obtain authority to send the attached letter to
all Special Agents in Charge changing the maximum permissible
period between contacts with ghetto-type racial informants
from two weeks, as presently required by the Manual of
Instructions, to one month.

BACKGROUND:

The ghetto-type racial informant program was
established in October, 1967, to develop sources living or
working in ghetto areas who are in a position to keep the
Bureau advisedaf situations of potential violence. Ghetto~
type racial informants are distinguished from regular racial
informants in that they are not associated with or reporting
regularly on black extremists, Their primary purpose is to
detect and report on all violence-prone elements, .activities,
and situations in ghetto areas which could spark riots or
assist black extremists in any way.

REGULAR RACIAL INFORMANTS STILL CONTACTED AT LEAST EVERY
TWO WEEKS:

No change in present Manual of Instructions require-
ments that regular racial informants be contacted at least
once every two weeks is contemplated. Because of the rapport
established with ghetto-type racial informants, the field is
often able to direct such informants into membership in or
association with black extremist groups. When suchis the

case, these individuals are converted from ghetto-type racial
informants to regular racial informants, If approval is given
to extend the maximum. period between contacts with established
ghetto-type racial informants to one month, any such informant
who is converted to a regular racial informant will again be
subject to the requirement that he be contacted at least once
every two weeks.

OBSERVATIONS :

Laborers, clerks, housewives, businessmen, and
numerous other types of individuals are developed as ghetto-
type racial informants, Frequent initial contacts with each
such individual are necessary (1) to establish adequate rapport,
(2) to insure that each such individual is fully aware of the
nature of and the seriousness of his assignments, and (3) to
establish adequate channels of communications suitable for
use at any time. Once these goals are achieved, the informant
can be considered established and contacts every two weeks are
no longer necessary since the primary purpose of each such
informant is to remain alert to information of value and promptly
relay same. Once a ghetto-~type racial informant is established,
contacts once each month will be adequate, To definitely fix
the time at which a ghetto-type racial informant is considered
established, the Special Agent handling this informant will be
required to place a memorandum in informant's file stating
| that requirements (1), (2), and (3), mentioned above, have been
met and that informant is considered established.

SAVINGS FROM LENGTHENING PERIOD BETWEEN CONTACTS:

As of August 1, 1968, there were 3,248 ghetto-
type racial informants developed by the field, New anformants
of this type are developed daily, Since Special Agents handling
this type informant are presently required to contact each such
individual at least once every two weeks, there are a minimum
of 6,496 contacts being made each month. Even if a contact
lasts but a few minutes, the manpower expenditure is considerable.
If the maximum permissible period between contacts is extended
to one month, manpower expenditures will be cut in half.

ACTION:

el If approved, attached letter to all Special Agents
in Charge will be sent in accordance with the above and appropriate
Manual changes will be prepared. 4

As a result of the recent conferences concerning
vaclal informants held at the Seat of Government, it has
been recommended and approved that there be greater utilization
of our ghetto racial informants.

The Ghetto Racial Informant Program was instituted é
in July, 1967, and at that time there was a need for developing! i
a network of listening posts in order that the Bureau would

have available maximum intelligence in the event of racial
ebursts. In line with the original purpose, this program _

The attendees at the ‘¥ecent conferences “noted that

me £ield divisions were operating their ghetto informants

& listening posts whereas other field divisions were giving
mdny of their ghetto informants positive assignments. In

der to achieve greater efficiency in our informant operations,
consideration must be given to giving many of our ghetto
informants positive assignments. These assignments should
include but not necessarily be Limited to attendance at public
meetings held by extremists, surveys of extremist bookstores,

Index subjects who may live or work in ghetto areas,
identification of extremists who may be agitating in a local
area, as well as furnishing information concerning the
activities of youth gangs operating in the area when these
activities may tend to inerease racial tensions.

It is recognized that certain individuals presently
being operated as ghetto informants would be more useful in
their role as listening posts} therefore, they should be
continued as such.

In line with the above, each ghetto racial informant
file should be reviewed in connection with the regular review

of ghetto informant files in order to determine whether the informany

should be operated as a listening post or whether he should be
given positive assignments as set out above.

In the future development of ghetto racial informants

you should strive to obtain quality ghetto informants,
particularly the type which can be operated so they will be
actively seeking racial information in their ghetto areas.

It is to be noted that when ghetto informants are furnishing
information on a regular basis concerning extremist activity
they should be designated as probationary racial informants
and the ghetto designation deleted. An aggressive and
imaginative approach to the Ghetto Informant Program will
enhance the overall Racial Informant Program in every

field division by producing on a regular basis, individuals
who can be directed to positions where they will have access
to pertinent racial information on a regular baris. -

coverage in ghetto areas, We currently operate 4520 ghetto
informants throughout the Nation, This informant program is
productive with its value having been clearly established, We
have been exploring methods to administratively streamline this
program to reducé paperwork and correspondence; in this regard
it was suggested during a recent Specialized Training of Bureau

\ Personnel conference concerning informant matters that we
discontinue the classification of probationary ghetto informants
and permit Special Agents in Charge to authorize and supervise .
all ghetto informants within their respective territories requir
re ing that only a number count be included in the monthly racial im
yy infotmant progress letter.

: Current, policy, requires that removal of the proba~
tionary status on ghetto informants be on Bureau authority
after notification that specific requirements have been met,
Proposed plan eliminates necessity for the probationary status
and will place all ghetto informants in one classification
upon completion of necessary-requirements on SAC approval.
The,recommended procedure will materially reduce correspondence
between the field and the Bureau, Additionally above
recommendation eliminates the necessity for thé currently
- required two-week contact with probationary ghetto informants

which was necessary at the beginning of the program and will
\ 7 Place all ghetto informants under a thirty-day contact rule F
oN which we feel is more realistic at this time, 7 } i

current policy with regard

to maintenance of subfiles concerning ghetto informants.

As a result of recent specialized training of Bureau
personnel conferences concerning racial matters, it was recommended
, that the maintenance of field office subfiles concerning ghetto in-
‘ formants be left to the option of the Special Agent in Charge (SAC).

Current policy requires that reports written or oral
(reduced to writing) from racial informants including ghetto
informants be filed in a field office subfile. Many ghetto
informants serve only as "listening posts" and often furnish only|
information to the effect all is quiet, This type of information
is considered positive information and according to current re-
quirements a copy of the report should be placed in the informant’
subfile along with a copy in the racial situation control file.

In view of the nature of "Listening post!'!_type infor-
mation it is believed sufficient to place a copy of the report in
the racial situation control file, thereby eliminating the
necessity for its inclusion in a subfile. The above policy change
is considered a streamlining device materially reducing paper work
currently involved in the maintenance of the ghetto filesand will
increase the efficiency of our operation,

RECOMMENDATION:
=D. Oa
That the attached SAC Letter in accordance with above
be approved and sent to all SACs. ie approved, appropriate
Manual changes far be prepared.’ }

(D) GHETTO INFORMANTS - RACIAL MATTERS -- As a result of re-
cent conferences concerning racial informants held at the Seat of Govern-
ment, it has been recommended | and a] approved that ghetto informants be
approved on the authority of the Special Agent in Charge and that the
probationary status of these informants will no longer be necessary.
Current policy requires that before a ghetto informant can be removed
from a probationary status the Bureau must be advised that certain
specific requirements have been satisfied; thereafter, Bureau authori-
zation is given to remove the probationary status of the informant. You
will no longer be required to advise the Bureau of the identity of the
ghetto informants and your only requirement will be to give the number
of ghetto informants currently being operated by your office at the time
you submit your monthly racial informant status report.

Current investigation required concerning development
of ghetto informants will remain in effect and it will be the responsi-
bility of each SAC to assure the necessary requirements are fulfilled
before approving these informants.

In addition to the above change it will no longer be necessary
to contact any ghetto informants on a two-week basis as was required in
the handling of probationary ghetto informants. You are now required
to contact ghetto informants on a 30-day basis.

The above changes do not affect your requirements to ob-
tain Bureau authority concerning ghetto informants who will be utilized
in connection with educational institutions.

The above changes should materially ease the administrative
handling of your Ghetto Informant Program and provide you with more
time to develop additional productive ghetto informants throughout your
territory.

Appropriate Manual changes are forthcoming.

(z) RACIAL INFORMANTS - GHETTO INFORMANTS -- As a result of recent

racial informant conferences held at the Seat of Government, a recom-
mendation was made and approved giving the Special Agent in Charge
(SAC) the option of maintaining subfiles concerning ghetto informants.

As you are aware, current policy concerning subfiles relating

to ghetto informants requires that a subfile be maintained on all ghetto
informants regardless of whether or not they are furnishing only "listen-
ing post" type information. Effective immediately, the maintenance of a
subfile for your ghetto informants is being left to the option of the SAC.
There is little reason to maintain a subfile on those ghetto informants
who are used primarily as “listening posts" and furnish information con-
cerning attitudes and tensions within a ghetto area. It will suffice to
place a copy of the report (FD~-209) in the racial situation control file,
thereby eliminating its inclusion in a subfile.

Subfiles may be necessary in thosé instances when ghetto
informants are reporting valuable substantive information.

Appropriate Manual change forthcoming.

1 This is to justify the continuance of captioned program
in view of the fact that this program is producing substantial 7
accomplishments in the racial field on a regular basis, a a

The Ghetto Informant Program was instituted by memorandum
G. C, Moore to Mr. W. C, Sullivan, dated 10-11-67, captioned
"Racial Informants, Racial Matters." A ghetto informant is an
individual who resides or works in an area described as a ghetto
and can furnish pertinent general racial information. At the
present time we are operating 5,178 ghetto informants and as of }
6-1-69 we were operating 4,067 ghetto informants. This is an Pw,
increase of 1,111 ghetto informants in the past year.

During the past year ghetto informants have been responsible
not only for obtaining valuable racial intelligence in the ghetto
areas but also for bringing about the arrest of 76 individuals, 43
on Federal charges and 33 on local charges. In addition, these
informants were responsible for solving 88 other cases, nine of
which were Federal and 79 local as well as bringing about
vecoveries valued in excess of $67,660. The types of cases
involved in this were bank robberies, mail robberies, stolen
automobiles, deserters, narcotics, assaults and general fugitive
matters,

As to the racial intelligence furnished by ghetto
informants during the past year it has been responsible for not
only preventing racial violence in certain areas but also for
identifying those individuals who have perpetrated violent acts
in connection with racial disturbances. These informants have
\ also furnished information concerning acquisitions of firearms
by racial extremists as well as information concerning individuals
who were attempting to form Black Panther groups in at pr

Memorandum to Mr. W. C. Sullivan
RE: GHETTO INFORMANT PROGRAM

Each continental field office operates ghetto informants
and the analysis of this program definitely shows that the
values achieved from the program as set out above justifies

the continuance of this program. Continued emphasis will be

put on this program.

ACTION:

If approved, this program will be continued and
rejustified in July, 1971.

iin: A racial informant is an individual who is

extremist groups (black or white) as well as information
concerning individuals who are members of these groups.

or works in’ a ghétto area ‘and has access to information
regarding the racial situation and racial activities in

his area which he furnishes to the Bureau on a confidential
basis,

A ghetto informant is an individual who lives 1 vw

The difference between the above types of informants
is that the racial informant is targeted towards extremist
organizations 1s and their ‘members whereas the ghetto informant
furnishes genéral’ racial information and is not a member of

an extremist group.

Purpose of this memorandum is to advise concerning
the racial Ghetto Informant Program in respect to the article
which appeared in Sunday's 7/4/71 edition of "The Washington
Post" highlighting this Program.

"The Washington Post" article captioned: "Analysis
of Stolen FBI Documents Provides Glimpse of Bureau at Work,"
(copy of which is attached), sets out the Bureau instituted
a new program "ghetto informants'' to cover the ghettos of
America, The analysis in the article is based on the
stolen documents from the Media, Pennsylvania, Resident Agency.

The article sets forth that some of the specific ia
i assignments were to attend and report on open meetings of ‘%
knowrt or suspected black extremists, visit black Afro-type
bookstores to determine if extremist literature is available
and report on changes of the attitudes of the Negro communi t
toward the white community which may lead to racial violenée,

aii
The Ghetto Informant Program was instituted in =

October, 1967, by memorandum dated 10/11/67 from G. C. Moore
to Mr. W. C. Sullivan captioned "Racial Informant, Racial Matters."
It was recommended and approved that the Bureau develop sources
living or working in ghetto areas who are in a position to
keep the Bureau advised of situations of potential violence,
This was necessary because of our responsibility of developing
racial intelligence concerning black extremists who could
‘foment: racial violence in the ghetto areas.

Memorandum to Mr. C. D, Brennan
Re: Ghetto Informant Program

This Program has been productive in furnishing racial
intelligence information which has been responsible for not
only preventing racial violence but also identifying individuals
who have perpetrated act of violence during racial disturbances,
identifying individuals attempting to sell explosives,
individuals who participated in firebombings as well as
reporting on the activities while racial disturbances were
occurring.

In addition, these ghetto informants along with all
our racial informants from January to May 31, 1971, were
responsible for bringing about the arrest_of 232 individuals,
on both local and Federal charges, 64~ ich were FBI

fugitives, as well as being responsible for the fecovery of
$63,865 in stolen merchandise,

OBSERVATIONS :

The Ghetto Informant Program is a sound program even
if the liberal press such as "The Washington Post” using
stolen documents attempts to imply that the Bureau through
this Program is checking on every black living in a ghetto
arga. Such a task would be impossible, At the present time
we_have-6,301 ghetto informants throughout the_U,S. These
are mostly Negro individuals who are cooperating with the
Bureau in order to help fight the extremist and criminal

elements in their neighborhoods which jeopardize and disrupt
the law abiding Negro citizen.

BUREAU, From «

They arewateiéd bye
Philadelphia field office’s
by the Philadelphia field of-
fice’s “Racial Squad.”

“Any dissemination of this
information outside the Bu-
reau must be adequately
paraphrased,” the meoran-
dum warned, “in order to
protect this highly sensitive
source.” .

Unfortunately for the bu-
Teau, the memo was dissemi-
nated in the most unortho-
dox way—with its raw tone
of tedious snooping unpara-
Phrased—by burglars who
broke into an FBI office at
Media, Pa, March 8. They
stole 800 to 1,000 documents
that night; approximately 10
per cent of them have since
been made public, copied
and sent to various newspa-
pers which have described
them in a series of articles,

Considered as a whole,
those Media documents
offer the public and Con-
gress an unprecedented
glimpse of how the U.S. gov-
ernment watches its citizens
—Particularly black citizens,

For, while many may con-
sider it natural enough for
the FBI to kee}\ an eye on
the Panthers, ‘the Media
documents establish clearly
that the racial surveillance

is a general activity, blan--

keting black neighborhoods
and organizations, assigning
file members and intelli-
gence folders to thousands
of people and places—from
the Liberation School to
Wimpy’s Cafe in North Pila-
delphia to the Church of the
Advocate on 18th Street.
The Media papers also
provide original insights
into the bureaucracy of citi-
zen surveillance—the moun-

tain of paperwork, the me. :

ticvlous cataloguing of per-
sonal and political minutiae,
* the international incentives
to broaden and deepen the

spying rather than curtail it, .

All are described in the pe-
culiar snub-nosed prose} of
FBI men, blunt and neutral
in tine, unanalytical, the
way Sgt. Friday on “Dray.
net” used to say: “Just the
facts, ma’m,”

NW 68262 Docld:32989648 Page 374

Attempting to draw gener-
alizations from the stolen
parers is a perilous exer-
cise, bedause the press and.
public hav’—béen shown
only a fraction of what was
burglarized. The clandestine
group that calls itself the
“Citizens Commission to In-
vestigate the FBI” clearly
has been selective in its dis-
tribution—in some cases, re-
vealing only parts of docu-
ments.

An FBI memo, which at
first reading seems to reveal
investigative harassment or
unjustified invasion of pri-
vacy, could well be—if other
accompanying documents
were available—part of legi-
timate surveillance in pur-
suit of crime and criminals.

In that-sensey the Media
revelations are inherently
unfair to the Bureau. There
is no way for the agency to
refute many of the implica-
tions without opening its
confidential files to pujlic
inspection. | ;

In addition, because the
papers are confidential, “he
overall impression is intvi-
tably one of subterfuge—the
feeling that the FBI has
been caught doing some-
thing it isn’t supposed to be
doing. Actually, the docu-
ments do not speak to that
questidn. The FBI contends
always that its investigative
activitiel, past and’ present ,
are in accordance with in-
structions from the Justice
Department and the Attor-
ney General. Nothing in the
Media file refutes that
claim.

But, while the Media bur-
glars have been selective in
what they showed the pub-
lic, so have the federal offi-
cials, Both the FBI and the
. Justice Department, have so
far refused to make public,
even to congressional in-
quiries, any of the official
criteria, guidelines and di-
rectives which they contend
govern the methods and
scope of FBI surveillance.
At one point during a Sen-'
ate hebring, a Sifi-
cial deilied that such guide-
lines ekist, then moments
later deseribed them as ex-
tensive.

‘Lo explain surveillance in
black neighberiroode.and to
justify it, the assistant attor-
ney general for internal se-
curity, Robert Mardian, has
revealed two paragraphs
from a 1967 memorandum
by then Attorney General
Ramsey Clark, a Democrat
who more recently has been
a critic of government intru-
sions on civil liberties, The
excerpt, by ilself, sounds
like a sweeping} directive to
spy on Americzn Negroes:

“It is imperative that the
department seek to obtain
the most comprehensive in-
telligence possible regard-
ing organized or other pur-
poseful stimulation of do-
mestic dissention, civil dis-
orders and riots. To carry
out these responsibilities,
we must make full use of
and constantly endeavor to
increase and refine the in-
telligence ‘available to us,
both from internal and ex-
ternal sources, concerning
organizatios and indivieu-
als throughput the country

. who may piay a role in ei-

ther instigating or spreading

disorders or in preventing

or checking them.”



But the—Iustice Depart:
ment has declined to release
the entite text of Clark's
memorandum or the other
accompanying directives as
well as any of the guidelines
which the incumbent Attor-
ney General has issued on

, the subject,

Clark acknowledges that
he gave such an order, but
his memory is vague about
what restrictions, if
any, were placed on the
Scope of the surveillance.
‘The purpose, he said, was to

‘develop more reliable intel-
ligence about urban riot sit-
uations so that the federal
government could make a
measured response—a move
which was also recom
mended by the liberal-ap.
plauded Kerner report.

Clark also wanted to settle °

the politically volatile ques-
tion of whether a national
conspiracy lay behind the
urban disofders. “Of course,
we never! found one,” he
said.

“We feltt first, a high obli-
gation to be on top of that
situation,” Clark recalled,

“and, second, that the bu- -
reau was not doing an ade- *

quate job. On methods, we
may have heen a little loose.
J just don’t know.”

* Clark feels that if all of
the memoranda were availa-
ble they would show that he
did not issue an open-ended
order without limitations. In
the absence of those official
guidelines, however, the Me-
aia documents, despite their
Gaps, are still the most com-
plete statement on what the
FBI is doing. Tested against
the experiences of former
FBI agents from other field
offices, some generalizations
are possible,

Bookstores, churches, sa-
loons, storefront community
organizations, campuses and
student ‘ organizations—all
apparently are fair game if
they bear the prefix “Afro”
or if they become classified
through some unrevealed
Process as “black militant”
or “militant extremist.” It is
almost as if the government
decided to "ipy on all law-
yers who enbeze in politics

The memoranda prescrib-
ing the surveillance
sound like instructions for
agents being sent to a for-
eign country and, indeed,
only a handful of the FBI’s

agents were black when the -”

escalation in surveillance oc-
curred in 1968 (fewer than 2
per cent of the more than
8,000 agents are black

. today).

One directive from Phila-
delphia‘s—egecial agent in
charge (the SAC in bureau
parlance) even told the 180
agents where to go in search
of “obtaining maximum
productivity from the ghetto
informants developed ~ by
each individual office.”

The SAC gave the ad-
dresses of 10 bars and cafes,
three bookstores, a church
and the headquarters of five
community —_ organizations.
‘Among nine specific assign-
ments for informants were
these: .
© “Attend and report on
open meetings of known or
suspected black extremist
organizations . . .

© “Visit Afro-American
type bookstores for the pur-
pose of determining if mili- -
tant extremist literature is
available therein and, if so,
to identify the owners, oper-
ators and clientele of such
stores... iy

e “identity | black extre-
mist militants ;who attempt
to influence the Negro com-
munity and report on the ef-
fect of such efforts...

© “Report on changes in
the attitude of the Negro
community toward the white
community which may Jead
to racial violence.

© “Report on all indica-
tions of efforts, by foreign
powers to take over the

Negro militant movement.

In those cases where you

have an exceptionally intel-

ligent and knowledgeable in-
formant, such an informant
may be given the assign-
ment of reporting on the

general mood of the Negro ,

community concerning sus-
- ceptibility to foreign influ-

ence whether this be from

African nations in the form

of Pan-Africanism, from the

Soviet or «Ciifese commu-

nist bloc nations, or from

other nations.”

The direct|ve closed with
a reminder to! plan ahead:

“The Buredu has also in-
structed that we immedi-
ately ascertain among all
Negro informants, including
ghetto informants, which in-
formants are planning to
enter college this fall and
would be in a position to in-
filtrate black power groups
on campuses. Bureau de.
sires that we furnish them
with the identities of these
informants and the colleges
they plan to attend.”

What the FBI wanted to
find out~and presumably
stil seekswas not so
much the solution to a
crime or the identity of
criminals, but the answer to
a highly complicated social-
political question that has
baffled the most sophisti-
cated urban investigators:
when and wkere would the
next riot occu}?

An earlier memo, dated in
Jate February, |1968, outlined
the prob'em “for Philadel-
phia agents: .

“Tt is a major part of our



responsibility to learn in @
ins

Vance, if that is humai
possible; IF aH0t is planned
or is expected to occur. In
this way, it may be possible
to actually forestall a riot or
at least to be better pre-
pared if it does happen.”

‘This new responsibility
meant, in effect, reporting
on every demonstration
planned,- regardless of
whether it produced disor-
der or a violation of any fed-
eral laws. The SAC warned,

a bit grimly, it seems:

“Whether or not a rict
does accur, the Bureau
holds us responsible to keep
the Bureau, the Departmnet
and the White House ad-
vised in advance of each
demonstration, The Bureau
expects this coverage to
come through informant
sources primarily, In addi-
tion, we must advise the Bu-
reau at least every two
weeks of existing tensious
and conditions which may
trigger a riot.”

To accoshotish that, anew
category (jf informant was
creared, ejnploying the new-

fy fashionable shorthand for
any black neighborhood:

“Racial Informant—Ghetto.”

They would be anyone, white

or black, who happened to

have contact in the “ghetto,”
from taxi drivers and liquor
store clerks to janitors and
bill collectors. ‘These
“Ghetto Informants” would

be distinct from the FBI's

regular “Racial Informants”

who were infiltrating “blac's

nationalist and black revolu-

tionary groups.” Each agent -
was directed to bring back:

at least one “ghetto inform-

ant”.

The Bureau suggested
that some established crimi-
nal and internal-security in-
formants could be converted
to the new assignment. Phil-
adeiphia was subdivided by
streets and areas to insure
complete coverage. :

If one assumes that this
same command went out to
all field agents, that means
that the FBI was catalogu-
ing for starters something
like 8,000 informants, just to
cover the “ghettoes” of
America, But these numbers

cannot be trusted; the total
might have involved many
more racial informants or it
just may have'been an exer-
cise in expanded paperwork,

Interviews with rormer
agents.who served in Wash-
ington, Detrott—New York,
Miami’ and Kansas City con-
firm that similar directives
were received in other
major cities, but the num-
pers and impact varied con-

siderably.
: One ‘veteran of the Wash-
ington, D.C., field office (not
onfused with fhe ‘bu-
real adquarters here,
reat referred to as
SOG for Seat of Govern-
ment) recalled that they
were given a much more
ambitious goal for the Capi-
tal's black majority. ‘They
were first told to recruit at
Jeast six “ghetto inform-
ants” apiece. That was later
modified to three each, then
one each, he said.

“In fact,” he related, “only
guys on the Racial Squad
did anything about it.”

‘Another ex-agent in a dif-
ferent field office remem-
pered an order to gather
thre or four “ghetto” con-
tact\ for preriot surveil-
Jancé but, again, he did not
think that goal was ever
genuinely fulfilled. “It, just
made for a tremendous
amount of paperwork,” he
said. “Ninety per cent of the
informants were worthless.”

By the accounts of former.
agents, many “informants”
were little more than names
and addresses in the files.
They had been submitted
after routine investigations
and only limited contacts.
Months later, the agent
might submit a follow-up
memorandum, withdrawing
the “potential racial inform:
ant” as unreliable or no
longer available, then sub-
mit new names. That, the
ex-agents said, produced a

statistical picture of heavy.

activity in developing new
informants, but not’ much
genuine intelligence.

The irony, according to
the yiewpoint of several ex-
age, is that the Media
documents may portray the
FBI durveillance “
more ‘penetrating than it
really is. 7

Nevertheless, as the
Media documents testify,
the. FBI has succeeded in in-
filtrating some Black organi-
zations (though the papers
do not reveal whether the
“ghetto” recruiting goal was
ever met). A collection of the
memorand spanning the re-
cent years mentions 14
coded racial informants in
the Philadelphia area and
indicates that they are es-
tablished sources who have
passed the test of.reliability
and who presumably are

very, pubii¢~ confrontations

over such issues as church
“reparations” to black peo-
ple. Kenyatta’s activities
have been well covered by
the local press and the Phil-
adelphia police.

At least two racial inform-
ants — PH897-R and PH
307-R -— were providing the
FBI with reports on the pri-
vate coming-and-going of
Kenyatta as recently as Feb-
ruary. None of the informa-
tion contained in the reports ,
distributed by the Media
burglars suggests that Ken-
yatta is moving away from
public confrontations into
clandestine subversion or
sabotage. :

On the contrary, one in-
formant describes Kenyat-
ta’s plans for “a ‘new
stronger organization which
will bring in other black
groups in the city of Phila-
delphia.” The #BI learned,
among other \things, the
names of the| prospective
chairmen for 1(|subcommit-
tees, ranging from Church
Relationships to Ways and
Means. The planning makes
Kenyatta sound more like a
PTA chairman than a revo-
lutionary, except for two of
his subcommittees — Tacti-
cal, described by the inform-
ant as reparations and con-
frontatien, and Defense, de-
scribed as self-defense or
legal defense.

To learn more about this
man_and his organization,
the FBI turned to his bank
and the telephone company,
both of which were coopera-
tive. The Southeast National
Bank provided copies of can-
celled checks and monthly
statements that showed bal-
ances in 1970 fluctuating
from a higll of $1,948 to a
low of $38.

The Bell ‘telephone Co. of
Pennsylvanit supplied the
investigator with the Ken-
yattas’ unlisted phone num-
‘ber (but cautioned that this
should not be made public
without first going through
the motions of issuing a sub-
poena for it).

The Media papers, frag-
mentary as they are, do not
really establish hovt wide-
spread that sort of furveil-
lanch is. Again, the ex-
agers with experlehce in
other cities suggest that is
was the common practice,
not the exception.

2989648 Page 377

Two former agents who
servec—together on the
Washington field office's Ra-
cial Squad agreed that sur-
veillance ‘of black groups
was conducted broadly,
though they came away
from their bureau jobs with
vastly different attitudes
about it. One of them was so
disgusted that it led to his
resignation, The other found
the, work fascinating and ed-
ucational,

“It was very racist,” said
one of them. “The bureau
was interested in anything
or anyone that said black. If
I were to start an organiza.
tion called ‘Friends of
Blacks,’ chances are 1 would
be investigated. You
couldn’t convince them that
they had no right to investi-
gate all over’ the lot willy-
nilly.”

The secgnd agent, his for-
mer colleasjue, did not argue
with this description of the
scope, but insisted ‘that the

illance was not “racist”
of other squadY were at
work covering white groups
with equal vigor, particu-
Tarly New Left dissidents.

“It was something new
and interesting to me,” he
recalled. “1 saw things dif-
ferently, things I'd never
seen before about the col-
ored. I used to enjoy going
around with Stokely Carmi-
chael. He was a damn good
speaker, If he could find his
cause, he could be a great
leader.”

Several former agents
added another distinction.
Prior to the urban riots, bu-
reau agents followed various
civil rights groups, always
on the pretext of potential
foreign attachments. Offi-
cially, they were investigat-
ing to see if the civil rights
movement was being infil-
trated by Communists under
foreign domination. After
1967, the ex-agents said, that
distinction was dropped and
any group which might be
characterized as “black mi
tant” or “extremist” became
a subject of concern in its
own right.

None of this probably
would shock many of the
“black militant” citizens
who are being watched, For
years, various civil rights
leaders have complained
about the FBI, even before
the increased surveillance
stimulated by the riots.

. Some of them insisted
that the real purpose was to
destroy their organizations
by stimulating paranoia—
fear of infiltration which
makes fellow members sus-
picious of one another,
splinters a group into fac- .

+ tions and inhibits the re.

eruiting of new members,
That was a factor, ‘certainly,
in the FBI's successful pene-
tration of the Communist
Party and the Ku Klux Klan
—although few people ob-
jected when the tactic was
used against those organiza-
tions. : ©

Curiously, orfe Media doc. *
ument mentiofas “paranoia”
aS government weapon
against its citizens, A Phila-
delphia agent, reporting on
an SOG conference on the
New Left held last Septem-
ber, notes:



“There was a p.etty gen-
eral consens) ‘amore in-
terviews with these subjects
and hangers-on are in order
for plenty of reasons, chief
of which are it will enhance
the paranoia endemic in
these circles and will fur-
ther serve to get the point

across there is an FBI agent _

behind every mailbox.”

On the record, the present
administration has said that
its racial intelligence-gather-
ing related to civ disturb-
ances is a continwition, with
a few refinement}, of what
was started under Ramsey
Clark and the Democrats.
Privately, Justice Depart.
ment officials have hinted

‘on several occasions that At- ,

torney General John N.
Mitchell has actually been
more restrictive, though
they have offered no evi-
dence of that.

-The fragmentary disclo-
sures from the Media files
suggests the gontrary. Stir-
red by the canjpus disorders

gress for 1,400 additional
agents to cover college bomb-

mes and burnings, the
reau ordered all of its 59
field offices—to—investigate
and, if possible, to infiltrate
every black student organi-
zation in the country, not
just at the campuses where
disorders had occurred, but
at every four-year college
and junior college.

‘The memorandum is
dated Nov. 4, 1970, a period
when campuses were quiet,
put the tone is urgent. It
jinked campus trouble in-
volving black students with
“§nfluence and control by vi-
olence-prone Black Panther
Party and other exiremists.”
‘The order indicated that the
bureau was incréasing and
re-emphasizing an area of
surveillance which already
had been opened.

“We must target inform-
ants and sources to de-
velop information regarding
these groups on a continu-
ing basis to fulfill our re-
sponsibilities and to develop
such coverage where none
exists,” the director said.

“Bifective immediately,
all BSU’s and similar organ-
jzations organized to project
the demands of black stu-
dents which are not pres:
ently under investigation,
are to be subjects of dis-
creet, preliminary inquiries
limited to established
sources antl carefully con-
ducted to avoid criticism, to
determine the size, aims,
purposes, attivities, leader.
ship, key activists, and
extremist interest or influ-
ence in these groups. Open
individual cases on officers
and key activists in each
group to determine back-
ground and if their activi-
ties warrant active investi-
gation.”

Tn the Philadelphia area,
that meant black-student or-
ganizations on 13 campuses,
each case: “opened and. as-
signed” under the heading
of “Racial Matter,” with ad-
ditional individual files on
the officers and “key activ-
ists.” Across the nation,
there are now about 500,000
plack collegians and proba-
ply a couple of thousand
campus groups called Black
Student Union or Afro-A-
meriean Society. Most of
them, of course, were “or-
ganized to project the de-
mands of black students,” as
the FBI put it, but only a
small minority have been as-
sociated with violent disor-
ders.

In addition to the cam-
-by-campus investigation,
FBI aimed its resources

‘at the National Association
of Black students, a fledg-
ling Washington-based
group that is trying to form
a loose national affiliation
of black college groups.

Last summer, all agents
were alerted to have “logi-
cal’ informants” attend the
first NABS convention in
Detroit. NABS is an “RM”
too. The directive suggests
that the FBI was already
successful in infiltrating at
least some Black Student
Unions,

_, One of the most troubling
items on racial surveillance
is the last one, a memoran-"
dum froni late February of

this year describing what

the FBI found out from
three informant sources

about the Black Student

Union at Pennsylvania Mili-

tary College, a qitiet campus

in Chester. What they found

was a “basicallit dormant”

organization, yet instead of

closing the file and forget-

ting the matter, the agency

decided to open new files on

two leaders of the organiza-

tion—just in case,

“These sources,” the mem-
orandum reported, “de-
scribed the BSU as a some-
what disorganized group of
‘students, possibly having ,a
membership and/or follow- -
ing of no moje than 30 stu-
dents and eae as few as

a half dozen, {who -have not
displayed radjpal or militant
ideas, and do ‘not appear to
be aligned with any radical

“or black militant groups.”

“That sounds like a clean
bill, even under the broad
standards which the FBI ap-
plies in deciding who should
be watched. The memoran-
dum even described “Black
Festival Week,” held on the
campus last October, as a
flop. Neverthéless, accord-
ing to the. document,’ the
FBI is still watching the
leaders of this organization.
The memo acknowledged .
the lack of damaging infor- .
mation, then directed:
“Philadelphia will, how-
ever, open cafes on the indi-
vidual leaderp listed as the
leaders of the BSU and in-
formants willl be developed



on these individuals so that
this office i xe of their
identity and background.”

The incident frames a cru-
cial question about the FBI
surveillance, not just of
black spying but, of political
black organizations, but of
political dissidents gener-
ally: when does the spying
stop?

If one accented the idea
that the FBI has a right at
Teast to look into any and all
organizations which had
“probable cause” to be what
it regards as potentially sub-
versive or ‘the source of
crime or disorder, then pre-
sumably the agency would
follow some procedure for
taking a “first look” to test
its-suspicions. * =

Tf the “probable cause”
proved to be unfounded,
then the case would be
ciosed, the surveillance

stopped, ideally, the dossier |

destroyed. The case of Penn-
sylvania Military College
suggests that, on the con-
trary, the dgents keep the
files active,jeven when they
know the abject js harm-
less,

The Media documents pro-
vide ho conclusive answer to
this question, but they do
cofitain a series of similar
exumples of the FBI men
passing the threshhold of an
initial investigation without
accepting the negative re-
sults as grounds for closing
the file.

In one bizarre case, the
Philadelphia agents spent
some energy tracking down
Norman John Shore after an
Army intelligence unit in
Europe
letters between Shore and
pecple in East Germany.
They dealt with Shore’s
visit to a “Free German
Youth” camp. When the
agents learned that the sub-
ject was only |}4 years old,
they decided ilo close the
case—but switched their in-
vestigation to his father.

Ih another. document, a
confidential informant, PH
948.8, recounted his evening
av the “Bernheim Com-
mune,” chatting with sev-
eral men about New Left
politics while a Women’s
Liberation meeting was
under way in an adjoining
room. The men and sorile of
the women were already the
subjects off individual sur-
veillance files as “intprnal
security” ‘cases; so ° was
Women’s Liberation.

intercepted seven -

The informant conclud-
ed: “It would appear that
they consider_themselves
‘intellectual revolutionaries.’
but are not organizational
types and not personally ac-
tivists.” Despite that assess-
ment, the agent's memoran-
dum closes with instructions
to open and assign a new se-
curity case on the Bernheim
Commune.

In a similar vein, a 1969
memo indicates that the
government is interested in
infiltrating a meeting of the
War Resisters International
at Haverford College for po-
litical propaganda purposes
in connectionwith the Paris
Peace talks, not to detect
potential crime.

The organization is a radi- :

eal pacifist league which has
been producing antiwar
propaganda for several gen-
erations, Its meeting at Hav-

erford was open to press
and “public, but the FBI

memo alerted 22 “security *

informants.”

“Determine its scope and
whether or not there are
any indications it will gener-
ate any anti-U.S.. propa
ganda,” the orders said. “Be
most discreet in handling
this matter.”

Former FBI agents, asked
about their own experiences,
express conflicting views on
this question. Several think
the FBI is reasonably care-
ful about checking out a “se-
curity” or “racial” ‘subject,
then droppiiig the case if it
proves unprpductive. “A lot
are eliminajed by the first
look,” said ipne ex-agent. “I
think they're doing a pretty
good job.”

But others disagree rather
strongly. The system which
they describe never forgets
a name, Once someone
comes under surveillance,
they contend, it is*hard to
drop him. One. agent de-
scribed an example:

“In practice, Joe Doaks
gives a speech. He says it’s

| about time forja revolution
in this country. Fo we take a
look at him anti determine
that, hes’ a straight guy, just

“got carried away, no bomb ,

{ thrower,

“But then you can’t close
the investigation, becalise
yowve got to get back-
grdund, to make sure he's
okay. Meanwhile, maybe he
makes another speech some-
where and the bureau or an-
other field office asks, ‘Who
is this guy?’ Once a guy
makes a public name for
himself, it’s almost impossi-
ple to close it.” ae

Some of the bureatcratic
pressure that the ex-agents
cite is evident in the Media
papers. One memorandum
mentions the “credit” sys-
tem under which individual
agents and field offices
score points with their supe-
riors when a case is solved
or stolen property re-

ered. -
Agents were urged tdi use
racial informants for solying
crim ‘but promised thet an
agen} would be given ‘full
credit” for his piece of the
action, even if another



Squad made the final ‘*~ust.
In addition, when th ents
pad beh to ol at
least one “ghetto informant”
apiece, the field office ac-
knowledged that this might
be impossible for some, but
they -should protect them-
selves against possible criti-
cism:

“Tf an individual RA (rési-
dent agent) covers only a
county which does not en-
compass any municipality
containing a ghetto, so spec-
ify by memorandum form
170-6 with a copy for the
RA’s error folder, so that he
will not. be charged with
failure to perform.”

With that sort,of encour-
agement, ald seem nat-
ural for a special agent to
spread the fruits of his in-
vestigating as broadly as
possible. Indeed, again and
again, the Media memos
demonstrate the great pro-
liferation of paper recording
and disseminating even in-
Significant discoveries,

The Philadelphia “Secu-
rity” investigation of Jac-
queline Reuss, daughter
of the Wisconsin congress-
men, though it discovered
nothing derogatory about
her, was forwarded for files
in Washington, Milwaukee
and Alexandria, Va.

Seven copips of a report
on a Univerpity of Califor-
nia student vere distributed
to files across the country
repeating the allegation that
she is “an inveterate Marx-
ist revolutionist,” although
the field investigation failed
to substantiate that. 7

A student at the Univer-
sity of Maryland’s Eastern
Shore campus was investi-

. Bated as a “black national-
ist” and described as a “con-
stant source of agitation” on
the campus in recent years.
Thirteen coples of the re-
port went to dossiers on him
in six cities. |

The FBI files do have a
long memory. That is also
demonstrated clearly by the
Media documents on old left
eases which show the
agency keeping an eye on
people and organizations lit-
erally for decades on the
presumption that they are
potentially dangerous,

There is no “first look”
test applied apparently,
onde a person or group falls
intb this category, even if
over a number of years no
evidence develops to suggest
they are about to commit a
crime.

NW 68262 Docid:32989648 Page 380

One memorandum, ‘for
instance, notes that the FBI
maintalns—ar® interest in
watching such long-estab-.
lished’ and public antiwar
groups as the Women’s In-
ternational _ League for
Peace and Freedom, SANE
and the American Friends
Service Committee—but
agents were instructed not
to mix them with New Left
groups who were more dan-
gerous —the “violent and
terroristic-minded young an-
archists.”

In one instance, the FBI
reached back in its collec-
tive memory 30 years,
Agents in Washington were
trying to establish a Latin
American employee at an in-
ternatiotrat organization.
here as a double agent to
spy on Cuba. In their search
of his background, they dis-
covered that his brother was
a Communist candidate for
a minor post in a Maritime
Union election, held on the
docks of New Orleans in.

In still another example
from the Media papers, the
Philadelphia agents were
scanning the background of
a Quaker pacifist, a radio
engineer, who had invited a
Czech folklore scholar to
visit and lecture in the
United States in 1966. In the-
files, they found a variety of
“items:

. That th engineer has ine
dicated to his employer that

he is not a member of any
subversive organizations but
“during the Spanish Civil
War (1936), he attended
many public meetings which
he believed were sponsored
by groups which are cited
and consequently his name
has apparently been listed
on the mailing lists of sev-
eral of these organizations.”

© A 1956 report, which ap-
parently inspired the 1957
investigation, that the man’s
wife had corresponded with

EXTREMIST MATTERS

In order to increase the productivity of the Ghetto
Informant Program, there is attached for approval an airtel to
all continental field offices instructing that each Special Agent
in Charge (SAC) thoroughly evaluate the Ghetto Informant Program
in his respective division and submit recommendations for
improving the program in line with the guidelines set forth by
the Bureau,

The Ghetto Informant Program was instituted 10-11-67.
A ghetto informant is an individual who resides or works in an
area described as a ghetto and can furnish general information
concerning extremist activity, When originally instituted, the
gliétto informant was mainly a listening post; however, with the
change in extremist activities, a good number of these informants
were ‘given positive assignments, which assignments definitely
increased the productivity in certain field divisions.

informants, This is a valuable reservoir of individuals who
~should be elevated into positions in extremist organizations.
In addition, by increasing the productivity of the ghetto j /
informants, the Bureau will be in a position of obtaining j
additional criminal statistics.

| It is to be noted that in addition to obtaining
information concerning extremist activities, the ghetto informants
along with other extremist informants since January 1, 1971, have
been responsible for bringing about the arrest of 445 individuals on

RE: GHETTO INFORMANT PROGRAM

well as being responsible for the recovery of $193,181.28 in
stolen merchandise. With the increase in extremist activity as
seen by the disturbances in penal institutions, the unprovoked
attacks against police and the definite trend concerning
guerrilla warfare throughout the U.S., we must accelerate our
penetration of extremist groups.

Accordingly, in order to fully utilize our vast
reservoir of ghetto informants, it is believed each SAC should
be instructed to evaluate the Ghetto Informant Program in his
division along the following lines.

1. Ascertain the number of ghetto informants that
have been elevated into extremist organizations. 2. Determine
what percentage of the ghetto informants are given positive
assignments on a regular basis, 3. Evaluate the extremist
intelligence accomplishments of the ghetto informants in the
particular field division. 4. Evaluate the criminal
Statistical accomplishments, 5, Set forth specific steps
being taken to not only increase the productivity of the
Ghetto Informant Program but also the steps being taken to
elevate the ghetto informants into extremist organizations.

Upon receipt of the above from each continental field
office, analysis will be made and appropriate instructions will
be furnished all field divisions concerning the future handling
of ghetto informants.

The evaluation of the ghetto informant program made by
each continental field division clearly shows that there is a
definite relationship between the accomplishments of this program
and the percentage of ghetto informants being given positive
assignments.

In addition, the ghetto informant program has proven to be ;
a a ‘most productive program not only in the extremist intelligence \/ ?
field but it has also show that ghetto informants can be helpful in
obtaining criminal statistical accomplishments, Since 2/1/71 ghetto
informants have’ been responsible for bringing about the arrest Of
111 individuals, 51 of whom were Bureau fugitives, as well as
bringing about the recovery of $49,999. 7

community (ghetto areas); therefore, our ghetto informants
must ‘be targeted to obtain information concerning this
guerrilla warfare activity.

In order to fulfill our responsibilities in this
field, each field division must promptly improve both the
number and quality of ghetto informants in accordance with the
guidelines set forth below: (1) New ghetto informants
developed must be the type who can obtain information concerning
black extremists who are operating in the ghetto areas and
planning or perpetrating guerrilla-type activities such as
robberies, attacks on police, and other violent activities;
(2) The recent survey of ghetto informants showed that the
productivity of the program in each field office was in direct
relation to the percentage of ghetto informants being given
positive assignments. Those field divisions achieving greater
productivity are the ones who had a greater percentage of their
ghetto informants being given positive assignments, Accordingly,
on your FD-405b setting forth your extremist informant accomplish-
ments you must set forth the percentage of your ghetto informants
being given positive assignments.

Each ghetto informant must be evaluated on a yearly
basis; and if it is determined that the informant has not
produced positive extremist intelligence-type information, which
information would include criminal-type information, the informant
must be closed and a new ghetto informant developed.

It is expected that the quality and quantity of ghetto
informants will be improved in the near future in order that the
Bureau may fulfill its responsibilities in the extremist
intelligence field.

Purpose of this memorandum is to obtain approval for‘ My
attached airtel to all continental field offices instructing that
the extremist ghetto informant program be upgraded in accordance
with the guidelines set out in order to increase the productivity
of this program and to obtain information concerning the present
phase of extremist activity, namely, the guerrilla warfare phase. ‘

ee

By airtel dated 9/22/71 all continental field offices
were instructed to evaluate the ghetto informant program, These 2)
evaluations have been received and reviewed. The review clearly
shows that those field offices giving the majority of their ghetto
informants positive assignments are achieving not only positive
intelligence information but also valuable criminal statistical
accomplishments, These informants, since 2/1/71, have been At
responsible for bringing about the arrest of 111 individuals, 51
of which were Bureau fugitives, and the recovery of $49,999 in
stolen merchandise, weapons, and cars. ~

| In addition, we are now seeing another phase of extremist
activity, that is the guerrilla warfare phase, as opposed to the
mass demonstrations which occurred in the past, Extremists are
involved in expropriations (robberies), killing of police,
and other terroristic activities, The extremists involved in
guerrilla warfare have very limited or no contact with the
|aboveground extremist organizations; therefore, our coverage has
been limited in this respect. The guerrilla operates within the
community (the ghetto area), and this is the area where we also
operate our ghetto informants; therefore, our ghetto informants
‘should be targeted toward developing information concerning acts

This is to justify continuance of captioned program
in view of the fact that this program is producing substantial
accomplishments in the extremist field on a regular basis,

During the past year these informants have furnished
intelligence information concerning extremist activities which
has-brought about the arrest of Black Panther Party (BPP) members
on armed robbery charges, identified individuals responsible for
a fire bombing of a food store, identified individuals who have
been involved in murder cases, as well as information which
brought about the recovery of weapons and ammunition, and
information which has been of assistance to local police in
handling civil disturbances,

. While the primary objective of the ghetto informant f
program is to obtain information concerning extremist activities, /
it also provides substantial accomplishments in the criminal f-
field in that these informants either live or work in ghetto
areas which are usually high crime areas. During the period
7/1/71 to 4/30/72 ghetto informants were responsible for bringing
about the arrest of 305 individuals (174 local and state, 131
Federal), of whom 85 were FBI fugitives, In addition, these
informants were responsible for the recovery of $174,994 which
included 37 stolen automobiles, ‘Weapons, ammunition, narcotics,

occur in the form of disturbances and riots. As the program
progressed it was noted that these informants could be operated
in such a manner to increase their value by giving them positive
assignments to develop information concerning black extremists
who are operating in ghetto areas and planning or perpetrating
guerrilla-type activities such as robberies, attacks on police,
and other violent activities. In addition, the field has
constantly been reminded of the potential of ghetto informants
to obtain criminal information in addition to the extremist
intelligence, and this has paid off as indicated above.

Information has recently been developed indicating
black extremists are obtaining funds by robbing narcotics
dealers. Accordingly, the field has been instructed to target
ghetto informants specifically toward ascertaining the identities
of narcotics dealers in their particular areas as well as
obtaining information concerning plans of black extremists to
rob these individuals. .

The ghetto informant program is a sound program and
is analyzed on a regular basis through field inspections,
inspections at FBI Headquarters, and through supervision by
the Domestic Intelligence Division. In view of the need for
extremist intelligence information provided by this program
and its productivity, it is believed this program should be
continued, and it will be reevaluated in July, 1973.

ACTION:

If approved, this program will be continued and
rejustified in July, 1973.

This is to obtain authority to implement a modified
ghetto informant program which will reduce the number of ghetto
informants by fifty per cent without impairing the efficiency
of the operation.

After careful analysis of the ghetto informant pro-
gram during the recent inspection of the Domestic Intelligence
Division, it was concluded that a modified ghetto informant pro-
gram would streamline and improve efficiency of the existing
program. This will be achieved by having only Special Agents
assigned to extremist matters handling ghetto informants.
Experience has shown that Special Agents experienced in extremist
matters are in a better position to achieve maximum use of ghetto
informants.

Growing civil unrest in the mid-1960s createdj an urgent
need for a comprehensive network of "listening post" type sources
within ghetto areas to provide advance intelligence inf rmation
relating to civil unrest. To fill this need the ghe{td’ informant
program was initiated on October 11, 1967. The ghetto“imformant 7
program proved highly successful and subsequently these informants
were directed to areas of greater responsibility in addition to
their "listening post" function. A notable bywrroduct_of these

informants has been their ability to furnish hig! Significant

explosive element smoi{ldering within the ghetto areas throughout

~ the Nation. This volatile force, more sophisticated than in the
“past, frequently surfaces in the form of urban guerrilla terrorist-
type activities often by unaffiliated extremists, resulting in the
sniping and killing of police, firebombings, and other violent
criminal activities. The current threat of civil unrest in the
ghetto is perhaps an even greater menace to our society than the
unrest we have witnessed in the past. To cope with this continuing
undercurrent, a more selective ghetto informant program is necessary.

The primary purpose of our modified ghetto informant pro-

gram is to provide a highly selective corps of "listening post"!

7 informants versed in the type of information desired by the Bureau

% | which will assure we are abreast of growing civil unrest and

developing extremist activities. This can best be accomplished
by having ghetto informants exclusively handled by those Special
Agents assigned to extremist matters. Inasmuch as ghetto informants
generally work or reside in high crime areas and frequently associ-
ated with the criminal element, we will continue to encourage the
acceptance of criminal information coming to the attention of these
informants.

While we expect a fifty percent decrease in the 7,514
ghetto informants currently being operated, the modified ghetto
informant program in no way diminishes the responsibility of the
Special Agent in Charge (SAC) to have "listening post't type sources
in those ghetto areas where there is a potential for civil unrest
or extremist activity. In addition, the SAC will be instructed to
carefully analyze each current ghetto informant and those with the
best potential to be retained as ghetto informants or elevated to 1
probationary extremist informant and others, if appropriate, redesig-:
nated as criminal informants or discontinued.

Some ‘SACs have levied an arbitrary rule requiring Special
Agents, regardless of assignment, to develop ghetto informants. We
will give instructions to insure this practice is discontinued.

RE: .GHETLO INFORMANT PROGRAM
EXTREMIST MATTERS

To achieve greater efficiency and maximum utilization

of our ghetto informants and to reemphasize the "listening post"

concept of these informants, e modified program designed to

reduce the number of existing ghetto informants has been instituted.
«, ° Bf£ective immediately all ghetto informants are to be exclusively

handled by those Special égents assigned to extremist matters,

Experience has shown that Agents knowledgeable in extremist matters

are better qualified to vealize the full potential of ghetto

informants,

ia With the implementation of the modified program, you
will be expected to redesignate or close at least 50 percent
of your ghetto informants, Accordingly, carefully analyze each
of your ghetto informants and the most qualified should be retained
as ghetto informants or elevated, if appropriate, to probationary
extremist informants, In the event you have ghetto informants
predominately furnishing criminal information they should be
designated criminal informants, All others are to be discontinued.

While it remains the primary purpose of the ghetto
informant program to provide “listening post" type sources in
ghetto areas where there is a potentiel for civil unrest or
extremist activities, you are still expected to fully utilize
these informants by giving them specific assignments where appro-

An informant who is classified as a ghetto informant, as dis~
tinguished from a criminal, security, potential security or extremist
informant, appears to be one who is expected to provide advance
intelligence information relating to civil unrest. In evaluating the
program, it is therefore important to know of each instance since the

tion prior to an urban riot or upheaval was obtained from a ghetto
informant.

Memorandum for Mr. Gray
Re: Ghetto Informant Program
Extremist Matters

Although I have not seen the answers to the question referred
to above as to the instances in which ghetto informants have furnished the
type information which was expected of them when the program was
established, my initial opinion is that the ghetto informant program has
not produced any information which could not be obtained by (1) regular
debriefing of criminal, security, potential security, and extremist
informants; (2) liaison with local police departments who, as a part of
the increasing emphasis upon better police-community relations, are
much closer to the pulse of the local ghetto community than may have
been the case heretofore, and who have probably always been closer to
the ghetto than the FBI could ever hope to be; and (3) volunteered
information from interested citizens.

The last paragraph of the Moore to Miller memorandum of
9/8/72 impliedly suggests what I believe to be the major justification
for continuing a separate program under the heading of ghetto informants.
SACs do not levy an arbitrary rule requiring SA's to develop ghetto
informants unless the SACs, rightly or wrongly, believe the Headquarters
expects a certain caseload of ghetto informants from their respective
offiees.

The suspicion that it is the caseload concept which underlies
much of the current discussion about the ghetto informant program in
the aftermath of the recent inspection of DID is increased by the proposed
cutback of fifty percent, which, as previously indicated, appears to be
a somewhat arbitrary figure.

You should know in advance what the consequences would be as
far as the budget is concerned if the ghetto informant program, which
has undoubtedly accounted for a significant number of cases, were dis-
continued, Ifthose consequences include a drastic cut in funds, you of
course can not be oblivious to them, but, at the risk of sounding naive,
I would hope that the future of this program can be decided solely on the
basis of the program's merit or lack thereof without regard to the case-
load factor. Z

Re Dave Kinley's note about our discussing this matter,
I believe I heard at the SAC Conference on 9/26 that DID was going
to poll the Field to get the views of SAC's and I got the impression
that DID, upon receipt of these comments from the Field, might
wish to revise the proposed SAC Memorandum which was the
subject of the 9/8/72 memorandum from Mr. Moore to you.

If there is to be a revised proposal from DID in light of
comments from the Field and the comments of Mr. Gray, it may

Re: Venceremos Brigade
105--195696 :

For purpose of compiling statistics regarding the
VB at the Bureau, your closing letter on each VB subject
should also include data as follows:

i. SI status prior to YB travel, as well as
current §f status.

2. Prior subversive background (Communist Party,
Students for 4 Dexccrvatic Society, Young Socialist Alliance,
Weatherman, et cetera).

3. Cooperative or uncooperative VB interview. If
none, explain briefly why none condueted,

4, Brief summary of any extremist or violent
activity since subject's return from Cuba.

All feasible efforts must be expended in order to
locate and interview those YB subjects whose whereabouts have
not been ascertained, Approximately 20 members of the first
contingent and about $5 members of the second contingent have
not been located and interviewed according to Bureau records.
You should immediately review your cases and place stops with
the Identification Division on 211 VB subjects who have not
been Located and interviewed. This should be accomplished
through the use of FD-165 narked "Wanted for Questioning
Only." :

The facilities of the National Crime information
Center (NCIC) are presently being programed to accept stops
on Bureau subjects wanted for questioning. Ths programing
Will be operational in approximately 30 days, but the stops
may be placed by Seat of Government {S0G) only. Accordingly,
when submitting your FD-165 to the Identification Division, a
duplicate copy of the FD-165 should be designated for Room 910,
New Left Section, Domestic Intelligence Division. Data from
this FD-165 will be furnished to NCIC by SOG when the program
is operative, In addition to the usual numbers listed on the
FD-165, NCIC requests you should also set forth Social Security
numbers, automotive operator's license numbers, passport
numbers, and vehicle license and identification numbers.

Re: Venceremos Brigade
105-195696

The passport file review conducted in 211 VB cases: usually
indicated a Social Security number. The NCIC for
questioning only are for the exclusive use of ¢ Tureau

and the fact that sucht stops may be placed should sot be made
known outside the Bureau. Stops should be pinced within

30 days from the date of this airtel.

Although informant coverage for the second and
third contingents of the VB was considered ad ate, there is
a continuing need for Bureau sources within th: VB ata
policy-making level, Efforts should be intensified to reernit
informants who are members of the National Comittee of the VB
in order that the Bureau may be informed in advance of policy
decisions of this Castro-oriented group.

Information has come to the Bureau's attention which
indicates that the Cuban Government is exercising wore control
as to organization policies and activities and selection of
individual members of the VB. Every effcrt must be made to
obtain proof of violations of the laws of the U.S, by members
of the VB or by members of the Cuban Government acting in
concert with the VE. All offices should be alert for violations
of the Foreign Agents Registration Act, of the various
espionage statutes, and of the various laws admini rad by the
Internal Revenue Service relating to funds for ors nations
such as the VB, and intensive investigations of p' e
violations should be conducted from a prosecutive standpoint.

Memo for Mr. Tolson
; RE: Stop Index
BEE National Crime Information Center (NCIC)

In order to program (instruct) the NCIC computer to handle such
a Stop Index for the FBI, it would cost approximately $1320 of employee
time. Computer storage is available and would not be extensive since it is
estimated by the investigative divisions that the Stop Index file would not
exceed 10, 000 entries during the first year.

It was the unanimous opinion of the Conference that the above-
proposed Stop Index in the NCIC should be established.

RECOMMENDED ACTION:
That the Domestic Intelligence, Special Investigative, General
Investigative, Administrative and Crime Records Divisions work out the

necessary details to place the Stop Index into effect, with criteria and
procedures for implementing the program to be sent through for approval.

The Stop Index File now contains approximately 3, _
individuals and vehicles. With the addition of new categories of
subjects the file will continue to expand and the number of inquiries
will increase, In order to insure that only those individuals meeting
the approved Stop Index criterion are entered, the appropriate substantive
Division at Headquarters should review and approve all requests prior
to actual entry with the exception of Selective Service delinquents. If
the request for entry is approved, a copy of the request should be so
noted and routed to the Voucher-Statistical Section.

A ney{iorm (FD-457) has been designed and approved for oP

entry, modification and cancellation of a Stop Index record. The form
“will be used for all authorized categories with the exception of Selective
Service cases which will continue to be processed from a copy of the
FD-165 (Wanted-Flash- Cancellation Notice) which is prepared for the
Identification Division.

Rememo from N. F. Stultz to Mr. Campbell 9/11/73
enclosing a draft prepared by the Law Enforcement Assistance
Administration (LEAA) of proposed security and privacy regulations
governing criminal justice information systems funded by LEAA.

It was requested that comments of interested Divisions be
furnished to the Computer Systems Division.

That portion of the regulations which would affect —

I Intelligence Division (INTD) operations, in that it would place f

I restrictions on the use of the Stop Index, is included in te
Section 7, which relates to criminal intelligence information
systems, "Criminal intelligence information" is defined as
"any information contained in a criminal justice information
system and indexed under an individual's name, or retrievable
by reference to an individual by name, or otherwise associated
with an identifiable individual, other than criminal offender
record information."' Section 7 reads, in part, ‘Information i
regarding an individual may be entered into a criminal intelli- bs
gence information system only if reasonable cause exists to. A

The Bureau's Stop” ndex would presumably bexeategori:
aS a criminal intelligence information system. INTD matters
contained in the Stop Index include individuals in Catege:
the ADEX; urban guerrilla warfare suspects; Venceremos Brigade
members; Medburg case individuals; Weatherman suspects,
including the known false identities used by them; and -license
numbers of vehicles used by official personnel attached to
communist-bloc establishments in the United States. In many:
instances these matters do not fit the criteria for entry as
outlined in Section 7 of the proposed regulations.

By memo M. F. Row to Mr. Soyars 5/1/73, it was Fecommented”
and approved that captioned program be evaluated semiannually beginning with
the period 12/31/73. The field offices have now submitted their first six-months
reports. The Intelligence Division, General Investigative Division and Special

memo from each of these Divisions setting forth the results of this analysis is .
attached.

The great majority of the field offices felt that the Stop Index has
great potential and a substantial number cited positive results from its use.
Most of them recommended the continuance of the Stop Index program; however,
a few expressed doubt as to whether the program should be continued and two
recommend outright that the Stop Index program be discontinued. Albuquerque,
Dallas and Philadelphia felt that the danger of losing public support for NCIC
shouldthe existence of Stop Index become known overshadowed the benefits of
the program. It was pointed out that the now defunct Counterintelligence
Programs (COINTELPROS) became known to the public despite caveats designed ',
to protect their in-house nature. /

pre diff fe

Several field offices made recommendations to expand the categories ©
included in the Stop Index. ‘Others made recommendations to eliminate some
categories. Still other field offices recommended some minor changes to the
program. None of these suggestions will be considered at this time pending a
decision as to whether the Stop Index program is to be continued. Ba

Re: Stop Index Program Evaluation
Recommendation for Discontinuance

and 17 hits respectively concerning bank robbery suspects. On one occasion

a hit was useful in determining the death of a bank robbery subject who was

at that time being sought for interview. On a second occasion a bank robbery
suspect was located as a result of a hit and thereafter admitted his participation
and that of other individuals in two separate bank robberies. The General
Investigative Division believes that the Stop Index is a valuable investigative

aid with great intelligence potential and should, therefore, be continued.

The Special Investigative Division advised that in one of the more
important areas (Organized Crime Figures and Top Echelon . . Criminal
Informants) less than a dozen instances were cited of Stop Index "hits" producing
positive results with only two examples set forth in detail. More than 20 Selective
Service subjects were located and interviewed as a result of Stop Index "hits."

| The Special Investigative Division believes the Stop Index has shown some promise
{ to date and if it can be retained without jeopardizing other Bureau operations

| (such as NCIC) then it should be continued for another trial period of six months

| with the field offices being instructed to maintain more accurate records so that
{a better evaluation can be obtained.

The Intelligence Division advises that Los Angeles cited three
examples of hits on subjects with close association with Weatherman activity
and these hits were of assistance in learning the whereabouts and activities of-
these individuals. Boston cited four examples of hits on Revolutionary Activity
and Extremist subjects which resulted in determining their locations. Portland
also cited examples of positive results from Stop Index hits including one on a
missing Weatherman, resulting in his location. On this particular individual
over a dozen hits were received over a period of time from different parts of
the country and it is Portland's opinion that because of his nomadic nature his
whereabouts can only be ascertained through the continuation of the Stop Index
program. The Intelligence Division advised there is no question that Stop Index
is a useful and cost-effective investigative tool but it is not a crucial tool - nota.
technique that if taken away would seriously jeopardize the success of the overall’
investigative responsibilities of that Division. They raised the issue of whether
we are on solid ground (1) in maintaining a computerized file essentially-for _
intelligence purposes on individuals against whom warrants are not outstanding

‘ i : OVER ...-05



Memo to Mr. Jenkins
Re: Stop Index Program Evaluation
Recommendation for Discontinuance

and (2) in systematically running this file against all NCIC queries in an
attempt to develop further intelligence concerning these individuals which
would be of interest to us, this being a technique which is not available to
other users of NCIC. Intelligence Division's position is that if by continuing

| the Stop Index NCIC operations would be jeopardized the Stop Index should be
discontinued.

a
After careful consideration of the comments of various field offices
and of the three Divisions who have analyzed the six-months results, it is my
[frm belief that the Stop Index should be discontinued immediately for the
following reasons:

1. -A full disclosure of the existence of this file, which

must be recognized as a distinct possibility in our

present environment, would be a severe blow to FBI

credibility. We have stated categorically in writing

to Congress and others that we have no intelligence

data in our computer banks. While this is technically

true since the Stop Index data is maintained off-line

and off-line searches are made against NCIC activities

this would be a shallow argument with which to combat

criticism.

)

2. Although some positive results have been cited by

a few field offices and the majority believe there is

good potential in the continuance of the program there

have not been any substantial accomplishments at least

to the extent that would justify the risk we are running

in maintaining the program. Although the present

evaluation program only covered a six-months period

the Stop Index program has been in existence for several

years and if it was really going to result in major

accomplishments such should be evident by now. _.. -7~

Memo to Mr. Jenkins
Re: Stop Index Program Evaluation
Recommendation for Discontinuance

3. Provisions of the Security and Privacy Bill
being introduced by the Attorney General and
similar bills being introduced by Ervin and others,
if passed, could throw doubt on the legality of the
Stop Index operation.

4. The cost in the Computer Systems Division of
operating the Stop Index program as it now exists

has been determined to be approximately $50, 000.
This does not take into consideration cost of the
substantive divisions at FBIHQ or costs in the various
field offices.

I strongly feel that the risks to our credibility far outweigh any
positive results of the Stop Index program. It is believed that a decision as
to whether the program should be continued should be made immediately since
in the Director's testimony before the House and Senate Committees on the
pending Security and Privacy Bill he could very well be asked questions whose
answers would involve the Stop Index program.

RECOMMENDATION: That the Stop Index program be immediately discontinued
and the field so advised.

A Reference Sizoo to Brennan memorandum 8/5/70 advising

that former Special Agent Charles Stine contacted Mr. Sizoo from
Ohio seeking to establish liaison between the Commission staff
conducting investigation at Kent and the FBI. Stine was advised
that contact with the Bureau should be handled through established
headquarters channels. Subsequent to this, Mr. James Arthur,
Administrative Officer of the Commission, contacted Supervisor R. H.
Haynes, who has served as the point of contact with the,Commission, |
and stated that Stine. had called Commission headquarters in
Washington with request that inquiry be made of the FBI concerning
photographic coverage of the Kent State disorders. The Bureau's
reports were furnished to the.Commission at the direction of the
White House, are in.the possession of the investigative team at
Kent, and, therefore, Arthur had some difficulty understanding

what Stiue wanted, He asked if it would be satisfactory if Stine 4
called Haynes directly and was told this would be all right.

Stine called late in the afternoon of 8/5/70 and advised -

that he had just joined the Commission staff under Kenneth McIntire ij

that morning. He is still trying to get his feet on the ground

but has several requests from McIntire. He stated that the

investigative reports contain references to photographs obtained

from students and other citizens and wanted to know if these

photographs would be available to the Commission as McIntire felt

they would be helpful. He was advised that previous inquiry had

been made regarding these photographs and they had been furnished

to the Commission in Washington and he should contact Arthur in

this regard (this is inaccordance with Wannall to Brennan memorandum

Memorandum from W. R. Wannall to Mr. C. D,. Brennan
RE: PRESIDENT'S COMMISSION ON CAMPUS UNREST

{ networks refused to furnish the film to the FBI without a subpoena,

This was referred to the Department of Justice and no further
laction was taken,

Stine volunteered that the Commission is planning to

hold hearings on the Kent State affair commencing August 21st.

the location is not yet settled, but there is some feeling that
the hearings could create incidents if held at Kent so there is*
some thought to holding them in Cleveland. Stine stated that the
‘Commission staff in reviewing the FBI reports were "flabbergasted"
‘that the Bureau had done such a big job in such a short time,

i'fhe Bureau reports are most helpful and they are not going to try
‘to re-cover the same ground but are going to try to look into aspects
fother than those covered in such great detail by the Bureau, such

as the administration of the college and events occurring prior to
tthe disturbance on May 4th. He asked if the Commission staff should
develop information not covered in the Bureau's reports, would the
Bureau wish to be advised of this. He was told that any information
which they develop which he believes might fall within the Bureau's
jurisdictional respotsibilities, the Bureau would accept it.

Stine said that inasmuch as he was previously acquainted
with the Ohio State Patrol, he was assigned by McIntire to handle
liaison with that organization. Upon briefing the head of the
State Patrol on his assignment with the Commission, the head of the
Patrol commented, "So you have joined the camp of the enemy."

Stine thought this was a most curious statement and wondered what
the basis of it could be, No comment at all was made to Stine
in this regard. sd isa

Rosen to Sullivan’ Memorandum
RE; KENFOUR

The Commission report stated four students
were killed and nine were wounded and it quoted from
FBI Laboratory reports the distances of each killed
and wounded student from the firing line. The report
stated that the FBI has located no evidence of sniper
fire, The report also mentioned that the FBI had 2
collected 340 rocks weighing 175 paunds at thé scene
of the shooting,

The Commission's report also includes
approximately 60 pages of photographs taken during
and after the shooting at KSU. For the most part,
these are photographs collected in our investigation
and furnished to the Commission.

The Commission's press release noted that
its investigation at Kent State was especially sensitive
because a State Grand gury began proceedings in September
while the report‘ was being prepared. The State Grand
Jury is currently sitting and conducting hearings con-
cerning the Kent State incidents. Copies of FBI reports
were furnzhed to the Ohio State Attorney General by the
Civil Rights Division.

For information. Events relating to -the

WASHINGTON, D. C., Oct. 3 -- The President's Goniiiseion
on Campus Unrest today condemned as "intolerable" the
violent actions of some students and nonstudents at Kent
State University and labeled “unnecessary, unwarranted ‘
and inexcusable" the fusillade of gunfire by Ohio
National Guardsmen that'killed four and wounded nine
students on ‘the Kent State campus on May 4.
: In a report released today by the White House,
the nine-member panel said that “the actions of some
students were violent and those of others were dangerous,.
reckless and irresponsible." But the danger ‘the.
guardsmen faced "was not a danger which called for lethal
force," the panel said. "The 61 shots by guardsmen
certainly cannot be justified." >
The lessons learned from Kent State were drawn upon
in making its report issued September 26. The special
report on the events at Kent State demonstrates vividly

that those lessons must be learned by the Guard, students,

police and faculty. =e

"The widespread student opposition to the
Cambodian action and their general resentment of the
National Guard's presence on the campus cannot justify
the violent and irresponsible actions of many students ,
during the long weekend" stated the panel.

Even so, the Commission pointed out there would
have been no deaths if the guardsmen had not beén °
equipped with loaded M-1 rifles which are highs velocity
weapons with a horizontal range of almost two miles.

As the. quardsmen gonfrontea the students, the
_nine-man panel recalled "all that stood between the
, guardsmen and firing was the flick of a thumb on a
safety mechanism and the pull of an index finger ona

trigger.

| “ "The Kent State tragedy. must surely mark the last
time that loaded rifles are issued as a matter of course
4

to guardsmen confronting student demonstrators," said

the Commission.

“Kent State was a national tragedv," the Commission
said, but it was not a unigue tragedy. "Only the magnitude
of the student disorder and the extent of students' deaths.
and injuries set it apart from the occurrences on numerous

other American campuses during the past few years."

The events at Kent State illustrate the necessity

for adopting the recommendations made in its general

report,said the Commission. 7
' The Commission described in detail the events

of the first four days in May in Kent including wide-

spread disorder in the city of Kent on May 1, and burning"

on May 2 and disorderly rallies on May 3. The Commission

stated that "those who wreaked havoc on the town of

Kent, those who burned the ROTC building, those who

urged them on and applauded their deeds share the

responsibility for the deaths and injuries of Mav 4."

The Commission pointed out that the May 4 rally
began as a péaceful assembly on the Commons, the
traditionai site of student assemblies. They noted
that even if the Guard had the authority to prohibit
a peaceful gathering -- a debatable proposition ~--

"the decision to disperse the noon .rally was a serious
error."

: The "timing and-manner of the dispersal were
disastrous. Many students were legitimately in the
area as they went to and from class. The rally was
held during the crowded noon-time lunch period, and

there was no apparent impending violence," said the

report.

The Commission noted that only when the guard
attempted to disperse the rally did some students react
violently. “Under these circumstances," the panel
continued,"the Guard's decision to march through the
crowd for hundreds of yards up and down a hill was

highly questionable. In fact, the Guard never did

disperse the crowd...Guardsmen had been subjected to
harassment and assault, were hot and tired, and felt
dangerously vulnerable by the time they returned to

the top of Blanket Hill. ; Gat

When guardsmen confronted the students, "it was
only too easy for a single shot to trigger a general
fusillade," the Commission said.
| The panel noted that many students considered ithe
Guard's march from the ROTC ruins across the Commons
up Blanket Hill, down to the practice football field,
and back to Blanket Hill as a kind ‘of charade.’ The
report told of tear gas cannisters tossed back and forth

‘to the cheers of the crowd, many of whom acted as if

they were watching a game. | er
"Guardsmen have claimed that they were under an
increasingly heavy barrage of rocks and other objects
as they advanced back up Blanket Hill, and that :
students rushed toward them threateningly," the vanel
said. "Many indicated that they began firing when
-they heard one.or some of their fellow guardsmen open

fire."
~-more--



-5-

The Commission stated that the closest student
killed was 85 yards from the Guard at ‘the time of the
shooting. The closest of the nine wounded students
was 20 yards from the Guard.

"The Guard fired amidst great turmoil and con-
fusion, engendered in part by theiz own activities. But
the guardsmen should not have been able to kill so :
easily in the first place. The general issuance of
loaded weapons to law enforcement officers engaged in

controlling disorders is never justified except in the
..

case of armed resistance that trained sniper teams are

unable to handle. Thistwas not the case at Kent State,
yet each guardsman: carried a loaded M-1 rifle.

"No one would have died at Kent State if this
lesson had been learned by the Ohio National Guard."

In the preface to the report, the Commission noted,
that its task at Kent State was especially sensitive.
At the outset of the Commission's investigation, the |
Kent incidents had not been placed’ before any grand
jury, either county, state or federal. During the
investigation, the Attorney General of Ohio announced the
convening of a state grand jury. The grand jury began
proceedings in September as the Kent report was being

prepared.

EXTREMIST MATTERS rthcbateaied arg

Mrs. Neenan,

During the morning session of the Special Agent in
Charge (SAC) conference held at FBI Headquarters on 9/26/72, the

fi ghetto informant program becamé the topic of a lively discussion
: with various opinions expressed concerning the most efficient
i utilization of this program, It was agreed that further study

‘ - of the ghetto informant program is necessary. Accordingly,

attached for approval is an airtel to all offices instructing
each SAC to submit their recommendapions concerning the ghetto

nf t .
informant program. ee RECAB cen ai BE

The ghetto informant program was instituted on 10/11/67,
- to fulfill an urgent need to develop a network of “listening posts"
i in the ghetto areas of our cities, Ghetto informants are those
persons living or working in ghetto areas who could furnish
information concerning the potential for riots and violent civil
unrest, As the field gained experience in the handling of these
informants, their value steadily increased, The "listening post"
concept was expanded and ghetto informants are now utilized to
attend public meetings held by extremists, to identify extremists
passing through or lbcating in the ghetto area, to identify

re purveyors of extremist literature as well as given specific assign-

security, During the recent inspection of the Domestic
Intelligence Division, it was concluded that a modified
ghetto informant program would streamline and improve the
efficiency of the existing program. This was to be achieved
by having only Special Agents assigned to extremist matters
handle ghetto informants and instructing the SACs to reduce
their ghetto informant numbers by 50 percent in order to
eliminate the less productive informants, To date this
modified program has not been approved.

As a result of the number of views expressed during
the SAC conference on 9/26/72, concerning the appropriate
utilization of ghetto informants, there is a need to obtain
the opinion of all SACs before considering modifying the
existing program. Accordingly, there is attached an airtel to
all SACs with instructions to promptly analyze their ghetto
informant program and submit their recommendations concerning
the most efficient use of these informants in accordance to their
needs to fulfill their respective responsibilities in the
extremist field, Upon receipt of these views, a thorough review
will be made at FBI Headquarters and appropriate recommendation
that will best serve the needs of all field offices will be
made.

RECOMMENDATION :

The attached airtel be approved and sent in accordance
with the above.

GHETTO INFORMANT PROGRAM
EXTREMIST MATTERS
BUDED 10/9/72

The Bureau is currently considering modifying the ghetto
informant program for the purpose of achieving greater efficiency
and maximum utilization of these informants while carefully preserv-
ing the "listening post" concept of the program,

One proposed change to the ghetto informant program
recommends a reduction in the number of these informants by fifty
percent and the handling ef these informants exclusively by Special
Agents assigned to extremist matters, This proposal emphasizes
quality and the closing, where appropriate, or redesignation of
those informants best suited as extremist, criminal or security
informants,

The proposed modification of the ghetto informant program
was discyssed during the 9/26/72 session of the Special Agent in
Charge (SAC) conference held at FBI Headquarters, A number of
opinions were expressed as to the value of ghetto informants in
enabling each office to fill its responsibility in the extremist
field. It was agreed that further study of the program is necessary
before initiating any modification of the program,

For your ready reference, our ghetto informant program

Re: Ghetto Informant Program

Captioned "Upgrading Extremist Ghetto Informant Program."
This airtel requires that ghetto informants be the type of
individuals who can obtain information concerning black
extremists who are operating in the ghetto areas and planning
or perpetrating guerrilla-type activities such as robberies,
attacks on police, and other violent activities, Our current
ghetto informant program requires that these informants be
given positive assignments and that they be evaluated on a
yearly basis in order to close the unproductive informant.

To assist the Bureau in determining what changes,
if any, should be made to the existing ghetto informant
program, you are instructed to carefully analyze your ghetto
informant program in line with the following points and sub-
mit your recommendations to reach the Bureau by 10/9/72,
Bear in mind our purpose is to have a uniform program to
best do the job intended:

1? Retain current program without modification,

. 2) Adopt the proposed change set out above calling
for a fifty percent reduction in the number of ghetto
informants. Should you disagree with the fifty percent
reduction, submit your recommendation concerning the
percent of reduction you consider appropriate with an
explanation as to how you arrived at your conclusion,
Bear in mind that quality is difficult without
quantitative measurement, _

3) Other’ changes believed necessary.

4) Abolish the ghetto program in its entirety.
If you recommend the program be abolished, submit
specific alternate program you recommend to obtain

the intelligence information now being developed by
ghetto informants.

$ The purpose of the memorandum is to secure
approval of a letter to all offices modifying instructions
concerning the ghetto informant program.

A survey of all field offices relative to the
ghetto informant program has been completed,

The field overwhelmingly expressed a desire to
continue the program; however, a number of suggestions were
offered to modify certain aspects of it.

Based upon a review of the results of this survey Clb

the following recommendations are made: me
. 1) The number of informants operated under this

program should definitely be governed by the needs of a

specific office as dete i ent in Charge

e Attached letter will instruct each office to conduct
an analysis to determine, its needs and only those informants
absolutely necessary to fulfill the needs of the office are
to be operated, The letter will also instruct that this
program is not to be utilized as a device to increase the

office case load.

continue to accept this valuable side benefit and will
record the office statistical accomplishments as we have
done in the past.

3) The offices responding in the survey were
about equally divided as to whether these informants should
be handled exclusively by Agents assigned to extremist and
security matters or by all Agents in the office, Attached
letter will instruct that this should be left to the
discretion of each SAC, In this connection it will also be
emphasized that the SAC is not to levy an arbitra require-
ment that each Agent™must have a certain number of these
informants,

4) Wg, recommend that the name of S$ pro
be changed from'ghetto informant" toYturban“informant" as

some offices actually do not have "ghetto" areas but do
have certain geographical locations of potential civil

unrest and extremist ativity,
.

As of September 1, 1972, we were operating 7,482
ghetto informants, It is not possible to determine at this
time the number of these informants that we will end up with
based on the instructions set forth in attached letter,
However, we anticipate a decrease from the existing level.

OBSERVATION: There have been a variety of opinions expressed
in the past on the value of the ghetto informant program and,
in fact, we have utilized a discussion of this program to

"warm up" Agent conferences and in-service classes because

of the lively discussion it generates, The recently completed
survey, ho ir offices were in favor

of doing away with the existing ghetto informant program.
It is obvious that this program 15 considered to be of con-

tinuing value to our field offices.

Memorandum to Mr, E. S. Miller
Re: Ghetto Informant Program

, It has been said that there has not been a single
instance where a ghetto informant has furnished significant
information pertaining to civil unrest. This is a mis-
conception because, in fact,since the inception of this
program there have been numerous times that these informants
have furnished significant information concerning civil
unrest, Examples of a few of these are as follows:

A Memphis ghetto informant identified four Negro
males who had assaulted and stabbed a high school teacher
which lead to their arrest and resulted in the quieting
of a potentially riotous situation, A Minneapolis ghetto
informant identified participants involved in a disturbance
at the University of Minnesota, A Jackson ghetto informant
provided pertinent information concerning a disturbance at

~ Jackson State College and identified four individuals

y setting fires on the campus, This informant also identified
individuals leading a mob of 100 persons attacking the
| x Reserve Officer Training Corps Building on that campus,
¢

Ghetto informants of the Knoxville Office furnished informa-
tion on black extremists extorting money from white merchants
with the threat of fire bombing their stores if they failed

to cooperate, A Norfolk ghetto informant furnished informa-
tion that a gathering of 200 young blacks had 40 fire bombs
which they intended to use. Local authorities credited this
information with avoiding a massive civil disturbance. A
Springfield ghetto informant identified an individual attempt-
ing to sell a large quantity of explosives for use in creating
a civil disturbance, A Tampa ghetto informant identified five
Negroes responsible for provoking trouble at a local school.

In addition, ghetto informants have furnished a
large amount of valuable criminal information which is perhaps
best highlighted by a recent case wherein a ghetto informant
of the Oklahoma City Office furnished the information which
lead to the identification and apprehension of four subjects
in a terrorist-type slaying of a man, his wife, and a young
son,

ADDENDUM OF THE INSPECTION DIVISION L.M.WALTERS:wmj 10/24)

‘ Ghetto Informant Program instituted 10/11/67 to fulfill a need
then recognized to develop a comprehensive network of "Listening posts"
in the ghetto areas of urban centers throughout the country. Over the
succeeding years number of such informants has gradually built to some
7500 existing today, Field inspections in past year have pointed to diffia It:
of evaluating justification for such informants because, unlike the other
informant programs (criminal, security, extremist, revolutionary
activities, and top echelon) the justification for an individual informant
cannot be supported by what he is producing, It is sufficient that ghetto
informants are geographically well dispersed and promise cooperation,

The practice of opening such cases varies widely and can be used by a
field office to effect sharp changes in total case load upward or downward,
The number of ghetto informant cases substantially affects manpower
utilization in that each ghetto informant opened requires a background
investigation and thereafter 30-day contacts.

Accordingly, during inspection (8/18 - 9/1/72) of Domestic
Intelligence Division (DID) the merits of the overall program were
thoroughly reviewed and discussed, As a result, DID proposed in inspection
that hereafter assignment of such informants be limited to those Agents
assigned to extremist squads or extremist work and that SACs be instructed
to cease levying a requirement that all Agents, regardless of assignment,
must develop and operate ghetto informants, DID estimated that such a
ap in the program would probably reduce the total number of such cases
by 50%,

The proposed letter to the field accomplishes little meaningful
change, It changes the name of the program; it provides latitude to SACs
to determine extent of program within guideline that the number of
informants operated must be deemed necessary to fulfill the needs of the
office (this has always been so); it also provides lati ude to SACs as to
whether all Agents in the office participate or only those Agents assigned to
extremist matters. Implementation of changes proposed herein would
result in an extraordinary lack of uniformity throughout the field.

The point really called into question here is whether concrete
steps should be taken to effect an overall case load reduction by sharply
reducing marginally productive cases in order to divert Ageat manpower
to more productive uses in major program areas, The broader question
is currently under consideration and the results of that consideration should



ve < e

more clearly dictate the proper approach to the Ghetto Informant
Program. Accordingly, it is recommended that any change in this
program be deferred until the overall question of case load vs,
manpower utilization is resolved,

: Re memo of G. C. Moore to Mr. E. S, Miller of 10/18/72
* on this subject.

The first paragraph of the Addendum of the Inspection Division
sets forth some of the considerations which have caused my skepticism
as to whether the benefits gained from this Program.are sufficient to
justify the costs in terms of resource utilization attendant to the Ghetto
Informant Program.

With reference to the recommendation of the Inspection Division
that no action be taken until the overall question of caseload versus man-
power utilization is resolved, I am not certain as to the precise inquiry
currently in progress which is being referred to by the Inspection Division,
If there is such an inquiry with a view towards instructing. the Domestic
Intelligence Division not to let fears as to the consequences of a reduction
in the quantity of its total caseload interfere with devoting concentrated
attention towards the most important matters within its jurisdiction, I Vf
would be the first to applaud this inquiry. UE

In this regard, the problem I see with the proposed letter of
the Domestic Intelligence Division is that by giving wide latitude to SACs
to administer the Ghetto Informant Program within their respective offices,
the memorandum is not likely to accomplish meaningful change as long as
so much turns within the Bureau on the total caseload of an office. Even
: ~ though an SAC in Field Division X believes that he could terminate his
Ghetto Informant Program altogether and, by doing so, increase the
effective utilization of his personnel, he will hesitate to make such a
decision because he knows it could well result in a substantial reduction
in his total caseload, which in turn would mean that his office would lose
Agents and/or supervisors or would not be able to on additional Agents)

Memorandum to Mr. Gray
Re: Ghetto Informant Program
Extremist Matters

This is why it seems so vitally important to achieve the
by no means easy goal of finding some way to measure the needs of an
office without resort to dependence upon the total caseload of the office
because the present reliance upon caseload figure restricts the SACs
ability to make decisions, otherwise called for, which would reduce
his total caseload.

The Domestic Intelligence Division furnished to me copies of
the responses received from the Field Divisions in connection with the
Field survey concerning the Ghetto Informant Program. The information
submitted by the Newark Division so closely approximates my opinion
concerning the Ghetto Informant Program that I am attaching a copy of
the Newark airtel to this memorandum.

"Re Burenu airtel to SAC, ALBANY, 9/28/72,

The Newark Office is in complete agreement that
modification of the ghetto informant program is necessary in
order to insure greater efficiency and maximum utilization of
these informants.

A review of ghetto informant files in the Newark
Division following the guidelines set out in Bureau airtel
dated 11/24/71 captioned "UPGRADING EXTREMIST GHETTO INFORMANT
PROGRAM" has revealed the following:

: 7 Ghetto informants are divided into two general
groups. :

The first group are those serving as “listening
posts", These informants are generally individuals who own
or are employed in such businesses as gas stations, candy
stores, barber shops, etc. and are usually in no way directly
connected with extremist or criminal matters. These individua
.are contacted on a regular basis and routinely report that
“all is quiet in the neighborhood", The vaiue of such

informants is highly questionable. © ———————____

Civil disturbances are either planned or spontancous.
In the first case, such planning is done by various militant
groups. It is the responsibility of all field offices to
have developed informants of such character in these groups
that they are in a position to furnish advance information
ree about such plans, "Listening post" informants are not ina
position to furnish information about preplanned disturbances
and they certainly cannot furnish prior information relative to
@ Spontaneous disturbance. Once a disturbance or riot has
started, it is virtually impossible to contact these individuals
inasmuch as most commercial enterprises are closed down and
entry into these areas is not feasible and.the ability of ee
informants to report by telephone is very doubéfal,

Targeting of such informants towards obtaining
information concerning black extremists, robberies, attacks on
police and other vioient activities, as well as recent targeting
towards obtaining narcotics information has been extremely Limited
in its value. In view of this, it is felt that the value of
the "listening post" is Limited and they should be eliminated.

The manner in which this action should be taken is set out later
in this comaunication.

The second group consists of those individuals opened
as ghetto informants who are considered to have definite value
in the extremist field and who are targeted to furnish specific
information relative to extremist organizations and individuals.
These informants are actually under development towards becoming
extromist informants, They are generally individuals who are
presently members of extremist organizations or are in some way
affiliated with these organizations through contact with members.
These ghetto informants are of great value for the continued
development of new informants in the extremist field. In the
Rewark Division it is this group of ghetto informants who have
furnished positive information relative to extremist activities,
as weli as contributing information relative to fugitives, bank

‘robberies and local criminal matters. They are all targeted
towards: furnishing information relative to narcotics activity.
and it is anticipated that they will be.of great: value in this
‘| field, These ghetto informants are of definite value and in

for development in a specific area. All ghetto informants
considered to be of no other value than as “listening posts"

should be closed.

In the Newark Office ghetto informants are assigned
to the extremist squad or security squads, the applicant and
accounting squads. Those assigned to other than the extremist
squad are generally “listening posts" in character. Upon
review, as set forth above, if it is determined the informant is
if of value in the extremist Zield He should be reassigned to an

of investigation, he should be appropriately reassigned. . —~ E

of Agent time and clerical time would be saved and could be
diverted to more productive and efficient usage, particularly

Memorandum to Mr. . Miller r )
RE: GHETTO INFORM: PROGRAM ;

Analysis of the then existing Security, Criminal and Extremist
Informant Programs determined that none of these existing programs could
supply the answers to the questions being asked...

The above analysis further showed that due to the orientation
of the various informant programs mentioned above, that is, criminal
informants to obtain criminal information, security informants for
security information, and extremist informants for specific information
concerning extremist organizations and known extremist individuals,
there was still a vast area where racial unrest was rampant, namely, the
ghetto areas where there was a need for a "listening post". type
informant. Accordingly, the Ghetto Informant Program was instituted.

Comparison of Ghetto Informant Operations With Other Bureau Informant
Operations

The Security Informant Program as well as the Extremist
Informant Program require tight supervision at both Headquarters and
field level because of the extreme sensitivity of these operations. As
previously stated, there was a need for development and rapid operation
of sources in the ghetto areas which were to be utilized as "listening
posts." In view of the nature of this operation, it was decided that the
tight supervision required by the other informant programs was not
necessaryy however, it was also recognized that for any program to be
fruitful and administratively sound, there must be guidelines set out..

The guidelines formulated were based on our experiences with
the Security and Extremist Informant Programs and required that some
background checks be conducted prior to: the approval of an individual as
an informant; a contact be made with the individual designated as an
informant at least once every 30 days; that any payments made to a ghetto
informant must be in accordance with Bureau policy which is also the
requirement for other informant programs.”

In synopsis, it can be said that the Ghetto Informant Program
is similar to other informant programs (security and extremist) in that
there are definite guidelines set for the designation and operation of
an individual as a ghetto informant, as well as the fact payment to these
informants must conform to Bureau regulations. In short, the Ghetto
Informant Program, although operated basically as other informant
programs, does serve a separate and distinct need which our experience
pes shown the other Bureau informant programs did not and could not

Memorandum to Mr. E. S. Miller
RE: GHETTO INFORMANT PROGRAM

Cothparison of the Justification of Ghetto Informants With
Justification of Other Existing Informant Programs

In the Inspection Division's addendum dated 10/24/72 to
the memorandum from G. C. Moore to E. S, Miller dated 10/18/72
concerning captioned matter, it was set out "Field inspections
in past year have pointed to difficulty of evaluating
justification for such informants (this refers to ghetto
informants) because, unlike the other informant programs
(criminal, security, extremist, revolutionary activities, and

top echelon) the justification for an individual informant
cannot be supported by what he is producing."

The Inspection Division's difficulties have not previous].
been brought to the attention of the Domestic Intelligence
Division (DID), however, this Division does not agree with the
above set out difficulty.

The statistical accomplishments of the ghetto informants
havé been set out numerous times, therefore, this in itself would
sassist in making a justification for ghetto informants; but,
it is more important that the ghetto informants be justified
by obaining information concerning potential civil unrest.
This must be considered in light of present circumstances.
While we are not experiencing the burning of the cities that

% we did in the late 1960s, we are still living in a state of
7 |enottonal fears concerning the polarization of the races.

Therefore, based on our experiences, we recognized

| that in reporting on the pulse of a particular area in regard

\ to the potential for civil unrest it is very important to
know that there is no indication of civil unrest in a particular
area at a particular time, as well as knowing that there are
indications of civil unrest. Accordingly, the report that there
is no indication of civil unrest in a particular area is
considered positive information and should be counted as such.
In accordance with these guidelines, there does not appear to
be any difficulty in justifying the continuance of a ghetto

Paragraph one of the above addendum in addition to the

makes reference to the practice of opening ghetto cases and
states these cases can be used by a field office to effect
sharp changes in total case load upward or downward. This
is merely an administrative matter and should not be considered
in connection with the concept of whether or not there should be

a Ghetto Informant Program. The value of this program has been

The above-mentioned addendum sets out that DID's

their studied critique of the program and their respective
recommendations. As a result of discussion with SACs and

Memorandum to Mr. E. S. Miller
RE: GHETTO INFORMANT PROGRAM

Mr. Gray concerning the Ghetto Informant Program on 9/26/72,
all SACs were instructed to submit their comments and
recommendations concerning this program. If we are not going
to take the recommendations of the SACs, who are our leaders
in the field, then why did we bother to request their opinions?
Likewise, they certainly are entitled to know the results o
the survey and this is what we are attempting to do.

In connection with the recommendation made that any
change in this program be deferred until the overall question
of case load versus manpower utilization is resolved, there
apparently is no indication as to when this will be resolved
and further, this question should not be the deciding factor
as to whether or not there should be a Ghetto Informant Program.

Memorandum of Mr. Daniel M. Armstrong, III dated November 2, 1972

Mr. Armstrong stated that in connection with the
inquiry concerning the overall question of case load versus
manpower that if there is such an inquiry with a view toward
instructing DID not to let fears as to the consequences of a
reduction in the quantity of its total case lodd interfere

with devoting concentrated attention towards the most important
| matters within its jurisdiction, he would be the first to
\ applaud this inquiry.

] In respect to this, DID is not aware of any fears in
connection with the above case load work load inquiry and,
| further, we will always go full steam ahead to obtain the
‘maximum quality intelligence data needed to fulfill our
responsibilities to the United States Government, regardless
| of any alleged "fears." :

Mr. Armstrong stated that the problem he sees with
DID's proposed letter of 10/20/72 is that "by giving wide
latitude to SACs to administer the Ghetto Informant Program
within their respective offices, the memorandum is not likely
to accomplish meaningful change as long as so much turns
within the Bureau on the total caseload of an office."

Again it is pointed out that the DID memorandum was intended
to give latitude to the SACs in the operation of the Ghetto
Informant Program because this basically is the recommendation
of the greater majority of SACs.

F Mr. Armstrong cited the opinion submitted_by the
Newark Division because Ito closely anpravinated his or YApproximated his own

four SACs who recommended against maintaining the program in

accordance with those set out in DID letter 10/20/72.

It is respectfully submitted that the recommendations of
53 SACs carry more weight than one SAC and that these 53 SACs
recommended that the Program be continued. The greater
Hf Majority of these individuals recommended that the Program
be. continued along with the modifications set out in DID
letter dated 10/20/72.

OBSERVATIONS :

The Ghetto Informant Program since 1967, when it was
instituted, has been analysed and critiqued not only by FBI
Headquarters personnel, SACs, but also by Field Supervisors and
Field Informant Coordinators through a series of correspondence,
as well as specialized conferences. The overriding opinion
of the majority of individuals involved in the above has
been that this program has in the past and still is an

' effective productive program. The program serves a vital
need, that is, the need to know the potential for acts of
civil disturbances that could not only disrupt the operations
in local communities, but could also cause disruption on a
nationwide basis.

The above article sets out the hostility of racial

declare it a threat to our national security. It further
points out the tensions and violence that exist in our high
schools and states that traditional white racism has collided
with a virulent new black nationalism to drive the races as far

destructive impact on the stability of our society.

ADDENDUM OF THE INSPECTION DIVISION J.H. TRIMBACH:wmj 01/24/72

The attached series of documents arose from DID inspection review of
Ghetto Informant Program, 8/18 - 9/1/72. Inspection Division adheres to its
position expressed in addendum to 10/18/72 memorandum attached and still feels
that the proposed letter to the field contains no meaningful change in the
operation of the Ghetto Informant Program.

Under the heading, "Need for the Ghetto Informant Program," in foregoing
memorandum (page 1, last paragraph), DID mentions questions such as "Are
these (racial) disturbances spontaneous or are they planned?", and "Are these
disturbances caused by organizations or individuals?", as questions asked by
high Government officials after the racial disturbances of 1967. Inspection Division
feels that advance information responsive to such intelligence needs must be
obtained from productive, well-placed Security, Revolutionary Activities, and
Extremist Informants, or as by-product information from Criminal Informants
and other sources from whom we have reasonable expectation of positive
information reporting based on past experience, Our current concept of
a Ghetto Informant includes the proprietor of a candy store or barber shop in
a ghetto (under new proposal in an urban area) who may or may not have
Such information, One such proprietor could have significant information about
an impending racial disturbance and another may not, Can we assume that our
Ghetto Informant is the local proprietor with the answer because we have
selected him in the neighborhood as a listed Ghetto Informant?

Inspection Division feels that the Ghetto Informant Program as viewed by the
DID is different from all other informant programs in at least one highly
important respect. On page 3 of the memorandum, it is stated that the report
(from a Ghetto Informant) that there is no indication of civil unrest in a particular
area is considered "positive" information and should be counted as such. Negative
information is not counted as positive information in any other informant program
and in other programs we obtain some history of the furnishing of productive in-
formation before forming a conclusion that the individual is worthy of continued
contact or further development, If we accept the views of the DID, then every
Ghetto Informant opened by an office and established for monthly contact is
capable of furnishing "positive" information because everyone is capable of
Saying they do not have information indicating civil unrest,

Some Ghetto Informants have in the past furnished information in extremist
or criminal matters, This has been recognized as a by-product of the Ghetto
Informant Program, A more meaningful approach to this whole problem might be
to concentrate more heavily in ghetto areas to develop proven Security, Extremist,
Revolutionary Activities, and Criminal Informants upon whom we can then rely to
keep us advised of civil disturbance plans as a steady by-product to the information

2989648 Page 461 fiat :



they are regularly furnishing on domestic intelligence or criminal matters,
Existing Ghetto Informants who have shown productivity in any area of FBI
jurisdiction should be converted to the appropriate substantive informant
program to which their services relate, Further, all informants designated

in the other informant programs who are strategically located in areas of
potential civil mrest, should be briefed on supplying information that may

come to their attention relating to develqing tensions and civil unrest, Such
approach would, in our view, represent a better ordering of priorities and not
have the "cart before the horse," Moreover, we have some concern of
justifiable apprehension that might be expressed by the Congress or the public

if this program were to be described in terms out of context with our real intentions,
We could fully defend informants providing us regularly with information directly
related to our jurisdictional responsibilities and using them for "by-product"
information on civil umrest., It would be much more difficult to defend
establishment of ghetto or urban listening posts all over the country with a
possible by-product of information directly within our jurisdiction,

In our view, the Ghetto Informant Program is not a proven program and in
view of the manpower expended on it, the decision as to whether we should
keep it, modify it, or abolish it should be made after a decision is reached
concerning the overall question of case Jo tilizatio ing

Re memorandum from Mr. G. C. Moore to Mr. E. S. Miller,
dated November 20, 1972, on this subject and the addendum of the Inspection
Division thereto, dated November 24, 1972.

As noted in the addendum of the Inspection Division, the(Grban.
Informant Program formerly. known as the‘Ghetto Informant Program
differs from all other informan ‘ams in that negative inforn i
under this program, counted as positive information.

It would appear from Section 130 (H) (2) (b) (4) of the Manual of
Instructions that an urban informant who does nothing more than advise our
inquiring Agents that there is no indication of civil unrest in his particular
area could qualify for payments on a regular basis under Bureau authority.

* In this regard, I believe it would be useful to know (1) how
many of the Bureau's present urban informants are being paid on a regular
basis, (2) of that number, how many have furnished only information to the
effect that there is no indication of civil unrest in their areas and (3) of
those urban informants not paid on a regular basis, are there documented
cases in which those informants have been paid for saying that there is no
H indication of civil unrest in their areas?

The answer to Question (1) would appear to be readily available.
The answers to the other questions, especially Guggtion (2), might be
\ difficult to obtain. no , pe
[Vo +e
If you deem it appropriate, I would be pleased to have you obtain
the answers to one or more of the above questions, or I would make the

effort myself. I would understand completely if you conclude thatthe’“~ “= 7"

concerning this controversial program.

Messrs. Armstrong, Walters and-Miller met on 2/20/73 at

__ Program designed to be beneficial to the Bureau's

‘ operation both in the field and at FBIHQ.

/ : In accordance with Mr. Gray's instructions,

The new revised Extremist Informant Program
eliminates urban (ghetto) informants and is limited to

potential extremist informants (PEI), extremist informants

(EI), and confidential sources-extremist (CS-E).

Definitions and qualifications for these new
informant categories are as follows:

Potential Extremist Informant:

’
A PEI is an individual who is in a position to
furnish information concerning extremist activities of

individuals and organizations as well as information of an
extremist nature in those geographical areas where there is

a potential for violence.

The personal authority of the SAC is necessary to
designate and operate an individual as a PEI with exceptions
as noted below. These informants are to be operated for a
period of not more than one year and not less than six months
providing their potential is such that it appears he will qualify

Memorandum to Mr. W. M. Felt
Re: Extremist Informant Program

The following are exceptions to the SAC's authority
for granting the approval of the operation of a PEI. If any
of the following conditions exist, the SAC must submit his
recommendation to FBIHQ on a UACB basis:

‘1. Any individual in a sensitive position (i.e. news
media, educational field or any other field where disclosure
as an informant would cause concern to the Bureau).

2. Any individual being placed in an extremist
organization or any individual presently in an extremist
organization.

3. Any individual who has been charged with a
felony violation in the past five years.

4. Any individual who is presently under indictment
| or is on probation or parole, Federal or local.

5. Any individual with an unsavory background yet
who,is in a position to furnish uniquely valuable information
not available from other sources.

The Special Agent in Charge has authority to
authorize payments to PEIs in the amount of up to $400.
Additional payment authority must be obtained from FBIHQ.

Bureau authority is necessary to elevate a PEI to
an EI, Field recommendation must contain full justification.
If PEI does not qualify for EI within one year, he must be
discontinued. :

Extremist Informant:

| An EI is an individual who has been operated as a
PEI for at least six months (in order that his reliability can
be properly evaluated) and is furnishing extremist information
on a regular basis whether it be concerning an extremist

Re: Extremist Informant Program

organization or an unaffiliated extremist. In order to elevate
a PEI to an EI, he must have produced authentic data on
extremist activities and be in a position to continue furnishing
extremist intelligence information.

Confidential Sources-Extremist:

A CS-E is an individual who is willing to cooperate
with the Bureau by furnishing extremist information brought
to his attention by virtue of his position in the community,
by his employment, or in view of his background in extremist
activities, This individual, whose identity must be protected,
will not be actively seeking information on behalf of the
Bureau,

OBSERVATIONS:

We contemplate no changes’in the existing extremist
requirements as they pertain to background investigation,
payments, or other administrative policy.

Our present urban informants will be evaluated to
determine if they should be considered in the future as Els,
PEIs, CS-E, directed to the Security or Criminal Informant
Programs, or discontinued altogether.

No individual will be operated as an EI or PEI solely
because he is in a "listening post" position. To insure we
have informant coverage in those areas where there is a potential
for violence, instructions will be issued to each SAC to insure
all Special Agent personnel are aware of the need for developing
information where there is a potential for violence and that
those Special Agents not directly involved with extremist
matters refer those individuals who may possess information of
potential violence to the Extremist Supervisor in order that
their informant potential may be assessed.

Re: Extremist Informant Program

. The field will be instructed that CS-Es are not
to be kept in a pending status unless these sources are
furnishing information on a regular basis. Sources reporting
infrequently may be operated from a pending file with a

ADDENDUM 4/6/73

Mr. Gray in his instructions of 12/11/72, which led to the
aforementioned meeting of 2/20/73, said he was not persuaded that the
"listening post" concept continued to have merit. "Tt is," he said, "a
luxury that we cannot afford at the present." In view of the fact that the
“listening post" concept has up to now been a central feature of the Urban
(Ghetto) Informant Program, Mr. Gray's comments clearly contemplate
a major change in this program.

Tn order to insure effective implementation of the new policy,
it is therefore important that SAC's clearly understand that a major change
is intended, Unless the new policy is spelled out in unmistakably clear
terms, SAC's may understandably interpret the new policy as not repre-
senting a major change from the past. The motivation for this kind of
interpretation is great because such an interpretation would be most
consistent with the maintenance of a high case load of urban (ghetto)
informants, and SAC's continue, I fear, to operate on the assumption
(erroneous I hope) that any significant decrease in their case loads,
regardless of the circumstances leading to the decrease, will automatically
mean a reduction in the number of Agents assigned to their Divisions, etc.

It is with the above in mind that I venture the following comments

on the proposed description of the revised Extremist Informant Program.
.

1, The revised policy statement should include language that
the revised Extremist Informant Program is designed to reduce substantially
the number of non-productive informants in the Urban (Ghetto) Informant
Program who have not provided positive specific intelligence concerning
extremist, security or criminal activities. The SAC's should be told that
careful and close attention must be given to insure that each informant
operating in the revised Extremist Informant Program is both in a position
to furnish and willing to furnish information of positive value to the Bureau
in the extremist area. :

2. I would define a PEI simply as an individual who is in a position
to furnish information concerning extremist activities of individuals and/or
organizations. If we are covering both known individuals and organizations
with a potential for violence, "geographical areas where there is a potential
for violence" should automatically be covered, An additional reference to
"geographical areas...." is therefore unnecessary and could be confusing

NW 68262 Docld:32989648 Page 473



ADDENDUM (Continued. ..)

to SAC's since they are told elsewhere that mere “listening posts" are no
longer to be operated.

3. Ifa PEI is defined as suggested in #2, it is not clear who else
would be left in the great majority of situations for an SAC to approve as a
PEI except an individual who is be ing placed in an extremist organization or
an individual who is presently in an extremist organization. Therefore,
requiring an SAC to submit a recommendation to FBI HQ before an individual
is approved as a PEI when the individual in question is being placed in an
extremist organization or is presently in an extremist organization, which
submission is required by condition #2 on page 2 of this memorandum, could
be tantamount to requiring notification to Headquarters in practically every
case, This should not be necessary because the SAC seems to be in the best
position in the great majority of cases to make a final decision as to whether
a person should be operated as a PEI.

4, With further reference to those situations on page 2 of this
memorandum describing when the SAC must submit his recommendation of
a PEI to FBI HQ, there would appear to be very few candidates for a PEI
who have not been at least charged with felony violations. Therefore, the
fact that an individual has been charged with a felony violation in the past
five years seems of no great significance to the question whether that person
should be operated as a PEI, and the SAC should not be required to notify
FBI HQ when this situation arises. Thus, I would delete condition #3, With
Specific reference to condition #5, as presently worded, this condition seems
too broad and/or ambiguous. . Practically speaking, couldn't anyone likely
to qualify as a PEI quite conceivably be described as a person with "an
unsavory background?" If so, this condition could have the effect of requiring
advance notification to FBI HQ in practically every situation, a result which,
as indicated above, I do not favor. Finally, if FBI HQ is to be notified, as is
proposed by condition #1, when the individual is in a sensitive position, I
think the SAC should be given more specific guidance astowhat is considered
to be a sensitive position. The phrase "any other field where disclosure as an
informant would cause concern to the Bureau" is too vague.

Armstrong III dated April 6, 1973, attached to Mr. G. C. Moore

to Mr. E. S. Miller memorandum dated March 6, 1973, captioned
"Extremist Informant Program." !

Set forth below are comments concerning Mr. Armstrong's
observations:

1. Mr. Armstrong suggests the revised policy
should include language that théXrevised Extremist Informant
Program is devised to reduce substantially the number of
“nonproductive informants in the Urban (Ghetto) Informant wf)
Program. We believe this is clearly stated in our nenorandys 7
to all SACs on page four, paragraph one "Under the revised,“ ’
program no individual is to be operated as an EI or PEI
solely because he is in a 'listening post! position."

2. Mr. Armstrong proposed that he would define Va
a potential extremist informant (PEI) simply as an individudl
who is in a position to furnish information concerning
extremist activities of individuals and/or organizations.
Therefore, since we are covering both known individuals and
organizations with a potential for violence, there is no need
for a reference to "geographical areas where there is a poten-
tial for violence." The key to the weakness in Mr. Armstrong's
definition is the statement "covering both known individuals
and organizations with a potential for violence." There are
many areas in the United States where known organizations and
known extremists do not operate. Nevertheless, there is a
potential for violence in these areas because of socio-economic
cond}tions that breed frustrations thereby making the individuals
imvoilved in these areas potential sparkplugs for extremist
de ators. Consequently, our definition of a PEI must be broad

Memorandum to Mr. E. §. Miller
Re: Extremist Informant Program

3. The observation that SACs have-a better insight
in the great majority of cases to make a final decision as to
whether a person should be operated as a PEI in connection
with the placing of an individual in an extremist organization
is not accurate in each and every case. It is pointed out
that extremist activity is nationwide and individual FBI field
office files do not necessarily contain full information and
background concerning these organizations and the individuals
involved in these activities. Experience has shown that
Headquarters, after considering the SAC's recommendation
is in a better position to determine an individual's suit-

ability for operation as a PEI. One of our greatest continuing

concerns is penetration of our informant ranks by extremist
"plants" as well as Agent provocateurs. Headquarters' review
of individual cases, although not necessarily one hundred
percent fullproof, is an additional necessary check. This

in no way mitigates the SAC's responsibility as his approval
and recommendation is necessary in the first instance.

4, With regard to the comment there would appear
to be very few candidates for PEI who have not been at least
charged with felony violations, it is stated that although
a great number of our informants have been charged with
violations, a felony charge in itself is not as frequent
as Mr, Armstrong believes. A sampling of forty recently
approved PEIs shows that only seven of this forty had been
charged with a felony.

5. As to the observation concerning informants
having an unsavory background, it is noted our present
regulations as set out in Section 130, Volume IV, Manual of
Instructions require that individuals with unsavory back-
grounds who would not ordinarily be considered as PEIs
because of the possibility they would not make suitable
witnesses because of unfavorable characteristics such as
extensive arrest records, excessive indebtedness, emotional
quirks, abnormal sexual practices, poor employment records,
illiteracy, and personal physical defects receive Headquarters
approval. Our operation of informants has a twofold purpose
(1) to obtain intelligence and (2) evidence necessary for
successful prosecution of violations of local and Federal
statutes. We strongly believe we must continue this
requirement to insure our objectives are attained in all
cases.

Memorandum to Mr. E, S. Miller
Re: Extremist Informant Program

As to specific guidelines furnished to SACs with
respect to individuals in sensitive positions, SACs through
past experience, are knowledgeable of the many possible
situations where operation of an informant and subsequent
disclosure could cause concern to the FBI. These areas
include the news media, entertainment field, academicians,
religious leaders, civil rights activists, politicians, and
Many others. It takes common sense on the part of the SAC
to decide the areas in his particular division which could
fit in the above categories. The samples cited in the SAC
memorandum are to serve as a flag to the SAC to remind him
of this pitfall.

OBSERVATIONS :

What we have here in the form of a memorandum to
all SACs is a completely revised Extremist Informant Program,
formulated through a long series of discussions both written
and oral, which began during the August, 1972, inspection
of the Intelligence Division. This matter has not only been
discussed thoroughly within the Section and Division but it
also has been discussed and analyzed by all SACs as well as
their supervisors.

As a result of proposals previously submitted,
Mr. Gray issued instructions that Messrs. Armstrong, Walters,
and Miller get together and come up with an Extremist Informant
Program which would serve the best interest of the FBI. Based
on these instructions from Mr. Gray, a completely revised
Extremist Informant Program, as set forth in the proposed
memorandum to all SACs, was furnished Messrs. Armstrong and
Walters for review prior to a meeting which took place on
2/20/73. This meeting was attended by Messrs. Armstrong,
Walters, and Miller as well as Mr..J. G. Deegan and
Mr. G. C. Moore of the IS-1 Section.

At the 2/20/73 meeting a thorough word-by-word
and line-by-line analysis was made of the proposed Extremist
Informant Program. Revisions were made concerning the proposals
and there was a free exchange of ideas in this regard. The
proposed SAC memorandum, which has been submitted for Mr. Gray's
approval, was agreed to by everyone present, including
Mr. Armstrong who now raises several points in which he

-3-+ CONTINUED - OVER

NW 68262 Docld:32989648 Page 477_ =



Memorandum to Mr. E. S. Miller
Re: Extremist Informant Program

differs with the proposed instructions to the field. It
seems that the time has come that we get on with the job
of getting needed instructions to the field and that the
dialogue come to an end. If Mr. Armstrong had objections,
he should have raised them when we had the meeting which
was for that purpose.

We Zeel that we have a viable, workable program
which accomplishes the purposes which Mr. Gray had in
mind. It will close out any "listening post" concept
and enable the field to concentrate on areas where the
need is greatest. Furthermore, this proposed program has
been discussed in detail at last weeks session of the Black
Extremist, Urban Guerrilla Warfare and Informant Matters
School and those in attendance who are field supervisors
and key investigative personnel were all in agreement that
the proposed Extremist Informant Program is a sound one.

RECOMMENDATION :

That attached SAC memorandum be approved and sent.

Re: Extremist Informant Program

organization or an unaffiliated extremist. In order to elevate
a PEI to an EI, he must have produced authentic data on
extremist activities and be in a position to continue furnishing
extremist intelligence information.

Confidential Source-Extremist:

A CS-E is an individual who is willing to cooperate
with the Bureau by furnishing extremist information brought
to his attention by virtue of his position in the community,
by his employment, or in view of his background in extremist
activities. This individual, whose identity must be protected,
will not be actively seeking information on behalf of the
Bureau. Prior to operating anyone as a CS-E, advise FBIHQ of
the individual's identity and the type of information he is
to furnish on a UACB basis.

OBSERVATIONS:

Our present urban informants will be evaluated to
devermine if they should be considered in the future as EIs,
PEIs, CS-Es, directed to the Security or Criminal Informant
Programs, or discontinued altogether.

No individual will be operated as an EI or PEI solely
because he is in a "listening post" position. To assure we have
informant coverage in those areas where there is a potential for
violence, instructions have been issued to each SAC to insure
all Special Agent personnel are aware of the need for developing
information where there is a potential for violence. SACs will be
instructed that those Special Agents not directly involved with
extremist matters, refer those individuals who may possess informa-
tion of potential violence to the Extremist Supervisor in order
that their informant potential may bé assessed.

The field will be instructed that CS-Es are not

provision for closing after a fixed period. of inactivity,

out, of a dead file or out of a control file. Each SAC should
determine which method of operation is best suited for his
individual needs. SACs may desire to establish an informant
map which will clearly depict coverage in any geographical area
within their division.

Evaluation of our present urban informants is to be
handled promptly and completed within sixty days.

Those informants currently carried as probationary

extremist informants should either be designated as PEIs
or elevated to EIs.

If the above revisions to the Extremist Informant
Program are approved, appropriate Manual changes will be made.

RECOMMENDATION:

That attached memorandum to all SACs be approved
in accordance with above.

UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20535

(es July 31, 1973

MEMORANDUM TO ALL SPECIAL AGENTS IN CHARGE

(A)_EXTREMIST INFORMANT PROGRAM -~ Effective immediately
changes in the Extremist Informant Program as set out below are to
be implemented. e

The revised Extremist Informant Program eliminates
the urban (ghetto) informant category and will now be limited to the
following three categories:

(a) potential extremist informant (PEI)
(b) extremist informant (EI)
(c) confidential source-extremist (CS-E)

Potential Extremist Informant:

A PET is an individual who is in a position to furnish in-
formation concerning extremist activities of individuals and organizations.
A PEI should also be utilized to furnish information of an extremist
_~ nature in those geographical areas where there is a potential for violence.

The personal authority of the SAC is necessary to designate
and operate an individual as a PEI with exceptions as noted below. These
informants are to be operated for a period of not more than one year and
not less than six months providing their potential is such that it appears
they will qualify for elevation to EI. The PEI must be discontinued im-
mediately following a determination that he has no future potential as
an EI. :

The following are exceptions to the SAC's authority for
granting the approval of the operation of a PEI. If any of the following
conditions exist, the SAC must obtain authority from FBIHQ prior to
operating any individual as a PEI:

1. Any individual in a sensitive position (i.e. news media,
educational field or any other field where disclosure as an informant
could cause concern to the Bureau).

1/3 1/73 ea
MEMORASOUN G4 B7Q73

NW 68262 Docld:32989648 Page 491


| @. . @

2. Any individual contemplating membership in, being
considered for membership in, or presently in an extremist organization.

[ 3, Any individual who has been charged with a felony
violation in the past five years.

4, Any individual who is presently under indictment or
is on probation or parole, Federal or local.

5. Any individual with an unsavory background yet who is
in a position to furnish uniquely valuable information not available from
other sources. .

The SAC has authority to authorize payments to PEIs in
the amount of up to $400. Additional payment authority must be obtained
from FBI Headquarters.

Bureau authority is necessary to elevate a PEI to an EI.
The field recommendation must contain full justification. If PEI does
not qualify as an EI within one year, he is to be discontinued.

Extremist Informant:

An EI is an individual who has been operated as a PEI for
at least six months (in order that his reliability can be properly evaluated)
and is furnishing extremist information on a regular basis whether it be
concerning an extremist organization or ‘an unaffiliated extremist. In
order to elevate a PEI to an EI, he must have produced authentic data
on extremist activities and be in a position to continue furnishing
extremist intelligence information.

Confidential Source-Extremist:

A CS-Eis an individual who is willing to cooperate with the
Bureau by furnishing extremist information coming to his attention by
virtue of his position in the community, by his employment, or in view
of his background. This individual, whose identity must be protected,
will not be actively seeking information on behalf of the Bureau. Prior
to operating anyone as a CS-E, advise FBI Headquarters of the individual's
identity and the type of information he is to furnish on a UACB basis.

CS-Es are not to be kept in a pending status unless they
are furnishing information on a regular basis. Sources reporting in-
frequently may be operated from a pending file with a provision for
closing after a fixed period of inactivity, out of a dead file or out of a
control file. Each SAC should determine which method of operation
is best suited for his individual needs. You may also desire to establish
an informant map which wiil clearly depict coverage in any geographical
area within your division.

You are instructed to carefully evaluate each of your
urban (ghetto) informants to determine if they should be considered for
redesignation as Els, PEIs, CS-Es, directed to the Security or Criminal
Informant Programs, or discontinued altogether. This should be
handled promptly and be completed within sixty days of receipt of this
communication. :

Under the revised program no individual is to be operated
as an EI or a PEI solely because he is in a "listening post" position.
It is your responsibility to insure that there is informant coverage in
those geographical areas where there is a potential for violence. Alert
all Special Agent personnel to the need for developing information where
there is a potential for violence. Instruct those Special Agents not
directly involved with extremist matters to refer those individuals who
may-possess information of potential violence to the Extremist
Supervisor in order that the informant potential of these individuals may
be assessed.

Those informants currently carried as probationary
extremist informants should either be designated as PEIs or elevated

as Els.
Appropriate Manual changes follow.

for the Stop Index has been Gee a This ae sepkesecn a
has been approved by the Director by memorandum dated 2/12/70 (attached),
provides the Capability of having the computer notify the NCIC Control Room
when an inquiry is made from any terminal in the NCIC system relative toa
non-fugitive Bureau subject whose descriptors have been placed in this index,

For example, a police officer in Boston arrests an out-of-state
individual on a minor charge, e.g. drunkenness. He routinely requests an
NCIC check relative to the arrested person to determine whether he is wanted
elsewhere. Assume that this individual is a Selective Service subject wanted
only for interview and has been entered in the Stop Index. No warrants are
outstanding for this individual and, therefore, no Wanted Person entry has
been made for him previously in NCIC. The officer would receive a negative
response to his Wanted Person File inquiry ("NO NCIC WANT"). At the sam
time as the "NO NCIC WANT" is sent to the Boston Police Department the -
NCIC Control Room would be notified by the NCIC computer of the inquiry
made against the Wanted Person File because a stop was entered in the Stop
Index, The NCIC Control Room would advise the appropriate FBI office
immediately of the Boston Police Department inquiry so that the Bureau's
interests could be secured before the arrested person is released,

Ga- NSTEAH

Initially, it is proposed that descriptors of Selective Service
subjects who are being sought for interview be placed in this file. Both of .
the following criteria must be met. :

Re: Stop Index ;
National Crime Information Center (NCIC)

1, The subject must be in a non-fugitive status (Identities of
those in fugitive status are placed in the Wanted Person file).

2. The subject*s whereabouts is unknown.

Proposed procedures for implementing this program
are as follows: 7

1. The Special Investigative Division, in coordination with
the Crime Records Division, will instruct the field to submit to the
Bureau (Attention: NCIC) the identities of those Selective Service subjects
meeting the above criteria.

2. NCIC Control Room personnel will enter the descriptors
of these subjects in the Stop Index via an NCIC Control Room terminal,

3. NCIC Control Room personnel will notify the appropriate
field office when a "hit" is made.

The productivity of the Stop Index can be tested on these
numerous Selective Service Subjects who are wanted for questioning only. . *%
RECOMMENDATION:

That the above criteria and procedures for implementing
the Stop Index be approved.

The conference considered the suggestion that certain organized - |”
crime subjects be included in the NCIC Stop Index to assist in being alerted
to inquiries directed to NCIC from police departments and other sources.
The proposal was made by the Special Investigative Division.

‘

Background of Proposal:

Over the years, subjects of interest to our organized cy
7 investigations have been frequently on the move from one part of the
SS country to another and on occasion have been subject of arrest or k
~~ enforcement inquiry. While stops are maintained in the Identificatioi 7
+ Division and elsewhere, when feasible, this gives us only limited capability
~ in learning of such Jaw enforcement interest. It has been ascertained) that
the NCIC Stop Index can now accommodate inclusion of organized cri
figures which may assist in learning of any inquiry directed to NCI

Executives Conference Memorandum

RE: PROPOSED RENAMING THE "NCIC STOP INDEX"
AND INCLUSION OF CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS OF
INTEREST TO CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITY

bearing in mind that the NCIC has been publicly identified as a facility which
will give prompt response to any law enforcement inquiry as to whether or
not process is outstanding on an individual on whom an NCIC inquiry might
be made.

Suggested Alternative to Present NCIC Stop Index:

Mr. Walters pointed out that there can be no guarantee of positive
security (immune from dissemination through error or penetration) applicable
to sensitive data if it is stored on line in any computer system with remote
terminals. Also, we emphasize in public statements that no persons are
lodged in the NCIC system unless they meet the announced criteria, pursuant
to guidelines established by the Advisory Policy Board, and the Bureau would
be sorely embarrassed if it were discovered we were not strictly abiding by
our public pronouncements. He pointed out these arguments applied with equal
force to persons already included in the Stop Index as well as to additions now
being proposed for it. Asa solution, Walters proposed the entire Stop Index,
which is strictly a Bureau investigative aid, be removed from NCIC and made
a separate program stored off line in the computers. At the end of each day
(or at any established interval), a computer program could be used to compare
that day's inquiries into NCIC (from the automatic log of such traffic maintained
on tape) against the separate Bureau Stop Index. Any “hits'” would be routed
to the interested investigative division for follow-up notification to the field.
The only disadvantage from the way the system has been operating is that the
field would not receive immediate notification. Assistant Directors of all
investigative divisions agreed,however, that the time element is not that
critical with respect to persons carried in the Stop Index.

f
The advantage to the change would be to make the Stop Index com-

pletely separate from NCIC <«#l thus provide 100% assurance against NCIC
mechanical accident which could reveal our internal Bureau Stop Index program
to NCIC user agencies.

Matters Previously Authorized for Inclusion in the NCIC Stop Index:

It was noted that at the present time as a result of previous
approval, certain representatives of the New Left, Weatherman, Medburg
subjects, Venceremos Brigade members, Top Jewel thieves, Selective
Service delinquents and miscellaneous persons on whom the field may place
a special stop are included in the NCIC Stop Index. Mr. Miller pointed out



Executives Conference Memorandum
RE: PROPOSED RENAMING THE “NCIC STOP INDEX"
AND INCLUSION OF CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS OF
* INTERES: TO CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITY

that the results of stops pertaining to subjects of interest to the Domestic
Intelligence Division turned up information with respect to the where-
abouts of these subjects which on a timely basis would not have been
available from any other source. The Special Investigative Division
pointed out that it desires the same capability for selected La Cosa Nostra
members, Top Echelon informants, material witnesses who are under
assumed names and other selected organized crime figures.

Relative Costs:

The changeover in the manner suggested would enable the
Stop Index to be operated through our ADP facilities. The Administrative
hi sed that this would be a much cheaper operation. on a
computer time which is

being utilized by the NCIC Stop mdex.
Conclusion of Executives Conference:

The conference was unanimous in agreeing that the NCIC Stop
Index should be set up as a separate entity and renamed "Stop Index**
and that the names on the Stop Index in addition to those individuals
now included should incorporate those individuals of interest to our
criminal intelligence investigations. The conference also agreed that
the Stop Index should in the future be run periodically during the day
possibly at 12-hoy¢, intervals against the inquiries directed by outside
agencies to the NE luring the previous 12-hour period and the
results provided té tne interested Division-for appropriate handling.

(C) STOP INDEX MATTER -- The Voucher-Statistical Section is now
handling the operation of the Stop Index File, which was formerly
called the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) Stop Index File.
One copy of any communication concerning the entry, modification,

and removal of Stop Index subject should be designated for the Computer
Systems Division, attention Voucher-Statistical Section. Selective
Service and Venceremos Brigade entries, modifications, and ‘
cancellations may be submitted by form FD-165, while Category I
Administrative Index (ADEX) extremist subjects should be submitted
by form FD-122. All other categories should be submitted by letter

or airtel. Subjects which have presently been approved for entry

into the Stop File are:

Selective Service Delinquents i

Venceremos Brigade Members

Medberg Case Individuals

Weatherman

Category I ADEX Extremist Subjects

Top Jewel Thieves

Top Echelon Informants

Selected Organized Crime Figures, such as
LaCosa Nostra Members

No other categories of subjects will be ‘entered into the file
without prior Bureau approval. As in the past, NCIC inquiries which
match ("hit") a record in the Stop Index, File will result in.a response
to the inquirer that there is no NCIC record. The Field Office which
entered the record into the Stop Index File will be notified of the "hit"
by teletype.

You are reminded that should a Stop Index File individual
later be entered into the NCIC Wanted Persons File, that individual
should be removed from the Stop Index File.

In the future, validation listings will be provided on
regular basis to insure the accuracy and status of each Field Office’ ieoanes

Memorandum to Mr. E. S. Miller
Re: Stop Index File Matter

independently searched by Voucher Statistical Section through
Stop Index File to ascertain if any of the traffic concerned
persons in whom the Bureau is interested. "Hits'' are furnished
only to interested field offices for follow-up investigation.

Category I, ADEX,extremist;and Weatherman subjects, as
well as Venceremos Brigade members are currently included in
Stop Index File and valuable intelligence has been secured as a
result concerning their whereabouts and activities. Expansion
of the Stop Index File to include those subjects known to be
involved in or suspected of mvolvement in urban guerrilla warfare
activities would materially assist in securing data regarding
such individuals! whereabouts and activities on a timely basis.
Stops concerning these subjects would pinpoint their possible
participation in acts of violence in that area and should
materially assist us in our investigative objectives. Subjects,
however, who are wanted by Federal or local authorities are
included in the NCIC Wanted Persons File and because of this
they should not be duplicated in the Stop Index File. This has
been discussed with Computer Systems Division.

The purpose of this memorandum is to recommend

Stop Index of the National Crime Information Center (Ncr¢)
on a selective basis,

The Bank Robbery and Bank Burglary Suapsees Program
was instituted for the purpose of developing information on
potential bank robbers and bank burglars, The objective of
the program is to maintain such information in a current
status and to haye knowledge on a continuing basis as to the
whereabouts and activities of such individuals, This, of
courze, enables the field offices to immediately consider these
persons as suspects at the time a bank robbery or bank burglary
occurs, All offices are not required to maintain a Bank
Robbery or Bank Burglary Suspects Program. However, those
offices which have experienced problems regarding unsolved
robberies or burglaries have benefited from utilizing this ¢

We currently have a total of 1094 bank robbery and
bank burglary suspect cases in 45 of our 59 field offices, It
is believed that the field could be substantially aided in
their coverage of the suspects' activities if selected suspects
known to be travel prone were included in the Stop Index of
NCIC, Substantial investigative effort could be saved in
attempts to determine the suspects' travel and activities if
inquiry is made of the indices and field offices are sub-

NY letter, 2/11/64, enclosed atsuggestedaéttiment
prepared by the NYO which used the CP of China's recent
eriticisms of the CPSU as a base for criticisms of the CPUSA.
The NYO brought out in this document criticisms particulaiy
aimed at GUS HALL and emphasized BEN DAVIS! lack of activity in
the Negro movement. The tyranny of the leadership of GUS HALL
was set out. The NYO is in the process of anonymously mailing -
50 copies of this document to CP members and sympathizers on all

no intention of relinguisning his National leadership in

the CP, This is evidenced by his current trip to Chicago

leaders in Negro civil rights orgedivationd- tie been cooly
received. Obviously r*s Communist background is undesiraple
to the Negro civil rights movement. It is true that he has

, had contact with BAYARD) RUSTIN, but RUSTIN's leadership in

“, civil rights appears to tbe dwindling due to his past relaticns
with the CP movement and the recent publicity given to his
attending a USSR UN Delegation affair.

Additiondly, the NYO views DAVIS’ threat to resign
. aS National Secretary with skepticism. Should he follow througn
with this threat and take on a lesser responsibility, such as
in Haviem, the guest mediately comes to mind as where
would DAVIS be able publicly speak out, on whose platform,
with whose backing and, additionally, where could he obtain
a news media such as "The Worker" to publish his articles?

Obviously, if he does resign, GUS HALL will undoubtedly
look upon this act with an air of "good riddance." Thereafter,
it is inconceivable HALL would permit DAVIS, should he remain
.in the Party, to publicly speak out with the Party's plesssing
and/or support, nor would he permit articles of DAVIS! to
appear in the Party publications.

The NYO feels DAVIS possesses enough intelligence
to realize how foolhardy such an act would be, that he does nov
intend to resign, and his only interst in making such statements |
would be to gain more public recognition by HALL as a Party
functionary.

Eee

NY 2002-S*'in the past furnished several sheets or
BEN DAVIS? Téttérhead stationery. The letterhead consists
merely of the. Name "BENJAMIN J. DAVIS" and no title or address
is given. (¢

In order to creatc the appearance that BEN DAVIS is
involved in criticizing and disrupting the CPUSA, the following
Suggestion is offered for tne Bureau's consideration:



NY 100-129802

A sheet of DAVIS'stationery will be slipped in
between the pages of the document currently being anonymous
mailed by the NYO. The personselected will not be a member a
of the cadre so that it will look more accidental. The NYO ~
would hope that the appearance will be created that when
preparing on a cluttered desk the material to be mailed, the
letterhead accidentally slipped in between the sheets. Ce)

The NYO ts holding up its anonymous mailing
since DAVIS is away and this mailing will be resumed when

Memorandum to Mr, Sullivan
RE: COMMUNIST PARTY, USA
NEGRO QUESTION

100-8 MuONIST INFLUENCE IN RACIAL MATTERS CONF ETAL

Carl Bloice, correspondent for the "People's World," a west
coast communist newsnaper, who recently spent a great deal of time with
SNCC people in the f »uth, commented, according to a source, th: he
Marxist classics ar very familiar to the SNCC leadership. All

Dorothy iller, a CP member in June, 1963, was identified
aS a representatit of the SNCC in Georgia in April, 1963.

In Novem.er, 1963, Gerald Stern advised a Bureau Agent that
he has been coordinating recent SNCC activities and the SNCC headquarters
in Greenwood would always know his whereabouts, John Rosenberg has
allegedly been seen in close contact with SNCC workers and, according
to B. C, Hammond, Police Commissioner, Greenwood, a local police officer
observed Rosenberg departing a Negro hotel in the company of a Negro
female, presumed to be an SNCC worker. (It is noted that Rosenberg is
of the white race.) 7

-OBSERVATIONS :

It is evident from our investigations that Department Attorneys
l|Rosenberg and Stern are in close association with SNCC people in
Mississippi, the reasons for which are unknown to us.- We do not know if
they are operating under Departmental instructions. We believe that —
because implications inherent to this association could well prove to he
an embarrassing situation, the Department should be advised. This way
the Bureau can be on record with the Department concerning the communist
background of some of the SNCC people in the event that a future question
arises as to Department Attorneys' not knowing the type of people that
they were counseling.
nds

RECOMMENDATION: Yur

The attached lettér to the oe General and Deputy Attorney
General be hand delivered“by Assistant Director Courtney A. Evans in view
of the sensitive nature of this matter. At that time, Mr. Evans can
advise that this information was received by the Bureau during our inves-
tigations of communist influence in racial matters, civil rights and
election laws and not as a result of any Bureau investigation of Rosenberg
and Stern or of the SNCC, other than an infiltration case of the SNCC,
Mr. Evans can call the attention of the Attorney General to the possible
embarrassing Situation which exists with the association of the Depart~
mental attorneys and the SNCC.

Atlanta Office, be ordered to report to the Bureau on 12/23/63 for a
one-day conference in order to explore fully the communist influence
in racial matters as it pertains to Martin Luther King, Jr., whose head~
quarters are in Atlanta, Georgia, and to discuss avenues of approach to
exposing King's unholy alliance with the Communist Party, USA (CPUSA). y

Tho racial unrest in the United States is currently the target _
Zoxv a actorm ned concentzation of communist effort, Communists are using
every means possible to divert the course and force of the varest into
support of communist objectives. Long-range communist strategy looks
\t0 the establishment of a Negro-iabor coalition which the communists
‘hope to be able to manipulate as a powerful political action weapon.
This communist goal constitutes a serious national security problem in
light of the fact that the individual playing a most dominant role as a
leading spokesman for the estimated 20 million Negroes in this country
today, Martin Luther King, Jr., is knowingly, willingly and regularly
cooperating with and taking guidance from communists, King is using they

getting drunk and associating with women other than his wife, in
order that we may consider using this information at an opportune
time in a counterintelligence move to discredit him.

During the discussion which followed, the men from the
field outlined in detail the operation of the SCLC in Atlanta and
the manner in which it is managed by King.

Our discreet approach to this case has been necessitated
by, King's prominence and.the delicate situation which surrounds the
entire racial _ movement. A wrong move could well result in extreme
embarrassment to the Bureau, AS a result of the conference, it was
decided we need to develop additional information in the following
areas;

38) We wist determine and chook cut a S c omplorces
(i) We wast determine and chook out oll of the ompleyces

of the SCLC.
(2) We must locate and monitor the funds of the SCLC.

(3) We must identify and check out the sources who
contribute to the SCLC. ‘

nae (4) We must continue to keep close watch on King's
personal activities,

(5) . We will, at the proper time when it can be done
without embarrassment to the Bureau, expose King
as an immoral opportunist who is not a sincere
person but is exploiting the racial situation for
personal gain,

(6) We will explore the possibility of utilizing additional
specialized investigative techniques at the SCLC office.

Our technical coverage on King and the SCLC is producing
excellent information, It was decided that, in view of this fact
and since we could not engage in active investigation at this time
without embarrassment to the Bureau, we would hold in abeyance, open.
investigation as outlined above for another 90 days. During this
time, we will utilize the information obtained from our technical
Coverage and conduct whatever investigation can be made discreetly.

This conference proved to be most beneficial, and the
men from the field expressed their appreciation for the opportunity
of being brought into the Seat of Government for the purpose of
exploring this entire matter. ‘They were both enthusiastic about
the case and stated the conference was of exceptional benefit to
them and will be of assistance in setting the future course of the

We will continue to give this case priority attention
both at the Seat of Government and in the field and will expose
King for the clerical fraud and Marxist he is at the first

. INFLUENCE OF CP PEOPLE ON PARTICIPATION
7 IN MOW FROM NORTHERN NEW JERSEY

. 7 Newark files and all sources contacted reflect
that the greater portion of the participants from Northern
New Jersey in the MOW were under the sponsorship of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
’ (NAACP). The NAACP proceeded independently and was not in
any way connected with the North Jersey Coordinating
Committee for the MOW,
Lu for mn
2116-5 noted on 10/24/63 that most of the
participants from Northern New Jersey in the MOW came from -
Essex County. He stated that the NJCP exercised a minimum
of influence on participants in the MOW from Essex County;
in fact, prior to the MOW, the NJCP leaders in Essex County
were actually trying to find out what was going on in regard
Jwemacito the MOW, rather than influencing or guiding participants.
——NKW2L116-S felt that aside from participating as individuais
in the MOW, NJCP leaders and members had no influence on
participants from Essex County.

PARTY INITIATIVE IN DEMONSTRATIONS AT sesaee i
CITY HALL AND AT CONSTRUCTION SITES 7

Newark sources and files reflect no construction
site demonstrations which resulted from Party initiative.

NK 100-428477

Two CP members are reported to have participated
in a picket l-ne at the site of construction of Barringer
High School ‘1 Newark. One of the CP members, whose identity
was apparent ._y known to leaders of the picket line, was asked
to leave th picket line by an official of the Congress on
Racial Equa sity (CORE).

Io wark files and canvass of informants and sources
reflect thac one demonstration at the Newark City Hall resulted
from Party initiative. This demonstration was spmsored by
the Unemployed Council of Newark (now defunct) as a result of

awe proposals by CP members. JAMES LUSTIG arranged for. printing
gabe of leaflets calling for the demonstration and LUSTIG made
arrangements for NK 2116-S to act as the leader of the
——““fenonstration, which occurred on 5/11/63. The result was
that on 5/11/63 Newark City Hall was picketed for approximately
- one hovr by a total of approximately 35 persons. Approximately
ee ten of these persone were CP members, headed by JAMES LUSTIG.
Most ox the remainder were a group from the Labor Negro.
Vanguard Conference (LNVC) which is headed by CLARENCE COGGINS
and is opposed by the CP. Following the picketing, the
pickets conferred with a. representative of the Mayor of Newark.
. (A summary of CP participationin this demonstration appears on
page 7 of Newark letterhead memorandum submitted by airtel
to the Bureau, both dated 7/24/63, and headed, "CP, USA,
‘NEGRO QUESTION, COMMUNIST INFLUENCE IN RACIAL MATTERS; IS - c'.)

On 6/10/63, about 100 persons picketed Newark City
. Hall in a two-hour racial demonstration, The Unemployed Council
of Newark endorsed this picketing, which was sponsored by
other organizations. LUSTIG had favored and encouraged that
the UCN participate in this picketing, but it appears likely
the UCN would have participated in any case,

At Paterson, New Jersey, DANIEL and SOPHIE FITZGERALD,
both CP members, participated in a picket line at the Paterson
City Ball on 7/29/63, which was sponsored by CORE and the NAACP.
The Mayor called in these pickets, including the FITZGERALDs
and conferred with them, (This information appears in Newark
airtel and letterhead memorandum dated 7/30/63, captioned
"DEMONSTRATION AT PATERSON CITY HALL BY CORE AND NAACP; RACIAL
MATTIRS", copy of which was designated for Bureau file 100~-3-116.)

CP members have participated in other demonstrations
and activities in New Jersey concerning the racial situation.
iThe CP did not initiate these activities, but generally learned

£ these activities and then participated in them with the
obvious desire to encourage demonstrations insofar as possible.

CONCLUSIONS

It .s the conclusion of the Newark Office that
| {uusTic's sta ements to the Party's NEC meeting on 10/3/63
[ gave an exar gerated impression of the influence of the NJCP
f jin connecti n with the MOW and racial demonstrations in
» |New Jersey. LUSTIG's probable aim is to enhance his own
-f position,
i}

SOPHIE FITZGERALD, as Co-Chairman of the North
Jersey Coordinating Committee for the MOW, did play a part
in arranging rides to Washington from the Paterson, New Jersey,
area, but over all, the CP influence on participation in the
MOW from northern New Jersey was minimal,

NJCP influence on construction site demonstrations
was practically nil.

The NJCP did initiate a picketing demonstration
at Newark City Hall which lasted one hour on 5/11/63. CP
members participated in other demonstrations, but the CP
did not originate them and CP influence on these other
jdemonstrations was very limited.

Although KRANSDORF has engaged in a great deal
of talking and "preaching" regarding racial matters in
general, the plight of the Negro, and the lack’of
demonstrations in the Pittsburgh area, to CP members and
his other associates, he (and the CPWP) have had very
little influence on racial matters in the Pittsburgh
area. He and his followers are not known to have
infiltrated or gained control of any group involved in
civil rights demonstrations or any other groups working
to advance the cause of Negroes in this area,

Concerning Pittsburgh's coverage of communist
activities in the Negro field, it is noted that of the
six live informants who furnish information concerning
the CPWP, five are Negroes. In addition, two, Pyts_

(one a Negro) and another source (PG_180- SsBU5 is in
daily contact with KRANSDORF) provide coverage in this
regard. All of these live informants are cognizant of
vine Bureau's intcrest in all aspects of the current racial
situation and especially regarding any CP involvement

in any Negro movements or raci qperistrations.
~ These informants (a: O-S ave, during the past
few months, provided pertinent and timely information

| - concerning KRANSDORF's statements and ideas regarding
racial matters and are in a position to be aware of
any action he might take to directly involve CPWP members
“in such matters in the future. In addition, Pittsburgh
has five other sources in groups sponsoring integration in
ne the Western Pennsylvania area who can also furnish
. information concerning CP involvement in these matters.

It is believed that Pittsburgh's coverage of
communist activities in the Negro field in Western
Pennsylvania at the present time is very good; however,
Pittsburgh will continue to emphasize the importance of
this matter during contacts with the above informants and
will closely follow: HERBERT KRANSDORF's activities so
that appropriate investigative steps may be initiated in
the event he and the CPWP become directly involved in
racial matters in this area.

CPWVA

The CP in West Virginia is not formally
organized and consists of four to six individuals who
are considered tentative CP members because of their
past CP activities. These individuals meet irregularly
for discussions at the home of RALPH and IVA ORTH, former
CP officials, in Charleston, W. Va. There is one Negro
in the above group who does not maintain a national
level or district level position above the status of
elub chairman, The above individuals have discussed
racial matters and problems involving the Negro, bat ‘¢é
have taken part in no activity in this regard and have
exerted no influence in conrfection with racial matters
in West Virginia. ’

“Coverage of the CPWVA is provided by a live
informant (a Negro) who attends meetings of the
aforementioned individuals and by anvilics Live informant
who is in frequent contact with these individuals. A
third live informant (a Negro member of the NAACP) also
lives in West Virginia. The above informants have
furnished some general information concerning Negro matters
(not involving the CPWVA) and have been alerted to promptly
furnish any information in this regard to the Pittsburgh
f Office. It is believed that the above informants

- provide adequate coverage concerning the CPWVA at the
present time and are in a position to report any attempts
of the CP to influence racial matters in West Virginia.

CP, OHIO VALLEY SECTION, OHIO DISTRICT

This section encompasses the four panhandle

counties of West Virginia in the vicinity of Wheeling,

W. Va., and is a part of the Ohio. District which maintains
. “headquarters at Cleveland, Ohio. There are two identified

CP members and one tentatively identified member 1 his

section (all white) under the leadership of GEN HN

of Wheeling. KUHN has shown some interest in ra¢ial

matters and formerly was co-chairman of a youth group in

the Wheeling chapter of the NAACP. She was suspended

PG 100-14992

from NAACP membership in early October, 1963,

reportedly because of publicity regarding her affiliation
with the CP. KUHN recently was involved in a racial
demonstratic . at a segregated roller skating rink in |
Wheeling an’ reportedly is currently connected with an
effort to c ganize chapters of the Congress of Racial
Equality (/ ORE) in the Wheeling area.

overage of GENNE KUHN and all aspects of her
activities is provided by two live informants of the
Cincinnati Division, who are in frequent contact with
her. In addition, three sources (one within the ¢
Cincinnati Division) who are connected with NAACP activities,
have furnished valuable information concerning KUHN's involve-
ment in racial matters. A PCI of the Pittsburgh Division
has also furnished some information in this regard.

It is believed that Pittsburgh has very good
" ~coverase-of KUHN's activities at the nresent time and that
any attempts by KUHN to exert her influence in racial
matters or to direct communist infiltration of groups
involved in Negro matters will be promptly reported to

mas

this office.

I thought you would be interested in a resume of pertinent
data concerning captioned matter, with particular reference to the
communist influence on the 8/28/63 March on Washington, First, as to
communist "participation," you will recall that at the 10/1-6/63 meet=
ing of the National Executive Committee of the Party, Gus Hall stated
that an estimated 5,000 communists participated in the March in one
way or another, As to the number of Party members (here we are differ-
entlating between communists and Party members), the following analysis
has been mace from reports received from the field, For the purpose of
making this estimate, we considered as current Communist Fariy (cP)
members any individuals who have been reported to be members of the
Party since 1/1/62, The estimate, based upon our field reports, is
as follows. 7

A total of 125 CP members from the territories covered by

Washington, D, C,, 8/28/63, The New York Office reported a total of_e7 |
37, The total for all offices, therefore, is 162,

We also had reported to us that an additional 67 Party mem-
bers were-observed boarding transportation media in the New York City
area destined for Washington on 8/28/63, While it cannot be positively
stated that these 67 were actually observed in Washington, D, C., it
would be a fairly logical assumption that they did come to Washington,
barring such unusual circumstances as a breakdown of a bus or buses or
any of the chartered trains, We had no reports of such happenings.
Therefore, if we were to,add these 67 to the other 162, we could, with
justified logic, estimate that approximately 229 Party members were in
Washington, D. C,, on 5.

membership (acc rding to the standards set out above) was not estab

ReBuairtel 11/18/63 which raised certain questions
concerning your coverage o£ events pertaining to captioned

items questioned by the Bureau related to the presence of
Davis the evening of 11/6/63 at the New Bethel Baptist Cuurch, .

Debro’ é,

Attention is directed to the 11/10/63 issue of

“fhe Worker ,'' which contains an article written by William ,
Allan, headed "Rev. King Backs Detroit Conference," This
article, on page 1, written at Detroit, states that a
Northern Negro Leadership Conference was to meet in Detroit

_ 11/8410/63 and heading the meeting was to be Reverend C. L.
Feanklin of the New Bethel Baptist Church, A continuation
of the article, on page 11, states that Reverend King (in
ebvious reference to Martin Luther King) had recently visited
Detroit and met with Reverend Franklin and Negro leaders on
plans for a Detroit conference,

The article described above underscores vividly one
facet of the Party! 8S attemots to exert influence in racial
natters, for we here have a situation wherein one of the
ton leaders of the Negro movement today, King, recently met
with Reverend ¥rankiin of the New Bethel Bantist Church and

Administration to give a strong bill, fighting support.

The foresoing ties in with other information
this Bureau obtained indicating that Levison and Jones
nay well have prepared the Hing speech of October 23,
1053. The aboveenentioned source advised on October 16,
Loc3, that King was in contact with Jones relative to
Eing's speech scheduled for October 23, 1933, at which
time King requested Jones to get some material together
with their mutual friend. This Bureau has learned
fxvom many references made by King and Jones to "mutual
friend" that their reference is to Levison. dones told
Ring that "they" vould work on the matter on the weexend.
Special Agents of this Eureau observed Jones entering
Leviscn's residence in New York City at 10:69 a.m. on
Saturday, October 19, 1903. Jones was observed departing
from Lovicou'’s vsSlideuce ui S755 peome, THAT GATS.

Specizically as to the civil rights Legislation
aspects of the speech, the aboveementioned source advised
that on October 22, 1963, King's secretary was in contact
with Jones and stated that the speech had been received
and that she had read it to King. She stated that Eing

7 A highly sensitive and ano eevee tnvestigative technique
concerning Levison was used by our New York Office on 10/19/63 and
10/21/63 but prov d negative.

OBSERVATIONS:

While we would expect King to discuss civil rights legis-
lation in hi current speeches, the fact that he sought advice
from Jones a to what position he should take on such legislation
lends strong support to the fact that King still receives advice
from Levison, It is probably no coincidence that the line taken
by King in his speech follows the current Party line relative to

.civil rights Legislation.

In the film HALL dwells on the point that the CP

is involved in the Negro movements and will henceforth
increase their activity in this field. As far as we know this
is the first time that a CP official has made such statements,
publicly. HALL's statement served to alert tens of thousands
of Negroes and their leaders of the CP's objective to work in
their movements which can only mean the exploitation of their
difficulties.

It has been our experience in Chicago that to a
Negro, no one is more despicable than one who attempts to
exploit him for personal or political gain. Negroes are very
deeply suspicious of a member of the white race, as in the
case of HALL, who makes claims of devotion and dedication to
the cause of Negro freedom.

HAIL and the CP have alreadv been rebuffed by leaders
of CORE and the NAACP as evidenced by the proceedings of a
press conference held by JAMES JACKSON at the Hamilton Hotel,
Chicago, on February 26, 1964. ,

MARTY O'CONNER, a reporter for "Chicago's American,"
reported that at the conclusion of the press conference of
JAMES JACKSON, an official of the Chicago Chapter, NAACP, who
was present, loudly demanded a press conference to answer
JACKSON who, like HALL, had stated the CP would become involved
in the Negro freedom movements. This NAACP official disavowed
any connection between the NAACP and the CP. He said the NAACP
did not want the support of the Party in its fight for Negro
equality, and forther, that a number of years ago the NAACP had
expelled the communists from the organization. He pledged that
his organization would continue to fight for Negro rights
without the assistance of the CP.

: It is also. reported in the February 27, 1964, issue
of the "Chicago Sun-Times" that JACKSON had stated that the CP
would support a "work-stoppage" proposed by Negro groups. The
newspaper noted that it had questioned Chicago area civil rights
groups who stated they had not heard of a work stoppage proposal
and would not support such a move..

‘The article further noted the communists said they
had invited representatives of all civil rights groups to the
press conference but only one appeared and he used the _

opportunity to denounce the communists. He was described
as SIDNEY FINLEY, a regional field secretary for the NAACP,
who accused the communists of "trying to force their way
into the civil rights movement."

It is obvious that this counterintelligence move
forced the CP to make a public announcement of their objectives
regarding the civil rights movement, and they have already
been rebuffed by the leaders of the movement.

A portion of the enclosed film was shown on a
Chicago telecast on the evening of February 21, 1964, and on
the following day two newspapers reported the gist of the
conference. Significant results of this counterintelligence
operation a Sd, 1) It alerted the general public and especially
the Negro "eerie in Chicago to the designs of the CP in the —
urrent racial difficulties, perhaps the number “one dowes tic
issue in the Uvn, voday. 2) It alert
responsible Negro organization

sible Negro leadership who :
may be influenced by CP leaders or other, ra deals. (3) the UP
newspaper article was most embarrassing* GHTFOOT and to

the national Party leaders who were gathered in Chicago for
important week-end meetings. It would appear that LIGHTFOOT
.Will have difficulty in refuting the charges contained in the
article among the rank-and~file members. There -is much more
truth than fiction in the article and it is obvious hanahl it
gave LIGHTFOOT great pain.

7 This film is being forwarded to the Bureau because
it may be beneficial to the Bureau, particularly for In-
Service training purposes. The film may be useful for the
following purposes:

1. It depicts an excellent example of the impact
ofa counterintelligence operation on the leadership of the

2. It shows the skill employed by GUS HALL in this
news conference, his ability to "thrust ani parry" with the

press and his ability to.evade and skirt direct questions. va

“3. It depicts LIGHTFOOT's attempt to twist the press
attack on him into an attack on the Negro race. (We doubt

-3-



NW 68262 Docld:32989648 Page 568

CG 100-32864

that LIGHTFOOT convinced many people on this point, but it
shows his skill at propaganda.)

4. In considering points 2 and 3 above, the Bureau
may wish to consider future counterintelligence moves which
may give the CP opportunity to stage a counterattack by
employing their skills in the art of propaganda and turn a
counterintelligence move to their own advantage. While this
was not the case in this instance, it could possibly eepret
in future counterintelligence moves.

RECOMMENDATION

‘The Bureau may desire to produce a copy of the
enclosed film for training purposes.

This film should be returned to Chicago as soon as

possible since I obtained this film on loan from Mr. CON O'DEA.

an anonymous source; however, it,4S noted“that on one occasion

y It is further noted there are approximately 40 employees at

Office, whose hours of employment are most irregular, and
include weekends on occasions. It is considered fhat a

/ physical surveillance of all employees of Southern Christian

/ Leadership Conference for such an anonymous source development

} could not be conducted with sufficient discreetness to insure
the success of this type operation. It is further noted that
the building which houses the offices of Southern Christian
Leadership Conference is also occupied by a Negro Radio
Station ch has most irregular nours ror its employees.
Another portion of the building is occupied and utilized for
Lodge purposes and there is considerable traffic in and out
of the building at unusual or irregular hours. This office

, Space is located in an exclusively Negro neighborhood for }
approximately one mile in radius except for the downtown j

: business district.

From the above the security problems are obvious;
“however, there is room to explore this further and our investi-

of statements made by WILKINS in regard to the Civil Rights
Bill presently in Congress. KING indicated he was tired of
WILKINS making these statements which in effect carried KING's
concurrence when in fact KING had not been consulted.

It is regommended that both the New York and Atlante
Office remain particularly alert for any further indications of
a rift possibly developing between WILKINS and KING so that
full utilization may be made of this incident.

If information is developed confirming such a disagree~
ment a possible course of action may include the use of RALPH
McGILL, Publisher of the "Atlanta Constitution" in order to
.explore the basis of such disagreement and also to feed pertinent

. , Subversive connections and dealings of KING to WIZKINS. It is
/ unknown to Atlanta whether McGILL is personally acquainted with
i | WILKINS but it is known that McGILL has been most cooperative
i : with the Atlanta Office of the FBI and the Bureau and if he
, is acquainted with WILKINS, this could be considered. |

It ics further suggested the Bureau, throush its
respective auxiliary offices, may desire to discreetly
furnish information to reliable news individuals who could
report by story and photograph items which would show KING's
G . high living and exorbitant spending. In this regard, it

: is noted that since February, KING has been in San Juan, Puerto

Rico, Hawaii, Los Angeles, residing in the Hyatt House at
7 $75 per day and again in Nassau, BWI, under an assumed name.

While it is realized that certain newspaper publicity might be
favorable to KING it is believed that certain articles reporting |
this high living would have a distinct advantage of causing . {
many Negro supporters of the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference to lose faith in this organization, its leader
and their endeavors and hence discontinue their support through |
the contribution of funds. It is realized that the bulk of |
the financial support comes from the white community but Negroes
provide the numerical majority and support for demonstrations
in the street. .

Conference as it relates to the employment of HUNTER PITTS... p27

who Have within their rank subversive sympathizers, Other
articles authored by SHIPP have related to the delay in the
reconstruction of these destroyed churches and he has also
peen eritical of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference
‘for its failure to make public records as to its financial affairs.
7 : 7 It is noted that funds, for the reconstraction of three
Negro churches in the Albany area, were obtained through public
; solicitations initiated by the "Atlanta Constitution" and other
organizations in Atlanta. The SCLC also solicited funds for this
project and in so doing used the volunteer services of JACKTD
“ROBINSON to collect approximately $65 , 000 throughout the U.S.
ae SCLC in turn was in enarge of tie funds collected for this pro-
Bate -~ ‘ject and responsible for the disbursing of these funds to the
“-“ . contractors building the churches, It is further pointed out
that the delay in the reconstruction of these churches has been
.primarily a result of the contractor not receiving funds from
“Southern Christian Leadership Conference on a periodic basis
for the completion of these churches, It is suggested that the
‘Bureau may Gesire to furnish to SHIPP on an anonymous basis,
‘certain specific leads where he may develop the necessary data
so that he may further write critical news stories which would be
based on information obtained by him rather than by this agency.
An example of this type of information would include furnishing
the name and address of a Catholic priest from South Alabama,
whose name is unknown to the Atlanta Office but possibly known
to the Mobile Office, who after several years affiliation with
the Southern Christian Leadership Conference publically
denounced this organization based on his experiences and know-
«ledge of their financial dealings. This priest attributed to an
' SCLC Official a statement that they needed to have a demonstration
in order to raise money. This was just prior to a large scale
demonstration held in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1963.

It is ‘to. be noted” at Atlanta. sources have disclcset—~
recently that RUTHXBAILEY, an employee of the New York office
of SCLC, was discharged. She contacted an employee of the
: Atlanta Office of SCIC and showed her displeasure because
a her discharge date was prior to the notification date. In
showing this displeasure she brought out that STANLEY L&VISON
was in someway undesirable and that KING had been warned
by unknown individuals about associating with him. Sources
advised, however, that upon reconsideration SCLC retained
services of BAILEY. Atlanta suggests this matter be follo
closely both in New York and in Atlanta and if the opportu:
presents itself to exploit BAILEY's discontent. At this tin
however, it is felt that because BAILEY was rehired that the
‘time for appraising her should be delayed.

Sources further reported a certain trend of dis-
v7’ content and dissatisfaction on the part of employees in
. the Atlanta Office of SCLC based over preferential pay to
individuals performing the same duties. This discontent
has been temporarily alleviated by recent pay increases made

E. Financial Dealings of KING and the Southern Christe
Leadersnip Conference

Analysis of recently received tax returns through :
1962 and Internal Revenue Service investigation of KING and {
_. the Southern Christian Leadership Conference for the years
1957, 1958 and 1959, reflects that the main question of
contention was the status of money received by Southern Christ
.Leadershin Conference. KING's contention was that these rec
were gifts, while Internal Revenue contends that income from
business operations, namely SCLC, was in. reality income.

wary

Atlanta sources have recently reported that the

« Atlanta Retail Credit Company was furnished details to the
effect that SCLC had received $750,000 during 1963.
Sources have also advised that one "WILLIE" RICHARDSON,
‘Internal Revenue Service employee, was making a current incone
: investigation regarding the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference or one of their employees. Sources at Internal
Revenue Service report that WILLIE RICHARDSON is the only
Negro Internal Revenue Agent of the Atlanta Regional Office
and has been so employed for approximately one year.

ey eee ee

It is pointed out that KING has authored several
books and it is believed that funds received from this author-
ship are the funds most difficult to report as gifts as KING's

* ‘contention has been’ in the past, rather than as income.

From the return it is apparent that SCLC is
classified as a tax-exempt organization; however, contributions
to it are not allowable by the donor as a tax deductible
contribution to a charity organkation. SCLC is considered

~6-

—HNW.68262_Docld:32989648 Page 577 . 4



AY 100-6520-D
AFM: elt

a tax-exempt civil organization. It is noted that in order
to obtain this tax~exempt status, a petition must be filed
by the organization with Internal Revenue Service, a copy
of the organization's charter, By Laws, financial statements
and a list of sizeable contributors to this organization is

also filed.
-

It is suggested that the Buredu may desire to
obtain through liaison further data available regarding
SCLC and the basis of any current investigation being conducted
- on MARTIN LUTHER KING, dR., or SCLC. id :
It is felt the list of contributors of sizeable
gifts to SCLC may be important as with future information it
may be possible to compare whether KING is recording all
of his contributions as gifts or whether in facts there
is a discrepancy in tne amount Gunaicd vo SOLO aiid onc
amount KING reports as gifts. If such a discrepancy does
exist it is likely KING is utilizing these funds for his
own personal affairs. :

. It is believed that through various past incidents
as reported by Atlanta sources a trend can be established

,%o show collusion on the part of donors who are making

-- contribution to SCLC by various and devious means. Points
‘in contention in this regard relate to a sizeable contribution
of funds collected at a benefit held in California by SAMMY
\DAVIS, JR., the entertainer. It was proposed that these funds
be made payable to a church in California. These funds were
then forwarded by the church in California to Ebenezer Baptist
Church, Atlanta, and thence to Scle, or MARTIN LUTHER KING,

fee oR. personally.

7 Another point in contention relates to the recent
‘ girt by ,an unknown automobile dealer through a Reverend
RICHARD-PATTLES, Hartford, Connecticut, who contributed 12
automobiles to the SCLC for their usé. Atlanta sources
reported that this dealer was interested in establishing
a capital loss in his business operations and was utilizing
the gift of the vehicles in so doing. In order to establish

this capital loss and as well claim a contribution, the
vehicles were actually given to the West Hunter Baptist
Church, the Ebenezer Baptist Church and to the United Church
of Christ, Decatur, Georgia, all of which vehicles were to
be made available to the SCLC.

It is further pdnted out that Atlanta sources
advised that SCLC is currently short on.funds and is
known to owe Darby Printing Company, Atlanta, approximately
$12,000.
ia It is believed that donors and ereditors of. SCLC
present two important areas for counter-intelligence activities.
In regard to the donors it is suggested that official SCLC
stationery bearing KING's signature, copies of which are availaie
to the Atlanta Office and will be furnished by separate communi-
, cation to the Bureau Laboratory for reproduction purposes,
be. utilized in advising the donors that Interna: nevenue
Service is currently checking tax records of SCLC and that
KING through this phoney correspondence wants to advise the
donor insuring that he reported his gifts in accordance with
. internal Revenue requirements so that he will not become
* involved in a tax investigation, It is believed such a letter
of this type from SCLC may cause considerable concern and
|. ‘eliminate future contributions. From available information
“it is apparent that many of these contributors to SCLC are
doing so in order to claim tax deductions and in order to be
eligible for such deductions, the contribution is being made to
the Ebenezer Baptist Church, which in turn is forwarded to
KING or the Southern Christian Leadership Conference,

It is also proposed that pretext calls be placed
to Darby Printing Companys impressing upon them the financial
plight of SCLC so that they may be incited into collection

+ $12,600, of the printing bill owed to them in the amount of
12,000

It is further suggested that investigative efforts
be made in auxiliary offices to determine method used by

LEVISON has been instrumental in setting policy in the SCLC, a
He normally meets with KING each time he visits the New York Tat
area, and has made trips to Atlanta to consult on matters.

As of July, 1963, LEVISON was a secret member of the
CPUSA. In late 1963 and early 1964, he criticized the CP for .,
not being sufficiently militant in the civil rights struggle. ~
LEVISON was described by certain CP leaders as being to the
"left" of the CP in his position on civil rights, and because :
of these differerices with CP leaders, LEVISON is not now under -.
CP discipline in the civil rights Pield. There. has been no
indication, however, that LEVISON does not continue his
ideological adherence to Communism.

Following LEVISON's criticism of the Party, BEN DAVIS

BAYARD) RUSTEN, “the Teader he March” on Washington,
the New York City Séhool Boycott and the March on Albany, New York,
has been seriously considered for the position of Northern

Coordinator for the SCLC, However, this seems to be somewhat :

in doubt at this time, because RUSTIN prefers to operate in an :
independent capacity, and due to’ the reluctance of KING to appoint "
him at this time. i :

Recently, indications were that RUSTIN was setting up q
the A. Phillip kRandol; oh Institute, whose purpose will be to deal |

It is not believed that RUSTIN is going to accept the 4

KING and other SCLC leaders. Furthermore, there has not been

BENJAMIN J. DAVIS. He asked DAVIS! advice as to how he could
escape from speaking at a rally sponsored by the Emergency oe
Committees for Disaster’ Relief to Cuba. Although RUSTIN tontacted ;
DAVIS, it is not believed that he is in contact with other CP
leaders, or that he is sympathetic to the CP cause. To
substantiate this, RUSTIN as late as April 9, 1964, after
addressing a meeting of the National Council of the Fellowship
of Reconciliation, Nyack, New York, said he was opposed to the |

I note that this theme still predominztes in your memorandum,
particularly in the six numbered points on Fayes land 2, with respect to
these six points, let me reiterate what I told ycu lest Friday:

(1.) Regarding items 1 and 2 concerning the estent of communist ;
i infiltrat in the civil richts movement, you indicate that Mr. Fooverts
" answer “blanketed all Nesroos."' As I resestediy pointed out to you, ©
{ Myr. Hoover's opening sentence is, “Let melirst emphasize that I
realize thet the va voes hese rejected and r:
communism for what it is." Ifurther empimsizedtat, in a
Stanley Lavison and ilunter O'Dell, there arza numberof
white coremuni, and persons under commuisi influence
active part in the civil ig movement. Kgtonly did I name several
of these pergons to you, but J also aivised ya that this information
about them had been furnished to the Devartnent of Justice and was
séany availabic tc you, You will veenll acnitting thet vou were not
conversant with this material.

(2.) Regarding item 3, I feel that you still nisa the point, gince the
. very militancy of the grouns active in this mayvement is the ingredient
which communista and others advocating vioimce seck to exploit.

4

(3.) Regarding item 4, these additional word: were incorporated in
the final statement by Mr. Hoover, which youapproved and which was
given to Mr. Vandenberg.

(4.) Regarding items 5 and 6, your misundesstanding of the purpose
and objective of Mr. Hoover's reply clearly -nanifesis itself in these
two points. item 6 suggests that your sole coisideration in reviewing
Mr. Hoover's statement was the impact it pasibly might have ca the
pending civil rights legislation. ef
As Ingsector Wick and I told you, lin. Hoover's short factual
answers to these questions were intended to bring syecific facts before the public.
His views concerning the need to protect and exhanesthe rights of all citizens
have been reiterated time and again over the years:md, in fact, have been
clearly expressed in major speeches by Mr. Heoverwhich you personally have
read and approved. Your memorandum makes it char to me that your entire

Mr. Sdwin O, Guthman

: objection to Mr, Hoover's answers to Mr, Vandenberg's questions was that
: publication might he detrimental to the civil rights cause. Actually, the greater
Ganger lies in a failure to recd=nigze and challenge the communists and other
spokesmen for violence who attempt to capitalize on the militancy of the sincere
advocates of equal rights.

Tam enclosing a copy of (1) the original answer as prepared by
My, Hoover and (2) the revised version which was approved by you. Certainly,
the fact that our diseussion resulted in agreement is evidence that no "stand

Question: You have been quoted as saying there are communists in the

civil rights movement. Are these men in positions leadership? How

much influence do they nave on the civil rights movement?

Answer: Let me first emphasize that I realize that the vast raajority of
Negroes have rejected and recognized communism for what it is. However,
the infiltration, exploitation, and control of the Negro population for many
years has been one of the top goals of the Communist Party, USA. Communist
interest is not based on such noble ideals as iraproving the status or condition

of tha Negro in this country. Hs purpose, pure and simple, is the ultimate

annas advanegmant of eammiuniat ablantivaa of daminatinn control and aonanact
advancement of communist abiantivaa of dom: in control and sonanact

of al it touches.
- A special target of the Communist Party among the Negroes
is the exploitation of the militant forces of the Negro civil rights movement.
“this exploitation is carried out through active members of the Coramunist
Party and individuals who are under communist influence and control.
The existence and importance of the communist influence in
the Negro reverent cannot be ignored or minimized. Tha Communist Party
¥ will use its forces eithey in the open forum of public opinion or tino ugh its
aympathizers ia do not wear the badge of communism but who spout some
of the same ideas carried in the Communist Party line. This is the influence

which is capable of moving large masses of loyal and dedicated citizens toward

“AL communist objectives while being lured away from the true issues involved.

to: The File Sree pate: May 8, 196

FROM : Edwin Guthman, Special Assistant for Public Information

SUBJECT:

for clearance answers to two sets of questions submitted to Mr. Ho:
by the Associated Press and United Press International.

I made several suggestions end raised a serious question
about Mr. Hoover's answer to the UPI question: “You heve been quoved
; a8 saying there are communists in the civil rights movement. re
/ these men in positions of leadership? How much influence do they
{ have on the civil rights movement?"

I based my objection on the total impact. of Mr. Hoover's
answer which, in my opinion, put communist influence in the civil
rightS movement out of perspective. I made the following points in
talking with Bob Wick:

1. The answers blanketed all Negroes without making the
point that most of-the communists in the Negro move~
ment are white. I said the only important white
communist that I knew was Stanley Levinson who
advises Martin Luther King, and that almost all the
others are on the fringes of the Negro organization.

2. Negro communists in the civil rights movement did
not hold positions of leadership. I said I mow
only of O'Dell and that he appeared to have been
moved out.

3. Negroes are so militant over the denial of their
vights that communist influence is not needed to

gee i foment the demonstrations--they are occurring out

- of Negro resentment and not because of commmist
infiltration. :

4, I referred to the line in Mr. Hoover's answer which
said "the existence and importance of the communist
influence in the Negro movement cannot be ignored
or minimized"; and suggested that the phrase “also
should not be exaggerated" should be added.

Se The enswer as @ Weole was totally negative and :
I contended that if a statement like that were made,
it was also necessary to,point out that the way to

: ia erie teen ee g



ages @ =
2 i
stop the communists from gaining strength in the

civil rights movement is to make progress toward
eliminating discrimination.

6. I felt strongly thet Mr. Hoover's answer would have
a very adverse effect on the eivil rights bill.

.

Wick strongly supported Mr. Hoover's statement and after
discussing the matter briefly, I said that I could not clear this
statement because of the adverse effect it would have on the civil
rights bill. I said unless it were changed, it should go to the
White House for clearance. Wick left the office about 7:00 p.m.

: This forenoon, Deke DeLoach and Bob Wick returned with the
statement and DeLoach informed me that Mr. Hoover was bbe fast;
that He felt the statement was accurate and the truth; and ‘that it
should be: published.

I repeated my position.

DeLoach read the first paragraph of the statement end asked
me if there was anything in there that was not true. 4 said theve wana’ be
t He read the second paragraph which said that the Negroes are a prime
commmist target and that active members of the Commmist Party and
; individuals who are under ccamunist influence are influencing * the civil
« rights movement.

. Mertin Luther King's association with Levinson and other
, incidents of commmist penetration were discussed. DeLoach said thet
. the commmists, through Martin Luther King, had a strong voice in the
- civil rights movement and that because King occupied a position of top
leadership, the paragraph was correct.

I said that standing alone this paragraph ascribed too much
power and influence to the communists; that some qualification was
needed indicating: thet while the commmists had made some penetration,

. they had also had many feilures and that the communists always tried
[ to capitalize on social turmoil.

We discussed this and talked about possible changes. We
could not come to an agreement and passed on to the third paregraph.

‘t suggested that the phrase "nor should it be exaggerated”
“be added to the first sentence. DeLoach agreed. He read the rest
of the paragraph and we discussed it. He said it was accurate as it
stood and was an important part of the answer. I felt it did not tell

NW 68262 Docld:32989648-Page-601



i" Paanas -3-

e
the whole story and Ghat + some language was needed to Indicate that:
(1) it was up to civil rights organizations to recognize the communist
problem and face up to it; and (2) that coummist efforts to infiltrate
the civil rights movement should not distract us from the fact that
discrimination exists, and that particularly the white majority mist
take action to end discrimination.

DeLoach was ‘agreeable to point one but not to point two,
and we discussed thet for a considerable period of time. DeLoach
said that Mr. Hoover could not "philosophize"; that he was the head of
an investigative agency and could only tell what the investigations
would show. I said that Mr. Hoover's position was such in the country
that he was not just an ordinary Bureau head; that his word on this
subject was gospel with millions of Americans.
1
I said that the Savi xvignts problem was a diffeypnt problen
nuns “than had ever faced this country before and that it was extremely
/ important ‘thet men in Mr. Hoover's position give leadership. I also
,/ said that any statement which would adversely affect President Jcnnson's
position on the civil rights bil would be a disservice to the President
and to the country.

“ DeLoach disagreed that the st atenent would adversely affect
the bill. Daring the long discussion over this point, DeLoach said that
.Perhaps the best thing to do was simply to wit hdrew the statement if we
wanted to "suppress" it. I said that he knew I was not trying to sw

,onything; that what I was trying to do was to get a statement on com
infiltration in the civil rights movement that was exactly in perspectiv:

3.
Ss
e

sw

DeLoach repeatedly reminded me that Mr. Hoover's statement was
“the truth and that Mr. Hoover's position was highly respected in the
United States because he always told the truth.

I said at least once that I felt Mr. Hoover's answer as submitted
to me distorted the extent of communist influence in-the civil rights
movement-~a statement which DeLoach todsissue with strongly.

We went back to the second paragraph and after further discussicz,
I typed out the languege as it now appears, and DeLoach accepted iv.
« ‘He said he felt that my changes had watered down the statement because it
» was talking about the future and the past, and not about the present.

I didn't quite understand this point but said if he was: not--
satisfied with it this way, that I would be glad to see that the originel
statement was sent to the White House, and if President Johnson wished to
clear it, I would accept that decision.

DeLoach asked me if I would take it to Walter Jenkins. I seid
that I would not; that my dealings in the White House were with George

| :

Reedy and Bill Moyers. He said that he could take the statement over
to Walter Jenkins, but that he thought the thing for us to do was to
sit down and resolve our differences which we had done to a large
extent.

T made one more appeal for one line at the end which would
say something to the effect that we should not let the commmist
threat divert us from the fact that discrimination exists and must
be eliminated. But DeLoach was adamant that Mr. Hoover would never
say that because it would be “sermonizing" and “philosophizing."

i DeLoach said that the statement as it was finally drafted
was weaker than Mr. Hoover's statement before the House Appropriations _
Subcommittee. He also saidthat Mr. Hoover was the only person who
was alerting the country to the communist danger in the civit rights
movenerit » : : .

. cauitt Historically the Communist Party, USA, has regarded

Negroes as a primary target group for agitation, infiltration,
yand recruitment. Negroes have been subjected constantly to
fintensive and extensive communist propaganda. The Communist

area. William Epton, national vice chairman of this organiza-
tion and a former member of the Communist Party, organized and
led young Negroes in fighting the police during the riot. In
an inflammatory street speech he warned "...we are going to

terete to kill a lot of these cops, a lot of these judges and we
will have to go up against the Army..." His activities in
fomenting and adding to the disorder led to his arrest and
subsequent conviction on charges of criminal anarchy. The
Communist Party, USA, of course, and other communist-type

{[oreanizations had a propaganda field day.

In addition, on July 19, 1964, Jesse Gray, a former
organizer of the Harlem region of the Communist Patty, called
for one hundred single revolutionaries who were ready to die
to correct what he'termed the police brutality situation in

}) Harlem.
PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA it t

Following an attempted arrest of a Negro woman in
predominantly Negro neighborhood in Philadelphia,

Pennsylvania, on August 28, 1964, Abyssimia Hayes, a well~
known Negro agitator, leader of a small black nationalist
group and former member of the Nation of Islam which preaches
hatred against the whites, mounted the porch of a house urging
the people who had gathered at the scene tio violence against
police officers and thereafter the crowd hegan attacking police
and throwing stones and bricks at passing cars. The following
two days saw riotous conditions in the area. During the course
of the riots, members of the Communist Party, USA, were
observed distributing numerous copies of ‘The Worker," the H
East Coast communist newspaper, in the riwt area. Hayes was i
arrested by the Philadelphia police and among other things
charged with inciting to riot. A subsequeat Search of his

home revealed knives, an automatic pistol, fifty gallons of
flammable liquid — a setateereetoenet of communist-Marxist literature.

. LOS ANGELES F

Communists were quick to exploit the Watts area
riot in Los Angeles, August 11-15, 1965. On August 14, 1965,
members of the W. E. B. DuBois Clubs, a communist youth t
organization, and the Socialist Workers Party, a communist
Trotskyite organization, staged a demonsimation at the police
administration building and on August 16, 1965, the DuBois

Club members circulated leaflets calling for expulsion of

the Los Angeles Chief of Police. Communist Party members

prepared articles for a communist publication written in

an effort to place blame for the riot on local authorities.

The leader of another procommunist China communist splinter

group stated in October, 1965, that his group had spent over

two years carrying on agitation against the police in the

Watts area. He added that his group was engaged in the

formation and development of units and squads to fight against

“police brutality" and "United States imperialism" which could,

in the future, provide the basis for "liberation armies," .

i During the riot which erupted in the watts area in
Los Angeles on March 15, 1966, the Southside Defense Committee,

protesting alleged police brutality in connection with the
arrest of four members of the W. E. B. DuBois Clubs who were

in the riot area. *

A disturbance which occurred in the Watts area of
Los Angeles on May 17, 1966, is directly attributed t6 actions
of the communists who organized the raliy at: the Will Rogers
Park in the Watts area to protest the killing of a Negro,
Leonard Deadwyler. An inflammatory handbill announcing the
rally was prepared by a Communist Party member and following
the rally approximately five hundred individuals led by a
paid organizer of the W. E. B, DuBois Club who was driving
an automobile equipped with loud-speakers proceeded to the
77th Street Division of the Los Angeles Police Department
where they staged a boisterous picketing demonstration. A

a liquor store window was broken and losted; bottles and bricks
were hurled at passing cars. An inquest into the death of
Deadwyler on May 19, 1966, was disrupted to such an extent by
unruly spectators that ait had to be recessed. The Progressive

: news vehicle was attacked and one occupant seriously wounded,

got into the act during the inquest by distributing a leaflet
captioned "Wanted for the Murder of Leonard Deadwyler, Bova,

a Cop." At the courthouse while £he inquest was in progress,
‘the Communist Party circulated a petition calling for indict-
ment of the officer involved in the shooting.

CLEVELAND

In connection with riots which began in the Hough
area of Cleveland, Ohio, on the night of July 18, 1966, a
Cuyahoga Grand Jury’ reported that "The outbreak of lawlessness
and disorder was both organized, precipitated and exploited
by a relatively small group of trained and disciplined
professionals of this business. They were aided and abetted
{willingly or otherwise by misguided people of all ages and

/ colors, many of whom are avowed believers in violence and
extremists and some of whom are also either members of or
officers in the Communist Party."

id A prior disturbance had begun on the night of
* June 22, 1966, in,the vicinity of the JFE House, a private
7, community center in Cleveland,which continued nightly througa
June 25, 1966, The Bureau sources, as well as sources of the
Cleveland Police Department, agree that the June disturbance
was organized by leaders and members of the JFK House and #a
“| [OFK youths were primarily involvea, ‘The tives priacipal lenders
of the JFK House have been affiliated with the Revolutionary
Action Movement, an all-Negro black natioaalist proconmunist
China organization, whose nominal leader is Robert F. Williazs,
a fugitive from justice now residing in Gemmunist China. In
addition to their involvement in the June disturbance, the
\grand jury reported that these leaders caused two thousand
pieces of literature to be printed and circulated citing
alleged incidents of "police brutality" on the eve of the
Hough area riots in July. The greatest mmber of these were
circulated to youths of non-voting age umler the guise of urging
the defeat of a levy at the polis, and while not instigating
the July riots, the JFK House people did exploit the Hough area

Wduring ¢ the course of the riots.

=

: According to a police undercover agent, a member of

the Communist Party in Cleveland, contact was made with
Lewis G. Robinson, the head of the JFK House by a member of
the Communist Party, and offered Communist Party support.
This was done at the instructions of the District Organizer of
the Communist Party in Cleveland. In adiition, Robinson is
‘known to have attended public functions af the Socialist
Workers Party in Cleveland in 1965 and 1966 and, in fact,

| was among those arrested by the Clevelan® Police Department in

| November, 1965, during a disturbance at a Socialist Workers

Party-sponsored public function. Robinson's wife visited
Cuba in 1961 and, in fact, was employed by the Ministry of
education while in Cuba. She traveled without State Depart-
ment permission. ' She has also attended Socialist Workers
Party public functions. Communist contacts with Robinson
occurred prior to the July 18 riot with the last contact
being July 14, 1966.

During the course of the Hough area riots, four
members of the W. E. B. DuBois Club were arrested in the
viot area with a considerable amount of communist literature
in $he car. In this connection it is noted that; the DuBois
Club headquarters had been set up in the Hough area of Cleveland.

“CHICAGO

During a disturbance in Chicago in August, 1965,
leaflets containing inflammatory statements were distributed
in the troubled arasa hy members of Sparticist, a Trotskyite
organization, composed” of former members of the Socialist
Workers Party. The leaflets compared the riot situation in
Chicago to Vietnam and Santo Domingo.

4

.

During the course of the Chicago riot which began
July 12, 1966, Douglas Andrews , the leader of a civil rights
organization and also a former member of the Revolutionary
Action Movement, together with twelve other members of the
civil rights organization, were arrested by the Chicago Police
Department following receipt of information that they were
preparing Molotov cocktails for use later in the riot area,
DETROIT .

In Detroit on August 9, 1966, a riotous situation
developed following an attempt by police to arrest three
Negroes. The same night, General Gordon Baker Jr., a leader
of the Revolutionary Action Movement, and several of his
associates were arrested by police. These individuals were
in possession of weapons and were en route to the riot area.

In all of the above and similar situations, the
Communist Party has seized every opportunity to exploit the
situation, to set itself up as the "champion" of social
protest, and to portray itself as the "leader" in the
struggle for full and equal rights. In other words, the
Communist Party wants to “keep the pot boiling" by any
possible means.

SUL SGLsmGnTS Wort aceive

The study shows that, for the most part, these riots
"and outburstS-were sparked by a single incident, generally
following an arrest of a Negro by local police for some minor
infraction of the law. Although most of the riotous situations
were characterized by spontaneous outbursts of mob violence
dominated by young hoodlums, the involvement of other violent,
jawless, subversive, and extremist elements became readily
. apparent as the rioting progressed.

The cumulative fect, of almost 50 years of Communist
Party activity in the “Un d States cannot be minimized, this
study points out, for communist activity has contributed to
disrupting race relations and has exerted an insidious influence

RE: SUBVERSIVE AND EXTREMIST»

ELEMENTS IN RACIAL VIOLENCE
RESEARCH-SATELLITE MATTER

the past three years highlight the enormous success achieved
by this communist smear campaign in popularizing the cry of
"police brutality”, to the point where it has been widely

accepted by many noncommunists, particularly by Negroes and
other minority groups.

This_study analyzes racial riots and disturbances
‘against_the. background of. kuowi communi. aims,and, objectives.
{It shows that communists seek to advance their cause by in~
jecting themselves into racial situations and exploiting them.
i

. In analyzing the riots and disturbancesgof the past -
three years, this study also deals with. other factors. which 4
have contributed“to facial turmoil and violence. It notes :
that a certain susceptible segment of the Negro population -
has been aroused and influenced by demagogic public statements

‘ of prominent persons~-notably civil rights leaders: hich have

a encouraged | adyaratad) ar candoned lawlessness and civil dis-
obedience, This has had the effect of relieving the partici-
pants in mob action of all responsibility for their reckless
actions. In addition, it is noted that the nationwide pub-
licity given to riotous activity in one locality has served

to stimulate impressible People in Sa areas of the country
to mass action.

i From this study, it is apparent that the net result
“of the racial activities of communists and other subversives
and extremists has been to promote an increasing breakdown of
respect for law and order_acréss the Nation‘and a flagrant
disregard for é“personai_and. property rights of our citizens,
Moreover, their activities have played a major role in poi-
soning the atmosphere and in creating a climate of conflict
between the races.

PATTERN CF VIOLSHCE

Origin and Nature of Disturbances

During the past three summers, the United States
has boen wracked by a series of explosive racial riots and
Gisorders, accompanied by arsen, looting, and attacks on
law enforcouent officers. Almost daily, racial violence
has erupted somewkere in the coustry. ‘

It goes without saying that certain economic,
social, and psychological factors and develosments helned
. toset the stase for each of the riots and disorters that
have occurred since 1964, Over a period of years, seething ;
Negro frustratibn and resentment arising from inequality of
employment opportunities; de facto segregation in schools
and housing; distrust of the police; and agitation and
propaganda by. subversives, extremists, and demagogues have

to the point of explosion, Only a spark has been needed
to ignite incendiary situations.

Most of the riots and disturbances of the past

* three years have been characterized by spontaneous out-
bursts of mob violence dominated by the actions of Negro |
youths ranging in age up to the middle twenties, Those F
“youths~-individuals as well as roving bands--were usually
in the forefront screaming racist slogans, hurling missiles
at the police, setting Zilyes, and engaging in sniping and
looting, As the rioting grew and spreed, it became obvious
that subversives and extremists, as well as teen-age gangs,
delinquents, criminals, rabble-rousors, agitators, trousle-
makers, and irrespousible individuals, were ever present,
ever reacy, and ever willing to engage in violent acts or
to lend encouragement to the rioters.

‘’ The Anatomy of Riots

A definite pattern of events has been discernible
in all the major riots of the past three years. Almost
invariably, they began in a similar way. They were triggered
i by Negro reaction to a minor, routine incident involving

abuse--heckling, ridicule, joers, obscene remarks, curses,

and threats. As the mob spirit spread like wildfire, every
effort by responsible public officials, police officers, and
Negro and white leaders to induce the crowd to disperse and
return home had no effect. Complete contemt for the law, the
individual, and the property rights of others became appallingly
evident. Utter chaos prevailed.

“Get whitey," “Uncle Tom mist die," “Durn, baby, burn," and
"KA11, minis EL11," Assaults wore directed at Negro as well

The Watts riot of August 11-20, 1965, was the biggest
and costliest riot that the United States has experienced is
this century. Disorder covered a 45,5-squaro-mile area of

Communist Organizations

Communist Party, USA

Exploiting facial Turmdit

: Since communism thrives en discontent and chaos,

vacial violonee, hatred, and bigotry are grist for the

communist sromaganda mili. ‘fhe viots and disturbances of

the past three years have given the Communist Party, USA (CPUSA),

@ field day to ponulnrize the Marxist concent of the "elass

struggle" by identifying the probleas of the Negroes and other
: minobity grouys with it. These vacial disorders fave enabled
the Party to indict: the capitalist syates and to charge that it
has ezplelted the Negroes, wlong with nll other minority groups
in the United States, for centuries, “The Yorker," an cast
coast communist newspaper, proclains that these disturbances
have exposed “the generations of poverty and rejectica, the

SEtlottatisn ane tho Sincstininatsas ber tha induatesnl aanitalias
Sapa ULuesa Qno Sho Gaccsiminaticn, cy ina andusteial tapitatist

system."

The CPUSA has a membership estimated by its leaders
to be in excess of 10,080. But Gus Hall, the Party's general
+ Becretary, refers ta 100,000 “state of mind" communists .
when he talks of Party strength. Lany of these “state of
, nind" communistseaJormer Party members, symoathizers, rebelliouse
minded youth, and the likesshave been and can be activated in
aiding the Party in its expioitation ef racial issues.

The CPUSA has a number of obvious objectives, all

designed to advance the cause of communism, in injecting

itself into and exploiting racial controversies ond situations.
These ains include the follows t1) te intensify the frictions:
between Negroes and whites to “prove" that the discrimination
against minorities is an inherent defect of the capitalist syste,
€2) to foster conestic disunity be dividing Negroes and whites
into antagonistic, warring facticns, (3) to undermine and destroy
established authority, (4) to iacite Nosro hostility toward

law and order, ) to encourage and Zonent Zurther racial

strife and riotous activity, ond (6) to portray the communist
movement as the "champion" of social protest and the only force
, capable of ameliorating the conditions of the Negroes and the
oppressed.

“Police Brutality"

A primary ce mist nin is to clienate the
Negroes against established authority, Ever since the
SA was founded in 1919, it has beon communist policy to
charre “police brutality" wherever possible in a calculated
canpaien to discredit lsw enforcenent and to intensify racial
issues. The serremate effect of this continuing smear
canmMlisn is that communists have achieved enormous success
in popularizing ~his oxy to the point where it is being
used more and nore by honconmunists, particularly Negroes
and other ninority groups.

"Police brutality," according to communists, is
& paramount cause of racial violence, In commenting on the
Havien riot of July, 1654, "The Worker" charged that ".,..the
real criminals... are not the chanting cenonstrators nor the
youngsters who fought off the clubs, ‘They are the men who,
under cover of the police badge, established the tlew and
erder’ of terrerism by wildly beating into submission 211
who happened to cross their paths, ‘The bloodletting and
_Violence in ilarlen rest squarely on the shoulders of the
New York City authorities."5

A sizable disturbance took place in the Puerto Rican
community of Chicago in dune, 1966, whick was finally settled
only by firm police action, This disorder prompted "The
Worker" to clain that "the outrage comaitted arainst the
Puerto Riena pseple by the Chicaso police is the latest
publicized examnie of the brutality of these ‘servants’ of
the people throughout the nation against the Negro people,
the Puerto Ricans and the poor of every nationality." 6

The net effect of charges of "police brutality" is
to provoke and encourage mob action by ceveloning contempt
for constituted authority and relioving the participants of
all responsibility for their reckless actions.

Philadelphia Riot

Officials of the Communist Party in Philadelphia took
advantage of the vict in that city on August 23-31, 2954, to
prepare a statement and an article which appeared in wre Worker"
for Soptember 1, 1964. it was charged that the rioters singled
out the police for vengeance, because “for years the reopic | have
suffered the cutrages, terror and indignity ef a police fore
that has viewed the community as a pJuagle,! the nickname
bestowed on the community by the city's officiaidom." 6

Four Party members distributed some 200 copies of
this issue of "fze Worker" in the riot area. About 45 copies
were sold, and the renainder were given avay on a dooreto-door
basis. Copies of three Party pamphlets were also distributed
@long with the newspaper. 9

Watts Riot and Later Disorders
The Watts riot of August, 1965, was the type of

Yacial trouble upon which communism feeds, because it permitted
the party to capitalize on a tragic development, in the wake



of this riot, the Party's Southern California District issued
an eight~vage panvhiet bearing the tltie, “Uatts' Unsurce:
A Communist Appraisal." Ghis panphlet claimed that Linyor

i Sanuel Yorty and Chief of Police William Yarkereawho has since

Gicdeowere to biawe gor the deaths of more than 30 people and
the jailing of over 3,000. 1u

On August 14, during this riot, members of the
communistecentrollied W. &. B. Exlois Ciubs of America (eca)
and menbers of the Socialist Workers Party, a Trotskyist

three members of tne Los vAngeles. branch of the DUA to establish

The accidental slaying in Los Angeles of Leonard

incident with which to keep tke pot boiling. ‘The South Side

Young Negro hoodiums have beer a constant and evere-
increasing source of trouble and concsrn to law enforcement

ef2ieces is overy uaet of the country. hey have exhitited

deepeseated and batter defiance of the police, and they can
generally be found in‘the lead wherever there is riotous
activity. Their actions contribute materially to the chaos of
racial disorders. :

During the Watts riot of August, 1965, for instance,
the Los Angeles Human Relaticas. Co: ssioa called a meeting in ‘
‘the hove of esol g the neighborhood's exotions. Amid the
placating speeches, however, one high scheol youth seized the
microphone and announced that rioters would attack adjacent
white neighborhocds that night. The moed of the meeting instant]
changed. 69

Neighborhood youth gangs, which are prevalent in Negro
communities in most big cities, bear such names as “Dovil's .
Disciples," "Supremes, "Cobras," "Vice Lords," "Bishops," "Roman ;
Saints," *Gents, " "Blackstone Rangers," and “Black Panthers." \
One gang will vie’ with another fer control of an area. AS a y
consequence, gang | fights, shootings, knifings, and vandalism occur
with frequency. These gangs also extort money from school 7
children and engage in muggings, purse snatchings, and the steal- -
ing and stripping of automobiles. 70, 71, 72, 73, 74 H

FANNING THE FLAMES

Flouting the Law

.

In addition to the organizations, gangs, and individuais

involved in inciting or intensifying racial situations, there are
some prominent public figures and recognized civil rights leaders
who have done much--wittingly er unwittingly--to foment violence by
preaching disrespect for law and order, Throuyh demagogic statements
which encourage, advocate, or condone lawlessness and civil disobe=
dience, these leaders have incited the Negro masses tp lash out and

- try to ssize by force that which they have been repeatedly told has
been denied to them. ‘ 4

: Joseph Le Fevour, president of the Fraternal Order of Police,
which has 4,000 Chicago policemen as members, recently described
Martin Luther King as "no more than a demagogue and a professional
Soeecatcr., NS abStYuclds pouyle iv pruviive vivili Gisovpearence ang
violate the law to draw attention to their civil rights plight. Then
he immediately puts up a smoke screen and the very people who violate
the law, when they are arrested, scream ‘police brutality.‘ He
preaches non-violence, yet wherever ke goes, violence erupts." 77

Power of News Media

During the past three years, some Negro leaders have period-
ically issued ominous predictions of violence to come, named specific
.cities as targets for organized civil rights activity, or warned that
&S many aS several score of cities were ripe for riots. These
inflammatory statements have been given nation-wide publicity in the
press, on television, and over the radio. Provocative statements
such as these have only served to arouse Negroes to mass action and {
violence, }

vo Representatives of the news media have frequently been so
active in their coverage of a riot that they have tended to generate
excitement among the rioting elements. During the course of many of
the riots and disturbances, radio and television interviews have been
conducted with the participants, thereby affording self-seexing
individuals an opportunity to circulate wild and unfounded rumors,
especially of so-calied "police brutality." These interviews have
heaped fuel on the fire by attracting others to the riot area.

have had an infectious effect on people tm other yarts of the

: Unlawful activities under the erise of civil rights

themselves more and mores«fed by such white racist rabble-rousers

a result of continually threatened and actual vielenrce, particularly,

by the exponents of “black power." j

This Nation hes been reaping the harvest from the seeds 7
