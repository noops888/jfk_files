(AXSON, a P822) (920892) - Clearance of Areadavit

3 October 1956

Reference is made to Subject's memorandum dated 17

/

Subject attached a copy of the substance of the information which

she would provide in her affidavit in support of Mrs. Conein's

action in contesting the divorce.

2. It was ascertained from Mr. Farrison, Clearance Branch,

Personnel Security Division, that there is a current security

action concerning Subject under Executive Order 10450, the ques-

tionable Infornation which brought about F.. O. 10450 processing

being concerned with Subject's sister's associations, rather than

her out.

A review of Major Conein's file (#5025) discloses that

Coreia is a regular Army officer who has been assigned to this

He is presently on home leave after

a Far Fastern tour and the Office of Security has been advised that

Caress will probably be returned to the Aruy in October, 1956, in

order to serve two years to complete twenty years service. After

bis any retirement, there is a possibility that he will be con-

sidered for assignment to this Agency as a staff employee. Conein's

file contains no record of his nost recent marriage, i.e., his

mar-inge to Carmen Conein. It is noted that Mr. Myers, Clearance

Braze, Personnel Security Division, has been instructed to develop

inta-sation concerning Conein's present spouse inasmuch as it was

les-zed indirectly that Conein is married at present.

â€¢ A search of Office of Security indices in the name ol

EEL Conein revealed that this person who is Major Conein'=

wife, is the subject of File #28995 and vas a CIA employee until

her -esignation in October, 1951. Her file reflects that she

na--ied kajor Conein in Germany in December, 1948.

5 On 28 September 1956 I contacted Subject intending to

onein's contesting of

not Indicate her employment as CIA in the affidavit. I learned

fron Subjeot that she had already submitted an affidavit and that

she had not ventioned her present employment therein.

Subject

stated that (!. Berkau, Security Officer, FI Staff, had Informed

her that she could subut the affidavit, but that she should

advise the offico of Security as a mattor of information. Subject

described kafor Conein as a very unserupuloue person-end mentioned

that Concin wants to prove that his wife, Carmen, has established

residence elsewhere and will not live with him.

He will try to

deny that he has resided in the Washington area, altbough she ani

other persons, including a realty agent who sold their present

home to the tajor and his wife, can tostify to the contrary. Sub

jest nentioned that Carmen Conein is now employed by the National

Security Agency.

I Instructed Subject to contact this Office for appropriate

briefing in the event that she is called upon to appear in court

In connection with the Conein divorce matter. She agreed to do

this, but expressed the opinion that there would be no need for her

to appear in this case.

It should be noted that teohnioally speaking Major Conein

should bave-notified the Office of Security relative to his intention

to file suit for divorce; however, circumstances indicate that he

has not returned to Headquarters since completion of his recent

Far Fastern tour and that the divorce aotion apparently was initlated

within the past month or two during the Major's hone lesve. In view

of the fact that Conein has natural cover as an Army officer so that

no publiiity to CIA would result fran his divorce action, and in

view of the probability that he will return to the Army this month

for a tiro year tour, it is belleved that no further action is

necessary by this Branch. In view of the current interest by the

Clearance Branch, Personnel Security Division in regard to the

Identity of Subject's spouse, it is suggested that this memorandum

be forwarded to the attention of John Myers of Clearance Branch.
