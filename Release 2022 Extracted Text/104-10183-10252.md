phone to say that he had received a letter from BRENO (CR)
postmarked 25 Feb., Paris. In one paragrapfr,(it}stated that he

‘ had been given several “encargos" from AMALSH for A/1 to be
“transmitted personally” (see attached copy of letter). Since
the above information was not mentioned in the clear over the

order to see the letter personally and to guide A/1 in any
subsequent steps, The writer arrived at A/l's office at
ca 1240, 28 Feb.

b, It was A/I's impression that the “encargos"
cited in the letter included things beyond personal requests,
but he was not absolutely certain of this interpretation due
to the brevity of the paragraph. To resolve this expeditiously
as requested inthe letter, jt_was decided that A/L should call
Paris and talk directly witnl Bridie, of course, any phone
call to the Cuban Fmbgssy there. To uchieve this, it first, ¢

cause for concern, but "in fact he was not too apprehensive as i
he felt both men were "100%" behind AMLASH. A/1 went on to
say that by this he meant that both men had been for a long
tie aasociated with the circles in which AMLASIT ad been a
Teader, and could be regarded us “loyal” to AMLASH, However,
