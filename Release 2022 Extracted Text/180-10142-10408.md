MOVIMIENTO DEMOCRATA CRISTIANO (MDC)

After Castro's assumption of power in 1959, it became
evident to many Cubans that political parties were being

surpressed and the 26th of July Movement was being infil-

|

trated by Communists. This political atmosphere gave rise
to the creation of underground organizations such as the
Christian Democratic Movement of Cuba (mpc) .2 Proclaiming

the doctrine of Christianity as its foundation, the MDC

SA GA DG BR WR SS GA

published a manifesto in March, 19607 denouncing Communism
and strongly advocating the free enterprise system.? One
of the founders of the MDC, 35-year-old law professor,
Dr. Jose Ignacio Rasco, was elected head of the organization*
and immediately criticized the violence prevalant in the
Castro regime.> This public criticism produced pressure on
him to leave Cuba and he arrived in Miami on April 22, 1960.°
By June, Rasco had allied himself and the MDC with the Frente
Revolucionario Democratico (PRD)? and thus became one of the
five original exile Cuban leaders brought together by the
State Department and the.CIA to form the nucleus of a Cuban
government~in-exile.®

After the Bay of Pigs invasion, the MDC split into factions.”
Rasco remained head of the largest faction and organized

delegations in Miami, New York, Chicago, Venezuela and cuba.?°

Fernandez Badue who used the alias "Lucas" .2+ When Fernandez
arrived in the U.S. in October, 1961, he presented his
credentials to the Cuban Revolutionary Council, (CRC),
claiming he was the representative of the MDC movement in
Cuba. ?? Council president, Dr. Miro Cardona, accepted him
into the CRC hierarchy. 13 The “Lucas" faction remained with
the Council but its role was ineffectual because Fernandez
eventually failed to hold the group together.14

The "Rasco" faction of MDC had as its Military Chief an
independently wealthy young Cuban, Laureano Batista Falla.?>
Free-spirited and under no financial pressures, Batista Falla
organized and partially financed the infiltration attempts

The "Batista" faction of the MDC (so named after the
youthful military chief rose to the position of president
in 1962)°> entered into similar cooperative alliances with
other exile groups for the purposes of propaganda, sabotage
and supplying the Cuban’ underground. Many MDC members joined
the Cuba Committee in 1962 which was formed to counteract
the propaganda of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, a pro-
Castro organization in the u.s.7° The MDC and the Directorio

plans for an underground organization to infiltrate Oriente

anti-Castro groups peaked in the year 1963. One involved
the MDC, the Movimento Insurrecconial de Recupueracion

soldier of fortune, supplied information that Batista Falla,
Orlando Bosch Avila, Manuel Artime and Alexander Rorke were
jointly planning an air strike over Havana on April 25.78

from Gus de LaBarre's nephew and attorney, Frank de LaBarre,

De LaBarre said his “Uncle Gus" had introduced him to
Davis, whom De LaBarre described as a "floater." They came to
see De LaBarre about drawing up articles of incorporation
for the Guatemalan Lumber Company and that is when he says
he learned of their plans to bring unemployed Cubans from
Miami to train as lumberjacks. Uncle Gus sent provisions to
the exiles on a daily basis and solicited money for food and
clothing from friends and Petetivesttt

Although he suspected that military training was being
conducted at the camp, Frank-de LaBarre said he didn't pay

Cuba, good facilities for operating boats and the availability
