GMA 3/14197 (JFK)

With regard to events which led up to the deportatio

of Marcello to Guatemala and to activities which occurred there-

after, you may be interested in the following information which

was developed by Agent Papich in Guatemala City, Guatemala, on

May 12, 1961.

[Paul Loeb,

Chief of Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)

station in Guatemala, confided to the Bureau Agent that he had

been very much involved in working out arrangements whereby

Marcelle was accepted by the Guatemalan Government. It was

Loeb'S nderstanding that Attorney General Kennedy had conferrec

with Allen Dulles and had asked for the CIA Director's assistance

that astor tor the

in making certain that Guatemala accept Marcello as a citizen of

that country. Loeb received instructions from his Headquarters

to give the matter special handling. Loeb then went to President

Miguel Ydigoras of Guatemala and explained to him that Marcello

allegedly was a Guatemalan citizen; that the U.S. Government

planned to deport him to Guatemala and that in order to effect

this deportation it would be necessary for the Guatemalai

-overnment to accept the subject. Loeb appealed to Ydigoras fol

full cooperation which was granted.

the Guatemalan President insisted that the matter be handle

uietly and that there be no publicity. Loeb Informed Ydigora:

that as far as he knew there would not be any publicity.

Guatemalan Government then officially agreed to accept subject.

Nana day to flats that to e

Loebi stated that he personally was at the airport on

the day when Marcello arrived in Guatemala City on a U.S. Border

Patrol plane. He was shocked to observe that there were 15 to 20

reporters gathered at the airport, all waiting for the subject.

Memorandum L'Allier to Belmont

Re: CARLOS MARCELLO

ANT IRACKETEERING

Loeb did not know how the information had leaked to the press

but he assumed that there must have been some notice given to

newspapermen in the U.S. Because of this sudden appearance of

newspapermen, Guatemalan officials found it necessary to process

the subject's entry in a clandestine manner and in another building

in the city.

According to Loeb, the newspapermen learned what happened

and some of the local writers began criticizing the Guatemalan

President for his involvement in

• the entire episode.

Some of the

President's political opposition accused him of protecting a

hoodlum.

raigoras became greatly incensed, bearing, in mind that hi:

political position is extremely shaky.

He accused Loeb of mishandlin

the entire matter and has refused to deal with the cia ofticial on

any other matters since the above-described event.

secause of the pressure being placed upon him by political

pposition, Ydigoras realized that it would be

necessary to remove

the subject. On or about May 10, 1961, Marcello allegedly was to

be returned to the U.S. via Pan American Airways, who had agreed to

accept him as a passenger even though he would be inadmissible in

a passenger even though

the U.S. Pan American reportedly did this because Ydigoras had

issued orders cancelling flights of all airlines going into and

out

of the country if they refused to take Marcello as a passenger.

Pan American apparently decided to gamble because the threatened

cancellation would

be seriously damaging to the airlines business.

Koen stated that Marcello never appeared at the airpater

and a check at the hotel indicated that he had disappeared.

pointed out

that as far as he was concerned there was no

the story. He was convinced that arrangements were made between

Marcello and Guatemalan officials whereby Marcello was able to

conveniently move to a finea (tarn) in the interior of Guatemala.

Loeb has received information from a reliable source indicating

that subject is living comfortably and will not leave until a

disposition is made of the court action in behalf of the subject,

now reportedly pending in Washington, D. C. Hoebis convinced
