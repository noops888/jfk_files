planned to deport him to Guatemala and that in order to effect

Memorandum L'Allier to Belmont
Re: CARLOS MARCELLO
ae

Rev oeb He not know how the information had leaked to the press

@ assumed that there must have been some notice given to
newspapermen in the U.S. Because of this sudden appearance of
newspapermen, Guatemalan officials found it necessary to process
the subject's entry in a clandestine manner and in another building
which blocked any contact with newspaper people. This worked
successfully and the subject was immediately removed to a hotel
in the city.

and some of the local writers began criticizing the Guatemalan
President for his involvement in the entire episode. Some of the
President's political opposition accused him of protecting a
hoodlum. Ydigoras became greatly incensed, bearing,in pind that his
political position is extremely shaky. He accused{LoehOf mishandling
the entire matter and has refused to deal with the CIA “official on
any other matters since the above-described event.

)
} According to Gooif the newspaperner learned what happened

’
Because of the pressure being placed upon him ‘by political
opposition, Ydigoras realized that it would be necessary to remove
the subject. On or about May 10, 1961, Marcello allegedly was to
be returned to the U.S. via Pan American Airways, who had agreed to
accept him as a passenger even though he would be inadmissible in
the U.S. Pan American reportedly did this because Ydigoras had.
issued orders cancelling flights of all airlines going into and out
of the country if they refused to take Marcello as a. passenger.
Pan American apparently decided to gamble because the threatened
cancellation would be seriously damaging to the airlinds business.

Looif stated that Marcello never appeared at the airport
and a check at the hotel indicated that he had disappeared. Later
a report was received that Guatemalan officials had forced him into
El Salvador, which country had refused to accept subject. (Loeb, 3)
pointed out that as far as he was concerned there was no truth to
the story. He was convinced that arrangements were made between
Marcello and. Guatemalan officials whereby Marcello was abk to
convygniently move to a finea (farm) in the interior of Guatemala.
LoebPhas received information from.a reliable source indicating
hat subject is living comfortably and will not leave until a
disposition is made of the court action in behalf of the subject,
now reportedly pending in Washington, D. C. )Loeblis convinced
