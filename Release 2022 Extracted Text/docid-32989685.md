administration the net salary plus lederal and state payroll

taxes from various OEO programe were deposited into a special

OST payroll account at the Stockman National Bank.

the

money in this account was used to pay salaries of persons

working for the varlous OEO programs and was supposed to be

used to pay loderal and state payroll taxes.

For many months

prior to the WILSON administration, the federal and state

payroll tax reports were not filed

by the OST treasurer under

the ONE FEATHER administration.

As & result of this, tha

monies in the special OST payroll account gradually built up

to a balance of approximately $230, 000. About this time the

Internal Revenue Service (IRS) came in and audited the payroll

of the various OEO programs which were being paid by the cst.

As a result of this IRS audit, the IRS assessed the CST at an

amount exceeding the $230,000

balance which had built up in

the special OST payroll account.

The OST used the entire

balance of the $230,000 in the special payroll account and

also had to borrow money from the Stockman National Bank

and the OtO in order to pay the Ins the back payroll tas

assessment.

Since the WILSON administration took over, the

special OST payroll account has been operating very

smoothly,

and all federal and state payroll taxes have been filed

timely by EMMA NELSON.

the ins in Rapid city, south Dakota is the office

that conducted the audit of the OST payroll. They car

furnish more detailed information concerning this matter.

he materio

In the past WILSON has been involved in what some

people might call "shady deals" but since he became president

of the OST, JOHNSON believes that WILSON is conducting the

altairs of ost honest and completely above boara.

WILSON

is no more honest or dishonest than was GERALD ONe FoldER

or any of the other Tribal presidents over the past many years.

The First National Bank of Gordon, Nebraska

maintains various checking accounts of the

OST invoLving

their programs with the oEO.

CRIME ON AN INDIAN RESERVATION - FRAUD

These funds are maintained in a special

Oglala Sious Tribe payroll account and the controls

This investigation is predicated upon an

allegation made by PEDRO BISSONETTE, Alerican Indian

Wrunded Knee, South Dakota, that Oglala Sioux

Tribal Chairman RICHARD WILSON has vreviously had access

to Federal income taxes withheld from both Bureau of

Indian

..ifairs (BIA) and triba! employees and has

been diverting a

portion

of these funds to members of a

"guon squad" in the form of salaries.

The tribe is supposed to file the appropriate Fedesal and

state withholding tax reports and

state unemployment

tax reports and pay the taxes which were withheld from

the employee's salary from the monies,

which is given

to them by OEO from

the specified special project fund.

The Sioux Tribal Headquarters has not been filing these

tax reports.

About one year ago, the Internal Revenue

Service (IRS) came to Pine Ridge and audited the various

small projects on which the tribe was supposed to tile

payroll tax reports.

The IRS audit resulted in the CAP

fund having to pay several thousand dollars in back pa:roll

taxes for these various special projects which the tride

had

failed to file payroll tax reports for.

The trzie

received the money from the CAP Lund to pay

these taxes

but did not do so.

The special projects heretofore referred

to

wherein OEO submitted monies to the tribe for salaries

plus withholding tax

are the "Community Action Program"

"Parent-Child Center"

, and "Headstart."

Beginning March 27, 1973, the day WILSON'T : ".

set up a roadblock to prevent food

from entering Wowd

Knee, several of WILSON's men began signing charge tiriets

at the Sioux Nation Shopping Center for groceries to t

used by WILSON's "goon squad" at the roadblock.

charge tickets are to be paid out of the OBO "EmergaiC?

Food and Medidal Services Fund" (EFMSF). The persons who

have signed for groceries and charged them to the ErtisE

but who are not authorized by OEO to do so are:

I) ANTHONY BRAVE; 2) DELORES APPLE; 3) TIM SHANGREAU.

These three persons should not be spending money oilt

the Erksf account.

The total amount expended for groceries

on March 27, 28 and 29, 1973, by the above-mentioned persons

is $127.19.

None of these people work for OEo.

The original documents pertaining to the aforementioned

unauthorized purchase of groceries and all of the time sheets for

BEN RICHARDS and RICHARD WILSON, JR., are maintained iy

CARMEL MEANS and will be made available to the Federal

Bureau of Investigation upon request.

CONNELY, Vice President, First National

Banis, Gordon, Nebraska,.

provided the following information:

The First National

Bank of Gordon has one loan

account with ORVILLE SCHMARTING.

This is a $13,400 loan

which SCIllANTING borrowed to finance this ycar's wheat

crop.

SCINARTING will pay ofs this loan when his wheat

crop is sold.

SCIARTING also maintains his checking

account with the First National Bank.

SCINARTING owns the guest ranch in Porcupine,

South Dakota.

The quest ranch is situated on a quarter

section of land in Shannon County. The deed and title for

this land can be located

at the County. Court House in

Ilot Springs, South Dakota.

On February 28, 1972, the Frudential Life

Insurance Conpany, through its

agent E. C. IC CITREE,

Scotts Bluff,

lchraska, released to SCINARTING 400 acres

of land

which SCHNAUTING owned in Shannon and Bennett

Countles.

Whon this land was relcased to SCINANTING he

would have to file a new deed at cither the County Court

House in Hot Springs,

South Dakota, which coveis

Shannon,

County or tartin, South Dakota which covers Bennett County.

The Production Credit Association (PCA) in Rapid City,

south Dakota holds the mortgage on SCHWARTING's livestock

and farm equipment:

PCA may have a mortgage on some of

SCHYARTING'S land,

but this is unlikely.

SCIWVARTING and RICHARD DENGEN have no land

deals together that the First iational Bank is aware of.

SCIWARTING is an honorable man and has done business

with the First National Banl for 20 to 30 years. He has

always honored and paid his obligations on time.

BRYAN BREWER, Teachers Corp. Intern, telephone

school, at wnich time he provided the following information:

He resides in a white trailer home on the left

hand side of route 18 approximately four miles east of Pine

Ridge, South Dakota. His date of birth is February 4, 1947.

He held the position of Program Director, Indian

Action Team (IAT) from August 1, 1973, until. he resigned

on July 12, 1974.

Last year he realized approximately $110,000.00

of IAT funds was budgeted but probably would not be used. "

In January, 1974, he conferred with the Bureau of Indian

Affairs (BIA) Technical Assistance Center in Denver,

Colorado, regarding his desire to establish a Cement Batch

Plant run by the tribe. BIA approved the project based upon

a subsequent approval by the Oglala Sioux Tribal Council.

In the same month the Tribal Council approved the project

and passed a resolution to that

effect.

In approximately February, 1974, he mentioned

to DICK WILSON, Oglala Sioux Tribal

President, he had sent

JOE BLUE HORSE tO Denver, Colorado, to purchase a truck

for the Cement Batch Plant. WILSON "ordered " him to

recall BLUE. HORSE and not to purchase a truck as he

(WILSON) was buying a truck and the Cement Batch Plant

was to buy all gravel from him (WILSCN). The gravel, he

noted, was a crushed limestone.

He hired IKE BETTELYCUN to operate the Batch

Plant. WIISON's men, under the name Lakota Sand and Givel

Company (Lakota), owned by RICHARD (MANNIE) WILSON, JR.,

DICK WILSON's son, began to haul the gravel. He noted

WILSON, previous to this, had the Oglala Sioux Tribal

Council pass a resolution stating all tribal businesses

must purchase materials from other tribal businesses, if

available.

However, he personally observed on many occasions

Lakota using a Government trailer and a Government truck

to haul the gravel.

He knew they were Government vehicles

as the vehicles had Government license plates. He also

knew the delivery was to the Batch Plant, not a BIA project

inasmuch as the vehicles were observed by him delivering

_.gcavel

to the Batch Plant gravel pit. STANLEY WALKER,

Superintendent, BIA Roads Department, authorized IAT to

utilized Government vehicles not in use; he was not sure

if Lakota was authorized to use the vehicles.

He kept copies of 69 delivery tickets which

were submittea to him by DICK WILSON, JR., Or DICK WILSON,

SR., While he was with IAT. The delivery tickets represent

gravel obtained from Hills Material Company, Hot Springs,

south Dakota, by Lakota and all were dated june, 1974.

IAT paid these and subseguent bills. The total

amount. for

the 69 deliveries was approximately $3,450.00. The invoice

He resides in a white trailer home on the left

hand side of route 18 approximately four miles east of Pine

Ridge, South Dakota. His date of birth is February 4, 1947.

He held the position of ProgIam Director, Indian

Action Team (IAI) from August 1, 1973, until he resigned

on July 12, 1974.

Last year he realized approximately $110, 000.00

Of IAI funds was budgeted but probably would not be used. "

In January, 1974, he conferred with the Bureau of Indian

Affairs (BIA) Technical Assistance Center in Denver,

Colorado, regarding his desire to establish a Cement Batch

Plant run by the tribe. BIA approved the project based upon

a subsequent approval by the Oglala Sioux Tribal Council.

In the same month the Tribal Council approved the project

and passed a resolution to that

effect.

In approximately February, 1974, he mentionea

to DICK WILSON, Oglala Sioux Tribal

President, he had sent

JOE BLUE HORSE tO Denver, Colorado, to purchase a truck

for the Cement Batch Plant. WILSON "ordered " him to

recall

• BLUE. HORSE and not to purchase a truck as he

(WILSON) was buying a truck and the Cement Batch Plant

was to buy all gravel from him (WILSCN). The gravel, he

noted, was a crushed limestone.

He hired IKE BETTELYCUN to operate the Batch

Plant. WIISON's men, under the name Lakota Sand and GIvel

WILSON, previous to this, had the Oglala Sioux Tribal

councis pass a resolution stating all tribal businesses

must purchase materials from other tribal businesses, if

available.

However, he personally observed on many occasions

Lakota using a Government trailer and a Government truck

to haul the gravel.

He knew they were Government vehicles

as the vehicles had Government license plates. He also

knew the delivery was to the Batch plant, not a BIA project

inasmuch as the vehicles were observed by him dolivering

_gravel

to the Batch Plant gravel pit. STANLEY WALKER,

Superintendent, BIA Roads Department, authorized IAT to

utilized Government vehicles not in use, he was not sure

if Lakota was authorized to use the vehicles.

He kept copies of 69 delivery tickets which

were submittea to him by DICK WILSON, JR., OF DICK WILSON,

SR., While he was with IAT. The delivery tickets represent

gravel obtained from Hills Material Company, Hot Springs,

south Dakota, by Lakota and all were dated June, 1974.

IAT' paid these and subsequent bills. The total

amount for

the 69 deliveries was approximately $3,450.00. The invoice

The payment to Hills Material Company was for the

cost of gravel. Lakota also charged IAT for the gravel,

$2.00 a ton, and for delivery, $5.00 a ton, on the instructions

OF DICK WILSON, SR.

These bills were presented to FLOYD (BILL)PULLIUM

who paid them with an IAT check." The checks were payable

to Hills Material Company and Lakota.

In early july, 1974, he was talking to LEWIS PRYOR,

Plant Manager, BIA, Pine Riage, South Dakota, who told him

BIA was also paying Lakota for gravel. He surmised the

payment by BIA was for the same gravel. IAT paid for as there

were no other projects he knew of at that time requiring

gravel.

He heard in July, 1974, source not recalled,

BILI, CUNY paid DICK WILSON OF Lakota $10, 000.00 for leveling Ive

industrial lots for the Cement Batch Plant when neither

WILSONnOr Lakota actually did the work. The leveling was

completed in May, 1974, by IAT.

Oglala Sious Tribe in January, 1972, ONE FEATHER has been

working with

both the American Indian Movement (AIM) and the

Oglala Sioux Tribal Council In an effort to improve the criminal

justice system and the financial status of the Oglala Sour

Tribe on the Pine Ridge Reservation.

ONE FLATHER Suspects Chairman WILSON of many

wrongdoings since becoming chief of the Oglala Stow Tribe,

but he has no direct proof or evidence which could be used

against WIlsON in a cow't of law.

Sinca WILSON became

president, he has suspended and fired many competent

paople who were associated with the Tribal Council because

these people

would not cooperate with WILSON in carrying

out various "deal" which WILSON was trying to do.

WILSON suspended the Office of Economic Opportunity

(OBO) Headstart Director HATTIE TWISS, because she would not

cooperate wi.th

WILSON concerning the payment of approainately

ten to fifteen thousand dollars to WISOn's brother, dable

J. WILoON, tor some type oi consulting tees he received

through the Headstart program. IWISS can be located at the

hospital in Gordon, Nebraska.

Since WILSON took ofiice in January, 1972, the

books and records for the Oglala Sioux Tribe have not been

audited and according to several mambers of the Tribal

Council, the records which are currontly being kept are

very inadequato.

During the ONE FEATHER administration, the

accounting firm of Thorstenson and Sayler in Rapid City

was responsible for auditing the books and records of the

Interviewed on

to do monthly accounting work for the Tribe. KIllfhis contract

with the Tribo oxpired in October, 1972, and WILSON would not

renew hts contract:

HATTIE TWISS, Rocky Fort Route, Porcupine, South

Jakota, was interviewed at the Gordon menorial Hospital,

Gordon, Nebraska and provided the jollowing intormation:

She was Director for the Office of Economic

Opportunity (OBO) Headstart Program until October, 1972,

at which time she resigned because of wrongdoings on the

part o1 RICHARD WILSON, President of the Oglala Sioux Tribe

(OST) .

WILSON was trying to get access to the Headstart

funds which she controlled but she would not allow him

access to the funds.

During the first part of October, 1972, she

became ill and had to go into the hospital

for a week. When

She returned to work she discovered that WILSON had drawn

$14,000 Irom the Headstart account. There was no allowance

IOT

this withdrawal at the Headstart project and WILSON

would not account for what the $14,000 was spent for. The

check that was written for the $14,000 bore HATTIE TWISS'

signature,

but she did not sign the check.

At this point,

she was led up with the way WILSON was operating and

barrassing her, so she turned in her resignation.

She could furnish no details concerning the payment

os $10,000 to $15,000 to WILSON's brother, JAMDS WILSON;

however, FRANCIS KILLER Of Vermillion, South Dakota has

the dtails surrounding this payment.

KILLER waS the

accountant for the OST at the time this disbursement was

supposedly made to WILSON's brother.

There has been much wrongdoing on the part of

DICK WILSON SInce he took office in April, 1972. He has

continuously attempted to gain control of the various OrO

funds, and used these funds for purposes which would not

benefit the sioux people.

DAVE LONG, vice president of the OST, can furnish

additional Iniormation concerning wrongdoing on the part of

RICHARD WILSON.

THEODORE "RED" TIBBITTS, Pine Ridge, South Dakota,

provided the following information:

He is the 5th member of the Executive Committee of the

Oglala Sioux Tribe, Pine Ridge Reservation. ROBERT MOUSSEAU was

appointed Director

of the Sun

Dance by the Tribal Council. The

Tribal Council had provided $5,000 operating expenses in its annual

budget to be used for the Sun Dance.

Approximately two - three

days prior to the staging of the Sun Dance, MOUSSEAU requested

an additional $3,000 From the Executive Board in order to pay

numerous outstanding bills. This request was denied.

Several days later he requested an amount believed to

be $400 from WALLACE LITTLE FINGER, Tribal Treasurer, so that the

gate men could make change. LITTLE FINGER gave this money to

MOUSSEAU •

A special meeting was held after the Sun Dance was

over

and the Tribal Committee approved the payment of an additional

$3,000 to MOUSSEAU for Sun Dance expenses.

Because of the request

for additional money, the Executive Board became suspicious of

the handling of the funds. In addition, other members of the

Tribe were also suspicious and petitioned the Reservation

Superintendent for an audit.

A Tribal Court Order was then served upon the Executive

Board to produce the records.

MOUSSEAU agreed to provide the

records, but subsequently called the Tribal counsel (attorney)

in Washington, D. C., and was advised to plead immunity.

TIBBIITS stated he and WALLACE LITTLE FINGER then went

to the Stockman's National Bank in Rushville, Nebraska, and

obtained the checks and bank statements for the Sun Dance and

the Stampede and gave these to Special Officer LARRY GLOVER.

TIBBITTS stated ENOS POOR BEAR, Chairman of the Tribal

Council, will have the minutes of the meetings outlining their

authorizations.

LITTLE FINGER will have records of expenditures.

TIBBITTS further related that this is the first

year the stampede or rodeo was to be held.

The Tribal Council

authorized JACK STEELE to run the rodeo and pay a percentage

of his profit to the tribe. STEELE is a part-time rodeo

promoter with no connection to ROBERT MOUSSEAU.

Certain of the

rodeo equipment was obtained with a lease-purchase agreement

through Dakota Leasing Equipment in Rapid City.

TIBBITTS further stated MOUSSEAU had obtained money

from Velma's Cafe, which was rented for August and September at

$75 per month, totaling $150. A receipt was issued.

This money

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

Date October 24, 1969

ENOS POOR BEAR, President of the Tribal Council.

Oglala Sioux Tribe, Pine

Ridge, South Dakota, advised that

the Council had appointed ROBERT J. MOUSSEAU Sun Dance

Director and PAUL APPLE Assistant Director.

These two

individuals are responsible to the Council

for the operation

of the Sun Dance.

At the time the Sun Dance was run, "RED" TIBBITTS,

sth member of Council, WALLACE LITTLE FINGER, Treasurer, and

LLOYD EAGLE BULL, all

served on the Executive Committee. The

Council had appropriated the sum of $5,000 to run the Sun

Dance.

Prior to the operation of the event, MOUSSEAU requested

$300 in order to make change at the gate. He was given the

amount by WALLACE LITTLE FINGER.

There was a Special Session of Council called by

LLOYD EAGLE BULL, which later appropriated an additional $3,000

in Sun Dance funds. JACK STEELE was authorized to run the

Sioux Stampede (rodeo). STEELE apparently had a falling-out

with RICHARD WILSON, who was apparently ramrodding the stampede.

When this occurred, JACK POURIER was brought in to provide the

rodeo stock.

There was no money appropriated by the Tribe to be

used for the stampede. Neither was there any authorization to

use Sun Dance money for the stampede.

POOR BEAR provided copies of the following documents:

Minutes of the Oglala Sioux Tribe Council, Regular

Session, April 8 - 29, and May 1 - 8, 1969;

Minutes of the Oglala Sioux Tribe Council, Special

Session, June 10, 11, 1969;

WALLACE LITTLE FINGER, Pine Ridge, south Dakota,

advised he is the treasurer of the Oglala Sioux Tribe.

A subpoena duces tecum may be addressed to MI. LITTLE FINGER

to obtain financial records of the tribe.

ROBERT MOUSSEAU and PAUL APPLE were appointed as

directors of the Oglala Sioux Sun Dance by the tribal

council and a budget of $5000 was allotted for operating

expenses. LITTLE FINGER stated that because of past

problems involved with the Sun Dance, he did not wish

to participate in its operation and therefore he took

annual leave at that time.

He had written a check

drawn on the regular tribal funds in the amount of

$5000

to enable the sun

• Dance to start up.

Two days before

the Sun Dance was to have occurred,

MOUSSEAU appeared

before the tribal council and stated he was broke and

asked for an additional allocation of $3000. As this

amount was not in the budget, MOUSSEAU did not obtain the

money

at this time.

The tribal council at a later meeting

voted to revise the budget and granted MOUSSEAU the

additional $3000.

Also, just prior to the staging of

the Sun Dance, MOUSSEAU requested he be given $300 in

order to make

change. As this $300 was not returned

following the Sun Dance, this amount was deducted from

the $3000 later given to MOUSSEAU for the Sun Dance.

This $300 represents the only money the tribe had

received as proceeds from the Sun Dance.

LITTLE FINGER further related according to the

administrative policy of the tribe, approval by the

council or the executive board must be obtained in order

for per diem to be received for travel off the reservation.

The per diem rate is usually $20 per day for long trips and

$7 to $12 for short trips, including Rapid City.

LITTLE FINGER

stated he does not know anything about the operation or

financing of the Oglala Sioux Stampede.

LITTLE FINGER provided copies of the following

documents:

On October 16, 1969, the facts in this matter

obtained as of that date were discussed at his request with

BRICE LAY, Superintendent, Pine Ridge Indian Reservation.

Also present at this conference was Agency Special Officer

LAWRENCE GLOVER (NA) .

Both LAY and GLOVER expressed a strong desire for

Eederal prosecution in this case as ROBERT MOUSSEAU, RICHARD

WILSON, and PAUL APPLE are considered by them to be constantly

involved in illegal operations and in stealing from the Oglala

Sioux Tribe of which MOUSSEAU, WILSON, and APPLE are officers

and/or council members.

It was felt by LAY and GLOVER that a conviction,

even of a misdemeanor with a suspended sentence, would go a

long way toward halting the

thievery and stealing which runs

rampant on the reservation.

ROBERT J. MOUSSEAU, Pine Ridge, South Dakota, was

interviewed in the

Pine Ridge Reservation Police Station

in the presence of Police Lieutenant FRED TWO BULLS.

He was advised of the official identity of the interviewing

agent and was advised that the nature of the interview was

concerning the embezzlement of tribal funds. MOUSSEAU

was advised of his constitutional rights by

of an Advice of Rights Form.

presentation

After reading this form,

he agreed to waive his rights and signed a Waiver of

Rights form. MOUSSEAU provided the following information:

He is secretary of the Oglala Sioux Tribe and

was Sun Dance director for the year 1969. The tribal

council had given JACK STEELE a contract

to put on a

rodeo in conjunction with the annual Sun Dance. The

agreement was the tribe was to get twenty-five

percent

of the profit and steElE, seventy-five percent.

DICK WILSON and MOUSSEAU took it upon themselves

to handle the rodeo, as no committee had been appointed

by the tribe.

Several attempts have been made to contact

STEELE to help plan the rodeo but he could not be reached.

A meeting was called for

rodeo planning by WILSON which

MOUSSCAU could not attend. Afterwards, WILSON told MOUSSEAU

that STEELE had backed out of the rodeo because he was not

getting enough money.

WILSON said JACK POURIER would take

the rodeo, so the committee gave it to him, feeling that

they could not get anyone else from the outside.

The arrangement with JACK POURIER waS a 50 - 50

split with the tribe.

There was no tribal approval for the

change in contract. MOUSSEAU continued stating the tribe

authorized the rodeo with no money. He told the tribal

council in special session he was going to use Sun Dance

money for the rodeo. At this point MOUSSEAU was provided

with a copy of the

minutes of the tribal council for the

pertinent periods, and he was unable to find any reference

to his having so notified the tribal council.

MOUSSEAU said he told the council he did not

want to run the Sun Dance and felt a committee should do so.

The council decided that the executive committee of the

tribe would be the Sun Dance committee.

The rodeo has lost money because entry fees

amounting to $60 to $80 were paid by checks which were not

•MOUSSEAU expects the All American Indian Activities

Association to make good on these checks. In regard to

the receipts by the Sun Dance and the Stampede, MOUSSEAU

stated tickets were sold at the rodeo but were

not accounted

Admission was gained to the Sun Dance by stamping

hands of people as they paid. He could not see anything

wrong with this system, as it has always been like this.

In regard to the transfer of funds from the Sun Dance to

the rodeo, MOUSSEAU stated he assumed that since both

activities were tribal sponsored, the money could be

interchanged.

WALLACE LITTLE FINGER, Tribal Treasurer, gave

him, MOUSSEAU, the checkbook for the Sun Dance and

stated he did not want anything to do with it.

As to the booster trip made to Rapid City,

MOUSSEAU Said he took eight to ten people from Pine

and got several more Indians who lived in Rapid City to

participate.

JACK FASH (phonetic) promoted and suggested

the idea.

Transportation to Rapid City was provided by

tribal station wagon and two Government cars (General Services

Administration). MILES BOLLINGER, Superintendent of

Schools, approved the use of these vehicles.

The group

traveled to Rapid City. Upon arrival there,

MOUSSEA U

paid for the lunch in the amount of approximately $30.00

Following the meal, these people went to the Greyhound

Race Track where they put on several dances in the middle

of the field.

MOUSSEAU Stated the sun Dance lost money

because of the rodeo. He stated the filming of the Sun

Dance and the rodeo by CASEY TIBBS and JOEL MC RAY was set

up by LLOYD EAGLE BULL and himself.

The only payment they

got was one buffalo;

MOUSSEAU feels the tribe should have

been paid much more than this.

'MOUSSEAU is not aware of any policy on per diem

or tribal authorization needed to obtain per diem payments

while on a trip.

MOUSSEAU was shown a copy of the administrative

procedure of the Oglala Sioux Tribe and it was pointed out

where such policy exists, authorization is required.

MOUSSEAU then stated the

policy was not followed by

anyone

When inquiries were made as to. the work provided for the

Sun Dance by PAUL APPLE, MOUSSEAU Stated APPLE was a

foremen and worked on just about everything in regard to

the Sun Dance, even appearing on television. He was also

in charge of prisoner labor.

When questioned about the

payments to himself of per diem, MOUSSEAU stated these

were for trips which he had made all through the Black

Hills and to the Rosebud Reservation where he was advertising

the Sun Dance, putting up posters, looking for ideas, etc.

He was unable

to provide any information or documentation

as to the dates of these trips, the times involved, or

exactly what each trip was for. He was unable to relate

checks to specific dates.

When questioned as to the

$250 check received by him for "operating expenses and

advertising", MOUSSEAU was unable to provide any coucrete

information

in support of this item.

He stated that he

paid people to advertise the Sun Dance and to talk it up

at Pow Wows; these were Toka Indians who were paid amounts

of $5, $10,

or $15 depending on how big the pow wow was.

MOUSSEAU gave these people cash and did not obtain receipts.

He was unable to name any of the people who obtained this

тодеу.

He further stated this check was to cover use of

his car for advertising, which was not included in the

per diem payments.

When questioned about the amount of

$os noted as being for "technical assistance" MOUSSEAU

his pay for running the sun Dance. At this point MOUSSEAU

stated it is his belief the Executive Committee of the tribe

took action two or three weeks before the Sun Dance in

which the Sun Dance Committee would "pay for everything".

In regard to the four tires purchased from

Pine Ridge Husky Service Station, MOUSSEAU admitted these

tires were placed on his car.

He said it was his understanding

that they would be on his regular bill. However,

MOUSSEAU

did admit that he reviewed the charge slips submitted by

Husky Service Station to the Sun Donce and had seen the

charges for the tires. However, he paid the bill from the

Sun Dance fund anyway.

In prior years he had received about $150.

In the years before 1969, a Sun Dance Board of three

people ran the Sun. Dance rather than one director.

ROBERT MOSSEAU had asked him to set up a

booster trip to Rapid City to put on a program to

advertise the Sun Dance.

APPLE got a group of people

together and went to Rapid City using tribal vehicles,

a Government car, and a private car. There vere possibly

two Government vehicles involved.

MOSSEAU directed APPLE

Prisoner labor was also used for about a week to clean

The prisoners were provided

meals at noon each day

and sometimes lunch in the evening

by Mrs. MOSSEAU.

These numbered anywhere from three to

The chief

tribal judge had stated any prisoner who worked on the

RICHARD A.

WILSON, Pine Ridge, South Dakota,

was interviewed in the Pine

Station in the presence of Police Lieutenant FRED TWO BULLS.

He was advised of the official identity of the interviewing

agent and was advised that the nature of the interview was

concerning the embezzlement of tribal funds. WILSON

was advised of his constitutional rights by presentation

of an Advice of Rights Form. After reading this form,

he agreed to waive his rights and signed a Waiver of.

Rights form. WILSON provided the following information:

The tribal council took action to permit JACK STEELE

to put on a rodeo in conjunction with the annual Sun Dance.

He was to provide and install equipment etc.

The tribe

was to get twenty-five percent of the profits and STeELE,

seventy-five percent. After this had been agreed to,

the tribe included advertisements for the rodeo or stampede

on the posters and advertisements for the Sun Dance.

STEELE had located the needed equipment in

Sioux Falls. The tribe bought this eguipment on a lease

arrangement as STEELE was not able to come up with the

money to purchase it on his own.

The equipment came

from Dakota Leasing, who also gave the Oglala Sioux Tribe

$600 which was added to the amount of lease to bring the

entire agreement up to $2500.

The committee needed the

additional $600 for fences and other expenses.

Since the tribe bought the equipment, the

committee

felt the deal should be the tribe receiving

seventy-five percent and STEELE twenty-five percent.

STEELE had apparently made an additional deal for use

of very expensive bulls at the rodeo and wanted more

money to handle this increased cost.

About thirteen days before the show was to be

put on a meeting was held.

STEELE could not be pinned

down by the members of the committee regarding the contract.

The committee then agreed with JACK POURIER that he would

provide the stock for the rodeo and split 50 - 50 with the

tribe for expenses. At this meeting the committee elected officers.

The expenses which were to be taken off the

receipts prior to the 50 - 50 split with JACK POURIER

were chutes, help, gate men,

announcers, wages of other

people working at the grounds, and beer. WILSON denied

any knowledge of financial transactions

or transfer

of funds from the Sun Dance to the Stampede.

WILSON stated the $100 he received for material

was for supplying planks for use on the calf chute.

These planks had come out of an old dining room on

reservation and were given to WILSON for plumbing work

he did for JOE JANIS. WILSON has had the planks at his

home for at least five years. At this point he displayed

his pay check number one dated July 27, 1969; payable to

CHARLES QUIVER, in the amount of $31.50, for 70 cedar

posts.

When questioned about per diem expenses he received

from the Sun Dance, he stated he was in Sioux Falls

approximately three

to four days and received $60. He

took two trips to load the chutes etc.

which were used

at the rodeo. He has no knowledge of

the other item

for $25.

the tribe and a voucher submitted later for payment.

information:

As a sideline he is in the business of promoting

rodeos and providing stock for use in rodeos.

He had obtained

approval from the Oglala Sioux Tribal Council to run a rodeo

in connection with the annual Sun Dance to be held in 1969.

STEELE stated he has a partner who usually works with him in

these events who is CHARLIE KRAMER of Chadron, Nebraska.

Approximately a week or a little longer before the

Sun Dance, STEELE

and KRAMER attended a meeting for the purpose

of getting the rodeo organized. This meeting may have occurred

approximately at the end of July.

Present at this meeting were

DICK WILSON, JACK POURTER, DAVE POURIER, LLOYD TWISS, and

"JUNIOR" TWISS. BOB MOUSSEAU was not present.

STEELE and KRAMER did not like the deal which was

offered to them by the committee.

They wanted 75 per cent of

the proceeds with 25 per cent going to the Tribe. For the 75

per cent, STEELE was to provide the stock, get cowboys, handle

the advertising, etc. The 75 per cent is

his usual fee.

STEELE and KRAMER for 50 per cent.

They did not like this cut

and left the meeting to talk the matter over. They went to a

bar in White Clay, Nebraska, in order to discuss the matter and to

have lunch.

While they were in the bar, DICK WILSON arrived and

told STEELE it was all over and they were out -- that someone

else would handle the rodeo.

STEELE understands the matter was settled for a

50-50 split with JACK POURIER.

NOTE: Dick Wilson advises he has received complaints concerning

a lack of investigations made against non-Indians who are alleged

to have committed crimes against Indians. He belleves part of

the fault lies with the Agent assigned to investigate these cases

inasmuch as he believes this Agent has been assigned there too

long.

The two letters that were enclosed to his letter appears

to relate to the same case wherein 3 calves were stolen by a

non-Indian on the Pine Ridge Reservation and the U. S. Attorney

apparently failed to prosecute the person responsible. Bureau

indices reffect that Wilson may be identical to Orlin Wayne Wilson,

aka, subject of Bufile 89-140, who together with other sioux

Indians in October, 1954, were arrested for assaulting 3 members

of the U. S. Indian Service, Pine Ridge, South Dakota.

Wilson and others were subsequently indicted by the Federal

Grand Jury, Omaha, Nebraska; however, the indictment against

him was dismissed

in May, 1956. Minneapolis being instructed

to contact Wilson for specifics referred to in his letter and

to advise the Bureau by COB 9/15/72, results of contact.

Dear Mr. Clayion:

I have every season to believe that the handling of major crimes on

the Pine Ridge Reservation by your office including the proper investig-

ative, case building procedure, and prosecution has been far irom adequate.

I am particulariy concerned because of my personal experience with the

hit and sun death of my father ana your failure to get a conviction oi the

man responsible and nor ine theit of his cattie.

You may recail in a

special session of the United Siour Tribes at Pine Riage, Souin Darova jaut

prosecute complaints of Indian câtülemen.

Let me describe to you facts regarding the handling

theft of caives

from my father's estate, which in my estimation is a disgrace to ine viroie

Federal

systen of law.

1.

Three calves were stolen irom my father's estate on or about

Juiy 5, 1.972.

2. Only july 6, 1972, Billy anà Danny Grooms sold four caives at

the Gordon, rebraska sales ring.

3. One oi the four calves had my fathers brana on it (USO RR). The

other calves were slich, i.e. no brands.

4. The brand inspecior held up the check of the branded cali. Ine

others were sola ana checx receivea.

5. On July 8, 1972, Une Pine Ridge Tribal Doiice called my home.

6. Late on July 8, 1912, my vida cailed ma st Denver, coloraio,

where I was atuending a business meeting.

•7.

I drove to Nanderson, South Dakota, contacted a Tribai Dorca

officer .. ne picked me in on July a, 1972 and ve drova to

asked me if i wanted the call or the money.

I respondca

Ihree weeks after the theit, I finally receivea a call iron

wants to talk to you.

Ine investigator asiceà ii I tolid

These are the facts. Now I would like to submit to you my opinion.

A. Investigative procedure:

1.

Because the theit of Indian cattle by white-men on the

reservation is a common occurance, and because prosecutior

has süch a poor record of convictions - I suggest a

special program to train reuerer law enzorcement. Officers

or that ma did PIA on now to investisate cattle rustine.

i suggest training in evary area o

investigation.

2.

I further suggest that BIA law inforcement officers be

removed from line authority of Agency, and Ares offices an?

that they function only out of a centrai office independent

of polivical control.

3.

against Indians.

. B.

Prosecution:

1. I suggest the U.S. Attorney's office request irom the

Federal. Government an adequate buâget to efrecü a reasoradie

approach to prosecution.

2.

I susgest thai jurors in federal court be Indians fron tra

reservations vhere the crime is comitiea.

c.

Finally and above all I woula suggest scraning tre whole syste

with action by congress to set up a Najor Indian Crimes Justice

system using Iribai juages and courts inciuding the prosecution

wnite-men on Indian reservations by Indian counts. Waür powers

by trival courts do convict non-indians to faderal prisces.

In sumary, I do nope you fuitial your commission as ü. S. Attorney in fois

matter of prosecuting the theives no are a menace to Indian socieu.

Dear Sir:

Regarding the theft of your cattle by a white

man on a "closed"

portion of the Pine Riage Reservation,

it is clear that the

U.S.

Attorney has jurisdiction to

prosecute the thier.

Section 1152 of Title 18 of the

U.S. Code provides

that the general laws of the United

States as

to the punishment of offenses committed within

the exclusive jurisciction of une united states shall

extena to Indian country.

Section 13 of that Title

provides that the laus of the suates

are incorporated into

federal law for areas witnin federa jurisdiction.

fore, the soush Dakota laws with respect to larceny and

burglary are applicable to indian country and are to be

applied by tne

federal prosecutor. There is no doubt

that Section 1152 applies to crimes committed by non-

Indians against indians in Indian country:

See, e.g.,

Acunia v. Unitea States, 404 E. 2à 140, 141 (9th Cir.

1968).

It is also clear hat the state prosecutor has

no jurisdiction over crimes ecumitted by non-Indians

against Indians on the

"ciosed" portion of the Pine Ridge

Reservation.

The Solin Dakota Supreme Court has held trai

such areas are

within the axclusive jurisdiction and autho-

rity of the United Staies. In re liieh Pine, 78 S.D. 121,

99 N.W. 2à 38 (1959):

Thus, 11 the ü.S. Attorney jaiis to pecsacute the

thiei, it amounis to no less

than a shirking of his cuty.

Keep an eye on his conduct during the case, and let us kno

if you are dissatisfied with

his prosecution of the mauver.

Very trily yours,

...I:. t

and SWIFT BIRD then went home.

YOUNG continued that he, JONES and JACK then arove the police

car to his iouse and started to go in for a cup of coffee when he

saw a car turning at the stop sign on liain Street going east.

He

turned the corner so he, JONES and JACK got back in the police

car and started after them. He saw the car parked in front of

the Lone Dog Cafe in Pine Ridge; however, when they got up with

them, the WILSON car took off on United States Highway 18 going

east. They chased the subjects car; however, the police car was

not functioning properly so they gave up the

chase, turned around

and started back to fine Ridge to get DENNIS LI COMPTE and his

automobile.

The WILSON car also turned around and followed to

the parking area in the rear of Le CoMPt's house.

When the

WILSON car came up behind them, he and JONES walked back to the

WILSON car and he asked DICK WILSON, who was driving, what he was

pulling off as he was putting himself and YOUNG on the spot.

DICK

WILSON dia not answer and YOUNG started back to the police car.

He then heard DICK WILSON tell JONES to get the light out of his

lace but could not hear any more of the conversation. JONES

came back to the police ca and YOUNG told JONES and JACK to go

get LE COMPTE and SWIFT BIRD.

The WILSON car then backed up

and someone said, "Go get DENNIS LE COMPTE and the rest of your

cops".

The WILSON car then left.

YOUNG continued that JONES and JACk returned to the car with JOE

SWIFT BIRD and the four of them then drove to the police station

and parked the car.

JACK then lifted the hood and started

messing with the motor and SWIFT BIRD went inside to make a phone

call. The WILSON car stopped on the highway in front of the

police station and were cursing JONES in loud voices.

He and

JONES started to get out of the car and the WILSON automobile then

left again.

A few minutes later, DENNIS LE COMPIE drove up in his Government

automobile and

a few seconds later the WILSON car again passed

the station going north. DENNIS, SWIFT BIRD and JONES chased

them in LE COMPTE's car and he drove the police car around town.

WILSON car.

They caught up with the WILsoN car just prior to

reaching the Nebraska State Line; however, DICK WILSON weaved his

car back and forth preventing the police car from coming abreast

witn them.

LE COKPTE turned on the siren and the WILSON car then

stopped and all of the occupants of the wILSON car got out, as

aid the police officers. LEROY JANIS started after DENNIS

LE

COMPTE and DONALD JANIS and ROBERT WHALEN came after him. They

almost knocking him to the ground.

He again pulled his

revolver and by then DICK WILSON

load it so DICK WILSON drew back to hit him and he then pushed

DICK WILSON away and shot him twice with .38 caliber tear gas

DICK WILSON went down and LEROY JANIS rushed up and hit

YOUNG with his fist. YOUNG then was surrounded by LEROY JANIS,

DONALD JANIS and ROBERT WHALEN and he was trying to hold them off

with his revolver anâ asked LE COMPTE if he should shoot one of

them.

He told them that there were no more gas shells in his

gun and that the rest were lead bullets so they then backed down.

YOUNG continued that things then quieted down and the subjects

got back in their car and he, SWIFT BIRD and JONES got in

police car, drove about a block down the highway, turned around

and then parked directly across the road from the WiLSON car.

He stated that just about then GEORGE WILSON drove up, walked to

the JIM WILSON car and the next thing that he saw, GEORGE WILSON

was at the window of the police car. GEORGE WILSON then struck

at JONES through the window, breaking the window of the Goverrment

automobile. JNES then said something to the effect of let's get

them, so JONES opened the door and got out.

As YOUNG opened the

other front door, DONALD and LEROY JANIS grabbed him and ROBERT

WHALEN got him from the driver's side. LEROY grabbed YOUNG's

revolver from his hand and RosErr and

DONALD JANIS held him and

hit him several times. He stated that he must have passea out

YOUNG stated that he definitely was not drinking any alcoholic

beverage nor were any of the other police officers.

He stated

he does not know whether the subjects were intoxicated nor does

he have any proof they were drinking. The only thing in this

regard was

the fact that he saw the empty beer cans being thrown

from the WILSON car when they were chasing it from Pine Ridge to

white Clay, Nebraska.

Interview with Eye Witness

Mr. GORDON JAMES JONES, a volunteer Deputy Tribal Policeman, was

interviewed by the writer in the presence of Special Officer

DENNIS LE COMPTE on October 21, 1954, and furnished the following

information concerning his

recollection of the events happening

on October 16, 1954:

JONES stated thet he came on duty at approximately 6:00 p.m. on

October 15, 1954, and was cruising in the police car with SIDNEY

YOUNG and LEONARD JACK.

At approximately 8:00 p.m., he saw JIM

that she had been knifed by

her husband. He, YOUNG and JACK took Mrs. SITTING HOLY to the

Pine Ridge Indian Hospital and YOUNG then called JOSEPH SWIFT

while later, SWIFT BIRD came to the hospital and talked to Mrs.

SITTING HOLY, the nurse on duty on Dr. RUBY. de and SWIFT BIRD

then drove back to Pine Ridge in SWIFT BIRD's car and YOUNG and

JACK came to Pine Ridge in the police car. Mrs. TYON then came

to the station and said that she had seen GEORGE SITTING HOLY

going toward white Clay, Nebraska. The four got in the police

car and drove to white Clay looking for SITTING HOLY; however,

they did not find him so they drove to the white clay rodeo

grounds and saw a car parked there. He thought, at that time,

it was JI! WILSON's car but was not sure.

They

then went through

Pine Ride and back to where GEORGE SITTING HOLY WaS living, which

was about six miles northwest of Pine Ridge. They arrested GEORGE

SITTING HOLY and brought him to the police station and then booked

him.

SWIT BIRD went home shortly thereafter and he, YOUNG and

JACK started patroling the town again. They stopped at YOUNG's

house and were almost in the house when he heard a car speeding

so they then got back in the car.

They

caught up with this car

in front of the Lone Dog Cale where it had stopped; however, it

pulled out when they got there and headed east on Highway 1S.

They got up even with the car but could not pass it so YOUNG

turned the police car around and they started back for Pine Ridge.

The other car went about 100 yards,

stopped and also turned around.

They then arove to DENNIS In COMPlE's house to get ahother car

to help them and the subjects followed and pulled up behind

He and YOING walked back to the subjects'

car and he shined a light in the car and YOUNG said something to

the subjects to the effect that they ought to know better than

that and they replied with a question as to why the cops were

He and YOUNG then walked back to the police car

and the subjects cursed them and were using loud and obscene

language. YoUNG told him to get DENNIS LI COMPTE and SWIFT BIRD

to help them. He and

• JACK started after DENNIS and SWIFT BIRD and

sus jects were honking the horn and racing their motor.

JONEs continued that they got SWIFT BIRD and when they returned

to the car, the subjects were gone.

SWIFT BIRD got in the car

with them

and drove back to the police station and tried to fina

out what was wrong with the police car, which was not operating

correctly. SWIFT BIRD went inside the

police station to make

telephone call and he and YOUNG stayed in the car.

The subjects

drove by, stopped in the midale of the road and again cursed he

and YOUNG and as he and

YOUNG got out of the car, the subjects

drove south on highway 18. SWIFT BIRD then came out of the

police station and DENNIS LE COMPTE drove up.

They saw

a car

come north through

the stop sign with no lights and recognized

it as the subjects' car.

When it passed the station, he, LE

COMPTE and SWIFT BIRD got in the police car and tried to catch

They followed for about five miles and when they could not

catch them, turned around and started toward fine Ridge.

JONES then saw a car following so LE COMPTE pulled off the roaa

and waited until the car passed to be sure it was the subjects.

When it was determined that it was the WILSON car, they started

after them again and when they arrived at the stop sign, YOUNG

was there, so he got in the car with them.

They drove for

approximately one-quarter of a mile and saw the subjects parked

with their lights off; however, they started up again when they

saw the police car coming. He continued that they caught up

with the

subjects just at the State line and turned the siren on

so the subjects stopped. All the parties got out of both cars

and ROBERT WHALEN and Mrs. DICK WILSON came up to JONES, who had

a blackjack in his hand.

Both said something to the effect that

he was not to do anything and there would not be any trouble. At

that time, DENNIS LE COMPlE was talking to LEROY JANIS. There

was talking for a short time and then he heard two shots, turned

and ran in that direction and saw DICK WILSON fall in a ditch

about 15 yards in front of LE COMPlE's car. He then saw DONALD

JANIS and ROBERT WHALEN remove their shirts and they were trying

to get at officer YOUNG. JONES and SWIFT BIRD tried to get between

them and WHALEN finally

• said that they would quit if YCUNG would

out away his gun, which YOUNG did. JONES stated that he is not

positive but believes that one of them then hit YOUNG as YOUNG

pulled his gun again and asked LE COMPTE if he should shoot.

YoUNG finally put his revolver away and came to the car along with

SWIFT BIRD and they locked the doors and rolled up the windows.

JONES

continued that at this point everything was calm and no

one was fighting so JONES drove LE COMPTE's car down the road,

turned it around

and parked it directly across the highway from

the subjects' car. He, SWIFT BIRD and YOUNG were sitting there

When GEORGE WILSON drove up.

DENNIS had all of the subjects in

their car, except Mrs. WILSON, when GEORGI WILSON drove up.

GEORGE

wIlson then went to the subjects' car and shortly thereaiter,

CEORGE WILSON and the other

subjects started for LE coMple's

car.

GEORGE WILSON came to the driver's side of the police car and

swung his fist, breaking the window on the driver's side, his

entire arm going through the window. JONES stated that he then

opened the

door, jumped out and started wrestling with GEORGE

WILSON. When WILSON started using his fists, he then hit WILSON

and knocked him down.

He also fell down and one of the subjects

then jumped on him and started hitting him with his fists.

DENNIS LE COMPTE then pulled this man off of him and started for

LE COMPTE's car, where he could see fists flying at YOUNG. As he

reached the rear of the car, LEROY JANIS came for him and the

next thing he knew, he was on the ground and LEROY JANIS had his

knee in his stomache and JANIS swung again with a revolver, which

he had in his hand, hitting JONES again in the head. LEROY JANIS

had the gun pointed out at his head

and he started

rolling to get

away from him.

someone then pulled JANIs off of him and JONES

then started north down the highway toward white Clay, Nebraska,

for hlep. He met SWIFT BIRD later at Kelly Coon's house, where

they tried to get help; however, no one would answer their door.

He and SWIFT' BIRD started walking to Pine Ridge and he, JONES,

passed out in a field. When he came to,

no one was around

and someone said, "It's the cops, stop the car"

, so they stopped.

but he does recall participating in it. He stated that he also

remembers getting SIDNEY YOUNG'S

revolver out of the police car;

however, he does not recall hitting anyone with it. LEROY JANIS

ground but did not see who had hit him. YOUNG came off the

ground with his revolver in his hand so DICK WILSON grabbed him

by the cross strap of his sambrowne belt and was telling him to

put the gun away.

JANIS stated that he heard two shots and saw

DICK WILSON fall

YOUNG with his fist. He does not recall how the fight broke up;

however, everyone then got back in their own automobiles.

the highway for a short distance, turned aroind and came back and

parked just across the street from the WILSON car and were facing

north.

over to the WILSON car and asked what had happened. DICK WILSON

said he had gotten shot so GEORGE walked across the road and he,

WHALEN and LEROY followed a few seconds later. He then saw

GEORGE swing his fist through the window of the police car and he

and LEROY ran around to the other side. of the car. WHALEN got in

the police car from the driver's side and he and LEROY were fight-

ing with ICUNG,

who was still in the front seat of the car.

LEROY took YOUNG's gun away from him and got out of the way, so

DONALD took his place and was staking YOUNG as was WiALEN.

GEORGE's wife and DICK's wife came and pulled DONALD aNd WHALEN

away from YOUNG and then

went over to the WILSON car. He did not

see LEROY strike JONES with the pistol.

He then looked around

the only police officer there was LE COMPTE and the figt was

"When we arrived at the scene the police car was parked

directly across the road was my fathers car pointing

Jones came out of the car

and he and I fought.

Either Jones hit me or I fell

ono set of braids to give to my country."

It is noted that only one witness was present due

to the unavailability of other Special Agent personnel.

JOSEPH FRANCIS MERRIVAL was contacted at his residence;

993 Douglas Drive, and advised of the identity of the inter-

viewing agents and that investigation was being conducted

regarding an attack on RUSSELL MEANS and GARY THOMAS in the

Sioux Nation Shopping Center on February 27, 1973.

He was

advised of his rights by Special Agent CARPER as set forth on

a form captioned "Interrogation; Advice of Rights", which ha

underero, and ei evade

read, stated he understood, and signed.

He advised that on the day in question, he and his wife,

GERTRUDE, were visiting at EARL DEON's house, and also present

were GLEN THREE STARS, ELMER WINTERS, PETE MERRIVAL, and DEON.

He and his wife advised they were leaving the residence to go

to'the Sioux Nation Shopping Center, at which. time the other

received word that some "outsiders" were at the Center.

MERRIVAL stated "outsiders" is the term used by Indians

residing in the Pine Ridge, South Dakota,

area for other

Indians and non-Indians who have been coming into the area of

the reservation and causing problems such as occurred at Custer

the first of the year.

He and his wife drove in their automobile to the Sioux

Nation store and went inside for approximately five to ten

minutes, and when they came out they observed DEON, WINTERS,

THREE STARS, and PETE MERRIVAL talking to two individuals in

a

car in the shopping center.

The car backed up from the parking

place, at which time DEON was yelling something to the occupants

of the car to the effect that "If you want to start trouble,

why don't you start with me." The dar then drove from the

shopping center,

and he and his wife left, and he believed the

other four individuals got. into a car and also left.

He was later charged with assaulting MEANS, as was THREE

STARS,

and they appeared in court where the charges were dis-

missed due to lack of evidence.

STARS, WINTERS, DEON, and PETE MERRIVAL had approached these

two individuals, and he feels the whole nature of their contact

was strictly to tell the outsiders to. leave town.

MERRIVAL stated he did not desire to furnish a signed

statement regarding the above as he is presently free on bail

in connection with an assault on a police officer in Pine Ridge.

He stated the reason he. left Pine Ridge was because he felt if

standing. I greeted WILSON and so dia GARY THOMAS.

As WILSON approached us, he slowly took off his

sunglasses and said to THOMAS, 'Do you want a piece of

me, you son-of-a-bitch.' THOMAS said that he did not

want any trouble with WILSON. WILSON then came forward,

again repeated his phrase and started raising his voice.

There were several newspaper and media people in the

vicinity and they gathered around. RICHARD MULLER Of

KELO TV, Sioux Falls was there as was some man from

the Associated Press outside South Dakota_ as well as one

of the Denver, COlorado television station news bureaus.

WILSON told THOMAS that he, THOMAS, had until 8:30 A.M.

the following morning to get off the Pine Ridge

Reservation or he would turn his goons loose on THOMAS.

I interrupted WILSON and tried to make small talk,

because all of the media people were starting to let

the cameras roll, etc.

WILSON said to THOMAS, 'You

son-of-a-bitch, you swore at me yesterday, and now

I am promising

you that if you are not off of this

reservation by 8:00 A.M. tomorrow my goons will

kill you. This is not a threat, it is a promise.'

"WII.SON further remarked that THOMAS and the

other attorney, the 'Mexican, chile bean bastara,

Mario Gonzelas - had caused enough trouble on the

Pine Ridge.

"About this point in time, Mrs. WILSON came forward

and started to push THOMAS around telling him that he

had threatened her husband, and that she would take care

. of THOMAS if her husband didn't. By this time a large

crowd had gathered and was watching the incident.

continued to hang around with AlM militants like MeANs

he wanted him off the Reservation and wanted him off

the Reservation now.

GROSSENBURG said the term "

context and does not recall that WIISON said that his

goons"

would kill anyone.

GROSSENBURG believes that

the subject of goons was brought up either by JANKLOW or

or possibly by himself,

Inasmuch as all were

engaged In a heated argument and that Mes. WILSON also

Joined in the discussion, using profanity and making

wild statements, the exact nature of which GROSSENBURG

cannot recall.

GROSSENBURG further stated that he did not

feel any danger himself from WILSON or feel that THOMAS

seriously considered himself in any danger, but it was

a heated argumeni and yelling contest with high tempers

on both sides, and as a result, he does not remember any

exact statements made by anyone in the argument.

He recalled that JANKLOW quieted WILSON down

and eventually he, THOMAS, and JANKLOW drove away, without

any further altercation with the WILSONs.

my hone. My home is in Pushville. I sas going to

my office in Pine Ridge and consented to give them

a ride. At approximately 2:30 Polle we stopped at

the sioux Nation store in Pine Ridge RUSSELI. MEANS

entered the store to buy a paper. He returned

approximately five minutes later. A woman named

ROSE BULL BEAR from Kyle came up to the car and

conversed with MEANS. During the conversation an

Indian male came up to the car wearing a cowboy hat.

He approached the driver's side and looked in.

I

asked if I could help him. The man shook his head

and went back into the store. ROSE continued talking

tO MEANS. Within a couple of minutes approximately

five males came out of the store. The man in the

cowboy hat came with them. One or two men came up

to the driver's side, the others to MEANS' side. I

locked the door, rolled up the window, and started

the engine in order to back away. Simultaneously,

the men on MEANS* side shoved ROSE away and directed

a couple of blows at MEANS. Some of the men asked,

"MEANS, are you causing trouble in the sioux Nation Store?"

MEANS sustained a lip injury which was bleeding. I

aid not observe any other injuries.

"I do not know if MEANS had trouble in the store.

He said he had a conversation with an elderly person

but seened surprised when the men attacked.

"Afterward, ve proceeded to Calico Village. I

Let MEANS and the CONROY girl out of my vehicle at

approximately 3 poll. MEANS did not indicate his

destination. He had not mentioned Wounded Knee at

all prior to this time. I was not aware of any planned

trouble there and did not learn of the take over until

7=30 or 8 p.Ml. that same day.

"After letting MEANS and CONROY out of the

car I went to Pine Ridge io the BIA building to

seek a U. S. Marshal or an FBI agent to report the

Incident.

My purpose was to advise them because I

thought MEANs might get angiy and retum with a mob.

MEANs did not indicate he was angry but rather said

he would sign a complaint. He told me of the

identities of two men involved in the attack. I

did not know any of them.

The two he named were

JOE MERRIVAL and GLENN THREE STARS. MEANS said they

were friends of DICK WIISON'S. At the BIA building

I spoke to an unknown parson on the U. S. Marshal's

staffe

He suggested I sign a complaint against the

men. I discussed the matter with "SKI" JACOBS,

Captain of police and afterward did sign a complaint

against MERRIVAL and THREE STARS. I do not know if

MoANs ever did.

"For several months I had heard rumors at Pine

Ridge concerning a "goon squad" supposedly hired by

DICK WILSON. The rumors also. stated that these

people were paid with approximataly $65,000 obtained

through the area office.

"In February, 1973, during the attempted impeach-

ment of WILSON there were several U. S. Marshal's at

Pine Ridge. I spoke to REIS R. KASH Of the Marshal's

service who stated in effect that he was surprised and

displeased to learn that there was a

"goon squad" on

the reservation. He ordered that no. more federal

monies be paid to these men and dismantled the group

because their existence contributed to the anxiety of

the situation. This is the first word from an official

17

## Page 325

MP 44-696

MP 44-598

source I geceived concerning the existence of a

"goon squad." I had heard runors but do not know

of specific instances where people were intimidated.

Everything was hearsay. I never checked out the

stories personally. For example, rumor had it that

ELLEN MOOSE CAMP, Trailer Court, Pine Ridge, had her

trailer entered and ransacked by the "goon squad."

LILLIAN RICHARDS, Secretary, Tribal Office, allegedly

was beaten by "goon squad"

and required hospitilization.

A house belonging to YELLOW BOY was supposedly burned

in North Ridge by the "goon squad!" because he housed

out of state people in his home. FRANK FOOLS CROW'S

house was allegedly entered and he and his family

threatened by the "goon squad."

I heard also that

some of the men were funded by Manpower.

"I have no other information except on February

28, 1973, I picked up an attorney, BILL JANKLOW from

Pierre at the airport. We were accompanied by another

attorney, MICK GROSENBERG, States Attorney, Winner.

BILL was looking for his client's mother, Mrs. BLACK

FEATHER. I drove them around town. While standing

in front of the Pine Ridge courthouse, DICK WILSON

approached me. He said "If you're here past 8:30

in the morning I'll have you killed." The other

attorneys heard the threat.. I spoke to WILSON many

times while working at Legal Aid Services. Our office

had some conflict with WILSON. We tried to tell him

we were not involved in partisan politics.

However

once he said we were either for him or against him.

Since so many AIM members came to our office he

apparently felt we were on their side. I felt he

might also have learned of MEANS visit to my home

and this might have brought on the threat.

OSCAR HOTLOW HORN, a resident of Wounded Knee, South Dalenta,

advised that he had been empload by the Office of Economic Conortunity, and

had been in charge of cocminating numerous community programs, and that he

had a personal staff, and dirnotly sunervised the staffs of each of these

coordinater prorrams,

Other than this information, HOLLOW HORN was unable

to provide a very complete descrintion of his activities or the nature of

his official duties,

The mein reason for this inability was his very apparent

lack of recollection.

HOLLOW HORN stated that he had never signed any petition calling

for the ouster of Tribal Officers, and the only list he can recall having

signed at any time was a list of names passed around at his aunt's wake.

The rake was in January, 1973.

HOLLOW HOPN was asked when his employment

was terminated, and he was unable to recall. Furthermore, he was unable

to recall whether his employment, was terminated before of after his aunt's

wake,

HOLLOW HORN was unable to provide any details regarding the reason

for his termination, excent to state that he was having some trouble atterding

staff mentings during the Woumed. Knee occuration, although he was free to

come and go as he pleages.,

HOLLOW HORN then stated that he had been placed on

a two-weet suspension after hoving received an oral arning, and he believed that

this suspension mas haced on his failure to atterd staff meetings bocause

there has been some inference to his annarent lock of interest in his job.

He did rot recall. if this reference was made during the pral warning by his

superiors or apneared in print.

He could not recall when this suspension

occurred, and eventually stated that he felt it may have occurred before the

Wounded Knee occupation, He has never anpeated this setion, because the idea

never occurrer to him to do so.

He does not anticipate making an anneal in the

future. Ho does not feel that there was discrimination directed at him, bat

at the same time, felt that his termination was unfair. His reason for feeling

it was unfair was that it was besed upon circumstances beyord his control,

namely, the inability to maintain a permanent residence neer his work, particularly

during the Hounded Knee occupation.

No more detailed information other than that set forth could be

obtained from HOLLOW HORN, because all of his recollections of pertinent

details

ware varue and disoriented.

HOLLOW HORN was not requested to

provide

a signed staterent to any of the information he provided. He stated

that he knew nothing of the case involving CHRADINE JANIS, and, therefore,

would have no testimony of value to offer in that matter,

ALVIN ZEPHIER, Employment Supervisor, ORlala Sioux Tribal Conneil,

Pine Ridge, South Dakota, advised that he had been a member of the Oglala

Sioux Tribe Personnel Policies Board, which is better known as the Evaluation

Committee, since June, 1972. His term of office lasted until April, 1973.

ZEPHIER advised that he was requesied to volunteer his services with no

remneration as a member of the Evaluation Committee, ard this rarest came

from the Executive Board of the Oglaia Sioux Tribe,

The sole purpose of the

Executive Committee is to insure that when job vacancies ocour, ail applicants

for the vacancies are fairly and equitably considered, and that no favoritism

or discrimination is shown in filling available jobs.

ZEPHIER stated that the

committee was originally formed as a reaction to wide-spread complaints by

members of the tribe to the effect that discrimination, favoritism, and

nepotism

were being practiced with regard to hiring of new personnel.

The committee has no authority to make recommendations or take any type of

action in promotions, demotions, or terminations. The committee has no real

appellate authority with regard to employee grievances or terminations.

ZEPHIER resigned fcom the committee after serving only ten months,

mainly because of threatening phone calls he had received from the irate father

of an applicant who did not get a job.

When the committee was originally

formed, it set up certain grading standards whereby each prospective applicant

coula

be numerically rated on the basis of the screening of his application

by members of the Executive Cormittee. The rating standans established by the

committee are the only formal guidelines or regulations governing the activities

of the committee. ZEPHIER advised that although the original request for his

services had been made by the Executive Board of the tribe, he believes the

exotro some on the

establishment of the committee was approved by resolution; of the Triba

Council.

In April, 1973, GERALDINE JANIS, a former employee of the Community

Health Representative Services of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, was fixed by action

of the Executive Road. The reason for this termination was JANIS' voCal

adiscation of the overthrow of the tribal government. This situation was

compounded by JANIS' activities, which included marching in demonstrations

and meeting with dissidents during workins, hours, having submitted no annual

Leave slips in connection with these activities. JANIS requested that the

Evaluation Committee hear an appeal regarding her termination and althouch the

committee made it clear that it did not have appellate authority in this matter,

it finally agreed to hear the case presented by JANIS and her attorney, whose

name is unrecalled. At the time, JANIS appeared to be mainly concerned with

being paid for the annual leave that she had accrued up to the time of her

termination. However, the Executive Board was in the process of determinine

the amount of time that JANIS had spent in non-employment related activities

during working hours, so that her annual. leave balance could be appropriately

adjusted prior to comouting termination ray.

The decision of the Evalvation Committee was to disquality itself

from rendering a decision, and also to stand by the action of the Executive

Board in this matter.

ZEPHIER was personally present only for the first half of this

hearing, having nressing business in Rushville, Nebraska, and he set out to

attend to this business at the lunch-time adjournment of the hearing. He

consequently was not present for the final decision, but is in favor of

the action, and would

have voted with the committee in their decision,

ZEPHIER feels that the termination of JANIS was necessary, and

that at no time did he ever

suspect any unfair or purely discriminatory

attitudes or practices on the part of the Executive Boent or the Evaluation

Committee in their decisions

involving JANIS,

Recause of pressin? busines, and the inconvenience of the circim

stances in atterdine this interview, ZEPHIER was unable to provide a signed

statement, but stated that he would be very willing to testify at a hearing

iI necessary.

Date of transcriplion October Z, 1973.

JOSEPH POURRIER, SR., Pine Ridge, South Dakota, advised that

he is one of five members of the Oglala Sioux Tribe Personnel Policies

Board, which is more comnonly known as the Evaluation Committee,

POURRIER has been with the Evaluation Connittee since February,

1972,

and he was selected for service on this committee by the Executive Board

of the Oglala Sioux Tribe:

"POUPRIOR and the other four nenlers were all asked If thay

would volunteer for service with this committee. In each instance, the

approach was made by a member of the Executive Board, and POURRIER

believes that the Evaluation Committee was approved by the Tribal

Council by means of a resolution,

The Evaluation Comnittee was established because of a series

of complaints by nembers of the tribe to the effect that discrimination,

favoritism, and nepotism were being practiced to a great extent in the

hiring of persons for Iribal jobs.

The committee has developed a system

for screening applications for available jobs and scoring all applicants

• for a job in an equitable manner so that the person most qualified to fit

the position opened is selected. The committee sets out a list of qualified

applicants for each job opening, listing the applicants by their rank and

the application evaluation. A number one person is therefore selected for

the job, but 1s subject to a 90 day probationary period during which time

the applicant can be fired as unsatisfactory in which case the number two

applicant on the list fox that position would be hired. The committee

makes no recommendations and takes no actions direct or indirect regarding

pronotions, demotions or terminations. Their activities are confined

strictly to insuring that fair and equitable hiring proceedures are followed:

within the Oglala Sioux Iribe.

POURRIER advised that he recalled the termination of GERALDINE

JANIS from her job as Community Health Services Representative and his

recollection was that she had been fired by the Executive Board of the

Oglala Sioux Irike because of her open defiance of the Executive Board, her

stated desires to overthrow the current Tribal Council and the faot that

she participated in many demonstrations, meetings, and conferences with

militant American Indian Hovenent (AIM) personnel during working hours, and

did not submit Annual Leave slips for these periods of time, POURRIAR

recalled that in April, 1973, JANIS appeared at the Evaluation Committee

hearing with a Fublic Defender, name unrecalled, for the purpose of repealing

her case. The committee had advised JANIS that the Executive Board was

and ALVIN ZUPHIER, noting that these three menbers of the committee

constituted a quorum.

Also present was GALVIN SHANGREAUX, tha Personnel

Director of the Oglala Sioux Irlbe. At the conclusion of

the hearing, the

committee voted unanimously to advise JANIS that the committee would dis-

qualify itself from making any recommendations on this case for reasons

previously stated.

POURRIER recalls that the main thrust of the JANIS appeal was

payment for accrued Annual Leave. However, at the time, ElMA WILSON, a

member of the Executive Board, was in the process of determining how

much on the job time was spent by JANIS in non-employment related activities

so that this time could be deducted on her balance of accrued Annual Leave

for the purpose of determining how much termination pay JANIS was entitled

to receive.

When he came back into the office I asked him what

was going on.

He said "Dick is the one that is

raising hell!! I went back to work then and worked

for the rest of the day.

"On July 25, 1973, I called Tony Fresquez and

told him

that

was not going to work because the

Board of Directors did not approve of me working

there at the College Center so I was

just going to

quit. Tony Fresquez told me that the Board of

Directors were having a meeting on August 9, 1973

to confirm the job as a bookkeeper for the College

Center. I did not go to this meeting on August 9,

1973 because I felt it wouldn't do any good to try

to get the job when Dick Wilson was on the board and

we were told several times that Dick Wilson was

going to get rid of us, (Lillian and I).

Fiscal Manager at the office of Economic Opportunity

could be given to one of Wilsons' supporters. The

ANTHONY JOSEPH FRESQUEZ was contacted at his

place of employment and after being advised of the

official identities of interviewing Agents, furnished

the following information:

FRESQUEZ advised that he preferred not to

furnish any signed statèment at this time but would

discuss the matter in detail with the interviewing

Agents.

FRESQUEZ advised he is Executive Coordinator

of the Lakota Higher Education Center, better known as

the College Center located at the Pine Ridge Indian

Reservation, Pine Ridge, South Dakota. FRESQUEZ advised

he has been

so employed

since July, 1971, and his local

address was Post Office Box 332, Pine Ridge, South Dakota.

FRESQUEZ advised with regard to the hiring and

firing of CARMEL MEANS as bookkeeper for the College

Center, he believed that MEANS was initially contacted

regarding the position of bookkeeper by FRANCIS KILLER,

who was a private accountant who the College Center con-

tracted to conduct an audit of their fiscal records during

the Summer of 1973.

FRESQUEZ advised that KILLER stated

that CARMEL MEANS was a bookkeeper and that the College

Center needed a permanent bookkeeper.

FRESQUEZ advised his initial contact with CARMEL

MEANS was when she telephonically contacted him regarding

the position of bookkeeper and he told her if she would

apply then she would have just as good a chance as anyone

who applied for a position.

FRESQUEZ stated MEANS subse-

quently submitted an application and approximately one

week later he telephoned her and advised her to come to

work. FRESQUEZ advised MEANS reported to work the following

Monday, July 23, 1973, and was employed until the morning

of July 26, 1973, when she telephoned him and advised that

she was resigning her position because she understood there

was some opposition to her working at the College Center.

FRESQUEZ advised the normal procedure for

hiring and tiring di College Center employees is lor

a Board of Directors consisting of eight members to

review each application and recommend who should be

hired.

FRESQUEZ continued by advising when a vacancy

needs to be filled, it is announced and the staff at

the College Center does the initial screening of all

the applicants and then this recommendation is relayed

to the Board of Directors. He advised approximately

80 per cent of the staff's recommendations are approved

by the Board of Directors.

With regard to CARMEL MEANS' employment,

FRESQUEZ advised Mr. JAMES HAMM, Acting Director for the

mentee Rest, advised Means was the best qualified

authorized him to offer MEANS employ-

applicant for the position and due to the urgency of the

job, she was hired

before the Board of Directors officially

met

and voiced their approval.

FRESQUEZ advised MEANS'

application would have been officially presented before

the Board of Directors at their next official meeting,

but that MEANS resigned prior to this happening.

FRESQUEZ

advised although MEANS' application was not officially

presented before the Board of Directors for approval prior

to her obtaining employment, this was not unusual as

several other employees had

been so hired by the College

Center.

FRESQUEZ advised he did not specifically state

for MEANS to terminate her employment with the Office of

Economic Opportunity (OEO) and apply for the bookkeeping

job at the college Center, but he probably implied that

in order for her to obtain the bookkeeping position she

would have to terminate her employment with OEO.

FRESQUEZ advised the position of bookkeeper at

the College Center is a merit job inasmuch as the Oglala

Sioux Tribe has a merit system.

FRESQUEZ stated no one instructed them (himself

and HAMM) to offer MEANS employment at the College Center.

time that the position would be temporary until such

time that the Board of Directors could officially neei

and approve her position. HAMM advised that MEANS

applied and came to work on a following Monday with the

understanding that her position was temporary until the

Board's approval.

HAMM advised that on about the third or fourth

day MEANS called TONY FRESQUEZ and told him she under-

stood that there were going to be problems concerning

her employment and,

therefore, she did not want the

position.

HAMM advised there was no written resignation

submitted since MEANS' position when hired was temporary.

He advised at the next Board of Directors meeting MEANS'

application was not submitted since she had resigned and

of the four or five other applicants the Board decided

none were qualified and to date the Center still does not

have a permanent bookkeeper.

HAMM advised he did not advise MEANS that she

was fired and that he tried to make it perfectly clear

at the time of her employment that the job was temporary

until such time that the Board could approve it.

HAMM advised that this hiring procedure was

normal in that the staff at the Center and the Board of

Directors had somewhat of a verbal understanding that the

Center could temporarily hire someone when the need dictated

it and the Board would act on that hiring at a later date.

HAMM advised the proper procedure for hiring

employees is that an announcement of a vacancy is made,

applicants make an application and then the Board of

staff at the College Center ordinarily makes some recom-

mendations but that the Board of Directors has the final

say in these matters.

HAMM advised to the best of his knowledge the

position of bookkeeper at the College Center is not con-

sidered a merit system position such as those used by the

Tribal Council.

He is not employed by the Burcau of Indian Arfairs

and has had his present position with the United States Public

Health Service since Januaiy, 1973.

He has never met GERALDINE JANIS, however, he knows

her through telephonic contact.

He recalls having telephonic conversation with

JANIS in which he discussed with her the matter of demonstrating.

He is certain that this call had as its purpose not the matter

of demonstrating, but some other reason, and he believes it was

concerning a contract amendment to enable the hiring of another

Community Health Representative.

The matter of demonstrating

was discussed as JANIS made inquiry about it. He advised her

that her activity while working within the contract under which

she was employed was of concern to the Goverment in that dur-

ing that time she should be working within the terms of the

contract at that time.

It is his understanding that JANIS and others had

been demonstrating in opposition to the general conditions on

the Reservation and not for the American Indian Movement or

against any particular Tribal Government.

the be coverene The commons teach s

-rogram is a contract program and is put into operatior

following a representation made by a Tribal Government show-

When this justification is sub-

If there are shortcomings' on the part of

Community Health Representatives at a particular Reservation,

the matter is taken up by Mr. IA POINE with the Tribal

Goverment, generally through the Public Health Service

Unit Director of the Indian Health Service who is located

at the Reservation.

The tribe is then given options or

suggestions as to what may be done to improve a certain

situation or shortconing.

The action taken is the respon-

Contracts with the Tribal Government on the many

Reverend GUY F. RONDELL, Pine Ridge, South

Dakota, advised that he is an ordained minister with

the United Presbyterian Churches of the United States

of America.

He does not belong to the Oglala Sioux

Tribe but is a member of the sisseton Wapeton Sioux

Tribe in South Dakota.

He has beon a nomber of the

Evaluation Committee of the Oglala Sious Tribo in Fine

flage, soutn Vakota, sibce January 1973.

He has

originally asked by RICHARD WILSON, President of. the

Oglala Sioux Tribe, to volunteerhis services for

the Evaluation Comnittee in November 1972, but he did

not accept this request at that time. However, he

eventually began to feel that it was his auty to help

the people of the tribe, so he accepted a voluntary

appointment in January

1973. He advised that the sole

purpose of the Evaluation Committee is to insure that

job vacancies under the Office of Economic Opportunity

(OFO) are filled equitably with a complete lack of

discrimination, favoratism and nepotism.

Before the formation of the Evaluation Committee,

many unfair practices were followed in the hiring of

persons for avatlable jobs. Under the current procedures,

when a vacany is advertised, all of the persons interested

submit applications.

applications are revieved by

members of the Evaluation Comnittee and are scored on the.

basis of a nunerical system devised by the Commitice in

order to assure that everyone gets an equal chance to be

considered best qualified for the job.

The result is that

the person having the

highest score is given first chance

at the available job.

It sometimes occurs that the person

selected by this method does not work out satisfactorily

and is subsequently torninated by his employer. This action

does not come from the Committee. When this occurs, the

person who scored next highest is offered the job.

RONDELL

feels that since the Committee was established, there has

been a complete absence of discrininatory practices in

hiring, promoting and terminating of persons in the OFO

programs.

RONDELL reCalled the appeal of GERALDINE JANIS

subsequent to her termination from employment as a Com-

munity Health Renresentative.

At the appeal hearing in

April 1973, RONCELL aSKOC GERALDINE: "Exactly That is

it that you want".

She replied Inat all one wanted res

the back pay coming iu lei

too aberupd annual leave.

RONDELL assured her that if she was entitled to that

pay,

she would get it. She made it clear at that time that

that was all she wanted. RONDELL does not recall that

her termination of employment as such was ever at issue.

She was further advised that if she wanted to be rehired

she would have to go to the Executive Board of the Oglala

Sioux Tribe because that is the authority which effected

her termination and inasmuch as it was a higher authority

than the Evaluation Committee.

Normally, persons who are hired by the Evaluation

Committee receive recommendations from the employer that

the services of the employee should be terminated

for

appropriate reasons.

The Committee always goes along

with the employer, who then terminates the employee and

In these cases, the employee does have a right to appeal

to the Evaluation Committee. However, this was not the

case in the matter concerning GERALDINE JANIS.

At no time prior to, during, or subsequent

to the appeal hearing, did JANIS make

any statements

indicating that she felt she had been unjustly discrim-

inated against in the loss of her job. The reasons for

her termination were that she had consorted with militant

AmerIcan IndIan lovement (Ath) troublemakers, had parti

cipated in demonstrations and had openly advocated the

overthrow of the Tribal Government.

These actions were

compounded by the fact that she engaged in these activities

during working hours, but had not submitted annual leave

requests for time off to engage in these activities.

RONDELL stated "If she had just kept her nose

out of these activities and kept her mind on her work

like everybody else, she wouldn't have had any problems".

as well as his final termination.

Furthermore, she was

able to review records which are

described as time sheets

inasmuch as she is the official custodian of these records.

She recalled

that on February 15 and 16, 1973,

HOLLOW HORN was docked 12 hours pay for absence from an

in-service training program.

This is about the time he

was given an oral admonition by BEAR HEELS for his failure

to show up.

Later, because of continued absence from

that he was being terninated effective May 7, 1973,

Inasmuch as the last day that he had been on the job was

He stated that GERALDINE JANIS has called him

approximately three times in reterence to this matter and

during one of these calls she stated that she preterred

to be fired instead of suspended from her position.

He

stated that no threats of any kind were made to her by him.

He stated that he was of the opinion that JANIS

wanted only pay for the accrued leave she had on the books.

He stated that this has been accomplished and that as far

as he is concerned the situation is settled.

He stated that the reason GERALDINE JANIS and

the other three individuals were fired was because they

demonstrated during working hours while they should have

been working at their respective jobs.

He stated that certain pieces of equipment were

missing from the office where GERALDINE JANIS worked and

he does not know whether or not this equipment was found.

He stated that these four individuals have filed

suit in Federal Court to regain their positions of employment

On August 9, 1973, Geraldine Janis telephonically

(605/867-5356) advised Departmental attorney R. Dennis

Ickes that no action has been taken on her termination

from employment with the Community Health Program on the

Oglala Sioux Indian Reservation by the Oglala Sioux Tribe

Executive Board and that she is currently unable to get

other employment because the Oglala Sioux Tribe Executive

Board classified her termination as being because she

advocated the overthrow of the tribal government. Janis

stated that she, Minerva

Walks Out, Della Starr, and

victoria wounded Foot appealed their termination by the

-Executive Board to the Oglala Sioux Tribe Personnel

Board headed by Tim Shangreaux in June, 1973, but the

Personnel Board disqualified themselves and referred the

Janis stated that she and the other terminated persons

named above asked the Executive Board to reinstate

them, but to date the Executive Board has refused.

Janis further stated that she has corresponded with

the Executive Board, but the Board refuses to reply.

In addition, Janis called "Toby" Eaglebull, the

Secretary of the Board, concerning Board action and

he stated that the Board would act on it sometime.

According to Janis, Wounded Foot and Starr did

not participate in any public demonstration, but did

sign a petition advocating a new form of Oglala Sioux

Tribe government. Janis stated that she and Walks Out

publicly demonstrated on non-working hours or by taking

appropriate authorized leave.

In order to determine whether the actions by

the Oglala Sioux Tribe Executive Board may violate

18 U.S.C. $242 and the Indian Bill of Rights, 25 U.s.C.

§1302, please conduct the following investigation:

1. Interview Tim Shangreaux, Personnel

The minutes of the Executive Committee Meeting

for April 4, 1973 (a copy is contained in the report

of Special Agent Thomas M. Moore dated May 20, 1973

at Minneapolis and attached to your memorandum to this

Division dated May 31, 1973) indicate that Barbara Means

was terminated as Clerk of Courts because "she partici-

pated in a public demonstration advocating the overthrow

of the elected government of the Oglala Sioux Iribe."

On August 13, 1973, Means telephonically

(605/867-5356) advised Departmental attorney R. Dennis

Ickes that she broke her left arm in four places on

January 16, 1973 and on Dr. Guenther's advice (Rushville,

Nebraska) took sick leave from February 7, 1973 to

June 1, 1973. On March 8, 1973, Means participated

in a public demonstration on the lawn of the Bureau

of Indian Affairs Building in Pine Ridge. On March 6,

1973, Means assisted in drafting a petition against the

tribal government and helped obtain signatures as well

as signing it herself. On March 29, 1973, Sidney Witt,

tribal prosecutor, told Means that she had been suspended

NW 68262 Docld:32989685 Page 454

---

## Page 455

- 7 -

from her job and gave her a memorandum to that effect.

According to Means, suspension is temporary until a

hearing is held at which time a decision is made con-

cerning her employment. However, Means stated that

she received no hearing and learned through friends

on approximately April 21, 1973 that she had been

fired by the Oglala Sioux Tribe Executive Committee

on April 4, 1973. No written notice of her firing

was received by Means.

8. Interview Means and obtain a signed statement

from her describing the events referred to in the above

telephone conversation. Also, obtain copies of the

following documents:

(a)

Dr. Guenther's written statement

concerning his recommendation for

Means.

(b)

Sidney Witt's memorandum to Means

saying she was suspended.

(c)

All other documents which reflect

upon Means' employment and termi-

nation as Clerk of Courts.

Also in the Departmental attorney's telephone

conversation

conversation with Janis on August 9, 1973 referred to

above, Janis alleged that other tribal employees had

been fired because of their participation in public

demonstrations or in signing circulated petitions.

Janis noted that _Carmel Means was enticed into resigning

a merit-protected job as fiscal manager for the local

Office of Economic Opportunity with the promise that

she would be given a job at the Pine Ridge College Center

with a higher salary; but that she was fired two days

later by Dick Wilson who was on the College's Board of

Directors which had to approve all hirings.

NW 68262 Docld:32989685 Page 455

## Page 456

Departmental attorney Ickes was telephonically

contacted by Carmel Means on August 13, 1973 (605/867-

5787). She stated that she had been fiscal manager

for Office of Economic Opportunity for a year at a

salary of $9,780 per year and had been an employee of

Office of Economic Opportunity since 1968. Jim Hand

and Tony Frescas (phonetic), both in administration

at the College Center, promised Means that if she

resigned from the Office of Economic Opportunity she

could get a job as bookkeeper at the College Center

for $10,000 per year.

They promised that the Board

of Directors of the Center had indicated that they

wanted only Means to work there.

According to Means, she resigned from the

Office of Economic Opportunity on July 20, 1973

and started work at the Center on July 23, 1973

and worked until July 24, 1973 when Frescas told

her that Dick Wilson was

"raising hell" about the

Center hiring her; therefore, Means was fired. She

was told by Frescas that she

could appear before the

Center's Board of Directors meeting on August 9, 1973

and apply for the job. Means said she did not attend

the August 9, 1973 meeting because she knew she would

not get the job based on her July 24, 1973 experience

with Frescas and Wilson's opposition. Means believes

that she was enticed into resigning her job at the

Office of Economic Opportunity so that the Office of

Economic Opportunity position could be used to reward

a supporter of Wilson. Means stated that Helen Palmier

replaced her at the Office of Economic Opportunity, but

does not know who replaced her at the Center.

Means stated that she signed a petition to

replace the tribal constitution and has associated

with Janis. According to Janis, Wilson has made the

statement in the presence of Lillian Cooney (sister.

to Carmel Means) and Karen Trueblood (an Office of

Economic Opportunity employee) that he was starting

NW 68262 Docld:32989685 Page 456

---

## Page 457

-9 -

his campaign for re-election as tribal chairman

already and that he would fire all of those who

worked against him and would hire his friends.

Means believes that Cooney will share her infor-

mation with investigating agents, but that Trueblood

may be afraid to cooperate. Means noted that similar

tactics have been attempted on Cooney who also works

at the Office of Economic Opportunity.

Janis further alleged in her telephone con-

versation that Oscar Hollow Horn, a former Office

of Economic Opportunity coordinator at Manderson,

South Dakota, and a current resident of Wounded

Knee was fired because he "was not interested in

his job."

Hollow Horn had signed the above described

petition.

9. Obtain the details of the Carmel Means

incident by:

(a)

Obtaining a signed statement from

Means describing the incident con-

cerning her resignation from the

Office of Economic Opportunity and

subsequent firing by the College

Center.

(b)

Frescas concerning:

Ne. Ridge Di

Inspector Cotter and the Police Training Coordinator put .

together a preliminary program of 18 hours which they felt was a

minimum requirement. Chief Wilson said that they had

been able to hire

41 individuals, some of whom had college degrees, and he was pleased

that the caliber of the people they were employing was above average.

The program put together included firearms training in shoulder weapons,

techniques and mechanics of arrest, basic and investigative techniques

covering the protection of crime scenes and interviewing, law as it

applies to Indian versus Indian on the reservation, patrol procedures,

identification of explosives and anti-sniper and survival tactics.

The program was set up to be held six hours a day for three. days after

which time the trainees would be put with an experienced Indian officer.

The Chief was most appreciative that the FBI had taken such

special interest in providing training töchis people.

He said the FBI

was the only agency that had kept its promises to him'and, speaking

very frankly, he said that the FBI was

the only Federal agency really

trusted by his people.

FRAUD AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT

Vincent Brewer, former Executive Director, and

Hobart Keith, Board member, both of the Oglala sioux Housing

Authority, Pine Ridge, South Dakota, Indian Reservation, have

advised the Oglala Sioux Tribe has borrowed approximately two

million dollars with which to construct homes on the Pine

Ridge Indian Reservation.

They advised the money was borrowed

from the Public Housing Administration, an agency of the U.s.

Government, with the money to be repaid by the tribe..

Part of

the agreement the tribe entered into with the Public Housing

Administration was that the latter would furnish a man to supervise

construction of the buildings. Heintzelman has been given this

job.

Brewer alleges a Board of Commissioners, consisting of

che Reservation superintendent, several Local persons, anc

albert Dale as treasurer, has been set up to oversee the project.

He described Dale as the owner of a bank in Rushville, Nebraska,

and also a stockholder in the Rushville Lumber Company.

It is alleged that Heintzelman has failed to open and

accept bids for materials as specified at the time the bids are

let.

He has accepted bids on his own, without the Commissioners

approval, from companies which he contacted after opening original

bids received.

This document contains neither recommendations nor conclusions

of the FBI.

CHARLES E. HEINTZELMAN ET AL

Both men claim the Rushville Lumber Company has

submitted the low bid on approximately 75 per cent of the

building materials used, and that in almost every instance,

the bid of this company has been just a few dollars lower

than that of

the next lowest bidder.

Brewer claims wholesale

lumbermen have advised him a retail lumber business, such

as the Rushville Lumber Company, could not submit such low bids

on neta

profitably.

It is also alleged that Richard Wilson, who is in charge

of the plumbing work on the project, has used materials from

the housing project to construct a home, a basement, and a

partially finished plumbing shop, with the knowledge of

Heintzelman. None of this material has apparently been paid for.

Brewer advised there are several other instances

where materials from the project have been used to put additions

onto homes on the reservation, apparently with Heintzelman's

knowledge.

Keith advised he purchased a furnace from Wilson,

which came from a home that was removed from the project.

This

furnace, together with other appliances in the home, were to be

sola to

the highest bidder.

Instead, Heintzelman gave them to

Wilson, who in turn sold at least part of them.

Efforts on the part of Keith to examine project records

have been thwarted, although he claims he is entitled to

examine such records as a Board member.

Special Officer James F. Fail, Pine Ridge, South Dakota,

has advised the funds involved are actually property of the U.s.

Government.

Investigation is being conducted regarding the

allegations.

bidders. HOBART KEITH and VINCENT BREWER allege HEINTZELMAN has

On January 24, 1964, Special Officer JAMES F. FAIL,

Lumber Company, improperly.

FAIL advised he did not know if

government funds or property are involved, but that KEITH, as a

board member, is checking records of the Housing Authority to

determine just what is involved.

On January 28, 1964, Mr. FAIL advised KEITH had attempted

to check the records, but that Mrs. RICHARD WILSON, the acting

executive director, had refused to make the records available to

him.

he stated that LLELLYN KInGSley, superintendent of the

reservation, had advised him the funds and property involved in

the housing project are government property and funds.

On January 29, 1964, the lacts concerning this matter

vere discussod with assistant

United States Attorney PARNeLL J.

DOnOnUE.

Mr. DoNOnus advised that if the facts, as alleged, are

proven,

the case would warrant prosecutive consideration under

Title 18, Section 286 and 287.

On January 30, 1964, CECIL KEITH was interviewed and he

furnished the following

signed statement:

"January 30, 1964

"I, CECIL HOBART KEITH, having been duly

sworn, make the following voluntary statement to

JOHN E. MCCARTY who has identified himself to me to

be a Special Agent of the Federal Bureau of

Investigation.

"I have been advised I do not have to give

this statement and that it may be used in court.

No threats, promises, or force of any kind has

been used to make me give this statement.

"I am the vice-chairman of the Oglala Sioux

"ALBERT DALE is a banker at Rushville,

It is my understanding he also owns a

thirty one per cent interest in the Rushville Lumber

Co. I do not know for sure, but it appears to me

that half or more of the building materials in the

housing project have been purchased from the Rushville

Lumber Co.

I have no information as to the bids sub

mitted by this company.

"I have never been really sure just what

HEINZELMANs authority is, however, I know that as

a matter of practice he has been letting bids for

materials entirely on his own. He has not consulted

the Board about any bids he has accepted or declined.

"In about April, 1963 I hired DICK WILSON tO

put in some soil pipe at my home. WILSON furnished the

materials, and I do not know where they came from.

I gave him forty five or fifty dollars for this.

"About this time WILSON told me he had a

rurnace for sale so I bought it, paying WILSON

seventy 'five dollars for it. The furnace is in my

home now.

"Later I became suspicious for some reason or

other, so I asked WILSON where he had obtained the

furnace.

As nearly as I cal recall WILSON said,

it's all right, I've got a deal with either the boss

or HEINTZELMAN.

I don't remember just how he did

refer to HEINTZELMAN. I believe the furnace I bought

is a Bryant, and I'm quite sure, although I can't

prove it, that this furnace came from the DEWEY

CLIFFORD

house.

"The CLIFFORD house had to be moved from its

foundation, and moved to another location in the

housing project. The Housing Authority bought the

house, but I'm not sure what was to be done with the

appliances and furnishings in the house.

"I also agreed to paint a picture for WILSON.

In payment WILSON gave me a pressure tank which I

I actually

picked the tank up from where it was lying on the

ground near where the lumber storage yard is at

the Housing project.

"I know a basement was built at the BILL

SALWAY home in Pine Ridge early in the fall of 1963.

I know the materials were from the Housing project,

and the basement was built by worknen on the

project payroll. This was a deal HEINTZELNAN arranged

for, and I do not know who is to be paid for it.

"I have no other personal knowledge of this

matter, except that to my knowledge the Board of

Commissioners never authorized HEINTZELMAN to sell

or dispose of any of the project materials.

"I also entered into a verbal agreement with

HEINTZELMAN, before I went on the Board of

Commissioners, to paint a large emblem for two

hundred and seventy tive dollars, and to paint

desigus on shutters of the houses in Project SD 1-1

for six hundred dollars. I did not submit a

written bid on this, and to my knowledge no one else

did either.

I received all this money.

"In 1961 the Oglala Sioux Tribe set up the

"EVANS LUCAS and Associates of Sioux Falls,

South Dakota was the original architectural firm on the

project. This company resigned early in January,

1963 because it felt HEINTZELMAN was changing the

materials called for in the plans and because he

was using inferior products. This company had worked

just on s.D. Il, and no one was hired to finish out

this job.

"CRAIG and BROOKS was the architectural firm

on S.D. I-2.

This company also resigned after a

hassle with HEINZELMAN.

The company claimed

HEINTZELMAN was cheapening the buildings, and was

using inferbr and poorer quality materials than

called for in the plans.

"IRVING R. DANA was hired as the architect on

S.D. 1-3. It is my belief DANA gets along with

HEINTZELMAN because he has followed HEINTZELMAN'S

recommendations.

I told him when he started that he

would have to feel

HEINTZELMAN out to see what he

wanted, and DANA indicated to me he was going to do

this.

DANA is the son in law of BILL HEWITT of

Rushville, Nebraska.

"I believe $787, 000 was actually spent on

S. D. 1-1.

"Bids for materials were to be obtained by

advertising for them.

The advertisements specified

the bids were to be opened at a specified date and

time.

"As a matter of practice when the bids came in

they would be held by the secretary, and given to

HEINTZELMAN when he came in.

He would then open

the bids himself, whenever he felt like it. He

would accept or reject bids as he chose, without con-

sulting the Board. I know personally of a few bids

he accepted which were the lowest bids submitted.

I

also know of a few instances where he accepted bids

higher than the lowest bids, claiming the materials

in the lower bids were not what he wanted.

"The only instance I know of where he consulted

the Board on a bid was on bricks for S.D. 1-2. In

this instance the Board accepted a certain type of

and put up a different brick.

"I then saw WILSON take one hundred and ten

Housing Authority truck.

I asked him about this,

and he told me HEINTZELMAN had told him it was 0.k.

for him to move them, and he could take what he

wanted.

"I then called HEINTZELMAN iN WILSON's presence.

CHARLEY HEINTZELMAN Said to let it go, as DICK was

going to pay for them.

WILSON then took four hundred

more blocks. WILSON aso took thirty sacks of cement,

three or four sacks of lime, and sore sand.

"The blocks were worth twenty six cents apiece,

the lime and cement were worth about rinety six cents

a sack, and the sand worth approximately fifteen to

twenty dollars.

I made WILSON sign a receipt for

these materials. WILSON then used the materials to

build a block basement in Pine Ridge.

"This happened in July, 1962.

Just a few days

ago WILSON told me he had his bills, but had never

paid for the materials.

the highest bidder. To my

knowledge WILSON never turned this money in.

I saw JIM BIG CROW, who WILSON had hired, hauling

materials from the project to the site of the house

1n a Housing Authority truck. This movement of

materials took place on weekends.

WILSON once told

me he had about eight hundred dollars worth of

materials in this house.

"In the fall of 1963, in about October, WILSON

and JAMES RED WING started building & cement block

building in Pine Ridge.

WILSON told me he was going

to use one part of it for a plumbing shop. I don't

recall what he said RED WING was going to use the

other part for.

"I saw BIG CROW hauling new blocks Iron the

housing project area in a Housing Authority truck

to the site of this building. I believe the sand, lime,

and cement for the building came from the project

also.

I would estimate there are about eighteen hundred blocks,

worth four hundred and sixty eight dollars in the building.

There is approximately ninety six dollars worth of lime

and cement, and about sixty dollars worth of sand in the

building.

"JESSIE EAGLE HEART told me she had made an

arrangement with CHARLEY to have an addition put

on her house. I KNoW MYLES TYLER supervised the

job, and project workmen did the works and were paid

from Housing Authority funds. I do not know what

financial arrangements were made on this.

"Said on one occasion GORDON REICHENBURG, WhO

lives

in Rushville, Nebraska, told me HEINTZELMAN

was getting

all the windows

for his new house for

him. I dod't know if the windows were to come

from the housing project or not. This occurred in

the summer of 1963.

"During the

summer of 1963 HUCH JOHN BLACKSMITH,

who was timekeeper on the housing project, built

an addition on to his house. I keow part of the

materials were ordered from

the Rushville lumber

yard, but part of the materials he trucked from the

project to his home at

night in a housing project

truck. Someone, I

dan't recall who, told me he had

seen BLACKSMITH hauling the materials off.

"Northwest Pipe Fitting Co. of Rapid City,

I know HEINTZELMAN and a

former assistant manager of this company were very

close to each other.

"DICK WILSON had a free hand in ordering from

this company.

It seened to me he was constantly

ordering something from this company. I believe he

ordered much more plumbing materials than were

actually used in the housing project.

thought it was a bad deal, as he was the only one that

had been paying any of the bills on it. I told him I

wasn't interested as there was no roof or windows in

"Approximately six weeks ago I hired DICK WILSON

"WILSON's bill for labor and materials was forty

NO

hired.

"I do not know how the letting of bids was

done, and I had nothing to do with this.

I know

nothing about the organizational set up of the

Housing Authority on the administrative procedures

"The DEVEY CLIFFORD home had to be moved in

projectS.D. 1-1 as it was in the middle of where

a street was to go.

The house itself was re-used,

but the basement had to be

torn

out.

"Mr. HEINTZELMAN gave me the cement blocks from

this home just to get them out of there.

four or five hundred blocks from the CLIFFORD

house, and used them in the construction of a base-

ment in Pine Ridge. I planned to build a house

on the basement.

"There were not enough of the CLIFFORD house

to linish the basement, so I got lour or five

hundred new cement blocks from the project to

finish my basement.

I hauled these blocks from the

project site to my basement in a Housing Authority

"ruck on sundays and in the everings. I had

authority to use this truck for my personal use if

I furnished the gas for it, which I did.

"Before taking any of the new blocks I asked

JOE WALTZES, the construction superintendent, 11

I could buy the blocks, as I knew we had an excess

of then.

He told me to go ahead and take them.

"While taking them VINCENT BREWER asked me if

I had made arrangements to get the blocks. I told

him I had. I do not recall if we then contacted

HEINTZELMAN or not.

I also took about twenty five

bags of.

cement, ten bags of lime and I salvaged

some sand from finished basements.

a could bay material.

I didn't specify what materials

& wanted, and the only arrangements I made to pay for

them was

that I told him I would pay whatever the

Housing Authority paid for the materials.

There was

no mention made of who I was to pay or when I was to

pay.

In my own mind I folt I was to pay the housing

authority.

"I obtained these materials in about July or

August, 1962.

Up to the present time I have not

been billed for them, and I have not yet paid for them.

"I know that a house I helped physically build for

my mother, duLlA WILSoN, was built entirely with

materials

from the housing project. My mother made

all the arrangements for this through Mr. BERGEN, and

I had nothing to do with arranging for or paying for

these materials.

"Mr. HEINTZELMAN told me to remove everything

from the CLIFFORD house so it could be moved. He

told me to store the stuff I took out. I took a

furnace, a pump, a tub, a stool, a lavatory, a kitchen

sink and stove from the house.

I also took a pressure

tank, which was part of the pump.

"At that time the Housing Authority had no storage

area, so I stored the articles in a shed owned by my

mother.

This was in about August, 1962. I remember

VINCENT BREWER asking me later if I had these

articles, and I told him I did. I do not recall him

telling me to return them to the project.

"I can't recall wher,

but one time I told HOBART

SulTh I had a turnace that

belonged to the housing

project.

He asked to buy it,

so I told him to go

ahead and take it, which he

did.

I did not discuss

any arrangements for payment with him, but I assumed

KEITH made this arrangement with HEINTZELMAN. Later

my wife

,told me KEITH had paid fifty dollars, I

believe,

to the Housing Authority for the furnace.

This is

the same furnace I got from the CLIFFORD house.

"I later gave KEITH the pressure tank because

he told me his leaked.

No arrangements were made

for payment, but I assumed he would pay the

Housing Authority for it. This tank was not in ex-

change for any painting.

I did ask KEITH to do a

painting for me, and I have already paid him

eighteen dollars in cash for it, but he has never

given me the painting.

"In the fall of 1962 FRANK E COFFEY waS build-

ing a bathroom onto his house.

I told him of the

stuff I had.

I assumed he made arrangements through

the Housing

Authority, because he came and got the

tub and the lavatory.

I made no arrangements with

ECOFFEY for payment of these articles,

and I got

nothing for them.

I don't know it he

has ever paid

to housing authority for them or not.

"I put in some soil pipe for both KEITH and

ECOFFEY in the summer and fall of 1962. In both

instances I got the materials I used, which was about

twenty five feet of soil pipe and six fittings at

KEITH's,, and about fifteen feet of soil pipe and

four fittings at ECOFFEY's.

"Both of them paid me for my labor. They did

not pay for the materials because

I figures they would

pay the Housing Authority for it. I did not tell

them where the material had come from, but they had

to know the Housing project is the only place in town

1t could have come from. I had made no arrangements

with anyone ahead of time to take this pipe.

"In about September, 1963 I told JIM RED WING

I nad some lots, and I wanted to build a building

on it, but didn't have the money to go ahead. I

had to put a building within ninety days or lose the

lots, as this is the policy of the Planning Connission

which assigned me the lots.

"I told RED WING I could get the materials

through the Housing project. We decided to build

the building, with me to use half of it for a plumbing

shop, and he to use half for a garage.

"RED WING bought the first blocks for the

building, two semiloads.

He bought them from

JOHN

MAGAHEY (Pho) in Gordon, Nebraska. He also had some

hine a bought previously from a Reverand UNRAU in

Pine Ridge.

"In about October, 1963 I got about one hundred

and fifty new cement blocks and twenty five bags of

masonry cement from the S.D. 1-2 project.

We

salvaged sand from finished basements on S.D. 1-3.

"I asked HEINTZELMAN ahead of time if I could

get these blocks as we had an excess of blocks on

S.D.1-2. He told me I could have them. No arrange-

ments were made for paying for them.

I have not

been billed for them and have not paid for them.

I intend to pay for them soon, I suppose.

"I also got seventy feet of three quarter inch

copper

tubing and one curb box from the housing

project for this building.

HEINTZELMAN knew of this,

but no arrangement was made to pay for it.

"I have no knowledge of the deal JERRY WEAVER

made to put an addition on the house owned by my

mother on land he leases from her.

"In about November, 1963 I used sixty leet of

half inch copper tubing, twenty eight feet of inch

and a half copper tubing, about a dozen fittings,

and two frost proof hose bibs, in a plumbing job 1

did for FRED GERBER.

I got this material from

S.D. I-3 project. I had previously made arrange-

ments with Mr. HEINTZELMAN to get whatever materials

I needed.

He told me just to keep a 1ist 01. 1t and

check it

out through the office whenever I took

something, which I did.

So I did not specifically

ask him for this material.

"GERBER paid me forty six dollars approximately

"In 1961 a contract was entered into between the

Housing Authority and the Public Housing Administra

The agreement was the P.H.A. would loan the

money to the Authority.

The Authority then sold

bonds and repaid the govermment. P.H.A. then pays

the interest on the bonds and guarantees their payment.

"CHARLES HEINTZELMAN was assigned by P.H.A. as

its representative on the local projects.

1 am not

sure what is the authority of HEINTZELMAN or the

Executive Director. The Housing Authority is actually

responsible for the entire project. I do not know

how far HEINIZELMAN's authority extends insofar as the

handling of bids and contracts are concerned. It is

my understanding HEINTZELMAN has, as a matter oj

practice, handled the awarding of bids and contracts

assistance of his office staff.

"There

is a

stipulation, either in the contract

or the original ordinance

setting up the project,

stating the Housing Authority can buy or sell the

same as any other corporation.

There is also a

letter in file from the Tribal Attorney stating

it is within the authority of the Housing Authority

to sell materials to the Indian people to use in

fixing up sanitation in their homes.

there are no limitations on the sale of materials, but

I feel it is the responsibility of the lousing authority

to make sure this doesn't get out of hand.

"At the end of forty years when the bonds are

paid off, the entire project is turned over to the

Tribe by

the government.

Until that time, the

government has the right to inspect the property,

terminate the contract, and actually is totally in

volved in the whole project.

Should the Public Housing

Administration feel anything is wrong, it can take the

whole project away from the Housing Authority.

"Insofar as to the actual letting of bids and

accepting of contracts, I have no knowledge of the

mechanics involved.

I have never had any reason to

question the correctness of the procedures being

used.

To my knowledge HEINTZELMAN has never dis

cussed any bids or contracts with the Housing Authority.

"I do not know what procedure was supposed to

be followed in the disposal of such items as thosein

the CLIFFORD house.

"I do not know why the first architectural firm

left the project. Craig and Brooks was fired by the

Housing Authority on HEINTZELMAN'S recommendation.

The architects claimed inferior or cheaper materials

were being used in the buildings than their speci

fications called for. It is true less expensive

materials were being used, on HEINTZELMAN'S reCommen

dation, as we had to stay within the limits of the

funds we had available.

"I do not feel that any changes made in the

specifications materially altered the quality or

degree.

All the changes had to be approved by

the Board, and were minor changes.

"I have never to date had any reason to

suspect or believe there has been anything wrong in

the housing project in Pine Ridge.

"I want to state I am not sure if the

original contract between P.H. A.

and the Housing

Authority was entered into in

1961 ox 1962.

"Actually Craig and Brooks objected to all

of the proposed changes and modifications wanted

by the Housing Authority. Also the Authority felt

the firm was not fulfilling all of the terms of

their contract.

This is why the firm was dis-

charged.

Actually HEINTZELNAN did not recommend

dismissing the firm, but he is the

one that recom

mended the proposed modifications.

if necessary, and take over the project however.

ALSO, II RECESSarY,

The

is unique

in that it was built "forced account."

done to insure that local

asked by the Housing Authority to build the project.

I have

acted in the capacity of both inspector for

P.H.A., and contractor, purchasing agent, and about

everything olse, for the local Housing Authority.

This has been done with the knowledge of my superiors

in the Chicago Office of P.H.A.

"Advertisements for bids are prepared by my office.

They specify a date by which the bids are to be in. '

Normally thore is no specific time that

these bids

have

to be opened:

"I would normally open the bids, and discuss

them with

at least part of the housing authority

members.

This was not always done in Housing Authority

meetings, as that

group normally meets but once a

month, and we might have many bids to accept or reject

before the next meeting was scheduled. The Housing

Authority has given me

authority to accept or reject bids.

"There have been occasions where I have rejected

all the bids received on a particular iten, if I felt they

did not meet specifications.

I would then

go out and

obtain other lower or more satisfactory bids, but I

did not make the original bids ve had received public.

"I do not know if ALBERT DALE has an interest in

the rushville Lumber

Company or not.

That company did

receive many of the contracts for building materials.

This was just because. that compamy could sell the

Housing Authority materials meeting our specifications

at a lower cost than other

SAMUEL STaNDS, having been dully sworn,

was

interviewed in the presence of Special Oificer James I. fall.

STANDS advised he is the Chairman of the Oglala Sioux Housing

Authority. He also stated he has a fourth grade education,

and cannot read or write very well.

STANDS furnished the following information.

He is not very familiar with the financiai or

organizational structure of the Oglala Sioux Housing

Authority,

and does not know if the Housing Authority has

paid back to the Public Housing Administration, the money

originally borrowed from it.

All bids and contracts were handled by Mr.

HEINTZELMAN Or MYLES TYLER, the Construction Superintendent,

and no one ever discussed

any bids with him.

The Housing Authority members, and not HEINTZELAN,

wanted changes made in the plans submitted by architects.

When the architects refused to go along with the requested

refuse to s

changes, the Authority, acting on its own initiative, tired

the

architects.

The Housing Authority orally agreed that local

Indians could buy materials from the housing project for use

in their own construction jobs on the reservation. The

purchasers were to repay the Authority for any naterials they

bought.

He believes only materials to, be used in adding

bathrooms to homes were to be sold.

He does not know for sure

if the authority was extended to sell materials for other

uses or not.

Sometimes bids would be opened by the authority,

and sometimes by HEINZELMAN. The Authority as a whole would

decide which bid to accept.

He does not know if HEINTZELMAN

ever accepted any bids on his own or not To nis knowledge

HEINTZELMAN always let contracts on the bids accepted by

the authority, and did not make any unwarranted changes.

The Authority members did look at various material samples

submitted with bids, and would then decide which bid it

wanted to accept.

DALE stated it was his sincere wish to cooperate in

every way possible in an etfort to refute once and for all these

very violous rumors which according to him threaten the entire

effort, to improve the living conditions of the sioux Indian

nation.

DALE further stated he had absolutely nothing to

hide, did not desire to consult with an attorney, and would

consent to be interviewed under oath.

DALE was placed under oath by SA ROBERT D. KINSES.

DALE related he has been associated with the housing

project at line Ridge, souch Dakota,

Sioux Housing Authority (OSHA). He did state he receives

$5.00 mileage for each round trip he has to make from Rushville,

Nebraska, to Pine Ridge, South Dakota. DALE noted he accepted

this duty, feeling it was a publio service due to the fact he

felt the purpose of the project which was to improve the slum

Ilving conditions of the sioux Indians was a most worthy under-

taking.

DALE stated the project has been going on for about

three years and original funds

to start the project were advanced

by an agency of the U. S. Government, as he recalls the Public

Housing Administration,

He stated the advance money was not

received nearly fast enough to pay off the various contractors

and laborers on the job and much of the sum of $1,500, 000.00 was

secured through temporary notes to the National City Bank of

New York, New York,City, New York. He stated bonds to cover the

total cost, approximately $2,600, 000.00 for the whole project, already

have been advertised and will be issued and placed on sale by the

Hartford National Bank and Trust Company, Hartford, Connecticut,

at 2:30 p.M., March 2, 1964.

DALE said despite this sale of bonds he is of the

opinion some U.S. Government funds will be involved as the

Government is subsidizing the sum clearance program on the Pine

Ridge Indian Reservation.

DALE stated the aim of the project, in addition to

providing

a total of some 127 new private homes and a 23-unit

old folks

home, also has provisions to repay Indians whose

homes are destroyed or moved to make room for the new units

as well as providing assistance to Indians who desire to

modernize and repair existing residences.

DALE advised a body known as the Oglala Sioux

Housing Authority was set up and this group consists of the

following persons:

SAMUEL STANDS, Chairman;

EMIL TIBBETTS

C. HOBARD KEITH, Member of the Board;

ALBERL DALE, Treasurer,

DALE noted that neither himself nor any other member

of the Authority is a builder and the entire project is being

overseen by a Mr. CHARLES EDWARD HEINTZELMAN, Inspector,

Public Housing Administration (PHA) • He said HEINIZELMAN

resides in Miñneapolis, Minnesota, but works out of the PHA

Headquarters at Chicago, Illinois, and usually spends about

every. other week at the site of the Fine Ridge project.

DALE noted a CHARLES A. REED is project manager,

a MILES TAYLOR 1s construction superintendent for the bullding

of the individual residences, and a Mr. ARNOLD WALTERS 18

construction foreman for the old. folks home.

DALE related he has complete confidence in the

ability and integrity of HEINIZELMAN and he has been given

complete authority to act for the OSHA.

He said HEINTZELMAN

handles the advertising and publication of the bids, accepts

or rejects these bids subject to review by his superiors,

PHA at Chicago, and generally is responsible for the entire

project.

DALE stated the programing of the slum clearance on

the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, in addition to providing

for the new private homes and for the construction of a 23-unit

old folks home, also provided for the remodeling of existing

homes and under this

to sell to individual Indians materials from OSHA building stock-

piles for these repairs and renovations.

In this connection, DALE stated he recalled several

Indians had purchased siools and lavatories from OSHA to add

bathrooms to their residences and he also recalled a WILLIAM

GOINGS secured sufficient materials to add a room to his

residence.

DALE stated a close accounting is maintained for

a11 such transactions, which he described as quite numerous;

out he did not feel the entire amount expended would be much

over $10,000.00, 1f that much.

In this connection he noted PHA In Chicago sends

out an auditor who regularly audits the entire operation at

the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation for all phases of the

construction.

NW 68262 Docld:32989685 Page 554

## Page 555

OM 46-2570

DALE stated very good progress is being made on all

components of the construction, noting the old folks home is

scheduled to

and the other

section, known as s.D. 1-3 of the private home

construction 1s between 40% and 50% complete.

In further reference to bids solicited for

conscruction, Dale noted regulations provide the calling for

Dide be advertised, specitications are described, a letting

date is set, and it is required that three bids be secured.

He said he has never had any suspicions that the entire handling

of the bids was not completely fair, honest and above board.

DALE advised he was well aware of the fact that a

local lumber yard at Rushville, Nebraska, the Rushville

Lumber and coal Company, has provided a considerable amount,

probably at least 50-60% of the total lumber used on the

project.

He said this appeared very logical to him as this yard

1s much

closer to the project than yards at Rapid City, South

Dakota, and other sizeable South Daota cities.

As a result

of their proximity to the project the Rushville Lumber and

Coal Company has definite shipping advantages which in his

opinion would allow this concern to underbid more remotely

Located competitors.

DALE stated he has absolutely no financial interest

In the Rushville Lumber and Coal Company and after checking

bank recoras to be certain advised the bank has absolutely

no loans to this concern.

DALE related he has no Information to Indicate bids

for lumber that may have been made by the Rushville Lumber

and Coal Company are handled in any fashion or in any way

different from the handling of the many types bide accepted

for the multitude of different items used on the project.

ROY CURTISS advised he is principal stockholder,

Secretary-Treasurer and the active manager of the Rushville

Lumber and Coal Company at Rushville, Nebraska.

CURTISS was Informed certain allegations had been

made relative to the volume of material his company had provided

for the construction of a number of private homes and an old

folks unit under the Publio Housing Authority (PHA) at Pine

Ridge, South Dakota.

He was further advised that allegations

had been made indicating his company mighi possibly have been

provided preferential treatmen't in bidding and might have been

given advance information relative to the bids submitted by

competing bidders.

CURTISS was further informed he did not have to make

any

statement; that any statement he might make could be used

against him in court, and that he was entitled to the services

of an attorney if he

so desired.

CURTISS was also advised that since this investigation

involved possible fraud against the U.S. Government, interviewing

agent had the authority to question him under oath if he was

as aust,

agreeable. CURTISS advised he could not understand how such

allegations could be made, that he and his firm were entinely

innocent of any wrongdoing and he stated he desired to cooperate

fulLy.

CURTISS was placed under oath by sA ROBERT D. KINSEY.

CURTISS advised he personally had handled virtually

all business associated with the public housing being

constructed at the rine hiage indian reservation, Pine riage.

South Dakota.

In particular, CURIISS advised he had handled alj

the bids submitted for materials furnished by his company for

this job.

CURTISS stated he would hear of the items up for bids

through regular channels and if interested he would secure the

necessary bid forms which listed the material to be furnished

along with the specifications.

CURTISS said he would then figure out his bid and

submit it through normal channels.

CURMISS emphatically stated neither CHARLES

HEINTZELMAN, Who he knows as the Inspect for the Public

Housing Administration, nor anyone else has ever given him

any information as to the amounts of the bids submitted by

any other firm and neither has he or his company ever been

made an offer by anyone to help his company get any contracts

on the Pine Ridge project in any way other than through normal

and legitimate business procedures.

CURtIss volunteered that his company has served the

Pine Ridge Reservation, which 1s only a little over twenty miles

Iron Rushitle, Nebraska, for years and has a truck which makes

daily deliveries to the area. He noted he was in a much better

position to serve the project on the basis of a favorable

posicion as far as shipping charges were concerned and he could

normally be expected to be able to underbia suppliers from a

greater distance from the project.

He also advised that in 1962 before the administrative

controls were completely set up on the project he was able to

supply a considerable amount of material which was needed

immediately and could be purchased locally without the letting

of bids.

He said his company would realize its normal margin

of profit on such sales, but since 1963 almost all Items have

been supplied to the project under sealed bids and to supply

such material it is necessary for him to bid on a very small

profit margin.

CURIISS further advised he considers CHARLES

HEINTZELMAN as doing an excellent job on the project and in

protecting the interests of the Sioux Indians and the U.S.

Government.

CURTISS stated ALBERT DALE, President of the

Stockmen's National Bank, Rushville, Nebraska, owns no stock

ih his company and his company has no loans with the Stockmen's

EDWARD ARNOLDS, Assistant Regional Attorney, Public

Housing Administration (PHA), Regional Office, 185 North Wabash

Avenue, Chicago, Illinois, furnished the following information:

The Pine Ridge, South Dakota, Indian reservation

housing project was developed and constructed in accordance

with the Housing Act under which a legally constituted

housing authority applies to the PHA for approval of

development and linancing of a low rent housing project.

thA enters into a preliminary loan contract whereby PHA

advances funds to the local housing authority to do

preliminary planning to determine the need for and feasibility

of low rent housing. When the project has been approved

Pils enters into an Annual Contributions Contract with the

local housing authority covering the full estimated cost of

the project whereby it agrees to loan money to the local

housing authority to construct the project and under which

disbursements are made to the local housing authority as

needed - generally the estimated lunds needed for a three

month period.

The local housing authority signs an open-end

note for the full estimated cost of the project, and is legally

allowed to borrow up to 90% of such total estimated cost.

As advances are made to the local housing authority, the

amounts

thereof are endorsed on the said notes. After the project

is under way, the local housing authority issues temporary

notes to finance the construction which are sold to

private investors, usually banks, and the proceeds of which are

used in part to repay PiA advances to that time. The temporary

notes are generally in an amount to cover funds needed for a six

nonth period and as of the date of issuance total the amount of

advances made to that time by PHA and the additional funds \which

it is estimated will be required for the ensuing six months.

inancing during the construction period is continued by the

issuance of temporary notes, generally for six month periods,

however, should additional funds be needed prior to maturity of

such notes, PHA can and will advance additional funds to the local

housing authority, which again upon issuance of a new series of ten-

porary notes, will be repaid.

When the project is substantially completed,

permanent financing is arranged, which consists of bonds

issued by the local housing authority. These bonds are

serial bonds, which mature over a period of 40 years and

PHA guarantees the principal and interest to the extent

provided for in the Annual Contributions Contract.

These

bonds are sold to private investors. The bond indenture

provides for a fixed annual payment which will liquidate

the

total obligation over a period of 40 years. Under

its contract with the local housing authority, PhA is

obligated to make up the portion of the annual payment

which the local housing authority does not have funds to

meet from its operations. This payment is limited under

the contract to a certain amount, however, in practice it

is usually sufficient to liquidate 100 per cent of the cost

With regard to the Pine Ridge, South Dakota,,

Indian reservation housing project, PHA was approached by

a Washington, D. C. law firm representing the Indian tribe

to determine whether it could qualify for low rent housing.

It was informed that it could by meeting the requirements of

the Housing Act which meant organizing a legally constituted

housing authority.

This was done and the Oglala Sioux Housing

Authority (OSHA)

became such authority. The preliminary

planning conract was entered into by PHA with OSHA in

september, Loot, and eventually the project vas approvea ano

an Annual Contributions Contract was entered into in June,

1962.

This project actually included three projects, two

of which were covered in the initial contract, and the third

added as an amendment to the contract. Advances to finance

initial construction were made by PHA to OSHA beginning in

June, 1962,

and the initial series of temporary notes to

finance contruction were issued by OSHA in about November,

1962. The third and last series of temporary notes matured

January 10, 1964.

Permanent financing, consisting of bonds,

has been arranged and the bonds sold and to be delivered

march 3, 1964.

As there was a short interval between maturity

of the

temporary notes and delivery of the bonds representing

permanent financing, PHA advanced sufficient funds to pay off

the principal and interest of the temporary notes which matured

on January 10, 1964. This amounted to $1,576,613.71.

Accordingly, OSHA is indebted to PHA at the present time in that

amount plus interest on the said amount from January 10, 1964,

at 3 7/8 per cent.

This indebtedness will be liquidated upon

delivery of the bonds constituting the permanent financing on

March 3, 1964.

These bonds will total $1,690,000 and the Ilxed

annual paynent will amount to $79,230.

fir. ARNOLDS stated that there was no running record

of

advances, etc., maintained in the Chicago Regional Office

and that a complete record of advances, issuance of temporary notes,

etc., regarding the financing of the Pine Ridge, South Dakota

projects could best be obtained from the fiscal Branch of PHA,

Washington, D. C.

Mr. ARNOLDS made available the financé file relating

to the. Pine Ridge project, which reflected the following:

A copy of a letter dated May 24, 1962, from THOMAS D.

necessary to permit project sb-i-, Pine alage, to be built by

the force account method.

This method was explained as one

whereby Tribal Authority will utilize the available labor force and

direct the construction work themselves.

A copy of consolidated Annual Contributions Contract

Number C-354 reflected that this contract was entered into on

June 7, 1952, by the Pha and OsHA, a body corporate and politic

organized and existing under the laws of the oglala sious tribe

of the Pine Ridge Reservation.

As indicated, the above described documents were

copies and bore no endorsements of funds advanced under them.

There were copies of several documents contained in

the file of requests for advances submitted by OSHA and copies

of some approvals by the Fiscal Branch of PHA, however, these

did not appear to be complete and as stated by Mr. ARNOLDS, a

complete and reliable record would have to be obtained from

the Fiscal Branch in Washington, D. C.

Copies of these documents did reflect that the intial

advance by PHA to OSHA on the project was made on or about June

14, 1962. The latest and last requisition for funds- by OSHA

was dated October 22, 1963,

and related to the advance to be

made by PEA to pay off the

temporary notes which matured on

January 10, 1964, and provided for advance totalling $1,576,613.71,

covering all three

projects.

It was noted that the toal estimated development cost

for the three projects per the contract was $2,279,708, whereas

I. ARNOLDS advised the permanent financing consisting of the

bonds of osta totallea $1, 690, 000.

ARNOLDS stated that the

total bond issue represents the total cost for construction

of the three projects and explained that when the permanent

bonds are to be issued a minimum development cost determination

is made and this is used as the total of the bond issue by the

local housing authority.

He added that is it develops an

additional amount is needed, which would usually be a small

percentage, PHA can make a direct loan to the local housing

authority.

ARNOLDS advised that the project in every case;

specifically in the Pine Ridge project, is constructed

by the local housing authority, which

title to all.

materials, etc., relating to the project.

ARNOLDS also advised that if irregularities occurred

on the Pine Ridge or any project resulting in an increase

in

the total cost of the project, there would be a correspording

increase in the U. S. Government's annual contribution and,

therefore, the Government would suffer a loss.

HAROLD BROW, Chief of the Construction Section,

Chicago Regional Office, Public Housing Administration (PIA),

185 North Wabash Avenue, Chicago, Illinois, furnished the

following information:

The Pine Ridge, South Dakota, Indian Reservation

lo rent housing project is unique and some background is

necessary to an understanding of it. The project originated

vIth an Inquiry to phA by a lashington, D.C., lau firm

representing the indian tribe, in effect as to whether the

tribe could qualily for low rent housing financing under the

Housing Act.

They could qualify through organization of a

legally constituted housing authority and did so by forming

the Oglala Sioux Housing Authority (OSHA).

Development plans vere submitted to Pha which were

based on sone dwelling units constructed on the Reservation

about & year befora on contracts let by the Bureau of Indian

Affairs.

These avellings were similar to the type of

dwellings which are constzuctedrormally as low rent housing

under Pill financing.. However, the cost of these units were,

as BROWN recalled, about $24,000 each whereas the PHA could

not finance units

costing more than about $12,000 or $13,000

under the statutory limitations. The Pha could not approve

the development at the cost proposed, bui decided to 100k

into the matter to determine why the costs vere so high.

This

was done and it was found that the general contractors'

bids were high primarily because of high labor costs occasioned

by bringing in labor from considerable distances.. They had

employed little, if any, Indian labor.

A plan was developed whereby the OSHA would direct

che construction Itsell, that 15, itselt periorm the

¡unction of general contractor.

Under the plan, the labor

force was to consist of Indians working as apprentices

under either Indian or non-Indian journeyuen, whichever

were available. This plan had the dual benefit of providing

employment to the indians, who were 65 per cent unemployed,

and developing them into skilled workmen. Project plans

were developed envisioning the aforementioned method of

of operation, estimated costs were within statutory limits

and the development plans vere approved by PHA.

The type of operation decided upon is termed force

account operation.

The Pine Ridge project is unique because

it is the first and only project constructed on a force account

basis. All other projects have been, and are constructed

by general contractors on contracts let by the loca

housing authority. Therefore, this was an entirely different

procedure for which IA had only very broad guide lines.

Under normal circumstances, a traveling construction

representative visits each project assigned to him once

each month for about two days for the purpose of determining

that the local housing authority is doing what it should

ba doing, that is conducting adequate and proper inspections,

etc.

HOREVer,

because of the unusual circumstances involved

in the Pine Fidge project, namely, the force account operation

and

the almost total unfamiliarity of the OSHA members with

construction, procedures, etc., it was necessary for HeINTacLiaN

to devote almosi full time to the project initially. He

spent two

to three weeks per nonth at Pine Ridge "until he

got the báll rolling."

The time required dropped gradually

so that at present FEINTZELAN spends about one week per

month at this project.

it is anticipated that it will only be necessary to visit

this project on the same basis other projects are visited.

HEINTZELMAN's function and duties throughout the

Pine Ridge project have been to act as a guide, counselor,

and advisor on construction. He has no authority to

awaro contracts, etc. All operating and cunstruction autho-

rity is within the jurisdiction of the OSH. Board.

the OSHA Board has undoubtedly followed HEINTZELMAN's recommen

dations, and he has for all practical purposes supervised

the construction.

There is no review of bids, etc. Other than by

OSHA personnel and/or HEINTZELMAN. OSaA is the legal owner

of the naterials, etc, and would have authority to dispose

of materials not needed.

PHA would not have any record

of such transactions.

BROWN commented that he is certain that the OSA

has complete records because he cautioned IEINTZELMAN from

the start that he should insure that there is widely circulated

and competitive bidding on everything, and that complete

records are maintained "down to every

nail used" on the project.

BROWN mentioned personnel problems encountered by

OSHA on the project.

OSHA initially employed a construction

superintendent at $10,000 per year who was dismissed at

about the 75 per cent completion state of Project Nunber 1

for failure to periorm his job.

The architect on Project

Number l lailed to do his job during construction and was

di snissed

by OSHA when this project was about 25 per cent

completed. The architect who had designed Project Number 2

quit when

that project was at about the 25 per cent completion

stage because of disagreement regarding design changes.

aVAN Jess, the architect on Project Numbers, was engaged

by Does to

take over on Project Number 2 in adaition to his

employment on Project Humber 3. BROWN said that as a result

0f these personnel problems, the OSHA Board undoubtedly

depended more on FEINZELIAN than they might have otherwise.

He also pointed out that the architect is charged with the

responsibility of compliance inspection.

There were no detailed inspections of the Pine

Ridge project buildings by PHA personnel other than HEINTZELMAN.

There were visits to the project by PHA officials who

observed the work and made, in effect, a general inspection.

These officials included PHA Commissioner MARIE MC GUIRE,

Chicago Regional Director WILLIABI E. BERGERON, BROWN and

others.

BROWN reiterated that the Pine Ridge

project is one

in which there is unusual and special interest because it

is the first on an Indian reservation and the first on

which the force account operation has

been used. Further,

when the project was being originated, the White House

expressed an interest in it.

BROWN commented that HEINTZELMAN attributes the

allegations of irregularities to two disgruntled individuals

on the reservation, namely, Butch, Who was Executive Director

oi the OSHA initially, and

a friend or Brunbh named HOBAR1

KEITH. BREWER was dismissed

as Executive Director by the

NW 68262 Docld:32989685 Page 567

---

## Page 568

CG 46-3873

OSIA Board on HEINZELMAN'S recommendation as he failed to

perform his duties properly, if at all. KEITH was described

as a disgruntled office seeker who ran for some office in

a tribal election, was defeated, and blames HEINTZELMAN 1OI

his defeat despite the fact that HEINTZELMAN had nothing to

do with the election.

The financial records of OSHA were set up by

LOUIS ELLISON, an auditor of the Chicago Regional Office,

who has maintained almost continuous contact with the

project record keeping, again an abnormal situation because

of the unusual nature of this project. ELLISON has never

become aware of any irregularities.

BROWN said he has no knowledge of any irregularities

by HEINTZELLAN or anyone else, and considers any allegations

of irregularities by HEINTZELMAN completely unfounded.

He described HEINTZELMAN as an extremely conscientious and

dedicated employee of the highest integrity.

He said

HEINTZELMAN has done an outstanding job on

the Pine Ridge

project and received a Superior Achievement Award in connection

therewith which was presented to him by PHA Commissioner MARIE

MC GUIRE in Washington, D.C., at a ceremony attended by the

press. Furthermore, BROWN said PHA is proud of the Pine

Ridge

project, the dwellings have been constructed at a cost

lower than usual, for example, the cost of Project Number 2

will run twenty per cent under the architect's estimate and

far below bids by geueral contractors on this project; employ-

ment has been, and is being afforded Indians; many have

learned a trade, and there is now an experienced construction

force on the reservation.

BROWN further commented that general contractors

in the area, at the encouragement and solicitation of the

Builders' Exchange in Rapid City, South Dakota, raised a large

hew and cry when they learned the Pine Ridge project was to

be constructed on a force account basis.

These contractors

complained to Congressmen and Senators that this was un-American,

socialistic, etc. As a result, PHA has had to answer

numerous inquiries from Congressmen and Senators.

However,

all of the accusations made related to the fact the construction

was done by the Indians rather than on contract, and there

- 10 m

CG

have been no allegations of irregularities. He remarked

chat because of the protest, Pha had Osta solicitedbids

for construction of Project Number 2 and the result was

that the bids received were much too high so it was

decided to continue with the force account operation

both on Projects Number 2 and Number 3.

from the housing project, and he advised the Authority

It did have the right to dispose of the property, with

no restrictions.

WUrTZEL exhibited Housing Authority

records reflecting the Authority reaffirmed a previous

action to sell materials at cost to local people.

Records also reilect bids were submitted by Rushville

Lumber Company within specified time. HENRY BLACK ELK,

Jho advised he, as head oi Oglala Sioux Planning

Commission, did request the Housing Authority to make

available materials at cost to local Indians.

RED WING advised he purchased practically all the

ALAN L. WURTZEL contacted Special Agent JOHN E. MC CARTY

and advised he is with the law firm of Strasser, Spiegelberg,

Fried, Frank, and Kampelman of Washington, D. C. which firm

represents the Oglala Sioux Tribe, and the various agencies of

that tribe, including the Oglala Sloux Housing Authority.

Mr. WURTZEL advised he had helped to draw up the contracts

involved in setting up the Housing Authority, and in obtaining

Public Housing Administration assistance in building homes on

the fine Ridge Reservation.

He stated the Housing Authority had on one occasion

requested his legal opinion as to whether it could sell materials

from the project to local Indians at cost, to aid them in repairing,

improving, or adding to their homes. He stated it is his opinion

that under the Annual Contributions Contract, Section 308, the

Housing Authority does have this right, and he so informed the

Authority.

It was his understanding at that time that the

Housing Authority had been selling such materials, and that it

was just checking with him for a legal opinion.

He pointed out

there were no restrictions on the sales, and while there may

have been poor administrative practices followed in selling and

collecting for the materials, he is quite sura there is nothing

more serious than this involved.

wUrTZEL said the architectural firms of Evans

Lucas and Craig and Brooks were dismissed by the Housing Authority,

after the firms had failed to meet the requirements of their

contracts, such as regular inspection of the project. Also the

firms recommended costly

materials which were completely out

of line with the type of project planned and the lunds available.

He stated the Public Housing Administration stated

it would not put anything further into the project unless a change

was made in the Executive Director, then VINCENT BREWER. This

was because EREWER was very weak in office procedures.

As a

result an effort was made to have someone work with BREWER.

BREWER became quite upset and quit his job. He said he knows

BREWER has been quite bitter towards the Public Housing Adminis-

tration, the local Housing Authority, and he himself because

of this.

WURTZEL said Public Housing Acministration auditors

regularly inspect and review the contracts let on the project,

and to date have had no indication of any irregularities involved.

He advised he knows the local Authority did delegate

Mr. HEINTZELMAN the authority to let bids and in general to

build the project. He said he also knows HCINTZELMAN frequently

did discuss proposed changes of any significance with the Authority

members.

He pointed out there has been some dissension about

the project from labor unions and contractors as it is a "Force

Account" project.

However, he said, the project is being completed

with substantially less money than originally planned on.

Mr. WUrTZEL stated that from his own knowledge, and

information he has received, he knows HEINTZELMAN has used

materials in the project which are equal to or better than those

He said it appears to him that HEINTZELMAN has done

a very good job under very trying circumstances, and that while

there may be cause for complaint as to office or administrative

procedures and laxity he can not see where there is anything more

serious involved.

He pointed out his interest is in protecting

the tribal interests, and in his opinion the tribe, and the

government, have not suifered any loss in any way.

ALAN L. WURTZEL requested Special Agant JOHN E. MC CARTY

contact him at the office of the local Housing Authority, which

was done.

Mr. WURTZEL advised records of the office reflect the

bids submitted by the Rushville Lumber Company were submitted

within the specified time.

There is nothing in the bids requiring

they be opened'at a specified time

or date. He pointed out that

on dimension lumber on SD 1-3, the Rushville Lumber Company

received the bid, being $200 under the next bidder. On nails

the Company was

in about the middle of bids submitted, and

did not get the bid.

On concrete blocks it was the lowest of

On roofing materials the

However, the lowest bidder would only deliver in carload lots,

and would not guarantee the price over six months. Because

Rushville Lumber guaranteed the price,

and would deliver in quan-

tities desired, the contract was

awarded to it. On window wells

it was the second highest out of four bidders, and did not get

the contract.

On chimney ilues it was the only bidder or tour

companies contacted, and hence got the bid.

On flooring it was

in the middle of three

bidders, and did not get the contract.

Mr: WURTZEl exhibited a list of changes,

and advised

this list to November 15, 1963 lists each change made in SD 1-2.

changes were discussed by CHARLES HEINTZELMAN with his

superior in the Public Housing Administration Office in Chicago,

with the architect, and, if major changes, were discussed with

the local Authority members, before the changes were made. He

said he has personally heard HCINTZELHAN discuss many changes

and proposed

actions with either individual Authority members,

or the Authority as a whole at its meetings.

hr. WURTzEL advised that at a Special Meeting of the

Oglala Sioux Housing Authority on February 19, 1964, the

minutes reilect the following:

"Some of the minutes of previous meetings

were mislaid. In one of these minutes, HENRY BLACK

Director of the Oglala Sioux Planning Commission. He was

placed under oath, and iurnished the following information:

In connection with his job he is required to try to

get rid of slum areas in pine flage, south bakota. the only

way he can do this is to have local people remodel and renovate

their homes, or build new ones. He felt they could do this

themselves, if they could obtain materials at cost.

He then went to the Oglala Sloux Housing Authority

to tho

early in the spring of 1963. At that time he made the suggestion

to the Housing Authority that it sell materials at cost to

local people to use in fixing up or building their homes.

As he recalls no action was taken on his request in

his presence, and he does not know if any action was ever taken

or not on it.

JAMES RED WING was placed under oath, whereupon he

furnished the following information:

In about October, 1963, he attended a meeting, as a

representative of the puplic health service, with the oglala

At that meeting it was agreed the

Tribe would buy bathroom fixtures and supplios from the

Housing Authority, and resell them to local people for their

own use.

He is on the Board of the Old Age Home, SD 1-2, and has

never had any reason to feel there was anything wrong in the

construction of the home.

He and RICHARD WILSON went together,

and agreed to

build a plumbing shop of concrete blocks,

in Pine Ridge, South

Dakota.

WALLY MEANS erected the block building for him. MEANS

obtained about lilty used and discarded blocks from the

Housing

Project, which were used in his building.

He then purchased

about twenty-two to twenty-three hundred blocks from JOHN MC

GAUHAY, Gordon, Nebraska to be used in erecting the building.

He exhibited four cancelled checks which he advised were used

to pay MC GAUHAY for the blocks he purchased.

RED WING said WILSON told him he could get mortar,

sand, etc. from the project to use in their building, but that

he had to keep a list of the materials he obtained,

and pay

the Housing Authority for it.

He said that as a matter of fact,

they obtained not ever ten dollars worth of building materials

from the project.

VINCENE BREWIR was reinterviewed under oath and

furnished the following information:s.b;

At no time, while he was Executive Director, did he

ever handle the sale

of materials from the project to anyone,

other than the one instance when he determined WILSON was

taking cement blocks tron the project.

He never attended any meeting at which the Housing

Authority, or anyone else, ever gave him the authority to

dispose of materials fron

the project. He has no knowledge of

the fact the Authority ever decided to dispose of any materials

from the project.

Such an arrangement was discussed occasionally,

but as he recalls it was always decided such a practice would

come under the Self Help Program, which had absolutely nothing

to do with the housing project.

BREWER said he has no knowledge of any agreement between

Public Health Service and the local Housing Authority to allow

people to buy materials from the housing project for use in

constructing bathrooms.

He pointed out this could have occurred

after he left the office.

He advised he has no idea where the missing minutes

"I,. Halton Means, of Pine Ridge, South Dakota being

first duly sworn upon oath deposes and says tha: I am thirty

nine years old, and I have worked at various kinds of work in

my life, however I spent four years at a trade school learn

ing to be a bricklayer.

'I was employed on the Oglala Sioux Housing Project

In september 1963 and laid off in December of 1963. I was

hired through an interview with Mr. Heintzelman as a brick-

layer, however,

I was never paid over $3.50 an hour and the

scale was $4.00.

"previous to my termination, Mr. Keith, one of the

Housing Board members, asked me if I had first knowledge of

Mr. Richard Wilson, plumbing supervisor and husband of the

current executive Director, being drunk on the job for several

days, and leaving the job for considerable lengths of time,

making trips to neighboring towns to obtain more booze. I

said I had observed this and he asked me to give him a signed

affidavit, which I did. Later I went to the Housing office to

ask hi. Heintzelman for a job.

Mr. Heintzelman took a very

olligerent attatudo,

said I noticed you signed a statement

about Wilson, I can't use men like you, and get out o1 this

office. I told him I resented his attitude and left.

"During my employment, I borrowed $200.00 from the

Stockman's National Bank of Rushville, Nebraska through Mr..

Albert Dale, President of the bank and a member of the Oglala

Sioux Housing Authority Board. On pay day, my Housing Authority

check was retained by Mr. Dale, I did not sign it, or even see

it, but would received a check from the bank for my wages from

which had been deducted the payment on my loan,

and the Housing

Authority check stub.

It is my observation that all or practically

all of the workmen borrowed money from the bank through Mr. Dale

at various times. It is my opinion that the status of these

loans influenced

the retention on the job.

"The afor mentioned Mr. Richard Wilson, who was

plumbing supervisor for the Housing Authority and whose wife:

is Executive Director, gave myself and Earl Deon Jr. & Saturday

and Sunday job

to build a plunbing shop for him, which ve

"proceeded to do. Mr. Filson instructed us that we should

take the material from the elderly housing job and this had

been cleared with Mr. Heintzelman. He, therefore, took the

building blocks, etcetra from the elderly job, and used them

We naturally thought this

was all right, in as much as hir. Wilson's wife is Executive

Mr.. Wilson agreed to pay us 15¢ a block. We had

a very difficult time getting our money from Mr. Wilson, and

of course he is the same party that me signed the statement

that made Mr. Heintzelman mad at me and refuse to to

re-employ me.

"On the elderly home, when the block work was con-

pleted, I was switched to metal lathing, and put in all the

1ath in 22 bathrooms.

When this was completed, I applied

for the plastering and tile setting work, but was told that

this work was contracted.

I went to the office and asked if

It was contracted, was told that it was, but they would not

let me see the contract without a court

order.

The Housing

Authority requested two tile setters from the Employment

Office, and the Employment Office gave ue a card for one of

these jobs, but when I took it to the man in charge of the

tile setting, he refused to accept me, saying it would cut him

out of work.

"There are a great many rumors about Oglala Sioux

Housing material being used on private work by those tho

are "on the in" with Hr. Heintzelman.

for example, concurrently with his work on the elderly housing,

wired the Mormon Church

and a private home near White Clay,

Nebraska.

It is commonly understood that the material for

chese jobs came oil the elderly home job. To my knowledge,

hr. Richard Wilson, plumbing foreman, did several jobs witt

aterial from the Housing project, including the buildin

hich I worked on on Saturdays and Sundays. He showed me ;

contract for $1, 500.00 which he had for plumbing on a private

nome, the game one spoken of above for the electrician, and

to my knowledge, Mr. Wilson took the material off the elderly

housing job.

poses and gays that:

"I, Bernard LeBeau was employed as Carpenter Fore-

man for the Oglala Sioux Housing Construction from June 1963

to November 1963 at which time I was injured and spent a

month in the hospital.

I returned to work as a carpenter

February 1964 and have been laid off several times from that

date until now.

During my employment on several occasions, I

obtained a loan from Stockman's National Bank, Rushville,

Nebraska thru Mr. Albert Dale who is Bank President and also

Treasurer of the Oglala Sioux Housing Authority. During the

period when I owed the bank, I would not receive my pay check

from the Housing Authority, would not see it and of course

not sign it.

It would be cashed by Mr. Ble and 1 would re-

ceive a check stub from the bank and the banks check for the

balance,

When the final payment was made,

I would receive

the check stub, the banks check for the balance of my wages.

and the note which I had signed.

It is my observation that

all or practically all workmen on the housing project at

times,

had loans from Mr. Dale's bank.

It is my opinion

the status of your employment and retention of employ-

ment was influenced by the status of these loans.

At the time

I was injured and entered the hospital November 1963, I owed

approximately $400.00 to the bank on a note. After my return

to work in February of 1964, there were pay periods in which

Mr. Dale took the entire amount and I never saw my pay check

from the Housing Authority or any othor check.

When in the

hospital my wife was given $120.00 by the Housing Authority

and it was

labeled "advanced payment". Mr. Hentzman at one

however, lT.

Dale took this payment out of my check in addition to his

bank payment and as soon as I finished paying both of these

1 was immediately terminated. It is well known I am

a qualified skilled carpenter, capable of doing finish and trim

work in addition to all other phases of the trade. On two

occasions after I returned to work and received no check at

"all, and I was told the time was not turned in. One week

it involved one day's pay and the other week it involved a

day and a half.

"There are many things I do not understand about

the practices of the Housing Authority. For example, about

July 1963, I, with three other workmen, was sent to build

an addition on a privately built home.

The material used

was from the Housing Authority stock pile and I was paid

along with the others by the Housing Authority. I was in-

structed to do this by ir. Tyler, superintendent and in

another instance, an addition was built by Housing Authority

personnel and material on orders of Mr. Tyler, and I under-

stand fir. Tyler instructed the man it would cost $1,000.00.

I worked on this job and was paid for my labor with a Housing

Authority check.
