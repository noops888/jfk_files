administration the net salary plus federal and state piyroll
taxes from various OEO programs were deposited into a special
OST payroll account at the Stockman National Bank, The
money in this account was used to pay salaries of persons
working for the various OEO programs and was supposed to be
used to pay federal and state payroll taxes. For many months
prior to the WILSON administration, the federal and state
payroll tax reports were not filed by the OST treasurer under
the ONE FEATHIR administration. As a result of this, the
monies in the special OST payroll account gradually built up
to a balance of approximately $230,000, About this time the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) came in and audited the payroll
of the various OEO programs which were being paid by the GT,
As a result of this IRS audit, the IRS assessed the CST at an
amount exceeding the $230,000 balance which had built up in
the special OST payroll account. The OST used the entizxe
balance of the $230,000 in the special payroll account and
also had to borrow money from the Stockman National Bank

and the OEO in order to pay che IRS the back payroll tax
assessment.

Since the WILSON administration took over, the
Special OST payroll account has been operating very smoothly,
and all federal and state payroll taxes have been filed
timely by EMMA NELSON,

The IRS in Rapid City, South Dakota is the office
that conducted the audit of the OST payroll, They can
furnish more detailed information concerning this matter.

In the past WILSON has been involved in what some
people might call "shady deals" but since he beeame president
of the OST, JOHNSON believes that WILSON is conducting the
affairs of OST honest and completely above board. WILSON
is no more honest or dishonest than was GERALD ONE FEATHER
or any of the other Tribal presidents over the past many years,

The First National Benk of Gordon, Nebraska i
maintains various checking accounts of the OST involving
their programs with the OHO, i

$65,000 for a street repair contract. An Oglala Sioux
Tribal Councilman also alleged WILSON intercepted
$650,000 destined for a street improvement program and
deposited the money in a Gordon, Nebraska, bank. Inves-

School, at which time he provided the following information:

He resides in a white trailer home on the left
hand side of route 18 approximately four miles east of Pine
Ridge, South Dakota. His date of birth is February 4, 1947.

He held the position of Program Director, Indian
Action Team (IAT) from August 1, 1973, until he resigned

Last year he realized approximately $110,000.00
of Iar funds was budgeted but probably would not be used. ~
In January, 1974, he conferred with the Bureau of Indian
Affairs (BIA) Technical Assistance Center in Denver,
Colorado, regarding his desire to establish a Cement Batch
Plant run by the tribe. BIA approved the project based upon
a subsequent approval by the Oglala Sioux Tribal Council.

In the same month the Tribal Council approved the project
and passed a resolution to that effect.

In approximately February, 1974, he mentioned
to DICK WILSON, Oglala Sioux Tribal President, he had sent
JOE BLUE HORSE to Denver, Colorado, to purchase a truck
for the Cement Batch Plant. WILSON “ordered " him to
recall BLUE.HORSE and not to purchase a truck as he 5
(WILSON) was buying a truck and the Cement Batch Plant
was to buy all gravel from him (WILSCN). The gravel, he
noted, was a crushed limestone.

He hired IKE BETTELYOUN to operate the Batch
Plant. WILSON's men, under the name Lakota Sand and Gruvel
Company (Lakota), owned by RICHARD (MANNIE) WILSON, JR.,
DICK WILSON's son, began to haul the gravel. He noted

WILSON, previous to this, had the Oglala Sioux Tribal
Council pass a resolution stating all tribal businesses
must purchase materials from other tribal businesses, if
available. :

However, he personally observed on many occasions
Lakota using a Government trailer and a Government truck
to haul the gravel. He knew they were Government vehicles
as the vehicles had Government license plates. He also
knew the delivery was to the Batch Plant, not a BIA project
inasmuch as the vehicles were observed by him delivering

gravel to the Batch Plant gravel pit. STANLEY WALKER,

Superintendent, BIA Roads Department, authorized IAT to
utilized Government vehicles not in use; he was not sure
if Lakota was authorized to use the vehicles.

He kept copies of 69 delivery tickets which
were submitted to him by DICK WILSON, JR., or DICK WILSON,
SR., while he was with IAT. The.delivery tickets represent
gravel obtained from Hills Material Company, Hot Springs,
South Dakota, by Lakota and all were dated June, 1974,
IAT paid these and subsequent bills. The total amount for
the 69 deliveries was approximately $3,450.00. The invoice

. The paymerit to Hills Material Company was for the
cost of gravel. Lakota also charged IAT for the gravel,
$2.00 a ton, and for delivery, $5.00 a ton, on the instructions
of DICK WILSON, SR.

These bills were presented to FLOYD (BILL)PULLIUM
who paid them with an IAT check.” The checks were payable
to Hills Material Company and Lakote.

In early July, 1974, he was talking to LEWIS PRYOR,
Plant Manager, BIA, Pine Ridge, South Dakota, who told hin
BIA was also paying Lakota for gravel. He surmised the
payment by BIA was for the same gravel IAT paid for as there
were no other projects he knew of at that time requiring
gravel.

He heard in July, 1974, source not recalled,
BILL CUNY paid DICK WILSON or Lakota $10,000.00 for leveling tw
industrial lots for the Cement Batch Plant when neither
WILSONnor Lakota actually did the work, The leveling was
conpleted in May, 1974, by IAT. ae

He also heard from JACK WATERS, date not recalled,
that JIM WILSON told DICK WILSON "we" received $65,000.00 for th
street improvement contract. WATERS was then a heavy

He knew nothing of DICK WILSON using Tribal funds
for his personal use through deposits in a bank in Gordon,

FLOYD E. TAYLOR, Representative, Economic Development
Administration (EDA), Department of Commerce, Pierre, South Dakota,
was telephonically contacted at (605) 224-1238, at which time he
provided the following information:

The EDA recently approved a grant of $610,000 to the
Oglala Sioux Indian Tribe for street improvements at Pine Ridge,
South Dakota. The improvements consist of curb and gutter
construction as well as the paving of streets. However, to date
no disbursements have been made by EDA. Disbursements will be made
upon the receiving of final specifications and plans.

The firm which was awarded the contract as prime
contractor was Dakota Contracting, Incorporated, Sioux Falls,
South Dakota. Dakota Contracting, Inc., submitted the lowest bid
and was approved based upon experience, capability and know-how;
a performance bond was also required.

EDA is not aware of the sub-contractors employed by
Dakota Contracting, Inc., but Dakota Contracting, Inc., would award
sub-contracts to the lowest bidders inasmuch as Dakota Contracting,
Inc., is a private concern with a profit) motive in mind. Dakota
Contracting Inc., must absorb any excessive costs including those
from sub-contractors.

The Tribe was the applicant for the paving project.
When the project is completed the Tribe will be the sole owner,
operator and maintainer of the completed construction. The funds
when disbursed will not be made directly to the Tribe but will be
submitted to a bank in increments based upon the submission of
vouchers and receipts of work. The monies when disbursed will be
deposited into a "special account", the title of which will
spell out the road construction project in Pine Ridge, South Dakota.
No disbursements will bemade to an account in the name of the Tribe
or in the name of an individual. Disbursements are purposely made to
“special accounts" as it is EDA policy not to mix those funds with
their Tribal funds. .

The Tribe initiated the soliciting of bids through
PECs ess erat engineers Dana, Larson and Roubal and Associates,
e, South Dakota.

nr

Although no EDA disbursements have been made to date
he believed interim financing was obtained by the Tribe through a
Gordon, Nebraska, bank. Interim financing is normally obtained
to begin the project following the approval of the initial
grant.

Fhe interim financing account, if it does exist, would
also be a "special account”, and would not exceed 25% of the grant.
These monies would be disbursed by the bank on the basis of receipts
and vouchers and would be audited by EDA at the end of the project.
Interest expense charged by the bank would be paid by EDA.

Synopsis: A former employee of the Indian Action Team (IAT), a
vocational training program located on the Pine Ridge
Indian Reservation, South Dakota, alleged a company he
believed was controlled by RICHARD WILSON, SR., Oglala
Sioux Tribal President, was charging both IAT and BIA
for the same gravel and using government vehicles to haul
the gravel. He also alleged the company was illegally
paid $10,000 for leveling two.industrial lots in Pine
Ridge, South Dakota, and WILSON was paid a kickback of
$65,000 for a street repair contract. An Oglala Sioux
Tribal Councilman also alleged WILSON intercepted
$650,000 destined for a street improvement program and
deposited the money in a Gordon, Nebraska, bank. Inves-
tigation regarding the alleged gravel fraud continuing.
Investigation disclosed the company used at least one
government trailer without proper authorization and with
WILSON's knowledge. Investigation failed to support the
allegations regarding the payments of $10,000, 865,000
and $650,000.

He resides in a white trailer home on the left

He held the position of Program Director, Indian
Action Team (IAT) from August 1, 1973, until he resigned

Last year he realized approximately $110,000.00
of IAT funds was budgeted but probably would not be used. ~
In January, 1974, he conferred with the Bureau of Indian
Affairs (BIA) Technical Assistance Center in Denver,
Colorado, regarding his desire to establish a Cement Batch
Plant run by the tribe. BIA approved the project based upon
a subsequent approval by the Oglala Sioux Tribal Council.

In the same month the Tribal Council approved the project
and passed a resolution to that effect.

In approximately February, 1974, he mentioned
to DICK WILSON, Oglala Sioux Tribal President, he had sent
JOB BLUE HORSE to Denver, Colorado, to purchase a truck
for the Cement Batch Plant. WILSON “ordered " him to
recall BLUE. HORSE and not to purchase a truck as he -
(WILSON) was buying a truck and the Cement Batch Plant
was to buy all gravel from him (WILSON). The gravel, he
noted, was a crushed limestone.

He hired IKE BETTELYCUN to operate the Batch
Plant. WILSON's men, under the name Lakota Sand and Guvel

WILSON, previous to this, had the Oglala Sioux Tribal

must purchase materials from other tribal businesses, if
available. :
in However, he personally observed on many occasions
Lakota using a Government trailer and a Government truck
to haul the gravel. He knew they were Government vehicles
as the vehicles had Government license plates. He also
knew the delivery was to the Batch Plant, not a BIA project
inasmuch as the vehicles were observed by him delivering
“gravel to the Batch Plant gravel pit. STANLEY WALKER,
Superintendent, BIA Roads Department, authorized IAT to
utilized Government vchicles not in use; he was not sure
if Lakota was authorized to use the vehicles.

He kept capies of 69 delivery tickets which
were submitted to him by DICK WILSON, JR., or DICK WILSON,
SR., while he was with IAT. The.delivery tickets represent
gravel obtained from Hills Material Company, Hot Springs,
South Dakota, by Lakota and all were dated June, 1974,
; IAT paid these and subsequent bills. The total amount for
the 69 deliveries was approximately $3,450.00. The invoice

: The payment to Hills Material Company was for the
cost of gravel. Lakota also charged IAT for the gravel,
$2.00 a ton, and for delivery, $5.00 a ton, on the instructions
of DICK WILSON, SR.

These bills were presented to FLOYD (BILL)PULLIUM
who paid them with an IAT check.” The checks were payable
to Hills Material Company and Lakota.

In early July, 1974, he was talking to LEWIS PRYOR,
Plant Manager, BIA, Pine Ridge, South Dakota, who told hin
BIA was also paying Lakota for gravel. He surmised the
payment by BIA was for the same gravel IAT paid for as there

FLOYD E. TAYLOR, Representative, Economic Development
Administration (EDA), Department of Commerce, Pierre, South Dakota,
was telephonically contacted at (605) 224-1238, at which time he
provided the following information: :

The EDA recently approved a grant of $610,000 to the
Oglala Sioux Indian Tribe for street improvements at Pine Ridge,
South Dakota. The improvements consist of curb and gutter
construction as well as the paving of streets. However, to date
no disbursements have been made by EDA. Disbursements will be made
- upon the receiving of final specifications and plans.

The firm which was awarded the contract as prime
contractor was Dakota Contracting, Incorporated, Sioux Falls,
South Dakota, Dakota Contracting, Inc., submitted the lowest bid
and was approved based upon experience, capability and know-how;
a performance bond was also required.

EDA is not aware of the sub-contractors employed by
Dakota Contracting, Inc., but Dakota Contracting, Inc., would award
sub-contracts to the lowest bidders inasmuch as Dakota Contracting,
Inc., is a private concern with a profit motive in mind. Dakota
Contracting Inc., must absorb any excessive costs including those
from sub-contractors. ai

The Tribe was the applicant for the paving project.
When the project is completed the Tribe will be the sole owner,
operator and maintainer of the completed construction. The funds
when disbursed will not be made directly to the Tribe but will be
submitted to a bank in increments based upon the submission of
vouchers and receipts of work. The monies when disbursed will be
deposited into a "special account", the title of which will
spell out the road construction project in Pine Ridge, South Dakota.
No disbursements will bemade to an account in the name of the Tribe
or in the name of an individual. Disbursements are purposely made to
“special accounts" as it is EDA policy not to mix those funds with
their Tribal funds, Sete

The Tribe initiated the soliciting of bids through
@ professional engineers Dana, Larson and Roubal and Associates,
vierre, South Dakota.

Although no EDA disbursements have been made to date
he believed interim financing was obtained by the Tribe through a
don, Nebraska, bank. Interim financing is normally obtained
to begin the project following the approval of the initial
rant.

The interim financing account, if it does exist, would
also be a "special account", and would not exceed 25% of the grant.
These monies would be disbursed by the bank on the basis of receipts
and vouchers and would be audited by ZDA at the end of the project.
Interest expense charged by the bank would be paid by EDA.

Since RICHARD WILSON became president of the
. Oglaia Sioux Tribe in January, 1972, ONE FEATHER has been
working with both the American Indian Movement (AIM) and the
i Oglala Sioux Tribal Council in an effort to improve the criminal
| justice system and the financial status of the Oglala Sioux
Tribe on the Pine Ridge Reservation.

ONE FEATHER suspects Chairman WILSON of many
wrongdoings since becoming chief of the Oglala Sioux Tribe,
but he has no direct proof or evidence which could be used
against WILSON in a court of Law. Since WILSON becane
president, he has suspended and fired many competent
people who were associated with the Tribal Council because
these people would not cooperate with WILSON in carrying
out various "deal" which WILSON was trying to do.

WILSON suspended the Office of Economic Opportunity
(OKO) Headstart Director HATTIE TWISS, because she would not
cooperate with WILSON concerning the payment of approximately
ten to fifteen thousand dollars to WILSON's brother, JAMES
3. WILSON, for some type of consulting fees he received
through the Headstart program. TWISS can he Located at the
hospital in Gordon, Nebraska.

Since WILSON took office in January, 1972, the
books and records for the Oglala Sioux Tribe have not been
audited and according to several members of the Tribal
Council, the records which are currently being kept are
very inadequate.

During the ONE FEATHER administration, the
accointing firm of Thorstenson and Sayler in Rapid City
was vesponsible for auditing the books and records of the
Oglala Sioux Tribe. Also, an accountant named FRANCIS
KILLER, who lives in Vermillion, South Dakota, and whess tele-

to do monthly accounting work for the Tribe. KILLER's contract

Gordon, Nebraska and provided the following information:

She was Director for the Office of Economic
. Opportunity (OEO) Headstart Program until October, 1972,
at which time she resigned because of wrongdoings on the
part of RICHARD WILSON, President of the Oglala Sioux Tribe
(OST). WILSON was trying to get access to the Headstart
funds which she controlled but she would not allow him
access to the funds.

During the first part of October, 1972, she
became i111 and had to go into the hospital for a week, When
she returned to work she discovered that WILSON had drawn
$14,000 from the Headstart account. There way no allowance
for this withdrawal at the Headstart project and WILSON
would not account for what the $14,000 was spent for. The
check that was written for the $14,000 bore HATTIE TWISS'
signature, but she did not sign the check, At this point,
she was fed up with the way WILSON was operating and
harrassing her, so she turned in her resignation,

She could furnish no details concerning the payment
of $10,000 to $15,000 to WILSON's brother, JAMES WILSON;
however, FRANCIS KILLER of Vermillion, South Dakota has
the gtails Surrounding this payment. KILLER was the
accountant for the OST at the time this disbursement was
Supposedly made to WILSON's brother.

There has been much wrongdoing on the part of
DICK WILSON since he took office in April, 1972, He has
continuously attempted to gain control of the various OO
funds, and used these funds for purposes which would not
benefit the Sioux people,

DAVE LONG, vice president of the OST, can furnish

7 810 Qiincy Street, Rapid City (telephone 342-5630),
provided the following information:

The accounting services which Sayler, Thorstenson
and Company provide for the Oglala Sioux Tribe (OST)
are yearly audits of the following OST special programs:

1, Revolving Credit Fund - this fund borzows
money from the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and re-loans
this money to various tribai enterprises and indivduals;

| 2, Short Term Loan Program ~ this fund makes
small loans, usually less than $250, to individuals of
the OST;

8. Land Acquisition Enterprise ~ this fund
purchases land within the bowidaries of the Pine Ridge
Reservation, i

The Last audit condueted on the aforementioned-
three funds was in June, 1972, The findings of all prior
audits of these funds has always resulted in either a
qualified or a disclaimer of opinion for the audit. The
primary reason shat all the audits have been qualified
i and/or disclaimer opinions is because of the tardiness
i of the recordkeeping of the above-three funds. However,
a full-scale audit has always been conducted and in this
\ capacity, the auditing standards and procedures which have
| been utilized would have uncovered any misappropriation,
fraud or embezzlement which might have been taking place
in these funds.

OST Chairman DICK WILSON has no control or for
that matter any influence over the above funds and because
of the nature of these funds and the checks and balances

He does not know anything concerning his brother, JIN

EMBEZZLEMENT OF INDIAN PROPERTY

On 10/3/69 telephonic complaint was received from

Agency Special Officer, Pine Ridge, S.D., in which
allegations were made that MOUSSEAU had embezzled and
misapplied tribal funds. An accounting exam was made

of the paid checks, bank statements, checkbook stubs,

and other available records. It was determined MOUSSEAU
as Director of Sun Dance, had received $8000 from the
tribe. After the event there was a balance remaining in
the account of $19.62. There were $689.14 in outstanding
checks and $1,035.23 in unpaid bills. MOUSSEAU had
received $742 as reimbursement for his expenses, which
canriot be supported by documentary evidence. MOUSSEAU
also purchased with Sun Dance funds tires for his personal
auto for $101.12 and linoleum for the floor in the house
he rents from the tribe for $47.42. Tribal authority

was granted to JACK STEELE to run a rodeo in connection
with the Sun Dance. MOUSSEAU and RICHARD A. WILSON formed
a committee to run the rodeo, refused to allow STEELE to
participate, and used the rodeo stock of a second indivi-
dual, paying $1,114.74 to him, all without tribal authority.
MOUSSEAU transferred $1600 of Sun Dance money to the
rodeo account without tribal authorization. The balance *°
in the rodeo account at date of examination was zero, with
12 checks unaccounted for. MOUSSEAU received $127 from
this account as reimbursement for expenses which cannot
be supported by documentary evidence.

LAWRENCE J, GLOVER (NA), Special Officer, Pine Ridge
Reservation, advised he had received a complaint from
THEODORE "RED" TIBBITTS, Sth member of the Executive Committee
of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, on October 2, 1969, in which TIBBITTS
stated his suspicions that there has been an embezzlement of
tribal funds.

The complaint states that subject ROBERT MOUSSEAU,
Indian male, Pine Ridge, South Dakota, appropriated tribal funds
illegally to his own use, such funds having been entrusted to
him as director of the Sun Dance. GLOVER provided xerox copies
of the following documents:

An undated petition wherein certain members of the
Treaty Council requesting the Pine Ridge Superintendent to produce
minutes and records of expenditures of tribal funds for the
Sun Dance;

The Letter dated September 30, 1969, from BRICE LAY,
Superintendent, to the Tribal Court, presenting the petition to
said Court;

A copy of the Tribal Court Order, ordering the books
and records of the Sun Dance to be produced.

In addition, GLOVER provided paid checks and bank
statements of the Oglala Sioux Tribe Sun Dance for the period
September 5, 1968, through September 5, 1969, and paid checks and
bank statements for the Oglala Sioux Stampede for the period
July 21, 1969, through September 11, 1969. These bank statements
and checks on the above accounts were obtained by GLOVER from
THEODORE "RED" TIBBITTS and WALLACE LITTLE FINGER, TIBBETTS and
LITTLE FINGER having stated they obtained same from Stockman's
National Bank, Rushville, Nebraska, where the accounts are
maintained.

GLOVER further stated both he and Superintendent BRICE
LAY are very desirous of obtaining a federal prosecution in this
matter should a case be developed because ROBERT MOUSSEAU is a
well-known troublemaker and thief and has caused many problems to
law enforcement on the Pine Ridge Reservation.

THEODORE "RED" TIBBITTS, Pine Ridge, South Dakota,
provided the following information:

He is the 5th member of the Executive Committee of the
Oglala Sioux Tribe, Pine Ridge Reservation. ROBERT MOUSSEAU was
appointed Director of the Sun Dance by the Tribal Council. The
Tribal Council had provided $5,000 operating expenses in its annual
budget to be used for the Sun Dance. Approximately two - three
days prior to the staging of the Sun Dance, MOUSSEAU requested
an additional $3,000 from the Executive Board in order to pay
numerous outstanding bills. This request was denied.

Several days later he requested an amount believed to
be $400 from WALLACE LITTLE FINGER, Tribal Treasurer, so that the
gate men could make change. LITTLE FINGER gave this money to
MOUSSEAU .

A special meeting was held after the Sun Dance was
over, and the Tribal Committee approved the payment of an additional
$3,000 to MOUSSEAU for Sun Dance expenses. Because of the request
for additional money, the Executive Board became suspicious of
the handling of the funds. In addition, other members of the
Tribe were also suspicious and petitioned the Reservation
Superintendent for an audit.

A Tribal Court Order was then served upon the Executive
Board to produce the records. MOUSSEAU agreed to provide the
records, but subsequently called the Tribal coumsel (attorney)
in Washington, D. C., and was advised to plead immunity.

TIBBITTS stated he and WALLACE LITTLE FINGER then went
to the Stockman's National Bank in Rushville, Nebraska, and
obtained the checks and bank statements for the Sun Dance and
the Stampede and gave these to Special Officer LARRY GLOVER.

TIBBITTS stated ENOS POOR BEAR, Chairman of the Tribal
Council, will have the minutes of the meetings outlining their
authorizations. LITTLE FINGER will have records of expenditures.

TIBBITTS further related that this is the first
year the stampede or rodeo was to be held. The Tribal Council
authorized JACK STEELE to rum the rodeo and pay a percentage
of his profit to the tribe. STEELE is a part-time rodeo
promoter with no connection to ROBERT MOUSSEAU. Certain of the
rodeo equipment was obtained with a lease-purchase agreement
through Dakota Leasing Equipment in Rapid City.

TIBBITTS further stated MOUSSEAU had obtained money
from Velmats Cafe, which was rented for August and September at
$75 per month, totaling $150. A receipt was issued. This money
has never been received by the tribe. MOUSSEAU stated he
placed the money in the Tribal Treasurer's Office at a time
when the safe was Locked and there was no one present there.

ENOS POOR BEAR, President of the Tribal Council,
Oglala Sioux Tribe, Pine Ridge, South Dakota, advised that
the Council had appointed ROBERT J. MOUSSEAU Sun Dance
Director and PAUL APPLE Assistant Director. These two
individuals are responsible to the Council for the‘ operation
of the Sun Dance.

At the time the Sun Dance was run, "RED" TIBBITTS,
5th member of Council, WALLACE LITTLE FINGER, Treasurer, and
LLOYD EAGLE BULL, all served on the Executive Committee. The
Council had appropriated the sum of $5,000 to run the Sun
Dance. Prior to the operation of the event, MOUSSEAU requested
$300 in order to make change at the gate. He was given the
amount by WALLACE LITTLE FINGER.

There was a Special Session of Council called by
LLOYD EAGLE BULL, which later appropriated an additional $3,000
in Sun Dance funds. JACK STEELE was authorized to run the
Sioux Stampede (rodeo). STEELE apparently had a falling-out
with RICHARD WILSON, who was apparently ramrodding the stampede.
When this occurred, JACK POURIER was brought in to provide the
rodeo stock.

There was no money appropriated by the Tribe to be
used for the stampede. Neither was there any authorization to
use Sun Dance money for the stampede.

POOR BEAR provided copies of the following documents:

Minutes of the Oglala Sioux Tribe Council, Regular
Session’, April 8 - 29, and May L - 8, 1969;

Minutes of the Oglala Sioux Tribe Council, Special

WALLACE LITTLE FINGER, Pine Ridge, South Dakota,
advised he is the treasurer of the Oglala Sioux Tribe,
A subpoena duces tecum may be addressed to Mr. LITTLE FINGER
to obtain financial records of the tribe.

ROBERT MOUSSEAU and PAUL APPLE were appointed as
directors of the Oglala Sioux Sun Dance by the tribal
council and a budget of $5000 was allotted for operating
expenses, LITTLE FINGER stated that because of past
problems involved with the Sun Dance, he did not wish
to participate in its operation and therefore he took
annual leave at that time. He had written a check
drawn on the regular tribal funds in the amount of $5000
to enable the Sun Dance to start up. Two days before
the Sun Dance was to have occurred, MOUSSEAU appeared
before the tribal council and stated he was broke and
: asked for an additional allocation of $3000. As this
t amount was not in the budget, MOUSSEAU did not obtain the
| money at this time, The tribal council at a later meeting
voted to revise the budget and granted MOUSSEAU the
additional $3000, Also, just prior to the staging of
the Sun Dance, MOUSSEAU requested he be given $300 in
order to make change, As this $300 was not returned
following the Sun Dance, this amount was deducted from
the $3000 later given to MOUSSEAU for the Sun Dance,
This $300 represents the only money the tribe had
received as proceeds from the Sun Dance.

LITTLE FINGER further related according to the
administrative policy of the tribe, approval by the
council or the executive board must be obtained in order
for per diem to be received for travel off the reservation,
The per diem rate is usually $20 per day for long trips and
$7 to $12 for short trips, including Rapid City. LITTLE FINGER
stated he does not know anything about the operation or
financing of the Oglala Sioux Stampede,

On October 16, 1969, the facts in this matter
obtained as of that date were discussed at his request with
BRICE LAY, Superintendent, Pine Ridge Indian Reservation.
ALso present at this conference was Agency Special Officer
LAWRENCE GLOVER (NA).

Both LAY and GLOVER expressed a strong desire for
federal prosecution in this case as ROBERT MOUSSEAU, RICHARD
WILSON, and PAUL APPLE are considered by them to be constantly
involved in illegal operations and in stealing from the Oglala
Sioux Tribe of which MOUSSEAU, WILSON, and APPLE are officers
and/or council members.

It was felt by LAY and GLOVER that a conviction,
even of a misdemeanor with a suspended sentence, would go a
Long way toward halting the thievery and stealing which runs
rampant on the reservation.

or Acting President shall be issued in advance for all
travel to be performed by travel officials and employees.
Such authorizations, which include dates of travel,
places of travel, per diem rates, account to be charged,
mode of travel, mileage rate and related information. Each
travel authorization shall be signed by the Treasurer to
assure conformance with the approved budget and shall be
approved by the President or the Acting President of the
Executive Committee.

"5. Certified Statement of Travel Expenses. Within
ten days after the completion of any travel which has been
properly authorized, the Traveler will file with the
Finance Officer a certified statement of travel performed
by voucher form. This statement will be attached to the
payment voucher to support payment of travel expenses.
This statement will be required even though a cash advance
may have been made, and failure to file such a statement
will be sufficient cause for appropriate action against
the traveler as deemed by the Executive Committee. The
Treasurer shall certify all travel vouchers as to amount
authorized for payment in accordance with Tribal regulations."

ROBERT J, MOUSSEAU, Pine Ridge, South Dakota, was
interviewed in the Pine Ridge Reservation Police Station
in the presence of Police Lieutenant FRED TWO BULLS.
He was advised of the official identity of the interviewing
agent and was advised that the nature of the interview was
concerning the embezzlement of tribal funds. MOUSSEAU
was advised of his constitutional rights by presentation
of an Advice of Rights Form, After reading this form,
he agreed to waive his rights and signed a Waiver of
Rights form, MOUSSEAU provided the following information:

He is secretary of the Oglala Sioux Tribe and
was Sun Dance director for the year 1969, The tribal
council had given JACK STEELE a contract to put on a
rodeo in conjunction with the annual Sun Dance. The
agreement was the tribe was to get twenty-five percent
of the profit and STEELE, seventy~five percent,

DICK WILSON and MOUSSEAU took it upon themselves
to handle the rodeo, as no committee had been appointed
by the tribe, Several attempts have been made to contatt
STEELE to help plan the rodeo but he could not be reached,
A meeting was called for rodeo planning by WILSON which
MOUSSEAU could not attend. Afterwards, WILSON told MOUSSEAU
that STEELE had backed out of the rodeo because he was not
getting enough money. WILSON said JACK POURIER would take
the rodeo, so the committee gave it to him, feeling that
they could not get anyone else from the outside,

The arrangement with JACK POURIER was a 50 ~ 50
split with the tribe, There was no tribal approval for the
change in contract, MOUSSEAU continued stating the tribe
authorized the rodeo with no money, He told the tribal
council in special session he was going to use Sun Dance
money for the rodeo, At this point MOUSSEAU was provided
with a copy of the minutes of the tribal council for the
pertinent periods, and he was unable to find any reference
to his having so notified the tribal council.

MOUSSEAU said he told the council he did not
want to run the Sun Dance and felt a committee should do so,
The council decided that the executive committee of the
tribe would be the Sun Dance committee,

The rodeo has lost money because entry fees
amounting to $60 to $80 were paid by checks which were not
good, MOUSSEAU expects the All American Indian Activities
Association to make good on these checks, In regard to
the receipts by the Sun Dance and the Stampede, MOUSSEAU
stated tickets were sold at the rodeo but were not accounted
for. Admission was gained to the Sun Dance by stamping
the hands of people as they paid, He could not see anything
wrong with this system, as it has always been like this,

In regard to the transfer of funds from the Sun Dance to
the rodeo, MOUSSEAU stated he assumed that since both
activities were tribal sponsored, the money could be
interchanged.

WALLACE LITTLE FINGER, Tribal Treasurer, gave
him, MOUSSEAU, the checkbook for the Sun Dance and
stated he did not want anything to do with it,

As to the booster trip made to Rapid City,
MOUSSEAU said he took eight to ten people from Pine Ridge
and got several more indians who lived in Rapid City to
participate, JACK FASH (phonetic) promoted and suggested
the idea, Transportation to Rapid City was provided by
tribal station wagon and two Government cars (General Services
Administration), MILES BOLLINGER, Superintendent of
Schools, approved the use of these vehicles, The group
traveled to Rapid City. Upon arrival there, MOUSSEAU
paid for the lunch in the amount of approximately $30,00
Following the meal, these people went to the Greyhound
Race Track where they put on several dances in the middle
of the field. MOUSSEAU stated the Sun Dance lost money
because of the rodeo, He stated the filming of the Sun
Dance and the rodeo by CASEY TIBBS and JOEL MC RAY was set
up by LLOYD EAGLE BULL and himself, The only payment they
got was one buffalo: MOUSSEAU feels the tribe should have
been paid much more than this,

"MOUSSEAU is not aware of any policy on per diem

or tribal authorization needed to obtain per diem payments
while on a trip.

MOUSSEAU was shown a copy of the administrative
procedure of the Oglala Sioux Tribe and it was pointed out
where such policy exists, authorization is required,
MOUSSEAU then stated the policy was not followed by anyone,
When inquiries were made as to.the work provided for the
Sun Dance by PAUL APPLE, MOUSSEAU stated APPLE was a
foreman and worked on just about everything in regard to
the Sun Dance, even appearing on television, He was also
in charge of prisoner labor, When questioned about the
payments to himself of per diem, MOUSSEAU stated these
were for trips which he had made all through the Black
Hills and to the Rosebud Reservation where he was advertising
the Sun Dance, putting up posters, looking for ideas, etc.
He was unable to provide any information or documentation
as to the dates of these trips, the times involved, or
exactly what each trip was for, He was unable to relate
checks to specific dates, When questioned as to the
$250 check received by him for "operating expenses and
advertising", MOUSSEAU was unable to provide any concrete
information in support of this item, He stated that he
paid people to advertise the Sun Dance and to talk it up
at Pow Wows; these were Toka Indians who were paid amounts
of $5, $10, or $15 depending on how big the Pow Wow was,
MOUSSEAU gave these people cash and did not obtain receipts,
He was unable to name any of the people who obtained this
money, He further stated this check was to cover use of
his car for advertising, which was not included in the
per diem payments. When questioned about the amount of
$85 noted as being for "technical assistance", MOUSSEAU
stated "That's what it was for, technical assistance",

He elaborated by saying this could be construed as being
his pay for running the Sun Dance, At this point MOUSSEAU
stated it is his belief the Executive Committee of the tribe
took action two or three weeks before the Sun Dance in
which the Sun Dance Committee would "pay for everything".

In regard to the four tires purchased from
Pine Ridge Husky Service Station, MOUSSEAU admitted these
tires were placed on his car. He said it was his understanding
that they would be on his regular bill, However, MOUSSEAU
did admit that he reviewed the charge slips submitted by
Husky Service Station to the Sun Dence and had seen the
charges for the tires, However, he paid the bill fyom the
Sun Dance fund anyway.

When questioned about the amount paid to
Hinn Hardware for linoleum, MOUSSEAU stated that this
was a tribal house and was in need of repair and |
therefore felt the tribe should pay for it. He stated
he also had obtained pressed wood panels for under the
linoleum from Rushville Lumber Company and other sources,

concerning the embezzlement of tribal funds. WILSON
was advised of his constitutional rights by presentation
of an Advice of Rights Form, After reading this form,
he agreed to waive his rights and signed a Waiver of -
Rights form, WILSON provided the following information:

eee The tribal council took action to permit JACK STEELE
to put on a rodeo in conjunction with the annual Sun Dance,
He was to provide and install equipment etc. The tribe
was to get twenty-five percent of the profits and STEELE,
seventy-five percent, After this had been agreed to,
the tribe included advertisements for the rodeo or stampede
on the posters and advertisements for the Sun Dance,

STEELE had located the needed equipment in
Sioux Falls, The tribe bought this equipment on a lease
arrangement as STEELE was not able to come up with the
money to purchase it on his own. The equipment came
from Dakota Leasing, who also gave the Oglala Sioux Tribe
$600 which was added to the amount of lease to bring the
entire agreement up to $2500. The committee needed the
additional $600 for fences and other expenses.

Since the tribe bought the equipment, the
committee felt the deal should be the tribe receiving
seventy-five percent and STEELE twenty-five percent,
STEELE had apparently made an additional deal for use
of very expensive bulls at the rodeo and wanted more
money to handle this increased cost,

About thirteen days before the show was to be
put on a meeting was held, STEELE could not be pinned
down by the members of the committee regarding the contract,

JACK STEELE, Pine Ridge, provided the following
information:

As a sideline he is in the business of promoting
rodeos and providing stock for use in rodeos. He had obtained
approval from the Oglala Sioux Tribal Council to run a rodeo
in connection with the annual Sun Dance to be held in 1969.
STEELE stated he has a partner who usually works with him in
these events who is CHARLIE KRAMER of Chadron, Nebraska.

Approximately a week or a little longer before the
Sun Dance, STEELE and KRAMER attended a meeting for the purpose
of getting the rodeo organized. This meeting may have occurred
approximately at the end of July. Present at this meeting were
DICK WILSON, JACK POURIER, DAVE POURIER, LLOYD TWISS, and
"JUNIOR" TWISS. BOB MOUSSEAU was not present.

STEELE and KRAMER did not Like the deal which was
offered to them by the committee. They wanted 75 per cent of
the proceeds with 25 per cent going to the Tribe. For the 75
per cent, STEELE was to provide the stock, get cowboys, handle
the advertising, etc. The 75 per cent is his usual fee.

In this case, however, the tribe was going to provide
the advertising and prisoner labor. A deal was offered to
STEELE and KRAMER for 50 per cent. They did not Like this cut
and left the meeting to talk the matter over. They went to a
bar in White Clay, Nebraska, in order to discuss the matter and to
have lunch. While they were in the bar, DICK WILSON arrived and
told STEELE it was all over and they were out -~- that someone
else would handle the rodeo.

STEELE understands the matter was settled for a
50-50 split with JACK POURIER.

| attend a meeting held approximately a week to ten days before

LLOYD TWISS, Pine Ridge, provided the following
information:

He was a member of a committee formed about three
weeks before the rodeo took place. The committee consisted of
H DICK WILSON as Chairman, BOB MOUSSEAU, LOUIS TWISS, JR., and
i himself. He was present at a meeting held approximately one
week before the rodeo.

It was discussed that JACK STEELE was supposed to
line everything up for the rodeo but he had not done anything
at this point. JACK POURIER and his son were present at the
meeting and discussed the cost of providing rodeo stock.

JACK STEELE and his partner, a man named KRAMER, arrived
at the meeting. STEELE and his partner wanted a percentage of
the receipts, while POURIER had asked for about $1,200. After
some discussion, KRAMER and STEELE left the meeting.

. A day or two later JACK POURIER agreed to supply the
stock and help at the rodeo for a 50-50 split of the profit with

| the tribe. TWISS said it was his understanding WILSON and
MOUSSEAU would take care of council resolution allowing POURIER
to handle the rodeo. TWISS further stated he worked at the rodeo
as the arena director. He stated that there was no control over
sales at the gate as no tickets were sold.

NOTE: Dick Wilson advises he has received complaints concerning
a lack of investigations made against non-Indians who are alleged
to have committed crimes against Indians. He belleves part of
the fault lies with the Agent assigned to investigate these cases
inasmuch as he believes this Agent has been assigned there too
long. The two letters that were enclosed to his letter appears
to relate to the same case wherein 3 calves were stolen by a
non~Indian on the Pine Ridge Reservation and the U. S. Attorney
apparently failed to prosecute the person responsible. Bureau
indices reffect that Wilson may be identical to Orlin Wayne Wilson,
aka, subject of Bufile 89-725, who together with other Sioux
Indians in October, 1954, were arrested for assaulting 3 members
of the U. S. Indian Service, Pine Ridge, South Dakota. Orlin
Wilson and others were subsequently indicted by the Federal
Grand Jury, Omaha, Nebraska; however, the indictment against

him was dismissed in May, 1956. Minneapolis being instructed

to contact Wilson for specifics referred to in his letter and

to advise the Bureau by COB 9/15/72, results of contact.

YOUNG continued that he, JONES and JACK then drove the police
car to his iouse and started to go in for a cup of coffee when he

He saw someone in the car throw a beer can in the street as they
turned the corner so he, JCNES and JACK got back in the police

the station going north. DENNIS, SWIFT BIRD and JONES chased
them in LE COMPTS's car and he drove the police car around town.

WILSON car and saw two or three beer cans being thrown from the
WILSON car. They caught up w'th the WILSON car just prior to
reaching the Nebraska State Line; however, DICK WILSON weaved his
car back and forth preventing the police car from coming abreast
with them. LE COKPTE turned on the siren and the WILSON car then
stopped end all of the occupants of the WILSON car got out, as
Gid the police officers. LEROY JANIS started after DENNIS LE
cOMPTE and DONALD JANIS and ROBERT WHALEN came after him. They
were backing h’m up so he pulled his revolver and held them off.
DICK WILSON's wife came up and said it was going to cause a lot
of trouble, so JONES put his revolver away. When his revolver
was in the holster, either WEALEN or DONALD JANIS hit him in the
jaw almost knocking him to the groud. He again pulled his
revolver and by then DICK WILSON joined DONALD JANIS and WHALEN.
LICK WILSON grabbed the cross strap of his sambrowne belt and
told him to unload his revolver. He said that he would not un-

DICK WILSON away and shot him twice with .38 caliber tesr gas

YOUNG with his fist. YOUNG then was surrounded by LEROY JANIS,
DONALD JANIS and ROBERT WHALEN and he was trying to hold them off
with his revolver and asked LE COMPTE if he should shoot one of
them. He told them that there were no more gas shells in his

- gun and that the rest were lead bullets so they then backed down.

YOUNG continued that things then quieted down and the subjects
got back in their car and he, SWIFT BIRD and JONES got in the
police car, drove about a block down the highway, turned around
and then parked directly across the road from the WiLSON car.

He stated that just about then GEORGE WILSON drove up, walked to
the JIM WILSON car and the next thing that he saw, GEORGE WILSON
was &t the window of the police car. GEORGE WILSON then s truck
at JONES through the window, breaking the window of the Government
automobile. JCNES then said something to the effect of let's get
them, so JONES opened the door and got out. As YOUNG opened the
other front door, DONALD and LEROY JANIS grabbed him and ROBERT
WHALEN got him from the driver's side. LEROY grabbed YOUNG's
revolver from his hand and ROSERT and DONALD JANIS held him and
hit him several times. He stated that he must have passed out

YOUNG stated that he definitely was not drinking any alcoholic
beverage nor were any of the other police officers. Hes tated
he does not know whether the subjects were intoxicated nor does

from the WILSON car when they were chasing it from Pine Ridge to
white Clay, Nebraska.

pulled out when they got there and headed east on Higshwey 18.

They got up even with the car but could not pass it so YOUNG
turned the police cer around and they started back for Pins Ridge.
Yhe other car went about 100 yards, stopped and also turned around,
Phey then drove to DsNNIS Ls COMPT#S's house to get ahother car

to help them and the subjects followed and pulled up behind

Li COMPTE!s house also. He and YO!ING walked back to the subjects!
car and he shined a light in the car and YOUNG said something to
the subjects to the effect that they ought to know better than
that and they replied with a question as to why the cops were
following them. He and YOUNG then walked back to the volice car
and the subjects cursed them and were using loud and obscene
lenguage. YOUNG told him to get DENNIS LB COMPTE and SWIFT BIRD
to help them. He and JACK started after DENNIS and S#¥IFT BIRD and
suodjects were honking the horn and racing their motor.

JONES continued that they got SWIFT BIRD and when they returned
to the car, the subjects were gone. SWIFT BIRD got in the car
with them and drove back to the police station and tried to find
out what was wrong with the police car, which was not operating
correctly. SWIFT BIRD went inside the police station to make a
telephone call and he and YOUNG stayed in the car. The subjects
drove by, stopped in the middle of the road and again cursed he
and YOUNG and as he and YOUNG got out of the car, the subjects
a@rove south on highway 18. SWIFT BIRD then came out of the
police station and DENNIS LE COMPTE drove up. They saw a car
come north through the stop sign with no lights and recognized
it as the subjects! car. When it passed the station, he, LE
COMPTE and SWIFT BIRD got in the police car and tried to catch
them. They followed for about five miles and when they could not
catch them, turned around and started toward Pine Ridge.

JONES then sew a car following so LE COMPTH pulled off the road
and waited until the car passed to be sure it was the subjects.
When it was determined that it was the WILSON car, they started
after them again and when they arrived at the stop sign, YOUNG
was there, so he got in the car with them. They drove for
approximately one-quarter of a mile and saw the subjects parked
with their lights off; however, they started up again when they
saw the police car coming. He continued that they caught up
with the subjects just at the State line and turned the siren on
so the subjects stopped. All the parties got out of both cars
and ROBERT WHALEN and Mrs. DICK WILSON came up to JONES, who had
@ blackjack in his hand. Both said something to the effect that

he was not to do anything and tere would not be any trouble. At
thet time, DENNIS LE COMPTE was talking to LEROY JANIS. There
was talking for a short time end then he heard two shots, turned
and ran in that direction and saw DICK WILSOW fall in a ditch
about 15 yards in front of LE COMPTE's car. He then saw DONALD
JANYS and ROBERT WHALEN remove their shirts and they were trying
to get at Officer YOUNG. JONES and SWIFT BIRD tried to get between
them end WHALEN finally said that they would quit if YOUNG would
out away his gun, which YOUNG did. JONES stated that he is not
positive but believes that one of them then hit YOUNG as YOUNG
pulled his gun again and asked LE COMPTE if he should shoot.
YOUNG finelly put his revolver eway and came to the car along with
SWIFT BIRD and they locked the doors and rolled up the windows.

JONES continued that at this point everything was calm and no
one was fighting so JONES drove LS COMPTS's car down the road,
turned it around and parked it directly across the highway from
the subjects! car. He, SWIFT BIRD and YOUNG were sitting there
woen GORGE WILSON drove up. DENNIS had all of the subjects in
their car, except Mrs. WILSON, when GHORGS WILSON drove up. GEORGE
WILSON then went to the subjects' car and shortly thereafter,

3 WILSON and the other subjects started for LE COMPT#'s car.
= WILSON came to the driver's side of the police car and
swung his fist, breaking the window on the driver's side, his
entire arm going through the window. JONES stated that he then
opened the door, jumped out and started wrestling with GEORGE
WILSON. When WILSON started using his fists, he then hit WILSON
and knocked him down. He also fél1l down and one of the subjects
then jumped on him and started hitting him with his fists.
DENNIS LE COMPTE then pulled this man off of him and started for
LE COMPTE's car, where he covld see fists flying et YOUNG. As he
reached the rear of the car, LEROY JANIS came for him and the
next thing he knew, he was on the ground and LEROY JANIS had his
knee in his stomache and JANIS swung again with a revolver, which
he had in his hand, hitting JONES again in the head. LEROY J. Ss
had the gun pointed out at his head snd he started rolling to get
away from him. Someone then pulled JANIS off of him and JONES
then started north down the highway toward White Clay, Nebraska,
for hlep. He met SWIFT BIRD later at Kelly Coonts house, where
they tried to get help; however, no one would answer their door.

He and SWIF! BIRD started walking to Pine Ridge and he, JONES,
passed out ih e field. When he came to, no one was around so
he walked to Pine Ridge and to LE COMFTE's house. LE COMPTE wes
home and SWIFT BIRD and YOUNG came in a little later end all four

Interviews with Subjects

It is noted that prior to interviewing the subjects, each was
advised of the seriousness of the allegation made against him and
the fect thet any information furnished by him would be used in
court against him. Each was advised that he was under no complusion
to answer questions and that if he did, it was to be on a volun-
tary basis.

Mr. LEROY JOSEPH JANIS was interviewed by the writer on October
20, 1954, at the residence of DENNIS LE COMPTH and in his presence.
JANIS declined to furnish a signed statement; however, advised
that on Saturday, October 16, 1954, he was in Martin, South
Dakota, and was drinking whiskey at the M and M Bar. Late in

the afternoon, he drove his car to Pine Ridge and fixed two flats
at Al's Texaco Service in Pine Ridge. He parked his car at his
sister's house and woke up his brother, DONALD JANIS. He and
DONALD then got in a car with ORLIN W. WILSON, his wife and

MERLE ROBERT WHALEN. They drove out into the country and one of
the boys played a guitar and the rest sang songs. He stated he
cannot recall whether he was drinking anything at that time. He
believes that they went to someone's house to get dressed for a
dance. It was his opinion that they went to the home of JIM
WILSON so ORLIN's wife could change her clothes. He does not
recall stopping and talking to any police officers on their way
through town. On the way back through Pine Ridge, he does recall
stopping at the stop sign and then proceeding south on the highway
toward White Cley, Nebraska, where the dance was to be held,

He believes they stopped the car before reaching the State line
and the four men relieved themselves along the highway. Just

as they crossed the State line into Nebraska, he heard a siren
and someone said, "It's the cops, stop the car", so they stopped.
EROY JANIS stated he does not remember what started the fight
but he does recell participating in it. He stated that he also
remembers getting SIDNEY YOUNG's revolver out of the police car;
however, he does not recall hitting anyone with it. LEROY JANIS

on the east side of the road pointing north and
directly across the road was my fathers car pointing
south. I walked on the road between the two cars and
heard my brother Dick yell that he had been shot. I
think Dick pointed to the police car and said 'that
(curse word unrecalled) shot me.' I walked overto
the police car and saw officer Jones sitting behind
the wheel and I immediately struck at him. I thought
the window was down but knew it wasn't when the win-
dow broke, cutting my arm. Jones came out of the car
and he and I fought. Either Jones hit me or i fell
hitting my head on the pavement, The next thing I

residence, 313 Adams, Rapid City, South Dakota. Before .
being asked any questions she was advised of the official
identities of the interviewing agents and the nature of
the inguiry. RIOS did not wish to offer a signed statement,
but offered the following free and voluntary information:

Late in February, 1973, she and RUSSELL MEANS
spent the night with GARY THOMAS, Legal Aid employee, who.
resides in bana ne paper eter next morning RIOS
and MEANS ea @ ride with GARY THOMAS to Pine Ridge,
South Dakota in his automobile. They left Rushyille

Sa in the afternoon and proceeded directly to Pine Ridge.
Upon arriving at Pine Ridge they stopped at the Sioux
Nation Shopping Center and NRANS went inside for a few
minutes and then returned to the cay. An old Indian lady
followed MEANS out of the shopping center and approached
him after he had gotten into the car. The old lady had some
papers and asked MEANS to help her straighten out some type
-of land problem. :

At this point someone on the driver's side of
the car hollered "RUSSELL, and all the ocevpants of the
car looked that way. RIOS looked back toward the passenger
side of the car and observed three Indian males approach
the cay. One of these three men Knceked the old lady out
ef the way and hit HEANS on the back of the head, and when
MEANS looked around another one hit him in the face hard
enough to eause blood to flow from his mouth. GARY THOHAS
i also hit by the Indian male on the driver's side of

ear.

‘ The incident happened so fast that RIOS was
not able to tell who had hit MEANS or THOMAS. After
MEANS was hit the second time, RLOS stated to THOMAS
"GARY hurry and get out of here.” ‘THOHAS then pulled

out of the parking spot and they left town to go te
Calleo, South Daketa. Although RIOS did not observe
who struck MEANS or THOMAS, she did recognize two of the

i. ’ RUSSELL CHARLES MEANS was located at the Minnehaha

| County Jail where he is presently incarcerated. He was made
aware of the official identity of the interviewing agent and

—.... advised he was being interviewed concerning an alleged violation.

| of his civil rights at the Sioux Nation Shopping Center, Pine

: Ridge, South Dakota. . :

MBANS advised he would cooperate in relating the
account and would thereafter provide a signed satement.
The following statement was provided by MEANS:

"I, RUSSELL CHARLES MEANS,-make the following
free and voluntary statement to Special Agent ROGER
@. FISHER, who has identified himself to me as an
agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

"On February 27, 1973, after 2 P.M. I was in
the company of GARY THOMAS, attorney of Tegal Aid
Services, Pine Ridge, and THELHA CONROY, Rapid City.
We were in THOMAS' car and stopped at the Sioux
Nation Shopping Center, Pine Ridge. Both THOMAS
and I went into the store_ but I returned first.

As I was sitting in the car and an elderly woman,
whose name I don't recall, came up to the ear and
advised she was having trouble with the BIA over
her Jand or something similar to that, She asked
4f I could help her straighten out the problem,

She showed me some documents which I turned over to
THOMAS when he got into the car,

"About that time a fat guy, who had teen drink-
ing apparently, whose name I don't know_ knocked the
: lady to the ground. He was wearing a dirty “2”
shirt. He sid_ "what, are you here to raise hell
at our store?" He then siugged me over the right
ear, About that time WINTERS wilked up and hit me
squarely in the mouth, Both of them challenged me

te get cut of the car. THREE STARS walked up with 7
: jacket, he never hit me or said anything but it :
7 Was very apparent he was directing the assauit.
_J&RRIVAL also walked up with an unidentified person
and headed toward the ear.

—

“About that time GARY THOMAS backed out and
drove away. He teok THELMA CONROY and me to Calico.
We were going to report the incident to the police
but THOMAS suggested we get someone to accompany ~
me to avoid any mistreatment by the BIA.

"f know RICHARD WILSON had a “goon squad.”
He hired approximately 50 people, through funds
received from the area office of Aberdeen, for
security of BIA and Tribal buildings. Approxi-
mately $60,000 was sceured for this purpose. These
people were issued "Billy" clubs, guns, mace, given
18 hours of riot training and turned loose on the
people of Pine Ridge. I am positive that the "goon
squad" members were seen drinking on the job in
BIA and Tribal offices. After the YELLOW THUNDER
atriouty people came to me as a “social worker" with
SOmplaints. For awhile I set up an ex offius office
at the Legal Aid Services office. i not only re-
ceived complaints in Pine Ridge but also from area
of Scenic, HManderson, Wounded Raee, and Poreupine.
The complaints dealt with terrorism, harassment,
particularly from the young and even some old
people were treated disrespectfully. The complaints
. were numerous and I tired all avenues even to talk
ing to WILSON and the Ass't. U. 5S. Attorney in Rapid
City to resolve them_ but all doors were closed.

"{ also received threats personally against
my kife and my braids. The unidentified fat guy
once stated if I was going to stay at Pine Ridge
"We will kill you. We are not going to allow you
to raise heli.” This statement was made the day
of the assault one me. I also received telephone

threats on my life while at Pine Ridge. DICK WILSON
once threatened me with police action just after I
a received a restraining order forbidding me to at—
—~“~fempt any meetings. He said he would lock me up
and make sure I stayed locked up. He said he was
not going to tolerate disobedience of his or tribal
laws and would stop any trouble before it started.

"I have read this statement consisting of this
and three other pages. I have made and initialed
(2) two additions to this statements. This state~
ment as it is now constituted is true.

*/s/ RUSSELL C. MEANS

"Witnessed; SA ROGERT T. FISHER, FBI, Minneapolis,
6/1/73, at Sioux Falis, §.D."

During the reading of the statement when MEANS
xréached the part concerning threats against himself on page
three, he laughed out loud and stated, "I regret I have only
one set of braids to give to my country."

j It is noted that only one witness was present due
| to the unavailability of other Special Agent personnel.

e DERAL “BUREAU OF INVESTIGATI e.

( S/1I/78

JOSEPH FRANCIS MERRIVAL was contacted at his residence,
_993 Douglas Drive, and advised of the identity of the inter~
viewing agents and that investigation was being conducted
regarding an attack on RUSSELL MEANS and GARY THOMAS in the
Sioux Nation Shopping Center on February 27, 1973. He was
advised of his rights by Special Agent CARPER as set forth on
a form captioned "Interrogation; Advice of Rights", which he
read, idan he understood, and signed.

He “advised that on the aay in question, he and his wife,
GERTRUDE, were visiting at EARL DEON's house, and also present
were GLEN THREE STARS, ELMER WINTERS, PETE MERRIVAL, and DEON.
He and his wife advised they were leaving the residence to go
“to ‘the Sioux Nation Shopping Center, at which. time the other
four individuals stated they were going there as they had just
received word that some "outsiders" were at the Center.
: MERRIVAL stated “outsiders" is the term used by Indians
i residing in the Pine Ridge, South Dakota, area for other
Indians and non~Indians who have been coming into the area of
' ‘the reservation and causing problems such as occurred at Custer
Hl the first of the year. ,

He and his wife drove in their automobile to the Sioux
Nation store and went inside for approximately five to ten
minutes, and when they came out they observed DEON, WINTERS ,
THREE STARS, and PETE MERRIVAL talking to two individuals ina
ear in the shopping center. The car backed up from the parking
place, at which time DEON was yelling something to the cccupants
of the car to the effect that "If you want to start trouble,
why don't you start with me." The dar then drove from the
shopping center, and he and his wife left, and he believed the

. other four individuals got. into a car and also left.

He was later charged with assaulting MEANS, as was THREE

STARS, and they appeared in court where the charges were dis-~
missed due to lack of evidence.

After’their court appearance, he heard WINTERS and DEON
laughing about the fact he and THREE STARS had been charged
with hitting MEANS when they had nothing to do with the fact
MEANS was apparently hit onee or twice. He has talked to
WINTERS and WINTERS has in a bragging way informed him that
hé was the one who hit MEANS.

During this period of time in late February, 1973, most
_ of the Indians living in the Pine Ridge area were extremely
upset over the fact outsiders, were continually, coming into
their area and causing trouble. He feels this is why THREE
STARS, WINTERS, DEON, and PETE MERRIVAL had approached these
two individuals, and he feels the whole nature of their contact
was strictly to tell the outsiders to, leave town.

., MERRIVAL stated he did not desire. to furnish a signed
statement regarding the above as he is presently free on bail
in connection with an assault on a police officer in Pine Ridge.
He stated the reason he.left Pine Ridge was because he felt if
he remained he would have to take sides either with the out-
siders or with the local Indians, and he simply did not want
to make this decision. He stated if necessary he would testify
to the above information in Federal court..

: WILLIAM JANKLOW, Attorney, Pierre, South Dakota,
furnished the following information: . .
ae .
: He was an attorney for the Office of Economic
Opportunity (OZO) and lived at Rosebud, South Dakota, from
the spring of 1966 to the fall of 1972. In the fall of 1972,
he moved to Pierre,.South Dakota, and éntered private practice.
He is currently employed as a special prosecutor for the
Attorney General's Office at Pierre, South Dakota. Mr. JANKLOW!
has known GARY THOMAS for some time. THOMAS was employed by
him as an intern during the summer of 1971 and is currently

On February 28, 1973, Mr. JANKLOW was with GARY THOMAS |

statement concerning his activities on February 28, 1973,

“I, WILLIAM JANKLOW, Box 1176, Pierre, South
Dakota, hereby make the following statement to BRYAN J.
MOGEN of the FBI.

“On or about 28 February, 1973, I was in Pine
Ridge, South Dakota, with GARY THOMAS and MICK GROSSENBURG.
We had visited various places involved in the incident
at Wounded Knee, South Dakota, and we had then gone

‘ over to the Pine Ridge Police Station to visit with
the Police Officers who were there on special assignment
from Rosebud. GARY, MICK and I were standing by the

.Station when a station wagon, I believe, drove up. In
the Station Wagon was RICHARD WILSON, Mrs. WILSON and a

of the car and slowly walk over to our place where we were
standing. I greeted WILSON and so did GARY THOMAS.

. As WILSON approached us, he slowly took off his
sunglasses and said to THOMAS, ‘Do you want a piece of

me, you son-of-~a~bitch.’ THOMAS said that he did not

want any trouble with WILSON, WILSON then came forward,

again repeated his phrase and started raising his voice.
There were several newspaper and media people in the
vicinity-and they gathered around. RICHARD MULLER of:
KELO TV, Sioux Palls_ was there as was some man from
the Associated Press outside South Dakota_ as well as one
of, the Denver, COlorado television station news bureaus.
WILSON told THOMAS that he, THOMAS, had until 8:30 A.M.
the following morning to get off the Pine Ridge
Reservation or he would turn his goons loose on THOMAS.
I interrupted WILSON and tried to make small talk,
because all of the media people were starting to let
the cameras roll, etc. WILSON said to THOMAS, ‘You
son-of-a-bitch, you swore at me yesterday, and now

Z am promising you that if you are not off of this
reservation by 8:00 A.M. tomorrow my goons will

kill you. This is not a threat, it is a promise.’

“WILSON further remarked that THOMAS and the
other attorney, the ‘Mexican, chile bean bastard,
Mario Gonzelas,_ had caused enough trouble on the
Pine Ridge.

“About this point in time, Mrs. WILSON came forward
and started to push THOMAS around telling him that he
had threatened her husband, and that she would take care

. of THOMAS if her husband didn't. By this time a large

erowd had gathered and was watching the incident. A
couple of cars stopped, and WILSON said that these were
a couple of his ‘boys'. One of them came forward and
started to push THOMAS around. I interceded and told
him to get back and stay out of it. I then grabbed



MP 44-736 7 os

WILSON by the arm and pulled him to the back of the

y ear to talk to him, and I send THOMAS back across the street
to THOMAS's car. THOMAS went across the street and got
into his car, and I proceeded to stand with WILSON for
approximately 15 minutes and visit with him.

“The above statement is true and correct to the best
o£ my knowledge, and it is given to Mr. MOGEN of theFBI
this 22nd day (of May, 1973.

oa MICK GROSSENBURG, Tripp County States Attorney,
Wimer, South Dakota, (Office phone 842=1676 —- Home phone
842~2881)-telephonically contacted the Pine Ridge, South
~~-Bakota, Command Post of the FBI and advised that he was
calling from his home and-indicated that he was familiar
withthe altercation that took place between GARY THOMAS,
... & former Office of Economic Opportunity (GEO) Legal Officer
on the Pine Ridge. Reservation, and RICHARD WILSON, President
of the Oglala Sioux Tribal Council, on February 28, 1973.

GROSSENBURG furnished the following informations

He stated that he understood that GARY THOMAS
had been with RUSSELL MEANS, an American Indian Movement
(AIM) leader, on February 27, 1973, when THOMAS and MEANS 7
a had engaged in an altercation with WILSON at the Celala ou

Sioux Nation Trading Post parking lot. GROSSENBURG said
that THOMAS told him that MEANS had been hit and that he,
THOMAS, felt that he had been assaulted and had to drive
‘away to avoid a fight. Sometime that day THONAS then went
: to the Tribal Office and filed a complaint against WILSON
for assault. GROSSENBURG said that THOMAS filed the assault
complaint for the ose of further angering WILSON, rather
than because he actually felt he had been assaulted.

GROSSENBURG advised that on February 28, 1973, he
‘and BILL JANKLOW, an attorney from Pierre, South akota? flew
~to Pine Ridge in JANKLOW's plene. They accepted a ride from
GARY THOMAS at the Pine Ridge Airport and were merely
dviving around the Reservation to see what wag going on after
the AIM militants had taken over the Church at Wounded Knee.

: They drove over near the Bureau of Indian Affairs
(BIA) Police Headquarters to use a telephone at the BIA
Building parking lot. DICK WILSON and his wife drove up to
GARY THOMAS' car and WILSON jumped out, came over to GARY
THOMAS, and was berating him in abusive language, concerni:
the filing of the assault complaint the day before. GROSSENBURG
stated that WILSON was using abusive and profane language;
however, he at no time threatened to kill GARY THOMAS,

paaae | “WILSON did tell GARY THOMAS that if THOMAS
continued to hang around with AIM militants like MEANS
z he wanted him off the Reservation and wanted him off
: the Reservation now. GROSSENBURG said the term "goons"
was mentioned several times but he does not recall the -
context, and does not recall that WILSON said that his
ons" would kill anyone. GROSSENBURG believes that
ie subject of goons was brought up either by JANKLOW or
OMAS, or possibly by himself, inasmuch as all were
engaged in a heated argument and that Mrs. WILSON also
joined in the discussion, using profanity and making

wild statements, the exact nature of which GROSSENBURG
cannot recall.

GROSSENBURG further stated that he did not
feel any danger himself from WILSON or feel that THOMAS
. seriously considered himself in any danger, but it was
@ heated argument and yelling contest with high tempers
on both sides, and as a result, he does not remember any
exact statements made by anyone in the argument.

He recalled that JANKLOW quieted WILSON down
and eventually he, THOMAS, and “JANKLOW drove away, without
any further altercation with the WILSONs. .

—_ _yiewed“at the BIA Building by FBI Special Agents JOHN ¢,
KAMMERMAN and ROY W. RHODES, JR., who advised him of their

his possible involvement in or knowledge of the incident
at the Sioux Nation Shopping Center parking lot on February
27, 1973, at 2:30 p.m. at which time RUSSELL MEANS and GARY
THOMAS were allegedly attacked. KAMMERMAN advised THREE
STARS of his rights after which THREE STARS stated he under=
stood his rights and waived such rights as shown on an ex-
ecuted Warning and Waiver form. THREE STARS advised that
on February 27, 1973, he had gone to the grocery store at
the above mentioned parking lot by himself for the purpose
of buying diapers and milk for the family. When he came
out of the store he saw JOSEPH MERRIVAL, ELMER WINTERS and
SONNY DEON standing next to a car in which RUSSELL MEANS
was sitting on the passenger side and GARY THOMAS was sit-
ting behind the wheel. WINTERS was standing on the driver's
side of the vehicle and reached across and over THOMAS and
slapped RUSSELL MEANS in the face. THOMAS was not hit or
slapped and THREE STARS did not hear any conversation be~
tween these people. THOMAS then immediately drove away.

At this time when MEANS was slapped by WINTERS THREE STARS
was sitting in his car next to THOMAS’ car. He does not
know why the other three persons came to the parking lot.
THREE STARS and MERRIVAL were both arrested and charged
with assault on RUSSELL MEANS. THREE STARS stated that he
himself was probably.mentioned in the. complaint because he
and MERRIVAL were the only ones recognized by MEANS.

: THREE STARS affirms that he was not sent by DICK
WILSON to the parking lot.

: THREE STARS stated that he did not desire to
furnish a signed statement,

4 dnterviewed at his office. Mr. THOMAS advised it is his
i“desize to clarify a situation which he witnessed involving
_ | > RUSSELL MmaNS, and which was later alleged to be a violation
.- _? @£ MEANS’ civil richts. Mt. THOMAS said the incident, in his
opinion, was definitely not a civil righta violation. He
Stated he was angry at MEANS for contributing ta the. dis<
orders at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, which largely. -
ied to the removal of Legal. Aid Sexwices from Pine Ridge.
Accordingly, he advised that he would provide a signed
statement describing in detail the events which Led up to
the alleged violation of MEANS‘ civil rights. Mr. THOMAS
provided the following signed statemant to the interviewing

to Mr. ROGER f. FISHER, who hag identified himself

to me as a Special Agent of the sininaiaiecnde Bureau of

DAVE LONG, Vice President of the tribe, approached

and asked Lf hea could take a girl accompanying him
<9 my house. I told him I had an extra bedroom and
he could use it. I had met MEANS at Pine Ridge through
the Legal Aid Services office during the period July
-te August, 1972. The girl with MEANS was named CONROY.
I do not. remember her first name but she wae 26 or 27

my home. My home is in Rushville. I was going to
iny Office in Pine Ridge and consented to give them
axdide. At approximately 2:30 p.em.e we stopped at
the Sioux Nation store in Pine Ridge. RUSSELI, MEANS
entered the store to buy a paper. He returned
approximately five minutes later. A woman named
ROSE BULL BEAR from Kyle came up to the car and
conversed with MEANS. During the conversation an
Indian male came up to the car wearing a cowboy hat.
He approached the driver's side and looked ing f
asked if I could help him. The man shook his head
and went back into the store. ROSE continued talking
to MEANS, Within a couple of minutes approximately
five males came out of the.store. The man in the
cowboy hat came with them. One or two men came up
to the driver's side, the others to MEANS* side. I
locked the door, rolled up the window, and started
the engine in order to back away. Simultaneously,
the men on MEANS‘ side shoved ROSE away and directed
a couple of blows at MEANS. Same ef the men asked,
“MBANS, axe you causing trouble in the Sioux Nation Store?"
MEANS sustained a lip injury which was bleeding. I
did net observe any other injuries.

“I do not know if MEANS had trouble in the store.
He said he had a conversation with an elderly person
but seemed surprised when the men attacked.

"Afterward, we proceeded to Calico Village. I
let MEANS and the CONROY girl out of my vehicle at
approximately 3 p.m. MEANS did not indicate his
destination. He had not mentioned Wounded Knee at
all prior to this time. I was not aware of any planned
trouble there and did not learn of the take over until
7230 or & pem. that sane day.

"After Letting MEANS and CONROY out of the
! ear I went to Pine Ridge to the BIA building to
. seek a U. S. Marshal or an FBI agent to repert the
\ incident. My purpose was to advise them because I
thought MEANS tight get angry and return with a mob.
MEANS did not indicate he was angry but rather said
he would sign a complaint. He told me of the
identities of two men involved in the attack, I
.. did not know any of them. The two he named were
JOB MERRIVAL and GLENN THREE STARS, MEANS said they
were friends of DICK WILSOM's. At the BIA building
| I spoke to an unknown person on the U. S. Marshal's
| staff. He suggested I sign a complaint against the
men. I discussed the matter with "SKI“ JACOBS,
Captain of police and afterward did sign a complaint
against MBRRIVAL and THREE STARS. I do not know if
MEANS ever did.

"For several months I had heard rumors at Pine
Ridge concerning a “goon squad” supposedly hired by
DICK WILSON. The rumors also.stated that these
people were paid with approximately $65,000 obtained
through the area office.

“In February, 1973, during the attempted impeach-
ment of WILSON there were several U. S&S. Marshal's at
Le Pine Ridge. I spoke to REIS R, KASH of the Marshal's
service who stated in effect that he was surprised and
displeased to learn that there was a "goon squad" on
the reservation. He ordered that no, more federal
monies be paid to these men and dismantled the group
because their existence contributed to the anxiety of
the situation. This ig the first word from an official

MP 44-696 : ; ute
MP 44-698 SO 7 . §
4 aie ' .,

~~ Btirce X received concerning the existence of a

“goon-squad." I had heard rumors but do not know

‘OE specific instances where people were intimidated,
Everything was hearsay. I never checked out the
stories personally. For example, rumor had it that
ELLEN MOOSE CAMP, Trailer Court, Pine Ridge, had her
trailer entered and ransacked by the "goon squad.”
LILLIAN RICHARDS, Secretary, Tribal Office, allegedly

' was beaten by "goon squad" and required hospitilization.
A house belonging to YELLOW BOY was supposedly burned
in North Ridge by the "goon squad" because he housed
out o£ state people in his home. FRANK FOOLS CROW's
house was allegedly entered and he and his family
threatened by the “goon squad.” I heard also that
some of the men were funded by Manpower.

"I have no other information except on February
28, 1973, I picked up an attorney, BILL JANKLOW from
Pierre at the airport, We were accompanied by another
attorney, MICK GROSENBERG, States Attorney, Winner.
: BILL was looking for his client's mother, Mrs. BLACK
FEATHER, I drove them around toym, While standing
in front of the Pine Ridge courthouse, DICK WILSON
approached me. He said “If you‘re here past 8:30
in the morning I'll have you killed." The other
attorneys heard the threate I spoke to WILSON many
times while working at Legal Aid Services. Our office
had some conflict with WILSON, We tried to tell him
‘we were not involved in partisan politics. However,
once he said we were either for him or against him.
Since so many AIM members came to our office he
apparently felt we were on their side. I felt he
might also have learned of MEANS* visit to my home
and this might have brought on the threat.

RICHARD WILSON;
GARY R, THOMAS - VICTIM

Copies of this communication are being furnished
to Departmental Attorney, Civil Rights Division, United States
Department of Justice at Pine Ridge, South Dakota, and to the
United States Attorney, District of South Dakota, Sioux Falls,
South Dakota. 7

Gary R. Thomas was interviewed by Special Agents of
the Federal Bureau of Investigation on April 12, 1973, at
Fort Thompson, South Dakota, concerning another matter and
furnished the following information:

Thomas stated that on February 28, 1973, he picked

up an attorney, BillxdJanklow, from Pierre, South Dakota, at

the Pine Ridge, SouthMakota, Airport, They were accompanied

by an attorney, MicktGrosenberg, a States Attorney from Winner,
outh Dakota, and drove around the village of Pine Ridge ~~~
looking for a client. While standing in front of the courthouse,
Pine Ridge, Dick Wilson approached Thomas and said "If you are
here past 8:30 in the morning, I'll have you killed".

Richard "Dick"Wilson is the duly elected
President of the Oglala Sioux Tribal Council,
Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, and in this
position he has taken a strong stand against
the American Indian Movement (AIM) and its
objectives. Impeachment action has been taken
against Wilson on numerous occasions by members
of the Tribal Council sympathetic to AIM, and
his removal has been a primary objective of
AIM at Wounded Knee, South Dakota, He and his
supporters, commonly referred to as his "goon
squad," have been the subjects of numerous
civil rights complaints that have been made
during the negotiations at Wounded Knee.

SELECTION OF COMMUNTLY WHATCHA REPRESENTATIVE PROGRAM

Personnel for the CHR Program will be selected through the Tribal personnel
selection system. i

1. Every consideration shall be given to selecting individuals for the
program who are the best, qualified and can provide the highest quality
of service. The attainment of high level of education may be important
to performance in certain positions. However, formal educational quali-.
fications, unless required by State or local law, shall not be amde a
requirement for employment or advancement in either progessional or non~
professional capacities if a cnndidate has the ability to perform the
duties of the position.

2. Personnel to be employed will be judged on how well they meet the re-
quirements for the position; their ability to perform their duties
with competence and integrity; must be capable and responsible, of
good character and reputation, and are sympathetic with the objectives
of the Community Health Representative Program.

3. Personnel to be employed may not be members or supervise organizations
whose objectives include the overthrow of the government of the United
States by force or violwnce.

4. In the case of professional, fiscal, and managerial personnel, recent
conviction of a serious crime shall be considered strong evidence of

ALVIN ZEPHIER, Employment Supervisor, Oglala Sioux Tribal Conncil,
Pine Ridge, South Dakota, advised that he had been a member of the’ Oglala
Sioux Tribe Personnel Policies Board, which is better known as the Evaluation
Committee, since June, 1972, His term of office lasted until April, 1973,
ZEPHIER advised that be was requesved. to volymteer his services with no
remmeration as a member of , ard this request care
from the Executive Board of the Oglaia Sioux Tribe, The sole purpos
Executive Committee is to insure that when job vacanuies occury ai] applicants
for the vacancies are fairly and equitably considered, and that no favoritism
or discrimination is shown in filling available jobs, ZEPHIER stated that the
committee was originally formed as a reaction to wide-spread complaints by
members of the tribe to the effect that discrimination, favoritism, and
hhepotism were being practiced with regard to hiring of new personnel.
The committee has no authority to make recommendations or take any type of
action in promotions, demotions, or terminations, The committee has no real
appellate authority with regard to employee grievances or terminations,

ZEPHIER resigned from the committee after serving only ten months,
mainly because of threatening phone calls he had received from the irate father
of an applicant who did not get a job, When the committee was originally
formed, it set up certain grading standards whereby each prospective applicant
could be numerically rated on the basis of the screening of his application
by members of the Executive Cormittee, The rating standanls established by the
conmittee are the only formal guidelines or regulations governing the activities
of the committee, ZEPHIER advised that although the original request for his
services had been made by the Executive Board of the tribe, he believes the
establishment of the committee was approved by resolution. of the Tribal
Council,

In April, 1973, GERALDINE JANIS, a former employee of the Community
Health Representative Services of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, was fired by action
of the Executive Board, The reason for this termination was JANIS* vocal
advocation of the overthrow of the tribal government, This situation was
eompourded by JANIS' activities, which included merching in demonstrations
and. meeting with dissidents during working hours, having submitted no annual
leave slips in coanection with these activities, JANIS requested that the
Evaluation Committee hear an appeal regarding her termination and althoush the
committee made it clear that it did not have appellate authority in this matter,
it finally agreed to hear the case presented by JANIS and her attorney, whose
name is unrecalled, At the time, JANIS appeared to be mainly concerned with
being paid for the annual leave that she had accrued up to the time of her

the arount of time that JANIS had spent in non-employment related activities
during working hours, so that her annual leave balance cold be appropriately
adjusted prior to computing termination vay, -

The decision of the Evaivation Comittee was to disavslity itself
from rendering a decision, and also to stand by the action of the Executive
Board in this matter,

ZEPHIER was versonally present only for the first half of this
hearing, having vressing business in Rushville, Nebraska, and he set’ out to
attend to this business at the lunch-time adjournment of the hearing, He
consequently was not vresent for the final decision, but is in favor of
the action, and would have voted with the committee in their decision,

ZEPHIER feels that the termination of JANIS was necessary, and
that at no time did he ever susvect any unfair or purely discriminatory
attitudes or practices on the part of the Execwbive Boamt or the Evaluation
Committee in their decisions involving JANIS,

Reeause of pressing msiness, and the inconvenience of the circum
stances in atterding this interview, ZEPHTSR was unable to provide a signed
statement, but stated that he would be very willing to testify at a hearing
if necessary,

JOSEPH POURRIER, SR., Pine Ridge, South Dakota, advised that
he is one of five members of the Oglala Sioux Tribe Personnel Policies
Board, which is more commonly known as the Evaluation Committee,
POURRIER has been with the Evaluation Committee since February, 1972,
and he was selected for service on this committee by the Executive Board
of the cee Sioux Tribe,

* POUPRIER and the other four members were all asked if. they
would volunteer for service with this committee, In each instance, the
i approach was made by a member of the Executive Board, and POURRIER
, _ believes that the Evaluation Committee was approved by the tae

Council by means of a resolution,

The Evaluation Committee was established because of a series.
of complaints by members of the tribe to the effect that discrimination,
favoritism, and nepotism were being practiced to a great extent in the
hiring of persons for Tribal jobs, The committee has developed a systen-
for screening applications for available jobs and scoring all applicants
‘for a job in an equitable manner so that the person most qualified to fit
the position opened is selected, The committee sets out a list of qualified
applicants for each job opening, listing the applicants by their rank and
the application evaluation, A number one person is therefore selected for
the job, but is subject to a 90 day probationary period during which time
the applicant can be fired as unsatisfactory in which case the number two
applicant on the list for that position would be hired, The committee
makes no recommendations and takes no actions direct or indirect regarding
promotions, demotions or terminations, Their activities are confined
strictly to insuring that fair and equitable hiring proceedures are followed
within the Oglala Sioux Tribe.

‘POURRIER advised that he recalled the termination of GERALDINE .
JANIS from her job as Commmity Health Services Representative and his
recollection was that she had been fired by the Bxecutive Boaxd of the
Oglala Sioux Tribe because of her open defiance of the Executive Board, her
stated desires to overthrow the current Tribal Council and the faot that
she participated in many demonstrations, meetings, and conferences with
militant American Indian Movement (AIM) personnel during working hours, and
did not submit Annual Leave slips for these periods of time, POURRIER
recalled that in April, 1973, JANIS appeared at the Evaluation Committee
hearing with a Public Defender, name unrecalled, for | the purpose of repealing ‘
2 her case, The committee had advised

responsible for her termination and inasmuch as te Executive Board was a
higher authority than the Evaluation Committee, the actions of the Board
could not be appealed to this lower authority, However, JANIS was
insistent so her appeal was heard by JOSEPH POURRTFR, REVERAND GUY RONDELL,
and ALVIN ZEPHIER, noting that these three members of ths committee
constituted a quorum, Also present was CALVIN SHANGREAU, the Personnel
Director of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, At the conclusion of the hearing, the
committee voted unanimously to advise JANIS that the committee would dis-
qualify itself from making any recommendations on this case for reasons
previously stated.

7 POURRIER recalls that the main thrust of the JANIS appeal was
payment for accrued Annual Leave, However, at the time, EMMA WILSON, a
member of the Executive Board, was in the process of determining how

much on the job time was spent by JANIS in non-employment related activities
: 80 that this time could be deducted on her balance of accrued Annual Leave
for the purpose of determining how much termination pay JANIS was entitled
to receive.

"On July 24, 1973, I received permission
from Tony Fresquez to take the morning off to go
get a different car.

"My sister Lillian took me to the bank on
-July 24, 1973 and after waiting for me at the bank
she took me to Rushville, Nebraska to see if I
could purchase a car there. After finding out I
would be able to get the car, she returned to work.
I got the car and returned to work at the College
Center, I called my sister Lillian at her office
and she told me what Dick Wilson was saying about
him pulling a good one on me. Meaning that he had
gotten rid of me. Dick Wilson also said that he
was getting ready for re-election and was getting
rid of all the people who weren't for him. After
I finished talking to her on the phone I waited
for Tony Fresquez to come back into the office.
When he came back into the office I asked him what
was going on. He said "Dick is the one that is
raising hell!! I went back to work then and worked
for the rest of the day.

"On: July 25, 1973, I called Tony Fresquez and
told him that I was not going to work because the
Board of Directors did not approve of me working
there at the College Center so I was just going to
quit. Tony Fresquez told me that the Board of
Directors were having a meeting on August 9, 1973
to confirm the job as a bookkeeper for the College
Center. I did not go to this meeting on August 9,
1973 because I felt it wouldn't do any good to try

_ to get the job when Dick Wilson was on the board and
we were told several times that Dick Wilson was
going to get rid of us, (Lillian and I).

"I believe I was enticed to resign my job at
the office of Economic Opportunity so the job of
Fiscal Manager at the office of Economic Opportunity
could be given to one of Wilsons’ supporters. The
position I held at the Office of Economic Opportunity
was given to Helen Polmier. As far as I know no one
has replaced me at the College Center as the bookkeeper.

MP 44-727

"Sometime in early March, 1973 my name was on the
petition to get rid of the Tribal Council. I feel
that because I signed the petition is the reason that
Dick Wilson did not want me to work for any Tribal
Programs.

ployed as a bookkeeper for OEO since October, 1972.

CUNY stated she did not hear any statement made

enemies and hire his friends.

CUNY advised she had been asked to terminate
her present employment on the two following occasions:

job and apply for an accounting position with the Indian

South Dakota. She advised at one time she was interested
in this position since she would not have to commute to

ANTHONY JOSEPH FRESQUEZ was contacted at his
place of employment and after being advised of the
official identities of interviewing Agents, furnished
| the following information:

1

\ FRESQUEZ advised that he preferred not to
furnish any signed statement at this time but would
discuss the matter in detail with the interviewing
Agents.

FRESQUEZ advised he is Executive Coordinator
of the Lakota Higher Education Center, better known as
the College Center located at the Pine Ridge Indian
Hee Reservation, Pine Ridge, South Dakota. FRESQUEZ advised
he has been so employed since July, 1971, and his local
address was Post Office Box 332, Pine Ridge, South Dakota.

FRESQUEZ advised with regard to the hiring and
firing of CARMEL MEANS as bookkeeper for the College
Center, he believed that MEANS was initially contacted
regarding the position of bookkeeper by FRANCIS KILLER,
who was a private accountant who the College Center con-
tracted to conduct an audit of their fiscal records during
the Summer of 1973. FRESQUEZ advised that KILLER stated
that CARMEL MEANS was a bookkeeper and that the College
Center needed a permanent bookkeeper.

: FRESQUEZ advised his initial contact with CARMEL
MEANS was when she telephonically contacted him regarding
the position of bookkeeper and he told her if she would
apply then she would have just as good a chance as anyone
who applied for a position. FRESQUEZ stated MEANS subse-
quently submitted an application and approximately one

week later he telephoned her and advised her to come to
work. FRESQUEZ advised MEANS reported to work the following
Monday, July 23, 1973, and was employed until the morning
of July 26, 1973, when she telephoned him and advised that
she was resigning her position because she understood there
was some opposition to her working at the College Center.

FRESQUEZ advised the normal procedure for
hiring and firing cf College Center employees is for
a Board of Directors consisting of eight members to
review each application and recommend who should be
hired. FRESQUEZ continued by advising when a vacancy
needs to be filled, it is announced and the staff at
the College Center does the initial screening of all
the applicants and then this recommendation is relayed
to the Board of Directors. He advised approximately
80 per cent of the staff's recommendations are approved
by the Board of Directors.

With regard to CARMEL MEANS! employment,
FRESQUEZ advised Mr. JAMES HAMM, Acting Director for the
College Center, had authorized him to offer MEANS employ-
ment. FRESQUEZ advised MEANS was the best qualified
applicant for the position and due to the urgency of the
job, she was hired before the Board of Directors officially
met and voiced their approval. FRESQUEZ advised MEANS'
application would have been officially presented before
the Board of Directors at their next official meeting,
but that MEANS resigned prior to this happening. FRESQUEZ
advised although MEANS' application was not officially
presented before the Board of Directors for approval prior
to her obtaining employment, this was not unusual as
poe other employees had been so hired by the College
enter.

FRESQUEZ advised he did not specifically state
for MEANS to terminate her employment with the Office of
Economic Opportunity (OEO) and apply for the bookkeeping
job at the College Center, but he probably implied that
in order for her to obtain the bookkeeping position she
would have to terminate her employment with OEO.

FRESQUEZ advised the position of bookkeeper at
the College Center is a merit job inasmuch as the Oglala
Sioux Tribe has a merit system.

FRESQUEZ stated no one instructed them (himself
and HAMM) to offer MEANS employment at the College Center.

He advised the Center needed a bookkeeper and this position
was merely being filled. FRESQUEZ concluded by advising
that at present the Center still does not have a bookkeeper.

‘advised me that, he ordered his men to bump

meant by ‘bumping them off' - he said ' to kill
them'. I advised him that if he was man enough
@ick Wilson - he should go to Wounded Knee to
negotiate with the members of the Civil Rights
Organization (Indian people). Wilson stated:

- I didn't know thats what you thought of me'.

Dave Steele arrived which seemed to conclude

the argument. I then shouted at Wilson that a

known as Education Center, since July, 1973, and that
his mailing address was General Delivery, Porcupine,

HAMM stated that the Education Center had been
without a bookkeeper since June, 1973 and since July 1,
1973, was the beginning of a new fiscal year, the Center

to audit the Center's fiscal records, was probably the
first individual to recommend CARMEL MEANS for the position
of bookkeeper.

HAMM stated his first contact with MEANS was
one day when he was at the Office of Economic Opportunity

in the position of bookkeeper for the Center. He told her
if she was, she should apply for the job. During this
meeting MEANS gave HAMM the impression that she was un-

sometime in the near future.

time that the position would be temporary until such
time that the Board cf Directors could officially meet
and approve her position. HAMM advised that MEANS
applied and came to work on a following Monday with the
understanding that her position was temporary until the
Board's approval.

HAMM advised that on about the third or fourth
day MEANS called TONY FRESQUEZ and told him she under-
stood that there were going to be problems concerning
her employment and, therefore, she did not want the
position. HAMM advised there was no written resignation
submitted since MEANS! position when hired was temporary.
He advised at the next Board of Directors meeting MEANS!
application was not submitted since she had resigned and
of the four or five other applicants the Board decided
none were qualified and to date the Center still does not
have a permanent bookkeeper.

HAMM advised he did not advise MEANS that she.
was fired and that he tried to make it perfectly clear
at the time of her employment that the job was temporary
until such time that the Board could approve it.

HAMM advised that this hiring procedure was
normal in that the staff at the Center and the Board of
Directors had somewhat of a verbal understanding that the
Center could temporarily hire someone when the need dictated
it and the Board would act on that hiring at a later date.

HAMM advised the proper procedure for hiring
employees is that an announcement of a vacancy is made,
applicants make an application and then the Board of
Directors considers that application. HAMM stated the
staff at the College Center ordinarily makes some recom-
mendations but that the Board of Directors has the final
say in these matters.

HAMM advised to the best of his knowledge the
position of bookkeeper at the College Center is not con-
sidered a merit system position such as those used by the
Tribal Council.

and has had his present position with the United Stares Public
Health Service since January, 1973.

- He has never met GERALDINE JANIS, however, he knows
her through telephonic contact.

He is not employed by

He recalls having telephonic: conversation with
JANIS in which he discussed with her the matter of demonstrating.
He is certain that this call had as its purpose not the matter
of demonstrating, but some other reason, and he believes it was
concerning a contract amendment to enable the hiring of another
Community Health Representative. The matter of demonstrating
was discussed as JANIS made inquiry about it. He advised her
that her activity while working within the contract under which
she was employed was of concern to the Government in that dur-
ing that time she should be working within the terms of the
contract at that time.

It-is his understanding that JANIS and others had
been demonstrating in opposition to the general conditions on
the Reservation and not for the American Indian Movement or
against any particular Tribal Government.

The hiring, promotion, demotion and termination of
Community Health Representatives is a matter which is the
perogative of the Tribal Government. The Community Health
rogram is a contract program and is put into operation
following a representation made by a Tribal Government show-
ing need or justification. When this justification is sub-
mitted it is accomplished by a proposed budget. The
Community Health Representatives grade level is in this pro-

posal.

Unit Director of the Indian Health Service who is located
‘at the Reservation. The tribe is then given options or
suggestions as to what may be done to improve a certain
situation or shortcoming. The action taken is the respon-

Reverend GUY F, RONDELL, Pine Ridge, South
H Dakota, advised that he is an ordained minister with
{ the United Presbyterian Churches of the United States

;aaus of America. He does not belong to the Oglala Sioux
{ Tribe but is a member of the Sisseton Wapeton Sioux i
i Tribe in South Dakota, He has been a niember of the
if: Evaluation Committee of the Oglala Sioux Tribe in Pine
7 . Ridge, South Vakota, since January 1973, He was
i - originally asked by RICHARD WILSON, President of. the

. Oglala Sioux Tribe, to volunteerhis services for

the Evaluation Committee in November 1972, but he did
not ‘accept this request at that time, However, he
eventually began to feel that it was his duty to help
the people of the tribe, so he accepted a voluntary
appointment in January 1973. He advised that the sole
purpose of the Evaluation Committee is to insure that
: job vacancies under the Office of Economic Opportunity
Ajo. auees (GEO) are filled equitably with a complete lack of
1 : discrimination, favoratism and nepotism.

Before the formation of the Evaluation Committee,
many unfair practices were followed in the hiring of
4 persons for available jobs. Under the current procedures,
. when a vacany is advertised, all of the persons interested
submit applications, These applications are reviewed by
members of the Evaluation Committee and are scored on the.
basis of a numerical system devised by the Committee in
order to assure that everyone gets an equal chance to be
: censidered best qualified for the job. The result is that
: : the person having the highest score is given first chance
Bao at the available job. It sometimes occurs that the person
selected by this method does not work out satisfactorily
and is subsequently terminated by his employer, This action
docs not come from the Committee, When this occurs, the
person who scored next highest is offered the job, RONDELL
feels that since the Committee was established, there has
been a complete absence of discriminatory practices in
hiring, promoting and terminating of persons in the OZO

programs,

RONDELL recalled the appeal of GERALDINE JANIS
subsequent to her termination from employment as a Com-
munity Health Representative. At the appeal hearing in
April 1973, RONPELL askec GERALDINE, "Exactly hat is

it that you want", She replied tnat all sae wan

that you wan Baa WON

i the back pay coming to her for acexrued annual leave.

I : RONDELL assured her that if she was entitled to that pay,
i she would get it, She made it clear at that time that

| that was all she wanted. RONDELL does not recall that

} her termination of employment as such was ever at issue.
She was further advised that if she wanted to be rehired
she would have to go to the Executive Board of the Oglala
Sioux Tribe because that is the authority which effected
her termination and inasmuch as it was a higher authority
than the Evaluation Committee,

Normally, persons who are hired by the Evaluation

Committee receive recomendations from the employer that
the services of the employee should be terminated for
appropriate reasons. The Committee always goes along

with the employer, who then terminates the employee and

in these cases, the employee does have a right to appeal
to the Evaluation Committee. However, this was not the
case in the matter concerning GERALDINE JANIS.

At no time prior to, during, or subsequent

* to the appeal hearing, did JANIS make any statements
.indicating that she felt she had been unjustly discrin-
'. inated against in the loss of her job. The reasons for
her termination were that she had consorted with militant
American Indian Movement (AIM) troublemakers, had parti- |
cipated in demonstrations and had openly advocated the
overthrow of the Tribal Government. These actions were
compounded by the fact that she engaged in these activities
during working hours, but had not submitted annual leave
requests for time off to engage in these activities.

7 RONDELL stated "If she had just kept her nose
out of these activities and kept her mind on her work
like everybody else, she wouldn't have had any problems",

KAREN TRUEBLOOD, Secretary, Office of Economic
Opportunity (OEO), Pine Ridge, South Dakota, advised
that at the time OSCAR HOLLOW HORN was employed by the
OEO, the Director of Programs for OEO was LELAND BEAR
HEELS. HOLLOW HORN served as liaison officer betyeen
the people living lorsen and Wounded Nuse, South
Dakota, the GEO Maupower Drogrems. He super-
vised a staff of three persons who were trainces or
aides, TRUEBLOOD dees not know how long HOLLOW HORN was
employed in this capacity because HOLLOW HORN was here
whenshe came on the job in November 1972. She advised
that LELAND BEAR HEELS is no longer the Director of .
Programs, but that she had an excellent recollection of

the circumstances surrounding admonishing of HOLLOW HORN

as well as his final termination. Furthermore, she was
able to review records which are described as time sheets
inasmuch as she is the official custodian of these records.

She recalled that on February 15 and 16, 1973,
HOLLOW HORN was docked 12 hours pay for absence from an
in-service training progran., This is about the time he
was given an oral admonition by BEAR HEELS for hig failure
to show up. Later, because of continued absence from
meetings and training sessions, HOLLOW HORN was suspended
for two weeks and was charged leave without pay for the
period of March 12-23, 1973. TRUEBLOOD asked BEAR HEELS

.at the time to put this suspension at writing, but he
+ never got around to doing it.

Finally, by letter dated May 4, 1973, HOLLOW
HORN was advised by BERL AKERS, JR., Acting Director,
that he was being terminated effective May 7, 1973,
inasmuch as the last day that he had peen on "the job was
March 9, 1973,

' TRUEBLOOD stated that when HOLLOW HORN's wife
picked up his last check, which reported pay for accrued
annual leave, she told HOLLOW HORN's wife to tell him to
come in, and that if he would speak to the Director, he
would probably be given another chance, However, he never

Division dated May 31, 1973) indicate that Barbara Means
was terminated as Clerk of Courts because "she partici-
pated in a public demonstration advocating: the overthrow
of the elected government of the Oglala Sioux Tribe."

On August 13, 1973, Means telephonically
(605/867-5356) advised Departmental attorney R. Dennis
Ickes that she broke her left arm in four places on
January 16, 1973 and on Dr. Guenther's advice (Rushville,
Nebraska) took sick leave from February 7, 1973 to
June 1, 1973. On March 8, 1973, Means participated
in a public demonstration on the lawn of the Bureau
of Indian Affairs Building in Pine Ridge. On March 6,
1973, Means assisted in drafting a petition against the
tribal government and helped obtain signatures as well
as signing it herself. On March 29, 1973, Sidney Witt,
tribal prosecutor, told Means that she had been suspended

NW 68262 Docld:32989685 Page 454



e @
-7-

from her job and gave her a memorandum to that effect.
According to Means, suspension is temporary until a
hearing is held at which time a decision is made con-
cerning her employment. However, Means stated that
she received no hearing and learned through friends
on approximately April 21, 1973 that she had been

_fired by the Oglala Sioux Tribe Executive Committee
on April 4, 1973. No written notice of her firing
was received by Means.

8. Interview Means and obtain a signed statement
from her describing the events referred to in the above
telephone conversation. Also, obtain copies of the
following documents:

(a) Dr. Guenther's written statement
concerning his recommendation for
Means.

(b) Sidney Witt's memorandum to Means
saying she was suspended,

(c) All other documents which reflect
upon Means' employment and termi-
nation as Clerk of Courts.

Also in the Departmental attorney's telephone
conversation with Janis on August 9, 1973 referred to
above, Janis alleged that other tribal employees had
been fired because of their participation in public
demonstrations or in signing circulated petitions.

Janis noted that Carmel-Means was enticed into resigning
a merit-protected job as fiscal manager for the local
Office of Economic Opportunity with the promise that

she would be given a job at the Pine Ridge College Center
with a higher salary; but that she was fired two days
later by Dick Wilson who was on the College's Board of
Directors which had to approve all hirings.

NW 68262 Docld:32989685 Page 455

Departmental attorney Ickes was telephonically
contacted by Carmel Means on August 13, 1973 (605/867-
5787). She stated that she had been fiscal manager
for Office of Economic Opportunity for a year at a
salary of $9,780 per year and had been an employee of
Office of Economic Opportunity since 1968. Jim Hand

—and Tony Frescas (phonetic), both in administration
at the College Center, promised Means that if she
resigned from the Office of Economic Opportunity she
could get a job as bookkeeper at the College Center
for $10,000 per year. They promised that the Board
of Directors of the Center had indicated that they
wanted only Means to work there.

According to Means, she resigned from the
Office of Economic Opportunity on July 20, 1973
and started work at the Center on July 23, 1973
and worked until July 24, 1973 when Frescas told
her that Dick Wilson was "raising hell" about the
Center hiring her; therefore, Means was fired. She
was told by Frescas that she could appear before the
Center's Board of Directors meeting on August 9, 1973
and apply for the job. Means said she did not attend
the August 9, 1973 meeting because she knew she would
not get the job based on her July 24, 1973 experience
with Frescas and Wilson's opposition. Means believes
that she was enticed into resigning her job at the
Office of Economic Opportunity so that the Office of
Economic Opportunity position could be used to reward
a supporter of Wilson. Means stated that Helen Palmier
replaced her at the Office of Economic Opportunity, but
does not know who replaced her at the Center.

Means stated that she signed a petition to
replace the tribal constitution and has associated
with Janis. According to Janis, Wilson has made the
statement in the presence of Lillian Cooney (sister.
to Carmel Means) and Karen Trueblood (an Office of
Economic Opportunity employee) that he was starting

NW 68262 Docld:32989685 Page 456



-9-

his campaign for re-election as tribal chairman
already and that he would fire all of those who
worked against him and would hire his friends.

Means believes that Cooney will share her infor-
mation with investigating agents, but that Trueblood
may be afraid to cooperate. Means noted that similar
tactics have been attempted on Cooney who also works
at the Office of Economic Opportunity.

Janis further @lleged-in her telephone con-
versation that Oscar HollowHorn, a former Office
of Economic Opportunity coordinator at Manderson,
South Dakota, and a current resident of Wounded
Knee was fired because he “was not interested in
his job." Hollow Horn had signed the above described
petition.

9%, Obtain the details of the Carmel Means
incident by:

(a) Obtaining a signed statement from
Means describing the incident con-
cerning her resignation from the
Office of Economic Opportunity and
subsequent firing by the College
Center,

(b) Interviewing Jim Hand and Tony
Frescas concerning:

(1) All contacts and the substance

- of those contacts with Means
wherein either of them made
offers of employment at the
College Center. If they did
make offers of employment,
determine what the terms of

offer, what instructions they
had from the Center's Board of
Directors or other supervisory

GERALDINE JANIS, Pine Ridge, South Dakota, was inter-
viewed by Special Agents of the FBI. Prior to the interview,
JANIS was advised of the identity of the Agents as being
Special Agents of the FBI and that the interview concerned
her recent termination from her position with the Commmity
Health Program. She then furnished the following signed
statements

"april 21, 1973
"Pine Ridge, South Dakota

“I, GERALDINE JANIS, make the following
voluntary and true statement to Special Agents
JOSEPH C. HC DONALD and MARVIN J. BRACKEN who
have identified themselves to me as Special
Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigations

"I was employed as the Director of the
Community Health Representative Program on the
Oglala Sioux Indian Reservation, Pine Ridge,
South Dakota. This program is funded by the
Uealth, Uducation and Welfare Department of the
United States government and it is administered
by the Oglala-Sioux Tribe (OST). The head-
quarters of the Commmity Health Representatives
Program (CHRP) is located in a building at the
Pine Ridge Airport. ”

“on April 9, 1973, DUANE J, BREWER, OST
Police Department, gave me a termination
notice that I had been terminated from my
employnent from the CHRP, effective as of
April 5, 1973, because I demonstrated to over-
throw the Tribal Government. He also gave me
termination notices for VICTORIA WOUNDED Foot,
ELLEN MOVES CAMP, DELLA STAR, MINERVA WALKS OUT
and EMMA BORDEAUX, who were also employed by
CHRP. These notices stated that we had been
terminated from out jobs with CHRP by the

"Executive Board of the OST and that we had ten
days after receipt of this termination notice in
which to submit in writing an appeal of this
action to the OST Evaluation Committee.

. “I did participate in demonstrations against
the administration of RICHARD WILSON, the OST

i Chairman, which were held in front of the Bureau

of Indian Affairs building, Pine Ridge, South

Dakota. BARBARA MEANS had obtained a Permit from

the OST Police Department, Pine Ridge, South

Dakota, on all occasions when these demonstra~

| tions were held. The demonstrations were held

for the purpose of advocating a new form of OST

government and against the policies carried on

i y Tribal Chairman, RICHARD WILSON. I feel that

Hl the Executive “oard of the OST acts without the

entire 15 council representatives being con-

sulted, and therefore, the people are not being

i represented properly.

“RICHARD WILSON was well aware that I was

t against him and his administration and he was
just waiting for_an opportunity to fire me from
my employment. BELLA STARR had told me that
RICHARD WILSON had offered my position to VIVIAN
I AMIOTTE, a licensed practical nurse, a short time
after he was elected tribal chairman.

"I believe that RICHARD WILSON and the
Executive Board used my participation in the
od demonstrations and my membership in the Oglala
| Sioux Civil Rights Organization as an excuse to
terminate my employment. I believe that I was
fired merely for exercizing my right under the
Constitution of the United States to participate
in a peaceful demonstration and to belong to any
lawful organization.

"I did not participate in any demonstrations
during working hours, and when I did so partici-
pate, I had taken annual leave, that is, time off
from work.

“ELMER LA POINTE, CHR Coordinator, who is
located in Aberdeen, South Dakota, had advised
me that I was free to join any organization I
wished to join as I had told him that I had
joined the Oglala Sioux Civil Rights Organization.
LA POINTE also told me that I was free to take
part in any demonstration as long as I did so on
my own time and not working hours.

“According to OST Personnel Policies, I
should have been given a two week notice and it
should have been this board which gave me the
notice rather than the OST Executive Board. The
following are members of the Personnel Policies
Board known to mes

"GUY RONDELL of the Presbyterian Church,
a Minister.

"RAY MC HUE of the Faith Mission.

"In fact, on approximately April 16, 1973,
RAY MG HUE told me the Personnel Policy Board
was meeting on that date and he asked me if I
was going to appeal my dismissal. MC HUE told
me that he did not know that I had been fired
until he had received a letter from the OST
Executive Board subsequent to my dismissal.

"A Resolution had been passed in the OST
administration prior to RICHARD WILSON's admin-
istration placing in effect the Merit System
which would have included all Tribal Programs,
including the functions of the Personnel Policy
Board, During DICK WILSON's administration,

“the Executive Board began hiring and firing
people on their own volition. Subsequently in
order to obtain certain programs, e.g. Public
Service Careers, a Merit System was required
and because of the complaints of the OST residents,
~~ RICHARD WILSON began using the Merit System again.
After I was fired I talked to CLEVELAND NELSON,
who is employed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs,
U. S. Department of the Interior, and who was
apparently acting in the place of STANLEY LYMAN,
the Bureau of Indian Affairs Superintendent of
the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation.

"T called LYMAN's office on that occasion
telephone and NELSON answered the phone.
NELSON advised me at that time that to his
ImowLedge the Merit System Resolution was still
in effect. The Resolution pertaining to the
Merit System has a number which I do not know.

"A letter was sent by registered U. S.
Mail appealing this job termination in my name
and in the names of MINERVA WALKS OUT, DELLA
STARR and VICTORIA WOUNDED FOOT on April 16,
1973. MINERVA WALKS OUT typed this appeal
letter and it was signed by the above three
women and myself. This letter was mailed to the
OST Executive Board.

"The records of the CHRP are pregently in
the possession of FRANCIS KILLER, a Certified
Public Accountant, Vermillion, South Dakota.
He took these records on April 6, 1973, for
quarterly auditing purposes. .Annual leave
records are also contained in these books.

"I also solicited signatures for a petition
to "Petition of the Oglala Sioux People to the
Secretary of the Interior For a Referendum Vote
to Revoke The Constitution and Bylaws of the
Oglala Sioux Tribe and To establish a New Form
of Government For the People! and I signed this
petition myself. I was also the signature of
witness on pages of this petition when they were
notarized. These petitions were taken to
Superintendent STANLEY LYMAN. I feel that this
is another reason why RICHARD WILSON had me fired.
ALL work performed by me in behalf of this
petition was performed on my own time.

“I have vead this statement which consists
of 7 pages and it is true and correct to the
best of my knowledge.

GERALDINE JANIS further advised that ELLEN MOVES CAMP
has been in Wounded Knee, South Dakota, since this town
was seized by AIM (American Indian Movement) supporters.
She stated ELLEN MOVES CAMP had also been fired from her
position with CHRP but that she would have been dismissed
due to her absence from work. JANIS advised that ELLEN
MOVES .CAMP had sent a message from Wounded Knee approxi-
mately in the last week of March, 1973, that she wished
to resign from her job with CHRP.

The above facts were discussed with R. DENNIS ICKES,
Departmental Attorney, U. S. Department of Justice, Pine
Ridge, South Dakota, on April 21, 1973, by Special Agents
JOSEPH C. MC DONALD and MARVIN J. BRACKEN of the FBI,
and ICKES advised that no prosecutive action would be
taken at the present time, although it appears that a
possible violation of Title 18, Section 241, U. S. Code
may exist, ICKES advised that no further investigation
should be conducted until the victim's appeal has been
adjudicated by the Oglala Sioux Tribal Executive Board.

RICHARD "DICK" WILSON is the duly elected President
of the Oglala Sioux Tribal Council, Pine Ridge Indian
Reservation, and in this position he has taken a strong
stand against the American Indian Movement (AIM) and its
objectives. Impeachment action has been taken against
WILSON on numerous occasions by members of the Tribal
Council sympathetic to AIM, and his removal has been a
primary objective of AIM at Wounded Knee, South Dakota.
He and his supporters, commonly referred to as his “goon
squad," have been the subjects of numerous civil rights
complaints that have been made during the negotiations
at Wounded Knee.

advised CHief Wilson that he was thers asa ¥epresentative from FBI

could to assist in training members of his (Tribal Police Force. The
Police Training Coordinator of the Minneapy tis FBI Office and two |
especially selected police instructors conferred with the Chief on the
nature of the training needed. Chief Wilson wanted to give the new
officers eight hours of training and put them out on patrol with an

experienced officer. Rive Ridge, Gi de ao
: Inspector Cotter and the Police Training Coordinator put .
together a preiiminary program of 18 hours which they felt was a

minimum requirement. Chief Wilson said that they had been able to hire
41 individuals, some of whom had college degrees, and he was pleased
that the caliber of the people they were employing was above average.
The program put together included firearms training in shoulder weapons,
techniques and mechanics of arrest, basic and investigative techniques
covering the protection of crime scenes and interviewing, law as it
applies to Indian versus Indian on the reservation, patrol procedures,
"identification of explosives and anti-sniper and survival tactics.
The program was set up to be held six hours a day for three days after
which time the trainees would be put with an experienced Indian officer.

: The Chief was most appreciative that the FBI had taken such
special interest in providing training toéhis people. He said the FBIUz
was the only agency that had kept its promises té‘him: and, speaking
very frankly, he said that the FBI was the only Federal agency really

FRAUD AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT

Vincent Brewer, former Executive Director, and
Hobart Keith, Board member, both of the Oglala Sioux Housing
Authority, Pine Ridge, South Dakota, Indian Reservation, have
advised the Oglala Sioux Tribe has borrowed approximately two
million dollars with which to construct homes on the Pine
Ridge Indian Reservation. They advised the money was borrowed
from the Public Housing Administration, an agency of the U.S.
Government, with the money to be repaid by the tribe. Part of
the agreement the tribe entered into with the Public Housing
Administration was that the latter would furnish a man to supervise
construction of the buildings, Heintzelman has been given this
job.

Brewer alleges a Board of Commissioners, consisting of
the Reservation Superintendent, several local persons, and
Albert Dale as treasurer, has been set up to oversee the project.
He described Dale as the owner of a bank in Rushville, Nebraska,
and also a stockholder in the Rushville Lumber Company.

It is alleged that Heintzelman has failed to open and
accept bids for materials as specified at the time the bids are
let. He has accepted bids on his own, without the Commissioners
approval, from companies which he contacted after opening original
bids received,

CHARLES E, HEINTZELMAN ET AL

Both men claim the Rushville Lumber Company has
submitted the low bid on approximately 75 per cent of the
building materials used, and that in almost every instance,
the bid of this company has been just a few dollars lower
than that of the next lowest bidder. Brewer claims wholesale
lumbermen: have advised him a retail lumber business, such
as the Rushville Lumber Company, could not submit such low bids
profitably.

It is also alleged that Richard Wilson, who is in charge
of the plumbing work on the project, has used materials from
the housing project to construct a home, a basement, and a
partially finished plumbing shop, with the knowledge of
Heintzelman., None of this material has apparently been paid for.

Brewer advised there are several other instances
where materials from the project have been used to put additions
onto homes on the reservation, apparently with Heintzelman's
knowledge,

Keith advised he purchased a furnace from Wilson,
which came from a home that was removed from the project. This
furnace, together with other appliances in the home, were to be
sold to the highest bidder. Instead, Heintzelman gave them to
Wilson, who in turn sold at least part of them.

Efforts on the part of Keith to examine project records
have been thwarted, although he claims he is entitled to
examine such records as a Board member.

Synopsis:

JAMES F, FAIL advised he had received complaints alleging property
at housing project on Pine Ridge Indian Reservation being disposed
of improperly. Advised complainants allege contracts are being

let by HRINTZELMAN improperly, with Rushville Lumber Co., of which
ALBERT DALE is allegedly a large stockholder, getting majority of
bids. DALE also treasurer of Oglala Sioux Housing Authority. FAIL
advised government funds and property involved. HEINTZELMAN denies
any improper-activities, claims property being disposed of in a
legitimate manner and contracts being let only to lowest qualified
bidders. HOBART KEITH and VINCENT BREWER allege HEINTZELMAN has
taken over authority of the Housing Authority, and he and WILSON
illegally disposing of housing project materials. Minutes of
Housing Authority indicate HEINTZELMAN given authority to buy and
sell for the Authority. WILSON admits using housing project
materials for own use, but claims intends to pay for them.

At Pine Ridge, South Dakota

On January 24, 1964, Special Officer JAMES F, FAIL,

received complaints from HOBART KEITH, a member of the Board of
Directors of the Oglala Sioux Housing Authority, and from VINCENT
BREWER, a former executive director of the Authority, alleging

Lumber Company, improperly, FAIL advised he did not know if
government funds or property are involved, but that KEITH, as a
board member, is checking records of the Housing Authority to
determine just what is involved.

- On January 28, 1964, Mr. FAIL advised KEITH had attempted
to check the records, but that Mrs. RICHARD WILSON, the acting
executive director, had refused to make the records available to
hin. He stated that LLEWLLYN KINGSLEY, superintendent of the
reservation, had advised him the funds and property involved in

the housing project are government property and funds.

On January 29, 1964, the facts concerning this matter
were discussed with Assistant United States Attorney PARNELL J.
DONOHUE, Mx. DONOHUE advised that if the facts, as alleged, are
proven, the case would warrant prosecutive consideration under
Title 18, Section 286 and 287,

On January 30, 1964, CECIL KEITH was interviewed and he
furnished the following signed statement:

“January 30, 1964

"I, CECIL HOBART KEITH, having been duly
sworn, make the following voluntary statement to
JOHN E. McCARTY who has identified himself to me to

Investigation.

"I have been advised I do not have to give

MP 46-2614

"ALBERT DALE is a banker at Rushville,
Nebraska, It is my understanding he also owns a
thirty one-per cent interest in the Rushville Lumber
Co. I do not know for sure, but it appears to me
that nalf or more of the building materials in the
housing project have been purchased from the Rushville
Lumber Co, I have no information as to the bids sub-
mitted by this company.

"I have never been really sure just what
HEINTZELMANS authority is, however, I know that as
a matter of practice he has been letting bids for
materials entirely on his own. He has not consulted
the Board about any bids he has accepted or declined.

"In about April, 1963 I hired DICK WILSON to
put in some soil pipe at my home. WILSON furnished the
materials, and I do not know where they came fron.
I gave him forty five or fifty dollars for this.

"About this time WILSON told me he had a
furnace for sale so I bought it, paying WILSON
seventy ‘five dollars for it. The furnace is in my
home now.

"Later I became suspicious for some reason or
other, so I asked WILSON where he had obtained the
furnace. As nearly as I can recall WILSON said,
it’s all right, I've got a deal with either the boss
or HEINTZELMAN, I don't remember just how he did
refer to HEINTZELMAN. I believe the furnace I bought
is a Bryant, and I'm quite sure, although I can't
prove it, that this furnace came from the DEWEY
CLIFFORD house. 7

"The CLIFFORD house had to be moved from its
foundation, and moved to another location in the
housing project. The Housing Authority bought the
house, but I'm not sure what was to be done with the
appliances and furnishings in the house.

"I also agreed to paint a picture for WILSON.
In payment WILSON gave me a pressure tank which I

-3-

NW 68262 Docld:32989685 Page 510



MP 46-2614

believe came from the CLIFFORD house. I actually
picked the tank up from where it was lying on the
ground near where the lumber storage yard is at
the Housing project.

- "I know a basement was built at the BILL
SALWAY home in Pine Ridge early in the fall of 1963.
I know the materials were from the Housing project,
and the basement was built by workmen on the

project payroll. This was a deal HEINTZELMAN arranged

for, and I do not know who is to be paid for it.

"I have no other personal knowledge of this
matter, except that to my knowledge the Board of
Commissioners never authorized HEINTZELMAN to sell
or dispose of any of the project materials,

"I also entered into a verbal agreement with
HEINTZELMAN, before I went on the Board of
Commissioners, to paint a large emblem for two
hundred and seventy five dollars, and to paint
designs on shutters of the houses in Project SD l-1l
for six-hundred dollars. I did not submit a
written bid on this, and to my knowledge no one else
did either. I received all this money.

On January 30, 1964, VINCENT BREWER was interviewed

and he furnished the following signed statement;
: "January 30, 1964
Pine Ridges, South Dakota

"I, VINCENT BREWER, having been duly sworn,
make the following voluntary statement to JOHN E.
McCARTY, who I know to be a Special Agent of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

"YT have been advised I do not have to give
this statement, and that it may be used in court.
No threats, promises, or force of any kind has

"J was the Executive Director of the Oglala
Sioux Housing authority at Pine Ridge, South Dakota
from April 14, 1962, until Sept. 10, 1963 when I
resigned.

"In 1961 the Oglala Sioux Tribe set up the
Housing ‘Authority, and the authority hired me. My
duties were to mamage the homes after they were built
and.to take and screen applications for the homes.

“The HouSing Authority was set up to obtain a
contract with the Public Housing Administration to
obtain low rent houses for local people. This con= s
tract was obtained, with the following agreements.

"The Tribe leased land to the Public Housing
Administration for twenty five years. Public Housing
then issued bonds on the project, and then loaned
money from the sale of the bonds to the Housing
Authority. This money is to be repaid by the Housing
Authority through the collection of rents, over a
period of forty years,

“The Public Housing Administration loaned
$793,000 for project S.D, l<1l, which consists of
fifty one private houses plus an administration
building in Pine Ridge. $267,000 was loaned for

project S.D. 1-2 which is an old folks home con-=
sisting of twenty three units, all in ome building,
in Pine Ridge, $1,110,000 was loamed for project
S.D, 1-3, which consists of seventy six private
homes, located on various parts of the reservation.

"Project S.D, 1-1 was started about May 1,
1962, and was completed in about October, 1963.
Project S.D. 1-2 was started in about July, 1963,
and is scheduled fer completion in the spring of
1964, S.D. 1-3 was started about July, 1963 and
is scheduled for completion im the fall of 1964.

"The Housing Authority decided to build on a
‘force account’ basis, to create more employment
on the reservation. Because of this Public Housing
| required it furnish a man. to be in charge of the
| construction of the units. CHARLES B. HEINTZELMAN
was put in charge of the project.

"ALBERT DALE is the treasurer of the Board of
\ Commissioners. He is also the president of the
Stockmens National Bank at Rushville, Nebraska. I
understand he is a stwckholder in the Rushville
Lumber yard, although I do mot know this for a fact.

“DICK WILSON is the Plumber-Foreman of the
project, hired by HEINTZELMAN, WILSON'’s wife is
HEINTZELMAN'sS secretary. MYLES TYLER is construction
superintendent, and was hired by the Board on
HEINIZELMAN's recommendation.

"The Board members are appointed by the Oglala
Sioux Tribal Council. Members are paid only mileage.

"EVANS LUCAS and Associates of Sioux Falis,
South Dakota was the original architectural firm on the
project. This company resigned early in January,
1963 because it felt HEINTZELMAN was changing the
materials called for in the plans and because he
was using inferior products. This company had worked
just on S.D. 1-1, and no one was hired to finish out
this job.

~ 6

NW 68262 Docid:32989685 Page 513



MP 46-2614

"CRAIG and BROOKS was the architectural firm
on S.D. 1-2. This company also resigned after a
hassle with HEINTZELMAN. The company claimed
HEINTZELMAN was cheapening the buildings, and was
uSing inferbr and poorer quality materials than
called for in the plans.

"IRVING R. DANA was hired as the architect on
S.D, 1-3. It is my belief DANA gets along with
HEINTZELMAN because he has followed HEINTZELMAN's
recommendations. I told him when he started that he
would have to feel HEINTZELMAN out to see what he
wanted, and DANA indicated to me he was going to do
this. DANA is the son in law of BILL HEWITT of
Rushville, Nebraska.

"IJ believe $787,000 was actually spent on
S.D. 1-1.

"Bids for materials were to be obtained by
advertising for them. The advertisements specified
the bids were to be opened at a specified date and
time. It was my understanding they were to be opened
in the presence of the Board of Commissioners, and
accepted or rejected by the Board.

"AS a matter of practice when the bids came in
they would be held by the secretary, and given to
HEINTZELMAN when he came in. He would then open
the bids himself, whettever he felt like it. He
would accept or reject bids as he chose, without con-
sulting the Board. I know personally of a few bids
he accepted which were the lowest bids submitted. I
also know of a few instances where he accepted bias
higher than the lowest bids, claiming the materials
in the lower bids were not what he wanted.

"The only instance I know of where he consulted 3
the Board on a bid was on bricks for S.D, 1-2. In Fl
this instance the Board accepted a certain type of : i
brick, but HEINTZELMAN later changed this on his. own, F
and put up a different brick, 4

-7T7-

MP 46-2614

"Ounce advertisements were put out for fifty
stoves and fifty refrigerators, When the bids came
in HEINTZELMAN said he could do better tham that.

He took the bids and went to Minmeapolis. Whem he
came back he said ke had bought the stoves and
refrigerators from some company out of Chicago. This
company had not submitted a bid originally. He did
get these cheaper than the lowest bid originally sub-
mitted. —

"It seemed to me the vast majority of the
building materials for the projects were supplied
by the Rushville Lumber Co. although 1 couldn't
tell what percentage of the total materials tke
company did supply. I recall sesing some of the bids,
and it seemed to me the Rushville Lumber Co. bids were
always just a little bit lower than the next lowest
bidder. I do sot know im what manner HEINTZELMAN
obtained these bids.

"On two different occasions, salesmen for two
ditferent wholesale lumber companies told me they
could not understand how a retail lumber company, such
as Rushville Lumber, could underbid a wholesale lumber
company.

“HEINTZELMAN told me encé the houses were running
between ten and eleven thousand dollars apiece. This
did not include streets, curbs, landscaping, etc.

"I know regulations required any surplus materials
were to be put out om bids, and sold to the highest
bidder. I am quite sure no one had any authority to
sell materials, except for surplus materials to the
highest bidder. :

“HEINTZELMAN told me he gave the old blocks from |
the CLIFFORD house to DICK WILSON. We had to get then ‘
out so we could put a street through there. WILSON
was going to use the blocks to build a basement for
himself.

NW 68262 Docld:32989685 Page 515


MP 46~2614

"I then saw WILSON take one hundred and ten
brand new blocks that belonged to the Housing
Authority.. As I recall he hauled them away in the
Housing Authority truck. Y asked him about this,
and he told me HEINTZELMAN had told him it was 0.K.
for him to move them, and he could take what he
wanted,

"I then called HEINTZELMAN in WILSON's presence.
CHARLEY HEINTZELMAN said to let it go, as DICK was
going to pay for them. WILSON them took four humdred
more blocks. WILSON aso took thirty sacks of cement,
three or four sacks of lime, and some sand.

“The blocks were worth twenty six cents apiece,
the lime and cement were worth about ninety six cents
a sack, and the sand worth approximately fifteen to
twenty dollars. JI made WILSON sign a receipt for
these materials. WILSON then used the materials to
build a block basement in Pine Ridge.

"This happened in July, 1962. Just a few days
ago WILSON told me he had his bills, but had never
paid for the materials.

"The DEWEY CLIFFORD house had to be moved from
the project area. The Housing Authority bought the
house. CHARLEY told WILSON toe disconnect the furnace,
jet pump, hot water heater, plumbing fixtures etc.
WILSON did discommect the fixtures, but took them to
his home. I latersaw the articles at WILSON's home
and told him to take them to the project yard. He
said he would return them, but he mever did.

"I know the furnace by sight, and I know this
is the same furnace WILSON sold to HOBART KEITH.

"I believe FRANK E. COFFEY, SR. bought the rest
of the stuff from WILSON. Actually all of this should
have been sold on bid to the highest bidder. To my
knowledge WILSON never turned this money in.

"In the fall of 1963, in about September, WILSON
built a complete new home for his mother in Pine Ridge.

NW 68262 Docld:32989685 Page 516



MP 46-2614

I saw JIM BIG CROW, who WILSON had hired, hauling
materials from the project to the site of the house
in a Housiag Authority truck. This movement of
materials took place on weekends. WILSON once told
me he had about eight bundred dollars worth of
materials in this house.

“In the fall of 1963, in about October, WILSON
and JAMES RED WING started building a cement block
building in Pine Ridge. WILSON told me he was going
to use one part of it for a plumbing shop. I don't
recall what he said RED WING was going to use the
other part for.

"“T saw BIG CROW hauling new blocks from the
housing project aréa in a Housing Authority truck
to the site of this building. I believe the sand, lime,
and cement for the building came from tke project also.
I would estimate there are about eighteen hundred blocks,
worth four hundred and sixty eight dollars in the building.
There is approximately ninety six dgllars worth of lime
and cement, and about sixty dollars worth of sand in the
building.

"JESSIE EAGLE HEART told me she had made an
arrangement with CHARLEY to have an addition put
on her house. I kzow MYLES TYLER supervised the
job, and project workmen did the work amd were paid
from Housing Authority funds. I do not know what
financial arrangements were made on this.

"Said on one occasion GORDON REICHENBORG, who
lives in Rushville, Nebraska, told me REINTZELMAN
was getting all the windows for his new house for
him, 1 dok't know if the windows were to come
from the housing project or not. This occurred in
the summer of 1963.

"During the summer of 1963 HUGH JOHN BLACKSMITH,

who was timekeeper on the housing project, built

an addition on to his house. I know part of the
naterials were ordered from the Rushville lumber
yard, but part of the materials he trucked from the
project to his home at night in a housing project
truck. Someone, I dan'’t recall who, told me he had
seen BLACKSMITH hauling the materials off.

- 10

MP 46~2614

"On different occasious I told HEINIZELMAN
that he just coulda'’t do what he was doing,
that it just wasn’t right. Yhe only answer he
ever gave me was, ‘He’s going to pay for it.

"I made all the bank deposits of all receipts
the Housing Authority took in. At no time did the
Housing Authority receive any money from anyone for
materials they had received from the project. I
didu't physically make all the deposits, but I did
check and Hst all deposits and once in awhile
BLACKSMITH would physically deposit it.

“Northwest Pipe Fitting Co. of Rapid City,
South Dakota had all the plumbing costracts with
the Housing Authority. I kaow HEINTZELMAN and a
former assistant manager of this company were very
close to each other.

"DICK WILSON had a free hand im ordering from
this company. It seemed to me he was constantly
ordering something from this company. I believe he
ordered much more plumbing materials than were
actually used in the housing project.

"I have read this statement of nine pages, and
it is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

thought it was a bad deal, as he was the only one that

wasn't interested as there was no roof or windows in

done, and I had nothing to do with this. I know
nothing about the organizational set up of the
Housing Authority on the administrative procedures
that were followed.

“The DEWEY CLIFFORD home had to be moved in
project S,D, 1-1 as it was in the middle of where
a street was to go. The house itself was re-used,
but the basement had to be torn out.

"Mv, HEINTZELMAN gave me the cement blocks from
this home just to get them out of there. I salvaged
four or five hundred blocks from the CLIFFORD
house, and used them in the constructiom of a base-
ment in Pine Ridgs. I planned to build a house
on the basement.

“there were not enough of the CLIFFORD house
to finish the basement, so I got four or five
bundred new cement blocks from the project to
finish my basement. I hauled these blocks from the
project site to my basement in a Housing Authority
€ruck on Sundays and in the evenings. I had
authority to use this truck for my personal use if
I furnished the gas for it, which I did.

"Before taking any of the new blocks I asked
JOE WALTZES, the construction superintendent, if
I could buy the blocks, as I knew we had an excess
of them. He told me to go ahead and take them.

"While taking them VINCENT BREWER asked me if
I had made arrangements to get the blocks. I told
him I had. I do not recall if we then contacted
HEINTZELMAN or not. I also took about twenty five
bags of cement, ten bags of lime and I salvaged
some sand from finished basements.

"Even before I talked to JOH I had asked Mr.
HEINTZELMAN if I could buy materiais from the project,
and he said I could. I didn't specify what materials
I wanted, and the only arrangements I made to pay for
them was that I told him I would pay whatever the
Housing Authority paid for the materials. There was
no mention made of who I was to pay or when I was to
pay. In my own mind I felt I was to pay the housing
authority.

"I obtained these materials in about July or
August, 1962. Up to the present time I have not
been billed for them, and I have not yet paid for them.

"I know that a house I helped physically build for
my mother, JULIA WILSON, was built ewtirely with
materials from the housing project. My mother made
all the arrangements for this through Mr. BERGEN, and
I had nothing to do with arranging for or paying for
these materials.

"Mr. HEINTZELMAN told me to remove everything
from the CLIFFORD house so it could be moved, He
told me to store the stuff I took out. I took a
furnace, a pump, a tub, a stool, a lavatery, a kitchen
Sink and stove from the house. I also took a pressure
tank, which was part of the pump.

"At that time the Housing Authority had no storage -.

area, so I stored the articles in a shed owned by my
mother. This was in about August, 1962. I remember
VINCENT BREWER asking me later if I had these
articles, and I told him I did. I do not recall him
telling me to return them to the project.

"I can't recall when, but one time I told HOBART
KEITH I had a furnace that belonged to the housing
project. He asked to buy it, so I told him to go

‘ahead and take it, which he did. I did not discuss
any arrangements for payment with him, but I assumed
KEITH made this arrangement with HEINTZELMAN. Later
my wife told me KEITH had paid fifty dollars, I
believe, to the Housing Authority for the furnace.
This is the same furnace I got from the CLIFFORD house.

Vk

NW 68262 Docld:32989685 Page 523



MP 46-2614

"Y later gave KEITH the pressure tank because
he told me his leaked. No arrangements were made
for payment, but I assumed he would pay the
Housing Authority for it. This tank was not in exe
change for any painting. I did ask KEITH to do a
painting for me, and I have already paid him
eighteen dollars in cash for it, but he has never
given me the painting.

“In the fall of 1962 FRANK E COFFEY was build-
ing a bathroom onte his house. I told him of the
stuff I had. I assumed he made arrangements through
the Housing Authority, because he came and got the
tub and the lavatory. I made no arrangements with
ECOFFEY for payment of these articles, and I got
nothing for them. I don't know if he has ever paid
to housing authority for them or not.

"I put in some soil pipe for both KEITH and
ECOFFEY in the summer and fall of 1962. In both
instances I got the materials I used, which was about
twenty five feet of soil pipe and six fittings at
KEITH's, and about fifteen feet of soil pipe and
four fittings at ECOFFEY's.

“Both of them paid me for my labor. They did
not pay for the materials because I figures they would
pay the Housing Authority for it. I did not tell
them where the material had come from, but they had
to know the Housing project is the only place in town
it could have come from, I had made no arrangements
with anyone ahead of time to take this pipe.

"In about September, 1963 I told JIM RED WING
I had some lots, and I wanted to build a building
on it, but didn’t have the money to go ahead. I
had to put a building within ninety days or lose the
lots, as this is the policy of the Planning Commission
which assigned me the lots.

"I told RED WING I could get the materials
through the Housing project. We decided to build

the building, with me to use half of it for a plumbing
shop, and he to use half for a garage.

i

MP 46-2614

"RED WING bought the first blocks for the
pbuilding, two semiloads. He bought them from JOHN
MAGAHEY (Pho) in Gordon, Nebraska. He also had some
he had bought previously from a Reverand UNRAU in
Pine Ridge. < 7

."In about October, 1963 I got about one hundred
and fifty new cement blocks and twenty five bags of
masonry cememt from the S.D, 1-2 project. We
salvaged sand from finished basements on S.D. 1-3.

“I asked HEINTZELMAN ahead of time if I could
get these blocks as we had an excess of blocks on
S.D.1-2. He told me I could have them. No arrange-
ments were made for paying for them. I have not
been billed for them and have not paid for them.

I intend to pay for them soon, I suppose.

"I also got seventy feet of three quarter inch
copper tubing and one curb box from the housing
project for this building. HEINTZELMAN knew of this,
but no arrangement was made to pay for it.

"I have no knowledge of the deal JERRY WEAVER
made to put an addition on the house owned by my
mother on land he leases from her.

"In about November, 1963 I used sixty feet of
half inch copper tubing, twenty eight feet of inch
and a half copper tubing, about a dozen fittings,
and two frost proof hose bibs, in a plumbing job I
did for FRED GERBER. I got this material from
S.D. 1-3 project. I had previously made arrange~
ments with Mr. HEINTZELMAN to get whatever materials
I needed. He told me just to keep a list of it and
check it out through the office whenever I took
something, which I did. So I did not specifically {|
ask him for this material. 4

"GERBER paid me forty six dollars approximately
for the labor and material on this job. I have not
yet paid for this material, or been billed for it.

"There are no other plumbing jobs that I have

box are on the list, which I got for the building

was asked if records of the project were in her custody, and if
they might be examined.

- Mrs, WILSON advised she does have the records in her

VINCENT BREWER was re-~interviewed under oath. He ad=
vised the only list DICK WILSON ever turned in to him was for
the five hundred and ten (510) blocks, and WILSON did that only
because BREWER had caught him in the act of taking them, and made
him list them.

BREWER said the materials from the CLIFFORD house
were in a shack in which WILSON was living at the time he found
them, He stated there definitely was a storage area at the
housing project at the time the CLIFFORD materials were removed,
as that is the first thing built at the project.

He stated that to his knowledge neither KEITH nor
ECOFFEY has ever paid for any materials from the project. He
also said that when he was in office, at no time was there any
authority granted to anyone to sell anything except surplus or
excess materials, and then to the highest bidder. He said that
to his knowledge there is nothing in writing giving anyone
authority to sell anything belonging to the project.

On January 31, 1964, LLEWELLYN KINGSLEY was interviewed
and he furnished the following signed statement:
‘; "yanuary 31, 1964
Pine Ridge, South Dakota

"I, LLEWELLYN KINGSLEY, having been duly sworn,
make the following voluntary statement te JOHN E.
McCARTY, who I know to be a Special Agent of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

"I have been advised I do not kave to give
this statement and that it may be used 4m court.
No threats, promises, or force of any kind has been
used to nake me give this statement.

"I am the superintendent of the Pine Ridge
Indian Reservation, and because of my position I am
an ex-officio member of the Oglala Sioux Housing
Authority. I have held these positions since
September, 1963.

"In 1961 a contract was entered into between the
Housing Authority and the Public Housing Administra~
tion. The agreement was the P.H.A. would loan the
money to the Authority. The Authority then sold
bonds and repaid the government. P.H.A, then pays
the interest on the bonds and guarantees their payment.

“CHARLES HEINTZELMAN was assigned by P.H.A. as
its representative on the local projects. I am not
sure What is the authority of HEINTZELMAN or the
Executive Director. The Housing Authority is actually
responsible for the entire project. I do not know
how far HEINTZELMAN's authority extends insofar as the
handling of bids and contracts are concerned. It is
my understanding HEINTZELMAN has, as a matter of
practice, handled the awarding of bids and contracts
with the assistance of his office staff.

"It appears HEINTZELMAN has been acting both
as P.H.A. representative and supervisor for the
Housing Authority. I believe he is paid only by
P.HLA,

MP 46-2614

"There is a stipulation, either im the contract
or the original ordinance setting up the project,
stating the Housing Authority cam buy or sell the
same as any other corporation. There is also a
letter in file from the Tribal Attorney stating
it is within the authority of the Housing Authority
to sell materials to the Indian pespie to use in
fixing up sanitation in their homes. In my opinion
there are no limitations on the sale of materials, but
I feel it is the responsibility of the Housing Authority
to make sure this doesn't get out of hand.

“At the end of forty years when the bonds are
paid off, the entire project is turned over to the
Tribe by the government. Until that time, the
government has the right to inspect the property,
terminate the contract, and actually is totally ine
volved in the whole project. Should the Public Housing
Administration feel anything is wrong, it cam take the
whole project away from the Housing Authority.

“Insofar as to the actual letting of bids and
accepting of contracts, I have no knowledge of the
mechanics involved. I have never had any reason to
question the correctness of the procedures being
used. To my knowledge HEINTZELMAN has never dis-
cussed any bids or contracts with the Housing Authority.

"J do not know what procedure was supposed to
be followed in the disposal of such items as thosein
the CLIFFORD house,

"I do not know why the first architectural firm
left the project. Craig and Brooks was fired by the
Housing Authority on HEINTZELMAN's recommendation.
The. architects claimed inferior or cheaper materials
were being used in the buildings than their specie
fications called for. It is true less expensive
materials were being used, on HEINTZELMAN's recommen
dation, as we had to stay within the limits of ian
funds we had available.

"{' do not feel that any changes made in the
specifications materially altered the quality or

wo 2A a

MP 46-2614

usefulness of the buildings to any significant
degree. All the changes had to be approved by
the Board, and were minor changes.

"I have never to date had any reason to
suspect or believe there has been anything wrong in
the housing project in Pine Ridge.

"I want to state I am not’ sure if the
original contract between P,H.A, and the Housing
Authority was entered into im 1961 or 1962.

“Actually Craig and Brooks objected to all
of the proposed changes and modifications wanted
by the Housing Authority. Also the Authority felt
the firm was not fulfilling all of the terms of
their contract. This is why the firm was dis-
charged. Actually HEINTZELMAN did not recommend
dismissing the firm, but he is the one that recom—
mended the proposed modifications.

has no money in the Pine Ridge project at the
present time. P.H.A, can step in at a later date,
if necessary, and take over the project however.
Also, if necessary, P.H.A. can subsidge the

Housing Authority if rental imctme is not sufficient
to meet the financial requirement of the project.

My job normally is as an inspector for P.H.A.
to inspect construction, and make sure P.H.A..

‘standards are met. The Pine Ridge project is unique

in that it was built “forced account." This was
dons to insure that local Indians would be given
work on the project.

"Since the local Housing Authority had no
knowledge as to how to build this project, I was
asked by the Housing Authority to build the project.
I have acted in the capacity of both inspector for
P.H.A., and contractor, purchasing agent, and about
everything else, for the local Housing Authority.
This has been done with the knowledge of my superiors
in the Chicago Office of P.H.A.

‘*Advertisements for bids are prepared by my office.
They specify a date by which the bids are to be in.
Normally there is no specific time that these bids have
to be opened:

"Y would normally open the bids, and discuss
them with at least part of the Housing Authority
members, This was not always done in Housing Authority
meetings, as that group normally meets but once a
month, and we might have many bids to accept or reject
before the next meeting was scheduled. The Housing
Authority has given me authority to accept or reject bids.

"There have been occasions where I have rejected
all the bids received on a particular item, if I felt they
did not meet specifications, I would then go out and
obtain other lower or more satisfactory bids, but I

did not make the original bids we had received public.

"I do not know if ALBERT DALE has an interest in
the Rushville Lumber Company or not. That compamy did
receive mamy of the contracts for building materials.
This was just because that company could sell the
Housing Authority materials meeting our specifications
at a lower cost than other companies.

this was a fair price. I assume the rest of the
articles from the CLIFFORD home are still in the
possession of the Housing Authority. These articles
did not have to be sold on bid. The Authority

would just sell them to whoever imquired about buying
it and gave the highest offer.

need, that he should list any materials he did obtain,
and that he would have to pay for them.

their homes. This was to apply prémarily to
bathrooms, and the people were to be billed for
the materials used. If WILSON used plumbing supplies
on such jobs it would have beem under this authorization.

everyone either has or will have to pay for all
materials received from the Housing Authority.

"The Housing Authority, and not I, discharged
the architectural firms of Evans Lucas and Craig

for such expensive items they were completely out of

of the funds we had available.

“I purchased the refrigerators for Project S.D,1-l
from the lowest bidder in Minneapolis, Mimnesota. The

considerably less than the alloted amount.

the buildings for quality of materials and to make

are out of the Chicago Office and are not under my

of the architect on those jobs, Mr_ DAMA, who is working
for the Housing Authority. Also the building must meet

SAMUEL STANDS, having been duly sworn, was
interviewed in the. presence of Special Officer JAMES F, FAIL.
STANDS advised he is the Chairman of the Oglala Sioux Housing
Authority. He also stated he has a fourth grade education,
and cwnnot read or write very well.

STANDS furnished the following information.

7 He is not very familiar with the financial or
organizational structure of the Oglala Sioux Housing
Authority, and does not know if the Housing Authority has
paid back to the Public Housing Administration, the money
originally borrowed from it.

All bids and contracts were handled by Hr.
HEINTZELMAN or MYLES TYLER, the Construction Superintendent,
and no one ever discussed any bids with hin.

The Housing Authority members, and not HEINTZELNAN,
wanted changes made in the plans submitted by architects.
When the architects refused to go along with the requested
changes, the Authority, acting on its own imitiative, fired
the architects.

The Housing Authority orally agreed that local
Indians could buy materials from the housing project for use
in their own construction jobs on the reservation. The
purchasers were to repay the Authority for any materials they
bought. He believes only materials to,be used in adding
bathrooms to homes were to be sold. He does not know for sure
if the authority was extended to sell materials for other
uses or not.

Sometimes bids would be opened by the Authority,
and sometimes by HEINTZELMAN. The Authority as a whole would
decide which bid to accept. He does not know if HEINTZELMAN
ever accepted any bids on his own or not. To his knowledge
HEINTZELMAN always let contracts on the bids accepted by
the Authority, and did not make any unwarranted changes.

The Authority members did look at various material samples
submitted with bids, and would then decide which bid it
wanted to accept.

Mrs. YVONNE WILSON made available records after she
advised such authorization had been made by CHARLES
HEINTZELMAN .

Minutes of the Oglala Sioux Housing Authority
reflect that‘’on June 4, 1962, a motion was made and
carried "That the Oglaza@ Sioux Housing Authority authorize
the Executive Director and the Superintendent of
Construction together with the authority of the Public
Housing Administration to complete all negotiations, and
for the Executive Director or the designee to sign all
purchase orders as the results of bids of the Oglala
Sioux Housing Authority".

The minutes of June 18, 1962, corrected and adopted
the previous minutes to read that the Housing Authority
delegates to the Executive Director and the Superintendent
of Construction the authority to incur obligations for labor
and materials subject to approval of the Public Housing
Administration representative, and that all purchase orders
after clearance may be signed by the Executive Diréctor.

The minutes of January 19, 1962, contain remarks
by Superintendent TOWLE stating the Tribe is to sell bonds
to the Federal Reserve Bank, to obtain money to start the
housing project. Each year the amount of the bonds becoming
due are redeemed by appropriations from the United States
Government to the Public Housing Administration. This money
would not have to be repaid by the Housing Authority or the
Tribe.

There are numerous odd pieces of paper and a few
forms inthe files, reflecting various people, including
RICHARD WILSON, had received materials from the housing
project, and lists the materials received.

Mrs. WILSON pointed out that several people,
including FRED GERBER and HOBART KEITH, have paid for nagerials
received by them. She said actually the sums received from
these two men were paid to DICK WILSON and he in turn paid
the Housing Authority.

"I am the Land Operations Officer on the Pine

if there was a specific agreement or resolution passed

the meterials could be sold. I also know there is
correspondence somewhere from the Tribal Attorney stating
the Housing Authority does have the authority to sell
housing project materials, There was no limitation put on
the type of materials the Authority could sell, that I

both directly and indirectly from the housing project, and
there is nothing improper in this operation.

Date February 18, 1964 -

ALBERT DALE, President, Stockmen's National Bank,
was interviewed at the Stockmen's National Bank, at which time
he was advised the purpose of the interview was to secure
information relative to some complaints of possible wrong~-
doing in connection with the construction of some 127 private
hones and a 23~-unit old folks home at the Pine Ridge Indian
Reservation, Pine Ridge, South Dakota.

. DALE was advised he didmt have to submit to an
interview, that he need not provide any information, that any
information he might provide could be used against him, and
that he was entitled to diseuss this matter with an attorney, if
he so desired,

DALE was further informed that in a matter such as
this that might involve possible fraud against the government
the interviewing agent had authority to conduct such an inter=
view under oath.

DALE stated he had expected an interest in the matter
on the part of the FRI due to the fact he knows a number of
rumors have heen going about the reservation involving CHARLES
EDWARD HEINTIZELMAN, Inspector for the Public Housing Administration,

DALE stated it was his sincere wish tc coogerate in
every way possible in an effort to refute once and for all these
very vicious rumors which according to him threaten the entire
effort to improve the living conditions of the Sioux Indian
nation, .

DALE further stated he had absolutely nothing to
hide, did not desire to consult with an attorney, and would
consent to be intervlewed under oath.

DALE was placed under oath by SA ROBERT D, KINSEY.

DALE related he has been associated with the housing
project at Pine Ridge, South Dakota, virtually since its
inception and has served as non-paid treasurer for the Oglala
Sioux Housing Authorlty (OSHA). He did state. he receives
$5.00 mileage for each round trip he has to make from Rushville,

Nebraska, to Pine Ridge, South Dakota. DALE noted he accepted
this duty, feeling it was a public service due to the fact he
felt the purpose of the project which was to improve the slum
living conditions of the Sioux Indians was a most worthy under-
taking. *

DALE stated the project has been going on for about
three years and original funds to start the project were advanced
by an agency of the U. S. Government, as he recalls the Public
Housing Administration, He stated the advance money was not
received nearly fast enough to pay off the various contractors
and laborers on the job and much of the sum of $1,500,000,00 was
secured through temporary notes to the National City Bank of
New York, New York,City, New York. He stated bonds to cover the
total cost, approximately $2,600,000.00 for the whole project, already
have been advertised and will be issued and placed on sale by the
Hartford National Bank and Trust Company, Hartford, Connecticut,
at 2:30 p.m., March 2, 1964,

DALE said despite this sale of bonds he is of the
opinion some U. S. Government funds will be involved as the
Government is subsidizing the dkum clearance program on the Pine
Ridge Indian Reservation,

DALE stated the aim of the project, in addition to
providing a total of some 127 new private homes and a 23-unit
old folks home, also has provisions to repay Indians whose
homes are destroyed or moved to make room for the new units
as well as providing assistance to Indians who desire to
modernize and repair existing residences.

DALE advised a body known as the Oglala Sioux :
Housing Authority was set up and this group consists of the
following persons: 7

SAMUEL STANDS, Chairman;
EMIL TIBBETTS, Secretary;
LEWELLEN KINGSLEY, Ex-Officio Member; ‘
C, HOBARD KEITH, Member of the Board; :
ALBERT DALE, Treasurer, el

)

DALE noted that neither himself nor any other member
of the Authority is a builder and the entire project is being
overseen by a Mr. CHARLES EDWARD HEINTZELMAN, Inspector,
Public Housing Administration (PHA). He said HEINTZELMAN
resides in Mifineapolis, Minnesota, but works out of the PHA
Headquarters at Chicago, Illinois, and usually spends about
every. other week at the site of the Pine Ridge project.

DALE noted a CHARLES A, REED is project manager,
@ MILES TAYLOR is construction superintendent for the building
of the individual residences, and a Mr, ARNOLD WALTERS is
construction foreman for the old. folks home,

DALE related he has complete confidence in the
ability and integrity of HEINTZELMAN and he has been given
complete authority to act for the OSHA, He said HEINTZELMAN
handles the advertising and publication of the bids, accepts
or rejects these bids subject to review by his superiors,
PHA at Chicago, and generally is responsible for the entire
project,

DALE stated the programing of the slum clearance on
the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, in addition to providing
for the new private homes and for the construction of a 23-unit
old folks home, also provided for the remodeling of existing
homes and under this authority it was permissible for the OSHA
to sell to individual Indians materials from OSHA building stock-~
piles for these repairs and renovations,

In this connection, DALE stated he recalled several
Indians had purchased stools and lavatories from OSHA to add
bathrooms to their residences and he also recalled a WILLIAM
GOINGS secured sufficient materiais to add a room to his
residence,

DALE stated a close accounting is maintained for
all such transactions, which he deseribed as quite numerous,
put he did not feel the entire amount expended would be much
over $10,000.00, if that much,

In this connection he noted PHA in Chicago sends
out an auditor who regularly audits the entire operation at
the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation for all phases of the
construction,

NW 68262 Docld:32989685 Page 554



OM 46-2570
i OT

DALE stated very good progress is being made on all
components of the construction, noting the old folks home is
scheduled to be completed on April 1, 1964, one section known
as S.D. 1-1 of the private home construction, is complete
and the other section, known as S.D. 1~3 of the private home
construction 1s between 40% and 50% complete.

In further reference to bids solicited for
construction, DALE noted regulations provide the calling for
bids be advertised, specifications are described, a letting
date is set, and it is required that three bids be secured,

He said he has never had any suspicions that the entire handling
of the bids was not completely fair, honest and above board,

DALE advised he was well aware of the fact that a
local lumber yard at Rushville, Nebraska, the Rushville
Lumber and Coal Company, has provided a considerable amount,
probably at least 50-60% of the total lumber used on the
project. He said this appeared very logical to him as this yard
is much closer to the project than yards at Rapid City, South
Dakota, and other sizeable South Daota cities, As a result
of their proximity to the project the Rushville Lumber and
Coal Company has definite shipping advantages which in his
opinion would allow this concern to underbid more remotely
located competitors.

DALE stated he has absolutely no financial interest
in the Rushville Lumber and Coal Company and after checking
bank records to be certain advised the bank has absolutely
no loans to this concern.

DALE related he has no information to indicate bids
for lumber that may have been made by the Rushville Lumber
and Coal Company are handled in any fashion or in any way
different from the handling of the many types bids accepted
for the multitude of different items used on the project.

ROY CURTISS advised he is principal stockholder,
Secretary-Treasurer and the active manager of the Rushville
Lumber and Goal Company at Rushville, Nebraska,

CURTISS was informed certain allegations had been
made relative to the volume of material his company had provided
for the constraction of a number of private homes and an old
folks unit under the Public Housing Authority (PHA) at Pine
Ridge, South Dakota. He was further advised that allegations
had been made indicating his company might possibly have been
provided preferential treatment in bidding and might have been
given advance information relative to the bids submitted by
competing bidders.

CURTISS was further informed he did not have to make
any statement; that any statement he might make could be used
against him in court,and.that he was entitled to the services |
of an attorney if he so desired.

CURTISS was also advised that since this investigation
involved possible fraud against’ the U. S. Government, interviewing
agent had the authority to question him under oath if he was
agreeable, CURTISS advised he could not understand how such
allegations could be made, that he and his firm were entinely
innocent of any wrongdoing and he stated he desired to cooperate
fully. ,

CURTISS was placed under oath by SA ROBERT D. KINSEY.

CURTISS advised he personally had handled virtually
all business associated with the public housing being
constructed at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, Pine Ridge,
South Dakota, In particular, CURTISS advissl he had handled ail
the bids submitted for materials furnished by his company for
this job.

CURTISS stated he would hear of the items up for bids
through regular channels and if interested he would secure the
necessary bid forms which listed the material to be furnished
along with the specifications.

CURTISS said he would then figure out his bid and
submit it through normal channels.

CURTISS emphatically stated neither CHARLES
HEINTIZELMAN, who he knows as the Inspectr for the Public
Housing Administration, nor anyone else has ever given him
any information as to the amounts of the bids submitted by
any other firm and neither has he or his company ever been
made an offer by anyone to help his company get any contracts
on the Pine Ridge project in any way other than through normal
and legitimate business procedures.

CURTISS volunteered that his company has: served the
Pine Ridge Reservation,which is only a little over twenty miles
from Rushville, Nebraska, for years and has a truck which makes
daily deliveries to the area, He noted he was in a much better
position to serve the project on the basis of a favorable
position as far as shipping charges were concerned and he could

normally be expected to be able to underbid suppliers from a

greater distance from the project, i |

He also advised that in 1962 before the administrative

controls were completely set up on the project he was able to
supply a considerable amount of material which was needed
immediately and could be purchased locally without the letting
of bids, He said his company would realize its normal margin
of profit on such sales, but since 1963 almost all items have
been supplied to the project under sealed bids and to supply
such material it is necessary for him to bid on a very small
profit margin. a

CURTISS further advised he considers CHARLES ~.
HEINTZELMAN as doing an excellent job on the project and in
protecting the interests of the Sioux Indians and the U. 8S. ~.

Government. ee

CURTISS stated ALBERT DALE, President of the
Stockmen's National Bank, Rushville, Nebraska, owns no stock
ih his company and his company has no loans with the Stockmen's
National Bank.

EDWARD ARNOLDS, Assistant Regional Attorney, Public
Housing Administration (PHA), Regional Office, 185 North Wabash
Avenue, Chicago, Illinois, furnished the following information:

The Pine Ridge, South Dakota, Indian reservation
housing project was developed and constructed in accordance
with the Housing Act under which a legally constituted
housing authority applies toe the PHA for approval of
development and financing of a low rent housing project.

PHA enters into a preliminary loan contract whereby PHA
advances funds to the local housing authority to do
preliminary planning to determine the need for and feasibility
of low rent housing. When the project has been approved
PHA enters into an Annual Contributions Contract with the
local housing authority covering the full estimated cost of
the project whereby it agrees to loan money to the local
housing authority to construct the project and under which
disbursements are made to the local housing authority as
needed =~ generally the estimated funds needed for a three
month period. The local housing authority signs an open-end
note for the full estimated cost of the project, and is legally
| @llowed to borrow up to 90% of such total estimated cost.
| As advances are made to the local housing authority, the amounts
thereof are endorsed on the said notes. After the project
' is under way, the local housing authority issues temporary
i notes to finance the construction which are sold to
i private investors, usually banks, and the proceeds of which are
used in part to repay PHA advances to that time. The temporary
notes are generally in an amount to cover funds needed for a six
i month period and as of the date of issuance total the amount of
advances made to that time by PHA and the additional funds\which
| it is estimated will be required for the ensuing six months.
Financing during the construction period is continued by the
issuance of temporary notes, generally for six month periods,
however, should additional funds be needed prior to maturity of
such notes, PHA can and will advance additional funds to the local
housing authority, which again upon issuance of a new series of tem-
porary notes, will be repaid.

When the project is substantially completed,
permanent financing is arranged, which consists of bonds
issued by the local housing authaity. These bonds are
serial bonds, which mature over a period of 40 years and
PHA guarantees the principal and interest to the extent
provided for in the Annual Contributions Contract. These
bonds are sold to private investors, The bond indenture
provides for a fixed annual payment which will liquidate
the total obligation over a period of 40 years. Under
its contract with the local housing authority, PHA is
obligated to make up the portion of the annual payment
which the local housing authority does not have funds to
meet from its operations, This payment is limited under
the contract to a certain amount, however, in practice it
is usually sufficient to liquidate 100 per cent of the cost
of the project if required.

With regard to the Pine Ridge, South Dakota,
Indian reservation housing project, PHA was approached by
a Washington, D. C. law firm representing the Indian tribe
to determine whether it could qualify for low rent housing.
It was informed that it could by meeting the requirements of
the Housing Act which meant organizing a legally constituted
housing authority, This was done and the Oglala Sioux Housing
Authority (OSHA) became such authority. The preliminary
planning conmract was entered into by PHA with OSHA in
September, 1961, and eventually the project was approved and
an Annual Contributions Contract was entered into in June,
1962. Ths project actually included three projects, two
of which were covered in the initial contract, and the third
added as an amendment to the contract. Advances to finance
initial construction were made by PHA to OSHA beginning in
dune, 1962, and the initial series of temporary notes to
finance contruction were issued by OSHA in about November,
1962, The third and last series of temporary notes matured
January 10, 1964. Permanent financing, consisting of bonds,
has been arranged and the bonds sold and to be delivered
March 3, 1964, As there was a short interval between maturity
of the temporary notes and delivery of the bonds representing
permanent financing, PHA advanced sufficient funds to pay off
the principal and interest of the temporary notes which matured
on January 10, 1964. This amounted to $1,576,613.71.
Accordingly, OSHA is indebted to PHA at the present time in that
amount plus interest on the said amount from January 10, 1964,
at 3 7/8 per cent. This indebtedness will be liquidated upon
delivery of the bonds constituting the permanent financing on
March 8, 1964. These bonds will total $1,690,000 and the fixed
annual payment will amount to $79,230.

Mr. ARNOLDS stated that there was no running record
of advances, etc., maintained in the Chicago Regional Office
and that a complete record of advances, issuance of temporary notes,
etc., regarding the financing of the Pine Ridge, South Dakota
projects could best be obtained from the Fiscal Branch of PHA,
Washington, D. C.

. Mr. ARNOLDS made available the finance file relating
to the. Pine Ridge project, which reflected the following:

A copy of a letter dated May 24, 1962, from THOMAS D,
THOMPSON, Development Division, to MARIE C, HC GUIRE, Commissioner,
captioned "Use of Force Account - Project SD-1-1, Pine Ridge",
bearing stamped approval of MARIE C, MC GUIRE dated June 16, 1962,
This letter constituted approval to waive provisions of Section
107 (D) of Part If of the Annual Contributions Contract to extent
necessary to permit project SDP~1l-1, Pine Ridge, to be built by
the force account method. This method was explained as one
whereby Tribal Authority will utilize the available labor force and
direct the construction work themselves,

A copy of consolidated Annual Contributions Contract
Number C-354 reflected that this contract was entered into on
June 7, 1962, by the PHA and OSHA, a body corporate and politic
organized and existing under the laws of the Oglala Sioux Tribe
of the Pine Ridge Reservation. It specified that the local
housing authority was undertaking development and operation of
low rent housing as defined in the U. S. Housing Act of 1937,
as amended,as follows:

Project SD-1-3 was added to the contract by
Amendment #1 dated February 28, 1963.

Section 1, Paragraph (D), states that the U.
8. Government has approved the making of the contract and the
undertaking by the PHA of the loan and annual contributions as
provided in the contract and on PHA List Number 2088, 2098
and 2526, "Y

to project SD-1-2, and PHA List Number 2526 dated February 26,
1983, relating to project SD~l1-3, reflecting the following
pertinent data:

- Section-7 of the contract provides that PHA shall
lend the local housing authority amounts as detemined pursuant
to Section 410, and Section 8 provides for the making of
annual contributions by PHA to the local housing authority.
The contract was signed for OSHA by SAMUEL STANDS, Chairman
of OSHA, and was signed for PHA by WILLIAM E. BERGERON,
Director, Chicago Regional Office.

The file contained copies of Advance Notes, all

As indicated, the above described documents were
copies and bore no endorsements of funds advanced under then,

There were copies of several documents contained in
the file of requests for advances submitted by OSHA and copies
of some approvals by the Fiscal Branch of PHA, however, these
did not appear to be complete and as stated by Mr. ARNOLDS, a
complete and reliable record would have to be obtained from
the Fiscal Branch in Washington, D. C.

Copies of these documents did reflect that the intial
advance by PHA to OSHA on the project was made on or about June
14, 1962, The latest and last requisition for funds- by OSHA
was dated October 22, 1963, and related to the advance to be
made by PHA to pay off the temporary notes which matured on
January 10, 1964, and provided for advance totalling $1,576,613.71,
covering all three projects.

It was noted that the tonal estimated development cost
for the three projects per the contract was $2,279,708, whereas
Iie. ARNOLDS advised the permanent financing consisting of the
bonds of OSHA totalled $1,690,000. ARNOLDS stated that the
total bond issue represents the total cost for construction
of the three projects and explained that when the permanent
bonds are to be issued a minimum development cost determination
is made and this is used as the total of the bond issue by the
local housing authority. He added that if it develops an
additional amount is needed, which would usually be a small
percentage, PHA can make a direct loan to the local housing
authority. : :

ARNOLDS advised that the project in every case,
specifically in the Pine Ridge project, is constructed
by the.local housing authority, which has titie to all.
materials, etc., relating to the project.

ARNOLDS aiso advised that if irregularities occurred
on the Pine Ridge or any project resulting in an increase in
the total cost of the project, there would be a corresporiding
increase in the U. 8S. Government's annual contribution and,
therefore, the Government would suffer a loss.

HAROLD BROWN, Chief of the Construction Section,
Chicago Regional Office, Public Housing Administration (PHA),
185 North Wabash Avenue, Chicago, Illinois, furnished the
fcllowing information:

The Pine Ridge, South Dakota, Indian Reservation
iow rent housing project is unique and some background is
necessary to an understanding of it. The project originated
with an inquiry to PHA by a Washington, D.C., law firm
vepresenting the Indian tribe, in effect as to whether the
tribe could qualify for low rent housing financing under the
Housing Act. They could qualify through organization of a
legally constituted housing authority and did so ‘by forming
the Oglala Sioux Housing Authority (OSHA).

Development plans were submitted to PHA which were
based on some dwelling units constructed on the Reservation
about a year before on contracts let by the Bureau of Indian
Affairs, These dwellings were similar to the type of .
dwellings which are constructed rrmally as low rent housing
under PHA financing. However, the cost of these units were,
as BROWN recalled, about $24,000 each whereas the PHA could
not finance units costing more than about $12,000 or $13,000
under the statutory limitations. The PHA could not approve
the development at the cost proposed, but decided to look
into the matter to determine why the costs were so high. This
was done and it was found that the general contractors’
bids were high primarily because of high labor costs occasioned
by bringing in labor from considerable distances, They had
employed little, if any, Indian labor. : 4

A plan was developed whereby the OSHA would direct
the construction itself, that is, itself perform the
function of general contractor. Under the plan, the labor
force was to consist of Indians working as apprentices
under either Indian or non-Indilan journeymen, whichever
were available. This plan had the dual benefit of providing
employment to the Indians, who were 65 per cent unemployed,
and developing them into skilled workmen, Project plans
were developed envisioning the aforementioned method of

C& 46-3873

of operation, estimated costs were within statutory limits
and the development plans were approved’by PHA.

The type of operation decided upon is termed force
account operation, The Pine Ridge project is unique because
it is the fist and only project constructed on a force account
basis. ALI other projects have been, and are constructed
by general contractors on contracts let by the local
housing authority, Therefore, this was an entirely different
procedure for which PaA had only very broad guide lines.

CHARLES HEINTZELMAN, a traveling construction repre-
sentative working under BROWN's supervision, and who resides
in Minneapolis, Minnesota, was assigned to the Pine Ridge
project. Under normal circumstances, a traveling construction
representative visits each project assigned to him once
each month for about two days for the purpose of determining
that the local housing authority is doing what it should
be doing, that is conducting adequate and proper inspections,
etc. However, because of the unusual circumstances involved
in the Pine Ridge project, namely, the force account operation
and the almost total unfamiliarity of the OSHA members with
construction, procedures, etc., it was necessary for HEINTZELMAN
to devote almost full time to the project initially, He
spent two to three weeks per month at Pine Ridge “until he
got the ball rolling." The time required dropped gradually
so that at present HEINTZELMAN spends about one week per
month at this project. When Project Number 2 is completed,
it is anticipated that it will only be necessary to visit
this project on the same basis other projects are visited.

HEINTZELMAN's function and duties throughout the
Pine Ridge project have been to act as a guide, counselor,
and advisor on construction, He has no authority to
award contracts, etc. All operating and construction autho-
rity is within the jurisdiction of the OSHA Board. However,
the OSHA Board has undoubtedly followed HEINTZELMAN's recommen-
dations, and he has for all practical purposes supervised
the construction.

There is no review of bids, etc, other than by
OSHA personnel and/or HEINTZELMAN, OSHA is the legal owner
of the materials, etc, and would have authority to dispose
of materials not needed. PHA would not have any record
of such transactions,

NW 68262 Docld:32989685 Page 566 7



CG 46-3873

BROWN commented that he is certain that the OSHA
has complete records because he cautioned HEINTZELMAN from
the start that he should insure that there is widely circulated
and competitive bidding on everything, and that complete
records are maintained "down to every nail used" on the project.

. BROWN mentioned personnel problems encountered by
OSHA on the project. OSHA initially employed a construction
superintendent at $10,000 per year who was dismissed at

about the 75 per cent completion state of Project Number 1

for failure to perform his job. The architect on Project
Number 1 failed to do his job during construction and was
dismissed by OSHA when this project was about 25 per cent
completed, The architect who had designed Project Number 2
quit when that project was at about the 25 per cent completion
Staze because of disagreement regarding design changes,

EVAN LUCAS, the architect on Project Number 8, was engaged

by GSSA to take over on Project Number 2 in addition to his
employment on Project Mwmaber S$. BROWN said that as a result
o2 these personnel problems, the OSHA Board undoubtedly
depended more on HEINTZELUAN than they might have otherwise.
He also pointed out that the architect is charged with the
responsibility of compliance inspection.

There were no detailed inspections of the Pine
Ridge project buildings by PHA personnel other than HEINTZELMAN,
There were visits to the project by PHA officials who
observed the work and made, in effect, a general inspection.
These officials included PHA Commissioner MARIE MC GUIRE,
Chicago Regional Director WILLIAM E, BERGERON, BROWN and
others. BROWN reiterated that the Pine Ridge project is one
in which there is unusual and special interest because it
is the first on an Indian reservation and the first on
which the force account operation has been used. Further,
when the project was being originated, the White House
expressed an interest in it.

BROWN commented that HEINTZELMAN attributes the
allegations of irregularities to two disgruntled individuais
on the reservation, namely, BREWER, who was Executive Director
of the OSHA initially, and a friend of BREWER named HOBART
KEITH, BREWER was dismissed as Executive Director by the

‘

NW 68262 Docld:32989685 Page 567



4
CG 46-3873

OSHA Board on HEINTZELMAN's recommendation as he failed to
perform his duties properly, if at all. KEITH was described
as a disgruntled office seeker who ran for some office in

a tribal election, was defeated, and blames HEINTZELMAN for
his defeat déspite the fact that HEINTZELMAN had nothing to
do with the election,

The financial records of OSHA were set up by
LOUIS ELLISON, an auditor of the Chicago Regional Office,
who has maintained almost continuous contact with the
project record keeping, again an abnormal situation because
of the unusual nature of this project. ELLISON has never
become aware of any irregularities.

BROWN said he has no knowledge of any irregularities
by HEINTZELHAN or anyone else, and considers any allegations
of irregularities by HEINTZELMAN completely unfounded,

He described HEINTZELMAN as an extremely conscientious and
dedicated employee of the highest integrity. He said
HEINTZELMAN has done an outstanding job on the Pine Ridge
project and received a Superior Achievement Award in connection
therewith which was presented to him by PHA Commissioner MARIE
MC GUIRE in Washington, D.C., at a ceremony attended by the
press, Furthermore, BROWN said PHA is proud of the Pine

Ridge project, the dwellings have been constructed at a cost
lower than usual, for example, the cost of Project Number 2
will run twenty per cent under the architect's estimate and
far below bids by general contractors on this project; employ-
ment has been, and is being afforded Indians; many have
learned a trade, and there is now an experienced construction
force on the reservation.

BROWN further commented that general contractors
in the area, at the encouragement and solicitation of the
Builders' Exchange in Rapid City, South Dakota, raised a large
hew and cry when they learned the Pine Ridge project was to
be constructed on a force account basis, These contractors a
complained to Congressmen and Senators that this was un-American,
socialistic, etc. As a result, PHA has had to answer
numerous inquiries from Congressmen and Senators, However,
all of the accusations made related to the fact the construction
was done by the Indians rather than on contract,and there

-10-

CG 46-3873

have been no allegations of irregularities, He :remarked
that because of the protest, PHA had OSHA solicit bids
for construction of Project Number 2 and the result was
that the bids yeceived were much too high so it was
decided to continue with the force account operation
both on Projects Number 2 and Number 3,

ALAN L, WURTZEL. contacted Special Agent JOHN E, MC CARTY
and advised he is with the law firm of Strasser, Spiegelberg,
Fried, Frank, and Kampelman of Washington, D. C. which firm
xvepresents the Oglala Sioux Tribe, and the various agencies of
that tribe, including the Oglala Sioux Housing Authority.

Mr. WURTZEL advised he had helped to draw up the contracts
involved in setting up the Housing Authority, and in obtaining
Public Housing’ Administration assistance in building homes on
the Pine Ridge Reservation,

He stated the Housing Authority had on one occasion
requested his legal opinion as to whether it could sell materials
from the project to local Indians at cost, to aid them in repairing,
improving, or adding to their homes, He stated it is his opinion
that under the Annual Contributions Contract, Section 308, the
Housing Authority does have this right, and he so informed the
Authority. it was his understanding at that time that the
Housing Authority had been selling such materials, and that it
was just checking with him for a legal opinion, He pointed out
there were no restrictions on the sales, and while there may
have been poor administrative practices followed in selling and
collecting for the materials, he is quite sura there is nothing

_more serious than this involved,

Mx, WURTZEL said the architectural firms of Evans
Lucas and Craig and Brooks were dismissed by the Housing Authority,
after the firms had failed to mest the requirements of their
contracts, such as regular inspection of the project. Also the
firms recommended costly materials which were completely out
of line with the type of project planned and the funds available.

He stated the Public Housing Administration stated
it would not put anything further into the project unless a change
was made in the Executive Director, then VINCENT BREWER. This
was because BREWER was very weak in office procedures. As a
result an effort was made to have someone work with BREWER.
BREWER became quite upset and quit his job. He said he knows
BREWER has been quite bitter towards the Public Housing Adminis-
tration, the local Housing Authority, and he himself because
of this, is

WURTZEL said Public Housing Administration auditors
regularly inspect and review the contracts let on the project,
and to date have had no indication of any irregularities involved,

He advised he knows the local Authority did delegate
Mr. HEINTZELMAN the authority to let bids and in general to
build the project, He said he also knows HEINTZELMAN frequently
did discuss proposed changes of any significance with the Authority
members,

He pointed out there has been some dissension about
the project from labor unions and contractors as it is a "Force
Account"t project, However, he said, the project is being completed
with substantially less money than originally planned on,

Mr. WURTZEL stated that from his own knowledge, and
information he has received, he knows HEINTZELMAN has used
materials in the project which are equal to or better than those
called for in the specifications,

He said it appears to him that HEINTZELMAN has done
a very good job under very trying circumstances, and that while
there may be cause for complaint as to office or administrative
procedures and laxity he can not see where there is anything more

the tribal interests, and in his opinion the tribe, and the
government, have not suffered any loss in any way.

ALAN Ly WURTZEL requested Special Agant JOHN E, MC CARTY
contact him at the office of the local Housing Authority, which
was: done,

Mr. WURTZEL advised records of the office reflect the
bids submitted by the Rushville Lumber Company were submitted
within the specified time, There is nothing in the bids requiring
they be opened‘at a specified time or date. He pointed out that
on dimension lumber on SD 1-3, the Rushville Lumber Company
received the bid, being $200 under the next bidder, On nails
the Company was in about the middle of bids submitted, and
did not get the bid. On concrete biocks it was the lowest of
four bidders, and got the bid, On roofing materiais the
Rushville Lumber Company submitted the second lowest bid.
However, the lowest bidder would only deliver in carload lots,
and would not guarantees the price over six months, Because
Rushville Lumber guaranteed the price, and would deliver in quan-
tities desired, the contract was awarded to it. On window welis
it was the second highest out of four bidders, and did not get
‘the contract, On chimney flues it was the only bidder of four
companies contacted, and hence got the bid, On flooring it was
in the middle of three bidders, and did not get the contract.

Hr, WURTZEL exhibited a list of changes, and advised
this list to November 15, 1963 lists each change made in SD 1-2,
These changes were discussed by CHARLES HEINTZELMAN with his
superior in the Public Housing Administration Office in Chicago,
with the architect, and, if major changes, were discussed with
the local Authority members, before the changes were made. He
said he has personally heard HEINTZELHMAN discuss many changes
and proposed actions with either individual Authority members,
or the Authority as a whole at its meetings.

Mr. WURTZEL advised that at a Special Meeting of the
Oglala Sioux Housing Authority on February 19, 1964, the
minutes reflect the following:

“Some of the minutes of previous meetings
were mislaid, In one of these minutes, HENRY BLACK
ELK, Planning Commission, made a request that the
Oglala Sioux Housing Authority sell material at cost
to the people in order to avoid slum districts in

BENRY BLACK ELK, JR. advised he is the Executive
Director of the Oglala Sioux Planning Commission, He was
placed under oath, and furnished the following information:

In connection with his job he is required to try to
get rid of slum areas in Pine Ridge, South Bakota, The only
way he can do this is to have local people remodel and renovate
their homes, or build new ones. He felt they could do this
themselves, if they could obtain materials at cost,

He then went to the Oglala Sioux Housing Authority
early in the spring of 1963. At that time he made the suggestion
to the Housing Authority that it sell materials at cost to
local people to use in fixing up or building their homes.

As he recalls no action was taken on his request in
his presence, and he does not know if any action was ever taken
or not on it.

JAMES RED WING was placed under oath, whereupon he
furnished the following information:

: In about October, 1963, he attended a meeting, as a
representative of the Public Health Service, with the Oglala
Sioux Housing Authority, At that meeting it was agreed the
Tribe would buy bathroom fixtures and supplies from the
Housing Authority, and resell them to local people for their
own use,

He is on the Board of the Old Age Home, SD 1-2, and has
never had any reason to feel there was anything wrong in the
construction of the home,

He and RICHARD WILSON went together, and agreed to
build a plumbing shop of concrete blocks, in Pine Ridge, South
Bakota, WALLY MEANS erected the block building for him, MEANS
obtained about fifty used and discarded blocks from the Housing
Project, which were used in his building. He then purchased
about twenty-two to twenty~three hundred blocks from JOBN MC
GAUHAY, Gordon, Nebraska to be used in erecting the bullding.
We exhibited four cancelled checks which he advised were used
to pay MC GAUHAY for the blocks he purchased,

RED WING said WILSON told him he could get mortar,
sand, etc, from the project to use in their building, but that
he had to keep a list of the materials he obtained, and pay
the Housing Authority for it. He said that as a matter of fact,
they obtained not over ten dollars worth of building materials
from the project.

VINCENTJPREWER was reinterviewed under oath and
furnished the following information:, 1 D

At no time, while he was Executive Director, did he
ever handle the sale of materials from the project to anyone,
other than the one instance when he determined WILSON was
taking cement blocks from the project.

He never attended any meeting at which the Housing
Authority, or anyone else, ever gave him the authority to
dispose of materials from the project. He has no knowledge of
the fact the Authority ever decided to dispose of any materials
from the project. Such an‘arrangement was discussed occasionally,
but as he recalls it was always decided such a practice would
come under the Self Help Program, which had absolutely nothing
to do with the housing project.

| BREWER said he has no knowledge of any agreement between
' Bublic Health Service and the local Housing Authority to allow

' people to buy materials from the housing project for use in

! constructing bathrooms. He pointed out this could have occurred
after he left the office.

He advised he has no idea where the missing minutes
might. be. Aftex June, 1962, YVONNE WILSON kept the minutes,
and he assumes they should be at the project office,

"T,.Walton Means, of Pine Ridge, South Dakota being
first duly sworn upon oath deposes and says tht: I am thirty
nine years old, and I have worked at various kinds of work in
my life, however I spent four years at a trade school learn-
ing to be a bricklayer.

"I was employed on the Oglala Sioux Housing Project
in September 1963 and laid off in December of 1963, I was
hired through an interview with Mr. Heintzelman as a brick-
layer, however, I was never paid over $3.50 an hour and the
scale was $4.00.

“Previous to my termination, Mr. Keith, one of the
Housing Board members, asked me if I had first knowledge of
Mr. Richard Wilson, plumbing supervisor and husband of the
current executive Director, being drunk on the job for several
days, and leaving the job for considerable lengths of time,
making trips to neighboring towns to obtain more booze. I
said I had observed this and he asked me to give him a signed
affidavit, which I did. Later I went to the Housing office to
ask Mr. Heintzelman for a job. Mr. Heintzelman took a very
biligerent attitude, said I noticed you signed a statement
about Wilson, I can't use men like you, and get out of this
office, I told him I resented his attitude and left.

"During my employment, I borrowed $200.00 from the
Stockman's National Bank of Rushville, Nebraska through Mr.
Albert Dale, President of the bank and a member of the Oglala
Sioux Housing Authority Board. On pay day, my Housing Authority
check was retained by Mr. Dale, I did not sign it, or even see
it, but would received a check from the bank for my wages from
which had been deducted the payment.on my loan, and the Housing
Authority check stub, It is my observation that all or practically
all of the workmen borrowed money from the bank through Mr. Dale
at various times. It is my opinion that the status of these
loans influenced the retention on the job.

"The afor mentioned Mr, Richard Wilson, who was
plumbing supervisor for the Housing Authority and whose wis:
is Executive Director, gave myself and Earl Deon Jr, a Saturday
and Sunday job to build a plunbing shop for him, which we

~2-



i o e

MP 46-2614

“proceeded to do. Mr. Wilson instructed us that we should
take the material from the elderly housing job and this had
been cleared with Mr. Heintzelman, We, therefore, took the
building blocks, etcetra from the elderly job, and used them
on Mr. Wilson's plumbing shop. We naturally thought this
was all right, in as much as Mr. Wilson's wife is Executive
Director, Mr.: Wilson agreed to pay us 15¢ a block. We had
a very difficult time getting our mney from Mr. Wilson, and
of course he is the same party that we signed the statement
about, that made Mr, Heintzelman mad at me and refuse to to
re-employ me.

"On the elderly home, when the block work was com-
pleted, I was switched to metal lathing, and put in all the
lath in 22 bathrooms, When this was completed, I applied
for the plastering and tile setting work, but was told that
this work was contracted. I went to the office and asked if
it was contracted, was told that it was, but they would not
let me see the contract without a court order, The Housing
Authority requested two tile setters from the Employment
Office, and the Employment Office gave me a card for one of
these jobs, but when I took it to the man in charge of the
tile setting, he refused to accept me, saying it would cut him
out of work, :

"There are a great many rumors about Oglala Sioux
Housing material being used on private work by those who
are "on the in" with Mr, Heintzelman. The electrician,
for example, concurrently with his work on the elderly housing,
wired the Mormen Church and a private home near White Clay,
Nebraska. It is commonly understood that the material for
these jobs came off the elderly home job. To my knowledge,
Mr. Richard Wilson, plumbing foreman, did several jobs with
material from the Housing project, including the building
which I worked on on Saturdays and Sundays, He showed me a

"Bernard LeBeau, of Pine Ridge, Shannon County,
State of South Dakota being first duly sworn upon oath de-
poses and says that:

"I, Bernard LeBeau was employed as Carpenter Fore-
man for the Oglala Sioux Housing Construction from June 1963
to November 1963 at which time I was injured and spent a
month in the hospital. I returned to work as a carpenter
February 1964 and have been laid off several times from that
date until now. During my employment on several occasions, I
obtained a loan from Stockman's National Bank, Rushville,
Nebraska thru Mr. Albert Dale who is Bank President and also
Treasurer Of the Oglala Sioux Housing Authority. During the
period when I owed the bank, I would not receive my pay check
from the Housing Authority, would not see it and of course
net sign it. It would be cashed by Mr. Bile and I would re-
ceive a check stub from the bank and the banks check for the
balance, When the final payment was made, [ weuld receive
the check stub, the banks check for the balance of my wages
and the note which I"had signed. It is my observation that
all or practically all workmen on the housing project at
times, had loans from Mr. Dale's bank. It is my opinion
that the status of your employment and retention of employ-
ment was influenced by the status of these loans, At the time
I was injured and entered the hospital November 1963, I owed
approximately $400,00to the bank on a note, After my return
to work in February of 1964, there were pay periods in which
Mr. Dale took the entire amount and I never saw my pay check
from the Housing Authority or any other check, When in the
hospital my wife was given $120.00 by the Housing Authority
and it was labeled “advanced payment", Wr. Hentzman at one
time stated that it came out of his own pocket, however, Mr.
Dale took this payment out of my check in addition to his
bank payment and as soon as I finished paying both of these
debts, I was immediately terminated. It is well known I am
a@ qualified skilled carpenter, capable of doing finish and trim
work in addition to all other phases of the trade. On two
occasions after I returned to work and received no check at

"all, and I was told the time was not turned in, One week
it‘involved one day's pay and the other week it involved a
day and a half.

MP 46-2614

"There are many things I do not understand about
- the practices of the Housing Authority, For example, about
July 1963, I, ‘with three other workmen, was sent to build
an addition on a privately built home, The material used
was from the Housing Authority stock pile and I was paid
along with the others by the Housing Authority. I was in-
structed to do this by Mr. Tyler, Superintendent and in
another instance, an addition was built by Housing Authority
nes personnel and material on orders of Mr, Tyler, and I under-
stand Hr, Tyler instructed the man it would cost $1,000.00.
I worked on this job and was paid for my labor with a Housing
Authority check.
