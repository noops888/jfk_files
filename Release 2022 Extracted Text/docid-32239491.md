7 asett:NW 68261 Date:

December 8, 1995

| Status of Document: Postponed in Part

| Number of releases of previously postponed information: 12

| Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors
including: (a) the significant historical interest in the document in question; (b) the
absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United
States or to any individual.

Number of Postponements: 9

Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.

Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could
reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that invasion of
| privacy would be so substantial that it outweighs the public interest.

Substitute Language: SSN

Date of Next Review: 2017
