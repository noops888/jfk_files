MLSCHLLANEOUS - INFORMATION CONCERNING

(ACCOUNTING AND FRAUD SECTION)

For the assistance of the Bureau in evaluating the

information furnished to the Los Angeles Office by the Informant,

described as "CLIP", the following observations are being

set forth:

Informant continually states that his life would

be in critical danger if it ever becomes known that he is

talking to Bureau Agents.

It appears that informant 1s

basically furnishing good Information but is deliberately

furnishing inaccurate details in the hope that 1t will force

the Bureau to conduct investigation to obtain accurate

details and result in making it appear that the original

makest it 10p

Information did not

come from informant.

Examples of this is informant originally stated

AL WEISS is the individual at the Essex House, New York

City, and after he was confronted with the name PHILIP

WEISS, Informant readily acknowledged that PHIL WEISS was

the man he was talking about and then went into specific

details.

The same situation relates to the St. Thomas

Hotel, San Juan, Puerto Rico.

After being told no such hotel

existed in San Juan, Informant readily admitted he did not

recall the name of the hotel but that the hotel is located

on the Island of St. Thomas,

Virgin Islands, and is the

largest hotel on that island.

It should be noted that the above information was

obtained during initial contacts with informant and that this

situation will probably not exist after informant and Bureau

Agents become better acquainted.

To date, other than original contact, informant

has been interviewed in restaurants,

Bucars and public

parks. It seems he appeared mistrustful of Bureau Agents

and showed signs of suspecting the interviews were being

recorded, which he does not want.

He continually says that

Bureau Agents must trust him completely, as 1f he is not

trusted he and Bureau Agents are wasting time. He has made

this statement when asked how he knows about specific

facts, situations and individuals and It 1s becoming apparant

that he is more and more willing to explain how and why he

knows certain information.

It has been pointed out to

Informant that Agents have responsibility to Bureau to

protect Bureau's interests in this matter and informant

acknowledged fact that Bureau Agents have to be concerned

about informant's motives in this matter. He now says his

only motive in talking to Bureau Agents 1s an attempt on

his part to "put HOFFA where he belongs."

On each successive contact, informant appears to

be more and more at ease with Bureau

Agents.

Informant is

being contacted exclusively by SA ALBERT A. HUSTEDT and

SA LOGAN J. LANE.

When asked during the course of the last

personal contact why he did not call the Los Angeles Office

Immediately after his meeting with FRANK MATULA, on 9/8/61, 4,5:

informant said he did not call because ne was afraid such '

a call would have put his life in extreme Jeopardy. He

noted that he could not conceive of any way the situation could

have been handled without putting himself "right in the middle."

Informant said another reason he did not call the

Los angeles office was because he was not sure he could

reach either sA HUsliDi or LAne and that he does not want to discuss

HOFFA matters with any other Agents.

At this point informant

said that he never wants to be contacted by any Agents

other than SA HUSTEDI and LANE and that he will not discuss

HOFFA matters with any other representatives of the government

including the FBI.

Arrangements have been made and Informant

is aware of the fact that he can contact SAs HUSTEDT and LANE

anytime of the day and night.

Informant pointed out that he will be in touch

with SAs HUSTEDT and LANE on numerous occasions in the

future and he is confident similar situations such as the

meeting of MATULA on 9/8/61 will recur in the future.

He based this information on the fact that he 1s continuously

being contacted by Teamster officials and 1s continually

He noted that 1f a similar

situation occurs in the future, he will make every effort

to determine more specific details regarding the incident.

Informant is now self employed and from all appear-

ances is quite busy.

He conducts his business during all

hours of the day and night and because of this fact he 1s

not available for interview at all times. He has said that

In an extreme emergency he will break any appointment he may

have and meet with Bureau Agents.

However, he stressed

the point that an extreme emergency must exist for such a

situation.

Practically all contacts with the informant have

time limits on them because of business commitments of the

informant. Informant 18 a well known figure in the Los

Angeles area and as a result caution must be exercised in

meeting with informant.

Informant has telephonically contacted SA HUSTEDT

on a daily basis since the date of the last personal contact

(9/13/61) and a personal contact is scheduled during the

evening of this date.

There 1s no question that this Informant has a

wealth of information on HOFFA matters and on numerous

other subjects on which the Bureau has an Interest. It

is obvious that informant does not readily recall incidents

and individuals without some prodding. To date Agents have

been reluctant to ask specific questions of informant for

To the mont ove

has been a primary concern as informant's motives in talking

to Bureau Agents are not completely understood.

Since some

of the information furnished by informant has been verified

through investigation and file reviews, and none of the

information furnished has been basically disproved, this

question does not appear to pose the problem in talking to

Informant that it did in the past.

Agents are now of

opinion, to a certain degree, situations can be discussed

freely with Informant. Of course, Investigative techniques,
