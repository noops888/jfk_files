citizenship. According to BANKER's recollection, this occured

In 1953.

Dr. LAZO compiled a formidable file on the Subjoct

and was In cormunication with a Washington, D.C. legal firm,

which BARKER dimly recalls as that of Edward Bennatt WILLIAlS,

who was to handle the case locally: A private bill is intro

duced in the 83rd Congress by Congressman WILLIAHS of New Jersey

to restora the Subject's citizenship, but BARKIll does not know

Why no action was taken on the bill. At the tine, he was in

financial difficulties and took a job as a tracir driver out

side Havana for about & months, in which period he had ro contact

with Dr. LiZO, who, as BARKER belloves, interpreted his failure

to appear in the office as a lack of interest in pressing the case

to a successiul conclusion.

very longthy and documented file on his background, including hit

miltary record and awards from the Army Air Corps. Currently,

U.S, about a month ago and 10 now in the Washington area; he

OS belloves Jim NOMAls in contact with him. He knows Dr. IAZO 18

Candliar with all details of his case and could confirm the

Identity of the Washington attorney. who handled the l1tigation

locally.

Ington on one occasion, and Bennet WILLIAMS vas the nano ise
