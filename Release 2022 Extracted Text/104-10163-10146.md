Citizenship. According to BARKER's recollection, this occured
} in 1953. Dr. LAZO compiled a formidable file on the Subject
3 and was in communication with a Washington, D.C. lezal firm,
{ which BARKER dimly recalls as that of Edward Bennett WILLIAMS,
7 i who was to handle the.case locally. A private bill ws intro-
H

duced in the 83rd Congress by Congressman WILLIAMS of New Jersey
to restore the Subject's citizenship, but BARKER does not know
why no action was taken on the bill. At the tine, he was in
financial difficulties and took a job as a ractor driver out=
side Havana for about 8 months, in which period he had no contact
with Dr. LAZO, who, as BARKER believes, interpreted his failure
to appear in the office as a lack of interest in pressing the case
to a successful conclusion.

: S. BARKER knows that Dr. LAZO and WILLIAMS had compiled ‘a
very lengthy and documented file on his background, including his
military record and awards from the Army Air Corps. Currently,
BARKER is traveling on a Cuban passport and is in the U.S. as an
"SP" paroled to Bernie REICHARDT.

U.S. about a month ago.and is now in the Washington areas he
QS believes Yim jis in contact with him. He knows Dr. LAZO is
‘familiar with Getails of his case and could confirm the
Adentity of the Washington attorney who handled the litdgation
locally. BARKER recalls visiting the attorney's office in Wash-
. dngton on one occasion, and Bennet WILLIAMS was the name he
recalled. He believed the lawyer was involved in the Senator
MoCarthy hearings.

ations are mades ¥
