The CIA's written statement replying io the Committee's

request of February 21, 1978 for an explanation of the

criteria that governed

the opening of a 201 file dur-

ing the years 1958-64 was not responsive to our inquiry

because the CIA's written statement did not focus on the

relevant time period.

Accordingly, I am reneiving our

request of February 21, 1978. In the event that these

were no criteria governing the opening of such fries

during that period, the Conmittee would appreciate

written statement indicating that this was the case.

CIA document $563-810 indicates that there are 37 docu-

ments that should be in lee Harvey Oswald's 201 file

but which are missing fron the file.

Iurthermose, this

äocument also indicates that there should be a machine

listing of these documerts attached as part of document

#553-810, but no such listing appears in the file. The

Select Committee on Assassinations requests that th:

•CIA provide a listing of such documents as well as a

witten explanation of where those doc ments are 10-

cated and

why they co not appear in oswald's 201 file.

Pursuant to my ¿etier of December 27: 1977, I would like

to note that

the document referred to ir this paragraph

is

a classified document.

After having reviewed both the documents contained in

the CIA'S files on Priscilla Johnson Vonillan and the

materials that were independently made available to her

under the Privacy Act, it is apparent

that the files

which were made available to the Comnit.as did not in-

clude HTLINGUAI materials. As the Comistee hes

already requessed ali information contained in your

Files on the individuals wo are the subjects of our

requests, please

review the files that you have pre-

viously made available to us for the purpose of ensui-

ing that ail of the information pertaining to the

individuals invoived nas, in fact,been rovided.

Finally, the Connittee would like to intervicw ali persons

who served as case officers in the Soviet Russian Division of

the CIA's Tokyo istation for the period 1963 thoug february

1954, as well as the Chiefls) of Station and Dacut Chiefs) pe

Station for that period.

ihe Committee requests that the CIA
