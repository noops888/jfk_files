1, Reference ddepatch has just been received, and we would like to

bring you up to date on the above relationship:

&~ Follow up to HEIS 312: During the evening of 4, September,
Golub did not mention his-previous proposal to have Subject of DIR
42521 teach Soviet diplomats English, Subject on one occasion
stated that she was planning to teach English on Finnish TV and
that it looked as if she would have a busy season teaching, Golub
did not pick this up, and the subject was not returned to. The entire
evening was quite uneventful, and it was spent talking about music.
(The Subject of dIR 42521 will be dealt with by separate dispatch.)
Since that evening Golub has only phoned Costille once and this was
on a business matter. ‘Two Americans were in the Soviet Consulate at
the time and were applying for Soviet visas thru Golub, They had pre-
viously been in the American Consulate inguiring about the possibility
of obtaining a Soviet visa in one or two days. Costille advised then
to go directly to Golub and make their request, which they did. Golub
Phoned Costille to state that he would give them their visas as soon
as they made advance Intourist reservations, When they did this, Golub
immediately gave then the visas. Golub's and Costille's paths crossed
once again on 15 September during a Consular Corps lunch, This was a
fairly large gathering and Golub and Costille did not have much opportunity
to talk, However, Costille gave Golub two tickets to the forthcoming
Leonard Bernstein concert in Helsinki, as Golub had previously mentioned
to Costille how much he wanted to go, Golub appeared to be quite grate~
ful for the tickets, and then stated he wanted Costille and Subject of
DIR 42521 to come back to his apartment soon to hear some more good
music, Mr. Johanan Bein of the Israeli was standing near by, and Golub
extended the invitation to him and wife also. No date was set. However,
from 4, September to the present, Golub has not phoned Costille for lunch,
which is a new record for him, as heretofore he has called at least once
a week, He has either been too busy, his interest is waning as far as
Gostille is concerned, or he is, as Headquarters suggests, planning to
turn Costille over to someone else.

be Costille contact with Viktor ZGAL: If Golub is planniiig to
turn Costille over to someone else, Zegal seems to be the most obvious,
Zegal has had every opportunity to date to start the contact, but he
has not picked up the ball yet. As we have mentioned previously,
Costille met Zegal first at the latter's informal cocktail party. How=
ever, the invitation came through Golub. Zegal was friendly to Costille
but not any more so than to the others at the party, At the second
meeting, a Soviet Embassy sponsored informal reception for the American
Embassy, Zegal was again polite to Costille but showed no undue interest
in him, On 7 September, both Zegal and Costille happened to be at the
same satina party given by a member of the Netherlands! Embassy. During
thie party the conversation turned to music, and Zegal mentioned that
he had a large American record collection but that records in Finland were
too expensive to buy. He asked Costille where he ordered his records end
if Costille would mind ordering some for him. Costille said he would be
glad to, Zegal happened to be at a amall luncheon on 10 September given
again by a member of the Netherland's Embassy. At this time Costille

loaned Zegal two record catalogues from which he could make his selections, °

Costille has heard nothing to date from Zegal on this,

¢. Golub's possible departure from Helsinki: At the Consular
Corps luncheon on 15 September, Golub once again mentioned to Costille
that he would like to be assigned to New York City and even hinted
that he had been offered the job as Consul at the Soviet Consulate in
New York City. It is known that Golub is studying English in Helsinki
from a qualified Russian-English language teacher. He also mentioned
that if assigned to the United States, he would be given intensive
language training in Moscow. Costille also asked hin if his wife had
returned from Moscow as yet, He waved his hand as if in disgust and
stated that it was a pity but she was never coming back, This
estrangement" from his wife has never quite rung true to either Costille
or to AE/5. Shé has never liked the climate in Finland and has been
rather sickly ever since she has.been here. It may be that she is
merely waiting for Golub's return to Moscow rather than move back to
Helsinki. Golub has also mentioned to AE/5 the possibility of his going
to New York and has hinted at his being in Moscow by Decenber.

a, Golub cfmatts with AE/5: Golub has been seeing AE/5 about once
a week for their language lesson. AE/5 is learning Russian, and Golub
English. (Golub also has a professional English teacher.) During these
sessions Golub has not once returned to his‘ conversations of 23 July in
which he derided Americans or has he made any implications that AE/5
might be reporting on her contacts with him. 4AE/5 stated that since this
date the pressure seems to be off and that Golub has never raised his
suspicions concerning her knowledge of Costille or the fact that the
American Bubassy had become aware of Golub's contact with AE/5. Golub!s
conduct with AE/5 has still been above reproach and not one romantic
overture has been made, Although they still discuss politics, art and
music, Golub stuiéy has made an effort to keep away from extremely con~
troversial topics and hes refrained from making his usual derogatory
comments about capitalism and the U.S, When the relationship first
began, he did not hesitate to bring up these subjects, About three weeks
ago, Golub invited AE/5; Iden A and his wife, who are Fulbrighters here
and good friends of AE/5 from Stanford University; AE/5's roomate
(iden B), Zegal and Nikolay Mekeyev"* for a social evening in Golub!s
apartment, Golub for sometime has wanted to meet Iden A, who is the
son of a famous Finnish government official now living in the States.
Iden A is here doing research on his father's effect on Finnish politics.
The eventing was spent in polite conversation, light drinking and dancing,

2. As far as contact between Costille and AB/5 is concerned, it has been
kept at a minimum since her REDSKIN trip and she reported that she had met
Golub. There are no regularly scheduled meetings, the date and time of the
next meeting being arranged at each previous meeting. Throughout the sumer,
meetings have been held about one in every three or four weeks. They have
been arranged on different nights of the week. On these meetings AE/5 comes
alone to Costille's apartment after 2000 hours. She takes a bus from the
University, which is in the central part of Helsinki, to Costille's, which
is.in a northern suburb. AE/5 also lives in the same suburb about 2 kilometers
from Costille. She, therefore, would take the same bus to Costille's as
she would to her own apartment but would get off two stops later. After the
meetings, which usually last until about 2,00 hours, Costille drives her to
the bus stop nearest her apartment. Costille has never been to her apartment.

sAt no time has any unusual activity been noted outside of Costille's apertment
vor near AE/5's. For emergency contact, AB/5 has been instructed to

Costille at his apartment from a public phone booth mentioning that she has
vmissed him. She never once has identified herself on the phone, After the
phone call, she has proceeded to a pre~designated spot in the same suburban
sarea where Costille meets her with his car. They then proceed to the outskirts
wef town, She is dropped off in the same suburban area. The meetings have
usually lasted approximately 30 minutes. No surveillance has ever been de~
‘tected. This has only been done three or four times. The same procedure is
cused when Gostille wants to see AE/5 before the next scheduled meeting.
sCostille has only phoned AE/5 twice, and this was in late Mey during the
SHEDSKIN debriefings. AE/5 has been with Costille overtly only three times

since AB/5 arrived in Finland last January. The first occasion was in
March at AEPAWNEE/3's apartment. This was the first time Costille met
‘AE/5. A’/3's roommate (another Fulbrighter), and two Finnish students
were there (Subject of OFHA 3811, Para 2, line 2; and Subject of OFHA
3914). The next time was in April when Costille took AE/5 out to dinner
and recruited her for the REDSKIN trip, The third time was at a large
American reception in September for exchange students. Costille
talked with 15/5 for about 5 minutes theres

3. This brings us to the iesue of Golub's motives and intentions re~
garding AE/5. By Golub's actions on 23 July, reported in OFHA 4032, it
seemed that he was on the way to a recruitment pitch. However, since that
date he has eased off the derogatory comments about Americans completely
and seems to be satisfied in his meetings with AB/5 in discussing art, msic
and non-controversial political topics. If he had any suspicions about AE/5
before 23 July, he had not raised them since in his conversations with here
Golub mist realize by this time that an out-and-out cold recruitment pitch to
AE/5 would be futile. Even though liberal minded, AE/5 in their discussions
has been critical of the Soviet system and has strenuously defended capitalism.
If he is attempting to get her involved in a romantic relationship whereby
he could exercise some emotional control, he has moved very slowly. As we
have stressed before, he has not made one romantic overture to her. ‘If he
did, he would be most definitely rebuffed. We do not want to turn this
into a "Dear Abby" letter, but feel that Golub may be suffering from a
father complex. Golub and his wife have been unable to have children, and
he has mentioned that he would desperately like to. Whenever he talks about
this he becames noticeably distressed. Golub appears to be attracted to
‘younger people, This was the case with his former assistant in the Soviet
Consulate here, Mikhail. Lyubimov, who was a young, intelligent, cultured
Soviet. Golub frequently refers to Lyubimov mentioning how much he liked
him, what good friends they were, and how mich he misses him, Golubts
attraction to AE/5 started when Iyubimov left. So given what we know about
Golub's personality, we do not think it too strange that he "likes her for
her mind." We admit that if Golub had the opportunity he would c

attempt a recruitment or some other form of eubarrassnent; but we alo believe
that his feelings are such toward AE/5 that he would continue seeing AE/5
long after his operational interest had died down. We have not forgotten
the fact that Golub is a shrewd intelligence operator. From the outset of
the AE/5-Golub contact, we instructed her to use extreme caution, that Golub
was more than a Consul, and that behind this friendly and gregarious nature,
there was a calculating, diabolical individual, and that she should at all
costs avoid letting herself be put in the position where she would be sus~
ceptible to any form of blackmail. She was told that above all she should
do nothing to indicate to Golub any contact with any American official.
Because of this we have refrained from giving AE/5 any "requirements" to
elicit from Golub believing that personality data would just come out
naturally. We have never given AE/5 any canned responses to political
questions that Golub might raise feeling that she was clever and well-read
enough to answer on her own. We did not want to give Golub eny impression
that she was being briefed on what to say and to cask.

4. In answer to para 3 of reference, Costille has never been to AB/5's
apartment and has never met her roommate, Identity B, Identity B wae an
exchange student in the United States during the 1957-58 academic year.
Although AE/5 did not know the roommate before, the arrangements for sharing
the apartment were made before AE/5 came to Helsinki, AE/5 in the fall of
1958 met another Finnish exchange student at Stanford who was a friend of
Identity B and put AE/5 in touch with Identity B, Identity B did not meet
Golub until the evening described in para l.d. above. AE/5 stated that
Iden B is very anti-Russian as she was born in what is now Soviet Karelia
and was forced to leave her home during the war. She has told AE/5 that if
she was ever seen out in the company of a Soviet she would automatically lose
many of her Finnish friends. She has often cautioned AK/5 about being seen
out in the company of a Soviet diplomat too much. Identity B was extrenely
reluctant to attend the social function in Golub's apartment, but finally

consented to go when she heard other Americans were going to be there. She
admitted that she was curious to meet Golub also. There are no Station or
HBFINCH traces on Identity B.

5. We agree with Headquarters that we do not have much to be gained
from the continmation of this contact. Our dossier is pretty well filled
with bio data on Golub as it is, and if he wishes to defect, which we doubt
considerably, he won't need her help. However, we feel that to have AE/5
completely pull a reversal and stop the contact would only arouse his
suspicions that she may be receiving instructions from some outside source,
Since Golub now has stopped his original provocative tone toward AK/5 and
the Soviet interest in Costille has slowed down, at least for the present,
perhaps it would be better for AE/5 to continue seeing Golub, as long as he
does the inviting, until she leaves Helsinki. (Her stipend runs out in
January.) Since school is in full swing her free time will be Mmited, and
she will have more of an excuse to slow down her contact with Golub,
