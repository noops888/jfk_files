S: I've been with them ever since.
B:. And, where were you during the 1950s, so far as the

Agency was concerned?

St I started in Korea, I was in Korea for three years.
I then spent’ five years in-~a short time in iGuagein

Group on Cuba,

B: And who was your superior in that group?

Ss: Bill Harvey was in charge of the group at that time.

B: Was there anyone else in the Agency in a supervisory
position that you had contact with, besides Bill
Harvey?

Ss Seymour Bolton was part of the group and part of the

--on the psychological political | action part of the
staff, and I was working first with him when I first got in
there, but then after Bill Harvey left and Fitzgerald--~Desmond
Fitzgerald took over I became a special assistant for the or-
ganization of the collection of intelligence first and the Le
organization of the military inside Cuba.

Bs Bill Harvey left for Europe around June or so of 1963,

and did you say that Desmond Fitzgérald took over that
position?
"Ss Yes. Later on during that summer sometime during the
summer.
B: . Fitzgerald is now dead?
, St Yes, he is.
B: And, Fitzgerald had a relationship with what was known
as the Special Group or the Special Group (Augmented) ? 2
S: As I understand it, he did, yes. 8

were you aware of the existence of any possible plans’ Q
for the assassination of any Cuban leader? g
8: No, I didn't. i]
w
B: Some time in the latter half of 1963 you stated that
you came in contact with a person who I will calla 2)
contact, who was someone inside Cuba in a position of --a 8
relatively high position in the Cuban government or military,
is that correct? iy
: “oO
S:. Yes, I did. 5
B: And I understand that you first met him in Latin America

on a trip some time in the latter part of 1963, is that
what you said?

S’ Yes, in the Fall, early Fall of '63.

B: Then you subsequently met this contact in Europe?

‘St Yes, I did.

Br On one occasion in Europe, or two occasions in Europe?
S: Probably more than that ~-on three or four occasions--

but at least on two occasions, yes.

B: At that time, could you give by way of background, the

overall situation so far as the Special Group (Augmented)
and your relationship to it? What was the purpose of the Group,
and what were you doing in regard to the Group?

S: I wasn't a party or had any~-attended any of the meet-
ings of the Special Group--Special Group Augmented.

My particular task at that time was--that was assigned--parti-

cular task that was assigned to me was to collect intelligence

and to try to organize a group of military officers inside Cuba

who were opposed to the Cuban regime--the Castro regime.

B: And in discussing matters with these people, I assume
you had contact with a number of Cuban exiles, is that
correct?

“S: Not many, but with this one particular fellow I did

because of his--he was one of the few people who could
travel outside of Cuba at that time. .

B: But he was not a Cuban exile. He was a--

S: --not an exile, excuse me. With exiles, at that time,
I didn't have any contact with the exile at that time.

B:

B: With this particular person inside Cuba, I wonder if

you could just summarize the discussions you had with
him at your first meeting, for instance in Latin America what
he said and what you said to the best of your recollection.

S: To the best of my recollection when we first met, my
objective was to attempt to find out what the feelings

were against the Castro regime within Cuba, to try to find

out if there were people opposed still within the regime but

opposed to the regime, and to find out by. name and by position

where these people stood in the regime.

Br And did you get information from him in that regard?

S: Yes, I did.

B: Were there any discussions at this first meeting about
possibly assassinating any Cuban leader?

S: No, there weren't.

Bs All right. Now the next meeting you met with this

contact was in Europe?

NW 53244 DocId:32204780 Page 5


Yes.

st
Br And do you know approximately when that occurred?
S: The month thereafter, it must have been in September
--as best I can recolleat.
B: Of 1963?
Si "63.
B: And what happened at that meeting?
_ St We continued the discussions which we had started in

Latin America, again talking about the personalities
inside, getting into more detail on the organization of a group
inside Cuba which could be used in an internal coup against the
Castro government.

B: In connection with this coup, was there any direct
discussion of--well, I'll have to stop here, we're at
the end of the tape. I'11 continue on the next tape.

(Tape 2)

During the meeting in Europe was there on the first
meeting in Europe, was there any discussion concerning possible
assassination of Castro? .

S: The subject of assassination was never raised by me.

It was never discussed in that context. In discussing
the coup and how a coup would be carried out, the, this parti-
cular contact did raise the possibility and in his mind the
very real possibility that there would be bloodshed, and
that somebody would be killed. Their, or his, opinion was
that to even get the internal revolt, a coup, underway that
the leadership-~the top leadership--would have to be neutralized.
Specific assassination of any of the people, it was not discussed
in those--in those particular terms.

AaWdGIT Gaod *u GTWYaD. AHL WOYd AdODOLOHA

B: I think during your interview you mentioned that you

said in substance that it is often in coups a natural
outgrowth that the leadership would be, you Said, ‘neutralized
or perhaps die as a result-of a coup.

S: Yes. This was a position that he maintained, although
we were not willing to talk about this or to discuss
anything in conjunction with assassination or with the elimina-
tion’of the leadership. We would have preferred, I presume, So
to have seen a bloodless coup, but in his, certainly in his
estimation this was not going to be possible and we must-~-he

NY 53244 Docld:32204780 Page 6


-§-

felt that he should be prepared and that the group inside
should be prepared to spill blood if this is what--if this
is the way it went.

B: Now, at the first meeting in Europe that you had, did
he make any specific requests of you?
S: Yes, he did.
Br . What were those requests?
S: He questioned the sincerity and the resolve and serious-

ness of the U.S. Government to follow through with this
type of operation. He requested a meeting with a policy--a
high level policymaker ‘in Washington, specifically mentioning
Robert Kennedy as one of the people who, with whom he would
like: to talk, to ensure, to get some assurance that Washington
was serious about proceeding with this type of an operation.

B: Did he make any other requests?

S: That they would need some help in-~in arms probably--
in getting started, in kicking off the coup. He felt

that once that happened they would-~a small amounts of arms

because they felt that they could capture sufficient arms to
carry on once they started.

B: Did he mention any particular kinds of arms?

High-powered rifles and scopes and---

B: Then what did you say to that request of his?

S: I said that I was not authorized to--to approve such
. a request, and that I would certainly pass his thoughts
and his request on to Washington.

Br Did you do that?

S: Yes, I did.

B: And who did you talk to?

S:- To Desmond Fitzgerald.

B: And what did Fitzgerald say or do?

S: I. don't know what he--what he did, as to who he talked

to or who he saw because I wasn't with him when he--

when he--when that--when he did that. I do know that in about -

a month--about a month after that, this particular contact was
Preparing and was ready to go back to Cuba. We had to move

-g-

rather fast and talk to him if he was going to do that. or
if he was going to make up his mind to defect md to stay away
~-not to return to Cuba. The answer that I got from Fitz—
gerald was that he would go to Europe as a representative of
the Administration to present the policy assurances to this
particular contact.

B: Do you know whether or not Fitzgerald ever contacted
anyone in the Administration on this?

No. I don't know, I would presume that this was
cleared. .

But do you know if it was cleared inside the Agency
or inside the Administration, or both.

S: I don't know. I did not attend any of those meetings
with Fitzgerald with anybody within the Agency or
within the Administraton.

B: You mentioned that Fitzgerald did have a social rela~
’ tionship with Robert Kennedy. Is that correct?

S: Well, again, to the best of my knowledge he had a
personal--I wouldn't call it a social--but there was

certainly, I would think, a I understood--there was a personal

relationship, in addition to the official relationship.

B: Had you ever been in Fitzgerald's office when. he
directly called Robert Kennedy?

+St Well, as I told you during the interview, at one time
on a particular paper that was being prepared for:
the Special Group (Augmented) there was a question as to whether

the paper had been requested and was still needed by Robert
Kennedy. At which time Mr. Fitzgerald made a direct call to

Robert Kennedy to ascertain if this particular paper was still
required and received the answer directly from him.

xaWdGIT quod *Y GIwago FHL woud AdODOLOHA

B. Now, Fitzgerald did go to Europe, is that carrect?
_S: He did.

B: | Were you with him at all, or not?

S: Yes, I was.

B: Were you with him when he met with the contact in Europe?
S: Yes, I served as an interpreter.

NW 53244 Docld:32204780 Page 8 : -

And what was said in that conversation by Fitegerald
and this contact and yourself, if you can remember.

Ss To the best of my recollection, it was Fitzgerald
assured him that the Government--that the U.S. Govern-
ment was serious about this operation, that the policy assurance
that he was looking for was given to him by Fitzgerald. Fitz-
gerald also informed the contact that the U.S. Government was
prepared to support the coup and that when they launched the
coup as soon as they established themselves in any reasonable
manner inside Cuba that the U.S. Government would support them.

B: Do you know what the contact said if .you can
remember?
S: He appeared, as I recall again, he appeared satisfied

with the answer, with the assurance that he received.
He accepted Fitzgerald, although using an alias, as a repre-
sentative, as a high level U.S. Government representative
talking for the policy level of the Government.

B: Did Fitzgerald use an alias or was the contact the one
who used the alias?

Si Fitzgerald used an alias. He did not use--he did not
use, he was not introduced to him in true name. Neither

was I known to him in true name.

KaVaGIT God *a GIWYRO aHL HOY AdODOLOHA

B: Any other remembrance you might have of that conversation?
S: An insistence on the part of the contact that’ --
B: (buzz) Go ahead, we have another half-minute.
St they not be left in the lurch, that they--that the
U.S. Government follow through on the operation as
discussed.
(Tape 3) p i
Le Now after the meeting with Fitzgerald and the contact
did you have another meeting with the contact in
Europe?
pis Yes I did.
B: Do you know about when this occurred?

MW 53244 Docld:32204780 Page 9


Ss: It must have been a few weeks after the - that
contact or a month after that. But, precisely

no. I had a meeting before he, before Fitzgerald left

Europe with him to ask him if he was satisfied with the

policy assurances that had been given to them, and he was

-adding the qualifier provided you really mean what you said

of giving us the full and complete support that we require.

I then met him again in later November 20 .., well it was

a different date there because of the time change, but it

was approximately 22 November.. :

B: November 22, 1963?
S: Yes, with a date change - with a time change, it
was in. late November. Yes, yes it was.
B: Now that was November 22, 1963?
LS: November 22, 1963, yes it was.
B: Now, can you give some background on that meeting

as to what the background was as to what conversa-
tions took place and then relate what did take place at
that meeting?

S: Yes, the contact, as with the policy meeting that
. he had requested before, had always questioned as
to whether the U.S. Government was serious about entering
into this type of an operation and it questioned the
resolve of the U.S. Government to follow through with the
operation. He also talked about the support that they
would require, and the need for something to protect him-
self in case he was, in case there was a leak in the
operation once it was organized inside Cuba and he was
confronted by Castro. He had in mind some type of esoteric
gadget with which he would be able to defend himself if
this confrontation came about and it was in such a sur-
rounding in which he was not personally armed.

B: By gadget, what kind of a gadget do you mean?

8: He never specifically came around to it. He had

in mind some sort of a:pellet pen or anything that
was not a hand weapon that he could carry with him to, into
such a conference.

B: "He had made that request before the November 22
meeting?

NW 53244 DocId:32204780 Page 10


=LU-

8: He had but we had never pursued such a line because
of our insistance in not discussing in any way the
elimination of the leadership.

B: But, was anything undertaken to be developed inside
The Agency in response to the request of this
contact?

Su No, it wasn't up until that time and we had not, this

is one of the subjects on which he thought, as we
mentioned before during the interview, that somebody was
bound to be hurt in this type of an attempt and that if he
was going to give up his life, if it came to that, he wanted
to take somebody else along with him. He did not want shall
we say die in vain and wanted to be.prepared to be able to
this.

B: And so what did the Agency do in response to that
request?
S: The request was made,the request was reported, to

the Agency. Again, this became one of those points
as with the policy question of trust, of whether we were
serious about the operation. So it was decided that again
we would not in any way become directly involved in such an
operation but to show that there was resolvej, that we were
serious about the operation and also that we were concerned
with his life and the danger he was going to undertake, it
was decided to show him and to take a pen which had been,
a syringe needle had been inserted into the pen and to give
him an idea as to what, if he decided that he needed some-
thing like this that he could then, with a syringe, and
Blackleaf 40 was mentioned to him as something he could get
inside, which again we would not in any way become involved
in providing for him that something like this could be
rigged by him and any substance Of this type could be used.
But he was, when he was informed definitively that we would
not provide him with any type weapon or pellet or anything
else, he said the least we could do if we were concerned
with his security is to give him some idea as to what he
could do to defend himself and if necessary take the life
of the other person if it came to that.

B: This was a ballpoint pen that had been developed

which had a hypodermic needle inside when you
pushed the lever the needle came out and you could inject
poison in someone, is that correct?

S: Yes, this was not something that, this was something
that was developed just after this request.
B: And did you ever deliver pen to him, this contact?
Sit) No, I didn't. I showéd it to him and he didn't
think too much of this idea.
B: When did you show it to-him? On this November 22
meeting? .
S: This was at this November meeting, yes. He didn't : —)
think too much of it because of the close proximity 4
with which he would have to get to a person if anything 8
developed in the form of a confrontation with him. iB

B: So what did he ask for instead? Ke
ig He was told, and I was authorized to tell him at Ke]
that time, that a cache of weapons would be put 2
down for him in Cuba. =
a
B: Any other memory that you have of that November 22 o
conversation? Q
S: No, he was not, he was not happy with the fact that :
we continued to refuse to help him on something
that he felt was essential for him and his own safety and ~
for his own protection, but he was satisfied that at least
we were in the help that had been promised to him by his 3
policy contact, that at least we were prepared to put down é
a cache for him of weapons inside Cuba. To the point that
at that time he did state that he was prepared to return to 12}
Cuba. This had also been in question throughout this period i]
of time as to whether he would return or would not return. is
5

B: ¢ As I understand your standard operating procedure

you would much prefer to have a person of that kind
be a contact in place inside the country rather than be an
exile, is that correct?

S: Yes, absolutely. Outside he.would be of very little

use to us either from the intelligence that he can
provide from the aitside or the help he could provide inside
Cuba in developing the internal operation.

W 53244 DocId:32204780 Page 12


B: As I understand it, one of the reasons he wasn't
satisfied with this ballpoint pen arrangement was
that he felt he wanted something that could be used

if he was on one side of the table and Castro was on the

other side of the table, that he would not have to get right
next the man to use it, is'that correct?

Sis) That's right, that's correct.

B: Did you ever have the final authorization to
deliver it to him or was it just something that
you showed him as part of your good faith?

S: No, it was primarily just to show him as part of

* our good faith. As I recall we did not think that
he would be satisfied with this particular idea

but-with this particular implement, which he wasn't. But

at least it was another indication of good faith which he

was demanding.

B: Any other rememberances you have of that November 22
conversation?
S: No, except that he, at that time, stated that he

would return, that he had decided that he would
return and to see what he could do to organize the group
inside Cuba to get an updated reading on these people and
their feelings against the regime and proceed with the
organization we had been talking about.

B: He had orginally been a supporter of the regine in
getting rid of Batista?

S: Yes he had been but he had not been a member of the
26th of July movement but he had been one of the-
a member of-one of the groups that overthrew Batista.

B: But then he became disenchanted with Castro?

S: According to what he said, yes he became dis-

. enchanted with Castro early on in or shortly
thereafter, so it's shortly after Castro took over because
of the policies that were being implemented by Castro and
his government.

B: What policies didn't he like?

MW 53244 Docld:32204780 Page 13

S: The harsh police state policies that were being
carried out.

B: Now, did you have any meetings with him subsequent
to November 22, 1963?

Yes I saw him, I saw him again in late, in late '64
in the fall of '64,

B: In between that time had weapons been delivered to
him?
S: The cache I understand, one or two caches were put

down for him, I did not-I was not a party to putting
down these caches.

B: These were what kinds of weapons?

Ss: I presume the high-powered rifles that were, that
were requested by him.

B: With scopes do you know?

Sz I believe so, I don't know specifically, I didn't

see the caches before before being prepared or
anything like this, but I presume they included the high-
powered weapons with the scopes.

B: -Now, in addition to the caches of weapons was there
any large amounts of cash that was ever paid to him

to the best of your knowledge?

S: Not to the best of my knowledge.

B: Was there any amount of cash relatively small that
was paid to him to the best of your knowledge?
