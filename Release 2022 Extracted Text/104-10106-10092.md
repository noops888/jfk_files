MEMORANDUM FOR: Director 4s
FROM :r Sidney D. Stembridge

Acting Director of Security

VIA : Deputy Director for Operations
Deputy Director for Administration

SUBJECT 2 Yuriy Ivanovich Nosenko
(Payment of Certain Funds
Previously Promised)

“1. This memorandum submits a proposal for your approval
The. proposal is to immediately pay Yuriy Ivanovich Nosenko
$28,500 in back salary in settlement of an _Agenc commitment
to him and to authorize a subsequent one-time payment of $10, 000~
to him ¢irectly or as a contribution to his retirement for...
. identifying a ranking British official William Vassall, as a
» recruited Soviet agent.

2. Yuriy Ivanovich Nosenko is a 48-year-old former
Soviet intelligence officer who is currently loyed as an
independent contractor by this Agency. Mr. Nose ko has for
‘some time been of the opinion that he is entitled to $28,500
“in back pay. .This amount represents the diff ce between
the salary actually paid to him during the 1 rch 1969. to
1 March 1975 period and the $25,000 per year ich was promised
t the time of his defection in February 1964. At the
defection, Mr. eako was also pre ed the addi-
0,000 for identifying William Vassall, ¢ aitish
employee recruited by the KGB.

3. While serving as a KG security officer with the
i t Commission 4 tzerland, Mr. Nosenko

work as an agent in place. On 15 June 1962 Mr: Nosenko.. *,
returned to the Sovict Union where he resumed his duties as.

an intelligence officer with the Second Chief Directorate of
the KGB in Moscow. Mr. Nosenko worked in place in the Sovict
Union until January 1964 when he returned. to Switzerland. “At
that time Mr. Nosenko decided to defect and requested political
asylum in the United States. fea

4. Mr. Nosenko defected in Switzerland on 4 February
1964 and was brought to the United States under Public Law 110
on 11 February 1964. At the time of. his defection, certain
financial commitments were made to Mr. Nosenko, “These. commit-
ments were substantiated in a conversation with him on
7 February 1964 and were documented in a 10 February .1964
memorandum to the Acting Deputy Director. for Plans from
Mr. David E. Murphy, Chief, Soviet Russia Division (SR Division).
This memorandum stated as follows: cat

"First, I assured Subject [Nr. Nosenko] that I.

was satisfied that he was genuine. Based on iaaecteeestecteee terete

this and assuming his continued 'cooperation'
I said we would proceed to. make arrangements
to bring him to the States. Second,-I con-
firmed ovr agreement to pay him $25,000 for
each year in place ($50,000)-plus $10,000 for
his part in the Vassall case and our readiness
to contract for his services at.$25,000 per
year. Third, I explained the polygraph ‘he
would be expected to take as final. proof. of.
his bona fides."

5. Shortly after his arrival in the United States, the
SR Division encountered serious difficulties in attempting to
tablish the bona fides of Mr.-Nosenko. The SR Division con~-
luded that Mr. Nosenko was not what he claimed to be and thus
not a bona fide ector. As noted in paragraph four of
chment A, Mr. Nosenko was held under highly secure conditions
Agency, installation from April 1964 until October 196
Jetober 1967 the primary responsibility for Mr. Nose
sferred from SR Division to the Office of Security,
ected a thorough review of the developments in this
aditions of confinement of Mr. Noseako were progre
ed and in Qctober 1968 the bona f of Mr. Nos

ted that the confinement of Mr. a was cited

Rockefeller Commission Report in June 1975 and that Mr. Nosenko
is aware of this citation. Mr. Nosenko has, however, made no
threats. concerning possible damages as a result. of this con-
finement. Also, despite the difficult period through which

Mr. Nosenko passed, he has been and continues to be a coop-
erative and productive ‘source.

6. Mr. Nosenko has: been of significant value to this
Agency as a source of information on KGB Second Chief
Directorate activities against. U.S. Embassy personnel in
Moscow. Mr. Nosenko named six members of tie ibassy staff
who rejected KGB recruitment overtures during e 1953-1964
period, and all have confirmed his assertion. A physical
search of the Embassy in Moscow'also fully substantiated
information Mr.:Nosenko provided regarding KCB audio surveil-
lance devices in the Embassy. Mr. Nosenko also provided
information leading to the identification of fifty-one American

$ . KGB targets and sixty-one non-American KGB agents. . The most _
me. prominent of these Soviet agents were a i\
ca ambassador to Moscow, a director and a aeputy secretary vie cne ,% “

W Foreign Ministry and a British Admiralty employee,” :
iizam Vassall..-Mr. Nosenko isthe most significant defector
ve have had from the Second Chief Dircctorate of the. KGB, and
“as a ‘result of this his contributions have been of unique
importance. :

7. Prior to 1 March'1969 Mr. Nosenko received.no salary
for his cooperation with this Agency. Effective 1 March 1969
Mr. Nosenko was employed as an independent contractor at the
rate of $16,500 per year. Because of the previous difficulties
and uncertainties involved in establishing the bona fides of
Mr. Nosenko, the extent of our commitments and obligations to
him c not clear at. that time. Mr. Nosenko, therefore, was
initially employed at the rate of $25,000 per year as he
_promised. Mr. Nosenko's salary was increased annually,
atil 1 March 1975 when he began to receive the stipu-
000 per year. Once the bona fides of Mr. Nosenko were
blished and the earlier difficultt regarding hi
‘resolved, the initial commitments took effect and
of $125,000 {le federal income tax) was completed
er 1972 in settlement of salary arrears for the
1964 to March 1969 (see Att t BY). On 12 July
made on the obligation of $50,000 due ‘
id 1962-1964.

$8: There remains to. be paid $28,500: (less~“federal ‘income:
tax) in salary arrears for the period 1 March 1969 to 1 March fy
1975 (see Attachment C) and $10,000. outstanding for the-Vassall
case. (He has never requested the latter amount but the eos
obligation still exists.) Although Mr. Nosenko signed a
quitclaim for the period prior to 12 July 1973 (see Attachment: D)
and may have legally waived his right to back salary prior to
that date, the earlier payment of $125,000 for the period 1964-
1969 recognized our commitment to Mr. Nosenko to honor all
agreaments and established a precedent for paying him the total
salary difference. Ne also believe that we have a moral obli-

gation and that this obligation should be met.

9. This matter is being brought to your attention since:
Mr. Nosenko believes he has a valid claim to cited back salary
for the 1969-1975 period and in connection with the current
transfer of full responsibility for Mr. Nosenko to the Counter-.
intelligence Staff, Directorate of Operations. It is, therefore,
recommended that you approve the expenditure of $28,500 in full
payment of back salary for Mr. Nosenko. for the period 1969-1975.
Of the $28,500, $27,667 can be paid for out of the FY1974 unobli-
gated balance allotted to the Office of Security, with the = es
remainder of $833 being charged to the Office of Security .FY1975:'

, aliecation. ‘

10. It is further requested that approval be granted for
the $10,000 Vassall obligation, which could be paid directly to
Mr. Nosenko at a la date or preferably could be incorporated
into a retirement pr am for him, which is being given consid- -
eration by the Countcrintelligence Staff.. If approved, these
‘transactions would represent a fulfillment of all commitments. to
Mr.’ Nosenko as of this date and would e to Fulfill outstanding
Agency commitments to Mr. Nosenko priory to his transfer to the
Counterintelligence Staff.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence
THROUGH 3 Executive Director-Comptroller

SUBJECT = Retroactive Reimbursement ‘of
“Yuriy Ivenovich Nosenko

.

1, This memorandum suggests action on the part of the
Director of Central Intelligence; this action is contained in
paragraph 9.

2. Mr. Yuriy Ivanovich Nosenko, a 45-year-old, foriner
Staff Officer of the Committee for State Security (KGB) of the
USSR, attended the Institute of International Reletiors, Moscow, — ~
from 1945 to 1956; was affiliated with Russian Naval Intelligence - 7
during the 195i-1953 period; and was an officer with the KGB
from March 1953 until his defection to the Agency in Genev2,
Switzerland, on 4 February 1964, after having worked for GA.
for approximztely two years.

4. In the early debriefing of Mr. Nos
apparent that he was a particularly complex individual. To permit
sensive and prolonged debriefing, arrangements were made to
- accommodate Mr. Nosenko under highly secure conditions at

ISOLATION, where he remained from 1964 to 1967. hese tight
security arrangements were dictatéd,, during the initial phases at
least, by the additional need to provide Mr. Nosenko with
continuing personal protection, since there was the distinct
possibility that he would be targeted for execution if the Soviets
sheuld discover his whereabouts,

5. Since October 1967, the primary responsibility for Mr,
Wosenko has been in the Office of Security, which conducted a
thorough review of prior developments in the case, Mr. Nosenko
was moved to the’ Washington, D.C. area in late 1967, and the
case passed through various stages of phased normalization, as
he was given an increased degree of freedom and independence,
Mr. Nosenko was actually resettled on the economy in April 1969;
he obtained a divorce from his former Soviet spouse in Septe:nber
1969; and he later married an American girl in October 1969,
During the period from October 1967 to April 1969, Mr. Nosenko |
did not receive a salary, but he was provided with a moderate
emount of spending money.

6. As of April 1969, Mr. Nosenko signed a one~year
contractual agreement for $16,500.00, including a clause giving
assistance to him in resettlement expenses in the amount.of
$8,000.00. In Maxch 1970, Mr. Nosenko signed a new contract
fox two years at $18,500.00 per annum. At about this same time

e was provided with certain financial assistance, $20,000.00

fox the down payment on 2 new house, and $5,000.00 for
related household expenses. Mr. Nosenko's contract was

forwarded to the Federal Bureau of Inve
from Mr. Nosenko: He has conducted nui
reviews on Soviet subjects of specific intel: ce interest, and
he has proven himself to be invaluable in oring counterintelli-
gence leads. He recently authored a book which is of interest to
the Agency. In effect, Mr. Nosenko has shown himself to be 2
productive and hard working defector; who is "rehabilitated" and
favorably disposed towards the Agency.

8. In the course of a recent meeting with Mr. Nosenko,
he brought up the subject of his missing sala covering the
period from April 1964 to March 1969. Mx. Nosenko readily
admitted that he is living very well at the present time, but he
is not in @ position to save any money for the future, He also
expressed deep appreciation to the Agency for the financial
assistance which was provided him through the years, and he
considers this to heve cancelled out the original Agency
obligetion of a Jump sum payment in the amount of $50,900.60.
Mr. Nosenko, however, still feels quite strongly that he is
entitled to be reimbursed for the salary which the Agency did
not provide him over a five-year period. He understands, of
course, thet income tax would have to be deducted from this
back salary of $25,000.00 per annum,

9. In summary, the original oral agreement with Mr
Nosenko is fully documented and supports his cleim; his rese
ment since 1967 hes been relatively smooth, with no significant
security problems having developed; and he continues to function
at the present time as a highly productive and useful source of
information on the KGB. In view of these various considerations,
it is requested that this payment of $125,000.00 to Mr. Nosenko
pproved. These fmds would be paid out of unliquidated
Ss applicable to lapsed appropri. so (Fiscal Year 1970
ears--"3i"' Account).
