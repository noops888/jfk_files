This group was sald to be provisional, that all organizations

which subscribed to UR principles were welcome and that others had

already indieated plans to join this unity.

At least 30 eventually

did sid some sources claim varying numbers ranging tc 40. (8) This

study will not include the history of each UR member organization

Inside or in exile fron 1960 to the present.

(For brief descrip-

cions see "Counterrevolutionary iandbook" forwarded wach Urge

6447.)

In general it should be understood that few of these

sember orgenizations were nationally organized, or commanded the

adherence of large numbers of active resistance members.

The 30

November kovement, for instance,

was actually represented by a

small dissident faction only, and the renuine 30 November Movement

did not bocona sifiliated with the UR until formation of the "Junta"

(JNR) In June 1962.

The majority of UR member groups were localized

entities consisting of a few key leaders with personal followings

which varled in Bize,

asgets and effectiveness according to

particular local circumstancos and the group proclivity for

resistance effort.

No. major oppoaltion group: joined the Un

Thus direction of UR was shifting fron the strong

They were further enjoined

to desist from any show of antagonian toward AHBUD-1 (204)

' BRITO and others were sent to training the latter part of

1961.

CAVADA was sent to the JMNAVE area in October to report to

"Hi. Poie.'s" as the contact between KUBARK and Uh, and for

"special

organizations in PBPRIVE. (31) He was not utilized by

considerations undoubtedly contributed to the

development of this situation.

• At one point a nove was made to organize a new apolitical

organization which would träln its menbers to operate in the

underground 14 PBRULEN and engage in extensive sabotage activity.

AMCHEER-1 reported In June 1961 that this group was decidedly anti-

PBPRIE, that 1t was recruiting members from a number of exile

groups but mainly from the Un, and that it would operate without

the knowledge of ODYOKE.

In this connection AMCHCER-1 was

legitimate UR operations in PBRUMEN, _ZAYAS would be given $10,000

(pesos) for delivery via the Italian pouch at the end of October

19610. (201)

Around the end of October Fernando CAVADA was sent from

KUBARK Headquarters to act as liaison contact between the UR and

KUBARK in the JMWAVE area and to undertake other assignments in

connection with unification of exile groups.

Possibly because

discussions had just been held with ZAYAS, and considering his

recently held position as General Coordinator of the UR In PBRUMEN,

no imediate steps were taken at JMWAVE to establish CAVADA as the

liaison 'contact with KUBARK. It was considered eventually that

It concerned their

pamphlets were dropped which contained instructions in guerrilla

warfare and anti-regile: propaganda.

ROJAS spent some of the money

in travel to Nicaragua and other countries, and some was said to have

been used to purchase a small boat for maritime operations: (37;202)

No record of this alleged KUBARK support is avallablo at Juiavi..

ZAYAS seemed to be engaged in toward the end

of 1961, organization of the UR in exile was not one of his pre-

occupations.

Othar UR leaders urged him to establish a nore formal

organization, renew contact on a regular basis with the UR in PBRUKEN,

and attempt to gain all possible recognition and support to build an

effective opposition movement.

Some urged him to hold a formel

neeting of the UR merely to gain an opportunity to register proteste

and subalt their resignation.

Among these were Fernando CAVADA,

Wilfredo BRITO, Aurelio FERNANDEZ, and Luis VEGA. (202) By October

1961 other former nembers of UR and its affiliated organizations:

Opposition to ZAYAS grew

and the first formal UR Plenary Session in FBPRIME was held 27

February 1962.

This meeting produced a document called the

"Reaffirmation of Revolutionary Unity." It was also planned at this

The Information was compiled in a report rritten by

RODRIGUEZ Espade, Mario SEIGLIE, JUAN HUARTE and Pernando CAVADA.

(197)

The survey indicated that many of the UR member groups in

PBRUMEN were either out of comunication, very small, or non-existent.

Ib1s was especially true of the five which TORRIENTE claimed to

represent, though he vas not alone in this respect. (31) It vas

depended on two things: whether or not the General Board was accepted

An annoriacenent and appeal to exile groups was lasued by the new UR

22 March 1962 in Diario lag Americas. (14) This put the UR name be-

fore the exile public once. more, but the appeal was not successful

Irom a recruiting standpoint. From time to time the UR position on

current issues was publicized, such as its declaration re ranson of

the Playa Giron prisoners which HEDINA passed to AMBUD-1 on 14 May

1962: 620)

*Unidad Revolucionaria.., wishes to declare that it does not

agtes in any way with the idea and purposes of the relatives

of the prisoners of Playa Giron, of exchanging them in a shamerul.:

way by Blviny 28 or 62 million dollurs to the tyranny which laughs

At; this tine ridiculing all PBRUMENs." (Translated extract)

with respect to entry into AMbUb, TURRIENTE (basically opposed) held

& meeting at his home on 17 May

1962 at which the UR was to consider

naming a delegate at the invitation of AMBUD]. This invitation was

made during a discussion between TORRIENTE and AMBUD-1 following the

expulsion from AMBUD of Oswaldo SOTO as elegate for the UND (aka:

20th of May Movement).

TORRIENTE wag invited to replace SOTO because

of his position in UND (its actual leador; SOTO was named by

TORRIENTE as nominal leader).

AMBUD-1 took the opportunity to 1n-

VIte UR also to name a delogate to AlBUD. TORRIENTY reported that

no decision was

Such a reply to an appeal for unity from

PBRUMEN to the UR in exile would appear to be somewhat anachronistic

since this group had disassociated itself from the officially re-

established UR some three months before. Preceding the promise to

send cash to the UR in PBRUMEN was the remark "You must realize how

anxious we are to begin being useful to you," which tends to

that ZAYAS, FERNANDEZ

and Co, had not bocn intcrestod. in or had not actively

Memorandum from Alberto FERNANDEZ contained a repetition if the

SANCHEZ April request for exfil of the Military Coordinatur.

It also.:

requested intelligence on uniforms, weapons, ID cards, etc. carried

by the Rebel Army and milltlamen, and confirmation uf reception

The report promised by LOPEZ and MIYARES was sent 28 June 1962.

It stated that no funds had boon embezzled; that they had received

There is no evidence to indicate that RAY has received

confusion since this was actually the short title elected at the

giving a bried history of the l'R, reasons for recently having ex-

The letter included the

following renarks regarding entry into AMBUD: (196)

This reply to AYBUD-l may have been expedited following publication

in Diario Las Americas on 16 September of an appeal to all exiles

by Jose F. RODRIGUEL Espada to join UR in the fight for liberation

Of PBRUVEN. He signed. as Secretary Ceneral.

an announcement of the reorganization of UR in exile based on the

vote of confidence given to Salvador GARCIA Oller by UR In PBRUMEN.

It listed new

officers selected on the basis of stipulations of the

National Executive. In PBRUMEN: that all be former members of the

underground, dedicated and well-qualifled. (156)

JWAVE officers had Initiated operational contact with RODRIGUEZ

Espada on 17 August 1962 to establish the re-organized UR overt

mechanism as cover for compartmented FI and PM operations. (147)

Discussions had previously been held with CAVADA and GARCIA Oller

concerning selection of an Executive Board.

RODRIGUEZ Espada was the

unanimous choice for the post of Secretary General. (148)

The list

of UR officers suggested by. JMWAVE and the idea of combining certain

posts to produce a small, efficient Executive Board proved to be

acceptable to the new Secretary General at the 17 August meeting.

It was pointed out-to RODRIGUEZ Espada that the UR in exile would

function primarily in the field of political action and propaganda;

clandestine activity in support of UR in PBRUMEN and KUTUBE

operations would be sponsored on a compartmented basis by various

KUBARk elements.

While the Secietary General would be informed of

the broad outline of UR clandestine activities, he would not

necessarily know the details. (147)

publicity, in the hope liat-such a nove yould strengthen Augin

and instigato a general unity tendency among exile groups.

this point he indicated that UR would erter AMBUD 1f. necessary, but

that this was only because KUBArK wished it.

(As It developed, the

Espade submitted a paper on his own concept of how AMBUD might

function more effectively. In essence it stated: (147)

The unity appeal das dated 15 September and

appeared in print the folloting day.

The first issue of the

official Ur. organ, Unidad, was published on 10 foverver 1962.

Ono resolve of the new UR was to stop the practice of

the names of its affiliated organizations.

As Mario SEIGLIE polated

out, there seemed to be a competition in the exile community as to

which organization could claim support of the largest number of

exile groups.

The UR wanted no part of this meaningless exercise;

ere to work together in the name of UR. (155) The

Executive Board of the re-organized UR in September 1962 was

reported as follows: (194)

In a report to his C/O on 26 July 1962 GARCIA Oller had described

the leading members of UR to be considered for positions on this new

Executive Board.

He also indicated availability to UR for clandestine

operations of three boats owned by Marcos DIAZ Lanz "because of the...

friendship edsting between us."

In the field of propaganda, he said

that Norman DIAZ of "Radio Reloj" 15 a friend of RODRIGUEZ. Espada;

that Niguel RODRIGUEZ Calllet has many contacts in Diario ias Americas;

and that Fernando CAVADA receives

"all the support he needs" from

the "PBRUMEN Freedom Committee." (47)

other exile organizations subsequently Indicated a desire to

Join the new UR.

Ricardo ALVAREZ Tunon of

"Rescate Libre" Informed

GARCIA Oller in mid-October that he wanted to affiliate with UR and

meke a public announcement of the move. (171)

located in offices at 600 West 136th Street, Apartment 6E, New

York City.

This group was first named Un Rifle (UR), or Un Rifle

cada cubano (UnCC), claiming as 1ts objective to supply a rifle to

every citizen for use in the underground. (165) The UR abbreviation

was probably not intended to be sisleading, but uninformed exiles

Another organization using the name Unidad Revolucionaria

UB was also engaged in propaganda activity, according to

axamples passed to JUWAVE In. June 1962, although such programs were

probably not extensive since they achiured little notoriety:

The vario

ous ideas noted Included counter propaganda which quoted from

goverpment publicatiors and Journals,

then followed with the "truth"

of the situation.

One of these was signed by a PBRUMEN dentists'

aBBOCIAtIOn In UR.

Another program was an appeal to nations having

trade Agreements with PBRUMEN to cease shipping goods to Communist-

dominated nations, reminding exporters what Comnunism has brought to

the people of PBRUMEN.

A mimeographed appeal was circulated among

nembers of the armed forces which asked that they carry on thair

duttas, but ald the resistance by cooperating with the

"Infiltration

forces which exist in all branches of the armed forces."

The mtlitary

were adrised to: discuss their resistance contacts with no one, to aci

normally as an average servicemen since it is realized they must

maintain an income to provide for their fanilies, but to ignore the

"call of the red beast" on D Day and to "ret lost." (95) Another

oxample of UR propaganda was the publication of Cuba Clandestina

(October 1962 issue claimed distribution of 25, 000) by the.

resistance organization of that name and Rescate Libre, Identified

B. Provincial Assets

This portion of the study on UR consists of brief descriptions

or specific assets claived by UR in the various Provinces. (ReinaldoOb

/ QUINTERO (FELIPE) reported to GARCIA Oller on 24 September 1962

that all UR Provincial Coordinators were in place and functioning. (214)

B for Un contacts with guerrilla units, ALVAREZ informed GARCIA

offer In a report of 20 September that he was preparing an assessment:

of the units in Matanzas, Las Villas and Pinar del Rio Provinces.

Commenting on tho difficulty of communicattons with these units,

and UR Inability to supply them ALVAREZ said UR would make no promises

to these contacts unless certain that the requested help could be

provided.

He complained that UR had

atteupted to send money to Oswaldo

intre and other guerrilla units, but that it seldon reaches its

destination in the hills. (191)

for the Provinces of Las Villas, Camaguey and Oriente, in Sept-

ember 1962 the Territorial Coordinator,

was

clained command over "active militarists operating in the hills.'

With the arrest of Natimal Coordinator ALVAREZ IN September, GARCIA

Oller considered it necessary to protect UR contacts below the

Provincial level by appointing new Coordinators for the Provinces.

He advised QUINTERO to do this in a message to UR in November. (183)

Ió Pinar del Rio Provinco

In a report of 14 October 1962 to UR In exile, acting Coordinator

Pedro LOPEZ commented on UR guerrilla strength in Plier del Rio:

1s nothing of importance; there aro some small groups of eight or ten

sen, hidden, who cannot do anything. " (215)

CURRENT OPERATIONAL SLIDIKY

LIDAD REVOLICIONARIA (L'R)

Part I

Organization of Overt Mechanisa

Objectives of JUVAVE in establishing and maintaining contact

with the Executive Conmittee of UR In exile were primarily to

provide a viable cover mechanisa in the fora of an exile resistance

group for the soveral unilateral operaticas in being or projected

which Involve MUBARK assets aithin UR.

A secondary objective vas

to create simultaneously a KUCAGE vehiClo responsive to JuVAVE

direction which rould serve ODYOlE policy needs for the present,

and develop into a political entity of stature in PBRULEN after

the overthrow of ANTHUG to assure the presence of a noderate element

1n the, anticipated struggle between extremists of the right and left.

fore specifically, the UR "umbrella" mechanisa will cover

ictlyitles of varlous JulAVE assets vith minimum possible danger

that operations becone comnon knowledge, or are exploited for

personal political or material gain, or are otherwise interfered

with by other than direct participants. JAMAVE Intends also to

gulde un entry into AlBUD and encourage other exile groups to

follow.

UR successes of any type would thus be shared by AMBUD,

provided conditions are such that they may be publicized.

JINAVE, by supporting UR exploitation of public media, would

bo able to disseminate propaganda themes to PBRUMEN exiles

in PRPRIME,

to latta America,

and occasionally to other areas of the free world.

Buch KICAGE activity would be supplemented as conditions permit by

covert KUCAGE programs in PBRUMEN.

In the political field, 1t 1s

planned to prepare members of UR in exile and in the resistance to

aBsune responsible roles through democratic processes after libera-

tIon of PBRUMEN.

The UR principles are based on the Constitution of

1940.

Its objectives are stated in Attachment A, as interpreted

by UR.

JHWAVE direction of UR exile activity was effected through a

KUBARK developmental asset, Salvador GARCIA Oller, who received

credentials dated 3 July 1962 from UR in PBRUMEN,

with orders to re-

organize its oxli? slement. JMWAVE, through frequent contact with
