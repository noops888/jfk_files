Part 1

Brief Histerical asd Political Background

Tne clandestine resistance movem-at, Uniaad Revolucionaria
(UR), vas foundea in PHKUMEN to Decemuer 19GT by the Yoaders of 27
counterrevolutionary organizations (ur factiuns thereof) to
achieve a cuoraination of resietance activity ta une strong
untty, gain recogattion by FRD (now CRC), and obtain from ODYOKE
the vecpons and support required to overthrow the government.

(2333)

The organizing leadership consisted mainly of former menbers
of the MRR, impatient over inactivity and disillusioned by the
Anability of its National Coordinator to obtain effective support
from ODYOKE after several trips to PBPRIME during 1960, Behind
the planning for the UR based on the unification theory was Rafael
DIAZ Hanscorb (aka: RAFAEL), MRR National Coordinator for
fptelligence, Though advised by Antonio de VARONA in late 1960
that for political reasons the "Frente" (FRO) was not in favor of
ereaticg @ unified resiatance organization, the founders of UR -
proceeded with its formation, convinced of entual recognition,
(5) It was fully intended that 1£ such recognition did not
waterialize, the UR would be forced into a position as a competitor
of the “Frente” but, as they might logically ha felt, with a
chance for predominance owing to UR's broader bi among active
internal resistance groups and the program defined in ighly
acceptable listing of basic principle (184) It was emphasiz:
that the UR was not a political party and that its only goal
to overthrow the Communist dictatorship in PBRULEN and establish
a "real democratic regime." (23) The UR motto ig "DIOS-PATRIA—
LIBERTAD," and it has borrowed the early Christian Byabol Cat).

In addition to DIAZ Hanscomb, the following nuclous of
resistance members was responsible for planning the UR concept,
recruiting member groupa and drafting its bssic principles:

This group was said to be provisional, that all organizations

‘which subscribed to UR principles were welcome and that others had

already indicated plans to join this unity. At least 30 eventually
did and some sources claim varying numbers ranging tc 40, (8) This
study will not include the history of each UR member organization
inside or in exile from 1960 to the present. (Fer brief descrip-
tions see “Counterrevoiutionsry Handbook" forwarded «seb. URGE
6447.) In general it should be understood that”few of ‘these
member organizations were nationally organized, or commanded. the
adherence of large numbers of active resistance members. The 30
November Movement, for instance, was actually represented by a
small dissident faction only, and the genuine 30 November Movement
did not become affiliated with the UR until formation of the "Junta"
(INR) in June 1962, The majority of UR member groups were localized
entities consisting of a few key leaders with personal followings
which varied in size, assets and effectiveness according to
particular local circumstances and the group proclivity for
resistance effort, No. major opposition group joined the UR when ~
it waa founded, but ita own leadership and the varied assets gained
by coordinating the activity of member groups established the UR

as one of the seven major resistance movements in PBRUMEN.

Selected as contact between the UB in PBRUYEN and AUBARK was
UK mational Robert orton GEDDES, representative of Pepsi-Cola
International, who made frequent trips to Miami to visit his
family. (31)

While DIAZ Hanscomb was in PBPRIME, the UR organizing committee
appointed him provisionally as the first General Coordinator of the
UR, with Andres ZAYAS as Civil Coordinator and Maj. Humberto SORI
Marin as Nationa! Military Coordinator, (31) Discussions were held
with the decimated MRR leadership in an attempt to achieve a
complete merger with the UR. A clandestine newspaper was started
(Cruzada, which changed to Unidad Revolucionaria in February 1961)
with a circulation of 20,000 copies every two weeks, Initiated
sy GARCIA Oller, the purpose of the newspaper was to circulate
anti-Communist propaganda. Financial support for the newly
organized UR came from contributions by its leaders, sales of bonds,
and the $20,000 “take from the holdup of the Tropical Brewery,
planned and exccuted. by GARCIA Oller in December 1960, Rafael DIAZ
returned to Habana on 13 February 1961 and reported that he had
received formal assurances of support from ODYOKE. (184) He began
working on a program of action for the UR and the selection of
leaders to form the official National Executive. For reasons of
security and operational effectiveness he rejected the concept of
immediate appointment of an executive comprising all National
Coordinators of UR member organizations. (31) The basic outline
of the administrative structure of UR was as follows: (175)

GENERAL COORDINATOR
[FERRETORIAL COORDINATOR} [CIVIL

COORDINATOR.

element, but are not necessarily a of all operational activity
conducted by other segments of tne organization, Tae Civil
Coordinator, by regulation, succeeds the General Coorainator if
the latter leaves his post for any reason. The operational
assets developed by the UR mechanism outlined above are discussed
in Part III of this Attachment,

Materiel from PBPRIME with which the UR resistance was to
operate first arrived at selected reception pcints in late
February 1961, More clandestine shipments arrived in March and
early April. Marcial ARUFE, National Coordinator for Transport
and Supply, was responsible for reception, distributicn and
cacheing, with frequent cvoperation and advice from GARCIA Oller,
who was able to provide trucks and warehouse facilities as required
until transfer to safer storage on fincas in the vicinity of the
capital. From these caches the equipaent was to be passed to
resistance elements in the Provinces. (31; 184)

By mid-March of 1961 the potential of the UR as an effective
opposition movement in PBRUMEN had grown considerably. Contact
was maintained with member organizations at meetings of their
Coordinators from time to time in Habana. (9) Attempts were made
to organize resistance units in rural areas for an eventual
revolt, (2) It was reported that Robert GEDDES had penetrations
‘in(22 police stations in Habana with the object of gaining control
over them if revolt. or invasion materialized, GEDDES also was
reported to be working on a plan for the capture of northern Las
Villas Province by utilicing contacts among Rebel Army and police
forces with access to arms to seize the G-2 and PSP offices in
every city and town in northern Las Villas prior to an invasion.
He was alleged to have given his word to numerous contacts that
no invasion would occur until the UR had completed its preparatory
work, . (Preparations were incomplete and the UR was surprised by
the timing of the invasion of 17 April). (153) The UR action
program included coordination of uprisings in Pinar del Rio,
Matanzas and Oriente Provinces; sabotage operations throughout
the island; organization of.a rebellion in the PBRUMEN navy; =
and the execution of Operation VACA, which was handled by Wilfredo
H. BRITO and Fernando F, CAVADA. (31) Operational activity and
organized strength were mounting steadily, =

“It was at this time of UR ascendency that an unfortunate
security breach occurred at a meeting in the Biltmore section of
Habana on 18 March 1961. Leading members of UR and MRR (and
of other groups) met to discuss unification of resistance
activity. This was apparently a continuation of discussions
held earlier between UR and MRR concerning an operational merger.
What should have been a clandestine conference between a few
UR ard HRR leaders was expanded until it included over:30==..
leading resistance figures, PBRUMEN security forces learned «
of ths meeting and its location, ordered a surprise raid and
errested approximately 38 participants, (203) Included among
those arrested: National Coordinators Rafael DIAZ Hanscomb and

leader against Satista-and Castro, RODRIGLEZ Espada was a logical
choice to succeed DIAZ Hanscomb as National Coordinator, The two

had collaborated for montks prior to formal estublishaent of UR
in Decesber 1960, (30; 31)

The provisional choice to succeed Rafael DIAZ was Civil
Coordinator Andres ZAYAS. Collation of information from several
sources indicates that the UR National Executive in PBRUMEN on 17
April 1961 consisted of the following: (31; 175; 184; 204; 208)

Jose RODRIGUEZ (PEPE) continued to function with UR, later as

in PBRUMEN). xr Ni Spreport of October 1961 said the state-
ment of CUELLAK'S execution was false; that he is still alive.
(219) _ His present location and status is unknown,

After the disruptive arrests of March and April 1961, UR
activity as a resistance movement was curtailed, but an effort
was made to maintain organizational contacc and communication
channels, Much of the interim leadership and direction came fron
former UR officials in asylum via couriers and dead drops. (26; 184)
Little could be accomplished for months after the invasion, since
many UR members were among thousands arrested throughout the
country. Assessment of UR losses of personnel and equipment
continued, however, and new coordinators were eventually appointed
to positions left vacant by those arrested or in asylum, (103)
The skeletal lerdership mechanism remaining in PBRUMEN needed
direction-from the asylees and it also looked to them for
obtaining external support after their exfil via safeconduct to
PBPRIME, Thus direction of UR was shifting from the strong
movement inside to the leaders in embassies and, finally, to
PEPRIME once its leaders left PBRUMEN. (63) Communications were

maintained continuously between these two (internal and external)
UR elements. (26; 149; 170) |

Owing to his PBPRIME citizenship, first of the UR leaders to
arrive in PBPRIME was Fernando CAVADA in mid-1961, He proceeded
to ZRMETAL, contacted "Bill Billings" and later "Jim Bowdin," In
September i961 he was joined there by BRITO, SANCHEZ, ZAYAS, and
others for discussions and planning on the future of the UR and
the support to be expected from KUBARK. "Cal Hitch" and"Jim
Bowdin" represented KUBARK at talks which took place at ZRHETAL
from, 22-29 September 1961, ZAYAS and SANCHEZ stated the UR had
been reorganized in PBRUMEN and that after receiving certain
training from KUBARK they intended tu return, (204) KUBARK
was committed to support the UR "as needed" in PBRUMEN, but
nothing. was to be done to support UR in exile. The UR leaders
were.advised to join AMBUD to receive support for the organizatio:
in PDPRIME, but this was not made a provision to their receiving
eupport for the PBRUMEN element. (31) They were further enjoined
to desist from any show of antagonism toward AMBUD-1 (204) ©

. : :
BRITO and others were sent to training the latter part of

19€1, CAVADA was sent to the JMWAVE area in October to report to
“Er. Pocess" as the contact between KUBARK and UR, end for “epsecial
assignments" in connection with unification of -counterrevolutionary
. organizations in PBPRIME. (31) He was not utilized by "Kr, Peters"
for weeka after his arrival in the JMWAVE area, According to CAVADA,
both ZAYAS and SANCHEZ weré working with Alberto FERNANDEZ and "were
more intorosted in politics than in returning to PBRUMEN, re= i
eeiving training, and giving assistance to the mombors of the UR

in PBRUMEN, (315 CAVADA was informed he would not act as liaison .~
betweon the UR and KUBARK. bocause he lacked "military knowledge."

ousted as General Coordinator of the UR at a meeting in the JNWAVE
area in March 1962. (8)

The UR in PBRUMEN sutcered further losses in August 1962
(see Part 11) but continues to function as a resistance movement,
with exploitable potential, There are questions regarding its
penetration by G-2 (DSE) agents. Individual leaders of UR now
in PBPRIME claim personal networks of trustworthy followers in
PBRUMEN ready to act if provided the necessary weapons and
support.

Although there is no disunity evident in the UR in PBRUMEN,
the movement in PBPRIME today is experiencing what seems in-
evitably to occur among external groups: bitter factionalisn.
There are two main factions in existence as of January 1963:

RODRIGUEZ Espada with GARCIA Oller, who received
documented authority to represent the PBRUMEN group
in exile; and

+2) the TORRIENTE group, a political conglomeration of
te pocket organizations having little contact with any
> ,* movement in PBRUMEN.

RODRIGUEZ Espada is supported by KUBARK. This UR faction is
attempting to enter AMBUD; it publishes a newspaper; it is
intended to provide an overt umbrella mechanism to cover KUBARK
exploitation of KUCAGE, KUTUBE and PM assets, operationally
Genie and handled unilaterally, (See Attachmeat B for

Hector FEBLES (aka: HORACIO) acted as head of the UR in PBPRIME
and conducted the meetings and lectures, (87) In the latter part
of 1961 Andres ZAYAS, former Acting General Coordinator in PBRUMEN
opted to assume UR leadership in PBPRIME, By his own statements,’
ZAYAS was in PBPRIME only until such time as he rejoined the UR
in PBRUMEN after arranging for support from appropriate ODYOKE
sources, (222) ZAYAS associated with Luis SANCHEZ and Alberto
A FERNANDEZ. He was accused of dealing only with the ML and ignoring
other groups, thus corrupting the UR concept, FEBLES, CAVADA, BRITO
and VEGA all threatened to resign from the UR, (202)

ZAYAS was severely criticized for his tactics in forcibly
seizing from YEGA Moreno the UR bonds which had been entrusted to
VEGA for safe keeping. (31) Alberto FERNANDEZ for a time re-
signed frem the UR with his ARI group, but later rejoined.
JMWAVE.had informed FERNANDEZ after the invasion of April 1961
that contact would be suspended temporarily, but he sought an
interview with KUBARK headquarters contacts (JMATE) “due to
pressure from UR members." He was assured the PBRUMEN cause would
not be. abandoned, and was advised to stand by until re-contacted,
(78) | From a political or administrative viewpoint the UR in
exile in the five months following the invasion was characterized
by indecision, disorientation,frustration and vindictiveness,
ODYOKE policy considerations undoubtedly contributed to the
development of this situation.

. At one point a move was made to organize a new apolitical
organization which would train its members to operate in the
underground in PBRUMEN and engage in extensive sabotage activity.
AMCHEER~-1 reported in June .1961 that this group was decidedly anti-
PBPRIME, that it was recruiting members from a number of exile
groups but mainly from the UR, and that it would cperate without
the knowledge of ODYOKE. In this connection AMCHEER-1 was
introduced to Wilfredo MORALES and Gerardo RODRIGUEZ by Orestes
MARTINEZ for the purpose of recruiting AMCHEER-1 as a Judo and
Karate instructor. (163) No further information on the xesult

of this planning is available,

Several leaders of UR met with KUBARK representatives “Cal
Hitch" and “Jim Bowdin™ at ZRMETAL from 22-29 September 1961
to review the status of UR itn PBRUMEN and arrange for future
operational contacts in PBPRIME. It was reported that the UR
had agreed to cooperate with MRR, certain MRP leaders (e.g., oe
MENDOZA), and other major groups “as advocated by AMCOAX-1."
The discussions appeared to have a good effect on the morale of
those who participated. The contact. report stated no commitments
had been made by KUBARK, but at least one of the UR leaders came
away with the impression that the UR in PBRUMEN would be supported
“as necessary" by KUBARK, but that the exile element could not
be supported. (31) It was recommended that the UR in- exile
become part of AMBUD, not only to receive financial’ support, but
also to strengthen AMBUD. The UR was to make every effort to
"get along with AMBUD-1." Under no circumstances was th. UR to
publicly oppose him, On returning to the JMWAVE area, the UR

commitments: KUBARK was willing to support a UR training program a

no imuediate steps were taken at JMWAVE to establish CAVADA as the

Another activity of SANCHEZ and ZAYAS of operational interest

connection with the clandestine operational group known as Celula

PERUUEN Ambassador to the UK, and Julio GARCERAN. AMBLEAK-1 re-
ported on this group some months later and included Alberto FERNANDEZ

informed him that KUBARK had granted $150,000 to this "Phantom cell"
via ROJAS, who used it to finance three overflights during which
pamphlets were dropped. which contained instructions in guerrilla
warfare and anti-regine: propaganda, ROJAS spent some of the money
in travel to Nicaragua and other countries, and some was said to have
been used to purchase a small boat for maritime operations. (37;202)

His claim accepted in principle, but he and all other
Coordinators in exile were requested to re-establish contact with
their groups in PBRUMEN, advise them of the re-organization of UR
in PBPRIME, and request information on estimated membership figures
and resistance strength, With such information the UR could assess
its over-all capability and organize a program to support the E
internal groups, The information was compiled tn a report written by
RODRIGUEZ Espada, Mario SEIGLIE, Juan HUARTE and Fernando CAVADA,
(197) The survey indicated that many of the UR member groups in
PBRUMEN were either out of communication, very small, or non-existent.
This was especially true of the five which TORRIENTE claimed to 7
represent, though he was not alone in this respect. (31) It was a abst

With the appointment of this General Board, the UR hoped. to begin
functioning effectively, working on a program with political and
paramilitary objectives. Of the appointments listed above, several
were never accepted. SANCHEZ, FEBLES and VEGA refused their positions
and “left the UR." ZAYAS and Alberto FERNANDEZ were at first un-
decided, but later severed their UR connections, The future of UR
depended on two things: whether or not the General Board was accepted
and supported by the whole membership; and whether or not other exile
groups became affiliated with UR, thus increasing its strength.(8) A
list of UR General Board Secretaries circulated in June 1962 showed
only three changes: (22)

An annovacenent and appeal to exile groups was issued by the new UR ~
22 March 1962 in Diario as Americas.(14) This put the UR name be=-
fore the exile public once-more, but the appeal was not successful
from a.recruiting standpoint, From time to time the UR position on
current issues was publicized, such as its declaration re ransom of

the aes Giron prisoners which MEDINA passed to AMBUD-1 on 14 May
1962; (20). He “

"Unidad Revolucionaria .., wishes to declare that it does not
agree in any way with the idea and purposes of the relatives

of the prisecers of Playa Giron, of exchanging them in a shameful .
way by giving 28 or 62 million doliurs to the tyranny which laughs
at, this time ridiculing all PBRUMENs." (Translated extract)

With respect to entry into AMBUD, TORRIENTE- (oasicalty* opposed) held
a meeting at his home on 17 May 1962 at which the UR was to consider
naming a delegate at the invitation of ANQUD-1. This invitation was
made during a discussion between TORRIENTE and AMBUD-1 following the
expulsion from AMBUD of Oswaldo SOTO as delegate for the UND (aka:
20th of May Movement), TORRIENTE was invited to replace SOTO because
of his position in UND (its actual leader; SOTO was named by Hee
TORRIENTE as nominal leader). AMBUD-1 took the opportunity to in-
vite UR also to name a dologate to ANBUD. -TORRIENTE reported that
no decision was reached by UR at the 17 May meeting. (14) TORRIENTE
himsel? wes possibly instrumental in proventing UR entry into AMBUD,
since he did not agroo-with -AMBUD=1 politically, though socially or
personally he has nothig against him. A meeting on 6 June 1962
nels, for the same purposo also ended with no decision being reached.

Contact between UR internal and cxile elements from the Fall of
1961 until the Spring of 1962 was Sporadic, The disorganized National
Executive in PBRUMEN matntained closer contact with a few remaining
asylees than with any external UR group.(8) ZAYAS and SANCHEZ
managed to maintain communication, although not on a routine two-way
basis, Closer collaboration between the resistance and exile UR
be; with the arrival in PBPRIME in March and April 1962 of RODRIGUEZ
Espada and GARCIA Oller. This was primarily due to their personal
familiarity etth successor members of the National Executive.

In an attempt to obtain information on UR Paramtlitary assets
in PBRUMEN, JMWAVE directed Alberto FERNANDEZ in April 1962 to arrange
for exfil of the UR Military Coordinatcr, Candido CURBELO del Sol
(aka: RICARDO). CURBELO also was to bring full details on the.UR
“raval plans;" and the UR in PBRUMEN was ‘to be instructed to cease
contact with YOACRE, for roasons to be explained at the meeting with
ho Military Coordinator, (94) Soap message was sent by SANCHEZ via

‘Antonio COMELLAS Ayala (PRRUMEN mployee of PanAm in Habana who made
‘requent trips to PBPRIME) for delivery to Sergio FUENTEFRIA (aka:
DANIEL), UR General Coordinator in PBRUMEN.(59) JMWAVE had originally
Planned to infiltrate ZAYAS into PBRUMEN to obtain data on the UR status
across the board, but ZAYAS refused the infil assignment and was
terminated shortly thereafter. (223) He had also mis-managed UR -
training teams psychologically and financially, leading to the walk-
out by CID Crespo, MONTERO and others ca. February 1962.(129) Exfil

“of CURBELO did not materialize for reasons known best te the UR in

PBRUMEN. ..He was later arrested and, according to Alberto FERNANDEZ,
was executed in September 1962, (223)

Shortly after his arrival in the JMWAVE area in. April 1962,

Salvador GARCIA Oller was contacted and debriefed by a KUBARK wv

staffer, Prior to his operational recruitment he met RODRIGUEZ

who reacted to these and other reports by appointing Miguel LOPEZ

and Boris KIYARES on 4 June 1962.as “Special Delegates and Investigators"
to report soonest on the current status of UR in exile, with all :

A reply to this letter was written 11 June 1962 by LOPEZ and MIYARES
in which they agreed to undertake the task, but begged for time be-
cause of its sensitivity. Thev reported:

“vesat this time there are well founded possibilities of —

beginning to function properly, with the support of our
friends, overcoming the difficulties which arose in past
months and which today seem feasible of being completely
eliminated."

A memorandum from Alberto FERNANDEZ was included and a-“sum in.

+ cash" was: promised.(123) Such a reply to an appeal for unity from

PBRUMEN to the UR in exile would appear to be somewhat anachronistic
wince thia group had disasscciated itself from the officially re-
tablished UR some three months before, Preceding the promise to
send cash to the UR in PBRUMEN was the remark ‘You must realize how
anxious we are to begin being useful to you," which tends to
corroborate CAVADA's reports.to"Mr, Peters" that ZAYAS, FERNANDEZ

and Co, had not been intcrestod.in or had not actively engaged in
providing effective support to the UR resistance in PBRUMEN. The
memorandum from Alberto FERNANDEZ contained a repetition 4f the ae
SANCHEZ April request for exfil of the Military Coordinaiur. It also
requested intelligence on uniforms, weapons, ID cards, etc. carried
by. the Rebel Army and militiamen, and confirmation vf reception

points, -

The report promised by LOPEZ and MIYARES was sent 28 June 1962.
It stated that no funds had beon embezzled; that they had received
$10,000 pesos twice and had sent them to PBRUMEN; it included a re-
quest that a delegation in exile be appointed by the UR in PBRUMEN, but
that the. writers not be considered for any position as they had to” =”
earn a living and had no time for UR activity.(143) In the following
12 days LOPEZ and MIYARES contacted Alberto FERNANDEZ and their next

in PBRUMEN on 25 June.(127) On 26 June GARCIA informed his C/O

that he planned to ask the UR in PBRUMEN for approval of his intended

use of SOCARRAS and QUINTERO, but that these men would follow his

direction whether or not such approval were received,

cf

GARCIA Oller was instructed to point out that this money was \
for use only in connecticn with establishment of the intelligence i
net, and when he urged that money also be sent fur UR activity he ——WT
was told that other funds ($10,000 pesos) for UR operational use i
would be sent by Alberto FERNANDEZ via LOPEZ and MIYARES. GARCIA
stated this would confuse UR leaders inside, since LOPEZ and MIYARES
were of the “old UR" group, headed by ZAYAS and SANCHEZ, and that..he H
had reported they were no longer connected with KUBARK, but in dis- ‘
favor (which was true). He did not include FERNANDEZ in this group.
(173) Aw it turned out, his fears were unfounded, The UR in PBRUMEN
received the 28 June letter from LOPEZ and in a document dated 3
July 1962 responded by appointing GARCIA Oller as extraordinary
delegate of UR with orders to reorganize the exile element within eee
30 days and report the result to PBRUMEN. Only the hest, most - ane
qualixied and ‘sincerest persons were to be selected for the Executive.
He was further designated UR representative to the Junta Nacional i
Revolucionaria (JNR) in PBPRIME, also effective 3 July. io

that containing the vote of confidence from PBRUMEN to GARCIA Oller
informed .him that the UR National Coordinator, Sergio FUENTEFRIA H 4
(fANIEL), had been deposed for malfeasance in office and was in asylum
in the Uruguayan Embassy; and that ZAYAS and SANCHEZ were dismissed
from the UR for actions contrary to its interest, (127)

GARCIA Oller was actually out of town when these documents from
PBRUMEN arrived, but returned on 18 July and immediately reported
their receipt to his KUBARK C/O. By 25 July he had notified major
exile movements of his position as Delegate Extraordinary, of appoint- sseseere
ment of an Advisory Committee tc execute the reorganization of UR in "|
exile, and of the immediate inefficacy of all former members of the
UR General Board of Directors. He also stated. that the new UR
Dirigentes would be selected tiom Coordinators whose .crgenizaticns were
active in PBRUMEN, or who were personally active in the resistance
prior to their arrival in PBPRIME. (139) :

“Timing of GARCIA Oller's receipt of these documents could not i
have bean more salutary from the standpoint of achieving the aima
of UR in PBRUMEN anent the UR in exile, On 14 July 1962 the Junta” “2°
of Representatives was called into session by TORRIENTE with the object
of expelling the RODRIGUEZ Espada faction from the UR.(31) During this
moeting, Mario SEIGLIE challenged the authenticity of the document
used by TORRIENTE as proof that he was the exile delegats of soveral
UR affiliated organizations, SHIGLIE maintained that TORRIENTE ‘oomia- =|©
legally be considered as representing. only tho UND (20th of Hay),

established in PGRUMEN prior to hia arrost, He clnimod the true

from CCC Coordinator Maria Teresa RODRIGUEZ Valdom (TETE), thon a
recent arrival in the JMWAVE area from PDRUMEN, (107). SEIGLIE further
maintained that TORRIENTE could represent UND only if he were ahta
to prove the oximtence of the u:manization under his diroction, (31)

notice to the exile community on 25 July, shicn in eftect dissolved
the existing UR in PBPRIME, the parli ary exercise by TORRIENTE
was nullified, but it became clear as ti passed that TORRIENTE
was not to be convinced, In a formal se: on called by the “
organized” TOKRIENTE faction of UR on 18 September 1962, this action
was repeatcc for the record and the list of expellees expanded to
include; GARCIA Oller, Eduardo S“TOLONGO, Carlos SUAREZ Melero and
Maria Teresa RODRIGUEZ, (190) .

Commenting on the future of UR in exile and the likelihood of
achieving any real unity, ANDENIM-) reported on 20 July 1962 that
Miguel LOPEZ, Vicente RODRIGUEZ and others would never be “willing to
line up" with GARCIA Oller, RODRIGUEZ Espada “and similar grovp." He
added that if tt were possible to obtain any kind of unity, it would
be difficult to get UR to enter AMBUD, unless the AMBUD position
wore changed considerably and it devoted more attention to
clandestine operations against PBRUMEN, (132)

Continuing his efforts to organize an improved intelligence net
in PBRUMEN GARCIA Oller on 19 July replied to a letter he had re-
ceived from SOTOLONGO who was then in the Panamanian Emb: y, asking
the latter to put "the people operating thc. radio" in touch with
BOCARRAS and QUINTERO, He also advised SOTOLONGO to integrate his
organization (Accion 62) with the UR and assure that it is in touch
with the UR, is they are the ones who are going to receive the :
equipment there in PBRUMEN." SOTOLONGO had asked GARCIA if he could
provide any assistance to Arnoldo MARTINEZ, the guerrilla leader in
Las Villas Province (second cousin to SOTOLONGO). GARCIA referred
Rim to SOCARRAS and QUINTERO for monetary support for MARTINEZ, until
such time as "equipment" could be delivered, (128) :

On 21 July GARCIA Oller wrote to General Coordinator ALVAREZ
(ROBERTO) and the National Executive of UR in PBRUMEN (via diplomatic
pouch) and expressed his gratitude for the vote of confidence they
had given him, He stated the re-organization of the Executive

would begin "next week." He promised to contact Miguel LOPEZ and | -|- =>

Boris miYARES to see if they. w2uld represent UR in Santo Domingo,

“as they're going there," His plans included establishment of UR
deleget:ors in other countries, one purpose of which was to collect
Boncy to augment UR income, Several requests were included’in GARCIA's
letter: to work on establishing radio contact; to send data on maritime
reception points; to send copies of propaganda produced by UR in
PBRUMEN. (133)

The exile community in general, and a number of counterrevolu-
tionary organizations in particular became more restive in July and
August 1962. One result.of the "action complex" which seemed to be
growing was the DRE raid on Habana on 24 August, Possibly owing to
frustration over ODYOKE and ANBUD policy re PBRUMEN, this. tendency
toward independent action for a time iod to moves toward exile unity,
with organized groups recruiting other groups and “calls to unity"
being issued. One meeting of 12 groupe was announced for Sunday,

12 August, at Saint Patrick's Acadomy in the ZRMETAL-aroa; the UR
was listed as one of the organizations participating, (145) Nothing

Another approach to UR was made by UNIR leader Esteban Aquiles
WORRERA, .In late June 1962, UR member Ramon ARECHAVALETA Calvo
had brought MORRERA to meet CAVADA and RODRIGUEZ Espada to discuss
support -for a revolt in PBRUMEN to be attempted without ODYOKE,
KUBARK or AMBUD participation or knowledge, The object was to force
ODYOKE into action after UNIR and others had gained a foothold in
PBRUMEN as a result of the revolt they planned to incite.(49) The UR
leaders declined, but MORRERA returned on 14 August and offered them
leading posts in UNIR, MORRERA told of travels to New York and
Washingtoa, interviews with Congressmen (most impressed by Sen,
SWATHERS), PBRUMEN business leaders (mentioned Julio LOBO), and
his success in obtaining a promise from Carlos MARQUEZ Sterling to
Gome to the JMWAVE area to head an anti~AMBUD organization which MORRE!
would attempt to organize. If the UR leaders did not want to accept
prominent posts in UNIR, MORRERA requested they consider merging UR,
UNIR and other groups into a type of combined organization. (48) To
date, neither of these proposals has materialized,

Late in Auguet former MRP leader Manolo RAY was discussing
formation of a new, strong, revolutionary "unity" group in Puerto
Rico, .He arrived in the JMWAVE area for meetings early in September,
Among organizations allegedly to be included were the. UR, MRR,MRP,.
30 November, MRRC, MAPA and the Huber MATOS group. RAY was reported
to have "an ally in the White House" who had assured him that if
@ purely revolutionary organization were created “it would be heard
and heeded for major engagements." He was said to -have been
advised further that even if ODYOKE acted "positively" towards
PBRUMEN, such a new group would have to be taken into consideration
becauge it would control "the workers and the masa population, "(225)
These.efforts led to the emergence of "JURE" but by no means did it
actually include UR and the major organizations named. The UR
cannot be considered as sympathetic to RAY, and if any part of UR
were associated with "JURE" it would be little more than some minor
faction. There is no evidence -to indicate that RAY has received
support from any UR faction, Z

Mention of Ud in connection with the new "JURE" can lead to
confusion since this was actually the short title selected at the .
UR re-prganization mccting in February 1962 as a designation for the
exile element, Though recorded in the minutes:of that meeting, the
title wes never used thereafter, (The initials stood for Junta de Unid
Revoincionaria on el Exilio), (197) There is onc possible :
‘explanation ror “JURE” hope of gaining UR Support. Among those
montioned as leaders of this new group was Justo CARRILLO of
Agrupacion Montecristi., AMTAUP-1 roported in July 1962 that
CARRILLO had ylven monetary uid to Juan MEDINA Vora of Accion
Cubana, an organization affiliatod with UR since its rounding. (141)-:-
VEDINA was then General Secretary of UR, CARRILLO may have felt

his influence with MEDINA was strong enough to bring about UR entry
into "JURE",

Exploying the psculiar ‘gyration of ‘political ‘conscience common
to tho exile community, UR dimaidont leader TO! FNTE published a
unity appeal on 8 September 1962 to all PURUAEN los to join the UR
in the fight against Sinu-Hoviot domination of PEURUME .

immoral.” QUESADA added that he, personaily, sould résiga from UR
if the TORRIESTE faction joined AMBUD. (196) In a i:tter to AMBUD
dated 19 Septenber 1962, TORRIESTE and MEDINA (sigzatories) replied
to “the request made by AMBLD-] through br, Raul MENDEZ Pirez” by
giving a brief history of the UR, reasons for recently having ex-
pelled certain members, and accusing GARCIA Oller of having “lent
himself to the making of false documents.” The letter included the
following remarks regarding entry into AMBUD: (196)

“...we have appreciated the invitation made by AMBUD~] on

a visit by Jose E, de la TORRIENTE snd Dr. Juan MEDINA Vega,
respectively President and Secretary of the UR, This offer
was accepted in principle by the UR Coordinators’ Assembly
last night, as in agreement with our ideological principles,
we believe that PBRUMENs should not oniy unite in the
political sense, but alsu in the military, because the
bitter hour which we are living is for war." . 7

This reply to AMBUD-1 may have been expedited following publication
in Diario Las Americas on 16 September of an appeal to all exiles
by Jose F. RODRIGUEZ Espada to join UR in the fight for liberation
of PBRUMEN. He signed.as Secretary General. The appeal included
an announcement of the reorganization of UR in exile based on the
vote of confidence given to Salvador GARCIA Oller by UR in PBRUMEN,
It listed new officers selected on the basis of stipulations of the
National Executive. in PBRUMEN: that all be former members of the
underground, dedicated and well-qualified. (156) .

JMWAVE officers had initiated operational contact with RODRIGUEZ
Espada on 17 August 1962 to establish the re-organized UR overt
mechanism as cover for compartmented FI and PM operations, (147)
Discussions had previously been held with CAVADA and GARCIA Oller
concerning selection of an Executive Board, RODRIGUEZ Espada was the
unanimous choice for the post of Secretary General.(148) The list
of UR officers suggested by. JMWAVE and the idea of combining certain
posts to produce a small, efficient Executive Board proved to be
acceptable to the new Secretary General at the 17 August meeting.

It was pointed out-to RODRIGUEZ Espada that the UR in exile would
function primarily in the field of political action and propaganda;
clandestine activity in support of UR in PBRUMEN and KUTUBE
operations would be sponsored on a compartmented basis by various
MUBARK elements, While the Secretary General .would be informed of
the broad outline of UR clandestine activities, he would not
necessarily know the details.(147) See Attachment B for operational
summary of JHWAVE contact with UR.

At the.17 August meeting it was pointed out to RODRIGUEZ
Espada that JMWAVE wlanned UR entry into AMBUD, with much
Publicity, in the hope tlat-such @ move would strengthen AMBUD
and instigate a general unity tendency among exile groups, At
this point he indicated that UR would ecter AMBUD if necessary, but
that this was only because KUBARK wished it. (As it developed, the
30 November AMBUD delegate threatened to resign if only one UR_
faction were admitted; UR entry is now in abeyence, RODRIGUEZ
Espada submitted a paper on his’ own concept of -how AMBUD might
function more effectively. In essence it stated: (147)

1) ODYOKE would not deal with any PBRUMEN group except
. through AMGUD;

@) an appeal for aid by any PBRUMEN raed to any CDYOXE
element would be referred to AMBUD

3) "each request for aid would receive initial acreoning

decide whether or not to grant the aid, and if
affirmative, the amount and the manner in which given.

A few weeks later the new UR offices were opened at 10-12
S.E. Sth Street. The unity appeal was dated 15 September and
appeared in print the following day. The first issue of the
official Uf organ, Unidad, was published on 10 Novenver 1962.
(188) One resolve of the new UR was to stop the practice of listing
the names of its affiliated organizations, As Mario SEIGLIE pointed
out, there seemed to be a competition in the exile community as to
which organization could claim support of the largest number of
exile groups, The UR wanted no part of this meaningless exercise;
its members were to work together in the name of UR,(155) The
Executive Board of the re-organized UR in September 1962 was
reported as follows: (194) +

In a report to his C/O on 26 July 1962 GARCIA Oller had described

the leading members of UR to be considered for positions on this new
Executive Board. He also indicated availability to UR for clandestine
operations of three boats owned by Marcos DIAZ Lanz “because of the
friendship existing between us," In the field of propaganda, he said
that Norman DIAZ of “Radio Reloj" is a friend of RODRIGUEZ Espada;
that Miguel RODRIGUEZ Caillet has many contacts in Diario ias Americas;
and that Fernando CAVADA receives “all the support he needs” from

the "PBRUMEN Freedom Committee,"(47) .

oon .

Ot exile organizations subsequently indicated a desire to
join the new UR, Ricardo ALVAREZ Tunon of "Rescate Libre" informed
GARCIA Oller in mid-October that he wanted to affiliate with UR and
make a public announcement of the move.(171) The General Coordinator
of the organization"La Cruz," Jesus GONZALEZ Cartas, claimed his’ ~
group numbered more than 100 men and offered them to RODRIGUEZ
Eapada in October 1962 for use in some Latin American country
(preferably Mexico), to counter Communist activity of 211 kinds,
using: force where necessary, (105)

PBRUMEN, see Part III, below.

While Part II of this Attachment has presented information
on UR activity in PBPRIME, it should be noted to avoid confusion
that the name UR is used by opposition groups having no connection:
with the TORRIENTE or RODRIGUEZ Espada factions of the UR described
in this study, Attachment’ F to this Dispatch contains names of organ-
izations with abbreviated titles which include the "UR" initials.
At least two organizations, however, actually use the name Unidad
Revolucionaria. One of these is headed by former Batista Senator

‘ando R Rojas and was reported in August 1962 to be

located in offices at 600 West 136th Street, Apartment 6E, New
York City, This group was first named Un Rifle (UR), or Un Rifle
Cada Cubano (URCC), claiming as its objective to supply a rifle to
every citizen for use in the underground. (165) The UR abbreviation
was probably not intended to be misleading, but uninformed exiles
believed it stood for the familiar Unidad Revolucionaria. ‘They
were not corrected by MASFERRER; on the contrary,he adopted the
title.(195) Another organization using the name Unidad Revolucionaria
was located in Tampa, included nine small, loosely organized groups
in April 1962, and. was headed by Manuel MARTIN Benito (aka: Dan
MARTIN). (2265 a Tecate

a Background data on the ~founding- and early history of UR in

PBRUMEN was reported in Part I above and will not be repeated here,
Tt.Bhould be noted, however, in evaluating UR claims re Provincial

contacts and assets, that UR was said to have been organized in

answerto the appeal by resistance members in the Provinces to

unite ‘the numerous opposition groups and pool resources, thus :
creating a more effective underground,(88) The mass arrests

throughout PBRUMEN in April 1961 completely disoriented UR mesner
organizations and clandestine communications. Asylees such as

GARCIA Oller, RODRIGUEZ Espada, Capt. SOTOLONGO and othe-s

attempted to re-orgarize UR and maintain its contacts in tne HE

Provinces. (26) There was littie contact with “delegates" in PBPRIME ss
for months, as indicated by GARCIA Oller's message to Hector FEBLES ;
in November 1961 via Lazaro RODRIGUEZ Moya, an asylee who left

PBRUMEN at that time.(201) GARCIA apparently was unaware that

Andres ZAYAS had taken over direction of UR in exile in August 1961.

An exile source familiar with UR activity in PBPRIME reported in A aor
March 1962 that communications between internal and exile UR elements

had been “almost non-oxistent during the past several months", (8)

For operational reasons this Executive Board was not composed
of representatives of all UR affiliated organizations as was
attempted. in selecting the board in PBPRIME,(197) AS for its
operational achievements in the resistance, until more frequent
communication with PBPRIME was established in the spring of 1962,
little was reported concerning UR activity in PBRUMEN. Subsequent

reports on the composition of the PBRUMEN Executive Board were not
available until April 1962,

An incident occurred in June 1961 involving the alleged ransom
of Robert M. GEDDES, who had served as a contact between KUBARK and
the UR, The UK Embassy first learned on 31 May 1961 that GEDDES had
escaped from G-2 while en route to a doctor's office for medical
attention, He was said to be in the company of a militiaman who was
promised a. large sum of money for helping GEDDES to escape. The
same day thé Embassy was visited by a Dr. (fnu) MAURI and Prof. Jose
M, BOLANOS of Habana University, who reported that one CONZALEZ
(probably Enrique GONZALEZ, friend of GEDDES and employee of Pepsi
Cola) wanted the Embassy to grant. asylum to GEDDES and the
militiaman, The Embassy stated it could not "engage in activities
of at irregular nature",(11) -On 1 June GEDDES called the Embassy
and said he was safe but he did not know for how long. He said a
letter would be delivered to.the Embassy in a few hours which would
explain. the entire transaction,. This letter was delivered (hand-
writing, was that of GEDDES) and it contained a request that $15,000
or the equivalent in pounds sterling be turned over: to a third party
from the Embassy, and that this sum "would be guaranteed by either his
wife or KENDALL of Pepsi Cola’ in New York City." The letter asked
that the transaction be completed within 24 hours and added that the
militiam.n must be granted asylum by the Embassy, On 2 June another
letter was delivered to the Embassy from GEDDES via Julio VILLANUEVA
(a local attorney for Pepsi Cola) again urging that the money be
turned over as requested, VILLANUEVA returned to the Embassy on 5
June and.said Mrs. GEDDES in PBPRIME had put up the equivalent of
25,000 pesos and that the money would possibly be turned over that
night ‘to a "man from GONZALEZ,"" The Embassy again refused to grant
asylum to the militiaman, (11)

Mrs. GEDDES' involvement in the case began with a phone call on
3 June from Mrs, VILLANUEVA, after which she contacted a Luba SRULMAN
in the JMWAVE.arez tc whom she was te pass $6000, bits. GEDDES e
inaisted on assurances from SRULMAN that GEDDES would be released on
payment of the money, whereupon SRULMAN declined to have anything to ¢
do with the metter. (Luba SRULMAN was said to have separated zroa
her husband, Max TUCHMAN, who was at this time in Habana, but later
arrived in the JMWAVE area in Soptombor 1961). On 4 Juno Mra, CEDDES
contacted Mrs. VILLANUEVA and asked that another intermediary be
named since SRULMAN was unocoporative.(11) Mra, VILLANUEVA instructed
Mrs, GEDDES on 6 June to turn the money over to Isaac MONCARZ, also
in the JMWAVE area.(12) Tho monoy exchange aspect bognn, according
to Max TUCHMAN, about 1 Juno in PBRUMEN whon he was approached by
Fusebio F, CORBA, a manuinuturor's» reprosontative, who was attempting
to oxchange 30,000 poaoa for 4000 for himwolf and’ to other particn,
TUCHMAN said he would nogotiato the deal and thon telephoned hie wifo

the UK Embassy and reported that GlODES, VILLANLEVA, GONZ4=2,
“ELina® and "everyone" bad been arrested by G-2 on th: evening of
6 June after the money had been turned over, (“ELENA™ was provably
Elena POLGAR, a secretary of Pepsi Cola in PBRUMEN). An ODENVY source
subsequently reported he had learned the ransom attempt had been a-
Plot to expose members of the UR underground in PBRUMEN and that
during the escape attempt GEDDES had been under control of G-2. A
number of GEDDFS' friends and members of UR were arrested because
of their exposure while attempting to gain his release.(11:12) It
¥as reported in late September 1961 that Robert Morton GEDDES had
been tried and sentenced to 30 years in prison for coordinating
subversive activity while acting+as a link between revolutionary
groups and KUBARK. (10) GEDDES was allegedly being held in La
Cabana prison. He was released in February 1963 through efforts
of UK Embassy and arrived in PBPRIXE via Mexico City.(181) Mrs.

Naval Resistance Group. Any consideration of UR assets in
PBRUMEN must inevitably include reference to a group of naval
personnel, deeply anti-Communist, who became affiliated with the
UR through contact with its General Coordinator in November 1961.
This group had first contacted the PBPRIME Consulate in Santiago de
Cuba where they were referred to the MRR Coordinator in Habana, who
then referred them to the UR Coordinator.(55) The naval group began
organizing clandestinely as early as July 1960 at the instigation
of Juan F, CASTELLVI Padro and (Pedro H, CAST:iO Ramirez) It was not
originally opposed to AMTHUG-1, but reacted unanimously in opposition :
to Communist indoctrination classes which had been started in March
.1960. throughout PBRUMEN naval units. Its original goals were not to
engage in clandestine activity or espionage, but to maintain unity
in resisting Communist indoctrination among naval officers, with some
iS aeapaaaita -of possible future mass defection or. political action.

The object in joining UR was to obtain a communications channel
‘to ODYOKE, and financial support. An organization chart of the Pa
UR naval resistance group is contained in: UFGA 4532 of 25 June 1962.%
The naval group was to have its own Coordinator on the UR Executive
Board, As an organization, it already had three coordinators: one for :
PBRUMEN- Navy contacts, one for xerchant marine contacts, and one for
contacts among shore-based personnel of the Navy and merchant marine,
CASTELLVI submitted a partial list of 26 naval and merchant marine
officer: who were members. of. the resistance group, Names of harbor
pilots who were members of this group were listed for all major
PBRUMEN harbors, Names of 15 merchant vessels were furnished with
crew members belonging to this UR group. CASTELLVI stated in June
1962 that he had not been in touch with the naval resistance group
for some time and could not give firm figures on its strength. Ho
elaimed that in April 1961 the group had numbered about 70 officors
and some 325 onlistod mon, "oll navy", Asked to givo. conservative
estimates on ite current strength (June 1962) in all three categorias,
he arrived at the figure of 78 officers and 100 enlisted men, but

aid he was unable to estimate the enlisted strength at numerous
inetallations, (27) :

The naval resistance group attempted to defect the Frigate
MAXIMO GOMEZ in April 1961, but a civilian group permitted by
Lt, Cdr, Gonralo MIRANDA to participate.in the action was
penotrated, and the attempt failed, MIRANDA and othors wore
prrested, (bs) Ancther defection plan was reported in May 1962 hy

Antonio ORIC-EZ Hernancez, brother-in-tas of CASTELLVI, This plan
involved tec Frigates and “as eany patrol boats a5 possible.” The
vessels were to break for Une cpen seas at sunset ur a given day

and make for a pre-actermined key or small island scere they would
establish a base and a Government-in-exile. The next step would

be to declare war on ANTHUG-1 and blockade te island, The state

of belligerence would result in a cancellation of maritime insurance
on commercial vessels travelling to PBRUMEN. This plan presumed
ODYOKE support and coordination in several aspects, including

initial protection for the fleeing defected vessels. Certain
Gimultaneous actions would be taken by UR and other resistance groups
in PBRUMEN to begin ihe day following defection, primarily involving
Gabotage, arson and guerrilla warfare. ORDONEZ stated the UR would
utilize its contacts in the Militia and the Rebel Army to incite
members of these forces to join the guerrillas. No help was expected
from the ReLel Air Force.(59) hile a plan of such dimension would
imvolve major ODYOKE policy decisions, the specific assets of the
naval resistance group noted by CASTELLVI, ORDONEZ and others are
considerable and appear to contain a number of potentially viable
targets... They rmclude naval and merchant marine vessels and shore
installations, Lineas Mambisas offices, the naval general staff,

etc, (27)A(Luis CASAS Campajor the UR naval group reported to ORDONEZ
on procedures followed in“off loading Soviet Bloc vessels carrying
munitions to Habana: prior to off. loading, the vessel is towed to

a dry dock and.divers sent down to check for mine or limpets on tho
hull, after which the area is cleared of all RBRUMEN nationals and the
vessels off loaded by Soviet personnel.04(CASAS: (KUBARK asset) claims
one of the divers who conducts such inspections is a UR contact. (59)

“The Chief of the Shipping and Coastal Intelligence Section of
UR, debriefed in April 1962 at CAC, indicated the following as
examples of information compiled by the UR: (109)

for data on foreign ports at which members of the naval resistance

frequent ports of call were St. John's and Halifax in Canada, and
that these ports would be best for making contact, He also listed
Bremen and Hamburg in West Germany, Liverpool in Englsnd, and Antwerp
in Belgium, Other than the Canadian ports, he said about three ships
per month could be expected at these ports, Calls at the Canadian
ports’ would be more frequent. (182) According to PINO, any member’.
of the UR naval resistance group in PSRUMEN may bo contacted by app-
roaching any Captain, First Officer or Chief Engineer of any foreign
merchant ship, including oil tankers (preferably Greek merchant
ships) in any port outside PBRUMEN, asking the officer to deliver

ODOATH Cuntact vith UR. Th Ofounders of the UR naval ‘:
resistance Group, and (CASTRO Ramtrea) establiened contact
with ODOATH by entering YOACRE CYaudestinely in Novenber 1961,
‘ODOATH promised these men “all-out support and assistance,” (34)
Wore specifically, they vere to be provided with small arma,
explosives and demolition equipment for sabotage work. This
equipment was not at YOACRE and would take some time to obtain, but
the UR was to prepare maritinze reception plans and the equipment
would then be provided via PBRUMEN fishing boats which were to meet
PBPRIME vessels off the coast, The UR did not have marxtime assets
and a meeting was arranged with Javier NAVARRETE, described as a&
subordinate of Nino DIAZ, for 26 December 1961 in Santiago de Cuba,
The meeting site was raided by G-2 and NAVARRETE and CASTRO Ramirez
were arrestes and sentenced to 20 and 12 years, renpectively,
CASTELLVI, a harbor pilot, had to mcet an incoming ship, was not
present at the meeting, and was not exposed, (34)

Another discussion with CASTELLVI was requested by ODOATH via
courier in February 1962, but “car trouble" kept CASTELLVI from
keeping his meeting and he sent word to arrange for another, which .
eventually took place in April, From YOACRE he was said to ha’ '@ been
flown to ZRMETAL for a week of interrogation from 14-21 April, after
which he was returned to YOACRE, Manuel VIERA Rodriguez (aka:MARIO)
entered YOACRE in April 1962 but did not see CASTELLVI since VIERA left
on 29 April, While at YOACRE, VIERA talked to a Cept. N. YANOCHIX,
UBHC, who promised him equipment for use in UR operations and VIERA
passed data on five maritime reception points to YANOCHIK, The
equipment was promised for some time in May 1962. Recognition

‘ wignals were agreed upon, (34) Nothing further is known to JMWAVE
of this operation, Antonio ORDONEZ Hernandez reported in April
1962 that the UR had received requirements from ODOATH on entrance
channels, water depths and wharves in Habana harbor and had passed
reports to ODOATH on these subjects,(34) In April 1962 AMIFF-1
reported that a member of UR had entered YOACRE on 22 March 1962,
talked to YANOCHIK about "preparation of a plan," following which
documents were sent to UR members Andres ZAYAS and Boris MIYARES in
PBPRINE, who were to discuss the content of these documents with
ODOATH. (224)

Mail contact between CASTELLVI in PBPRIME and Edualdo PEREZ
Valenzuela at YOACRE was initiated in June ‘1962, PEREZ was
assoribed as the leader.of 4 ®J-man resistance @roup at  YOACRE, (3.20)
He wrote to CASTELLVI 10 June and reported on the current situation
of the group there, stating it expected shortly to establish radic
contact on o regular basis with UR leaders in. Habana; that it was
preparing propaganda material for distribution in PBRUMEN; and that
the situation looked very good for obtaining support from ‘ODOATH,
at least te the extent of training and equipping the group for
instant action on "D Day." He instructed CASTELLVI to write to
him via "Lt, Jack" (MODESETT) at FPO address, with an inner
envelope marked “Para Valenzuela,"(121) GARCIA Oller received a
report on UR activity from Bornardo ALVAHEZ dated 2U July 1962 which
alao contained a letter to CASTELLVI, informing him that MODESETT
had been replaced at YOACRE by Lt. William &7AY who would pass

A notification of the time of broadcast was sent via coded telegram
to a UR agent in Santiaga de Cuba sho vould then notify VOACRE by
courier, ODOATH was said to have monitored and recorded these
transmissions. Reception was verified by courier, The UR station
was said to use a call sign beginning with X followed by three
characters which source did not recall, The UR wi also alleged to
heve delivered old cupies of UfPs to YOACRE, These were believed to
have been obtained from Luis TORROALLA Martin Rivera, a W/T operator
who had previously worked with resistance groups but had been
arrested or killed, Source stated he learned from Manuel VIERA
Rodriguez (MARIO) in May 3962 at YOACRE that the UR radio was
located in a cave in a wooded area near Habana, and had been built
from discarded equipment by a German radio engineer in contact w:
UR in Habana.(27) VIERA reported in August 1962 that the UR posi ed
four radio sets, that it had transmitted to YOACRE but had never. A
received an answer, He stated the UR radio operator was named (Rudy 0
(EL ALEWAN), (63) AMSUM-2 had reported in June 1962 that UR

an PBRUMEN has skilled radio operators and technicians, “one German
engineer and a PBRUMEN Electric engineer who keep the equipment in
good working conditions and construct new unite. "(55)

Courier channels to YOACRE were reported by AMSUM-2 in June 1962
when he stated they were used by UR for internal communications and
contact with ODOATH.(55) AMSUK-1 stated that an efficient courier
net-operated from YOACRE into Oriente Province to the Baracoa area
via female employees of YOACRE, He claimed a message might be sent
, and a reply received within 24 hours. This net was run by Alfonso
GUEVARA and Maximino DELGADO, both located at YOACRE, (120)

Asylees and refugees arriving in PEPRIME in the Spring of 1962 -
continually mentioned UR and other organizations in the course of
debriefings in the JMWAVE area. GARCIA Oller reported 10 April that
UR eas functioning and had a great deal of-potential.2¢He said he
had been active in UR operations from the (Brazilian Embassy), claimed
to know toterial sind eate: i communication channels, coted for
various types of communications, and described an unique grenade-
triggered bomb which planned to use at tne proper time against the
Chinese Embausy. (26) Santiago CASAMAYOR Alonso stated in March 1962 (a
that prior to lis departure from PBRUKEN he bad learned. from(Pedro ?|
LOPEZ Penaranda\that UR vas collecting data for diagrams of the Shell
and Standard Of1 refineries in Habana, lists of DSE and Communist
Party members, shipping data on all ports (arrivals, departure, cargo),
etc.(68) Another source reported the following’ as UR sabotage
targets: refineries, drydocks, water systems in Habana; the cement i
factory and Bacardi Rum plant in Santiago de Cuba,(109) The UR
we reported to possess a low powered voice transmitter in Habana
which allegedly began broadcasting on 18 April 1962 on the 40 i
meter band (7: ) at 1330 hours on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, \
The station was said to have been built by a. "German engineer” who
was also working on a portable transmitter to fit in the trunk of
@ car which would be used to broadcast from various garages, This
information was. supplied by VIERA and FUENTEFRIA.(15) A subsequent - a
report claimed UR had a transmitter in May 1962 which was built
into the trunk of a car, operated on 1200 kes, came on the air on +
Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 1400-1430, or 1300-1400, This :
schedule was monitored at YOACRE but no transmissions were heard. (27) :

UR was also engaged in propaganda activity, according to
examples passed to JMWAVE in June 1962, although such programs were
probably not extensive since they achivved little notoriety, The vari- Thee
ous ideas noted included counter propaganda which quoted from
government publications and journals, then followed with the “truth” 1
of the situation, One of these was signed by a PBRUMEN dentists'
association in UR. Another program was an appeal to nations having
trade. agreements with PBRUMEN to cease shipping goods to Communist—
dominated nations, reminding exporters what Communism has brought to
the people of PBRUMEN. A mimeographed appeal was circulated among
members of the armed forces which asked that they carry on their
duties, but aid the resistance by cooperating with the “infiltration
forces which exist in all branches of the armed forces," The military
were advised te: discuss. their resistance contacts. with no one, to act --
normally as an average servicemen since it is realized they must
maintain an income to provide for their families, but to ignore the
"cell of the red beast" on D Day and to "get lost."(95) Another Fees
example of UR propaganda was the publication of Cuba Clandestina
(October 1962 issue claimed distribution of 25,' jy the
resistance organization of that name and Rescate Libre, identified
as UR member organizations, (192)

He asked GARCIA Oller to contact his cousin, Alfredo OTERO, in the
JMUAVE area for help ia establishing radio contact. (126)

|The Executive Commission was to be responsible for appointing members

of a Provisional Government “endowed with a high spirit of concord
and national unity."(125) The purpose of JNR, according to its
founders, was to afford ODYOKE the advantage of negotiation with a

- ‘Single entity in providing support, rather than with four individual

groups.(53) The MRR, MRP and DRE did not join JNR. (An MRR group
in Oriente Province collaborates). (41) Several sources reported
these groups did not join because they were already supported
individually by “friends in the north."

(An ‘historical footnote to formation of JNR is the fact that
the seven major resistance groups mentioned above had previously
met at Bicarsen Medical Laboratory, Vedado, on 7 July 1961 to
discuss unity, and some representatives even took it upon themselves
to sign an agreemeut in the names of their organizations, For a-
number of reasons, unity was never achieved. It was attempted in
1961 to obtain ODYOKE support of one unity, At the timo, it was
maid that if ODYGKE support ef the unity @roup was not obtained,
but inatead that individual organizations were supported, or oven
single leaders with emall groups of followers, there would never
be real unification of the resistance), (199)

As to UR strength in PBRUMEN, no detailed evaluation has

1962 that the case of UR inside was similar to that of WRR, DRE aad |
MRP, which have been "destroyed because they have tried to function +
clandestinely." He said its leaders have been arrested, the

By the end of October, only Quintes6, GocanRAS) and GABRERA)were still
at large in PBRUMEN; the others were in prison or asylum, or had
escaped to PBPRIME; and one had defected in Europe. This .
development was primarily due to UR connection with the "August ee
uprising.”

a
During the first week of August 1962 at a meeting of JNR, the
Coordinator of the 30 November Movement proposed that JNR take rart

+ 4m a general uprising being planned hy the FAL to occur between 8

and 30 August.(169) The FAL, it was said, would proceed with or

without the help of other resistence organizations... This was 1. he

an internal action and would require no-immediate outside help,

The FAL had said the uprising would be on a national scale, that its
organization was strong in Oriente and Habana Provinces, but that fae
&t had-asked for help from the Segundo Frente Nacional del Escambray i
(SFNE) because FAL was weak in Taevities Province. Manuel VIERA t
later said the DRE and MRP were also involved.(63) There were two
initial reactions to this proposal in the JNR: that it was another i
crackpot scheme, or that it was a G~2 provocation. There is no
record of the position taken by JNR as a whole, but the 30 November
group was apparently in favor of participation, and UR was concerned
to the extent tiat it arranged Zor exfiitration of hiunuel VIERA
(aka: MARIO) to consult with UR in exile as to the advisability of
UR participation, (63) Coordinator ALVAREZ arranged tor VIERA to
moet UR exile Jeadors, VIERA left Habana on 11 August, en route i
to Cayo Anguila,(64; 146) On the same day, GARCIA Oller, RODRIGUEZ q
Espada and. DIAZ Lanz left.to meet him. (36). Security considerations

prevented VIERA from following the original plan and he did not : :
reach PBPRIME until 28 Auguat, He said his mission was not only to

got advico regarding UR participation in the revolt, but to obtain

urgently the “arms, money and equipment” setaed by LE to ! 4
participate with ac. Lupe of success.(63) He reported tsat tae i
revoli sas to taxe place oa the evening of 30 August and sould begin
in Santiago de Cuba, but added it might be possible tor UR to
arrange a postponement to 15 Septemoer if time vere needed to
deliver the support equipment to PBRUMEN, VIERA also carried a
report from the Movimiento Masonico Ciandestino (KM) describing “4
a@ Plan General of an organization called Unidad de Unidades 7
Revolucionarias (UDUR), made up of military segments of a oumber a
of counter-revolutionary groups, He did not imply that this Plan

was connected with the FAL plan, The MMC revolt vas to begin on an

unspecified date in Baracoa, Oriente, where UDUR ciaimed a .
following of 5,000 men,(85) It is possible that. UDUR was involved

in the August uprising in some way, since PBRUMEN security forces

arrested numerous Masonic leaders in September 1962,

After VIERA's departure from Habana, another meeting was held 7
on 13 August at which the 30 August date was apparently confirmed,
ALVAREZ informed GARCIA Oller in exile and appealed for aid in the \
form of men and equipment in a message sent via the Netherlands ~
Embassy and received by GARCIA Oller on 26 August,(52) ALVAREZ \

met again with the FAL on 26 August and was.shown a plan for %
Provisional Government. Participants in the uprising would earn posts
in this government. He met again with UR leaders and it was agreed i
that UR would participate in the uprising. They felt the right
psychological moment had arrived, possibly in view of arrivals of
considerable Soviet military personnel and equipment. ALVAREZ was
presented with a document on FAL stationery which confirmed UR

. participation and its right.to hold-positions in the Provisional
Government. The UR was also authorized to recruit other organizations ra
for the uprising, but was to report. back to FAL for confirmation on 2

FAL leaders were present. At 2130 hours that evening, each of the
resistarce organizatiozs was to supply 15 men to staff this
Headquarters. All of the National Executive Boards were to be
present that evening at the location selected, ALVAREZ felt that

22 the uprising bad been # G-2 provocation, the pout at which
everyone cculd have been taken —— “a massacre” -~ was the point
chosen £, establishing the Headquarters, He said every leader

present either armed or had at least two Molotov cocktails in
his pocket, :

ALVAREZ said that G-2 probably had word that something was to
“come off" on the 30th. As for the UR, he does not feel it is
penetrated, but rather that it was betrayed by someone “who
knew us and now has no contact witt. UR," He believes UR was ex-
posed by a person who knew a member of the Executive some time ago.
This permitted G-2 to conduct surveillances, Detention of UR
members had been made indiscriminately on 30 August, with little
attention paid to the importance of individual leaders, He felt
that if G-2 had known more about UR, that he, ALVAREZ, would have
been arrested first.(169) On 16 Oct:ber Pedro LOPEZ wrote to UR
in exile that ALVAREZ and others suspected Rosario MORENO, a ]9=

e} a model and former mistress of FUENTEFRIA, deposed UR Coordina-
cr. Senorita ew the 6: ders
and approached them for $1,000, to finish Paying for a car which
FUENTEFRIA had given her before he sought asylum, Prior to her
association with FUENTEFRIA, MORENO had been the mistress of
Con JEIRA, Chief of Police of Habana.(61; 220)

Although the appraisal of UR damage made by ALVAREZ on 3
September was difficult to evaluate ("we are left very much in
ruins;" “we have come out of this difficult situation fairly well")
subsequent reports tend to indicate that UR was affected primarily
in Habana itself; this would account for the arrests of the
Executive, or their pursuit which forced them to seek asylum, It
was.also reported that all correspondence and documentation had been
destroyed in the raid and sums of money on hand had been "lost
in the search."(150) ALVAREZ and the Military Coordinator (not 6

written a report to GARCIA Oller dated 24 September; ALVAREZ
wrote one on 21 September, and was arrested on-that date. The
possibility presents itself that these men may have been exposed
while passing these reports to a cutout who was under surveillance
by DRE, if not a witting agent. Although tats is only.conjocture, t
it is apparent from a numbor of reports scanaed during this study :
that UR communications security is definitely poor,

which would "move public opinion." He includod a request for

Organization of Overt Mechanisa

Objectives of JMWAVE in establishing and maintaining contact
with the Executive Conmittee cf UR in exile were primarily to
provide a viable cover mechanism in the fora of an exile resistance
group for the several unilateral operaticas in being or projected
which involve KUBARK assets within UR, A secondary objective was
to create simultaneously a KUCAGE vehicle résponsive to JMWAVE
direction which would serve ODYOKE policy needs for the present,
and develop into a political entity of stature in PBRUMEN after
the overthrow of ANTHUG to assure the presence of a moderate element
in the anticipated struggle between extremists of the right and left.

More specifically, the UR “umbrella” mecnanism will cover
activities of various JMWAVE assets with minimum possible danger
that operations become common knowledge, or are exploited for
personal political or material gain, or are otherwise interfered
with by other than direct participants, JMWAVE intends also to
guide UR entry into AMBUD and encourage other exile groups to
follow. UR successes of any type would thus be shared by AMBUD,
provided conditions are such that they may be publicized.

JMWAVE, by supporting UR exploitation of public media, would

‘be able to disseminate propaganda themes to PBRUMEN exiles in PBPRIME,

to Latin America, and occasionally to other areas of the free world.

. Buch KUCAGE activity would be. supplemented as conditions permit by

covert KUCAGE programs in PBRUMEN. In the political field, it is
Planned to prepare members of UR in exile and in the resistance to
assume responsible roles through democratic processes after libera-
tion of PBRUMEN. The UR principles are based on the Constitution of
Frei Its objectives are stated in Attachment A, as interpreted

.

JMWAVE direction of UR exile activity was effected through a
KUBARK developmental asset, Salvador GARCIA Oller, who received
credentials dated 3 July 1962 from UR in PBRUMEN, with orders to re-
organize ite exiic element. JMWAVE, throvgh frequent contact with
GARCIA Oller, influenced the selection of qualified personnel in UR
for the new Executive Board, at the same time eliminating a number
of positions in ar attempt to create a functional groxp.of-responsible
officers considered politically reliable, Tne restructured UR exec-
utive is headed by Jose F, RODRIGUEZ Espada, who had worked with the
founder, Rafael DIAZ Hanacomb, in establishing UR in PBRUMEN, Contact
was made with RODRIGUEZ Espada in August 1962 via AMBLEAK-1, and the
former has been most cooperative, acceptsng KUBARK direction and
adhering to the principle of compartmentation, EE

UR applied for admission to AMBUD on 17 Septembor 1962, but
acceptance waa delayed by a protest rogistorad by Jose E, de la
TORRIENTE y Ajuria, head of the dismident U2 faction which did net
recognize the oredontiala received by-GARCIA-Ollor, nor the re- -
organized UR executive, TORRIENTE insistod that UR unity could be

The vote was temporarily thearted ome again, oveever, by a

protest registered by tne delegate of the Revolutionary Movement

30 Fovember (MKTS) who s22 uncer the siststes i=pcession taet UR was

in contact with Carlos RODRIGUEZ Quesada, leader of a dissident

MRTM faction in exile, This matter was clarified, and UR made

overtures to sympathetic members of the TORRIESTE faction who were

considered inclined to return to the authentic UR group. This liaison,
well as contacts with ANSUD members of cther exile groups, has gone

far toward settling the problems of UR factionalism and entry into

AMBUD, which will probably be effected in the near future,

Beginning with the administrative and housckeeping chores of
getting up new offices, the UR propaganda effort has received an
average of $4500 per month, of which $2350 pays salaries, approx-
imately $650 is spent on rent, utilities and telephone, and the
remaining $1500 on supplies and equipment directly related to
output of prcpaganda, This last figure will be increased somewhat
in coming montha ag production increases, and after regular
broadcasting 1s added to UR activiti Initially, UR purchased

ce in local Spanish language media, but rapport has
with p: nd radio personnel, and from time to
time UR releases are inserted gratic in news and commentary,

One early propaganda success was publication of two leaflets
oa the Soviet buildup in PBRUMEN, praised by many exile leaders as
based on good research and dramatic presentation, AMBUD-1 passed
copies of these leaflets to Foreign Ministers at the ZRMETAL is]
conference in October 1062. A campaign against free world shipping
in trade with PBRUMEN was coordinated in part with the Athens station)
Most of the UR Executive Board contribute to UNIDAD, the°UR 8-12
page tabloid issued semi-monthly in 50,000 copies, first published.
in November 1962. Copies are distributed throughout Latin America
in third class mail, A booklet prepared by UR, "What Happens when .
Communism Takes Over Your Country," contains about 30 pages of text
and 25 full-page illustrations; it is scon to be released, and

will receive hemisphere distribution as a factual presentation of
the PBRUMEN "lesson,"

The UR-sponsored "Tokyo Rose"-type broadcast targetted against |
the DSE and Militia is to begin shortly with two or three 15-minute
broadcasts per week, Program content will be supervised unilaterally ,
by JHWAVE; UR sponsorship is for attribution only. Operational :
restrictions resulting from the PBRUMEN "crisis" have hampered efforts
at covert propaganda utilizing UR internal assets. Covert media will
be exploited in PBRUMEN in the future.as conditions permit, Two .
important fielde remain to be covered: Student Affairs and Labor,
These positions remain open on the Executive Board, partly because

of JHWAVE insistence that they be given only to qualified personnel,

The matter of funding cover requires further attention. Open
speculation has buon reported from the exile community ‘that UR is
receiving KUBARK support and subsidy in its increased activity,

Some progress has been mado through AMPANIC-~9 sale of UR bonda and
Ban Juan station arrangement for wn WER-1 as backstop for a

resistance does not expect AMSTASH-1 to return to PBRUMEN, After
completion of his KUBARK training, Subject observed the shortcomings -
of UR and other underground organizations with which he worked in
PBRUMEN, For reasens of operational security he has been safe-~
housed to avoid contact with UR in exile, and considers himself a
unilateral KUBARK agent, AMSTASH-1 does not plan to renew UR
