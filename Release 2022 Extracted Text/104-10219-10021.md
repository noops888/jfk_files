MEHORAXDUM FOR: Domestic Collection Division

ATTENTION:

SUBJECT: Joseph R. HEROLA

1. On 10 January 1974 the WH/2/GS desk received the

“yeferenced mezorandum from the Domestic Collection Division
indicating the Hiami field office had been in contact with one
Joseph R. MEROLA. HEROLA had just returned from a business
trip to El Salvador; and he reported that a friend of his had
identified a Mr. Gremtiiion in the Political Section of the
American Embassy in San Salvador as a suspect CIA representattve.
Headquarters traces on Joseph R. HEROLA indicated that on several
occasions in past MEROLA had claimed that he was a CIA
agent. The Chief of Station, the Hr. Greafillion referred to
above, was recantly questioned regarding any Embassy contact
with HEROLA while the latter was in San Salvador. The COS
stated that both within the Embassy community and at social

_ functions MEROLA had frequently referred to his contact with
the CIA, past and present. He also volunteered this infor-
mation to a former Station contact.

2. In light of the above, ft would appear that MEROLA
had taken advantage of his agency contacts in an inappropriate
. Manner to the potential embarrassment of the San Salvador
Statton. We would, accordingly, appreciate that this be given
due consideration in your assessment of the advantage of your
continued contact with hia.
