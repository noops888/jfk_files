Central Intelligence Agency

The subject indicated he resigned his position
as Cuban Ambassador to Pakistan on January 8, 1962, and
arrived in Guadeloupe on February 8, 1962. He said he was
in contact with a Department of State representative in
Karachi, Pakistan, prier to his departure from that country,
but had not discussed with the State Department the data
which he desired to discuss with your Agency. Your
representative in San Juan was advised of the subject's
request to be placed in immediate contact with your Agency.

The foregoing will confirm information furnished
orally on April 7, 1962, to Mr. Qohn Guionlof your Ageney(S)
by Special Agent J. F. Farr of this Bureat.

Our files indicate that the subject was born
August 17, 1913, at Bejucal, Cuba, and served as Cuban
émbassador to Haiti and Guatemala prior to his tour of
duty in Pakistan. We have conducted no investigation
concerning the subject, but have received information
concerning an attempt to assassinate him in June, 1959,
while he was serving as Cuban Ambassador to Haiti. Informa-
tion concerning the assassination attempt has been furnished
your Ageney by communications entitled "Dominican Intelligence
Agents in the United States.”

We contemplate no further action in this matter.
If information of security interest to us is developed

subject planned to defect from Cuban Government and goto
Dominican Republic. The assassination attempt on subject
reportedly was instigated by persons acting on behalf of
Trujillo and, while we have no first-hand information
concerning the assassination attempt, it appears subject
possibly had been working with the Dominicans while serving as
Cuban diplomat, but had either double-crossed them or had

decided not to cooperate any longer with the Dominicans. eye Shaye
