FROM: Robert Olsen

SUBJECT: Interview of March 4, 1975, with E. Howard Hunt
and his Daughter, Lisa Hunt

The interview commenced at approximately 4:00 PM and was conducted

at 712 Jackson Place. ti

cc .
SS
& Mr. Hunt is presently residing at 1245 N. E, Béth Street, Miami, Florida
33138. He has a silent telephone number of 305 758-6159.

Lisa Hunt resides at 3406 Nimitz Road, Apt. A-2, Kensington, Maryland
20795. She has an unlisted telephone number which she declined to
give us. She was born on March 9, 1951.

The interview concerned allegations that Mr. Hunt was involved in the
assassination of President John Kennedy and other public figures. He
is aware of the public statements made by Dick Gregory and Ralph
Schoenman in early February 1975 relative to his being involved in the
assassination of President Kennedy. He states that most of the infor-
mation that Mr. Gregory and Mr. Schoenman referred to is drawn from
a book by Tad Szulc entitled, E. Howard Hunt, the Compulsive Spy.
Hunt states that the book is saturated with errors. One of those errors
is the claim that Hunt was Chief of Station in Mexico City in the fall of
1963.

SECRET/SENSITIVE

The Bay of Pigs Background

Hunt states that in 1960 he was assigned to the job of organizing a
"government in exile" for Cuba among Cuban exiles in Florida. The
plan adopted by the National Security Council under President Eisenhower
called for the formation and training of a brigade of Cuban exiles who
would invade Cuba, establish a provisional government, receive recog-
nition by the United States and overthrow the Castro government. The
brigade h-d its own air force and was otherwise fully equipped by the
United States Government. The operation, however, was not supposed

to be one involving United States Government participation. The venture
was to involve training and launching from outside the United States.

In connection with his political activity and the organization of the
government in exile, Hunt went to Mexico in 1960, Shortly thereafter
the Mexican government demanded that they leave and he returned to
the United States. Richard Nixon, then Vice President, was working
closely with the CIA on the project.

When President Kennedy was elected in November 1960, he was briefed
on the project and confirmed the plans, including the plan to provide air
cover to the invading Cuban force, In early 1961, however, the Kennedy
administration decided that the political organization of the Cuban
government in exile would have to be broadened so as to include all
elements of the Cuban society. Even radical leftwingers were to be
included. Hunt was assigned the job of convincing the leaders of the
Cuban community to accept such a broadening of the political structure
of the government in exile. Hunt found this to be an impossible job to
accomplish because the Cubans recruited to make up the invasion force
had been promised that the government in exile would be solidly anti-
Castro and anti-communist. Hunt asked to be relieved of his assignment
because he thought it was an impossible one to achieve and he returned
to Washington to work on propaganda and similar non-political aspects
of the forthcoming invasion.

Within twenty-four hours prior to the time that the Cuban brigade was

to hit the beaches at the Bay of Pigs, President Kennedy made two
critical decisions that affected the final outcome: he cancelled plans

@ for an airstrike on Cuba which would have destroyed the six remy e £
combat planes that were available to Castro; second, the order thét £

there be no air cover for the invading brigade. The result was that
the invading force was chopped up while it was still in the water; the
ships carrying the armored vehicles were sunk, as were the supply
ships, and the troops were left abandoned on the shore. The remnant
of the Cuban Air Force was entirely adequate to demolish the invasion
fleet.

Hunt concedes that he was bitter about the decisions made by President
Kennedy, but he primarily blames Arthur Schlesinger, Adlai Stevenson
and Robert Kennedy for advising the President to follow the course he
chose. He particularly feels that the Gabans had been recruited with
certain promises and that those promises were withdrawn at the last
minute. Hunt says, in fact, that the decision not to make the airstrike
and not to provide air cover was made after the invasion fleet had arrived
at the point of no return, i.e., when radio communication to the invasion
fleet had already terminated for security reasons.

After the Bay of Pigs disaster, Hunt worked with Allen Dulles until early

1962 at which time Dulles was replaced as DCI, In January 1962, Hunt

was assigned to the Domestic Operations Division of the Deputy Directorate
r ] for Plans. He was involved in handling proprietaries based in the United

States, which have their impact abroad. His immediate superior was

Stanley Gaines, who was either Chief of Operations or Executive Officer

of the Domestic Operations Division and Tracy Barnes, who was Division

Chief of DOD (Barnes is a cousin by marriage to Vice President

Rockefeller. )

Hunt's assignment with DOD lasted until the spring of 1965.

During the period from January 1962 until 1965, he states that he never
traveled to Mexico or any other Latin American country. His first
trip to Mexico after 1961 was in 1970, when he traveled there for the
Mullen Company after his retirement from the CIA.

Hunt's Whereabouts on November 22, 1963

Hunt states that he had never been in Dallas until 1971, with a possible
exception of a change of planes on his way to Mexico with his family in
1960. He does not recall whether that change of planes took place in
Dallas or in Houston. In any event, he and his family never left the
airport on that occasion.

<2 SUF ROSE RE SU I EIRP S

He has never had any contact, directly or indirectly, with Lee Harvey
Oswald, Jack Ruby or anyone else thought to have been associated with
& the assassination of the President.

He was never in New Orleans in 1963 and has never had anything whatever
to do with the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, which he identifies as a
communist organization.

During the period from January 1962 to 1965, he traveled once or twice
per year to India, two or three times per year to Paris, once or twice
per year to London, and, during that period, he traveled two or three
times to Rome. His only domestic travel in 1963 was between Washington
and New York. All travel, whether domestic or international, was in his
own name.

On November 22, 1963, he and his wife were driving on H Street at about
9th in Washington, D. C., when he turned the car radio on and learned
that the President had been shot. He and Mrs. Hunt had been shopping
in a Chinese grocery store in that immediate vicinity, immediately prior
to their getting into the car. The Hunts lived at 5215 Balton Road,
Sumner, Maryland. On their way home they drove to the Sidwell Friends
school on upper Wisconsin Avenue and picked up their younger daughter,
Kevan. Kevan told them that Robert and Courtenay Kennedy, children of
Attorney General Robert Kennedy, were students in the same school and
had been picked up by the Secret Service. The children in the school
knew that the President had been shot.

Mr. Hunt states that the following persons are witnesses to the fact that
he was here in Washington, D. C., at the time the President was shot
in Dallas:

1, His son, Howard St. John Hunt, then ten years of age.

& 2. His daughter, Lisa, then twelve years of age.

3. His daughter, Kevan, then eleven years of age.

4, The family maid, Mary Trayner, now employed by a family
living at 4806 DeRussey Parkway, Chevy Chase, Maryland,
and whose phone number is 652-2930.

Mr. Hunt believes that he was either taking the day off from work as

a part of annual leave on November 22, 1963, or he may have been
recuperating from a hospitalization for ulcers. He had been hospitalized
at about that period at Sibley Hospital in Washington, D. C.

Mr. Hunt states that he held the following oil company charge account

and credit cards in 1963 and that such accounts may provide corroboration
as to his presence in Washington, D, C,, on November 22, 1963:

Esso Oil, Gulf Oil, Texaco Oil, Cities Service Oil, Brooks Brothers
(New York), Garfinkle's, Woodward and Lothrop, Sears Roebuck & Co.,
Hecht Co. He also states that telephone records might be checked with

SECRET/SENSITIVE

a Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Co.; that the CIA might have travel
voucher records showing his travel during that year and that CIA should
also have records on the dates on which he took sick leave or annual
leave.

Mr. Hunt categorically denies that he has been involved in any way what-
soever with the assassination of President Kennedy, Senator Robert
Kennedy, Martin Luther King, or any other person either within or without
the United States. He similarly denies any participation or involvement
whatever in the attempted assassination of Governor Wallace, the
disappearance of Congressman Hale Boggs or the shooting of Senator
Stennis.

He states that in connection with the planning for the Cuban invasion in
1961, he did suggest that Fidel Castro should be assassinated either before
or contemporaneously with that invasion, but his suggestion was not acted
upon or otherwise approved.

Attached are copies of a press statement made by Mr. Hunt in early

February 1975 in Florida, in which he denies the allegations made by

Dick Gregory and others with respect to his involvement in the assassi-

nation of President Kennedy and a letter written to Mr. Hunt by the former
@ family maid, Mary Traynor.

Lisa Hunt confirms her father's account that he was at home with the
family in the afternoon and evening of November 22, 1963. She recalls
that her father assembled the family in front of the television set. He
wanted them all to watch the program because it was.an important
historical matter. They were all shocked about the assassination of
the President.

The all [ations made by Dick Grego and others connecting
me to the murdor of President John Kennedy are totally without foundatir
They constitute a false and vicious libe-.,

@ These charges are bizarre “ . products of sick minds.
The Political Left has never been able or willing te accept the fact
that Kennedy's assassin was a man of the Left; thus the Leftist
preoccupation with finding an alternate assassin.

Dick Gregory's smear represents the ultimate in slander and
innuendo customarily characterized as McCarthyism.

The Rockefeller and other investigative committees will
probably examine Gregory's charges ~ as indeed they should. For my
part I would welcome a thorough high-level investigation and a full
airing of all relevant findings. Only if this takes place will I have
any hope of clearing my name and living free from the threats against
my life already made by neurotics.

e I was not in Dallas,Texas, on November 22,1963; in fact I
nevor visited Dallas until eight years later, I did not meet Frank
Sturgis until 1972, nine years after we were allegedly together in
Dallas. I was not in Mexico in 1963, and I did not meet Lee Harvey
Oswald there or at any other place or time. Moreover, I shared the
nation's grief over the murder of our Prosident. These are the facts.

Until authoritative investigative bodies make known thoir
judgment concerning my alleged involvement in the Kennedy murder I
will continue to bring libel actions against any and all parties
who repeat the libel. I mst take this course because the libels are
prejudicial to my position before the Court now considering my
Appeal from the Watergate affair. And because the libels threaten my

ne is that continued publicity given to these reckless
charges could stimlate some yet-unpublicized maniac into violent

MEMORANDUM FOR: FILE ©

FROM: Robert B. Olsen -

SUBJECT: Telephone Interview with E. Howard Hunt

on March 7, 1975

I called Mr. Hunt at his residence in Miami, Florida, after first
clearing the matter with his attorney, Mr. Snyder, of Baltimore.

I asked Mr. Hunt about the apparent inconsistency between his des-
cription to us of the circumstances under which he heard about the
assassination of President Kennedy on November 22, 1963, and the
letter from a former family maid, Mary Traynor. In particular, I
‘called his attention to the fact that Mrs. Traynor ,in her letter,
advises that Mr. and Mrs. Hunt were at home when word of the assas-
ination came in a telephone call from Veronica Moppett. This
is inconsistent with Mr. Hunt's statement that he and Mrs. Hunt
heard about the assassination on the car radio while they were in

@ downtown Washington, D. C. Mr. Hunt stated that Mary Traynor
seems to be in error. He says that it is entirely possible that
there was such a call from Veronica Moppett, although he does not
remember it. He says that a lot of people were calling each other
with the news about the shooting of the President. He says it is
also possible that this was the manner in which Mary Traynor heard
about the shooting and that she is simply in error in her recollec-
tion that the Hunts were then at home,

Hunt stated that he thinks that the Sidwell Friends School dismissed
classes for the day at 3:15 pm or 3:30 pm. He says it is possible
that the school was dismissed earlier on the day of the assassination
put he does not know for sure. He acknowledges that he and Mrs. Hunt
would not have known about an earlier dismissal of classes in time to
pick up Kevan unless Mrs. Hunt had called the school while they were
enroute from downtown Washington, D. C. He does not recall making
such a call himself,.and he does not recall his wife making one. If
classes let out at the normal time, he and Mrs. Hunt would have arrived
at home, with their daughter Kevan, at about 3:30 or 3:45 pm.

He states that, as he recalls it, there was some delay between the
time of the death of the President and the time it was made public
& on radio and television. He does not recall whether the death of

the President had been announced by the time he and Mrs. Hunt arrived
at home and he turned on the television set. [The President was pro-
nounced dead at 2:00 pm, Eastern Standard Time. The exact time when
the death was announced on radio or television has not been checked
out.]

He recalls that when he was watching T.V. with his family after arriving
at home, either Huntley or Brinkley made some statement to the effect
that the assassination was an outgrowth of the hatred of far Right groups
which was much in evidence in Dallas, as had been shown by a recent inci-
dent involving some one spitting into the face of Adlai Stevenson. The
implication made by Huntley or Brinkley was that the assassination had
been accomplished by some one from the far Right Wing. This was before
anything was known about the actual assassin. Hunt remembers commenting
to his family that it was just like Huntley or Brinkley to jump to the
conclusion that the shooting had been by a Right Winger before any evi-
dence was available concerning the assassin.

Mr. Hunt will give us a detailed affidavit covering his non-involvement
in the various assassinations. He states that he hopes to be able to
avoid another trip back to Washington because he wants to spend as much
time as possible with his eleven-year old daughter, who is very anxious
about her father's impending imprisonment.

& Mr. Hunt states that he hopes to be assigned to a minimum security federal
prison in Florida when he reports on March 25S.

With respect to the late-night television program on the evening of March 6,
1975, on ABC TV, Hunt states that he recorded the program on tape. It was
an interview of Dick Gregory, Ralph Schoenman, and one of their companions.
None of the above mentioned Hunt's name or that of Sturgis on the program,
He describes the interviewer pressing Dick Gregory on whether he claims
that the CIA was involved in the assassination of President Kennedy and
Gregory responding that they were not stating that as a fact, but only
that if there was any chance of CIA involvement, then the President's Com-
mission should investigate it. Gregory and his companions showed the
Zapruder film and the major thrust of the program was an emphasis on the
snapping back of the President's head at the time of the fatal shot. One
of the interviewees (I believe he said it was Schoenman) stated that they
did not really expect much from Olsen at the CIA Commission, but that they
were going to "keep embarrassing him with the facts."

Mr. Hunt feels that the press should give some publicity to Schoenman's
background with the Bertrand Russell Foundation.
