Interview of March 4, 1975, with E. Howard Hunt

and his Daughter, Lisa Hunt

astridensinancestra

The interview commenced at approximately 4:00 PM and was conducted

at 712 Jackson Place.

85.

Mr. Hunt is presently residing at 1245 N. E. &2th Street, Miami, Florida

33138. He has a silent telephone number of 305 758-6159:

Lisa Hunt resides at 3406 Nimitz Road, Apt. A-2, Kensington, Maryland

20795. She has an unlisted telephone number which she declined to

give us. She was born on March 9, 1951.

The interview concerned allegations that Mr. Hunt was involved in the

assassination of President John Kennedy and other public figures. He

is aware of the public statements made by Dick Gregory and Ralph

Schoenman in early February 1975 relative to his being involved in the

assassination of President Kennedy. He states that most of the infor-

mation that Mr. Gregory and Mr. Schoenman referred to is drawn from

a book by Tad Szulc entitled, E. Howard Hunt, the Compulsive Spy.

Hunt states that the book is saturated with errors. One of those errors

is the claim that Hunt was Chief of Station in Mexico City in the fall of

1963.

SECRET/SENSITIVE

The Bay of Pigs Background

Hunt states that in 1960 he was assigned to the job of organizing a

"government in exile" for Cuba among Cuban exiles in Florida.

The

plan adopted by the National Security Council under President Eisenhower

called for the formation and training of a brigade of Cuban exiles who

would invade Cuba, establish a provisional government, receive recog-

nition by the United States and overthrow the Castro government. The

brigade had its own air force and was otherwise fully equipped by the

United States Government. The operation, however, was not supposed

to be one involving United States Government participation. The venture

was to involve training and launching from outside the United States.

In connection with his political activity and the organization of the

government in exile, Hunt went to Mexico in 1960.

Shortly thereafter

the Mexican government demanded that they leave and he returned to

the United States. Richard Nixon, then Vice President, was working

closely with the CIA on the project.

When President Kennedy was elected in November 1960, he was briefed

on the project and confirmed the plans, including the plan to provide air

cover to the invading Cuban force.

In early 1961, however, the Kennedy

administration decided that the political organization of the Cuban

government in exile would have to be broadened so as to include all

elements of the Cuban society. Even radical leftwingers were to be

included. Hunt was assigned the job of convincing the leaders of the

Cuban community to accept such a broadening of the political structure

of the government in exile.

Hunt found this to be an impossible job to

accomplish because the Cubans recruited to make up the invasion force

had been promised that the government in exile would be solidly anti-

Castro and anti-communist.

Hunt asked to be relieved of his assignment

because he thought it was an impossible one to achieve and he returned

to Washington to work on propaganda and similar non-political aspects

of the forthcoming invasion.

Within twenty-four hours prior to the time that the Cuban brigade was

to hit the beaches at the Bay of Pigs, President Kennedy made two

critical decisions that affected the final outcome: he cancelled plans

SECRET/SENSITIVE

NH 50955 DocId: 32203858

## Page 5

SECRET/SENSITIVE

for an airstrike on Cuba which would have destroyed the six remaining

combat planes that were available to Castro; second, the order wat

there be no air cover for the invading brigade. The result was that

the invading force was chopped up while it was still in the water; the

ships carrying the armored vehicles were sunk, as were the supply

ships, and the troops were left abandoned on the shore.

The remnant

of the Cuban Air Force was entirely adequate to demolish the invasion

fleet.

Hunt concedes that he was bitter about the decisions made by President

Kennedy, but he primarily blames Arthur Schlesinger, Adlai Stevenson

and Robert Kennedy for advising the President to follow the course he

chose. He particularly feels that the Cubans had been recruited with

certain promises and that those promises were withdrawn at the last

minute. Hunt says, in fact, that the decision not to make the airstrike

and not to provide air cover

was made after the invasion fleet had

arrived

at the point of no return, i. e., when radio communication to the invasion

fleet had already terminated for security reasons.

After the Bay of Pigs disaster, Hunt worked with Allen Dulles until early

1962 at which time Dulles was replaced as DCI. In January 1962, Hunt

was assigned to the Domestic Operations Division of the Deputy Directorate

for Plans. He was involved in handling proprietaries based in the United

States, which have their impact abroad. His immediate superior was

Stanley Gaines, who was either Chief of Operations or Executive Officer

of the Domestic Operations Division and Tracy Barnes, who was Division

Chief of DOD (Barnes is a cousin by marriage to Vice President

Rockefeller.)

The proprietaries which Hunt was engaged in managing were Contin

Alisede Pacific Publishing Company of Bombayy which was engaged in

pubishng textbooks for Indien schools; tho Rome Daily American, a

cover operation; and Fodor's Travel Guides, a proprietary which Hunt

questions as to whether it had any use. (Fodor's had been set up in

1946 as a cover operation but served no apparent use during the years

Hunt was with DOD.

SECRET/SENSITIVE

The headquarters for the DOD was at 1717 H Street, N. W., in

Washington, D. C., and then later it was on Pennsylvania Avenue.

Hunt's assignment with DOD lasted until the spring of 1965.

During the period from January 1962 until 1965, he states that he never

traveled to Mexico or any other Latin American country. His first

trip to Mexico after 1961 was in 1970, when he traveled there for the

Mullen Company after his retirement from the CIA.

Hunt's Whereabouts on November 22, 1963

Hunt states that he had never been in Dallas until 1971, with a possible

exception

of a change of planes on his way to Mexico with his family in

1960.

He does not recall whether that change of planes took place in

Dallas or in Houston. In any event, he and his family never left the

airport on that occasion.

He has never had any contact, directly or indirectly, with Lee Harvey

Oswald, Jack Ruby or anyone else thought to have been associated with

the assassination of the President.

He was never in New Orleans in 1963 and has never had anything whatever

to do with the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, which he identifies as a

communist organization.

During the period from January 1962 to 1965, he traveled once or twice

per year to India, two or three times per year to Paris, once or twice

per year to London, and, during that period, he traveled two or three

times to Rome. His only domestic travel in 1963 was between Washington

and New York.

All travel, whether domestic or international, was in his

own name.

Hunt states that in 1961 he used the pseudonym of Edward J. Hamilton in

connection with his work on the Cuban project in Florida.

With the

exception of that pseudonym and the pseudonym he used on the identifi-

cation papers provided him for the Ellsberg break in, he has never used

a pseudonym.

On November 22, 1963, he and his wife were driving on H Street at about

9th in Washington, D. C., when he turned the car radio on and learned

that the President had been shot. He and Mrs. Hunt had been shopping

in a Chinese grocery store in that immediate vicinity, immediately prior

to their getting into the car. The Hunts lived at 5215 Balton Road,

Sumner, Maryland. On their way home they drove to the Sidwell Friends

school on upper Wisconsin Avenue and picked up their younger daughter,

Kevan. Kevan told them that Robert and Courtenay Kennedy, children of

Attorney General Robert Kennedy, were students in the same school and

had been picked up by the Secret Service. The children in the school

knew that the President had been shot.

Mr. Hunt states that the following persons are witnesses to the fact that

he was here in Washington, D. C., at the time the President was shot

in Dallas:

1. His son, Howard St. John Hunt, then ten years of age..

2. His daughter, Lisa, then twelve years of age.

3. His daughter, Kevan, then eleven years of age.

4. The family maid, Mary Irayner, now employed by a family

living at 4806 DeRussey Parkway, Chevy Chase, Maryland,

and whose phone number is 652-2930.

Mr. Hunt believes that he was either taking the day off from work as

a part of annual leave on November 22, 1963, or he may have been

recuperating from a hospitalization for ulcers. He had been hospitalized

at about that period at Sibley Hospital in Washington, D. C.

Mr. Hunt states that he held the following oil company charge account

and credit cards in 1963 and that such accounts may provide corroboration

as to his presence in Washington, D. C., on November 22, 1963:

Esso Oil, Gulf Oil, Texaco Oil, Cities Service Oil, Brooks Brothers

(New York), Garfinkle's, Woodward and Lothrop, Sears Roebuck & Co.,

Hecht Co.

He also states that telephone records might be checked with

SECRET/SENSITIVE

NH 50955 DocId: 32203858 Page 7

---

## Page 8

SECRET/SENSITIVE

Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Co.; that the CIA might have travel

voucher records showing his travel during that year and that CIA should

also have records on the dates on which he took sick leave or annual

leave.

Mr. Hunt categorically denies that he has been involved in any way what-

soever with the assassination of President Kennedy, Senator Robert

Kennedy, Martin Luther King, or any other person either within or without

the United States. He similarly denies any participation or involvement

whatever in the attempted assassination of Governor Wallace, the

disappearance of Congressman Hale Boggs or the shooting of Senator

Stennis.

He states that in connection with the planning for the Cuban invasion in

1961, he did suggest that Fidel Castro should be assassinated either before

or contemporaneously with that invasion, but his suggestion was not acted

upon or otherwise approved.

Attached are copies of a press statement made by Mr. Hunt in early

February 1975 in Florida, in which he denies the allegations made by

Dick Gregory and others with respect to his involvement in the assassi-

nation of President Kennedy and a letter written to Mr. Hunt by the former

family maid, Mary Traynor.

Lisa Hunt confirms her father's account that he was at home with the

family in the afternoon and evening of November 22, 1963. She recalls

that her father assembled the family in front of the television set. He

wanted them all to watch the program because it was an important

historical matter. They were all shocked about the assassination of

the President.

The

Theso charges are bizarre . products of sick minds.

The Political Loft has never been able or willing to accept the fact

that Kennody's assass In was

a man of the left; thus the Leftist

prooccupation with finding an alternate assassin.

Dick Gregory's smear represents the ultimate in slander and

innuendo customarily characterized as McCarthyism.

The Rockefeller and other investigative committees will

probably examine Gregory's charges - as indeed they should. For my

part I would welcome a thorough high-level investigation and a full

airing of all relevant findings. Only if this takes place will I have

any hope of clearing my name and living free from the threats against

my life already made by neurotics.

I was not in Dallas, Texas, on November 22, 1963; In fact I

novor visited Dallas until eight years later. I did not meet frank

Sturgis until 1972, nine years after we were allegedly together in

Dallas. I was not in Moxico in 1963, and I did not meot Lee Harvey

Uswald there or at any other place or time.

Moreover, I shared the

nation's grief over the murder of our President. These are the facts.

Until authoritative Investigative bodies make known their

judgment concerning my alleged involvement in the Kennedy murder I

will continue to bring libel actions against any and all parties

who repeat the libel. I must take this course because the libels are

prejudicial to my position before the Court now considering my

Appeal from the Watergate affair. And because the libels threaten my

only means of livellhood, as a writer. But of even greater concern to

me is that

MEMORANDUM FOR:

FROM:

Robert B. Olsen

SUBJECT:

Telephone Interview with E. Howard Hunt

on March 7, 1975

I called Mr. Hunt at his residence in Miami, Florida, after first

clearing the matter with his attorney, Mr. Snyder, of Baltimore.

I asked Mr. Hunt about the apparent inconsistency between his des-

cription to us of the circumstances under which he heard about the

assassination of President Kennedy on November 22, 1963,

and the

letter from a former family maid, Mary Traynor.

In particular, I

'called his attention to the fact that Mrs. Traynor, in her letter,

advises that Mr. and Mrs. Hunt were at home when word of the assas-

ination came in a telephone call

from Veronica Moppett. This

is inconsistent with Mr. Hunt's statement that he

and Mrs. Hunt

heard about the assassination on the car radio while they were in

downtown Washington, D. C.

Mr. Hunt stated that Mary Traynor

seems to be in error. He says that it is entirely possible that

there was such a call from Veronica Moppett, although he does not

remember it.

He says that a lot of people were calling each

other

with the news about the shooting of the President. He says it is

also possible that this was the manner in which Mary Traynor heard

about the shooting and that she is simply in error in her

recollec-

tion that the Hunts were then at home.

Hunt stated that he thinks that the Sidwell Friends School dismissed

classes for the day at 3:15 pm or 3:30 pm.

that the school was dismissed earlier on the day of the assassination

says it as possibtion

but he does not know for sure.

He acknowledges that he and Mrs. Hunt

would not have known about an earlier dismissal of classes in time to

pick up Kevan unless Mrs. Hunt had called the school while they were

enroute from downtown Washington, D. C.

He does not recall making

such a call himself, and he does not recall his wife making one. If

classes let out at the normal time, he and Mrs. Hunt would have arrived

at home, with their daughter Kevan, at about 3:30 or 3:45 pm.

He states that, as he recalls it, there was some delay between the

time of the death of the President and the time it was made public

on radio and television. He does not recall whether the death of

the President had been announced by the time he and Mrs. Hunt arrived

at home and he turned on the television set.

[The President was pro-

nounced dead at 2:00 pm, Eastern Standard Time. The exact time when

the death was announced on radio or television has not been checked

out. ]

He recalls that when he was watching T.V. with his family after arriving

at home, either Huntley or Brinkley made some statement to the effect

that the assassination was an outgrowth of the hatred of far Right groups

which was much in evidence in Dallas, as had been shown by a recent inci-

dent involving some one spitting into the face of Adlai Stevenson.

implication made by Huntley or Brinkley was that the assassination had

been accomplished by some one from the far Right Wing.

This was before

anything was known about the actual assassin.

Hunt remembers commenting

to his family that it was just like Huntley or Brinkley to jump to the

conclusion that the shooting had been by a Right Winger before any evi-

dence was available concerning the assassin.

Mr. Hunt will give us

a detailed affidavit covering his non-involvement

in the various assassinations. He states that he hopes to be able to

avoid another trip back to Washington because he wants to spend as much

time as possible with his eleven-year old daughter, who is very anxious

about her father's impending imprisonment.

Mr. Hunt states that he hopes to be assigned to a minimum security federal

prison in Florida when he reports on March 25.

With respect to the late-night television program on the evening of March 6,

1975, on ABC TV, Hunt states that he recorded the program on tape. It was

an interview of Dick Gregory, Ralph Schoenman, and one of their companions.

None of the above mentioned Hunt's name or that of Sturgis on the program.

He describes the interviewer pressing Dick Gregory on whether he claims

that the CIA was involved in the assassination of President Kennedy and

Gregory responding that they were not stating that as a fact, but only

that if there was any chance of CIA involvement, then the President's Com-

mission should investigate it. Gregory and his companions showed the

Zapruder film and the major thrust of the program was an emphasis on the

snapping back of the President's head at the time of the fatal shot. One

of the interviewees (I believe he said it was Schoenman) stated that they

did not really expect much from Olsen at the CIA Commission, but that they

were going to "keep embarrassing him with the facts."

Mr. Hunt feels that the press should give some publicity to Schoenman's

background with the Bertrand Russell Foundation.
