MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, SOG

Chief, DCD

Chief, LA Division

SUBJECT

Mitchell Livingston Werbel lI

1.1 was advised by the Justice Department on 23 February that

Werbel hag been indicted and the trial is scheduled to begin on 29 March

in Mamt, Florida. The charges relate to importing and dictributing

quantities of marijuana? With Werbells propensity to raise his past

affiliations with the Agency, we can anticipate problems during this trial.

An additional problem Is presented because Werbel is defended by Edwin

Marger who was the defense attorney for John Hawk In the B-26 case in

Buffalo. New York In 1966. It was Edwin Marger who subpoenaed the CIA

General Counsel as a defense witness.

The Justice Department has received information that a person

either currently or formerly affiliated with the ClA has been participating

in Werbel's meetings with his attorney. l would be appreciated if all-

addressces could revies their holdingn on Werbel and determine if there

is any calidity to any recent contacts with him. I would urge that instruc-

Lions be sent to Miami that no, repent no, contact with Verbel tare place

betcen now and the beginning of the trial.

3. It would be helpful if each addressee could prepare a summily

of the various contacls Werbel has had with ClA In the past. Please check

to see if you have ony information un a Colonel Bayard who was killed in

Atlanta, Georgia during the summer of 1975

Bayard, reportodly an

ananciate of Werbel's, had previous contacts with the Agency

it would

be appreciated lí your responses could be received by close of business

substantial amunes of money for lilm to recruft covert types, para-military

he in reporting this information. I certainly lope so. So agata, what I am

shoving you is that I think stuff 1s coning into washington right fast. Now

Werbell has been known to drop Mr. Colby's name to me and to many other people

becauce he wingled - Werbell originally was in the OSS you know. So he has a

Is the implications of this thing which I know now are known in washington by

ATTN John McConnell

John Greany (OCC)

Chief, Mland Field Office

M1tchel1 LAvingston Herbell, IU.

Oohar I we received a long distance call, presumably from Powder

Springs, Georgie, from subfect, who is an old and unsavory contact of this

office dating fron 1959.

Herbell has been involved in a vartety of scrapes,

the Latest of which concerned an abortive Invasion of Halt which John Greany

was very much concerned about & year or so ago.

Verbell stoted that the Department of Refense had just revoked hie

security clearance on grounde of Herbell'e "frivoloua behavior" in the Haitian

caper. Werball stated that he intended to fight it to the Supreme Court", as

he had alvays kept us und other olecente of the US Governnent informed con-

cerning developnanta in the laitian natter.

9. Herboll aaked if there was anyching that we could do for bis in the

way of Interceding for him with the DOD, and ve inforned him bluntly and in

no uncertain toma that le was strictly on his ou, and we could do nothing

No then asked

1ê 11 would be worthchile to subenero Bart Conzales.

ke Infonned him that it wad up to hie attoray to make such recoumendations.

Herbell seened to get the bessage, and then offered to keep ua advised

regerding no alleged forthcuning attempt on Haiti which is being agonsored by

Rolando Manfarrer, even though Masferrer lu currently incarcerated In a fedoral

told Verbell that if bs wiahed to pass any lufursation along we

would accept if but under no circumstances should he attent to eileit any :

inforation on our behalf. He agreed that ie would operate on this basio and

said he aight be in touch with us again.

In vien of herbill'y record we felt that this latest contact abould
