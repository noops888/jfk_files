Dear Sir:

Reference is made to your letter of December 18th,

I am enclosing a notarized statement providing you
with the address and. place of birth of Mr. WerBell,

With regard to your last paragraph asking for clari-~
fication as to which records he desires to have
searched, we, of course, are not familiar with your
files or filing system, Mr. WerDell spent sometime
in the United States Army. during World War II and

has traveled extensively since that time. He was in
Cuba at the time of the Castro military operation,

in the Dominican Republic during, that military opera-
tion and in Thailand and Viet Nai during the viet Nam
War. We fecl quite confident your office must have
extensive files and documentation concerning Mr. Nor-
Bell and this request for information is intended to

hee Fvwly

Very truly yours,
