MEMORAXDUM FOR: C/CI/OA
SUBJECT : Operational Approval for LITAMIL-9

1. The Provisional Operational Approval for LITAMIL-9
(C-101331) is due to expire 8 January 1965.

2. In discussions with the field case officer |for this
operation, WH/1/Mexico has found that there is no way to
determine when, or whether, LITAMIL-9 will again ledve Cuba.
For reasons of personal security, LITA¥II-9 has not /been

able to Iunct20n as a repurtiug cvuree otawe Ds =
Cuba in early March 1965. Letters to his brother, ITAMIL-17,

and reports from occasional Cuban official travelers transiting
Mexico indicate that LITAMIL-9 is well and is employed by the
National Cultural Council.

has recently proposed that his salary cease accumulating

as of 30 June 1966. If and when he again manages t' leave

Cuba, he will be contacted and a full assessmeit of| his .

future usefulness will be made. Owing to the fact bbe pity cE
al

3. LITAMIL-9 is now an inactive agent. The iting

sister-in-law is a secretary to Fidel Castro it is
that he will be a valuable source of information, ie
for an initial debriefing period.

xpected

NS
4. It would be appreciated if the POA on LITAMIL-9
could be extended for six months. If at the end of| thaé&S
time he has not left Cuba, it will be proposed that theg
POA be allowed to expire. =

SUBJECT 2 Operational Approval for LITAMIL-9

1. An Operational Approval is requested for LITAMIL-9,
who has recently returned to Cuba, anc as accepted an FI
mission from Mexico Station. The Station has expressed its
reluctance to interview a Mexican officer who alleged|in
1959 that LITAMIL-9 was a Corzunist, since this coursé of

to our interest in LITAMIL-9, WiH/1 has concurred in this
decision, and considers that this unevaluated derogatory

mance record,

2, Realizing the risk involved in working with any
Cuban national, WH/1 feels that LITAMIL-9's excellent |record
of cooperation, plus his acceptance of tue idea of continued
cooperation in a denied area favor consideration of a:
. Operational Approval. Additionally, we have had audii
coverage through the telephone in LITAMIL-9's office for
the past two yeais or more, and during this time the §tation
= has used the installation for spot checking his information, :
and is satisfied that there are no reasons to question his
veracity and security or suspect that he is under control
of the Cuban service. ie

3. Attached fer your review are several contact
reports of LITAMIL-9, as requested by Mr. Lally. Thejj
: prompt return will be appreciated. This office will
Pleased to cooperate in any further review of this case

MEMORANDUM POR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: LITAMIL-9, Report of TDY, Andrew 8. Parmers|

1. During 21-26 February 1963, Andrew 8. P.
travelled from Headquarters to Kexico City on TDY to tha
LITAMIL-9 on various cland sting, operational, technique:
including SW. Upon arrival in Mexico City PARMERS agcbr
that LITAMIL=9 allegedly became of noral inbibitions, we

Sy
tained

puvilling to receive training and also vewilling to acbent the

SW_systwes Headquarters had issued for him, and which PA

HMERS

had carried to Mexico City. Neverthe'ess, PARWERS met! LITAMIL-9

three times to determine the agents precise objections] a
overcone them if possible. Although the agents geners
Tesiatance was not overcame. PARUERS Aid raviaw with
Clandestine methods and techniques in a general way.

2. The first meeting was held at the Statio:
officers home, with the Cage Officer present. LITAMILLO
Plained his reasons for refusing to be trained and for
being willing to communicate in SW with KUBARX while 4
Genera) ly LITAMIL-9 cJnimed that he is very norvous, aha
incapable of performing clandestine tasks without having
nervous breakdown and at the san- time getting himself lc:

ry
Rught

in the act because of his general incompetancy. Algo, |LITAMTL<9

was planning to stay at nis brothers home in Cuba, and|f,
it vould be unethical and immoral for him to be coxmunic.
Clandestinely with KUBARK while accepting the hospital ft
his brother and sister-in-law who are staunch supporters

elt
ating”
y of
of the

Castro regime. These szreesents obviously kad already |been

Presented to the Case Officer who h already conclud
LITAMIL-9 could not be moved from his Position. The ager
furthermore, felt that there was no need for training ar

that
nt
sw

Gince he would be returning to. Mexico after only three months

in Cuba. He displayed » cable he had just received fram his
father answering LITAMIL-9's query as to what might be |hi

bext assignment. The cable stated that LITAMIL~9 would mast
likely return to his present post in Mexico. .The agent, tg&re-
fore felt that upon his return to Mexico City, he could be
debriefed by his Case Officer. LITANIL-9 rejected all attempts
to convince him of ovr need for current info from insi incuba.
He was adanent when we pointed out that he might not rattirn to
Mexico City as hoped, but might havo to remain in Cuba having
Bo means of contact. If this happens he Plans to rem: his
position and return to Mexico as a private citizen, @ he

already is a registered “resident” of Mexico.

* SEGRE



-2-

: 3. On Priday, 24 February, PARKERS spent most of

i the day visiting alone with LITAWIS.~9 at the latter's apart—
ment. By the end of the day LITAMIL-9 had softened a little
aod kad revex'ed some of the personality traits montioned
below
Officer throvgs open code in letters to hia brother in Mexico!”

tH City. He aleo was willing to mect inside EUBARK; preferably
if the contact was s diplomat but not Cuban. He agre to
take a set of cuff links es bona fide: AB & suggestion, he
mentioned that his friend, The Swis: Ambassador, cov jserving
in Madrid, Spain, would be an ideal eontact. In reve ling how
euch @ contact could be performed ana in discussing LI{TAMIL-9
modus vevendi {a Cuba, there was coneiderablo discussions
concerning operational Security and clandestine procedures
LITAMIL-9 caB apply while in Cuba.

4. LITAMIL-9 during this meeting also presanted,
in logical seqvence, his reasons for believing that he will
return to Mexico Citw. Ranicallv. he facta that hataoen the
fact that he has many contacts in Mexico City (where he sas
H lived and worked for many year
| in-law in Cuba h a responsible position with considerable
influence in the Castro Government, he LITAMIL-9 wi)) [be re-

i assigned to his present post in M.-xico City after three months
i of leave, consultations, and training in Cu

5. The third meeting ocurred in the evening of

25 Februar., in a car pick up situation, with the Case Officer

1 present. This time, LITAMIL-9 was Jess willing to co; nicate
with KUBARK while in Cuba than be had been during the |previous
meeting, but with some reluctance, agreed to the use of open
code and to b= contacted by some diplomat. Thia meeting, there-
fore, was a routine operational meeting, with his Case Officer
in charge.

6. Based upon their three meetings, PARMERS formed
the following opinions of LITAMIL-9: fe is a shrewd dppor-
tunist, willing to colloborate with KUSARX against the Caatro
Government, but not to the point where his personal s.
is endangered. He dislikes the Castro Regime because
fumbled so bad'y, and because the current Cuban officilals are
crude and incompetant. He greatly admiros the American people,
but definitely. feels that we are merely concerned about cur
own nations! security and well-doing. LITAMIL~9 owes his
first loyalty to the fine arts, has little Patriotic feelings
| towards Cubs, since he has lived 1: lexico for mo many) y:
| and hss declared himself to b¢ a resident of Mexico. [He is

now serving tre Cuban Government simply because he bad an
opportunity (through his sister-in-law) to achieve official
Status and income and-still remain in Mexico where acut of his

LITKIL-9 also agreed to communicate with his Case-- “Gp ni"


. “33e*

Personal friends reside.

7. Although at first appearance, and according to

his own opinion ststemcats, LITAMIL-9 appears to be exztr ely

norvocs because of his clandestine activities in behalf df
KUBARK and against Cuba, after sone discu on 9t
that he actually relishes these clandestine actions that /|he
would have angaged in then long before he did, and that he

would have continued a covert relationship with KUBARE even after

Castro falls, rving either in Mexico (wher? he has man
contacts of foter-st to KUBARK) or in Cuba ia some post {n
Some future government, He has excellent rssport with his

»pparont

present KUBARK case officer. He statos that as long as KUBARK
remains willing to accent that he has defintt2 personel Jimi~

tations, (since ke can perform only those clandestine tasks
related to his cover and cannot be trained or induced toldo
anything eJse) he will gladly continue collaborating with
KUBARK as long as desired.

8. Actually, PAPWERS feels that LITAMIL-9 would
do most snything we would desire if KUBARK would s meday
establish soi control over him, His preseat remarks concer:

ton

his moral qualce are artificial. He has gr.
for_ebrewdners aad double play, and oponly

n Jife, On many occasi
he has accomodated himself to s situation for profit fe fee

he. knew that he could tura the tables eventually on his
versaries. When he is off-guard he admits to being a cod]

operater who can scheme and work behind bis adversaries’ |bac:
He shows many signs of enjoying doing what he does for and
with bis present KUBARK case officer,

9. Io summary, although LITAMIL-9 did not sce. pt
training or SW in the standard sense, PARMERS believes tiat
agents reluctance was based on his desire to take few risks.
The agent is competent, his moral inhibitioas are probab: iy
faked. He is convinced that he will return to Mexico ny
to continue serving KUBARK if no greater risk ts |in-

Since ZUBARK at oresent has no clear control coe

or ideological) over LITAVIL-9, it was difficult to impose
KUBARK's will over him. But he is very willin im ft
KUBARK within the limitations he g2ts, and tf eday can
atisfy. some personal need he might have, te bas the not lent
of becoming a good controlled agent for KUBARK. He ts 4 tel
Agent and by nature ho. seems to instinctivety conduct ht:
elandéestine operations in a secure manner.
