really dis " me was, number one, his comment, as I said befor.
tha Hersh tof@jhim that the thing that vga bothered him
about this storygfas that it came tehhe same source who

gave him the 22nd S€Apecember, wf identifying him, and the
fact that when he was ig thro} a. this business that he had
the best sources in the % ing: WV, that was Sidney Gottlieb,
and here was a rintee en, plutonium and the
scientist and all the ret’ of them,

And again, if hefaid have a Roo in that

area, that means hefwould have a live Sqlirce across the board.

When he asked me about my successor, told him that

I was not prepared to respond to that, that very new man was

have all the documentation that went to the Warren Commission

Senator Baker. Was there ever any inquiry? Or do you
have any opinion as to whether Oswald was a Soviet Agent?

the time factor, I will try to shorten this.

But I tried to prevail on Mr. Dulles that there should

the conclusions on the available evidence. But given the fac’
that the Soviet Government has a Department 13, which is under
the Central Committee, who is taxed with the assassination of
Western Leaders, that the door is open, and that is for future
generations to speculate. So that it would not be closing the
door, that it would really mean the investigation would be
pursued.

Senator Baker. John McCone, as I remember, was
queried once on whether we could establish the bona fides of
certain people, including Oswald.

Mr. Angleton. And Nosenko.

Senator Baker. Was there any advice by you at that
time to McCone or other wise that the bona fides of that
Soviet person or of Oswald ought not to be stated in cate~
gorical terms?

Mr. Angleton, During the period of the Warren Commission
we prevented as far as we could any information from Nosenko
going under the record, on a question of bona fides.

Senator Baker. Why?

Mr. Angleton, Because we didn't regard him as bona fides

Senator Baker. What did you regard him as?

Mr. Angleton. We thought he was a dispatch agent who
was sent to mutilated the leads. of very high grade Soviets
whom we had acquired prior to that.

alleged penetration in the U.S., et cetera.
Senator Baker. | And did McCone accept your advice?
Mr. Angleton, He did, except that I understood that
a lot of it has been declassified. And when he gave this
schart
interview recently with Shor, I called his executive officer
Elder and I asked him, and he said, who in the Agency ever
alleged to McCone that we now had re-established the bona fides
And I said, he is an old man and doesn't think too
well, et cetera, and don't give me that stuff.
And he said, well, I will give it to you.
And I never heard from him since. But McCone was a man
whowould not have made this statement. He has total recall.
Senator Baker. I am sure he does.
Do you have an opinion as to whether or not Oswald was
infact a Soviet agent?
Mr. Angleton. Well, let me put it this way.
I don't think that the Oswald case is dead. There are too
{
many leads that were never followed up. There's too much in- i
formation that has been developed later. |
For example, in 1966, in a Soviet book on Cuba there is
a photograph of Khrushchev, a photograph of Castro, a photograph

of a man called Alexiev, real name Shettov, KGB, with the first

soviet Ambassador to Havanay and a man named Leontov, who was

the soviet KGB operational man in Mexico. When the Mexican
police arrested Castro as a student, they found in his note~
books the name of Leontov, KGBr Mexico.

Now, photographs 61, and so ony are in a KGB journal for
soviet citizens abroad. It 1s a bible,75 percent KGB staff.
Photograph of Brezhnev, Castror Alexiev, Leontov.

Now, we had a double agent after the assassination,
who made a number of allegations that he acquired from the
Chief of KGB, Mexico, Yatskov and he was a superior of Leontov.
Now, after the assassination Khrushchev was in Cairo on a stat
visit. And he pulled an American journliist aside, and totally
out of context, expressed the view that there was a con~
spiracy, and it involved the Right Wing of the U.S.

the thingwas totally out of context. And he planted
this bug in this fellow's ear-

We had double agents who stated that the KGB put all of
their personnel for six months on working on the assassina—
tion, and had concluded that an American Right Wing business
under Johnson was to succeed in power. And I am not talking
‘about petty informants. I am talking about men whowere ascer-
tained members of the KGB and part of the Soviet elite.

And I can multiply that. Those cases, those leads have
never been followed up. One jis because of lack of manpower -

that there is no forum which can adjudicate issues in the -

I may have allegations, very firm, that relate to somebody in
high office. But there isn't anyone, ombudsman or somebody, to
whom you can gowith the information and talk to the Soviets and
pull the cag and ourselves and everybody together.

Senator Baker. Could you give us.at your leisure a memor~
andum of your recommendations in that respect, how that might
be constituded?

Mr. Angleton. It would not be a pleasant one. I have
submitted -- and I don't think it is breaking any confidence ~~
such a memorandum to the Commission. And I have submitted
a personal letter to the Vice prsident. And my whole plea
was that my days were numbered, but regardless, that in and
beyond the life of that Commission, that in his position as
Vice President he had a rare opportunity the first time these
matters were ever aired, and that the disaster of Hoover's death,

and Gray, and the Watergate and 60 forth, has destroyed the

What about the pictures, one of which was a picture of
Leontov that was in a piece of paper found in Mr. Oswald's
pocket when he was arrested in Mexico?

Mr. Angleton. There is an allegation.

Mr. Schwarz. What connection is there between that
picture and that allegation and Lee Harvey Oswald?

Mr. Angleton. The only thing is, Oswald's trip to Mexico |

was to go to Cuba allegedly to contact the Soviets. |

private, which would tend to absolve the Soviets of any
implication with Oswald.

Mr. Schwarz. When you acquired from a number of sources
the information that the KGB had spent some six months ~~

Me. Angleton. We, only acquired the hard stuff of six
months and what they did from one man who was very high in the |
KGB.

Mr. Schwarz. Without getting into what his name was,
when did you acquire the information?

Mr. Angleton. 1967, or thereabouts.

Mr. Schwarz. So it was after the Warren Commission had
reached its conclusions?

Mr. Angleton. Did you have any such information during
the life of the Warren commission?

Mr. Angleton. I think the only thing was the Nosenko ~~

Senator Baker. Which was suppressed by whom?

Mr. Angleton. We suppressed it, because Nosenko arrived

at a very brief time after the assassination as 2 KGB defector.
Senator Baker. And he is the one that you think now as
a planted agent?
tr. Angleton. Yes. They thought he was sent on e
mission.
Mr. Schwarz. Suppressed by whom?

Mr. Angleton. Suppressed from the Warren Commission.

Mr. Schwarz. You said that Nosenko, one of the reasons
you suspected Nosenko was a double agent, or @ planted agent,

rather, was because he was saying things that were contra~

dictory to some other high quality person who theretofore had
been giving you information before Nosenko came to this
country?

Mr. Angleton, That is right.

Mr. Schwarz. What was the nature of the information
relating to the Kennedy assassination that the high quality
person had given you?

Mr. Schwarz. Let me say this so that it makes a little
more sense.

In December 1961 a member of the KGB in Helsinki defected

except Jack Anderson came out with an erroneous account of it,
alleging that he had stated there was a plot to assassinate
Nixon. He did not make such a statement.

Mr. Kirbow. Do you think this statement should be on
the record?

tir. Angleton. 1 don't mind it being on the record after |
the Anderson article. They have been looking for him.

Now, his is probably without any ee the most major

defection since World War II as far as soviet intentions,

Soviet organization, and Soviet operations are concerned.

And the reason, among others, that it was so important was

he had decided to defect many years prior to December of 1961,
if the opportunity ever arrived. And therefore he used those
many years breaking down the compartmentalization of the KGB
in order to acquire the kind of information which would be most
valuable to the US, and to our allies.

Therefore he refused many assignemtns abroad, but tried
to always remain in headquarters and get himself appointed to
investigative commissions and other things of this sort which
would get into everybody elses's business. Among other things
he spent many years in the training schools for people who
came back for six weeks from different parts of the world to
brag about their achievements. And he absorbed all of this
information.

And among other things, he stated that he gave the

erytograms and circumstantial evidence of penetrations

throughout the West.

And then the Soviets rapidly transferred 300 of their
people after his defection. And as is normal in a case of
this kind, the big problem is to write a damage report, which

means the whole service would come to a standstill. And the

objective would he to review all paper files md everything thay

Now, when we did a similar operation on the Sergeant
puniép who was working in the National Security Agency and
committed suicide, if I am not mistaken we came to approxi-

Mr. Angleton. After his suicide. I am sorry.

Mr. Miller. You used the term assassination.

Mr. Angleton. I meant suicide.

Mr. Miller. The word is interesting, because it is

Maybe I was thinking out loud or something

question of whether he passed them before or after.

Mr. Schwarz. Now, what we were on was, I was asking you, |

Mr. Angleton. I just wanted to say Golitzkn was so

enormous to the Western world because we immediately moved on |



those cases which were perishable, the French, the British,
and ourselves, et.cetera, And we had never had a second chief
pirector, which means the FBI type of Soviet, defector in our
lives, and all of this out of the blue, and no contact as in
Geneva six months after the defection of colitzen-

ur. Schwarz, And the date is when in relations to the
Kennedy assassination?

Mr. Angleton. Well, this was a contact, this was not a
detection. He came to us once for information prior to the
assassination.

And then in Moscow the Soviets -- and T am not going
into a lot of names, a member of the Second Chief Directorate,
gave an American tourist @ stack of documents from the Second
chief Directorate, the FBI, relating to how they got

and others of our agents, which showed
they didn't get them through @ two-headed source, but they got
it through a on our side.

so the leads rant into the thousands from coritzén,
and thousands and thousands of pages of transcript, interro-
gation, exhibiting photographs, and identifications, which in

turn would refresh his memory on other courses. And out of

that ceme the finalization of the case of Philby, Burgess, and

all that, the Vassily case in the British Admiralty, and some

other cases, and many cases in France and so on.

Mr. Kirbow. Did Oswald show up at that time?

Angleton. No, not from Golitsi
when the assassination took place --
Mr. Schwarz. The Kennedy assassination?

Mr. Angleton. When the Kennedy assassination took place,

Golitégn called me immediately and stated that the modus

operandi with any defector from anybody's army to the Soviet
Union’ required that he go through processing by the 13th
Department of the KGB.

Mr. Schwarz. Which is their assassination department?

Mr. Angleton. Which is their assassination department,
which is called their Affairs for Executive Action.

And there are two reasons for it. Number one was, to
find out what sophisticated weaponry or training he might have
had that would be of use to them. And number two, whether it
was more valuable to reinfiltrate him into the National Army
for future activity.

Mr. Schwarz. Of the nature of assassinations?

Mr. Angleton. Of anything. It could be sabotage, or
intelligence, or whatever.

AND THIS WAS THE SOP on the dealing with military
defectors. :

Now. when the Soviet Government turned over to the US
all the documents that led to the interest regarding Oswald
stay in the Soviet Union, there was nothing there indicating

processi‘ng by Department 1}. Then after the assassination

Nosenko, whom we hid once in Geneva, ha went back to Moscow.

And in my view he would have never come back on the scene
HE AG FAO

pecause they brought this Cheraponov thing in to have the locus

shifted from where we would have controls, in Geneva, to

Moscow where they would have all the controls. And that would

be the Directorate. And therefore they would have the direct

means of counteracting and mutilating the leads and the

importance of Golitzen's defection.

But the tourist gave the documents to the American
embassy. And we photographed them. The Charge insisted on
giving them back to the Soviets on grounds that it would be
appropriate.

Me. Schwarz. These are not the official documents deal-

ing with Oswald but the documents that ‘the man tried to pass

in Switzerland?

tir. Angleton. The Second Chief Directorate, he took all
of the documents out of the Far Soviet section and gave them
to the tourist and we read how we got caught on things.

So there is the assassination. Cheraponov allegedly
wag chased to the Turkish border and shot. And in my view
Mirai otaimyen jipecause anil afli ches eens was stationed in
Belgrade, and he tried to defect to us. and at another time
tried to establish liaison and contact with the Birtish MI-6,
at a time when Philby was Chief of Intelligence, meaning

that the approach would have been under Philby in 1948, and



1, $.£., Warminaton, B,C, 20003

then he reappears in the early 1960's as a member of the
Second Chief Directorate.

That is enough of Cherapanov. But it is important only
from the Soviet point of view, the best laid plans fall apart.

And then out of the blue, Nosenko,’ whom we would never ha
seen again, reappears after the assassination in Geneva, and
tells us he wants to defect.

Mr. Schwarz. And he provided information which was

inconsistent with Oswald being the Russian agent?

Mr. Angleton. I am mn) to that.

So immediately we tried to get the breadth of his career
so that we know where the priorities are. And the first thing
he tells us is that while he was in_the Second Chief
Directorate in the American Section, Oswald's KGB dossier went
over his desk. And his first story, as I recall it, was that
it was two volumes or three volumes. And finally if went down
to one volume and a small sheaf of papers.

Also he said that the dossier showed clearly that Oswald
was mentally unbalanced, and that he was a poor shot, and
therefore couldn't get a hunting license, and a lot of stuff
of this sort.

And then on all of these outstanding leads -- penetra-
tions, of the French, the Americans, the British codes, bugging
of the Embassy, all of these different sorts -- Nosenko had

something to do which diverted us from Nosenko's leads. And

op
in the normal course of events, we might have put Golitzen in
contact with Nosenko, which may have meant the assassination
of Golitzen, because the whole approach of Nosenko was one
where logically you would bring them in and have two bodies,
one from the First Chiéf Directorate, that is, Golitzdn, the
CIA part of the system, and the other from the FBI part of the
system, and therefore you would have a very strong balance
against the KGB. But we didn't do that. Because there were
certain things, litmus papers, questions put to Nosenko. And
as far as I was concerned, if he was bona fide he would have
answered one way, and he did not answer that way. And they ha
to do with some deeper secrets regarding a meeting of the
2000 members of the KGB and the Soviet Government in May of
1959, presided over by Shelepin and attended by many members
of the Central Committee on the reorientation of the Soviet
Services and the return to Leninism wherever intelligence
oparations has a political objective. And this is a part of
the process of de-Stalinization, And so when we took him
unwittingly chronologically through his career, he :omits
all of this phase. and we had three or four or five other tes
things, where their damage report would not show that Golitzén
had access, because it was part of his way of getting in and
breaking compartmentation. And therefore they would have no
evidence that he had sufficient knowledge.

Mr. Schwarz. And so Nosenko looked funny to you, he

looked wrong to you?

Mr. Angleton. Absolutely.

Mr. Schwarz. He looked like a plant to you?

Mr. Angleton. Precisely.

Mr..Schwarz. And among the information that he provided
to you was that Oswald was a mental case and was a bad shot?

Mr. Angieton. Right.

Mr. Schwarz. And you had also received from Nosenko -~

Mr. Angleton. Guiteedaectecom Golitzdn -- information
that suggested the normal practice was for Department 13,
which had responsibility from the Russian KGB for assassina~
tions, to interview miveitary defectors. And © we had observed
that when the Russians transferred documents concerning
Oswald, that there was no reference in there to any such
debriefing by Department 13. And another important part of
it is that there was a man who was handling George Blake from
London, who was Counselor of the Soviet Embassy. And when he
returned he became head of the 13 Department, General Rodin.
But he was there under an alias as a civilian. He was the
Chief of the KGB in London, and a very high grade man. Then
he took over the Department 13 and reinvigorated it.

Mr. Schwarz. And what was his connection with Oswald?

Mr. Angleton. I am saying that he was head of Department
13, and was head of Department 13 at a time ~~ I mean, he had

a long history in that, in other words, the prominence of



pmone (Area 202) 544-6000

12

Department 13 and this is 4 point I think I should make, that
the Agency, unlike the Soviets, does not have an assassination
department. The Soviets have always had an assassination
department, which is totally sealed off from the rest of the
organization. People from the outside knew very little about
what goes on in that. People career-wise stay in there. And
they report to the Chairman of the KGB, and drop off, who ‘in
turn report to the Politboro. And therefore it is an entirely
sealed organization which is capable of all forms of action,
whether it be sabotage ~~ an illegal sabotage or what, an
illegal directorace which is independent of the rest of the
KGD -- nuclear sabotage, and all this type of thing, and
infiltration of enemy forces in the event of war. And of
course assassination, the assassination of Ukrainian leaders
in West Germany-

Mr. Schwarz. Do you recount that simply because it makes
more significant the apeence of any reference to Oswald becaus'

you are giving evidence a5 to the vigor of Department 13, oF

did you recount it because there +5 @ more direct connection
with Oswald?

eee eee et ened eee I told Mr. Dulles,
I thought it was absolutely wrong te close the door on the
Life of the Commission, and instead there should be a statement
that_we are not in a position ~~ that on the fact available to

us during the given period, these are our conclusions. And

then to spell out in detail Department 13 and its organization

-- and the burden of proof shigts. But not only the burden

of proof, but you never know when a worm goes into somebody's
head to defect from Department 13. And that pring you up on
the entire story. i

Mr. Schwarz. So you have recounted the importance of
Department 13. You have recounted the significance in your
mind of the absence of any reference to Department 13 in the
documentation on Oswald turned over by the Soviets to the US.
and you have recounted the strange nature of the information
provided by Nosenko.

Mr. Angleton. Correct.

Mr. Schwarz. Let me ask you another line of questions
about each one of these items. As to the Nosenko information,
you stated that that information was suppressed from the
Warren Commission?

Mr. Angleton. The word suppression is probably not the
right word because, I will be very honest with you, I was told
the other day that the information was given classified, and
it was given to Helms or somebody, oF Mr. MeCone, who passed
it as a classified document. 1 have asked for it, but I
haven't seen it~

ur. Schwarz. Why did you say a moment ago that it was
suppressed?

Mr. Angleton. Because I never knew where it went. When



Prone (Aras 202) 544-6000

b.€., warninatan, O:€, 20003

uu

Iwas sitting in the position as to where that information
would go, I was opposed to it. And my pffictal position was
that. And I ghought until relatively recently that it never
went.

And then all of a sudden they have declassified a lot of
stuff. And Mr. nbcha, who was the point of record of the
agency's dealing with the Warren Commission, told me that
Nosenko stuff was the stuff they were declassifying. Now, his
role was not one of the executive nature. Actually it was
simply because he was a great scholar and a great many other
things, and therefore he had the most catholic background to
handle something as eomplex as the Warren Commission, not in
exercising executive power, but working on behalf of the
Director and all the Directorates and everything pertaining
to the Warren Commission. He is a tidy individual. And in
fact Mr. Belin has made a great deal of use of him in the
Commission's business, and he is the one that ‘had done all the
digging for the Commission, and so on, on a whole series of
matters that I am not familiar with.

But my point.to you -- and this is very difficult to
explain -- is that the question of Nosenko created a very

great division in the life of all counterintelligence as to

bona fides, as in all questions of when you are dealing with

double identification agents, there is always dispute.

fut let me just line up the order of battle here. Our



Prone (Arse 202) $44-4000

S10 Fornh Streets Soba, wayminatom, 8:6, 20002

Chief of the Soviet Division accepted the fact that the man
was a provocation. His Chief of Counterintelligence accepted
the fact that the man was a provocation.

Mr. Schwarz. Do you mean provocation, or providing
false information?

Mr. Angleton. An Agent Provocateur.

I said he was false. My man said he was false. And it

isn't a parrot affair, each one reads the same stuff and

analyzes and come to their own conclusion. and colitgén,

who defected, based only on the Geneva, first encounter in
Geneva, not the defection, had predicted in advance that
because of the enormity of his defection they would send a
provocateur into the West to destroy and mutilate his leads.

So it was a question of awaiting, you might say, who
knocks on the door. And here is Nosenko.

Now, since then the Chief of the Soviet Division who is
no longer there, has recantéd in a way -- the Inspector
General went into all this -- he is today the NIO dealing in
Soviet Affairs, the National Intelligence Officer on Soviet
Affairs. And his counterintelligence man, a fellow named
Pete Bagley, who is the brother of the two Admirals Bagley,
and one of the best men we had, left the Agency and is now
in Belgium in private life. And I can go all the way through
these other people who have been dispersed. But the record

will clearly reflect that the preponderance of all individuals



ss 202) $44-6000

Fy

preet, 3:64, Warmington, 0.¢, 20002

was that Nosenko was sent on a mission.

Mr. Schwarz. And provided false information?

Now, is it your current understanding that what was
provided to the Warren Commission was the raw infomration
brought by Nosenko, or was the Warren Commission also provided
with the opinion of persons such as yourself and others as you
have recounted that he was providing false information?

Mr. Angleton. I don't think the Warren Commission was
ever faced with the issue of the internal issues of corsegdn
or Nosenko.

Mr. Schwarz. You first said that the information was
suppressed from the Warren Commission, and then you said no,
it is your understanding now -~

Mr. Angleton. Well, the word suppression isn't the right
word, I said. One went to argue the matter and it was agreed
by higher authority that the information shouldn't be --

Senator Mathias. There was a value judgment made as to
the usefulness of the material?

Mr. Angleton. That is right -- and not to do what the
Soviet in our mind wanted us to do, which fas to give dt
prominence and have it come out as an official part of the
record and documents and articles, and so on.

Mr, Schwarz. But your current understanding 1s that the
information was provided?

Mc. Angleton. That was classified, and never came out in



Prone (Ares 202) 544-6000

Jt. 5.0, Wannenaton, 0.€. 20003

Mr. Schwarz. But was nevertheless provided to the
Commission?

Mr. Angleton. It was made known to them in some fashion.

Mr. Schwarz. Was it made known to them at the same time
that at leat certain experts withing the Agency thought it
was false information?

Mr. Angleton. I think, as I understand it now, that in
spite of our feelings, either Helms or McCone made a
presentation of it.

Mr. Schwarz. But without mentioning your feelings,
certain experts thought that it was false?

Mr. Angleton. I can't respond to that. I don't know.

Mr. Schwarz. What about the information derived from
Golitzen, which indicated in your expert opinion that the
documents provided by the Soviet Union were, I think you put
it, funny, or strange, or misleading, because they did not
include any reference to debriefing by Department 13, was that
information provided to the Warren Commission?

Mr. Angleton. I don't know. I don't think so. But all
I can say there is this, to be realistic. No one would expect
the Soviet Government, regardless, to provide documents,

secret documents, on Oswald, whether he was or was not their

agent. And I say, I can go all the way back through history,

the way they falsified the official record, they had it with

the Italians in 1923, Constatinople, and cases on diplomatic
issues, the complete thing was fabricated, and so on. And 1
there fs no way of testing them, the security is such that
they can't be tested.

So we are not under any illusions of expecting them to
state that he went through the 13 Department, which asked him
the following questions.

Mr. Schwarz. So you say that as far as that matter goes
there is no possibility that anybody on the Warren Commission
was fooled?

Mr. Angleton. I mean, I don't think anybody was. I

ace
didn't follow the Warren Commission, Rocha followed it, and he
was running over there all the time, Gnaleolon|

Mr. Kirbow. Let me ask you. There would have been no
reason why anyone on the Warren Commission would have known
that as a matter of everyday business that they did in fact
run every defector through Department 137

Mr. Angleton. I don't think we ever told them. But you
see, Allen Dulles -- that is what I am coming to -- I used to
see Allen Dulles regularly, and I was an advisor officially
to him on a lot of headaches, and I dida lot of leg work for
him. And I regarded him as a very personal friend. And I am
Executor of his papers, among other things.

But the point I am coming to is, to try to give him

guidance of what the jungle is around here in terms of the



Prone (Area 202) 544-6000

Lip Fant Sree, 5.6. wasminatan, 0.€, 20003

FBI's position and Mr. Hoover's, and 80 on, so that he would
be more sensitive to the things, no longer being Director,
that were no longer germain to his position on the matter.

Mr. Schwarz. Was there a connection between the FBI and
Oswald?

Mr. Angleton. I don't know the full FBI story. I know
there was a tremendous flap in the Bureau. And one of the bes
men they had in my view is a professional a man called Burt
Turner, who I understand just got his law degree. And Burt
Turner was one of the finest men on Soviet KGB activities in
the US, one of the analyzts. And he was in the Washington
Field Office. And it is my understanding -- and this is
basically hearsay, but from pretty good sources -- that Burt
Turner was handling the Oswald ore’ related matters at the time
the President made the trip down to Texas, and that there was
some confusion that the Bureau had not turned over, or had

not taken enough initiative in turning over, all the informa-

tion on Oswald to the local police. I had been told that

there was a black mark put against Turner's name, and that he
confronted Mr. Hoover and stated he was not going to permit,
or have it be known to his children, that his negligence was
responsible for the death of the President. And he was pretty
forceful about his position. And as a result, this was
expunged or something to that effect. And that is the reason

he went to the Washington Field Office instead of staying in

Headquarters.

And then he retired. And I think his retirement had
something to do with this fact.

But this is all by virtue of hindsight with the thousands
of cases. And I cannot see any Western intelligence service
seizing on facts that Oswald will return to the US, and then
going and saying, we will get all of this, and we will send
it to Texas.

What I am trying to say, is that the difference in their
system, With the manpower and the computers, which are mainly
ours, and whatnot, a situation of that sort is automatic. And
we know enought’ about the Second Chief Directorate and the
controls, the total controls, to know that if a Soviet returne
automatically, to any part of the Soviet Union he went, there
would be a dossier that would go, and there would be also an
operational directive to put him on tap, check his mail, to
do the following, and so on and to put an agent near him.
There wouldn't be any leaking anything in the air on that.
There would be tcetal encapsulation of that individual until
it was ceratin beyond a shadow of a doubt that he was not sent
back as an agent.

Mr. Schwarz. A moment ago in talking about the line-up,
as I think you put it, ‘of views on Nosenko, you recounted the
views of a number of people. And you said that one person
had changed his mind or recanted subsequently. And you made

a reference in that connection to an Inspector General's



Prone (ares 2021 544-6000

report. What was that report?

Mr. Angleton, At one stage in all of this -- and it was
much later, after all the dust settled -- Helms got the
Inspector General, who had come from the clandestine side of
our business, to institute -- I don't like to use the word
inspection, it is too authoritative -- to go into the Nosenko
matter and see if there is anything there that he should know,
because Helms is fully aware of the split on this whole
question of bona fides, and it bothered him, because I had
brought him in touch with Golitzen, and he was fully aware of
all my activities, and travels and so on.

And so this person who was chosen began to interview

everybody and reopen the whole thing. I mean, there were 21

safe leads of stuff if you really got into all of the Golitzen

and Nosenko and the other things that pertained, as I pointed
out. to the Warren Commission, to the asininity of what has
happened, of 27 years of experience of myself and my two

colleagues, that these are the facts, that there are 20 cases

Mr, Schwarz. You said Warren Commission. You mean
Rockefeller?

Mr. Angleton. Excuse me, Rockefeller.

There are 20 some odd cases that a counterintelligence
officer in our busienss should know before he even begins to

get his feet wet.



Now, when Dr. Schlesinger came in, and I started hearing
all of these things of manaement by objectives, and synergisti
and a lot of other things, being applied to the art forms which
we had developed, I finally got so frustrated that I thought
I would take him up on his own thing. So I got statisticians
in to take all the safes and figure out the linear footage of
every safe drawer, all the way on through, and to computerize
how long it would take the normal case officer to come up to
this elemental stage of being able to be launched.
that was sort of a preparatory business. And they

figured it out and they said it would take 22 man years, we

meant that if we were 100 percent incorrect, it would be 11

man years. And that was simply to apprise Schlesinger, and

Mr. Angleton. He knew, because even before I went into

this I told him what I was going to do, and he agreed, and

ud also I wanted a person, because there was a radio
put into Havana, and let somebody say we need a
radio in Havaty, or drop some men in. And then the point is,
I get the radio to and to Havana and then put it
someplace, and then tell him, you go to such and such a place

and find the radio, and then have some men come in and call

some men to make contact, with the view that I couldn't trust

you went up and made a fuss to Mr. McCone about.

Mr. Schwarz, Did you know Mr. Harvey pretty well, was
he someone you knew?

Mr. Angleton. Very well indeed, In fact, I just

Mr. Schwarz. I heard that.

Did you know anything about his usé of underworld

Mr. Schwarz. At the time did you know of that?

Mr. Angleton. Simply the Bureau, the FBI, ran a
surveillance. And Sam Papich, who was the Liaison Officer
_ of the FBI, who is now Head of the Criminal Commission in
faces was at my house around 10 o'clock at night. And the

Washington Field Office or Headquarters Miami located Papich
at my house. They were absolutely boiling, because they had
surveiled the Mafia all the way from California to National

Airport, and he had got off the plane and was met by a man who

what to do.

Mr. Schwarz. That was Mr. Roselli, was it?

Mr. Angleton. T think it was.

ur. Kirbow. And the Bill you speak of here is Bill
Harvey?

Mr. Angleton. Bill Harvey<

So I could get the gist of Bill's questions to them. And
I told him -- I made a motion to put his hand over the phone
and not to let them discuss it. And I said, tell them not to
do anything until they hear from you.

And that is what he told them, he said; stand down on
this and I will be back in touch.

And then Bill told me the whole story in detail of how
he had gone over from California and followed him in this
thing, and how Harvey had put him in his car and he went off.

Mr. Schwarz. That was in 1973 shortly before Mr. Harvey
went to Rome?

Mr. Angleton. It wasn't shortly before, it was, I think
quite a long time before.

So then I told Sam, I said, look, let's go very easy on
this -- because I didn't know anything about Bill's connection
with the Mafia and all that, but 1 aid know him well enough

to know that he was not a frivolous man, and that this thing

happened, and keep in mind that ex-FBI men, contrary to public

opinion, were not very much liked by Mr. Hoover when they left

So I called Bill's house, and I asked his wife, is Bill
around?

And she said, no, he is out to dinner tonight.

And I said, look, we have some very serious trouble.
Would you please tell me where I can locate him.

And she said, he is at Duke Zeibert's. And I called
Duke Zeibert's and I managed to get him. And I turned the
phone over to Papich, because I did not want to be on the
record showing that this was Angleton, et cetera.

And Papich talked to Bill, and actually I didn't hear
the discussion. It was something about, I will see you
tomorrow.

And Sam told the surveillance and all the other people
to forget it, and the Headquarters would take over.

And that is my knowledge, direct knowledge of what
Anderson and everybody else has stated.

did Bill ever attempt to use the excellent contact he had in

the meantime.
I have just a couple of questions that I would appreciate
it if Mr. Angleton would give us his evaluations as an expert
on. And they go back to his testimony relative to the Kennedy
assassination.
hs I recall, you said that immediately after the assassi-

nation Golitzgn'on his own initiative communicated with you

street, 5:€., Wainimaton, 0.€. 20003

and advised you that it was normal practice for a defector who

had a military background to be processed in Department 13?



Prone (Ares 202) 544-4000

19, 0.6. 70003

Mr. Angleton. Interrogated, or processed;

Senator Mathias. And that the implication certainly of
this was that Oswald was an ex-Marine, and had been through
this process, and that therefore at least that he might have
been acting within the context of the Soviet plan, is that

right?

Mr. Angleton. That is the thrust of what he was trying

to say. His English is such that it 18 very difficult.

Senator Mathias. I understand. But then some years
later -- my recollection is that you said it was in 1967 or
1969 -- you learned that the KGB had spent six month of
employment of their top operators in the investigation of the
Kennedy assassination, and wouldn't this fact in your mind
negate the implication of the. original Golitzdh call or that
they were involved?

Mr. Angleton, I want to congratulate you, because that
man is a man who is also a suspect of Nosenko.

Senator Mathias. You mean in 1967?

Mr. Angleton. Just to show you the ground you are
treading on, Golitzen gave us informatian regarding the
penetration of our own organization. And we worked down to an
identity. And the FBI disagreed with us. And I am talking
about not a few minutes, but several weeks and months of work.
And the Bureau's attitude was, you have got the wrong man, and

the allegation therefore does not affect the CIA, and we



Prone (Ares 202) $44-6000

3
8
i

9, 0.€. 20003

advise that you send it to the Army.

And I might add, the man who wrote that memorandum was
the Burt Turner I mentioned who was one of the competent
FBI analysts. So it was in limbo. And we stated that “X”
was the penetration agent, and the Bureau refused to accept
that. And in 1967 a Soviet -- on whom we had a dossier on thig
thing, because he was once stationed in India, and therefore
we knew who he was, and all the rest of it -- with an unknown
coming to us as Nosenko was, he was a real man, we had years
of surveillance on him, and so on. And he came, and he
alleged -- and he was a 7c, temporary duty in Washington

here -- and he established contact with the first Mrs. Helms.
And eventually I was called to take the case. And he stated

that among his missions to the US was to effect the redefectiol
or the return to the Soviet Union of a man, and that man was
the man whom we had identified as a Soviet agent. And he went
into the whole background, that this man was one of the
highest grade illegals that they had ever had, and he was in
our Agency.

So this had a tremendous impact on Burt Turner, because
he was one of the two intérrogating officers. And I can't
talk to you about professional pride, but for a man of his
competence to have done it the wrong way, that hurt.

So I had a question injected, which was, what do you know

about George Blake?



410 Fst Street, S.€., Waymnaton, 0.C. 20003

And then his response was, he says, wa th

Now, hwere is a man who 1s supposed to be Special
Assistant to the Head of Counterintelligence {n KGB, whose
mother was a secretary to Litvinov, and he comes therefore
from the aristocracy, as Nosenko does, because his father was
the Minister of Maritime Affairs. And there is a statue of
Nosenko's father. And Golitzen had told us that men chosen
for very dangerous missions of penetration and duplicity came
from the aristocracy. Everyone trusted them, and their father
and their families are heroes of the Soviet union.

So here was this man who said as to Blake, we think he is

dead.

Two to three weeks later is when Blake escaped from

Scrubb's Woods to the Soviet Union. Now, if he had come to

the US to exfiltrate as the Special Assistant to the Head of
Counterintelligence, to exfiltrate a person who worked in
the West as an illegal from the end of World War II, and
gradually worked into us, why wouldn't he have known the

re
exfiltartion plans of George Blake, which would have been

simultaneous, because he was a Headquarters man here on TOC.
So we handled him for six or seven weeks.
And some of the most telling parts of the interrogation
was that when he went back to the Soviet Union he would have

access to archives. And what was on our mind, and what

cryptonym that we wanted him’ to work up -- and this would



Prone (Ares 202) 544-6000

relate to the third Part of the damage Part on Golitzen -~

what ‘did Golitzen know that they did not know he knew? What
agents in the West could be under our control as a result of
Golitzen's disclosures regarding those things?

And you can see the tremendous quality this man had of
almost getting from our man those four or five erytonyms,
which would have told them what they wanted to know, because
there are cases they are not sure whether he knows or doesn't
know, and so on. And these are officials, and so on.

So he wasn't given that. He was given staff that was
Sort of medium low level stuff, you couldn't call it chicken
feed but we never told him we disbelieved in him. and he
said, if you do those things for me, I have an opportunity,
because of my mother and so on, to become Head of the American
Department of the KGB.

And the other thing he wanted, was, we took him to the
Soviet Agency and we came out later for contacts, and he state.
there was a telegram there, and he had been requested to
acquire all the information possible on the whereabouts of
Golitzen and Nosenko. And I was actually in Wisconsin. And
T called my Deputy long distance and I said, if there is any
proposal Put up by that individual that would expose -- and I
use the crytonym name of Golitzen -- don't.
