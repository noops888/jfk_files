Cear Sirs

Information hae been received that a committee fo circulating
appeals to the Canadian pedple asking for contributione for drugs =

. to be sent to Cuba, implying that supplies have been cut off and

that the Cuban people cannot get such drugs because the United Sta
tes rofuses to purchase sugar, The committee is called the Modi“
cal Aid to Cuba Committee, Station B, P. O, Box 4, Toronto. 2B, -
Ontario,

‘As. a member of tho Cuban: exile communisy and one intimates
ly informed of the oituation in Cuba, I sliould like to set this matter
straight and point out the fallacy of this supposedly humanitarian =
work which may be vietimizing the Canadian people;

The hypocrisy of thie appeal ia ovidént to anyone who has studied

* tha economic policiéa of the Cuban government, which prefers to put ito

avallable foreign exchange intc the purchase of guns and tanks rather
than into food and drugs for its people.

Tho alleged argument that the cutting off of ougar purchase:
by the United States has prevented the purchase of drugs 19 fallacious
since the Cuban Government boasts of its considerable gale of sugar
to the Soviet Union which prides: iteolf on ite scientific progr
With this foreign exchange available for Cuba, l@ the Soviet Union -
unable, of io It unwilling to send drugs to Caba?

Frrthermore, Fresident Kennedy has epecifically stated that -
there would be no total embargo placed on Cuba aa he intended that
food and medicines be sent to Cuba since he had no quarrel with the
Cuban poopie but only with their Communist dominated government.
There te ample exchange available to Cuba, for example from tremen
dous sales of tobacco to the United States. Moreover drugs are being

ent to Cuba,

Let our friends the Canadiana not be victimized by thie propa-

behind the appeals being made by the Ledicdl Ald to Cuba Committee,

Sincerely yours,
