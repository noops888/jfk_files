INPORMANES

PCI RAYMOND L, ROLLING, contacted on 10/13,
27/58 and 11/10/58 advised-that he frequents the Town
and Country Restaurant on the basis of three or four
times per week at night. He stated that he frequent-
ly observes PECORARO at the restaurant in the company
of the proprietor, JOSEPH PORETTO and CARLOS MARCELLO
(top hoodlums). Informant stated he is not aware of
any exertion of pressure on local gamblers by PECORARO
at this time.

CI WO 1075-C advised on 10A4/58 that PHILIP
ARENA, locally charged with peddling narcotics, said
he was unable to obtain any assistance from PECORARO
in making bond, Informant advised that ARENA said
his bond was posted by JUNIOR KERNER of Gretna, La.,
that KERNER possesses oil lands in Louisiana, and
was formerly connected with professional gambling
operations in the New Orleans area.

GI NO 1126-C on 11/17/58 advised SA RAY
E, ROCKHOLD that concerning the operation of the
Chesterfield Club, gambling house in Jefferson
Parish, the dice game at the club was operated until
about a month ago by JESSE SHOEMAKER, wealthy gambler
from Memphis, Tem. ' Informant advised that SHOE-
MAKER said he pulled out of the Chesterfield Club
as. he had made a substantial roll while there and
because he did not want to cause any "family strife".
Informant stated that SHOEMAKER did not elaborate on
the term "family strife". Informant further stated
that if SHOEMAKER did have any trouble with JOE
PECORARO, or anyone else, he would not reveal any
such occurrence to even his closest friends, In-
formant said that his previously reported conversa-
tion with PECORARO was considered an effort by
PECORARO to bring pressure upon him to keep hin
from operating dice games at the Chesterfield Club.
Informant advised that this effort by PECORARO had
nothing to do with informant not operating at the
Chesterfield Club, but rather informant found a
better spot in which to operate at Baton Rouge, La.
