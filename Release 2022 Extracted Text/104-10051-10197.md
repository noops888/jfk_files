fo do in the Gonsulate,

1. Om 26 June Costille invited Golub to have lunch
Restaurant in Helsinki, as it was Costille’s +
first remarks concerned the amount of he
as he was alone there now since Mikha Golub
stated that Lyubinov had nwy obtained the dinlomstic titls of Third Seore-
texy_and was currently in Moscow for some training prior to a FCS sasiegmient

Golub

stated that he missed Lyubimov tremendously both office-wise and personally.
He waa very fond of Iyubimov end often remarked what an intelligent young
man he wase

The conversation then turned to Costille’s recent vacation in Lapland.
Golub again told Costille that he was not going to be able to take a
vacation this year as the new Arbassador wanted Lim to remain in Helsinki.
Golub then stated to Costille, "I have heard that you speek fluent Russian.”
Costille stated that thet was very complimentary but that he spoke about

as good Russian as Golub spoke English. Costille told him that he had
studied Russian at the University of California and on his own but that
about all he could do now was understend end read sone and that whet little
speaking ability he had was practically gone. Golub commented it was

good that Costille knew some Russian end said that more Americans should
study it, Golub then asked why Costille was not trying to improve his
Russian. Costille answered that he was trying to learn to speak Finnish
and that 4 was too mich of a chore to study two languages at the seme time,
Golub said that what Costille neeied was more practice in Russian and pro-
ceeded to speak in Russian, In actuality Costille’s Russian has decreased
considerably and he was able to easily convince Golub that his Russian wes
far from fluent. As was mentioned in previous dispatches, Costille had
never attempted to conceal from Golub the fact that he knew Russian. The
dasue just never came up. Since Golub is fluent in Finnish, the common
language automatically became Finnish. If we had realized this Golub
contact was going to be so frequent, we would have made it a point at the
first to be the one to tell Golub that Costille knows some Russian, This
might have made Golub a little suspicious, At the last meeting Costille
had mentioned to Golub that he had been studying Russien some, Golub

did not respond, so evidently he either did not hear or understand Costille,

23, Golub asked Costille what other languages he had studied. Costille told
him he had studied Spanish in high school. Golub eald that thie was an
easy lenguage and not studied too mich in the Soviet Union. After making
this remark, he quickly corrected himself and stated that a large percentage
of the world spoke Spanish end that it was becoming a much more populer
language in the Soviet Union. Costille mentioned thet Russian had become
a very populer language in the States and that within the last two years
his high echool in California, which was quite small, even vas offering the
Russien lenguege, This seemed to impress Golub.

“4. While speaking Russian to Costille, Golub began using the familiar form of
the language rather than the polite form which the two had always used. He
looked at Costille and asked if 4t would 3 alright to use first names,

When Costille ogreed, he reached across table and shook Costille’s

hand, He then told Costille that there was a nay Cultural Officer in the
Sovict Embassy by the name of who wanted to meet soms young
Western Eubassh officers, especially Americans. Golub stated that he had
givon him Costi\le’s name and that Costille would be receiving a written
invitation from Yegel to attend a showing at the Soviet Enbassy of a

was free that evening and would like to attend and meet Zegal.

5. Golub also mentioned that his wife was going back to the Soviet Union for a
‘two months rest and vacation and thet he wes going to be a bachelor again for
that period. He stated that he waa glad to get rid of her for a while becruse
she "bothered" him and that now he could bring home whom he wanted and do what
he wanted. He stated that since Costille end he were both bachelors they
could "have some good times together".

6. Just before the two parted efter lunch Golub stated that he had heard from
Moscow about his report of what he termed "the Volodya incident". (See
OFHA-3819), He seid that Volodya had benn callcd in and properly chastized.
When Costille asked Golub what would happen to Volodya, Golub responded that
he didn’t know. Golub also stated that Moscow asked him how Costills was
able to deduce that his room vas being searched at that partiouler time.
Costille stated that it didnt take an amateur detective to figure that oat.
Golub laughed and agreed.

7. +... Please-sée:reference A concerning the AEPAWNEE/S and AEPAWNEE/3 contact with
Golub.

8, ‘The above portions of this dispatch were written on1 July. It is now 7 July,
and the reception mentioned in para four above never cams off. When first
inviting Costille to this reception, Golub made it quite certain that Costille
was free for the 7th and made him promise to coms. On Thursday, 2 July,
Golub called Costille again to make sure he had not forgotten the date.
Costille told him that as yet he had not received the official invitation
from Zegal. Golub stated that he would receive it shortly. By Monday, the
day of the reception, still no invitation hed been received. At 1600 Costille
decided to phone Golub to find out what had happened. Golub informed hin
then that the reception had been postponed until the Soviet Aubassador, who
is presently touring Finland, returned to Helsinki, Golub apologized for

not telling Costille earlier and invited Costille for lunch the next day,
7 June.

9, Lunch with Golub has just been completed. He was more jovial than we have
ever seen him, He admitted that he had been up all evening drinking with a
good friend and hadn”t fully sobered up yet. His first move at lunch was
to order vodka end beer. He again apologized for the mix-up on the reception
invitations but said that his Ambassador didn’t errive back in Helsinki in
time, He promised to send Costille an invitation as soon as the date hed
been confirmed. The lunch was spent mostly in polite, friendly conversation,
Golub remarked that now Moscow had given him the authority to give Americans
visas without prior approval from Moscow. He stated that this would make
his job mich easier, and as long as he was convinced the American was "all
right" he could give him his visa in a matter of minutes, When Costille
mentioned that he had a personal friend coming to Helsinki for a visit in
October, Golub stated that Costille should insist she see Leningrad end that

if Costille would bring her to the Soviet Embassy, he would give her a visa
at once,

20. Golub then asked Gostille to explain the "James Dean" problem and the negro
problem in America to him, Golub stated that he personally did not like
negroes and admitted that the Soviet Union also had a juvenile delinquency
problem ("stilyagi"). Golub mentioned that Khrushchev was coming to Finland
soon which always meant a lot of work for the Embassy, He then proceeded
to talk about what a great, intelligent, but practical man Khrushchev was.

2, Golub also made some derogatory remarks about his wife, and how glad he was

“that she had gone to Moscow, Returning from lunch, Golub insisted that

Costdlle stop by his apartment to hear some of his Russian records and have

| @ glass of cognac, As they walked through the door, Golub, at the top of

\his voice, in Russian yelled, "Is there any one home?” It is so nice not to

\have anyone answer." Golub is extremely proud of his record collection

\which is smal] but includes some Chalispin, Tchaikovsky and Prokoviev records.

The apartment 1s quite large with many rooms, but all are quite sparsely
furnished, One or two rooms aren’t furnished at ell. He has a small West
