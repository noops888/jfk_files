1.

On 26 June Costille Invited Golub to have lunch with him at the Savoy

Restaurant in Helsinkl, as it was Costille"s turn to pay the blll..

Golub"s

first remarks concerned the amount of work ha hay to do in the consulate,

as ho was alone thero now since Michae? LYUBIMOV#t had departed.

stated that Lyubinov had now obtained the diplomatic titlo

tary and was currently in Moscow for some training prior to a

assignment

somewhere besides Helainki..probably either london or stockholm.

stated that he nissed lyubimor tremendously both office wise and personally.

He was very fond of Lyubinov and often remarked what an lntelligent young

man he was.

2.. The coxversation then turned to Costille's recent vacation in Lapland.

Golub again told Costille that ho was not going to be able to take a

vacation this jear as the now imbassador wanted him to remain in Helsinki.

Golub then stated to Costille, "I have heard that you speak fluent Russian."

Costille stated that that was very complimentary but that he spoke about

as good Russian as Golub spoke English.

Costille told him that he had

studied Russian at the University of California and on his own but that

about all he could do now was understand and read some and that what 11ttie

speaking ability he had was practically gone.

Golub commented It was

good that Costille know some Russian and said that more Americans should

study it. Golub then asked way Costille was not trying to improve his

Russian.

Costills answered that he was trying to learn to speak Flnish

and that it was too mich of a chore to study two languages at the same time.

Golub said that what Costille needed was more practico In Russian and pro-

ceeded to speak In Russian.

In actuality Costille's Russian has decreased

considerably and he was able to easily convince Golub that his Russian was

far from fluent. As was mentioned in previous dispatches, Costille had

never attempted to conceal from Golub the fact that he knew Russian.

lasue just never came up.

Since Golub is fluent in Finniah, the common

language automatloally becane Finnish.

If we had realized this Golub

contact was going to be so frequent, we would have nado it a point at the

first to be the one to tell Golub that Costille knows some Russian.

might have made Golub a little suspicious.

At the last meeting Costille

had mentioned to Golub that he had been studying Russian some.

did not respond, so evidently he either did not hear or understand Costille.

-3.

Golub asked Costille what other languages he had studied. Costille told

him he had studied Spanish in high school. Golub said that this was an

easy language and not studied too much in the Soviet Union. After making

this remark, he quiokly corrected himself and stated that a large percentage

of the world spoke Spanish and that it was becoming a much more popular

language in the Soviet Union.

Costille mentioned that Russian had become

a very popular language in the States and that within the last two years

his high school in Californis, which was quite small, even was offering the

Russian language. This seemed to impress Golub.

14o

While speaking Russian to Costille, Golub began using the lamiliar form of

the language rather than the polite form which the two had always used. He

looked at Costille and asked if lt would bo alright to use first names.

when Costille agreed, he reached across the table and shook Costille's

= than told costille that there was a new Cultural Officar in tr

oviet Embassy by the name of YEnunZEGAitt who wanted to meet some your

Western Imbassy officers, especially Americans. Golub stand that he had

gaven him Costillo's name and that Costille would be receiving a written

The above portions of this dispatch were written on 1 July.

It is now 7 July,

and the recoption mentioned in para four above never came off. When first

Inviting Costille to this reception, Golub made it quite certain that Costille

was free for the lth and made him promise to come.

On Thursday, 2 July,

Golub called Costillo again to make sure he had not forgotten the date.

Costille told him that as yet he had not received the official invitation

from Zegal. Golub stated that he would receive it shortly.

day of the reception, still no invitation had been received. At 1600 Costille

decided to phone Golub to find out what had happened. Golub informed him

then that the reception had been postponed until the soviet Ambassador, who

is presently touring Finland, returned to Helsinki. Golub apologized for

not telling Costille earlier and invited Costille for lunch the next day,

9.

Lunch with Golub has just been completed.. He was more jovial than we have

aver seen him. he admitted that he had been up all evening drinking with a

good friend and hadn't fully sobered up yet. His first move at lunch was

to order vodka and beer. He again apologized for the mix-up on the reception

Invitations but said that his Ambassador didn't arrive back in Helsinki in

time. Ho promised to send Costille an invitation as soon as the date had

been confirmed.

The lunch was spent mostly in polite, friendly conversation.

Golub remarked that now Moscow had given him the authority to give Americans

visas without prior approval from Moseow. He stated that this would make

his job mich easier, and as long as he was convinced the Amarican was "al]

right he could give him his visa in a matter of minutes.

When Costille

mentioned that he had a personal friend coming to Helsinki for a visit in

October, Golub stated that Costille should insist she see Leningrad and that

if Costille would bring her to the Soviet Embassy, he would give her a visa

at once.

10.

Golub then asked Costills to explain the "James Dean" problem and the negro

problem in America to him. Golub stated that he personally did not like

negroes and admitted that the soviet Inion also had a juvenile delinguency

problem ("stilyagi"). Golub mentioned that Khrushchev was coming to Finland

soon which always moant a lot of work for the Embassy. He then proceeded

to talk about what a great, intelligent, but practical man Khrushchev was.

11.

Golub also made some derogatory remarks about his wife, and how glad he was

"that she had gone to Moscow.

Returning from lunch, Golub insisted that

Costille stop by his apartment to hear some of his Russian records and have

a glass of cognac. As they walked through the door, Golub, at the top of

his voice, in Russian yelled, "Is there any one home?' It is so nice not to

have anyone answer." Golub is extremely proud of his record collection

which is small but includes some Chaliapin, Ichaikovsky and Prokovier records.

The apartment is quite large with many rooms, but all are quite sparsely

furnished. One or two rooms aren't furnished at all. He has a small West
