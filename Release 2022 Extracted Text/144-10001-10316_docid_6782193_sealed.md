FRENCH REACTIONS TO PRESIDENT, KENNEDY'S DEATH

44 USC 2107(5)(g)(2)(D)(i)

The death of President KENNEDY. has made an enormous impression

in France and aroused an emotion [SM]. Government circles, beginning

with DE GAULLE, immediately forgetting [4G] differences with the

United States,

are unanimous in exalting the image of the deceased

President.

At the same time concern is not being concealed over the

internal evolution of the United States, where political differences

and the race conflict run the risk of being intensified.

On the international level, it is believed in Paris that the

West has lost a leader of major prestige and force and that this will

not fail to have repercussions on East-West relations..

JOHNSON is considered an obscure figure and a man; despite his

(B val political) experience, of minor caliber, with the consequences

of depriving the

United States for [5G] a year, (B val that is),

until the (B val'next) elections, of any effective political direction.

With the approach of the presidential elections the first signs

were already (B val noted) of hesitation and indecision which

diminished the capability for decision by the United States, and

the death of President KENNEDY risks paralyzing [7G] Washington

with unforeseeable consequences on both the domestic and the

internatichal levels.

All agree, then, in [11G/M], over and above the differences,
