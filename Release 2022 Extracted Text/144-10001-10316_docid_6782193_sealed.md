The death of President KENNEDY.has made an enormous impression
in France and aroused an emotion [8M]. Government circles, beginning
with DE GAULLE, immediately forgetting [4G] differences'with the
United States, are unanimous in (éxalting ‘the image of the deceased
President, .

At the same time concern is not being concealed over the
internal evolution of the United States, where political differences
and the race conflict run the risk of being intensified.

On the international level, it is believed in Paris that the
West has lost a leader 6f major prestige and force and-that this will
not fail to have repercussions on East-West relations.:

JOHNSON is considered an obscure figure and a man; despite his
(B val political) experience, of minor caliber, with the consequences
of depriving the United States for [5G] a year, (B val-that is),
until the (B val- fext) elections, of any effective political direction.
With the approach of the presidential elections the first signs
were already (B val noted) of hesitation and indecision which
diminished the capability for decision by the United States, and
the death of President KENNEDY risks paralyzing [7G] Washington
with unforeseeable consequences on both the domestic and the
international levels.
