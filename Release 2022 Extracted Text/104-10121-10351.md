1. After further consideration of the problems posed
by the investigation of Mr. Robert A. Maheu by Intertel and
05 Cur. Michael G. Merhige's association with that company for
cover, I would like to recommend that a somewhat fuller
briefing be given to Mr. Mullin than originally envisioned
in my memorandum of 17 March. It seems clear to us that an
investigation of Mr. Robert A. Maheu's activities in Quito,
as contemplated by Mr. Mullin, will reveal that:

a. Mr. Jaime Duran, an Equadorian “ten
percenter-type"(who worked closely with Mr. Merhige of
in Quito) is hostile to Robert A. Maheu Associates
because Duran believes himself to have been badly
treated by Robert A. Maheu Associates on a cable TV
project in which he shared an interest.

b, The sum of $10,000 was deposited in the
First National City Bank of Quito by Maheu as a
kind of \"earnest" money (prior to Mr. Merhige's * 4
arrival.) This money was to assure Mr. Duran of
the continuing interest of Robert A. Maheu Associ-
ates in the cable TV project. On the day of his
departure from Quito, [Mr. Merhigejwithdrew the
$10,000 in local currency [by¢eashier's check made
out to Robert A. Maheu Associates. ] This transaction
was at the request of [Haheu Associates and thd

by Mr. Merhige via registered mail on 7 January |
1971. It is important to note Mr. Duran can be
expected to comment in some adverse way on this
subject. Moreover, we have no positive knowl-
edge if this money was originally Mr. Maheu's,
Mr. Hughes', or some combination thereof.

3. We believe that mr. Mullin should be given a more
complete briefing on the relationship between CIA and 03
Robert A heu Associates as it pertains tour. Merhige
includt. . Merhige'’ current status as an employee o:
CIA. We believe this will encourage Mr. ;Mullin to handle
any information he develops about (Mr. Merhige)with greater
discretion, Moreover, should the results of Mr. Mullin's
investigation present him with a conflict between the
interests of his employer and CIA, Mr. Mullin may be in a
better position to recognize that conflict and consult with
us before either disclosing the information or pursuing a
matter of potential embarrassment to CIA.

4. Officers in this organization who know and have
dealt with Mr. Mullin vouch for the honesty of Mr. Mullin's
willingness to do what he can to prevent unnecessary
exposure of CIA's interests. Although he has been described
by Agency staffers who know him as “not a mental giant,"
they believe he will cooperate even to the extent of advising
us of the results of his investigations where our vital
interests may be concerned, It should also be considered
that Mr. Maheu is currently under investigation in Las Vegas
and we have no way of knowing what connection with CIA may
be disclosed by a search of Robert A. Maheu Associates’ files.

5. It is my proposal, after consultation with
Mr. James P, O'Connell, DD/PTOS, that Mr. Mullin be briefed
on the cover relationship between Robert A. Maheu Associates
