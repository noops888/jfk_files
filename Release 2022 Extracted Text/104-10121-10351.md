1. After further consideration of the problems posed

by the investigation of at. Robert a. Maneu by interter ano

ar. Hichael G. Merhige's association with that company for

cover, I would like to recommend that a somewhat fuller

brieling be glven to Mr. Mullin then originally envisioned

In my menorandun of 17 Harch. It seems clear to us that an

Investigation of Mr. Robert A. Mahou's activitles in Quito,

as contemplated by kr. Mullls, Will reveal that:

a. Ar. Jalme Duran, an Equadorian "ten

percenter-type"who norked closely with ir. Merhige oo

1n Quito) 1s hostile to Robert A. Maheu Associates

because Duran belleves himself to have been badly

treated by Robert A. Maheu Associates on a cable TV

project in which he

shared an Interest.

b.

The sun of $10,000 was deposited in the

First National City Bank of Quito by Maheu as a

kind.of

"earnest" noney (prior to Mr. Merhige's

arrival. This money waB to assure Mr. Duran of

the continuing interest of Robert A. Maheu Associ-

ates in the cable TV project. On the day of his

departure fron Quito, Mr. Merhige]withdrew the

$10,000 in local currency bycashier's check made

out

to Robert A. Maheu Assoclates.] This transaction

was at the request of Maheu Associates and the

cashier's check was sent to Mahou Associates

by Mr. Kerhige via registered mall on 7 January

1971.

It 18 Important to note MI. Duran can be

expected to comment In some adverse way on this

subject. Moreover, te have no positive knowl-

edge If this money was originally Mr. Haheu's,

Hr. Hughes', or some combination thereof.

3.

We belleve that Mr. Mullin should be given a more

complete briefing on the relationship between CIA and

He believe this will encourage Mr.3Mullin to handle

Information he develops about ur. Merhige) with greater

discretion.

Moreover, should the results of ir. Mullin's

Investigation present him with & confllot between the

Interests of his employer and CIA, Mr. Mullin nay be 1n a

better position to recognize that confliot and consult with

us before either disclosing the information or pursuing a

matter of potential embarrassment to CIA.

Officers in this organization who knoy and have

dealt with hir. Mullin vouch for the honesty of Mr. Mullin's

#llingness to do what he can to prevent unnecessary

exposure of CIA's interests. Although he has been described

by Agency staffers who know him as "not a mental giant, "

they belleve he will cooperate even to the extent of advising

us of the results of his investigations where our vital

interests may be concerned. It should also be considered

that hr. Maneu is currently under Investigation ln Las Vegag

and we have no way of knowing what connection with CIA may

be disclosed by a search of Robert A. Mahou Associates' files.

It would be highly desirable to have someone in Intertel on

the alert for matters of concern to CIA which might be devel-

oped by the broad investigation of Robert A. Maheu Assoctates

currently under way.

It 1s my proposal, after consultation ulth

Mr. James P. O'Connell, DD/PTOS, that Mr. Mullin be briefed

on the cover relatlonship between Robert A. Maheu Associates
