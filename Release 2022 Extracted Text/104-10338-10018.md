CURRENT INTELLIGENCE MEMORANDUM

SUBJECT: Cuban Subversion in Latin America
Since July 1963

1. Cuban subversive efforts in Latin America
are continuing at a steady pace, despite recent
major setbacks in such countries as Venezuela and
Brazil. From July 1963 through December, when
Havana evidently believed a "second Cuba" was likely
in Venezuela, Cuban propaganda stressed.the inevi-
tability of Castro-inspired revolutions in the
hemisphere. Since the first of this year, however,
Cuban leaders have muted direct exhortations to vio-
lence and .have emphasized other policy priorities.
Nevertheless; the Cuban potential for subversion in
Latin America remains high.

2. In his speech of 26 July 1963, Castro re-
captured much of the militant tone of his speeches
in late 1962. He made it clear that he regards
Cuba as the main source of inspiration and guidance
for inevitable revolutions in the rest of Latin
America. He claimed that what has been done in
Cuba can take place "exactly the same way in many
Latin American countries." The hemisphere's mili-
tants, he said, must take advantage of conditions
presently favoring revolution and "open the breach."
On 28 September, Castro said that while "imperial-—
ists believe they can destroy the Cuban revolution,"
the Cubans believe that before that could be accom-
plished “many other revolutions like ours will ap-

. pear on the continent." On 24 November, Che
Guevara said the spreading of revolution in the
hemisphere "is also our responsibility and it is
part of our daily preoccupation."

3. What emerged from these and other Cuban
pronouncements was the apparent conviction of
Castro and his aides that further Communist revolu-
tions in Latin America are inevitable, that Cuba
can speed up the process, and that in Cuba's own
interest it is urgent that revolutionary action be
initiated wherever possible and as soon as pos-
sible. It is logical to assume that despite recent
official soft-pedaling of the issue, the basic
Cuban viewpoint remains the same. Cuban leaders
continue to believe that the very presence of their
regime will inspire other Latin American revolu-
tionaries to action, and undoubtedly will continue
to give assistance to these efforts.

4. Cuba's policy of revolution in the hemi-

. Sphere has suffered severe defeats, however, since

the 3-ton Cuban arms cache was discovered on a
Venezuelan beach on 1 November 1963. For example,
OAS action stemming from that discovery is pending;
despite the Cuban-supported terrorist campaign,
constitutional government in Venezuela was success-
fully transferred following President Leoni's dra-
matic election victory last December; and the out-
breaks of violence in Panama last January failed to
upset constitutional processes there. The April re-
volt in which President Goulart of Brazil was over-
thrown was also a severe defeat for Havana. These
reverses may have produced a feeling in Havana that
a breathing spell is necessary. In addition, Castro
pay have been cautioned to moderate his revolut
tactics when he visi faAnuary. Ti 7
re ‘has been designated "the year of the economy."
This and Cuba's all-out campaign to obtain needed
commercial and industrial goods from West
also may be factors prompting Havana to lessen its
public expressions of support for revolution. More-
over, Castro may believe that a soft-pedaled policy
on revolution now may pay dividends after the US
elections in November. He probably assumes that
conditions for a US-Cuban modus vivendi--on his
terms--will be more favorable then.

5. Nevertherless, evidence presented in the
accompanying country-by-country index shows that
Cuba has continued since the first of the year to
promote, finance, and otherwise support pro-Castro
groups and individuals in Argentina, Brazil, (be-
fore the April revolt), Chile, Panama, British

Guiana, and other countries. Indeed, on at least
two recent occasions, Che Guevara was quoted as
restating familiar Cuban views on revolution. In
an interview published in an Italian newspaper in
March, Guevara reiterated that the road to "national
liberation" in Latin American must take a turn to
violence. He emphasized that violence would be
"necessary" in "almost all" Latin American countries,
for "there is no other way." In an April interview
in Algiers, Guevara said: "It is very, very, very,
very, but very, hard to achieve liberation in Latin
America by employing peaceful means,"

growth even if there should be a lessening in the
actual training program in Cuba.

9. Numerous reports have alleged that Cuba
is supplying arms clandestinely to some Central
and South American-based extremist groups. Only
in the case of the arms cache discovered in Vene-
zuela on 1 November, however, has there been in-
controvertible proof of Cuban complicity in such
efforts. A good deal of the undeniably extensive
arms traffic which goes on in several areas of the
hemisphere is basically a continuation of long-
established patterns of arms smuggling between
nationals of the countries involved. Cuba does
possess over 100 fishing vessels and some cargo
planes which are well-suited to gun-running or
air drops, but we cannot confirm that they are used
for this purpose. In addition, Cuban leaders have
always stressed the importance of Latin American
revolutionaries procuring their own weapons from
local sources. Moreover, some financing from
Havana undoubtedly is used to buy arms.

10. Another important aspect of Havana's ef-
forts in Latin America is centered on supporting
and guiding hemisphere front organizations. Havana
has long sought to establish a new hemisphere-wide

for spreading pro-Castro propaganda among urban
labor movements. The embryonic Single Center of
Latin American Workers (CUTAL), which held its con-
stituent congress in Brazil in January 1964, ends
Havana's quest. This Brazilian congress was such

a total failure, however, that it is doubtful if

in the near future CUTAL will provide Havana with
the type of organization it envisaged. Cuba's sup-
port for the 9 March Second Latin American Youth
Congress (LAYC) also was well established. This
conference, too, ended in near-failure. Havana now
is attempting to organize another hemisphere "soli-
darity-with-Cuba" congress in Montreal, Canada in
July. This proposed congress--which, however, is
being officially discouraged by the Canadian govern-
ment--would. be modeled on a similar effort staged
in Niteroi, Brazil in March 1963,

ties have uncovered and dispersed at least three pro-
Castro guerrilla groups in this area in the past year.

3. Brazil

Before the overthrow of President Goulart, Cuba
was engaged in an active subversive effort in Brazil
providing funds, guerrilla training, and propaganda
support to Communist and pro-Communist groups. Operat-
ing primarily through its embassy in Rio de Janeiro,
Havana collaborated closely with Francisco Juliao's
Peasant Leagues in northeast Brazil and with Leonel
Brizola, Goulart's violently anti-American brother-
in-law. The former Cuban ambassador privately
described Brizola as having the best prospects for
starting a Castro-stule revolution in Brazil. The
ambassador appeared to be favoring him over Juliao

had increased to the point where they covered all
major cities; Rio alone had seven, Similar or-
ganizations existed at the national level, such
as the Society of Friends of Cuba and the National
Committee Against Intervention in Cuba, Cuba also
broadcast daily to Brazil in Portuguese.

Brazil under Goulart also affordec Cuba an
excellent base for promoting hemisphere-wide, pro-
Cuban front groups. The constituent congress of
the Single Center of Latin American Workers (CUTAL)--
which is planned to replace the moribund Confedera-
tion of Latin American Workers (CTAL)--was held in
Brazilia in late January. The Brazilian delega-
tion to the Cuban-supported Second Latin American
Youth Congress (LAYC), held in Santiago, Chile on
9 March, was headed by President Goulart's nephew,
who brought a letter from the President warmly sup-
porting the conference. Brazil was also used as
a transit area for some Latin American subversives
returning to their countries after having received
training in Cuba.

In late April, the dissident Communist Party
of Brazil (CPB), which follows a pro-Chinese line,
was reported to have directed two Cuban-trained
leaders to begin paramilitary operations in Sao
Paulo and Goias. CPB members have been encouraged
by their Cuban comrades--many have been trained in
Cuba--but Havana is not known to have given them
direct support. _ a

Quick response by Havana to unrest in the Dominican
Republic also was reflected during the transit

Cuban subversive efforts aimed at Nicaragua
have been channeled principally through the National

lutionary organization. Most of this group's guer-—

with members of various other Nicaraguan revolu-
tionary movements. Cuban aid to the FLN takes the
form of financial support, training, and guidance,
but details are lacking regarding its current size
or effectiveness. In August 1963, the FLN launched
an unsuccessful guerrilla foray into northern
Nicaragua from Honduras which cost the small organ-
ization some of its key personnel. Since then,
the FLN has been the object of harassment by both
Nicaraguan and Honduran security forces. It has
shown no capability to make another move soon.

“16. Panama

Pro-Castro and Communist elements moved quickly
to exploit the January outbreaks of violence in
Panama, For some four months preceding the 9-11
January incidents, Havana had been increasing its
pressure on its contacts in Panama to cooperate in
starting revolutionary action. Revolutionary
leaders of the Castro-supported Vanguard of the
National Revolution (VAN) were urged as early as
the threatened banana workers' strike in October
1963 to cooperate in initiating an anti-government
campaign. Planning quickened after the early
November visit of Victor Rico Galan and possibly
other Castro agents. Some of the approximately
100 Panamanians believed to have received training
in Cuba were planning to give guerrilla warfare
courses in December and again in May.

Clandestine reporting also discloses Cuban
efforts to influence the outcome of the 10 May
1963 national elections. Havana is reliably re-
ported to have provided some funds for campaign
assistance to selected deputorial candidates of
the Radical Action Party (PAR).

The primary recipient of Cuban assistance for

la Puente, the leader of MIR, has visited Cuba on
several occasions, and is on good terms with Castro.

Cuba has assisted other pro-Castro groups of
lesser importance, but such assistance has been
limited to guerrilla training. One such group, the
Army of National Liberation (ELN), organized by
Peruvian extremist students in Havana, has isolated
bands of guerrillas operating in remote areas of
the country. The National Liberation Front (FLN)
is openly pro-Castro, and has sent members to Cuba

19. Uruguay
We have no evidence of Cuban support for revo-
lutionary activity directed at subverting the
Uruguayan government. Uruguay's importance to
Havana lies in its value as a place where Cubans
and Cuban agents are relatively free to carry on
subversive contacts with dissidents from neighbor-
ing countries, particularly Argentines, Paraguayans,

and Brazilians. The Cuban.embassy in Montevidea

20. Venezuela

The current level of Cuban activity in Vene-
zuela is considered fairly low. International
reprecussions stemming fron the unprecedented dis-
covery of the huge Cuban arms cache in Venezuela
on 1 November 1963, the failure of the terrorist
campaign to disrupt the December national elections,
and the presently increased capabilities of the
Venezuelan military and security forces will prob-
ably dampen Cuban activities in Venezuela in the
short run. There is no reason to believe, however,
that these setbacks will alter Venezuela's high
priority on Cuba's target list for subversion.
Cuban support for the militantly pro-Castro Armed
Forces of National Liberation (FALN) doubtlessly
will continue, and may even increase.

The FALN gives signs of stepping up its activi-
ties, but on a lesser scale than at the end of 1963.
The decision in late April of the central committee
of the Communist party to continue using violence

as a political instrument probably presages a gradual
increase of terrorist incidents. Riots in mid-May
led by Communist-dominated students took place in
Caracas, San Cristobal, and Merida. At the same
time, one successful student-led robbery of a post
office occurred, as well as an attempted robbery

of the university payroll.

Robberies have been the FALN's favorite means
