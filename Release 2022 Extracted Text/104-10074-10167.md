OPERATIONAL INFORMATION REPORT

Delieved to contain Information of operational interest and may not be disclised to personnel outside:
St Operations without the’ pric’ pericion of the Domestic Caluction Division. :

SOURCE U.S. citizen, convicted arms dealer who maintains close ties
to known underworld figures.

Com (Robinson), a black Bahamian who resides in Nassau, Bahamas,
recently has made foreign enquiries into the possibility of hiring
armed mercenaries to be used in an attenpt to overthrow the
Government of Prime Minister Lyndon 0. (Pindling). During

a meeting with non-Bahamians, who have close ties with foreign

arms dealers, that took place outside of the Bahamas Robinson
stated that he represents elements of the Bay Street merchants
of;Nassau, and that funds are available for action against the
Bahamtan Government. According to Robinson, his group is looking
for foreign assistance in the planning, equipping, and execution of
a coup against the Government. He said that there are many Bahamians
who are in sympathy with his planned course of action, and that
after full details are worked out and the required funds are set
aside, he will convene another meeting with the foreigners in order
to finalize the appropriate arrangements.
