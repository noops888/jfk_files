was arranging to purchase a quantity of Staghound armored cars
from Israel, Davidson made use of a Nicaraguan passport to
travel from France to Israel since Arerican citizens were at that .
time enjoined from travelling to the Mid-Rast. EFWIG-1 was
shown this passport by then - French Arbassador to Nicaragua,
