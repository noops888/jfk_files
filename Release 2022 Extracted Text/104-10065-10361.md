THERE ARE SEVERAL CONSIDERATIONS WHY I WOULD PREFEI

VOT TO INCREASE THE KNOWLEDGE OF THIS OPERATION AND THEREFORI

THE RISK OF ADDITIONAL LEAKS BY CONSENTING TO THE RELEASE OF

THE TESTIMONY GIVENZTO THE CHURCH COMMITTER• FIRSTAND

MOST IMPORTANT IS THAT THE AGENDEIDENTIE TED IN THE TESTIMONY

IS STILLINZA CUBAN JAIL, LEAKS IN THE PAST GENERATED SEND

SATIONAL MEDIA COVERAGE, WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE LAX CONTROL

PROCEDURES OF THE NOW-DEFUNCA HOUSE ISLECT (PIKE COMMITTEE?

ON INTELLIGENCE COULD HAVE COMPROMISED. SENSITIVE DOcUMENTS.

ALTHOUGH AS A SECURITY PRECAUTION I TESTIFIED IN ALIAS AND

WAS KNOWN TO THE AGENT IN ALIAS I UNDERSTAND THA SIN AMA

RECHE POCUMENTEPREVIOUSLYIRELEASED DTHE SSTSHASS

IDENTIFIED IN TRUE, NAME THEREFORE HOS CAN APPRECIATE HAVE

CERTAIN PROFESSIONAL CONCERN IF THESE DOCUMENTS CARE

PUBLICLY SURFACED OR BECOME KNOWN TO A HOSTILE SERVICES IN

THE PAST TWO YEARS WE HAVE HAD A SERIES OF ARTICLES EXPOSING

ONE TON PENSONNEL IN SPAIN. THUS FAR I HAVE BEEN FORTUNATE

NOT TO HAVE BEEN ONE OF THEM.

I PREFER NOT INCREASING THE

RISK: FINALLY WE FIND IT DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND HOWDEURTHER

WECURGATATTON OFETHIS OPERATION CAN REVEAL INFORMATION OFFE

SUFFICIENT VALUE TO JUSTIFY THE RISKS RELATED LOATHENS

INCREASED: AND CONTINUING CIRCULATION OF THTS TESTIMONT E2 IMPDET
