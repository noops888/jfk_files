20 December 1973

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: E. Howard Hunt

RETURN TO CIA

Background Use Only.

Do Not Reproduce

1. I phoned Paul Burns, Special Assistant to the DDO, and

said that we had some leads that could be followed by whoever has

the action in the DDO in tracking down Hunt's activities during the

fall of 1964, when he was alleged to have been engaged in surveillance

activities of Barry Goldwater.

2. I said that our files showed Hunt was in DO Division (Burns

was not familiar with that title, but recognized it as the predecessor

of FR Division) and in August 1964 was assigned to the Washington

who was Deputy Divisior

give a few groups on what Hunt was supposed to be doing then. I

suggested that he be queried by cable. Burns said Gaines is staying

on under contract for a while, so would continue to be available.

3.

I said that Fig Coleman was on the Iberian desk when the

Hunt assignment to Madrid was brought up in 1964 and when Hunt

went to the field in 1965. He could give the background on the assign-

ment, which seems to have been through Karamessines at Helms'

direction. His fecollection would give leads. I told him that Coleman

became COS Madrid later, after Hunt left Spain, and could provide

information on what Hunt did not do for the Agency during that period.

I suggested that both Helms and Karamessines should be queried.

I gave as a possible press treatment that Hunt was engaged in

domestic operations (something Senator Baker is pursuing) and that

his assignment to Spain after the election could be presented as giving

him time to cool off. I thought we had to pursue the matter to be

sure we know the facts.

4. I asked Burns to be sure that we are on information distribution

of cables to the field on this, given our assigned responsibility for

keeping files on Watergate.

He said we are on the PLMHPLANK for

messages to Helms.. He would advise the action officer. I said we are

available for any help we can give.
