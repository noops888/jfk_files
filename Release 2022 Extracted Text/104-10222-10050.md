Mr.

Mexico Cily Station

Charles E, Flick,) who blaus in retire 80 Juné(1973. has teen assigned to

as an operations officer under don-

nfficial.covcr.

Durng ms entire period his primary responsibility has been the

supervision and technical maintenance of going telephone intercept renter. Although

Mr°Flick has performed his personnel supervision and operational financial

responsibiltigg in a thoroughly capable manner; his outstanding contribution to the

success of this joing telephone imtercept operation has been in the area of technical

maintenance of the equipment

ust con hung repact he let the uteru. enhe nice then

ised continuously for over

ears. Yet during the entire tenure of MßGlckat

Mexico City Station there has never veen a period when the intercept operation had to

be suspended because of equipment malfunction or qurage.

In the narrative of a

lness report dated 7 Decembegael, Mr. Clicky supervisor stated--the equipmeit

which he maintains is for the most part al least lorears old and requires constän

maintenance and the use of improvised parts. Subject has used his ingenulty and

sense of responsibilily to improvise and keep the operation going.

e, to our knowledge, a moment when operations have been suspender due to his

ability to keep the equipment going.". In another fitness report of January Gor dr

rating officer stated that--"In his day-to-day performance Subject continues 10 Save

any longer in the Agency operaldons. Visiting lechnicians are

always amazed to find the equipment in use and functloning sub-

stantially as il was on the day il wis installed. " The reviewing

official for the same fitness report commented that-.."The

Station necds him, cannel do without him and cannot find any

fault in his performance. "

noted above, the DCOS, Mexico City Station, submilled the

ollowing summary re MrSFuck's performance of duties

apport of his recommendation for an award for Mr. (Flick).

Fuck' performance has bech consistently evaluated at

strong to outstanding level. Is many ratin officers over the

years have each reached the conclusion that it would be all but

impossible lo find a replacement that would be able to deal with

all aspects of his juh as well arlick, some concluded that Fllck°

was Irreplaccable. 3(uck has successfully mantained a high-

cvel rapport and an excellent working relationship with the COM ≥ 4

officials concerned with the intercept center's operation for

24 tirteenycars - a unique achievement in itself - despite

elicumstances that would not have been tolerated by others of

lesser ability and dedication. Through personal initlative and

perseverance flick has amanted the agency lo accrue substantial

savtigs of funde by maintaining obsolete equipment in excellent

operating conditlon. Because of @tick'Seceptional capabilities

and efforts, the center achieved an outsmuding record of on-line

time and production despite the age and condittor of the equipment

and facilities available. B; consistem application of diligent

and unselfish professional efforts, Flick) turned a relatively

roune technical assignment into a highly productive/joint 24

operation of sustained operational and intelligence production

value to the Slation and to the Agency. "

In summary, Mr. (her)has performed his duties at the

telephone intercept center in Mexico City for (he(past thirten) 24

years in a truly dedicated, professional, and outstanding manner.

This outstanding performance of duty. over such an extended

period of time is a credit to Mr.3@lich), and certainly worthy of

the award recommended herein as he retires from the Agency.
