the symbol "Bureau Informant 100."

control of Angleton. Much of the information developed by Angleton

was not disseminated within CIA but he felt that the data should be

passed on to the Bureau.

Allen Dulles gave him authorization to

handle dissemination in

this matter.

We continue to receive

characterization.

offices, have had rare occasion to receive Bureau Informant 100 infor

field. This should be done since the Informant has been developing

information in recent months regarding the travel of U, S. citizens

Such travelers come from various parts of the
