/ ' f
ous. investigation has reflected that Dr.
Orlando vila, head of the MIRR, an anti-Castro organ-
ization at "viami; was compelled to abandon plans for an
attack upon the ‘Las Villas", a Cuban freighter, when this
vessel recently avoided the east coast of South Florida ona
voyage from Marseilles, France, to Havana; Cuba. This ship
departed Marseilles on May 4, i964, and was scheduled to dock
-.in Havana on May 25, 1964.

On May 26, 1964, MM T-1, a Cuban exile who is
friendly with some of Bosch's close associates, advised that
Bosch has begun to lay new plans for another attack against
Cuba.

Current Investigation

May 28%..1964, MM T-1 reported that on May 27,
1964, JesusBanche: tinez, who is also known as "Mimi",
and Evelioy pizat)Perez, associates of Bosch, went to
Orlando, Florida, upon instructions of Bosch, to examine two’
airplanes with the view of renting one or both for the next
-MIRR operation. MM T-1 said that Sanchez and Alpizar were
transported from Miami to Orlando, and return, by an American,
age about 47, 5'8" tall, weighing 180 pounds, black andigray:
hair, known only as "Oris", and a friend of Bosch. -"Otis"
was accompanied by his wife or girl friend, named "Carole".
MM T-1 said Bosch decided against renting either of these
planes at Orlando, both of which were owned by a medical
doctor, because of exorbitant rental fees demanded.
