“4. REPORT OF FINDINGS

JFK Act 5 (g) (2) (D)

(DEVELOPED CHARACTER REFERENCE) On 20 October 1968, Lucien
Todman, Computer Operator, Mutual Insurance Advisory Association (MIA&),
733 3rd Avenue, New York, New York, who resides in Apartment 4A, 1660
Andrews Avenue, Bronx, New York 10453, was interviewed at his residence
concerning Manuel MARTI. Source who has known SUBJECT slightly over two
years stated substantially as follows:

Source and SUBJECT met in July 1966 when Source went to work
at MIAA; and was introduced to SUBJECT who gave Source his orientation
regarding operations within the data processing at MIAA. Source and SUBJECT
became good friends and rode to and from work together since they resided in
the same general neighborhood. SUBJECT visited Source's home socially on a
few occasions, and they made visits to the United Nations and other cultural
sites together. Source had not seen SUBJECT since May 1968 when HE was
drafted into the United States Army.

SUBJECT is a native of Puerto Rico, but Source assumed that HE

moved to New York City when HE was very young inasmuch as HIS knowledge of
HIS native island was very limited, and: HE frequently queried Source, a Virgin
Islander, concerning conditions in Puerto Rico. Source met SUBJECT'S father,
HIS sister, and HIS brother, names unknown, on the occasion of the death of
SUBJECT'S mother in early 1967, when Source attended the funeral. SUBJECT
appeared to be very much attached to HIS mother and until her death most of
HIS time was spent between work and visiting HIS mother at the hospital.
SUBJECT never mentioned HIS father, and Source was not aware of his existence
until they met briefly at the funeral of SUBJECT'S mother. SUBJECT'S brother
was in the military service at the time of HIS mother's death and is believed
to have traveled from Germany for the funeral. Source believes that SUBJECT
received a deferment from military service because of HIS mother's illness
and the fact that HIS other brother was on active military duty. This gave Source
the impression that SUBJECT was the family's main support. SUBJECT is an avid
reader and has a keen interest in history. HE is a high school graduate
ad college at-nigttfor a short period. Source believed that HE attended New
York City College and took courses in history. SUBJECT is not known to have
any organizational affiliations. HE and Source have held many discussions
concerning local and world politics and MARTI has always staunchly defended
the basic democratic philosophy of the United States Covernment. They have
also discussed the subject of Puerto Rico's welfare, independence or state-
hood and MARTI has expressed the view that Puerto Rico's welfare and that of
its people is best served under the island's present commonwealth status.
SUBJECT is: a very intelligent, friendly, industrious and responsible young _
\e- “man.” “HE’ appears. to be very mature in HIS. thoughts and aétions,~and has. had. __

no known difficulty with creditors or law enforcement agencies. Source

“@. REPORT OF FINDINGS,

does not know if SUBJECT uses alcoholic beverages at all because on the
occasions that HE visited Source's home HE refused to have anything to
drink. HE isynot known to use habit forming drugs, and has manifested

no undesirable personal habits whatever. HIS main hobby is stamp collection.
Source does not believe that SUBJECT has traveled abroad since His

arrival in New York City, and Source has no knowledge of relatives or
business interest HE might have abroad, Source unhesitatingly vouches for
SUBJECT'S loyalty to the United States. Source was unable to suggest anyone
who may have knowledge of SUBJECT.

Todman highly recommends that MARTI be favorably considered for
a position of trust and responsibility with the United States Government.
