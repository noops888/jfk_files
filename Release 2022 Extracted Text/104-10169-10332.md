1.

Transmitted herewith are the following:

A.” A fiveepage report of ROCTINS"s interrogation of Harry Alfons
SU:DVIK on 25 April 1961

B, A two-page memorandum from SNDVIK covering jxints ne had forgotten
during the interrozation

2. When reading the attached interrogation report, there are a nuuber
of points to be noted. First of all, K's first story was a lie and it
was only wien he wis pressed ty #000) taat he cade any ~e:tion of his mectings
with KLLOV, Therefore, tnis story could be only tie sscund line of defense
and not a true story of their relationship. Second, th+ story does not attespt
to explain why, when SivVIK had a weex off from work (roa Seuurday, 8 April
to Sunday, 16 Appil),he only spent the four -iddle days cn his trip instead
of utilizing the rest of his time. Third, wy aLINOV persisted until the last
moment and made arrangements to sea SUNU.IX again socially in celsinkd if ke
had really "lost his grip™ to SUNOVIK's superior arguuenta and hostile attitude
@e SUNDVIK states. Anyway, to say the least, we are 1iot reacy to accept SUNDVIE!
story as it stands, ‘“e as been asked to write out in detail, at least five
single-space typewritten paces, the history of nis contacts with KLINOV. We
will check this paper against the report in hand, for a sturtore

3. VALINK/6 is being kept informed of the details of this case, He
agrees with ROODIN2 that tiere is a good daal more than has been revealed so

far. (By the way, wo might mention that this is another casa in which VaLIIK/é
and the help of the VALINK organization have teen invaluable. They nave provided
full background roports on all concerned, snd ava been surveilling SUUDVIX

off und on ever 3 we expressed our interasc in him)

oe 4. Ao dar as KLINOV'e statements about COSTILLE a: 20CDINE gop this

© was only to be exp:ted and does not surcrise either of than, For the history

* “of COSTILLE's previous encounters with KLTV, see (oriawa, 20 barch 1961,
ROODINE MEEKXEE has never mst KLINOV. 35

5. The Ambassador, the Counselor, tae Sscurity Officer and the Genaral
Services Officer (SUNDVIK's imnediate boss) ara aware of this case, The inter.
rogation took place.in the Security Officer's office. (nly sCODINS and SU..DVIK

were present, but FURSIVSS was in tie adjoining office Listening through the
wall,

6, We still have not figured out exactly ‘iow to handle this case. SULDVIK
will eventually tw dismissed, but we would like to’ get sane more informtion
before we let go of hin, anyway, sin HAS tan Workin; ab cho dubassy
since 1949 taero is not «uen to be guined by throwing him out tomorrow, ‘ie
