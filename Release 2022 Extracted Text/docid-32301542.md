No prior information could be identified with the

names JOE RANDOM and his brother TONY COVELLI. Although

it was known that the Baltimore Pizza Crust, Inc. had been

attempting to merge with a firm in Washington, D.C. , &

check of the State of Maryland Corporation files did not

reflect that any such merger had ever materialized.

with PETER MAGGIO and bearing the name "JOE TAMBERELLO" (ph) is

possibly identical with JOSEPH TAMBURELLO, who operates an

Italian neighborhood grocery store.

Baltimore files reflect

that on 2/3/59, Special Agents of the Baltimore Division

observed

LUIGI MORICI and FRANK CORBI, brother of JOSEPH

CORBI, at the Dizzy Klub Tavern, Holabird Avenue, Dundalk,

Maryland. MORICI has long had the reputation of being the

senior statesman in the Italian Criminal Organization.

Dizzy Klub was and still is operated by JOSEPH GIGLIOTTI,

who came to Baltimore over 20 years arn from Pittsburgh where

he had. the reputation of being in the

"Black Hand" society.

on the foregoing occasion, an unidentified white male, driving

the automobile registered. to FRANK MALVASO, parked at the

Dizzy. Klub and entered. Later MORICI and FRANK CORBI left

club in MORICI's

car and drove to Highland Avenue and

E. Lombard Street where they parked and entered the grocery

store of JOSEPH TAMBURELLO.

Nothing further was heard of TAMBURELLO until

5/20/64 when PCI JOSEPH JOHN POPP advised that he, as an

accountant, had begun keeping the accounts for JOSEPH

TAMBURELLO,

who operates a grocery store at Highland Avenue

and Lombard Streets.

He had acquired this account through

LOUIS COMI and JOHN COMI, whose Dodge Cigarette Service 1s

nearDy. The store reported weekly sales of $2,000 and

annual

neu prolit o1 $3,000.00. Informant said that

TAMBURELLO 1s assisted in the operation of the store by

his wife, HELEN,

and they have 3 minor children.

Informant

had never observed or heard anything which would indicate

they were involved in gambling operations. He commented

that TAMBURELLO speaks with a heavy Italian accent.

No indication has ever been received that TAMBURELLO

has ever had any connection with the Baltimore Pizza Crust

Inc., which is located on the opposite side of Baltimore

from TAMBURELLO's store. No mention of him appears in any

of the corporation's records or in connection with financial

transactions which are reflected in bank records. It ap-

pears certain that he has not been engaged in the

active

management of the pizza business

and would have no way

of acquiring the knowledge set

out in the conversation at-

tributed to him on the succeeding pages of re airtel.
