Attachment 1

Sergio Vicente ARCACHA Smith (Enclosure 2 of reference memorandum)

DPOB: 22 January 1923, Cuba
Up

1. Traces on ARCACHA do not reflect the date he first
arrived in the U.8. However, he became the FRENTE REVOLU-
CIONARIO BEMOCRATICO (FRD) delegate in New Orleans prior
to the Bay of Pigs invasion and continued in that position
until the FRD ceased to function. The FRD was the predecessor
of the CUBAN REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL, and was organized and
supported by the Agency. The organization was used as 2
front for recruitment of Brigade 2506 for the invasion.
During this period ARCACHA reported to the FRD headquarters
in Miami through a post office box in Coral Gables, and
reportedly maintained extensive relations with the New
Orleans FBI and Immigration offices. Two of hia regular
FBI Flog were a Mr. De Bruce and the deceased Guy
Banister.

2. ARCACHA was also one of the promoters of the -
FRIENDS OF DEMOCRATIC CUBA, INC (FBC) which was incorporated
in New Orleans on 6 January 1961. This organization was
ostensibly created by several New Orleans business and
political figures, including the deceased former FBI agent,
Guy Banister, to collect money to aid Cubans in their
fight against.Communiam. According to the articles of

tien, these donations would also be used to support

the FRD and the funds were to be channeled through ARCACHA,
leas a percentage to be retained by the FDC. An investi-
gation conducted by a reliable Miami Station asset concluded
that the FDC was organized strictly for the personal gain
of the promoters with the approval and collaboration of
ARCACHA. The investigation produced no evidence that any
individual donations were ever solicited or received and

recommended that the funds of the Stevedores Union and the
books of the New Orleans Exporters Company be investigated
for evidence of personal gain and possible evidence of
federal trax evasion, since both the president of the New
Orleans Exporters Company, Geraré@ F. Tunague, and the Chief
of New Orleans Stevedores Union, Alfred Chittenden, were
officials of the FDC. Approximately one month after the
FDC was created, strong criticism from some prominent Cubans
put the organization out of business.

3. Information in an immigration card reflects that
ARCACHA travelled to Caracas, Venezuela at an unspecified
date. His address in Venezuela was HOTEL TEUNA, Caracas,
and his US address was listed as 4523 Dupplesses Street,
New Orleans. Passport No. 00433.

4. Background information on the FDC and ARCACHA's
connection with the organization was forwarded to the FBI
in CSCI-3/764, 414, dated 30 March 1961. Other sources of
the above summary of information on ARCACHA are; DBF-66955,

Carlos BRINGUER is a brother of Juan Felipe BRINGUER
Esposito, a former member of Brigade 2506 who was captured

Edward 8S. BUTLER (Paragraph 7 (A) of reference memorandum)

In January 1965 Subject's organization (INCA), sponsored
the New Orleans appearance of Juanita CASTRO shortly after
her arrival in the US. INCA had a particular interest in
Miss CASTRO since they distributed hundreds of tapes contah-
ing Mises CASTRO‘s declarations when she was surfaced in
Mexico. A JMWAVE asset, who is Miss CASTRO’s business manager,
handled the planning and arrangements for the New Orleans
visit with INCA officials. The only subsequent contact
between the JMWAVE asset and Edward BUTLER occurred when
BUTLER was recently in Miami promoting the INCA film on
“CASTRO-HITLER in HAVANA". See Attachment 2 for a summary
of the INCA organization.

* Albert FOWLER (Paragraph 7(B) of reference memorandum)
DPOB: 15 July 1929, New Orleans, Louisiana

1. Subject is Alberto Casimir FOWLER Perillait, a
member of Brigade 2506 who was captured during the invasion
and returned to the US in the December 1962 prisoner
exchange.

2. FOWLER apparently returned to Cuba with his parents
during his early life and returned to the US to attend
schaa in his late teens. He attended the Lenox School,
Lenox, Massachusetts, 1948-49; Louisiana State University
1948-51. After his graduation from LSU he returned to Cuba
and married Margarita Paulette Van der SCHUEREN, born 13
August 1933, Brussels, Belgum. FOWLER was President of
the North American Sugar Company, Havana, from 1951 until
he returned to the US in November 1960 and enlisted in
Brigade 2506. At the time of his enlistment he gave Mark
FOSTER, Cuban Refugee. Center White House Representative,
and former US Ambassador William D. PAULEY, as references.
Following his release from prison FOWLER worked for the
BRAHMS CONSTRUCTION COMPANY, Palm Beach, Florida, where his
father resides, and for BROOKS TRAVEL SERVICES, W. Palm
Beach, Florida, until at least late 1964. He apparently
lost his US citizenship during his years of residence in
Cuba and immigration records indicate he applied for advance
parole status in November 1964 while he was still employed
in W. Palm Beach. He apparently returned to Louisiana
sometime after that date. YFOWLER‘'s mother lives in Coving-
ton, Louisiana, and he has a sister who is married to Fort
PIPES, Jr., member of a prominent New Orleans family.

Carlos QUIROGA (Paragraph 7(C) of reference memorandum)

Subject is possibly identifiable with Carlos QUIROGA,
a former student at Lousiana State University who was a
candidate for the Agency Student Recruitsent Program. This
involved recruitment of Cuban students in the US who would
return to Cuba as agents in place. JMWAVE traces reflect
an individual of the same name was an electrical engineer,
residing at 3134 Derby Blace, New Orleans, in December 1964.
Subject reportedly had homosexual tendencies, low morals,
and until the middle of 1961 was an ardent CASTRO supporter
and made anti-US statements. There is no indication that a
Carlos QUIROGA was every employed by the Agency in any
capacity.

There is no record of Subject in WH/Cuban Operation
Group files or JHWAVE files. JMWAVE cited the article
on NOVEL which appeared in the MIAMI HERALD on 26 April
1967, which is available in CI/R & A, and is in the process
of conducting an exhaustive search for traces on the cover
organizations NOVEL claimed to operate for the Agency in
New Orleans.

THE INFORMATION COUNCIL OF THE AMERICAS, INC. (INCA)

1. INCA is an anti-Communist propaganda organization
ith headquarters in New Orleans, that disseminates English
nd foreign language propaganda tapes and films en a world-
wide basis, conducts public forums of an extremist
political nature, etc. The organizational impetus and funds
apparently come from wealthy New Orleans figures including
Dr. Alton OCHSNER, of the OCHSNER CLINIC, and Willard E.
ROBERTSON. In recent years funds have been supplied by the
SCHICK SAFETY RAZOR COMPANY. An INCA letterhead listing all
the officers and officials has been requested from JMWAVE,
which has had some casual correspondence with the organiza-
tion concerning Miss Juanita CASTRO,

2. There is no indication of any Agency relationship
with INCA prior to January 1965 when INCA sponsored Miss
CASTRO's appearance in New Orleans. At that time an Agency
asset who functioned as Miss CASTRO's business manager was
involved with INCA officials in planning the New Orleans
visit where Miss CASTRO was given an award at a dinner
sponsored by INCA. The dinner, which was attended by civic
leaders and representatives of all news media, took place
shortly after Miss CASTRO's defection and there was

considerable interest in her appearance. INCA was particularly

interested since it had distributed hundreds of English
and Spanish language tapes containing her statements when
she was surfaced in Mexico. In October 1966 INCA again
requested that Miss CASTRO appear as a guest speaker in
major American cities in connection with the release of

the INCA motion picture production "HITLER IN HAVANA".
Following various reviews of the film, JMWAVE decided the
film would probably become controversial and it would be
inadvisable to permit Miss CASTRO to accept the invitation.
Because of INCA‘s extremist political orientation, JMWAVE
has wanted to avoid any more involvement between Miss CASTRO
and INCA and the Station asset, in his capacity as business
manager, has managed to prevent this. There has been only
one casual contact between our asset and Edward BUTLER,
Executive Vice-President of INCA, since Miss CASTRO‘'s ‘i965
New Orleans trip. This took place recently when BUTLER was
in the area promoting the “HITLER IN HAVANA" film.

3. According to JMWAVE, INCA officials have never
indicated in any way that they are aware of Agency control
and direction of Miss CASTRO or her business agent, and there
is no indication that INCA officials have had any official
contact with Agency officers.

DIRECTORIO REVOLUCIONARIO ESTUDIANTIL (DRE)
(STUDENT REVOLUTIONARY DIRECTORATE)

1. The DRE was conceived, created and funded by the
Agency in September 1960 and terminated in December 1966.
It was an outgrowth of the activist student group in Cuba
which fought against BATISTA and later against CASTRO,

Many of the leaders came into exile around September 1960
and were subsequently trained and infiltrated into Cuba

by the Agency in late 1960 where they operated by obtain-
ing intelligence setting up action teams, etc., up through
the Bay of Pigs invasion. While the DRE was initially set
up as a psych warfare outfit, the organization was given a
large amount of paramilitary aid in funds and material.
After the Bay of Pigs, the DRE engaged in independent
military actions which declined at Agency direction and
because of a reduction in funds from late 1962 until ter-- ~
mination of the group. Members were used through 1966 as
political action agents, for publishing propaganda which
was sent throughout the Hemisphere, attending international
student meetings at Agency direction, and producing radio
programs and special propaganda campaigns.

2. After the cutback in military operations, many
of the best DRE members relocated in other areas. At
present there are delegations in most Latin American coun-
tries which ‘have maintained some contact with various
Agency stations over the years although the DRE is no
longer very active. During the organization's 6 year
period of active existence DRE personnel were in contact
with several JMWAVE staffers and outside contract agents.
However, from January 1965 through December 1966, contact
with DRE personnel was limited to two agents, Juan Manuel
SALVAT, the current DRE Secretary General who is now
operating a bookstore in Miami, Florida, and Fernando
GARCIA Chacon who was relocated in El Salvador. —



FRENTE REVOLUCIONARIO DEMOCRATICO (FRD)
(CUBAN DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTIONARY FRONT)

1. The FRD was created with Agency assistance,
guidance and financial support in May 1960 and consistemt
of several anti-CASTRO groups. The FRD was formed as a
political action, propaganda and military unit. Initial
actions consisted of extensive radio and printed propaganda,
demonstrations, and trips throughout the Hemisphere to gain
support for the fight against CASTRO. The FRD also functioned
as the front organization for recruiting the members of
the Bay of Pigs invasion force and carried out a massive
program of social assistance to Brigade 2506 members in
training camps and their families. Although the FRD head-
quarters were based in Miami, delegates were assigned to
other areas which included New Orleans, Louisiana, Tampa,
Florida, and Mexico City, to gather intelligence and
coordinate Cuban refugee activities.

2. %In late 1960 or early 1961 the CUBAN REVOLUTIONARY
COUNCIL (CRC) was formed to coordinate and direct FRD
activities and this group was headed by Agency and White
House sponsored Dr. Jose MIRO Cardona, assisted by Manuel
ARTIME and Dr. Antonio VARONA. Both the FRD and the CRC
continued to function until October 1961 when the RD was
completely absorbed by the CRC in order to avoid the confusion
resulting from duplication of personnel, activities and
funding. The CRC also had direct access to President
Kennedy and top White House aides. Bacause of the magnitude
of the FRD and CRC operations and the Agency participation
in the activities and funding of the groups, a large number
of JMWAVE and Headquarters were directly involved with both
FRD and CRC personnel.
