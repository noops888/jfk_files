"This reconstruction of Agency involvement in plans to assassinate

Fidel castro is at best an imperfect history. Because of the

extreme sensitiusty of the operations beline discussed or

attempted, as a matter of principle no official records were

kept of planning, of approvals, or of implementation. The feus

writen retent records that do exist are either largely

tangential to the main events or were put on paper from
