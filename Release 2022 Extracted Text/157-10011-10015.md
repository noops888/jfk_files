Aerosol attack on radio station: A scheme was discussed at CIA
to "contaminate the air of the radio station where CASTRO broadcast his speeches
with an aerosol spray of a chemical that produces reactions similar to those of
Lysergic Acid (LSD)," (10) "Nothing came of the idea," (10) (freichl. %) of TSD,

not be relied upon to be effective." (10) Others who may be knowledgeable: 1.
