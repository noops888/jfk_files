Thus, Mr. ited for s meeting in which the undersigned, Col.

Mallard ond Re.|Wbedbeq | participated. ;

2. I outlined weieriy oar current operational policy i.e. our deal.
ings with the FRD api with grouzs outsi¢e the FRD as well. te mmtiocacd.
that ve had not sllowed FED representatives to com to Weshington and lobay
in babalf of their organizations} on tos other band many individuals and
exoups in opposition to the FRD were engaging heavily in such lobbying
Retivities, Thus perhaps a somsvnat wmbslanced picture bao been painted
‘of the Frente and msy Leve evan taken bold. Is view of this consideration.
tdgbt do given to heve the FRD senda regrescntative to Wechington vbose
primary Jod vould be to make contacts with the OAS end secondarily to
articulate ~ vis a‘vis U.S. Covermmint officials - the FRO policies.

3. The foregoing, I said, was called to mind by Col. Mallard’s
question to. ne on how to hondle the projected Hiro's visit to Washington.
It vas zy personal opinion that, should Miro inquire about the Bender
Group, the Departrent might indieste 1n a non-pnssive uny its averenses of
the group; should Miro sot mumtion the group perhaps # way could be found
to tell Miro thet for mtters which could not be handled by the Departront,
he undoubtedly had already his mm contacts which be will find satisfactary.

4, ‘The discussion di Miro led toa further examination of the MRP
vbicu ia very close to Hiro. I said that I us pumzled about the MRP
political posture; I bad a mmber af discussions with Mi? regresentatives
in the U.S., bad received its platform byt had not been abla to coke up
ay mind wether or not ~ frona long renga vievpaint - the MRP yoale wre
compatible witb U.S, self interests. Go onc hand - and I referred here
toa cocnent Mr. Devine had mda previously - important U.S. buuiness
people vould not give the MRP “a place in bells" on the other ion’, people
like Sanches Arango, fojns, Figumeez end others secm to feel that this


croup vould present us with o long souget solution to the problon, I
gingly did not know what to think end woalered vrat Kr. Devine's views

were.

5. Following this exanisation of tha SP, I roised the theoretical
question wether of not the t: sight cam in the near future for the

U.S. to detertsina which of the wunber of grams vould cet U.S. dlessirg.
Our current flexible operational policy i.e. the de v

Of Groups is workable enough but pernezs there might cone a tine in the

te

‘pot too distant future ‘vben we may have to fisa or out bait. By this I

did pot pean to iaply an official emoamcennt that any specific group.
had been selected; rather a fairly unierstancablo, sympathetic oftieial
attitude tovards one single Cubon segnert mist be shom.

Gs We erided the meting. by stating oer appreciation of beving the
‘eppertunity to express aur ou personal views in an informal manner; vo
added that. tle comversation in no way constituted a requast for ansvers

to the topics ciscussed. E
