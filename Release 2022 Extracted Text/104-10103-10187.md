BIOGRAPHIC DATA

Rolando CUBELA Secades was one of the activist

student leaders who assisted in the overthrow

of Batista and later turned against the Castro

regime because of disaffection with communism.

As early as March 1952, CUBELA was working

against Batista.

With student friends, including

the four Humboldt Street martyrs made famous

in the Marcos Rodriguez trial, CUBELA re-instituted

the University Student Federation or Directorate -

FEU or DR, as it is called. In 1956, CUBELA

participated in the assassination of Lt. Col.

Antonio BLANCO Rico of Batista's Military

Intelligence (SIM). Fleeing to the USA, he

became involved in military planning and purchasing

arms until I February 1958, when he and 16 other

students returned clandestinely and into the

Escambray to fight. He led a famous column,

became the overall

Dr military leader. Although

the DR joined military forces with Castro's

26 July Movement, they refused Ernesto "Che"

Guevarra's military leadership, fighting only

under CUBELA'S orders. They occupied the

Presidential Palace when Batista fled on

1 January 1959 and initially declined to turn

it over to Guevara and Castro. In October 1959,

CUBELA became president of the government-

sponsored FU, after resuming his medical

studies at Havana University. In 1961, after

his term ended, he terminated his connection

with the regime because of serious disagreements

with Castro and Guevara.

OPERATIONAL SUMMARY: 1. In March 1961, CUBELA went to the Latin

American Peace Conference in Mexico where-

he was contacted by a personal friend,

Carlos Tepedino (AMWHIP/1) who knew

Jack Stewart)(in true name) from Havana

and introduced them. The KUBARK objective

of the meeting was to determine whether

CUBELA was anti-Castro and, if so, to bring

his views to the attention

of the authorities

in the United States.

In August 1962 CUBELA went to the Helsinki

World Youth Festival where he was met by

lepedino who introduced (William Wainwright

under the alias William "Bill" Thompson.

This was a follow up to the first meeting

with the objective of inducing and

facilitating CUBELA'S defection. However;

due to CUBELA'S plans, the objective became

an attempt to set up an internal dissident

group for the overthrow of the Government

and sabotage.: CUBELA said he was not in-

terested in any small undertaking, and declared

the assassination of Fidel and other leaders

would be the most effective way to rescue

the revolution from the Communists.

Later in August 1962 CUBELA "went on vacation"

in Paris where he met "Bill Thompson" again

and KUBARK sought more information on his

proposal to overthrow Castro.

CUBELA also

discussed the need for the U.S. to become

more deeply involved with LA students who,

ten years later, would be on the road to

becoming key figures in LA governments.

Tepedino was present at most of these meetings.

In Tate August-early September 1962, CUBELA

was taken to a U.S. Air Force Base in

southern France where he was given a

demonstration in explosives. CUBELA had

thought of blowing up an oil refinery and

was also considering the elimination of

Carlos Rafael Rodriguez, the Soviet Ambassador,

and Fidel himself.

CUBELA was not given any

sabotage equipment but was trained in SW.

Earl Williamson (true name) accompanied

CUBELA on this trip but was always called

"Jaime" by CUBELA.

Jack "Red" Stent (as

Jack. Stevens) and a TSD SW technician under

the assumed name of Capt. David L. Harper

also accompanied CUBELA.

Tu September 1069, CUBELA Was met in -Porto-

Alegre, Brazil, by "Bill Thompson" and by

Neater Sanches, the latter usias the name

"Nicolas Sanson". Tepedino was also present

at these meetings. CUBELA claimed he had

written two SW messages with FI (one was

received) but nothing significant had been

happening in Cuba.

He said he was reluctant

to use SW because he feared the efficiency

of the Cubay Postal censorship.

He cited a group of Cuban military officers

and discussed ways to approach them. The

problem was, he explained, that although

many of them were anti-Communist, they were

loyal to Fidel or they were so afraid, they

were reluctant to discuss any conspiracies

for fear they might be provocations. CUBELA

was of the opinion that there was no organized

conspiracy within the military or in other

groups in the country.

Internal security

and controls were effective and improving

daily.

At this meeting CUBELA volunteered

the information that he thought highly

of Ramon GUIN Diaz (AMTRUNK/10) who was

hiding Miguel DIAZ Isalgue) (AMICE/14, an

infiltration asset who was sent in to recruit

Guin, and did so): CUBELA Said he planned

to use Guin but he was concerned about his

nervous condition and the fact he drank

CUBELA was told to assist Guin

and let him remain in Cuba rather than help

to leave the

country as CUBELA proposed.

From Porto Alegre, CUBELA went to Paris on

where he met with Tepedino,

"Nicolas Sanson", Jack "Red" Stent, Richard

Long. CUBELA was attending the Alliance

Francaise in Paris at the time.: It was

learned the Exench were unilaterally

surveilling CUBELA whereupon we advised

them our contact with him was an attempt

to defect

him.

On 15 October CUBELA insisted

that he meet U.S. Attorney General Robert

Kennedy because he believed Kennedy ran Cuban

affairs.

"Sanson's" position at the time was:

"We do not consider CUBELA is working for us

but since we have a common objective, we are

willing to render support.

CUBELA went on vacation and on his return

on 29 October 1963, -it was arranged for

Desmond FitzGerald,

under the name. "James

Clark"', to meet CUBELA at Stent's home that

day as an emissary of the poliey level-of-

the Government.

"Clark" made the following

statement "The Us. is prepared to

rendez

all necessary assistance to any anti-Communist

Cuban group which succeeds in neutralizing

the present Cuban leadership and assumes

sufficient control to invite the U.S. to render

the assistance it is prepared to give. "Clark"

assured CUBELA of moral support for any

activity in this direction which CUBELA might

take.

OPERATIONAL SUMMARY:

: SECRET.

7.

The highlights of CUBELA'S reaction to this

proposal were:

a.

The majority of the Cuban people are

against Castro, but mainly because of fear they

did nothing about it. Castro's primary support

comes from the young teenage militia group.

b.

Many high ranking military officers are

anti-Communist and many are convinced Castro must

go but they are afraid to organize or even talk

against Castro to other people. This fear and

Castro's control of the Government apparatus

(security, military, defense committee, economy,

etc.) make it extremely difficult to organize a

coup against him.

If Castro falls, the military will

probably break up into four or five groups.

Without Castro, the present regime will dis-

integrate.

Unless there is strong and immediate

support, the situation can easily become chaotic.

Nothing of an operational nature was discussed

at this meeting.

After the meeting, CUBELA

stated he was satisfied with the policy discussion

but he now desired to know what technical support

we could provide him.

8. On 19 November 1963 it was decided at

Headquarters that we would advise CUBELA

would receive a cache inside Cuba. If he

requested it, the cache would include sabotage

material, C-4 and equipment, high power rifles

with scopes, hand grenades, pistols, etc.

9.

On 22 November 1963, "Sanson" met CUBELA who

asked for 20 hand grenades, two high powered

rifles with scopes and approximately 20

pounds of C-4 and related equipment in the

cache.

He had refused to carry any in-

criminating equipment with him on his return

to Cuba.

CUBELA spoke again about Guin) and

his concern for Guin's security (it had never

been

admitted to CUBELA that (Guin was

recruited by (Diaz). When the meeting broke up,

"Sanson and CUBELA were informed about

President Kennedy's assassination. CUBELA was

kisibly moved and asked: "Why do such things

happen to good people?"

At this as well as

earlier meetings, CUBELA was given small sums

of money to cover personal expenses.
