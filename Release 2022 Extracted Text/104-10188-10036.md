I, Product of the Project _ ’
A, Soviet Coverage 3 : :

Project LIFEAT has not provided coverage of the entire Soviet official
installation in Mexico City since 22 June 1960 when Project LIENVOY
Assumed this responsibility, This freed LIFEAT to provide, with its
unilateral coverage, home phones of selected Soviet officials which
could better support not only the Station's CE effort but alse other
Station operations against the Soviet target. In this effort, LIFEAT
fies covered the homes of four of the more active Soviet Intelligence
Officers stationed in Mexico during the reporting period. Samples
of the operational information provided by LIFEAT follows:

C, Yugoslav Coverage

LIFEAT coverage of the Yugoslav. official tristallation in Mexico City
has provided a wealth of information on th? contacts, activities, and
travel of members of that mission, Since thé Station's effort against
this target was greatly increased within the last year, LIFEAT infor-
mation has: been used extensively to provide the basic operational and
personality-data necessary for this stepped-up program, Examples of
LIFEAT produced positive intelligence and general operational informa-
tion on this target are as follows:

HYMA-19311, 10 July 1962 (Activity of the CP of Yugoslavia in
Mexico City)

D. Cuban Coverage

During the reporting period LIFEAT coverage of the Cuben target was
directed toward the support of KUBARK operations in this field and wes
not designed to provide positive intelligence, LIFEAT covered a total
of 10 lines in direct support of operations in this field, Most of

the product of this area of operation was forwarded by cable to JHWAVE
and Headquarters, Examples of pouch communications in this field are?

B, American Communist Group in Mexico (ACGM). eee

As noted in past project reviews, most of the targets in this group
have been covered at the request of QUENVY. and the raw taxe nas peen
processed by them. During the period July 1962 through May 1963
approximately 390 reels of take were passed to the local ODENVY for

their processing. On 23 August 1062 the local ODENVY advised, “This

office feels the coverage mentioned is quite valuable and many useful ‘
leads are obtained from this coverage, particularly with regard to

travel in and out of Mexico of Anerican Communists who are in contact

with individuals on whom coverage is maintained", Typical examples

of reporting based on LIFEAT coverage of the ACGM are:

F, Exile and Revolutionary Activities

During the past year this area of activity, in addition to the already
noted Cuban coverage, accounted for the greatest percentage of tha
LIFEAT effort, Most of the information provided by LIFEAT in its
coverage of targets in this area was not available from other sources.
While Coverage has been provided on Spanish Republican, Guatemalan,
Costa Rican, and Nicaraguan exiles, the bulk of this product has
resulted from the coverage of Juan Jose AREVALO Rermejo and various of
his acquaintances, the "take" being forwarded to Headquarters and Station
Guatemala by either weexly cable summaries or {mmediate action cables
when warranted, It is noted that the coverage has been most rewarding
in the case of AREVALO and the recent coverage of Judith FERRETO Segura,

Counter-Intelligence Information

_ Mexico City Station's Related Mission Directive places greatest

emphasis on operations in the CI/CE area, LIFEAT was able to provide
@ continuing worthwhile contribution in the attainment of the Station's
objectives in this field, Coverage included that on AEGENERATE, Carlos
Humbert ILLESCAS (who acts in the capacity as covert liaison link
between the CP and the Soviet Enbassy), and a PCN safe house, In
addition to the continuing operational support in the CI/CE rield, the
following informational reporting was provided,

Operational Support and Leads Provided other Station Operations

During the past project year LIFEAT continued actively supporting the
operations of [exico City Station through the production of leads and
the providing of inforuation on selected targets in the manner available
only through the use of a untlateral telephone tap operation. indesd,
it is in this area, secure support to the Station's operations, that
LIFEAT 1s of greatest and unique value to the Station. The following
isa list of selected contributions by LIREAT of operational support

ang leads provided to the various Station Case Officers and Station
operations as a whole:



LIFEAT/Soviet: The valuable assistance which LIFEAT rendered Station
efforts in this area was amiy displayed in its support of Station
assets mounting a technical surveillance operation targeted against
the home of a Known Soviet intelligence officer stationed in Mexico
City under officiel cover, LIZEAT information provided vital infor-
mation whicn enabled: the Staz‘on toestablish a pattern of actica, -
of both the family of the Scviet officer and his maid. This infor-
mation made possible the setting of a time for the actual entry into
the target, and continuing corerage (including livé monitoring of the
target line immediately preceeding’ the operation) by LIFEAT sade

" possible a degree of security ‘fer this operation which would not have

been possible without the suysort of a unilateral tap operation,
Further LIFEAT coverage has, tn addition to giving information on
the daily activities and contacts of Soviet officials, provided an ex-

- eellent check on the contacts of three KUPARK controlled double agents

with their Soviet Case Officers, This coverage ins enabled the reepon-
sible Case Officer to guide operations with increased assurance
that his agents continue to be fully cooperative and under his control,

LIFEAT/Cuban: LIFEAT activities in this area were concerned primarily
with support to the AMSTRUT cperation, Coverage of relatives of
AMSTRUT-2 provided an excetient “window” into the operation which
enabled the responsible Case Officers to move with more certainty

and security in developingthis operation, The Case Officers involved
considered the LIFEAT coverese an essential check on the activities of
the principals in the case which was especially valuable during the
initial stages of the operation, Travel plans of ANSTRUT-2 provided
by LIFEAT were also essential to the timing of the operation, Also
in the Cuban area LIFEAT coverage of G-2 agent enabled the Station’

to gain an insight into his ecntacts and activities, Further, recent
initiation of coverage of a Cutan Comeroial Official gives evidence
of producing solid information of ecumerctal transactions and Mexican
Commercial contacts of the Cuban Government,

LIFEAT/Polish: LIFEAT continzed its coverage in the ATKNAVE/SECHICK
operation, (See previous protect renewal for background of this case
and the LIFEAT participation in it.) Of great interest to this operation
was LIFEAT information indfeatins that the wife of DEXKAVE had become
aware of his interest in another »oman, and later revelation of reassim-
ment end travel plans of BEKRAYS. :



LIVEAT/Yugoslavs In addition to the usual information concerning
the Yugoslav officials and their daily contacts and activitt, :
LIFEAT provided leads which could pay off in future operati
Onn example wat a lead-w:ic:. revealed that a diplomatic courier
would be travelling alone and taking. a new travel route while
carrying an official pouch, With this early warming, the Station

waz able to plan an operation to provide access to this corresyon-
denice, .Althours: Headquarters finally vetoed this particular oper-
‘ation, gufficient early warming was given by LIFEAT so that the
opezation could iave been carried out, Another exarple of this

type of lead wae the data available from LIFFAT coverage that a

new location wae being sought for the Yugoslav Enbasay, and which
specific iocations were under consideration, Armed with this informa-
tion the Station hv. heen able to make a tecinical easing of one of
the prospective sites and obtain information necessary for entry into

the other altes,

LIFEAT/Extle1 As noted previously, LIFEAT coverage of the exile
activities was the single rajor effort by LIFEAT during the project
year, In particular, LIFEAT coverage of Juan Jose AREVALO Bormojo,
which included lengtny periods of "Livo-monitoring™, on cocaston
calied for coverage of five lies, Cabled summaries of LIFEAT
information were provided Headquarters and Station Guatomala, It

1s believed that the trportence of this LIFEAT coverage onn not be
stressed too auch, LIPEAT Coverage of a Costa Rican Commnist exile

to reveal trmediately any renewal of an earlier planned attempt on
tha itfe of an SLYOE official by one group of the Republican Exiles,
Ulticetely, LIFEAT revealed tne departure from Mexioo of two of the

ringleaders in tre plot.

LIFEAT/CI/CE1 At Headquarters request LIFEAT SgREEAES was established
on a former SMOTH agent whose past actions gave’for some suspicion of
his present activities, Product from this line has revealed an effort
by a group of this individual's friends to discredit the sentor CMACID
official ‘in Mexico, Early warning by LIFEAT has made possible the
preperation of counter action (see HYMA-21764), LIFEAT has also
provided coverage of a suspected RIS support agent, This coverage
had provided the background sacerial necessary for checking on the
activities of this suspect agent, Continuing LIFEA! reporting on the
American Comunist Group in.Mexico (ACGN) has provided ODENVY with
great quantities’ of information on activities of leftist friends of

Ne

of the ACOM tneluding their travel plans to México and in somo cases
‘Cuba, As noted in paragraph I, E, above, the local office of ODENVY
considers this coverage "quite valuable", As also noted in. previous
renewals, LIFEAT ability to give the interested case officers a check
on’active and former agents increases the security of present opera-
tions and provides greater security for long term assets who may have
been in contact with now terminated agents,

“Conclusion

It 1s’ the opinion of the Mexico City Station that the support ‘provided
other Station operations, the CI/CE information and leads, and the
ability of the unilateral LIFFAT operation to cover sensitive targete
without revealing Station interest to the liaison forces, well Justify
the expenditure of funds, time, personnol and security risk, As it has
been noted in the past, that even with the Station's envolverent in the
parallel, but liataon-type LIENVOY operation, a change in attitude by
the present local government admintstrotion or a change in government
administrations could ond KUFARK participation in that lat

For. that reason, LIFEAT,. in addition. to: maintaining’ its pri
coverage, mist be available to once again undertake coverage of the
offictal Soviet and Crech official targets in Nexteo City, Therefore,
LIFEAT's present orientation, though toward supporting Station operations
and CI/CE mission rather than toward targets which would provide positive
tntelligenco, leaves {t readily available for recall into the Soviet-
Czech coverage, It 1s the Station's firm optnion that the LIFEAT

project provides a substantial and vital contribution in fuifilpent the
several priority objectives of the Station's Related Mission Directive,

There 1a attached a list of the I%¥s produced from LIFFAT provided
material during tho period July 1962 through May 1963, as a by-product
of the project's prime responsibility of providing support to Station
cperations,

Progress of the Operation

‘The objectives of the LIFEAT Project are of a continuing nature and
are therefere not considered for fulfiliment during, any given pertod of
time, For this reason percentage figures as to completion of project
objectives cannot be drawn, However, an {natcation of the coverage
provided tn working tovard fulftilzent of the objectives can be noted
in that approximately 12,500 pages of raw text were produced in the
period July 19€1 throurh April 1963, LISFAT has been In cuily opera-
tion during the review period with the average number of Lines covered
per month being 18, and a high in October 1362 of 2 lines covered,



AI, .Planning for the Puture

As was indicated at the time of the last project renewal, LIFEAT hopes
: ‘to Remsin ‘uAcommittea to coverages that require the expenditures of
Ee ttt .  & great portion of LIFZAT resources but provide coverage of but one
target...much as Soviet Embassy coverage. It is added emphatically,
however, that should the need arise for LIFFAT to avain assuze such
responsibilities, it 1s fully able to do so, Unt{l such time LIFEAT
ili continue to enJoy greater flexibility in the exployment of ite
assets, ecyecially in the areas in which the Station does not wish
: to reveal its interest or operations to the Ifatson forces involved
: in the LIZWVOY operation,

Vv, Expenditures

Approval for renewal of Project LIFEAT was granted 8 August 1962 for
FY 196% in the arwumt of $49,000.00, The proposed budget for FY 1964
ta broken down in the attached Field Project Outline Renewal Request,
Part II, and totals%<3,%03,

VI, Status of Commitments

‘There are no comiteents other than those noted in the project outline

Area of Operations

This operation 1s run from Mexico City Station and {s concemed with targets
located within Mexico City, .

Purpose

‘The purpose of this project is to provide, unilaterally, datly information

on the activities of official foreign installations in Mexico and the peraonnel
thereof, as well as coverage of the activities of selected tritviduals and
groups in response to both Station needs and Headquarters requests, Presently,
LIFEAT stresses flexibility of coverage with support of Station operations and
CIAE coverage receiving the greatest exphasis.

Background

Project LIFEAT was originated on 3 October 1950 as a untlateral telephone tap
operation,...Actual-inittation of operations under this authority occurred

on 18 January 1951, and the operation has run continuously froa thedate,
The project was opened with the Installation of a aingle tap and has row
in the past eleven years to covarage of as many os thirty lines in a given
month,

The LIFEAT Project is a unilateral operation cucpletely incependent from any
liaison arrangement, It 1g staffed by KUDARK contract employees with the
majority of personnel being indigenous sontrolles agents,

During the past twelve years, Project LIFFAT has produced gore than 97.000
{estinate) pages of operational and intelligence information in direct support
of Mextcc City Station's specific objectives, and contributed materially to
the intelligence gathering activities connected with the Soviet-Satellite
Bloo and core recently with the Cuban representatives in Mexico. In addition,
LIFEAT has been of cunsiderstic value in monitering the activities of the
Averican Communist Group in Nexico (ACGM), as well as the activities of the
exile groups and local Communists,

With the LIEWor's assumption of coverage of the Soviet and Czechoslovakian
official installations in July 1960, LIFEAT assets were released from continuous
coverara of these two targets, These assats were then employed in direct
support of Station operations--a role ideally sulted for a unilateral operation
such as LIFEAT, and extremely important to the security and success of Station

operations, i

from Project LIFEAT, for reasons noted below,

(1) LIFEVD-28 (201-117972) and LIFEUD-17 (201-195370), This couple,
having experienced a number of apparently insoluble marital problems, mutually
decided upon ‘separation and eventual divorce, Since tneir use in LIFEAT (as
basehousekeepers) would not be posatble with the breakup of their home, they
were terminated as of 30 September 1962. Termination was effected on a
mutually agreeable basis and no security problem has arisen to date, nor is
any expected in the future.

for this opération. When it was found that the MKTRAP operation could
rnot be.routed to this basehouse because of tectintcal considerations,

the base was employed as a photosurvelliance base targeted against

the LIERQDE mission. Since this operation is not connected with

LIFEAT operations or personnel, these two agente wili no longer

be carried under the LIFEAT project.

(3). LIFEvD'27 (201=332331) was granted a POA on 20 September 1962
for use as an dlterriate LIFFAT baschousekeeper, However, due to a
change of plans envolving agents's availability for LIFEAT work,
she was never recruited and this clearance was cancelled on 2

January 1963.

Operational Clearances

See Section 9 above,

Cover

There are no changes in the cover of personnel who have been previously
employed in the LIFEAT operation, With the new agents employed since the |
last project renewal, cover is aa follows:

_ LIFEUD-24 has natural cover of mancger of a small profitable
“medicine distributorship in Mexico City. Subject's office

hours and activities are therefore not scrutinized by a superior

and subject can devote the necessary time to his LIFEAT duties and cover

hie LIFEAT salary without difficulty,

a.

>, LIFEUD-26 has natural cover of housewife (wife of LIFFUD-24) and
mother, She performs ter LIFEAT duties only in her home (LIFEAT

ANNEX VI).

LIFEUD-25 has natural cover of the wife of a retired businessman
(LIFEUD-4), A review of LIFEAT personnel files during the past
year revealed she had been included on her husband's clearance
request in 1953 but had never been granted clearance in “her
ow right", This was corrected when on 3 January 1963 LIFEUD-25
was granted a full OA,

Case Officers and agents.

These systems of contact and communtoation appear suitable for the project
and function adequately from the security and utility standpoints. Locations
and times of meetings are reviewed periodically and are changed frequently to
decrease the possibility of arousing the suspicions of the residents of areas
in which meetings are held,

Control and Motivation

Control and motivation are primarily based on two factors: ideology and
financial gain, A secondary factor is the fear of reprisal from the local

police should discovery occur,

Security

During the past projéct year there were no incidents which were beyond the
capability of the personnel immediately involved to {solate and remedy
immediately, In contrast to previous years, there.was no instance of
teleptione work crews approaching a basehouse to check or remove the tap
lines running to that basehouse. Some of the “crosses” made in the telephone

these unusual connections, During the past project year rio such tigation
has been undertaken, and no suspicion of the LIFEAT linesen has been revealed
to date. ‘

The greatest dangers faced by LIFEAT in the paat year centered on two
developments: 1) the continued efforts of the telephone company toward moderni-
zation of the Mexico City telephone system and 2) the tnvestigation launched by
the Secretaria de Comunicaciones y Obras Publicas (SCOP) to determine if the
telephone company has not been providing maximum possible service to Mexico

City residents by holding from use certain "spare pairs" of every cable and
Aistribution box; :

In the firet development (which has been in-process for thé past few years ~
and was so noted {ri past project renewals) the most noteable incidents which
effect LIFEAT seourity are the installation of new underground cables re-
placing the old overhead telephone wires (thereby reducing accena to target
lines and tap routing lines) and the institution of a more efficient system
to keep track of daily assignments of the (thereby

‘A number of ideas have been tried to bypass this problem but
as yet no natisfactory solution has been found. LIFEAT personnel are continuing
their attempts to negate this problem, too, ,

As to the SCOP investigation, which 1s presently being pursued with more
vigor than is usually found in Mexican bureaucracy, the problem here 1s also

two-fold, Pirst is the problem that the SCOP crews have cuthority to enter

any (and eventually all) telephone distribution box and check back on each :
connection in these boxes to see if they are actually in use. On one occasion

they have rung back on a “spare pair” which was in use by LIFEAT to route a

tap to a basehouse, Although no security problem ensued it is an example

of the daily danger faced by LIFEAT in this case,

‘use the "spare; pairs" for-‘providing service to new subscribers,

would eliminate -LIFEAT use of these:pairs:to' route tap lines to its
basehouses, in effect leaving LIFEAT with no'way to cet the tap from

the to the basehouse. Even the possibility

from use by the telephone company Could affect LIFEAT adversely, sirice this
would reduce the options LIFEAT has in routing ita tap lines, However, until
the investigation is completed, and no firm estimate of a target date is
presently known, the real danger of LIFEAT can only be speculated upon.
LIFEUD-1 1s alerted to obtain the recommendations of SCOP when given to

the telephone company and all efforts will be wade b; LIFEAT personnel to |
either negate or take. advantage of any recommendations which are Paced

into practice,

It should be noted at this point that the LIFEAT operation could “blow”

faces in its daily cperation as a unilateral effort, _LIFEAT personnel.are... ~
trained and experienced in taking whatever action is necessary to negate

or leséen the damage as necessary, but it ie true that there can occur @
situation which will "blow" the operation despite the beat efforts,

Training

Initial training of new personnel and continuing refresher training for
the experienced personnel are handled primarily by the “outside” case officer,
David M. WILSTED, Minor repair and maintenance of equipment as well as
emergency security procedures are stressed and-continually reviewed with

the agents,
Equipment and Support

With the funds requested for this purpose in last approved project renewal,
LTFEAT audio and dial tape recorders were replaced during the past year,
Except for the usual problems discovered in equiprent which has been
shipped for-any distance, this new equipment has worked well since initial
use in the operation. It its believed that there will be no need to purchase
additional large amounts of special equipment for some years in the future,
provided that there 1s.no radical shift necessary in the tap techniques
presently employed in the operation,

Timetable

LIFEAT has been in continuous operation since its inception in January 1951,
and as a vital Station operational support asset,"4t.is planned to continue

it indefinitely,

Estimated Costs

The following are the estimated costs for Fiscal Year 1964, All figures
are U,3, dollars per year (US $1.00 equals 12.50 Mexican pesos), Changes *

‘in estimated costs for particular items will be noted. These reflect not

only the continued inflationary trend in the Mexican economy, but also
the LIFEAT operational emphasis of support to Station operations, In this
r case-particular line coverage is of shorter duration, causing
greater expense in installation and removal of tap lines and erosses and

Frequent shifting of basehouse sites,

In the agent salary category total expense in contract agent salaries was
inereased somewhat (due to raises granted DRABARD and ZINSMEISTER during
the past year) and reduced considerably in thé field agent category (due
primarily to termination of three-well paid agents,) Overall funds
requested for FY 196% total $83,605 compared to $99,000 granted for use
An F¥ 1963 -- a reduction of $15,192. A great part of this reduction was
possible by programing no new equipment purchases for the coming year
(see paragraph 16 above),
