Refereace is made to your letter dated March 10,
1965 your file 146-12-3212, and to our letter dated
March 5» 1965, both.concerning the captioned case.

The matter, as outiined in your letter, was
discussed with Harry Zerbell, Economic Officer, United States
Embassy, Hexico City, Mexico, on March 16, 1965, by ovr
Legal Attache there.

Zerbell advised that approximately three weeks
ago he:was informed that a representative of the United States
Attorney for the Eastern District of Texas would come to
Mexico.and contact him for the purpose of discussing this
case and the possibility of obtaining the documents referred
to in r letter: .Zerbell stated that as of March 16, 1965,
the United States Attorney's representative had not. come to

TAR ARNIS

Zerbell was of the opinion that it would be
premature at this time for our Legal Attache to contact
the Attorney General of Mexico and he requested that we
take no action in this regard until he receives additicnal
instructions from the United States rtment of. Commerce
and fron the aforementioned United States, Attorney's office.

In view of the foregoing and.in the absence of a

specific juest from you, we plan to take no further action
in-this matter at this time.

Cuba. Cortez, who is President of Transcontinental §$. A., was
granted prosecutive immunity and is scheduled to be a key
Government witness. He told USA fer Rastern District of .Texas
that certain documents of his firm would serve as corroborative
evidence. Cortez’s firm however, has. been liquidated and
liquidator has declined to show records te U. $. Government
representatives. AAG, in referenced letter, indicated that he
Was aware aur Legat was in contact with AG of Mexico on almost

Mexico to persuade Liquidator to make his records available.
fae pusgested we have our Legat contact Harry Zerbeli, referred
© above.

In addition to information in this Letter, Zerbeil
confidentially told Legat that someone in Washington sometime
ago approached CIA about ébtail instant documents as CIA
in Mexico City has (Clandestiné is Of obtaining documents -
if necessary. Legat advised" of Mexico personally inewn to
