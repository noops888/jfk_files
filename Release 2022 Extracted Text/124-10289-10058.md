JFK)

Reference is made to your letter dated March 10,

1905.

your he 140: 31, and to our letter dated

15, 1905, both concerning the captioned case.

The matter, as outlined in your letter, was

discussed with Harry

terbell, Econonie Officer, United States

Embasay, Mexico City, Mexico, on March 16, 1965, by our

Legal Attache there.

Zerbell advised that approximately three weeks

ago he was informed that a representative of the United States

Attorney for the Bastern District of Texas would come to

Mexico and contact him for the purpose of discussing this

case and the posstority of obtaining the documents referred

to in your letter. Cerbell stated that as of March 16, 1965,

the United States

Attorney's representative had not come to

Mexico.

Zerbell was of the opinion that it would be

premature at this time for our Legal Attache to contact

the attorney General of lexico and he requested that we

take no action in this regard until he receives additional

instructions fron the United States Department of. Comerce

and from the aforementioned United States Attorney's office.

In view of the foregoing and in the absence of a

specifie request from you, we plan to take no

further action

in-this natter at this time.

He told USA for Bastera District of Texas

that certain documents of his fum wenld serve as corroberative

evidence.

however, has been liquidated and

Liquidator has decided to show records to U.S. Governo

representatives:

AAG, in referenced letter,

indicated that

he

was aware our Legat was in contact with AG of Mexico on almost

daily basis and requested that we have our Legat reguest AG of

Mexico to persuade liquidator to make his records available.

AAG suggested we have our Legat contact Harry Zerbell, referred

to above.

In addition to information in this letter, Zerbell

confidentially told Legat that someone in Washington sometime

ago approached CIA about obtaining Instant documents as CLA

•has Clandestine means of obtaining documents

if necessary.

Legat advised NG of Mexico personally known to

him and would probably be cooperative in attempting toobtain

documents providing framework of Mexican law would permit him to
