(2) Mrs. OSCAR ANGULO, wife of CIA source

Bureau Agents, that at (& (S)

at home from an individual, whose voice she recognized

as that of ORLANDO BOSCH AVILA. She indicated she was

in frequent contact with BOSCH and was thoroughly familiar

with his voice.

The caller asked for ANGUlo, and upon

being told he was not at home, stated, "Tell him we put

a bomb on the plane for Merida, " referring to the B-25

cargo plane which was destined

for Merida, Mexico.

After this statement, the caller hung up.

Mrs. ANGULO

advised she received

a later call at about 6:50 AM from

a person believed to be the same individual, and she

advised him her husband had gone to the airport.

She

also inquired if this was not BOSCH calling, after which

the caller hung up.

(3) RICARDO MORALES NAVARRETE, who was arrested

by local authorities on 2/14/68, and charged with one of the

local bombings on 1/25/68, has

advised during interviews with

Bureau Agents, that HECTOR CORNILLOT LLANO, his brother-in-

law, was responsible for the preparation of all anonymous

Cuban Power documents, utilizing the name "GERARDO TORRES

CONTRERAS," however,

was not responsible for those signed

"ERNESTO, General Delegate," which leaflets were prepared

by another faction unknown to him.

Since MORALES' release

from jail on bond on the local charge on 3/1/68, according

to the statements of MORALES, ORLANDO BOSCH has sent severa

messages to him to the effect that he wants to confer with

MORALES is of the opinion BOSCH wishes to confer with

him for the purpose of consolidating the two factions of

Cuban Power.

Regarding the above information from OSCAR ANGULO

REYES and his wife, it is noted both have advised they

will not be willing to testify to this information, because

of ANGULO's association with the CIA.LAAS

In compliance with further instructions set forth

in referenced Bureau airtel,

this matter was discussed with

United States Attorney WILLIAM A. MEADOWS, Jh., and his

Leaflet Beginning "cell Number ?.

TORRES CONTRERAS.".

GERARDO

This leaflet

states

Cell Number 2 of

the Cuban Power in Washington,

D.C. was responsible for the bombing of the

Soviet Embassy on 2/21/68.

The leaflet

was

postmarked in Miami on 2/23/68, and is

believed to be an attempt on the part of

CORNILLOT to capitalize upon the publicity

surrounding this

bombing.

Lealet beginning "Declaration of Principles

of cuban power.

Cell Number 1. GERARDO

TORRES CONTRERAS" This leaflet sets forth

the overall objectiyes of Cuban Power, that

of uniting all Cuban exiles and continuing

the battle against CASTRO to the end.

This

leaflet was distributed by HECTOR CORNILLOT

along with a number of other young Cubans

on the night of 3/8/68, according to

Miami sources.

Through extensive interviews with RICARDO MORALES

NAVARRETE AnD HECTOR CORNILLOT, as well as OSCAR ANGUID REYES

CIA source close to prominent Cuban exile leader ORLANDO

BOSCH AVILA the following facts have been developed:

Power was originated by ORLANDO BOSCH AVILA

and a group of his close associates in the MIRR. BOSCH

and his faction were responsible for the prepartion of

items 1 and 4 above, as well as for instant bombing of

the B-25 cargo plane.

Prior to arrest of MORALES NAVARRETE,

BOSCH was not aware of the identity of the other faction of

Cuban Power whose members were issuing leaflets and bombing

the shipping representatives and agencies of foreign

governments in Miami.

HECTOR CORNILLOT LLANO and his associates began

utilizing the name Cuban Power following the issuance of the

Iirst document above by BOSCH.:

CORNILLOT was not aware of

the Identity of the BOSCH faction and possibly is still not

although it is likely BOSCH may have made contact with him

by this time, CORNILLOT associates Include MORALES,

a CIA trained explosives expert, and OMAR SOTO PUdOl,
