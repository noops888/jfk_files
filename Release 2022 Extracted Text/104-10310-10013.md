1. a. The cryptonym /FUUBE is apparently a garble and{FUSURE
is probably meant instead. This is a cryptonyn belonging to LA
Division assigned to a U.S. citizen formerly of operational interest

3. Mr. Harvey was issued the pseudonym Daniel M. PRESLAND in

1956 and he used this pseudonym until he retired in 1967. This is the
only pseudonym. he used in connection with the ZRRIFLE Project and Cuban
operations. Mr. Harvey was issued the alias William WALKER in May

1962 and he continued to use it while he was Chief of the Cuban
operations until he was reassigned in June 1963. There is no indication
in the file that Mr. Harvey used this alias in connection with the
ZRRIFLE Project. There is no record that Mr. Harvey was ever issued

or used a cryptonym.
