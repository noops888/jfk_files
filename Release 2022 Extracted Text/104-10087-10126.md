State Department cable, No. 234, dated November 2, 1959, reports
that OSWALD was interviewed by the CIA and other embassy officials."

‘ 2. This allegation is absolutely unfounded as the following facts
bear out:

a. The article cites a State Department "cable"
No, 234, dated 2 November 1959, Such "cable" probably
does not exist; however, the State Department despatch,
No. 234, dated 2 November 1959, from the US Embassy

for about one year (1956-1957). BRICKHAM used SNYDER
as a spotter at Harvard where SNYDER was studying Russian
and had access to other students who might be going to the
USSR. There is no record of POA, OA or CSA action in that
connection. In March 1959 (probably just before SNYDER's
departure for Moscow), State requested that he be given two
