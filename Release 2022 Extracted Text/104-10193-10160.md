founded this year: to make money wutof that cusionity.
The idea was that ot Hans-Peter Dietze, now its man-

sure that his publisher, the big Hamburg house of
John Jahe Verlag KG, will do much more than break
even, because, he told me, what millions of people are
insatiably interested in is not “the abstractions” of
nazism and its history but its personalities, and in
particular Adolf Hitler. These, he says, are “simple”
people who donot read books but who watch televi-
sion and read magazines, and it was they whom he set
out to capture ~to clarify the past for them.

His magazine is erpensive- about $1.50 a copy. A
treniendous advertising campaign, of dubious taste,
resulted in first-issue sales sume 150,000 above the
350,009 copies that the editors and publishers e-
pected, The second issue sold between 33000 and
30.000 copies, the third something over 250,090 so

editor b-cause he tarnishes their legends, Ruth Dietze

the small towns, in Bavaria and Franconia especially.

"AND FLOATING OF THE DOLLAR, VON THADDEN DRAWS HEAVILY FROM: : i
‘THE 23 SEPTEMBER PRESS CONFERENCE ‘OF FRENCH “PRESIDENT POMPIDOU. .
HE SAYS THAT THE DOLLAR CAN NO LONGER BE CONSIDERED THE
SINGLE WORLD CURRENCY. THE PRODUCTIVE CAPACITY OF EUROPE
MAKES AT NECESSARY THAT A EUROPEAN RESERVE CURRENCY BE
“AVAILABLE AS A SECOND WORLD CURRENCY. THIS CANNOT BE

VON THADDEN VIEWS PONPIDOU'S SPEECH AS A SIGNAL TO THE
. UNITED STATES THAT THE FRENCH ARE NOT WILLING To STAY
PERMANENTLY UNDER ECONOMIC PRESSURE FROM WASHINGTON, AND
AS PROVIDING AN OUTLINE OF THE TYPE OF ECONOMIC ORDER
EUROPE SHOULD HAVE IN TEE FUTURE, HE CRITICIZES THE WEST

‘West German Ministry of Interior
Evaluation of the Prospects of

FIELD NO. OGA-13 *: ee

Summary? In June 1968, ‘the West German Ministry of the Interior
Prepared a basic study of the-prospects-of banning the West German
National. Democratic Party (NPD). The summary of this study given
below describes the major charges which the government could. bring
against the NPD, the defenses the NPD could be expected to make
against these charges, and the probable political results which
would follow both a successful and an unsuccessful case against the
NPD, According to the source, this study is still considered the
basic Interior Ministry evaluation of the case against the NPD and
ig being studted by senior federal yovernment and state (Land)

officials, End of Summary,

ent: For several years, West German political
ders have debated seeking a constitutional court
ban on the NPD. On 13 November 1968, Ernst Benda, West German
Interior Minister, advised Chancellor Kurt Georg Kicsinger
that there was sufficient evidence to warrant bringing a suit against
the NPD, Kiesinger, however, opposed bringing a suit, “and the sub-
ject became embroiled in West German politics, Gn 23 April 1969,
the Federal Cabinet decided not to sc¢k a court ban of the NPD,

+ least until after the September elections, This decision. was
prompted by evidence that the NPD was making no membership gains
and apparently was losing popular support.)

against the NPD as follows:

as ‘The party could prove that it has given firm inatrue-

e. It could point out that other political parties
have many ex-Nazis and ex-communists as members and could
claim that the majority of the 28,000 NPD members are not

f. It would charge that the government's charges were

5. The study states that 1t would be very airticalt to re-
fute these NPD defenses in court. The government would have to

“admit that since ‘early 1963--there Nave been very few statenents

made ‘by NPD leaders, or ingideats Caused by the ‘NPD, which could
be uséd to support the. government's case. Objectively, it would

c. NPD and rightist sympathizers would begin-a cam-
paign for the banning of the new German Communist Party
(DKP) and other leftist groups.

da. A ban of the NPD would be well received in foreign
countries,

7. The study concludes that 1f the ‘government should lose a
case against the NPD, it would be the result of the lack of valid

evidence (Bewyeisschwierigkeiten)., In ‘such an event, the following

adverse effects would occur:

a, The NPD would receive a new impetus and valuable
publicity.

b. The policy of Selbstreinigung which has had some
success in. keeping former Nazis out of key positions would

be halted..

¢. Many middle-class persons who sympathize with the
NPD, but who have refrained from open support because of
the stigma of being associated with a party which could be
declared illegal, ‘would join the party or become active
supporters.

d. The party would undoubtedly attract more members,
(Field Comment: The NPD leadership is known to be worried
because the party's membership has not increased signifi-
cantly during the past 18 months.)

1. According to a ranking official of the Kiel district
of the National Democratic Party (XPD), Karl-Heinz
Knipphail-s, the chairman of the Kiel district of the
NPD, and Adolf von Thadden, the national chairman
of the NPD, are personal enemies, {Source Comment: In
January 1969 Knipphals was elected to be his party district's
candidate for the West German Parlianent, Knipphals, a Kiel
lawyer, is in his early 50's. He was severely wounded during
World War II and has only, one arn.)

2. Von Thadden is aware of, and unhappy about, the fact
that Knipphals, prior to joining the NPD, participated in
Easter Marches and received unfavorable publicity. Further-
more, voiy Thadden is. concerned about Knipphals' strong and
ruthless political ambitions, He has referred to Knipphals
as a "second Ilitler", and he welcomes and encourages the fact
that there is strong opposition to Xnipphals even within the -
Kiel district of the party, Von Thadden, for the above
reasons, would very much like to see Xnipphals remain on the

German Parliament,

1, A 77-page German-language report, describing the
National Democratic Party (NPD) and presenting documentary
and testimonial evidence of possibly unconstitutional aspects
of the NPD, has been deposited in the files of the CIA Docu-
ment and Pictorial Services Division, from which copies may
be obtained upon.request.. The report is the shorter of two
versions prepared by the Federal Office for the Protection of
the Constitution (Bundesamt fuer Verfassungsschutz). This
shorter version is Said to-be complete in Substance and is
the version which was made available to West German Cabinet
members in preparation for Cabinet discussion of whether the
NPD should be.banned, The longer, two-volume version has not

been obtained,

against the NPD was omitted from the report at the order
of the Minister of the Interior, who reserved to himseif an.-
assessment of the NPD's “legality. Also, pages 9 to 13--a
section entitled Chief Features of the Ideology (Grundzuege

of the Ninister of the Interior. (Headquarters Comment:

The West German Cabinet decided in the spring
of 1969 not to request a ban of the NPD; substantial doubt
existed as to whether there were sufficient grounds to obtain

Ministry of the weakness of the case against the NPD.)

ay and the "Loyalists" headed by the Berlin district leaders, who opposed
the dissolution of the Berlin NPD. ordered by National Party Chairman
Adolf von Thadden in October 1968; . Court action led to the thwarting
of the plan for dissolution, In an effort to keep the Berlin Party
alive, in mid-March von Thadden ordered a cessation of open Party’ ac-
ree " .tivities until after the September parliamentary elections, Subse-

; quently, von Thadden arranged a. postponement of a scheduled Berlin
Party convention until October, because of the possibility of a ban
on the Berlin NPD by. the Allies and the threat of trouble from the
militant left. At ‘the end of March, Berlin City NPD Chief Rudolf
Kendzia resigned in an effort to"promote party unity in Berlin, but
he remains active.behind the scenes, Since carly April, the Berlin
i NPD leadership has followed von Thadden's ‘guidelines. The influence -
a of the Loyalists has been greatly reduced, and in accordance with

von Thadden's instructions party activities have been circumspect.
Both the Berlin and the National leadership are hoping that the NPD
will obtain 25 to 35 Bundestag seats in September, which, they feel,
: will make the party more acceptable to right-wing voters in Berlin
fy and enhance NPD chances’ during .the 1971 Berlin communal elect fons.

membership and others are dropping out quietly, In Maren the paid-up
membership was about 300,) :

2. Following the abortive attempt by the Naticnal Democratic!
Party (NPD) leadership to force the Berlin NPD to dissolve itself for
tactical reasons in October 1968, routine party, activity resdmed al-
most (mmedtately, [t was characterized by a split between the leaders
ship..of ‘the Berlin City (Landésverband) party unit and that of dis-
trict (Kreisverband) party units, The former are generally loyal to
National Party Chairman Adolf von Thadden and the national leadership
in Hanover and their broader tactical concepts; while the, latter, re=
ferred to as the “Loyalists” (Satvungstreue), defend the letver ‘of thé
rlin NPD’statutes, The Loyalists initially objected primarily to
the mechod of the attempted dissolution, but che friction with the
City Executive Committee (Landesvorstand) headed by Rudolf Kendzia
led ‘to: total. mutual mistrust, disloyal statements to the press, and
efforts to get. each. other - expelled fromthe party by a party court

(Schiedsgericht) , 5 4

«3. At a_genexal membership weet ing in Bor lin-qnz}s.. Narch.1968,
von Thaddén tempted to.achieve.a truce within the party and ordered
that: there be -no "political, organizational activity" until after the

September 1969 parliamentary elections, At this meeting von Thadden
ipproved the scheduling. of a Berlin party convention (Landesparteitag)

* for 26 “April 1969, at which a new and hopefully more stable city

Executive Committee was to be elected.

4. The 15 March meeting provided an indication that the Berlin
NPD may well stick together under. von Thadden's guidance until 1971,
in spite of the friction between city and district leadership, Al-"
though the’ eight "spokesmen for the local leadership, who took the
floor after Kendzia's situation report and von Thadden's icynote
speech, approved the action of the Berlin NPD districts in opposing
the self-dissolutton of the local party, and no one contradicted them,
all but 3l-of the 140 members present then voted for a ‘resolution con-
demning District Chiefs Johann Ratzek (Schueneberg) and Philipp
Goelles (Wilmersdorf), leaders of the Loyalists, for anti-party ac-
tivity. This vote amounted to a vote of confidence in the tactics of
the Berlin -City leadership, and according to members present was due
solely to von Thadden's presence and influence, In the view of these
members, a meeting without the attendance of representatives of the
Hanover headquarters would have led.to a no-confidence vote in the
Kendzia leadership. During the meeting, von Thadden also rejected

‘Kendzia's "Berlin Program," which called for a softer line on East

Germany and on German reunification.

5.. At the 15 March session, left-wing, anti-NPD protestors
assaulted a number of NPD members and forced the NPD twice to change
its meeting site, This leftist action and the obvious fact that the
militant left has a penetration of the Berlin NPD have had a seri-
ously dampening effect on the NPD's willingness to meet in the open,
The party is now tentatively planning to hold future meetings on a
rented excursion boat whose location would not be announced until the

time of the meeting.

6, The Berlin NPD has made strenuous efforts to determine which
left-wing organizations made up the task force which tried to disrupt
the 15 March meeting. The Extraparliamentary Opposition (APO) claimed
the honor, but the NPD investigation showed definitely that all but a
handful of the protestors were an organized group dispatched by the
Spandau branch of the West Berlin Socialist Unity. Party (SEW) whose
actions are part of a long-range program of harassment by the East

Berlin Socialist Unity Party (SED).

7, -Because of the subsequent possible threats of prohibition
by the Allies (signalled by a letter from Governing Mayor Klaus
Schuetz to the Allies asking that’ the NPD in Berlin be banned) and of
further counter-demonstrations by the militan€ left, on 27 March
von Thadden wrote a letter to the Berlin.City leadership asking that

11, Kendzia and a majority of the NPD leaders hope that the fall
elections will bring some 25 to 35 NPD members into the Bundestag.

37.3 percent). The liberal Free
Democratic Party (FDP), made a
slight gain, winning 14.4 percent
of the vote (1964: 13.1 percent).
Against’ the background of last
October's Bremen elections, in
which the National Democratic
Party won what was then a record
percentage of 8.9, the Baden-
Wuerttemberg results brought re-
newed cries of alarm over the
dangers of neo-Nazism in the Fed-
eral Repubiic, More, important,
the results also raised doubts
as to the future of a coalition
government by the Christian Den-
ocrats and Social Democrats, not
only in Baden-Wuerttemberg but
at the federal government level
as well,

Baden-Wuerttemberg: A Test Case

Baden and Wuerttemberg tra-
ditionally have been strongholds
of liberal, nonsocialist democ-
racy in Germany. In the early
1930s, the Nazi vote in this
area was almost always appreci-

s

| ably lower than elsewhere in
Germany. The hotbeds of Nazism
lay in other regions, for ex-
ample in Franconia, East Pruasia,
and. Schleswig-Holstein.

The e¢onomic and social pic-
ture in Baden-Wuerttenberg would
lead to expectations of ‘stability
there. The proportion of the
population. now employed -in in-
dustry is higher than in any
other state. The ecoriomy of the ©
state was virtually untouched by
the recent West German recession,
during which unemployment never
exceeded one percent. Per cap-
ita income is above average.
Protestants and Catholics are
almost evenly balanced in pop-
ulation, while the proportion of
protestants in the Federal Re-
public is slightly higher,

A few observers correctly
forecast the outcome, but the
general expectation was that the
vote for the National Democratic
Party would be lower than in
Bremen, The two major West Ger-
man polling organizations had
predicted in March that the NPD
would receive five percent of the
vote.

Federal-level politicians
had campaigned actively in the
state. Chancellor Kurt Kiesinger,
a popular native son, made a
three-day speaking tour, in which
he sharply attacked “arrogant,
thoughtless, and dangerous na-
tionaliym."’ He stressed this
theme in the Hohenlohe area,
where the NPD later received its
highest vote in the state. Willy
Brandt also appeared to speak for
the Social Democrats.

The participation by na- .
tional figures reflected a -feel-
ing in-Bonn that this state elec-
tion, the last before the 1969"
federal election, might influence
national politics. Tho analogy
to the; federal scene was pointed

“up by ‘the existence in Badan-,

Wuerttemberg of a coalition of
Christian Democrats and Social
Democrats, similar to that in
Bonn.

Reaction to, Student Riots

In looking for explanations
of the NPD gains, German observ-
ers have emphasized the public
reaction against the Easter stu-
dent rioting, and dissatisfaction
with the federal grand coalition.
Conservatives. lean to the former
explanation, while students and
trade‘unionists stress the latter.
The NPD did not receive less than
6 percent in any electoral dis-
trict. This suggests that the .
sentiment expressed by the vote
is widespread, and may extend
throughout the FRG.

Reaction to student rioting
probably contributed sorething,
but this aspect seems to have
been exaggerated as a factor in
NPD gains, In Heidelberg, the
PD vote rose to 11.9 percent,
but in three other university
towns, the party's vote fell
below the state average of 9.8
percent. In industrial Esslingen,
where there had been two stu-
dent riots, the NPD only attained
9 percent. Some voters may have
been influenced by student dem-
enstrations to transfer their
votes from the SPD to the CDU,
whose spokesmen have generally ad-
vocated a stern treatment of
rioters,

At the same’ time, ‘thé “néw
left" certainly failed to win
popular support. The Democratic
Left, supported by radical stu-
dents, won only 2.3 percent in
the state as a whole, while mak-
ing better showings in certain
university and industrial local-
ities. While the Democratic
Left's stato-wide average was bet-
ter’ than the far left had at-
tained in recent elections under
other names, it fell below the
last, low figure gained’ by the
Communists before they became
illegal: 3.2 percent.

Hostility to the Grand Coalition?

There is dissatisfaction
with the coalition within the:
coU, and it can be. assumed that
some of the party's right wing
voted for the National’ Democrats.
The Socialists, however, suffered
the greater loss. Left-of-center
Socialists often complain that
thé party has compromised its
principles and lest public favor.
‘here is an undercurrent of feel-
ing in these quarters that the
party has endangered German democ-
racy .by abandoning its long-
time position of opposition and
entering into collaboration with
the CDU.

Although the SPD has pro-
vided much of the impetus to ‘the.
grand coalition's economic and
foreign policies, and although
the coalition in Baden-uerttem-
berg has generally functioned
well, dissatisfaction undoubtedly
exists among idealistic members
of the left and among tradition-
ally class-conscious union: mem-
bers. ttiddle class voters of
this persuasion probably turned

“some Socialists conclude that”

many ‘SPD voters defected to the
NPD. The respected Frankfurter
Allgemeine Zeitung fudged some

f the election data to support
its argument that workers had
gone over to the NPD, but.a more
careful analysis has shown that
the NPD did indeed win above-av-
erage support.in some working-
class neighborhoods.

Many. old Socialists and
trade unionists, such as Willt
Bleicher, the powerful boss of
the metalworkers in this state,
are cool to the coalition and
hostile to intellectuals, and .
some of them are repelled by an-~
archic student leftism. Even so,
nost workers ‘are unlikely under
conditions of full employment to
cast what they would consider a
neo-Nazi vote; certainly Bleicher
would never favor such ‘action.
SPD electoral losses would seem
to be due less to defection to
the NPD than to the failure of
lower-level SPD functionaries,
apathetic, or evenhostile toward
the coalition, to get out’ the
vote, and to the failure of many
trade union and normally SPD
voters to go to the polls.

In traditionally socialist
Mannheim, only 58 percent of
those entitled to vote turned out,
SPD percentages dropped 14 per-
cent in one district and 13 per-

votes would not be needed to pro-.
vide these percentages, espe-
cially in the facé of.a low SPD
tifnout. These votes probably
came mainly from thé CDU, the
FOP, or from those who had not
voted before.

NPD Activity Pays Off

The NPD organization worked
hard during the campaign, con-
ducting more meetings than all
the other parties put together.
The party has overcome its former
inexperience and disunity,, and
is developing into a well-oiled
political machine. The organ-
ization fields speakers and pro-
vides canned speeches and prop-
aganda materials to local groups.
The NPD's heritage is not purely
Nazi, It encompasses more re-
spectable antecedents, such as
the Deutschnationaler (German
Nationalists) and other conser~
vative elements. In the inter-
ests of avoiding a government
ban, the National Democratic
Party shuns blatantly Nazi
appeals ‘and tactics.

Adolf von Thadden, the na-
tional leader of the NPD, is a
smooth personality from a Junker
family who denies charges that
he was an active Nazi. He seems
to model himself more on De
Gaulle than on Hitler, The
Baden-Wuerttemberg leader of the
party, Wilhelm Gutmann, is a
former Nazi. During "the good :

The FOP profited from its

the University of. Konstanz with
an international reputation, has

. recently entered the party and
has assumed a leading role, in-
tuencing the FOP in a loftward
: direction and attracting left~
liberal support. In the Stuttgart
district where he was a candidate,
the party vote rose by 6 percent.
On the other hand, the new pat-
tern is not acceptable to many

ical students. ‘Two of the three

Perspectives on the Vote

to be that while both the Chris-

crats lost to the NPD, they gained
at the expense of the Socialists.

At the same time, the FDP
appears not to be in a mood to
return to a coalition in cither
Bonn or Stuttgart. Dahrendorf
has suggested that there might be
a CbU minority government in the
state, State CDU leaders may,
however, prefer to call new elec-
tions if a coalition cannot be
formed. In this event, they
would appeal for an absolute ma~
jority from the voters. If they
got it and if the NPD vote de=
clined, this would be encouraging,
but new elections might also have
1 a less favorable outcome.

A collapse of the grand

the SPD to opposition positions
would signify more than a passing
cabinet crisis. In the past,
parties ‘tended to harden into
intransigence, committed to par-

interests,’ and unable to reach
pragmatic compromises with each
other. In recent years, West
German politicians have tried ‘to

Bonn_and Weimar

Many misleading analogies
have been drawn between the Bonn

and Weimar republics. One Weimar

precedent may help, however, to

- ° SECRET

explain why some observers view -

the coalition problem seriously.
In March 1930, another grand
coalition with SPD participation
collapsed ovar the question of

Guts in unemployment insurance,

leading to ‘the formation of a
conservative majority government
under Heinrich Bruening. Bruening
was later replaced by the reac-
tionary Franz von Papen, who in
turn was followed first by a wire-.
pulling general, Kurt von Schlei-
cher, and ‘then by Adolf Hitler.
The worst aspect of the SPD with-
drawal was that it made the par-
liament ineffective and power-
less.

Once minority government was
embarked on, supported by presi-
dential prérogatives, there was
no effective test for legitimacy
except the will of Hindenburg by
then susceptible and old. The
Nazis ultimately came to power,
not by a majority vote, but through
the paralysis and impotence of the
constitutional system and through
intrigues in the presidential
palace on the part of those, espe-
cially Papen and Schleicher, who
thought they could "use" Nazi
mass support.

In contrast to the 30s,
the presidential powers now are
far weaker,* and aside from all
the other factors inhibiting a
recurrence, the Weimar precedent
itself must influence SPD leaders
in Bonn. They are completely
dommitted personally to the pres-
ent coalition. A decision to
go into opposition is unlikely
under Brandt and Wehner.

“The absence of executive emergency powers is not of course without dangers. In a butter parlismentary deadlock, an

illegal assumption of power, perhaps Ly extragovernmentil elemen

, might be the only way out.

Another possibility might
bé & ‘left-wing withdrawal from
the SPD, although the, leadership
for a dissident. faction has yet
to-emerge. This might provide
a healthy outlet “for criticism
of the system withoat’a turn to
minority rule. Unlike the early
1930s, virtually all West Ger-
man politicians now would do their
best to maintain a functioning
constitutional system, Real. ~
dangers will probably not arise
unless, as in the late Weimar
period, the government finds it-
self confronted with economic
or political problems which seem
to defy compromisé settlenent or
rational solution:

Immediate Prospects

Assuming that’ the Bonn co-
alition lasts until the 1969
elections, its leading members
may still modify their policies
somewhat in the light of the
Baden-Wuerttemberg experience.

The adverse vote of the refugees
in the recent election could act
as a brake on the policy of de-
tente with Czechoslovakia and
Poland, although there is no sign
of this as yet. Chancellor Kie-
singer has attributed NPD gains
partly to "years of agitation
against our own history and against
healthy self-confidence," which
suggests that he may try to sound
amore nationalistic note. To

Brandt sent a telegram to SPD

state headquarters, advising that

speakers should react "completely

hard” against student demonstra-

tions.

Although the antistudent re-
action does not seem to have been
as important a factor as some have
believed it to be, constant vio-
lence and provocation on the part
of the students, accompanied by
constant press attention, could
lead to severe official or unof-
ficial counteraction. This, in
turn, could bring more serious
student violence, perhaps with
the support of other elements.

Some matters of student con-
cern have appeal for others. Thus
students and many trade unionists
oppose emergency laws, and this
question is again being agitated.
Because of the Nazi expericnce,
there is widespread aversion among
left-of-center elenents to the
use of force in the name of "or-
der," however great the provoca-
tion. But also because of the
Nazi experience, a really large
increase in NPD votes does not
seem likely in the 1969 election,
or in an earlier new election in
Baden-Wuerttember should that
come to pass. (CONFIDENTIAL)

' : : “THE NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY ‘IN WEST GERMARY

.. The poor ‘showing of the ultranatilonalistic
National Democratic Party (NPD)! in recent elections i A
in several West German states clearly disproves the
party's claim of providing an acceptable alternative
to the policies .and programs of the country's maior
parties. ‘The NPD's failure to. maintain the momentum
Suggested by the successes scored in two state
elections last fall is directly attributable both
to its own well-publicized internal dissension and
te voter preference for the Christian Democrats and

Socialists deriving from the image of vigor and
decisiveness imparted by their “grand coalition*

under Chancellor Kiesinger.

Barring some serious

reversal in the fortunes of the Kiesinger government--

which -is unlikely--it is doubtful that the NPD will

be any more successful than cther fringe groups have

been in seeking to rally latent right-radical s:

ment in Germany and revive it as a dynamic political

force.

Election Setbacks

The NPD has claimed wide
attention both in Germany and
abroad and led many observers
to conclude that it was a force
to be reckoned with, ‘Within two
and a half years of its founding
in November 1964, the party
elected representatives to the
legislatures in five of West
Germany's ten states (11 counting
West Berliny. In elections this
April the party was expected to
obtain close to 10 percent of
the vote in Rhineland-Palatinate
and 12 to 15 percent in Schleswig-
Holstein but actually won only
four seats in each parliament
with 6.9 and 5.8 percent of the

basé bastion" of Lower Saxony,
the NPD's performance was simi-
larly unimpressive--7 gercent

of the. vote and 10 Langtag seats..

Emphasis by party leaders
on their success in gaining rep-
resentation in all the states
where the party has conzeted
during the past year has not
masked their disappointzent that
the NPD's momentum of growth has
leveled off. The party's failure
to make a good showing in
Schleswig-Holstein and Lower
Saxony--areas considered particu-
larly susceptible to nationalist

appeals--is especially damaging,

about the party's futur

” Origins: and Early Success:

‘Formed from the remnants of,
the“defunct German Reich ‘Party
(DRP)--one of .a number -of' ultra-
nationalistic: splinter groups
which have dotted the political
landScape of. postwar Germany~-the
NBD. quickly established a polit-
ical apparatus capable of func~
tioning throughout the country.
The new party soon distinguished ©
itself by its relative success
in attracting the support of other
ultranationalistic-elements and a
variety of political: malcontents.
Earlier:attemets by other groups
to unite disparate nationalists
invariably had foundered on -per-
sonal rivalries and tactical dis-
agreements. Sone were. no more
than platforms for self-expres=
sion by leaders advocating a
particular set of extremist no-
tions. Even the most successful,
the Socialist Reich Party (SRP),
which at its high water mark
obtained 11 percent of the vote
in the. Lower Saxony Landtag elec-
tions in‘1951, was unable to
establish effective working rela~
tions with rival rightist groups
before it!was outlawed by the
West German supreme court in
1952. :

During its first year, the
NPD encountered many of the prob-
lems experienced by its predeces-
sors. The party was unable to put
on an effective campaign for the
September 1965 national elections
and obtained only 2 percent of
the votes-“short of the 5-percent
minimum required for representa-
tion in the Bundestag. In local

Page 3

elections in Bavaria and Schleswig~
Holstein in March 1966, however, .
the .NPD showed that it could com-
mand pockets of strength. In the
Bavarian cities of Nuremberg and

“| Bayreuth, it received between 7

and 10 percent of the vote and _
elected representatives to the lo-
cal governing councils, These
gains were facilitated by concen-
trating the party's efforts in
selected areas such as the Protes-
tant centers of Middle and Upper
‘Franconia in heavily Catholic
Bavaria.

The first clear demonstra-
tion that the NPD could attract
more than the ultranationalist
vote came two weeks later in ~~~
Hamburg, where the party nearly
doubled ‘its vote as compared with
the Bundestag election the year
before. Although the NPD failed
to elect any deputies, the Chris-
tian Democrats and the Socialists
were concerned about its ability
tO secure even 3.9 percent of
the vote. The threat to the tra-
ditional third party, the conserva-
tive Free Democrats (FDP) became ,
apparent. The FDP fell a third
below its 1965 vote and lost 4 of
its 12 seats in the Hamburg city
council. Profiting from a decline
in the economy which was already
under way and the increasing pub-
lic disenchantment with the lead-
ership of then Chancellor Erhard
in Bonn, the NPD accelerated both
its organizational effort and its
public relations campaign.

The stage was then set for

For the major parties, the
NPD's successes had disturbing
implications. In contrast to its
various predecessors, the NPD
appeared cupable of robilizing
urban as well as ruzal support
and of altering the general trend
long evident in most West German
elections toward a two-party
system. In Hesse, the combined
vote of the Christian Democrats
and Socialists was a lower per-
centage of the tote! vote than in
the provious election four years
earlicr. Still more significantly,
however, Hesse and Bavaria ‘pro-
vided further evidence of the
HeD's ability to attract "pro-
test" votes from various dis-
affected lower-middle-class ele-
ments including small businessmen
and farmers unhappy with their
lot in. present-day Germany.

cs_and

Basic Characteri
post

Sources _of $

In spite of its direct
lineage from the old German
Reich Paity, the NPD has tried
to dispel the impression among

SRET : \

the general public that it is the
spiritual heir of Hitler's Na- j

tional Socialists. The party has
sought acceptance as a legitinate

| political party and insists that

it intends to function within the
established democratic order.
Party spokesmen maintain that it
differs irom the established par~
ties primarily in its allegedly
superior devotion to the national
interest, which they accuse the
governing parties in Bonn of
having failed to protect. ‘The
NPD says it offers the voter a
genuine choice between bankrupt
policies of the major parties and
a return to national morality.

As much as some NPD support-
ers might wish to play down the
party's Nazi associations, how-
ever, it has been clearly estab-
lished that the leadership con-
sists of a nucleus of former
Nazis, who nave been active in
neo-Nazi parties throughout the
postwar years. According to
police reports, some 2,000 of
the estimated 25,000 members cf
the NPD belonged to the Nazi party
before 1933. This ratio is roughly
eight times that for the public
as a whole. The party has lost
libel suits in which it has chal-
lenged charges of neo-Nazism.

The German Interior Ministry

notes the parallels in political
outlook and philosophy between

the NPD and the Nazis, and main-
tains that the party's activities
“approach” unconstitutionality.

In the words of one former party
member, the NPD is made up of
people “who have forgotten nothing
and learned nothing” from Germany's

| past.

The Bonn government is gen-
erally reluctant, however, to ban
the NPD, believing that it would
be imprudent to drive the ultra-
rightists underground... Tf the
NPD were ‘to ‘score impressive new.
successes in future elections,
‘however, the resulting concern
in the major parties might prompt
& reconsideration of this policy.
Interior Minister Luecke favors
banning the party as socn as
idence can be obtained
to assuré successful court action.
It is also possible that new
NPD gains would motivate the
established parties to make pro~
posed changes in the electoral
law that would make it more dif-
ficult for the NPD to obtain
Bundestag representation.

Although the NPD program is
strongly reminiscent of Hitlerian
National Socialism, the party's
electoral supporters in Hesse
and Bavaria also include persons
lia
tions or any particular suscepti-
bility to Nazism per se. It has
naged to attract impulsive
youngsters, as well as political _
malcontents of all ages. . Its
membership includes individuals
from a broad range of occupations.
The NPD's special appeal among
the lower-middle-class, and par-
ticularly ‘among the small business-
men and farmers is reinforced by
the economic squeeze these groups
are experiencing as a result of
government economy measures. In
Hesse and Bavaria, the party did
especially well in areas noted
for traditional German nationalism

and in areas which are predomi-
nantly Protestant. Many NPD ad-

I herents are expellees from the

territories lost at. the end of
World War IT.

. The makeup of the formal
NPD membership is not radically
different in age or occupatio
group from a.cross section of the
general public. However, there
are certain characteristics of
NPD supporters which set them
apart from supporters of the
three major-parties. The NPD
tends to attract a somewhat larger
number of older persons as well
as young adults, and the number
of lcver middle class members,
including pensioners, is dis-
proportionately large. Formal
membership among students, how-
ever, is very small and only 350
of a total of 244,000 university
students are on the party rolls.

There is no evidence that
the NPD receives significant
financial support from German
industrialists. It is, however,
able to operate in the black.

The sound state of its finances
is in part a result of its prac-
tice of charging admission to its
rallies. This serves the double
function of making the rank and
file feel that they have a stake
in the party and of making it
necessary for its opponents to
pay for the right to heckle. The
party also derives considerable
sums from membership dues, sub-
scriptions to party publications,
and donations from members and
sympathizers.

Rumors of clandestine fi-
nancial support from the Commu-
nists or from sympathizers among
Nazi emigrants: to: Latin America
;have not been confirmed.

Despite NPD claims:of wide-
spread sympathy in.the West German
armed forces, there is no evidence
of this.’ German security offi- -
cials estimate that no more than

2 percent of armed forces members
are card-carrying NPD-members.
Since :the NPD is ‘a-legal political
organization, military leaders
are constrained from openly in-
fluencing members of the armed
forces to oppose it. ‘

Many Germans are probably
reluctant openly to admit their
support for an organization like
the NPD. It is significant, how-
ever, that only 6 percent of
respondents to a national opinion
poll in January 1967 indicated a
preference for the NPD.

Leadership Problems -

The most notable single
handicap confronting the NPD is
the weakness of its leadership.
None of its leaders possesses any
great talent or stature. Cer-
tainly no individual with Hitler's
demagogic genius has yet ap-
peared. ‘The absence of strong
leadership in what has bzen called
a “fuehrer-oriented party" has
left it divided and weakened by
factionalism. This was clearly
demonstrated in March 1967 wher.
‘then party chairman Fritz Thielen
and Deputy Chairman Adolf von
Thadden engaged in a public feud
which further damaged the party's

reputation. An outgrowth of long-
standing personal antagonism, the
dispute was triggered by Thielen's
resistance to Von Thadden's at-
tempted take-over as party chair-
mari in Lower Saxony. Thielen
claimed that Von Thadden's elec-
tion to the state chairmanship
had been illegal and would hurt
the party's reputation, The par-
ty's federal executive, however
turned the tables on Thielen and
not only voted to reinstate Von -
Thadden but also to drop Thielen
from the national chairmanship and
expel him from the party. Thielen
clung to the helm under a temporary.
court order until finally throwing
in the sponge in early May with

an announcement of his formation
of a new, rival part,, the Na-
tional Peoples Party (NVP).

More of an archconservative
than a neo-Nazi, Thielen was never
more than a figurehead. Real au-
thority and leadership--as well as
ideological guidance--was provided
by Von Thadden. Von Thadden is
a 45-year-old native of Pomerania,
a member of a prominent and aris-
tocratic Prussian family, a number
of whose members were prominent
in the anti-Nazi resistance. Al-
though Von Thadden applied for
Nazi party membership he appar-
ently was never formally admitted.
An ardent nationalist, Von Thadden
aspires to become a German De
Gaulle rather than a re-creator of
the German Reich.

Other leaders of some promi-
nence include Otto less, party
propaganda chief, and Waldemar
Schuetz, editor of the NPD's

official weekly, Deutsche
Nachrichten. Both were active

Nazis.

Thielen's departure: clears
the way for Von Thaddea formally
to take over leadership’ of the
NPD. It is doubtful that Thiclen

has the personal force or ‘follow-.
ing to organize a party with
significant strength. The impact
of the new party on the NPD will
probably be small since the bulk
of the NPD membership appears to
prefer the leadership: and ideology
of the Von Thadden’ group. On
the other hand, the strengthening
of extremist tendencies within the
NPD signaled by the triumph of

Von Thadden may hurt the party's
interests in the long run, The
result is also likely to assist
those actively seeking a formal
government crackdown on the party.

Program

In addition to its leadership
difficulties, another failing of
the NPD is its inability as yet to
offer a clear, positive program
relevant to existing problems.
Nenophobie and opportunistic, the
NPD feeds upon nostalgia for an
older German nationalism, discon-
tent with the existing social or-
der, and Germany's international
standing and frustration over the
fact that reunification remains
as distant a prospect as ever.

Its stated objectives are ill de-
fined, when not deliberately am-
biguous, and are sometimes incon-
sistent. Its electoral approach
is generally negative and destruc-
tively critical rather than af-
firmative. Its principal targets

include foreign intérests and cul=
ture which undermine old values :
and “de-Germanize the fatherland."
It attacks the renunciation by
those in power’of what the NPD
regards as justified German ob-
jectives. It deplores what it
considers the miseducation and
corruption of youth, “crime in the
streets," foreign aid, and the.
competition of foreign workers,

The NPD demands an end to
German dependence on the US and
calls for the revival of German
national consciousness. Tt at-
tempts to draw a parallel between
West German ~ US relations and
those between the East German
regime and the USSR. In order to
free Germany from foreign domina-
tion, NPD spokesmen maintain,
American "occupation" forces must
go, although not before the with-
drawal of Russian troops, which
the NPD would have occur simultane-
ously with that of US troops.
Germany must again become master
of its éwn fate, party leaders in-
sist, and the “lie” of war guilt
and war crimes trials must be
ended and a new German general
staff created. A key demand is
that the reunification of Germany
cannot be limited to uniting West
and East Germany but must include
the lands heyond the Oder-Neisse
border now eld by Poland. Al-
though it does not advocate the
use of force to achieve this ob-
jective, the party holds out hope
that recovery will be possible by
a Machiavellian deal of some sert
NPD spokesmen at present renounce
a national nuclear capability for
Germany.

a

The: party puts forth slogans
proclaiming "Germany for the Ger-
mans" and “Europe for the Euro- ~
peans." . Indeed, ‘the NPD favors
a united Europe somewhat ‘along the
lines advocated by De Gaulle.
Europe, it holds, should be" com-
pletely independent of the US,
and possess its own nuclear deter-
rent. It should be built on a
Franco-German alliance that smaller
European countries sooner or lator
would have to join. The NPD would
welcome the decay of NATO as sig-
naling the end of sterile policies
Which do not serve Germany's real
interests.

In secking to gain the broad-
est popular acceptance, the party
avoids affirming the more extrema
aspects of Nazi ideology. There
is, for example, no obvious anti-
Semitism in the party program -
and Jews technically could become
party members, The private atti-
tudes of the leadership, however,
are said to resemble traditional
Nazi anti-Semitism closely. The
NPD makes vague references, more-
over, to the importance of "blood
ties," rejects evidence relating
to the Nazi extermination policy,
makes derogatory references to
the Jews in the party press, and
denounces aid to Israel.

In recent campaigning in
Lower Saxony, NPD spokesmen
shifted tactics somewhat by no
longer stressing issues obviously
associated with the Nazi period
such as war guilt and reparations.-
Instead, they sought to exploit
current grievances including
the economic recession, unemploy-
ment, lack of progress on reuni-

fication, and. what they called
the unreliability of NATO.

Future Prospects

The NPD's failure to main-
tain the momentum of last fall's
successes in this year's state
elections in Schleswig-Holstein,
Rhineland-Palatinate, and Lower
Saxony is a serious blow to the
party's hopes. The squabble
among the leadership apparently
reinforced the feeling among un-
committed elements that casting
a protest vote for the NPD was
not worthwhile under present cir-
cumstances. The widespread dis-
content among farmers over gov-
ernment economy measures did not
result in a significant shift of
votes to the NPD. Moreover,
there has been a strong resur-
gence of general ‘confidence in
the Bonn government. Although
the NPD benefited last fall from
the popular dissatisfaction with
the Erhard government, the grand
coalition headed by COU Chancellor
Kiesinger has displayed vigor and
decisiveness which has been re-
warded at the polls.

Even if the NPD were to fol-
low its forerunners into oblivion
it-would not mark the end of right-
ist extremism. A portion of the
German electorate will remain re-
ceptive to this kind of appeal.

In the absence of, a party such as
the NPD, right-wing voters tend

to give their support to one of
the insignificant splinter par-
ties, or to one of the more con-
servative established parties,

such as the FDP, when they yote

at all,

Page 9 SPECIAL REPORT 9 Jun, 67



It is possible--although i
creasingly-unlikely--that the NPD
could turn’ out ‘to’ resemble other
parties of a national-conserva-
tive stamp.. Despite the radical
views of some of thoir members,
such groups have.managed..to. op-
erate without. subversive mani-.
festations. ‘The ‘German Party (DP),
for example, which had been rep-
‘resented in several North’ German
state legislatures and in the
Bundestag conducted itself. in a
responsible fashion. .

The NPD at present draws, a
good deal of this traditional
right-wing vote from the old Refu-
gce Party, the DP, and small con-
servative regional parties such
as the Bavarian Party. The total
extremist vote, however, has in-
creased very little since the
establishment of the NPD. Es-
timates of the extent of hard-core
ultranationalist sentiment in
Germany vary between 5 and 15 per-
cent of the electorate. Under
present conditions this does not
constitute a threat to German dem-
ocratic institutions and is not

greater than the degree of ex-
tremist sentiment in-other West-
ern, European countries.”

Outlook

‘Assuming the NPD’ survives
the current period of internal
strife, its potential for further
growth beyond its present 6- to
8-percent range appears to be
limited under conditions now -pre-
vailing in West Germany. The NPD
is still capable of éapitalizing
on circumstances which might pre-
sent themselves as a result of a
protracted economic recession or
major political blunders which
would discredit the presént gov-
ernment leadership. The outcome
of recent state elections, how-
ever, tends to confirm that the
overwhelming majority of German
voters continues to prefer the
noderate ;-albett increasingly ~

1... (Summary: The West German Federal Office for the Protection
*. of the Constitution (Bf£V) and its regional affiliates
(L£V¥) have undertaken a program to monitor and counter
. the activities of the National Democratic Party (NPD).
fia Included in this program are efforts to penetrate the NPD
at all its levels, to monitor its membership end finances,
and to counter its influen

‘+8. Reports For a number’ of ‘years the BfV has been engaged in
penetrating and monitoring the activities of right radical
organizations. Since tho establishment of the NPD 47, - os nyo,
1964,the BfV has made a concerted effort to penetrate it
at both the national and regional levels. This effort has
resulted in the recruitment of about 60 sources with access
to the NPD organizations at.oll levels. In several cases
the BfV or LfV have been able to recruit local NPD county
chairmen and in six Lacnder have access to the minutes and

\ files of the Land organizations. Tho BfV has also penetrated |
tho. national headquarters of the NPD in Hannover.” .

3. Through its penetration of the national organization, the
BfV has been able to obtain and photograph the entire men-
bership rolls, which currently contain about 20,000 names,
The national list has been augmented by additional member~
ship applications obtained via ponotrations of the 2. i ;

; Land organizations. The BfV is currently in the process |
of tracing all of these membership applications against
the master Nazi Party membership files at the American

Activity han.not ken conpleted'and is bindicapped by lack
of personnel at thé Berlin Document Cenicr, the BEV estinetes
its current file on the NPD 1s far more accurate than the

files at. the

NPD headquarters.

Because of its access to

the Berlin Document; Center, the BLY will. éventually, have
a better estimate of the number of NPD members who are
former Nazi Party membarg than does. the NPD. itself.

The BfY ‘is also making a concerted effort to obtain docu-.

help who ‘worl

to filés. ' Information in‘the ‘BfV's possession to date,
which-includes considerable’ documentary. evidence regarding
finanées, indicates that the party is not’ receiving any
substantial’ financial..essistance from abroad. The primcipal

sources of funds are as ‘follows:

ay The monthly DM 3.~

membership dues, For the

‘20,000 members, this amounts’ to DM 60,000 per month
or, DM. 720,000 a year.

b, Subscription fecs for publications.

members

and supporters.

c. Single donations from financially well-to-do

d. Admission fees for political rallies. The BfV
has registered, since May 1966 when the NPD began its
campaign in Bavaria, a total of more than 2900 polit-

ical rallies in Bavaria.

Although at times more than

one. third.of those attending. such -rallies were
estimated to be opposed to the NPD, everyone attending
the rally paid an admission fee. The BfV estimates
that the NPD has heen able through the above sources
of income to collect from DM 3,000,000 to D¥ 4,000,000.
The LfV are watching this funding quite closely,
particularly for evidence of financing from Communist

countries,

Thus far they have been unable to sub-

setantiate the existence of any such support. Although
thero in-no firm evidence of actual financisl support

of the NPD from Communist sources, the BfV is aware

of an interest'-on the part of the Eastern inte)ligeace
services to penetrate the NPD anc monitor its activities,

At the instigation of Tedeval Minister of {nterior Luecke,

the B£V has undertaken to establish

confidential 21l-party

committec consisting of mempers of the Social Democratic
Party (SPD), Free Democratic Party (FDP), and the Christian
Democratic Union (CDU) and the Trade Union Movement (DGi)
to counter the NPD in Rheinland-Pfalz prior to the upcoming

elections in spring’ 1467.

All of the parties have agreed

to participate and this activity is moving ahead. Recently
at a two-day conference chaired by the BfV in‘’a village

on the Mosel River, it was decidéd not only to counteract
NPD. propaganda during the election campaign, but also to
undertake orientation lectures for all officials in the.

the campaign

gets underway.

A similar propaganda and

ofientation activity-is also being planned for the elections
in Schleswig-Holstein.in 1967,

“The BfV has persuaded the DGB to set up an action group

aimed at organizing the Labor movement into countering the

influence of the NPD, The BfV is assisting the DGB in
working out methods for the infiltration of workers into
NPD organizations to report and counteract their influence
within factories and workers councils. , The BfV has also
establishéd contact with the German Industrial Institute
in Cologhé, which..is sponsored by the German equivalent of
the U.S. National-AsSociation of Manufacturers. The BfV
used as an argument withthe industrialists the fact that
inéreasing. influence of the NPD in Gernan industry would
have a negative effect upon foreign trade.”

,. The BEV undertook avsurvey of the élection results at ‘the
village and county vel in Land Resse. This survey showed .

- that the NPD had substantial success in ‘areas containing
Gernan military installations. It was ‘further determined
“that -the ‘NPD' had considerable appeal among non-commissioned
professional soldiers who feel. they have failed to find
acceptance in the postwar German society. This negative
‘attitude has been less among Bundeswehr officers and draftees

than among: non-commissioned officers, who feel theriselves under-

paid and lacking in social acceptance. The BfV has contacted
the sécurity organizations of the Bundeswehr to under- ~
take a ‘program of orientation to counter the influence of
the NPD within the Bundeswehr.

Headquarters Comment: CS-311/16288-66 from a different
Source reported that the President of the West German
Association of Military Reservists had stated that a
large percentage of older reserve officers and non-
commissioned officers had voted for the NPD in the Land
Hesse election.
