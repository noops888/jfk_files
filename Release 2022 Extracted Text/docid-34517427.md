who lives in Miami, Fla. Several members of a small
: organization, Cuban Civic Front, engaged in commando tactics |
| in yard of its President, CARLOS MARISTANY, in 11/54 in Miami,
5 but MARISTANY claimed they did not plan to participate in any
revolution against BATISTA, and denied any connection with
PRIO. Reliable informants reported that during period
immediately preceding and following 11/1/54, MARIO MARTINEZ,
licensed. "ham" radio operator in Miami, operated clandestine
radio transmitting and receiving station in close conjunction
with EMILO OCHOA, an Orthodox Party leader, and made contact
with persons in Cuba and Mexico. informants state that OCHOA,
who had been in frequent contact with PRIO, departed Miami and¢.,
entered Cuba clandestinely from Jamaica shortly prior to ire
r 11/1/54, and later claimed that PRIO left him "holding the

: Miami, $25,000 to purchase two vessels, "Le Francais" and
"Mollie-O", on condition that these boats would be made

DETAILS: ‘AT MIAMI, FLORIDA

I. REPORTS OF ALLEGED: REVOLUTIONARY ACTION
PLANNED AGAINST BATISTA GOVERNMENT OF CUBA

A. UPRISING ALLEGEDLY SCHEDULED
ON_OR ABOUT NOVEMBER 1, 1954.

On October 5, 1954 Miami Informant T-1,.a.Federal
Agency which conducts investigations, reported that PASCASIO
LINERA, Cuban textile leader living in Miami, had disclosed
that the time of the revolution in Cuba was near and that it
would take place before November 1, 1954; that JOSE DUARTE
and CANDIDO DE LA TORRE had entered Cuba clandestinely and
possessed information concerning the location of arms hidden
in the Havana area. This informant stated that CARLOS PRIO
planned to be in Havana several days before the revolutionary
effort occurred. (S

According to the same informant, the revolutionaries
had issued orders that their followers were not to commit any
acts which would arouse the authorities, and that plans were
centered on a frontal plan to end the present regime in Cuba
and not merely on minor acts to disrupt the elections
(scheduled for November 1, 1954) {6)

PASCASIO LINERA LOPEZ, age 33, 836 S.. W. Third
Avenue, Miami, pleaded guilty to charges based upon investi-
gation by United States Customs, Miami, for conspiring to
transport arms and ammunition from the United States without
a license. :

JOSE DUARTE and CANDIDO DE LA TORRE were the victims
in a $240,000 robbery at-Fort Worth, Texas in about December,
1952. This money had allegedly been taken from New York City
to Fort Worth for the purpose of buying arms and ammunition on
behalf of CARLOS PRIO.

Miami Informant T-2, of known reliability, being
the representative of a Federal Agency which conducts
investigations, advised on October 18, 1954 that he had
received information from several sources that the CARLOS
PRIO group was . attempting to charter, or otherwise acquire,

eke

NW 64954 Docld:34517427 Page 5


MM 2-165

a yacht for the purpose of transporting arms and men to Cuba
in the immediate future in an attempt to overthrow the
BATISTA Government.”

Miami Informant T-3, of known reliability, who is
well informed concerning the activities of Cuban exiles in
the Miami area, and Miami Informant T-4, of known reliability,
who also possesses the same type of information, reported on
October 21, 1954 that a boat called the "SACHEM II" and
several other vessels in the Miami area would allegedly
participate in an attempted revolution against BATISTA, and
that approximately 150 Cubans from the Miami area would
participate. These informants said that the wives of
Cubans belonging to the PRIO group in Miami had been weeping
in anticipation of the approaching revolution against
BATISTA, which T-3 and T-4 said would take place on or about
November 1, 1954, the date of Cuban elections. They expressed
the opinion that DIEGO VICENTE TEJERA, a very close
associate of PRIO, would lead this expedition.

TEJERA pleaded nolle contendere in Federal Court,
New York City, in October, 1954 on a charge, based upon
United States Customs investigation of conspiring to
illegally ship arms to Cuba without a license.

T-3 and T-4 said that Doctor RICARDO LINARES, a
personal friend of Cuban Presidential candidate GRAU SAN
MARTIN, had been in Miami for several days for conferences
with PRIO in an attempt to persuade PRIO to postpone any
revolutionary attempt until after November 1, 1954, as GRAU
felt there was a possibility he might defeat BATISTA in the
Cuban elections, thereby avoiding the necessity of a
revolution. (It is to be noted that GRAU SAN MARTIN withdrew
from the elections several days prior to November 1, 1954).

T=3 and T-4 said LINARES had expressed satisfaction
with his mission to Miami and he felt he had successfully
persuaded PRIO to postpone action.

T=3 and T-4 said that NOEL DEL PINO, another of
PRIO's close associates, had recently succeeded in entering
Cuba clandestingly, but had sought sanctuary at the

_ Uruguayan Embassy in Havana because of the "heat" which had

ba 1143

NW 64954 Docld:34517427 Page 6

MM 2-165

been placed on him by the Cuban authorities, it having been
reported that DEL PINO came to Cuba.in order to attempt to
assassinate BATISTA, They said that DEL PINO had shipped
eight panel trucks into Cuba and had purchased two high-
powered rifles with telescopic sights in the United States
which were believed to be used for the purpose of attempting
BATISTA's assassination.

T.3 and T-4 expressed the opinion that it was
fantastic to believe that any revolutionary invasion or
attempt launched by Cubans in the United States and Mexico
could succeed, unless high Army Officers and Police in Cuba
had sold out to PRIO. They also felt that it was entirely
possible that an attempted assassination might be made against

STA.

Miami Informant T-5, of known reliability, reported
on October 21, 1954 that MARIO MARTINEZ, a partner in
Continental Communications of Florida, had been clandestinely
operating a short wave radio transmitter and receiver on
behalf of EMILO OCHOA, leader of one faction of the Orthodox
Party of Cuba. It is to be noted that OCHOA and PRIO, accord-
ing to numerous reports, have been closely associated with
each other and representatives of the Authentic and Orthodox
Parties, respectively, in order to unseat the BATISTA

’ Government. (This clandestine radio operation will be dealt
with in greater detail elsewhere in this report.)

T-5, said that MARTINEZ was in short wave radio
contact with PRIO and OCHOA followers in Cuba and Mexico.
He said that MARTINEZ had indicated that a revolutionary
attempt against BATISTA would take place shortly before Cuban
elections, scheduled for November 1, 1954, and that the
revolution would be preceded by a student uprising, followed
by armed landings from boats, including one boat which was
then at Campeche, Mexico. This boat was allegedly destined
bars Bata Bono, a port in the extreme southwestern side of
uba.

T-5 said that MARTINEZ also disclosed that 80 men
would board an unidentified vessel in Miami, being picked
up from small boats as this vessel proceeded down the Miami
River and out of Biscayne Bay. MARTINEZ disclosed to T-5

-6- | Solaciaethe

weroewion.

NW 64954 Docld:34517427 Page 7


MM 2-165

that he had been invited by OCHOA to personally accompany
OCHOA on this revolutionary maneuver. He claimed that if the
revolution succeeded he, MARTINEZ, expected to be named Chief
of Communications in Cuba and that he would also get a "cut"
on electrical imports into Cuba.

MARIO MARTINEZ is an American born citizen residing
in Miami. T-5 also said MARTINEZ was in very frequent con-
tact with OCHOA and visited in the homes of both OCHOA and
PRIO.

. Miami Informant T-1 reported in October, 1954 that
CARLOS PRIO had made a statement in confidence to one of his
close supporters to the effect that plans for a revolution
which had originally been scheduled for October 9, 1954,
were disrupted by the breakdown of support allegedly expected
from certain key Army groups, and that prepardtions were
then going ahead for plans for a reorganization so that PRIO
expected to be in Cuba before November 1, 1954.¢5)

Miami Informant T-5 reported on October 29, 1954
that MARIO MARTINEZ had learned through either a Cuban radio
operator or members of the PRIO group in Miami that a general
uprising in Cuba was scheduled for the night of October 29,
1954 or the following day, in Camaguey, Cuba. .At about the
same time, however, MARTINEZ advised Miami Informant T-6, of
known reliability, that a revolution was scheduled for
election day, November 1, 1954, in Cuba, although about ten
bombs had been set off in the eastern part of Cuba on
October 29, 1954.

On October 28, 1954 Miami Informant T-7, of known
reliability, ascertained through SEGUNDO CURTI, one of
PRIO's closest associates, that a revolution would not take
place until after the November 1, 1954 elections. CURTI
told this informant that a seizure of guns which had taken
place by the Cuban Police in Havana several days previously
would not alter PRIO’s plans. CURTI did not indicate to
this informant any specific date for a revolution.

The October 29, 1954 issue of the Miami Herald
carried an article entitled "100 Arrested as Cuba Bags
'Subversives'", This article disclosed that 100 persons

were jailed in Cuba after raids by Police which were aimed at
ftsubversive commandos” intent on disrupting the November 1,
1954 elections. Those arrested were said to be adherents of
CARLOS PRIO. Along with this article was a photograph show-
ing a cache of arms seized in a private home in the country
club section of Havana by Police. These arms were said to
have a value of more than $300,000 and included 82 machine
guns.

T-3 reported on December 13, 1954 that EMILO OCHOA,
who entered Cuba clandestinely several days prior to the
November 1, 1954 elections there, was expected to issue, within
the next few days a declaration to Cuban newspapers that he
is coming over to the side of the Cuban Government. T-3
said that OCHOA was also expected to issue an expose of CARLOS
PRIO which would include a statement to the effect that
OCHOA went to Cuba under an agreement with PRIO to participate
in a revolutionary move against BATISTA which had been
scheduled for November 1, 1954, but_that PRIO had backed out,
fearing to return to Cuba, thereby leaving OCHOA in Cuba
tholding the bag".

a

(1) CLANDESTINE RADIO OPERATION

As previously indicated, Miami Informant T=5, of
known reliability, advised on October 21, 1954 that MARIO
MARTINEZ, a partner in Continental Communications of Florida,
a concern which specializes in repairing and installing two-
way radios, had been operating a clandestine transmitter
and receiver for: EMILO OCHOA, a leader of one faction of the
Orthodox Party of Cuba. T-5 said that MARTINEZ was in almost
daily contact with OCHOA and also with CARLOS PRIO, or some
of PRIO's associates in Miami.

It is to be noted that CARLOS PRIO is a leader of
the Authentic Party and EMILO OCHOA, representing his faction
of the Orthodox Party, attended a joint conference of the
two Parties at Montreal, Canada in June, 1953, at which time
it was agreed, according to reports, that the two Parties
would join forces in order to overthrow BATISTA.

T-5 said that MARTINEZ is a licensed "ham" radio
operator whose call letters are WAJAV. This informant said

anaes |

i

MM 2-165

that MARTINEZ had been operating clandestinely for several
weeks and had been in radio communication with PRIO and
OCHOA followers in Cuba and Campeche, Mexico. T-5 said that
MARTINEZ usually received messages in telegraphic code and:
usually answered in plain text in Spanish. Informant
ascertained that incoming coded messages are usually decoded
by OCHOA, who maintained in his possession a code book.

This informant also reported on the same date
that OCHOA was considering installing two-way radio units on
several automobiles which he planned to ship to Cuba. One
such unit had already been installed in OCHOA’s car, whi ch
he then kept in Miami.

On October 28, 1954 Miami Informant T-2 advised
that. MARTINEZ had employed a code in communicating with one

*. PEDRO UGALDE of Campeche, Mexico.

T-5 reported during the latter part of October,

1954 that MARTINEZ? contacts with OCHOA remained frequent

ind daily until October 27, 1954, or shortly prior thereto,
when OCHOA, accompanied by. EUGENIO GARCIA of Miami, went by
plane to Jamaica. GARCIA returned directly to Miami from
Jamaica. However, according to .T-3' who reported in the
early part of November, 1954, OCHOA made a clandestine entry
into Cuba at Oriente Province in Cubas. set ieeracieciees

T-5 reported that after MARTINEZ “was apparently
unsuccessful in contacting OCHOA, that MARTINEZ’ attempts
to maintain contact with individuals in Mexico and Cuba
reportedly decreased in frequency and that MARTINEZ
apparently abandoned such efforts in Deceinber , 1954.

Miami Informant T-9, of known reliability, being
a representative of a Federal Agency which conducts

“anvestigations, T-2 and T-8 ascertained independently of

each other in November and December, 1954 that MARTINEZ
was extremely cautious in the operation of this radio
station and took many precautions in. avoiding detection
and.in concealing the identity of persons contacted. Some
of his messages were in code and others were inj plain text
in Spanish.

MM 2-165

On November 19, 1954 Miami Informant T-5 ascertain-
ed that according to MARTINEZ, a radio contact on the Isle
of Pines off the coast of Cuba had been arrested by the Cuban
Government. T-5 reported that one of MARTINEZ' contacts in
Cuba had been RENE BENTANCOURT, who uses call letters CO2CY,
however T-5 also learned that MARTINEZ suspected BENTANCOURT of
being a "plant® of the Cuban‘intelligence Service, did not
trust him, and consequently was very circumspect in his
messages with BENTANCOURT, T-5 said BENTANCOURT is a "ham"
radio operator in Cuba and had spent some time in November,
1954 in Miami in the company of MARTINEZ and associates of
PRIO and OCHOA. T-5 possessed no knowledge of the opera=
tion of this clandestine radio station in January, 1955.

(2) BOATS ALLEGEDLY INVOLVED IN
REVOLUTIONARY SCHEMES z

(a) LE FRANCAIS

Information concerning the "LE FRANCAIS" has been
previously reported to the effect, briefly, that CARLOS PRIO
had entered into negotiations to have a 500 watt radio trans-
mitter installed on this boat, apparently for the purpose of
transmitting to commercial receivers in Cuba, but that PRIO
cancelled this plan in favor of having a marine radio trans-
mitter and receiver installed instead.

T-5 had reported on December 3, 1954 that this boat
was owned as a matter of record by the Inter-Caribbean
Corporation of Miami and T-3 had reported on December 6, 1954
that this boat belonged to JOSE MANUEL CARAMES, former Chief
of Police in Havana who, according to T-3, was closely
associated with CARLOS PRIO and his group.

Miami Informant T-10, of known reliability, being
a Federal Agency which conducts investigations, reported on
November 27, 1954 that a Canadian ship "LE FRANCAIS" had
been acquired by certain radical Cuban elements in Miami for
the purpose of using her in subversive activities against
the present Cuban Government.

Miami Informant T-11, of known reliability,
reported on January 6, 1955 that he had determined through

Balog

1480 fy

eee ee

NW 64954 Docld:34517427 Page 11



MM 2-165

various Cuban sources in Miami that JOSE MANUEL. CARAMES,
owner of the "LE FRANCAIS", had been furnished the sum of
$25,000 by CARLOS PRIO on condition’ that this vessel and
another one owned by CARAMES, the "MOLLIE-0", be available
to the PRIO organization should PRIO ever need it. T-=11
said that inquiries relative to the present operations of
this boat reflects that it is not hauling enough cargo at
the present time to make expenses and that if it were not
for PRIO's help, CARAMES would suffer a large financial
loss in the operation of the vessel.

On January 24, 1955 Miami Informant T-12, of known
reliability, being a represéntative of a Federal Agency which
conducts investigations, advised that the registry. of the
"LE FRANCAIS" had been changed from Canadian to Costa Rican
and that the present owners of this vessel are listed as
JOSE C. CARAMES, JR. and PILAR LINERA LOPEZ, as of December
17, 1954, according to the Provisional Registar, as issued
by the Costa Rican Consul General in Miami. The Master of
this vessel is listed as WILLIE EBANKS, citizen of Honduras,
and a resident alien of the United States living at 44 N. E.
Seventh Street, Miami, Florida. c

T-12 said that another member of the crew was
WILLIAM MORALLES. This vessel cleared Miami January 20,
11955, according to T-12, and sailed January 21, 1955 without
any cargo or contraband. T-12 said this vessel was supposed
to go to Costa Rica for coffee and cedar.

T-12 said it had been noted by a representative of
his agency that CARAMES possesses a card.issued by the Costa
Rican Government authorizing him to operate a radio station.
However, T-12 had determined that the only radio equipment
now on board this vessel is a marine radio receiver.

T-12 pointed out that PILAR LINERA LOPEZ, listed
as one of the owners, is identical to PASCASIO LINERA, which
fact he said was borne out also by the fact that a crew list
filed with the Costa Rican Consul General contained the name
PASCASIO LINERA LOPEZ. T-12 also felt it could be
significant that LINERA and MORALLES are associated with
this vessel, inasmuch as both of these men pleaded guilty
on a charge of conspiring to illegally export arms and

ammunition without a license from the United States during
1954, following investigation by United States Customs,
Miami. T-12 said that MORALLES-had-claimed that he would

be in Cuba when’ the ‘shooting started. T-12 described
MORALLES as being a Cuban National who had acquired American
citizenship by virtue of service as a GI with the United

1 States Armed Forces.

T-12 described the "LE FRANCAIS" as being a 138.1
foot vessel with a 12 foot draft anda tonnage of 225.88.
It is motor driven.

(b) SACHEM IT

On October 21, 1954 Miami Informant T=-3 advised
that the "SACHEM II" was to be known as the "EL ZORRO" and
several other boats in the Miami area would allegedly
participate in an attempted revolution against BATISTA.

Miami Informant T-13, of known reliability, report-
ed on October 19, 1954 that TOM McCRORY, Miami yacht broker,
had made inquiries concerning the "SACHEM II", an -82 foot
yacht which had been purchased August, 1954 from a New York
owner by the name of RAUL ALVA SANCHEZ of Mexico. This
informant said at the time this boat was purchased, ALVA

, SANCHEZ had been accompanied to Miami by CRISTOBAL MARTINEZ
ZORILLA, a Mexican who has been previously carried in this
investigation as a contact or associate of the PRIO group.
T-13 said that TOM McCRORY indicated that he might captain
this boat when it left Miami at some time in the near future.

With regard to TOM McCRORY, it is to be recalled
that he allegedly particiapted in a transfer of arms and

ammunition to Cay Sal, a British West Indies Island off the

coast of Cuba, in 1953. These arms were later seized by

| the Cuban Government. T-13 was unable to determine at any

| subsequent time that McCRORY had any further connection

| with the "SACHEM II".

{ T-13 said this boat was ostensively to be used

for luxury fishing in Mexico and had undergone extensive

_repairs in Miami and was then ready for departure at most

any time. T-13 said that negotiations were then being made

to transfer the registry of this vessel from the American

to the Panamanian flag. .

NW 64954 Docld:34517427 Page 13


MM 2-165

On December 14, 1954 Miami Informant T-12, advised
that the "SACHEM II" had obtained permission from the U. S.
Maritime Commission to transfer-its registration from American
to Mexican registry. He said the boat cleared Miami December
14, 1954 for Nassau and that CRISTOBAL MARTINEZ ZORILLA went as
Master. Crew members included LORENZO HARO, a Cuban, and
JAMES W. GREEN, an American. A passenger was listed as ERENA
PERRERA, On December 30, 1954 T-12 advised that the "SACHEM
II" had been searched with negative results. T-12 described
CRISTOBAL MARTINEZ ZORILLA as being an admitted smuggler of
gold and as a suspected narcotics smuggler. ZORILLA disclosed
to T+-12 that he intended to smuggle scotch whisky from the
Bahamas to Mexico.

(c) MOLLIE-O

On October 21, 1954 T=3 stated that the "MOLLIE-O",
owned by. JOSE MANUEL CARAMES, mentioned above, was then in
the Port of Miami and suspected of being involved in
revolutionary activities of the PRIO group.

(3) COMBAT TRAINING OF- CUBAN

CIVIC FRONT, MIAMI

On October 15, 1954 Miami Informant T-14, of known
reliability, advised that a group of Cubans had been
practicing combat tactics in the yard of CARLOS MARISTANY,
1890 N. W.. 81st Terrace, for several days preceding and that
these Cubans had been using what appeared to be weapons made
of wood. T-=14 said that some of these Cubans had been over-
heard to make statements in Spanish about Cuba and "fire".

On the evening of November 27, 1954 SA EDWARD P.
GAZUR and GEORGE E. DAVIS, JR. observed that there were a
number of Spanish speaking men in MARISTANY's residence, and
they appeared to be in a heated political discussion. SA
GAZUR, who understands Spanish, could hear them mention
CARLOS PRIO, BATISTA, GRAU SAN MARTIN and the Federal Bureau
of Investigation. At one point in the meeting, which lasted
until about 10:00 P.M., the Agents heard what appeared to be
the racking back of a bolt on a Springfield rifle.

On November 2, 1954 CARLOS ISIDORO MARISTANY,
1890 N. W. 81st Terrace, was interviewed by SAs GAZUR and
DAVIS.

MARISTANY advised that he is presently of the
Frente Civico Cubano, "Cuban Civic Front". Other members,
in addition to himself, included GILBERT DELGADO in charge
of publicity and propaganda; HUMBERTO ALVARADO, Secretary;
ANGEL ESCARTIN and MIGUEL MARINO, He said that on occasions
ALFREDO SANCHEZ ECHEVARIA had also been present. (This
individual is reported to be the son of AURELIANO SANCHEZ
ARANGO, who is the alleged head of the anti-BATISTA under-
ground in Cuba and who was formerly Minister of Education in
PRIO's cabinet. )

MARISTANY said that the purpose of this club was
to enlighten Americans as to the political situation in Cuba
in order to restore democracy in Cuba. He claimed that the
group was not affiliated with any political party in Cuba,
nor organized Cuban group either in Cuba or the United States.
He denied that it was associated in any way with CARLOS PRIO
and said that it did not receive any funds from PRIO or any

other individual or political party.

MARISTANY acknowledged that meetings of this group
had been held at his: own home and at the homes of other
members. He admitted that. on the evening of October 27,
1954 either ALVARADO or ESCARTIN had brought to his home a
230 caliber model.1903 Springfield bolt action rifle which
had been used by DELGADO for deménstration purposes that
evening.

MARISTANY also acknowledged that on at least three
occasions during the recent past combat tactics had been
held in his yard by members of the club. He said that on
none of these occasions, however, did they use real weapons.
They did use two wooden guns, a broom and a mop.

He denied that either he himself or any other
member of the group, so far as he knew, planned to go to
Cuba at any time in the near future or to engage in any
revolutionary activities against BATISTA or anybody else.
When questioned as to the purpose of such combat tactics,
MARISTANY said he could not adequately explain why they
had engaged in such tactics. He indicated that these
maneuvers served as a sort of outlet for their feelings
against BATISTA. He denied that he had made any attempts

to recruit anybody to engage in any revolutionary activity
against the present Cuban Government or that he himself had
enlisted or attempted to enlist- anyone for such purpose.

: MARISTANY acknowledged that he had participated in
an attempt to picket the Cuban Consulate in Miami in July,
1952, along with GILBERT DELGADO and other individuals. He
said that the Cuban Civic Club has no connection whatsoever
with the Accion Civica Cubano of New York City, although each
exists for the same general purpose.

MARISTANY said that he is employed by the McKesson
Robbins Pharmaceutical Company in Miami as a Price Clerk and
has worked for this company six years. He said he formerly
taught at a Baptist school at El Cristo, Cuba from 1945 to
1947 and that he is presently a Sunday School teacher in Miami.
“ His uncle, CARLOS MARISTANY, was an official in PRIO's government.

(4%) REACTION OF CARLOS PRIO TO
BATISTA'S ELECTION AS PRESIDENT

NOVEMBER 1, 1954

The Miami Herald on November 3, 1954 carried an
article entitled "Election Outcome Tragic Joke on Cuban
People, PRIO Asserts", by GEORGE SOUTHWORTH, Herald Staff
Writer, who reported CARLOS PRIO as having declared that the
election of BATISTA "represents a tragic joke played on the
Cuban people".

In this article PRIO was quoted as having made the
following remarks: ;

"What happened in Cuba on November 1 can not
be called a general election.

"The state of persecution and violence created
by the armed forces moved Doctor RAMON GRAU SAN
MARTIN, BATISTA's only opponent, to withdraw from
the election on October 31.

"GRAU had asked for a postponement but BATISTA
rejected that demand, thus remaining the sole
candidate for presidency in the election.

"Such a situation has no precedents in
Cuba's history and such a deed cannot validate
the de facto regime established by revolution.
Nor can it solve the constitutional crisis under
which Cuba has lived since March 10, 1952."

The article stated that PRIO denied rumors that he
had joined forces with GRAU. It quoted him as stating "It
just happened that BATISTA forced GRAU to take the position
that agreed with my own stand concerning the election.

NBATISTA's objectives in going through with
the election were quite obvious.

"He wanted to make his dictatorship
legitimate through an apparent popular electoral
validation which would have allowed him to con-
sider himself a constitutional president.

"Thus he needed some kind of a general
election but when he was practically sure of his
defeat at the hands of GRAU, he created a state
of terror and violence and forced GRAU to withe
draw."

The article also quoted PRIO as stating that the
"so-called" election returns published by BATISTA "represent
a tragic joke played on the people which embitters still
more the already dangerous situation on the island."

This article pointed out that PRIO had been fined
$9000 in October, 1954 by a Federal Judge in New York on a
charge of conspiring to ship arms illegally to Cuba; that
PRIO had entered a plea of no defense to that charge.

B; REPORT SUBSEQUENT TO NOVEMBER 1, 1954
INDICATIVE OF REVOLUTIONARY ACTION
BEING PLANNED AGAINST BATISTA GOVERNMENT

Miami Informant T-5 reported on November 4, 1954
that MARIO MARTINEZ, previously mentioned as having operated
a clandestine radio on behalf of the PRIO and OCHOA group,
had confided that terroristic tactics would be employed

against BATISTA until such time as Cuban economy and
security conditions made possible a successful revolutionary
action against BATISTA. At the samé time MARTINEZ disclosed
that a split had occurred between PRIO and OCHOA because
PRIO had failed to finance the purchase of certain automobile
radio equipment needed by OCHOA.

Miami Informant T-7 reported in the early part of
November, 1954 that ENRIQUE HENRIQUEZ, brother-in-law of
CARLOS PRIO who had been visiting in Miami, had disclosed
that PRIO expected to be back in Cuba by Christmas, 1954.

T-3 expressed the opinion on November 4, 1954 that
PRIO had lost his opportunity in not striking beforé the
November 1, 1954 election, which election showed strong
BATISTA support in Cuba. T-3 felt that PRIO would probably
ee terroristic tactics in Cuba in opposition to

Miami Informant T=-15, of unknown reliability, but
who has purportedly furnished some reliable information
previously, on December 6, 1954 advised that he had by
chance met. CARLOS and ANTONIO PRIO a day or two previously in
Miami and that during the course of the casual conversation,
both had stated they hoped to see him in Havana soon, T-15
gathered from this remark that the PRIOs were still interested
in fomenting a revolution in Cuba. This informant pointed out
that since BATISTA is scheduled to take office February 24,
1955, that any attempt of PRIO to overthrow BATISTA would
logically be made prior to that date.

T-3 reported on January 4, 1955 that a conference
had been held at the home of CARLOS PRIO on New Year's
Eve, or Day, at which time PRIO reiterated to some of his
leading associates his intention to overthrow the BATISTA
regime. T-3 possessed no details as to those in attendance
at this meeting. T-3 was of the opinion that such an effort
would succeed only through assassination of BATISTA and he
felt this would prabably be the means by which PRIO would
attempt to overthrow the BATISTA Government, inasmuch as any
other method would prove futile, since BATISTA had been
elected by an overwhelming. majority of the Cuban people.

T-11 reported on January 6, 1955 that a small unit
of the Triple A, the underground anti-BATISTA organization
allegedly headed by AURELIANO SANCHEZ ARANGO, is presently
active in Miami, according to information received by him
through several sources. T-11 said that members of this
unit include DIEGO VICENTE TEJERA, one of PRIO's chief

. Lieutenants and close associates, TONY SANTIAGO and his
brother ROBERTO SANTIAGO of Miami, and’ NOEL' DEL PINO, also
presently in Miami. T-ll said that meetings of this group
are frequently held at the home of SANTIAGO. T-1l1 said
that from what he can gather, the Triple A unit, described
above, consists of an inner-group of secret members of the
PRIO faction who are committed to engage in acts of violence
when necessary. He said that members of this group have
considered the possibility of assassinating BATISTA and that
claims have been made that’ there is one among the group who
is willing to make such an attempt. T-11 said however, he
had been unable to obtain the identity.of this individual
or to obtain any substantiating evidence.

It is to be noted that all of the members of this
unit described by T-1l are well known associates of the
PRIO group in Miami.

Both T-3. and T-11 were of the opinion that any
attempted assassination of BATISTA of other act of violence
to seize his government would logiéally take place before
February 24, 1955 when BATISTA ig scheduled to take office
as the new President of Cuba. va

On December 13, 1954 and on January 10, 1955 T-3
made available the November 1, 1954, November 15, 1954 and
the December 1, 1954 issues of “Panfleto", a small leaflet
edited by SAVIUR CANCIO PENA, whichis the pen name for
SAIVADOR PENA, who has been previously investigated under
the Foreign. Agents Registration Act, alorig.with MILLO
OCHOA for preparing and publishing a considerable amount of
literature aimed against the BATISTA Government. PENA is
a naturalized American citizen of Cuban origin now reported-
ly living in Mexico.

This pamphlet contains information to the effect
that it is printed clandestinely in Cuba, this despite the
fact that PENA is reportedly living in Mexico.

The December 1, 1954 edition of this pamphlet
contains an article in Spanish reading when translated to
the effect that CARLOS PRIO will restore democracy,
constitutional. government, and freedom to Cuba, and execute
the traitors and will hold constitutional elections and then
retire from Cuban politics. It also includes an article
concerning OCHOA which describes OCHOA as the indestructible
leader of the Orthodox Party and the hope of Cuban people who
is now secretly in Cuba.

The November 1, 1954 issue of this same pamphlet
carried an article reading as translated, "The revolution is
on its way. It cannot be checked. It is coming without a
doubt. CARLOS PRIO, MILLO OCHOA do not deflate the longings
of the free men of Cuba. There are weapons and unsuspected
methods of fighting. Have faith."

Another article read "Remember Moncada. Neither
forget, nor pardon. PRIO, MILLO, BARCENAS, AURELIANO and

a people. To arms."

Another article read "MILLO OCHOA kept his word.
He is in Cuba to fight against the dictatorship. The people
and their party are following him. He is a leader.”

Another read "Revolutions are not made by the
masses but by active minorities. The former follow the
leader if he wins out."

PENA has admittedly worked on behalf of the PRIO
group prior to leaving Miami, Florida for Mexico. He has
also been closely associated with OCHOA.

Miami Informant T-1 reported on or shortly prior
to January 11, 1955 that according to information
emanating from official Cuban circles, young Cubans had
begun to leave Cuba for Key West, Florida in order to join
a revolutionary evasion force which was supposed to leave
from that point for Cuba in the near future. These men
were reportedly to travel at their own expense and report
to 176 Doval or Duval Street, Key West, and ask for PEDRO
ARMENTOS, using the passwords "Cuba needs Cubans".

On January 11, 1955 T=3 advised that he had
received no confirmation of such activity through his
sources and T-2 reported that he had also received no
substantiation of this information.

On January 12, 1955 Chief of Police VIENVEDITO
PEREZ, Key West, advised that he had noted no influx of
Cuban Nationals to Key West, other than as tourists.

SA JOHN C. BILLS ascertained that 176 Duval Street,
Key West, is a non-existent address, being a vacant lot.
Agent BILLS also ascertained that PEDRO ARMENTOS was unknown
to individuals in that neighborhood.

T-1 also reported in December, 1954 that members of
the Orthodox Party, members of the Communist Party (PSP) and
members of the Association De Amigos De Aureliano were draw-
ing up plans for revolutionary action. This informant also
stated that unidentified wealthy merchants, ostensibly non-
political but actually conniving with members of the former
PRIO Government, were also involved and that armed action
was planned for the Christmas (1954) holiday period. This
informant said that an armed uprising was td begin in Pinar
Del Rio Province and that members of the old Cuban armed
forces would be involved in the revolt. This informant said
that arms and uniforms were being transported daily to
different destinations in the trunks of private automobiles
and that arms were being landed at Arroyo De Mantua and at
Guanibar Beach by fishing boats and other small craft.

This. informant said that Doctor ARNALDO ESCALONA .
ALMEIDA, a Communist lawyer, represented the PSP in plans
for the coup and that he had been negotiating with Doctor
RAMON GRAU SAN MARTIN, former Cuban President, EMILIO OCHOA
OCHOA, and AURELIANO SANCHEZ ARANGO. This informant also
reported that a second PSP representative involved in these
plans was Doctor RAUL ROA, who was reportedly on close
terms with the Mexican Communist Party and the Soviet
Legation in Mexico.

C. INFORMATION CONCERNING ALLEGED TRAFFIC
IN_ARMS AND AMMUNITION

T-16, who is believed to be reliable, reported on
October 29, 1954 that he had received information reflecting

that JINO NEGRETTI, a Miami Attorney of Puerto Rican origin,
had indicated that he possessed information concerning 1000
rifles which were to be shipped to Cuba via Key West,
Florida and that NEGRETTI planned a trip to Cuba relative to
this transaction.

T-3 reported on January 18, 1955 that NEGRETTI had
recently approached representatives of the Cuban Government
in Miami with a proposition of furnishing information concern-
ing a large supply of arms and ammunition which was to be
smuggled to Cuba in return for which NEGRETTI wanted $5000.
T-3 said that when the Cuban authorities questioned NEGRETTI
at length concerning his proposal, it was determined that
NEGRETTI had no specific information to offer.

T-15 reported on December 6, 1954 that he had
ascertained from various members of the PRIO organization
in Miami that a shipment of' arms was to be handled by ANTONIO
FUENTES; brother-in-law of CARLOS PRIO, and that this shipment
was expected to leave from Tampa, Florida by way of fishing
boats by way of Cuba during the following week. T-15
possessed no specific information concerning the identity of
the boats involved. :

Miami Informants T=2 and T-3 have reported during
the recent past on several occasions that there still appears
to be considerable traffic of a piecemeal nature in arms in
the Miami area. T-3 has expressed the opinion that some of
the activity in this field has been transferred from the
Miami area to the West Coast of Florida, particularly in the
area of Tampa, however he possessed no specific information.

Mr. JAMES OFFUTT, Assistant Supervising Customs
Agent, United States Customs, Miami, Florida, reported on
January 25, 1955 that investigations. by United States Customs
relative to the Federal laws involving exportation of arms
and ammunition without a license, or conspiracy..to do so,
as prescribed by Section 452D of Title 22 and Se¢tion 371,

D. MISCELLANEQUS

f On September 3, 1954 Miami Informant T-17, who is
an admitted former Communist and who has reported some
reliable information in the past, advised that during the
previous week he and another individual were called to the

Hl home of CARLOS PRIO, where they were received by Doctor

| MARTINEZ FRAGA and LUIS GUSTAVO FERNANDEZ, PRIO's private
secretary. He said PRIO was also supposed to be present, but
at the last minute was unable to attend.

T-17 said that FRAGA and FERNANDEZ wanted him to

i produce and turn over to Miami newspapers information showing
\ BATISTA to be a Communist and to produce information concern-
ing any tie-in between Cuban Communists and Communists in the
United States. T-17 said that he made no commitments,

On September 3, 1954 Miami Informant 1-18, ‘of known
reliability, confirmed information furnished by T-17. T-18
said that FRAGA and FERNANDEZ explained that they would be
able to get evidence concerning Communism in Cuba and the
i Communist connections between Cuba and the United States from
i DIAZ VERSON, a Cuban now residing in Miami who had investiga-
ted Communist ‘activities in Cuba over a long period of time.

On September 16, 1954 SALVADOR DIAZ VERSON, 2969
S. W. 15th Street, Miami, advised SA JOHN PAGE, JR., who
speaks Spanish, and SA GEORGE E. DAVIS, JR. that BATISTA
himself is not a Communist, but that BATISTA tolerates
i Cuban Communists in order to secure their votes and support.
He claimed there are some 80,000 to 90,000 Communists in
Cuba, among whom there are about 13,000 militant Communists.
He alleged there is traffic between Cuban Communists and
Communists in the United States, but he was then unable to
produce any evidence to substantiate this allegation. DIAZ
stated he himself had formerly been connected with the
Counter Intelligence Espionage Unit of the Cuban Army and
that he later headed the Anti-Communist League of Cuba.

II. RESISTANCE COMMANDOS

H On December 10, 1954 Miami Informant T-1 advised
that an organization known as the "Comandos de Resistencia”
(Resistance Commandos) had recently been formed in Cuba and
was presumed to be an arm of the PRIO revolutionary movement.
T-1 said the aim of this organization was to institute a
reign of violence against the BATISTA regime.

T-1 named LUIS ORTEGA, MARCOS G. VILLAREAL,
ARACELIO AZCUY and MARIO KUCHILAN as being the supreme
command or directive committee of this organization, with
headquarters in Miami, Florida. T-l said that the general
Repneree ee of this organization in Cuba was CANDIDO DE LA
RRE.

According to T-1, this organization in November,
1954 published the first issue of a bulletin called the
Resistance Commandos, which included a declaration to the
effect that the Resistance Commandos were ready to give their
lives in order to obtain freedom, peace and tranquillity for
the Cuban people, and that théy intended to do physical
| violence to BATISTA and his partners in crime in an effort to
rid the country of its enemies and to liberate the people.

On November 12, 1954 Miami Informant T-19, of known
reliability, advised that on November 10, 1954 LUIS ORTEGA,
who resides 3750 Park Avenue, Coconut Grove, Miami, had
caused to be printed 2000 copies of a leaflet entitled
"Bulletin Number One of the Resistance Commandos" and that
on November 11, 1954 ORTEGA had produced 500 similar copies
on an air mail type paper. This bulletin, as translated
from Spanish into English, reads as follows:

"BATISTA MUST BE FOUGHT WITH TERROR

"We are now at war with BATISTA, And we
proclaim, before’ public opinion, that all means
are good. Everything is lawful in this death
struggle. The Comandos de Resistencia are now
fighting in the streets of Cuba...Our men are
prepared to offer up their lives to achieve the
peace and calm of the mistreated Cuban people.

"We are not prompted by infamous political
sectarianisms, We are prepared to collaborate
in every noble attempt at insurrection which will
one day materialize -- but we believe that while
waiting for the arrival of the hour of liberty,
terror must. be answered with terror. The men who
are assuming the responsibility for the crimes of
BATISTA must be duly sanctioned. And not after-
wards, but now. That is the task that the
Comandos de Resistencia are going to carry out.
e.are already working with fervor. From the moment
and hour that we heard the first reports of the guns
that announced our underground action, terror began
to spread among the shameful members of the regime.
Nothing will stop us. We are going to attack the
persons of all the individuals who appear to be
publicly compromised with the murderer, FULGENCIO
BATISTA, and those of all those who surround them,
whether they be politicians, newspapermen, public
officials, businessmen, foreigners or soldiers.
We believe that Cuba is a country occupied by the
enemy. Therefore, every Cuban guilty of
collaborating with the enemy is a traitor to the
fatherland and must be shot. We believe that if
BATISTA brings MARTA to all public functions,
cowardly seeking to shield himself behind an un-
fortunate woman, the responsibility of what happens
to this woman will be BATISTA's and not his
executors’. We will not attack his family provided
it is kept away, but neither will we renounce
meting out justice for considerations of a
sentimental character. This is a warning to those
who are guilty and to the members of their families.
And deeds will demonstrate that it is a warning to
be taken into account.

"We turn to the people of Cuba, in this first
bulletin, soliciting their cooperation. The
Comandos. are at the service of the public and are
the executors of its will. We are not gangsters.
The gangsters are those who steal and murder, from
the government. We are humble, hardworking Cubans.
We detest bloodshed, “but we love liberty too much.

"RESISTANCE COMMANDOS i

"Havana, November, 1954"

It is to be noted that this bulletin purports to :
have been prepared in Havana, Cuba, although actually it was
prepared in Miami, Florida.

With regard to the individuals named by T-1 as
being leaders of the Resistance Commandos, the following
information is submitted.

LUIS ORTEGA y SIERRA

T-3 reported on January 10, 1955 that LUIS ORTEGA
formerly owned stock in the El Pueblo Newspaper, Havana,
Cuba, and recently sold this stock for the sum of $40,000.
He also allegedly brought into the United States from Cuba
approximately $25,000 when he left Cuba as an exile, T-3
said that since ORTEGA came to’ Miami about one and one-half
years ago, he has been more or less persona non grata with
CARLOS PRIO, inasmuch as ORTEGA became a critic of PRIO's
activities while PRIO was still President of Cuba. T-3
said that PRIO is alleged to distrust ORTEGA and considers
him somewhat of a bilackmailer.

T-19 has previously reported in connection with
a Registration Act investigation of SALVADOR PENA and
EMILO OCHOA that LUIS ORTEGA was in very frequent contact
with OCHOA during 1954 in Miami and collaborated with them
in publishing a considerable quantity of anti-BATISTA
propaganda and also in publishing a manual containing
instructions relating to commando and military tactics,
including the use of various types of small arms,

The January 9, 1955 issue of "Bohemia", page
61, contains a page entitled "1955 - In Exile", showing
photographs of various Cubans in Miami. One of these
photographs shows CARLOS PRIO SOCARRAS sitting with
newspaperman LUIS ORTEGA SIERRA and ARACELIO AZCUY, along

with a reporter of the "Bohemia". According to this reporter,
PRIO commented, "Time has not been our ally, neither has it
been the ally of our enemy".

Another photograph showed LUIS ORTEGA and ANTONIO
PRIO, brother of CARLOS, discussing the bitterness of exiles.

Immigration and Naturalization Service records,
Miami, reflect that ORTEGA last entered the United States
March 31, 1954 with a non quota visa. On May 27, 1954 he was
granted a permit to reenter the United States from a trip he
planned to Mexico.

MARIO KUCHILAN

On January 10, 1955 T-3 advised that MARIO KUCHILAN,
who is a Cuban citizen of the Chinese Race, is a former
columnist for "Prensa Libre", T-3 said that KUCHILAN
allegedly practiced blackmail tactics in editing his column.
T=3 said he has received information that KUCHILAN makes
frequent trips to Miami International Airport, where he sends
and receives mail via various airline stewards and pilots.

T-3 said that KUCHILAN is very close to ORTEGA and to other
Cuban exiles in Miami.

Previous investigation relative to instant case
has disclosed that KUCHILAN has been in frequent contact with
PRIO, SEGUNDO CURTI and other leaders of the PRIO group.

Immigration and Naturalization Service records
reflect that MARIO ERNESTO KU CHILAN y SOL last entered Miami
November 24, 1954, destined to 2295 S. W. 9th Street, Miami,
Florida. His visa has been extended to June 25, 1955. He
was described as being a reporter by occupation of the Chinese
Race and born April 26, 1910 in Havana, Cuba.

MARCOS G. VILLAREAL

T-3 reported on January 10, 1955 that MARCOS G.
VILLAREAL had been arrested ten days previously in Cuba on
a conspiracy charge. He said that VILLAREAL had been in
Miami recently but only for a period of. about one month.
T-3 considered VILLAREAL to be "small fry". He described

T3 reported on January 10, 1955 that ARACELIO AZCUY
is. presently receiving $50 per week for expenses from RICARDO
ARTIGAS, former Chief of the Cuban Lottery now living in
Miami as a permanent resident, and who is one of PRIO’s close
advisors. T-3 said that AZCUY has always been associated with
"left wing" organizations and ideas. He said that AZCUY
frequently visits at the home of TONY SANTIAGO at 326 S. W.
20th Road, Miami, and also visits almost every day the office
of ELISEO RIERA GOMEZ, who is registered under the Foreign
Agents Registration Act.

On December 14, 1954 T-12 made available for
examination a book entitled "Cuba: Campo dé Concentracion",
written by AZCUY in the Spanish language. This was one of a
number of books bearing the same title which had been sent
to Miami from Mexico, where it had been published by
"Ediciones Humanismo" on March 10, 1954 and printed by
"Impresiones Modernas,'S. A., Tabasco Number 275, Mexico City.

An examination of this book by SA‘LEMAN L. STAFFORD,
JR., who understands the Spanish language, reflected that it
treats with the bad economic condition of Cuba, this
condition resulting allegedly because of ‘the BATISTA dictator-
ship. It also attacks BATISTA’s Government and‘alleges that
freedom is suppressed; that people are tortured, and claims
other outrages against the Cuban people.,,,The book includes
a long list of Cuban political exiles residing in Mexico,
the United States, and other countries. The book contains
approximately ten cartoons drawn by SAVIUR CANCIO PENA,
previously mentioned in this report.

The book also contains a biographical sketch of
AZCUY. It reflects that he formed a group of students known
as the Authentic Youth Revolutionists; that he was a member

of the Executive Body of "Youth in Defense of the Spanish
Republic"; that he was a member of.the "Committee For
Assistance to the Spanish Children"; that he founded the
youth division of the Authentic Party and was elected to
the first National Board of that group, and that he
attended the Law School at the University of Havana and
while there founded a committee "Pro-Independente of Puerto
Rico", a committee "Pro-Spaniish Republic", a committee
"Pro-Democrary in the Dominican Republic", and a committee
"Aid to China Against the Japanese Republic".

This biography also reflects that while President
of the Federation of University Students (FEU) he went to
Puerto Rico at the invitation of a students' council and
there made an appeal for independence for the "Island of
Albizu Campos", The biography points out that AZCUY's
appeal caused such a commotion within and outside of Puerto
Rico that he was violently exiled from the island.

The biography also reflects that in 1948 he was
appointed by AURELIANO SANCHEZ ARANGO to be Chief of
Personnel of the Department of Education.

On January 18, 1954 Miami Informant T-20, of known
reliability, being a representative of a Federal Agency which
conducts investigations, advised that according to a June,
1948 report which had been brought to the attention of his
office, AZCUY was described as being a suspected "fellow
traveller", though not a Communist.

T-20 also possessed another report dated October,
1948, which described AZCUY as being a close friend of
SANCHEZ ARANGO, who was then Minister of Education in Cuba.

T-20 was in possession of several newspaper
clippings, including one dated December 28, 1954 (newspaper
anieown Ti which quoted AZCUY as denying that he had suggest-
ed to JUAN MARINELLO (Communist Party leader in Cuba) that
he attack the United States. 7

T-20 possessed information reflecting that AZCUY
left Cuba October 15, 1953 for Mexico, after having been
granted. asylum inthe Mexican Embassy in Havana, as result of

having been involved in an uprising at Santiago de Cuba in
July, 1953. : : i:

On November 10, 1954 ARACELIO RAFAEL AZCUY CRUZ
filed an "Application to Extend Time of Temporary Stay". This
application reflected that he had arrived at the Port of Miami
October 22, 1954 for a thirty day visit from Mexico and
intended to visit his friend LUIS ORTEGA, 3750 Park Avenue,
Coconut Grove, Miami.

T-20 advised that on November 17, 1954 a 42 year old
Cuban woman, ANGELICA PETRONILA FERRER y MORALES, came to Key
West, Florida and applied for admission as a temporary
visitor, but was excluded after she admitted that the purpose
of her visit was to have intimate relations with AZCUY, who
had come from Miami to Key West to see her.

T-20 on December 2, 1954 said AZCUY was interrogated
concerning the above-mentioned Cuban woman. He described her
as being a female auxiliary of his political party, the
Authentico in Cuba and he implied that the purpose of her
visit was for a political talk with him in Key West, where he
had gone to meet her, having made arrangements for rooms at a
Key West hotel. AZCUY described himself as being a political
refugee and said he had written a book very strongly opposed
to the BATISTA regime which prevented his return to Cuba. He
denied that he had ever been a member of the Partido
Socialista Popular (Communist Party) in Cuba.

On January 24, 1955 T-18 advised having received
information through AZCUY to the effect that AZCUY had trans- /
ported forty .45 caliber revolvers or automatics from Miami /
to Key West, Florida in two suitcases in November, 1954 for
the purpose of turning these weapons over to ANGELICA
PETRONILA FERRER y MORALES so that she could transport them
back to Cuba on her return trip. T-18 did not know the
ultimate destination in Cuba of these guns, according to
AZCUY's original plans. T-18 said that AZCUY, of course,
had been prevented from carrying out his plan, inasmuch as
the woman had been excluded from entering the United States
by the Immigration and Naturalization Service authorities.
T-18 did not know whether AZCUY still has possession of
these guns, or whether he has since disposed of them.

Also on January 24, 1955 T-18 reported that he had

ascertained through Cuban friends that AZCUY is considered

by them to be a Communist.
CANDIDO DE LA TORRE

On January 10,.1955 T-3 advised that CANDIDO DE LA
TORRE disappeared from Mexico where he had been residing and

is now located somewhere secretly in Cuba.

DE LA TORRE has been previously mentioned many times
in this investigation and it has been pointed out in this

report that DE LA TORRE was one of the victims in a $24.0, 000

robbery at Fort Worth, Texas
buying arms and ammunition

III. TRIPLE A

On January 6, 1955 T-1l advised that according to

the money in question having
allegedly been provided by CARLOS PRIO for the purpose of

information which has come to his attention, a small unit of

the Triple A, the underground anti-BATISTA organization
headed by AURELIANO SANCHEZ ARANGO, PRIO's former Minister of
Education, is presently active in Miami. T-11 named as

members of this unit DIEGO VICENTE TEJERA, TONY SANTIAGO and

his. brother ROBERTO SANTIAGO and NOEL DEL PINO. T-11 said that
meetings of this group are being held at the home of TONY
SANTIAGO, 326 S. W. 20th Road, Miami. T-11 said that from

what he can gather through associates of the PRIO group, the
Miami members of this organization constitute an inner-group

of secret members of PRIO followers who are committed to
engaging in acts of violence when necessary. He said that
members of the group mentioned above have considered the
possibility of assassinating BATISTA and claims have been
made to.the effect that one among the group has been found

who is willing to make such an attempt.

On January 20, 1955 T-11 reported that he

suspected that additional members of. the Triple A include
MARIO KUCHILAN, SEGUNDO CURTI, GULLEREMO PUJOL (who is now

), PASCASIO LINERA, MARCOS DIAZ, and perhaps LUIS
ORTEGA. f-11 said all of these individuals frequently meet
at the home of ANTONIO PRIO and some of them meet at the home
of TONY SANTIAGO, and that these meetings appear to be of a

T-11 possessed no specific information and he
indicated that the above information was based upon general
observations and suspicions.

T-11 also suspects that MARIO KUCHILAN may be a
contact man for the Communist Party. He said that this
suspicion was based upon a conversation which MARIO KUCHILAN
had with LOMBERTO DIAZ, a follower of PRIO, recently when
reference was made to work for the Communist Party. T-11
possessed no additional information to support this suspicion.

IV. MOVIMIENTO NACIONAL REVOLUCIONARIO (MNR)
(NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT)

Miami Informant T-21 on December 9, 1954 directed
attention to an article which appeared in the December 1,
1954 issue of the "Diario de las Americas" of Miami concern-
ing an interview by a newspaper representative with Doctor
RAPHAEL GARCIA BARCENAS, head of the Cuban National
Revolutionary Movement. The translation from Spanish into
English of this article reflects tmt it bore the heading
"Waiting and Vigilance". The article reflected that BARCENAS,
a Professor of the University of Havana, was named as the
President of this organization. When questioned whether in
the event of an insurrectional movement would he go with the
MNR alone or in Conjunction with CARLOS PRIO, he replied to
the effect, "In any insurrectional opportunity that should
open itself to us, we would return with revolutionaries made
up of the different oppositional groupings...as before, and
as in the future, we will maintain ourself faithful to the
line of revolutionary independence sponsored by the MNR
sihce its foundation.”

When questioned as to his present position and
future plans, he replied in part, "Our present position is
one of waiting and vigilance. We will be zealously on the
watch for the moment in which, with our forces, we might
be of use to our suffering country. Our future plans are
becoming oriented in the sense that insurrection and
revolution are not concepts that are considered to be
synonymous, nor do they contradict themselves, rather do
they complement one another.”

When asked to explain the foundations and
doctrines of the revolutionary movement OV Bai ch he

presides, BARCENAS replied in part, "The MNR was constituted
in order to fuse into a single front. the revolutionary
elements which-are present in one part of the orthodoxy, in
one part of the authenticism and in one part of the citizenry
without soldiery".

On January 11, 1955 T-22, of known reliability,
advised that Doctor RAPHAEL GARCIA BARCENAS, his wife and
eight year old daughter rented an apartment at 871 S. W. Third
Street, Miami, on November 13, 1954 and have been residing
there ever since, T-22 said that on December 24, 1954 a
Latin who described himself as being CARLOS ALFARAS made
arrangements for a Cuban family consisting of two women, two
men and two children to occupy another apartment; that shortly
thereafter the woman and children moved out and the two men
were joined by two additional Cubans. He said that Doctor
BARCENAS was in contact with these Cubans, whose names were
never known to T-22, however he felt that their activities
were suspicious inasmuch as they éngaged in excited
discussions which appeared to be of a political nature. He
said that ALFARAS, although making the arangements for the
occupancy of one of the apartments, did not remain there. He
also recalled that ALFARAS was well supplied with money.

T-22 also made available for examination one copy of
a small newspaper entitled "Unidad Revolucionario" dated
January, 1955 which had been made available by the wife of
BARCENAS. This is a Spanish language newspaper and it
purports to be the official organ of "The Club of Exiled Cubans
tJ, MARTI*", It contained an article mentioning the name of
BARCENAS in conjunction with the National Revolutionary
Movement "MNR", It also included a list of martyrs of the
dictatorship of Cuba since March, 1952.

T-22 said that. BARCENAS appears to lead a rather
quiet life, although most of his time is spent away from the
apartment. T=22 said that BARCENAS had claimed, upon being
questioned, that-he*is not a°"PRIO man".

On January 11, 1955 T-3 advised that BARCENAS, a
former Professor at the University of Havana, and also at
the Cuban Military Academy, is considered somewhat of a
“erack pot", He said that CARLOS ALFARAS is a close associate
of AURELIANO SANCHEZ ARANGO and reportedly came from Mexico
to wait for "D Day" in Cuba. | Simei eecaet cece
