PLANNED AGAINST BATISTA GOVERNMENT OF CUBA

A.

UPRISING ALLEGEDLY SCHEDULED

ON OR ABOUT NOVEMBER 1, 7954

On October 5, 1954 Miami Informant T-1, a Federal

Agency which conducts investigations, reported that PASCASIO

LINERA, Cuban textile leader living in Miami, had disclosed

that the time of the revolution in Cuba was near and that it

would take place before November 1, 1954; that JOSE DUARTE

and CANDIDO DE LA TORRE had entered Cuba

clandestinely and

possessed information concerning the location of arms hidden

in the Havana area.

This informant stated that CARLOS PRIO

planned to be in Havana several days before the revolutionary

effort occurred. (5)

According to the

same informant, the revolutionaries

had issued orders that their followers were not to commit any

acts which would arouse the authorities, and that plans were

centered on a frontal plan to end the present regime in Cuba

and not merely on minor acts to disrupt the elections

(scheduled for November 1, 1954) (5)

PASCASIO LINERA LOPEZ, age 33, 836 S. W. Third

Avenue, Miami, pleaded guilty to charges based upon investi

gation

by United States Customs, Miami, for conspiring

transport arms and ammunition from the

United States without

a license.

JOSE DUARTE and CANDIDO DE LA TORRE were the victims

in a $240,000 robbery at Fort Worth, Texas in about December,

1952. This money had allegedly been taken from New York City

to Fort

Worth for the purpose of buying arms and ammunition on

behalf of CARLOS PRIO.

Miami Informant T-?, of known reliability, being

the representative of a Federal Agency which conducts

investigations, advised on October 18, 1954 that he had

received information from several sources that the CARLOS

PRIO group was attempting to charter, or otherwise acquire,

in the immediate future in an attempt to overthrow the

BATISTA Government

Miami Informant 1-3, of known reliability, who is

well informed concerning the activities of Cuban exiles in

the Miami area, and Miami Informant Toh, of known reliability,

reported on

participate in an attempted revolution against BATISTA, ano

that approximately 150 Cubans from the Miami area would

participate.

These informants said that the wives of

Cubans belonging to the PRIO group in Miami had been weeping

in anticipation of the approaching revolution against

BATISTA, which T-3 and To said would take place on or about

November 1, 1954, the date of Cuban elections.

They expressed

the opinion

that

DIEGO VICENTE TEJERA, a very close

associate of PRIO, would lead this expedition.

TEJERA pleaded nolle contendere in Federal Court,

New York City, in October, 1954 on a charge, based upon

United States

Customs investigation of conspiring to

illegally ship arms to Cuba without a license.

T-3 and T-4 said that Doctor RICARDO LINARES, a

personal friend of Cuban Presidential candidate GRAU SAN

had been in Miami for several days for conferences

wIth PRIO in an attempt to persuade PRIO to postpone any

Cuban elections;

thereby avoiding the necessity of a

revolution.

It is to be noted that GRAU SAN MARTIN withdrew

from the elections several days prior to November 1, 1954).

T-3 and I-4 said LINARES had expressed satisfaction

with his mission to Miami and he felt he had successfully

persuaded PRIO to postpone action.

T=3 and I-4 said that NOEL DEL PINO, another of

PRIO's close associates, had recently succeeded in entering

Cuba clandestinely, but

had sought sanctuary at the

Uruguayan Embassy in Havana because of the

"heat" which had

reported that DEL PINO came to

They also felt that it was entirely

possible that an attempted assassination might be made against

BATISTA•

operating a

short wave radio transmitter and receiver on

behalf of EMILO OCHOA, leader of one faction of the Orthodox

Party of Cuba. It is

to be noted that OCHOA and PRIO, accord-

ing to numerous reports, have been closely associated

each other and representatives of the Authentic and Orthodox

Parties, respectively, in order to unseat the BATISTA

Government.

(This clandestine radio operation will be dealt

with in greater detail elsewhere in this report.

T-5, said that MARTINeL was in short wave radio

contact with PRIO and OCHOA followers in Cuba and Mexico.

He said that MARTINEZ had indicated that a revolutionary

attempt against BATISTA would take place shortly before Cuban

elections, scheduled for November I, 1954, and that the

revolution would be preceded by a student uprising,

followed

by armed landings from boats, including one boat which was

then at Campeche, Mexico.

This boat was allegedly destined

for Bata Bono; a

port in the extreme southwestern side of

Cuba.

T-5 said that MARTINEZ also disclosed that 80 men

would board an unidentified vessel in Miami, being picked

up from small boats as this vessel proceeded down the Miami

River and out of Biscayne Bay. MARTINEZ disclosed to T-5

that he had been invited by OCHOA to personally accompany

OCHOA on this revolutionary maneuver.

He claimed that if the

revolution succeeded he, MARTINEZ, expected to be named chier

of Communications in Cuba and that he would also get a "cut"

on electrical imports into Cuba.

MARIO MARTINEZ is an American born citizen residing

in Miami.

T-5 also said MARTINEZ was in very frequent con»

tact with OCHOA and visited in the homes of both OCHOA and

PRIO.

Miami Informant I-l reported in October, 1954 that

CARLOS PRIO had made a statement in confidence to

one of his

close supporters to the effect that plans for a revolution

which had originally been scheduled for October 9, 1954,

were disrupted by the breakdown of support allegedly expected

from certain key

Army groups, and that preparations were

then going ahead for plans for a reorganization so that PRIO

expected to be in Cuba before November 1, 1954(5)

Miami Informant I-5 reported on October 29, 1954

that MARIO MARTINEZ had learned through either a Cuban radio

operator or members of the PRIO group in Miami that a general

uprising in Cuba was scheduled for the night of October 29,

that a revolution was scheduled for

election day, November 1, 1954, in Cuba, although about ten

bombs had been set off in the eastern part of Cuba on

October 29, 1954.

On October 28, 1954 Miami Informant I-l, of known

reliability, ascertained through sEGuNdo curl, one of

PRIO's closest associates, that a revolution would not take

place until after the November 1, 1954 elections.

place by the Cuban Police in Havana several days previously

would not alter PRIO's plans.

CARLOS PRIO.

Along with this article was a photograph show

November 1, 1954 elections there, was expected to issue, within

the next few days a declaration to Cuban newspapers that he

is coming over to the side of the Cuban Government. T-3

said that OCHOA was also expected to issue an expose of CARLOS

PRIO which would include a statement to the effect that

in a revolutionary move against BATISTA which had been

scheduled for November 1, 1954, but that PRIO had backed out,

fearing to return to Cuba, thereby leaving OCHOA in Cuba

"holding the bag".

(1) CLANDESTINE RADIO OPERATION

As previously indicated,

Miami Informant T-5,_of

known reliability, advised on October 21, 1954 that MARIO

MARTINEZ, a partner in Continental Communications of Florida,

a concern which specializes in repairing and installing two-

way radios, had been operating a clandestine transmitter

and receiver for EMILO OCHOA, a leader of one faction of the

Orthodox Party of Cuba. T-5 said that MARTINEZ was in almost

daily contact with OCHOA and also with CARLOS PRIO, or some

of PRIO's associates in Miami.

It is to be noted that CARLOS PRIO is a leader of

the Authentic Party and EMILO OCHOA, representing his faction

of the Orthodox Party, attended a joint conference of the

two Parties at Montreal, Canada in June, 1953, at which time

it was agreed, according to reports, that the

two Parties

would join forces in order to overthrow BATISTA.

T-5 said that MARTINEZ is a licensed "ham" radio

operator whose call letters are W4JAV. This informant said

MM 2-165

that MARTINEZ had been operating clandestinely for several

weeks and had been in radio communication with PRIO and

OCHOA followers in Cuba and Campeche, Mexico.

T-5 said that

MARTINEZ usually received messages in telegraphic code and

usually answered in plain text in Spanish.

Informant

ascertained that incoming coded messages are usually decoded

by OCHOA, who maintained in his possession

a code book.

This informant also reported on the same date

that OCHOA

was considering installing two-way radio units on

several automobiles which he planned to ship to Cuba. One

such unit had already been installed in OCHOA's car, which

he then kept in Miami.

On October 28, 1954 Miami Informant I-2 advised

that. MARTINEZ had employed a code

in communicating with one

PEDRO UGALDE of Campeche, Mexico.

T-5 reported during the latter part of Uctober,

1954 that MARTINEZ® contacts with OCHOA remained frequent

and daily until ctober 27, 1954, or shortly prior thereto,

when OCHOA, accompanied by EUGENIO GARCIA of Miami, went Dy

plane

to Jamaica.

GARCIA returned directly to Miami from

Jamaica.

However, according to T-3 who reported in the

early part of November, 1954, OCHOA made

a clandestine entry

into Cuba at Oriente Province in Cuban

L=S reported that after MARTINEL was apparently

unsuccessful in contacting OCHOA, that MARTINEZ' attempts

to maintain contact with individuals in Mexico and Cuba

reportedly decreased in frequency and that MARTINEZ

apparently abandoned such efforts in December, 1954

each other in November and December, 1954 that MARTINEL

was extremely cautious in the operation of this radio

station and took many precautions in avoiding detection

and in concealing the identity of persons contacted.

Some

of his messages were in code and others were in plain text

in Spanish.

Government. T=5 reported that one of MARTINEZ' contacts in

Cuba had been RENE BENTANCOURT, who uses call letters COLCY

however T-5 also learned that MARTINEZ suspected BENTANCOURI of

being a "plant" of the luban Intelligence Service in high°E

trust him, and consequently was very circumspect

messages with BENTANCOURT.

T-5 said BENTANCOURT is a "ham"

radio operator in Cuba and had spent some time in November,

1954 in Miami in the company of MARTINEZ and associates of

PRIO and OCHOA. T-5 possessed no knowledge of the opera

tion of this clandestine radio station in January, 1955.

BOATS ALLEGEDLY INVOLVED IN

REVOLUTIONARY SCHEMES

(a) LE FRANCAIS

Information concerning the "LE FRANCAIS" has been

previously reported to the effect, brielly, that CARLOS PRIO

had entered into negotiations to have a 500 watt radio trans

sons o have

mitter installed on this boat, apparently for the purpose of

torterly, matt radio trange

but that PRIO

mitter and receiver installed instead.

T-5 had reported on December 3, 1954 that this boat

was owned as a matter of record by the Inter-Caribbean

Corporation of Miami and T-3 had reported on December 6, 1954

that this boat belonged to JOSE MANUEL CARAMES, former Chief

of Police in Havana who, according to I-3, was

associated with CARLOS PRIO and his group.

Miami Informant I-10, of known reliability, being

reported

been acquired by certain radical Cuban elements in Miami for

the purpose of using her in subversive activities against

the present Cuban Government.

MM 2-165

various Cuban

sources in Miami that JOSE MANUEL CARAMES,

owner of the "LE FRANCAIS", had been furnished the sum of

$25, 000 by CARLOS PRIO on condition that this vessel and

another one owned by CARAMES,

the

"MOLLIE-O", be available

to the PRIO organization should PRIO ever need it.

T-11

said that inquiries relative to the present operations of

this boat reflects that it is not hauling enough cargo at

the present time to make expenses and that if it were not

for PRIO's help, CARAMES would suffer a large financial

loss in the operation of the vessel.

On January 24, 1955 Miami Informant I-12, of known

reliability, being a representative of a Federal Agency which

conducts investigations,

advised that the registry. of

the

"LE FRANCAIS" had been

changed from Canadian to Costa Rican

and that the present owners of this vessel are listed as

JOSE C. CARAMES, JR. and PILAR LINERA LOPEZ, as of December

17, 1954, according to the Provisional Registar,

as issued

the Costa Rican Consul General in Miami.

The Master of

this vessel is listed as WILLIE EBANKS, citizen of Honduras,

and a resident alien of the United States living at 44 N. E.

Seventh Street, Miami, Florida.

I-12 said that another member of the crew was

WILLIAM MORALLES. This vessel cleared Miami January 20,

1955, according to T-12, and sailed January 21

any cargo or contraband. I-l2 said this vessel was supposed

to go to Costa Rica for coffee and cedar.

T-12 said it had been noted by a representative of

his agency that CARAMES possesses a card issued by the Costa

Rican Government authorizing him to operate a radio station.

However, I-12 had determined that the only radio equipment

now on

board this vessel is a marine radio receiver.

T-12 pointed out that PILAR LINERA LOPEZ, listed

as one of the owners, is identical to PASCASIO LINERA, which

fact he said was borne out also by the fact that a crew list

filed with

the Costa

Rican Consul General contained the name

PASCASIO LINERA LOPEZ.

T-12 also felt it could be

significant that LINERA and MORALLES are associated with

this vessel, inasmuch as both of these men pleaded guilty

on a charge

of conspiring to illegally export arms and

1954, following

investigation by United States Customs,

Miami.

T-12 said that MORALLES. had claimed that he would

be in

Cuba when the shooting started.

T-12 described

MORALLES as being a Cuban National who had acquired American

citizenship by virtue of service as a GI with the United

States Armed Forces.

T-12 described the "LE FRANCAIS" as being a 138.1

foot vessel with a 12 foot draft and a tonnage of 225.88.

It is motor driven.

(b) SACHEM II

On October 21, 1954 Miami Informant T-3 advised

that the "SACHEM II" was to be known as the "EL ZORRO" and

several other boats in the Miami area would allegedly

participate in an attempted revolution against BATISTA.

Miami Informant T-13,

of known reliability, report

ed on October 19, 1954 that TOM MCCRORI, Miami yacht

broker

nad made inquiries concerning the "SACHEM II"

yacht which had been purchased August

owner by the name of RAUL ALVA SANCHEZ of Mexico. This

informant said at the time this boat was purchased, ALVA

SANCHEZ had been accompanied to Miami by CRISTOBAL MARTINEZ

ZORILLA, a Mexican who has been previously carried in this

investigation as a contact or associate of the PRIO group.

T-13 said that TOM McCRORY indicated that he might captain

this boat when it left Miami at some time in the near future.

With regard to TOM McCRORY, it is to be recalled

that he allegedly particiapted in a transfer of arms and

ammunition to Cay Sal, a British

West Indies Island off the

coast of Cuba, in 1953.

These arms were later seized by

the Cuban Government.

T-13 was unable to determine at any

subsequent time that McCRORY had any further connection

with the "SACHEM II".

T-13 said this boat was ostensively to be used

for luxury fishing in Mexico and had undergone extensive

repairs in Miami and was then ready for departure at most

any time.

T-13. said that negotiations were then being made

to transfer the registry of this vessel from the American

to the Panamanian flag.

II" had been searched with negative results.

T-12 described

CRISTOBAL MARTINEZ ZORILLA as being an admitted smuggler of

gold and as a suspected narcotics smuggler.

ZORILLA disclosed

to T.12 that he intended to smuggle scotch whisky from the

Bahamas to Mexico.

PRIO's cabinet.)

MARISTANY said that the purpose of this club was

to enlighten Americans as to the political situation in Cuba

in order to restore democracy in Cuba.

He claimed that the

group was not affiliated with any political party in Cuba,

nor organized Cuban group either in Cuba or the United States.

He denied that it was associated in any way with CARLOS PRIO

and said that it did not receive any funds from PRIO or any

other individual or political party.

MARISTANY acknowledged that meetings of this group

had been held at his own home and at the homes of other

members..

He admitted that on the evening of October 278

1954 either ALVARADO or ESCARTIN had brought to his home a

•30 caliber model 1903 Springfield bolt action rifle which

had been used by DELGADO for demonstration purposes that

evening.

MARISTANY also acknowledged that on at least three

occasions during the recent past combat tactics had been

held in his yard by members of the club.

He said that on

none of these occasions, however, did they use real weapons.

They did use two wooden guns, a broom and a mop.

He denied that either he himself or any other

member of the group,

so far as he knew, planned to go to

Cuba at any time in

the near future or to engage in any

revolutionary activities against BATISTA or anybody else.

When questioned as to the purpose of such combat tactics,

MARISTANY said he could not adequately explain why they

had engaged in such tactics.

He indicated that these

maneuvers served as a sort of outlet for their feelings

against BATISTA. He denied that he had made any attempts

(4) REACTION OF CARLOS PRIO TO

BATISTA'S ELECTION AS PRESIDENT

NOV EMBER 7, 1954

The Miami Herald on November 3, 1954 carried an

article entitled "Election Outcome Tragic Joke on Cuban

People, PRIO Asserts"

by GEORGE SOUTHWORTH, Herald Staff

Writer, who reported CARLOS PRIO as having declared that the

election of BATISTA "represents a tragic joke played on the

Cuban people".

In this article PRIO was quoted as having made the

following remarks:

"What happened in Cuba on November 1 can not

be called a general election.

"The state of persecution and violence created

by the armed forces moved Doctor RAMON GRAU SAN

MARTIN, BATISTA's only opponent, to withdraw from

the election on October 31.

"GRAU had asked for a postponement but BATISTA

rejected that demand, thus remaining the sole

candidate for presidency in the election.

"Such a situation has no precedents in

Cuba's history and such a deed cannot validate

the de facto regime established by revolution.

Nor can it

solve the constitutional crisis under

which Cuba has lived since March 10, 1952."

The article stated that PRIO denied rumors that he

had joined forces with GRAU. It quoted him as stating "It

just happened that BATISTA forced GRAU to take the position

that agreed with my own stand concerning the election.

"BATISTA's objectives in going through with

the election were quite obvious.

"He wanted to make his dictatorship

legitimate through an apparent popular electoral

validation which would have allowed him to con-

sider himself a constitutional president.

"Thus he needed some kind of a general

election but when he was practically sure of his

defeat at the hands of GRAu, he createa a stave

of terror and violence and forced GRAU to with-

draw. "

The article also quoted PRIO as stating that the

"so-called" election returns published by BATISTA "represent

a tragic joke played on the people which embitters still

more the already dangerous situation on the island."

This article pointed out that PRIO had been fined

$9000 in October, 1954 by a Federal Judge in New York on a

charge of conspiring to ship arms illegally to Cuba; that

PRIO had entered a plea of no defense to that charge.

security conditions made possible a successiul revolutionary

action against BATISTA.

At the same

time MARTINEZ disclosed

PRIO had failed to finance the purchase of certain automobile

radio equipment needed by OCHOA.

resort to terroristic tactics in Cuba in opposition to

BATISTA..

gathered from this remark that the PRIOs were still interested

in fomenting a revolution in Cuba.

This informant pointed out

that since BATISTA is scheduled to take office February 24,

1955, that any attempt of PRIO to overthrow BATISTA would

logically be made prior to that date.

T-3 reported on January 4, 1955 that a conference

had been held at the home of CARLOS PRIO on New Years

Eve, or Day, at which time PRIO reiterated to some of his

leading associates his intention to overthrow the BATISTA

regime. T-3 possessed no details as to those in attendance

at this meeting.

T-3 was of the opinion that such an effort

would succeed only through assassination of BATISTA and he

felt this would prabably be the means by which PRIO would

attempt to overthrow the BATISTA Government, inasmuch as any

other method would prove futile, since BATISTA had been

elected by an overwhelming majority of the Cuban people.

begun to leave Cuba for key West, Florida in order to join

a revolutionary evasion force which was supposed to leave

from that point for Cuba in the near future.

On December 10, 1954 Miami Informant T-1 advised

The biography points out that AZCUY's

such

a commotion within and outside of Puerto

Rico that he was violently exiled from the island.

The biography also reflects that in 1948 he was

appointed by AURELIANO SANCHEZ ARANGO to be Chief of

Personnel of the Department of Education.

filed an "Application to Extend Time of Temporary Stay".

This

application reflected that he had arrived at the Port of Miami

October 22, 1954 for a thirty day visit from Mexico and

intended to visit his friend LUIS ORTEGA, 3750 Park Avenue,

Coconut Grove, Miami.

1-20 advised that on November 17, 1954 a 42 year old

Suban woman,

ANGELICA PETRONILA FERRER Y MORALES, Came to Key

West, Florida and applied for admission

as a temporary

visitor, but was excluded after she admitted that the purpose

of her visit was to have intimate relations with AZCUY, who

had come from Miami to Key West to see her.

I-20 on December 2, 1954 said AZCUY was interrogated

concerning the above-mentioned Cuban woman.

He described her

as being a female auxiliary of his political party, the

Authentico in Cuba and he implied that the purpose

of her

visit was for a political talk with him in Key West, where he

that he had ever been a member of the Partido

Socialista Popular (Communist Party) in Cuba.

On January 24, 1955 T-18 advised having received

information through AZCUY to the effect that AZCUY had trang

ported forty .45 caliber revolvers or automatics from Miami

to Key West, Florida in two suitcases in November

1954 for

back to Cuba on her return trip.

T-18 did not know the

ultimate destination in Cuba of

these guns

AZUY's original plans. I-18 said that AZUY, of course,

had been prevented from carrying out his plan,

inasmuch as

the woman had been excluded from entering the

United States

Immigration and Naturalization Service authorities.

T-18 did not know whether AZCUY still has possession of

these guns, or whether he has since disposed of them.

III. TRIPLEA

On January 6, 1955 T-ll advised that according to

information which has come to his attention, a small unit of

the Triple A,

the underground anti-BATISTA organization

T-11 named as

members of this unit DIEGO VICENTE TEJERA, TONY SANTIAGO and

his brother ROBERTO SANTIAGO and NOEL DEL PINO. T-11 said that

meetings of this group are being held at the home of ToNY

SANTIAGO, 326 S. W. 20th Road, Miami. I-ll said that from

what he can gather through associates of the PRIO group, the

Miami members of this organization constitute an inner-group

of secret members of PRIO followers who are committed to

engaging in acts of violence when necessary.

• He saed that

members of the group mentioned above have considered the

possibility of assassinating BATISTA and claims have been

made to the effect that one among the group has been found

who is willing to make such an attempt.

On January 20, 1955 I-11 reported that he

suspected that additional members of the

Triple A include

MARIO KUCHILAN, SEGUNDO CURTI,

GULLEREMO PUJOL (who is now

PASCASIO LINERA, MARCOS DIAZ, and perhaps Luis

in Miami'"-Il said all of these individuals frequently meet

at the home of ANTONIO PRIO and some of them meet at the

home

of TONY SANTIAGO, and that these meetings appear to be of a

conspiratorial nature.

T-ll possessed no specific information and he

indicated that the above information was based upon general

observations and suspicions.

T-ll also suspects that MARIO KUCHILAN may be a

contact man for the Communist Party.

He said that this

suspicion was based upon a conversation which MARIO KUCHILAN

had with LOMBERTO DIAZ, a follower of PRIO, recently when

reference was made to work for the Communist Party.

T-11

possessed no additional information to support this suspicion.

IV. MOVIMIENTO NACIONAL REVOLUCIONARIO (MNR)

(NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT)

Miami Informant I-21 on December 9, 1954 directed

attention to an article which appeared in the December 1,

1954 issue of the "Diario de las Americas" of Miami concern-

ing an interview by a newspaper representative with Doctor

RAPHAEL GARCIA BARCENAS, head of

the Cuban National

Revolutionary Movement.

The translation from Spanish into

English of this article reflects that it bore the heading

"Waiting and Vigilance".

The article reflected that BARCENAS,

a Professor of the University of Havana, was named as the

President of this organization.

When questioned whether in

the event of an insurrectional movement would he go with the

MR alone or in conjunction with CARLOS PRIO, he replied to

the effect

"In any insurrectional opportunity that should

open itself to us, we would return with revolutionaries made

up of the different oppositional groupings...as before, and

as in the future, we will maintain ourself

faithful to the

line of revolutionary independence sponsored by the MNR

since its foundation."

When questioned as to his present position and

future plans, he replied in part, "Our present position is

one of waiting and vigilance. We will be zealously on the

watch for the moment in which, with our forces, we might

be of use to our suffering country....

Our future plans are

becoming oriented

in the sense that insurrection and

revolution are not concepts that are considered to be

synonymous, nor do they contradict themselves, rather do

they complement one another."

When asked to explain the foundations and

doctrines of the revolutionary movement over which he

presides, BARCENAS replied in part, "The MNR was constituted

in order

to fuse into a single front the revolutionary

elements which are present in one part of the orthodoxy, in

one part of the authenticism and in one part of the citizenry

without soldiery".

On January 11, 1955 T-22,_ of known reliability,

advised that Doctor RAPHAEL GARCIA BARCENAS, his wife ano

eight year old daughter rented an apartment at 871 S. W. Third

Street, Miami, on November 13, 1954 and have been residing

ever since.

I-22 said that on December 24,

Latin who described himself as being CARLOS ALFARAS made

arrangements for a Cuban family consisting of two women, two

men and two children to occupy another apartment; that shortly

thereafter the woman

and children moved out and the two men

were joined by two additional Cubans.

He said that Doctor

BARCENAS was in contact with these Cubans, whose names were

never known to T-22, however he felt that

their activities

were suspicious inasmuch as they engaged in excited

discussions which appeared to be of a political nature.

He

said that ALFARAS, although making the arangements for the

occupancy of one

of the apartments, did not remain there.

He

also recalled that ALFARAS was well supplied with money.

T-22 also made available for examination one copy of

a small newspaper entitled "Unidad Revolucionario" dated

January

1955 which had been made available by the wife of

BARCENAS. This is a Spanish language newspaper and it

purports to be the official organ of The Club of Exiled Cubans

!J. MARTI!". It contained an article mentioning the name of

BARCENAS in conjunction with the National Revolutionary

Movement

dictatorship of Cuba since March, 1952.

T-22 said that BARCENAS appears to lead a rather

quiet life, although most of his time is spent away from the

apartment.

T-22 said that BARCENAS had claimed, upon being

questioned, that he is not a "PRIO man".

On January 11, 1955 T-3 advised that BARCENAS, a

former Professor at the

University of Havana, and also at

is considered somewhat of a

the Cuban Military Academy 'CARLOS ALFARAS is a close associate

"crack pot".

He said that

of AURELIANO SANCHEZ ARANGO and reportedly came

from Mexico

to wait for "D Day" in Cuba.
