SUBJECT: [2}Re: Release IssuelJFK Board

I gave the EXDIR a heads-up on this issue. He asked several questions:

* Who sits on the JFK Assassination Records Review Board?

* Are there any intermediate steps between a letter from the DDA and an appeal to the President?
* Who would make the appeal to the President, if we went that route? Is it the DCI?

* Has there ever been an appeal to the President before?

* Does the ISCAP have any role?

(C} This is to alert you to an issue that has been raised regarding release of sensitive C/A information by the JFK Assassination Records
Review Board. At its meeting on 14 October, the Board decided to release records that identify the{Warrenton)Records Center as an
Agency facility. Responsible components in the DA object to this release. sen

(FOU) Consequently, OIM, OFSS, OGC, and we are recommending that Dick Calder send a memorandum to the JFK Board Chair
Wudge John Tunheim) asking the Board to reconsider its decision. We'll also propose to Tunheim that a senior officer brief the Board on.
the issue.

(FOUO) It the above steps are unsuccessful, then it is likely that the responsible components would recommend that the Agency appeal
the Board's decision to the President, as allowed under the JFK Act. OGC would prepare any appeal for the EXDIR’s approval.
