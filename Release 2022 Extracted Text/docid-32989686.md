He works at the Tribal Office of the Oglala Sioux
Tribe as an Alcoholic Counselor in the New Careers Program
under Project Recovery, He “worked previously as a counselor
at Porcupine, South Dakota, Boys' Ranch for approximately
1 years,

During the above mentioned demonstration, he observed
approximately 30 persons outside of the Tribal Office and
went out and layed down on the sidewalk because he was very
angry, He.was not asked by anyone to do this but did it on
his own accord because of his strong feelings against the
AIM people for their disruptive practices, While he was laying
down on the sidewalk, he did not trip or kick anyone nor
did he grab anyone, The fact that he was laying on the gide-
walk caused ai] of the people to walk around him,

The next morning he heard from GLENN THREE STARS
that there was a complaint filed against him at the Tribal
Police Department,

WINTERS further stated that approximately one year
ago a group of approximately 80 to 100 men of the Gglala
Sioux Tribe got together and organized themselves against AIM.

March 31, 1973

"I, HERMIS EARL JANIS make the following free and
voluntary statement to BILL DB, COLVIN and JAMES E.
BOWMAN who have identified themselves to me as Special
Agents of the FBI. I was born November 24, 1853 in
Pine Ridge, South Dakota and consider my residence
Manderson, South Daketa. I completed 12 years of
education avid can read and write.

"Early in February ef 1973, I don't remember the exact
date, I was arrested at Wounded Knee, South Dakota by
FRANCIS TWO BULLS and LAVERNE YANKTON, BIA officers
from Pine Ridge. LEH WESTON, aise a BIA officer, came
to the car and spoke to TWO BULLS, but WESTON did not
go to Pine Ridge in the car. I had been drinking ail
night and was very druuk at the time. TWO BULLS put

me in a BIA car which I think may have had a glass
plate across the back seat. There was another person

im the back seat of the car, but I don't know who he
wag. Very shortly after getting in the car, I passed
out or I just can't remember anything else until the
time we arrived at the Pine Ridge Jail. Upon arriving
at the jail, I remember secing MARLIN SUN BEAR in the
pack scat of the BIA car. MARLIN SUN BEAR did not appear
te me to have been beaten or hit, and in no way did he
appear to have been kicked or beaten about the face. in
the jail, UARLIN and I talked and MARLIN never told me
anything about being beaten or struck in the face by
any BIA officers. I heard that MARLIN SUN BEAR teok a
BIA car and ran the car into something, but I don't know
where I was at that time. I do not know JOHN LONG.

FRANCIS TWO BULLS was interviewed at Pine Ridge,
South Dakota, regarding his knowledge of the alleged heating
of MARLIN SUN BEAR by Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) officiais
at Wounded Enee, South Dakota, during the early part of 1973.

“Pine Ridge, South Dakota
April 1, 1973

"J, FRANCIS TWO BULLS make the following free and
voluntary statement to BILL D. COLVIN and JAMES E,
BOWMAN who have identified themseives to me as Special
Agents of the FBI. Mr, BOWMAN advised me of the
nature of the inquiry and of my rights. He furuished
me a warning and waiver form which I read and signed
after stating that I understood my rights.

"I was born May 7, 1927 in Pine Ridge, South Dakota
and consider my residence Manderson, South Dakota,

I completed nine years of education and can read and
write,

"{ have been on the Police Ferce at Pine Ridge for
about nine years altegether,.

"Zarly in 1973 I was in the Wounded Knee, South
Dakota Trading Bost when a female came running into
the store, and said that one of the persons arrested
Bitting in the back seat jumped in the front seat
aud was ready to go. TI had brought a prisoner named
EARL JANIS from Manderson and transferred him to JOHN
LONG, a BIA officer. EARL JANIS was very drunk

and had been passed out. After turning JANIS over

to LONG, I then went into the store. Another officer,
possibly LEE WESTON, a BIA policeman from Porcupine,
South Dakota brought in a prisoner also and trans=<
ferred him to JOHN LONG. Fran out of the store with
LAVERNE YANKTON, a deputy with the Pine Ridge Police
following me. I saw MARLIN SUN BEAR sitting on the
front seat on the driver's side of JOHN LONG's Patrol
car. SUN BEAR was backing the police car up and

ran into a car owned by RUDY BISSONETTE of Manderson.

BISSONETTE was in the car at the time. The car
started spinning forward as he was really gunning
it. I.started running and opened the right front
door and jumped in. The door slamed shut behind
me and I think it smashed my thumb. The car started
spinning around, and I grabbed SUN BEAR around the
neck te prevent him from getting on the highway. We
were fighting over the wheel too. The car went into
a ditch and then hit a culvert, and I think a post,
then the car came to a dead stop. I bumped my head
on the windshield when the car hit the post, and I
was knocked dizzy. I just hung onto SUN BEAR then.
‘I don't think SUN BEAR was injured. JANIS was still
in the back seat and was injured. JANIS busted his
nose, I think, YANKTON, and I think LONG, came
running over to the car, and I let SUN BEAR go. Then
I sat on the seat and held my head, as I was dazed.
They pulled SUN BEAR from the car, and that is all

I saw. I then went to my own police car and called
the Captain, Then I loaded the prisoners into my
car and took them to the Pine Ridge Jail. SUN BEAR
was still drunk at that time. He did not look like
he had been beaten.

a
"I, RICHARD T, LITTLE, make the following
true and voluntary statement to JOHN RYAN THAYER
and JAMES ALAN HILVERDA, who have identified
themselves to ms as Special Agents of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation:

pat _ “¥ am 39 years of age, having been born
January’ 11, 1934, at Pine Ridge, South Dakota,
i have completed four years of High School,
having completed the Van Nuyes Adult Night a
School, Van Nuyes, California. I am a member
of the Pine Ridge Reservation Tribal Council
_ representing the white clay district.

“About the second week in March, 1973,
I, along with several other persons, was at
the BILLY MILLS parking lot in Pine Ridge, South
Dakota, This was also known as the Sioux
Nation parking lot, We were waiting for the
appearance of Senators JIM ABOURESK and GEORGE
pyaar MC GOVERN, We wished to obtain from the
Senators the status of the Wounded Knee
takeover, I would estimate there were 150
persons present, At one time RICHARD WILSON
and two of his body guards, GLINN THREE STARS
and POKER JOE MERRIVALO were in the parking
U Lot, WILSON left for a period and then came
back with approximately 25 other people who
I would describe as his “goon squad", SKI
JACOBS, a Captain of the Pine Ridge Police
Department, called DAVE LONG over for the
purpose of breaking up this group. JACOBS was
informed that the group was peaceful and that
“no trouble was intended, JACOBS said, however,

that- eaea group of people should be broken up.
“DAVE LONG announced to the group that they should
leave,” I went to my Ford Ranchero accompanied

by the past Tribal President ONE FEATHER, Upon
approaching wy pickup I was accosted by FARL DEON,
JR, who stated: that he would take me onat that
time, I knew that some of WILSON's forces had
been drinking and about that time SKI told the
both of us to break it up. | I got in my pickup
and started out of the parking Lot and at that
time I was stopped by GLE JPHREE_ STARS, GLENN
THREE STARS approached my vehicle and took a
swing at me which'I blocked with my left arm and
the blow of the force struck the car door,

JACOBS again came over and stopped the incident:
and at that time I left the parking lot. [

L proceeded to the Wounded Knee junction where I met
a priest who was leaving the Wounded Enee site,

"We, GERALD ONE FEATHER and myself met with
this priest in order to obtain information
concerning what had taken place at Wounded Knee.
Upon leaving Wounded Knee Junction I then went
back to Pine Ridge and stopped at a Husky Station

0 in order to obtain gasoline, At that point the
Area Director WYMAN BABBY and Superintendent STAN
LYMAN came by and asked me if I desired to make

a complaint, I decided that I would make a
complaint and we proceeded to the Pine Ridge
Police Department, While there Lieutenant MICHAEL
O'ROURKE, a police officer who had been in the
parking lot, made the statement that he had seen
.nothing. Though I knew he was there at the time
of the indident, At that point I decided I would
not make a complaint on this incident to the Pine
Ridge Police Department as I felt that nothing
would be done about it. I told off the officers
at the Police Department telling them in affect
"You can keep your damn complaint.” I also stated
this to BABBY and LYMAN,

isn Ba STANLEY D. LYMAN, Trust and Protection Officer,
_ Phoenix, Arizona, Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Area
ce, furnished the following information: sau

Se the latter part of 1972, LYMAN was
‘the .superintendent of the BIA located at Pine Ridge,
: South Dakota, Indian Reservation. During that time,
| -@n attack was expected from American Indian Movement
(AIM) members in an attempt to occupy the BIA building
) : located at Pine Ridge, South Dakota. LYMAN and DICK
‘ WILSON, President of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, formulated
. the idea of creating a security guard force to augment
the BIA police force which was understaffed. LYMAN -
advised that he had more to do with the idea of creating
the security guard force and the implementation than
did WILSON, The idea was presented to the ‘Area and
Central Office of BIA who approved it and furnished
t the authority for the implementation of the security
A guard force. LYMAN did not remember that any specific
i tribal officer or body was involved regarding granting
: commissions to the security guard personnel. Applicants
i for the security guard positions were funneled through
a special police officer of the BIA police force and
when they were accepted, they were granted commissions
and placed on the BIA payroll. LYMAN did not remember
» +» ° who signed the commissions, although he proferred the
{ 7 possibility that he might have signed them himself.
The decision to hire each applicant was made by himself
and the Area Director, ' The Personnel Area Office advised
his office as to the rule procedure to follow in the
issuance of the commissions and hiring procedure.
DICK WILSON had nothing to do with granting the commissions
although he did recommend some individuals as applicants.
These applicants, along with other applicants, were
funneled through the special police officer of the BIA
Police force prior to acceptance and being granted a
commission as a security guard.

I. | - After an applicant was accepted, he was given
training by a BIA police officer and furnished a baton
and mace. The security guards were not authorized to
carry guns. LYMAN remembered nothing regarding the
I ‘training the security guards but did remember
hat the U.S. Marshals were giving training to BIA
olice officers.and it was possible that some of the
isecurity guards could have been present during these
jtraining sessions. LYMAN recalled that after a number
of the applicants had been processed, that there had been
* too many mixed-blooded Indians accepted and he had
insisted on more full-blooded Indians.

LYMAN did not remember if DICK WILSON had
been issued a commission as a security guard$ however
he, WILSON, had applied for a permit to carry a gun.
DUANE BREWER, according to LYMAN, was a member of the
BIA Police force at the time and LYMAN did not think
that there would be any reason for BREWER to have
been issued a commission as a security guard and
doubts that BREWER had been issued such a commission.

A copy of the resolution, number 72-55 dated
November 10, 1972, of the Oglala Sioux Tribal Council
of the Oglala Sioux Tribe signed by LLOYD W. EAGLEBULL,
Secretary of the Oglala Sioux Tribal Council and attested
~» » to by DICK WILSON, President, Oglala Sioux Tribal Council,
- was furnished to LYMAN for his perusal.

After reading the above-described resolution,
LYMAN stated he did not recall that the resolution had
anything to do with the implementation of the security
guard force, although he said the time would be almost
exactly right and the possibility existed that it could
have comprised part of the authority from which the
commissions for the security guard force were issued.

After the threat of attack from AIM members had
died down, the security guard force was disbanded and
ae believed that this included everyone involved with

e force.

. During January, 1973, another attack from
* am members was expected so the security.guard force
was reactivated; however, control at this time of the
force was lost and discipline became a problem. As
‘a‘result, thé security guard force was disbanded
over a period of time and was completely defunct
by the first part of‘ March, 1973.

LYMAN was unable to recall any specific
dindividuals to whom a commission for the security guard
force was granted inasmuch as his memory was rather
hazy regarding these individuals due to the passage
of time. : -

i

Federal Grand Jury (FG. sitting at Rapid City, Sc-ch Dakota,
concerning its investigation of crimes on the Pine Ridge . |
i

Indian Reservation.
Attached advises that on 4/29/75, the FGI sitting at
‘ .Rapid City returned a preliminary report concerning its
| investigation of crimes on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation
which, in effect, concluded that confusion exists between
~i__the-various law enforcement agencies as to who has authority
on'the reservation and that this confusion has resulted in
a dpplication of effort and occasionally friction between the
. different agencies. eee
The report’ acknowledged the Department of Justice is i
charged with the primary responsibility for enforcing the
laws of the United States but that it is the Department of
- the Interior's Bureau of Indian Affairs that is primarily
| _ responsible for law and order on the reservation.
| . The three~page report contained no criticism of the FBI
i and recommended that the Department of Justice, or a
similarly obligated Federal agency, be delegated the law’
enforcement responsibility on reservations. It did observe
that persons living on an Indian reservation in South” Dakota
.. 4 are subjected to a lesser quality of life in part due to a
\ : _ certain degree of failure by all branches .of the Federal :
: Government. The report concluded that the FGJ intends to . }
| : further deliberate and expects to issue a final report. ‘ine

RESIDE WITHIN ONE AGENCY, BECAUSE THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS = %

CHARGED WITH THE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ENFORCING THE CRIMINAL

AND CIVIL LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES, AND BECAUSE THE DEPARTMENT

OF INTERIOR'S BUREAU OF INDIAN AFFAIRS IS PRIMARILY. RESPONSIBLE FOR -
DELIVERING .SOCIAL SERVICES TO MEMBERS OF FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED INDIAN
TRIBES, WE BELIEVE THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, OR ‘a SIMILARLY
OBLIGATED FEDERAL AGENCY , SHOULD BE DELEGATED THE LAW ENFORCEMENT
RESPONSIBILITY ON INDIAN RESERVATIONS.

"WE ARE ALSO DISMAYED TO LEARN THROUGH OUR INVESTIGATION THAT
THE TRIBAL COURT SYSTEM IS NOT ADEQUATELY SUPPORTED BY FUNDS,
PERSONNEL, OR OTHER RESOURCES WHICH NORMALLY ARE AVAILABLE To “STATE
AND FEDERAL COURTS. THE MOST STRIXING INADEQUACY WAS THE LACK OF FUNDS
TO HOLD JURY TRIALS WHEN TRIAL BY JURY WAS DEMANDED BY TRIBAL COURT
DEFENDANTS, THIS APPARENTLY Has RESULTED IN A LARGE BACKLOG OF
CRIMINAL CASES AND A LONG DELAY IN BRINGING THOSE CHARGED WITH
COMMITTING CRIMINAL OFFENSES TO TRIAL. :

“SIT 18 OUR OBSERVATION THAT PERSONS WHO LIVE ON AN INDIAN
RESERVATION IS SOUTH DAKOTA, BOTH INDIAN AND NON-INDIAN, ARE SUBJECT

Title: . RICHARD WILSON;

"GOON SQUAD;"
SEVERT YOUNG BEAR - VICTIM;
ELIZABETH YOUNG BEAR SQUIRREL COAT - VICTIM

Character: CIVIL RIGHTS

Synopsis: Approximately nine shots were fired into and around
‘the residence of SEVERT YOUNG BEAR and his sister ELIZABETH YOUNG
BEAR SQUIRREL COAT at approximately 11:00 P. M., 4/16/73.
Complainant believes the shooting is the responsibility of
RICHARD WILSON and his goon squad. Preliminary investigation
has revealed one possible suspect, ELMER FUDDAWINTER,

: -pe- 7 Mins

Details: This investigation is predicated upon a report made
by MARK LANE, an attorney temporarily residing in
Pine Ridge, who reported to Departmental Attorney JAMES SCHERMERHORN
that several shots had been fired into the home of SEVERT YOUNG
BEAR at Porcupine, South Dakota. Mr. SCHERMERHORN desired that
, &@ preliminary investigation be conducted to ascertain if there is
a violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 241 and/or
242.

On April 17, 1973, MARK LANE advised that at about
da: 0O P. M. on April is, 1973, four unknown occupants of a
purple Plymouth drove into the village of Porcupine, South
Dakota, and fired shots into a home owned by ELIZABETH YOUNG
BEAR SQUIRREL COAT. Mr. LANE characterized this shooting as an
attempt to murder SEVERT YOUNG BEAR by DICK WILSON's "Goon Squad."
Neither YOUNG BEAR nor ELIZABETH SQUIRREL COAT were in the house
atthe time; however, his home was occupied by some children.

MICHAEL LITTLE BOY was in the SMOKE residence just
-northeast of the home of ELIZABETH and GEORGE SQUIRREL COAT on
- the evening of Monday, April 16, 1973. At approximately 11:00
P. HM. on that evening LITTLE BOY heard two quick shots fired.
Within a short space of time he heard seven more shots in quick -
_ Succession. LITTLE BOY immediately exited from the SMOKE
“. residence into the front yard and he saw an automobile about
| 300 yards distant situated near a triangular patch of grass
i between the outér and inner gates on the dirt road leading
4 from the YOUNG BEAR residence. It was a moonlit night and the
| front yard.light was on: This car was in the process of turning
around and could have been either a 1961 or 1962 Plymouth or
Chevrolet and purple in color; however, because of the light
reflection LITTLE BOY could not be certain that the car was
purple. He believes there. were four occupants of the car..

LITTLE BOY was very frightened and he took the SMOKE
children and ran to the home of COLLINS HOBSON which is nearby
and then found that HOBSON was actually at the home of SUSAN CRAGG.
They immediately notified SEVERT YOUNG BEAR ‘who was at a wake at
Sharps Corners and then notified the wife of LEE HARRY WESTON,
Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA} policeman, No investigation was
conducted on that evening but there was an investigation conducted
by BIA on the following day, Tuesday, April 17. At the time of
f this shooting there were present in the LIZA SMOKE home BONNIE
: SMOKE, age 15, EDWARD SMOKE, age 16, ROBERT SMOKE, age 11.

In the YOUNG BEAR home were DARLENE JEALOUS OF HIM,
CLYDE SQUIRREL COAT, age seven months, and BERTHA SMOKE, age 15.
| The one shot that entered the home actually penetrated the
i SEVERT YOUNG BEAR log house situated between the SMOKE residence
and the residence occupied by SEVERE YOUNG BEAR, The automobile
which LITTLE BOY observed ieft the vicinity of YOUNG BEAR
residence at a rapid rate of speed proceeding southeast toward
Batesland. LITTLE BOY is not certain that he could recognize
this automobile if he saw it again. Four cartridges were found

fact that they were shorted about $132 to $144 on some leased
property. The money owing .to them was in the amount of $400
which should have been paid in December, 1972, .The money was

DEL EASTMAN, Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) police,
advised that the shooting of April 16, 1973, at the Porcupine
residence of ELIZABETH YOUNG BEAR SQUIRREL COAT was investigated,
according to his beliefs, by BIA Officers LEE HARRY WESTON and
the officer at Kylie, South Dakota.

* EASTMAN knows SEVERT YOUNG BEAR to bea card-carrying
member of American Indian Movement {AIM}. YOUNG BEAR has given
orders that only card-carrying members of AIM will be allowed on
his place. It is strongly believed that the YOUNG BEAR residence
is being used as a jumping-off place for entry into Wounded Knee
and has been so used from the beginning of the takeover.

EASTMAN said he is of the firm belief that the shooting at the
YOUNG BEAR residence was not perpetrated by RICHARD WILSON or
any of his so-called “goons.” WILSON is not known to perform
any type of covert action such as this-or allow any of his
associates to perpetrate this type of action. There isa
possibility that members of AIM could have done this operation
themselves for some kind of cover.

There were four cartridge casings obtained at the
ELIZABETH YOUNG BEAR SQUIRREL COAT residence which are in the
* possession of the BIA-police at Pine Ridge, South Dakota. This
+ office has developed ne suspects in the shooting.

SAM ROUILLARD, Presbyterian minister, advised that he
has known SEVERT YOUNG BEAR for a good many years. SEVERT YOUNG
BEAR has been “pushed around” by RUSSELL MEANS, American Indian-
. - Movement (AIM) leader. After the takeover Rev. ROUVILLARD and
Father CHARLES were asked te be mediators at Wounded Knee.
During a period early in the takeover in March, , 1873, Rev. .
ROUILLARD overheard MEANS tell YOUNG BEAR that he was not : non
doing his job. .- By not doing his job MEANS meant that YOUNG 7
_ BEAR was not adequately furnishing food, oil, warriors, guns
if and ammunition to the persons who took over Wounded Knee.

Rev, ROUILLARD said he is firmly convinced that the
type of action that took place would not have been done by
“RICHARD WILSON and his associates. It is very easy to blame
RICHARD WILSON €or this type of thing as he is opposed 100%
to AIM and is considered the enemy. Rev. ROUILLARD has known
RICHARD WILSON for mang years and said that he is not the type
of man to take part in any after=dark cowardly action. WILSON
is the type of man who believes in direct overt action and
would never take part in this kind of thing.
| te
"Rev. ROUILLARD had no information bearing on the
perpetrators of this incident, It has been rumored that food
and supplies are being taken through the SEVERT YOUNG BEAR
place into Wounded Knee. Rev. ROUILLARD believes that YOUNG
BEAR desires to obtain some publicity from the shooting as he
asked Father CHARLES, the Catholic priest, to take him to Pine
~ . Ridge to call President NEFXON on Thursday, the 19th of April.
Rey. ROUILLARD advised Father CHARLES not to do this. He could
furnish no suspects.

warvin GHOST BEAR of Batesland, South Dakota, advised

that on the late evening of April 16 or early morning of April 17,
1973, he was at the home of a friend of his, RICHARD RED OWL, in ‘
Batesland. While he was watching the Johnny Carson show that
evening one ELMER WINTER came to the RED OWI, home asking for
help as his automobile had broken down. G#OSY BEAR and RED OWL
went out and observed that there was a car parked at the Coop
Grocery store in. Batesland. The car was a 1965 light green

_ Chevrolet. The car-was steaming and could be started; however,
at was apparently inoperable and it was making a lot of noise
as though a rod had been thrown.

GHOST BEAR later learned that there had been a shooting
incident at the home of SEVERT YOUNG BEAR in Porcupine around
21:00 P. M. The car was left at the same places and GHOST BEAR
later learned that it was hauled into Pine Ridge by a. junk dealer.
whose name is BISSONETTE (ph). GHOST BEAR is of the belief that
that particular car is the property of GLENN THREE STARS, ELMER
WINTER is reputedly employed in some capacity, by RICHARD WILSON,
Pregident of the Pine Ridge Tribal Council. GHOST BEAR described

including bocts. His closest associates are GLENN THREE STARS,
BENNY and CHUCK RICHARDS, and EARL DEON.

WINTER originally came from Wanblee, South Dakota,
but has been staying in Pine Ridge, GHOST BEAR advised that he

RICHARD WILSON, OGLALA SIOUX TRIBAL CHAIRMAN;
EUGENE ROOKS, OGLALA SIOUX TRIBAL HOUSING DIRECTOR;
THEODORE TIBBETTS, OGLALA SIOUX TRIBAL JUDGE;
ALLEGED EVICTION ORDERS ISSUED BY OGLALA SIOUX
TRIBAL COURT AGAINST RESIDENTS OF OGLALA SIOUX
TRIBAL HOUSING FOR OPPOSITION TO RICHARD WILSON'S

ADMINISTRATION; UNKNOWN VICTIMS

J. Stanley Pottinger, Assistant Attorney General,
Civil Rights Division, United States Department of Justice,
Pine Ridge, South Dakota, requested by letter dated April 14,
1973, that copies of all eviction orders issued by the Oglala
Sioux Tribal Court or by the appropriate Department of Interior
agency be obtained for the period between March 15, 1973, and
the present as an allegation had been made that Richard Wilson,
Oglala Sioux Tribal Chairman, through Eugene Rooks, Oglala
Sioux Tribal Housing Director, and Theodore Tibbetts, Oglala
Sioux Tribal Judge, was causing eviction orders to be issued
evicting unknown persons opposed to his administration from
Oglala Sioux tribal housing.

Sidney Witt, Oglala Sioux Tribal Prosecutor, Pine
Ridge Indian Reservation, advised on April 18, 1973, that he
processes all eviction notices requested by the Oglala Sioux
Tribal Housing Authority. He stated that no eviction orders
have been issued by the Tribal Court since March 15, 1973, and
that he could not recall any person having been evicted in the
past three or four years. He advised it was his understanding
that the Housing Authority was planning eviction orders against
several individuals at the time of the Wounded Knee takeover but
that these requests had not been made as yet due to the turmoil
created by the takeover.

Mrs. Wynema Janis, Secretary of the Oglala Sioux
Tribal Housing Authority, Pine Ridge, advised on April 19, 1973,
that the last person to be evicted by the Tribal Housing
Authority was Ethel Rodriquez on December 31, 1972, when she
moved to Kyle on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation where she
has been residing in a house owned by the American Legion. At
the time of her eviction, she was $435.08 in arrears in rental
payments and the apartment had been considerably damaged.

On February 6, 1973, Ethel made a payment of $200 and on April 12,
1973, she made a $261. 08 payment to liquidate her debt even
though she had vacated the apartment in December, 1972. Mrs.
Janis advised she believes Ethel Rodriquez wished to obtain a
housing authority apartment in Kyle and in order to do so would
have_had to clear her past rental debt. She stated whether or
not Ethel Rodriquez receives another low rent apartment depends on
the review of her application by the local Kyle screening board
which is composed of local Kyle residents appointed by the local
Kyle District Council.

Mrs. Janis advised the housing authority is currently
in the process of obtaining eviction orders through the
| Tribal Court against the following individuals who had been

their respective districts. Each ballot box contained an in-

~=wentory list detailing the contents of the ballot box and the
‘amount of ballots ‘in this ballot box. ‘The ballot box was under
the direct supervision of the Election Judges in the different
precincts. At the end of the voting in each district the Elec-
tion Judge in each precinct was responsible for padlocking the
ballot box, dropping the key to the padlock into the ballot box,
and then, accompanied by two policemen from the BIA, delivering
the ballot box to the Oglala Sioux Tribal Election Board, Pine
Ridge, South Dakota.**Once the ballot box was at the Election--?
‘Board Headquarters, it was under the supervision of the members
of the Oglala Sioux Tribal Election Board.

possession of official ballot boxes or in the immediate vicinity
of the ballot box after they had been returned to the Election
Board Headquarters with the following exception:

The Election Board Headquarters were located in the
Oglala Sioux Tribal building in the basement. RICHARD WILSON,

individuals in various districts by election officials in order
to allow these individuals to vote if these individuals were
crippled or otherwise unable to get out and vote. He advised

.'., Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and that they wanted
’ "to interview her concerning possible violations of Federal laws
_ ° during the 1974 Oglala Sioux Tribal Elections on the Pine Ridge

reading the form BLACK ELK agreed to be interviewed by the Agents
and waived her- rights by signing a form FD-395, She then furnished.
the following information: : 7

. During the pitimary election and general election of the
Oglala Sioux Tribe in 1974, she was the election judge of District 9,
Manderson, South Dakota. During both elections, she was at the poll,
which was located in the St. Agnes Hall, a Catholic Meeting House in
Manderson, South Dakota, from the time the poll opened at 9:00 a.m...

- until the poll closed at 7:00 p.m. At no time during these hours -did
she ever leave the poll. pee : i

When people came to the poll to vote, at both the primary
and general elections, they would give their name and BLACK ELK would -
. check the name against a list of tribal members of the Manderson Faas
District elligible to vote. This list was provided by the Bureau of
Indian Affairs Census Office. If that persons name appeared on the
list, he or she would then place their signature, address and date on
another sheetcof paper, When this procedure was completed, BLACK ELK
would stamp the ballot with a rubber stamp with the words "official
ballot" and give the ballot to the voter. The signature was not com-
. pared with any signature list to determine elligibility.

If the person's name did not appear on the census list, and
that person was. a member of the Oglala Sioux Tribe and had resided in
the Manderson District for a period of at least one year, BLACK ELK
would furnish the individual an affidavit setting -forth-that informa-
tion. After the person signed that affidavit, it would be returned to
BLACK ELK and the individual would also sign the signature list and
be furnished a ballot as described above.

No persons were requested by BLACK, ELK to show any identifica-
tion to verify their identity. BLACK ELK advised that she has lived in

their release papers. BLACK ELK advised that the release paper
was only a small slip of paper stating that they were released
from their duty as election officials, BLACK ELK did not have

the release paper at the time of this interview and stated that
she did not believe it could be located. There is no way to
account for specific ballots, 7 :

At District 9, there were no absentee ballots given to
any voters and no requests were made for absentee ballots. No
absentee ballots were received at that poll. There were three
people who attempted to vote at the poll but advised they lived
in Rapid City, South Dakota, and due to this, 1 BLACK ELK refused
to furnish them a ballot and they left. 7

The poll watchers present at District 9 were MYRTLE
JOHNSON and BERNICE WHITE HAWK, both of Manderson, South Dakota.
Both of these individuals were representing RUSSELL MEANS as
poll watchers. No individuals, to BLACK ELK's knowledge, were’
prevented From being a poll watcher.

LOOKS TWICE voted in the primary and general elections, BARBARA
SWALLOW and her husband, HERB SWALLOW, both voted in the general
election. BLACK ELK had no reason to believe that these indivi-
duals did not reside on the reservation for one year prior to
the election, She added that MASTERS, LOOKS TWICE, and HERB SWALLOW
were on the census list but BARBARA SWALLOW was not on the census
list and she submitted a signed affidavit. BLACK ELK had no knowledge
as to whether or not RICHARD WILSON or MYRON ROCK were election
officials for the primary and general elections. MYRON ROGK, the day

hoe” before the general elections, did deliver the ballot box and voting
materials to LAWRENCE HOLLOW HORN, who is BLACK ELK's brother,
HOLLOW HORN has been the election judge in previous years and
according to what he told BLACK ELK, ROCK did not know that BLACK
ELK was to be the election judge for 1974, HOLLOW HORN took the
ballot box to the poll at Manderson, South Dakota, on the morning
of the election. MYRON ROCK and RICHARD WILSON were not present
at the poll during the election nor did ‘they have anything to do
with the transportation of the ballot boxes or ballots from the
poll to Pine Ridge, South Dakota. BLACK ELK had no knowledge of
whether either of these individuals were involved in the counting ;
of the ballots. :

“According to the instructions received by BLACK ELK,

there were 200 ballots delivered to District 9. During the day,
BLACK ELK gave ten ballots: to District 10 because there were not
enough ballots provided to that district. To BLACK ELK’s recol-

“ lection, approximately 148 or 149 persons voted at District 9 that
day, so she should have had approximately 40 blank ballots left at
the end of the day. She did not have time to count the blank ballots
after the poll closed, prior to going to Pine Ridge but it appeared
the stack which was left may have been-in excess of 100 blank ballots.

BLACK ELK advised that she did not wish to furnish a) signed
statement at this time.

7 RUFF advised that as a person came into the voting room, he
asked them to sign their name on the pad of paper provided by the Board,
he then checked this name against the list of eligible voters. If the
names checked okay, he then took a blank ballot, stamped it with the
official ballot stamp and then handed the ballot to the voter. The
voter would then go into the voting booth, close the curtain, and
- mark their ballot. Upon completion of voting, the voter would fold
the ballot, exit the voting booth, and drop the folded ballot into
the ballot box which was placed on the table in front of the Election
Judge. i amt -

io RUFF advised that the ballots were not numbered in any
-order and he did not place any number on them. The only thing he -
affixed to the ballot was the stamp "official ballot." RUFF stated
that the procedure used to account for all the ballots is as follows:
The Board of Election Tribal Office, Pine Ridge, South Dakota, sent
out in the padlocked ballot box a designated number of blank ballots.
The total of these ballots was written on the sheet of paper setting fort.
the contents of the locked ballot box. RUFF, prior to the voting
counted these blank ballots and determined that the correct number
were sent. Then, after the voting place was closed, the total of
marked ballots were counted and the remaining unmarked ballots were
counted, The total of these two counts were added and checked with
the total of ballots sent out by the Board of Election. RUFF stated
that there were no errors in his ballot counts and his District ac- _
counted for all the ballots sent by the Board of Election.

amar ‘

RUFF advised that no form of identification is required of
the voter when they appear at the voting place. RUFF stated that
VERNIE TALLMAN and he, being long time residents of the Pine Ridge
Indian Reservation and the Pass Creek voting district, mow all the
residents and eligible voters and if they are of legal voting age.
He advised that at no time was the identification question of the
voters questioned except in one incident. ‘This person is the hus-
band of JOY MARSHAL's daughter and resides in the housing project
of Allen, South Dakota. This male was not allowed to vote as he
is a white man and is not known to the clerk, VERNIE TALLMAN, or
RUFF and is not a member of the Oglala Sioux Indian Tribe. ‘This
man stated that he was Indian; however, when it was explained to
him that he would have to prepare affidavits prior to voting, this
man made no further issue of the matter and did not vote. RUFF
Stated, however, that his wife did vote as she is eligible to
vote. RUFF described this man as about thirty-five years of age,
short hair, mustache, about five feet nine inches tall, and weighs..
150 pounds, light complexion, wore blue jeans and a sport shirt.

. RUFF advised there were no requests for absentee ballots
and, in fact, there were no absentee ballots in his district during
this most recent election. He stated he received no absentee ballots
of any sort. He advised that in view of the fact they received no
absentee ballots, there were no procedures in distinguishing absentee
ballots from the other ballots. Therefore, there was no separate
ballot boxes for voting and all ballots were placed in only one
ballot box, the box provided by the Election Board.

7 ; RUFF advised that the procedure of collecting absentee
ballots did not exist in his district this election as there were
no absentee ballots. euerssee :
a‘ RUFF advised that at the completion of the election and the
count of the ballots, all the voting material is placed into the ballot
box along with the key to the padlock. The box is then closed, pad-
locked, and picked up by the police. RUFF stated that he received a
telephone call from DAVE BREWER who advised him that if the police
car did not arrive to pick up the ballot box on Election night he was
to bring it in to his, BREWER's, office the next morning. RUFF ad-
vised that after the counting of the ballots, the recording of same
- and the calling in of the results of the voting, he secured the box
and awaited the arrival of the police car. When the police car did
not arrive, he took the ballot box to his residence and then delivered
the box to DAVE BREWER's office the next morning.

RUFF stated that in those instances where a voter's name

did not appear on the eligible voters list and they were allowed to

- vote after they prepared a Residency Affidavit. This is a printed -
form which the person fills out attesting in front of the Election
Judge and the Election Clerk that they are a resident of the voting

‘district for one year, their residence, and that they are of the
legal voting age, which, according to RUFF, is twenty-one years of
age. RUFF stated that these affidavits are placed in the ballet box
at the completion of the election and returned to the Board of Election
Office. He stated that it is then the responsibility of the Board of
Election to see that the name on the affidavit is then added to the
eligible voters list for the next election.

RUFF advised that he has no knowledge of any official or
unofficial poll watcher at his polling place. RUFF advised that at
about 8:30 in the morning of election day a young male Indian came
into the polling place and remained in the corner all day long. This
man was about thirty years old, six feet tall, slim build, dressed
well. RUFF stated this man made no comments about the election pro-
cedures, made no challenges and after the counting of the ballots
were complete and the ballot box locked, this man left the polling
area. RUFF stated he did not know this man and later learned his
name was IRON CLOUD; however, his first name was unknown to him.
RUFF advised that no person was prevented from being a poll watcher

by either VERNIE TALLMAN or himself and, in eae they did not have
any poll watchers unless the male Tnaian, TRON CLOUD, who remained
inside the polling place all day was a poll watcher.

ane

‘RUFF. stated he is not acquainted with an ALVIN IRON CLOUD
and that stitch a person did not vote in his district. RUFF stated
that he cannot state if ALVIN IRON CLOUD is in fact the same TRON
CLOUD that sat in the polling Place all day. -

RUFF concluded that last Wednesday, March 20, 1974, a
young man came to him and asked almost the identical glestions as
have the interviewing Agents.~ :

7 RUFF stated this man was a young Indian male, about thirty
years of age, five feet nine inches tall, 140-150 pounds, slender
build, dark complexion. RUFF "stated that he was driving a car with
a Pennington County, South Dakota, (2 - balance unknown) license
‘plate. This man told RUFF the White House had sent him to the
Pine Ridge Indian Reservation to ask these questions about the
recent election. The only questions that RUFF could recall this
young man asking were the number of ballots sent out and if it
was a fair election. RUFF stated he has never seen this man before.

STOMLEY advised that some of the listed addresses appear to
be off Pine Ridge Indian Reservation but are only mailing addresses of
the closest town with a United States Post Office. She advised the
addresses reflected above are only the last known addresses and she
has no reference to the date in which these individuals resided at
that address.

STOMLEY advised those individuals. above who have not been
identified through her records could be as a result of a marriage or
the use of a name other than the original Indian family name. She
said it is a fairly common practice of Indians to shorten their last

names and therefore make it impossible to identify against her records
_ without benefit of the full given name.

ALMA JACOBS, Fiscal Manager; Oglala Sioux Tribe (OST),
Head Start Program, Pine Ridge Agency South Dakota, was contacted
at her employment. JACOBS was advised of the official nature
of SA LARRY L. DE WITT's contact with-JACOBS.

Upon questioning JACOBS advised as follows:

\

In regard to the debit in the amount, of $14,583.00
on September 6, 1972, from the account of the OST Head Start
Program and which account is maintained at the First National
Bank of Gordon, Nebraska, account number 0125873, JACOBS advised
that the Parent Child Center as well as the Head Start Programs
funds were obtained from a tribal grant received from Health
Education and Welfare , Washington, D.C. In 1972, the funding
for both of these programs was received by this same letter of ¢
credit.

i

The $37,718.00 which was received by US Treasury
H payment voucher 72-15 letter of credit number 75-01-9701 and
which was deposited in the account of the Head Start Program
OSt at First National Bank Gordon, Nebraska, on August 31, 1972,
actually contained the funding from both the Head Start and
the Parent Child Centsear Program.

It was therefore necessary to transfer $14,583.00,
the amount for the Parent Child Center Program from the Head
: Start Program into the other account.

JACOBS advised that there wag nothing unusual in regard
to the above transfer of $14,583.00 from the Head Start Program
since is was customary to transfer this months since the funding
for both programs came by the same letter of credit.

A JACOBS was of the impression that CARMEL MEANS formerly
handled the Parent Child Center funds at which time MEANS office
was located at the Pine Ridge Airport . This progiiam is now handled

To JACOBS understanding all records regarding funding
H for the Parent Child Program shad be maintained by IRON CLouD
at Porcupine, South Dakota.

In regard to the allegation made by the now deceased
HATTIE TWISS that RICHARD WILSON drew $14,000.00 from the Head
Start Program during the first part of Ocbber, 1972, and would
account for this withdrawal JACOBS advised that this allegation
was untrue inasmuch as she and the interviewing Agents had just
reviewed all the records of the Head Start Program for October of
1972. In addition JACOBS advised that in regard to TWISS's
allegation that WILSON had forged her signature on the check,
JACOBS noted that aithough TWISS was director of the Head Start
| Program at that time she was not a disbursing officer and the
i checks at that time would have been signed by DMMA F. NELSON

On July 17, 1974, a conference was held between
Assistant United States Attorney ROBERT D. HIARING and
SA LARRY L. DE WITT. This conference was held at the
Office of the United States Attorney, Sioux Falls, South
Dakota.

During this conference it was pointed out to
Mr. HIARING that several of the original allegations in
this matter were non specific in nature and that those
allegations that were specific in nature have been investigated,
and investigation conducted had not substantiated these
allegations.

In addition, Mr. HIARING was apprised of previous
General Accounting Office reports and audits concerning
the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, as well as the fact
that audits had been conducted by Certified Public Accountant
firms at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, South Dakota,
and these audits had not substantiated previous charges of
corruption.

After reviewing this matter, Mr. HIARING advised
that due to the non specific nature of some of the allegations,
and due to the fact that investigation conducted regarding
the specific allegations did not substantiate the allegations,
further investigation was not warranted in this matter, and
this matter did not merit Federal prosecution.

(MISAPPROPRIATION OF TRIBAL FUNDS)

Investigation into misappropriation of tribal funds
belonging to the Sun Dance Ceremony in 1969 reflects
that subject and ROBERT/MOUSSEAU were indicted in
this matter. Charges against subject were dismissed
and MOUSSEAU was convicted. Investigation continues
to determine if subject misappropriated funds under
his control as housing directox for, _the Oglala
Sioux Tribe, + Kee

-P-

DETAILS:

This investigation was predicated upon the
allegation of PEDRO BISSONETTE, American Indian
Movement (AIM) leader inside the occupied Village
of Wounded Knee, South Dakota, that in 1968 or 1969,
the Tribal Council appropriated $6000 of tribal funds
for the Sun Dance Ceremony and RICHARD WILSON
embezzled a portion of these funds,

BISSONETTE also alleged that when WILSON
was housing director for the reservation, he
misused funds under his control in that he sold
building materials which had been purchased with
government funds and thereafter converted the proceeds
of these sales to his own personal use.

In WILSON's capacity as chaixman of the Sun Dance
Ceremony, he received $6000 from the tribe in order to
promote the ceremony but the ceremony never actually took
place while WILSON was chairman, There was an investigation
into the embezzlement of these funds about two years ago and
as a result of the investigation, one of WILSON's ‘goon

GERALD ONE FEATHER, Oglala Sioux Tribal Chief
prior to RICHARD WILSON, Box 298, Oglala, South Dakota
(telephone 867-5327), provided the following information:

Since RICHARD WILSON became president of the
Oglala Sioux Tribe in January, 1972, ONE FEATHER has been
working with both the American Indian Movement (AIM) and
the Oglala Sioux Tribal Council in an effort to improve
the criminal justice system and the financial status of
the Oglala Sioux Tribe on the Pine Ridge Reservation.

ONEFEATHER suspects Chairman WILSON of many
wrong deings since becoming chief of the Oglala Sioux Tribe,
but he has no direct proof or evidence which could be
used against WILSON in a court of law. Since WILSON
became president, he has suspended and fired many
competent people who were associated with the Tribal
Council because these people would not cooperate with
WILSON in carrying out various "deals" which WILSON was
trying to do,

WILSON suspended the Office of Economic Opportunity
(OEO) Headstart Director HATTIE TWISS, because she would
not cooperate with WILSON concerning the payment of approxi-
mately ten to fifteen thousand dollars to WILSON's brother,
JAMES J, WILSON, .for some type of consulting fees he
received through the Headstart program. TWISS can be
located at the hospital in Gordon, Nebraska.

WILSON is involved with a contractor in Rapid
City, South Dakota named JERRY GLAZE, WILSON has been
giving all construction contracts on the Pine Ridge Reservation
to GLAZE and not allowing Indian labor to be utilized in
various construction projects currently underway on the
reservation. GLAZE supposedly gave WILSON $10,000 to
assist him (WILSON) in winning the Oglala Sioux Tribal
presidential election in 1971-1972.

An individual named CARROL SWAN who has an
office next door to the Northwest Engineering Company in
Rapid City and whose telephone number is 348-1090, has
information concerning heavy equipment which belongs to

‘4/2/73

MP 70-6806

the Oglala Sioux Tribe that WILSON sold and then used
the proceeds from this sale for his personal use.

Since WILSON took office in January, 1972,
the books and records for the Oglala Sioux Tribe have
not been audited and according to several members of
the Tribal Council the records which are currently
being kept are very inadequate.

During the ONE FEATHER administration, the
accounting firm of Thornton and Saylor in Rapid City
was responsible for auditing the books and records of
the Oglala Sioux Tribe. Also, an accountant named
FRANCES KILLER who lives in Vermillion, South Dakota
and whose telephone number is 642-4963, was under a
contract with the Tribe to do monthly accounting work
for the Tribe. KILLERs contract with the Tribe ex-
pired in’ October, 1972 and WILSON would not renew
his contract. fs

The General Accounting Office (GAO) recently
conducted an audit of the Oglala Sioux Tribe records.
The results and findings of this audit were to be
reported to Senator HENRY JACKSON of Washington State
on April 2, 1973, in Washington, D. C. JACKSON is
Chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee.

IVAN BETTELYOUN, who was the Oglala Sioux
Tribal Fiscal Manager until his resignation in December,
1972, can furnish information to the FBI as to WILSON's
handling of financial matters of the Tribe. BETTELYOUN
resigned because he did not agree with WILSON's handling
of financial matters and as a result of this, he and
WILSON could not get along with each other. BETTELYOUN
resides outside of Oglala, South Dakota in a silver
trailer house located two miles south of ONE FEATHER's
residence.

Nebraska, can furnish information concerning the financial
stability of the Oglala Sioux Tribe. The Stockman National
Bank has various loans and checking accounts for the
Tribe.

Concerning WILSON's involvement in the embezzle~
ment of Tribal funds from the Sundance Ceremony in 1969,
ONE FEATHER provided a xerox copy of a Federal Grand Jury,
District of South Dakota, Western Division, indictment of
ROBERT MOUSSEAU and RICHARD WILSON, MOUSSEAU was con-
victed on the charges of embezzling Tribal funds but the
charges against WILSON were dismissed. ONE FEATHER does
not know why the charges against WILSON were dismissed.
He feels that WILSON paid MOUSSEAU to take the rap for him.
C. H. KEITH, who lives in the East Ridge subdivision in
Pine Ridge, has information concerning the misuse of funds
by WILSON in his position as housing director for the
Tribe in that WILSON sold building materials which had been
purchased with government funds and thereafter converted
the proceeds from the sale of these building materials to
his own personal use.

ONE FEATHER provided a financial statement of
the Oglala Sioux Tribe as of April 12, 1972, which re-
flected the results of an audit of the Oglala Sioux
Tribal records of the ONE FEATHER administration. He also
provided a memo to the Tribal Council which set forth
the predication for the audit of April 12, 1972.

ONE FEATHER advised that if he can be of any
further assistance to the FBI he will be more than
willing to cooperate.

following information:

SWAN is president of the Indian Business Center
(1BC) in Rapid City, South Dakota. The IBC performs
various business and service functions for the Oglala
Sioux Tribe (OST). Also, the IBC operates a contracting
business and is currently attempting to obtain contracts
for various construction projects taking place on the
Pine Ridge Reservation,

SWAN alleged that DICK WILSON, Oglala Sioux Tribal
Chairman, recently sold heavy equipment belonging to the OST,
which included a back-hoe traetor, a dump truck and a
low-boy and he (WISON) kept the proceeds from this sale for
his own personal use. The three pieces of equipment in
question were located in the equipment lot of Barton
Construction Company, Highway 272 South, Rapid City, about
one month ago. Photographs of this equipment were taken and
SWAN will make these photographs available to the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) at a later date.

An Indian woman, MURIEL WAUKAZOO, 112 Nowlin,
Rapid City (telephone 348-1247), entered the equipment
yard of Barton Construction in an attempt to identify
three pieces of equipment as belonging to the OST, She
opened the glove compartment of one of the vehicles in order
to check the identification plate which shouldhave been
affixed to the glove compartment. She saw the identification
plate, which bore the name "Oglala Sioux Tribe -— Department
of Interior" torn off the glove compartment. This identification
piate was lying inside the glove compartment of the vehicle,

Mr. OWNS MANY HORSES, Equipment Supervisor, OST,

Pine Ridge, identified the equipment which was located at the
Barton Constructions Equipment Yard as belonging to the OST.

SWAN has heard that the three pieces of equipment
in question have mysteriously reappeared back in the
equipment yard of the Pine Ridge Reservation which is
across the street from the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA)
Police Station, Pine Ridge.

MILDRED GALIAGO, who lives in the Sioux Edition,
Rapid City, can provide additional information concerning
the above-mentioned equipment.

On Sunday, Mareh 11, 1973, the day the roadblocks
around Wounded Knee were suspended, SWAN, his wife CHARLOTTE,
his two children, ages 7 and 4, entered Wounded Knee, South
Dakota, -for the purpose of bringing SWAN's mother-in-law
out of Wounded Knee. As SWAN was leaving Wounded Knee, he
was met by several Indian guards who requested that he give
them the food and blankets which SWAN had in his car.

SWAN gave the Indians inside Wounded Knee all the food and
blankets in his possession,

SWAN and his wife CHARLOTTE are completely
sympathetic to the American Indian Movement (AIM).
CHARLOTTE has a financial administrative position with AIM.

SWAN is a member of the Cheyenne River Sioux
Tribe and his wife is a member of the Oglala Sioux Tribe.

JOE HORN CLOUD, Supply Technician and Purchasing
Agent, Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), Pine Ridge, provided
the following information:

He is responsible for accounting for all ‘equipment
and supplies for the Oglala Sioux Tribe (OST). His duties
also include purchasing new equipment and disposing of
obsolete equipment.

There has not been any heavy equipment such as a
back-hoe trailer, a dump truck or a low-boy which has been
sold by the Tribe in many years. RICHARD WILSON, Tribal
President, is in no position or has no access to equipment
belonging to the Tribe and he could not obtain any equipment
from the Tribe to sell without HORN CLOUD's knowledge.

The last time a physical inventory was taken of
the OST equipment all equipment belonging to the Tribe
was accounted for. The next physical inventory is scheduled
for June, 1973. If any large pieces of equipment are
missing HORN CLOUD would have knowledge of this as all the
heavy equipment belonging to the Tribe is being used at this
time and HORN CLOUD knows this equipment is accounted for.

The OST does not have heavy equipment such as a
dump truck, a flatbed trailer or a back-hoe which is any newer
than a 1956 model.

HORN CLOUD will furnish any information from the’
inventory records of the OST equipment inventory at the
request of the FBI,

GEORGE F, WILSON, brother of Tribal Chairman
DICK WILSON, Post Office Box 33, Whiteclay, Nebraska, provided
Cans the following information:

About three years ago, his brother, DICK WILSON, received
a Government grant to start a contracting business. At the same
time, GEORGE was in the process of beginning a "ditching
contracting" business. DICK WILSON gave GEORGE WILSON about
$6,000 or 87,000 to help GEORGE purchase heavy equipment which
he needed to operate the business. GEORGE took the grant money
which DICK gave him and borrowed additional funds from the First’
National Bank of Gordon, Nebraska. With this money, he (GEORGE)
purchased a two-ton Chevrolet truck from Coons Chevrolet in: .
Martin, South Dakota, and a back hoe and low boy from an unrecalled
equipment company in Cheyenne, Wyoming. GEORGE WILSON has all
cancelled checks and documents surrounding this transaction;
however, the records are boxed up as he is in the process of
moving. He will make these records available to the FBI upon
request.

About the latter part of 1971, GEORGE WILSON's health
became very poor and he had to get out_of the contracting business.
DICK WILSON took over the business and after a short time and asa.
result of a contract where the business accumulated many repair
bills from the back hoe, the business went broke. At about this _
time, DICK WILSON began working in the Tribal presidential political
campaign and he (DICK) let the equipment sit at his (DICK's) house
in Pine Ridge, South Dakota. GEORGE WILSON picked up the equipment
from DICK's house and took it over to his house. He told the :
First National Bank that the equipment was for sale. DICK WILSON
told GEORGE WILSON that Barton Construction wanted to purchase the
equipment. GEORGE contacted a representative of Barton and they |:
made a deal for Barton to purchase the equipment. GEORGE WILSON
and the representative from Barton Construction in Rapid City;... |.
South Dakota, went to the First National Bank of Gordon where WILSON
signed over the equipment to Barton and Barton paid off the loan on
the equipment. ars

South Dakota, telephone number 342-5823, was interviewed by
Bureau Agents at his residence. He was advised of the identities
of the interviewing Agents by display of their FBI credentials.
He was advised that the FBI wished to question him concerning the
possible sale of heavy equipment to the Oglala Sioux Tribe on the
Pine Ridge Indian Reservation by Tribal Chairman DICK WILSON
wherein WILSON kept the proceeds for his own personal use and
GLAZE's possible involvement in this sale, GLAZE was advised
of his rights as stated on the Interrogation; Advice of Rights
Form which he signed and thereby waived his rights.

GLAZE is a sales representative for the Dakota Leasing

work on the reservation as well as other independent contracting
jobs, Dakota Leasing bids for contracts through competitive bids
which are advertised in the newspaper. If Dakota Leasing is awarded
a contract, they then subcontract the work to various subcontractors

GLAZE hasknown DICK WILSON for five or six years and they
are friends. Just before WILSON was to be inaugurated as Chairman
of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, WILSON called GLAZE and told him that he
was in trouble and needed some help. ROBERT ISHAM, President of the
First National Bank of Gordon, Nebraska, was in the process of
foreclosing on a loan for equipment which he had purchased from
an equipment company in Cheyenne, Wyoming, and the Chevrolet
dealership in Martin, South Dakota. The equipment was a back hoe,

a low boy, and a two~ton Chevrolet truck. GLAZE told WILSON that
he would try to locate a buyer for the equipment.

GLAZE contacted ERNIE BARTON at Barton Masonry in Rapid
City. BARTON told GLAZE if WILSON would bring the equipment to
Rapid City for BARTON to inspect, he (BARTON) would consider
purchasing the equipment. WILSON brought the equipment to Rapid
City and left it at BARTON's equipment yard. BARTON thereafter
decided to buy the equipment. BARTON went to the First National
Bank in Gordon, Nebraska, and paid off the loan on the equipment.
The equipment was then titled over to BARTON,

. GEORGE WILSON was involved in this equipment deal
but GLAZE is not sure to what extent. He believes-that the
sane equipment was in GEORGE WILSON's name and that the loan at the
First National Bank was also in GEORGE WILSON's name.

GLAZE has never received any money from the Oglala
Sioux Tribe or from DICK WILSON. The only money he receives
as a result of any work done for the Tribe is in the form of
commissions paid to him as a sales representative of the Dakota
Leasing Company. He located the buyer for the equipment which
DICK WILSON had as a personal favor to DICK WILSON.

GLAZE gave no cash donations to DICK WILSON during his
(WILSON' s) campaign for President of the Oglala Sioux Tribe. He
did assist him in the conduct of the election campaign by talking
with various ranchers who live on the Pine Ridge indian, Reservation,
South Dakota, and having them donate beef for "pow wows" held on
the reservation to help elect WILSON.

GLAZE has no knowledge of money being paid to DICK's
brother, JIM WILSON, for any type of consulting fees.

DICK WIESON is the best tribal chairman the tribe has
had in many years. DICK WILSON is not corrupt and is working for
the benefit of the tribe.

All of GLAZE's financial and tax records will be made
available to t'ie FBI by contacting A. C. THORSTENSON of Sayler,

Thorstenson, and Company, Certified Public Accountants, Rapid
City, South Dakota.

GERALD ONE FEATHER, Oglala Sioux Tribal Chief
prior to RICHARD WILSON, Box 298, Oglala, South Dakota
(telephone 867-5327), provided the following information:

_. Since RICHARD WILSON became president of the
Oglaita Sioux Tribe in January, 1972, ONE FEATHER has been
working with both the American Indian Movement (AIM) and the
Ogiaia Sioux Tribal Couneil in an effort to improve the criminal
justice system and the financial status of the Oglala Sioux
Tribe on the Pine Ridge Reservation.

ONE FEATHER suspects Chairman WILSON of many
wrongdoings since becoming chief of the Oglala Sioux Tribe,
but he has no direct proof or evidence which could be used
against WILSON in a court of law. Since WILSON became
president, he has suspended and fired many competent
people who were associated with the Tribal Council because
these people would not cooperate with WILSON in carrying
out various "deal" which WILSON was trying to do.

WILSGN suspended the Office of Economic Opportunity
(OHO) Headstart Director HATTIE TWISS, because she would not
cooperate with WILSON concerning the payment of approximately
ten to fifteen thousand dollars to WILSON's brother, JAMES
3. WILSON, for some type of consulting fees he received
through the Headstart program. TWISS can be Located at the
hospital in Gordon, Nebraska.

Since WILSON took office in January, 1972, the
books and records for the Oglala Sioux Tribe have not been
audited and according to several members of the Tribal
Council, the records which are currently being kept are
very inadequate.

During the ONE FEATHER administration, the
accommting firm of Thorstenson and Saylor in Rapid City
was vesponsible for auditing the books and records of the
Oglala Sioux Tribe. Aliso, an accountant named FRANCIS
KILLER, who lives in Vermillion, South Dakota, and whose tele-
phone number is 642-4963, was under a contract with the Tribe .
to do monthly accounting work for the Tribe. KILLER*s contract
with the Tribe expired in October, 1972, and WILSON would not

HATTIE TWISS, Rocky Fort Route, Porcupine, South
Dakota, was interviewed at the Gordon Memorial Hospital,
Gordon, Nebraska and provided the following information:

Dole of transcription,

She was Director for the Office of Economic
i Opportunity (OHO) Headstart Program until October, 1972,
at which time she resigned because of wrongdoings on the
part of RICHARD WILSON, President of the Oglala Sioux Tribe
(OST). WILSON was trying to get access to the Headstart
funds which she controlled but she would not allow him
access to the funds.

During the first part of October, 1972, she
became il] and had to go into the hospital for a week, When
sbe returned to work she discovered that WILSON had drawn
$14,000 from the Headstart account. There was no allowance
for this withdrawal at the Headstart project and WILSON
would not account for what the $14,000 was spent for. The
eheck that was written for the $14,000 bore HATTIE TWISS'
signature, but she did not sign the check, At this point,
she was fed up with the way WILSON was operating and
harrassing her, so she turned in her resignation.

She could furnish no details concerning the payment
of $10,000 to $15,000 to WILSON's brother, JANES WILSON;
however, FRANCIS KILLER of Vermillion, South Dakota has
the @tails surrounding this payment. KILLER was the
accountant for the OST at the time this disbursement was
supposedly made to WILSON's brother.

There has been much wrongdoing on the part of
DICK WILSON since he took office in April, 1972. He has
continuously attempted to gain control of the various OKO
funds, and used these funds for purposes which would not
benefit the Sioux people.

DAVE LONG, vice president of the OST, can furnish
additional information concerning wrongdoing on the part of
RICHARD WILSON,

and LEROY B, CATEL, CPA, partners in the firm of Sayler,
Thorstenson and Company, Certified Public Accountants,

a 810 Quincy Street, Rapid City (telephone 342-5630),
provided the following information:

The accounting services which Sayler, Thorstenson
and Company provide for the Oglala Sioux Tribe (OST)
are yearly audits of the following OST special programs:

1, Revolving Credit Fund - this fund borzows
money from the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and re-loans
this money to various tribal enterprises and indivduals;

2, Short Term Loan Program ~ this fund makes
small loans, usually less than $250, to individuals of
the OST;

3. Land Acquisition Enterprise - this fund
purchases land within the bowtidaries of the Pine Ridge
Reservation,

The last audit conducted on the aforementioned-
three funds was in June, 1972. The findings of all prior
audits of these funds has always resulted in either a
qualified or a disclaimer of opinion for the audit. The
primary reason shat all the audits have been qualified
and/or disclaimer opinions is because of the tardiness
of the recordkeeping of the above~three funds. However,
a full~scale audit has always been conducted and in this
capacity, the auditing standards and procedures which have
been utilized would bave uncovered any misappropriation,
fraud or embezzlement which might have been taking place
in these funds.

OST Chairman DICK WILSON has no control or for
that matter any influence over the above funds and because
of the nature of these funds and the checks and balances
which are placed upon these funds, it is not likely that
any irregularities might occur in these funds.

SUSAN PERRINE, Revenue Officer, Internal Revenue
Service (IRS), 520 Kansas City Street, Rapid City, provided
the following information:

Since the DICK WILSON administration came i;
power in April, 1972, the Oglala Sioux Tribe (OST) h:
conducted their businesswith the IRS in the most efficient
manner in many years.

to

The OST has a quarter payroll of appreximately
$400,000. In April, 1972, at the onset of the WILSON
Administration, the IRS conducted a payroll tax audit
of the OST as the OST had not filed a quarterly payrvuil
tax report for over a year prior to April, 1972. The
results of the IRS audit resulted in the OST being
assessed approximately $250,000 plus interest for back
payroll taxes prior to the period April, 1972.

WILSON was very cooperative with the IRS in
furnishing the payroll records for the tribe in order
that the audit could be efficiently conducted, The
records which WILSON furnished were maintained on a
computer system which was done by Sayler, Thorstenson
and Company, Certified Public Accountants, 810 Quincy
Street, Rapid City, South Dakota.

The OST is now on a weekly depositary systex
wherein they pay the exact amount of payroli taxes from
the special Office of Sconomic Opportunity (C#O}

___ AIM support of impeachment of President of Oglala
Tribe:

"RICHARD WILSON receives direct support from the
Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Department ot Interior and
AIM has made its goal and objective to oust the BIA from
interfering with tribal business, with governing tribal
business, running our business, dictating. This is what the
presidency ot the Oglala Sioux is doing right now. He's
dictating policy, he's didating procedures, laws, he has
total disregard for civil rights or treaty rights. As a
result of that we have taken a direct stand to oppose the
Bureau of Indian Affairs in their puppet Government on the
Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. 1 tnink that the Pine Ridge
Reservation, the people there, are very mucn dissatistied with
the puppet Government, the colonialistic Government that the
bIA has set up out there, and 1 think one of the reasons, or
course, °- that they have decided to call Alm tor support 1s
that they are being neglected, even by the tritai president.
Our stand wilt continue against the Government to oust them
from Indian attairs.

Future plans of ALM to Blas

“Aim is going to increase its activity against the
Government. We're going to increase our stand against colonialistic
Governments, we're going to increase our opposition to any of their
puppet dictators from coming to the reservation. I think that
this is primarily an area where the people in the east do not
understand how the tribal Governments work, that they're set up
by the Governmert and they are dictating policy. Just recently
as a matter of fact, in the past 30 days, the Cheyenne River
Sioux became very angry at this type of system and they voted
to challenge the districting of the Government in trying to
eliminate a lot of grass roots Indians, a lot of full~blood
Indians from the tribal council, and so the Cheyenne River Sioux
voted within themselves to challenge it and they won, and now
you have the Cheyenne River Tribal Council composed of at least
more than 75% of its members who are grass roots Indians, who are
full-bloods, and who are now going to try and dictate back to the
Government how they want this system to operate, and the Government
is very upset that the Cheyenne River Sioux took this stand and
of course, they did everything in its power to try and discredit

On February 14, 1973, source advised he had determined
that a caravan of about 340 people~drove to Sturgis, South.Dakota,
to attend the hearing of HAROLDAWHITE HORSE. When the caravan
arrived at the courthouse, they‘found that the building had
been blockaded with snowplows and elements of the South Dakota
State Patrol were present.

Discussions followed and about four or five American
Indian Movement (AIM) spokesmen were permitted inside the
courthouse. These included DENNIS BANKS, RUSSELL MEANS and
some of the news media. At this point a judge asked for the
identities of the news media representatives and upon
not identifying themselves, the judge ordered the press outside
the courthouse, stating that they exaggerate, cause ill feelings
and increase bitterness.

The source determined that bond for WHITE HORSE
was reduced to $15,000 and that AIM considered it to be a
successful operation.

After the hearing, the caravan returned to Rapid
City, South Dakota, where about 40 Indians were being "tried"
concerning distruction of taverns which had occurred on an
earlier date. Following this trial, source determined that
approximately one half of the Indian cases were dismissed
ae the remainder of the persons were put on probation to
Indians.

Meetings were held in Rapid City, South Dakota,
on February 12, 1973, which concerned, in part, attempts to get
the American Indian Movement commission to operate. Rapid
City spokesman noted that AIM demands could be met if no more
Indians arrived in town and if the non-local Indians left town.
DENNIS BANKS stated that under no conditions would AIM
be intimidated either as a group or on an individual
basis. He stated that "We are staying." .

On February 13, 1973, the Indian caravan started for the
Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota to attend impeach-
ment proceedings against REGHARD fueLson, Chairman of the Oglala
Sioux Tribe. WILSON is described. as an arch énémy of the ~~~
Améritan” Indian Movementa. The sotirce advised that WILSON is
being impeached by the tribal council who had invited the
American Indian Movement to witness the proceedings. WILSON
is reported to have stated that with respect to AIM that
he will "shoot 'em on sight." Following the impeachment
proceedings, AIM was to be given a buffalo by the tribal
council for there use in thier upcoming victory dance.

organization for AIM and whose primary activity in the future
would be fund raising. Source further advised that the leader-

along the top eight leaders. Source stated that he was
instructed by DENNIS BANKS through CARTER CAMP to proceed

to Houston, Texas, on February 23, 1973, via Oklahoma City.
Source advised that CAMP would ride with him as far as Oklahoma
City where he would remain until the source returned from
Houston, Texas. He stated he was instructed by CAMP to
contact Doctor MELVIN D,KSIKES, JR., Professor of Educational
Psychology, University of Texas.at Austin, Texas... He was to
meet SIKES on February 24, 1973. He advised he was unaware

of the reason for meeting with SIKES, however, it was indicated
to him that he was to pick up something from SIKE. d return
to Nebraska where he would turn it over to Conse,

a Chicano, who is active at Scottsbluff, Nebraska, and Rapid
City, South Dakota. He stated-that~he would meéf MARTINEZ

at Lincoln, Nebraska, on February 27, 1973. °

Source added that AIM intends to impeach RICHARD WILSON
from his job as the Tribal Council President after which he
will probably be murdered. He advised that WILSON would not
be harmed prior to impeachment as AIM would not have the
sympathy of the other Indians on the reservation.

Source stated two cases of guns had arrived at a
small landing field near Steamboat Rock and DeValley. northwest
of Rapid City, South Dakota. He did not know what became of the
guns or who paid for them. He advised that DENNIS BANKS had
received $1,500 contribution from someone in Canada and that
other funds for AIM in Rapid City through church contribution
and small contributions from AIM members and sympathizers in
Rapid City and Custer, South Dakota.

Source advised that he had heard that a confrontation
would take place in the near future in Tueson, Arizona, to
protest the slaying of a 16-year old Indian youth by Arizona
Police.

Charles Merrillon March 11, 1973 at Wounded Knee, South Dakota
on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, While the case is docketed
in the South Dakota District, it was scheduled to be tried,
because of a prior change of venue, at the United States Court
House in Council Bluffs, Iowa. However, pre-trial motions were
scheduled for thursday, February 27, 1975 in Rapid City, South
Dakota before Judge Andrew W. Bogue. : :

+ || itn order to prepare for the trial scheduled for March 3, 1975
and the motion scheduled for February 27, 1975 I went out to
Council Bluffs on Monday, February 24, 1975 to meet with the
resident attorney _ and legal workers who had been doing backround
work on all of the cases resulting from the Wounded Knee events
of two years earlier and also to meet my prospective client,
the defendant Mr. Escamilla. In Council Bluffs I spent two
days of: intensive work with Martha Copleman, a member of the
New Jersey Bar and with Katherine James, a legal worker, both
of whom had done a great amount of preliminary preparation for
_the Escamilla case as well as other "Wounded Knee" cases, I

also met with Mr. Escamilla for the first time, I determined

that in order adequately to prepare for trial it would be highly

advisable for me to visit the scene of the alleged events at |

Wounded Knee and also to have further investigative work done |

on the Pine Ridge Reservation, 1 was told by Ms. Copleman
; and Ms. James that a lawyer and a legal worker were available
on the Reservation ‘to do this investigative work. I happen
‘also to be a pilot holding a commercial pilot license and
accordingly determined to rent a plane at Council Bluffs on

: ; laa
Wednesday, February 26 and fly up to Rapid City with Gio

_. a
dant ands, Copleman Yand Ms.

8), with a stop at Pine Ridge

which has an airport on the way from Council Bluffs to Rapid
City where we would meet with the local attorney and legal
worker and view the scene of the events at Wounded Knee.

'5, Accordingly on Wednesday, February 26, 1975 I rented a
Cherokee Six from James Niebur, the owner or manager of the
fixed ‘base operator at the Council Bluffs Airport. We took
off from Council Bluffs at 10:50 A.M. Central Daylight Time
that morning and after stopping for fuel at Ainsworth, Nebraska
landed at Pine Ridge at approximately 1:45 to 1:50 P.M, Mountain;
Daylight Time. “There we were met by Roger Finzel who I ender
stood is a member of the Bars of Washington, D.C, and South
Dakota and Eda Gordon, a legal-worker, both.of whom I under- |
stood were working on the Pine Ridge Reservation on behalf

of WKLDOC. Ms. Gordon left us for a time and Mr, Finzel drove

NW 68262 Docld:32989686 Page 401

Mr. Escamilla, Ms. Copleman, Ms. James and myself to Wounded
Knee, about 17 miles away, where we spent sometime over an hour
walking and driving around the scenes where the 1973 events ~
were alleged to have occurred, Ms. Gordon rejoined us at
Wounded Knee and the six of us then drove back in Mr, Finzel's
eax with Mr. Finzel driving to the airport at Pine Ridge.

When we arrived there we found that the airplane which I had
rented was riddled with bullet holes. J made a‘hurried inspec~
tion of the airplane and. found mul tiple holes in the windows

on the right side and marks on the right wings and fuel tanks
located therein, I decided that the airplane should not be
flown until its air worthiness was determined by a competent
certified aviaton mechanic. Accordingly we loaded our baggage
including numerous legal files which we had brought along for
preparation of the pre-trial motion scheduled the next day

in Rapid City, into Mr. Finzel's car with the intention of firs:
reporting the damage to the airplane to the local police in
person and to Me. Niebur by telephone and then driving to Rapid
City. The car was an Oldsmobile convertible, two door, approxi-
mately nine or ten years old. Mr. Finzel was in the driver's
seat, I was in the right front and between us was Ms. Gordon.
Immediately behind me Mr. Escamilla, with Ms. Copleman

jm the left rear and Ms. James in the middle.



We started to drive out of the airport but before reaching the
road (which I believe runs from Pine Ridge toward Wounded
Knee) where we intended to make a left turn toward Pine Ridge,
our way was’ suddenly blocked by a car which pulled up in front
of us, At the same moment ten or fifteen other cars pulled
into the airport entirely blocking us on all sides. it being
very cold our windows were closed and as the car which immediate
ly blocked us came to a stop: I saw a man get on the front hood,
facing us and pointing a shotgun at us. Mr. Finzel said to
lock the car which we did‘and we were approached on both sides
by several men. Almost inmediately there was a crowd of about
thirty men around us.’ One of the first men to emerge from the
cars which had pulled up was a man identified to me by, and
known to, all of the other occupants of our car, as Richard
wilson, the Tribal Chairman of the tribal Government on the
Pine Ridge Reservation whom I recognized from pictures of him
which I had seen in a publication entitled "Voices from Wounded
Knee 1973" published in 1974 by AKWESASNE NOTES, Mohawk Nation,
via Rooseveltown, New York 13683, ISBN 0-914838-01-6,

Library of Congress Catalog Number 7482402, ‘The men who came
up to the left side of the car shouted “open up". Mr. Finzel

asked them what they wanted. They said they wanted to talk.

68262 Docld:32989686 Page 402



o: en

Mr. Finzel said "you can talk through the closed door and I
can hear you", At this moment at least two men started slashing
through the roof of the convertible with knives and in’ a very
few seconds xipped off the entire roof of the car. As that
happened I unlocked the door on my side and I believe Mr. Finzel
did the same on his side. The.men on the front of the car on
the left side then said to Finzel that he had been involved _
in some incident at the court house in Pine Ridge (which I
later learned had taken place at the very time that ae were.
at Wounded. Knee’ some 17 miles distant). Finzel said "you can
ask Dick Wilson, he knows I wasn't there". At this point
Wilson came over and Finzel said to him words to the effect
"you know I wasn't at the court house’ today", Wilson did not
xeply to Finzel but said to the men next to him "stomp on him",
with’ that at least two men got on the hood of the car and kick-
‘ed ‘in’ the windshield and at least two men got on the back of
the car and kicked in the back-window. ‘The men up front started
to kick Finzel in the head, Ms. Gordon tried to protect Finzel
and she also was kicked in the head. The men on the left tried
to drag Finzel out of the car through the left side and were
“unable to do so and then they and/or others pulled at him from ;
; the right and in the course of this I was forced out of the
car and hit and kicked. When the events started I had a legal |

attache! -

eae in my hand and this was still in my hand when I got out
of the car. I started to walk toward the rear of the car and
say Wilson at the same time. that I was being shoved, hit, kicked
_and pushed by another man. I called to Wilson, "are you in
charge here?" hoping to tell him that I was a lawyer doing work
in connection with a case and to prevail upon him to stop the
vidlence. Wilson did not reply but made a motion to the man
who had been shoving me, upon which the man kicked and hit me
again and mocked me into a ditch at the rear of the car which
was covered partly with mud and partly with ice. This man
Ee said "you wait over there and they'll get you latex". When I”
got up from being mocked into the ditch I saw Mr. Escamilla on
the ground on the right side of the car being kicked by several
men. After several minutes more during which time Mr. Escamilla
and Mel Finzel'! continued to be beaten a somewhat older man,
san Indian,. motioned Mr. Finzel: and Mr, Escamilla to get back
into the car and I came back across the ditch and was allowed’

to get in. Mr, Finzel.. was too injured to drive and Mr.

Escamilla got into the drivers seat, The car: which had been
blocking us moved out of the way and we were allowed to leave
the scene. As we left we heard shouts of "get off the reserva-
tion" and "don't you ever come back". Mr, Escamilla drove and 4

we left the Reservation as fast as we could. Because of. the cold

we could not drive the totally open car all the way to Rapid
City and we eventually stopped at a place which is unknown to
me where the others arranged to get two other cars with
drivers who drove us to the Rapid City Regional Hospital in
Rapid City where we arrived at approximately 10:00 P.M, local
time. While still in Mr. Tinzel'3 . car I was seated in the
right front seat with Ms. Gordon in the middle. ,1 observed

one of her hands

ing badly and gave her my handkerchief to
wrap around it, JI was later told that her hand rn ar when one
o£ the men who attacked us at Pine Ridge was cutting Mr. Finzel"s
«hair with a knife and Ms, Gordon tried to stop him.

6. .At Rapid City Regional Hospital the four of us who had been
injured, Me. Finzel,.. Ms. Gordon, Me. Escamilla, and mysel£
checked into the emergency room where we were each examined

by physicians. Iwas feeling great pain in the left shoulder
which had begun to swell, ' I was also feeling great pain in

the right knee and was finding it difficult to walk. I also
had pain in the right thumb, the neck and ‘the lower back.
Multiple x-rays mere taken of all these sites of complaint and
fortunately no fractures or dislocations were found, All of

us except Mr, Escamilla were released from the hospital that
night, with Finzel... and myself being given medicine for pain

relief and Iwas given a sling for my left arm, Mr, Escamilla

remained in the hospital at least until Friday, February 28,1975.|
The xest o£ us went to the J !-Alex’ Johnson: Hotel .in Rapid «
City where we spent the night.

_7. The next morning, Thursday, eee 27 I woke up feeling
‘great pain in the left showlder,being barely able to move the
left arm and also found it extremely difficult to walk since
my right knee would barely support me. I had had an athlecié-
injury to this knee in July 1971 and had an operation for the
xemoval of the médial ministus in August 1971. The beating
which I had received at Pine Ridge evidently re-activated this
old injury site. The five of us, other than Mr, Escamilla,
went that morning to the United States Court House in Rapid
City and gave full statements to agents of the Federal Bureau
of Investigation who told us that they would “investigate the
matter", We asked that Wilson be arrested but got no response
other than the promise to investigate. Ms. Copleman, Ms. James |
and I also accompanied two agents of the F.B.Ij te the Repid
City Regional Hospital where they interviewed Mr. Escamilla

in our presence and took a full report from him as to the events
that occurred the preceeding day. That same day we also went
before Judge Bogue in connection ‘with Mr. Escamilla's case,
Judge Bogue adjourned the pre-trial motion to March 19, 1975 in

Rapid City and the trial to March 24-in Council Bluffs, Iowa,

8. Also-on February 27 I telephoned Mr. Niebur to advise him
what had happened to the airplane. {I said that I did not think
it would be safe for Him to go to Pine Ridge with a mechanic
unless he had protection of law enforcement officers. Later
in the day he called me and told me that he: had arranged to :
fly on Friday, February 28 with a mechanic in another airplane
and that officals of the Bureau of Indian Affairs BTA, herein-
after)had arranged to meet him there and afford the required

protection, I spoke to Mr, Niebur on the telephone on Saturday,

March 1 and he told me that he had retrieved the plane.which -

was £lyable although the right gas tank had been punctured and

was leaking. He also told me that during the time he was at
the Pine Ridge Reservation Airport no one from the BIA showed
up and he was surrounded by a hostile crowd who jeered him for
renting the airplane to me, He told me that he got off as
quickly as he could, being in fear for his own safety.

9. I left Rapid City for homeearly Friday morning February 28

via North Central Airlines and United Airlines to Minneapolis

and La Guardia Airport in New York, As of the time of this affi/

ddavitss; I still have considerable pain, swelling and hematoma

jn the left shoulder with restriction of motion and continued

pain. in the right knee with continued atsttouley in walking,

‘although both injuries are improving.

10. While I personally viewed the area at Wounded Knee where
events of two years aeo were alleged to have taken place, I

do not feel that I have adequately completed the investigation
‘which I need for the trial of Mr. Escamilla in which I represent
him. Nothing’ on earth could pursuade me to return to the Pine
Ridge Reservation to do any further investigation nor would I
ask anyone else to undertake the necessary investigation in

Mr. Escamilla's case or any other case. From what I witnessed
on February 26, 1975, I believe it would be a long time before
it is safe to carry on any investigative activities for "Wounded
Knee" defendants whose cases are still awaiting trial. I was
offered a personal escort of marshals. for myself ofan investi-
gator: by Judge Bogue, but it seems obvious that any adequate
‘investigation can not be done in any law case when the investi-

gator himself is accompanied by a team of armed law enforcement

MONA MONTGOMERY advised that on February 26,
1975, she rode from Porcupine to Pine Ridge, South
Dakota, in her own 1963 red Nova, a four door car.
WILMA POOR BEAR, who is the same as WILMA COLHOFF drove
the car for her. The van which had been with her group
had left Porcupine and went to Pine Ridge ahead of them.
Upon arriving at Pine Ridge they went to the home of
ale mother and then to the courthouse where they saw
a fracas.

MONICA, whose Last name she thinks is CISCERRNOS
(phonetic), her son SHANE, age 2, and some other women
were in the car with she and WILMA.

At the Pine Ridge Airport the van, her car, and
' WEBSTER POOR BEAR's pickup truck were all there. When
her car pulled into the airport, WEBSTER told the occupants
of her car to get the hell out of there. She saw no plane
ae airport and said she had heard no shots fired at
all.

MONTGOMERY said she will not sign any statement,
that she does not want to talk about AIM, and does not
want to have anything to do with any hearings. She said
that this just is not relevant to the assault on her.

She also said there were no weapons in her car whatsoever.

MONTGOMERY advised that when her car left the
Pine Ridge Airport they drove through a bunch of goons
by a turn-off past the airport, drove onto the top of a
hill and stopped to see what was happening. She saw a
rust colored car back up out of a driveway and try to
stop the van. She again said she heard no shots and saw
nothing else, and her only concern was for her son.

: MONTGOMERY said the night before the stabbing she
was at DICK MARSHAL's house together with RUSSELL MEANS,

7 ‘WEBSTER and TOMMY POOR BEAR, BILL MESTETH, MARSHAL and

t KENNY KANE. TED MESTETH was also with the group. She does

not know DU BRAY or RED COLOMBE (phonetic).

She stated that when her car got back to
Wounded Knee after leaving Pine Ridge, all she did was
get out and check the oil in her car. She does not know
anything about a white car which was with her group.
She has no idea as to why the group even went to Pine
Ridge. She herself went in just to wash some clothes.
She said she has no idea as to how many cars went from

MARSHAL's to Pine Ridge. She did not see anyone with
guns.

She does not know what time the group went to
Pine Ridge or who all went. Then she said that her car
went to Pine Ridge long before the others left Porcupine.
She does not know why the occupants of her car went to
the Tribal Courthouse. WILMA just went there.

At the courthouse she and WILMA tried to use the
bathroom, but could not get in so they went to the nearby

jail. At the jail no one would let them use the bathroom
there.

At this point MONTGOMERY said she had a severe
headache and asked to leave. She said she prefers not
to talk to the FBI again. She stated that WILMA is now
living in Rosebud and she herself stays with her mother

“Pine Ridge, S.D.
March 5, 1975

"I, John Wallace Means, make the following voluntary
statement to J. Gary Adams and Frederick Coward Jr who
have identified themselves as Special Agents of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). I am aware that
I am being interviewed in regard to the incidents which
occurred on February 26, 1975 at Pine Ridge, S.D. I
am 27 years of age, having been born June 10, 1947 at
Pine Ridge, S.D. I have had 12 years of education. I can
read and write the English language. No promises or
threats have been made to me and no pressure or coercion
of any kind has been used against me.

“Between 2PM and 3PM on Wednesday, February 26,
1975, I was driving a green Ranger pickup, 1974 Ford,
back to Pine Ridge, S.D. Seth Hernandez was with me.
I heard over the 2-way radio in the pickup that Duane
Brewer was at the Court House alone and there were several
American Indian Movement (AIM) guys there also. Fluff
Bettelyoun was calling someone else with this message.
I was just leaving the planning center when we heard this
message. :

"I drove to the BIA parking lot and parked directly
across from a green van parked in the street facing west
on the south side of the street. This van had a vent

door on top which was open.
21



"When I arrived there were several people standing
around. I recognized Russell Means, my cousin, Ski
Jacobs, Duane Brewer, standing around. My brother Popo Means
and sister, Irene Brewer, were sitting in Duane's
car. Hernandez and I sat in the pickup.

"We sat in the parking lot about 15 minutes
and left and went to the ONAP office. We were there a
couple minutes and started back to the BIA parking lot.
As we passed the tribal cafe, we met the same van that
was previously parked by the court house. This van was
headed east on hwy 18, I don't recall any of the
vehicles following the van.

"I observed Duane Brewer following the van some
distance behind the van. Manny Wilson and Popo Means
were with Duane. I turned around and followed everyone.

“When I approached the airport driveway off Hwy
18, I observed this same green van parked near the first house.
The back doors were open and I observed approximately
20 to 25 people around the van and some 6 other cars in
the area. I observed one individual, a foreign Indian

"I observed Duane's car parked in the approach to
Donna Mae Pourier's place. The car was backed in. Alvin

Long Soldier's pickup was parked on the right hand shoulder.

Phil Bettelyoun's pickup, a light blue Ford, was parked

in front of Alvin Long Soldier's pickup. I pulled into

the ditch in the vicinity of these two pickups. We sat

in our pickup for several minutes and then got out when
Alvin said they were coming. This meant the people in

the van were coming our direction. I got out of my pickup
and got behind Fred Brewer's pickup, a green Chevrolet, which
was also in the area.

“The green van and about 5 or 6 other vehicles then
came east on Hwy 18. There were approximately 15 rounds
fired from 3 or 4 different guns. I was not hit and the
pickup I was driving was not hit.

"I got in my pickup with Hernandez and we started
back to Pine Ridge. Before leaving the area I had conver-
sation with Joe Big Crow and Alvin Long Soldier about how
close we came to getting hit. I got to the vicinity of
the large fenced in area, heading toward Pine Ridge, to
get some rifles. Roger Big Crow also was with us. We
didn't know where we were going to get the rifles so we
turned around and went back to the airport. We parked in
the ditch on the west side of the approach. I stood by
the pickup and was listening to the 2-way radio.

“After about 20 minutes Chuck Conroy and I went to
Batesland in Conroy's blue jeep. John Hussman and
Tom Conroy followed us. We were in Batesland about 10
minutes and started back to Pine Ridge. We met Bud Merrill

at the Wounded Knee turnoff of Hwy 18. We asked Merill

about a roadblock at Art Vitalis and a road block at

the Wounded Knee junction with the Manderson Road. Merrill
said there were no road blocks. Merrill also told us

about the airplane at the airport was shot up. We went to
the airport and looked the airplane over. I did not see
any bullet holes. Chuck Conroy told me there were some

in it though.

"Blaine White Eyes, Vince Brewer, Tom Conroy, Seth
Hernandz , Bogie Carlow, John Hussmanwere at the planning
center. I stayed at the Planning Center until 4:30 PM
and then went home.

3. Dispatch a group of U. S. Marshals (5 - 15) as
advisers to the-BIA police.

4. Send a group of Washington officials from the

to the reservation to interview people within the tribal

government and citizens to obtain an overall view of the

present situation, after which appropriate recommendations
will be made to the Congress.

5. Request Richard Wilson, elected tribal chairman,

of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, ea ada BIA officials,

and tribal leaders to meet in Washington, D. C., to discuss their
problems.

No specific requests were made of the Department of
Justice during this meeting.

Mr. Williem Hall of the U. S. Marshals Service stated
the U. S. Marshals Service was against any joint or unilateral
police action by the Marshals Service on the reservation. It
was pointed out by Mr. Kitch the U. S. Marshals Service
Special Operations Force is a trained unit of U. S. Marshals to
be utilized on a short-term basis and not to be committed for
any lengthy period.

Mr. Kitch requested comments concerning the FBI's

-position at which time it was pointed out to him the FBI's

function is investigative for the purpose of gathering intel-
ligence information and investigating eviminal violations
occurring on the Indian reservation and the FBI did not have
the resources or manpower to furnish a force to handle policing
of the Pine Ridge Reservation.

Mr. Ickes advised forthcoming elections for a new
tribal chairman at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation were
scheduled for the latter part of November and approximately
ten candidates would run in the primary, including present
tribal chairman Richard Wilson and AIM leader Russell Means.

Re: CONFERENCE, OFFICE OF DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL

is considered problems could develop during the elections.
Mr. Kitch instructed William O'Connor that he should offer
the expertise of the Civil Rights Division in the handling
of electoral matters to the BIA.

: Mr. Kitch recognized the situation on the Pine Ridge
Indian Reservation as an Interior Department problem, in which
the Justice Department had a secondary interest in that it was
required to investigate and prosecute violations of Federal law
on an Indian reservation. He indicated the Department should
put "heat on Interior" to pick up the policing of the Pine
Ridge Reservation and to fully utilize all of their facilities,
and the Justice Department should attempt to furnish technical-
assistance where necessary.

Attached is OST Resclution 72-55 dated 11-16-72 and Prest-
dent Wilson's letter of the same date, requesting our help to
imploment the terma of this Recolution.

As you can see, the Oglala Sioux Tribal Council is taking a
strong stand for adequate Law and Order Services here,’ They
expect the Bureau of Indian Affairs to protect the daily

funetiono of Tribal, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Public Health
Service and State business. The use of Oglalas in a way similar
to that of an auxiliary police force seeme to he the most likely
way of providing adequate Law and Order Services at this time.

In view of the strong stand of the Oglala Sioux Tribal Council
the Bureau of Indisn Affairs is certainly totally committed to
provide whatever financing, training and equipment in necessary
to protect the lives and business of the Oglala Sioux Tribe,

ECOFFEY theri went into the radio room and told
Dispatcher ORA JANIS to call Chief of Police SKEE JACOBS.
ECOFFEY advised that he had asked MESTETH if they tock his
gun and he answered "yes".

ECOFFEY advised that while he was in jail,
“everything was cool,'' there was no violence and no threats
were made to any of the Officers. While he was in the
Lieutenant's Office, he saw JOHN HUSSMAN picking up the
telephone whenever a call came in. He said he felt that
HUSSMAN was trying to listen in on each of the calls. He
akso saw BILLY VOCU and WILBUR BLACK FEATHER, JR. in the
radio room with ORA JANIS and it appeared to him that JANIS
was "very shaken.'"' He said that he also observed DICK
WILSON, TIM SHANGREAUX and "BAT" RICHARDS and quite a few
other individuals walking in and out of the Lieutenant's
Office. He said he could not remember all of them.

At about this time, WILSON, SHANGREAUX, RICHARDS
and a few others went downstairs to the cell block area.
ECOFFEY remained upstairs in the Lieutenant's Office for
about five or seven minutes and then he went downstairs to
get a cup of coffee and saw WILSON, SKEE JACOBS, and a few
others standing outside the women's cell, talking. He said
be did not hear what the conversation was about.

He said he saw BIA Officer BENNIE RICHARDS in
civilian clothes (light blue slacks and T~shirt) downstairs
near the kitchen and that he saw RICHARDS again a Little
while later and he was in his police uniform. He had no
idea what RICHARDS’ purpose was in being there, although.
he did advise that RICHARDS and many of the other officers,
when off duty, will come to the Police Department.

ECOFFEY advised that approximately 10 or 15 minutes
after WILSON went downstairs to the-cell block area, SKEE
JACOBS came upstairs and told him as well as the other officers
who were present, to go into SKEEZ's Office. He advised that
this group included Officers coming on duty as well as a few of
WILSON's men, including DICK WILSON. He heard WILSON say that
he had great respect for the Police Department and felt it was
about time something was done to help them. WILSON also said
something to the effect that he wanted some of his men to ride
with the Police Officers on their routine patrols. According
to ECOFFEY, WILSON did not demand this but requested it of both
SKEE JACOBS and NELSON WITT, who was also present, He thinks
there was something said about AIM Security riding with Officers,
but he could not recall exactly what was said. He never heard
any demands made by WILSON or any of his men.

received a phone call from his wife advising him that his
eight year old son had not yet come home from a friends
house and he then left to go look for his son. He said that

Criminal Investigator NATE MERRICK, who was also present during
the interview. WHITE TE EYES was advised of the official identity
of the interviewing Agent by display of credentials and was
advised of the native of the inquiry. He then furnished the
following information:

WHITE EYES advised that he was on regular patrol in
his police unit at approximately _ 10:50 p.m. when he saw six to
eight cars in a caravan driving from the east on Highway 18,
turn north and head toward the jail. ‘They parked on the east

. side of the courthouse, next to the road. He saw approximately
20 to 30 men get out of the cars and head toward the jail build-
ing.

:EEEEEEES He called fellow Officer HOBERT ECOFFEY on his police
radio and asked to meet with him. ECOFFEY told him to rendezvous
at the ballpark near the Oglala Commmity School. When he
arrived at the ballpark, both ECOFFEY and JESS TRUE BLCOD, also
a BIA Officer, were already there and ECOFFEY said that "there
might be trouble at the jail so kind of be aware and follow me."

When they arrived in front of the jail, he heard ECOFPSY
eall in on the radio to go out of service and he then immediately
did the same as did TRUE BLOOD. He did not hear any response and
he felt that it was unusual because the radio dispatcher generally
answers with a "10-4",

All three of them went into the jail and say all of the
cell doors open and did not see the jailer. They all went upstairs
and as he was climbing the stairs, he saw a male Indian carrying

pistol belt in his hand. WHITE EYES stated that he remembers
thinking at that time that "that's a police gunbelt.” He advised
he did not know the individual carrying the belt put deseribed hin
as approximately 5°10" tall, heavy set, in his 20s, with Long bushy
hair and light complexién. _He- stated that he would recognize this
individual if he saw him again.

He went into the radio room to ask what was going on q
and saw two guys standing around listening, so he did not ask but

of the Officers gunbelts but he did not know who it was and
did not give up his gunbelt. This question was not repeated
and the matter was apparently dropped. He saw DAN MESTETH
sitting at the Lieutenant's Desk and asked him in Sioux language
‘what happened to your gunbelt?" DAN answered, also in Sioux,
“they took it."

WHITE EYES advised that he waited around in the -
Lieutenant's Office for about 10 or 15 minutes (until shortly
after 11:00 p.m.) when SKEZ JACOBS, DICK WILSON, and some other
individuals came into the Lieutenant's Office and then they

MARVIN ALBERT STOLDTS, Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA)
Jailer, Pine Ridge, South Dakota, was contacted regarding an
incident on the evening of September 25, 1974, wherein RICHARD
WILSON, Oglala Sioux Tribal Chairman, "took over" the Pine
Ridge Jail, Pine Ridge, South Dakota.

STOLDTS advised that on September 25, 1974, he was
working a shift from 3:30 p.m,, September 25, 1974, to twelve
midnight, September 26, 1974. On September 25, 1974, at
approximately 10:30 p.m., Police Officer DAN MESTETH brought
in prisoner LEO WINTERS and prisoner MADELINE SIMONSON, He
advised he searched these prisoners and locked them in a jail
cell, logged them in his prisoner book, then turned around and
was confronted by a large group of men, He advised these men
had not come in from the front door as he was standing near
the front door. STOLDTS indicated that SPEC WILSON and BILLY
VITALIS were in the forefront of these men and that there were
approximately twenty to twenty-five men in this group. He
advised he was with DAN MESTETH and NATHAN ELK, a Deputy to
DAN MESTETH, and the three of them were told by an unrecalled
individual in this group that they wanted to talk to them
upstairs. : : :

He advised that on his way upstairs, an unknown
individual in this group relieved him of his mace which was
on his belt. He advised that as a jailer he does not carry
a sidearm or any other kind of weapon. He advised that SPEC
WILSON relieved him of his jail keys and he mentioned he had
his other BIA keys in his right boot,

STOLDTS indicated that upstairs in the Pine Ridge
Jail he observed several men in the radio room but could not
tell who they were. He advised he was jostled and pushed
into the Lieutenant's room by SPEC WILSON, BILLY VITALIS,

RICHARD WILSON asked DAN MESTETH for his gun and
DAN MESTETH handed his gun to RICHARD WILSON.

RICHARD WILSON announced to the group that he had
declared martial law and that everything was legal. WILSON
advised we were to remain calm. WILSON told LOUIE LEPT HURON
that he was the new jailer and told LOUIE LEFf HURON to release
all the prisoners. LOUIE LEFT HURON then took the keys to the
cells and went downstairs where the prisoners were lodged in
the cells.

WILSON said we were all under arrest.

WILSON was asked by someone in the group what was
going on and WILSON replied that when EASTMAN, JACOBS, and
TRIMBLE arrived, they would be placed in jail for a while.

STOLDTS advised that various individuals, unknown to
him, appeared to be guarding all exits. He advised he started
to go downstairs to get some coffee and an unknown individual
stopped him from leaving the building. He advised this individ-
ual is described as an Indian male, five feet eleven inches,

185 pounds, long hair, 25 years of age, and that he has seen
this individual on the Reservation before.

STOLDTS advised he was allowed to get a cup of coffee,
which he did, and then he went back upstairs.

STOLDTS advised that in the meantime, police officers

HOBERT ECOFFEY and JESSE TRUEBLOOD had come in to the Pine Ridge
Jail and were being held with the rest of the group. He advised
that TRUEBLOOD and ECOFFZY retained possession of their firearms.
He advised that RICHARD WILSON asked police officer HOBERT
ECOFFEY for his gun and ECOFFEY refused to hand his gun over
sO no more mention was made of it.

BDTS indicated at approximately 9:00 p.m.,
September 1974, he had secured all the cutside doors to the
Pine Ridge Jail (locked). He advised that approximately ten
minutes prior to this incident, he had gone to the bathroom
which bathroom is located near the East entrance to the Pine

locked and that two two by fours were in place on the inside of
this door, securely locking this door, He advised that police
officer BENNY RICHARDS in civilian clothes wearing levis and

a T-shirt had shortly before this come into the Pine Ridge Jail
and went upstairs and he suspected that BENNY RICHARDS is the
individual who removed these two by fours and allowed RICHARD
WILSON's men to enter the Pine Ridge Jail. He advised that
BENNY RICHARDS freely associated with RICHARD WILSON's men .
when they were in the Pine Ridge Jail. He advised he smelled
liquor on the breath of DELNO PROVOST and indicated that several
of these individuals had been drinking.

He advised that while he and the others were confined
to the jail by WILSON's men, DUANE BREWER followed HOBERT ECOFFEY
everywhere ECOFFEY went and ECOFFEY told BREWER to quit following
him around.

WILSON told us at one point that we were all incompetent
and that when he took over thére would be a new staff.

STOLDTS advised that at one point, just before JACOBS
, hs was @ownstairs and he ueard WiLSON mention to his
men "keep your weapons out of sight".

STOLDTS advised that subsequently, Police Chief "SKEE"
JACOBS talked to WILSON near the jail cell door to the women's
cell downstairs and that then JACOBS and WILSON came upstairs
and all the police officers and WILSON went in a room upstairs
where they held a discussion.

STOLDTS indicated that he and jailer FRED KILLS SMALL
and Deputy NATHAN ELK went outside this room while this discussion
teok place and waited, Subsequently, WILSON and DUANE BREWER
came out of the room and WILSON said "We'll see you fellows,
thanks for the cooperation."

WILSON and BREWER then left and JACOBS came out and
told everyone to return to their noxmal duties. STOLDTS
indicated that he observed that all his prisoners had been
released.

asked STOLDTS for a list of the prisoners that had been released
and a written statement of what had happened, and STOLDTS pre=
pared this for EASTMAN.

Ridge Dispatcher that a bad car accident had happened between
Rushville and Whiteclay, Nebraska, approximately half way so
he assisted ambulance driver ESSIE KIRK at this car accident.
We advised that CALVIN PULLIAM, BILLY PULLIAM, and DEBBIE
PULLIAM had been in this accident and that DEBBIE PULLIAM

4n exemination was made of a frame structure
belonging to RICHARD WILSON, which was located in a
sub-division known as East Ridge Housing. This building
exhibited evidence of having been partially destroyed by
fire with extensive damage to the interior of the structure.

There were no doors or windows existing in the
structure at the time of this examination.

Investigation in the interior of the building
revealed that the most extensive damage was in the southwest .
corner of the building. ‘This damage included the complete
destruction of cross timbers in the ceiling area of the
building, as well as extensive damage to the ceiling area,
Other parts in the interior of the building also exhibited
extensive damage, but this damage was semewhat Less than
that in the southwest portion.

Measurements were taken of the depth of charring
in various sections of the interior of the building and it
was readily discernible that the deepest charring was in
the Southwest portion of the house. Additionally, comparison
of depth of charring in various portions of the building
revealed lesser depth in descending portions leading away
from the southwest corner of the house.

Examination of the exterior of the house
revealed that the most extensive exterior damage to the roof
and outer walls was also in the southwest portion of the
building, Additionally, in the southwest exterior corner
of the house extensive charring was noted to the exterior
floor boards. This particular charring was not found on
any other exterior part of the building. :

Examination of the crawl space underneath the
house, as well as the electrical wiring, indicate that
apparently no electricity or gas was connected to the

building.

i Date of transcription, 6/11/73

BERL AKRES, Acting Director of Offica of Beonomic
Opportunity (GEO), Pine Ridge Airport, Pine Ridge, South Dakota
{telepuone 667-5931), provided tas following information:

On Mey 7, 1973, tne Executive Beard of the Oglala
Sioux Tribe (OST) appointed AKRES Acting O40 Director until such
tims that the O8f Tribal Council meets to select 9 parmanent
Director. AMES was appointed Acting Director after the Council
terminated the employment of LELAND BEARHEELS, because BEARASELS
never showed up Tor work. AKRES! regular position is that of
Director for the OS? Manpower Program.

Since February, 1973, BENNIE DUANE RICKARDS has been
vacaiving a bieweskly salary of $240.00, wnieh 1s payment from
the O80 Community Action Program (CAP) while under the title
of Administrative Assistant (020 Acsount 311-01} position to-
the Os0 Director.

RIGUARDS performs no duties for CEO waatsoever and
ile job deseription is Adminietrative Assistant to the O50 Directer
for waich he receives a bi-weekly salary. RICJARDS wee placed
in bis current position by Tribal Chairman, RICHARD WILSOH, and
former O80 Divector LELAND SEARHEELS. RICHARDS never showsd up
for work ab. the O80 offices and has never performed any duties
in any way comrected with the O50 or the position of Administrative
Assistant to the 620 Director. As Administrative Assistant,
RICHARDS! duties didé require that he spend ali of bis tima at
the ORG office, which is located at the Pine Ridge Airport.
RICHARDS! only function appears te bs toat of sitting in WILSON's
office veoding the newspaper and running errands for WILSON.

About two weeks age, AERES attempted to talk wito
WILSON concerning RICHARDS, but waen AXRES approached WILSON
and told him that RIGHARDS should be terminated from nis position
with the 020, WILSON did not reply to AERUS! statement, he
(WILSOH) jua& turned and walked away.

GENERAL INVESTIGATIVE DIVISION

This concerns situ'’ ion at Wounded Knee (WK) «; of
5/17/73. :

On 5/14/73, a house at Pine Ridge, South Dakota (SD),
owned by Dick Wilson, Oglala Sioux Tribal Council Chair-
man, was destroyed by fire with evidence of possible
arson, Del Eastman, head of Bureau of Indian Affairs
(BIA) Police, reported concentration of Hippie Type,
Indians and Chicanos at ranch of Frank Fools Crow near
Kyle, SD, which is site for meeting of White House
Delegation and Oglala Sioux Chief and Headsmen on
5/17/73. Eastman anticipated serving tribal eviction
orders on those individuals unable to give good account
of themselves, however, a Federal restraining order had
been issued preventing Eastman from serving eviction
orders at Fools Crow Ranch. Restraining order extends
through 5/20/73. White House Delegation was scheduled
to meet with Oglala Sioux Tribal Chairman Dick Wilson,
9:00 a.m., 5/17/73. Delegation will then proceed by
helicopter to ranch of Frank Fools Crow where meeting
will be held with Tribal Chief and Headsmen.

Chief Brand Inspector of SD identified hides of one
bull and five calves of the eleven hides or parts of
hides found inside WK as belonging to local rancher.
Radio station broadcast, Rapid City, SD, 5/17/73,
revealed possibility bonding firm from Florida would
pay $125,000 bond for American Indian Movement (AIM)
leader Russell Means who is presently confined in count:

another company which is a non Indian owned & operated company.

The company can not set the bid but can meet the bid.

“Wilson said he could not meet the price per ton of

the business and asked if there was some way he could get the

contract for gravel the IAT was then letting.

I told Wilson



NW 68262 Docld:32989686 Page 544

the only way he could gét the contract was to meet the bid
of the other companies.

"I did not know then but I have since found out
Wilson wanted the contract for Lakota Sand and Gravel Company
which I understand is owned by him. In talking to my son,
Bryan Brewer, I understood that Hills Material Company, Hot
Springs, SD, offered a bid of $7.50 per ton, delivered, for gravel
and Oral Sand and Gravel Company, Oral, SD, offered a like
bid. I also understand through Bryan that Wilsons bid was
approximately $11 or $12 per ton of gravel. Bryan told me
after that Wilson "took" the contract.

“At the above mentioned meeting with Wilson I suggested
Wilson go to IAT, Denver, Colorado, to--talk the matter over.
Wilson thereafter went with Jim Wilson & Bryan and Bryan told
me the Wilsons did not want to go into IAT after they arrived
in Denver and to the best of Bryans knowledge they did not go
into IAT. Bryan thereafter asked me what he should do because
Wilson was telling Bryan he (Wilson) was going to haul the
gravel and that's all there was to it. I told Bryan to go
ahead and let Wilson haul the gravel and that I would report

it to the FBI which I did.

“When I first contacted the FBI about the above
I also mentioned a $650,000 street improvement contract which
was to be let by the U. S. government. I told the agent I
contacted, John McCarty, that the money was intercepted by
Richard Wilson and James Wilson and deposited into a bank
in Gordon, Nebraska. I had no firm information as to that
allegation but it was more or less rumor which I wanted to pass
onto the FBI.
