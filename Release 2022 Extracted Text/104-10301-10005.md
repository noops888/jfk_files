ORGANIZATION OF THE OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR

Introduction

1, This Notice outlines the organization and functioning of the
Office of the Director, the responsibilities of its personnel, and the
handling of communications in and with that Office. The term Office of
the Director includes the immediate offices of the DCI, the DDCI, the
Executive Director, and all Assistants to the Director. The Office of
the Director will be able to provide prompt policy guidance, assistance
and responses to the needs of the operating components of the Agency if
procedures detailed in this Notice are followed.

Individual Responsibilities

2. The responsibilities of the DCI and the DDCI were set forth by
the President in a letter to the Director, dated 16 January 1962, which
is quoted in part as follows:

"...it is my wish that you serve as the Government's principal
foreign intelligence officer, and as such that you undertake, as an
integral part of your responsibility, the coordination and effective
guidance of the total United States foreign intelligence effort. As the
Government's principal intelligence officer, you will assure the
proper coordination, correlation, and evaluation of intelligence from

all sources and its prompt dissemination to me and to other recipients

as appropriate. In fulfillment of these tasks I shall expect you to
work closely with the heads of all departments and agencies having
responsibilities in the foreign intelligence field,

"In coordinating and guiding the total intelligence effort, you will
serve as Chairman of the United States Intelligence Board, witha
view to assuring the efficient and effective operation of the Board and
its associated bodies, In this connection I note with approval that you
have designated your deputy to serve as a member of the Board,
thereby bringing to the Board's deliberations the relevant facts and
judgments of the Central Intelligence Agency.

"As directed by the President and the National Security
Council, you will establish with the advice and assistance of the
United States Intelligence Board the necessary policies and pro-
cedures to assure adequate coordination of foreign intelligence
activities at all levels.

“With the heads of the Departments and Agencies concerned
you will maintain a continuing review of the programs and activities
of all U.S, agencies engaged in foreign intelligence activities with a
view to assuring efficiency and effectiveness and to avoiding
undesirable duplication.

“As head of the Central Intelligence Agency, while you will
continue to have over-all responsibility for the Agency, I shall
expect you to delegate to your principal deputy, as you may deem
necessary, so much of the direction of the detailed operation of the
Agency as may be required to permit you to carry out your primary
task as Director of Central Intelligence. "

3. The Deputy Director of Central Intelligence directs the detailed
operations of the Central Intelligence Agency, as well as being the CLA
member of the USIB as indicated above, Statutory authorities of the
Director have been delegated by him to the Deputy Director. In the DCI's
absence, the DDCI is Acting Director of Central Intelligence and Acting
Chairman of the USIB, and represents the DCI on all of the inter-agency
boards and groups on which the Director sits.

4. The Executive Director is responsible for over-all management of
the Agency and of the Office of the Director. He is charged with ensuring
necessary action by the proper component on decisions of the DCI and
DDCI, with responsibility for overseeing internal management, and for
ensuring coordination of component activities. It is the Executive Director's
responsibility to ensure that Agency components are kept advised of all
policy decisions or intra-governmental actions affecting them. All papers
requiring action on the part of either the Director or Deputy Director will’
be routed through the Executive Director. The Executive Director, as the
“Chief of Staff" of the Agency, acts for or in the absence of the DCI and
DDCI in exercising his directive and approval authority.

5. The Executive Assistant to the Director is responsible for prepar-
ing briefing papers and books for meetings attended by the DCI such as
the Special Group, the National Security Council, Committee of Principals
and the NSC Standing Group, and for advising the Executive Director of
the need for action, as may be required by deliberations of these or other
groups. He is responsible for keeping the Director and the DDCI advised
on a 24-hour bagis of all informational and intelligence developments,

for review and coordination of Agency relations with the press and other
public media, and of matters which might involve the public disclosure
or acknowledgment of any CIA activity, employee or publication, His
responsibility applies particularly to all contacts with members of the
press, and to requests by Agency personnel to engage in writing for
external publication or to give talks outside the Agency,

7. The Assistant for Coordination provides advice and assistance
concerning the coordination of foreign intelligence activities within the
intelligence community, and Agency relationships with other intelligence
agencies. Papers dealing with such matters will be routed by the
Executive Registry to the Office of the Assistant for Coordination prior to
action by the DCI or DDCI,

8. The Executive Secretary, United States Intelligence Board, is

of the Director and its Chief is responsible for the control and location
of all papers throughout the Office. The Registry is compartmented for
reasons of security to ensure proper handling of papers of all classifica-
tions and degrees of sensitivity. Any question concerning the clearances
of personnel to handle special classifications should be taken up with the
Chief of the Registry. All papers moving into and out of the Office of the
Director, whatever their classification, will be sent initially to the
Executive Registry for appropriate logging and so that control can be
exercised over their location. Consequently, papers should not be hand-
carried to any individual in the Director's Office but should be taken
directly to the Executive Registry. The Registry will ensure expeditious
handling with the precedence desired, The point is emphasized that
papers which are not processed in this manner may possibly be lost, or
create security problems.

matters affecting the immediate Office of the Director. These include,
