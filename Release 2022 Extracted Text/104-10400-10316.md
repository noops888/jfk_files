SUBJECT : Guidelines for Providing Information

to the House Appropriations Committee
Surveys .and Investigations Staff
Concerning Foreign Intelligence and
Security Services

1. Since members of the S&I Staff will be
talking with your Divisions in the near. future,
it may be worthwhile to review the guidelines as
to what may be said concerning relationships with
foreign liaison services. In the broad sense,
liaison services constitute both a source and a
method.

2. We are prepared to discuss the following:

a. The identification and responsibili-
ties of the liaison services. in a particular
area to the extent that we can draw on
sources other than information derived through
the established liaison relationship, i.e.
overt information ]
which will not endanger the source,

b. In further describing the liaison
services, we can provide information on the
objectives, key personnel, strength, budget

and methods of operations of services, provided

that such data will be drawn from open sources
and not from details of liaison
“arrangements with the services themselves.

c. Agency manhours and funds devoted to
liaison with the foreign services.

d. In the case of SIGINT liaison, further
details on such arrangements, including the
scope of funds and equipment provided to such
foreign services. :

d. We are prepared to provide general
comments on the degree of operational coopera-
tion with the Station. If technical support,
for example, provides a useful input, we can
state that the liaison service provides
technical support, using a qualifying adjective
to define, such as excellent, limited, etc.

3. We have no objection to the provision of
foreign intelligence reports based ‘on liaison with
such services. Source descriptions should be those
used in the disseminated report.

4. We will not make available details on
liaison arrangements, information on sources and
methods of such services which have been obtained
through liaison or jointly controlled sources or
other information which would reveal Agency sources
and methods or violate the trust on which the
official liaison relationship is based.

5. The S&I Staff approves close liaison
relationships and believes that these relationships
are cost effective.

Guidelines for Providing Information
to Congressional Oversight Committees on
Foreign Intelligence and Security Services

These guidelines take into account the fact thee
foreign intelligence and security. services, when acting
in connection with the Agency's official liaison with
them, constitute both a source and a method and thus
require the statutory protection accorded any other
intelligence source or method. The guidelines also
recognize that the duly constituted oversight bodies of
the Congress have expressed an interest in such services |
and in the general scope, nature and extent of the Agency's
relationships with them. The purpose of these guidelines
is to provide a formula for dealing with these two

- sometimes conflicting objectives.

The Agency is prepared to provide, upon specific
request, appropriately classified and sanitized information
to oversight committees on the following aspects of
foreign intelligence and security services:

a. ‘the identification of the governments with
whose services CIA has liaison arrangements;

b. Agency man hours and funds devoted to
liaison with foreign services;

c. In the case of SIGINT liaison, further

details on such arrangements, including the scope of



13-00000 ' ‘

&

funds and equipment provided to such foreign services;
d. Information on the objectives, key personnel,

strength, budget and methods of operation of such services,

provided that such data will be drawn from open sources

and not from the details of liaison

arrangements with the services themselves;
e. Where relevant, foreign intelligence reports
based on liaison with such services.

a ; The Agency will not make. available to the oversight
conmittees the details of liaison arrangements with
foreign. services, information on sources and methods of .,
such services obtained through liaison or jointly
controlled sources, or other information which would
reveal Agency sources or methods or violate the trust on
which these official liaison relationships is necessarily
based.

In the event of substantial allegations of improper
activities conducted by foreign intelligence or security
services with which the Agency is presumed to maintain
liaison, every effort will be made to provide all relevant
facts which bear on such allegations. Where this would

i involve departure from the above guidelines, the Director
will be prepared to mcet with the Chairman or Vice-Chairman

' of the committee to seek a satisfactory resolution of such

problems. ae

Dear Mr. Siaats:

* My attention has been directed to a oe Mr. Keller, General
Accounting Office, to the Honorable William Proxmire dated May 10, 1974,
_Which wes > placed in the Congressional Record by Senator Proxmire on
February 11, 1975,> The letter deals with the intelligence community and «~.:
reviews the General Accounting Office's" right 1 to audit and obtain information"
from _ Central Intelligence Agency

* Inasmuch as Mr. Keller has treated : a Brae basic to this Agency" Ss
capabitiny to carry out work mandated by Congress, I believe it would serve’
: a@usefal purpose to review some of the background concerning the use of
confidential funds and their relationship to the audit of CIA over the Years.

.. Mr. Keller notes in ‘his lettey*that there are "a fairly substantial number
of instances where expenditures are accounted for solely upon a cerfification
: . by the head of the department or establishment involved." The need is clear

: im the case of this Agency. The necessity to safeguard certain truly vital

foreign intelligence secrets has been recognized by the Congress in its
- direction to the Director of Central Intelligence-td protect intelligence sources
and methods from unauthorized disclosure.’ This responsibility. was complemented
by authorizing certain expenditures "for objects of a confidential, extraordinary,
or emergency nature," to be accounted for solely on the certificate of the Director
of Central Intelligence. Such expenditures-would apply, for example, to a
secret agent operating abroad in.a hostile climate whose identity must be pro--
tected not.only so that he can continue supplying the intelligence involved, but
-2lso because his freedom~-and-on gepagion his Reicha eae oe the Eaaeee

eee “Other intelligence activities do not haye such obvious: sécurity re if
ments, but are, nonetheless, within the sources and-methods concept. Liaison
with foreign intelligence and security agencies is extremely important in fields of
both positive intelligence and counterintelligence. Such liaisons to be effective

. depend on the confidence of each service that the other will protect not only the
mere fact of the relationships, but also its‘sources and methods andi sensitive
information. Compromise of any of these brings not only protests from the foreign
liaison service, but i in some cases a lessening or even cessation of its coo; eration.

Th is igaea f Special protection of intelligence sources and methods has
been well recognized by officials in the executive, judicial, and legislative
branches of our Government. Mr. Lindsay C. Warren, then Comptroller General
of the United States, in a letter dated March 12, 1948, to the Director, Bureau of .
the Budget, addressed the provision granting the Director of Central Intelligence
the power to certify the expenditure of confidential funds by stating that while it
provided "for the granting of much wider authority than I'would ordinarily
recommend for Government agencies, generally;. the purposes sought to be
obtained i in the establishment of the Central Intelligence Agency are believed to.

"| bé of such paramount importance as to justify the extraordinary measures pro-

posed therein." He went on to-say that the "necessity for secrecy in such matters

is apparent and the Congress apparently recognized this fully in that it provided
in section. 102(d).(3).of Public. Law: 253, that the.Director of Central Intelligencé
‘shalt-bée responsible. fo: Protecting intelligence sources and methods.
unauthorized disclosure.” - Under these conditions, he stated;
called upon, to object to the Proposals advanced

: has been and it remains the policy of CIA to rely upon vouchered funds

. ‘wherever possible. (Vouchered funds are those which can be accounted for and -
‘- audited in conformance with the laws that apply to other Government agencies.

and with standard Government regylations and procedures.) Currently more

--. than half of the Agency's appropriations are disbursed as vouchered funds.

The confidential funds certification authority referred to by Mr. Warren in his.

March 12, 1948 letter is reserved for "objects of a confi Soe ale

or emergency nature." ane z

From the beginning of CIA records for ait'vouchered fund expenilitures
‘were made available to and were subject to a voucher audit by the GAO. Use of
~" the voucher audit procedure allowed the GAO to examine expenditure and :

. collection vouchers and related documents to determine whether expenditures
, Were made’ legally and solely for the objects for which appropriations were made.
Use of the voucher audit procedure also allowed CIA to protect those activities of
a confidential, extraordinary, or emergency nature, i.e., intelligence sources

and methods.

: bseqi GAO adopted ce
comprehensive audit approach," ‘and raised with the CIA Subcommittee of the

House Armed Services Committee the desirability of an expanded audit of Agency ~

* activities. The Comptroller General stated by letter dated May 29, 1959 to

. Subcommittee Chairman Kilday that he did "not recommend any change in section 10
(now section 8) of the Central Intelligence Act" and that "any broadening of our

audit activities should not include an evaluation of the intelligence activities of

the Agency." 5 ‘

should expand its current audit activities in a letter to the Comptroller dated ce
October 16, 1959, cautioning, however, that the comprehensive audit would have--
to be limited so as to remain outside the area of sensitive security operations for
which by law the Director’ 's certificate must be deemed a sufficient voucher.

- “The results of the trial period of comprehensive audit from 1959 | to 1962

were radeJmown to the CIA Subcommittee in a letter of May 16, 1961 from the
- Comptroller General in which he said the.GAO planned to discontinue the audit _
of CIA activities, He acknowledged that various steps were taken by the CIA "to
plece the General Accounting Office in a position to make a comprehensive audit —
of the overt activities of CIA." Nevertheless, he stated that GAO "cannot effectively
review and evaluate activities of the Support Component because the confidential
and overt activities of this component are integrated, to such an extent that we
cannot make reasonably comprehensive audits." He further stated "we have been .

sensitive and nonsensitive operations of CIA. bd E :

Chairman Vinson replied to the Comptroller General on ‘ely, 18, 1962,

ee DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL —
WASHINGTON, D.C 20505 7

REVIEW STAFF

The Honorable Otis G. Pike, Chairman
, Select. Committee on Intelligence
ae House of Representatives
u Washington, D..C. 20515

Dear Mr. Chairman:

: In our conversation on Friday you asked for the statutory
basis. for the compartmentation principle. — I wish first to
respond to your inquiry and then suggest a manner-in which your

’ staff can receive access to the sensitive material Beeeece
_ by special compartmentation systems. : : Sates

- The current basis’ for the U.S. Government security
o°. Classification system is Executive Order 11652, promulgated
-.on 8 March 1972. Historically, foreign intelligence. has
:. been treated as. one category of classified national security
. information. There are numerous.statutory recognitions of
-:. the importance of national security information, e.g., the eit
+... Freedom of Information Act... Consequently, much foreign Scenes:
“ intelligence is classified CONPIDENTIAL, SECRFT or TOP.
SECRET according to. specifications sét forth in-the Order.
- Not‘all foreign intelligence, however, is classified national
‘security information under-the provisions of the Executive
: Order (e.g., an American-source providing foreign information
] lor assistance). Also, the potential visks attendant with
.|-"+ the compromise of a foreign intelligence. source or method
i{..- differ substantially from-the risks attendant with much .
' Classified defense information.

“Section 102(d) (3) of the National Security Act of 1947,

as ey provides: "That the Director of Central Intel-’
i “ligence shall be responsible for protecting intelligence
sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure:" In
reccgnition of this responsibility, National Security
Council Intelligence Directive No. 1 (17 February 1972)
instructs the Director of Central Intelligence to,

",..develop and review security standards and practices-as
they relate to the protection of intelligence and of .
intelligence sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure.”



2- eC
Since the National Security Act did not provide for an authority
corresponding with the DCI's responsibility in this area,

the Directive provides that the Members of the U.S. Intelligence
Board are responsible for: "The supervision of the dissemination -
and security of intelligence material."’ The Director of Central
Intelligence, acting with the advice of the U.S. Intelligence
Board, has ‘promulgated a-number of directives, regulations
and security manuals:,.:related to the protection of foreign
intelligence and foreign intelligence sources and methods,
and erseee te to. the overall U.S. intelligence community.

-” The fundamental security: principle involved in the pro- i

“is a strict. application of "need to know”: --a principle
‘xeferred to in Exectitive Order 11652, Section 6(A).. This = -
applies the simple mathematical premise that the fewer the
number of individuals made. privy to a secret, the less Likely
‘that it will. be disclosed.:..The security principle of
“compartmentation" involving. special access and information
dissemination controls.is designed to ensure that only those
individuals whose "need ‘to know" has been specifically
pproved by some higher. authority, who have been specially
ndoctrinated, and who undertake special commitments to
rotect it are provided acéess to a particularly" sensitive
= category of foreign intelligence sources and. methods.
“Compartmentation assists in the application of the "need-to-
know" principle by ensuring that individuals .are. provided
{access to only that information clearly essential to the
Labianechanctane of their duties. . ‘ .

: Compartmentation was” undoubtedly. a najor contributing
factor involved in the nation's secret development. of ‘the

- atomic.bomb during World War II, and the principle is still
implicit in security procedures related to. ERDA’s “RESTRICTED ©
DATA" as reflected in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. In the ©
‘field of U.S. foreign intelligence activities, compartmentation-
was practiced throughout the development and operation of the
U-2 reconnaissance program. One of the major foreign
intelligence categories of activities using formalized com-
partmentation procedures today involves the matter of
foreign signals intercept for intelligence purposes, i.e.,
communications intelligence. Title 18 of the U.S. Code
Section 798 recognizes the special character of this —
material by providing specifically for prosecution for the
unauthorized disclosure. of information concerning any
communications activities of the United States Shue the

necessity to show intent ‘to harm the United States. The
reason for. the application of strict compartmentation pro-
cedures to communications intelligence and other foreign
intelligence activities reflects the extreme vulnerability
of the sources. Once an opposition becomes aware of which
of. its communications we are intercepting, it can take swift
remedial action, and the source can be. forever lost.

Dear Mr, Field;

Around the end of July, Mr. Roeder, obviously impressed.

“by your admonitions about the need for security, asked if I :

could work up a package of guidance on how to handle classified

.documents, Our Office of Security put this together, and while

I think Mr, Roeder had in mind something more applicable to
ab individual than to an office, I thought I would pass this on to
you for whatever use you care to make of it, :
Incidentally, we have not yet carried out the:physical survey
of your quarters which you requested on 29 July, I have been
in touch with Ms. Hess, and our Office of Security will conduct
one as soon as she is ready. We may have some other recom-
mendations for your consideration when that is done, _

**CORFIBENTIAL

GENERAL SUGGESTIONS
FOR THE
PROTECTION OF CLASSIFIED MATERIAL

Designate a Committee. member as the Security
Officer responsible for the overall coatrol
handling and protection of the classified
material.

Establish and maintain a register of all
Committee personnel who are authorized to
review classified material and insure that
no unauthorized personnel will have access to
the material.

Establish a central document control system
whereby all classified documents are properly
logged upon receipt and annotated as to
disposition.

Designate a Document Control Clerk who will
be specifically responsible for the logging
and control of all classified material.
Appropriate records should be established

to reflect that all classified material is
properly logged in and out, by date and tine,
to authorized members of the Committee.

In the event material is designated as being
of a codeword or compartmented nature, special
physical security features as enunciated by
the Ad Hoc Security Committee of the United
States Intelligence Board and later adopted
as policy should be adhered to. (Specifics
regarding these requirements will be provided
in the course of the pending survey.)

All guards assigned to the physical security
control over the Committee's storage area
should be U. S. citizens and possess appro-

priate security clearances.

If feasible, a reading room should be es-
tablished within the designated storage area

CONFIDENTIAL


so” BONFIDENTIAL

for the Committee's classified material, and
all research and review activities of the
material should be restricted to this area.

8. In those instances where the Committee meets
in Executive session, every effort should
be made to insure that the site being used has
been subjected to a technical security inspec-
tion to negate the possibility of unauthorized
transmitting or recording devices. This area
of concern could pose serious security deficien-
cies in the event the same area would be used
initially in public session and then closed for
the Executive session without such an inspection
being made.

9. Adequats safeguards should be utilized in the
transnission of classified material under the
cognizance of the Committee from one area to
another,

a

10. Reproduction of any portion of the Committee's
classified material should be prohibited
without the express approval of the Staff
Director. In this instance, notes, extracts,
summaries, etc., made from classified material
must also be provided the same degree of
protection as that provided to the source
material.

11. Access controls to the storage and reten-
tion area should be established to insure that
only authorized personnel are allowed entrance.

12. Storage of all classified material should be
within the designated area as opposed to any
areas or outside offices.

13, Security protection should be provided to
all Committee transcripts during the tran-
scription process as well as during the
periods while they are in transit.

14, A security check procedure should be estab-
lished to inspect the areas where the Com-
mittee meets at the termination of each
session to insure that no classified material

ane tl

i or notes, etc., are inadvertently left un-
secured. (Attached are examples of Security
Check Sheets.)

i
i 15. _Arrangements should ba made to insure that

| there are adequate facilities for the

i destruction of classified waste material.

- In this instance, such waste material should
Hl be provided protection until its final
destruction.

16. Only approved classified material destruc-

: tion methods should be utilized. (Details

i regarding this can be obtained in the course
of the pending survey.)

17. All Committee personnel granted access to
classified material by the Staff. Director
should be briefed on their obligations end
responsibilities regarding the unauthorized
disclosure of such material.

18. Specific physical security recommendations
applicable te the proposed storage area for the
Committee's classified material, consistent
with sound security principles, must be deferred
until the completion of the survey. This would
also include recommendations relative to the
type of storage containers which the Committee
proposes to use.

19. Pending the completion of a security survey at
the new storage site, it-is suggested that the
protective measures currently in effect at the
temporary storage facility in Room 232, Cannon
Building, not be changed.

House Armed Services
Subcommittee on
Intelligence
and Military Application of Nuclear Energy

The Subcommittee on Intelligence and. Military Application of Nuclear
Energy is newly established and the successor to the Special Subcommittee
on Intelligence Chaired by Representative Lucien N. Nedzi. The new Sub-
committee has picked up the responsibility of the soon to be abolished
Joint Committee on Atomic Energy and is expanding its staff accordingly.
Representative Melvin Price's Chairmanship is due to his long years of
membership on the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy. There will be an ever-
increasing involvement by the Subcommittee in military application of
nuclear energy and-we undoubtedly will be called upon to provide required
foreign intelligence.

* Members of the Subcommittee are as follows:

Melvin Price (D., I11.), Chairman
Charles H. Wilson (D., Calif.)
Jack Brinkley (D., Ga.)

Dan Daniel (D., Va.)

G. V. Montgomery (D., Miss.)

- Ronald V. Dellums (D., Calif.)
Bob Carr (D., Mich.) ~

Charles E. Bennett (D., Fla.)
Samuel S. Stratton (D., N.Y.)
Bob Wilson (R., Calif.)
William L. Dickinson (R., Ala.)
Marjorie S. Holt (R., Md.)
Robert W. Daniel, Jr. (R., Va.)

Staff of the Subcommittee are as follows:

John Ford, Staff Director
William H. Hogan, Counsel
Adam J. Klein, Professional

Mr. Ford is Staff Director of the full Committee and replaced
Mr, Frank Slatinshek, former Chief Counsel, who retired. Mr.-Hogan is
Counsel of the Subcommittee and will be the principal staff man on Agency
matters. Adam Klein is a specialist in atomic energy matters.

PROBLEMS a

A. House Subcommittee on Intelligence and Military Application of
Nuclear Energy

Former Chairman Lucien N. Nedzi fully exercised his perogatives
as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Intelligence and we could look to
him for support in any problems developing with other committees and
other members of the House not on the Subcommittee. Based on the
reactions of Chairman Melvin Price in the few instances that we have
approached him in this Congress for assistance, it is quite evident
that he is not the dominant’ personality as was Chairman Nedzi and will
not stick his neck out to defend the Agency. Nor does it appear that
the new staff director will be of the forceful personality as was
Frank Slatinshek who was very helpful in a number of problems. A few
weeks ago former Chairman Nedzi suggested that we resolve a problem
involving Representative Donald M. Fraser by going to Speaker O'Neill.
This may have been his indication to us that we may have to look to
House leadership to resolve problems. Mr. Nedzi also suggested that we
contact’ someone in the White House on a problem. We.may be faced with
needed White House Support on a problem before we approach the leader—
ship- ' :

B. House Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control

’

The extent of Chairman Lester L. Wolff's oversight of the Agency
in its narcotics collection activities still remains a looming problem.
As indicated by the request for the seal, Mr. Wolff intends to extend
the Agency's activities to where there is maximum effective collection
of foreign intelligence on narcotics trafficking leading to arrest and
conviction without regard to the Agency's statutory prohibitions. The
only solution rests with the Attorney General and the White House giving
the Agency clear and precise guidelines to operate in this area which
the Agency can then point to in any disputes that may arise with the
Select Committee as to what the Agency's role should be.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Initial Meeting with House Appropriations
Committee Survey Group

1. ‘An initial session was held on 30 July 1976 of
about one and a half hours with six persons from the Surveys
and Investigations Staff of the House Appropriations
Committee, to-discuss the purpose of their survey of the
Directorate of Operations and to propose some arrangements
to govern their access to Agency personnel and documents.
The following attended:

Mr. Cornelius (Lefty) Anderson, Chief of
Surveys and Investigations Staff

Mr. Marion Ramey, Deputv

Mr. Leonard (Bucky) Walters, who will head the
team inspecting the Directorate of Operations

Mr. Charles (Chuck) Haynes, team member

Mr. Eugene Wilhelm, team member (former
Agency employee)

Mr. George C. Baird, team member

Attending for the Agency were:

Mr. Theodore Shackley, who chaired the meeting
Mr. Robert Gambino

Mr. Lyle Miller

Mr. Thomas B. Abernathy

Mr. Richard Point

Mr. Philip F. Fendig

2. The meeting followed reasonably well the attached
agenda, which was made available to all at the beginning of
the meeting. The following paragraphs summarize the
important points covered.

3. Scope: Mr. Shackley asked the group to define its
mission, noting some of the topics mentioned in recent
conversations with Mr. Snodgrass suggested particular
interests whereas the Committee's report on the FY 77 budget


had suggested a different orientation. Mr. Anderson,
characterizing the enterprise as a survey rather than an
investigation, stated that his instructions were from the
Chairman of the Committee: they called for a detailed
review of the operation of the Directorate in its entirety.
Mr. Walters would mention certain particular interests,
noted below, but that did not set limits to the ultimate
scope of the survey, Mr. Walters then took over:

~a. He expects to do a complete review, from
the managerial and substantive standpoint, of the
Directorate. His initial interests indicated an
auditor's approach to these questions - how budgets
are compiled, examination of accounting procedures
for regular and special funds, cost systems and
the like.

b. He went on, however, to the management
aspects which they would also pursue to
determine the results of the Directorate's
operations - the value of intelligence produced
versus the costs involved in procuring it, and
areas of possible overlap in collection with
the military and with NSA.

c. Specific areas which would be explored,
given, as examples, included contingency reserves,
the "special retirement fund" (presumably
referring to MHMUTUAL), the procedures for
reimbursing | and
support, proprietaries (how created, their
justification, value and effectiveness), safe-
houses and."'CA cadres."

Mr. Anderson reluctantly agreed to Mr. Shackley's request
for a memorandum spelling out these objectives in sufficient

detail so that we could take the managerial steps necessary

to resolve any conflicts in the priority of the time of our
managers and senior operations officers who would be

involved in current operations as well as overlapping
inquiries from other groups concurrently overseeing the
Directorate. Mr. Anderson also asked for any ongoing studies
which the Directorate might have which would aid the team

in its work.

miners i:


4. Duration: The team's first objective will be to
render an interim report to the Committee by 1 January 1977,
in order to meet the mandate that the survey be used in
considering the Agency's FY 1978 budget. The team wishes
to start work immediately and will consist of either six or
seven members who will occupy. space in Headquarters building
and presumably do most of their work here; it was brought
out, however, that the team would also interview users of
our intelligence and other collectors. There was ambiguity
in the projection of the total length of the survey; I
interpreted Mr. Anderson's remarks to indicate that he
expected the team to be with us for most of calendar year
1977.

5. Security: Mr. Anderson explained the arrangement
by which the Committee limits access by even the members of
the Subcommittee to the reports of his group; they must be
reviewed in a specified area and they are stored, in very
limited numbers, in the tower of the Capitol in the special
facilities there for the Joint Atomic Energy Committee of
Congress. Mr. Gambino explained the arrangements for badges,
certification of. clearances, and provided for the team's
consideration a copy of the "non-disclosure agreement" which
we would like members to sign. There was considerable
discussion, and some objection, to the issuance of blue
badges which will provide access to virtually all parts of
the building but which must be turned in and picked up at
the entrance each day. This arrangement was reluctantly
accepted but it was made clear at lunch and in later
discussion with the team and with Mr. Anderson they are
unhappy with this slight infringement on their convenience
and physical access to the building.

6. Access: Of more concern was the Agency position
that the SA/DO70 would serve as a control point for the
team's further access to individuals and documents in the
Directorate. The requirement was explained in terms of the
need to record, against later requirements such as in fact
now in progress stemming from another investigation, the
names, subject matter and general content of matters discussed
by Agency officers with team members. The requirement to
"monitor" was explained as an effort to keep this type of
record, rather than to impose a third party from the office
of SA/DO/O on all interviews; the latter was clearly
considered by the team to be an unreasonable intrusion. It
was agreed after some discussion that we would proceed with



Mv

system outlined in the attached agenda, and that we would
reconsider procedures later if they seemed clearly to be
unwieldy. . We anticipated, however, that once the team
splits into smaller groups as is planned, and pursues
particular areas of inquiry, it will be possible to evolve

a workable system which meets ‘the objectives of both parties.

7. Other: There appears to be no difficulty in
protecting identities of sources, providing documents in
sanitized form, maintaining notes only in this building and
at the appropriate security level and introducing some
officers under cover in alias where necessary; all these
points were noted and none was objected to. Space and
other facilities may be cramped but it appears to be possible
to provide adequate space adjacent to the SA/DQ/O offices.
Mr. Anderson began by noting the outstanding cooperation on
the Angola and COMINT surveys done in the building (in which
relatively free access to personnel and files had been
afforded his team), and ended by stating that the coming
survey was not a witch hunt nor an investigation of abuses
and that therefore he believed that such access could have
very beneficial results for the Agency. It was agreed to
begin the survey formally with a briefing by the DDO or
ADDO on 3 or 4 August 1976. Mr. Walters with several team
members will, however, set up shop on 2 August to review
such general briefing papers as Mr, Fendig can make
available to them at that time.

SURVEY BY MEMBERS OF
THE HOUSE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE STAFF

GENERAL

Members of the staff of the House Appropriations Com-
mittee began an extensive examination of the Directo-
rate of Operations beginning the week of 2 August 1976.
They expect that it will take approximately 17 months
to complete this study. They state their activities
are necessary to better understand the appropriations
process. They emphasize that their objective is not
to dig out evidence of wrongdoing or improper activi-
ties. The staff members' activities will be coordi-
nated through SA/DO/O. The following paragraphs
attempt to anticipate the procedures necessary to
exercise orderly control over the staff's activities. .
These procedures may be subject to modification as
future experience may dictate.

LOCATION

Members of this Congressional staff have been issued
blue badges bearing the words "House Committee" which
permit unescorted access to all non-specially controlled
areas of the building, including the main cafeteria.
The staff will be provided suitable private office
space in Room 2 D 0117, adjacent to the office of the
SA/DO/O, which will be relocated in Room 2 D 0109 as
of 6 August 1976. It is expected that they will initi-
ally have a greater interest in interviews than they
do in documents. Since they will have adequate office
space, interviews should be conducted within their
premises. Z

CONTROL OF DOCUMENTS

a. The staff is expected to make any requests for.
documentation to the SA/DO/O. Individual officers

who receive requests from staff members for docu-
ments should ask that the request be put to the
SA/DO/O. All documents provided to the SA/DO/O
for transmittal to the staff will be logged in by
the SA/DO/O and logged back to the component after
the staff has completed its study. The SA/DO/O
will not, as a matter of routine procedure, retain
a-copy of the document concerned.

All documents will be properly sanitized to protect
sources and methods. The staff has indicated that
it does not anticipate any need for such detail
and accepts the principle of sanitization. Any
questions concerning the degree of sanitization
should be referred to the SA/DO/O. Ground rules
for sanitization are similar to those applied
during the activities of the Select Committees.
General guidelines will be provided separately.

On receipt of a document back from the SA/DO/O

the recipient should indicate the date received,
and that it had been made available to the staff.
The document should be retained by the recipient
in the form in which it was provided to the staff
for possible further reference; the record copy
of the document should also reflect the fact that
a sanitized copy was provided to the staff. Any
further copies of documents requested by the staff
will be made only by the office of the SA/DO/O.

4, INTERVIEWS

A representative from the office of the SA/DO/0
will not necessarily be present during interviews.
All interviews should be requested by the staff
through the SA/DO/O. The SA/DO/O will maintain

e@ record of the date of interview; the name of
the person interviewed, arid by whom; the alias

if one is used; and the subjects discussed. A
form will be provided to the interviewee to record

the essential facts. He should retain one copy
for possible future reference and one copy should
be forwarded to the SA/DO/0.

b. It is recognized that the badge access and the
length of the stay in the building by the staff
members may lead to unscheduled contacts. If
such contacts are connected with the official
duties of the staff, then appropriate comments
should be forwarded to SA/DO/O on the form cited
above. Officers should be careful not to allow
conversations to drift to areas of interest not
covered by official interviews. If this does take
place, however, we shall rely on the officer
concerned to inform the SA/DO/O of these develop-
ments.

5. SECURITY

The blue badge should be sufficient to indicate that
staff members should be treated as visitors in the
presence of persons not connected with their official
duties. Persons introduced under alias should be
careful that the alias is protected if a chance
meeting takes place in the presence of other col-
leagues. In this connection, persons interviewed
should be careful not to expose associates who have
not been interviewed.

SUBJECT : Guidance for Interviews with House
Appropriations Committee Staff
REFERENCE : DON 5-218, 4 August 1976

1. You have been scheduled at the time indicated on
the cover sheet of this memorandum for a briefing to be
given to the five members of the Surveys and Investigations
Staff team from the House Appropriations Committee. The
subjects which the team would like you to cover are contained
in the memorandum distributed prior to the DDO staff meeting
on 25 August 1976 and discussed at that meeting. I have
explained to the Surveys and Investigations team that topic e
(personnel policy and practices) will be discussed at a :
separate briefing to be given by the Chief, Career Management
Group. You should touch on the other topics suggested in the
memorandum mentioned above.

2. General guidelines are contained in reference
notice. The following’ may be helpful, however, in preparing
your briefing. Our general intention is to be as forth-
coming as possible while drawing the line clearly at any
information which would lead to the identification of a
specific source, intelligence method, cooperating person or
group with which the.Agency has a relationship of confidence,
or confidential matter involving a cooperating foreign
intelligence service. The fact of liaison with foreign
services can in most cases be acknowledged, but details of
the relationship and the subject matter of joint or shared
operations should not be disclosed.

3. In the briefing contemplated on management policies
and practices, most of the above sensitive areas would not
appear to arise, but you may find that questions will tend
to bring out some more sensitive areas and these should be
deferred with an agreement of looking into the possibility of
providing further information later. The staff has already
had access to basic budgetary material, including funds and

personnel strengths broken down by component, and a listing
by cryptonyms and funding levels of all OPACTS. They have
been given a briefing on the current organization of the
Directorate of Operations and are aware that its staff
elements will shortly be reorganized. They have a listing
of all overseas stations and bases. If you have further
questions on material already provided to the Committee,
please check with this office.

4. Most of the briefings are scheduled to take place
in room 2 D 0117; if possible, a member of my staff will be
present. We would appreciate, however, a short Memorandum
for the Record, using the attached "Interview Form* as a
general guide. Space is somewhat limited, but you should
bring any. supporting personnel you desire to have participate
in your briefing. The Surveys and Investigations team is
aware that aliases may be used by those with solid cover
status; please’ advise this office if any persons intend to
use an alias during these briefing sessions.

5. We will be happy to assist in any way, including
follow-up matters which may be developed in the course of
these briefings.

in attempting to be both forthcoming and helpful to him and the

Committee in understanding the DDO's problems. At the same time

‘Mr. Snodgrass pointed out that while he had no quarrel with Mr. Shackley,
he continued tobe irritated with the totality of the Avency's attitude toward
providing him with data, Mr. Snodgrass then launched into a long litany
on how the Agency had not been responsive in terms of his needs as he
perceived them in the time frame February to May 1976. With thatas a
backdrop Mr. Snodgrass then launched into his inquiry as to why the Agency
was not willing to give him full access to Management by Objective docu-
ments. The dialogue which followed on this topic had a natural ebb and
flow to it, but the key point that emerged from this is that Mr. Snodgrass
continues to feel that unless he can see the Management by Objective
documents he will not be able to have a firm understanding of DDO man-
powsr allocation procedures. Secondly, Mr. Snodgrass claims that CIA's

position that it will show Management by Objective documents to members
of the Committee and not the Staff is an obstructignist tactic. His point

being that the members of the Committee do not have the time to look at
such documents and they thus depend on the Committee Staff for this type
of substantive review. According to Mr. Snodgrass this means that if the
Agency will not provide data to the Staff, it is in fact denying information.
fo the Committee members. Attempts were made by Mr. Shackley to show
how men of good will on both sides of this question could have an honest
difference of opinion on the issue. In this framework Mr. Shackley re-
iterated the DDO position that access to Management by Obiective docu-

ents by Mr. Snodgrass would impact adversely on juestion of
sources ods as well as the integrity of the reporting system. As
a followup to this position an effort was made to find out exactly what it

was about the DDO manpower allocation system that Mr. Snodgrass did
not understand and which he thought he might find out about from an ~
examination of the Management by Objective documents. it was hoped
that through this line of inquiry an alternate approach could-be discovered
which would enable ts to deal with Mr. Snodgrass' problems. Our probes
in this direction were unsuccessful in clarifying the issue. One can only |
conclude that Mr odgrass is committed to finding some sort of a
system, We have repeatedly outlined to him the variable factors that go

into making judgments on operational deployment of manpower such as

what targets are in a country, what are the great power interests ina
particular country, what is the operational environment in the country

i.e., permissive or not, what are the cover possibilities, what are our
liaison equities, and what are our needs for regional support from a
parlicular Country. THEGe explanations are taken aboard by Mr, Snodgrass,
but he is looking for something else which has less variables in it when,

in fact, there is no magic formula for determining how one gets people to
commit treason. This portion of the meeting ultimately ended on a friendly
note but left unresolved the question of what was it that Mr. Snodgrass
really wanted on the issue of manpower allocations and what could CIA tell
him that we haven't already told him. (ACTION REQUIRED: Mr. Snodgrass
is currently preoccupied with drafting his report on the House Appropria-
tions Committee Mark-up of the DDO FY 77 budget. Once this task is
completed Mr. Chin, OLC, will return to see Mr. Snodgrass and will try ©

to obtain an elaboration of what specifically are the manpower issues that
trouble Mr. Snodgrass. In this context Mr. Chin has been asked to try to

determine if a review, Pe epost, of two or three typical Stations
within the DDO might sive Mr. snodgrass the insight into manpower allo-
cations that he is currently Seeking. )

9. Comment. In net assessment terms one would have to conclude
that the 25 May meeting achieved the optimum that could be expected from
this kind of an encounter. On the one hand the attached briefing book which
was examined by Mr. Snodgrass was accepted by the latter as a first rate
product. For this the A gency gets high marks. On the other hand, the
Management by Objective system, because he can't see the documents,
leaves Mr. Snodgrass frustrated and irritated. This evokes acrimonious
complaints from Mr. Snodgrass with the end result being that the burden
for seekin, solution to a problem created by Mr. Snodgrass i 2:
the Agency.’ In short, we have ended up where we expected to be. Put
another way, there appears to be no prospect for, establishing the type of
dialogue with Mr. Sni ests of both parties.

Mr. Mahon. Would you please provide the Committee staff with
some samples of these performance reports, sanitized as you think
appropriate?

Mr. Bush. I would be willing to bring some down and discuss them with
the Committee off the record, Mr. Chairman. But I am reluctant to do that,
and I am even more reluctant _to provide the documents themselves or to have
their contents described to the Committee by anyone who is not intimately
familiar with espionage, counterintelligence and covert. action operations

and with the entire management system used by the Operations Directorate.

There are a number of reasons for my position. One serious concern
revolves around the effects on our internal processes of the sort of inquiry

{you propose. One of the primary reasons that our internal management system

is effective is that participation is ictly limited to those immediately

concerned. Given that we are all human beings, there is no escaping the.
—_—

fact that knowledge that the reports in question are being read, or may at

some future time be read, by outsiders will lead to their being written

with a view to their possible impact on an extended readership. ‘There will

—_o———

be a tendency for the managers in the field to slant their discussions of
problems and_to exaggerate’ accomplishments. Inevitably, the net effect

will be’ to reduce the usefulness of the system.

Another difficulty involves security. To be useful for judging per-
formance, the reports must be very detailed. Thus they discuss recruitments
in terms ‘of numbers, the specific’ access of agents to information, recruit-
ment techniques, and so forth. By the time all this sensitive material on
sources and methods is removed, any samples are going to consist primarily
o£ disconnected bits and pieces or ‘of unenlightening generalizations.

And I have a third problem with this request. The reports themselves

are but one part of a very complex and thorough process we use for internal
——————

management, It takes a detailed familiarity with the pr: Oo appreciate
—_—

its effectiveness. Thus, I feel strongly that someone from the Agency who
————
has that intimate knowledge should be present if and when you want to

consider the reports.
