{rom.a Spaniard (Nicanor FERNANDEZ) in Buenos Airea, ‘urging WIRG
to go to Buonos Airca to arouse anti-Caatro sentiment of the peoale,
tiaomuch ao some Argentine action against Cuba appeared imminent,
(FERNANDEZ said be had already written MINC a lotter,) MIRC says,
“Of course, Icannct go. Ibave tho Consejo meeting on tho 15th,
Furthermore, Iam going to New York on Cetober 11th or 12th for the,
SIP. (Soctoded Interamericana do F’zcnsa) mecting and havo. boen allotted
12 tninutes to address the meeting.

Precipitated QUADKCS' reelynatioa) on Octuder 15

Dr, MIRO sald he planned tu. remain in Naw York City (alter
11 and 12 Cetober SIP mooting), until October 15th to attend the bomago
for LACERDA, the Governor of Guanabara province in Brasil, 141RO
Probably will stay at tho Park Chambore Hote), but will advise Clark

of bie location. -

I cominented that I would probably remain in \asbington next
week tn view of his plans, but that I might go to New York City to meet
with him; {f 90;. I would get tn touch with him and arrongo a meeting
" place ‘through’ Clark.”

11, Propaganda Cominiesion
I asked Dr, MIRO about hio idess on the future organization
and structure of the Propaganda Comnileston, Ho stated that it is out-
side the Consejo and not uhuer Als direct control, although the Council
eccountant has been passing funds to ft. Ho said CASS RILLC had resigned
es head of Propaganda and that he would like CONTE AGUF.RC to handle .
it.: He claimed that MESTRE' had not done. gnything with propaganda,

12, MIRO'a Views Relative to Suprems Court Justice or PRIO

being Kecoznised ag Head of a Provisional Government

Tasked Dr. %IRO if he believed that there were many anti-
Castro Cubsas (both to and out of Cuba) who favored PRIC,.or the head
of the Supreme Court to be the provisional president if a soverament wore
to be established on Cuban coll. Dr. MIC declared that the revolution
io a fact, and that practically nobody wanta to go back to any former
Togimne, . The peaple in Cuba would reoist any such Possibility. He da-



nounced FRIC's activities against the Council and ito efforts to unity
the anti-Castro clements, fic aaid that the people should be given an
Opportunity to elect their chic! of state after Castro's overthrow and
Foeetablishinent of order in the island.

13, Cfficoe of Council (Consejo Revotuctonario)

When. questioned about his business and private telephones,
‘The'businese phone ts‘also\in my house. Ihave no office

except in my house. but that phone ie always busy (JE Merson 2-4680),

So use the. other phone {JE{foraan 4-2751) whoa you wish to call me,"

“T need to have 8 small office somewhere away {rom my home
because all the activities thare are driving my wife eraay. I want:to
find something. modost 50 that no accusation can be made of ostentation <
merely a-room for myself, one [or my secretary, and.one for-meotinga,
of the Coutcil, ete.. The FRD had 9 place but at that place also wai
progs, the refugee center, otc, It-would not ba satisfactory. Tho FRD
fo now practically dead. B was the forerunner of the Cansojo a6 the
unifying agency of the anti-Castro rosistaace, "

4. MIR on Coordinating tho Activities of Cther Exito-

G

After Dr, MIRC reiterated his view that he should be the
channel for funds and coordinating the activities of groups outside the
Consejo ouch as the Students, FORD (Labor), ete., I onid that I under
stood that sore of those elements were unwilling to function under the
Consojo;-and that.in view 6f that situation, did he consider that an. .
Activity Committee might be orzanised with a dolegato.from each of..
these groupe and under the chairmanship of 'a. momber of the Consojo.
This would serve to coordinate their activities, give them a tie-in with
the ‘Consejo, yot not make them subservient to it, Dr. MIRC replicd
that this would merely set up another Consejo outside of and Parallel to
the existing Consejo. I did not pursue thio further, not having enough
background of these organizations to be abla to discuss the matter

effectively.

15, Tolepono Conversation with MIRO on 7 Cetober

Before my departure {rom Miami for Washiazton on 7 October,
Itelephaned to Dr. MLR (vom the airport. He appreciated the call and
asked if | had seen in the morning paper the action taxen yedtorday by



tho ALABAU Lawyere! group in proclairsing Jullo CARCE RAN (one
