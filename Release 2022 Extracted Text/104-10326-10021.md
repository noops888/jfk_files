IN A CEREMONY HELD ON OCTOBER 2, C/NROC PRESENTED OFSS/ PRINTING
AND PHOTOGRAPHY GROUP (P PG) WITH A MERITORIOUS UNIT CITATION FOR ITS
ASSISTANCE TO THE DO'S CIASO EFFORTS. C/NROC, WHO ORCHESTRATED THE
DO’S CIEASO CELEBRATIONS, CITED P PG’S "INCREDIBLE CREATIVITY AND
SUPPORT" TO THE DO DURING ALL OF ITS CIASO EVENTS FROM JANUARY
THROUGH SEPTEMBER, INCLUDING THE BLAIR HOUSE RECEPTION. SHE NOTED
AM SURE THAT I SPEAK FOR THE ENTIRE DO MANAGEMENT TEAM WHEN I SAY
THAT P PG'S ROLE IN CRAFTING ARTISTIC POSTERS, DEVELOPING CREATIVE
WALL DISPLAYS, ASSISTING IN THE DESIGN AND TIMELY PRINTING OF THE
MANY BROCHURES AND INVITATIONS, AND PROVIDING OUTSTANDING
PHOTOGRAPHIC COVERAGE WAS CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF EACH EVENT.
WITHOUT P PG, THE CELEBRATION WOULD’ NOT HAVE BEEN WHAT IT WAS--A
ITRULY CLASS ACT. WE ARE IN AWE OF ALL YOU DO."

DDA DICK CALDER ECHORD HER SENTIMENTS, POINTING OUT THAT "I’‘VE
HAD AN ENORMOUS POSITIVE RESPONSE FROM CUSTOMERS OF P PG’S CIASO
EFFORTS, WHICH WERE THE RESULT OF AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF HOURS AND
WEEKENDS. SUPERB WORK ROUTINELY COMES FROM P PG, WHOSE TEAM MEMBERS
ALWAYS SHOW EXCEPTIONAL COMMITMENT AND QUALITY OF WORK. I JUST WANTED
YOU TO KNOW HOW PROUD THE ADDA, THE ENTIRE DA, AND I AM OF P PG."

REGARDING POTENTIAL CIA ELIGIBILITY TO OBTAIN USAA PROPERTY AND
CASUALTY INSURANCE

{THE DISCUSSION CENTERED AROUND USAA'S INTERPRETATION OF THEIR
SXISTING BYLAWS TO DETERMINE IF AGENCY EMPLOYEES COULD BE EXTENDED
HEMBERSHTP. USAA’S LEGAL COUNSEL 1S ANALYZING ITS CURRENT BYLAWS THAT
LIMIT INSURANCE COVERAGE TO COMMISSIONED OFFICERS || PROPOSED
AMENDMENT TO THE BYLAWS WOULD EXTEND COVERAGE TO MILITARY
NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICERS. IF APPROVED, USAA WOULD ALSO EXAMINE THE
LANGUAGE TO DETERMINE IF AGENCY OFFICERS (CURRENTLY DEFINED AS GS-9
AND ABOVE) QUALIFY.

USAA MEMBERSHIP WAS EXTENDED TO SPECIAL AGENTS OF THE FEDERAL
UREAU OF INVESTIGATION (FBI) AND SECRET SERVICE (USSS) OFFICERS
BECAUSE THEY ARE PROHIBITED FROM HOLDING A COMMISSION IN THE MILITARY
