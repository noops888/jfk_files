IN A CEREMONY HELD ON OCTOBER 2, C/NROC PRESENTED OFSS/ PRINTING

AND PHOTOGRAPHY GROUP (P PG) WITH A MERITORIOUS UNIT CITATION FOR ITS

ASSISTANCE TO THE DO'S CIA50 EFFORTS.

C/NROC, WHO ORCHESTRATED THE

DO'S CIA50 CELEBRATIONS, CITED P PG'S "INCREDIBLE CREATIVITY AND

SUPPORT" TO THE DO DURING ALL OF ITS CIA50 EVENTS FROM JANUARY

THROUGH SEPTEMBER, INCLUDING THE BLAIR HOUSE RECEPTION. SHE NOTED "I

AM SURE THAT I SPEAK FOR THE ENTIRE DO MANAGEMENT TEAM WHEN I SAY

THAT P PG'S ROLE IN CRAFTING ARTISTIC POSTERS, DEVELOPING CREATIVE

WALL DISPLAYS, ASSISTING IN THE DESIGN AND TIMELY PRINTING OF THE

MANY BROCHURES AND INVITATIONS, AND PROVIDING OUTSTANDING

PHOTOGRAPHIC COVERAGE WAS CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF EACH EVENT.

WITHOUT P PG, THE CELEBRATION WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN WHAT IT WAS--A

DDA DICK CALDER ECHOED HER SENTIMENTS, POINTING OUT THAT "I'VE

HAD AN ENORMOUS POSITIVE RESPONSE FROM CUSTOMERS OF P PG'S CIA50

EFFORTS, WHICH WERE THE RESULT OF AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF HOURS AND

WEEKENDS. SUPERB WORK ROUTINELY COMES FROM P PG, WHOSE TEAM MEMBERS

ALWAYS SHOW EXCEPTIONAL COMMITMENT AND QUALITY OF WORK. I JUST WANTED

YOU TO KNOW HOW PROUD THE ADDA, THE ENTIRE DA, AND I AM OF P PG."

THE DISCUSSION CENTERED AROUND USAA'S INTERPRETATION OF THEIR

EXISTING BYLAWS TO DETERMINE IF AGENCY EMPLOYEES COULD BE EXTENDED

MEMBERSHIP. USAA'S LEGAL COUNSEL IS ANALYZING ITS CURRENT BYLAWS THAT

LIMIT INSURANCE COVERAGE TO COMMISSIONED OFFICERS. A PROPOSED

AMENDMENT TO THE BYLAWS WOULD EXTEND COVERAGE TO MILITARY

NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICERS. IF APPROVED, USAA WOULD ALSO EXAMINE THE

LANGUAGE TO DETERMINE IF AGENCY OFFICERS (CURRENTLY DEFINED AS GS- 9

AND ABOVE) QUALIFY.

USAA MEMBERSHIP WAS EXTENDED TO SPECIAL AGENTS OF THE FEDERAL

BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION (FBI) AND SECRET SERVICE (USSS) OFFICERS

BECAUSE THEY ARE PROHIBITED FROM HOLDING A COMMISSION IN THE MILITARY

RESERVES, RENDERING THEM ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE USAA MEMBERSHIP. BECAUSE
