When I was visiting a person if Havana, Cuba,
whose name I do not remember, who waS a person
I had been sent to in order to make arrangements
for the families who were leaving Cuba with me,
I was detained by two men whoidentified themselves
to me with credentias as G-2 Agents. They took me
to an office in Havana, of which I do not know the
address. In this office, they kept me for eight
to ten hours, While I was detained, a man dressed
in olive drab uniform interrogated me. This man
accused me of being an Agent fr the Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) of the United States,

man, I consented to work for the G-2 in the United

the information that I have given to has been
deceiving or false, and I have been careful to
insure that the false information could not be
checked on. To demonstrate that I was a reliable
person, -I gave certain information about events
that had already happened which could be verified
or which was public information. For example,
after one clandestine trip to Cuba carried out

by Cuban exiles, I gave information about this
trip, but. only after they had returned to the
United States. I.never have given information
which could have jeopardized any person, to the-
best of my knowledge.

a completely fake story about a plan by Cuban
exiles in Miami to assassinate FIDEL CASTRO.
