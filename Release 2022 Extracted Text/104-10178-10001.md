AS PERMANENT-RESIDENT ALIENS {PRA}, THEY MUST MAKE APPLICATIONS FOR

RETURNING RESIDENT VISAS WITH THE CARACAS CONSULATE. THERE IS NO

GUARANTEE THAT THE VISAS WILL BE ISSUED. SINCE ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO

QUOTA NUMBER INVOLVED, THE PROCESSING IS THE SAME AS ANY OTHER

IMMIGRANT VISAs WITH THE CONSULAR OFFICER HAVING THE SOLE AUTHORITY TO

MAKE THE DETERMINATION AS TO ELIGIBILITY. IF THEY APPLY SOLELY FOR A

TOURIST VISA IN THEIR VENEZUELAN PASSPORT. THEY COULD LOSE THEIR PRA

STATUS. SINCE APPLYING FOR A TOURIST VISA IS PRIMA FACIA EVIDENCE

OF BBEDE RB ABANDONMENT OF PRA STATUS. IF THEY OBTAIN RETURNING

30 January 1975

MEMORANDUM FOR: Alien Affairs Officer,
# OPS/LSN
SUBJECT : Luis Clemente POSADA Carriles

1. On 30 June 1974 Luis Clemente POSADA's employment
with the Agency was terminated by mutual consent. At that
time he was establishing a private investigative agency from
which he expected to earn his livelihood. The Immigration
and Naturalization Service file on POSADA, thorefore, may
now be decontrolled. As of 27 January 1975, POSADA is still

* located in Caracas, Venezuela. .

2. On 12 June 1974 Caracas Station advised that POSADA
had been informed of and fully undorstands the effect that
termination of his Agency cuployment will have upon his
resident alien status and eligibility for U.S, citizenship.
We have not yet received termination records on POSADA,
probably because the Station is still meeting with him
regarding settlement of his outstanding U.S. tax liabilities.

brought to the attention of the Station by WH/Miami. It is difficult
to tell from our files exactly when contact was initiated, but as
early as 1965, Subject was being used by EKHERALD, WKSCARLET-3 Is
currently in the process of establishing a private investigative
company in Caracas. From January throuch “arch 1974, when the new
fovernment took over and HKSCARLET-3 was asked to leave his job,

he was the Chief of Gu Uv of Svedira of WKSCARLET, and reported on all
aspects, operations, etc. of that unit. He is now in the process

of being terninated, effective 30 June 1974, by his case officer,
BACHHUBER, due to his lack of access and high profile. WKSCARLET-3
currently receives compensation in the arount of Rs2,000 per month,
Subject was last successfully given an SGSWIRL on 8 May 1973, Since
March 1974, his profile has been relatively high. There have been
two articles in the local press naming him as a BKHERALD agent.

Since those two articles, none have appeared; however, he has several
high powered nersonal enenics in the current government and could
come under political attack at any time. The Station docs not feel
that NKSCARLET-3 presents or will present a security threa Me

has been well treated during his Jong relationship with BKHERALD
which he realizes and is thankful for. ‘eetinps to carry out the
termination are being conducted with strict regard for security.

A safchouse used for part of the period (S/H 45) and costing about
$950, was terminated in March 1974. The only special commitment

with WKSCARLET-3 is a termination payment of Bs6,000,

SUBJECT: MISCARLET/3 = IDENTITY A \ RDS 72501
BY-DOY eae
BACKGROUND: . fl

Swfect of this report.1s a KASTONE born citizen of IDEN B who
thas permanent restdent alfen status in WODUAL. Subject was granted
a renewed OA on 17 July 1972 and he was last SGSWIRLed on 3 Novenber
1971 with favorable results. Subject estimated that he has been
SGSWIRLed approxtnately ten times by BKHERALD and two or three additional

tiows by the WODUAL Army.

PURPOSE AND PROCEDURE:

\

On 8 May 1973, in IDEN C, Subject was again SGSWIRLed at the
request of his Case Officer, Gabriel J. LABRENZ. The session was
conducted in order to determine 1f Subject has ever been involved in
the {Negal drug traffic as alleged by a LNAGON source and also :
whether Subject knows anyone involved in the fllegal drug business. .
Subject has a good command of the English language and the entire
session was conducted tn English. All of the test questions were
‘coordinated with LABRENZ in advance and he remained in an adjoining
room within hearing range. This examiner was introduced to Subject

as BiT? JOHNSCH from HODUAL.

RESULTS?
No indications of deception.
SGSWIBL results supported Subject in his contenttons as follows:

1. that, excluding what he told us (See DETAILS), he has not
used drugs for non-madicinal reasons. :

2. that, excluding IDEN D, he 1s not acquainted with anyone who
he knows 1s involved {n the illegal drug traffic. (See
DETAILS for those he weuspects.")

Pee 2

3. that, excluding what he told us (See OETAILS), he has never
received money or been involved fn the sale, ourchase, or

smuggling of drugs.

4, that, excluding what he told us (See CETAILS), he has never
been asked to participate in the illecal drug traffic.

DETAILS:

Curing the pre-test discussion, Subject stated that he personally
has sunked marijuana on three or four occastons and.he has sniffed
Cocaine on approximately five occasions in the vast ten years. Sub-
Sect asserted that on. each occasion, he was attending soctal gatherings
with STONE friends andhe felt socially comelled to indulge in
order to please the other partictpants. He estinated that he knows
approximately thirty-five people who use cocaine or marijuana. Subject
asserted that his last use of cocaine was Tast ronth when he visited
WODUAL. SGSWIRL supported Sudject's claim that his personal use of
drugs has not been more extensive.

During the pre-test discussion, Subject asserted that he was not
acquainted with anyone who he knew for certain was fnvolved in drug
trafficking. Subject did list the following IDENS when asked {f he
knew anyone who he “suspected” was involved in trafficking drugs:
IOENS 2, E, F, G, H and I. Subject asserted that his susptctons
were based on rumor and these people have never talked to him about
{legal drugs. After recording reactions to the test question, “Are
you concesling the identity of anyone who you know 1s involved in the
Sale or smuggling of drugs?" (Ans. Xo), Subject acknowledged that his
concern for the question was due to the fact that he more than merely
“suspected IDEN D was involved and he was “90% certain.”

During the pre-test discussion, Subject stated that in 1954 or
1955, while fn KMSTONE, he and a friend sold a non-dangerous drug to

a buyer who belfeved it to be cocaine, Subject asserted that he mada
$25.05 from this transaction. Also, wnile in KXSTONE at the sam

time, Subject stated that a friend, IDEN J, asked him tf he wished
to.participate in the smuggling of cocaine out of Peru. Subject

. advised that he declined the offer. As prevfously noted, SGSWIRL
résults supported Sudject's contentfons that. his {nvolverent with
dangerous drugs has not been more extensive.

Caracas Radto Continente Metwork in Spanish 0300 GMT 1) Apr 7} P

[teat] The presivont of tna Supreme Blectoral Counvtl, Liis A. Pletri, hao denied the
charges made ragarding the aollect ion of somslssions on tha nale of voting mechines,
Just as this station has reported, Piotr has craered a thorough investigation in order
to establish responsibilities, Tha snnouniemant wus mado by Pletri during @ prese acn=
férénce held tonight at the headquarters uf the Supreme Council. Speaking for himself.
Plotri eaid that. he would have filed suit aginst those implicated in the commtasions
deal. He suid that ho vould have started the suit if ne had know which persons were

involved in the affair. .

The statement made by Antonto Bapinota Prieto regarding a Supposed reduction in the
contract for the purchase of the voting machinon 18 completely false, said the comptroller :
general, Manuel Viconte Ledesma. “The report was published in local newnpapers.- Accord~ !
{rg to the papers Antonio Espinosa Pri@to said that Mr Dixon, former president of the

Autonatic Voting Machines [AVN] Conary, had come to Venezuela to negotiate a reduction
in the price of. the contract. [Words indistinct] Prieto said that the reduction wae in
the nature of $3,050,000, but the comptroller general of the republic denied the infor
mation docause his office never had any knowledge of Prieto's assertion,

‘The affairs of the oolleation of commissions on the purchase of voting machines has
turned into a real scandal. It will be recalled that the proposal to purchase the
Voting machines in the first place wis @ sennution. On tat ocoasion tha representatives
of tha yarious partios reprasented fn the Suprean Bloatoral Counat! weve divided. The
Oppesition insisted that machines had to be uued in the next elections bacause the

awa spectfied this, Tha Soofal Christian Party (COPR1], the Demosratta Mational

Feoat [PND] and an intepandent party ware opposed to the purchase because it meant a
Atapuragsant of mil}fous of bolivares, Subsequently the matter wan submitted toa

vote and the opposition parties van,

Contasts wore begin with tho machine rupplier ent more disagrenments arcse. The oppo-
Attton wanted tu purchase the sashtnen from AVM, white COPET and FSD wanted to purchase
thea frou ancthev company. Tha opprsition won again because it was in the maJority

and tt was decided ttat AVM vould supriy the meottnas, Tha U.S, mpresoatatives arrived:
the owners, tho xelesmrn, ant the comitaion ayents of the company. The contract was
Grafted ami it spsoifind that Venorusia sovlé nut pay move than t pervent of the tetal
transaction tn uommiestons. The trantacticn was for 180 million poltvares

At this stage a ghost appeared to pursue the AVM in the United States in the form of
the Bloction Systems Coupany, which suad the AVM, alleging that the AVM negotiated
directly in Venezuela without going threugh the Elections Systems Company. The latter
domed 1ts commission and last week won the suit. Tis 19 how the scandal broke A
‘Tha AVM satd that {t could not pay commissiors to the Eleation Systems Company besause :
these commissions haé becn paid directly t+ Venezudlan politiofans. The AVM defended :
itself and its representatives said at the trial whit they had to say, vmich 18 preotse-
