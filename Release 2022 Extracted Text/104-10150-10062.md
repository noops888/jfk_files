Remarks:

Tron St standpoint, we want Mr. Ryan's

name deleted wherever it appears (pages

7, 9, 9 and 14).

Also

note error on pages

and

14 concerning date of FBI interro-

patron.

Where 1963 appears on this pages

it should read 1964.

ntherwise we have

not problems with this as far as it goes,

but would like to see "sections to be

acided."
