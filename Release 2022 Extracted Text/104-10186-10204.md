groups of agents, 4s expected to do-upon returning to his native
country and TORRES arranges a training schedule which will prepare
each individual for his assignment; he decides how many hours of
instruction each trainee will have and in what subjects. In addition,

teach courses himself although he ranks as the chief instructor. He
works particularly close with the Venezuelan desk officers and has
relatively less to do with other LN Department operations officers.1
