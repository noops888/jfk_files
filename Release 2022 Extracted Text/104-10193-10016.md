they also were going to the power plant to arrest him. Subject also
learned that there was surveillance on his home on the night of 22 July
1961, but the person watching the house had gotten drunk and did not.see
subject when he returned from Havana. From that moment until entering
an Embassy on 6 September 1962, subject lived “black”.

. -Subject proceeded to the outskirts of Santa Clara where a friend,

Efrain, WWAREN, resided,. His friend told him to go to Hivana. While
z driving to Havana Subject met another person who informed him that the
G-2 haa a roadblock on the highway at Colon, Matanzas, and that all cars
were being searched. On 24 July 1961, Subject went to a beach called
"GANUZA" located on the north coast of Las Villas near Corralillo.
Subject's sister has a home at "Ganuza" so he left his car there and
proceeded to Havana with some friends of his sister. Later the G-2
confiscated his auto, (It is interesting to note that the G-2, after
confiscating subject's auto at the beach, belicved that Subject had
departed from Cuba. Subject thereafter communicated with his wife by
sending her letters in jail via Miami where. they were postmarked).
