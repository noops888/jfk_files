half-brother of MARCOS, RAFAEL HUGET, and PEDRO DIAZ, former
Head of Cuban Revolutionary Air Fo: ce, met with MENOYO
at the Georgian Hotel, Atlanta. (UV,

MENOYO suggested that PEDRO DIAZ align himself
with forces in the Dominican Republic to overthrow FIDEL
CASTRO, also to attempt to kidnap ESTEBAN VENTURA, former
Lieutenant Colonel in Cuban National Police,‘and to return him
to Cuba. PEDRO DIAZ rejected both proposals, feeling they

POSSIBILITY THAT BATISTA MAY PARTICIPATE

On October 7, 1959, RICHARD B. JAFFE, PSI, Miami,
advised that ROLANDO MASFERRER said. that FULGENCIO BATISTA
indicated that he was going to give. financial assistance
to the Anti-CASTRO Movement. BATISTA indicated he is
anti-TRUJILLO and does not favor aid to the movement for the
TRUJILLO faction. BATISTA indicated that he liked JOSE
PEDRAZA, military leader of the movement in the Dominican
Republic, but feels that PEDRAZA is virtually a prisoner
of TRUJILLO in the Dominican Republic, and can never
become a strong figure in the Anti-CASTRO Movement, as long
as he remains in the Dominican Republic.)

On October 8, 1959, ALSIDES DE LOS REYES, 1674
S.W. 8th Street, Miami, (protect) advised that a
letter written by BATISTA indicated that his support
of the Anti-CASTRO Movement had caused some dissension
in Miami, inasmuch as BATISTA indicated he did not favor
EMILIO NUNEZ PORTUONDO as Provisional President of Cuba in
the event the CASTRO Government is overthrown. BATISTA
indicated a.preference for CARLOS MARQUES STERLING or
(FNU) MARTINEZ SAENZ, the latter being described as the
