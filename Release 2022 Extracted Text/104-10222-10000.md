Subject is so well qualified to mect the requirements of Nepyty ghiet of a large
area division that there may well be a tendency to lose sight of his dbulity to run an
organization of his own, This capability was amply demonstrated when he was chief

of the China Branch of FE Division,
Subject is unusually strong as a supervisor, His flair for warm but impartial

relationships with subordinates-hus enabled him to develop a first-hand understanding
of the capabilities, shortcomings and problems of a very large proportion of all FE
personnel, His direction of personnel does not lack firmness but is expressed in such
a way that feelings are considered and best results are achieved,

Subject's operational judgment ia entirely reliable, He has an encyclopedic know=
ledge and understanding of the Division's operations and a full grasp of political 5

implications throughout the area,
I have noted no weaknesses in Subject, which would inhibit his successful

assumption of increasing responsibilities.

and was assigned as the Southcast Asia Branch Chief in the
Far East Division. His ability to make decisions, work
effectively with both supervisors and subordinates, plus
his dependability, initiative and attenticn to the broader
aspects of his work were soon noted and have continued to
characterizre his long and productive career in the CIA.

In recognition of his long range potential, Mr, Broe
was assigned to Manila in 1951 as the Chief of Station.
In 1953 he wes transferred to the ixpertant post of Deputy
Chief of the China Mission Here his leadership
qualities were fully demonstrated. tis skill in directing
an imaginative, ive, operational program, while at
the same time tempering his actions with sature judgment and
smooth m: ement talent, marked hix as an officer who could

, 1. I wish to commend and make a matter of record the

outstanding Support. and guidance rendered to this organi-
zation by Mr. William V. Broe, Special Assistant to the

Ambassador, Tokyo, Japan, from the period-of July 1963 to

date.

2. Mr. Broets efforts in support of this organization
were exemplary. He gave freely of himself and of the re-
sources at his disposal. In those instances where we
were contemplating a new approach to obtaining aerospace.
data of priority national interest Mr, Broe provided for
briefings by his specialists in the denied areas under
consideration. His every approach was intended to intel-
digently present the information available ‘concerning the
difficulties to be encountered and rewerds to be expected.
He always left the United States Air Force personnel con-
cerned secure in the knowledge that he fully supported
any promising attempt lo acquire d. of national interest
and that he did all in hic power to expedite the acquisi-
tion of these data. This resulted in a most favorable
operating milieu.

3. In all of our dealings’with Mr. Broe, we found him to
be friendly, highly objective, unswerving in his demands
for professionalism, and a person of honor and integrity.
We liked, trusted and respected him. Mr. Broe's demon-
strated professionalism and ability to advise, stimulate
and coordinate the efforts of the many diverse elements
engaged in collection .of information reflected favorably
upon him and-the Intelligence Community of the United
tates. -
