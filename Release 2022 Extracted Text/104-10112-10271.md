Discussion dielt for some time on NOENAIR's experiences in

It 15 obvious that he would lilos another opportunity to work

on this problem. he said what, at the time he had more contact with

F2des CAStill than any othar journalists there because of his fluent

spanish. He thought that the good rapprt that he had had with Castro

might possibly at some future time be useful to the organization.

recalled one evening in the Sierra Maestra, when he sat alone at a

campilro with Castro, discussing with Castro his problems for a mattor

of four hours. Castro at that time was andous to have planes and

particularly wanted a hellocopter with an American pilot.

NOEMAYR

suggested the name of a friend of his in Dayton who could provide the

hallocopter and asked Castro shat he would be willing to pay. Castro

said he would pay $25,000 (US Currency) for the machine and the going

rate of salary for the pilot. NOEMAIl reported this matter to Head-

quarters and thought it unfortunata that this had not been capitalized

upon since KUBARI could have had a penetration in the Castro imer-

circle at this time 18 this proposal had been followed up.
