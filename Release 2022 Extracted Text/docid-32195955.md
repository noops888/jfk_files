“RE; INTERVIEW OF FORMER
FBI SPEGIAL AGENT (SA)
GEORGE C. MOORE BY
U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE
STAFF MEMBERS, 11/3/75"

“At 2:00 p.m. November 3, 1975 I appeared at the
Dirksen Senate Office Building at the request of Staff Member
Barbara Banoff to be interviewed with regard to the FBI
COINTELPRO.“

“The interview was conducted primarily by Banoff
assisted by Ms. Mary DeOreo and joined later by Staff Member
Mark Gitenstein. The interview was recorded by a ‘court’
reporter and I was advised of my rights and signed Peper to
that effect.”

"The highlights of the interview which lasted until
approximately 5:15 p.m. are as follows:

“The initial part covered ny duties, experience and
general information about the Bureau's structure and chain of
command. I was asked if I had been made Section Chief in 1967
by Mr. W. C. Sullivan because of my prior expérience in counter-
intelligence in the foreign field. I replied that I felt quite
sure that counterintelligence experience had no part in my
selection but was due to recommendations of my superiors -
then Section Chief W. R. Wannall and Branch Chief D. E. Moore.*

“The early thrust of the interview dealt te a large
extent with the climate of the times in 1967-1968-69 at which
time the COINTELPRO was intensified against the black extremists.

The Staff Members by their questions laid phe ‘round work, for
gusvers whieh. showed the Widlen lent t propensiei es SE st of the
targets at the time and the f on balance the program

was believed to have been effective in preventing additional
violence.”

With Respect to Intelligence Activities (SSC)

Res Interview of Former FBI special Agent (SA)
George C. Moore by SSC Staff Members

"Several documents were shown to me (memoranda which
initiated and intensified the program). It ‘is noted the Program
itself against the Black Extremists was initiated before I
beeame Section Chief. I stated, however, that I was fully
acquainted with the aims and goals and had actively participated
as Section Chief in implementing and in the administrative
supervision of same.” :

"A substantial amount of time was spent as to why
the 'civil rights organization’ Southern Christian Leadership
Conference (SCLC) headed by Dr. Martin Luther King was set
forth as a target both initially and later when a communication
was sent to all offices instructing that the program be intensi-
fied, I was able to furnish avery little information as to why
SCLG and King were targets in addition to the reasons stated
in the initial commmication.”

"The Staff Members indicated that they were not
troubled by the COINTEL targets who were violent prone but were
concerned about Dr. King and SCLC being made target.”

“another area of concern which involved rather a
substantial amount of questions concerned COINTEL tactics
whereby allegations were sponsored by the FBI re certain targets
being informants. The Staff Members pointed out their concern
with this tactic as it could result in physical violence being
directed against that particular person as a resilt of the FBI's
program. I pointed out that I was not aware of any such violence
ever having occurred and I was asked whether this was just luck
or because of fact that much consideration was given to such
tactics before approval. I agreed that perhaps luck did play
a part but all COINTEL proposal received a great deal of consid-
eration and scrutiny by top officials before approval as we
wanted to be sure we did not cause violence on any person,”

Re: Interview of Former FBI Special Agent (SA)

"I was asked if we ever discussed COINTEL at field
conferences and I advised that we usually discussed all key
programs including COINTEL and exchanged ideas in that regard,”

"As a matter of interest, I was asked at the end of
the interview whether I had discussed the interview with
anyone prior to appearing. I stated that I had discussed it
with SA Paul Daly in order to get proper clearance from the
Bureau.

"I was then asked if I would be in touch with any oe
one at the FBI after the interview. I indicated that I would _
be in touch with Daly whereupon the query was made as to 'why?' :
I advised them that after having served for over 31 years in
the FBI I felt I had an obligation to advise the Bureau on a
voluntary basis of the result of any inquiry such as this one
which was concerning activities and matters of interest to the

FBI.”

The Committee has asked me to talk with you
today about the future of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
I thought it might be helpful if I outline quite briefly
some of the points I would like to make, some of the
problems I think ought to be considered, and some of the
steps we have taken.

The first point is that the statutory base
for the operations of the Bureau cannot be said to be fully
satisfactory. The basic statutory provision is 28 USC
533 which provides that the Attorney General may appoint
officials "(1) to detect and prosecute crimes against the
United States; (2) to assist in the protection of the
President; and (3) to conduct such investigations regarding
official matters under the control of the Department of
Justice and the Department of State as may be directed by
the Attorney General." There are other statutes, such
as the Congressional Assassination, Kidnapping and Assault
Act, which vest in the Bureau special responsibilities to
investigate criminal violations. In addition, there are
Executive orders and Presidential statements or directives
which place investigatory responsibilities upon the Bureau.

A number of questions are often asked about this
statutory base. It has the virtue of simplicity, but the
Executive orders which deal with government employee

investigations are complicated and confusing, and Presidential

NW 68262 Docld:32195955 Page 20


Sap ae
memoranda or, perhaps, oral instructions from a President
may be difficult to collate. I think it is important,

in any case, to separate out the kinds of questions which

are asked about the Bureau's authority base. Some questions
are constitutional in nature, relating to the inherent power
of the President; others go to the interpretation of the
statutes and the relationship between the statutes and
Presidential directives; others go to the failure of the
statutes to define sufficiently the areas of the Bureau's
jurisdiction or to spell out sufficiently--and this is

partly constitutional--the means and methods which the Bureau
is permitted to use in carrying out its assigned tasks.

The second point, related to the first, is a
continuing discussion of the role of the Bureau in intelligence
investigations or domestic security investigations. The
argument is sometimes made that the Bureau's proper role,
at least in purely domestic matters, should be limited to
investigations of committed crimes. The basic statute for
the Bureau is broader than this, as have been Executive
orders and Presidential mandates to the Bureau. The basic
statute is broader. since it refers to investigations
regarding official matters under the control of the Department
of Justice and the Department of State as may be directed
by the Attorney General. A disparity is sometimes seen
among the different roles of the Bureau in crime detection,
in on-going domestic security matters, and in foreign

intelligence or foreign counterintelligence matters. In

NW 68262 Docld:32195955 Page 21


recent days a statement by the then. Attorney General Harlan
Fiske Stone, who reorganized the Bureau and chose J. Edgar
Hoover as its director, has been quoted as a relevant
warning. ,

Stone warned, "There is always the possibility
that a secret police may become a menace to free government ;
and free institutions, because it carries with it the
possibility of abuses of power which are not always quickly
apprehended or understood .... It is important that its
activities be strictly limited to the performance of those
functions for which it was created and that its agents
themselves be not above the law or beyond its reach ....

The Bureau of Investigation is not concerned with political
or other opinions of individuals. It is concerned only
with their conduct and then only with such conduct as is
forbidden by the laws of the United States. When a police
system passes beyond these limits, it is dangerous to the
proper administration of justice and to human liberty, which
it should be our first concern to cherish."

I should like to suggest that Stone's warning always
must be considered relevant to the proper conduct of the
Bureau's duties, but it does not necessarily follow that
domestic security investigations are, therefore, outside
the Bureau's proper functions. The detection of crime in
some areas requires preparation and at least some knowledge

of what is likely to be going on. What is at issue, I think,

NW 68262 Docld:32195955 Page 22


is the proper scope, the means and methods used, the attention
paid to conduct and not views, and the closeness of the
relationship of the conduct and that which is forbidden by
the laws of the United States.
Third, I realize that some proposals, since I
was asked about this when I last appeared before this
Committee, might enaeare out in some fashion domestic and
foreign intelligence functions from the FEI or from one
another within the FBI. This is, of course, an issue to
be looked at. I assume it is recognized that there may
be some relationship between that intelligence which is
domestic and that intelligence which is involved in foreign
counterintelligence work. One may lead to the other.
And there may be a relationship between foreign counter-
intelligence and foreign intelligence. If the work were
separated out into different agencies, I do not know if
the decision about when an investigation should pass
from one agency to another always could be made easily.
Moreover, even so, information presumably would pass from
one agency to the other. I know that one consideration
has been that it might be decided that information collected
by some permitted means in intelligence investigations
under some circumstances should not’ be used in criminal
: Prosecutions. But if there is an exchange of information,
this must always be a consideration, whether there are

separate agencies or not, and the basic question then is one

NW 68262 Docld:32195955 Page 23


of use and not organization. The more active concern,

I believe, is that there is a risk that conduct proper for

one area may be improper for another, and that the combination
can work a contamination. My view on this is that in any

case we must decide what conduct is appropriate and is
inappropriate for each of the areas, and we must take

steps to make sure that proper conduct is lived up to. My hope
is that the fact that the FBI has criminal investigative
responsibilities,which must be conducted within the confines
of constitutional protections strictly enforced by the courts,
gives the organization an awareness of the interests of
individual liberties that might be missing in an agency
devoted solely to intelligence work. I know the argument

can be run the other way. I believe the dangers are greater

if there is separation.

NW 68262 Docld:32195955 Page 24


Fourth, there is a question as to the proper role of
the FBI in crime prevention and whether or not it should be
considered authorized to take steps under some circumstances
to reduce the likelihood that crimes will be committed
or that serious injury to persons or property will occur.
Preventive action has raised serious questions and these
must be dealt with. I suppose an initial question is
whether it should be allowed at all. Yet I believe under
special circumstances and with proper controls most would
believe this to be a proper function,

Fifth, the problem of proper controls, supervision and

“ accountability is all-embracing. By statute the Federal

Bureau of Investigation is in the Department of Justice,
and also by statute the Attorney General is the head of the
Department of Justice. The history is mixed, of course, and
we all have a tendency to over-simplify, but it is a fair
statement that there have been times in the past when the
supervision by Attorneys General, granted that the Bureau must
have considerable autonomy, has been sporadic, practically
nonexistent, or ineffective. I hope that is not the case now.
The responsibility is a heavy one. But in any event the prob+
lem of proper controls, supervision and accountability goes
beyond the Director of the Bureau and the Attorney General.
I have already mentioned that in my view the statutory base for
the operations of the Bureau cannot be said to be fully satis-
factory. I think that better controls and performance can
be achieved through statutory means, executive orders, guide-

lines, and reporting to appropriate congressional committees.

NW 68262 Docld:32195955 Page 25


ee der
Sixth, before I come to a resume of some of the steps

which have been taken, let me say I know we all realize that

in the past there have been grave abuses. I am uncomfortable with

a kind of writing of history, however, which sees it only in terms

of the abuses and not in terms of past and present strength. It

is very difficult to be fair to the past in which many institutions

of government carried a share of responsibility. But more than

unfairness is involved. If we are not careful, we will turn to

solutions of the moment which a better reading of history might
indicate are not the best solutions. I know we must seize the
moment, if I may use such a phrase in this setting. I know also

that this Committee realizes that a very important agency with
dedicated, highly professional, greatly disciplined government
servants is involved. The importance is to the security and domestic
tranquility of the United States. Stone's warning was given in an
act of creation. He was proud of his creation. In spite of the
abuses, there is a proper place for pride. I take it our mutual
work should be to nurture that pride and the conditions which

justify it.

I turn now to a review of some of the steps which have been
taken or are in progress. We have tried most diligently, under safe-
guards to protect the privacy of individuals and with an awareness
of the unfairness of instant history, to give a great deal of informa-
tion to Congressional committees. Attorney General Saxbe made public
and Deputy Attorney General Silberman and Director Kelley testified
about the so-called COINTELPRO. When the FBI discovered evidence

of several more COINTELPRO projects after I

NW 68262 Docld:32195955 Page 26


became Attorney General, these were revealed. One of my first '
acts as Attorney General, my third week in office, was to testify
before a Congressional committee about possible incidents of

political misuse of the FBI by the White House in the past and

about the nature of FBI file-keeping systems, particularly the

files kept by Director Hoover in his office suite. Director Kelley

has spoken publicly and before congressional committees about incidents
in the past in which FBI agents engaged in break-ins to gather

or photograph physical evidence in intelligence investigations. On

a number of occasions, most recently in testimony before this
Committee, I have described the history of the use of electronic
surveillance by the FBI. We have welcomed such opportunities.

On February 26, 1975, I instructed Director Kelley to report to
me any requests made of the Bureau, or practices within the Bureau,
which he deems improper or which present the appearance of impropriety.
On February 28, 1975, Director Kelley ordered FBI personnel to report
such requests or practices to him. In July, 1975, I reaffirmed my
February directive and also asked for a report of all sensitive
investigative practices. The Director promptly complied.

Director Kelley has regularly provided information on conduct

by’ Bureau agents and programs underway within the Bureau that
could raise questions. These matters have been reviewed and
discussed within thé Deparmtinet so that a consistent and appro-
priate policy can behieved. This is a continuing process.

I do not assert that we are aware of everything about the Bureau.

Nor do I suggest that we ought to know everything. - Appropriate

NW 68262 Docld:32195955 Page 27


communication, consultation and supervision at this level
have to be selective. I make this point, which L think may
sound disconcerting, not in any way to minimize the respon-
sibility of the Bureau to keep the Department informed nor
to minimize the Department's duty to find out. Rather
I want to be realistic about a learning and organization
problem which requires realism if it is to be understood
and perfected.

With respect to possible legislation, the Department
has in preparation various drafts of possible bills which may
be of assistance in the area of what is now warrantless
electronic surveillance. Although cbtsining a judicial warrant
does not automatically eradicate the possibility of abuse,
it is perceived to be an important safeguard of individual
privacy interests, and we are exploring, as we said we would

do, various possibilities and alternatives.

NW 68262 Docld:32195955 Page 28

Finally, a committee within the Department of Justice --
chaired by Mary Lawton, Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the
Office of Legal Counsel, and composed of representatives of my
office, the Criminal and Civil Rights Divisions, the Office of
Policy and Planning, and the FBI -- has been working for eight
months reviewing FBI. procedures in many areas and drafting guide-
lines to govern those procedures in the future. The Committee has
produced draft guidelines covering White House inquiries,
congressional and judicial staff appointment investigations,
unsolicited mail, and domestic security investigations. It is
currently at work on guidelines covering counterespionage investi-
gations and will later consider the use of informants, the employee
loyalty program, organized crime intelligence investigations,
criminal investigations, and other aspects of FBI practice.

The Committee's work has been extensive and time-consuming. It
has involved not only questions of proper safeguards but also of
efficiency in the proper functioning of the Bureau. It has

been an effort to translate into words the complicated and
important mechanisms for controlling the FBI. I hope the
Committee's efforts at articulation will be of use to this Com-
mittee and others as it considers drafting legislation. ‘

You have received copies of the latest drafts of the
guidelines that have been substantially completed by the Committee.
These guidelines do not yet represent Department policy. There
is disagreement within the Department on some aspects of these

guidelines. I have disagreed with the Committee ‘recommendations

from time to time, and the FBI has raised substantial questions
about other recommendations--particularly with respect to the
treatment of unsolicited mail. Some of the proposals in the
guidelines could be promulgated as departmental regulations.
Congress may feel some ought to be enacted into statutory law.
Other provisions would require implementation by executive order.
I would be glad to discuss these draft guidelines with
you in detail in response to your questions, but a brief discussion
of the guidelines on domestic security may be useful at the outset.
The guidelines begin by attempting to impose some order

and definiteness to the domestic security field. To begin

“with, these guidelines do not deal with FBI efforts to counter-

act the work of foreign intelligence services operating within

the United States. Standards for determining when there is
foreign involvement sufficient to place a subject in the category
of foreign counterintelligence investigation are now being debated
within the guidelines committee. The domestic security guidelines
also are not meant to cover security or background investigations
of federal appointees or investigations of ordinary crimes. Under
the draft guidelines, domestic security investigations are only

to be authorized when there is a likelihood that the activities

of individuals or groups involve or will involve the use of force
or violence in violation of federal law. Domestic security inves-
tigations are to be limited to activities of individuals or groups
intended to accomplish one of five purposes: overthrowing the
government of the United States or of a State; interfering with

the activities within the United States of foreign governments

or their representatives; influencing government policies by inter-
fering by force or violence with government functions or interstate
commerce; depriving individuals of their civil rights; and creating
domestic violence or rioting when such violence or rioting would
necessitate as a countermeasure the use of Federal armed forces.
There is also a provision for limited investigation when there is a
clear and immediate threat of domestic violence which is likely to
result in a request by a state for Federal armed assistance.

Currently there is no procedure requiring the review outside the
FBI of all domestic intelligence investigations conducted by the FBI,
though the FBI has a long-standing policy of reporting its investi-
gative findings to the Criminal Division. ‘Under the draft guidelines
there would be a comprehensive program of reporting to the Attorney
General or his designee of all preliminary and full domestic intel-
ligence investigations. The Attorney General would be required under
the draft guidelines to put a stop to any full investigation whose:
justification did not meet an established standard. The standard
would be that there must be specific and articulable facts giving reason
to believe that the individual or group under inves-
tigation is engaged in the activities I have just listed.

Another feature of the draft guidelines is to place
strict controls upon the use of any technique by the FBI which
goes beyond the gathering of information. COINTELPRO was the
name given the use of some such techniques. As I have said
before, some of the activities in COINTELPRO were outrageous

and the others were foolish. Nonetheless, there may be circum-

stances involving an immediate risk to human life or to extraordin-

arily, important government functions that could only be
countered by some sort of preventive action. The’ guidelines
require that any such: preventive action proposal be submitted
to the Attorney General. He could authorize the preventive
action only when there is probable cause to believe that the
violence is. imminent’ and when such measures are necessary to
minimize the danger to life or property. The preventive action
would in all cases have to be nonviolent. The Attorney General
would be required to report to Congress periodically and no less

often than once a year on the use of preventive action by the

- FBI.

I make no claim that during this rather difficvlt but

interesting and--I must trust--promising period we have

achieved all that might have been possible. In many ways the

work has been disappointingly slow. But I do think we have

made advances in nurturing and helping to improve a structure

which will be supportive of the best efforts of the men and

.women in the Department of Justice and in the Federal Bureau of

Investigation. No procedures are fail-safe against abuse.
The best protection remains the quality and professionalism of

the membersof the Bureau and of the Department.
