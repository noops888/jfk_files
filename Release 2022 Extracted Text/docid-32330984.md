Through further inquiry at the bank, it was

ascertained that SNFE officials were bypassing the account

by sending through any sizable checks

"for collection"

previously indicated that various delegations had been

transmitting funds to the national headquarters and 1t 1s

"Cuba"

Adequate documentation of these publications is contained in

this

report and all copies

of these publications are furnished to

Miami by MM 847-S.

Bureau airtel May 11, 1964, instructed that appropriate

informants and sources be alerted to furnish any information

Indicating the SNFE is planning to leave for invasion or

infiltration of Cuba. MM 847-S has been instructed frequently

and at regular intervals to immediately furnish any information

indicating imminent action of this type on the part of the SNFE.

He is fully aware of the importance of doing this and of the

Bureau's, interest.

Other Cuban sources have been alerted to

appropriately fumish such Information. (94
