Disposition — This document was denied. .Thé document is-a memo.

-which recites the speculative thinking of an Agency officer on-the assassination

of President Kennedy. The paper deals-with a possible explanation of the
assassination. He treats the problem experimentally with a thesis which is .
not bor out by faéts available then or later developed. The thinking
expressed was imaginative but not definitive. No decision was based on

this paper’ It appears clearly to be the type of documents contemplated for
exemption under subsection )(5). The document also relates information *
received from a{foreign liaisonservice. It contains information from and
about a sensitivé source. The document also identifies Agency officers and
components ant coatzins internal Agency fling instructions. This denial
was made under the authority of exemptions (b)(1), (b)(2), (b) (3) and

(b) (5).

From:

Subject: “Cable from(Chief, SR Division, re Possible KGB role

1. ‘he following 1s the(text of a cable from Chief, SR Division, sent
via closed from Fre at 23162) on 23 November, for the attention
of (fr. Angleton:

"1. I desire that you consider these reactions to the Kennt
assassination: oe

8. Within minutes of the first news, Moscow radio statements
fas heard in London pttributed the assassination to “right~
ing elements." as the true identity of the believed
assassin became known did Moscow begin to complain that
U.S. reactionaries were using Oswald as a pawn.

b. (sno not the assiguent of 13th Dept. officers to the KGB
sidency in the United Nations in New York be considered
in a new light?)
os oe
ce. (i atscoverea sronf ft Martin (of ME-5)| during our long
exceptional; ble discussions; that one of Harold
Wilson's principal scientific advisors is Captain Ian Maxwell,
B who has a long Soviet intelligence background. This may
shed new light on AELADIE's report /I.e., that Harold Wilson
be a Soviet, egentZ) :

2. Ceutting it baldly, was Oswald, unwittingly or wittingly, part of
‘a plot to murder President Kennedy in Dalles as an attempt to
further exacerbate sectional strife and render the U.8. Government
less capable of dealing with Soviet initiatives over the next

art) f f ABLADLE's views on Wilson and the information noted im
jparagrabh le above have any substance (and they cannot be ignored)
this suggests that we can expect major Soviet pressures over the

next seyeral months, for which the Soviets have made careful,
long-range preparations .Y

2. Gre above reférence to 13th Dept. officers in New York refers to the
foresence, reported by an FBI penetration of the KGB locally, in New York or
Washington of one or two known officers of the 13th Department of the lst Chief
Directorate (Foreign Intelligence) of the KGB. This department is charged with
"liquid affairs," sabotage and assassination. of the 13th cers,

the Soviet student is also a 13th Dept. officer or agent. Perhaps
significantly, his course of studies was in food chemistry!

3. \You will note that Mr. Murphy's comments come without benefit of
traces we passed to you earlier today, ‘that Oswald had contact,
th a 13th Dept. representative in Mexico City.

4. (another recently-arrived cable, being sent to the Director tonight,
feuggests that Oswald's business with the Soviet Consul was connected with his
own visa to the USSR and Cuba (in transit) and may, therefore, have been
really rather then ostensibly innocent.
