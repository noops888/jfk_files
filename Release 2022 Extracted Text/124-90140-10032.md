Mrs. Jane Koman, CLA, on July 13,

Wery disturbed

because he has not been contacted by the Agency.

It was emphasized to Mrs. Roman that certain commitments allegedly

had been made to Sanchez and he is waiting for action

Mrs. Roman conferred with other CIA representatives and

advised that the Agency had nof been able to arrange the proper

type of assignment for Sanchez but definitely was very much

interested in him. She further stated that a CIA

official would

be contacting Sanchez in the very near future

Based upon tis discussions at CIA, the Liaison Agent

received the impression that this matter is being very poorly

handled by the Agency. It has an excellent opportunity to acquire

the services of an unusual source but certainly does not appear to ab

be giving this the proper type of attention.

did not have an assignment arranged for Sanchez, CIA at least coula

be maintaining contact with him

that his attitude would continue

to be friendly and cooperative

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED

HEREIN IS UNCGASSIFIED EXCEPT
