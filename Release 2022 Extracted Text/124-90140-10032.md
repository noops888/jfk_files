YOR,

|: Reference is made to memorandum tee ae 10, 1961, 5

q from Mr. D. E. Moore to Mr. Sullivan. We previously had made. §5

i Raitadie to Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) information a

h ncerning the subject, who offered excellent potential as a 3

q source for CIA in itg,foreign operations. CIA established o

q contact with [SanchezMhd allegedly made certain commitments =e

Pursuant to instructions, the Liaison Agent .jnf ormed
firs. Jane Roman, CIA, on July 13, 1961, that (Sanchez] s become |
ery disturbed because he has not been contacted by the Agency.
It was emphasized to Mrs. Roman that certain racti tata allegedly 1
J

i

had been made to [Sanchez and he is waiting for acti
Ss

Mrs. Roman conferred with other CIA representatives and
advised that the Agency_had nof, been able to arrange the proper
type of assignment for [SanchezfMbut definitely was very much
interested in him. She furthér stated that a CIA official would
be contacting [Sanchez] in the very near future

‘S

Based upon his discussions at cIA, the Liaison Agent

received the impression that this matter is being very poorly
handled by the Agency. It has an excellent,.opportunity to acquire ae
the services of an unusual source but certainly does not appear to ah :
be giving this the proper type of attention. Even if the Agency
did not have an assignment arranged for Ganchez}etIA at least could
be maintaining contact with him so that his attitude would continue
to be friendly and cooperative 2) ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED

ACTION: WHERE SHOWN OTHERWISE.
