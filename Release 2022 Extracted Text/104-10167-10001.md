jl) feet with MOJAL and ROMAULDI's contact would be continued only for the: purpose of ee
wonitoring, and that to the extent possible CIA assets would be used to negate i
MOJAL's activities. He also mentioned that Tony VARGIA-had said he would talk to: -<
MAJAL from tine to time in order to be informed of what MAL was doing, but he
bed no idea of including WAL, or eny af bis group, in the FAD compléx. “Mr. ae
