of June, 1963, resided at 1868 S.W. 13th Street,

Miami;

Florida, and who was reported to the Miami Office at

that time to be operating a short wave radio station at

that address. Contact was made on July 16, 1963 with

Mr. JOSEPH VIDAL Of CIA, Miami, at which time he advised

that JUAN MESA RODRIGUEZ was of operational interest to

his agency; was residing at 1868 S.W. 13th Street with

his family, and was out of the country as of July 16,

1963, and not expected to return until July 24, 1963.

This information is set forth in Miami file 105-7969.760GP(W)

Efforts to locate a file on JUAN MESA in the

files of U.S. INS, Miami, have thus far met with negative

results. MESA, as described by MM I-l, is a man in his

early 40s, who had a radio business in Cuba and who

speaks Spanish and English fluently.

that telephone #444-8751 had been listed to JUAN M.

RODRIGUEZ at 1868 S.W. 13th Street, Miami.. This phone

was disconnected on June 6, 1964 and a new telephone,

#238-6863, listed to RODRIGUEZ at 9910 Pan American

had indicated his employment as "U.S% Government Public

Relations" and a reference as MAURICE SHORAGO, telephone

HI 8-8320.

The above was furnished to SA LEMAN I.

STAFFORD, JI.

It is to be noted that MM Tol of this report

is an officer in the anti-CASTRO organization, Frank

Pais Revolutionary Movement (FPRM). He has advised

that in addition to being personally acquainted with

JUAN MESA, MESA has sought to include him in the acti-

vities of

OSAG, because the FPRM has considerable Cuban

exile man power, which MM I-l states have various skills

which might be utilized by OSAC. One such person is

"PEPE"XTUNCO,

whom MM Tol states is proficient in setting

up. remote control apparatus.

MM T-1 has stated he has the impression that

considerable financial support is being received by

OSAC from American citizens, and he is not clear as to

the motivation. He stated that he also has the im-

pression that the operations of OSAC are being conducted

through liaison with CIA, [He stated he is aware that

JUAN MESA in the past has worked closely with CIA. 5-1,

He also advised that at the meeting of OSAC

NELSON RODRIGUEZ.

RODRIGUEZ operates a black compact

car, believed of English make.

On July 13, 1964, MM T-1 accompanied Agent:

in an attempt to locate the home where the OSAC meet-

ing of July 8, 1964 occurred. MM T-l pointed out the

at the southwest corner of Douglas

Road and Stewart Avenue, in Coconut Grove, Miami. MM T-1

stated he believed this was a CIA "safe house,' because (S

no one seemed to live there, although it was furnished

and contained several telephones.

Also on July 13, 1964, MM I-l pointed out

the residence at 743 Sistina, Coral Gables, Florida, as

the home at which he believed one of the American

attorneys was dropped off after attending the meeting

at the house in Coconut Grove.

The September, 1963 telephone directory lists

MELVIN MY GREENBERG, an attorney with office in the

duPont Building, Miami, as resident at 743 Sistina,

Coral Gables.) Fla.

In addition to the foregoing, MM T-1 advised

that he believes that Cuban exile ENRIQUE, CASADOX CUERVO,

Bureau file 105-68231, Miami file 105-8032, may be work-

ing with OSAC out of Puerto Rico. He said he deduced

this inasmuch as there had been reference by JUAN MESA

to ARGELIO (LNU), the friend of CASADO.

It is to be noted that the Miami file on

CASADO reflects he has a close friend named ARGELIO

GONZALEZ, and also that CASADO had a boat named the

ESCATUTA•

The Miami file further reflects that ENRIQUE

CASADO as of June, 1964, was residing at Las Flores,#300

On July 21, 1964, STANLEY SCHACHTER, U.S.

Customs, Miami, advised he

possessed no information

concerning OSAC and he did not know of any boats which

JUAN MESA might have an interest in.

On July 21, 1964, Captain JOHN LOWRY, Merrill-

Stevens Drydock Company, 1270 N.W. 11th Street, Miami,

Florida, advised he is well acquainted with all the

vessels given berth in Merrill-Stevens facilities in

Miami, but had no knowledge of a boat fitting the des

cription of 75 to 80' which was berthed at 17th

Avenue and the Miami River, according to information

received from MM T-1 of this report.

Captain LOWRY

also advised he was not familiar with the name JUAN

MESA.

On July 22, 1964, MM I-I said he believed

OSAC may be utilizing MARCELINO GARCIA of MIRR to ob-

tain a bomb or torpedo. He said GARCIA is secretive

but apparently has contact with someone, Cuban or

American, in the Carolinas whereby he may be able to

obtain a

bomb or torpedo.

MM T-1 was advised that on July 20, 1964, JUAN

MESA and "TONY" ARANGO were interviewed at approximately

9:00 AM and 3:00 PM, respectively. MM T-1 said he

planned to tell MESA he was visited by an FBI Agent,

name unknown, on July 20, 1964, and was worried because

of questions

about OSAC, although revealing nothing to

Agent.

This arrangement is believed desirable for pro-

tection of MM T-1.
