that telephone #444-8751 had been listed to JUAN M.
RODRIGUEZ at 1868 S.W. 13th Street, Miami. This phone
was disconnected on June 6, 1964 and a new telephone,

It is to be noted that MM T-1 of this report
is an officer in the anti-CASTRO organization, Frank
Pais Revolutionary Movement (FPRM). He has advised
that in addition to being personally acquainted with 2
JUAN MESA, MESA has sought to include him in the acti-
vities of OSAC, because the FPRM has considerable Cuban é
exile man power, which MM T-1 states have various skills
which might be utilized by OSAC. One such person is
“PEPESUUNCO, whom MM T-1 states is proficient in setting
up. remote control apparatus. ‘

MM T-1 has. stated he has the impression that \
considerable financial support is being received by
OSAC from American citizens, and he is not clear as. to
the motivation. He stated that he also has the im- :
pression that the operations of OSAC are being conducted
through liaison with CIA, [He stated he is aware that
JUAN MESA in the past has worked closely with CIA./é.;

in an attempt to locate the home where the OSAC meet-
ing of July 8, 1964 occurred. MM T=1 pointed out the
house, located at the southwest corner of Douglas
Road and Stewart Avenue, in Coconut Grove, Miami, MM T-1
stated he believed this was fa CIA "safe house,"| because/s
no one seemed to live there, although it was furnished
and contained several telephones.

ing with OSAC out of Puerto Rico. He said he deduced
this inasmuch as there had been reference by JUAN MESA

It is to be noted that the Miami file on
CASADO reflects he has a close friend named ARGELIO
(SP AGONZALEZ,. and also that CASADO had a boat named the
oY ESCATUTA. The Miami file further reflects that ENRIQUE

up on the Cuban beach, resulting in charges against

attorneys are reportedly involved. Mr. DuBOIS stated
he would check into the matter and further advise. ‘BPVGO

On July 21, 1964, STANLEY SCHACHTER, U.S.
Customs, Miami, advised he possessed no information
concerning OSAC and he did not know of any boats which
JUAN MESA might have an interest in.

On July 21, 1964, Captain JOHN LOWRY, Merrill-
Stevens Drydock Company, 1270 N.W. 11th Street, Miami,
Florida, advised he is well acquainted with all the
vessels given berth in Merrill-Stevens facilities in
Miami, but had no knowledge of a boat fitting the des-
cription of 75 to 80' which was berthed at 17th
Avenue and the Miami River, according to information
received from MM T-1 of this report. Captain LOWRY
also advised he was not familiar with the name JUAN
MESA.

On July 22, 1964, MM T-1 said he believed
OSAC may be utilizing MARCELINO GARCIA of MIRR to ob-
tain a bomb or torpedo. He said GARCIA is secretive
but apparently has contact with someone, Cuban or
American, in the Carolinas whereby he may be able to
obtain a bomb or torpedo.

MM T-1. was advised that on July 20, 1964, JUAN
MESA and "TONY'' ARANGO were interviewed at approximately
9:00 AM and 3:00 PM, respectively. MM T-1 said he
planned to tell MESA he was visited by an FBI Agent,
name unknown, on July 20, :1964, and was worried because
of questions about OSAC, although revealing nothing to
Agent. This arrangement is believed desirable for pro-
tection of MM T-1.
