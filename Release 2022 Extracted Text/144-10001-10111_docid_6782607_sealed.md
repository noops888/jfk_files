Following is the text of a Royal Government commmique™ pub-
lished today: ~~ : :

"On 11 December 1963, the United States Government, through
its Ambassador in Phnom Penh, protested to the Royal Government
regarding the Information Department communique’ which is reported
to have expressed Cambodia's pleasure at the deaths of NGO DINH
DIEM, NGO DINH NHU, SARIT THANARAT, and President KENNEDY, The
Royal GOvernment, after having consulted the Cambodian and French
texts broadcast by RADIODIFFUSION NATIONALE or published by the
Information Ministry, clarifies for international opinion that
no allusion was made to the tragic death of President KENNEDY on
the occasion of the comments on the death of SARIT THANARAT, On
the contrary, it must be remembered that Cambodia observed three
days of national mourning out of respect for the deceased President
and that His Highness the Premier represented the Chief of State
at the funeral in Washington, It is, therefore, absurd to claim
that Cambodia has not paid due homage to the memory of the noble
President of the United States.

It mist be admitted that the feelings experienced by the
Cambodian people upon hearing of the deaths of NGO DINH DIEM and
SARIT THANARAT may be different. In fact, although President
KENNEDY was unanimously respected by all Cambodians in spite of the
injustice of American policy toward Cambodia, the South Vietnamese
and Thai dictators, who were the implacable enemies of our inde-
pendence, could arouse nothing but general hostility from our
countrymen, There is a nuance which American diplomats and observers
seem not to understand in the sentiments expressed in the past few

days by the Cambodian people. Our joy and pleasure are caused, not
by the deaths of NGO DINH DIEM and SARIT THANARAT, but by our
liberation from the threats and humiliations which they symbolized
in their lifetimes [1 wd G] peaceful Cambodia was obliged

to suffer for long years, The hypreerisyof certain great Western
powers is totally foreign to us. NGO DiNH DIEM and SARIT E z
THANARAT never respected the most elementary rules of international
life [10G]. Consequently, we are in no way constrained-to display
an attitude which does not correspond with our feelings. [XxM/G]
the meaning of the demonstration of popular relief which offend the
United States so greatly. This said, Cambodia has no lessons in
propriety to learn: from countries said to be developed, where
racism breaks out from time to time in demonstrations of violence
which Cambodia has never known and will never know",

Please communicate’ the Royal Government's statement to the
State Department and protest energetically against the expression
“barbarous declaration" used by that Ambassador [sic] YOST,
calling attention tc the consequences which may result from this grave
insult to Cambodia's honor and dignity, for which the United
States Government [XM/G] the sole responsibility.
