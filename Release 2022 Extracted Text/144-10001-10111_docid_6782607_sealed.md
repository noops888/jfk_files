Following is the text of a Royal Government commmique pub-

lished today:

"On 11 December 1963, the United States Government, through

its Ambassador in Phnom Penh, protested to the Royal Government

regarding the Information Department communique

which is reported

to have expressed Cambodia's pleasure at the deaths of NGO DINH

DIEM, NGO DINH NHU, SARIT THANARAT, and President KENNEDY. The

Royal GOvernment, after having consulted the Cambodian and French

texts broadcast by RADIODIFFUSION NATIONALE or published by the

Information Ministry, clarifies for international opinion that

no allusion was made to the tragic death of President KENNEDY on

the occasion of the comments on the death of SARIT THANARAT. On

the contrary, it must be remembered that Cambodia observed three

days of national mourning out of respect for the deceased President

and that His Highness the Premier represented the Chief of State

at the funeral in Washington.

It is, therefore, absurd to claim

that Cambodia has not paid due homage to the memory of the noble

President of the United States.

It must be admitted that the feelings experienced by the

Cambodian people upon hearing of the deaths of NGO DINH DIEM and

SARIT THANARAT may be different. In fact, although President

KENNEDY was unanimously respected by all Cambodians in spite of the

injustice of American policy toward Cambodia, the South Vietnamese

and Thai dictators, who were the implacable enemies of our inde-

pendence, could arouse nothing but general hostility from our

countrymen. There is a nuance which American diplomats and observers

seem not to understand in the sentiments expressed in the past few

days by the Cambodian people. Our joy and pleasure are caused, not

by the deaths of NGO DINH DIEM and SARIT THANARAT, but by our

liberation from the threats and humiliations which they symbolized

in their lifetimes [1 wd G] peaceful Cambodia was obliged

to suffer for long years. The hyprocrisy of certain great Western

powers is totally foreign to us. NGO DINH DIEM and SARIT

THANARAT never respected the most elementary rules of international

life [10G]. Consequently, we are in no way constrained to display

an attitude which does not correspond with our feelings. [XM/G]

the meaning of the demonstration of popular relief which offend the

United States so greatly. This said, Cambodia has no lessons in

propriety to learn from countries said to be developed, where

racism breaks out from time to time in demonstrations of violence

which Cambodia has never known and will never know".

Please communicate the Royal Government's statement to the

State Department and protest energetically against the expression

"barbarous declaration" used by that Ambassador [sic] YOST,

calling attention to the consequences which may result from this grave

insult to Cambodia 's honor and dignity, for which the United

States Government [XM/G] the sole responsibility.
