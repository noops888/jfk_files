Remarks:

Per Ray Rocca's notes, we had expected a

change in the reference to joini AY
[ _—s| in Hoong Kong on page 95. I talked

to wir. Goons (Snyder's associate) who:said

. that according to their notes this was an item
which Hunt had agreed to consider; but the
publisher objected so strongly to each deletion
that Hunt acceded on this one not feeling in his
own mind that it was that serious or that he
had made a commitment to do,othex than con-
sider our wishes on it.
