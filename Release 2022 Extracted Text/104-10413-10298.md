fhe attached LIFEAT Project Renewal Request, as prepared
in project outline form by the Mexico City Station, is
forwarded for approval.

1. jectives:

The objective of this project is to provide,
through a unilateral \telephone tap operation, information
on the activities of selected individuals and groups in
response to both Station needs and Headquarters requests.

a

@. LIEMBRACE-8 who normally functions under the
MECHARITY Project was actively employed in the technical
phase of the operation during the home leave period of
principal outside case officer, David M. WILSTED.

b. During the pest project year, 5 indigenous
basehouse keepers were dropped from the project. LIFEUD-14
and LIFEUD-17, 2 married couple, decided on separation and
eventual divorce, thus making the continuance of their
basehouse keeping duties impossible. LIFEUD-22 and LIFEUD-23,
son and mother, occupy a basehouse that was originally
intended to be used for LIFEAT but is being used only in
another operation. LIFEUD-27 was granted a POA during
‘the project year but was never recruited.

c. Three new agents have beer employed siace the
last project renewal. LIFEUD-24 1s an old friend of
WILSTED's who will be used as a basehouse keeper and trans-
lator along with LIFEUD-26 who is his wife. LIFEUD-25,
the wife of LIFEUD-4 had been included in her husband's
clearance but has now received her own clearance as #
basehouse keeper. :

4. Intel1: Production:

Although the emphasis of the LIFEAT Project is
on Station operational support, the project “May 1963
was totally or partially responsible for 31 positive infor
mation reports of which 29 were dissemiuated. Of the

AREVALO Bermejo or his
B Etfectiveness:

The LIFEAT Project is a model telephone tap
operation, During the last project year LIFEAT continued
to actively support the operations of the Station by
providing leads and information on selected targets.

In addition to this mission the project provided on a
regular basis valuable information on active Soviet intell-
Agence officers, the Polish and Yugoslav official install-
ations and personnel, selected Cuban personnel (10 lines) ,”
Anerican Communists in Mexico, Mexican leftists iets and, exile
groups in Mexico. In the latter fir the intensi:

ose jo was perticularly

rewarding. It is believed that the support provided other
Station operations, the CI/CE information and leads, the
ability of the unilateral) LIFEAT operation to cover sensi-
tive targets without revealing Station interests fo G2

In the past year as in tle past few years the
greatest problems have concerned the security of the operation
and equipment. The current problems center on two devel-
