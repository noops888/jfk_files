She furnished the following information as to the circumstances
connected with her employment with the Soviet Purchasing Commission in
Vancouver: 5

Shortly prior to accepting the above employment with the Purchasing
Commission, that office had employed a Mrs. HAMILTON who had left for
personal reasons and the Commission had advertised locally for a replacement.
At the same time ALEXANDER E. NAZAROV, a member of the Commission, was
residing temporarily with one HUCALUK or HOCALUK at 812 Keefer Street, who
was proprietor of the Windsor Shoe Repairing Store. She said that Mr.
HOCALUK was a personal friend of hers and that he suggested that she apply
for the position with the Purchasing Commission as she had a good knowledge
of the Russian language.

Miss BELOBRODSKI said the only members of the Purchasing Commission
in Vancouver during her employment there were:

ALEXANDER E. NAZAROV;
PETER P. GAVRILOV; and
SERGEI G. LUKIANOV.

She maintained that no other stenographic help was employed at
that time and said her work was extremely light and consisted principally
of translating English documents into Russian and that these documents
mainly pertained to business between the Purchasing Commission and the
Empire Shipping Company at Vancouver, B. C.

Miss BELOBRODSKI further maintained that the three members of the
staff usually attended to their own correspondence to which she was not given
access. As far as she was concerned, her business was confined solely to
ona fide transactions dealing with the shipoing of material from Canada to
the Soviet Union. According to T-l1, Miss BELOBRODSKI was unable to give any

reliability, advised that one LUKIANOV, member of the Soviet
Government Purchasing Commission in the United States,

was one of a number of Soviet Government officials who

were then engaged in espionage in the United States. It

is believed that this individual is identical with

SERGEI GRIGORIEVICH LUKIANOV, who was a member of the
Soviet Government Purchasing Commission in the United
States from about 1943 to 1945 at which time he was
transferred and became Chief of the Soviet Purchasing
Commission in Vancouver, Be Co, Canadas nnn] Under existing laws

LUKIANOV is believed to have departed from Canada

on September 23, 1946 in route to Moscow via New York.
He departed from New York on October 23, 1960
According to records of the United States State
Department, he returned to the United States in

January 1919 as Secretary to the Soviet Delegation

to the International Conference on Wheat and

remained in this country until March 25, 19h9.

he was engaged in intelligence activities.

ship with the Canadian Soviet Friendship League, also known as Canadian
Soviet Friendship Society and also with the Federation of Russian-Canadians.

by a friend and remained due to the fact she found it most interesting
and instructive and she was able to contact interesting people. She said
she was interested in art, drama, and travel and in that organization she
met people of similar tastes.

With respect to the Federation of Russian-Canadians, Miss
BELOBRODSKI informed T-1 that her mother who could speak no English and her
father had joined this organization shortly after their arrival in Canada
for the purpose of maintaining friendship with people of the same national

she was able to study the mandolin. She claimed she had held no office
in either the Canadian Soviet Friendship League or in the Federation of

in the Polish Democratic Society other than he was a members

T-1 advised that Miss BELOBRODSKI claimed no connection with the
Canadian Soviet Friendship League as of March 1950, however, her name ae
of that time still appeared on the letterheads of this organization. T-1
stated, however, this might have little significance as it was known that
this organization constantly continued to use the names of individuals
who had long since severed their connections with the organization.

by the American Can Company where she was then employed in March 1950.

(The Russian American Society (RAS), mentioned hereafter, has
been designated by the Attorney General of the United States pursuant to
Executive Order 10150.)

ONICK expressed the belief that he initially associated with the
Russian American Society in 195 when he attended social functions of the
Russian American Society at the Russian Embassy, San Francisco. He stated
that he might have attended one or two other social gatherings of the
Russian American Society after 195. He observed that he had never been
a member of the Russian American Society and that he participated in the
social functions "for the purpose of a social activity." ONICK advised
that from approximately 192 until 195, his mother and father were associated
with the Russian American Society for the purpose of giving aid and
assistance in the manner of old cothing for the Russian people. He expressed
the belief that they were not Russian American Society members although they
were closely associated with the Russian American Society. He advised

hall on Divisadero Street in San Francisco. He stated that neither of his
parents had been officials of the Russian American Society but that on
ceremonial occasions his father had been selected to hold the Russian flag

because he had an old Russian peasant costume.

during World War II, but terminated her activity in about 19L5.

Russian American Society had served its purpose as a World War IT
Russian aid group and his father, therefore, ceased participation in
Russian American Society social functions.

ONICK stated that he had never contributed financially to the
Russian American Society but expressed the belief that he had donated old
clothes to the Society. He stated that none of his relatives have had
any connection with the Russian American Society since his father's
withdrawal in approximately 1915, to the best of his knowledge.

ONICK observed that he initially met VALENTINA BELOBRODSKI in
June or July 1951, in Vancouver, B. C., and that he became acquainted
with her through his aunt, ANNA BORDEN, an earlier acquaintance of his
wife. He stated he saw VALENTINA nearly every weekend from Christmas,
195) until their marriage in April 1955. She was then employed as a Research
Chemist at the American Can Company and had held that position for about

arrived in Canada when she was six years of age. She is presently a
Canadian citizen. He advised that he was not acquainted with any organiza-
tional affiliation on the part of his wife.

ONICK was asked if he would care to make a statement concerning
his beliefs regarding Communism and he advised that "There may be something
good about it, there may be something good about the English Government
or any other government or, on the other hand, there may be something
bad about it. I have never hada taste of it so I really don't know." He
indicated that some people may like Commnism as a form of government
and "some people may not, but it is completely foreign to my own type of
government." He was asked if he believed Commnism would be a threat to
the American way of Life and he stated, "Commnism is not a threat to
the American way of life, there is not any reason to be scared of them,
that's for sure." He was questioned regarding his sentiments concerning
legislation outlawing the Commnist Party and he advised that "as far as
I am concerned it makes no difference to me because I am not interested
in it.”
