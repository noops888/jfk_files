The "Chicago's American" dated January 3, 1963,

contained an article entitled, !

"Mob's Arson Racket

Hinted

in Cafe Blazes."

The article

stated that the State

Fire Marshal's Office had begun investigating a suspected

crime syndicate arson racket in the west suburbs.

It

was learned that William J. Cowhey, State Fire Marshal,

suspects hoodlum involvement in a score of restaurant

and tavern fires since 1961 and had ordered his staff

to look for evidence connecting the blazes with fire-

insurance

payments.

Chief targets of the Fire Marshal's

investigation, according to the article, are Ernest

"Rocky" Infelice, 41, crime syndicate enforcer and ex-convict;

and John Tano, a

minor figure

with an arrest record.

Tano, 48, claims to be owner of Pedicone's Restaurant;

7729

43rd. Street, Lyons, which burned mysteriously

January 1, 1963, at night, causing an estimated $100,000

damage.

Infelice, according, to the article, has been

named by employees of various restaurants as the behind-

the-scenes boss of three restaurants that have gone up

in smoke since January, 1961, according to police.

The

restaurants are:

Tano admitted that the owners of record were his sister and

her husband.

Tano is the second restaurant operator to die

of an apparent heart attack in connection with a recent

fire.

The first was Jack Newman, 62, who died while

watching the Lido Motel-Guest

House Restaurant in Leyden

Township, partly destroyed in

a $100,000 fire December 26th.

Information was received fron a confidential

source on December 28, 1962, that the fire at the Lido

Motel on the night of December 25, 1962, was an arson

job either personally handled by Rocky Infelice and his

associates or by someone hired by them. Informant stated

that they had already made arrangements prior to the fire,

to take over the Golden Host, located on Mannheim Road,

a short distance away from the Lido Motel.

Informant further stated that Americo Di Pietto,

a close associate of Rocky Infelice and active in the

operation of the Guest House at the Lido Motel, recently

made the remark that the Guest House fire "took 40 gallons

of gasoline".

(CG 6407-C, 12/28/52, to SA LENARD A. WOLF)

During way, 1962, a confidential informant of

the Chicago Office advised

that the Guest House, located

on Mannheim Road in Franklin Park, Illinois, was extremely

"hot" as a result of publicity received following the

Scavo brothers killing.

Informant further advised that

Rocky Infelice was at that time acting as maitre-de at

Pedicones in Lyons, Illinois, and had begun his duties on

April 28, 1962.

It is to be noted that during May, 1962, Phillip

Scavo, his brother, and a female were murdered in gangland

style

in Elmwood Park,

Illinois. Information furnished by

various confidential sources of the Chicago Office reveal

that all three victims had been seen frequently at the Lido

Motel and Guest Lounge in Franklin Park, Illinois.

are delinquent in payments of "juice loans".

In 1960, De Stefano

threw a naptha bomb in a bedroom window of the home of Chicago

Attorney Robert Mc Donnell which caused a fire resulting in

considerable damage. De Stefano did this as a result of the fact

that Mc Donnell was delinquent in payments on a "juice loan"

It has been reported that De Stefano is emotionally -

Many occurrances which would not

disturb a normal person are

said to put De Stefano into fits of

rage during which time he is liable to committ crimes of violance

In December, 1962, information was confidentially

received

as follows:

Approximately three years ago the

proprietor of Kirie's Restaurant was contacted regarding the

unionization of the restaurant employees by the Bartenders,

Local 450,

made this contact, and the restaurant owner refused to'

permit a check-off system for the union and told Lardino

not to come back. No subsequent contact was made by any

union representative. This source noted that the bombing

"was possibly" related to further union activity and the

bombing was intended as

a "warning to Kirie."

In addition,.

this source explained that James Kirie is Vice President and

a member of the Board of Directors of the Chicago Restaurant

Association, and Kirie is outspoken in his opposition to

hoodlum control or operation of restaurants and has

consistently opposed any hoodlum payoffs by the Association

or its members.

This source was of the opinion that the

bombing of Kirie's Restaurant could also be possibly related

to Kirie's activities in the Association and the probability Kirie

will be the next president of the Chicago Restaurant Association.

Further, this source noted that Kirie is the 'Democratic

Committeeman for Leyden Township, Illinois, and has been

active in local and state politics for over 25 years. .

During

the November, 1962,, election campaign Kirie actively opposed

the candidacy of Elmer Conti for State. Treasurer on the

Republican slate and was, to a great extent, responsible for

the defeat of Conti. In

opposing Conti, Kirie made a

number of enemies as a result of his actions.

•Best stated that his investigation has disclosed

nothing of value concerning the motive or reason as to why

this fire was set.

It is his opinion that it is definitely

an arson type fire inasmuch as the glass bottles of gasoline

were located in the building..

Best disclosed that he determined from one of

his sources in 1961 that there was a new operator of the

Manor Lounge, and as far as he could determine this

individual was a Greek American byythe name of Jim Karubus

(phonetic). Best stated that he closed this case for lack

of evidence inasmuch as nothing has been accomplished as'

to the identity of the three

During August, 1962, a confidential source advised

the Chicago Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation

that Rocco Pranno, also known as "Jimmy" Pranno who

reportedly controls gambling and other rackets in the Stone

Park area, owns the Manor Lounge.

According to the source,

Pranno flashed a large roll of bills (money)

which he said

he picked up from the Manor Lounge.

This source also advised

that one Don Hanke, a "flunky" for Pranno, has been going

around Stone Park

indicating that he is the owner of the

Manor Lounge and that the lounge is registered under his

name.

During September, 1962, a confidential source

advised the Chicago Office

of the Federal Bureau of

Investigation that Rocco Pranno told the Stone Park

Police Department to close the Manor Lounge at 3:00 AM,

(it reportedly has license to remain open longer). This

source advised that Pranno appeared to be quite upset

inasmuch as he reportedly remarked that his employees

at the Manor Lounge were fighting them.

It should be

noted that Chief-öfoPolice AndrewSignorello is reportedly

roremost Liquor store

2240 Sobley Boulevard

Dixmoor, Illinois

On. January 7, 1963, Chief Matt Roemer, Harvey,

Illinois, Police Department,

advised

that the Foremost

Liquors Store at 2240 Sibley Boulevard in Dixmoor, Illinois,

suffered severe explosion damage on that date.

Chief Roemer

stated that the damage was caused by at least ten sticks of

dynamite placed individually along

the inside east and west

walls of the building.

le said he had heard rumors that this

establishment was bombed to prevent its owner, Michael La Pota,

from testifying in a Federal Theft From Interstate Shipment

case in Chicago.

He could furnish no specific basis for the

rumor or the source of the rumor.

It is pointed out that

La Pota is the subject of a Theft From Interstate Shipment

case involving hijacked whiskey, and that he recently entered

a plea of guilty.

On the day of the explosion, La Pota was

charged with assault and battery in a State warrant for

striking a newspaper photographer, and attempting to destroy

his camera equipment, while this photographer was attempting

to take photographs at the scene of the bombing.

About one week prior to the explosion, information

was confidentially received that there was an excess amount

of wastepaper and other inflamable debris in the Foremost

Liquor Store. As a result of this debris,

the premises were

considered to be a fire hazard, and the matter was being turned

over to insurance companies for possible cancellation of insurance

policies.

(CG 6491-C

to Special Agent Thomas W. Parrish)

During January 1963, Robert May, Special Agent in

Charge, National Board of Fire Underwriters, advised that

La Pota has insurance

policies

amounting to $180,000.00 and

a

$36,000.00 business interuption policy.

He added that it is

possible that there may be additional insurance which has not

yet been located.

May further advised that he has information

that La Pota with an unnamed known arsonist drove to Florida in

the summer of 1962.

Shortly afterwards, La Pota's mother's home

in Florida was destroyed by fire.
