insurance payments. Chief targets of the Fire Marshal's
investigation, according to the article, are Ernest

January 1, 1963, at night, causing an estimated $100,000

: Concerning say/fe 5 Stefano, 1656 North Sayre, Chicago,
Illinois, information entially received during ‘April,

1960, that De Stefano has a proclivity for setting fires in fits
of rage over incidents which he considers personal insults or as
a method of disiplining recalcitrant associates or customers. who
are delinquent in payments of "juice loans". In.1960, De Stefano
threw a naptha bomb in a bedroom window of the home of Chicago
Attorney Robert Mc Donnell which caused a fire resulting in
considerable damage. De Stefano did this as a result of the fact
that Mc Donnell was delinquent in payments on a "juice loan"
which he had made of De Stefano.

De. Stefano has been suspected of many crimes of murder,
assault with a deadly weapon, and similar type crimes by the
Chicago Police Department. He is regarded as the leading "juice
man" in this area in that he lends out vast’ sums at exorbitant
and usurious rates of interest. He is also believed to finance
burglars and thieves in turn for a percentage of their scores.

It has been reported that De Stefano is emotionally -
unstable and most excitable. Many occurrances which would not
disturb a normal person are said to put De Stefano into fits of
rage during which time he is liable to committ crimes of violance
far outweighing the reason for his anger.

In December, 1962, information was confidentially
received as follows: Approximately three years ago the
proprietor of Kirie’s Restaurant was contacted regarding the
unionization of the restaurant employees by the Bartenders,
Restaurant and Club Employees Union; Local 450, AFL-CIO,

‘Cicero, Illinois, John Lardino, Organizer for Local 450,

made this contact, and the restaurant owner refused to’
permit a check-off system for the union and told Lardino

not to come back. No subsequent contact was made.by any
union representative. This source noted that the bombing
"was possibly" related to further union activity and the”
bombing was intended asa "warning to Kirie." In addition,
this. source explained that James Kirie. is: Vice President and
a member of the Board of Directors of the Chicago Restaurant
Association, and Kirie is outspoken in his opposition to
hoodlum control or operation of restaurants and has
consistently opposed any hoodlum payoffs by the Association

or its members. This source was of the opinion that the

bombing of Kirie's Restaurant could also be possibly related

to Kirie's activities in the Association and the probability Kirie

will be the next president of the Chicago Restaurant Association.

Further, this source noted that Kirie is the Democratic

Committeeman for Leyden Township, Illinois, and has been

active in local and state politics for over 25 years. During

the November, 1962,, election campaign Kirie actively opposed

the candidacy of Elmer Conti for State Treasurer on the =

Republican slate and was, to a great extent, responsible for

the defeat of Conti. -In opposing Conti, Kirie made a

number of enemies. as a result of his actions. :
: (CG .6277-C)

The "Chicago Daily News" on January 9, 1963,
carried an article regarding cafe bombings and fires in. the
Chicago area, According to the article, Kirie's Restaurant,
2826 Thatcher, River Grove, Illinois, was. damaged in the

_amount of $200.00 from a black powder bomb. Owner, James

Kirie, Leyden Township, Democratic Committeeman, blamed his
opposition to gambling and vice as the apparent motive for
the bombing. The restaurant has non-union employees,
according to the article. .

‘Best stated that his investigation has disclosed
nothing of value concerning. the motive or reason as to why
this fire was set. It is his opinion that it is definitely
_an arson type fire inasmuch as the glass bottles of gasoline
were located in the building.. :

Best disclosed that he determined from one of

his sources in 1961 that there was a new operator of the
Manor Lounge, and as far as he could determine this
individual. was a Greek American byvthe name of Jim Karubus
_ (phonetic). Best stated that he closed this case for lack
of evidence inasmuch as nothing has been accomplished as

to the identity of the three men who apparently set fire to
the lounge.

During August, 1962, a confidential source advised
the Chicago Office’ of the Federal Bureau of Investigation
that Rocco Pranno, also known as "Jimmy" Pranno who
reportedly controls gambling and other rackets in the Stone
Park area, owns the Manor Lounge. According to the source,
Pranno flashed a large roll of. bills (money) which he said
he picked up. from the Manor Lounge. This,source also advised
that one Don Hanke, a "flunky" for Pranno, has been going
around Stone Park indicating that he is the owner of the’
Manor Lounge and that the lounge is registered under his

susie (PCI Louis Rufer to SA Roy F. Rodman °
September, 1962)

During September, 1962, a confidential source
advised the Chicago Office of the Federal Bureau of
Invéstigation that Rocco Pranno told the Stone Park
Police Department to close the Manor Lounge at 3:00 AM,
(it reportedly has license to remain'open longer). This
source advised that Pranno appeared to be quite upset
inasmuch as he reportedly remarked that his employees
at the Manor Lounge were fighting them. It should be

Foremost Liquor Store
2240 Sibley Boulevard
Dixmoor, Illinois

On. January 7, 1963, Chief Matt Roemer, Harvey,
Illinois, Police Department, advised that the Foremost
Liquors Store at 2240 Sibley Boulevard in Dixmoor, Illinois,
suffered severe explosion damage on that date. Chief Roemer
stated that the damage was caused by at least ten sticks of
dynamite placed individually along the inside east and west
walls of the building. He said he had heard rumors that this
establishment was bombed to prevent its owner, Michael La Pota,
from testifying in a Federal Theft From Interstate Shipment
case in Chicago. He could furnish no specific basis for the
rumor or the source of the rumor. It is pointed out that
La Pota is the subject of a Theft From Interstate Shipment
case involving hijacked whiskey, and that he recently entered
a plea of guilty. On the day of the explosion, La Pota was
charged with assault and battery in a State warrant for .
striking a newspaper photographer, and attempting to destroy
his camera equipment, while this photographer was attempting
to take photographs at the scene of the bombing. a

About one week prior to the explosion, information
was confidentially received that there was an excess amount
of wastepaper and other inflamable debris in the Foremost
Liquor Store. As a result of this debris, the premises were
considered to be a fire hazard, and the matter was being turned
over to insurance companies for possible cancellation of insurance
policies.
«CG 6491-C
to Special Agent Thomas W. Parrish)
During January 1963, Robert May, Special Agent in
Charge, National Board of Fire Underwriters, advised that
La Pota has insurance policies amounting to $180,000.00 and a
$36,000.00 business interuption policy. He added that it is
possible that there may be additional insurance which has not
yet been located. May further advised that he has information
that La Pota with an unnamed known arsonist drove to Florida in
the summer of 1962. Shortly afterwards, La Pota's mother's home
in Florida was destrgyed by fire.
