y 32. SOOT 1/8 - Alert in Oriente Province Balieved to be Te!
Tton #13, wal's 25/26 November):

The alert in Orient. Province Zs believed to be terminated. The alert, ap-
parently prompted by President Kennedy's death oo 22 November, was possibly pre-
Scheduled to terminate on i:5 November. There have been two orders which sugsest =
that the alert vas destized to be concluded on 25 November: They aret .

1) Access to the coastal observation post at Punta Neisi (20-15% 7Th-OFW) wast
restrictad until 25 duvember because of the alort. s

2) Subordinates of Banos, Headquarters Eastern Naval District, were to receive:
further orders on the 25th, presumably conesrning their alert status; no such orders
have beon noted in communications. .

There bave been no further references in intercepted commmications to the
alert since 02222 on 23 Uovember.

It is possible that the restricted access to tie observation post at Punta
Naisi extends to other observation posts in Grienta Province such as reported on
22 November when First Army Coastal Observation Posts were placed in alert status,
and that the restriction was to be Lifted on 25 Novenber by all those posts. =

Further indications that the alert was terminated is the fact that the Cusan
Yavy was engaged in ap island-wide communications exoarcine on 25 November. It is |
considered unlikely that such an exercise would be conducted undor alert conditions.

There have been no further references to the alert status of the (D Percent
Santiago de Cuba) units which was first observed on 23 November. All GRAF and
Soviet Forces Cuba Connunications appear to be normal during this period,

22 = 26 Novembor 1963.
