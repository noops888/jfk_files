32. SaCTION III/S - Alert In Grienta Province Balleted to he Terminateds (Bee

Iter (13, hollis 25/25 Novender):

The alert in Orient Province is belleved to be

terinated. The alort, ap-

parently prompled by Presiilent Kennedy'g death on 22 Notember, was possibly pre-

scheduled to tominate on :5 lorenter. There have been two orders wich subest

that the alert ras destived to be concluded on 25 November: They ares

1) Access to the coastal observation post at Punta Maisi (20-15 74-09w) was

restrictad until 25 iuvember because of the alert.

2) Subordinates of Banos, Isadquarters Eastero Naval Histrict, vere to raceive:

furthor orders on the 25th, presumably concerning their alurt ststus; no such orders

bave boon noted in communications.

There bave been no further referancos in intercepted communications to the

alert since 02222 on 23 Movembar.

It is possible that the restricted access to tie observation post at Punta

"lalsi extends to othar observatior posts in Crienta Province such as reported on

2? lovenber when first Army Coastal Observation Posta vere placed in alert status,

and that the restriction vas to be liftod = 25 November by all those pasts.

Further indications that the alert was terminated 1s the fact that the Cujan

Mary was enjaged in an 1gland-udde conminications exorcire on 25 November. It 13

considered unlikely that such an exercise would be conducted under aiert conditions.

There have been no furthor references to the alert status of the (D Percent

Santiago de Cuba) units wich was first obserrod on 23 November. All CRAF and

Soviet Forces Cuba Communications appear to be normal during this perfod,

22 - 26 Norembor 1963.
