t infiltration by Cuban fishing vessels.

Questioned agaiu about his reasons for
cooperating with the CHUN, the source replicd that he is
an individual complctely independent of any political
belie?. He said that he vas initially motivated against
the regine of Fidel Castro because he had secn his parents
work herd and save for 40 years in order to afford a few
luxurics in their later lives, only to sce the Cuban
Governicnt intervene and claim possession of everything,
including their home. He further explained that it
appears the United States will never force Castro out of
Cuba but that the fact remains he is Cuban and Cuba is
his fatherland. He said he is willing to cooperate only
to the extent that his parents will receive fair treatment
fron the Cuban Government.

Espinosa had information that the source was
suspected at one tine by Cubans in Miami of p ibly
being connected with the Cuban G-2, which information
caused a United Ststes Government investigation, Source
replied that this was probably due to his nusber of
successiv) rans into Cuba without incident which prozpted
