AND

APPRAISAL, A FORNER HIGH-LEVEL CUBAN OFFICIAL WHO WAS ONCE ACTIVE IN THE

REVOLUTIONARY SOVEMENT AND A CONFIDANT OF FIDEL CASTRO. HE HAS

ALKAYS BEEN ANTI-COMMUNIST AND IS NOW STRONGL: ANTI-CASTRO. HE

CONTISUES TO MAINTAIN CONTACT WITH MANY CUBAN OFFICIALS AT ALL

LEVELS OF GOVERNMEVT.

SOL'RCE HAS PROVIDED A LIMITED SUMBER OF

REFORTS WHICH APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN ACCURATE.

-

1. PROBABLY THE MAJOR CHANGE THAT HAS OCCURRED IN CUBA DURING

THE PAST YEAR, TOGETHER NITH THE DECLINING ECONOVIC SITTATION, HAS

BEEN THE CENTRALIZATION OF DECISION-WAKING POWERS IN ONE MAN, PREMIER

FIDEL, CASTRO RUZ. CASTRO REFUSES TO LISTEN TO ADVICE ASD IS FOREVER

BYPASSING HIS HINISTERS. CASTRO GETS AN IDEA AND WITHOLT CONSTLTISS

ANYONE KILL CALL A TRUSTED OFFICER, ASSIGN HIM THE TASK, AND ORDER

HIM TO REPORT DIRECTLY TO CASTRO. THIS CALSES TOTAL CONFUSION IY

GOVERNIENT MINISTRIES, AND HAS ALSO GIVEN RISE TO PUBLIC CRITICISN

OF CASTRO. SUCH CRITICISM, ALTHOUGH MOSTLE IN A JOKING VEIN, IS A

NEW DEVELOPMENT. CASTRO IS AWARE THAT THE PEOPLE ARE BECOMING

CRITICAL, AND HE IS STARTING TO MANEUVER TO REGAIN

÷

GROUND.

2. CASTRO'S INTESTIGATIO! OF JOAQUIN ORDOQUI MESA NAS THE

AFTERLATH OF AND DIPECTLY RELATED TO THE MARCH 1964 TRIAL OF MARCOS

ARCANDO RODRIGUEZ ALFONSO, ORDOQUI WAS VERY UNHAPPY MITH THE PRO-

CEEDINGS AND HE REFUSED TO LET MATTERS REST. ORDOQUI CONTINUED TO

EXPRESS IRRITATION ABOLT THE MANTER IN WHICH THE TRIAL HAD BEEN

HAXDLED, AND HIS CRITICAL ATTITUDE CONTRIBUTED TO CASTRO'S BRINGING

MATTERS TO A HEAD.

3. CASTRO'S PRIMARY CONCERN REGARDING THE "OLD GUARD" COMMUN-

ISTS IS THAT THEY ARE SO DISLIKED BY THE MASSES. BY KEEPING THEM,

HOWEVER, CASTRO GIVES HIMSELF HANEUVERING GROUND. CASTRO REALIZES

HE HUST ACT AGAINST THE "OLD GUARD" CONNUNISTS WIH RESTRAINT IN

ORDER NOT TO CREATE SERIOUS PROBLEMS WITH THE SOVIETS. THE LAST

THING CASTRO WANTS IS AN UNCONTROLLED CRISIS EITHER WITH THE SOVIETS

OR WITHIN THE REGIME.

4. CASTRO'S MAJOR PROBLEMS ARE ECONONIC, CONNERCIAL, AND LABOR.

LAZARO PEÑA GONZALEZ, SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE CENTRAL DE TRABAJA-

DORES DE CUBA REVOLLCIONARIA (REVOLUTIONARY CUBAN WORKERS' ORCANIZA-

TIOY, CTC-B) IS SLATED TO BE REVOVED, BUT ONLY CASTRO WILL SAY WHEN.

CARLOS RAFAEL RODRIGUEZ RODRIGUEZ, DIRECTOR OF THE INSTITUTO NACIONAL

DE LA REFORMA AGRARIA (NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF AGRARIAN REFORM, INRA)

HAS ALSO HAD HIS PROBLEMS WITH CASTRO. THE INRA IS A "BIESS" BUT IT

IS DOUBTFUL, THAT ANTONE CAN SUCCEED IN THE JOB, AND IT IS UNLIKELY

THAT CASTRO WILL ESCALATE THE CRISIS BY A HOVE AGAINSI RODRIGUEZ AT

THIS TIME. (SOURCE COMMENT: CASTRO ONCE SAID THAT HE WILL NOT

PERMIT HIMSELE TO BE PRESSURED BY ANYONE AND MILL REPLACE OFFICIALS

ONLY WHEN HE DESIRES TO DO SO. AS EARLY AS DECEMBER 1963 CASTRO

MAS PLANNING TO REMOVE AUGUSTO MARTINEZ SANCHEZ AS MINISTER OF LABOR

AT A CONVENIENT TIME, THUS HIS RECENT ACTION AGAINST YARTINEZ HAY

REPRESENT THE REALIZATION OF A YEAR-OLD INTENTION.) CASTRO'S

PROBLEMS WITH THE MILITARY HAVE BEEN LESS SERIOUS. ACTION TAKEN

AGAINST MILITARY OFFICERS HAS BEEN ON DISCIPLINARY, NOT POLITICAL

GROUNDS, AS IN THE CASE OF THE DISMISSAL OF CAPTAIN JOSE AGUSTIN

"TINTIN" DIAZ-ARGÜELLES.
