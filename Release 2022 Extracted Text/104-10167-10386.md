friend of the Air Attache Office in Hav: and now
an official of the FRD in Miani of the RD IP-1 faction,
was calling Major Van Horn ca tehalf of AMDI9;! who was
standing next to him by tke paone. This is kn-w to
be true because ne and GARCLA could be overzeard waile
GARCIA relayed him the conversation.

GARCIA told Major Van Horn that the purpose of the phone
call was to make an appointment for AMDIP-1 to see Van
Horn on that sane day. He said AMDIP-1 was leaving for
Washington and wanted to discuss with Van Horn certain ia
i:fortation he had received to the effect that Alberto ~
ALBESTI, who acting as Gaief of the Liberation Air
Force, was trying to overtarow the Revolutionary Council
and that Van Hora nad something to do with this too. Van
Horn told GARCIA ta inform AMDIP-1 that oe was mistaken
about his paving aay part in the allegec ALBERTI plot to
overtarow the Council; that ae was in contact with :
ALBERTI in the capacity. of Assistant Air Attache complying
with nis duties of liaison wita tae Cuban pilots in Miami,
and that as far as he knew, ALBERTI was not attempting to
overtnrow the Council. GARCIA relayed this information !
to AMDIP-1, and again told Van dorm that AMMIP-1 wisned ‘to
have an interview with him before going to kasoington {
and informing U.S. officials about tse “plot”. |

Van Horn informed GARCIA that he was very sorry but he ,
could not see AMDIP-1.as ne was extremely busy making the
final preparations for a conierence of Air Attaches and i
Mission Chiefs wnich ne and toe Air Attache, Colonel {
Stevers, had to attend in Panama the ccming Monday (this

jurisdiction and he nad no authority to talk to him: :
GARCIA then said that was tov bad, and chat AMDIP-L would Ta
be forced to subcit his report to Washington witaout apy
discussing the problem with Van Horn. bce tae ATA!
