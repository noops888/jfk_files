SUBJECT : Report on Antonio RODRIGUEZ Echasabal

Antonio RODRIGUEZ Echaszabal was born in Cuba on 17 August 1913.
He has a master's degree in agriculture, professedly has no religion but
is a Mason. RODRIGUEZ is married to Edith JONES, who was bora in
Cuba on 10 March 1917; she is, however, of Haitian origia, being the
daughter of a former Haitian Ambassador to Belgium, aad she is a devout
Episcopelian. The couple is known to have three children: a son who was
last reported to be in Havana, Cuba; a daughter married to a man of
German birth who was employed in the Castro land-reform organization
uatil hie departure for Germaay in December 1961; and a son, Antonio
RODRIGUEZ Jones, born 24 August 1943 at Havana, who was studying at
the Ecole Francaise Internationale in Washington, D.C. in 1961. This son
has been reported to be anti-U.5. aad to have requested permission of his
father to go to Cuba or to another "socialist'' country to continue his
education.

“Antonio RODRIGUEZ Jones resided in Washingtoa, D.C. with Yvonne
JONES, his aunt.and sister of the wife of Antonio RODRIGUEZ Echasabal.
~ Mise JONES was bora 10 April-1910 at Antwerp, Belgium; she was unmarri:
and was @ secretary at the Pan Americaa Health Organization. She became
a U.S. citizen in 1959. Since the Castro regime has come to power,
Mies JONES is said to have spoken quite openly for Castro and against the
U.S. Government.

RODRIGUEZ lived in Haiti for about eighteen years prior to the

commencement of his diplomatic career, having been barred by the Batiet:
i government from returning to Cuba. He became a Haitian citizen and was
the owner of a Port-au-Prince meat market called "Zl Oso Blanco". Wher
Castro assumed power in Cuba, RODRIGUEZ took over the Cuban Embasey
in Pert-au-Prince in January 1959 after the Batista-appolated officials had
fled to the Derninican Republic. Soon thereaiter he was aamed Ambassado:
to Haiti. ° :

In late July 1959, Haiti was lavaded by a small gr ap of Cubans, suppos

as a prelude to an invasion of the neighboring Dominican Republic. The
incursion was successfully repelled by the Haitian Government, which
publicly charged RODRIGUEZ with complicity in the raid. RODRIGUEZ the:
closed the Cuban Embassy and returned to Cuba after selling hie private
property in Haiti.

While RODRIGUEZ was atill in Haiti, two attempts were made on his
life. He accused the Trujillo regime ia the Domialican Republic and,
indirectly, the Haitian Goverar-.ent of complicity in those attacks.

In November 1959, RODRIGUEZ went to Guatemala as Cuban Ambassado:
There, he appears to have associated freely with pro-Commuaist groups. J
March 1960, he was requested by the Guatemalan Geverament to leave the
country on the ground that he wae engaging in activities inimical to the best
interests of Guatemala.

In November 1960, RODRIGUEZ reported to Karachi, Pakistan, as Cub:
Ambassador. His wife accompanied him there and served a chief
secretary. During the initial months of his tour there, his closest relation.
in the diplomatic colony were with officials of the Belgian Embassy,
presumably ae a result of the fact that- Belgium had represented Cubs when
there was no Cuban representative in Karachi. During 1961, however, his
social contacts were almost exclusively with Soviet, Satellite and Chinese
‘Commualet diplomatic personnel,

In late 1961, when RODRIGUEZ copdreatiy had decided t to defect, he
confided to an acquaintance in the diplomatic colony that he wae finished
“with politics and wanted to devote the rest of his life to agriculture. He ho;
at the time to go to the Dominican Republic or to another, unspecified Sout!
American nation. At the time of his departure from Karachi by alr for
Germany ia early 1962, RODRIGUEZ reportedly made only a very limited
statement at the airport regarding his defection.- The event apparently
received very little, if any, press notice in Pakistan.

pean : Insufficient information exists at present to permit a determination as‘

so the gemulmeness. of RODRIGUEZ's disaffection with the Castro regime. Fo:
reasons which have aot as yet been fully reported, the Department of State
denied a visa to RODRIGUEZ, apparently after he had made the decision tc
resign hie post in Pakistan.” We understand, howevor, that, following his
