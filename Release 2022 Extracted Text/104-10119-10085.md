REVIEW

May 28; 1964

Dear Howard:

Here it is.

You will note we had to cut fifteen

lines because it was over. 'But I hope it helps.

Thanks a million for all the work you did on it.

I managed to read only about one-third of the

book, and depended on you for the rest.

Give me a ring soon.

Hastily,

Mr. Howard Hunt

SWING LUFFIY LAST THIRTEETH STREET, NEW YORKiE. IY.
