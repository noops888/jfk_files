[5-part message complete] :

I am communicating to you herewith Washington telegram
Nr. 7087-91 of 12 December 1963. .

The Cuban affair has abruptly returned to the forefront with
the republication of articles written for L'Express by Mr. JEAN
DANIEL after his conversations with President KENNEDY afd CASTRO,
first in the weekly The New. ‘Republic, and then in the Néw York
Times and the Washington Post. From the comments of the American
press, I might single out,” the following elements: :

1. Although President KENNEDY did indeed mention Hungary
in his conversation with Mr, ADZHUBEI--Mr. PIERRE SALINGER has
ust acknowledged it.after having denied it--it was only, according
to the White House ‘Spokesman, to show the importance of Cuba to the
United States. On: ‘the other hand, the President did net make any
allusion to the fact that the United States was a passive witness
to the Soviet intervention in Hungary in 1956. In any-case, since
The Bay of Pigs, President KENNEDY never had any intention of invad-
ing Cuba. He ,tategorically answered a question on this sub ject by
Mr. ADZHUBET. ,in the negative.

2.’ The administration puts no trust in CASTRO's
statements to the effect that the Soviets installed rackets in
Cuba to prevent an invasion of the island by the United States.

At most, “it is thought here that Mr. KHRUSHCHEV may have told
CASTRO that the installation of these rockets was poner eeneaere to
his country! s defense.

3. Mr.-KHRUSHCHEV's decision is still explained by his wish
to compensate. quickly: and cheaply for the Soviet Union's strategic.
inferiority. “Moreover, as a study by the Rand Corporation recalls,
this is what CASTRO told Mr. JULIEN of Le Monde when he admitted:
"It was not to 6nsure our own eons that we accepted the .rockets,
but to reinforce’the socialist camp's position. This is the truth,
even if others provide different explanations." !

4, However that may be, the publication of these interviews
puts President JOHNSON in a delicate position, As Mr. CHALMERS
ROBERTS remarked in the Washington Post, Mr. KHRUSHCHEV' s
emissaries hint that perhaps an arrangement is possible between
the United.States and CASTRO. The latter, in his ‘interview with
Mr. DANIEL, intimated that he might put an end to ‘his terrorist
agitation campaign in Latin America if the United ‘States lifted
its economic: blockade of ‘the island. Therefore, Mr. ROBERTS
acknowledges, this perhaps, gives a margin to the United States
for maneuvering, but "only’a short time after having acceded to
the presidency and only a yéar before the elections, Mr. JOHNSON's
possibilities for action in this field are very limited."
