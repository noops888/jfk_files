NOTE:

By letter 10/15/75, HSC requested the above which
was pursuant to a briefing given Congressman McClory and
members of HSC by IATD on 10/10/75. Subsequent to this request,
Mr. Blackhurst advised that it had been decided that only
generic lists would be submitted to the Committee in response
to these queries and, based on his instructions, these four
questions are being responded to by the submission of the
attached generic lists, Per Mr, Blackhurst, in accordance
with White House instructions, EPC and Flooding Technique
surveillances are not included in lists three and four.

It is noted the lists on technical and microphone surveillances
pertain to only domestic targets, The entries under
categories ''Foreign Intelligence Agents, Foreign Intelligence
Contacts and Foreign Intelligence Agents Suspects" are individ-
uals, involved in Foreign Intelligence operations, who are
nonetheless American citizens, Therefore, per the Department's

definition of a domestic target as stated by Steven Blackhurst,
these were included.

UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
SELECT COMMITTER ON INTELLIGENCE (HSC)

NOTE: -SHERET-

Samuel Adason Jaffe was a symbol number informant
of the New York Office from 1958 to 1961 and was later in
contact with the Washington Field Office. During th ese
periods of contact, Jaffe furnished information on his numerous
contacts with Soviet and People's Republic of China officials,
which were occasioned by his employment with ABC and CBS and
with other news media.u

os Following his identification by Soviet defector
P'sanny*] 2s having been recruited by the KGB while assigned
to Yoscow, Jaife was extensively interviewed and advised that
he believed he had been the subject of a recruitment approach
but denied being a KGB agent. Our_relations thereafter wore
conducted with caution in view of [samay's"/ allegations and
he is not currently being contacted. s

Jaffe filed a request under the Freedom of Information
Act in March, 1975, and subsequently appealed our denial of
access to information concerning him as contained in our files.
Jaffe has alleged’ that the FBI, or his association with the FBI,
has prevented him from obtaining work in the news media field.
This allegation is not supported by any material contained in
his file.u

In approximately June, 1975, Jaffe met with a friend
of his who is a member of the Senate Select Committee on
Intelligence operations. While he was discussing his belief
that the FBI has been vindictive toward him because he was
"fingered" by a Soviet defector, Senator Frank Church, Chairman
of the Senate Committce, overheard Jafie's allegations and ordered
that his Staff interview Jaffe for full details of his allegation.w

The material being furnished the House Committee
rvepresents 411 information contained in Jaffe's main file, with
certain exceptions which are explained in the memorandum to the
Committee. There are also somo 200 to 250 references which are
not being furnished, following an agreement between Supervisor
Thomas J, WcNiff and Miss Emily Sheketoff£ of the HSC wherein it
was agreed that these need not be made available at present.

RE: VIETNAM VETERANS AGAINST THE WAR/WINTER SOLDIER
ORGANIZATION (VVAW/WSO)

In June, 1967, Gus Hall, General Secretary of
the Communist Party, USA (CPUSA) commented on the forth-
coming 1968 national elections. Hall stated that the CPUSA
must develop guidelines for the political campaigns and must
assist in the development of any 1968 campaign which was
antiwar in character and not limited to either major
Political party. On September 10, 1967, the CPUSA publication,
"The Worker,’' announced that the organization VVAW had been
formed in June, 1967, as a nonmembership organization made
up of Vietnam veterans who were opposed to the war. This
communist publication provided the purpose of VVAW as
opposition to the “unjustified” war in Vietnam. It announced
that VVAW had joined "the dissent of millions of Americans
against the war."

An initial limited inquiry was begun by the

Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in September, 1967,
to determine, through inquiries with established sources
and public source material, if the CPUSA was directing or
controlling the newly ad YVAN. This limited inquiry
failed to establish that the CPUSA, or any other subversive
organization, exercised direction or control over VVAW. The
limited inquiry did indicate that VVAW leadership appeared
before the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) sponsored Militant
Labor Forum in New York City, but there was no indication of
any control by the SWP. With the absence of such direction
or control by any subversive organization, the limited
inquiry of VVAW was closed in October, 1967. A similar
limited inquiry was conducted in 1968, resulting in an

i updated affirmation that VVAW was not controlled or dominated
by any subversive group. This second limited inquiry was
closed in May, 1968. During the limited inquiries in
1967 and 1968, the National Headquarters of VVAW was
located in New York City. VVAW activities were primarily
devoted to participation in and organization of
demonstrations opposing the war in Vietnam. No full
investigation was conducted by the PBI of VVAW until
August, 1971, when information from a variety of sources
dictated the need to determine the extent of control

over VVAW by subversive groups and/or violence~prone
elements in the antiwar movement. Sources had provided
information that VVAW was stockpiling weapons, VVAW had
been in contact with North Vietnam officials in Paris,
France, VVAW was receiving funds from former CPUSA
members and VVAW was aiding and financing U.S. military
deserters. Additionally, information had been received
that some individual chapters throughout the country
had been infiltrated by the youth groups of the CPUSA
and the SWP. A trend of increased militancy developed
within the VVAW and the possibilities of violence
escalated within the organization. During December,
1971, VVAW members forcibly and illegally occupied or
surrounded public buildings and national monuments in
New York City, Philadelphia, Austin, Texas, and
Washington, D.C.

During 1972, the FBI estimated that VVAW had
approximately 1,800 members and 102 chapters throughout
the country. VVAW claimed 23,000 members and 283 chapters.
In 1972, some leaders and activists in the VVAW made
trips to Europe and Asia during which they participated
in conferences with representatives and/or officials of
the Soviet Bloc, North Vietnam, and the National
Liberation Front (NLF) of South Vietnam. VVAW leaders
informed: the membership that VVAW had been asked to
cooperate on an international level with many organizations,
including communist or Maoist groups, describing these
groups as "our friends." When reporting on trips to
Paris, Moscow and Hanoi, VVAW leaders indicated the
organization was dedicated to ending imperialist
aggression and establishing a firm relationship with
the NLF. :

In June, 1972, a delegation of fifteen VVAW
members and leaders attended a war crimes conference near
Paris. The conference, which included representatives
of North Vietnam and the NLF, was sponsored by two
‘Trotskyist organizations in France. One of the VVAW
national officers addressed this conference and it was
reported that the French Communist Party had paid for
the expenses of the VVAW contingent at the conference.

During October, 1972, the National Steering
Committee (NSC) of VVAW met and discussed the direction
of VVAW and the need to make it an anti-imperialist

~2-


NW 68262 Docld:32989695 Page 66

political group, rather than "just another group of war
veterans," . Host of the sneakers participating at this
meeting expressed their views indicating VVAY was
utilizing a Marszist-oriented anzlysis of world problems,
~ Additionally, it was indicated that VVAT had established
relations with the Irish Republican Arny, had contact
with the Angolans, and was attenpting to establish
liaison with the Peoples Republic of, China (PRC).

In April, 1975, the organisation chanced its
name to VVAI/Vinter Soldier Organization: (VV, TBO).
The change was made in order to abgorb into the organi-
zation, individuals who were not veterans of military
service, .

: By April, 1°73, VVAN/WcO leadership clained
to have connections with over 200 foreign organisations
and maintained that YVAu/7G0 was considered a credible
organization by these organizations, In October, 1973,
representatives of VVAV/7CO attended and participated in
the World eace Congress, Moscow, U.S.3.2R. .

In 1973, an ideological split became evident
within the national leadershin of VYAW/i5 The split
arose between those espousing the Narxist-Leninist
doctrine and those espyousins the Harxist-Leninist
doctrine as interpreted by HAO Tse tung. During 1973,
the anti ist Marxist-Leninist group seened to be
dominant ressed deternination in educating the
/ hin in their doctrine, By 1973, VVAtI/W#SO
was composed of approximately 130 chapters with an
estimated membership of 2,000. The National Neadquarters
was, and still is, located in Chicago, Illinois,

: By April, 10974, the NSC devoted itself to the
theme of defining VVAU/%00 as a politically oriented
organization, canable of uniting with as many neopie
as possible to combat U.S. imperialisn. The hope was
expressed that VVA' SO would become part of the vancuard
of the revolution within this country, Within the ™S
dissatisfaction ceveloned and was expressed by sone of
the chapters concerning the VW.0i/Wot publication,

support the National Office held a meeting in which they
verified severance from the national organisation and
agreed to set up an independent organization. This
vival group was intended to be anti-inperialist in
nature, but, to date, its future is not certain.

The current National Office of VVAN/WSO is

Government, the investigation of the local organization
was to be terminated, iiost of the local chapters and
regions continued to be nominally affiliated with the

ideological disputes demanded close examination of the

Mr. O'Connor. Tt was sometime, I believe, around
the middle or just after the midaie of April of 1971.

Mr. Oliphant. hos could you describe in chronological
order what your duties were with the Wasington Field Office?
In other words, what teitae or units were you assigned to?

Mr. O'Connor. Okay. Initially I was assigned to a squad
that handled New Left investigations. “While I was a part
of that squad I was a part of a smaller unit that was engaged
in the investigation to locate certain New Left fugitives. It
was kind of a crininal-security type of an investigation
we were conducting.

Then I guess it was about September of 1972, I was
and fugitive investigations.

Mr. Oliphant. From your transfer from the squad and
the unit which dealt with the New Left to the squad which
dealt with bank robbery, since that time; September of
1972, have you had any further contact with New Left
investigations?

Mr. O'Connor. Not that I can recall. You know,7
nothing. I didn't have any investigat 4S leads assigned
to me or Athening like that as far as I can recall.

Mr. Oliphant. Okay. Why were you transferred from your

duties with the New Left to your duties with the Bank Robbery

6 in working radical work?
‘7 Mr. o'connor. Not as such. ran :

8 I did have a preference for criminal work.

9 Mr. Oliphant. Since September, 1972, you have been

Mr. O'Connor. I never did. As a-matter of fact, I
never did meet Mr. Goodwin.

Mr. Oliphant. Mr. O'Connor, tell me this: When you
were working with this squad, how were you dressed? How
did you come to work? What did you look like?

Mr. O'Connor. Initially I came to work in a suit and
tie. But beginning, I suppose, during the summer of '71,

I began to grow a beard and long hair-‘and at some point
I began to dress in old clothes.

Mr. Oliphant. Why was that?

Mr. O'Connor. It facilitated certain of our investigation,
surveillance and things of that nature where we would blend
into an area in which we oes conducting a physical surveillance
of some sort.

Mr. Oliphant. Sure. Was this your idea?

Mr. O'Connor. Part of it was. It was a combination of
cmy idea and the Bureau was interested ‘in having people who
did have that particular appearance. 4

an officer by Whe name of Carl Shoffler. He said that he
knew somebody up around the Circle who might know the
individual, who was familiar with the Dupont Circle area.

So he took us up there and introduced -- I don't know whether

there was anybody else with me aside from Carl -- he

introduced me to this individual, Butch, showed him the
photograph, I ao not know if he showed him any other photograph
but he didn't seem to know the person.

Shortly thereafter, around October i, Meritt called me
e the office and he said that he had been working. for the
Metropolitan Police Department, that he was dissatisfied with
them and that he wanted to go to work for us if we would pay
him enough for the information which he said he could furnish.

Mr. Oliphant. So it was Merritt who initiated the contacts
This was purely sort of a chance initial acquaintance to find
this fugitive, a one-shot affair, is that correct?

Mr. O'Connor. That is correct.

Mr. Oliphant. You did not expect him to call you back
or be in contact with you again?

Mr. O'Connor. No. As a matter of fact, I was surprised
that he aid.

Mx. Oliphant. What did you say to him when he called?

could furnish.. Basically, to put it in general terms, he said

he could furnish information concerning criminal matters

concerning a fraudulent check or a bad check matter. I don't
know quite how he put it, but it involved a check.

Mr. Oliphant. Did he bring that out in this initial
phone call? .

Mr. O'Connor. He brought it out. He said, ft have
one problem before I go to work for you He said, vt have
this problem and I think the FBI has been looking for me

but I might explain that I could never call him except to
return a call to a pay phone because he did not have a phone
in his residence. He said that he was concerned about this.
I said I was going to have ran check. I told him at that time
that if I found out that we either wanted him on an outstanding
warrant or we wanted to talk to him, that somebody was
going to be up to see him, or try to, you know.

him within a day or so. But I-did check and I did find

that we had been interested in him with respect to a bad check
matter and that the U. S. Atrorney's Office in West Virginia
had declined prosecution. I also checked NCIC to see if there
were any outstanding atte for him or anything like that
under his true name which he had said he had not been using.
He gave me his true name. .

Mr. Oliphant. Let me ask you this: Did you inform him
that the U. S. Attorney in West Virginia had declined prose-
cution? a

Mr. O'Connor. That is what I was just about to tell

you. I certainly did. I told him that as far as I knew that

_ the prosecution had been declined and that I had found that

he was -- I don't know whether he was -- I guess he was the
subject of the investigation, and that the U. S. Atforney's
Office had declined prosecution, that I couldn't find that
he was wanted anyplace else and as far as I was concerned
that was no longer a stumbling block.

Mr. Oliphant. When did you tell him this?

Mr. O'Connor, It would have been a day or two after
the initial phone call, if it wasn't the same day.

Mr. Oliphant. So we are still working within the
first five days of October, roughly?

Mr. 0'Connor. Yes.

____Mr. O'Connor. we never work as partners a such, but
Bill and I work’ together quite a bit during the time
I worked on S-7, most of the time while I had the long

Mr. Oliphant. Did there come a time when you knew that
Earl Robert Mewitt had contacts with the IPS Institute?
Mr. O'Connor. Yes, he told us that at the outset.
Mr. Oliphant. Were you interested in that?
Mr. O'Connor. Yes.
Mr. Oliphant. Why?
Mr. G'Connor. For two reasons. One, we felt that
there were certain Weathermen fugitives who might be in
contact with individuals who were associafa with the

Institute, and furthermore, we did have an intelligence,

it was really a secondary concern to us because our
primary concerns were the new left fugitives.
But the Bureau also aia have an intelligence investigation
concerning the Institute.

Mr. Oliphant. Do you know why they had an intelligence
interest in the Institute?

Mr. O'Connor. I could not give you the specific

of it was, I didn't know.

. Mr. Oliphant. What were the aspects that you were

aware of? .

Mr. “O'Connor. Well,-one-of the things we ‘were concerned
about was the fact. that it seemed to us that a lot of
demonstrations had their roots out there. I guess that
would have ihenirthasha thing that I was primarily aware of.

Mr. Oliphant. Did someone tell you that the IPS was an
intelligence target?

Mr. O'Connor. Yes.

Mr. Oliphant. Who told you that?

Mr. O'Connor. That could have been any one of a number
of people.

Mr. Oliphant. Can you list the people who you believe

told you it was an intelligence target?

Mr. O'Connor. Could I ask a question off the record?

(Discussion off the record.)

Mr. Atkisson. Mr. O'Connor, let me say something that
perhaps should petbean said at the beginning of this
interview.

Mr. Oliphant and I do not want you to speculate or
guess whenever we ask you a question. Indeed, all answers
should be of your own knowledge.

If you do not have a personal knowledge of the subject

we ask you about, you should so state. In addition to

that, if you do not understand a question, please feel

to tell us that you don't understand it and ask us to
clarify it or restate it, i

With that caveat, let us resume.

Mr. nr eras I will rephrase the question here.

You stated that ‘Ips was a traget?

Mr. O'Connor. The Institute for Policy Studies was
subject of an investigation, an

Mr. Oliphant. And it is fair to characterize it as an
intelligence target, is that correct?

Mr. O'Connor. I think so. rei

Mr. Oliphant. Now, who told you that it was an intelligenc
target, or more specifically how did you know it was an
intelligence target? a

Mr. O'Connor. Well, I knew from talking to the
case agent. I'm sure I talked to the case agent and just from

general conversation on the squad. I cannot remember who

the case agent was at that time.

There was general conversation. Over and above that,

it would have been confirmed by the case agent. I cannot
remember. It could have been an agent by the name of Sawyer.
I know he had the case assigned to him at one time.

Mr. Oliphant. Why was IPS a target?
Mr. O'Connor. I don’t remember specifically. I do know
that as I said before, we were concerned because we did feel

that there were a number of demonstrations that had their

roots back, fe eee they had their ro back there at

IPS. There were a number of organizaticns soya in
demonstrations, for. instance, who were representatives which
spent time up there. That was, as I recall, one of the
reascns that we were interested in it. ,

That would, have eee the reason with which I was most
familiar because we were concerned at that time with demonstra-
tions. 7

Mr. Atkisson. What kind of demonstrations
talking about?

Mr. O'Connor. Demonstrations in the nature of May Day
demonstrations.

Mr. Atkisson. Well, my recollection.of the history
of the times is that there were not very many demonstrations
on that scale. ,

Are you talking about May Day itself, or dene like
May Day, but smaller in scale?

Mr. O'Connor. Yes, May Day, would have been, I guess,
the culmination at that time. I was not familiar with anything
that had gone on before that time and any involvement they
may have had in any previous demonstrations.

Mr. Oliphant. Were you ever told that IPS was a

«

center for subersives?

Mr. O'Connor. Yes. If I was not told that, I would have

gotten the impression very definitly. I would say, yes, that

it’ would have been a center for subversives. I probably

was told that. Who would have told me that, I don't know.

Mr. Oliphant. Why would you say that? .

Mr. O'Connor. Because it was and it is still my
impression that not all persons up there were net necessarily
people who would be considered subversives but that there

7 :
were people up there who we would have considered to be
subversive perhaps.

Mr. Oliphant. Did there come a time when you asked Earl
Robert Merritt to try aa infiltrate himself into the IPS?

Mr. O'Connor. Well, Merritt had told us when he first
contacted me that he had already been, well, he was associated
with people up there. He knew people up there. He had been
performing odd jobs up there for the Institute and for
particular individuals up there at the Institute on a
regular basis; that he knew Mr. Waskow, Mr. Raskin, Jo Anne Mal
and some other individuals up there.

Mr. Oliphant. Were these people targets or were there
cases opened on these people?

Mr. O'Connor. Yes, there were.

Mr. Oliphant. Why were there cases opened on them,
if you know? anueuast

“Mr. o'Connor. They would have been security type

cases, We were interested in their activities. Why they were

originally opened, I don't know.

Oliphant. I: asked you if you ever asked Mr. Merritt

in contact with the people. But did you ask him to try and
stay in touch-and try and get a job there?

Mr. O'Connor. Yes, I did.

Mr. Oliphant. Was he able to?

Mr. O'Connor. As I understood it he was up there on
a very regular basis and he did odd jobs for them. He
told us they were considering giving him a permanent job
up there. That never materialized. He never did get what
would be considered a regular job up there.

Mr. Oliphant. Did there come a timé when Mr. Merritt
called you and told you that he had some mail and some
other documents and papers and such from the IPS?

Mr. O'Connor. No.

Mr. Oliphant. Was there ever any time when he called
you in the evening saying he had just taken some mail from

the IPS or taken some documents?

: Mr. of con. Right around Thanksgifng of 1971 he
apparently called Bill. I was out of town. I had taken
leave for the Thanksgiving weekend. He apparently called
Bill and told him that he had obtained some stufé from the
trash up siete aes up meeting Bill and giving him
an envelope that he said came from the trash along with
the contents GE the envelope which were in the trash and gave
them to Bill..

Mr. Oliphant. To your knowledge, did he ever steal
some mail and give it either to you or Mr. Tucker and then,
after this mail was evaluated, did you personally ever
return it to him?

Mr. O'Connor. No, we never had any mail. With respect
to this envelope that he gave us, we had the envelope. We
never did inventory the thing. We Xeroxed a copy of a speech
that was in it. I believe it had been given at People's Grand
Jury earlier by an individual who was connected with IPS.

We took the envelope and its contents and gave it back
to Merritt and told him to return it to the trash of IPS,
if that is where it belonged.

Mr. Oliphant. pia he ever give you a letter from Colgate
University to Professor Waskow, which contained an airline
ticket? bi

Mr. O'Connor. No, he didn't.

Mr. Oliphant. Do you know of your knowledge knowledge

phone -with him?

Mr. O'Connor. Not that I know of.

Mr. Oliphant. Would you be willing to give a sample
of your voice for analysis?

Mr. Oliphant. Did you know that Memitt was a homosexual?

Mr. O'Connor. Yes, I did. ,

Mr. Oliphant. How did you know that?

Mr. O'Connor. He told us.

to be a trait that he had.

that he might be able to get close to people that other indi-
viduals would not be able to get close to.

affairs of other citizens? aati

Mr. O'Connor. No. ‘i

Mr. Oliphant. Did you ever incorporate this information
into any reports?

Mr. O'Connor. Yes. -

Mr. Oliphant. Why?

Mr. O'Connor. Well, because with respect to one individual
for eiebaicetine continued to bring up the fae that the man
was a homosexual.

Mr. Oliphant. Why was this relevant?

Mr. O'Connor. It was relevant, I suppose, because this
was one facet of the man's personality.

As far as I recall it was no secret. The man made
no secret of that fact. It was one of the reasons that we
felt that Merritt had a better chance of getting close
to the individual, again not in an intimate sense.

Mr. Oliphant. What sort of individual was this?

Mr. O'Connor. The individual's name was Jack Davis.

Mr. Oliphant. Why were you interested in him?

Mr. o'connor. He did. I don't know if it was on one
occasion or on two occasions, or what.

He did mention that there were a couple of individuals
who were the victims of extortion as a result of their
sexual activities. He could never take this past the rumor
stage .

We told him that if in fact he could substantiate it
there would be a criminal violation and we would certainly
do something about it. But since that was never taken past
the rumor stage, it was never made a matter of record.

Mr. Flannagan. May we clarify? The criminal violation
is the extortion and not the homosexuality.

Mr. Oliphant. Yes, 18 USC 94.

Did you ever threaten Mr. Merritt regarding his check

violations?

Mr. O'Connor. I never did. That is why, as I explained

at the beginning, we made it perfectly clear that Mr.

Merritt had nothing to worry about as far as we knew.

Mr. O'Connor. I knew he had been an informant because
he said he had been an informant. What he did for the
Metropolitan Police Department specifically, I don't know.
I assume he had apparently had, based on his statements

‘
to me, he would have been concerned with the May Day demonstra-

tions and people involved with it and I guess the Institute
for Policy Studies, too.

Mr. Oliphant. Well, Mr. O'Conncor, you had good relation-
ship with the Intelligence Division at the Metropolitan
Police Department, didn't you?

O'Connor. Myself?

Oliphant. Yes.

O'Connor. I talked to people Pell there occasionally.

Oliphant. When you take on an informant with the
Bureau, someone that just gives information does not instan-
taneously become an informant.

Mr. O'Connor. No, not really.

Mr. Oliphant. He has to be checked out, his reliability,

Mr. o'Connoxr. Well, let's put it this way: I told
him never to ‘take anything wrongfully. If he came across
a leaflet or a pamphlet or something like that, or
anything he had a right to have, that was a different matter,
he coula obviously have that; but as far as taking anything
in the sense of taking it, whether he had a right to have
it or not, no, we never told him that.

Mr. Oliphant. Did you specifically tell him that
if he did not have a right to take given material, he was
not to take it?

Mr. O'Connor. That if he didn't have a right to have
something, that he shouldn't take it, yes, and that he was
never to do anything illegal. I told him this on several

occasions.

, activities? es

theft and break-ins since that would have been the primary

activity that he probably would have been involved in, you

Mr. ‘atkisson. Is it fair to say it was from those
individuals that you first received the impression that IPS
was generally dangerous?

Mr. o'connor. Not necessarily all of them, but I oni
imagine, yes, nor sae probably be agents among those
agents, yes.

Mr. are At the time you were involved in investi-
gating IPS, from which specific person aid you derive, in
your impression of things, from which specific person
did you derive your authority to investigate IPS? Who told
you to do it?

Mr. O'Connor. It would have been probably the supervisor.

Mr. Atkisson. I'm asking where you got your authority.
You are speculating. :

Mr. O'connor. I don't know. I would not have gotten
authority.as such. What I am saying is if you obtained
information which appeared to be pertinent to an investigation
that was being conducted and you were aware, well, obviously
you a that or provided that information to whoever was
interested.

In other words , I knew there was an investigation
and therefore, I would just provide the information, any

«
information that would be ‘pertinent, whether it be IPS or
anything else. - i

Mr. Atkisson. For that purpose, you wrote reports, I

Mr. O'Connor. They would go to the Supervisor first.

Mr. Atkisson. Your supervisor?

Mr. O'Connor. Right.

Mr. Atkisson. Whem would ‘that be? ©

Mr. O*Connor. John Palmer, at that ‘time.

Mr. Atkisson. Is he in the ‘Washington Field Office, or
was he at that time? :

Mr. O'Connor. Yes. I think he still is, too.

Mr. Oliphant. Did you ever apprehend any fugitives as a
result of your study of IPS? id

Mr. O'Connor. Never.

Mr. Oliphant. Did you ever apprehend any fugitives
as a result of your association with Robert Merritt?

Mr. O'Connor. No.

Mr. Atkisson. How long were you involved in the
investigation of IPS?
a we. o'connor. Was I involved?

Mr. Atkisson. Let me put it this way: How long was

your association with Robert Merritt and his association with

IPS? How long did those three things coincide?

the Ist of October when Merritt originally talked to us

to about the end of January, when we told Merrityto stay

away from IPS.

Mr. Oliphant. Why did you tell Merritt to stay away”

‘from IPS?

.
Mr. O'Connor. Well, because it appeared that his efforts
up there were at best counter-productive. He just didn't
belong up there.
Mr. Oliphant. Did you have any other homosexual informants

O'Connor. Informants as such, no.

Oliphant. Well, any other homosexual sources?

Atkisson. Don't give us the names.

Oliphant. We don't need the names.

O'Connor. I know Bill did.

‘Oliphant. Bill Tucker?

O'Connor. Yes, Bill did.

Oliphant. Do you know if either you or Mr. Tucker
ever asked any of these informants or sources, in the most
generic sense, people who gave information or were cooperative
with the Bureau, did you ever ask any of these people to
check up on Merritt? i

"Mr. O'Connor. No.

Mr. Oliphant. Did you ever ask any of them to make

contact with Merritt?

Agent Tucker or any other FBI agents?

Mr. O'Connor. Net that I know of. ‘Do you mean another
informant or homosexual informant?

Not that r can recall.

(Discussion off therecord.)

Mr. O'Connor. I did want to say as far as that
envelope was concerned, the contents of that-~you were asking
about mail, I don't recall that there was any mail in there,

anything that would have obviously come from the mail or

would have been intended for the mail. Whether anything

had been in the mail or not, I don't know. You know, it is

‘conceivable that something had been in the mail, but I don't

think we would have known that. That speech could have
gone through the mail, for instance.

Mr. Oliphant. Did you ever give him a code name?

Mr. O'Connor. No. I called him Butch.

Mr. Oliphant. Was he ever given the name Eric by
you or Mr. Tucker?

Mr. O'Connor. Yes, excuse me, yés.

him, he would either identify himself as Butch or pric
if somebody else answered the phone. But I believe he used
Butch more than he did Eric. .

Mr. Oliphant. why was Merritt terminated?

Mr. o'connor. Merritt was terminated because we found

.

out that he had been furnishing us unreliable information.

Mr. Oliphant. What sort of unreliable information?

Mr. O'Connor. We found out that information he had
been furnishing us concerning Jack Davis was unreliable.
We found out that specific information was unreliable and
we went back and started considering some of the other things
he had told us about Davis. We felt what he might have been
doing was playing both ends against the middle. What he was
doing was furnishing us not only unreliable, but misleading
information.

Mr. Oliphant. Was his termination acrimonious?

Mr. O'Connor. For him, I guess it was.

Mr. Oliphant. Were there harsh words said at the end?

Mr. O'Connor. Not between myself-and Merritt, and not

between Tucker and Merritt, as far as I recall. I do know

“that we told him that we were terminating him. We didn't

tell him why. We told him it was because he had furnished
unreliable information and Iguess we probably told him, or

he could have surmised, it was about Jack Davis, if we did

- ‘Mr. Oliphant. Where, physically, did you go to tell

him that?

Mr. OfConnor. It was up in Rock Creek Park.
Mr. Oliphant. Because you wanted to talk to him?

Mr. O'Connor. It could have been anyplace. We wanted

‘7 :
to get away. We drove up there and pulled off the road and

talked to him. We told him we weren't going to accept any
more information from him on a confidential basis and he
could not consider himself an informant any longer.

Mr. Atkisson. Where did you usually meet with Merritt
when you got information from him?

Mr. O'Connor. It would have been’in any number of places.

Mr. Atkisson. But it was not in the area of Rock Creek
Park?

Mr. O'Connor. Usually in the Dupont ‘Circle Breas Sometime,
we would pick him up and take him out of that area.

Mr. Atkisson. There is no place around the Rock
Creek Parkway where a car can pull off generally; is there?

Mr. O'Connor. Yes. There are some picnic areas up there.
That is where we were, as I recall.

Mr. Oliphant. Did you ask him not to reveal his
relationship with the Bureau after you terminated him?

5 Mr. Oliphant. How did you categorize Merritt? e

6 Mr. o'Connor. He was basically a criminal informant

8 furnishing criminal information.

9 Mr. Oliphant. Did you make any comments regarding

10 his reliability? a

MW Mr. O'Connor. Yes.

13 that he wasn't. i

4 Mr. Oliphant. Don't you have to make some sort of

15 justification to get money for an informant? in
16 Mr. O'Connor. Yes, but he was actually, well, the
47 information he was furnishing us was of value to us as

18 assistance in an investigation that we were conducting,

19 primarily with respect to the time that we were interested in

20 Jack Davis. I think it was probably during that time that

21 he got the bulk of that $1600.

22 Mr. Oliphant. Did you ever arrest Jack Davis for anything?
23 Mr. O'Connor. No.
24 Mr. Oliphant. Why was the information valuable?

25 Mr. O'Connor. On a couple of occasions, he told us,

on one occasiOM that Jack Davis was in contact with Mike

Spiegel. : 7 :

Mr. Oliphant. Was Spiegel a fugitive?

Mr. O'Connor. Yes. These were the people we were
interested in. Those’ investigations were not very easy
investigations. You just didn't go out and pick somebody
up. ‘He also totd us that he had seen Bill Ayers with Jack
Davis on one occasion. He also indicated that Jack Davis
had some knowledge of an individual involved in the Capitol
bombing. This was the type of information he was furnishing
to us.

Mr. Oliphant. Did you ever make any comments to him
regarding Jews? ,

Mr. O'Connor. No. In what sense?

Mr. Oliphant. Well, did you ever tell him that Jews
were liberal?

Mr. O'Connor. No.

Mr. Oliphant. Did you ever tell him that they were behind
or part of, let's say, the Communist threat? _ lial

Mr. Oliphant. Who were the sort of groups that were
intelligence targets?
/ Mr. O'Connor. I guess PCPJ, People's Coalition for

7 the May Day organization. We were interested in some groups

_ the time Merritt began to work for us, were interested in,

Positive and negative information?

tive or negative?

years' experience in the Bureau, would information about the
personal sex lives of individuals at IPS be considered

Mr. Atkisson. All right. Just one more question about
your final conversation with Robert Merritt in Rock Creek Park.
Had you ever at any other time in your experience at the Bureau
of Investigation held a conversation that was in any way
business-related in Rock Creek Park?

Mr. O'Connor. I don't recail offhand, because the thing
is that when you are talking to -- I probably wouldn't have
conducted any kind of normal interview there, but if you are
talking about an informant -- I don't know whether we ever
talked to Merritt there at any other time.

Mr. Atkisson. Where did you meet Merritt on the day you
drove to Rock Creek Park? ,

Mr. O'Connor. That I don't remember. It probably would
have been right around the DuPont Circle area some place.

Mr. Oliphant. Didn't you say before you usually met him

Mr. O'Connor. Let me put it this way: We developed in-

formation that not only was there a problem or discrepancy

concerning Davis' whereabouts on this particular weekend, but

also that much of the information that he had been furnishing
us could not have been correct, you know, over a period of
time. : ,

Mr. Oliphant. You also found things which rebutted infor-
mation which he had given you on prior occasions?

Mr. O'Connor. Very strongly and which really, as far as
I was concerned, had caused us to continue an investigative
interest in an area that we -- what had seemed very credible
to us when it came from Merritt all of a sudden became nothing
but a lot of miscelfaneous information.

Mr. Oliphant. Did you write a report which stated what
information you had got from Merritt that you now felt was
compromised and why you felt it was compromised?

Mr. O'Connor. I did write a memo that would have closed

“Seg riptiants~ what I mean is this: You had been report—
“infie “Hitomnattion he had been giving you on Davis; is that
corréct?  ~"

Mr. O'Connor. Yés.

Mr. Oliphant. You had been incorporating that into
reports; is that true? ,

Mr. O'Connor. Yes.

Mr. Oliphant. So there came a time, then, when you had
reason to believe that some of that information that you had
incorporated in those reports was erroneous; is that correct?

Mr. O'Connor. Right.

Mr. Oliphant. Did you ever write a report specifically
laying out what information now in FBI reports that you had
written or that Tucker had written that you now felt was
erroneous?

Mr. O'Connor. Well, the information -- no, I never did

‘write a report like that.

Mr. Oliphant. Did Tucker?
Mr. O'Connor. No, not that I know of.

Mr. Oliphant. So was that information ever rebutted
in the reports then?
Mx. O'Connor. It would have been rebutted; yes.

Mr. Oliphant. How? ia

Mr. O'Connor. We are getting into the area I was talking



about before. @ eseataeneshgaascenats, @ ResauaEeSeZeaE at
-Mr. Oliphant. You don't have to say exactly what it was.

Mr. O'Connor. It had to do with Davis, the information
that we knew was incorrect, and te knew where this ES eT
had come from and with, respect to the investigation concerning |-
Davis there was something in there that I would have considered

.
to have rebutted or to have contradicted the information that

Merritt had previously furnished Concerning Davis, but I never
did; no -- in answer to your question, I never wrote anything
up. It was understood that this information concerning Davis
was -- much of it or some portion of it -- i

Mr. Oliphant. Would that be readily understandable by
xeading the files? 7 -

Mr. O'Connor. yes; some portion of it was incorrect.

Mr. Oliphant. How could someone understand that without
revealing, what it was? ;

Mr. O'Connor. In other words, if they read something --

Mr. Oliphant. Let's say an objective person read this ten
years from now without the benefit of being able to speak with

you or with whoever the other agents were who spoke with Davis

-and looked, would they see two conflicting reports? Would

they see series of information that came, let's say, from
Merritt and another series of information that came from Davis,
or someone else? ; :

Mr. O'Connor. It would all be -- you know, if they read

Docld:32989695 Page 129



55

the whole sexi of things, they would ._ you know, as much
as we could determine. We didn't go back and ask Merritt how
much of the information that you furnished was unreliable
because, for one thing, as I pointed out, when we went up and
talked to him that day, he protested that nothing he had given

us was false.

.

There was no way we could do that, so what we were doing -
what we had was the information we had Pune which would
have shown up chronologically, I-guess, in the investigative
file.

So if you would have read down the line, all of a sudden
you would have come to a point, as far as I am concerned,
where you would have seen, you know, that we were able to
determine that at least some of the information concerning Davi
was incorrect. I am saying as far as some of the other informa
tion is concerned, I would surmise that it was probably inaccu-
rate.

Mr. Oliphant. But you never memorialized that surmisal;
is that correct?

Mr. O'Connor. I didn't, but I think it probably would
have been done.

Mr. Oliphant. Who would have done it?

Mr. o'connor. The guy who was investigating the Capitol
bombing, 1971. I believe he did. ‘I don't know whether he did

or not.

6 Basically, let respect to these allegations which first
7 started, I think, in the Summer of 1973, even at that time
8 those allegations really centered tetite IPS. Since then they
3 have gone beyond that. Even when those first allegations were
10 made, I didn't recall specifically the details of some of the
Ju things that we were talking about, and I don't think there was
12 ~any way we could have. About the only way we could have would
13 have been to look in files or try tc rely on memory as best we
14 could. And still today, if we are talking about some of these
15. other areas concerning which the man has made allegations, we
16 are dealing with even a longer period of time, and some of
17 them I know -~ I know we didn't have any interest in the
aa organization he is talking about, but if we did have an inter-
19 est in the organization, you know, I am trying to be completely
20 candid with you with respect to what we were interested in and
21 what we are trying to do so that we just don't say we weren't
22 interested in people at all, but, you know, the specifics of
23 incidents or the specifics of the information he was furnishing
24 || I don't remember.”

Mr. O'Connor. In the trash, if that is where it belonged,
at IPS. ,

I frankly didn't like that situation at all. — .

Mr. Oliphant. Why?

Mr. O'Connor. Because, first of all, Merritt had been
told not to take anything he shouldn't have had. We didn't
want him to for three reasons, really: Number pal because
if he took anything and it came to the attention of anybody,
he was no good as an informant anymore. We didn't want him to
do anything illegal. I personally didn't want him doing any-
thing illegal. The Bureau wouldn't have wanted him to, and I

didn't. He had been told before, and I reminded him of that

after this incident.

: Mr. O'Connor. First.of all, as I said; it. was something
that we really didn't: want. -We didn't want it. And, I don't
know, perhaps —~.whether he did something illegal in taking
that thing or not, I really didn*t know.- Whether taking it
from the trash was illegal or not, in my mind I.wasn't sure.

Because of that, I did copy that one speech, but appar-
ently there ae nothing else in the thing that would have been
worth copying, or it would have been copied.

Mr. Oliphant. You made no real report of this, did you,
that he had come to you with a package of material that he

alleged had come from the trash?

Mr. O'Connor. No; it isn't set forth that way, because we

normally wouldn't. It is my understanding we wouldn't set. forth

the fact that it came from a specific spot.

Mr. Oliphant. I am reading from a report by Tucker, and
it is on 11/29/71, and says, “On 11/26/71, wr-4015-PCI --"

ments. 7 ,

“Mr. Oliphant. I would think you would be.

Mr. Atkisson. You understand in addition you have the
right to ask us to clarify any question you don't understand.
We don't want you to guess or speculate about any subject we
may bring up here. If you want a question repeated or clari-
fied, ask us to do so. We are asking for your testimony from
your own knowledge, not from what you think somebody else may
know.

Mr. Tucker. I will.

ur. Oliphant. Agent Tucker, would you give us a brief
resume of your career with the Bureau?

TESTIMONY OF WILLIAM TIMOTHY TUCKER, SPECIAL AGENT,

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

Mr. Tucker. I entered on duty with the FBI on March 17,

1969. After a four-month training period, I was assigned to

the Jacksonville Division, which covers the Northern District

of Florida.

: I was subsequently appointed within the division to work
in the Fort Walton Beach, Florida, resident agency, and I
stayed there until roughly between August 19, 1969, and
October 28, 1970, and approximately on the lst of November,
1970, I reported to the Washington Field Office of the FBI.

I have been at the Washington Field Office for almost five

years exactly. During that time, I have worked on -- would you

like me to go into my work?

ime. Oliphant. Yes, I would.

Mr. Tucker. Initially, I worked on background investiga-
tions for a period of approximately five months. In March of
1971, I would say, I was assigned to work on the May Duy,
covering the May Day demonstrations. Subsequently, I was re-

+
assigned to the squad which handled -- previously I had been
temporarily assigned there -- I was permanently assigned to the
squad handling domestic intelligence and remained there until
August, 1974, and then transferred to work in organized
crime special, and in March of this year, I was reassigned

again, and now I am working violations of the Federal Escape

and Rescue Statutes and bank robbery.

Mr. Oliphant. Prior to your stint with the domestic
intelligence group, had you ever had any prior contact
officially with the new left or with the radical movement?

Mr. Tucker. Would you clarify that?

Mr. Oliphant. As an FBI agent, had you ever been
assigned to investigate radical movements, subversive move-
ments?

Mr. Tucker. Prior to coming to Washington?

Mr. Oliphant. Prior to coming to Washington, D.C.

Mr. Tucker. No, I had not.

Mr. Oliphant. What specific squads were you working on

when you worked on the domestic intelligence assignments?

Mr. Tucker. It was one squad and designated in the
Washington Field Office of the FBI as S-7, "S" standing for
security, seven meaning the 7th Security Squad, seven out of
nine.

Mr. Oliphant. Seven out of nine squads in the Washington
Field Office, or seven out of nine security squads?
4

Mr. Tucker. Seven out of nine security squads and C-squad:
for criminal and "A" for applicants.

Mr. Oliphant. What was S-7-assigned to do?

Mr. Tucker. Primarily we were assigned to investigate

those persons and/or groups who posed -- we had legalistic

terns, and I am trying to come up with that -- who could
possibly be involved in those acts which would consist in
espionage, sedition, sabotage, or disruption in the normal
functions of the United States Governmént.

Mr. Oliphant. Did you have a number of targets you were
Looking at?

Mr. Tucker. When I was assigned to the S~-7 squad, my
work, however -- we had a two-fold responsibility on the squad.
We were also assigned certain criminal violations. The work
I did was ninety-nine percent criminal. The investigations I
was conducting were unlawful flight to avoid prosecution inves-
tigations and anti-riot law investigations.

What we did was we broke the- squad into a sub-squad.

Mr. O'Connor, myself, and two other agents were assigned to

investigate basically the Weathermen faction of the Students
for a, Democratic Society; not to develop intelligence on it,
but to locate the members of ‘the weathexmen who were Federal
fugitives.

Ivc, Cliphant. Were there intelligence targets that
were designated groups and individuals who were considered

y
subversive to go along with the legalistic definition you
were groping for?

Mr. tucker. Before I go into that, when I was sent up
here, I had tc consult with the Legal Division, and I was
given the agreement which we signed with the FBI regarding
confidentiality, and I was told that agreement was only waived
vis-a-vis my dealings with Eari Robert Merritt, and I was not
to discuss anything which involved one, ongoing investigations;
two, anything which would endanger an FBI source; or, three,
any information which would jeopardize third-party sources.

Mr. Oliphant. Mr. Tucker, all we are asking for now is
we are trying to get the Merritt investigation into proper
perspective. We are not asking for something which would
reveal a source or reveal an ongoing investigation, or put
anyone in jeopardy.

What we are asking for is, were there targets? You don't
have to tell us what they were. Were there targets, intelli-
gence targets?

Mr. Tucker. Targets?

<. Flannagan. Off the record, please.

(Discussion off the record.)

Mr. Pooeer There were cases opened on varicus groups
and individuals.

Mr. Oliphant. Was one of these groups the IPS?

Mr. Tucker. Yes.. By IPS, you mean the Institute for
Policy Studies?

Mr. Oliphant. That is correct.

Now, who designated the IPS as a target, or, if you know,
how was the investigation opened on that?

Mr. Tucker. My involvement with the Institute of Policy
Studies was not -- I was not involved in investigating the
Institute of Policy Studies.

Mr. Oliphant. Were you interested in certain individuals
who were in the Institute for Policy Studies?

Mr. Tucker. No, I wasn't. In the sense that I was not
tasked with the case assignment if there were cases on the
individuals. I was not tasked with that responsibility of
investigating the institution or any case on individuals.

Mr. Oliphant. What was your interest with the IPS, then?

Mr. Tucker. Any violation of the Federal Harboring

‘Mr. Oliphant. Did there come a time when you became
acquainted with a fellow by the name of Earl Robert Merritt,
Jre? ;

My. Tucker. Yes, I did.

Mr. Oliphant. Would you tell us about your relationship
with him? :

Mr. Tucker. I was the alternate agent on a case, an
informa case in which he was the informant with whom we were
dealing. Mr. O'Connor was the case agent.

Mr. Oliphant. Did he become an informant for the Bureau?

Mr. Tucker. Yes, he did.

Mr. Oliphant. Did you participate in qualifying him as an
informant?

Mr. Tucker. No.

Mr. Oliphant. There is a process, isn't here! that a
person goes through before they can be qualified as an informan
for the Bureau?

Mr. Tucker. Again, I don't think I can go into our
internal policies --

Mr. Oliphant. Yes or no; there is a policy, I mean --

Mr. Tucker. There is a set policy; yes.

Mr. Oliphant. All right.

jewels; okay?

we. Tucker. Okay.

Mr. Oliphant. , Is one of the bases of the investigation,
for want of a better word, the process to make sure that the
informant is reliable? That would be one of the things you
would be looking for; is that correct?

Mr. Tucker. Of course.

Mr. Oliphant. Did you know that he had been an informant
for the Metropolitan Police Department?

Mr. Tucker. Yes.

Mr. Oliphant. Did you check with the Metropolitan Police
Department to find out if he had been reliable?

Mr. Tucker. I did not check.

Mr. Oliphant. Do you know if anyone checked?

-Mr. Tucker. No, I do not know that.

Mr. Oliphant. Do you know why not?

Mr. Tucker. No, I don't know why not, but I would like
to comment on that. j

Mr. Oliphant. Certainly.

Mr. Tucker. I knew the individual who operated him at
the Metropolitan Police Department and informally discussed the
fact that he had been released by him and now we were operating
him, so it wasn't that we weren't aware of why he left them

and came to us.

Mr, Oliphant. Did you, during your informal conversations, |.
ever ‘ask if he had been reliable?

Mr. Tucker. I don't think the specific question of

reliability was raised.
Mr. Oliphant. Did you ever ask what sort of activities he|
had been performing for the Metropolitan Police Department?
Mr. mucker. This is an area you don't get into. When
you are talking to another agent regarding dealing with a
source, you would not broach those kinds of subjects, because
those are sacrosanct.

Mr. Oliphant. So it is safe to say you were not apprised

of what kind of activity he had been doing with the Metropoli-

Mr. Tucker. From the Metropolitan Police Department.
Mr. Oliphant. Did you receive information from any other

source as to what sort of activity he had been doing?

Mr. Tucker. From Merritt, himself.

Mr. Oliphant. What did Meritt tell’ you he had been doing
with the Metropolitan Police Department?

Mr. Tucker. Again, I was the alternate agent, and my
information will not be as complete as Mr. O'Connor’s, because
- he was primarily responsible, although we worked as partners,
and would often, in face-to-face dealings with Merritt, I

would say almost ninety-nine percent of the time, we were there

had to average it out how many times they talked; so getting
back to your question, I. would say we knew that he had dealt
with the Institute for Policy Studies prior to coming with us
and had done some work on the gathering of intelligenc.: on
the activities of those people who had come to Washington to .
i ;
participate in the May Day demonstrations.
Mr. Oliphant. Did he ever tell you that he had performed
any breakins for the Metropolitan Police Department?
Mr. Tucker. . No, he did not.
Mr. Oliphant. Did he ever tell you he had taken mate-
rials from various organizations for the Metropolitan Police

Mr. Tucker. No, he did not.
Mr. Oliphant. Did anyone ever tell you either of those
two facts?
Mr. Tucker. No one ever told me that.
Mr. Attkisson. How about the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,
and Firearms?
Mr. Tucker. No one, to include anyone.
Mr. Attkisson. Were you aware of any connection between
Earl Robert Merritt, Jr., and ATF?

Mr. Tuckex. There is only one incident. On approxi-
mately the 26th of November, I believe that was a Wednesday eve
ing, he called, and he said --
. Mr. Oliphant. Where were you?
Mr. Tucker. He called our office, who called me to let me
know he had called, and he left a number. So I called him
back, and ‘he said he had obtained some materials from the trash
at IPS. This was, I believe, the Wednesday before Thanksgiving
and that Friday I met with him in Lafayette Park, and he turned
over those items to me consisting of a manila envelope with
papers in it. It appeared to me that it did come from the
trash.
Mr. Oliphant. Why do you say that?
‘Mr. Tucker. There were crumpled message slips, and the
items appeared soiled, as I recollect. I believed it had

come from the trash.

Mr. Tucker. No. Again, there was no inventory made of
these items. .

Mer. Oliphant. When he called you on the phone, did you
ask him to look at any of the postmarks on the letters?

Mr. Tucker. There was no discussion of letters.

Mr. Oliphant. There was no discussion at all regarding
the substance of the letters; is that correct? Or the substance
of the materials he had taken?

Mr. Tucker. There may have been, but I cannot recall the
substance of it. I do recall he has made certain allegations
that I ordered him to open mail he had found. J did not do
that. There was no discussion of any mail in those materials.

report, within the FBI a report is a compilation of information
which is received and written by the case agent. In this
case it would have been the case agent on the IPS case. I
do not know if the case agent «ver compiled anything from what
he had given me and put it in the report.

Mr. Oliphant. Did you show this material to the case
agent?

Mr. Tucker. No, I did not.

Mr. Oliphant. Do you know if O'Ccnnor showed it to the
case agent?

Mr. Tucker. I do not know.

Mr. Oliphant. Did you copy any of the material and
memorialize it in writing in any way, shape, or form?

Mr. Tucker. I did not, but Mr. O'Connor, I understand,
did regarding a speech which was given by a Mr. Wolfson at
the Peoples Grand Jury.

Mr. Oliphant. This speech was found in the garbage, the
Wolfson speech?

Mr. Tucker. Yes.

‘why were you interested in that?
Mr. Tucker. TI didn't put it in the files. “het me
explain. Mr. O'Connor put it in the file. It was information

about IPS, There was‘a case on IPS. We thought that the —

case agent might be interested in that kind of information.

2 Flanagany Who was the case agent, incidentally?

Mr. Tucker. There were numerous case agents. I cannot
recall who the case agent was. “At this time I would not

I can check for you.

Mr. Oliphant. Do you know what the subject matter
of the investigation was? You don't-have to go into detail.
Was the subject matter subversion?

Mr. Tucker. Yes.

Mr..Qliphant. I'm showing Mr. Tucker a memorandum dated
November 29, 1971.

Mr. Tucker. That is correct.

Mr. Oliphant. Now, could you tell us what, if anything,
that memorandum has to do with subversion or with fugitives?

Mr. Tucker. It has nothing to do with subversion or
fugitives.

remember it, the day of his termination?

Mr. Tucker. I don't recall the exact date. ‘I do
recall we picked him up and drove him to a secluded spot
in Rock Creek Park. It was not a secluded spot, I cannot
remember the exact street. It is where there is an old mill
and there is a dam there. It is not Fletcher's, the name
of the mill. That escapes me now. We confronted him with the
information that we believed that he was lying us.

He denied it. Admittedly there ere heated words
between us. He was never physically abused or things like

that. I was upset at the time. I was rather firm with

- Merritt but I don't believe abusive. |

Mr. Oliphant. How upset were you?

Mr. Tucker. That would be hard to describe.

Mr. Oliphant. Well, describe your actions and describe
what you said.

Mr. Tucker. I think the strongest thing I did was pound
on ‘the picnic table and call him a liar.

Mr. Oliphant. Did you threaten him in any way,
shape, or form?

Mr. Tucker. Absolutely not.

Mr. Oliphant. pia it then become apparent to you that
maybe some of the other information he had given to you was
also not true?

Mr. tucker. Yes.

Mr. Oliphant. Did you ever make a xeport in a sense,

in essence, correcting the previous erroneous information

_ that had: been incorporated in the FBI files?

Mr. Tucker. I had made no such report. I had no informa-
tion as to which information he had given me was erroneous.

Mr. Oliphant. Did you ever maké a report or notation or

“any sort of memorialized writing that it now appeared

. that some of the information that had been given in the

past by this informant --

Mr. Tucker. I did not. Mr. O'Connor did.

Mr. Oliphant. What did he say, to the best of your
recollection?

Mr. Tucker. To the best of my recollection it was
that we have received information, I am trying to get the
exact words as best I can -~- that Merritt -- I guess “unreliablp"
was the word we used, was "unreliable."

guess, somewhere between 100 ana 200--maybe not that
high; maybe 100. That is a ballpark figure.

Mr. Oliphant. On how ane individuals, again a ballpark
figure, was he supplying information?

Mr. Tucker. Maybe 25.

Mr. Oliphant. How much money did you pay him or

. ’

did the Bureau pay him over the time that he was working
with the Bureau?

Mr. Tucker. I never have conductea an audit.
I think it may have been somewhere around fifteen to seventeen
hundred dollars, in that figure.

Mr. Oliphant. Would that include both payments and
expenses or was there any differentiation made?

Mr. Tucker. There is a differentiation. I think that
would be a cumulative amount.

Mr. Oliphant. What sort of expenses would he have?
What would be his expenses?

Mr. Tucker. Expenses would be actual, anything he
would have to pay out of his pocket.

Mr. Oliphant. “Was he paid on a regular basis?

Mr. Tucker. No. He was paid on a c.o.d. basis.

Mr.. Oliphant. What was about the most money that he

_was ever given at one time?

Mr. Tucker. Again I am guessing, $100.

That is the upper limit.

| Mr. Oliphant. Isn't it true that when you pay
an informant you have to justify fhis in writing
internally in the Bureau?

Mr. Tucker. That is affirmative.

Mr. Oliphant. Now when you justified this, did you ~~ i

have to qualify Merritt as a reliable informant?
’

Mx. Tucker. I don't think, I don't know if I wrote

any of those requests for payments. I may have written one.

I don't really know. You have to justify your requests,
though, when you do make such an application, yes.

Mr. Oliphant. Did you see any justifications for Merritt
that either you or O'Connor wrote?

Mr. Tucker. Yes.

Mr. Oliphant. What did you say in those?

Mr. Tucker. Do you want me to give you an outline
of how these go? I cannot reply specifically. It runs somethin
like this. "During the period of so and so to such and such
captioned source provided information on the following
matters." Then you list them and give a brief capsule
of the information which he provided. In the body you
would say "It is therefore requested that the captioned
source be paid so much and then you break it down if

there were expenses, for the information he has provided.

That memorandum then would go to the special agent in charge

who would have to approve it along with some other papers

Mr. Oliphant. _Agent tucker, there has to be -some
sort of subjective ied of yours that, or whoever is
preparing the voucher that he is reliable, that it is good
information.

Mr. ker! You would not utilize reliability as a
criterion at this time. This is done in semi-annual letters
regarding your informant and/or initial justifications.

Mr. Oliphant. Did you write a semi-annual letter?

Mr. Tucker. I did not.

Mr. Oliphant. Did O'Connor?

Mr, Tucker. He may have. I don't know. He would have,
when you convert someone from a potential informant to
a full-fledged informant the question of reliability
would have to be established.

Mr. Oliphant. Was that written?

Mx. Tucker. Yes.

Mr. Oliphant. What was said about Merritt?

Mr. Tucker. Based on the information we knew he was
reliable.

Mr. Oliphant. I just have one further question.
Regarding all the materials which were handed over in
November of 1971, in the packet which allegedly came from

the trash, we ‘take it these were quite extensive, that there

was a lot of stuff in there, is that correct?

“Mr. Tucker. Again, there was no inventory made.
If I had to hazard a guess, again, it probably would not
equal more than what you have in front of you right there.

Mr. Oliphant. Why were only certain things inco’‘porated?
Why didn't they incorporate everything?

Mr. Tucker. I didn't make the determination as to
what was going to be maintained and what was going to be
copied. So I cannot really say what the motivation was.
Again, it appears to me that the items which were maintained
were background information regarding IPS and its internal
operations.

Mr. Oliphant. My question to you is: “Referring to
the November 29, 1971 memoranda that you were shown,
this states that you were telephonically advised about
three items which you stated had no real value substantively
to either a subversive or a fugitive investigation.

Now they were written down as background information.
My question to you is: If you thought these were significant
enough to put in, coming to you over the telephone, are you

saying that the other information that you got from

-the trash there was even less interesting, or of lesser

value than this sort of information which you did see fit
to incorporate?

Mr. Tucker. In retrospect, I would have to say yes.

Again -- ; :

Mr. Oliphant. Was it ever written in a report that
you had received information from Merritt that allegedly
came from the trash? Did that ever come in a report?

Mr. Tucker. I don't believe so. Again, I did not have the
case assigned to me and do not know if the case agent

Mr. Oliphant. Wouldn't that be normal, to state how
you got the information?

; something along this line. On such and such a day such

and such a source provided the following.

Mr. Oliphant. I have no further questions.

Mr. ¢ lannagai. Agent -Tucker, I\tthink you indicated

Merritt was from roughly November, 1971, through May of

1972, is that correct?

Mr. Tucker. Correct.

respect to the Community Book Store, that you never,
to your ‘knowledge, never received anything from that
establishment.

Mr..Tucker. That is correct.

Mr, annagan,’ You never received any petitions,

membership lists, literature?

Mr. eee To my knowledge at this point, no. I
may have because he would often come in with literature
announcing demonstrations and the like.

Now he gave, -and it may have been egoeeea that he gave
us information from the Community Book Store, but at this
point I don't know.

Mr. Oliphant. Mr. Tucker, let me ask you this: What
did you do with all the documents you got, allegedly from
the trash, the middle of November? What happened to them?

Mr. Tucker. We gave them back to Mr. Merritt and he
was told to take them back to IPS. He got them from the
trash and that is where they belonged.

; Mr. Oliphant. Is that usual, to return things
to the trash?

Mr. Tucker.again we were not too sure about that
_situation. The legal question of abaridonment is really not
a very settled one.

Mr. Oliphant. Have you ever returned anything to the

trash before?

Mr. Tucker. That is the only time I ever got anything

Mr. Oliphant. Have you ever heard of people returning
things to the trash after they used them, agents?

Mr. Tucker. No, I haven't.

Mr. Oliphant. Why were they returned, why were these
documents returned to Merritt?

“Mr. Tucker. Again, because we weren't very sure of the qud¢s-
tion of abandonment in this case.

Mr. Oliphant. You weren't sure they had been abandoned?

Mr. Tucker. No. We weren't sure of the law on
abandenment. 7

Mr. Oliphant. Are you not sure of the word "abandonment"
or were you not sure they had been abandoned?

Mr. Tucker. I had no reason to doubt that he got
them from the trash at that time. Can I answer that way?

Mr. Oliphant. Sure. .

Mr. Tucker. If that satisfies your question.

Mr. Oliphant. Did you return any other documents to
him? ,

Mr. Tucker. No.

“Mr. Oliphant. Then why did you return these?

ON INTELLIGENCE (HSC)

eee on tO

r)|sge

PURPOSE:

Yo recommend that Legal Counsel Division consult
with the Department to seek guidance as to the manner in
which the Bureau should respond to HSC requests for materiale
4n Bureau files relating to organizations and individuals
currently involved in civil litigation with the Bureau, and
to ascertain how Bureau personnel should respond te similar
inquiries while giving teatimony in either Executive or
Piblic sessions.

DETAILS:

In September and October, 1575, the HSC requested,
among other items, information from Bureau files concerning
@ number of individuals associated with the Socialist Workers
Party (S¥P) and information from the file on the Institute
for Policy Studies (IPS), a8 well as the file of former
Bureau informant Earl Robert Merritt, Jr.

On 11/5/75, Bureau representatives Mr. %. H. Wannall,
My. R. L. Shackelferd, and 4. D. Ryan furnished depositions
to the HSC concerning mmerous uatters including Bureau
investigations of 5 individuals affiliated with the SVP
and this Bureau's investigetion of the IPS. HSC representatives
indicated at that time, that these topics will be the sub-
ject of testimony scheduled for public session 11/15/75.
With regard to HSC inquiries concerning the 5 8WP individuals,
the thrust of the inquiries centered around this Bureau's
authority to investigate the SWP and ite members, which is
ane of the main issues to be resolved in 2 pending civil
guit which the S¥P has brought against the Bureau, With
regard to the IPS, HSC inquiries centered around this
Bureau's authority to investigate thie organization, as
well ag public charges made against this Bureau by

Memorandum to Yr, ¥, 0. Yannall
Re: U. S, louse Select Comittee On Intelligence (HSC)

Earl Robert Merritt, Jr., a former Bureau informant who
furnished information concerning the IPS. Charges by
Herritt have been publicly refuted by thie Bureau. It
is noted that the IFS is also currently involved in
civil Litigation with this Bureau charging illegal
wiretapping and breaking and entering.

Additionally, on 11/5/75, 2 Bureau Agents,
against whom Merritt has levied hie unfounded charces, were
deposed by HSC members at which time the Agents were
accompanied by the Departmental Attorney who is handling
this litigation.

OBSERVATIONS :

In view of the pending HSC request for material
relating to IPS, as well ne information pertaining to
Sarl Robert Merritt, Jr., who is to be a principal witness
in the IPS civil litigation, and because the HSC
representatives have indicated that the questioning of
Bureau officials scheduled for the HSC public hearing on
11/18/75 will involve matters directly related to the
Governnent's actions in the defense of the civil suits
regarding both the IPS and SWP, it ig felt that Departmental
advice should be sought prior to this Bureau responding
to or engaging in further response to the HSC in these areas.

RECOMMEND ATIONS :

1) That Legal Counsel Division consult with the
Departwent to obtain advice as to how the Bureau should
respond to HSC requests for aateriala concerning FPS and
Merritt, and advise the Intelligence Division by memorandun
of the results.

2) Legal Counsel Division should determine from
the Department, the parameters to which Bureau representatives
should confine theiy testimony in either Executive or public
seasions concerning IPS and SWP and advise the Intelligence
Bivision by menorandun.

Legal Counsel

U.S, RECORDING COMPANY;
HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE

At 3:00 p.m. on November 20, 1975, Joe Tait, U.S. Recording |

Company, telephotiically advised me that he has been requested to

appear for a staff interview by representatives of captioned committee

at 11:00 a.m. on November 21, 1975, at which time he anticipates being
served with a subpoena requiring him to produce his records concerning
dealings with the Martin Kaiser Company. Mr. Tait requested advice
concerning an appropriate response to the demand for his records. He
said that the records that would be involved in the demand are all classified
and he regarded that classification as binding. I told Mr. Tait that in view
of the fact the documents were classified, it would be necessary for the
matter to be presented to the Department for a determination as to
declassification of the documents or for the development of procedures

for submission of the documents to the Committee in classified form.

Mr. Tait interrupted me and said that he would prefer that I~
furnish this information to his attorney and he requested me to call q
Bryan Gettings at telephone number 525-2260,

I called Bryan Gettings and advised him of Mr. Tait's request that
I inform him of the difficulties involved in responding to a subpoena for
the production of documents where the documents involved are classified.
I told Mr. Gettings that it would be necessary for the fact that the subpoena
was issued for classified documents to be brought to the attention of the
Gepartment for possible declassification or for the development of appropriate
procedures for submission of classified documents to the Committee.

Re: U.S. Recording Company

”

I also told Mr. Gettings that it would be appropriate for him to
alert the Committee staff to the problems involved in supplying the
Commitee with documents that aye classified. itold Mr Gettings that
I would not counsel him as to what advice he should give his client, but
the determination would be entirely his.

Mr. Gettings considered the matter briefly and then told me that
he would advise Mr. Tait to appear in response to the subpoena, but
to take no documents with him. Further, he would advise Mr. Tait
to explain te the Committee staff that the documents are all classified
and that they would continue to respect the limitations imposed on disclosure
of that information due to the classification. He also would advise the
Committee staff that should the Committee desire to inquire further concerning
the documents that such inquiries should be made directly to the Department
of Justice, He said that he would not communicate with the Department of
dustice directly at this time concerning this matter, but would leave such
communication up to the Committee staff.

Upon completion of my discussion with Mr. Gettings, I telephonically
advised Mr. Callahan and Mr. Bassett of the results. Mr. Callahan imuired
concerning the current validity of the classification of the documents.

I discussed that matter with Mr. Bassett who advised me that the
classification of the documents had previously been reviewed and found to be
valid. I requested Mr. Bassett to verify that information in light of the
fact that he advised me the classification may have been based on purchasing
regulations rather than Executive Order 11652. Further, I told Mr. Bassett
that it may be necessary for the Bureau to be prepared to submit the documents
to the Departmental Review Committee for a determination as to whether
the documents should be declassified for purposes of responding to the
subpoena,

At approximately 4:15 p.m., Mr. Daly advised me that Tim Oliphant,
of the House Select Committee, called and requested the Bureau to authorize
Mr. Tait to release the documents to the Committee in view of Mr. Tait's
reluctance to do 80 based on their classification. I directed Mr. Daly to
call Oliphant and respond to his request by telling him that the documents
were classified and request Oliphant to permit us an opportunity to review

Memorandum to Mr, Adams
-Re: U.S. Recording Company

the documenis to determine the validity of the classification and to make
any necessary special arrangements for their delivery such as excision
of sensitive material,

Mr. Daily discussed this matter with Mr. Oliphant and then advised
me that Oliphant was agreeable to changing the time of the testimony from
11:00 a.m. on November 2Zist, to the late afternoon of November 21st,
and further that he was agreeable to having the documents reviewed and
sensitive information concerning the subjects of the purchases deleted.
Oliphant indicated that they were principally interested in the amounts
of the purchases and not the subject matter of the purchases.

I called Bryan Gettings at approximately 4:30 p.m. and told him
that the Committee staff had agreed to postpone the appearance to permit
the Bureau an opportunity to review the records and to make necessary
excisions concerning sensitive information describing the materials
purchased. I also explained to Mr. Geitings that due to arrangements
between the Department of Justice and the Committee, classified documents
were made available on Committee request. Therefore, I asked Mr. Gettings
for an opportunity to have the Bureau review the documents he was holding
for Mr. Tait in order for necessary excisions to be made prior to Mr. Tait’s
appearance in response tothe Committee request. I told him that the
Bureau wag not in a position to direct Mr. Tait to decline te appear or to
produce the documents based simply on the fact that they were classified, but
that we did have an agreement with Mr. Oliphant that we would be permitted
to excise certain portions,

My. Gettings told me that he understood the limitations under which
the Bureau had to respond to Committee requests, and that he would
agree to have a Bureau representative review the documents and make
necessary excisions. However, he said that he wasi not bound by any
agreements with the Committee or by arrangements by the Attorney General
and that he did not feel that Mr. Tait or he should be inconvenienced by the
Committée unnecessarily. Therefore, he may advise Mr. Tait to decline
to appear until the first part of Cecember, 1975.

He said that he had determined that the Committee could not have
@ subpoena issued and served on Mr. Tait prior to that time. Mr. Gettings
said that he would contact Mr. Oliphant, discuss the proposals, and advise
me of hie decision.

‘Memoraniium to Mr. Adams
Re: U.S, Recording Company

é

I calied Assistant Director Cochran and alerted him to the fact
that it may be necessary on the morning of November 21st for Laboratory
representatives to review the documents being held by Mr. Gettings
in order to make necessary excisions of sensitive information. He agreed
that he and William Harward of the Laboratory would be available for that
purpose and he requested that Mr. Keehan of the Inspection Division contact
him to make necessary arrangements.

I advised Mr. Keehan that Mr. Gettines had agreed to make the
documents available for Burean review and that he should be available
on the morning of November 21st to review the documents for purposes
of the current Inspection Division inquiry. If this arrangement can be
made it will be possibie for the Inspection Division to have accessto the
documents before they are submitted to the Committee and perhaps become
unavailable for our review, Mr. Keehan indicated he would be available
on November 21st.

At 5:20 p.m., Mr. Gettings called me and invited a representative
of the Bureau to come to his office at 1400 North Uhle Street located at
Court House Square in Arlington, Virginia, to pick up the records in
question and transport them to Bureau Headquarters for review and
appropriate excision. He said that he had contacted the Committee staff
and they have agreed that Mr. Tait will appear Friday, November 2ist,
without his records but to discuss the purchase arrangements with the FBI
and with Martin Kaiser. He said that the Committee staff agreed to this
arrangement for the interview on the 21st, but it may be that the Committee
will insist upon production of the records at a iater time. I advised
Mr. Bassett and Mr. Keehan of the Inspection Division and requested
Mr, Keehan to pick up the records at Mr. Gettings' office at 10:00 a.m,
on November 21st.

Tadvised Mr. Cothyan: that the records will be available in the
Bureau and requested him to confer with Mr. Keehan and to arrange for
appropriate excision and he agreed.

RE: ANFORMATION CONCERNING
EARL ROBERT MERRITT, JR.

Reference is made to HSC letter dated October 28,
1975, which requests, in part, "access to any and all
files at FBI concerning Earl Robert Merritt, Jr."

This Bureau is becoming concerned about the HSC
practice of submitting requests for all information in
Bureau files concerning named individuals, with no indication
as to the reason for the inquiry, As the HSC is avare,
this Lureau has, at one time or another, maintained a
confidential relationship with many of the individuals
named in prior USC requests, primarily in requests dated
September 24, 1975, October 3, 1975, and November 4, 1975.
It has been this Bureau's understanding that in responding
to HSC requests, this Bureau would not be foxced to divulge
the identity of its sourees, This Dureau feels it is
essential, therefore, to meet with HSC representatives for
the purpose of formating guidelines for future handling
of requests pertaining to individuals, It would be appre-
elated if the HSC would contact the Bureau liaison agent
with the HSC for the purpose of arranging requested meeting.
Awox Dir — Replies to requests contained in HSG requests of Getober 3,
Dees AD hws 1975, and November 4, 1975, willbe held in abeyance pending
: formation of such guidelines.

NOTE:

Earl Robert Merritt, Jr., was a paid criminal
informant of the Washington Field Office from 10/1/71 until
he was discontinued 6/1/72 as doubt had been cast upon his
credibility, Merritt has subsequently made unfounded alle~
gations of having engaged in illegal tactics in the Bureau's
behalf and has also alleged improper conduct on the part of
handling Agents. These allegations have been refuted in
affidavits submitted by concerned personnel, Merritt
furnished information to this Bureau concerning Institute
for Policy Studies (IPS) which was under investigation during
the period he was an informant.

This response to HSC request has been coordinated
with Assistant Director John A, Mintz, Legal Counsel
Division.

Above~mentioned HSC letter of 9/24/75 requested
access to material relating to six individuals, one of whom
is a current informant. HSC was granted access to material
relating to the five Bureau informants and was confidentially
advised of the informant status of the sixth, and no material

RE: SECURITY INDEX (SI) AND -
ADMINISTRATIVE INDEX (ADEX)

order for the HSC to resolve any questions relating to
the operation and maintenance of the ADEX and to enable
the HSC to comply with its mandate in every respect,

this Bureau will, upon request, continue to make the ADEX
list available for review at FBIHQ to appropriate HSC
representatives.

Authority for maintaining the ADEX stems from.the
Attorney General and such authority is set forth in a letter
from the Attorney General to the Director of the FBI dated
October 22, 1971, a copy of which is enclosed with this
memorandum,

Those documents pertaining to the SI to which access
was requested are available for review by appropriately
cleared HSC staff members at FBI Headquarters. In this
regard, it is to be noted that authority for maintaining the
SI stemmed from the Attorney General in connection with the
Departmental portfolio entitled "Program for Apprehension and
Detention of Persons Considered Potentially Dangerous to
the National Defense and Public Safety of the United States."

Detailed information and documents concerning what
steps were to be taken in event of a national emergency are
set forth in the above-mentioned portfolio which, since that
document originated with the Department of Justice, should
be obtained from that source,

As has previously been stated, the ADEX is reviewed
continuously and on a mon*hly basis is brought up to date
with names being added and deleted. The SI list was prepared
in the same manner and, as with the former SI, when a new
monthly ADEX list is prepared copies of the old list
are destroyed inasmuch as they are outdated and no longer
serve a useful purpose. Also, as you have previously been
advised, names appearing on the former SI and the ADEX
have been printed on 5 x 8 cards with a single name printed
on cach card. Background information, file numbers, and
type of activity in which the individual is engaged are also
placed on these cards. As was explained te Mr. Vermeire on
October 17, 1975, approximately 15,000 of these cards, all
outdated, have been located at FBI Headquarters. These



#

RE: SECURITY Inpex (SI) AWD
ADMINISTRATIVE INDEX (ADEX)

cards include some which centaiz the identity of individuals
who were maintained or the Priority ITI level of the former
$I and all ADEX cards deleted or cancelled since ita
Aineeption.

During the initial period af establishing the
ADEX, in order to obviate the aged for conducting massive
file reviews, the Anrx consisted primarily of the identity
©f those individuals who hed been maintained on the fornar
81. Although these names were originally placed in this
mannex on the new ADEX, an cases were reviewed under our then
existing reporting procedures, each case was to be reviewed.
on ite own mexits utilising the then current criterie for ADEX
to determine whether continued inclusion on the ADEX vas
warranted. If not, the individual's name was deleted. As
previously indicated, during 1972 the ADEX was evaluated and
revised and as a reault, the number of individuals who were
ineladed on the APEX began to decline and thus the high number
of cancelled cards. In accordance with Sureau policy, which
was instituted during the SI progran, these cancelled cards
are maintained at PRIRQ for a period of thres years and
there is no way to xeconstruct a former ST or ADEX list for «
partioular time period by reviewing these cancelled cards,
these cards, however, will reflect the identity of those
individuals who have been placed on the SI and the AUEX for
the period for which these cards were maintaine.

Showld the ESC so desire, the outdated SI and
ADEA cards mentioned above will be wade available for review
by appropriate HSC representatives at PAIEC.

The FBI is aware of only one instance wherein an

with a Congressional staff to a hostile intelligence service,
This individual initially offered to assist the FBI, and for

subsequently learned, howevex, that he had renewed his contacts ‘,
with his foreign principal, that he had fabricated much of ‘
the infoxmation previously furnished to the FBI and, in general, =
he gave every indication that he was unstable, unreliable, and

Honorable Otis G, Pike

This Bureau knows of no othex “American eitizens
and foreign nationals" who may have improperly passed
sensitive information to Soviet=bloe intelligence agents
without prior FBI knowledge, Congressional stafz members
vegularly volunteer to the FBI facts regarding their contacts
with Soviet-bloe officials and other persons who appear
suspicious and who have an undue interest in sensitive material,
Soviet-bloc officials often make efforts to recruit sources
and influential contacts on Gapitol Hill through whom they may
obtain sensitive information, When the FBI learns of such
instances it advises the appropriate Congressman and, if he
has no objection, the FBE may interview the stafZ member or,
in some instances, consider utilization of him in an operation,
controlled by the FBE, aimed at determining the reason for the
individual's interest, ‘hese operations are undextaken between
the FBI and the Congressman or staff member with an understanding
of confidentiality and sometimes involve sensitive sources and
methods, ‘To furnish such information to the House Committee, it
is felt, will not only violate the understanding of conZidentiality;
the FBI has had with the Congressman and staff members involved,
but may also jeopardize the sensitive sources and methods which
were utilized in some of these cases, and have 4 detrimental
effect on our future ability to fulfill our foreign counter-
intelligence responsibilities,

For these veasons I regret that I am unable to -
furnish to your Committee information regarding these in-
dividuals who have confidentially cooperated with the FBI,

Sincerely yours,

Information Concerning the Vietnam
Veterans Against the War

NOTE:

In addition to the above-mentioned request,
the HSC requested access to the same type of materials
as mentioned above for John Kerry, former Head of the
Vietnam Veterans Against the War, from 1971 to the
present. This request is being handled by separate
communication since it involves the reviewing of
approximately 70 references and one main file. Ellen
tiller, mentioned above, conferred with Supervisors
Thomas J. McNiff and Howard W. Dare, Jr., concerning
this matter on October 28, 1975, and an agreement was
reached whereby only reports and memoranda from those
offices mentioned above would be made available for
review.

THAT IT IS POSSIBLE FOR THE STRUCTURE OF AN ORGANIZATION SUCH AS
THE BUREAU 'TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR MUCH WRONGDOING WITHOUT ANY
MEASURABLE. CULPABILITY ON THE PART OF INDIVIDUALS WORKING IN THE ”
LOWER LEVELS OF THE ORGANIZATION, For EXAMPLE, ‘I-HAS AT ONE TIME"

‘COMPLY WITH HIS REQUEST AND THAT HE COULD TELL HIS COUNTERPART AF -
THE BUREAU WHO HAD CALLED HIM ON THE WATCHLINE. SEEKING THE
INFORMATION THAT I KNEW DAMN WELL IT WAS GOING TO BE. USED IN “AN

_ UNRECORDED " “COUNTERINTELLIGENCE OPERATION .TO DESTROY Mk. Youne’s -
CHANCES OF” GETTING ELECTED TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. Tae
REQUEST CAME ONLY A FEW DAYS AFTER MR. YOUNG HAD’ ANNOUNCED THAT:

_ MUST ASSUME THAT MY SUPERVISOR HAD NO OTHER SOURCE AT-THAT TIME. :
“THAT COULD GET THE INFORMATION FOR HIM. You,” OF COURSE, WILL FIND ae
NO RECORD OF THE ABOVE. INCIDENT IN THE. ‘BUREAU FILES: .

1 AM COGNIZANT OF YOUR MANDATE TO INVESTIGATE THE INTELLIGENCE
OPERATIONS OF THE BUREAU AND OF THE: GREAT MASS OF INFORMATION THAT
HAS ALREADY BEEN UNCOVERED REGARDING THESE OPERATIONS, -] BELIEVE, ;
HOWEVER, THAT A’CLEAR AND PRECISE PICTURE OF THE BUREAU’S INTELLI~:
GENCE PRACTICES CAN ONLY BE SEEN BY ANALYZING THE: ADMINISTRATIVE
“STRUCTURE, THE ENTRENCHED ‘BIASES AND ‘THE PERVASIVE INDOCTRINATED
FBI MENTALITY THAT COMMANDS AND CONTROLS THEIR INTELLIGENCE PRACTICES,

IN THE INCIDENT, INVOLVING REPRESENTATIVE ANDREW ‘Youns, IF THE
SAME REQUEST HAD BEEN. MADE TO MOST AGENTS wHo HAD REACHED THE ‘LEVEL HEE
IN THE BUREAU THAT I WAS AT THAT TIME, THEY WOULD HAVE ROUTINELY

* comPL. IED WITH THEIR SUPERVISOR'S REQUEST SIMPLY BECAUSE ‘THEY =~
WOULD HAVE GONE THROUGH A PROCESS WHICH WOULD HAVE ELIMINATED -
ALL THOSE WHO SAW ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE TYPE OF. ACTIVITY
_ CONTEMPLATED BY- THEIR SUPERVISOR, THE OFT TIMES EXPRESSED FEELINGS
OF ALL OF THE PERSONNEL WORKING IN ‘CONJUNCTION WITH ME -ON THE
INTELLIGENCE SQUAD IN ATLANTA DURING THE PERIOD’ THAT. THE YOUNG
INCIDENT TOOK PLACE ACCOUNTS FOR THE FACT THAT THE INFORMATION
“REQUESTED WOULD HAVE BEEN ROUTINELY OBTAINED, THE FEELING WAS”
THAT THE RACIAL MOVEMENTS IN WHICH ‘Hr, Youne was ENGAGED, ALTHOUGH
‘NOT ILLEGAL PER SE, WAS INIMICABLE TO THE VALUE STANDARDS THAT THE’
SQUAD MEMBERS SUBSCRIBED TO, IF IT TOOK.A LITTLE TLLEGAL ACTIVITY,
TO COMPROMISE THE MOVEMENT, THEN SO BE IT. PasT EXPERIENCE HAD.
MADE IT CLEAR.TO ALL AGENTS THAT MR. Hoover ‘HAD NO SYMPATHY WITH.-

ANY RACIAL MOVEMENT.

You MAY JUSTLY INQUIRE AT THIS JUNCTURE HOW I HAPPENED To
SURVIVE IN THE BUREAU IF THESE SELECTION PROCESSES WEEDED THOSE iN
OPPOSITION OUT, THE ANSWER WAS AND IS THAT T WAS BOTH STUBBORN
AND SMART ENOUGH TO KEEP -MY RECORD GOOD AND CLEAR AND THOSE AROUND

ME KNEW IT. As AN ATTORNEY AND’ SOMEONE WHO BELIEVED IN THE RULE -
OF LAW, I wouLDN!T CONFORM . 1B IT REQUIRED ME TO BE DISHONEST “OR
TO VIOLATE THE LAW AND I KNEW THE LAW, I CAN SORROWFULLY SAY THAT -” -
MY VIEWS WERE NOT SHARED BY MY PEERS IN THE BUREAU. ;

I JOINED THE FBI as AN AGENT IN 1951 AND RETIRED IN 1971.
By 1957 THE WEAKNESSES IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE BUREAU HAD BECOME. ;
ALL TOO OBVIOUS TO ME: ‘IN 1960 AS A RESULT OF ADMINISTRATIVE .

TTT.. MANipuLaTioN aND CONTROL OF THE PRESSy

THE EXAMPLES OF THIS SUBJECT’ ARE LEGION, THe ONE THAT T
AM MOST FAMILIAR WITH WAS THE CONCERTED EFFORT .TO GET WHAT.
WAS: ALWAYS REFERRED TO IN THE BuREAU AS "OUR ERIED IDS" IN THE .
MEDIA” TO PUBLISH PERSONAL AND VERY PRIVATE INFORMATION TAKEN
FROM THE WIRETAP WHICH ITSELF WAS OF QUESTIONABLE LEGAL.” ,
VALIDITY ON Dr. Martin LuTHER Kins, OF COURSE, THE DAY ‘TO i
DAY eee WAS, ACCOMPLISHED BY LEAKING CHOICE ITEMS TO
OUR “FRIENDS”, It WAS NOT AT ALL UNCOMMON TO LEARN OF SOME
POLITICALLY DAMAGING INFORMATION ABOUT SOME. LEADING FIGURE :
IN POLITICS AS HAVING BEEN DEVELOPED BY THE BUREAU AND THEN _
ALWAYS AT A TIME WHEN IT WOULD BE MOST DAMAGING To THE
INDIVIDUAL, THE INFORMATION WOULD SOME WAY SHOW UP IN THE
Ctitcago Tpipune OR SOME OTHER FRIEND OF THE Bureau. IF THE |

INFORMATION WAS MORE VALUABLE FOR PURPOSES OF POLITICAL
BLACKMAIL BY HOLDING IT, THAN BY GIVING IT To THE PRESS, IT
WAS WITHHELD, THE LEAKED INFORMATION ALWAYS SEEMED TO INVOLVE
PERSONS OF LIBERAL PERSUASION, (FROM MY YEARS IN THE BUREAU,

T CAN ONLY ASSUME THAT THE BUREAU HAD DEDUCED THAT PERSONS :
OF LIBERAL PERSUASION ARE SOMEHOW MORE APT TO SLEEP WITH--
SOMEBODY ELSE'S WIFE,- DRINK TOO MUCH LIQUOR, OR BE SEX ALLY
PERVERTED THAN ARE SOLID CONSERVATIVES.) : ee Pale besreel

IV, ABSOLUTE AUTHORITY AT THE TOP“AND BLIND LOYALTY AT THE ©


BOTTOM AIDED BY THE SELECTION PROCESS, HEP EEEEEEEy

Tits QUESTION OF LOYALTY IS INTERESTING: SINCE, OF COURSE, ‘age

WE ALL LIKE OUR FRIENDS TO BE LOYAL TO US AND WE RESPECT: ~~ . «|
IT AS A QUALITY. IN MAN, THE, WATERGATE HEARINGS WERE tt oe
PARTICULARLY INFORMATIVE ON THIS POINT AS YOU WILL RECALL. ial:

EACH OF THE WITNESSES WHO WERE IMPLICATED IN WRONGDOING IN ~ i

WATERGATE OPENED THEIR STATEMENTS WITH A BIT ON LOYALTY AND. ;

WENT ON TO TELL EVENTUALLY HOW IN THE NAME OF LOYALTY: THEY - ae
HAD VIOLATED THE Lav, THE BUREAU HAS ITS. PARALLEL IN THIS =e ara

CONCEPT OF BLIND LOYALTY. PERSONNEL HAVE BEEN ‘WILLING TO - aig

FOREGO THEIR OWN INTEGRITY TO ALLOW IMPROPER, UNETHICAL, OR) 7
ILLEGAL ACTIVITY BY THE BUREAU TO GO ON UNCHALLENGED RATHER fete
THAN INJURE THE BUREAU BY A PUBLIC ATTACK WHICH MANY REGARD Baie 7 it
AS DISLOYAL To THE BUREAU. :

V, HaRsH DISCIPLINARY Measures,

THE HARSH DISCIPLINARY MEASURES WHICH WERE THE HALLMARK
OF HR. Hoaver’s PERSONNEL POLICY ARE TOO EXTENSIVE TO GO

INTO AT LENGTH HERE, THEY SOMETIMES RESULTED IN HUMOROUS _ acCeout
SITUATIONS BUT VERY OFTEN IN VERY TRAGIC SITUATIONS, “BY |
THE’ MID-1960's THESE HARSH DISCIPLINARY MEASURES HAD SO. or
ERODED CONFIDENCE IN HOOVER AMONG THE AGENT PERSONNEL, THAT. (=
THE POLICY OF “TELL THE MAN NOTHING” HAD REACHED A POINT os
WHERE INFORMATION COULD ACTUALLY: GET. INTO THE HANDS OF BUREAU’

HARSHNESS OF THE DISCIPLINARY ACTION MADE THE INTEGRITY OF

ALL AGENTS VERY PLIABLE,

SUPERVISORS AND IT STILL WOULD NOT GET TO Hoover BECAUSE THE . sees


Cn}
IN A DEMOCRACY, DOMINATION OF A POWERFUL ORGANIZATION SUCH .,
AS THE FEDERAL Bureau oF INVESTIGATION BY ANY SEGMENT OF THE |

a

POLITICAL SPECTRUM THREATENS THE a EXISTENCE.-OF" DEMOCRACY, aa

THE, PROCESS | RESULTS: IN THE ORGANIZATION BEING USED TO AID THE
POLITICAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL FRIENDS OR CAUSES. OF. ‘THE LEADER AND ie

NEUTRALIZE ANY OPPOSITION,

Mr, Hoover’s VENDETTA AGAINST Dr. MARTIN LuTHER King ILLUSTRATES .”
THIS PROCESS IN A GRAPHIC MANNER. ;

1 SUBMIT THAT THE FBI Now ‘CONSTITUTES A DEGENERATE DICTATOR-
SHIP IN WHICH THE STRUCTURE STILL REMAINS BUT FROM WHICH PUBLIC act
SUPPORT IS RAPIDLY BEING WITHDRAWN, I FURTHER SUBMIT THAT SUCH A
: DICTATORSHIP 1S INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE CONSTITUTIONAL ‘CONCEPTS “UPON Cs
WHICH THIS NATIONAL WAS FOUNDED. I FEEL THAT THIS CAN BE HISTORICALLY ;
PARALLELED WITH THE ASCENSION OF OTHER: DICTATORSHIPS THROUGHOUT THE
WORLD, : Si

I RECOMMEND THAT ANY REFORM WHICH YOU CONSIDER DEAL! DIRECTLY
WITH EACH OF THE POINTS I MENTIONED IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE :
process’ BUT I URGE you 0 GIVE PARTICULARLY ‘CAREFUL ATTENTION TO
THE PROCESS OF AGENT SELECTION:-

IN ORDER TO INSURE AGAINST RE~ ESTABLISHMENT OF UNCONTROLLABLE
- POWER WITHIN THE BurEAU 1 WOULD SUGGEST THE FOLLOWING:

“L, SEEK THE REMOVAL OF ALL ENTRENCHED PERSONNEL -INCLUDING
THE DIRECTOR-AS QUICKLY AS IS PRACTICAL, (NOT InAs 3 °C
VINDICTIVE MANNER, BUT FOR THE GOOD OF THE SERVICE,)’

2, ESTABLISH A. SYSTEN BY WHICH LINE LEVEL’ PERSONNEL CAN -
REPORT UNETHICAL OR ILLEGAL ACTIVITY WITHIN -THE BuREAU . Ee
To AN OUTSIDE CONTROL AGENCY, ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SOME” - | ,
_ CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTIONS INVOLVED, 1 WouLD RECOMMEND ;
THAT THE CONTROL AGENCY BE UNDER. THE JUDICIARY, THUS
EXTENDING THE ‘CONCEPT OF CHECKS AND BALANCES, AND THAT |
THE TIME NECESSARY FOR SETTING UP HEARINGS AND RESOLVING
DIFFICULTIES BE EXTREMELY- Hort, ‘MAYBE AS LITTLE AS
SEVEN DAYS $0. THAT CORRUPTIVE PROCESSES COULD ‘NOT GET
STARTED: : .

3, THAT ALL PERSONNEL WORKING WITHIN THE AGENCY AND: ALL NEW ;

_ PERSONNEL WORKING WITHIN THE’ AGENCY BE REQUIRED TO ATTEND
INSTRUCTIONAL CLASSES GIVEN BY VARIOUS. EDUCATIONAL:
INSTITUTIONS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. IN WHICH <THE RIGHTS AND
DUTIES OF BUREAU EMPLOYEES WOULD BE THOROUGHLY TAUGHT sO.
THAT WE WOULD NOT HAVE PEOPLE LIKE Jim McCorp IN THE
WATERGATE SITUATION TELLING THE SENATE IN YEARS TO COME
THAT HE THOUGHT THAT WHAT WAS OBVIOUSLY ILLEGAL COULD BE
MADE LEGAL. BY THE FLICK OF A PEN BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL: - -

4, LEGISLATE THE PROCESS OF AGENT SELECTION IN SUCH A WAY
THAT FUTURE PERSONNEL WOULD REPRESENT THE FULL SPECTRUM
OF AMERICAN SOCIETY INSTEAD OF ONLY A NARROW ‘SEGNENT: As
IT Now DOES, EITHER REDUCE THE PAY OF AGENT PERSONNEL -
OR ESTABLISH EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ADMISSION THAT.
WOULD JUSTIFY THE CURRENT HIGH-PAY STANDARDS. I WOULD |
PREFER THAT THE STANDARDS BE MADE HIGHER AND LEAVE THE”

5, LEGISLATE CONTROLS REGARDING THE RELEASE OF INFORMATION au
‘FROM THE BUREAU WHICH WILL PREVENT THE BuREAU- FROM USING
THE WEALTH OF INFORMATION IT COLLECTS AT GOVERNMENT Fee
EXPENSE AS A MEANS OF PRESS MANIPULATION. Cr Quinn MARTIN
PropucT ions CAN EXAMINE BUREAU- RECORDS AND PRODUCE A aut .
TELEVISION PLAY AS THEY DID IN THE PHTLADELPHIA- “Misstssippt ;
CASE AND, AS I BELIEVE, DISTORT THE TRUE PICTURE IN AN
EFFORT TO PROTECT THE BUREAU’ IMAGE, THEN 1 FEEL THESE
RECORDS SHOULD BE THROWN OPEN TO ALL OF THE MEDIA TO-DO’
WITH AS THEY CHOOSE IN THE INTEREST OF PROTECTING THE
First AMENDMENT.) YoU HAVE HERE A CASE OF INVERSE ABRIDGE- °_
MENT OF THE First AMENDMENT RIGHTS. _PROHIBIT THE PRACTICE:

- OF ALLOWING THE DIRECTOR TO USE BUREAU FACILITIES TO ¢

- PONTIFICATE THROUGH THE GUISE OF NEWS RELEASES TN WHICH |”
HE NEVER SUBMITS TO CROSS EXAMINATION BY THE. PRESS, IT
SEEMS THAT MR, KELLEY HAS MODERATED THIS EVIL, TO SOME
EXTENT. BUT IF YOU DON’T PROHIBIT THE PRACTICE THROUGH
LEGISLATION, HE-OR A FUTURE DIRECTOR, ONCE THEY FEEL MORE,
SECURE WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY FALL BACK ON THIS ODIOUS PRACTICE.
