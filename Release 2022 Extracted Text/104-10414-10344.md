As a result of the Warren Commission proceedings. Liaison

(and the rest of the worid know that JKLANCE has photographic

coveraga of

tha Chan Mission.

However, to the best of our

nowledge, no one knows where it is or who does it

This is

confirmed by (KDAFGHAN photos showing Cubans, and others, shaking

their fists at a house which is not the KDAFGHAN site.

In our

request to Liaison to remove the offending traffic sign, Head-

quarters may be assured that we did not tell (Liaison the

true

l'eason

for our request.

They were told that it sometines

interfered with physicai surveillance. (Liaison) in turn gave

the same request to the appropriate contact

in the traffic

police, using the explanation that their surveillance team

wanted the sign removed.
