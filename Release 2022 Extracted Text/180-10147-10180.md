• I. Organization of CIA Investigation

of President Kennedy's Assassination

In his Executive Session testimony before the Select

Committee, Richard Helms, the CIA's Deputy Director for

Plans during 1963, described the CIA's role in the

investigation of President Kennedy's assassination as

follows:

This crime was committed on United

States soil. Therefore, as far as the

Federal government was concerned, the pri-

mary investigating agency would have been

the Federal Bureau of Investigation without

any question. The role of the CIA would

have been entirely supportive in the sense

of what material we are (sic) able to

acquire outside the limits of the United

States with reference to the investigation.

...

had no investigative role inside the United

States at all. So when I used here the

word "supportive," I meant that in the

literal sense of the term. We are (sic)

trying to support the FBI and support the

Warren Commission and be responsive to

their requests, but we were not initiating

any investigations of our own or, to my

recollection, were we ever asked to.

(Executive Session

Testimony of Richard

Helms, 8/9/78, PP. 17-18.)

On November 23, 1963 Helms called a meeting of senior-

level CIA officials to outline the Agency's investiga-

tive responsibility vis a vis the assassination. (SSC,

Mexico

Book V, p. 25.) At that time, Helms placed John Scelso, Headgüunet:

Branch Chief for erA operations t

investigative efforts. (HSCA Class. Deposition of John

Scelso testified before the Select Committee,

that he was given charge of the Agency's investigation

on the basis of two considerations: l)!his prior

experience in conducting major CIA security investi-

gations and 2) the observance of Oswald by CIA

surveillance in Mexico, (Scelso's operational concern)

less than two months prior to the assassination. (SSC

The record reveals that during this second phase

of CIA information collection efforts in support of

the Warren Commission investigation the concentration

of Agency resources shifted in emphasis from exploration

of Oswald's activities in Mexico City to his residency

in the Soviet Union during 1959-1962 and possible

association with the Soviet intelligence apparatus. *UseP fafF)

that during this phase primary interest in support of the

Warren Commission was to follow-up on Soviet leads:

on the assumption that a person who spends

four years**in the Soviet Union, under his

circumstances, had to be of specific interest

to Soviet State security and their collateral

authorities. (HSCA Classified Deposition of

A. Opinions of Warren Commission and CIA Representatives

Regarding Warren Commission-CIA Relationship

The Committee has contacted both representatives of

the Warren Commission staff and those representatives of

the CIA who played significant roles in providing CIA-

generated information to the Warren Commission. The

general consensus of these representatives is that the

Warren Commission and the CIA enjoyed a successful

working relationship during the course of the Commission's

investigation. (HSCA Class. Depo. Of R. Rocca 7/17/78,

p. 18) (See also Exec. Sess. Test. of Richard Helms,

8/9/78, Fpl,24.) William Coleman, a senior staîf counsel

for the Warren Commission who worked closely with Warren

Commission

staff counsel W. David Slawson on matters

which utilized the CIA's resources, characterized

the CIA representatives with whom he dealt as

highly competent, cooperative, and intelligent.

(See HSCA staff interview of William Coleman,

"the CIA was to turn over and to develop any information

bearing on the assassination that could be of assistance

to the Warren Conmission." (Ibid., p. 26.)

A different view of the CIA's role regarding the

supply of CIA's information to the Warren Cormission was

propounded by Richard Helms. MI. Helms, who served as

the CIA's Deputy Director for Plans during the Warren

Commission investigation, was directly responsible for the

CIA's investigation of President Kennedy's assassination and the

establishmen of ClA policy visa ris te Warren Commission.

He testified to the Committee that the

CIA made every effort to be as responsive as possible to

Warren Commission requests. (Exec. Sess. Text. of Richard

Helms, 8/9/78, p. 10.) MI. Helms added further testimony

regarding the manner in which the CIA provided its infor-

Mr. Goldsmith:

In summary, "is it your position that

Mr. Helms:

That is correct.

I want to modify that by saying that

memory is fallable.

There may have been

my recollection is that we were attempting

(Ibid., p. 34.)

Mr. Helms' characterization of fulfilling Warren

Commission requests on a casolbasis rather than uniformly

volunteering relevant information to the Warren Commission

stands in direct opposition to J. Lee Rankin's perception

of the CIA's investigative responsibility. Mi. Rankin was

asked by Committee Counsel whether he worked under the

impression that the Agency's responsibility was simply to

respond to questions that were addressed to CIA by the

Warren Commission. In response, Mr. Rankin testified as

Moreover, there is no indication that Slawson had

*Regarding the issue of whether Calderon's comments

could reasonably be interpreted to indicate possible

foreknowledge, the CIA position is as follows:

During the Rockefeller Commission inquiry,

Calderon's conversation was identified

double

of a plot to assassinate the American Presi-

dent. This involves a faulty translation of an

answer Calderon gave to her caller.

In answer

to the latter's question as to whether she

had heard the latest news, Calderon said:

"Si, claro, me entere casiantes que Kennedy."

The verb entere is mistranslated. Me entere

(the first person of the verb enterarsede,

past tense)

should be translated as "

...I

found

out (or I learned) /about it -- the assassination/

almost before Kennedy /did/."

In other words,

Calderon was saying she heard about the shooting

of Kennedy almost at the time the event took

place..."

(CIA DoC., Memorandum Regarding

Luisa Calderon conversation, p.1).

The Committee fundamentally disputes the

narrow interpretation of Calderon's comments

assigned by the Agency. It is the Committee's

position that translation of Me Entere as

either "I found out" or "I learned about"

does not foreclose interpretation of Calderon's

comments as a suggestion on her part of possible

foreknowledge of President. Kennedy's assassination.

On May 8 Langosch further disclosed AMMUG's

i knowledge of the Oswald case. lIbid, attach. o

Langosch paraphrased ANMUG's knowledge of Calderon

as follows:

I thought that Luisa Calderon might have

had contact with Oswald because I learned

about 17 March 1964, shortly before I made

a trip to Mexico, that she had been

involved with an

American in Mexico.

The

information to which I refer was told to

me by a DGI case officer... I had commented

to (him) that it seemed strange that juisa

Calderon was receiving a salary from the

DGI although she apparently did not do

any work for the Service.

(The case officer)

told me that hers was a peculiar case and

that he himself believed that she had been

recruited in Mexico by the Central Intelligence

Agency although Manuel Pineiro, the Head

of the DGI, did not agree.

As I recall,

(the case officer) had investigated Luisa

Calderon.

This was because, during the time

she was in Mexico, the DGI had intercepted

a letter to her by an American who signed

his name ONER (phonetic) or something

similar.

As you know, the pronunciation

of Anglo-Saxon names is difficult in

Spanish so I am not sure of how the name

mentioned by Hernandez should be spelled.

It could have been "Howard" or something

different.

As I understand the matter,

the letter from the American was a love

letter but indicated that there was

clandestine professional relationship

between the writer and Luisa Calderon.

I also understand from (the case officer)

that after the interception of the letter

she had been followed and seen in the

company of an American.

I do not know if

this could have been Oswald... (Ibid.)

If so, please indicate when and

in what form this information was provided,

The CIA responded by memorandum:

"Although the (Mexico City) Station considered

the conversation of sufficient possible

interest to send a copy to headquarters,

the latter apparently did nothing with

it, for there appears to be no record in the

Oswald file of such action as may have

documents containing information

still bearing a

not reveal whether the conversation was

The available evidence thus supports the

conclusion that the Warren Commission was never

given the information nor the opportunity by

which it could evaluate Luisa Calderon's

matter, it was dictated directly to a CI

(Counterintelligence) stenographer on

5 May 1964.

/Note:

A-1 was debriefed on

several subjects on 4 May 64. The procedure

was to assign each subject discussed a

debriefing number and they were written

up in contact report form by the WH case

officer.

The instructions from CI staff

were to handle the Oswald case debriefing

very crosely and not to keep any copies in

WH Division/. The "Oswald Case" was

logged in the WH

notebook log as debriefing

report number 40, but the report itself

was dictated by the Wi Case Officer directly

to a CI staff stenographer. There would

be no reason

to include the number 40 on

the report of this special debriefing for

CI staff, since it was their only debriefing

report.

We are certain it is the debriefing

report (#40) because the date is the same:

it is the only debriefing report on Oswald

listed in AMMUG-1 records; and it it (sic)

the only AMMUG-1 debriefing report in

Oswald's 201 file.

operation (CIA Inspector General Report 1967

a high level Cuban official (assigned the CIA

cryptonym AMLASH/1) who, during 1962 while meeting

with a CIA representative expressed the desire to

assassinate Fidel Castro (Ibid., p. 84). As a

result of AMLASH's expressed objective and the

CIA's desire to find a viable political alternative

to the Castro regime, the Agency subsequently

(Ibia. pp. 104-106) During 1965, AMLASH and his

conspirators were brought to trial in Cuba for plotting

against Castro. AMLASH was sentenced to death, but

at Castro's request the sentence was reduced to

twenty-five years imprisonment. (Ibid. pp. 107-110).

to retaliate for such plotting. No one

assassination, the CIA did not conduct

a thorough investigation of questions

Langosch, as the Chief of Counterintelligence

for the Special Affairs Staff, was responsible for

safeguarding SAS against penetration by foreign

intelligence services, particularly the Cuban

Intelligence Services (HSCA Classified Affidavit

of Joseph Langosch, 9/14/78, p. 3). It was

Langosch's recollection that:

... the AMLASH operation prior to the

assassination of President Kennedy was

characterized by the Special Affairs

staff, Desmond Fitzgerald (sic) and other

senior CIA officers as an assassination

operation initiated and sponsored by the

CIA.

(Ibid., p. 4)

Langosch further recollected that as of 1962

it was highly possible that the Cuban Intelligençer

Services were aware of AMLASH and his association

with the CIA and that the information upon which

he based his conclusion that the AMLASH

operation was insecure was available to senior severA

*In response to Langosch's sworn statements, this

Committee has received from the CIA an affidavit

executed by Kent I. Pollock (CIA pseudonym) who "served

as Executive Officer for Desmond FitzGerald during the

entire period in which he was Chief of the Special Affairs

Staff...and discussed with him the AMLASH operation as it

progressed." (CIA Doc., Affidavit of Kent L. Pollock,

executed Oct. 5, 1978, p. 1) Mr. POlloCk SpecifICally

contested Langosch's assertion that the AMLASH operation

was characterized by the Special Affairs Staff, Desmond

FitzGerald, and other senior level CIA officials as an

assassination operation.

In pertinent part, Pollock

drew the following conclusions:

To the best of my knowledge,

Mr. FitzGerald

considered the AMLASH operation

to be a political

action activity with the objective of organizing

a group within Cuba to overthrow Castro and the

Castro regime by means of a coup d'etat. I heard

Mr. FitzGerald discuss the AMLASH operation

frequently, and never heard him characterize it as

an "assassiantion operation."

Mr. FitzGerald

stated within my hearing on several occasions

his awareness that coup d'etat often involves

loss of life.

(Ibid., par. 3, p. 2)

He also stated:

Desmond FitzGerald did not characterize the AMLASH

operation as an "assassigntion operation"; the

case officer did not; I, as Executive Officer, never

discussed any aspect of

the AMLASH operation with

Joseph H. Langosch; the Deputy Chief, the other &

branch chiefs and the

special assistants could not

have so characterized it since they did not know

about the pen (the pen was specially fitted with a

hypodermic syringe in response to urgings by AMLASH

for a means to start the coup by killing Castro.)

The case officer offered the pen to AMLASH on the day

of President Kennedy's death.

AMLASH rejected the

pen with disdain. LIbid., par. 1, o. 31), (Ibia.,

not simply Whether thee sea

assassination plot prior to President Kennedy's

death. The broader and more significant issue,

TTR

as the 1977 IGR has identified it, is whether

the AMLASH operation was of sufficient relevancy

to have been reported to the Warren Commission.

In the case of the AMLASH operation this

determination is a most difficult matter to

resolve. Reasonable men may differ in their

characterization of the Agency's operational

objectives.

Based upon the presently available evidence

it is the Committee's position that such informa-

tion, if made available to the Warren Commission,

might have stimulated the Commission's investiga-

tive corcern for possible Cuban involvement or

complicity in the assassination. As J. Lee Rankin

commented before this Committee:

...when I read...the Church Committee's

report--it was an ideal situation for

them to just pick out any way they

wanted to tell the story

and fit it

in with the facts that had to be met

and

then either blame the rest of it

on somebody else or not tell any more

or polish it off. I don't think that

could have happened back in 1964.

I think there would have been a

much better chance of getting to

the heart of it.

It might have

only revealed that we are involved

in it and who approved it and all

that. But I think that would

have at least come out.

(HSCA Class.

Depo. of J. Lee Rankin, 8/17/78, p.91)

The Committee is in agreement with Mr. Rankin

that had the AMLASH operation been disclosed to

the Warren Commission, the Commission might have

been able to foreclose the speculation and conjecture

that has surrounded the AMLASH operation during

the past decade. As history now records, the AMLASH

operation remains a footnote to the turbulent

relations between Castro's Cuba and the United States.
