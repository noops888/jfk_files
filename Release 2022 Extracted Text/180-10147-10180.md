9 In his Executive Session testimony before the Select

investigation of President Kennedy's assassination as
g follows:
This crime was committed on United

Federal government was concerned, the pri-

mary investigating agency would have been

*The following exchange between Mr. Rocca and Committee
Counsel sheds further light on the difficulties encountered
by the Agency related to its investigation of possible
Cuban involvement in the assassination:

Mr. Goldsmith. Earlier, when I asked you which
areas of the case received emphasis, I believe that you
indicated that on balance the primary area of emphasis
was the Soviet connection.

Mr. Rocca. That was certainly the one that I would
say dominated =- looking at it from my point of view.

Mr. Goldsmith. Now, had you known about the anti-
Castro assassination plots on the part of the CIA, would
you have given more priority, more emphasis, to the
possibility of a Castro conspiracy to kill the President?

Mr. Rocca. Again, I say that it would have
simply intensified it, that there was attention given
to it, not particularly by the staff. I had no capabilities
on the Cuban side.

The organization of their service and their
operation in Mexico was something entirely entirely (sic) _..

The Harker interview should have been undoubtedly
given greater attention in a generalized sense; but it

Mr. Goldsmith. Well, when I said to what extent
was the Cuban connection investigated, I don't mean by
the Warren Commission. I mean to what extent did the
Agency provide --

Mr. Rocca. That I can't answer. I certainly
didn't, do it.

Mr. Goldsmith. Pardon me?
Mr. Rocca. We certainly didn't, in R & A.
Mr. Goldsmith. So, CI/R & A did not --

Mr. Rocca. Go into the Cuban side of it at all.
This was something left to the people who were concerned
specifically with Cuban intelligence and security operation.

Mr. Goldsmith. But I believe earlier we
established that Mr. Helms gave orders that information
pertinent to the assassination was to go through your
office, correct?

Mr. Rocca. Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. And once information pertinent
to the assassination went through your office, I take (it)
you or Mr. Helms would decide what information would
be relevant for the Warren Commission to see.

Is that correct?

Mr. Rocca. Well --

Mr. Goldsmith. Based upon what you knew?

Mr. Rocca. Well, everything would go, yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. Therefore, you were in the
position, it would seem, to know what information was
being generated in the field that was going to the

Warren Commission.

Earlier I asked you which area received emphasis
and I believe you indicated that the Soviet area (did).

in late December 1963 - early January 1964 for the

A, Opinions of Warren Commission and CIA Representatives

Regarding Warren Commission-CIA Relationship

The Committee has contacted both representatives of
the Warren Commission staff and those representatives of
the CIA who played significant roles in providing CIA-
generated information to the Warren Commission. The
general cansensus of these representatives is that the
Warren Commission and the CIA enjoyed a successful

working relationship during the course of the Commission's

investigation. (HSCA Class. Depo. of R. Rocca 7/17/78,
p. 18) (See also Exec. Sess. Test. of Richard Helms,

CIA made every effort to be as responsive as possible to

Warren Commission requests. (Exec. Sess. Text. of Richard

regarding the manner in which the CIA provided its infor-

mation to the Warren Commission. He stated:

An inquiry would come over (from the Warren Com-

But these inquiries came in individual bits an®

between Committee Counsel and Mr. Helms illustrates

?of the Agency's compromise:

Mr. Helms, I take it from your
testimony that your position is
that the anti-Castro plots, in
fact, were relevant to the
Warren Commission's work; and,
in light of that, the Committee
would like ta be informed as to
why the Warren Commission was
not told by you of the anti-
Castro assassination plots.

I have never been asked to testify
before the Warren Commission about

- Our operations.

If the Warren Commission did not
know of the operation, it certainly
was not in a position to ask you

about it.

Is that not true?

Yes, but how do you. know they did

not know about it? How do you

know Mr. Dulles had not told them? :
How was ‘I to know that? And besies?

*Regarding the issue of whether Calderon's comments
could reasonably be interpreted to indicate possible
foreknowledge, the CIA position is as follows:

OR

During the Rockefeller Commission inquiry,
Calderon's conversation was identified

as ? possible item of information from

thel Agency's] Cuban and Soviet [telephone il
[intercepts]that might suggest foreknowledge

of a plot to assassinate the American Presi-
dent. This involves a faulty translation of an
answer Calderon gave to her caller. In answer
to the latter's question as to whether she

had heard the latest news, Calderon said:

"Si, claro, me entere casiantes que Kennedy."
The verb entere is mistranslated. Me entere
(the first person of the verb enterarsede,
past tense) should be translated as ".?.1 found

g out (or I learned) /about it -- the assassination/

on

almost before Kennedy /did7." In other words,
Calderon was saying she heard about the shooting
of Kennedy almost at the time the event took
Place..." (CIA Doc., Memorandum Regarding

Luisa Calderon conversation, p.1).

Wee.

ty

The Committee fundamentally disputes the
narrow interpretation of Calderon's comments

Le assigned by the Agency. It is the Committee's
jor position that translation of Me Entere as

4 either "I found out" or "I learned about"  , + .
does not foreclose interpretation of Calderon's
comments as a suggestion on her part of possible
foreknowledge of President. Kennedy's assassination.

Langosch paraphrased ANMUG's knowledge of Calderon
as follows:

I thought that Luisa Calderon might have
had contact with Oswald because I learned
about 17 March 1964, shortly before I made
a trip to Mexico, that she had been
involved with an American in Mexico. The
é information to which I refer was told to
: : me by a DGI case officer... I. had commented
to (him) that it seemed strange that Luisa
Calderon was receiving a salary from the
DGI although she apparently did not do
any work for the Service. (The case officer)
told me that hers was’ a peculiar case and
that he himself believed that she had been
xecruited in Mexico by the Central Intelligence
Agency although Manuel Pineiro, the Head
of the DGI, did not agree. As I recall,
(the case officer) had investigated Luisa
Calderon. This was because, during the time
she was in Mexico, the DGI had intercepted
a letter to her by an American who signed
his name OWER (phonetic) or something
% similar. As you know, the: pronunciation
of Anglo-Saxon names is difficult in
Spanish_so I am not.sure of how the name
"mentioned ‘by (HeFnandez! should be spelled.
It could have\been~"Howard" or something %
different. As I understand the matter,
the letter from the American was a love
letter but indicated that there was a
clandestine professional relationship
between the writer and Luisa Calderon.
I also understand from (the case officer)
that after the interception of the letter
she had been followed and seen in the
company of an American. I do not know if
this could have been Cswald...(Ibid.)

in what form this information was provided,
and which CIA official provided it. (HSCA
request letter of August 28, 1978)

The CIA responded by memorandum: |

“Although the (Mexico ty)-Station considered
the conversation 6f Sufficient possible
interest to send a copy to headquarters,
the latter apparently did nothing with
it, for there appears to be no record in the
Oswald file of such action as may have

(CIA Doc., Memorandum Regarding Luisa

Calderon conversation, p. 1)

The available evidence thus supports the
conclusion that the Warren Commission was never
given the information nor the opportunity by
which it could evaluate Luisa Calderon's
significance to the events surrounding President
Kennedy's assassination. Had the Commission been
expeditiously provided this evidence of her

A September 1, 1963 CIA dispatch from the Chief
of the Special Affairs Staff to the CIA's Chief
of Station in Mexico City states in part:

++-Luisa Calderon has a sister residing
in Reynosa, Texas, married to an American
of Mexican descent. If (CIA asset) can
further identify the sister, our domestic
exploitation section might be in a posi-
tion to follow up on this lead...Please
levy the requirement on (CIA asset) at
the next opportunity. (CIA Doc. HMMW-
11935, 9/1/63)

An earlier CIA dispatch from the CIA Chief
of Station in Mexico City to the Chief of the CIA's
Western Hemisphere Division records that:

{wirsredo of Jthe Cuban Consulate, (Tampico, ]
reported that Luisa Calderon has a sister
residing in Reynosa, Texas...Luisa may go
up to the border to visit her sister soon--

. Ox her mother may make the trip--details

not clear (CIA Doc. HMMA 21849, July 31,
1965)
2

At the very least, .the above dispatches MB oo
evidenced an interest in the activities of Calderon
and her family. Whether this interest took

the form of a clandestine-agent relationship is

not revealed by Calderon's 201 file.

The Committee has queried David Ronis, the
author of the above cited dispatch requesting
that Calderon's sister be contacted by the CIA's
“domestic exploitation section." (HSCA Class. MU
Staft Interview of David Ronis, 8/31/78) Ronis :
was a member of the CIA's Special Affairs Staff
at the time he wrote the dispatch. He worked

principally at CIA headquarters and was responsible

for recruitment and handling of agents for collection
of intelligence data. “Mr. Ronis, when interviewed

by this Committee, stated that part of his responsi-
bility was to scour the Western Hemisphere division
for operational leads related to the work of the
Special Affairs staff. Ronis recalled that he
normally would send requests to CIA field stations
for information or leads on various persons. Often
he would receive no response to these requests,

which normally indicated that no follow-up nad Be
either been attempted or successfully conducted.

The Committee's initial review of the
materials provided by the CIA to the Warren
Commission did not disclose the existence of the
AMMUG files. However; the Committee did during
the sous of its review examine a file containing
material passed to the Rockefeller Commission. That
file made reference to A-l. Included in this
file was a memorandum of May 5, 1964 written by
Joseph Langosch which concerned information A-1
provided about the Oswald case. (CIA Doc. FOIA 68-290
Langosch Memorandum, 5/5/64) Also contained within

had come in contact with DGI officers in Mexico City.

case, CI Staff submitted a list of questions
to WH (Western Hemisphere) for debriefing
AMMUG-1...WH desk records reflect that

this questionnaire.../B/ecause the debriefing
on the Oswald case was handled as a sensitive

several subjects on 4 May 64. ‘The procedure
was to assign each subject discussed a
debriefing number and they were written
up in contact report form by the WH case
efficer. The instructions from CI staff
were to handle the Oswald case debriefing
very closely and not to keep any copies in
WH Division/. The "Oswald Case" was
logged in the WH notebook log as debriefing
report number 40, but the report itself
was dictated by the WH Case Officer directly

The most striking example of the CIA's direct
offer of support to AMLASH reported by the

1967 IGR states “it is likely that at the very
moment President Kennedy was shot a CIA officer

was meeting with a Cuban agent in Paris and giving

him an assassination device for use against CASTRO."

Operation was in progress at the time
of the assassination; unlike the earlier
plots, the AMLASH operation coulda
clearly be traced to the CIA; and

unlike the earlier plots, the CIA had
endorsed AMLASH's proposal for a coup,
the first step to him being Castro's
assassination, despite Castro's threat
to retaliate for such plotting. No one
directly involved in either investigation
(i.e. the CIA and the FBI) was told of
the AMLASH operation. No one investi-

gated a connection between the AMLASH

operation and President Kennedy's

in contact with pro-Castro and anti-
Castro groups for many months before the
assassination, the CIA did not conduct
a thorough investigation of questions
of Cuban government or Cuban exile

involvement in the assassination. (Ibid. p.

*In response to Langosch's sworn statements, this

Committee has received from the CIA an affidavit

executed by Kent L. Pollock (CIA pseudonym) who “served

as Executive Officer for Desmond FitzGerald during the
entire period in which he was Chief of the Special Affairs
Staff...and discussed with him the AMLASH operation as it

4 progressed." (CIA Doc., Affidavit of Kent L. Pollock,

Weak NRA

executed Oct. 5, 1978, p. 1) Mr. Pollock specifically
contested Langosch's assertion that the AMLASH operation
was characterized by the Special Affairs Staff, Desmond
FitzGerald, and other senior level CIA officials as an
assassination operation. In pertinent part, Pollock
drew the following conclusions:

Whe,

To the best of my knowledge, Mr. FitzGerald
considered the AMLASH operation to be a political
action activity with the objective of organizing
a group within Cuba to overthrow Castro and the
Castro regime by means of a coup d'etat. I heard
Mr. FitzGerald discuss the AMLASH operation
frequently, and never heard him characterize it as
an “assassial ion operation." Mr. FitzGerald
stated within my hearing on several occasions

his awareness that coup d'etat often involves
loss of life. (Ibid., par. 3, p. 2)

Re TW Ga

uN

He also stated:

Desmond FitzGerald did not characterize the AMLASH
operation as an “assassigntion operation"; the

case officer did not; I,~as Executive Officer, never
discussed any aspect of the AMLASH operation with
Joseph H. Langosch; the Deputy Chief, the other ¢
branch chiefs and the special assistants could not
have so characterized it since they did not know
about the pen (the pen was specially fitted with a
hypodermic syringe in response to urgings by AMLASH
for a means to start the coup by killing Castro.)
The case officer offered the pen to AMLASH on the day

g of President Kennedy's death. AMLASH rejected the

:

pen with disdain. /Ibid., par. 4, p. 27), (Ibid.,
par. 6, p. 3)

assassination plot prior to President Kennedy's

death. The broader and more significant issue,
TTE
as the 1977 IGR has identified it, is whether

SS oe

the AMLASH operation was of sufficient relevancy

to have been reported to the Warren Comission.

In the case of the AMLASH operation this
determination is a most difficult matter to
resolve. Reasonable men may differ in their
characterization of the Agency's operational
objectives.

Based upon the presently available evidence
it is the Committee's position that such informa-

tion, if made available to the Warren Commission,

SS a a

might have stimulated the Commission's investiga-

tive concern for possible Cuban involvement or

@

complicity in the assassination. As J. Lee Rankin 5
commented before this Committee:

++-when I read...the Church Committee's fo» é

report--it was an ideal situation for 7

them to just pick out any way they
wanted to tell the story and fit it
in with the facts that had to be met
and then either blame the rest of it
on somebody else or not tell any more
or polish it off. I don't think that

Depo. of J. Lee Rankin, 8/17/78, p.91)

The Committee is in agreement with Mr. Rankin
that had the aAMLASH operation been disclosed to
the Warren Commission, the Commission might have
been able to foreclose the speculation and conjecture
that has surrounded the AMLASH operation during
the past decade. As history now. records, the AMLASH
Operation remains a footnote to the turbulent

relations between Castro's Cuba and the United States.
