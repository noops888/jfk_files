The following statement of Zanzibar coup Fu état has just
been issued by the Uganda Minister of Information, Broadcasting
and Tourism: : a

"Who deposed the Sultan of Zanzibar? Many-pecple in East
Africa have reacted to the revolution in Zanzibar where the
government has been overthrown and the Sultan deposed. They
have now formed pheir own opinions as to whether, the coup d'etat
was good or bad.- But unfortunately nat much attention has been
paid to the methods or the means used to bring about the
revolution, But for the sake of record and history, it is
good to try to.establish who was responsible for the overthrow-
ing of the government ang setting up a new one; future generations
would benefitby such an exercise, as with the assassination of
President KENNEDY of America, the name of Cubans ahd Commmists
has been drawn in by the western press reporters. ‘Is it true
that the Cubans organized the coup or not? What would motivate
Cuba to do so? Has Cuba any interest in the islands, if so, what
are they? When I went for the Zanzibar Independence Celebnetiéa,
I met Cuban representatives in Zanzibar. They had been invited by

the government which has been overthrown now, which mennt that
the government was friendly to them. But it was .there! on

10 December 1963, at the Palace cf the Sultan in’ front: of which
lay the ship SALIFKALIF, which has carried the Sultan away,

that a top ranking British officer who was to leave Zanzibar

the following day after many years of service there, told me
that he was sorry, only for one thing, namely; that independence
of Zanzibar had come before the formation of the East African
Federation, because he thought Zanzibar might become a:Cuba to
the East African mainland, New how could Cuba overthrew another
Cuba? Cuba being so far away from Zanzibar, how would: the Cubans
get into Zanzibar and by which ship? The sruth is that the former
goverament was a socialist government which was friendly to
Caire, Indonesia and Cuba. The following.points are of prime
importance: The British Commissioner of Police, Mr. SULLIVAN,
was not attacked in spite of the fact that he was in charge of
the only armed force in the country. TYe Sultands Palace was
not attacked immediately-unlike in the Russian Revolution, Only
Indians were in fact reported to have been captured and imprisoned
although the British alsc owned property on the island; The
British and Americans were reported quite safe in the European
club. The American Project Mercury, worth [4 gr G] million,

was never attacked although it is irénical that the Sultan
should now feel that he would be safe in Dar-es-Salaam‘where

Mr. BABU, who is now the Foreign Minister, and most probably

Mr. KARUME were, at the beginning of the revolution and:from
where, unlike other people they could leave for Zanzibar during
the revolution, without any apparent difficulty. The former
government asked for assistance, ‘but the néw government asked
Tanganyika for medical assistance. Mr. KISASA was immédiately
appointed by the revolutionary council, to take over tHe key and
most strategic position of Commissioner of Police, a sign of
great confidence." .
