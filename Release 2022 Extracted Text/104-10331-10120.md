SUBJECT: JFK Board Request for Transfer i:
of CIA Documents

(U) This memorandum is for your information. It summarizes
arrangements between CIA and the JFK Assassination Records Review
Board (ARRB) to transfer certain CIA records to the Board's
offices.

(FOUO) Background:. During a meeting with you on 16 October,
ARRB Chairman John Tunheim requested that the Agency transfer a
large quantity of records related to the JFK assassination. The
request was based on the Board‘s need to have the documents--
totaling approximately 190,000 pages--reviewed by the Board’s
staff. Judge Tunheim and other Board members consider it
unworkable for their staff to review the documents in the
Gnternational Point/Building, to which the records would be moved
when the Center for the Study of Intelligence moves there in mid-
November.

(C) The principal issue raised by the request is one of

control over and protection of the sensitive CIA (mainly DO

' records once they are transferred to the Board’s offices in the
District at 600 E Street, N.W. The Board has agreed to construct
a dedicated secure facility (SCIF), access to which would be
controlled by Agency personnel. (Qoger Martin} DCI Area Security
Officer, has conducted a preliminary Survey of the space where
the ‘SCIF would be located, and concludes that the proposed
security arrangements would be acceptable.

(FOUO) A.second issue concerns funding for the construction
of the SCIF. There would also be additional costs for

installation of a secure telephone and a secure fax, which are
needed to allow secure communications with Gnternational Poipt}
We are proposing that the Agency and ARRB share the costs, but it
is possible that the Agency will be asked to reimburse’ the Board

for whatever funds they expend. In any event, we do not believe
that the costs will be great.

(FOUO) Conclusion: Our judgment is that the Agency should
comply with the JFK Board’s request, but that the transfer of
records should clearly be documented as temporary. Thedocuments
would be provided in increments. Once the Board‘s staff. has, .
reviewed a group of records, they would be returfied to the Agency
for final review and sanitization, before they are released to
the National Archives. We plan to detail to the Board a small
number of reviewers from the Historical Review Group who would
control access to the documents and also assist in coordinating
the records review.

(FOUO) Unless you have objections, we plan to transfer to
the JFK Board the records requested by the Board's Chairman. The
timing will be contingent on the installation of an approved
security facility and an agreement on funding. 7
