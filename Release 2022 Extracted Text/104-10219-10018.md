Chief, Miami Field Office

Joseph R. Merola

1. We recently received a call from Joseph R. Merola, Gordon
Cooper and Associates, Opa-Locka, Florida, who informed us that he
was entering the county jail in Nassau County, New York on 13 Novem-
ber 1972 to begin a one year sentence for petty larceny, He stated
that he felt he should let us know his whereabouts "in case you wanted
to get hold of me for anything".

2. Merola, of course, protested his innocence to us and stated
that he was accused of participating in an armed robbery and was tried
on this charge in May 1972 with the trial ending in a hung jury. He
claimed that the prosecuting attorney recommended dismissal of the
charges because of his inability to prove Merola's guilt. Merola
alleges that the judge stated that Merola's record proves him an un-
desirable character and therefore the charges should not be dropped.
The judge thereupon offered him the choice of a retrial with a promise
of a twenty-five year sentence if convicted, or to plead guilty to a
charge of petty larceny with a one year sentence. Merola choose the
latter.

3. We thanked him for his thoughtfuiness and wished him well.
