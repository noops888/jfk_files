23. (Unclassified - THW) LIAISON Ken Geisen, DIA, called and
with regard to Representative Les Aspin's (D., Wis.) current trip to Europe
asked if we had any indication that the Congressman would be seeking meetings
with Defense attaches. He also asked what cover Representative Aspin was
using for his trip. I told Geisen that he was going under the auspicies of the
House Armed Services Committee and that he wanted a meeting with a couple
of country team representatives and that he might possibly seek a meeting
with Defense attaches but that he had not made any such requests to date.

Department, and mentioned my conversation with Hans Binnendijk, Senate

tomorrow morning. :
