‘SERGI

EYEV, SERGYSV was not present at this particular function, but Lostille
has met him once cr twice at previous Consular Corps functions. SSNGSYV is
polite but has nevar show any aigns of friendlinoss. He is sometat pompous
and frankly a cold fish, KLIMOV atated that he (KLINOV) was from Hoscow. (Coss
tille is not sért.dn if he was born there.) He was educated at tie University
of Moscow and lis stated that o1a major subject was the United Stales, KLINOY

4. When Coatille and KLINOV were alone in the bar, KLIMOV fairly quickly
purned the conversation to a comparison of soviet and Western systems. llowvver,
@t all times he remained polite and listened closely to vostille's side of the
disoussion, KLINWOV started the Ounveraution by stating that he thought Might
life (i,e., nipnt oluba, dunoing, otc.) was.a waste of tine and tiiat he personaly
preferred reading and the arta, lo st ited that in the United States thers suamed

Union had any control over tne satellite countkies. KLUGY criticized american
Jazz, rovies, Juvenile deling-ency, etc. aituoug wite definite in ais om
beliars, *LinV listened attentively to wat Costiile haa to say and took cri*-iciszs
of his own country in striue. as tne two were leaving tie restaurant, KLLNOV

told Costills that in answer to Costille's earlier cuestion on the availabil ity

of Western litersture in the Soviet Union he could only state that he did not

have as xucn access during nis studies as se wuld have Liked.

5- Costille received the impression that Helsinki was Hlinov's first post
and probably the first time ne iad bean out of tue Soviet union, He repeated
a number. of cimes during the conversation his fondness for coscow and that he
found Helsinid to be lacking in cultural life. He appeared to be a;preciative
for tne ride back to the dubassy and upon departing told Costille how much he
enjoyed the ufternoon and hoped that they cight meet again. about two days
before Chtistmas «LIMOV sent via a Soviet imbassy chauffeur two bottles of soviet
vodka to Ccatille's apartment with a lew Year's card attached.

6. Nothing further was heard from KLIMOV until 3 March. At this time he
Phoned Costille to ask if Costille could obtain two tickets to the premiere of
"Ben Hur® for him and hia wife. This was impossible and Costille told him he
would try for tickets at a later date,

7. Mr. Amon HN-YOHANAN, Vice Consul at the Israeli Legation, told Costille
that shortly after the first of the year KLIMV pioned him and asked him to have
& drink and dinner some evening after work: BiN-YOHANAT had also met KLLWOV at
the sams Consular Corps function, During the evening aLINOY told BiN-YOHANVAN
that alsthough not Jewish himself, he had a nuuber of Jewish friends in Hoscow.
XLIWVetoted that he greatly aduired Jewish people for their intellect. ‘he
two had dinner at a local night club, the Klaus Kurki, which csters to young
Finnish girls who come alone on the prowl. HEN-JOHANAN suggested that he and
KLIHOV spot two likely prospects and ask them to dance. KLIKOV became quite
embarrassed and said that he had rather not as his wife wis quite jealous.
BG)-YOHANAN remarked that his wife would never rind out if KLIKOY just danced
with the girl, However, KLIOV still refusod stating that his wife sonenow
could just "feel when he had even danced witn another girl."

8. It will be noted that KLIMOV is listed on the latest Diplomatic Corps
