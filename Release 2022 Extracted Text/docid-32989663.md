AARON ASKED WHETHER THERE WAS A SPECIAL REASON FOR THE

THAT I WAS NOT PERSONALLY AWARE OF ANY SPECIAL REASON FOR THE

1970 EXPANSION ASIDE FROM THE OBVIOUS BASIC FACT THAT FBI

FOREIGN LIAISON OPERATIONS REQUIRED ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL

entered the interview room and asked one of Stewart's attorneys,.

Marcus A. Hollabaugh, who was paying him and specifically

According to

Stewart, Wallach in so many words, said that he felt that if

Hollabaugh retused, there could be a conflict of interest.

Wallach

indicated he thought he might call Hollabaugh and put him under

oath.

account of the interview where it is indicated that he had been

placed under oath by Senator Charles Mc C. Mathlas, JI., in the

Russell Building

but that the interview itselt look place in

SPECIAL AGENT (SA) VI. DOVALD STEWART

BY SSC STAFF HELIBER

Set out bolow is inforuation concerning an interview

of former

FBI SA W. Donald Stewart by en SSC Statt Member.

SSC Staff Ilember James Dick advised the Legal Gounsel

Division of the FBI that he desired to interview Stewart on

the subject of wail openings.

Stewart was initially advised

by the Legal Counsel Division that he had a right to counsel

during the interview

but that the FBI could not provide him

with private counsel. He was advised that he was released from

his employment agreement relating to confidentiality for the

purpose at answering questions concerning mail openings.

was also edvised that the Department of Justice was in"che

process of determining whether there may have been criminal

conduct by FBI personnel who were involved in mail openings.

It was pointed out to Stewart that any statement he gives to the

SSC could be used against him if the Department of Justice

initiates prosecution. He was advised that his appaarance

before the SSC is voluntary and whether to appear and respond

to particular questions is a decision he alone must make.

He was finally advised that the SSC must issue a subpoena before

it could denand he answer questions and that, absent such a

subpoena, he was not compelled to submit to an intervier.

Subsequent to the foregoing advice to Stevart, he

requested in writing to the FBI that an attorney be appointed

for him by the Department of Justice or arrangements be effected

whereby he would be reimbursed if he secured his own attorney.

Re: Interview of Former FBI Special Agent (SA)

W. Donald Stewart by SSG Staff Member

Pursuant to such request, the Department of Justice did arrange

for Stewart to be répresented in this matter by an attorney,

Marcus A. Hollabaugh.

Subsequent to the interview of Stewart,

he voluntarily furnished to the FBI a handwritten "Memo for

the Record" which is set out below.

Oct 1, 1975

Memo for the Record

Subject: Interview with Staff Member

of Senate Select Intelligence Committee

re Bureau Informant 200

At the invitation of

: Senate Select Intelligence

Committee Counsel James Dick, I reviewed several Bureau

Informant 200 memos taken from the Bureau's control file on

that matter.

This review took place at Dick's office in the

New senate Blag. on the morning of Oct L, Lyls. I was

accompanied by my counsels Marcus A. Hollabaugh and Howard Fogl

of the firm of Foley, Lardner, Hollabaugh and Jacobs.

Mx. Hollabaugh is an X-FBI agent (1943-45).

After the above review, we returned to the law firm's

a discussion on how to proceed.

that the Justice Dept was considering the matter involved with

Bureau Informant 200 or possible prosecution we considere

asking fox immunity for me at the scheduled interview at 2 Pi

on Oct. 1, 1975.

We again reported to the Committee's offices in the

new Senate Bldg. at 2 PM for the scheduled interview.

We dis-

cussed immnity with Senate Counsel Dick and he said to date

no one had been granted same and only a few CIA employees had

ever made the request. By pre-planned strategy we decided if

immunity not readily possible, we would proceed with the inter-

view and, if necessary, invoke the th Amendment at a time a

question might tend to

be incriminating. This never had to be

done.

Re:

W. Donald Stewart by SSC Staff Member

Prior to the interview it was necessary for myself,

my counsels, the Senate Counsel and the courtroom reporter

to go to the office of Senator Charles Mc G. Mathias, Jr.,

(Md.) in the Russell Bldg, to get me sworn by him. We there-

after adjourned to Room 608 in the Carroll Arms for the inter

view which began at 2:30 p.m. and terminated at 5:40 p.m.

During the interview I was questioned about the origin

of the Hunter Project (Bureau Informant 200); mechanics of

handling the mail; whether the illegality of the project was

considered or discussed at the Bureau and did Mr. Hoover know

to the latter, I advised the

illegality was never a topic of discussion because

our program and we were only the recipients of CIA's product.

We discussed the saleguarding of the material which I advised

was kept in a special mailroon and the entire program was

I informed that I doubted if Mr. Hoover was aware

of the project and really had no reason to know.

I advised that

we developed criteria in regard to material which was furnished

a specific intelligence interest to us as outlined by our

criteria passed to GIA.

Mr. Dick asked several questions on the GIA Watch

List - how we added and deleted names.

He had some misimpres

sions of the Watch List which I believe I corrected.

He was interested in the volume of mail received and

when it increased.

He wondered whether we had an inspector

named "Vince."

This developed as a result of

Don Moore had been interviewed for

four hours during the morning of Oct 1, 1975. I advised "Vince"

was Vince Nasca who handled Cuban matters and mail reflecting

Cuban activity or from a Cuban in the U. S, to one or anyone

in the USSR and vice-versa was automatically routed to Nasca

at that time.

To simplity routing, all such mail was designated

"Hunter - Vince."

with my explanation. For the most part, he handed me a Bureau

Informant memo - 9 exhibits - and he discussed particular

points contained therein. No great relevations were developed

by him. My interview seemed mainly to provide some clarification

of how the Bureau Intormant 200 program operated. Most of the

information he probably became aware of just by reviewing all

the memos in his possession.

Attention is invited to the information in the Ad-

dendum above wherein it is reported that the SSc intends to

classify the transcript of the interview "Top Secret."

According to Executive Order 11652, authority to classify is

vested within the executive branch of the Government and there

is no provision or other procedure known to the FBI whereby

the legislative branch may classify documents.

Memorandum from Mr. W. A. Branigan to Mr. W. R. Wannall

RE:

SENSTUDY

The Senate Select personnel inquired how the programs

were terminated by Mr. Hoover and expressed surprise that no

written communication had been directed to our field offices.

Senate Select personnel also inquired whether there might be

other mail intercept programs which were conducted in the

investigation of criminal matters. They indicated that a

specific request would be forthcoming from the Committee

addressed to this aspect.

During the briefing, Mr. Wallach mentioned that

within the past three to six months he had occasion to be in

the New York Post Office Building. In attempting to leave the

building, he accidentally came upon some individuals who were

photographing the outside of envelopes.

that he was informed that the individuals were Bureau personnel

who were engaged in a particularly sensitive mail cover.

Wallach noted that this situation was not covered in the Bureau's

answer to the Senate Select Committee communication although

our answer did state with respect to mail covers that the

Bureau was continuing to check.

In approximately June, 1975, a Postal Service official

advised that one of our Agents had received permission to

At the conclusion of the briefing, the Senate Select

Committee personnel indicated that they were aware that the

Bureau's files on Jane Fonda contained a letter that she had

written in Los Angeles to an unknown address in Paris, France.

The Senate personnel indicated that this occurred toward the

end of 1971 which was well beyond the termination of our mail

intercept surveys and the interception of such a letter would

not have fallen within the purview of the CIA's Hunter Project.

inquiring as to this and other letters which might appear in

Reference is made to Part I, Item 2, of the

August 26, 1975, request by the SSC for access

to screen

for delivery certain materials pertaining to National

Security Agency (NSA) Watch List activity.

Items 2a, b, c, d, e, 8, h, j and k requested

11sts or documents

regarding requests by the FBI for the

Inclusion on the NSA, Watch Ilst of the names of various

individuals. A review of FBI records which might have

included the requested documents did not locate any of the

foregoing. With regard to the requests for lists sent

by the FBI to the NSA and the "Bureau's Watch List" as of

specified past dates, the following information, which may

explain their absence from FlI files, is offered for your

assistance.

The NSA Watch List was not an FBI program.

Accordingly, no separate file was maintained on the Hatch

List.

Neither was any centralized record of additions to

or deletions from the Watch List maintained. There tas no

operational need for the FBI to maincain in its permanent

files copies of the Watch list as of any given date because

Memorandum, W.A. Branigan to W.R. Wannall, dated

9/12/75, reported on briefing of Senate Select Committee (SSC)K

staff personnel by SAs J.P. Lee and W.A. Branigan. During the

mentioned that within

course of the briefing, one of these individuals, Paul Wallack,

the past three to six months, while in

the New York Post Office Building, he accidentally came upon

some individuals photographing the outsides of envelopes.

Wallach said he was informed that these individuals were

Bureau

personnel engaged in a sensitive mail cover.

He noted this

situation was not covered in the Bureau's answer to the SSC,

although the Bureau did state, with respect to mail covers,

we were continuing to check.

With regard to the above, New York Office (NYO)

currently operates two authorized mail covers on the People's

Repúblic of China Mission to the United Nations (PRCMUN) •

One of these involves incoming mail and the other, outgoing

mail.

In approximately June, 1975, the Bureau liaison

officer in contact with the U.S. Postal Service officials,

Washington, D.C., informed SA H.J. Morgan, JI., CI-2 Section,

62-11:51876

A Postal Service official from Washington, D.C.,

had recently been in the New York Post Office and had observed

an individual photographing the outsides of envelopes.

When

he inquired concerning this, he had been informed that the

individual doing the photographing was an FBI Agent.

this time there was abundant publicity concerning CIA personnel

working on Post Office premises with regard to mail openligs 975

A Postal Service official was due to testify before a

Congressional committee at about that time and did not destre

to be in the position of stating the FBI was then working on

Post Office premises.

It was requested that the SA involved

be removed from the New York Post Office and the offer was made

that the Postal inspectors would be happy to take any necessary

photographs for the Bureau.

Memorandum to Mr. W.R. Wannall

SENSTUDY 75

SA Morgan contacted Supervisor K.R. Buckman,

New York Office, by secure telephone at which time SA Buckman

acknowledged that an SA had been phötographing envelopes at

the New York Post Office in one particular unknown subject

case involving the mailing of bulky envelopes to a military

man at the PRCMUN/Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This was being

done in order to assist the Philadelphia Office in identifying

the unknown subject, as the bulky envelopes would not fit

the normal camera used for photographing of envelopes by Postal

Service employees and required a special camera.

Supervisor

Buckman advised that the SA was on annual leave

at that time

and he felt sure the camera had been removed from Post Office

premises.

He was instructed to have the camera removed

immediately, if not previously done, and was told to have the

SA cease and desist in the above activity. SA Buckman advised

he would comply with these instructions.

He was informed of

the offer made by the Postal Service to photograph above

envelopes if it was felt necessary in the future. Arrangements

for this would be made through FBIHQ, and no subsequent requests

have been received from the New York Office in this regard.

written instructions concerning the above were furnished to the

New York Office.

Mr. Hoover's FBI Office in June, 1970. Also present

during these meetings was Charles D. Brennan, former

Memorandum to Mr. Adams from Legal Counsel

Re: HUSTON. PLAN PUBLIC. HEARINGS,

. He testified Mr. Sullivan had recommended en-

dorsement of the final ad hoc Committee report to Mr.

Hoover and urged cooperation among the intelligence

agencies "so that we. can overcome past differences."

Following Mr. Hoover's rejection of the ad hoc

rem to M. Route Haldean, he med counselor to foesident

dum to Mr.

Nixon, which recommended further pressure be brought to

bear on Mr. Hoover to agree with the plan. See attached

memorandum dated August. 5, 1970.

Chairman Church and Senator Howard Baker of

Tennessee, summarized their impression that although

FBI, CIA, DIA, etc., had been engaged in mail openings,

surreptitious entries, and electronic surveillance for

number of years prior to the ad hoc Committee establish-

ment, President Nixon and his predecessors. had been un-

aware of details of these illegal activities and that the

lad hoc report sought Presidential "legitimization" for

them.

Additionally, President Nixon also had been un-

aware the CIA had been involved in domestic intelligence

such

as Agency operation CHAOS, and DIA involvement in

domestic intelligence field

the

intelligence agencies were

"doing their own thing with

no fear of

accountability. Endemic to the failure of the

so. called

"Huston Plan"

was Mr. Hoover's refusal to par-

ticipate in it because of his question regarding the legality

'of expansion of mail cover operations.

At the suggestion of Chairman Church, Huston

recommended the

abolishment of our Internal Security

analysis capability in the

domestic intelligence field.

Similar observations had

been made to Mr. Huston by former. Assistant Director

Sullivan during the existence of the ad hoc Committee in

activities with CIA. However, Mr. Huston did not cite

specific examples of our shortcomings in this area, if

•1. More than the FBi is involved in this operation. disa,

DIA, CiA, and the military scivices all have a groat stale and a

Enrough community-vide coordination to diy out the incornation

.by using ail

the resouices potentially available. It is,

of course,

a matter of balancing the obvious risks against the desiied

results. I though we balanced these risks rather objectircly

•in the repoit, and floover is escalating the risks in oider to

cloal his, deierminalion to continue to do business as lisual..

1. At some point, Hoover has to be iold who is President.

:"He has become totally unreasonable and his conduci is detrimental

to our domestic intelligence operations. In the past tro waalis,

he has icrminaiad all FBI liaison with NSA, DIA, the military

services, Sceret Service -- evciyone excopt the White House..

Ha

terminated liaison with CIA in May. This is bound to have a

crippling ciect upon the etire community and is contrary to

his public assurance to, toe President ai the mecting that there

was close and cliacive coordination and cooperation within the

inalliganga community. It is imposiani to remember that tha

chiire intelligence community knows that the Presideni mace a

positive decision to go acad ard Hoover has now sliccceded in

forcing a reviei.

It he gets his way it is going io look lie ha

is moie poweriul then the President. Ile lad his say in the

footnotes and Ru accided against him. That shoula close the

mattei and I can't understand why ine AG is a party to rcopazing it.

1ll of us aïo going to look damn siily in the eyes of flaims, Gajier,

Bennett, and the miliary chios il Hoover can unilaterally seroise

a "iosidential decisior basad on a iagort that many people wastied

their asses of to prepare and which, on its mariis, vas a firsi

rado, objective job.

6. Iloovar can be expected to raise the following poinis

•in your mosting:

. (a) "Our prosent cfforts ara adeguaio." Tha anotar

is bullshitl this is particularly true with ogard to FBI campus

(o) "che risks are too gicai; these folls are going to

get the President into trouble and AN had bolter liston to mo."

The answer is that we have considered the risks, wa balieve they

are accabiable and justiried under the circumsiances.

Nothing wa piogose io

(c) "I don'i have the personnel to do the job the

(2) he can gat ihem.

(a) "I don'i objai to lisA conducting surreptitious catry

to get them, it is an abijob.

(c) "Ii we dó these things the jackels of the press' and the

•ACuT vill find out, ve can't avoid loaks." Answei:

Tie can avoid

lealis by using trained, trusted agents and restricting knovicege oi

sensitiva operations on a strict necd io know casis. We do this

or.oiher seasilive oparations evezy day.

(e). "If I have to do those things, the ditorney General

will have to approve them in writing."

This is up to the AG, but

I would toll loover that he has been instructed to do them by

the President and he is to do them on that authority. Ile nocan't

10ck for a scape goat.

Ic has his authority from the President

and he doest't need a written memo from the AG.

To maintain

socarity, tre should avoid writan communications in this arsa.

(g) "We don't need an inter-Agency Commitice on

Inteiligence Operations because (1) we're doing fine sight now --

500d coordination, etc. a. and 13) there are other cristing groups

which can inndle this assignment." The answer is that we cra

doing lousy sight now and there arch't other groups which can

do the job we have in mind bacise: (1) they don't mect; (2) they

don't have the people on thein we vart oi have some people va

don't want; (3) they don't have the authority to do whoi ta want

(5) the; aren't linked to the White House stail.

There are doubtless another dozen or so spacious arguments

thei ricover will irise, but they will be of similar quality. I hoga

that you vill be able to convince the do of the importance and

nocessity of getting Hooter to go along.. We have workor io=

He had absolutely no intcrest in the views of disa,

With Respect to Intelligence Activities (SSC)

Re: Interview of Former FBI Inspector Joseph A. Sizoo

by SSG Staff Members

On September 23, 1975, at 9:00 a.I., I was interviewed

and matters directly relating thereto. Subsequent to the

interview by Epstein and Debreo, I was interviewed by Martha

Talley and John Ellift concerning matters previously cleared

with the Bureau as to investigative procedures of the Domestic

Intelligence Division (DID), the Security Index and related

indices, the Counterintelligence Program, and the dissemination

of information.

the interview was concluded at 12:15 p.m. anc

took place in one of the Committee's interview rooms in the

forner Carroll Arms Hotel. At the outset of the first interview,

I was furnished and signed an "ADVICE OF RIGHTS" statement which

was retained by Mr. Epstein.

His. Epstein began his interview by asking questions

concerning my Bureau assignments and tenure oi service as an

official of the DID. These matters I answered fully.

Mr. Epstein asked

me to furnish, and I did

the

organizational setup of the DID from the time that I last

joined the DID in 1955 to the time I recired. Among the things

covered in my response were the following.

I identified by name the various Assistant Direccors

and Branch Chiefs from 1955 onward. The Assistant Directors

were Alan Beimont, William C.

Sullivan, Charles D. Brennan and

Edward Miller.

The Branch Chiefs, in addition

to myself,

were Carl Hennrich and Donald E. Moore. I lurisned che

approximate periods of time the various Assistant Directors

served as such in the DID.

I also furnished, at Mr. Epstein's

specific request, the last previous assignent for each of the

He then asked a series of questions concerning the

Bureau's investigation of the comminist infiltration of the SCLC

and the basis for such investigation.

It was pointed out that

allegations had been received in the Bureau from time to time

concerning conmunist infiltration into the SCLe and the purpose

of the Bureau's investigation was to determine wether or not

Hunter Pitts O'Dell and asked if his presence as a staft officer

of SCLC had been instrumental in the initiation of the investiga

tion.

I told him that I did not recall the details but it might

well be that O'Dell's presence on the SCLC Staff was one of the

reasons for the investigation.

He asked if the alleged relationship between

hiartin Luther King, JI.,

a man named Levison (Stanley Dovid

Levison) was a contributing factor to the initiation of the

investigation by the Bureau. I told him chat this also might

well have been the case.

He then asked if our investigation was

to determine the association of King and other SCLC officials

with communists or to determine whether or not such communists

did, in fact, exert influence over SCLC officials.

I told him

that it would seem logical for our investigation to address

itself to both aspects of the associution between King and

members of the Communist Pacty.

He asked if the Bureau did,

in fact, assume the presence of connunisi influence if there

was an association between SCLC officials and members of che

Communist Party. I told him that such an assumption would not

be made but that our investigation would be addressed to decermine

the presence and extent of communist influence over SCLC leaders.

Epstein then made reference to Levison and said that from his

review of infornation made available to him it appeared to him

that Levison was a critical fi ure in the investigation of King

on the activities of levison and

I told him that I could not. He then

pressed for additional infoimation concerning levison and asked

why I could not fumish more specific information concerning

Levison's significance as a communist. I told him that I could

not provide any additional information because it might well

adversely affeci confidencial sources.

Epstein then called my attention to a menorandun

attended by certain field representatives fron Atlanta in which

methods of handling our investigaion of sele and king wered

Re: Interview of Former FBI Inspector Joseph A. Sizoo

Epstein also called my attention to a 1963 SAG Letter

instructing that intensified ertorts be made by che field to

levelop the maximum possible intormation concerning Connunisi

arty efforts to infiltrate and influence other organizations.

and asked if this did not indicate a change in direction of

the investigation of communist infiltration of organizations

because he

said he read into that SAG Letter thai it was desired

that the field develop information for possible counterintelligence

use.

I called his actention to the fack that the Letter speaks

for itself and did not contain language wich would support

his assumptions.

Mr. Epstein also noted that the Bureau had used

microphone coverage on King fron time to time.

He showed me a

menorandum which related to a telephone call I had received from

New York requesting authority for New York to place microphone

coverage on King.

wich reference to microphone coverage, he

aSked iI our coverage was placed 1or the purpose oi developing

personal misconduct as to King as well as information concerning

communist intluence and I told hin that as the particular

memorandum reflects it was to determine the nature of the

communist influence around King-

He then asked if I had the

authority to approve such microphone installation at that time.

1 pointed out chat as che memorandum in question reflecis time

was of the essence, I had approved New York's going ahead with

It and did send the instant memorandum through for final approval

and it was, in fact, approved by lir. Hoover.

lix. Epstein also made reference to the handling of

Klan and racial matters, noting that the memoradun referred to

above had been checked for Mr. Rosen, and asked if the General

I told him that as I recalled this was true as of that time.

With Respect to Intelligence Activities (SSC)

Re: Interview of Former FBI Inspector Joseph A. Sizoo

by SSC Staff Menbers

He then asked how it happened thai the racial and klan matters

were transferred to the DID, indicating that he had noted that

DID had more recently supervised these matters.

that as I recalled, Mr. Sullivan had reconmended in a memorandum

that these matters be transferred to DID on the basis that they

were of an intelligence-type investigation and he considered it

more logical that they be supervised in DID.

After the above interview conducted by Mr. Epstein

and Miss DeOreo, Martha Talley and John Elliff were

called and

came into the room to conduct their porcion of this interview.

Martha Talley began the interview by asking a series of questions

regarding the origin of the Security Index.

She indicated

considerable knowledge of the general period when the security

Index was developed and asked if I had any knowledge wny the

Security Index was considered necessary.

I told her that I did

noi have detailed knowledge because I was not in the Division at

that cine.

However, I understood that the creation of the Index

had been the subjeci of discussion beiween Bureau officials and

Deparimental officials and it was the feeling that a more

efficient and effective list of persons dangerous to the security

of the country should be developed than was available ai the

beginning of World War II.

I was asked by Mr. Elliff who could approve additions

and deletions to the Security Index. In response, I first

pointed out to lix. Elliff that ne appeared to have in his

possession a folder containing detailed inscructions within the

FBI concerning the Security Index and that such information vas

likely already in his possession. Nonetheless, I did advise

him my recollection was that approvals went up

through the

Assistant Director of DID whereas deletions did not go quite

that high in endorsement. I also pointed out that, as in all

other matters relating to the Security Index, approval of the

Department of Justice was required.

Again, it appeared apparent

to me that the Comnittee already had in its possession the answers

to the questions being asked of me in this area.

Miss Talley then asked what the distinction was between

created. I

pointed out that they appeared to have copies of all pertinent

memoranda conceming this and other matters referced to and that

the menoranda would

certainly speak for thenselves.

At this point Elliff took over the interview and

repeated the questions asked by Epstein conceming the transfer

of racial and Klan matters to Division 5 (DID) and I gave him

in essence the same answer.

Elliff then asked when the Bureau began lavestigations

oi thie groups opposing the Vietnan War and 1 cold him 1 had no

independent recollection concerning such investigations,

also asked if I had any recollection as to the instructions that

went to the field to open investigations concerning new groups

in the general racial field and I told him that i did not recall.

such instructions.

Ellift then showed me a 1970 Executive

Conference memorandum written by C. D. Brennan concerning the

opening of individual active investigations on members of antiwar

and selated groups, it being noted in an SAG Letter that we had

prevzously not investigated

all members or such groups.

He

asked why the Bureau had decided to institute investigation of

individual members of such groups,

and I told him I had no

independent recollection of why this was done.

Re: Interview of Former I'BI Inspector Joseph A. Sizoo

by SSG Staff Members

Elliff then asked a series of questions concerning the

break with Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the discontinuance

He asked how liaison was handled

with CIA after the break and I told him it was done by lecter or

telephone by the individual Section Chieis or DID FIONi OrfiCE

officials.

Ile then asked if liaison with other agencies, noting

that the discontinuance of liaison with other agencies followed

shortly after the break with CIA, was handled in the same way.

I told him this was the case.

He then asked if the Bureau did

not suffer as a result of the discontinuance of liaison with CIA

and other agencies.

I told him that the Bureau officials and

supervisors did the best they could to fulfill any liaison needs

with other agencies but it was quite obvious from the fact that

liaison was reinstituted some years later and is in effect today

that more effective liaison can be maintained by a separate section.

Elliff then asked if I could tell him what the "mass

media program" was, as he noted on some copies of mail that

copies were designated for Mx. Bishop with the further notation

"mass media program."

I told him I did not recall that he had

requested Bureau clearance for me to discuss such a progran where-

upon he withdrew the question.

He then said there were a couple

of other matters he would like to discuss with me if I felt free

told him that since his request for clearance had not covored such

matters, I would not discuss such matters.

would be willing to discuss such matters with him if he obtained

clearance and I told him I would not. Elliff also said that

had not obtained clearance, but if I would do so, he would like

to ask a series of questions concerning the "Huston Matter" and

also some questions concerning the technical surveillances that

the Bureau apparently had in etiect at the request of

Mr. Kissinger

s office at the White House. I told him that I

had no clearance to discuss such matters.

Mr. Elliff's last questions related to the Counter-

intelligence Program in which he asked for my recollection of

the reasons for the approval of the Program and when and why it

was discontinued. I told him I had no independent recollection

with reference to specifically why the Program was created or

why it was discontinued.

NOTE:

Information fron Epstein and Elliff was accepted by

supervisor P. V. Daly of the Legal Counsel Division and Daly

briefed Sizoo before the interview (see Legal Counsel to Mr. J. B.

Adams memorandum, 9/22/75,

"Senstudy 75").

After the interview,

Siz00 dictated his statement to a Bureau stenographer and

supplemented it with information he telephonically furnished on

9/25/75 to Supervisor S. F. Phillips of the Senstudy Project.

This memorandum summarizes a briefing afforded K.

Mr. Walter Ricks, Staff Member, Senate Select Committee on

Intelligence Activities, by Section Chiefs, Joseph G. Deegan

and Robert I. Shackelford and Liaison Supervisor B.C. Rachner,

covering the FBI's relationship with the IRS Special Service

Staff

Program.

Ricks was principally interested in the basis for

the FBI's cooperation with IRS concerning this Program, the

extent of any known White House or Congressional influence,

the type of information disseminated to IRS, the mechanics of

dissemination and the basis for the discontinuance of

dissemination.

The FBI's policy of disseminating information of

jurisdictional interest to other agencies within the Executive

Branch of Government was explained to Ricks.

Concerning IRS,

it was pointed out that the FBI's first knowledge of the

formation by IRs of its Special Service Staff, originally

known as the Activist Organization Committee,

August, 1969, following receipt of a letter from IRS re-

questing that the FBI disseminate to the IRS Special Service

Staff reports concerning approximately 75 extremist and

dissident groups listed by IRS.

Following the approval of

former Director J. Edgar Hoover, the FBI proceeded to make

the requested dissemination to

IRS. Although this

concentrated Program broadened our previous scope of

dissemination to IRS, it was explained to Ricks that the

dissemination was responsive to an official IRS request and

fully consistent with the ill t

agencies within the Executive Branch of Government.

further explained that the FBI did not initiate.

subjects of previous FBI investigations. Rather, the FBI

restricted its dissemination to information developed in

current investigations within FBI jurisdiction. From a

practical standpoint, FBI reaction to the IRS request was

not unlike a routine name check request involving a large

Ricks was informed that the FBI had no direct

knowledge concerning the ultimate use and disposition of

the FBI information by IRS.

It was pointed out that the

FBI was in no position to challenge the credibility of

another agency's jurisdictional interest without some

obvious basis. In this case, the IRs in making its request

advised that

the information was desired for the purpose of

initiating field investigations and audits looking toward

uncovering tax and gun law violations. Obviously, the FBI

had no reason to question this motive. Concerning White

House influence, Ricks was advised that the FBI had no

direct knowledge of such influence outside of a memorandum

noting a comment by an IRS official that the Special Service

Staff had been formed by IRS as a result of White House and

Congressional pressures. Robert I. Shackelford, Joseph G.

Deegan and B. C. Rachner emphasized they had no personal

knowledge of such pressures nor knowledge of any information

in FBI files evidencing such pressures.

Shackelford and Deegan explained to Ricks the

mechanics of FBI dissemination to IRS as it related to the

Special Service Staff Program. Briefly, upon receipt of

the original IRS request, FBIHQ officials and FBI field

divisions were alerted to the IRS interest. Upon receipt

by FBIHQ of a report falling within the guidelines, the

substantive Supervisor, following a review of the report,

would designate it for dissemination to IRS. No

dissemination of the report was made at the field level.

The dissemination material was forwarded by a covering

routing slip addressed to the IRS Special Service Staff and

actually transmitted by courier service.

This procedure was

fully consistent with the mechanics of dissemination to

other agencies within the Executive Branch of Government.

In

response to a direct question, Shackelford, Deegan and Rachner

advised that they had no personal knowledge of any

dissemination under this Program routinely received by the

FBI from IRS. It was pointed out to Ricks that the receipt

of information from IRS in all areas is extremely limited

inasmuch as IRS investigative information is tax related and

cannot be disclosed to anyone including Government agencies

ithout abiding by the very complex provisions of the IRs

ode. These provisions were briefly explained to Ricks b

Ricks asked whether the FBI had any way of

determining the number of reports disseminated to IRS under

the Special Service Staff Program. Ricks was told it would

be impossible to come up with this figure and he dropped the

subject. Ricks also inquired whether Shackelford, Deegan or

Rachner were aware of any instances wherein the FBI had

inspired IRS to take some initiative to investigate a

specific organization or individual. Ricks made specific

mention of the "Cointelpro" program. Shackelford, Deegan

and

Rachner advised that they had no personal knowledge of

such action and pointed out to Ricks that the "Cointelpro"

program was a separate program handled by other areas of the

Intelligence Division.

Concerning discontinuance of the program, it was

confirmed that the FBI terminated its dissemination to the

IRS Special Service Staff in September, 1973, in accordance

with a specific request from the Commissioner of IRS. Ricks

was further advised that, thereafter, the FBI continued

dissemination, pursuant to agreement with the Commissioner,

Information only of a jurisdictional interest to IRs in

connection with IRs responsibilities relating to possible

violations of the tax laws.

This dissemination was directed

to the Intelligence Division of IRS. The only exception is

information of a personnel conduct or personnel security

nature which is disseminated to the Internal Security Division

of IRS.

Ricks was very friendly and professional in his

approach. His questions were reasonable. He seemed very

knowledgeable of the background of the program and related

subject matter and at times gave the impression of being

Director Sec'y —

By memorandum 9/17/75, you were advised of the ten-

tative schedule for public testimony before the Senate Select

Committee involving

the Bureau. One of the announced topics

involved the Bureau's involvement with local authorities re-

lative to the police raid on the Black Panther Party in

Chicago, Illinois, which resulted in the shooting death of

Fred Hampton, Chicago Black Panther Party Leader.

The representatives of the Committee in previous

discussions with representatives of this Division and the

Department had made overtures regarding the interviews of

Agents involved in the Fred Hampton matter and the Committee/

has made document requests in that area. Concern was ex-

pressed to the Committee representatives and to the Department

that a public hearing on this topic would adversely impact on

civil litigation areas out of the Hampton matter involving

Bureau Agents as defendants in their individual and official

capacity.

It was also pointed out to the Department and Com-

mittee that this particular civil litigation was scheduled tor

trial In November

and it was apparent that the Committee's pub-

'lic hearings would be :

also I held in November.

At the request of the Deputy Special Counsel for

Intelligence Coordination in the Department, Steven Blackhurst;

SAs Paul V. Daly and Robert C. Blunt met with him and Edward

Christenbury of the Department to discuss this particular

matter. It was the Department's position that since the

Attorney General has indicated that requests of the Senate

Select Committee should not be refused because of the impact

they might have on civil or criminal litigation that the

document request would have to be fulfilled.

In this regard,

"Christenbury indicated that Chicago police officers who are"

also defendants in the civil litigation had expressed through

their attorneys the fleoncern that the release of documents

RE:

and/or testimony might adversely impact on their trial.

Christenbury stated that he had conversed with attorneys

representing the local officials and these attorneys in-

dicated that they would fight any motion in the Federal

District Court in Chicago wherein the civil litigation

should be held in the modification of an existing protective

order.

In this regard, many of the documents requested by the

senate Select Committee are under a protective order and prior

to release to the Senate Select Committee, the protective order

must be modified. Christenbury stated that the Department would

file a motion to have the order modified at the request of the

Senate Select Committee; however, their request would be neutral

insofar as recommendations. to the court:

By this, he explained that the motion would merely

state that the Senate Select Committee had requested material

currently under the protective order by the court and asked

court to consider modifying the existing protective order.

Christenbury stated that it was apparent that from statements

the local defendants'

counsels made that they would resist, as

much as possible, any modification of this order.

It was pointed out to Christenbury that this Bureau

had received unofficial requests that Agents, Iormer or current;

who are defendants in this matter submit to interview and that

we did not feel that such Agents

should submit to interview in

view of the pending civil litigation. Christenbury indicated

that he

was in agreement as was Blackhurst and that they would

attempt to resist efforts to interview the Bureau personnel in-

volved as defendants in this matter.

The consensus of those at

this meeting was that it was unfortunate and undesirable that

hearings be held on this particular topic since the very issues

to be raised during the civil litigation would be the focal

point of public hearings.

Blackhurst on 9/26/75 advised that he had again brought

to the attention of John Ellif, Task

Force Director of the Domestic

Task Force of the Senate Select Committee, the 'Department's and

Bureau's concern relative to public hearings on this topic and

Elliff indicated that they were reconsidering having hearings on

this matter and that it was entirely possible that these hearings,

in fact, will not be held. Additionally,

Blackhurst indicated

there have been no further requests relative to the requesting

of Agents to submit to interview by. the Committee.

BACKGROUND jordan is Chairman of Communications Committee,

Black United Front, lashington, D.C., (WDC), an organization

advocating retaliatory killing of police officers who attack

members os black community.

Jordan has formed an armed

community defense group stating this is the way to keep

police in their place.

Jordan, on 8/5/70, appeared at TBI Headquarters

demanding FBI Law Enforcement Bulletins be made available

to him, and when advised this was not possible, he became

offensive.

By letter dated 9/12/70 Jordan requested

background regarding FBI contracts for purchasing of office

machines and other data. The Director indicated

"It is

none of their business so disregard the inquiry."

on

11/10/70 Jordan contacted FBI Headquarters demanding to

know why FBI was unresponsive to legitimate demands oi

black people, particularly in Cairo, Illinois. Jordan

was "set straight."

As a Key Black Extremist we need significant

information regarding subject's financial sources.

It you

approve, attached memorandum should be returned to Domestic

Intelligence Division so that the inclatty returns can be

obtained and reviewed.

This responds to your letter of May 31, 1968, requesting copies of the

income tax returns of this and other persons for the years 1966 and 1967.

Our records do not show that this individual filed income tax returns for

1966 and 1967. However, there is a record of a 1965 return (Document

Locator Number 742A003000127F) filed from the address Box 7098, University

Station, Austin, Texas 78712.

Since we had no record for 1966 and 1967, we asked our District Director

in Chicago to make an investigation. He reports that:

"The taxpayer was

unknown at 1829 North Orchard Street, Chicago, Illinois. Local SDS payroll

records disclose that Mr. Pardun was

employed

there during 1967 and earned

$247.50 with $1.80 income tax withheld. Based on this information, a tax

return is not required to be filed.

There was no record of earnings for

1966 and a current address was not available from the SDS or the FBI.

Under these circumstances we have discontinued

This memorandum recommends uncertified

obtained from the Internal Revenue Service through

the

Liaison Section.

OBSERVATIONS:

Recent events on many college campuses through-

out the nation point up the true anarchistic nature. of the

New Left movement.

It is abundantly clear that this

movement is bent on revolution.

As a result, it is

incumbent upon us to closely follow this movement.

In

part, this can be done through the investigations of its

Key

' Activists.

We have been conducting exhaustive inves-

tigations

of

the activities of certain of the Key

Activists in the New Left.

As a part of our intensification program,

we

are inquiring into the financial activity of these individuals.

Part of this inquiry is to consist of a survey of their

tax returns to determine their financial status,

the source

of their income, and to determine whether their income

supports their ability to travel throughout this country,

and abroad as part of the New Left revolt.

A blind

memorandum for each Key Activist considered for this

phase of our investigation is attached.

SYNOPSIS: In October, 1968, you assigned to Internal Security

Section four supervisors, one clerk, and two stenographers (one

released) on special assignment from other sections and steno

pool within the division.

You specifically instructed these

individuals be assigned to broaden our coverage of New Left in

view of major threat it poses.

You instructed at the end of

four months a reassessment and

recommendations be made as to need

for continuance of this expanded coverage.

The purpose of this

memorandum is

to report the status of this situation with the

recommendation to make permanent personnel assigned to our expanded

coverage of the New

Left movement.

Expanded coverage enabled intensified investigation of

widespread and diverse activities of New Left and concentration of

efforts to define movement, penetrate it, and cope with it.

RE:

NEW • LEFT MOVEMENT

100-446997

DETAILS:

The rapid rise of New Left activity involving large

scale protest demonstrations and student disorders and related

violence including bombings and arsons makes expansion of our

coverage of these matters imperative. A thorough review of the

New Left movement was made looking toward determination of areas •

demanding additional attention and the best approach for in-depth

exploration and evaluation of the problems so that marimum

utili-

zation of manpower could be achieved. In order to achieve a

coordinated intensified investigation of the New Leit, in October,

1968, you temporarily assigned four additional supervisors, one

clerk and two stenographs (one released) to the Internal Security

Section from other sections and the steno pool within the division.

The additional manpower has enabled us to afford in-depth

probative supervision to student disorders, protest groups, New

Left publications and finances, and exploration and evaluation of

foreign influence in the New Left.

We are now able to initiate

surveys and

programs to dig into the problem and cope with it.

rather than follow events as they occur.

For example, the following

accomplishments directly resulted fron utilization of

manpower.

additional

We have

now received the first of our comprehensive

quarterly reports from all offices on the New Left movement

These reports have subheadings of major interest to us,

such

as

"Incidents of Violence," "Finances," "Foreign Influence, " etc.

These reports are particularly valuaole to give us

a national

picture of the movement at one time and will serve as thu basis

for preparation of documents in detail for dissemination.

We have completed a field-wide survey of New Left

publications

There are approximately 250 ot them,

and a select

number are reviewed regularly. Cases are open on those deemed

significant in the New Left movement. Concerning their financial

structure, Of particular interest to us, it

was determined they

are "shoe string" operations dependent on street sales and

solicitations of funds through donations. No large contributors

were noted. They do serve as the communications medium of the

New Left.

Memorandum to Mr. W. C. Sullivan

RE:

NEW LEFT MOVEMENT

100446997

We have radically increased our Key Activists Program,

believing concentration on them to obtain successful prosecutions,

thereby taking them out of the movement, is the best means of

reducing the effectiveness of the movement.

We presently have

86 cases open on Key Activists and persons involved in foreign

influence in the New Left and are expanding the program as time

permits reviewof files and new material warrants their inclu

SiOn.

On 12/6/68 we held a conference with 12 SACs and their

supervisors at the Bureau.

The conference brought out the need

for concentration of efforts against Key Activists in the New

Left movement with emphasis on developing substantive violations,

local or federal, for which they can be prosecuted.

The shift

of the New beit to violence, including numerous instances of

bombing and

arson, was stressed, pointing out that this activity

lends itself to successful prosecution. Other worthwhile sugges

tions and recommendations were made and are under consideration.

For example, we have instituted, on a 90-day trial

basis, elimination of

followup- letterhead memoranda to initial

teletypes in routine demonstrations. Dissemination is being

handled by Xeroxing "clean" versions of the incoming teletype.

The expected savings in clerical and stenographic time in the

field will be tremendous.

Thus far, the change has caused no

problems and appears warranted. Appropriate recommendations

will be made at the end of the

90-day trial period.

In connection with New Left finances, we have opened

a case on the Louis M. Rabinorit Louncation which gave more

than $300,000 to various groups including New Left activists.

We are looking toward removal of their tax exempt status.

also opened

a case on "Resist," which is engaged in fund

raising

for New Left activities.

We have caused a survey to be made by Internal Revenue

Service (IRS) concerning Key Activists. We have found a number

returns.

This action is consistent with our efforts to obtain

prosecution of any kind against Key Activists to remove them

from the movement.

Foreign influence of the New Left movement offers us

a fertile field to develop valuable intelligence data.

To date

there is no real cohesiveness between international New Left

groups, but such an effort was initiated in september, 1960,

lat an International Student Conference at Columbia University.

This conference disclosed that despite the factionalism and

confusion now so prevelant, there is great potential for the

development of an international student revolutionary movement.

We are initiating

investigations aimed at identifying prominent

foreign New Left leaders and activists and to increase our reser-

voir

background information regarding foreign New Left organiza-

tions.

This also encompasses travel on the part of groups or

individuals either to or from the U.S., and will include inter-

national conferences.

We have taken over the supervision of sedition and

related cases involving antidraft activity, which centers mainly

around The Resistance.

We have received information indicating

extensive contacts and cooperation between Canadian antidraft

groups which openly and actively encourage draft evasion by

Americans: and many U. S. groups and individuals.

There are also

cancations of a clandestine escape route between the US. and

Available figures show there are in excess of 140 U.s.

deserters in Canada and

estimates of draft evaders run into the

thousands. In addition, the Army has advised that it expects

the full impact of the drafting of college graduates by the end

of 1969. By that time one in every five unlisted men will be

a college graduate and the Army anticipates a resulting increase

in agitation and subversion by individuals who became committed

to resistance while in college. The Army has recently compli-

mented us on our coverage in this field and asked for our continued

emphasis of these investigations.

Possibly the best utilization of manpower has been

that it enables us to afford close supervision to these cases.

Our expanded coverage has enabled us to afford intensified

investigative attention to the widespread and diverse activities

of the New Left in order to define the movement, penetrate it

and cope with it.

In addition, this unit has assumed overall responsibility

for immediate dissemination of information concerning campus

aisorders, including the activities of black student groups. This

problem is becoming increasingly important in its national scope.

Also, because many

sedition allegations arise from the activities

of New Left protest groups, these cases have been assigned to

this unit so they can be coordinated with the existing investiga-

tions.

The intensified coverage made possible by the additional

manpower is reflected

in the nearly tripled case load within four

months in this unit.

success of our expanded coverage to date warrants

establishing it on a permanent basis.

A review of the New Left

movement at this time does not disclose any indications of diminish

ing activity in the foreseeable future, but increase in violence

in demonstrations, particularly on campuses, and an increase in

terroristic tactics including bombings and arsons against the

U. S. Government.

Furthermore, it is apparent that the old-line communist

groups such as the Communist Party, USA, the Progressive Labor

Party, the Socialist Workers

Party, and

particularly its youth

affiliate, the Young Socialist Alliance are making a determined

effort to

move into the New Left movement to exert a greater

influence and control over its future activities.

More and

mOre

we see the New Left movement holding up as heroes international

communists such as

Fidel Castro, Ho Chi Minh, and Mao Tse-tung.

Hore and more we also see old-line leftist groups influencing

thinking of the New Left along Marxist lines

and giving direction

to attacks against the police in general and the FBI in particular.

to drive us off the campuses; as well as attacks against the new

administration to degrade President Nixon. We can expect this

activity to intensify greatly in the future.

This memorandum is to recommend that uncertified

copies of 1966 and 1967 Federal Income

Tax Returns filed by

additional Key Activists in the New Left be obtained from

Internal Revenue Service.

Following a request approved in my memorandum 5/23/68,

Internal Revenue Service furnished copies of Federal Income Tax

Returns for certain

Key Activists. For others, it was determined

that no returns had been filed and Internal Revenue Service has

initiated investigations.

We have recently expanded the Key Activist Program to

include additional individuals.

As a part of our over-all

intensive investigation designed to neutralize these individuals

in the New Left movement, inquiry into their financial status

has proven productive.

Information from their Federal Income

Tax Returns is of value and, in addition, Internal Revenue Service

action may be initiated where no return

is filed or a return is

filed showing only minimal income not in keeping with outlays

for travel and other activities.

Regarding Item 16 d, Part VII, of the August 20, 1975,

request, it is noted that the R.

W. Smith memorandum to

Mr. W. C. Sullivan, dated June 2, 1968, and captioned

"Martin Luther King, Jx., Request by President Lyndon B.

Johnson for Detailed File," in the first paragraph, refers to

a "memorandum of Mir. DeLoach, to Mx. folson, 5/24/68 same

title, which set forth the request of the

through Special Counsel Larry E. Temple, for all information

concerning King...

An exhaustive search of all logical files,

indices and abstracts has failed to locate this memorandum

dated May 24, 1968.

During the same meeting between Mr. Epstein and

representatives of the Intelligence Division of the FBI,

Mr, Epstein nodified Item 16 d. He advised that responses con~

ceming playing tapes or offers to play tapes, dissemination of

transcripts or offers to disseminate transcripts, be Limited

such actions regarding the White House or to persons outside

the Executive Branch rather than to persons not employed by.

elaboration of this problem in view of the instructions sent

to field offices in October, 1966, directing them to subnit

the names of all individuals whose voices have becn monitorec

through a microphone installed or a telephone surveillance

operated by the oftice anytime

since January one, one nine

six zero!"

To further elaborate on this particular Item and to

offer clarification, the following three factors are submitted:

Prior to issuing instructions to field offices in

October, 1966, directing them to submit the names of all indiv

iduals whose voices have been monitored through a microphone

installed or a telephone surveillance operated by the offices

anytime since 1/1/60, additional surveillances on which King

monitored are unaccountable for as these surveillance logs

have been destroyed.

2. Prios to the instructions, personnel handling

logs may have felt that overhears were of no substance of

significance and consequently were not recorded.

The setting up of the elsur indices was a field-

wide project of large proportions and the instzuctions going

to the Ejeld 10/5/60,

were subject to broad interpretacion,

thus leading to possible misinterpretation of these instructions.

Also, the factor of human error might be invoived, thereby

causing incomplete indices until the mechanics of the procedure

ware ironed out.

The above responses to Items? a and b were discussed

and agreed upon during the above-mentioned meeting between

Mr. Epstein and representatives of

the Intelligence Divisi0n

of the FBI.

With respect to Item 10 c, Part I, of the SSe reguest

dated Aupust 26, 1975, included in the material being delivered

with this memorandum are the only communications in IBI filcs

which we have been able to locate after an exhaustive file check.

It should be noted that memorandum of C. D. DeLoach

to Mr. Mohr dated December I, 1964, captioned "Ben

Buseau Chief

"Newsweek Magazino" Washington, D. G. "halee

is being delivered with this nemorandum refers to another

memorandum of Mr. Deloach, dated November 21, 1964, authorizing

DeLoach to furnish Bradice certain information on a contidential

basis at the time of his visit to fbile.

Search of appropriate

files at FBIHO failed to locate Deloach's memorandum dated

November 21, 1964.

With respect to the excisions in materials being

delivered herewith, where no notation appears as to reason

for excision, the excision was made for the ceason that the

information actually summarizes or quotes from conversations

monitored during electronic surveillances of King.

In some

it can be ascertained precisely what intornation in

EPr filos came from electronic surveillances of Dr. Kings

however, there exist areas where documentation of the intormation

is not precise and no accurate determination can be made.

Therefore, no assurances can be given that portions of the

material being furnished do not contain intormation developed

• as a result of electronic surveillances of King.

Upon delivery of material with this menorancum we

have fulfilled all requests concerning King contained in the

SSC requests of August 20, 1975, and August 20, 1973.

Pursuant to the Director's instructions I showed fl

Miss Gandy-

the attached report concerning the

JFK Law 10(a)1

to Walter Jenkins of the White House this morning at 11:00 a.m.

Jenkins read the entire report word for word. I told him that the Director thought

perhaps the President might like to know about this matter strictly in confidence..

Jenkins stated he would tell the President this afternoon about this incident. He

stated that it certainly opened his. eyes and he felt it was one of the most repulsive

incidents that he knew of. I told Jenkins that the Director indicated I should leave

this attachment with him if he desired to lei the President personally read it.

Jenkins mentioned that he was sufficiently aware of the facts that he could verbally

advise the President of the matter. Jenkins was of the opinion that the FBI could

perform a good service to the country if this matter could somehow be confidentially

given to members of the press. I told him the Director had this in mind, however,

falso believed we should obtain additional information prior to discussing it with

certain friends.

Our first request is for the opportunity to take a cover

picture in color of you at your convenience, and in whafever place

you may designate. Because of a long lag time between the taking

of the picture and the engraving, the sooner we could have this

appointment, the happier we would be.

Our second request -- this one probably directed to

WASHINGTON BUREAU CHEF-ACH 10D

'NEWSWEEK" MAGAZINE

WASHINGTON, D. C.

By letter dated 11-10-64 the captioned individual advised the Director that on

that date his publication was beginning to prepare a cover story on the Director and request-

ed the Director's indulgence and cooperation in this matter. While no definite date has

been arranged for the publication of the story, it is presently contemplated that it will be

published around the first of 1965 probably in connection with the Director's birthday.

Bradlee points out that the Director and the FBI have been such a major force in Americar

history for so many years that they really need no "peg." He requests the opportunity to

take a color picture of the Director for the magazine cover at the Director's convenience and

if the Director is agreeable, to do this as soon as possible due to the time lag involved in

the engraving. He also requests a series of interviews for Mr. Bill Gray whose assignment

it will be to get the most up-to-date picture of the Bureau's operations, techniques, ambitions:

and problems. He indicates this could be worked out with you (Mr. DeLoach). Bradlee also

anticipates an eventual request for an opportunity to talk with the Director in as much detail

as the Director will allow. Mr. Bradiee stated that he looks forward to seeing the Director

because in doing this cover story for the publication he wants it to be "flawless."

Your office has had generally friendly relations with Mr. Bradlee who has been

favorably disposed toward the Bureau. He has been with "Newsweek"' since 1954, about six

vears of this time in Paris, France. Before that he was a press attache at the American

Embassy in Paris, a reporter for "The Washington Post" newspaper here in Washington

and an office boy-librarian for Roger Baldwin, Director of the American Civil Liberties

Jnion in New York City. In 1951 he was the subject of a special inquiry - State Department

nvestigation conducted by this Bureau reflecting generally the foregoing information. In

¿951 his name came up on several occasions in connection with a leak of classified information

which appeared in a "Newsweek" magazine article. There was some indication that the

'Newsweek" story was an intentional leak of information by the Administration. It is noted

hat Mr. Bradlee was an extremely close associate of the tate

M. A. Jones to DeLoach

RE: BENJAMIN C. BRADLED

the owners of "The Washington Post'' newspaper.

We have had friendly relations with a

number of individuals connected with "Newsweek"' particularly Raymond Moley who is known

to the Director on a first-name basis. Over the years we have furnished some degree of

cooperation to "Newsweek" magazine. In years gone by we have had correspondence with

Malcolm Muir, former President of the publication pertaining to inaccurate information

concerning the Bureau which appeared in the "Periscope" section of the publication. Also,

in 1959 there was a typographical error in an article concerning "The FBI Story" movie for

which Mr. Muir apologized.

Mr. Bradlee mentioned that the story assignment would be given to Mr. Bill

Gray. Bradlee pointed out that Gray is comparatively new with "Newsweek" and was

formerly a reporter for the "St. Louis Post-Dispatch" in St. Louis. He also pointed out/

that Gray has had occasion to work with you (Mr. DeLoach) and other members of the Burea:

His dealings with your office gave every indication that he is favorably disposed toward the

Bureau and in 1962 the Director wrote the suburban news editor of the'St. Louis Post-Dis-

Patch" thanking him for the very favorable article prepared by William S./Gray entitled,

"Policemen of Many Communities Trained by FBI in Use of Arms." It is noted that the SAC

at St. Louis worked with Mr. Gray in preparation of this article and that Office had no

information of a derogatory nature concerning him at that time. Our relations have been

circumspect since 1940 with the'St. Louis Post-Dispatch' due to unfavorable stories; how-

ever from time to time certain representatives of its staff have prepared favorable stories

about FBI facilities.

OBSERVATION:

It would appear that we should cooperate with "Newsweek" in the preparation

of this article. Bradlee and Gray appear to be favorably disposed toward the Bureau and

have been friendly. In as much as the magazine plans to do this article on the Director any-

way we would gain nothing by not cooperating, and on the other hand through cooperation

we could perhaps exercise some degree of control over the article. You could go over this

matter with Bradlee and determine in detail just what he desires.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

I. That the Director approve cooperation with "Newsweek"' magazine in the

preparation of a cover story on the Director which that publication is already beginning to

prepare.

2. If the Director approves, you (Mr. DeLoach) should contact Mr. Bradlee

and work out with him the details of the matter, at the same time acknowledging Bradiee's

11-10-64 letter to the Director.

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED

DATE 16/00S DAMED

I called Ben Bradlee, Washington Bureau Chief, "Newsweek"' Magazine,

on Monday, 11/16/64, concerning his letter to the Director dated November 10th, in

which he requested cooperation regarding a cover story of the Director.

I told Mr. Bradlee that the Director appreciated his interest, and that

of "Newsweek," and that my call to him could be considered acknowledgment of his letter

of November 10, 1964. I told Mr. Bradlee that we have had some very unhappy

experiences with a small number of national publications who had professed great

admiration and affection, yet had then turned around and stabbed the FBI in the baci on a

very unjustifiable basis.

Bradlee replied that this was not his intentions. He stated.

that "Newsweek" would be very honest and aboveboard and would call the shots as they

saw them. He stated that he had every intention of completely honoring the Director's

birthday which would occur on January 1, 1965. He added that his reports would

be entirely objective.

Mr. Bradlee stated that he hoped he would have our cooperation. I

told him that the Director, of course, desires to be of assistance; however, it appeared

that "Newsweek"' had already started interviewing a large number of individuals through-

out the United States. I told Mr. Bradlee that we had heard from a number of former

Special Agents in Charge (Harvey Foster and Don Hostetter), as well as other individuals,

who had already been interviewed concerning the Director. Bradlee stated they perhaps

had jumped the gun on the basis the Director would have no objections to an article being

prepared.

EX-105

REC.g

Bradlee stated he wanted to reiterate once again that they were not trying

l'to do a hatchet job. He added that they planned to assign a reporter by the name of Gray

who is entirely favorable to the FBI. I told Mr. Bradlee that I kuf

it Grafiand would

be glad to see him at any time.

Mr. Bradlee stated he would appreciate the Director posing for a color

photograph as soon as conveniently possible. He stated this was thelusial irst step in

of "Newsweek." I told Mr. Bradlee I would check with the Dire ctor and would call him

back regarding this matter.

In the above connection, former SAC Hostetter called me from New

York this morning and stated he was to be interviewed this afternoon by Jay, Iselin of

"Newsweek." Iselin has advised Hostetter that he plans also to interview L. B. Nichol

Harvey Foster and Spencer,Drayton while in New York. Hostetter wanted to know if

it would be all right to be interviewed. He also wanted to know if there was any

particular point we wanted him to get across. I briefed him generally regarding this

matter. Hostetter told me that he had advised Iselin that he had the highest regard and

respect for the Director and the FBI and that if "Newsweek" planned to do a hatchet

job that they were wasting their time interviewing him (Hostetter). I thanked Hostetter

for his interest in this regard.

The Director may desire to indicate a time convenient to him when I

could bring a "Newsweek" photographer over to take the color shot in question.

REIN SECLASSIF!

Mr. Tolson has suggested that the "Newsweek" people consider usage of

the Autry color photograph of the Director rather than having one made for the cover of

Newsweek" magazine in comtection with their forthcoming feature story.

I discussed this matter with Ben Bradlee, Washington Bureau Chief,

"Newsweek, " on 11/19/64 and again on 11/20/64. Bradlee has now indicated that

"Newsweek" would appreciate having their own color photograph of the Director. They

stated that the Autry photograph, while good, is not the type photograph they want for

the cover of their publication.

Bradlee assures me that it will take only a few minutes

and as a matter of fact, he desires to come in personally with the photographer to make

certain that a good job is done. He mentioned that by him being allowed to shake hands

with the Director, and meet the Director personally, this will eliminate the necessity

of the Director being interviewed by a "Newsweek" reporter. He indicated they would

be in and out of the Director's Office in not more than 10 to 15 minutes.

ACTION:

I have advised Bradlee that the photographer can take this photograph

on Monday, November 23rd, at 10:00 a.M. This was in accord with the Director's

instructions on my memorandum of November 17th (attached). I did not tell Bradlee

that he could come in with the photographer, however, will do so if the Director has

no objections.

Bradlee's suggestion to bring along Martin appears to be a move to

The Director approved my memo of Saturday, 11/21/64, that I

confidentially advise BenBradlee, Bureau Chief, "Newsweek" Magazine, Washington,,

Pace, that we could not honor his request to bring his New York writer, Dwight Martin,

in to see the Director on Monday morning, 11/43/64. Reterenced memo set forth con-

• siderable derogatory information concerning Martin's wife, who, according to State

Department, and Army intormation, associated considerady with unlese communists

and participated in running a Chinese brothel

It was recommended and approved tratT

advise Bradlee, upon his visit to FBI Headquarters, of this information on a stricti • off-

the-record basis.

Bradlee was advised of the above information upon his visit to FBI Head-

quarters 11/23/64; he stated he would keep this strictly off-the-record and that we could

trust him implicitly in this regard.

Bill Moyers, while I was at the White House today, advised that word

had gotten to the President this afternoon that Bradlee was telling all over town that the

FBI had given him considerable information concerning the wife of a "Newsweek" writer.

Bradlee was also telling around Washington that the FBI had told him that Martin Luther

King was a sexual degenerate. Bradlee, according to Moyers, had stated to several

pedoubteat,

"If the FBI will do this to Dwight Martin and Martin Luther King, they will

undoubtedly do it to anyone for personal reasons."

Moyers stated the President wanted to get this word to us so we would

know not to trust Bradlee. Moyers also stated that the President felt that Bradlee lacked

integrity and was certainly no lover of the Johnson Administration or the FBI. - I told

Moyers this was certainly obvious.

The foregoing facts certainly indicate on a positivelasts the lack of

truthfulness and integrity in the "Newsweek" bunch.

"NEWSWEEK" CRITICISM OF DIRECTOR AND FBI

In connection with captioned matter, "Editor and Publisher," in the issue

of 12-12-64, has identified William Gray and Jay Iselin as the two representatives who

obtained the background information at FBI Headquarters upon which the captioned story

was based. It was also indicated that Dwight Martin and Lester Berns were responsible

for rewriting the story. The Director has asked for a check of our files concerning

William Gray, Jay Iselin, Dwight Martin and Lester Berns.

Iselin was informing the Bureau what he knew about Buchanan and Buchanan's contact

with Deputy Attorney General Katzenbach who apparently was feeding Buchanan some

erroneous statements about Oswald and Ruby.

In February, 1964, Iselin contacted the Bureau regarding a statement by

Attorney Edward Bennett Williams to the effect that Federal agencies had been conducti: :

In connection with the "Newsweek" story earlier this month on the Director,

former SAC Harvey. Foster had been contacted by Iselin for some of Foster's views when

he was with the FBI. Foster gained the impression that Iselin was objective, fair and high-

minded and appeared to be interested in doing a factual,objective story on*the Director and

the FBI.

Lester Berns:

We have no record in Bureau files on Berns; however, a check of the "News-

week" masthead' reveals that Lester Bernstein is one of its Senior Editors. We have

never conducie an investigation of him and our contacts with him have been limited. He

was given a tour of FBI facilities on 3-26-63, while accompanied by his two sons, at

which time Bernstein was identified as National Sales Editor of "Newsweek." The tour

was arranged by "Newsweek's" Washington office. Bernstein wrote Mr. DeLoach a very

cordial letter for the courtesies extended on the tour, which was acknowledged by the

Director by letter dated 4-10-63. The New York Office contacted Bernstein in July, 1964,

in connection with the diary of Oswald being leaked to certain news media. Bernstein was

cooperative during this contact.

Bufiles reveal that we have never investigated this individual. Pricto his

assignment with "Newsweek," he was a reporter for the "St. Louis Post-Dispatch. " He

has always been very cordial in connection with his contacts with the Bureau, and in 1962,

the Director wrote the Suburban News Editor of the'St. Louis Post-Dispatch" thanking him

for the very favorable article prepared by Gray entitled "Policemen of Many Communities

Trained By FBI in Use of Arms." Gray was the individual who did most of the leg work

here at FBI Headquarters in connection with the "Newsweek" article; however, it is under-

stood that most of his copy was eliminated from the final draft prepared by the higher-ups

on the Editorial Staff of "Newsweek."

Newsweek's Editor

Osborn

Elliott,

editor

of

Newsweek, is standing pat on

the story

the magazine può-

lished

Dec. " that President

Johnson has decided he must

find a new chief of the FBI to

replace J. Edgar Hoover.

The editor's stand

is in the

. face of a White House denial

and a charge by Clyde Tolson,

FBI Associate Director, that.

the magazine's cover story on

his boss represents

"a new low

in reporting."

Mr. Elliott told E&P: "It is

the kind of a story you expect

, will be denied. It is part of the

game.

No Reason to Retract

"Our information from the

White House came from such a.

reliable source we see no reason

•to retract."

Newsweek's Washington Bu-

reau Chief, Ben Bradlee, added

that "sometimes you are so far

ahead of a story that you can

be denied.

There can

be some

truth in the denial without less

truth in the original statement."

Stating "a search was on" for

a successor to Mr. Hoover, the

magazine reported it would be

a difficult job to find the right

person. It was generally agreed

by those close to the story that

its publication

probably

has

prolonged Mr. Hoover's tenure.

As to Mr. Tolson's criticism,

Mr. Elliott said: "This story

for us represented perhaps a

new high in the number of pea

ple interviewed

for a cover

story, the number of crackpot

critics of the FBI ignored, and

the amount of legitimate criti-

cism checked with FBI sources."

Mr. Elliott produced the file

of information dug up by News-

week reporters from which the

final piece was written. It was

five inches.thick and a conserva-

tive estimate of the number of

•words was between 100,000 and

150,000. The printed story ran

15,500 words.

- ayllery About Letter =3

How the letter from Mr. Tol-

son became public has elements

of mystery surrounding it. Mr.

Elliott said it was his policy not

to make public the contents of

a letter of this sort.

Cartha D: DeLoach, Assistant

Director at FBI headquarters,

said an Associated Press report-

er told him that a Charlotte,

N. C., radio station was claim-

mian-acked the FBI to mole the

contents public.

Mr. DeLoach

said he told the reporter he

should ask Mr. Elliott to re

lease it.

Then, he said, the AP

sent a man to his office, who

by quoting parts of the letter

convinced him that it was in

somebody's hands,

and

conse-

quently he gave him a copy.

This was on Sunday, Dec. 6.

AP then contacted Mr. Elliott

at his New York home.

He

didn't have a copy there of his

reply to Mr. Tolson, but said

that in it he said the magazine

was still standing by its story.

He also conceded that News-

week "seems to be in error

concerning the letter that we

understood that was not sent to

Robert Kennedy," sympathizing

with him

on the assassination

of his brother.

A copy of Mr.

Hoover's letter to the then At-

torney General

was unearthed

after a search promoted by the

Mr. Deloach said he wel-

Mr. Elliott said that the story

was originally scheduled to ap-.

pear in January to

coincide

with Mr. Hoover's 70th birth-

day.

Timing Changed

"Then a rush of events caused

us to change our timing," he

said.

"First came the Warren

Commission's

FBI's role in events preceding

the assassination of President

Kennedy. Then came the FBI's

leak of Hoover's testimony to

the commission. Finally,

there

was the extraordinary inter-

view with newspaper women

during which Hoover called

Martin Luther King, 'the most

notorious liar in the land.'

"Our exhaustive research was

well under way so we advanced

our schedule. We published the

facts in the full expectation

that they would be denied by

the White House as well as the

FBI. And so they were. How

could the FBI be expected to

do anything else?

And how,:

ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

6076

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED

WEREIN IS UNCLASSIFIED

MUTT2-2081 BYSS40MI

Reference is made to may letter dated June 23, 1975,

enclosing a memorandum of the same date responding to a request

from the Senate Select Committee dated May 14, 1975, for certain

documents and other information from the FBI.

In the appendices to reierenced letter of May 14, 1975,

the Senate Select Committce requested a list of Cointelpro-type activ-

ity effected subsequent to April 28, 1971. In connection with that

request, we did review our files and contacted knowledgeable person-

nel of the Intelligence Division and, by memorandum dated June 23,

1975, we advised of our inability to locate any information indicating

authorization of any Cointelpro-type activity after April 28, 1971.

However, during our subsequent reviews of documents relating to

other requests of the Senate Select Committee, we have located two

documents requesting actions which were authorized and which possi-

bly could be construed as falling within the category of "Cointelpro-

type activity. " Both of these actions were authorized by former

Director J. Edgar Hoover in February of 1972, but they were not

authorized under the then discontinued Counterintelligence Program,

nor were copies of the documents in these matters included in the

Cointelpro files.

62-1145

đ1, GeT 1G 1918

As you can see from the enclosure, one activity related

to the suggestion to an editor of a Florida newspaper to write an E

article on the United Ilans of America, Inc., and the other concerned

the anonymous mailing of a newspaper clipping to the Black Panther

Party Office in New York. Whether or not these actions can be con-

strued or interpreted as "Cointelpro-type activity" may be arguable,

put in the interest of keeping you fully informed I am bringing these

inalters to your attention.

Reference is made to this Bureau's memorandum dated

June 28,

1975, responding to memorandum from captioned Committee

dated May 14,

1975, and the appendices thereto, which requested

information from the FBI. Itera 20, Part 2, Appendix C, of the letter

requested a list of Cointelpro-type activity effected subsequent to

April 28, 1971. This Bureau's memorandum dated June 23, 1975,

advised a review of files and contact with Intelligence Division per-

sonnel had failed to develop any information indicating Cointelpro-

type activity since April 28, 1971.

In our review of documents in connection with requests

by the Senate Select Committee, two documents have been located

which authorize actions which could be construed as Cointelpro-type

operations. These communications were dated subsequent io the

discontinuance of the programs in 1971. These are as follows:

1. On February 18, 1972, FBI Headquariers (FBIQ)

responded to a request by the Miami Field Office, authorizing contact

with an editor of the "Fort Lauderdale News, " to suggest he consider

causing the interview by reporters of members of the United Klans of

America, Inc,, for the purpose of developing information which would

be the basis for a newspaper article. The editor was furnished infor-

mation regarding Elan use of the polygraph to "weed out FBIinformants.""

Documents Pertaining to the "Huston Plan,"

Cointelpro, and Other Practices and Frograms

Subsequent publication of the Klan's activities resulted in a number

of Klan officials ceasing their activities, and no information was

developed indicating the Klan was able to expose informants through

the use of the polygraph.

2. On February 29, 1972, FBIHQ responded to a

request of the Louisville Field Ottice, authorizing an anonymous

letter be forwarded to a Black Panther Party (SPP) office in

New York City. This anonymous letter contained a newspaper clip-

ping discroditing one Benjamin Franklin Simmons, a black estremist

endeavoring to affiliate with the Cleaver Faction of the BPP. Subse-

quently it was determined that "seeds of doubt"' concerning Simmons'

leadership qualities had been planted at the Cleaver Faction

Headquarters.

Information relating to the above proposals and

authorizations did not appear in any Cointelpro-type file of this

Bureau. The proposals and authorizations were handled in substan-

tive organizational and individual files, and no copies were placed

into a Cointelpro file. The FBI COmmunications approving the two

actions were reviewed by various officials at FBIIQ. Office proce

dures in effect in Director J. Edgar Hoover's office at the time

indicate both proposals were approved by Vir. Hoover,

NOTE:

See letter to the Attorney General dated 9/24/75,

captioned "United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence

Activities, " prepared by DR:lij.

Information relating to the above-described Cointelpro

action was initially located on pages 154 and 159 of the Domestic

Intelligence Division Inspection Report of August, 1972. Based on

the information appearing in the Inspection Feport, the original

Miami teletype dated 2/16/72 and the FBIHQ authorizing teletype

dated 2/18/72, both captioned "United Klans of America, Inc., "

were located in Bureau file 157-370-29-365. The original Louisville

airtel dated 2/16/72 and the FBIHQ authorizing communication dated

2/29/72, both containing the dual caption "Black Committee for Self-

Defense," and "Benjamin Franklin Simmons, " were located in Bureau

file 157-24412-8.

The above referred-to authorizing documents were

reviewed by Miss Ruth McCord of the Director's office on 9/15/75

and she advised that according to the office procedures in effect in

1912 both the approving documents had been reviewed and signed

out of FBIHQ by Director Hoover.

5. Letter from I. Edgar Hoover, Director, FBI, to

Commissioner, Internal Revenue Service, dated October 23, 1956,

captioned "Communist Party, USA, Underground Operations. "

Attached to this letter is an enclosure of the same date entitled

"Individuals Reportedly Active in Communist Party, USA, Under-

ground Sometime During 1951-1955."

Although appropriate excisions have been made in the

above documents in the interest of protecting classified national secu-

rity information, no deletions have been made to protect the personal

privacy of individuals named therein. In this regard, it is noted the

letter to Assistant Attorney General William F. Tompkins dated

August 29, 1956, and the enclosure to the letter to the Commissioner,

Internal Revenue Service, dated October 23, 1956, contain names of

Communist Party members who were reportedly active in the Party

underground during the period 1951-1955. It should be noted many

of these individuals have discontinued their Communist Party activi-

ties. This Bureau recommends, in the event these documents are

subject to public disclosure, all names of individuals mentioned

therein be excised.

The portion of the transcript of former FBI Director

Hoover's briefing of the National Security Council presided over by

the President, dated November &, 1973, which was enclosed with

the SSC letter, has been declassified.

CONTI

Reference is made io your memorandum of August 29, 1956

relative to the furnishing of names to the Internal Revenue Service

01. Communisi Paruy functionaries who, because of their activity

an the conmunast underground apparatus, may have failed to file

income tas returns in accordance with the laws of the United States.

This Division is of the opinion that the furnishing by

the bureau to the Internal Revenue Service of the names of the

Communist Party leaders as set forth in your referenced monorandum

would have no detrimental effect upon the enforcement of the

internal, security laws.

However, it should be pointed out to

the internal Revenuo Semice that no affirmative action should be

taken by that Service against the eight individuals listed in

your memorandum (manuel Blum, Sidney Resnick, Edward Bugene Strong,

Max Morris Weiss, Geolitey Warner white, sidney liphires, lichae.

Russo and Laniel Boone Schirmer who have been indicted and arrested

for violation of the smith Act and are presently availing trial.

Before the Internal Revenue Service should take any action

with respect to any of the aforementioned eight individuals, this

Division should be consulted for the purpose of determining whether

the contemplated action would in any way prejudice the pending

Smith Act prosecution involving those individuals.
