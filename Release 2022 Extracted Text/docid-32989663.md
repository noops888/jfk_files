MORE OF THE TYPE IN WHICH HE WAS INTERESTED.

Stewart, Wallach in so many words, said that he felt that if { '
Justice was paying, there could be a conflict of interest. tj
Hollabaugh refused to respond to Wallach's inquiry. Wallach ‘foe
panel he thought he might call Hollabaugh and put him under

during the interview but that the FBI could not provide hin
with private counsel. He was advised that he was released from
his employment agreement relating to confidentiality for the
purpose of answering questions concerning mail openings. He
was also advised that the Department of Justicé was inthe
process of determining whether there may have been criminal

It was pointed out to Stewart that any statement he gives to the
SSC could be used against him if the Department of Justice

j it could demand he answer questions and that, absent such a
: subpoena, he was not. compelled to submit to an interview.

dp adiv. tequested in writing to the FBI that an attorney be appointed

Subject: Interview with Staff Member
of Senate Select Intelligence Committee
re Bureau Informant 200

At the invitation of Senate Select Intelligence
Committee Counsel James Dick, I reviewed several Bureau
Informant 200 memos taken from the Bureau's control file on
that matter. This revlew took place at Dick's office in the
New Senate Bldg. on the morning of Oct 1, 1975. I was
accompanied by my counsels Marcus A. Hollabaugh and Howard Fogt
of the firm of Foley, Lardner, Hollabaugh and Jacobs.
Mr. Hollabaugh is an X-FBI agent (1943-45).

After the above review, we returned to the law firm's
offices at 815 Connecticut Ave., N. W., Washington, D. C.. for
a discussion on how to proceed. Since we had been advised
that the Justice Dept was considering the matter involved with
Bureau Informant 200 for possible prosecution we considered
asking for immunity for me at the scheduled interview at 2 PM
om Oct. 1, 1975.

We again reported to the Committee's offices in the
new Senate Bldg. at 2 PM for the scheduled interview. We dis-
cussed immunity with Senate Counsel Dick and he said to date
no one had been granted same and only a few CIA employees had
ever made the request. By pre-planned strategy we decided if
immunity not readily possible, we would proceed with the inter-
view and, if necessary, invoke the 5th Amendment at a time a
question might tend to be incriminating. This never had to be
done.

Res Interview of Former FBI Special Agent (SA)
W. Donald Stewart by SSC Staff Member

Prior to the interview it was necessary for myself,
counsels, the Senate Counsel and the courtroom reporter
ta go to the office of Senator Charles Mc G. Mathias, Jr.,
(Md. ) in the Russell Bldg, to get me sworn by him. We there-
after adjourned to Reom 608 in the Carroll Arms for the inter-
view which began at 2:30 p.m. and terminated at 5:40 p.m

During the interview I was questioned about the origin
of the Hunter Project (Bureau Informant 200); mechanics of
handling the mail; whether the illegality of the project was
eonsidered or discussed at the Bureau and did Mr. Hoover know
of the program. In regard te the latter, I advised the
illegality was never a topic of discussion because it was not
our program and we were only the recipients of CIA's product.

We discussed the safeguarding of the matevial which I advised
was kept in a special mailroom and the entire program was
elosely held. I informed that I doubted if Mr. Hoover was aware
of the project and really had no reason to know. I advised that
we developed criteria in regard to material which was furnished
to us and made it clear to Mr. Dick that we were not engaged

in a "fishing expedition” and did not desire any mail not having
a specific intelligence interest to us as outlined by our
exiteria passed to CIA,

Mr. Dick asked several questions on the CIA Watch
List ~ how we added and deleted names. He had some misimpres~-
sions of the Watch List which I believe I corrected.

He was interested in the volume of mail received and
when it increased. He wondered whether we had an inspector
named “Vince.” This developed as a result of Hunter mail being:
identified in some instances as "Hunter - Don" (Moore) and
other “Hunter - Vince." Don Moore had been interviewed for
four hours during the morning of Oct 1, 1975. I advised "Vince"
was Vince Nasca who handled Cuban matters and mail reflecting
Guban activity or from a Cuban in the U. S. to one ox anyone
im the USSR and vice-versa was automatically routed to Nasca
at that time. To simplify routing, all such mail was designated
“Hunter - Vince."

Re: Interview of Former FBI Special Agent (SA)
W. Donald Stewart by SSC Staff Member

Mr. Dick did not attempt to be devious at any time,
and we had no points on which he did not seem to be satisfied
with my explanation. For the most part, he handed me a Bureau
Informant memo - 9 exhibits ~ and he discussed particular
points contained therein. No great relevations were developed
by him. My interview seemed mainly to provide some clarification
of how the Bureau Informant 200 program operated, Most of the
information he probably became aware of just by reviewing all
the memos in his possession,

Dick was concerned whether the Justice Dept was aware
of Bureau Informant 200. I said "No," no reason to tell Justice
as it was an operational matter within the FBI and the fruits
were not used for any prosecution purposes ~ only for lead
purposes. He hammered away on use and dissemination of
materials. I informed him any data disseminated in a Bureau
report was set out in a paraphrased form which did not disclose
the source of the information.

All questions re CIA's operation were pared with
"T don’t know" -

Dick did not make any effort to go astray from the
Bureau Informant 200 matter.

W. Donald Stewart

Addendun

Mr, Dick advised that transcripts would be available
to my counsels in one week, and the transcript would be Top
Secret. How the hell they classify Top Secret escapes me with
my knowledge of the classification law. Further - none of the
Bureau Informant 200 documents bear any classification and
therefore Dick just advised that the Bureau said they should be
treated Top Secret. ~ If the documents got side tracked and ended

up fa print in the newspapers, the Bureau wouldn't have any
kick coming as they bear no classification. And lastly, if
transcripts are going to be Top Secret and are té be given to
the counsels for storage in their office area then someone
kmows something I don't know about requirements for TS storage,
And lastly, lastly, how do you wave a wand and bestow a TS
clearance or two counsels whose names you only know. Some
food fer thought. WDS

Attention is invited to the information in the Ad-
dendum above wherein it is reported that the SSC intends to
classify the transcript of the interview "Top Secret."
According to Executive Order 11652, authority to classify is
vested within the executive branch of the Government and there
is no provision or other procedure known to the PBI whereby
the legislative branch may classify documents.

RE: | REQUEST FOR STATEMENT FROM FBI SETTING FORTH THE REASONS u)
FOR INCLUDING CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS ON
} THE NATLONAL SECURITY AGENCY (NSA) "WATCIL LIST" DATED
OCTOBER G, 1975

A review of FBI files concerning the above (u
individuals and organization discloses tho following: CX)

By teletype dated December 24, 1970, from the
Director, FBI, to the Director, NSA, NSA was requested to
furnish any information they might be able to develop
concerning the activities of Grover C. McArthur abroad.

NSA was advised McArthur, at that time, was a student at

the University of Pennsylvania and was planning to write a
paper on the Black Panther Farty (BPP) and its international
operations. NSA was further advised McArthur planned to contact
BPP offices overseas and he reportedly was to travel to Algiers,
Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Spain, France and Morocco. In view
of tho possibility of his contacting BFP membors overseas,

sonc of whom wore fugitives, we requested NCA's assistance.

It is noted that there were a number of black extremist

fugitives in 1970 affiliated with the BPP and they were charged cy)
with such crimes as attempted murder and conspixacy to murder.

Donaid L. Cox and Leroy Hldridge Cleaver, BPP leaders and OX
fugitives amongst others, were suspected of residing in
Algiers and Northern Europe.

By letter dated March 9, 1971, from John Edgar Hoover,
Director, FBI, to the Director of the NSA, NSA was furnished a
list of organizations in which we had an interest at that time
and NSA was xvequested to furnish any pertinent information
coming to NSA's attention concerning thoso groups. Included
on the list of organizations was the Black Student Union (BSU),
University of South (not Southern) Alabama, Room 14, Faculty
Court West, University Campus, Mobile, Alabama. <A yveview of
oux Liles discloses the BSU was oxganized in Nobile, Alabaina,
in October, 1970. On October 28, 1970, an issue of the "Black
Guard" published by the BSU and Community News Service was
issued. The editor was listed as Jimay Jones and all
individuals Wishing to communicate with the “Black Guard’ were
vequested to forward such communications to the Univorsity of
South Alabama, Faculty Court West, Room 14, tho address of
the BSU. In this publication, there were statements by
Eldridge Cleaver and Hucy P. Newton. This same issue containod

a lead articie which stated the BSU attended a conference,

in New Orleans, of the Deep South Radical Organizing
Committee, the purpose of which conference was stated in a
leaflet announcing it, as “to organize area wide action, to
find a basis of céoperation among ourselves, and to expand
and build a base on which to actuate tha revolution. OK) ud)

In addition to the above, FBI investigation was
based on BSU possible affiliation with black extremists
Eldridge Cleaver and Huey P. Newton. OX)(

By letter dated October 18, 1971, from John Edgar
Hoover, Director, FBI, to the Director of the NSA, we furnished
to NSA a list of organizations and individuals in which we had
an interest at that time in view of our responsibilities with
regard to individuals and organizations engaged in subversive
activities. Included on the list furnished to NSA was
Roy Innis, New York, New York. A review of our files
discloses that Roy Innis, Associate National Director of
the Congress of Racial Equality, had been described as a
militant Negro leader and a guest speaker at meetings of
militant Negro organizations who stated publicly that Negro
children must be taught to riot and that adult Negroes P)
must educate themselves in actual combat tactics and methods, (o-61¢

A review of pertinent FBI files concerning Muhammad
Ali (also known as Cassius Clay), Richard Gregory and James
Forman failed to reveal any documentation as to why these
individuals were included on the NSA “watch list." In
addition no reference is made in FBI files as to what time
frame they were on the NSA “watch list." Set forth below
are the reasons why these individuals were under investigation

the Islamic faith which in the past has advocated a total
separation of the races. The FBI investigation of the NOL
was at the direction of the U,.S. Department of Justice for
the purpose of collecting intélligence information the
Executive Branch needs to properly and adequately protect
the nation’s security and to @hforce numerous statutes
pertaining thereto; because its reported activities appear
to come within criteria of Executive Order 10450; and because
its activities may involve violations of Title 18, U. S. Code,
Sections 2101 and 2102 (Riots).

Richard Gregory

Richard Gregory is a nationally lmown comedian
and was a civil rights- activist involved in opposition to
United States policy in Vietnam. FBI files disclose we
instituted investigation of Gregory in 1968, through
established sources only, as he advocated paralyzing the
United States economy in order to stop the Vietnam War.
Active investigation was initiated on January 21, 1972, to
determine the nature and purpose of his contacts with Chinese
Communists and North Vietnamese. Invagtigation was :
discontinued in December, 1972. ti)

-- On-September 11, 1975, Unit Chief James P. Lee ze
and I met with Senate Select Committee Staff personnel

James Dick, Joseph Denin, and Paul Wallach. The purpose

for the meeting was to provide a further briefing on the fal

Bureau's mail intercept surveys,

At the outset, Mr. Wallach stated that they had
the opportunity to review the written material furnished
by the Bureau relative to policy matters pertaining to the
mail intercept surveys. Therefore, they were interested in
asking questions concerning the Bureau's mail intercept surveys.
At the same time, however, Mr. Wallach emphasized that we were
not to interpret this as an interview but rather as a continuation

of the initial briefing. 7 aint
With respect to the CIA's Hunter Program, the Senate f J

Staff personnel were mainly interested in how the Hunter ~ awe

material was received at the Bureau, how it was acted on, and

how it was maintained, They were also interested in criteria

employed for placing a name on the Watch List which was given

to the CIA, We reviewed for the Senate Select personnel _t) i"
other Bureau mail surveys, including "Sam," Fue," "Sun ,"]
"Joe," "Chiprop," "Chiclet," "Z Coverage," and "Chican.*” They
indicated surprise that they had only been furnished one serial
pertaining to "Z Coverage" and this serial neither authorized
its origin or ordered its termination. It was explained to

them that there was an obvious lack of paper concerning the

Memorandum from Mr, W. A, Branigan to Mr, W. R, Wannail
RE; SENSTUDY

The Senate Select personnel inquired how the programs
were terminated by Mr. Hoover and expressed surprise that no
written communication had been directed to our field offices,
Senate Select personnel also inquired whether there might be
other mail intercept programs which were conducted in the
investigation of criminal matters, They indicated that a
specific request would be forthcoming from the Committee
addressed to this aspect,

During the briefing, Mr, Wallach mentioned that
within the past three to six months he had occasion to be in
the New York Post Office Building, In attempting to leave the
building, he accidentally came upon some individuals who were
photographing the outside of envelopes, Mr, Wallach advised
that he was informed that the individuals were Bureau personnel
who were engaged in a particularly sensitive mail cover,
Wallach noted that this situation was not covered in the Bureau's
answer to the Senate Select Committee communication although
our answer did state with respect to mail covers that the
Bureau was continuing to check,

In approximately June, 1975, a Postal Service official
advised that one of our Agents had received permission to
photograph the outside of an individual's letters addressed to
the People's Republic of China United Nations Mission. When
notified of this, the New York Office was instructed to have
the Agent refrain from further activity along this line,

At the conclusion of the briefing, the Senate Select
Committee personnel indicated that they were aware that the
Bureau's files on Jane Fonda contained a letter that she had
written in Los Angeles to an unknown address in Paris, France,
The Senate personnel indicated that this occurred toward the
end of 1971 which was well beyond the termination of our mail
intercept surveys and the interception of such a letter would
not have fallen within the purview of the CIA's Hunter Project.
Mr, Wallach stated that the Bureau would receive a request
inquiring as to this and other letters which might appear in
the Jane Fonda investigation,

Reference is made to Part I, Item 2, of the
august 26, 1975, request by the SSC for access to screen
for delivery certain materials pertaining to National
Security Agency (NSA) Watch List activity.

Items 2a, b, c, d, e, g, h, j and k requested
Lists ox documents regarding requests by the FBI for the
inclusion on the NSA Watch List of the names of various
individuals. A review of FBI records which might have
included the requested documents did not locate any of the
foregoing. With regard to the requests for Lists sent
by the FBE to the NSA and the “Bureau's Watch List" as of
1 specified past dates, the following information, which may
explain their absence from FEI files, is offered for your
assistance.

The NSA Watch List was not an FBI program.

Accordingly, no separate file was maintained on the Watch

List. Neither was any centralized record of additions to

or deletions from the Watch List maintained. There was no

eperational need for the FBI to maintain in its permanent

files copies of the Watch List as of any given date because
Assoc. dr... -« the complete Watch List could be obtained anytime it might
ae ein be needed by requesting the current list from NSA.

9/12/75, reported on briefing of Senate Select Committee (ssc) &. ake
staff personnel by SAs J.P. Lee and W.A. Branigan. During the i)
course of the briefing, one of these individuals, Paul Wallach,
mentioned that within the past three to six months, while in
the New York Post Office Building, he accidentally came upon
some individuals photographing the outsides of envelopes.
Wallach said he was informed that these individuals were Bureau
personnel engaged in a sensitive mail cover, He noted this
situation was not covered in the Bureau's answer to the SSC,
although the Bureau did state, with respect to mail covers,
we were continuing to check. af

With regard to the above, New York Office (NYO) y
currently operates two authorized mail covers on the People's:
Republic of China Mission to the United Nations (PRCMUN).

One of these involves incoming mail and the other, outgoing
mail.

In approximately June, 1975, the Bureau liaison
officer in contact with the U.S. Postal Service officials,

Memorandum to Mr. W.R. Wannall
SENSTUDY 75

SA Morgan contacted Supervisor K.R. Buckman,
New York Office, by secure telephone at which time SA Buckman
acknowledged that an SA had been photographing envelopes at
the New York Post Office in one particular unknown subject
case involving the mailing of bulky envelopes to a military
man at the PRCMUN/*BifTiadelphia, Pennsylvania. This was being
done in order to assist the Philadelphia Office in identifying
the unknown subject, as the bulky envelopes would not fit
the normal camera used for photographing of envelopes by Postal
Service employees and required a special camera, Supervisor
Buckman advised that the SA was on annual leave at that time
and he felt sure the camera had been removed from Post Office
premises, He was instructed to have the camera removed
immediately, if not previously done, and was told to have the
SA cease and desist in the above activity. SA Buckman advised
he would comply with these instructions. He was informed of
the offer made by the Postal Service to photograph above
envelopes if it was felt necessary in the future. Arrangements
for this would be made through FBIHQ, and no subsequent requests
have been received from the New York Office in this regard. No
written instructions concerning the above were furnished to the
New York Office.

None. For information.

Enclosed are declassified White House memo- \

and August.5, 1970, respectively, which relate to the cee \
so. called Huston: “Plan, and which were released by
Chairman Church ‘to the press at captioned hearings.

Tom Charles. Huston, former Associate Counsel
to and former Staff Assistant to President Nixon, fur-
nished testimony on the establishment of the ad hoc
Interagency Committee on Intelligence in July, 1970,
under the chairmanship of Director. Hoover. . He described
former Assistant Director William Sullivan as. chairman
of the so. called working study group within the ad hoc
Committee which had convened three ‘or four meetings in
Mr.. Hoover's FBI Office in June, 1970. Also present
during these meetings was Charles D. Brennan, former
Assistant Director.

When questioned by Senator Church as to why
the ad hoc Committee final report thad not been presented
to Mr. Hoover for his approval until CIA, DIA and the
other Committee members. had signified their approval,
Mr. Huston testified Messrs. Sullivan and Brennan felt
“this procedure was necessary in order to ‘force’ Mr.. Hoover's
acquiescence and for added impact to resolve Mr.. Hoover's
reluctance to participate in the Plan.'

Mr. Huston's. testimony. underscored previous
public testimony by CIA Director Helms to the effect -

Memorandum to Mr. Adams from Legal Counsel
Re: . HUSTON: PLAN PUBLIC. HEARINGS ,

. He testified Mr. Sullivan had recommended en-
dorsement of the final ad hoc Committee report to Mr.
Hoover and urged cooperation among the intelligence
agencies "so that we can overcome past differences."

Following Mr. Hoover's rejection of the ad hoc
report, Mr. Huston testified he. had submitted a memoran-
jdum to Mr. Robert Haldefman , former counsellor to Presidert
Nixon, which recommended further pressure ‘be. brought to
bear on Mr. Hoover to agree with the plan. ‘See attached
memorandum dated August.'5, 1970.

Chairman Church and Senator Howard Baker of
Tennessee, summarized their impression that although
FBI, CIA, DIA, etc., had’ been engaged in mail openings,
surreptitious. entries, and electronic surveillance for a
number of yedrs prior to the ad hoc Committee establish-
ent, President Nixon and his predecessors. had been un-
aware ‘of details of these illegal activities and that the
ad hoe report ‘sought Presidential "legitimization" for
them. Additionally, President Nixon also had been un-
aware the CIA had been involved in domestic intelligence
such ‘as Agency operation CHAOS, and DIA involvement ‘in
the domestic intelligence field, ete. In short ‘each of
the ‘intelligence agencies were "doing their own thing" with
: no fear of accountability. Endemic to the failure of the
| so. called "Huston Plan" was Mr. Hoover's refusal to par-
ticipate in it because of his question regarding the legality
of expansion of mail cover operations.

At ‘the suggestion of Chairman Church, Huston
recommended the ‘abolishmerit of our Internal Security
Division as an intefgral part ‘of FBI operations. citing
what. he terms our Wimited analysis capability in the

domestic intelligence field. Similar observations. had
|Jbeen made to Mr. Huston by former. Assistant Director
Sullivan during the existence of the ad hoc Committee in
.)1970, and had been indicated, in Huston's mind, by Director
{Hoover's previous. unilateral decision to curtail liaison
activities with CIA. . However, Mr.. Huston did not cite
specific examples of our shortcomings in this area, if
any.

Re: interview of SA DOUGLAS HAC DOUGALE

by SSC members

On September 9, 1975, SA DOUGIAS HAC DCUGALL was
interviewed from 10:00 AH to 11:25 AM by JAMES DICK and
PAUL WALLACH of the SSC. WALLACH left the interview at
approximately 10:45 AM,

While walking to,the interview room, WALLACH asked

“off the record, how do the men in the field fesi about the
SSC investigation". SA MAC DOUGALL told WALLACH that on or
eff the record the Agents were unanimously afraid of the results
of the investigation, For years we have been successful mainly
because we were trusted, Information given to us was held in
confidence. Now that the Senate has access to a great deal of.
elassigied information whe knows what will happen. WALLACH
was asked if he would like te furnish information te the FBI

: in confidence after he read other classified information,

u obviously leaked by someone, printed in the New York Times

A for example, WALLACH did not pursue the discussion.

DICK told SA MAC DOUGALL that he had the right to nave
an attorney present; that he can terminate the interview at
will and can decline to answer questions, No form was submitted
for S& HAC DOUGALL to sign.

DICK asked how long SA MAC DOUGALL had been in the
FBI, when assigned to the NYO, when assigned to espicnage
matters and where assigned prior to the N¥O. He asked for
SA MAC DOUGALL's home address and telephene number, Ali of
these questions were answered,

SA MAC DOUGALL was asked the current organizational
setup of the New York Office of-the FBI. The SSC interviewers
were told that J, WALLACE LA PRADE is the ADIC; the five HYO

8 divisions were related to them and they were teld the names
aa of three SAC's., Due to interrupting questions they did not
: get the aames of the SACs of divisions 4 and 5,

: DICK asked for the organizational setup. of Division 3
of the NYO. He was told that SAC ROBERT DENZ heads Division 3,

NW 68262 Docid:32989663 Page 92



that there are ten squads and elght handle Seviet matters while

_ two handle Satellite matters.

SA HAC DOUGALL was asked if he wished te place a
mail cover in a case assigned to him what steps would be
taken. He was then asked what the follow-up steps would
be, taken by FBY personnel and Post Office caacenaneait to put
the maii cover into effect.

SA MAC DOUGALL answered as follows:

He would present the facts of the case to his
Supervisor, CHARLES T, WEIS, who would then present
HAC DOUGALL'’s written recommendation ta SAC ROBERT DENZ.
IZ DENZ thoughts it had merit, it would he recommended to
FBIEQ. if FBIHQ approved the proposal, 2 mail cover would
then be requested by FBIHQ through the Post Office at
Washington, D.C, When the Pest Office notified FBIHQ that
the mail cover would be put into effect, the NYO would be
notified and SAS of the NYO wowid work out with Postal
Inspectors the mechanics of collecting the information
gathered in the mail cover.

DICK asked Af SA HAC DCUGALL had ever participated

in a mail cover, DICK was tole that SA MAC BOUGALL was involved

in preliminary discussions with Postal Inspectors, concerning

& mail cover in 1971. DICK seid he knew cf this case and wanted
to know why SA MAC DOUGALL decided at that time to institute

@ mail cover when the Bureau policy, at that time, and for the
past few years had been to approve no requests for mail or trash
covers, DICK was told that the idea of instituting a mail cover
@t thet time, had been brought up by FBiHQwhich had instructed
the NYO to submit recommendations re a mail cover. SA MAC POUGSLL
had consuited with Postal inspector JOSEPH BOYLE to determine if
®& mail cover would be conducted with security. DICK asked why
SA HAC DOUGALE hed specificaliy gone to BOYLE, DICK was told
that BOYLE was the mam. in the position of authority, (Chief
Postal Ingpector, Bronx, New Yertk) plus BOYLE was knew to
ether SAS of the NYO who had known BOYLE for years aud
recomended him as a highly trustworthy individual,

DICK asked if the mail cover was subsequently put
into effect, He was told that it had been after the FBIEQ
had requested it from Post Office Headquarters.

INW 68262 Docld:32989663 Page 93



DICK asked how the information from the mail cover
Jt : was furnished te the FBI, He was teld that an SA of the FRI
regularly visits the Postai Inapectors and gets this material,
DICK asked how frequently this material is picked up, SA
MAC DOUGALL said he doas not know; it may be daily or weekly
or may vary accerding to other conditions in the case.

: DICK asked if SA MAC DOUGALL had ever had in his
possession a ‘Post Office mail hoz key", SA MAC DOUGALL
answered that for 2 short time he had such a key. DICK asked

7 & number of questions concerning this key and SA MAC DOUGALL

_ related the following: _

4 To the best of SA MAC DOUGALL’s recollection, in

| the Christmas Season of 1971, the Post Office had to temporarily

{ suspend the mail cover because of the Christmas mail rush,

:saae! SA MAC DOUGALL asked scmecne in the Postal Inspectors Office

j (identity not recalled) if it would be possible for an Inspector

: to go te the address where the subject of thé maii cover lived

and get the mail out of the box after 1t was delivered by the

+ carrier, This was done, but the Inspectors refused to continue

: te do this because they were too busy to devete @ man to this
ft every day. At that time SA HAC DOUGALL, asked If be could have
the Key and get the mail without the Postal Inspector. i+
was assumed by SA MAC DOUGALL that this would merely be
implementing the mail cover at a different location, SA
MAC BDOUGALL believes he was given a Post Office key, but after
@ short time (a few minutes or @ couple of hours) the Luspector
said that he could not let SA MAC DOUGALL have the key and
retrieved it. I¢ was never used, Neither the Superviserner
the SAC were specifically told of the key. The Supervisor was
told that attempts to reinstitute the mail cover during the
Christmas season were unsuccessiul.

SA MAC DOUGALL was asited 1f be had been involved
I in any other mail covers, The ®nuswer was no. DICK asked
| 4£ SA MAC DOUGALL knew of any other mail covers, DICK was
: told that SA HAC DOUGALL is sure there are others, but will net
discuss them.

7 " gA WAC DOUGALL was asked if thé madi cover inatiteted
: ‘dm 2971 £5 still in operation. SA MAC DOUGALL said he thinks
“go, but is net sure,

NW 68262 Docld:32989663 Page 94



NW 68262 Docld:32989663 Page 95

ar _

DICK asked if mail covers 2re put on fer specific
periedsa of time; how is renewal obtained and whe approves the
renews2, He was told that & ueli cover is appreved by FBIHQ
for @ specific perdcd; prior to the expiration of the period
the Zield office must present a reasonable argument Zor extension
ef the mail cover. If the Bureeu concurs the mil cover is
then continued for another specific period.

in & question conmmected with nothing previcusly mentioned
DICK asked 1f ED GAMBER had been assigned to Section 37 vith
GA MAC DOUGALL. DICK was told that GAMBER had at ome tine
been on the same squad as HAC DOUGALLs buts had ago worked
om & number of other squads. 7 :

DICK asked if there is any time an SA would ask
& Postal inspecter for information without going through
FBIBQ. He wad told that we wouid, and have in the past,
when following a2 subject, seeing him mail 4 letter; we have
had the inspectors retrieve the letter and copied the dnzqraation
fram the envelope. : : SeEEEH

At approximately 12:15 AM, DICK said he now wanted
to discuss “mail opening". He was tola that this was outside
the seape of matters SA MAC DOUGALL was authorized te discuss.
DICK s@id he would cail PAUL DALY of the Legal Gifice of the
FBI and secure permission. After DICK made this esli ke said
that DALY wanted HAC DOUGALL to return to FBIHQ and discuss
this matter. DICK said he woulti plan to continue the
interview in the afternoon.

At FBIEQ, HAC DOUGALL advised DALY that he did not
wish to get inte an interview concerning "mali opening" until
he had an opportunity to discuss this with his attorney. Since
the 2ttorney was in New York City and this matter could not be
discussed on the phone SA MAC DOUGALL returned to New York.

had no information as to who set it up or how it was set up,

SA Flynn said that it is his current recollection that he was

fa told that it was instigated at the highest levels in Washington,
D.C. It was also his impression that someone from FBI head~
quarters came to New York end contacted the Chief. Postal
Inspector in Naw York. And in turn someone from the New York
offiee contacted the Postmaster of the Lenox Hill Post Office.

estat 8A Flynn was asked if he ever saw a document

U. S. Senate Select Committeae
to Study Governmental Operations
With Respect to Intelligence Activities (SSC)

Re: Interview of Former FBI Inspector Joseph A. Sizoo
by SSC Staff Members

On September 23, 1975, at 9:00 a.m., I was interviewed
first by Michael Epstein and Mary DeOreo of the Senate Select
Committee, having been cleared by the Bureau to discuss with
them pertinent matters concerning the communist infiltration of
the SCLC, the Bureau's investigation of Martin Luther King, Jr.,
and matters directly relating thereto. Subsequent to the
interview by Epstein and DeOreo, I was interviewed by Martha
Talley and John ELLI££ concerning matters previously cleared
with the Bureau as to investigative procedures of the Domestic
Intelligence Division (DID), the Security Index and related
indices, the Counterintelligence Program, and the dissemination
of information. ‘The interview was concluded at 12:15 p.m. and
took place in one of the Committee's interview rooms in the
former Carroll Arms Hotel. At the outset of the first interview,
I was furnished and signed an "ADVICE OF RIGHTS" statement which
was retained by Mr. Epstein.

Me. Epstein began his interview by asking questions
concerning my Bureau assignments and tenure of service as an
official of the DID. These matters I answered fully.

Mc. Epstein asked me to furnish, and I did so, the
organizational setup of the DID from the time that I last
Joined the DID in 1955 to the time I retired. Among the things
covered in my response were the following.

I identified by name the various Assistant Directors
and Branch Chiefs from 1955 onward, The Assistant Directors
were Alan Belmont, William C. Sullivan, Charles D. Breanan and
Edward Miller. The Branch Chiefs, in addition. to myself,
were Carl Hennrich and Donald E, Moore. I furnished the
approximate periods of time the various Assistant Directors
served as such in the DID. I also furnished, at Mr. Epstein's
specific request, the last previous assignment for each of the

U. S. Senate Select Committee
to Study Governmental Operations
With Respect to Intelligence Activities (SSC)

Re: Interview of Former FBI Inspector Joseph A. Sizoo
by SSC Staff Members

Assistant Directors except Mr. Belmont, They were as follows;
Sullivan-Section Chief in DID; Brennan~Section Chief in DID;

and Miller-Number One Man, Inspection Division, It appeared

to me quite apparent that much of the information I was furnish-
ing was already in Mr. Epstein's possession.

I was also asked, and did roughly diagram for
Mr. Epstein, the physical layout of the front offices of the
DID, showing the placement of the Assistant Directors, Branch
Chiefs and their secretaries. ‘This covered space in the
Justice Building.. and leased space at 1730 K Street, Northwest,
and at 9th and D Streets, Northwest.

He then asked a series of questions concerning the
Bureau's investigation of the communist infiltration of the SCLC
and the basis for such investigation. It was pointed out that
allegations had been received in the Bureau from time to time
concerning communist infiltration into the SCLC and the purpose
of the Bureau's investigation was to determine whether or not
such infiltration was a fact. Epstein then made reference to
Hunter Pitts O'Dell and asked if his presence as a staff officer
of SCLC had been instrumental in the initiation of the investiga-
tion, I told him that I did not recall the details but it might
well be that O'Dell's presence on the SCLC Staff was one of the
reasons for the investigation.

He asked if the alleged relationship between
Martin Luther King, Jr., and a man named Levison (Stanley David
Levison) was a contributing factor to the initiation of the
investigation by the Bureau. I told him chat this also might
well have been the case. He then asked if our investigation was
to determine the association of King and other SCLC officials
with communists or to determine whether or not such communists
did, in fact, exert influence over SCLC officials, I told him
that it would seem logical for our investigation to address

Re: Interview of Former PBI Inspector Joseph A, Sizoo
by SSC Staff Menbers

itself to both aspects of the associution betwoen King and
niewbers of the Commmist Party. He asked 1f the bureau did,

in fact, assume the presence of comnunist Influence if thore
was an association between SCLC officials and members of the
Communist Party. I told him that such an assumption would not
be made but that our investigation would be addressed to determine
the presence and extent of commimist influence over SCLC leaders,
Epstein then made reference to Levison and said that from his
veview of information made available to him it appeared to hin
that Levison was a critical fi ure in the investigation of King
and asked if I could elaborate on the activities of Levison and
his communist influence. I told him that I could not. He then
pressed for additional information concerning Levison and asked
why I could not furnish more specific information concerning
Levison's significance as a communist. I told him that I could
not provide any additional information because it might well
adversely affect confidential sources,

Mr. Eostein then called my attention co a memorandum
written in 1964, a copy of which he had, concerning a conference
attended by certain field representatives from Atlanta in which
methods of handling our investigadion of SCLC and King werea
subject of discussion. In one paragraph, reference was made co
the need for the development of personal information concerning
King for possible counterintelligence use. He said this appeared
to constitute o chanse of direction in our investisation and he
asked if {£ could elaborate on the reasons for this chance, IT
told him I could not, and pointed out that this did not necessarily
constitute a change in direction of the investigation, that our
investigation always was to determine the extent of comminist
influence around King. .

U. $. Senate Select Committee

With Respect to Intelligence Activities (SSC)

Re: Interview of Former FBI Inspector Joseph A. Sizoo
by $8C Staff Members

Epstein also called my attention to a 1963 SAG Letter
instructing that intensified efforts be made by the field to
develop the maximum possible information concerning Comaunist
Party efforts to infiltrate and influence other organizations,
and asked if this did not indicate a change in direction of
the investigation of communist infiltration of organizations
because he said he read into that SAC Letter that it was desired
that the field develop information for possible counterintelligence
use. I called his attention to the fact that the Letter speaks
for itself and did not contain languaze waich would support
his assumptions.

Mr. Epstein also noted that the Bureau had used
microphone coverage on King from time to time, He showed me a
memorandum which related to a telephone call I had received from
New York requesting authority for New York to place microphone
coverage on King, With reference to microphone coverage, he
asked if our coverage was placed for the purpose of developiay
personal misconduct as to King as well as information concerning
communist influence and i told him that as the particular
memorandum reflects it was to determine the nature of the
communist influence around King. He then asked if I had the
authority to approve such microphone installation at that time.
I pointed out that as the memorandum in question reflects time
was of the essence, I had approved New York's going ahead with
it and did send the instant memorandum through for final approval
and it was, in fact, approved by Hr. Hoover.

lr. Epstein also made reference to the handling of
Klan and racial matters, noting that the memoradum referred to
above had been checked for Mr. Rosen, and asked if the General
Investigative Division at that time was handling racial matters.
I told him that as I recalled this was true as of that time.

U. S. Senate Select Committee
to Study Governnental Operations
With Respect to Intelligence Activities (SSC)

Res Interview of Former FBI Inspector Joseph A. Sizoo
by SSC Staff Members

He chen asked how it happened that the racial and Klan matters
were transferred to the DID, indicating that he had noted that
DID had more recently supervised these matters, I told him

that as I recalled, Mr, Sullivan had recommended in a memorandum
that these matters be transferred to DID on the basis that they
were of an intelligence-type investization and he considered it
more logical that they be supervised in DID.

After the above interview conducted by Mr. Epstein
and Miss DeOreo, Martha Talley and John ELIif£ were called and
cane into the room to conduct their portion of this interview.
Martha Talley began the interview by asking a series of questions
regarding the origin of the Security Index. She indicated
considerable knowledge of the general period when the Security
Index was developed and asked if I had any knowledge way the
Security Index was considered necessary. I told her that I did
not have detailed knowledge because I was not in the Division at
that time. However, I understood that the creation of the Index
had been the subject of discussion between Bureau officials and
Departmental officials and it was the feeling that a more
efficient and effective list of persons danzerous to the security
of the country should be developed than was available at the
beginning of World War II.

I was asked by Mr. ELLif£f£ who could approve additions
and deletions to the Security Index, In response, I first
pointed out to lir. ELLi££ that he appeared to have in his
possession a folder containing detailed instructions within the
FBI concerning the Security Index and that such information 11s
likely already in his possession. Nonetheless, I did advise
him my recollection was that approvals went up through the
Assistant Director of DID whereas deletions did not go quite
that high in endorsement, I also pointed out that, as in all
other matters relating to the Security Index, approval of the
Department of Justice was required. Again, it appeared apparent
to me that the Committee already had in its possession the answers
to the questions being asked of me in this area,

U. S. Senate Select Comualtcee
to Study Governmental Operations
With kespect to Intellisence Activities (SSC)

Re; Interview of Former FBI Inspector Joseph A. Sizoo
by SSC Staff Members

Miss Talley then asked wnat the distinction was between
the Securlty Index and the Key Activist Index. I teld her that
as { recalled, the Key Activist Index was made up of top leader-
ship members of subversive organizations who were included in

the Security Index but were designated Key Activists for
adainistrative reasons primarily within the Bureau. Miss Talley
also asked about the Agitator Index and why it was created. I
pointed out that they appeared to have copies of all pertinent
memoranda concerniny, this and other matters referred to and that
the menoranda would certaialy speak for themselves.

At this point ELLI££ took over the interview and
repeated the questions asked by Epstein concerning the transfer
of racial and Klan matters to Division 5 (DID) and I gave him
im essence the same answer.

ELLI££ then asked when the Bureau began Lavestigations
of the groups opposing the Vietnam War and I cold him I had no
indevendent recollection concerning such investigations, He
also asked if I had any recollection as to the instructions that
went to the field to open investigations concerning new groups
in the general racial field and I told him that i did not recall
such instructions, ELLif£ then showed me a 1970 Executive
Conference memorandum written by C. D. Brennan concernins the
openings of individual active investigations on members of antiwar
and related groups, it bela, noted in an SAG Letter that we had
previously not investigated all members of such groups. He
asked why the Bureau had decided to institute investigation of
individual members of such groups, and I told him T had no
independent recollection of why this was done,

Rez; Interview of Former PBI Inspector Joseph A, Sizoo
by SSG Staff Members

ELLi££ then asked a series of questions concerning the
break with Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the discontinuance
of liaison with other agencies. He asked how liaison was handled
with CIA after the break and I told him it was done by letter or
telephone by the individual Section Chiefs or DID Front Office
officials, He then asked if liaison with other agencies, noting
that the discontinuance of liaison with other agencies followed
shortly after the break with CIA, was handled in the same way.

I told him this was the case. He then asked if the Bureau did

aot suffer as a result of the discontinuance of Liaison with CIA
and other agencies, I told him that the Bureau officials and
supervisors did the best they could to fulfill any Liaison needs
with other agencies but it was quite obvious from the fact that
liaison was reinstituted some years later and is in effect today
that more effective liaison can be maintained by a separate section,

ELLif£ then asked if I could tell him what the "mass
media program” was, as he noted on some copies of mail that
copies were designated for Mc. Bishop with the further notation
‘mass media program,"' I told him I did not recall that he had
requested Bureau clearance for me to discuss such a program where-
upon he withdrew the question. He then said there were a couple
of other matters he would like to discuss with me if I felt free
to do so and for which he had not yet obtained clearance. He
said they were "surreptitious entries" and "mail openings." I
told him that since his request for clearance had not covered such
matters, I would not discuss such matters. He then asked if I
would be willing to discuss such matters with him if he obtained
clearance and I told him I would not. ElLif£ also said that he
had not obtained clearance, but if I would do so, he would like
to ask a series of questions concerning the “Huston Matter” and
also some questions concerning the technical surveillances that
the Bureau apparently had in effect at the request of
Mr. Kissinger's office at the White House. I told him that I
had no clearance to discuss such matters.

Me. ELLif££'s last questions related to the Counter-

the reasons for the approval of the Program and when and why it
was discontinued, I told him I had no independent: recollection
with reference to specifically why the Program was created or
why it was discontinued.

NOTE:

Information from Epstein and Elliff was accepted by
Supervisor P. V. Daly of the Legal Counsel Division and Daly
briefed Sizoo before the interview (see Legal Counsel to Mr. J. B.
Adams memorandum, 9/22/75, "Senstudy 75"). After the interview,
Sizoo dictated his statement to a Bureau stenographer and
supplemented it with information he telephonically furnished on
9/25/75 to Supervisor S. F. Phillips of the Senstudy Project.

This memorandum summarizes a briefing afforded yf ¢

Mr. Walter Ricks, Staff Member, Senate Select Committee on
Intelligence Activities, by Section Chiefs, Joseph G. Deegan
and Robert L. Shackelford ani Liaison Supervisor B,C. Rachner,
covering the FBI's relationship with the IRS Special Service
Staff Program,

the FBI's cooperation with IRS concerning this Program, the [~~ ’

Ricks was principally interested in the basis for f
N,
~

extent of any known White House or Congressional influence,
the type of information disseminated to IRS, the mechanics of.
dissemination and the basis for the discontinuance of
dissemination,

The FBI's policy of disseminating information of
jurisdictional interest to other agencies within the Executive
Branch of Government was explained to Ricks. Concerning IRS,
it was pointed out that the FBI's first knowledge of the
formation by IRS of its Special Service Staff, originally
known as the Activist Organization Committee, occurred in
August, 1969, following receipt of a letter from IRS re-
questing that the FBI disseminate to the IRS Special Service
Staff reports concerning approximately 75 extremist and
dissident groups listed by IRS. Following the approval of
former Director J. Edgar Hoover, the FBI proceeded to make
the requested dissemination to IRS, Although this
concentrated Program broadened our previous scope of
dissemination to IRS, it was explained to Ricks that the
dissemination was responsive to an official IRS request and
fully consistent with the FBI's policy of dissemination to
agencies within the Executive Branch of Government. Tt was
further explained that the FBI did not initiate 0
investigations on organizations listed by Rg Ps Leh) e

Re: Senstudy 75

subjects of previous FBI investigations, Rather, the FBI
restricted its dissemination to information developed in
current investigations within FBI jurisdiction. From a
practical standpoint, FBI reaction to the IRS request was
not unlike a routine name check request involving a large
group of organizations or individuals.

Ricks was informed that the FBI had no direct
knowledge concerning the ultimate use and disposition of
the FBI information by IRS. It was pointed out that the
FBI was in no position to challenge the credibility of
another agency's jurisdictional interest without some
obvious basis. In this case, the IRS in making its request
advised that the information was desired for the purpose of
initiating field investigations and audits looking toward
uncovering tax and gun law violations. Obviously, the FBI
had no reason to question this motive. Concerning White
House influence, Ricks was advised that the FBI had no
direct knowledge of such influence outside of a memorandum
noting a comment by an IRS official that the Special Service
Staff had been formed by IRS as a result of White House and
Congressional pressures. Robert L, Shackelford, Joseph G.
Deegan and B. C. Rachner emphasized they had no personal
knowledge of such pressures nor knowledge of any information
in FBI files evidencing such pressures.

Shackelford and Deegan explained to Ricks the
mechanics of FBI dissemination to IRS as it related to the
Special Service Staff Program. Briefly, upon receipt of
the original IRS request, FBIHQ officials and FBI field
divisions were alerted to the IRS interest. Upon receipt
by FBIHQ of a report falling within the guidelines, the
substantive Supervisor, following a review of the report,
would designate it for dissemination to IRS. No
dissemination of the report was made at the field level.

The dissemination material was forwarded by a covering
routing slip addressed to the IRS Special Service Staff and
actually transmitted by courier service. This procedure was
fully consistent with the mechanics of dissemination to

other agencies within the Executive Branch of Government. In
response to a direct question, Shackelford, Deegan and Rachner
advised that they had no personal knowledge of any
dissemination under this Program routinely received by the

Memorandum V. V. Kolombatovic to W. R. Wannall
Re: Senstudy 75

FBI from IRS. It was pointed out to Ricks that the receipt
of information from IRS in all areas is extremely limited
inasmuch as IRS investigative information is tax related and
cannot be disclosed to anyone including Government agencies
without abiding by the very complex provisions of the IRS
Code. These provisions were briefly explained to Ricks by
Rachner.

Ricks asked whether the FBI had any way of
determining the number of reports disseminated to IRS under
the Special Service Staff Program. Ricks was told it would
be impossible to come up with this figure and he dropped the
subject. Ricks also inquired whether Shackelford, Deegan or
Rachner were aware of any instances wherein the FBI had
inspired IRS to take some initiative to investigate a
specific organization or individual. Ricks made specific
mention of the "Cointelpro" program, Shackelford, Deegan
and Rachner advised that they had no personal knowledge of
such action and pointed out to Ricks that the "Cointelpro"
program was a separate program handled by other areas of the
Intelligence Division.

Concerning discontinuame of the program, it was
confirmed that the FBI terminated its dissemination to the
IRS Special Service Staff in September, 1973, in accordance
with a specific request from the Commissioner of IRS. Ricks
was further advised that, thereafter, the FBI continued
dissemination, pursuant to agreement with the Commissioner,
information only of a jurisdictional interest to IRS in
connection with IRS responsibilities relating to possible

By memorandum 9/17/75, you were advisedfof the ten
tative schedule for public testimony before ‘the ‘Senate ‘Select
Committee involving the Bureau. One of the announced topics
involved the Bureau's involvement with local authorities re-
lative to the police raid on the Black Panther Party in
Chicago, Illinois, which resulted in the shooting death of
Fred Hampton, Chicago Black Panther Party Leader.

The representatives of the Committee in previous
discussions with representatives of this Division and the
Department had made overtures regarding the interviews of ccaglp
Agents involved in the Fred Hampton matter and the Committed,
has made document requests in that area. Concern was ex-
pressed to the Committee representatives and to. the ne
that a public hearing on this topic would adversely impact on

. civil litigation areas out of the Hampton matter involving
Bureau Agents as defendants in their individual and official
‘jcapacity. It was also pointed out to the Department and Com-

ittee that this particular civil litigation was scheduled for
trial in November and it was apparent that the Committee's pub-
lic hearings would be also held in November.

At the request of the Deputy Special Counsel for
Intelligence Coordination in the Department, Steven Blackhurst,
SAs Paul V. Daly and Robert C.. Blunt met with him and Edward
Christenbury of the Department to discuss this particular
matter. It was the Department's position that since the
Attorney General has indicated that requests of the Senate
Select Committee should not be refused because of the impact -
they might have on civil or criminal litigation that ‘the -
document request would have to be fulfilled. Tnpthis ~regard,
Christenbury indicated that Chicago police ‘officérs ee are”

also. defendants in the civil litigation had expies a5 & Eayeush

and/or testimony might adversely impact on their trial.
Christenbury stated that the had conversed with | attorneys
representing the local officials and these attorneys in-
dicated that they would fight any motion in the Federal
District Court in Chicago wherein the civil litigation

should be held in the modification of an existing protective
order. In this regard, many of the documents requested by the
Senate Select Committee are under a protective order and prior
to release to the Senate Select Committee, the protective order
must be modified. Christenbury stated that the Department would
file a motion to have the order modified at the request of the
Senate Select Committee; however, their request would be neutral
insofar as ‘ecommeridat ions. to. the court .

By this, he explained that ‘the motion would merely
state that the Senate Select Committee had requested material
. currently under the protective order by the court and asked
the ‘court to consider modifying the existing protective order.
Christenbury stated that it was apparent that from statements
the local deferidants' counsels made that they would resist, as
much as possible, any modification of this order.

It was pointed out to Christenbury that this Bureau
had received unofficial requests that Agents, former or current,.
who are defendants in this matter submit to interview and that
we did not feel that ‘such Agents should submit to interview in
view of. the pending civil litigation. Christenbury indicated
that he was in agreement as was Blackhurst and that they would ,
attempt to resist efforts to interview the Bureau personnel in-
volved as defendants in this matter.’ Thé’conserisus of those at
this meeting was that it was unfortunate and undesirable that
hearings be held on this particular topic since the. very issues
to. be raised during the civil litigation would be the focal
point of public hearings.

Blackhurst on 9/26/75 advised that. he ‘had again brought
. to the ‘attention of John E1lif, Task Force Director of the Domestic
Task Force of the Senate Select ‘Committee, the Department's and
Bureau's. concern relative to public hearings on this. topic and
ELliff indicated that. they were reconsidering having hearings -on
|this matter and that it was eritirely possible that these hearings,
in fact, will not be held. Additionally, Blackhurst indicated
there have been no further requests relative to the requesting
of Agents to submit to interview by the Committee.

and get the mail out of the box after it was delivered by the j

. carrier, This was done, but the Inspectors tefused to continue “|

’ te do this because | they were too busy to devote 2-man to this’: ~

7 7 every day, At that time SA HAC DOUGALL. asked if he could ave _

‘ the key and get the n2i2 without the Fostal Inspector, It -

records disclose that Mr. Pardum was employed there during 1967 and earned
$247.50 with $1.80 income tax withheld. Based on this information, a tax

OBSERVATIONS: ~

Recent events on many college campuses through-
out the nation point up the true anarchistic nature. of the
New Left movement. It is abundantly clear that this
movement is bent on revolution. As a result, it is
incumbent upon us to closely follow this movement. In
part, this can be done through the investigations of its
Key Activists. We have been conducting exhaustive inves-

tigations of the activities of certain of the Key
Activists in the New Left.

As a part of our intensification program, we
are inquiring into the financial activity of these individuals.
Part of this inquiry is to consist of a survey of their
tax returns to determine their financial status, the source
of their income, and to determine whether their income
supports their ability to travel throughout this country,
and abroad as part of the New Left revolt, A blind

SYNOPSIS: In October, 1968, you assigned to Internal Security
Section four Supervisors, one clerk, and two stenographers (one
released) on special assignment from other sections and steno
pool within the division. You specificaily instructed these ay Ok
individuals be assigned to broaden our coverage of New Left in a
view of major threat it poses, You instructed at the end of “4P
four months a reassessment and recommendations be made as to need 4
g

for continuance of this expanded coverage. The purpose of this
memorandum is to report the status of this situation with the
recommendation to make permanent personnel assigned to our expanded §
coverage of the New Left movement, q

Expanded coverage enabled intensified investigation of
widespread and diverse activities of New Left and concentration of §&
efforts to define movement, penetrate it, and cope with it. It has i
allowed concentration on.student disorders, protest groups, finances,
publications, and exploration and evaluation of foreign influence,
In addition, this unit has assumed overall responsibility for campus §
disorders, including dissemination of the activ
on campus, Also, because many ged:

sified coverage made possible by additional manpower refléctt ao in aq

aia -communist groups are more and more exerting greater
influence on New Left and particularly directing attacks against
FBI and police. Success of expanded coverage to date warrants
establishing it on a permanent basis at this time,

OBSERVATIONS: With facts so clearly indicating the need for this
manpower on permanent basis, it would be advisable to make the changeé

Memorandum to Mr. W. C, Sullivan
RE: NEW -LEFT MOVEMENT
100-446997

DETAILS:

The rapid rise of New Left activity involving large
scale protest demonstrations and student disorders and related
violence including bombings and arsons makes expansion of our
coverage of these matters imperative, A thorough veview of the
New Left movement was made looking toward determination of areas-
demanding additional attention and the best approach for in-depth
exploration and evaluation of the problems so that maximum utili-
zation of manpower could be achieved. In order to eve 2
coordinated intensified investigation of the New Left, in October,
1968, you temporarily assigned four additional supervisors, one
clerk and two stenographs (one released) to the Internal Security
Section from other sections and the steno pool within the division.

:
E
The additional manpower has enabled us to afford in-depth

probative supervision to student disorders, protest groups, New

Left publications and finances, and exploration. and evaluation of
foreign influence in the New Left. We are now able to initiate
surveys and programs to dig into the problem and cope with it.
rather than follow events as they occur, For example, the following

accomplishments directly resulted from utilization of additional
manpower.

We have now received the first of our comprehensive
quarterly reports from all offices on the New Left movement,
These reports have subheadings of major interest to us, such as
"Incidents of Violence," "Finances," "Foreign Influence," etc,
These reports are particularly valuable to give us a national
picture of the movement at one time and will serve as tic basis
for preparation of documents in detail for dissemination.

We have completed a field-wide survey of New Left
publications, There are approximately 250 of them, and a select
number are reviewed regularly, Cases are open on those deemed
Significant in the New Left movement, Concerning their financial
structure, of particular interest to us, it was determined they
are "shoe string" operations dependent on street sales and
solicitations of funds through donations, No large contributors

were noted. They do serve as the communications medium of the
New Left.

Memorandum to Mr. W. C. Sullivan 7
RE: NEW LEFT MOVEMENT
100-446997

We have radically increased our Key Activists Program,
believing concentration on them to obtain successful prosecutions,
thereby taking them out of the movement, is the best means of
reducing the effectiveness of the movenent. We presently have
86 cases open on Key Activists and persons involved in foreign
influence in the New Left and are expanding the program as time
permits review-of files and new material warrants their inclu-
sion,

7 On 12/6/68 we held a conference with 12 SACs and their
supervisors at the Bureau. The conference brought out the need
for concentration of efforts against Key Activists in the New
Left movement with emphasis on developing substantive violations,
local or federal, for which they can be prosecuted, The shift
of the New Left to violence, including numerous instances of
bombing and arson, was stressed, pointing out that this activity
lends itself to successful prosecution. Other worthwhile sugges~
tions and recommendations were made and are under consideration.

For example, we have instituted, on a 90-day trial
basis, elimination of follow-up- letterhead memoranda to initial
teletypes in routine demonstrations, Dissemination is being
handled by Xeroxing "clean" versions of the incoming teletype.
The expected savings in clerical and stenographic time in the
field will be tremendous, Thus far, the change has caused no
problems and appears warranted. Appropriate recommendations
will be made at the end of the 90-day trial period.

In connection with New Left neces, we have opened
a case on the Louis M, Rabinowitz Foundation which gave more
than $300,000 to various groups including New Left activists.
We are looking toward removal of their tax exempt status, We
also opened a case on "Resist," which is engaged in fund raising
for New Left activities, 7

We have caused a survey to be made by Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) concerning Key Activists. We have found a number
where no record exists for payment of taxes in 1966, 1967, e
Included in this group are Jerry Clyde Rubin, Linda Morse Dannenberg,
and David Tyre Dellinger. IRS has initiated appropriate investi-
gations as a result of our inquiries. It is anticipated the IRS
inquiry will cause these individuals considerable consternation, L

possibly jail sentences eventually. We now have sent requests on
35 Key Activists to IRS and anticipated many will have fzled no

RE: NEW LEFT MOVEMEN’

returns, This action is consistent with our efforts to obtain
prosecution of any kind against Key Activists to remove them
from the movement,

Foreign influence of the New Left movement offers us
a fertile field to develop valuable intelligence data. To date
there is no real cohesiveness between international New Left
groups, but such an effort was initiated in September, 1968,
at an International Student Conference at Columbia University.
This conference disclosed that despite the factionalism and
confusion now so prevelant, there is great potential for the
development of an international student revolutionary movement,
We are initiating investigations aimed at identifying prominent
foreign New Left leaders and activists and ta increase our reser-
voir of background information regarding foreign New Left organize.
tions. This also encompasses travel on the part of groups or
individuals either to or from the U. S., and will include inter-
national conferences, 7

We have taken over the supervision of sedition and
related cases involving antidraft activity, which centers mainly
around The Resistance, We have received information indicatitig—~
extensive contacts and cooperation between Canadian antidraft
groups, which openly and actively encourage draft evasion by
Americans, and many U. S. groups and individuals, There are also
indications of a clandestine escape route between the U. S. and
Canada, Available figures show there are in excess of 140 U. S.
deserters in Canada and estimates of draft evaders run into the
thousands. In addition, the Army has advised that it expects
the full impact of the drafting of college graduates by the end
of 1969, By that time one in every five unlisted men will be
a college graduate and the Army anticipates a resulting increase
in agitation and subversion by individuals who became committed
to resistance while in college. The Army has recently compli-
mented us on our coverage in this field and asked for our continued
emphasis of these investigations,

Possibly the best utilization of manpower has been
that it enables us to afford close supervision to these cases.
Our expanded coverage has enabled us to afford intensified
investigative attention to the widespread and diverse activities
of the New Left in order to define the movement, penetrate it
and cope with it.

In addition, this unit has assumed overall responsibility

for immediate dissemination of information concerning campus
disorders, including the activities of black student groups, ‘This

problem is becoming increasingly important in its national scope.
Also, because many sedition allegations arise from the activities
of New Left protest groups, these cases: have been assigned to

this unit so they can be coordinated with the existing investiga- i
tions. . ;

paneer

The intensified coverage madé possible by the additional
manpower is_.reflected in the nearly tripled case load within four
months in this unit.

Success of our expanded coverage to date warrants
establishing it on a permanent basis, A review of the New Left
movement at this time does not disclose any indications of diminish~
ing activity in the foreseeable future, but increase in violence
in demonstrations, particularly on campuses, and an increase in
terroristic tactics including bombings and arsons against the
U. S. Government.

Furthermore, it is apparent that the old~line communist
groups such as the Communist Party, USA, the Progressive Labor
Party, the Socialist Workers Party, and particularly its youth
affiliate, the Young Socialist Alliance are making a determined
effort to move into the New Left movement to exert a greater :
influence and control over its future activities. More and more .
we see the New Left movement holding up as heroes international
communists such as Fidel Castro, Ho Chi Minh, and Mao Tse-tung.

More and more we also see old-line leftist groups influencing the
thinking of the New Left along Marxist lines and giving direction
to attacks against the police in general and the FBI in particular ,.~
to drive us off the campuses; as well as attacks against the new
administration to degrade President Nixon. We can expect this
activity to intensify greatly in the future.

Memorandum R.L. Shackelford to C.D. Brennan
RE: COMMUNIST INFILTRATED AND

NEW LEFT GROUPS UNIT

STATUS REPORT

5. Six additions have been made to the Key
- Activists program apart from the above survey. More will
be added as time permits review of files and new material
warrants their inclusion.

6. We have approval for a conference with 12 key

SACs and their supervisors at Seat of Government on the New
Left movement. We are presently setting up the agenda and
back-up material.

item 7%. Possibly the bést long-range utilization of
manpower has been that it enables us to afford close super-
vision to these cases, A heavy volume of follow-ups have
been sent to the field pointing out lack of coverage -and
generally poor investigations or no investigation. This is
the only way we can force offices to put manpower on these
cases,

8. In connection with New Left finances, we have
opened a case on the Louis M. Rabinowitz Foundation which gave
more than $300,000 to various groups including New Left i
activists. We are looking toward removal of their tax exempt
status. We also opened a case on "Resist" which is engaged
in fund-raising for New Left activities.

9, We have recently sent out instructions to all
field offices to eliminate "Videm" captions and to use description
captions, setting out the organization primarily involved in
the title, This greatly helps routing of mail to appropriate
desks and forces the field to identify the primary organization |
responsible, It is also expected to facilitate closer super-
| vision of the organization cases,

10. We have caused a survey to be made by Internal

¢ Revenue Service (IRS) concerning key activists. We have found

a number whé“no record exists for payment of taxes 1966, 1967, |

Included in this group are Jerry Clyde Rubin, Linda Norse

Dannenberg and David Tyre Dellinger. IRS has initiated appro-

priate investigations as a result of our inquiries. It is

anticipated the IRS inquiry will cause these individuais

considerable consternation, possibly jail sentences eventually.

This action is consistant with our efforts to obtain prosecution

of any kind against key activists to remove them from the

movement.

Internal Revenue Service. : .

~*~.

Following a reauest approved in my memorandum 5/23/68, ~
Internal Revenue Service furnished copies of Federal Income Tax
Returns for certain Key Activists. For others, it was determined
that no returns had been filed and Internal Revenue Service has
initiated investigations.

We have recently expanded the Key Activist Program tot f
include additional individuals, As a part of our over-all ib
intensive investigation designed to neutralize these individuals 4
in the New Left movement, inquiry into their financial status \ i
has proven productive. Information from their Federal Income }
Tax Returns is of value and, in addition, Internal Revenue Service x
action may be initiated where no return is filed or a return is |
filed showing only minimal income not in keeping with outlays |
for travel and other activities. ws

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

With respect to Item 12, Part VII, of the SSC
letter of August 20, 1975, a discussion was also held regarding
this Item at the above-mentioned moeting with Mr. Epstein.
It was agreed that in order to locate information received by
the FBI from the Central Intelligence Agency regarding King,
the search at FBIHQ would be confined to abstracts of King's
file and subfiles. Subsequent review of these abstracts dis-
closed three documents, copies of which are being deliverad.
Glearance for release of these documents to the SSC was
obtained on September 17, 1975, from Mr. Walt Elder, Assistant
to the Director, Central Intelligence Agency.

Regarding Item 16 d, Part VII, of the August 20, 1975,
request, it is noted that the R, W. Smith memorandum to
Me. W. CG. Sullivan, dated June 2, 1968, and captioned
"Movtla Luther King, Jx., Request by President Lyndon By
Johnson for Detailed File," in the First paragraph, refers to
a “memorandum of Mr. DeLoach to Mr. folson, S72a/63 same
title, which set forth the request of the President, conveyed
through Special Counsel Larry &. Temple, for all information
concerning King..." An exhaustive search of all logical files,
indices and abstracts has failed to locate this memorandum
dated May 24, 1968.

During the same meeting between Mr. Epstein and
representatives of the Intelligence Division of the FBI,
Mr, Epstein modified Item 16 d. He advised that responsas con~
cerning playing tapes or offers to play tapes, dissemination of
transcripts or offers to disseminate transcripts, be limited to
such actions regarding the White House or to persons outside
the Executive Branch rather than to persons not employed by.
the FBI as stated in the request under Item 16 d,

In response to Item 7 a, Part I, of the SSC request
dated August 26, 1975, the following is noted. Page 7 of FBI
memorandum of July 24, 1975, identifying electronic surveillance
(elsuc) reflects that Dr. King "was overheard on three occasions
on tesurs on other parties." “The SSG request of August 26, 1975,
asked for the identification of the targets, addresses, and
dates of installation and termination of the overhears in
these three instances.

In regard to the above, a further check disclosed
that King was overheard on five occasions. For the puxpose
of clarification, reference to the term “occasions” indicates
only the first overhear. King was overheard on numerous dates
subsequent to the first occasion.

elaboration of this problem in view of the instructions sent
to field offices in October, 1966, directing them to submit
‘the names of all individuals whose voices have been monitored
through a microphone installed or a telephone surveillance
operated by the office anytime since January one, one nine
six zero. :

To further elaborate on this particular Item and to
offer clarification, the following three factors are submitted:

1. Pxrier to issuing instructions to field offices in
October, 1966, directing them to submit the names of all indiv-
iduals whose voices have been monitored through a microphone
installed or a telephone surveillance operated by the offices
anytime since 1/1/60, additional surveillonces on which King
was monitored are unaccountable for as these surveillance logs
may have been destroyed.

2, Prior to the instructions, pexsomel handling
legs may have felt that overhears were of no substance of
significance and consequently were not recorded.

3. The setting up of the elsur indices was a field-
wide project of large proportions and the instructions going
to the field 10/5/66, were subject to broad intecpretation,
thus leading to possible misinterpretation of these instructions.
Also, the factor of human error might be involved, thereby
causing incomplete indices until the mechanics of the procedure
were iconed out.

The above responses to Items 7 a and b were discussed
and agreed upon during the above-mentioned meeting between
Mr. Epstein and representatives of the Intelligence Division
of the FBI,

With respect to Item 10 c, Part I, of the SSC request
dated August 26, 1975, included in the material being delivered

with this memorandum are the only communications in FBI files
which wa have been able to locate after an exhaustive file check.

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

It should be noted that memorandum af C. D. DeLoach

to Mr. Mohr dated December 1, 1964, captioned “Ben Bradlee
Bureau Chief ‘Newsweek Magazine’ Washington, D. C." which

is being delivered with this memorandum refers to another
memorandum of Mr. DeLoach, dated November 21, 1964, authorizing
DeLoach to furnish Bradlee certain information on a confidential
basis at the time of his visit to FBIHQ. Search of appropriate
files at FBIHQ failed to locate DeLoach's memorandum dated
November 21, 1964. :

With respect to the excisions in materials being
delivered herewith, where no notation appears as to reason
for excision, the excision was made for the reason that the
information actually summarizes or quotes from conversations
monitored during electronic surveillances of King. In some
cases, it can be ascertained precisely what information in
FBI files came from electronic surveillances of Dr. Kings
however, thera exist areas where documentation of the information
is not precise and no accurate determination can be made.
Therefore, no assurances can be given that portions of the
material being furnished do not contain information developed

-as a result of electronic surveillances of King.

Upon delivery of material with this memorandum we

have fulfilled all requests concerning King contained in the
SSC requests of August 20, 1975, and August 26, 1975.

ADDENDUM:CDD:dgs, 12/10/64 ‘

I fully agree that this work should eventually done, particularly
if an additional controversy arises with King. I See no nec ty, however, in this
work being done at the present time inasmuch as the controversy has quieted down
considerably and we are not in need of transcriptions right now. In view of the
transcription Already accomplished, and because of the above-mentioned reasons,
I would recommend that we hold off doing this tremendous amount of work until there :
is an actual need. :

7 Pursuant to the Dire
the attached report concerning th:
to Walter Jenkins of the White House This morning a 200 a.m.

Jenkins read the entire report word for word. I told him that the Director thought
perhaps the President might like to know about this matter strictly in confidence..
Jenkins stated he would tell the President this afternoon about this incident. He
stated that it certainly opened his.eyes and he felt it was one of the most repulsive
incidents that he knew of. I told Jenkins that the Director indicated I should leave
this attachment with him if he desired to let the President personally read it.
Jenkins mentioned that he was sufficiently aware of the facts that he could verbally
advise the President of the matter. Jenkins was of the opinion that the FBI could
‘perform a good service to the country if this matter could somehow be confidentially
given to members of the press. I told him the Director had this in mind, however,
falso believed we should obtain additional information prior to discussing it with ,

J (G"NEWSWEEK" MAGAZINE

— WASHINGTON, D. C, ee /
By letter dated 11-10-64 the captioned Tidividual advised the Director that on
that date his publication was beginning to prepare a cover story on the Director and request-
ed the Direcior's indulgence and cooperation in this matter. While no definite date has
‘been arranged for the publication of the story, it is presently contemplated that it will be
published around the first of 1965, probably in connection with the Director's birthday.
Bradlee points out that the Director and the FBI have been such a major force in Americ
history for so many years that they really need no "peg.'' He requests the opportunity to
take a color picture of the Director for the magazine cover at the Director's convenience
if the Director is agreeable, to do this as soon as possible due to the time lag involved in
the engraving. He also requests a series of interviews for Mr. Bill Gray whose assignment |
it will be to get the most up-to-date picture of the Bureau's operations, techhiques, ambitiors:
and problems. He indicates this could be worked out with you (Mr. DeLoach). Bradlee aiso :
anticipates an eventuai request for an opportunity to talk with the Director in as much detail
as the Director will allow. Mr. Bradiee stated that he looks forward to seeing the Director
because in doing | this cover story for the publication he wants it to be "flawless."

Your office has had generally frieridly relations with Mr. Bradlee who has heen!

‘favorably disposed toward the Bureau. He has been with "Newsweek" since 1954, about six
‘years of this time in.Paris, France, Before that he was a press attache at the. American
Smbassy in Paris, a reporter for "The Washington Post" newspaper here in Washington

and an office poy-libr arian for Roger Baldwin, Director of the American Civil Liberties
Jnion in New York City. In 1951 he was the subject of a special inquiry - State Department

nvestigation conducted by this Bureau reflecting generally the foregoing information. In
'.951 his name came up on several occasions in connection with a leak of classified information
_which appeared in a "Newsweek" magazine article. There was some indication that the
_ 'Newsweek" story was an intentional leak of information by y he. Administration. It is noted
hat Mr. Bradlee was an extremely close associate of the 1 se (BYe: ident Kennedy, vii iguing

RE: BENJAMIN C. BRADLEE i ip
eanryVie o . m
1 With regard to "Newsweek" magazine, we have had our ups ai and downs 5
j wer the years in our relations. In the past several years "Newsweek" hasAakel ov over by’
ithe owners of "The Washington Post'' newspaper. We have had friendly relations with a
umber of individuals connected with "Newsweek" particularly Raymond Moley who is known
to the Director on a first-name basis. Over the years we have furnished some degree of
cooperationto "Newsweek" magazine. In years gone by we have had correspondence with
MalcolakMuir, former President of the publication pertaining to inaccurate information
concerning the Bureau which appearéed-inthe "Periscope" section of the publication. Also,
in 1959 there was a typographical error in an article concerning ''The FBI Story"' movie for
which Mr. Muir apologized. :

ay. Brddlee pointed out that Gray is comparatively new with itNewsweek"' and was
forme: érly a reporter for the '!St. Louis Post-Dispatch!! in St. Louis. He also pointed out /
that Gray has had occasion to work with you (Mr. DeLoach) and other members of the Burea-
His dealings with your office gave every indication that he is favorably disposed toward the
Bureau and in 1962 the Director wrote the suburban news editor of the''St. Louis Post-Dis-\-
Patch" thanking him for the very favorable article prepared by William S:yGray entitled, <
"Policemen of Many Communities Trained by FBI in Use of Arms." It is noted that the SAC
at St. Louis worked with Mr. Gray in preparation of this article and that Office had no
information of a derogatory nature concerning him at that time. Our relations have been
circumspect since 1940 with the'St. Louis Post-Dispatch" due to unfavorable stories; how-
ever from time to time certain representatives of its staff have prepared favorable stories
about FBI facilities.

Ke : - ‘Mr. Bradlee mentioned that the story assignment would be given to Mr. om

OBSERVATION:

f this article. Bradlee and Gray appear to be favorably disposed toward the Bureau and
ave been friendly. In as much as the magazine plans to do this article on the Director any-
ay we would gain nothing by not cooperating, and on the other hand through cooperation

e could perhaps exercise some degree of control over the article. You could go over this
atter with Bradlee and determine in detail just what he desires. aes

It would appear that we should cooperate with ''Newsweek" in the preparation
:

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1, That the Director approve cooperation with 'Newsweek" magazine in the
| preparation of a cover story on the Director which that publication is already beginning to
: prepare.

i 2. Ifthe Director approves, you (Mr. DeLoach) should contact Mr. Bradlee
‘ and work out with him ‘the details of the matter, at the same time acknowledging Bradice’s

I called Ben Bradlee, Washington Bureau Chief, "Newsweek" Magazine,
on Monday, 11/16/64, concerning his letter to the Director dated November 10th, in
which he requested cooperation regarding a cover story of the Director.

Itold Mr. Bradlee that the Director appreciated his interest, and that :
of "Newsweek, " and that my call to him could be considered acknowledgment’ of his‘ letter |
of November 10, 1964, Itold Mr. Bradlee that we have had some very unhappy !
.. experiences with a small number of national publications who had professed great :
admiration and affection, yet had then turned around and stabbed the FBI in the back ona 4
very unjustifiable basis. Bradlee replied that this was not his intentions. He statéd.
that "Newsweek" would be very honest and aboveboard and would call the shots as they
saw them. He stated that he had every intention of completely honoring the Director's
birthday which would occur on January 1, 1965. He added that his reports would
be entirely objective.

Mr. Bradlee stated that he hoped he would have our cooperation. I
told him that the Director, of course, desires to be of assistance; however, it appeared
that "Newsweek" had already started interviewing a large number of individuals through-
out the United States. Itold Mr. Bradlee that we had heard from a number of former il
Special Agents in Charge (Harvey Foster and Don Hostetter), as well as other individuals, -
who had already been interviewed concerning the Director. Bradlee stated they perhaps
had jumped the gun on the basis the Director would have no objections to an article being

prepared. EX LS -REC.g GF yg :

Bradlee stated he wanted to reiterate once again that they were not trying © |
to do a hatchet job. He added that they planned to assign a reporter by the name of Gray

who is entirely favorable to the FBI. I told Mr. Bradlee that I ine eeeeiavand would

back regarding this matter.

"Newsweek." Iselin has advised Hostetter that he plans also to interview L. B.“Nichol .

Harvey’ Foster and Spencer\Drayton while in New York. Hostetter wanted to know if
it would be all right to be interviewed. He also wanted to know if there was any
particular point we wanted him to get across. I briefed him generally regarding this
matter. Hostetter told me that he had advised Iselin that he had the highest regard and
respect for the Director and the FBI and that if "Newsweek" planned to do a hatchet
job that they were wasting their time interviewing him (Hostetter). I thanked Hostetter
.. for his interest in this regard. 7
tthe Director may desire to indicate a time convenient to him when J
could bring a Newsweek" photographer over to take the color shot in question.

I discussed this matter with pen Bradlee, Washington Bureau. Chief,

"Newsweek, " on 11/19/64 and again on 11/20/64, Bradlee has now indicated that j

the cover of thegr publication, Bradlee assures me that it will take only a few minutes

and as a matter of fact, he desires to come in personally with the photographer to make

certain that a good job is done. He mentioned that by him being allowed to shake hands

of the Director being interviewed by a "Newsweek" reporter. He indicated they would

undoubtedly do it to anyone for personal reasons."

Moyers stated the President wanted to get this word to us so we would

erroneous statements about Oswald and Ruby.

In connection with the "Newsweek" story earlier this month on the Director,
former SAC Harvey- Foster had been contacted by Iselin for some of Foster*s views when
he was with the FBI, Foster gained the impression that Iselin was objective, fair and high-
-minded and appeared to be interested in doing a factual,objective story on’the Director and
the FBI.

Leste Berns: ee

We have no record in Bureau files on Berns; however, a check of the "News- _
week” masthead’ reveals that Lester Bernstein is one of its Senior Editors. We have
never conducicd an investigation of him and our contacts with him have been limited, He
was given a tour of FBI facilities on 3-26-63, while accompanied by his two sons, at
which time Bernstein was identified as National Sales Editor of "Newsweek." The tour
was arranged by "Newsweek's" Washington office. Bernstein wrote Mr, DeLoach a very
cordial letter for the courtesies extended on the tour, which was acknowledged by the
Director by letter dated 4-10-63. The New York Office contacted Bernstein in July, 1964,
in connection with the diary of Oswald being leaked to certain news media, Bernstein was
cooperative during this contact.

Osborn Elliott, editor of
. Newsweek, is standing pat on
the story the magazine pud-
lished Dec. 7 that President
Johnson has decided he must
find a new chief of the FBI to

replace J. Edgar Hoover.
The editor’s stand is in the
; .face of a White Hotse denial
and a charge by Clyde Tolson,
FBI Associate Director, that.
the magazine's cover story on
his boss represents “a new low

in reporting.”

Mr. Elliott told E&P: “It is
the kind of a story you expect
+, Will be denied. It is part of the

egme. ;
No Reason to Retract
““Our information from the:

reliable source we see no reason
to retract.”
Newsweek’s Washington Bu-
reau Chief, Ben Bradlee, added
. that “sometimes you are so far
ahead of a story that you can
be denied. There can be some
truth in the denial without less
truth in the original statement.”
Stating “a search was on” for
.. @ successor to Mr. Hoover, the
magazine reported it would be
. 1a difficult job to find the right
“person. It was generally agreed
}by those close to the story that
‘its publication probably has
! prolonged Mr. Hoover's tenure.
.'_As to Mr. Tolson’s criticism,
Mr. Elliott said: “This story
for us represented perhaps a
new high in the number of peo-
ple interviewed for a cover
‘story, the number of crackpot
critics of the FBI ignored, and
the amount of legitimate criti-
cism checked with FBI sources.”
Mr. Elliott produced the file
of information dug up by News-
week reporters from which the
final piece was written. It was
five inches.thick and a conserva-

«words was between 100,000 and
150,000. The printed story ran
{5,500-words,

How the letter from Mr. Tol-
son became public has elements
of mystery surrounding it. Mr.
Elliott said it was his policy not

to make public the contents of
a letter of this sort.

Director at FBI headquarters,
said an Associated Press report-

by quoting parts of the letter,
convinced him that it was in

This was on Sunday, Dee. 6.

AP then contacted Mr. Elliott
at his New York home. He
didn’t have a copy there of his ~

that in it he said the magazine

with him on the assassination
of his brother. A copy of Mr.

Mr, Tolson took specific ob- |

jections to several parts of the
_ Newsweek story.

Search for a successor.
George Reedy, Président. John-
- son’s press secretary, said the
magazine should have checked
with the White House. Mr. El-
liott: “I responded thet our in-
formation to this effect had

indeed come from 2 most re-
. sponsible White House source.”

Loan of FBI representatives
to Rep. John J. Rooney (D-
-N.Y.), head of a House appro-
priations committee. Mr. El-
Tiott: “It was confirmed by a

member of the FBI. This week
@ different and authoritative
source informed us that six

“Seents are so assigned, not

five.”

About FBI statistics. Mr.
“Elliott: “We examined — and
ignored—the major criticism we
found, an unpublished study

. prepared for the Bureau of the
Budget by. Professor | Harry
Manuel Shulman of New York.
We felt that Mr. Warren Ol-
ney’s past and present stature
was such that his criticism de-
served notice.”

. Mr. DeLoach said he wel-
‘comed the Newsweek reporters
lat FBI ‘headquarters and gave
‘them all possible cooperation.
Mr. Bradlee agreed with this
istatement, William Gray spent
“about a week anda half at FBI
loffices., He was assisted by Jay.

drnehene :

eeness-sesponsible for*rewrit
ing the story were Dwight Mar-
tin and Lester Berns.

Mr. Elliott said that the story
was originally scheduled to ap--
pear in January to coincide
with Mr. Hoover's Toth birth-

ay.

Timing Changed

“Then a rush of events caused
us to change our timing,” he QD
said. “First came the Warren
Commission's criticism of the
FBI's role in events preceding
the assassination of President
Kennedy. Then came the FBI’s
leak of Hoover's testimony to
the commission. Finally, there
was the extraordinary inter-
view with newspaper women
during which Hoover called
Martin Luther King, ‘the most
notorious liar in the land’ :

“Our exhaustive research was
well under way so we advanced
our schedule. We published the
facts in the full expectation
that they would be denied by
the White House as well as the
FBI, And so they were. How
could the FBI be expected to:
do anything else? And how,!
for that matter, could the White :
House, until 2 successor was!
found?

“It’s all_part of the game.
Although I must say it’s not
always the pleasantest thing in
the world to be called a liar in |
public=~particularly when so”
jmany people have worked so
long and hard to make sure
you're-telling the truth®— =>"

In the appendices to referenced letter of May 14,’ 1975,
the Senate Select Commitice requested a list of Cointelpro-type actiy- L
ity effected subsequent to April 28, 1971, In connection with that
request, we did review our files and contacted knowledgeable person-
nel of the Intelligence Division and, by memoranduia dated June 23,
1975, we advised of our inability to locate any information indicating -
authorization of any Cointelpro-type activity after April 28, 1971,
However, during our subsequent reviews of documents relating to
other requests of the Senate Select Committee, we have located two
documents requesting actions which were authorized and which possi- 7
bly could be construed as falling within the category of "Cointelpro-
type activity." Both of these actions were authorized by former
Director J. Edgar Hoover in February of 1972, but they were not
authorized under the then discontinued Counter intelligence Program,

discontinuance of the programs in 1971, These are as follows:

Documents Pertaining to the "Huston Plan, "
Cointelpro, and Other Practices and Programs

Subsequent publication of the Klan's activities resulted in a number
of Klan officials ceasing thoir activities, and no information was
developed indicating the Klan was able to expose informants through
the use of the polygraph,

2. On February 29, 1972, FBIHQ responded to a
request of the Louisville Field Office, authorizing an anonymous
letter be forwarded to a Black Panther Party (GPP) office in
New York City. This anonymous letter contained a newspaper clip-
ping disercditing one Benjamin Franklin Simmons, a black extremist
endeavoring to affiliate with the Cleaver Faction of the BPP, fubse~-
quently it was determined that "seeds of doubt" concerning Sixamons'
leadership qualities had been planted at the Cleaver Faction
Headquarters,

information relating to the above proposals and
authorizations did not appear in any Cointelpro-type file of this
Bureau, ‘The proposals and authorizations were handied in substan-
tive organizational and individual files, and no copies were placed
into a Cointelpro file, The FGI comzaunications approving the two
actions were reviewed by various officials at FBIHQ, Office proce-
dures in effect in Dixector J, Edgar Hoover's office at the time
indicate both proposals were approved by Mr. Hoover. ;

The above referred-to authorizing documents were
reviewed by Miss Ruth McCord of the Director's office on 9/15/75
and she advised that according to the office procedures in effect in
1972 both the approving documents had been reviewed and signed
out of FBIHQ by Director Hoover. :

Reference is made to your memorandum of August 29, 1956
\ relative to the furnishing of names to the Internal Revenue Service
| of Communist Party functionaries who, because of their activity
in the Communist underground apparatus, may have failed to file
-incone tax returns in accordance with the laws of the United States.

7 This Division is of the opinion that the furnishing by
the Bureau to the Internal Revenue Service of the names of the

, Communist Perty leaders as set forth in your referenced memorandum
would have no detrimental effect upon the enfercement of the
internal security law ever, ib should be pointed out to

the Internal Rev that no affirnat: action should be
teken by that Ser t the eight individuals listed in

your menorandum ( lun; Gidney Resnick, Edward Eugene Strong,
Mex Norris Weiss, offxey Warner White, Sidney Liphires, Michael
Russo and Daniel Eoone Schimser) who have been indicted and arrested
for violetion of the Smith Act and are presently awaiting trial.

i 5 Before the Internal Revenue Service shovld take any action
| with respect to any of the aforementioned eight individuals, this

\ Division should be consulted for the purpose of determining whether
7 the contemplated action would in any way prejudice the pencing
“ : Smith Act prosecution involving those individuels.
