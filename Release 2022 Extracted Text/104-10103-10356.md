4. | 32016 left Havana for Madrid and London on 9. December,
flying by Air Cubana at whe invitation of the Cuban Govern~
ment: who 2lso said for her faro from Lina to Havana. she
was of course the guest of tha Cubana curing the month she
spent hore; a car and a iti “chaperone” were at her
constant disvosal. She wa, towever, far from being
ernbarrased by these aticnutiona and evidently coasidered
them no more than her cue since she was, in effect, working
for the Cuvans theasclves rather than on behalf of any:
foreign nouspspars, °

Be LT found SsvLC"inconsistest in her description of how

she had covered, her: tracks. ta uke sure. thit. hem Cubs visit
would not cone.to the attention of the Anericam: authorities.
The first tine we met she clained taat the arranzenonts for
her travel liad been made in virtually clandestine conditions
with Cuban officials accredited to the che was anyway
going to Yrazil end therefore selected Lima-iiavana route
as her Way into cuday. ag she explained, the cuban: inaisration
authorities were briefed not to mark her passport. -he
hogéd that by following a devious route*out of Cuba, she could
eventually arrive in the Jtatos without arousing suspicions
about were she had been in the previous two. months, But,
slightly contradicting this. arparent c:eern. to. conccaL her
Cub2 visit she sdmibtet -on-anolier occazioa-taat iv wis more
than ‘probable that the CIA would ruxble her end indeed, they
would know of her intention to coze to Cuba since she had
openly requested permission to travel froa the stato Departuent.
Ser application bad been refused, which, while it did not
surprise hers confirmed hor view thet the americnn authorities -
were determined to vintinise aor beceuse of her political
views: . certain other caterories of Americuns were being

-alloved by the state vepartment to travel to Cuba.

3. It was éviient froa-sUle's own nuditlcd and ‘confused
locic thet she is uotivated by a profound and: almost
vitriolic hatred of, as she put it, the Us Covernment and
its agencies,, whe repeatedly denigrated her Us citizenship,
oleinin- that it was the result of “an. accident of birta*.
Bhe insisted that in every other respect except her birth
certificate che was iatin American. (brazilian) and not
Azerican, fier referi:nces to her o,m 20 ‘seemed also,
to be slivhtly contemptuous; clearly her strongest
attachnant.is'to her futher whoz she described do tho only
exception in "a fumily of fascists". The neaber of the
fanily who anpears3 to be her pet hate was a grandfather
resident in razil who :orkxed for the Hereedes Bens coapany
and had soma responsibility for the production oF napala.
fo judse fron tae frequency with waich she discussed her
father, I sho:ld say ho has beon the strangest iuflacuse

on her, . Shey shoro such the saue politic:1 viewsoint «
gccording to ULC it was her futher's growing dislike of

the New York Tines' political position which persuaded
him to resign and follow his own bent as » fraclance..
They botn believed that a journalist should express his
own "personal" views instead of tuose of a particular
newspapers .

4, Tho abuse and vituperation which 52Uic poured out
agaiast the Us seemed ao illogical and ill-founced as hor
unguestioning assumption thot evrything about the Cuban
systen represented the nearest thit biman society had
come to Utouia. Her naive onthusiasn for vhat she was
shown in Cuba, and her dogmatic endorsement of it ally
excluded any ponsibility of her reaching an objective,
assessment. fox example, the <odor lo;ular systen
which she visited had fired her. imagination’ ani she
refused to consider any of ‘the sore negative aspects which
ht have inplied criticism of. the wuban cutanorities. °
Yo. may care to note that she intends: to: publish-an
article on Foder Fopular in Varaie magazine. (I would -
be interested to see a copy). ~

5. AS you usy know S2ULC was divorced (or sopirated).
from Surart BISHOP in 1972 after only 2 yesrs of aarriage.s,
Her husbund, she said, was a case for a psychoanalyst und
had. necdei a nother rather than-a. wifes... o-ULG still seomed
to be confused umi depressed over ths aarriage although 1
understand thit she hai taken the decision to end it
Nerself, Her educational buck:-round..seeastohave heen
vory viricd; apart: fron thc catablishasnts contioned an
ur traces she said she had attended the sritish school —
Rio de-daneiro (et. which she pickcd.up a phoney eaglish
accent she can still agsuce) and Berkeley University.

6 “I doubt whether the dividenis frou her visit weve as
good as she had expected. At our Lirst- encounter in the
appartaent of Oleute REGIN she sade extravagant cleizs
about. her mission «hich. sho-interpreted as being to assist
the Cubans in uncovering inforuation on CIA intelligence
activity on the island and -to ponetrate tae foreign and
diplom:tic community, for thin furzose.: (it may seen-
remarkable thit°she should have been 50 indiserect: but
I think the explanation lies priuarily.in her naivete
and ready assumption of a sympathetic audience, in a
desire to impress aad a loquacity induced.¢ither by
alcohol ox possibly by drugs of sone kind.) I: never
seemed to occur to her for a coment that im talking so
openly about the purzose of her visit she was in effect:
plowins herself... dowsver, unless she leurned erester
discretion duriag the four weeks she was here it would
appear unlikely that she cane anywhere new realising her
intentions. when we met on 3 iecenber sue told ne
spontaneously (after several stir rum coliins') that
although she bnd at last succcede. in making contact with
Cuban intelli:sence officers they were youn: in rienced
and were not at a nigh enough level for tie discussions.

[SHOccooe



she wished to have. She complained that she had spent
too mich tiwe with Nix officials who had no real idea
of the sain purrose of the visit and it hai tren avout
two weeks to cot tirouch te a ;erson with the arprovriate
responsibilities. Now that she was in touch wit tiis
individual she had asked for a ueeting with ne]
FISE1x0. (I do not know whetner sho saw PISEIRO before
she left, but I think it is unlikely). Up to that roint
&LULC bad passed the Cubans "useful" material on CLA
operations (mainly in Latin Auerica) but had received
very little in return. She was rather distressed by this
lsck of reciprocity, pointin; out to ma that she was after

. @ll on tho Cubans' gide and was offering then the
opportunity’ to embarrass the-Awericuns: >7 publication-of
d=nsging waterial. wever, judging fron ner ouphoria
when I saw.-her-vory briefly on 7 Decender.she-say: perhaps,
have rcceived*sonething further from the Cubana.

7. In any case, it seems sc may have been. less active
on the intelliscnce: front than she had expected. ani as far
ag I.know she nad little or no contact with zenbers of the
diplowatic conaunity. Nuch of her tine vas -eoent- outside
Havana visiting the irovinees and in particular Jiatanzas
where she waa allowed a detailed look at oder Popular,

first: Congress. of ‘the Cuban Gonmunist : arty.
