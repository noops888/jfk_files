AGENCY : HSCA

RECORD NUMBER : 180-10068-10348

RECORD SERIES : STAFF PAYROLL RECORDS

AGENCY FILE NUMBER

Released under the John F.

Lennedy assassination

Records Collection Act of

1992 (44 USC 2107 Note].

Case#: Nw 68261 Date:

09-01-2022

December 8, 1995

Status of Document:

Postponed in Part

Number of releases of previously postponed information: 20

Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors

including: (a) the significant historical interest in the document in question; (b) the

absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United

States or to any individual.

Number of Postponements: 8

Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.

Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could

reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that invasion of

privacy would be so substantial that it outweighs the public interest.

WASHINGTON. D.C. 20515

April 18, 1977

The Honorable Louis Stokes, Chairman

Select Committee on Assassinations

House of Representatives

Washington, D.C.

20515

Dear Mr. Chairman:

In keeping with the smaller staff than had

been originally planned for the Committee, I realize

that it has been necessary to eliminate certain

positions.

I was surprised when I learned that the

position which I now hold was one that had been

eliminated.

In order to assist the members of the Committee

staff in bringing about a smooth transition during

this period, I herewith tender my resignation to be

effective at your pleasure.

I am sure you realize, Mr. Chairman, that having

been the first person employed by the Committee after

its creation last year, this step is not taken without

considerable regret on my part.

However, I am confident

that the Committee,

under your leadership, will carry

through its mandate.

Consistent with the

remarks vou

made to the staff immediately following the resignation

of our Chief Counsel and Director, I request that the

voluntary pay reduction which I took along with other

members of the staff this year be reimbursed to me when

the Committee's funding has been accomplished.
