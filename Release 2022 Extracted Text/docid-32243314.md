Number of releases of previously postponed information: 20

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20515

April 18, 1977

The Honorable Louis Stokes, Chairman
Select Committee on Assassinations |
House of Representatives
Washington, D.C. 20515

| Dear Mr. Chairman:

| In keeping with the smaller staff than had
been originally planned for the Committee, I realize
| that it has been necessary to eliminate certain
| positions. I was surprised when I learned that the
i position which I now hold was one that had been
eliminated. |

| In order to assist the members of the Committee
and staff in bringing about a smooth transition during
this period, I herewith tender my resignation to be
effective at your pleasure.

I am sure you realize, Mr. Chairman, that having rt De
been the first person employed by the Committee after
its creation last year, this step is not taken without
considerable regret on my part. However, I am confident
that the Committee, under your leadership, will carry
through its mandate. Consistent with the remarks vou
made to the staff immediately following the resignation
of our Chief Counsel-and Director, I request that the
voluntary pay reduction which I took along with other
members of the staff this year be reimbursed to me when
the Committee's funding has been accomplished.
