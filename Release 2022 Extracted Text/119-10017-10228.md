SUBJECT: Rima ZMITROOK -- Lee Harvey OSWALD's
Intourist Guide in Moscow,

1, An official British source has advised us that they now
+ have additional information on Rima ZMITROOK nee SHIRAKOVA,
who was assigned as OSWALD's Intourist guide in Moscow in
October 1959,

2, SHIRAKOVA came to the attention of the British authorities
when she befriended two British brothers who first visited the Soviet
Union in 1960, She and a male guide joined the party with which the
brothers were travelling at the Russian border. One of the brothers
has ‘pursued the friendship more than the other and claims that his
relations with her have become affectionate, but platonic, In fact,
since he first met her, she has married and has hada child, They
have maintained a steady correspondence and he visits their home
when he goes to the- Soviet Union,

_ 3. After the birth of her daughter in October 1963, SHIRAKOVA
wrote and said that she had left Intourist and was employed as a
teacher of English in a Moscow teacher's training college,

4. The two brothers last visited the ZMITROOKs at their home
ina new housing estate in Moscow in 1965, One of the things Rima

ZMITROOK showed them was an album of colored postcards of
places in the United States which she claimed had been sent to her
by an American in return for money she had lent him when he was
visiting the Soviet Union and ran short of funds,

5, Rima ZMITROOK nee SHIRAKOVA was born on 18 January
1939 in Moscow. Her husband, Valeriy ZMITROOK, was born on
29 October 1937, They were married in 1963 and their daughter
Aleksandra (Sasha) was born on 29 October 1963, At the time that
the British brothers knew the ZMITROOKs, he (Valeriy) was an
engineering student, At that time the ZMITROOKs resided at
8 Viadimirskaya, Apartment 31, House 23, Moscow E - 123,

6. The name ZMITROOK is reported above as transmitted to
us by the British, We believe, however, that the ending syllable does
not represent a correct transliteration and may be an attempt to
record the name as given to the British phonetically, We believe the
proper transliteration would be ZMITRUK, Please note that the
British have also spelled the name as SMITROOK,

7. Going on the assumption that a destitute American would
turn to the Embassy for assistance, we would appreciate your checking
with the Embassy in Moscow, whether they could possibly identify
the American who ran short of funds and borrowed money from Rima
ZMITROOK, Based on the information supplied by the British, we
would presume that the American borrowed the money from her some-
time before she left Intourist in 1963, We would also appreciate your

asking the Embassy if they have any other information on the ZMITROOKs, ey
