MEMORANDUM FOR: |] DO/LA

Fred Wickham, DO/IMS

FROM: John F. Pereira
Chief, CSI/HRG

SUBJECT: Priority Request from Chairman,
JFK Assassination Records Board

1. (S) The purpose of this memorandum is to advise you of a
priority request from the Chairman of the JFK Assassination Records
Review Board (ARRB). The request concerns records related to Lee
Harvey Oswald that may be held by the Mexican Government.

2. (S) At his initiative, I met recently with the ARRB
Chairman, Judge John Tunheim. He said the reason for the meeting was
to ask that CIA assist the Board by making inquiries © to
determine if the Mexican Government has certain records related to
Oswald’s activities in Mexico in late 1963. Of particular interest
to the Board is whether the Mexicans have copies
tel-tap) operations, including coverage of Oswald’s telephone ca.

© the Soviet Embassy. He said that locating such records is “the
highest priority of the Board.” (The attached letter from the
ARRB’s General Counsel explains the Board’s interest.)

3. (S) Earlier this year, the Board sought. unsuccessfully
to obtain information about Oswald from the Mexican Government
via the State Department. (See attached cable.) Mexico responded
by providing copies of the same material that had been made
available to the Warren. Commission in 1964. The problem for the

Board was that, in making the recmest to Mexico._it did not want
to reveal information fabout. that “7

the Board knew of from CIA records. Being sensitive to the
Agency's request to protect this information, Tunheim would like
the Agency to contact directly on the Board’s
behalf.
