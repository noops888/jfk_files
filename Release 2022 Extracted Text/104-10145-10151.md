This would be in addition to any classified information which we might

have on Cuban activities in the Hemisphere. I told him that we would do

whatever we could and relayed the requirement on to Bob Hepworth, NFAC/CSS,

who said that there was precious little by way of useful overt information an

Cuban activities in the Hemisphere.
