Dear Mike:

This will confirm our telephone conversation con-
cerning the procedure whereby we will make available to
you, or your designee, copies of draft reports relating
to the Justice Department. As we discussed, the pur-
pose is so that any classification (or other such
problems, e.g., the identity of informers) which may be
inadvertently taised in our reports can be identified.

The first two drafts relating to the FBI are ready. .
They are: :
1. "The Use of Informers in FBI Domestic

Investigations"; and

2. “Domestic CIA and FBI Mail Opening Programs".
(Substantial portions of which relate to the
FBI.) :

I would appreciate it if someone very promptly could con-
tact Frederick D. Baron, my assistant (224-1746) , who
will arrange the details of location and time for the
review.

Sincerely yours,

to Jim Adams about the remarks made by Senator Morgan.

i have seen him briefly since he made these remarks and

these remarks at some length. As noted in his response to
7 apparently he has come to this feeling as a result of the
" matters which he has had reported

to him asa member of the Senate Select Committee. It is
true that some mistakes of the Bureau were brought out, but

well above that which could even be expected of us and cer-
tainly has been most. contributory to the safety of this nation:
throughout.the years.'.To categorize us as "rotten to the core"
and to.indicate that we are a great threat to the United States
miss the mark tremendously and are completely without foun-
dation.’ I will so inform him, but apparently he has made up —
his mind and there is little likelihood that we will have a
convert

An SSC Executive Session was held from approximately
10:55 a.m., until 12:45 p.m., 2/13/76. Representing the SSC
were Chief Counsel Frederick A. 0. Schwartz, Jxv., who acted bine

that this was a continuation of the Executive Session on 2/6/76

the Bureau's responsibility for domestic intelligence investiga~

and the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) had been involved in
planning or organizing numerous large demonstrations in the
country and he desired to continue this discussion. A list of
major demonstrations with resulting damages and arrests which
occurred in the U.S. during the past ten years involving
subversive groups was furnished by Mr. Shackelford. A
discussion followed regarding the role of the FBI in gathering
intelligence information concerning the demonstratiors as well
as the dissemination of the information which had been obtained.
Mr. Schwartz questioned the authority of the FBI in investigating
infiltrated groups such as the National Peace Action Coalition
(NPAC) and the Peoples Coalition for Peace and Justice (PCPJ)
even though both groups were either dominated or Jnfiuerced’

by the CPUSA or the SWP.

A discussion then followed as to what effect the
enactment of the Privacy Act has on the investigation by the
FBI of domestic subversive groups. A request was made
concerning instructions which have been sent to the field by
FBIHQ concerning this matter.

The Session then turned to investigation of extremist
groups and the use of informants in these groups to obtain
advance information to prevent acts of violence. Specific
cases of this type were read into the record by Mr. Deegan.
Mr. Gitenstein questioned the authority of the Bureau to
Place informants into these extremist groups without the
ingredient of violence present.

This Executive Session was adjourned at approximately
12:45 p.m. and no request was made at that time for another
Executive Session.

OBSERVATIONS :

From statements made by Mr. Schwartz and other SSC
staff members present, with the possible exception of Mr. Mark
Gitenstein, it appeared that these individuals continue to be
opposed to legislation authorizing Bureau investigations in the
domestic intelligence area unless the threat of violeme is
imminent. Mr. Gitenstein in his discussion concerning the use

of informants in extremist groups appeared to want to
include in the record acts of violence which have been
prevented because of infiltration by informants in these
groups. It does appear, therefore, that he may be more
favorably inclined towards the Bureau's position in these
matters.

RECOMMENDATION:
That the SSC Unit, Intelligence Division, communicate

with a member of the SSC staff regarding Privacy Act material

This is to call to your attention a most serious PA zi

material and information that this Bureau has furnished to a 4
the U. S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. Enclosed ay @

forth this incident in detail for the SSC, states the Qo °

George F. Dorsett was an FBI informant from
January, 1959, to October, 1970. He was discontinued as an
informant when his activity in the Klan ceased, at which timg
his relationship with the Bureau continued to be excellent. He
has not been disclosed publicly as an FBI informant. Dorsett did
in fact separate from the United Klans of America (UKA) and
form the Confederate Knights of the Ku Klux Klan (CKKKK). He
formed the CKKKK on his own initiative; however, we utilized
this opposing Klan organization through Dorsett as a means
of disrupting and causing confusion and dissension within the

The Attorney General

The handling agent assisted Dorsett in
preparing a letter announcing his resignation from the UKA
and his formation of the CKKRK. This letter invited Dorsett's
friends in the Kian to join him in the CKKKK. A total of
41 chapters of the CKKKK were chartered; however, all of them
did not become effective operating chapters.

The documents delivered to the SSC were excised to
delete Dorsett's name as an informant. Charlotte airtel dated
éugust 22, 1967, and CG. D. Brennan memorandum to W. C. Sullivan
dated August 24, 1967, set forth the recommendation and
approval for the mailing of a letter from Dorsett to all Kian
units in North Carolina announcing his resignation from the UKA
and the formation of the CKKKK. Dorsett's name is deleted fron
these documents; however, it is clear that the informant was
preparing the letter. Charlotte airtel to the Director
September 13, 1967, refers to the Aupust 22, 1967, Charlotte
airtel and states that the referenced airtel recommended Bureau
approval for a letter to be mailed over the signature of
Reverend George F. Dorsett under the above conditions, Dorsett's
name is not deleted from this document. From the above
documents Dorsett's identity can readily be established as the
FRI informant.

In the December 6, 1975, issue of the "Charlotte
Observer" a daily Charlotte, North Carolina, morning
newspaper there is a front page article captioned "FBI Started
41 North Carolina Klan Units, Morgan Says." In this article,
North Carolina Senator Robert Morgan, momber of the SSC, said
the FBI organized 41 KKK units in North Carolina during the 1960's
as part of its campaign against the white supremacist group.
Morgan was also quoted as saying, "The vast majority of
people in the Klan in North Carolina were law-abiding eitizens.

NW 65360 Docld:32989578 Page 17


The Attorney General

There may have been some violence, but we're not even sure
about that now."" Morgan is further quoted as saying, ‘There
is nothing basically wrong with having an informer in any
organization but when these informers do more than just Listen,
when they instigate trouble, that's wrong." Morgan also said
the FBI financed the operations of the Federally organized
Klaverns. :

As set forth in the enclosed memorandum, Ir. Dorsett
was interviewed on December 12, 1975, by Charlotte, North
Carolina, FBI Agents at which time he expressed his concern
for his personal safety and for his family as well, as well as
concern for the safety of his personal property.

4s stated above this matter is considered to be a
most serious breach of the confidentiality that must be afforded
the material and information that this Bureau has furnished to
the U. S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. It is
respectfully requested that the enclosed memorandum be
delivered to Senator Frank Church, Chairman of the SSC,
personally. Please advise what action is taken concerning
this matter.

RE: U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE TO STUDY
GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS WITH RESPECT
TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

"FBI documents obtained by the committee indicate
that Dorsett, who was disenchanted with KKK Grand Dragon
J. Robert Jones of Granite Quarry end with Imperiel Wizard
Robert Shelton of Tuscaloosa, Ala., was encouraged by the FBI
to leave the Klan in the summer of 1967 and form the
Confederate Knights ofthe Ku Klux Klan. The FBI helped
Dorsett draft.letters recruiting for the new group, according
to the committee source.

“According to the documents, the FBI's plan was to
harass the KKK and to dilute the influence of the United Klans
and to keep closer tabs on the new group.

"Sen. Robert Morgan, D. N.C., a member of the
committee said last week that charters for some 41 new Klaverns
or chapters of the Confederate Klan were issued, but that not
all charters resulted in active new Klan groups."

A review of meteriel delivered to the staff of the
Committee has determined that Committee Staff Member Barbara
Banoff accepted on August 28, 1975, copies of 212 seriels
releting. to White Hate matters under the COINTELPRO requests
of the Committee. The following documents were included
among these 212 serisls:

Letter from SAC, Charlotte, to Director, FBI,
captioned 'Counterintelligence Program, Internal Security,
Disruption of Hate Groups (Confederate Knights of the Ku

A careful reading and comperison of these. documents
would lead to the identity of Dorsett as an FBI informant in
the manner described in the above article, The fectual material
set forth in the article is contained in the above documents.
It is noted that the documents as delivered to the Committee
do not identify Mr. Dorsett as an FBI informent; however,. his
identity can be deduced from the combined documents. Our
records do not indicete that Mr. Dorsett's identity as an
informant has been disclosed in eny other manner, Mr. Dorsett
was interviewed by FBI Agents of the Charlotte, North Caroline,
FBI Office on December 12, 1975. Mr. Dorsett stated that
he felt "betrayed" by his government concerning the public
disclosure in the news media of his identity as en FBI source.
He recalled that he had always been assured that his identity

‘\,would elways remein confidentiel end known only to the FBI.
‘He further stated thet as a result of the public disclosure of
his identity es an FBI source in the "Greensboro Daily News"
on Recember 10, 1975, he has experienced great consternation
among his close friends and members of his family. He has
received harassing telephone calls. During one of these calls
the caller stated, “Tell that pimp to get his casket ready."
Mr, Dorsett expressed his concern for the personal safety
of himself end members of his’ family, es well as concern for
the safety of his residence and personel property.

FE: U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE TO STUDY
GOVERMMENTAL OPERATIONS WITH RESPECT
TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (Ssc)

The disclosure of the identity of FBI informants
places these informants’ lives in serious jeopardy as weil
as subjecting them and their families to the Likelihood of
embarrassment and harassment within their communities.

Such disclosures have a most serious and detrimental effect

on other informants, who have just cause to question the
security of their past or present association with the FBI.
fersons who might otherwise be inclined to furnish information
to the FBI, expecting their cooperation to be kept in ©
confidence, are reluctant to do so when they see such
violations of the sanctity of FBI files and information.

The PBI has endeavored to cooperate fully and
eandidly in making available to the Committee the documents
and information requested by the Committee. We have
insisted that the confidentiality of informants be
maintained. In view of this most serious breach of the
confidentiality of information furnished by the FBI to the
Committee and in an effort to determine the nature of it,
you are requested to advisé whether the U. S. Senate Select
Committee on Intelligence or any member or staff member thereof,
is responsible for the public disclosure of former FBI ‘
informant George F. Dorsett as alleged and if so, the basis for
such disclosure.

At 2:45 p.m. on 1/27/76, Michael Epstein, Staff Member
of captioned Committee, requested that Harold N. Bassett, Assistant
Director of thé Inspection Division, or some other Bureau official
familiar with inspection procedures be made available for a briefing
with that Committee on 1/28/76 and to appear in executive session at
10 a.m. on 1/29/76. The topic of the briefing and testimony will be
the Bureau's inspection procedures.

Epstein contacted SA Paul V. Daly of this Division on
1/28/76 and indicated he would desire that the briefing take place
in the Committee's space at 1:30 p.m. on this date. He stated it
would not be necessary for Assistant Director Bassett to be familiar
with any particular matters reviewed by the Inspection Division but
rather address, in general, the inspection policies and procedures.
Epstein stated the executive session which was to begin at 10 a.m.
on 1/29/76 would consist of Assistant Director Bassett and former
Acting Associate Director W. Mark Felt appearing in a panel ar-
ratigement. Assistant Director Bassett would be asked questions’
at the executive session concerning inspection procedures.

f pas] Scheduled to follow Assistant Director Bassett as
witnesses before the Committee in that same executive session at
1 a.m. are Michael E. Shaheen, Jr., in his role as Counsel on
‘Professional Responsibility and Glen E. Pommerening, Assistant
| Attorney General for Administration. 4

On 1/28/76, Epstein advised SA Daly that Assistant
Director Bassett's appearance in executive session before that
Committee was being rescheduled for 2 p.m. on 1/29/76 because of
a schedule conflict. He subsequently advised that the Staff
briefing had to be postponed because Epstein determined he had a
prior commitment. Epstein, in the late afternoon of 1/28/76, hd

Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams
RE: SENSTUDY 75

advised that he had to again postpone the executive session
testimony of Assistant Director Bassett because of scheduling
conflicts and that the testimony would be sometime during the
week of 2/2/76. He could not give a definite time nor assure
that the testimony would take place during that week.

On the morning of 1/29/76, Epstein requested that
Assistant Director Bassett appear in executive session at 2 p.m.
on 2/3/76 to give his requested testimony. After consultation
with Assistant Director Bassett, Epstein was advised that As-
sistant Director Bassett had delayed his departure from Washington,
D. C., to conduct Bureau business in order to be available for
testimony and that on two separate occasions. the Committee had
found it necessary to reschedule his testimony. He was advised
that Assistant Director Bassett would be available during the
week of 2/9/76 and that we requested he be given the opportunity
to testify during that week or some other mutually agreeable time.
Epstein stated that it was the intention of the Committee to go
forward on 2/3/76 without Assistant Director Bassett and mentioned
that former Acting Associate Director W. Mark Felt who had been
head of the Bureau's Inspection Division would be available to
testify concerning this matter. It was pointed out to Epstein
that Mr. Felt is no longer with the FBI and is not in a position
to act as spokesman for Bureau inspection policies and procedures
which are currently in existence under Director Kelley. Epstein
again indicated that the Committee would go on without a Bureau
representative.

John T. E1liff, Director of the Domestic Task Force of
the Senate Select Committee, was immediately contacted and advised
of Epstein's decision and the background concerning this matter.
Elliff£ was advised that the Committee certainly would want ali the
information available concerning inspection procedures in the
Bureau to get a fair picture of this area of Bureau operations.
ELLif£E£ agreed and stated he would insure Assistant Director Bassett
would be given the opportunity to testify as to the Bureau's current
inspection procedures and policies. This testimony, however, may
not be at the same time as the appearance of W. Mark Felt, et al.

: You were previously advised by my letter dated 7
January 23, 1976, of recent allegations against the FBI ca
relating to the Secret Army Organization (SAO) that ‘
peared in a series of articles beginning January 11, :
1976, in the "San Diege Union" Newspaper. These articles
alleged the FBI created and financed the SAO and controlled |
the activities of this group through an informant, Howard Barry ,\>
Godfrey, who was a leader of this organization. You were ‘)

also advised the inquiry being conducted concerning these allega
tions had thus far indicated they were unfounded.

x
a
This is to advise you that our inquiry into
this matter has been completed. This inquiry which |
included a review of all pertinent court records and

FBI Headquarters and San Diego Field Office files reveals
allegations against the FBI, concerning our investigation

of the SAO, are without merit and clearly shows the FBI

did not organize, control, or finance the SAO. Information ,
we received concerning illegal activities conducted or

planned by the SAO was immediately disseminated to

appropriate law enforcement agencies.

In the above-mentioned series of articles
there were certain allegations made by former SAO members
and associates when interviewed by newspaper reporter Patrick
Dillon. These individuals previously expressed a desire
to the news media to discredit Godfrey, or had been found
guilty following legal proceedings in which Godfrey was
an important witness. Allegations made by them to Mr. Dillon

The Attorney General

(1) Godfrey assigned SAO members to kidnap antiwar
demonstrators during the 1972 Republican National Convention
planned for San Diego, (2) Godfrey threatened and pressured

| SAO members into committing acts of violence, (3) Godfrey
was involved in criminal acts which included breaking into
school offices, firebombing vehicles, and making threatening
calls.

One individual who made allegations against Godfrey,
when interviewed by Mr. Dillon, also testified during the trial
of an SAO member that he was responsible for the sale of between
$10,000 and $20,000 worth of weapons and explosives to Godfrey.
This person later entered a guilty plea in court, State of
California, for the charge of perjury in connection with this
testimony.

The extensive review of pertinent FBI and court
documents, mentioned above, produced no information to
substantiate or refute these allegations. However, it
should be noted no information to document or substantiate
these allegations has been produced.

In view of the above we contemplate no further inquiry
in this matter.

NOTE:

By letter dated 1/23/76, the Attorney General was
advised of articles appearing in "San Diego Union" Newspaper
q alleging Bureau organized, financed and controlled the SAO.
; The Attorney General was advised preliminary inquiries
determined there was no basis for allegations, however,
additional inquiries were being conducted. Instant letter
is follow-up letter to advise Attorney General of results
of additional inquiries.

indicates City Councilman Floyd Morrow willl
propose council resolution on 1/29/76 ;
requesting SSC conduct hearings and have
representative from city of San Diego on |.
the "Senate Committee” to obtain data gained
by the panel in its hearings. It is also
reported SSC investigator Arthur Jefferson
| departed San Diego for Los Angeles on
| 1/27/76. He is going to probe FBI activities
pertaining to two rival black extremist
groups. This involved killing of two Black
Panther Party (BPP) members during eal

eee

with US members on UCLA campus in 1/69.
The "Union" article also states City
Councilman Leon Williams met for more tha
an hour 1/27/76 with Jefferson and told
Jefferson he attempted to mediate a feud
between BPP and US in San Diego in 1969.
Willzams claimed he was infotmed by two
city officials, the former police Chief and
the- former city manager, that FBI told them
BPP planned to assassinate Williams. The

; and the former city manager both deny
making such statement to Williams.
Williams claims he told Councilman Morrow
at the time and Morrow claims he recalls
being so advised.

SAC Ronald L. Maley, San Diego,
telephonically contacted by Intelligence
Division Night Supervisor F. Anthony
Tansey, stated San Diego FBI personnel
knowledgeable of facts do not recall any
such incident or notice to former offi-
cials or Williams; and, if FBI had know-

|| ledge of such a plot, all knowledgeable
employees believe Williams, himself, would
have been notified directly.

San Diego is currently reviewing perti-
nent files for any information to prove or
disprove Williams’ statement and a teletype
will be submitted with pertinent facts on
1/29/76.

Upon receipt of the teletype from
San Diego, you will be advised whether or
not San Diego did have knowledge of any
plot against Williams and whether anyone,
including Williams, was alerted to such

information.

"This is to advise of our interpretation of analytical infor-
mation relating to our discoptinued Counterintelligence Programs
(Cointelpros) prepared by the Senate Select Committee (SSC).

nl,

On 2/2/76 the Department made available for our review
anumber of FBI documents the SSC intends te publish in connection
with its forthcoming report. Included with the material were three
SSC prepared charts (copies attached) analyzing the same five basic
domestic Cointelpros which were reviewed in 1974 by the Department
Study Co.amittee on FBI Cointelpros (Petersen Committee), The
statistics utilized by the SSC in compiling the charts differ from
those reported by the Petersen Committee, and the SSC has also
established different categories for characterizing Cointelpro actions
than used in the Petersen report. The following is a description of
the three SSC charts,

| 1, Cointelpro Composite (SSC Exhibit 10), ‘This chart
lists seven basie categories for the 2, 679 Cointelpro actions
tabulated by the SSC, it being noted this is 310 more actions than
calculated by the Petersen Committee. The first three categories,
(1) Attacks on Speaking, Teaching, Writing, and ifeeting; (2) inter-
ference w/Personal and Economic Rights; and (3) Abuse of Government
Processes, place appreximately 925 of the Cointelpro actions in an
area indicating FBI violation of constitutional rights with possible
erlminal and elvil Mabllity. The fourth category, Third Party Hostile,

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: Cointelpros
§2~116009

apparently indicates Cointelpro actions Uirected to cause hostile
action to a target, probably by third parties. Categories 5 and 6,
Factionalization and Propaganda, represent approximately 1, 550

of the total actions, appear to relate to efforts of the FBI to cause
dissension within organizations or to expose through publicity the
activities of a targeted group or individual. The seventh category,
Cominfil, undoubtedly is a reference to F3I efforts to expose or
disrupt communist efforts to infiltrate a noncommunist organization,
it heing noted this category is only tabulated for the Communist Party,
USA, Program.

The SSC categories differ from those of the Petersen
report in that the first three clearly are in terms indicating a viola-
tion of First Amendment rights with possible criminal and/or civil
liability. The four other categories do not necessarily indicate
eriminal or civil wrongdoing, but probably indicate actions outside
the charter of the FBI, Regarding the Cominfil category, the SSC
has been critical of our use of "Communist Infiltration" which the
Committee views as a pretext for such investigations as those
involving the Southern Christian Leadership Conference,

Martin Luther King, Poor Peoples March, and Women's Liberation
ovement,

2. Cointelpro Categories by Program (SSC Exhibit 11).
This chart consists of five individual charts representing the basic
domestic Cointelpros and graphically illustrates the characterizations
of actions conducted in each program.

The five charts illustrate the differences in the figures
for Cointelpro actions as tabulated by the Petersen Committee and
the SSC, These are as follows.

3. Cointelyro Activity (SSC Exhibit 22). This chart
endeavors to tabulate the number of Cointelpro actions for each pro-
gram on a quarterly basis for each year from 1956 to 1971, The
chart indicates approximately 60 percent of all Cointelpro actions
were condacted inthe Communist Party Program which in two
quarters reached approximately 75 actions and which was most
active during the period 1960 to 1967, The chart also indicates all
the programs except the Black Nationalist commenced to taper
down in terms of actions beginning in or before 1969, The Black
Nationalist Cointelpro was active up until 1971 with some 40 actions
effected in the last quarter af 1970,

OBSERVATIONS:

While the Petersen Committee report attempted to place
Cointelpro activity in 12 descriptive categories, the SSC, according
to the Cointelpro composite chart, obviously is endeavoring to.
characterize the actions to highlight alleged abuses and possible
criminal or civil liability. Categories 1, 2 and 3 place approximately

Memorandum to Mr. W, R. Wannall
Re: Cointelpros
62116009

34 percent of all Cointelpro actions within areas of constitutional or
statutory violation, obviously indicating possible criminal or civil
liability, This indicates the thrust of the forthcoming SSC ) report,
as relates to our discontinued Cointelpros, will either criticize the
Petersen Committee report as an inadequate review or one possibly
based on incomplete information, ‘Fhe SSC very likely intends to
dispute the Petersen Committee report conclusion that the "over-
whelming bulk of these activities were clearly legitimate and proper
undertakings, within the scope of the FBI's ongoing responsibilities, "
and to characterize the activities as criminal or civil violations of
individual rights ox - outside the mandate or charter of the FBL

We may expect the SSC, in its forthcoming report, as
was done in public hearings, to highlight FGI Cointelpro abuses using
selected documentation from FBI files to support its conclusion. It
is likely the SSC will recommend legislation to preclude future
Cointelpro-type activities and it is possible it will recommend
eriminal or civil prosecutions. As was done with the Petersen
Committee report, the subjective characterization of an action as
falling within one of several arbitrarily described categories is not
only a matter of individual interpretation, but raises questions which
cannot be objectively answered. Whether or not these actions are
truly thought to. be prosecutable offenses, the innuendo arising from
their characterization is in itself damaging.

ACTION:

None. For information.

Re: Senstudy 75

Senator Mondale, explained at the outset that
the purpose of the Session was for Bureau representatives
to furnish information which would assist the SSC in
drafting legislation outlining Bureau responsibilities in
the domestic intelligence area. He requested that Bureau
representatives highlight operations in this field and
support, by specific examples, why the Bureau believes
there is a continuing need for | this type _investigation,

Between the approximate hours 10:00 a.m. to
12:00 noon, Bureau representatives offered statements
nd answered questions concerning the following topics:
suggested legislation based on both the "Stone" language
md the proposed Attorney General guidelines; definition
of Governmental interests as basis for ''Domestic
Intelligence Investigations;"' extent of terrorist activity
(both foreign and domestic oriented) in this country;
value of intelligence-type investigations in deterring

terrorist activity; and assessment, of potential for

terrorist activity during the forthcoming year.

At approximately 12:00 noon, Senators Mondale
and Morgan departed because of other commitments, Before
departing, Senator Mondale stated he believed the Session
to be helpful but noted the discussion-had not included
intelligence investigations of so-called subversive
domestic organizations and individuals who do not appear
to posé an immediate threat to this country's internal
security, Senator Mondale proposed, and it was agreed,
that discussion in this~aréa would Gontimue with Staff’
Members dufing the Week of 2/9-13/76 and conclude with

Re: Senstudy 75

Upon Senator Mondale's departure, SSC Chief
Counsel Frederick A. 0. Schwartz, Jr., acted as chairman.
Mr. Shackelford read into the record a statement concerning
the need for continued Bureau investigations of domestic
organizations and individuals calling for illegal
overthrow of the Government even though the threat is
not imminent, Following numerous questions and answers
in this area, the Session was adjourned at 1:00 p.m.,
with no date set for further discussion,

OBSERVATIONS :

While present, Senator Mondale from his comments
appeared to acknowledge that in any proposed le; islation

some verbiage would ha have to bewine Iudec allo ng_for

seemed most concerted, however, and expressed cognizance,

recognized the need for intelligence-type investigations
but only when violence was present, He further declared
that, in investigations of organizations calling for
violence, such investigations should be limited only to

that segment of the organization which actually participated
in or advocated violence. Senator Morgan was critical of
Bureau investigations of of the Kian and_¢ in C COINTELPRO,

with the possible exception of Wes Mark Citenstein, it

would appear these individuals are unalterably opposed.
to legislation authorizing Bureau investigations_in_the

In brief, the statement by Senator Church reviews

majority and minority counséls of the Senate Select Committee
(SSC) before the full Committee on 11/18/75. No new so-called
abuses were identified by Senator Church..and_the speech was
merely a rehash of those activities conducted by, the intel-

as abuses. Specifically, the Church statement makes reference

Re: Senstudy 75
62-116395

MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR:

Senator Ghurch's allegations concerning the FBI's
investigation of Martin Luther King, Jr., are replete with
inaccuracies, untruths, half-truths, exaggerations, distortions
and opinions masquerading .as facts, The Senator's allegations
illustrate his disregard for facts as duly sworn_to and
documented (the testimony of Mr, Adams on 11/19/75) preferring
instead to persist in certain fixations and preconceptions of
the SSG Staff. The entire King matter is currently under
intensive Departmental review which includes Departmental
access to’ all FBI files.

INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE:

This refers to the fact that in 1969, the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) established a special staff used to gather
intelligence on dissident groups. The legitimacy of this
procedure is something for the IRS to answer.

OPERATION CHAOS:

Senator Church criticizes the special operation group
formed in CIA to explore possible ties between hostile foreign
nations and domestic dissent within the U. S. CIA's defense
to this operation has been the fact that they were doing this in
response to direct instructions from the President.

ILLEGAL MAIL OPENING PROGRAMS:

Much has appeared in the press regarding the sp-called
illegal mail opening programs conducted by both CIA and FBI.
This is currently the subject of a very intensive investigation
by the Department of Justice and both the FBI and CIA are i
cooperating with Departmental attorneys in an effort to determine
whether there is any criminal culpability on the part of FBI
and CIA employees.

“A year ago the Select Committee on Intélligence began its

investigation of the American intelligence service. Since then,
the road we have traveled has been long and hard. But now the

end of the journey is near. Soon the Committee will present: its

final recommendations.
We have sat neither as judges nor jurors in this inquiry.

It has not been our function to act as a Grand Jury. Our purpose,
rather, has been to obtain information to aid the legislative
process. In particular, we have sought the knowledge and under-
standing, based on a close review of intelligence activities over
the past three decades, which could help us develop sound legis-
lative remedies to reform the intelligence agencies and prevent

| _ abuses of power in the future.

| The criminal investigation and prosecution of officials

within the intelligence service who may have violated the law
is not the task cast this, or any other, Congressional committee.
Yet all Members of Congress, and the citizens ‘they represent,
‘should be concerned that justice takes its proper and impartial
+ course in this matter. : :

carried out five counterintel ligence- programs, or -"COINTEIPROs ,""
against a variety of organizations involved iif peaceful protest.
Among these organizations were the Southern Christian Leadership

S, and various antiwar grcups.

Conference, most black student gro

Loe 11 E jail

NW 65360 Docld:32989578 Page 57



The PBI program against the.New Left was the most wide~ ent
sweeping of all. Its targets included underground newspapers,
students protesting various university policies, the antiwar
Inter-University Committee for Lebate on Foreign Policy, and
several colleges and universities.

The FBI tactics included the use of anonymous letters and
telephone calls designed to disrupt families, friendships.
careers, and organizations; the use of agents provocateurs to
sow dissension and fragment groups; the dissemination of fake
information about individuals to employers, credit bureaus, and
ereditors; the instigation of tax investigations against certain
citizens for harassment purposes, alone; the investigation of the
private life of group leaders for whispering to the press; and an
almost endless list of equally deplorable assaults on First
Amendment rights. :

From 1962 until his death, Dr. Martin luther King was the
target of a vicious campaign by the FBI to discredit him as the
most prominent black activist in America. The full array of the
Bureau's sophisticated devices of technical surveillance was
turned against Dr. King. He was illegally bugged, tapped, and
followed. Information on nis private life was-then delivered by
agents of the FBI to clergymen, Members of Congress, the White
House, United States Ambassadors, ‘newsmen, the National Science
Foundation, and the British Government, anong others. Agents
were sent to colleges to persuade them not to grant Dr. King’
honorary degrees. : :

"anf aration obtained from microphone coverage of Dr. King
was hand-carried to prominent clergymen throughout the country.
As one’ agent recalls:

CHoover} sent me...cto talk to an Episcopalian Eee
Bishop. He instructed me to tell this Episco~ _
palian Bishop, who had been speaking for King
++sall sorts of details. It was not a pleasant
assignment. But it was an order, an instruction,
and I did go.....(The Bishop] led me to believe
that we could have done a much more honorable

: thing if we had stayed iri Washington and not

zi carried that tale out there, and I'm inclined
. to think that he was right.



Thirty-four days before Dr. King was to fly to Norway to

7 receive the highest honor an American can earn, the Nobel Prize

for Peace, the Federal Bureau of Investigation even sent him #a °
message urging him to take his own life. The unsigned note iread:

King, there is only one thing left for you

to do. You know what it is. You have just

34 days in which to do it. (This exact number
has been selected for a specific reason.) It
has definite practical significance. You are
done. There is but one way out for you.

The FBI has engaged in a host of other questionable actiy-

ities, including the colzection of irtelligence on critics and

political opponents of incumbent Presidents. a
In 1963,.the Internal Revenue Service established 2 Special

Service Staff (S88). For the next five years the 88 Staff was

used by the IRS and, indirectly, the FBI to gather intelligence

on dissident groups. Its 11,456 files included dossiers on anti-~

war leaders, black political leaders, writers, labor organizers,

tax reform groups, ci’

rights groups, women's liberation groups,,
clergymen, and many more.

In 1967, a Special Operations Group was formed in the Central
Intelligence Agency. Its purpose was to explore possible ties
between hostile foreign nations and domestic dissent within the
United States. The project received the codéname "Operation CHAOS."
over a six-year period, CHAOS accumulated more than 13,000 files,
including 7,200 on American citizens. Through this program the
CIA became a storehouse for the stockpiling of large quantities
of data on citizens of this country. :

From 1940 to 1973, various illegal mail-opening programs

were conducted intermittently by the CIA and the FBI. The CIA

program ran ~- off and on -- from 1952 to 1973, and involved the
opening of mail to and from American citizens. This mail was
intercepted in five major cities within the United States, with
the larges operation taking place jn’New York City. In that

metropolis alone, 9,000 letters were opened’ and read by CIA agents

NW 65360 Docid:32989578 Page 59


“the FBI,

in the @ year of ‘the program. Among cneQpiviauars and

organizations whose maii was examined were’ Arthur Burns, Mrs.

Martin Luther King, dr.’ 2ichard Nixon,, Senators Humphrey and
Kennedy, the Ford Foundation, Harvard University, and the
Rockefeller Foundation

The FBI mail-opening program ran from 1940 to 1966, with
Federal agents in seven American cities reading and photograph-~
ing letters written by citizens of the United States. The FBI
also cooperated with the CIA mail program in New York City, re~
ceiving copies of more than $0,000 intercepted letters from the
Agency between 1958 and 1973. Military intelligence units
shared the CIA take, too.

In the Summer of 1970, the so-Galled Huston Plan was drafted
for amd approved by the President. Based on a sweeping review of

intelligence collection methods prepared by officials of the CIA,

tional Security Agency (NSA), the Defense Intelli-

suparate military service units, the

ics cf illegal proposals. The Plan,

vai, invested the intelligence agencies

with Presidenti.) aithevity te monitor the international comauni-

eations of U.S. izens; intensify the electronic surveillance

of domestic dissidcnts; read the mail of American citizens; break
into the homes of comestic dissenters; and increase the coverage

of college student

Althoug

cinded five days after its initial
approval, several of the programs continued -- just as ‘they had
gone on before the Presidential annointment. They had a life of
their own, apart from higher authority.‘ The CIA mail progran

is but one example. :

fmong the »vogrdms appreved by the President in the Huston

Plan was a ™ maintained on American citizens by the

National Snicd sages carried over international

communicat ies hich were to, from, op about individuals



NW 65360 Docld:32989578 Page 61 _

whose names appeared on the watch list were automatically sorted
out and monitored by NSA computers. The messages were also dis-
“seminated to the CIA, the FBI, and the Secret Service. 1}
‘the 1960's and early 1970's, over 16,000 American names:,were

placed on the NSA watch list. e

Moreover, since 1945, three international telegraph comp-
anies provided the United States Government with copies, of
telegrams sent abroad by American citizens. This program was
turned over to the National Security Agency, when that agency
was established in 1952 and it became known as “Operatio.
SHAMROCK." American names on the NSA watch list served as :
computer indexes or signals for the private companies to sort.”
from their large volume of messages those which were of interest
to the government. These messages were then circulated to the
Bureau and the CIA. :

This is, by no meane, a comprehensive list of unlawful
conduct by the intelligence agencies. The possibility of perjury
by intelligence officers before the Congress is not the least of
several questions which have yet to be resolved by a thorough
investigation of the evidence. This is’ an issue of utmost im-

portance, since the Congress cannot hope to arrive at useful

remedial legislation on the intelligence service -- or any other

public policy concern -- if it is not told the truth.
* The issue, then, is not whether laws have been violated,
but rather when and how justice will be served. The "when" ought
to be as soon as possible; the "how" is a more tangled problem.
An argument can be made in favor of allowing the usual
processes and institutions to take their course. The Justice
_ Department has begun to conduct criminal investigations of several
cases uncovered-by the Rockefeller Commissio. and the committees
of Congress. ‘t can be argued that these investigations should

not be interrupted since they have already begun.



Certainly, the present Attorney General is a man of
integrity. He has voiced his concern several times over re-

garding the abuses which have come to Light through the inve

tigations of the past year. He has been helpful to the Select’
Committee by providing documents and other information. Ttnave
full confidence in his good intentions and his respect for the
law.

Nonetheless, the Attorney General faces an unfortunate

dilemma, Since the Federal Bureau of Investigation is a sub- -

division of the Justice Department, it lies within the adminis-
trative responsibility of the Attorney General. He is thus
Bee ina Position of investigating the very house over which
he must preside.

It is not only the actuality of impartiality which is at

stake. The appearance of impartiality is just as important.

The American Bar Association Standards for Cr.

that a prosecuting officer should have no conflict of interest
or the appearance of a conflict of interest. As Chesterfield
Smith, past president of the ABA, has noted, "Under the Standards,
it would be improper for an investigation. . .of the Executive
Branch of the Federal Government to be conducted by a prosecutor
subject to the direction and control of the President."

The fact that the "PBL isa part of the Justice Department
is not the only troubling aspect of this situation -- though it
‘is serious enough since, over the years, senior-FBI officials
and Justice personnel have had close contact .in their daily work
and have shared knowledge of the dubious, activities brought to
Light by the Select Committee inquiry. The Justice Department
and the CIA have also had a unique relationship.’ A secret agree-
ment between the tuo was in efféct for twenty ‘years which exempted
the Agency from the usual requirements of reporting to Justice

any violations of the law among CIA personnel.

=6-

NW 65360 Docld:32989578 Page 62

inal Justice provide


NW 65360 Docld:32989578 Page 63

Moreover, it is the Justice Department which is supposed
to represent intelligence officials who may be sued for civil

damages as a consequence of the disclosures brought about by.

Congressional investigations. How can the Justice Department

investigate and prosecute these officials, on the one hand,!and
defend their interests in civil suits on the’other? It just will
not work. :

It is obvious that the public is deeply troubled by the
findings of the investigations into the intelligence service. |
In a recent Harris Survey, 80 percent of those interviewed “agreed
"it was wrong for the FBI to send a note to Martin Luther King ©
suggesting that he commit suicide. " 74 Percent agreed “it was
wrong for the CIA to work out a deal with Mafia characters to
try to assassinate Castro." And 61 percent agreed "it was a
violation of basic rights for the CIA and FBI to conduct spying
on prominent Americans here at home." :

The government must move decisively. To avoid charges of
a whitewash, it is in the best interests’of the Justice Depart-
ment to disqualify itself in this case.

What is vital now is to guarantee a full, thorough and
independent investigation. A special prosecutor should be en-
listed for this purpose, and given sufficient authority to fully
perform the task. :

last year, the American Bar Association Committee to Study
Federal Law Enforcement Agencies addressed itself in a prelimi-
nary report to the question of a special prosecutor. The
Committee rejected the’ establishment of a permanent special
prosecutor, but noted that "the public must be assured that crimes

committed in high places will be investigated and prosecuted

3 cs * , :
fearlessly and h integrity." To this end, ‘the ABA Comnittee

properly concluded:

“Te



NW 65360 Docld:32989578 Page 64
Fa ct inins

There may be exceptional circumstances
requiring a special. prosecutor from out-
side the Department of Justice who is
not dependent on the Attorney General

or the President for future promotion

or other preferment. The primary obli-
gation to appoint such an attorney should
reside in the Attorney General.

The relationship between the Justice Department and the
intelligence service unquestionably presents us with an excep-
tional circumstance. ;

The person chosen to perform the task of special prosecutor
must Possess the same impartiality and strength of resolution
which Leon Jaworski demonstrated during his appearance before a
committee of Congress in 1973. The following exchange occurred

that year in hearings before the Senate Committee on the
Judiciary: 7
Senator Tunney. So-as I understand your
statement today, you feel that if there
evidence of criminal activity which is
indictable, that you would be prepared to
move ahead with an investigation and in-
dictments despite the fact that the defen~
dants involved might be prepared to claim
that national securizvy requived them to
do what they did?

Mr. Jaworski. That is right, sir. And

they would have the burden of sustaining

that position. I would not assume the

burden. I would contest it.
The special prosecutor, mcreover, should be imbued with the same,
faith in the law that possessed John Adams, who knew that the
law “without any regard to persons, commands that which is good
and punishes evil in all, whether cich or poor, high or low --
‘tis deaf, inexorable, inflexible." :

The basic machinery of a special prosecutor's office is

already in place as a legacy of the Watergate affair. It should.
not be too difficult to modify this machinery in the appropriate

manner to carry out the investigation of unlawfulness in the

intelligence agencies.

i

oo. ©.
It may be argued that we should concentrate on the reform
of the intelligence agencies for the future, not on the punish-
ment of individuals for misdeeds of the past. This is a be-
guiling argument. But the truth is that we can ill-afford to
overlook the lawlessness of the past if we wish to avoid a
repetition in the future. As two scholars from the Center for
National Security Studies, Jerry J. Berman and Morton H. Halperin,
noted in a recent New York Times article:
One key element in bringing the intelligence
agencies under democratic control is to insure
: that officials of intelligence agencies are
prosecuted when they violate the law. Unless
there is a thorough investigation by an impar-
-tial prosecutor followed by indictments and a
report, the threat of criminal penalties will
not deter future abuses.
I find it utterly deplorable that the President in his
State of the Union message failed completely to say even a word
about the need to make our intelligence agencies obey the law.
As the journalist Anthony Lewis has commented, "It is easy to
denounce private crime, as ip. Ford did. But it is more important,
now, for Government to commit itself to law."
7 And so I must conclude that, in the present situation,
resort to a temporary speciai prosecutor is both proper and
necessary. Leon Jaworski, a former Special Prosecutor himself,

and others in the legal community agree with this conclusion.

On 2/10/76, Supervisor Jack Hagerty, Tampa
Division, telephonically advised Senstudy Project that
one Jack Bauman, 600 Lake Martha Drive, N. E., Winter Haven
Florida, had received a subpoena to appear before the
Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSC) on 2/19/76.

For background information, Bauman, an ex-CIA
employee, was a witness for the Government during the
Watergate investigation and was interviewed extensively
by the Bureau during same, Due to a serious heart conditi
he did not travel to Washington to testify in 1973, but
then AUSA Earl Silbert, Washington, D. C., flew to Florida
for Bauman's deposition,

Pen]

Prior to Bauman's scheduled appearance: before
the SSC, Michael Madigan, an SSC Staff Member, and
Jack Dempsey of CIA's Review Staff (CIA's Senstudy Project
counterpart) are to interview Bauman at his residence in
Florida in the presence of his attorney, Wallace L, Storey,
In this regard, Bauman has requested SA Brooke D, Roberts
of Lakeland, Florida, RA (who interviewed Bauman during
Watergate) presence during this interview, along with
any documents which may refresh his (Bauman's) recollection

of prior statements as his memory weg. Wb Po os )372

Hagerty desired to know whether ‘or not fier
should sit in on upcoming interview and have FD;30? of. memus:
his prior interview of Bauman available.

Memorandum to Mr, W. R. Wannall
Re: Senstudy 75
62-116395

SA Andrew J, Duffin, through Mr. Walter Elder,
CIA Review Staff, on 2/10/76, determined that CIA was
in fact to participate in an interview of Bauman with
an SSC Staff Member in the near future. He is to be
interviewed regarding his prior contact with E. Howard
Hunt and Project Merry Mack, acronym for CIA's efforts
to prevent any electronic penetration of their building
during its construction, CIA hopes that interview will
negate the necessity of Bauman having to answer SSC
subpoena, as they feel it will show he will not ‘be: the
"hot" witness that SSC anticipates.

Subsequently, Hagerty was advised of above and
that Roberts should not participate in interview, as it
was an SSC interview and only concerned them and CIA,

None. For information.

Re: Senstudy 75
62-116395

(1) The type of material upon which FBI
bases its assessment of potential for terrorist violence.

(2) Investigative techniques and intelligence
gathering activities utilized by the Bureau to collect
material upon which above assessments are based.

(3) Examples whereby Bureau intelligence
investigations in the past have been responsible for
uncovering information subsequently used by this Bureau
to prevent violence,

(4) Ultimate threat, as compared to the
immediate threat, which basic revolutionary organizations
pose to the security of this country.*

E11Lif£ offered that none of the above areas
have been prejudged by SSC Members and stated that
substantial differences exist in these areas among
Senators composing the SSC,

Mark Gitenstein then noted that this Bureau
has furnished the SSC with documents pertaining to a 7
number of examples where information, developed as a ited .
result of intelligence investigations, was responsible
for initiating preventive-type action. He requested,
if possible, additional examples of a substantive nature fe etl
which would help establish the necessity for intelligence:
investigations. Additionally, he requested futthéer:delivery of ¥
documents helping to clarify Bureau actions in four of
the previously furnished preventive-type actions referred
to above,

Re: Senstudy 75

Elliff also requested that, in preparation
of the forthcoming Executive Session, the SSC be furnished
with statistics covering the number of bombings which
occurred in this country for as far back as 10 years,
if such information is available.

E11iff concluded by saying that he intends
to present, on 1/29/76, to SSC Members a typed agenda
for the scheduled Executive Session and, when approved,
he will furnish the Bureau a copy of same on 1/30/76.

OBSERVATIONS :

A large segment of the above briefing was
consumed by Elliff expounding on his personal views
(and Bureau rebuttal thereto, where applicable) concerning
domestic intelligence investigations, EL1iff stated
that such investigations should only be conducted when
a criminal violation or a distinct potential for same
vis present, For this reason he believes that informants
should not be targeted against domestic organizations
or individuals unless the potential for criminal
violence is present, and that investigations of domestic
organizations and individuals should be removed from
the Bureau's Intelligence Division and transferred to
the Bureau's General Investigative Division, The
Intelligence Division would then become the Counterintelligence
Division and would handle only intelligence investigations
having foreign ramifications which he said would include
the Communist Party but not organizations such as the
Socialist Worker's Party. Continuing, he stated his
belief that valuable intelligence-type information
concerning domestic organizations and individuals would

naturally flow from our criminal investigations in
these areas, With regard to determining the potential
for civil unrest, E11Liff postured that accurate infor-
Imation in this field could be obtained through overt
contact with civic leaders and not through covert use
of informants. To support the latter position, EL1iff
quoted unnamed former officials of the now defunct
Interdepartment Information Unit (IDIU) who readily
stated the majority of the Bureau information furnished
that Unit emanated from public sources, In essence,
ELLiff made the observation that he was opposed to
domestic intelligence-type investigations as currently
conducted by this Bureau and he advocated that any
investigation of a domestic organization or individual
be based upon criminal statute, It was noted that
ELLiff, though not equating "potential" with probable
cause, had difficulty specifically defining "potential"
in the above context,

RE: Criticisms-of-FBI-By U.S. Senator,
Robert B Morgan of North Carolina

Reference my letter of January 23,1976 addressed to you and
enclosing data concerningpublicly uttered adverse remarks about
the FBI made by U.S. Senator Robert B.Morgan(D) »N-C., on
January 15,1976 before the Asheville,N.C.Chamber of Commerse,
and my letter of rebuttal to Senator Morgan dated January 24.

Since then the "Asheville Citizen" Asheville N.C. printed
@ portion of my rebuttal in its January 30,k976 issue, in an
articke titled:"Retired Agent Questions Morgan's. FBI position”
A copy of this news item is enclosed.

Also I've received replies from U.S. Senator Jesse Helms,
(R),N.C. and from U.S.Representative, Roy A.Taylor, (D),N.C.
who represents the Eleventh Congressional District and which .
ineludes the Ashevill and Spruce Pine areas. I'm enclosing
copies of their replies which you will find are s&pportive
and encouraging. In fact, Mr. Taylor went out of his way to
support the FBI in his remarks of January 22,1976 in the
Congressional Record. Acopy of his remarks is also enclosed.

Finally, on February 5, 1976 I received a réply from
Senator Morgan,dated February 3,976 which was less than
favorable. A copy of his letter is enclosed. Today I
am replying to Mr. Morgan in the form of a letter to him
dated February 7, a copy of which I'm enclosing for you.

These efforts may prove to have been in vain- but if

Dear Senator Morgan: DATE b

Reference my letter to you dated January 24, 1976 and your
thoughtful a,d sincere reply dated February 3, 1976.

I can apprediate your due concern with what you sincerely
believe to be past abuses and errors of the FBI. I'm sure you
have heard some sordid testimony, and I'll be the first to. agree
that the FBI has had its faults when compared with some theoretical
perfedtion.. .

I submit however, that you heard only the worst, the most
glaring snd most shocking incidents which can only represent the
most infinitesemal number of cases, taken from hundreds of uhous-
ends of investigations. Much of the testimony heard by you em=
anated from disgruntled, sometimes disillusioned and less than
candid individuals, many of whose sense of values and objectivity
has changed, fir various reasons, with the passing of tine.

What you didn't hear was the testimony of thousands of
selfless citizens, many of whom risked their lives and personal
Safety to work undercover or semi-covertly in a sincere effort
to assist the FBI in protecting this country, it citizens and-
their civil liberties, ‘

You didn't hear of the interminable and consistent FBI 7
investigations: which scrupulously went the extra steps to protect.
the legal rights of individuals under investigation. Nor did you -.
hear the testimony of thousa,ds of fearful and concerned citizens,
parents and cther close relatives of persons whose warped minds:
and actions were aimed at destroying our government and thereby
the civil liberties of thiir victims, both black and white.

From a philosophical as well as a prag matic standpoint perhaps
we can agzee that the potential harm to privacy must be weighed
against the necessity for law enforcement action in relation to
social and security needs at any given time,

If only one or the other of these interests is to be consid
ered to the exelusion of the others irrationality results--and,
should this irrationality persist protractedly, in either direct-
ion, our nation would tend to tyranny, namely, that of anarchy on
the one side or tyranny of police agencies on the other.

Phas might be termed a balancing approach, an approach @hich

2 2
“has, ‘Bees,unnasognized by many of the FBI's Critics.

Moreover, in an effort to balance the right of. protection -
from violations of privamy ageinst other rights don't we have to

_Gecide, among other things, how much law enforcement agencies should

be allawed-to- infringe on the privacy of suspects in order to protec
the privacy--and all the vrights—- of other citizens--above ail the
rights of those latter citizens not to be victimiazed by law breakers
and/or politically or revolutionary motivated suspects? This is a
major dilemma.

I'm not opposed to Congessional guidelines or oversight S2-- -

the intelligence-agencies. But oversight and guidelines are

fraught with problems, For example,.is it possible for. our.current..
or future Congessmen to clearly and decisively predict conditions
which may confront the FBI and GIA years or even months from now?
For this reason.alone some flexibility is paramount. 7

Another perplexing issue comes to mind. Will Congress be
accountable if it is the ultimate judge or decision maker for our
intelligence and counter-intelligence operations?

In raising these questions I'm confident thas Congress will
ulimately pass some guideline legislation for our intelligence -
agenciesand will include therein a certain amount of oversight
provisions. stipulating some sort of prior restraint on propesed
tactics ox intelligence strategies.

With this in mind we have to recognize that internabibnally
there has always been a need for this country to learn things. that
people would not ordinarkly tell a foreigner—or that domestically,
there are things that a criminal or revolutionary would not. ordin~
arily tell a public official; nor would this type person lay his or
her activities bare to public scrutiny. It follows thatthese natural
manifestations of reluctance apd secrecy has always implied the use
of extraordinary, ofter covert investigative meams, Therefore, can
we have that desirable degree of and quantity of oversight without

Gan certain necessary operations be taken if public officials,
espe@ialiy elected officials, must stand up and take responsibility
for them--or for the failure to take them?

in reality anyone who knows about an intelligence operation
in advance will have, in effect, a Veto over it. For the simple
decision taken by oneself that "for the country's good” a plan
must be made public, will automabica,ly scuttle it. :

Moreover, there will be situations when a group of elested
officials will be charged Swith deciding, often after only short
emergency briefings, squeezed in between other important and
distracting public business, wheter to approve or disapprove some
audacious emergency covert operation. And, will they Gant to publicly

“aecept responsibility af their decision proves to be wrong?
Bhis is a sincere and searching question.

isn't our main paradox perhaps that of the imperfection of.
human beings—- and, therefore, human instituions which means that
we never get the choice between pure virtue and pure vice?

This is. particularly true in the intelligence Zield. The
system must be realistically viewed as a proximate solution to
an insoluble problem. :

There has always: been and there always will be some sin,
some wrongdoing and some errors; of judgement in high places,
including intelligence agencies. But it follows that the same

_dmperfections exist and will continue to exist in the remainder
of society. It is illusory to wait for a pexfect solution. There
is none. Reseeae_ceebeeunent

Once wa can agree on this, those of us of goodwill and
perseverence can fight for the better cause lest it lose out to
theworse., Once weaccept this understanding perhaps some of our
imperfections will not occasion the cynicism and self flagellation
of our society that exists today.

With this in mind let us assume that the PBI and CIA dia,

-0R Occasion exceed their authority. Let us not in our efforts

to correct the problem think that we can, by a strcke of legislation
eliminate any need for covert intelligence operations. For we

can rest assured that neither the Russians nor the Chinese will
join us in this quest for a Utopian and nobler less secretive
international om domestic community. Any hasty, unilateral acts.

of so-called purification on our part will not insure freedom in
the U.S. or stability abroad. : ; :

EAT E TT E EO SEAT E

In closing, while you and I do not currently see eye to eye
on this issue, wa can, by confining our thoughts and statements
to the basic issues, as contrasted to denouncing personalities,
have a better chance of securing an ultimate meeting of the minds
an an effort to solve this complex and oftewl seeming insurmount=
able enigma.

Dear Mr. Lawrence =

Thank you for taking time to write me and for your
expression of your feelings about the Federal Bureau of
Investigation. I admire your loyalty to the organization
you served. i

We have finished many long hours of hearing test-
imony regarding the activities of the FBI. Let me say
that as a citizen and as. Attorney General of North
Carolina, I always. supported the FBI and defended it when
I hear@ it criticized. :

It gives me no pleasure now to hold it in less high
esteem than I did before, but after hearing testimony
about its activities, especially under Mr. Hoover, I
could reach no other conclusian but that the due process
clause and the civil liberties of individuals were violated
time after time. What may be worse, I got the feeling
from the testimony of present FBI officials that they
didn't plan to change things much, if at all.

7 I know that many fine people such as you served the
Bureau and thir country well, but I cannot disregard
the unchallenged testimony I heard during the past
several months. :
Thank you again for writing and with best wishes.

Sincerely yours,

Robert Morgan

EXTENSION OF REMARKS OF CCNGESSMAN ROY. A. TAYLOR’
JANUARY 22,1976

Mr.Speaker, I would like to call my colleagues! attention to
the editorial appearing in the U.S. News &World Report of January
26,1976, titled "Is America Going Mad?", In line with the editorial
are not segments of the press, television commentators, and many
spokesmen of the Congress going too far in emphasizing the negativ
and ignoring the positiveO-in dwelling on the mistakes of the past
avather than the problems of the present and the hopes of the futur
Are they not going too far in destroying the confidence of the
American people and of people abread in our American institutionsa-
the FBI, the CIA, the Defense Department, the Conggess~-~.and in.
destroying the confidence in public officials both those serving
today and many whose honorable servise has ended with death-~——
J.Edgar Hoover, John F.Kennedy, Frenklin Roosevelt.

Are they not tearing our nation ‘to pieces in the eyes of the
world and weakining fundamental institutions Phose effective
services are needed today and will be needed tomorrow, Why deelI
so long on the negative a,d lose sight of the positive accomplish
ments, thereby giving people a defeatist attitude and placing aount
and mistrust between the people apd their government.

This is serious because without public confidence our Democracy
cannot operate and it cannot win and maintain respect abroad.
I,too, want to know the truth a,d ig help right the wrongs
established, but once the truth” has been reveajed I am content
to let theffacts take their place in history and agree with the
editorial that no useful purpose is served by constantly repeating
the mistakes of the past.

The future belongs to the peofle,communities and nations who
ha.e faith in themselves and in what they stand for and in what
they are doing, My choice of a motto for the Bicentennial E
year is "Take pride in America's past and take part in its

‘uture.

The editorial follows:

Dear Mr. Lawrence:

Thank you for your recent letter, the copy of your
letter to Senator Morgan and the newspaper clippings. -.

I am not among those Members of Congress who have |
been criticizing the FBI and CIA. In my judgement
both agencies are vitally essential. T is coin-
cidental that you included the editorial,"Is
America Gbing Mad" from U.S. News and World Re~
port. This editorial made such sense to me that
iast week I placed a copy of it inthe Congrssional
Record along with my own comments of agreement.
Enclosed is a copy of my remarks for the Record
along with a copy of a news release which I mailed
to all news media in the Eleventh Congressional
District.

I know that Senator Morgan will read your letter

very carefully and will welcome the opportunity

it affords him to respond to you directly.
Sincerely

Mr. William H. Lawrence
314 Swiss Pine Lake Drive
Swrice Pine, North Carolina 28777

Dear Mr. Lawrence:

Thank you for your letter of January 26 regard—
ing the unfair treatment being received by the F.B.I..
Rest assured, this is one Senator who has not been
fooled by all this nonsense. We have had experience
enough with so-called ad hoc committees which tend
toward sensationalizing of their subject matter, and
cater to a press hungry for leaks of sensitive inform—
ation. I

Of course, I'm sure the F,B,I, has made
mista,es—-who hasn't? What is important is that
these mistakes have been few and far between, and the
F.B.I. was and is the most honest and efficient law
enforcement agency in the world.

When the country is faced with c#itical problems
of inflation, people out of work, and the price of energy
going out. of sight, Congress dows not need to be a&dis—
tracted from these important problems by a sideshow
run by left-wing columnists and commentators...

Thanks again for writing. Please continues to
share your thoughts with me.

Sincerely

Jesse Helms

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
RE: SENSTUDY '75

Maley stated the article goes into some length that
Michael Madigan and Lester Seidel, both members of the
investigating staff of the SSC, were in San Diego conducting
investigation relative to the FBI and SAO in the past. The
article further states that another investigator from the SSC,
mamed Arthur Jefferson, is scheduled to arrive in San Diego
today (1/27/76) to begin a probe of FBI attempts to encourage
warfare in 1969 between rival black nationalist factions in
San Diego and Los Angeles. The article continues that the FBI
already has turned over to the Senate panel a "1200-page
document confirming that the FBI attempted to foster strife among
blacks throughout the nation." An afternoon meeting was
scheduled 1/27/76 between Arthur Jefferson and Leon Williams,
San Diego's first black City Councilman.

Maley stated the article in the "Union" newspaper did
not indicate he, Maley, was to be interviewed. He did locate
the Monday night article in the San Diego “Evening Tribune"
which indicated that Maley would be interviewed.

Maley stated that under no circumstances would he
submit to interview by SSC investigators without first
contacting Office of Legal Counsel and securing a waiver of
his confidentiality agreement. Maley further stated he had
earlier in the day forwarded a clipping to Inspector-Deputy
Assistant Director Homer A. Boynton, Jr., External Affairs
Division, concerning a press release which had been made by
Madigan and Seidel when they were in the San Diego area.

Maley expressed considerable concern that the investigators

for the SSC seem to spend a great deal of their time making
press releases (mostly unfavorable to the FBI) and very little
of their time interviewing or investigating the facts. Maley
stated that two articles, in Monday night's paper and in
Tuesday's paper, were indicative of the type of press releases
being made. He stated nobody has contacted him about interviews
but he has read their intentions in the paper.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
RE: SENSTUDY '75

Maley was advised to submit pertinent information to
FBIHQ by teletype and he reiterated he would nottalk to any
investigators without first securing specific approval of
Office of Legal Counsel.

ACTION:

For information. Copy of the UPI dispatch 1/27/76
attached, When San Diego teletype is received, it will be
analyzed and any appropriate action taken.
