Executive Director

Assassination Records Review Board
600 E Street, N.W.

Washington, DC 20530

Dear Mr. Gunn:

(U) In response to your letter of November 28, 1997, we tasked
appropriate elements of the NSA Operations and the NSA Archives elements to
search for information responsive to your questions. In addition, a member of
my staff reviewed our United States Intelligence Board (USIB) and USIB SIGINT
Subcommittee record holdings. The following represents the composite
response of these elements.

-+FS-66@) Question #1: What were NSA targeting pricrities and.capabilities
against Cuba during the period 1963- 4964? Including :
records of the ommunications Intelligence (COMINT) Board, :

what records does NSA possess 9” tasking and results frond these
capabilities? _In particular, did NSA target communications between
Havana and IiDuring the meeting Messrs. Hatch dnd
Fogarty suggested that the Army Security Agency had a facilit :
in 1963 targeting although its .
‘operations did not meet with great success.) Mr. Hatch stated that
Mr. (Howard K.? Harold? Johnny?) Johnson, a former NSA employee,
might have more specific knowledge of such an operation and that you
could contact him.

4F3-GEO} ANSWER: A record of the SIGINT Subcommittee of the USIB
from August 1993 provides a recap of the USIB SIGINT Subcommittee’s Priority
National Intelligence Objectives. Included in this recap are objectives
[requirements] to obtain information on 1) Soviet and Cuban military
capabilities, 2). Soviet and Cuban capabilities, intentions, and efforts to initiate

(INSCOM) historian who has information regarding an Army Security Agency
(ASA) collection sitein[______|during the 1963-1964 timeframe. The
INSCOM historian is Jack Finnigan who can be reached on 703-706-2630.
Mr. Finnigan advised us of information contained in an ASA unit history report
that was written by J. Johnson. In addition, I understand that members of your
staff met in December 1997 with Mr. Frederick Berghoff, former Chairman of
the National SIGINT Committee (previously known as the USIB SIGINT
Subcommittee), who provided the ARRB staff with his recollections of NSA
activities regarding the Central and South American Regions in the early-1960s.

(U) Question #2. What, if any, additional NSA capabilities were added to target
communications sources within Cuba between November 1962 and the end of
1964? What information does NSA have on the targeting of communications
sources within Cuba by CIA? Was there any liaison between NSA and CIA on this
issue? NSA stated that it may have between six and twelve boxes of Cuba-
related material. Of what do these records consist? May the ARRB staff examine
these records?

@s-EeEe) ANSWER: The records of ihe usiB sIGt “Subcommittee for :
the period November, L962 through 1964 were recently reviewed. No SIGINT =?

for the 1962-1964 timeframe. The ‘August 1963SIGINT Subcommittee :

Janu: 1964 records indicate that requirements to target Soviet forces in Cuba:
and ee already receiving-priority-SIGINT coverage. :
The 2 December 1963 record appears to show a change; in priorities because it :
presents “pertinent examples of actions “underway of planned;..”: 1) increase in:
intercept and more timely consolidated reporting ah Cisban military problems, :
2) intercept and analysis of communications related t| lactivity...seeking !
information on Cuban[—___]in particular., 3) A méw attack on the problem’

of .

a :|4) Additional ship and airborne
intercept of Cuban communications is planned, and-5) Increased efforts to
develop information on the technical characteristicS-of the internal military and

paramilitary communications[>_________»__ countries.

(PS-EEO} NSA collectors, based on their personal recollections, were
alerted to put greater emphasis on SovietBlock and Cuban military targets to
look for signs of increased readiness in their forée posture. Analysts at NSA
were also looking for signs of ee ae to, and foreign intelligence
reporting on, the assassination. Any voice and cipher traffic was thoroughly
processed from the surrounding timeframe. Analysts on targets that were

[ [reviewed traffic patterns to
ensure that no deviations indicating unusual activity had been overlooked.

4S-CSO} A review of the United States Intelligence Board (USIB) records
held by NSA shows CIA and NSA top-level Agency cooperation/coordination on
intelligence targeting via the USIB. However, according to recollections of
individuals working at NSA in the mid 1960s, liaison between CIA and NSA for
the 1962-1964 timeframe was limited and no record of CIA/NSA cooperation/
coordination at the working levels of the agencies was located. We searched for
records of CIA targeting of Cuban communications, but no records were located.
However, the USIB records make repeated reference to Committee on Overhead
Reconnaissance (COMOR) Biweekly Report on High-Level Coverage of Cuba with
the caveat that the information was distributed through restricted channels.
Because we do not have copies of the COMOR reports, we are unable to
determine if the tasking of these missions was limited to PHOTINT, or if SIGINT
was also performed from the overhead vehicles. COMOR was the predecessor
of the SIGINT Overhead Reconnaissance Subcommittee (SORS). The SORS
committee is a subcommittee of the current U.S. SIGINT Committee. The
Chairman of the SORS is Mr. John Berwin (phone number: 202-496-9828).
