Mr. T. Jeremy Gunn

Executive Director

Assassination Records Review Board

600 E Street, N.W.

Washington, DC 20530

Dear Mr. Gunn:

(U) In response to your letter of November 28, 1997, we tasked

appropriate elements of the NSA Operations and the NSA Archives elements to

search for information responsive to your questions. In addition, a member of

my staff reviewed our United States Intelligence Board (USIB) and USIB SIGINT

Subcommittee record holdings. The following represents the composite

response of these elements.

44 USC 2107(5)(g)(2)(D)i)

(TS CCO) Question #1: What were NSA targeting priorities and capabilities

against Cuba

during the period 1963-1964? Including

records of the U.S. Communications Intelligence (COMINT) Board,

what records does NSA possess on tasking and results from these

capabilities? In particular, did NSA target communications between

Havana and

-ogarty suggested that the Army Security Agency nad a facility

I although its

operations did not meet with great success.) Mr. Hatch stated that

Mr. (Howard K.? Harold? Johnny?) Johnson, a former NSA employee,

might have more specific knowledge of such an operation and that you

could contact him.

(TS ECO) ANSWER: A record of the SIGINT Subcommittee of the USIB

from August 1993 provides a recap of the USIB SIGINT Subcommittee's Priority

National Intelligence Objectives. Included in this recap are objectives

[requirements] to obtain information on 1) Soviet and Cuban military

capabilities, 2) Soviet and Cuban capabilities, intentions, and efforts to initiate

44 USC 2107(5)(g)(2)(D)(i)

(Se) An NSA COMINT Technical Report (A5/A6• COMINT TECHNICAL

REPORT #1-66- A Survey of Soviet Communications in Cuba) regarding SIGINT

results of the targeting of Cuba was reviewed by Dr. Hall. This appears to be the

most comprehensive record of our capabilities against Cuba for the 1963-1964

timeframe. Numerous Cuban |

1960s, including some Cuban military *

NSA had an excellent capability

to meet the SIGINT challenges of the 1960's. We had field sites in position to

copy the signals of interest in Cuba, and those communication exchanges

(ISE) Product reports based on the targeting of

communications were reviewed by two members of my staff. Some of these

reports were the result of targeting of communications between Havana and

However, no records responsive.to the John F. Kennedy

Assassination Records Act of 1992 were located other than those already passed

to the ARRB. There were no reflections in any of these products of any activity

that might have been related to the assassination, only post-assassination

reflections of U.S. political and protocol dévelopmerts. NSA has approximately

12 shin boxes (4 linear feet] of

records.

(S) In early December 1997 the ARRB staff was provided with the name

and phone number of the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command

(INSCOM) historian who has information regarding an Army Security Agency

(ASA) collection site in

during the 1963-1964 timeframe. The

INSCOM historian is Jack Finnigan who can be reached on 703-706-2630.

Mr. Finnigan advised us of information contained in an ASA unit history report

that was written by J. Johnson. In addition, I understand that members of your

staff met in December 1997 with Mr. Frederick Berghoff, former Chairman of

the National SIGINT Committee (previously known as the USIB SIGINT

Subcommittee), who provided the ARRB staff with his recollections of NSA

activities regarding the Central and South American Regions in the early- 1960s.

()

Question #2. What, if any, additional NSA capabilities were added to target

communications sources within Cuba between November 1962 and the end of

1964? What information does NSA have on the targeting of communications

sources within Cuba by CIA? Was there any liaison between NSA and CIA on this

issue? NSA stated that it may have between six and tweive boxes of Cuba-

related material. Of what do these records consist? May the ARRB staff examine

these records?

(FS CEO) ANSWER: The records of the USIR SIGINT Subcommittee for

the period November. 1962 through 1964 were recently resewed. No SIGINT

Objectives. were' included in the SIGINT Subcommittee's objectives regarding

for the 1962-1964 timeframe. The August 1963 SIGINT Subcommittee

record recaps SIGINT Objectives and the 5 and, 18 November, 1963 and the 10

January 1964 records indicate that requirements to target Soviet forces in Cuba

and

]were already receiving priority-SIGINT coverage.

The 2 December 1963 record appears to show a change. in priorities because it

presents "pertinent examples of actions underway or planned;..": 1) increase in

intercept and more timely consolidated reporting an Ciban military problems,

2) intercept and analysis of communications related to activity...seeking:

information on Cuban

Of

: 4) Additional ship and airborne

intercept of Cuban communications is planned, and 5) Increased efforts to

countries.

(TS-CCO) NSA collectors, based on their personal recollections, were

alerted to put greater emphasis on Soviet, Block and Cuban military targets to

look for signs of increased readiness in their force posture. Analysts at NSA

were also looking for signs of |

reactions to, and foreign intelligence

reporting on, the assassination. Any voice and cipher traffic was thoroughly

processed from the surrounding timeframe. Analysts on targets that were

Treviewed traffic patterns to

ensure that no deviations indicating unusual activity had been overlooked.

(S CCO) A review of the United States Intelligence Board (USIB) records

held by NSA shows CIA and NSA top-level Agency cooperation/ coordination on

intelligence targeting via the USIB. However, according to recollections of

individuals working at NSA in the mid 1960s, liaison between CIA and NSA for

the 1962-1964 timeframe was limited and no record of CIA/NSA cooperation/

coordination at the working levels of the agencies was located. We searched for

records of CIA targeting of Cuban communications, but no records were located.

However, the USIB records make repeated reference to Committee on Overhead

Reconnaissance (COMOR) Biweekly Report on High-Level Coverage of Cuba with

the caveat that the information was distributed through restricted channels.

Because we do not have copies of the COMOR reports, we are unable to

determine if the tasking of these missions was limited to PHOTINT, or if SIGINT

was also performed from the overhead vehicles. COMOR was the predecessor

of the SIGINT Overhead Reconnaissance Subcommittee (SORS). The SORS

committee is a subcommittee of the current U.S. SIGINT Committee. The

Chairman of the SORS is Mr. John Berwin (phone number: 202-496-9828).

(TS CCO) Question #4. What policy recommendations from the time period 1960-64

might still exist which reflect NSA policy making or tasking on Cuban

diplomatic or military communications outside of Cuba?

records show the objectives (requirements for targeting) and are available for.

review by ARRB members or staffers.

(S CeO) Question #5. Are there any COMINT Board recommendations or tasking on

the targeting of

_communications during the period 1963-1964? Does

NSA have any other independent knowledge of these targets? :

{S CCO) ANSWER: No recommendation specific to was located,
