AMTURVY_ OPERATION

- 1. The AMTURVY Operation was designed for the
purpose of conducting sabotage operations against Cuba.

It consisted. of a net of 13 ANTURVY assets whose primary

function, apart from sabotage, was the preparation of

target studies and analysis of sabotage operations, The =
files contain only one reference to assassination, that

in 1963 and the continuation of the same plan through to

1965. Based on a review of the files, it is apparent

that the following assassination plan could have been known to
the Cubans, including the overall purpose of the AMDURVY

Operation.

2. ASSASSINATION.PLAN - AMTURVY-13.

AMTURVY-13 (Mario SALABARRIA) was closely r
acquainted with Fidel Castro as far back as 1947 and there is son
some indication that they both may have been involved in the
1947 plan to topple the Trujillo Government in the Dominican
Republic. However, in 1948, SALABARRIA was responsible for
the arrest of Fidel Castro, this due to the latters apitation
On behalf of one Entilio TRO. Salabarria was later sentenced
to 30 years in prison for having murdered TRO/. He remained .
in prison until 1961 when he appealed for parole to one
Lionel SOTO Prieto (201-955332). As Salabarria had once r
~-ovp-> saved Soto's life, the latter appealed the case to Raul
Castro, Salabarria was subsequently. released from prison
in’ Februgay, 1961, The terms of his release from jail
: are unknown.

3. By the summer of 1963 Salabarria was seeking
---. weapons and funds for a proposed. assassination attempt against

4, Salabarria
a

brother, AMCONCERT-1 for twenty years and assumed that ANTURVY-1
was in. touch with the AGENCY (how Ad assumed this is unknown).
At his first meeting with AMTURVY-1, in the summer of 1963,
Salabarria said he was a member. of a group plotting Castro's
death, and needed money and weapons in order to carry out

the plan (AMCROAK-i was also a member of this group). In

turn for this assistance, Salaharria offered t6é carry ovt

minor sabotage operations for AMTURVY-1's "American contacts"
(how he knew of these "contacts" is unknown, unless AMTHRYY-1
told him):

4, In October 1963; when the Agency was. satisfied
with Salabarria's bona fides "we" (the Agency ) managed to
get-a few pistols, revolvers, and sahotage materials into
Salabarria's hands, through AMTURVY-4. At this time AMTURVY-4

was receiving materials from the Agency through the pouch of

riers

the| Embassy in Havana. AMNTURVY-4 was being assisted

in this matter by Quawton= 51) Whether or not the materials
for Salabarrias assassination plan came through the
pouch is unknown.

of 28 December 1964, the debriefing of AMTURVY-1 who was

6. By early 1964, however, the Agency had become

dissatisfied with Salabarria and his proposed assassination
plan, and had notified the AMTURVY net (in particular
AMTURVY-1, AMTURVY-4, and AMCROAK-1) to cease working on
the assassination idea. Salabarria's later attempt to
asSass inate Fidel Castro was not approved by the Agency,
and ke was in fact informed of the Agency's opposition #£

to his plan.

7. COMMENTS
If as the file shows, the Agency approved
of Salabarria's plan to assassinate Fidel Castro and provided
Salabarria with the weapons (this in October of 1963), Castro
could have been awaré of the plan, eSpecially as Salabarria's
Gasé presents certain CI considerations. Salabarria had been
réléaséd-from jail following a personal apeal through Raul
Castro; and this when Fidel Gastro-was well aware of the
fact that Salabarria was responsible for the death of a
close friend, Emilio TRO; not to mention the fact that
Salabarria was responsible for Castro's arrest in 1948.
What deal, if any, was made with Salabarria in return for
his release from jail is unknown. Nonetheless, ax Fidel
Castro has a recorded history of not being one to forgive,
especially when he has been affected personally as was the

case with Mario Salabarria.
