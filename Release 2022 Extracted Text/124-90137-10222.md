NOTE: er. Rey is being brought to_U.S. unde. rrangements !
made b . Our files indicate Mr.[Kilpatrick}ehd Colonel H
Caldwell King of CIA are probably those who facilitated his c

visite In view of obvious purpose of trip, it is believed )
we should find out from CIA what is going onoSp There are

increasing indications of conferences with i ential Cuban oe
leaders who oppose Castro, particularly by State Department, ]

and since we are not being apprised of any U.S. moves to back
the Castro opposition, it is believed we should inquire
promptly where there are indications of official or semi-
official encouragement. Jt is not believed we should )
investigate Dr. Rey while he is here. Miami Office has been
in contact with Benitez and Faget, who are to be contacted by aire
Rey and who have professed to be cooperatives We are not. :
asking Miami to interview Benitez and Faget until after i
Dr. Rey's departure. This will afford some idea of whether .
they will come to us voluntarily and give us a straight story

on opposition plannings Thota received from Mexico is CIA

data f}uhich has been given to State and Bureau making no (38) u) y
further dissemination. Bureau data mentioned herein was d
â€˜furnished to State by letter 2/18/54. rperaetorfat)(le)

since it possibly concerns CIA covert operation IY
