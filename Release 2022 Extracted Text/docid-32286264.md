CG 92-349

In the early part of 1963, informant obtained

option for operation of a gambling casino at Normandy

Hotel, San Juan, Puerto Rico, where he and his brother have

other

business

interests.

Informant is anxious to obtain

financial backing on a partnership basis in this venture.

In July, 1963, he read an article in the magazine section

of a Miami, Florida newspaper indicating that SAM GIANCANA,

the well-known Chicago hoodlum, was seeking partnership

arrangements with American businessmen who could obtain

gambling concessions in the Caribbean area and South

America, which article indicated GIANCANA interested in

investment in such ventures. U

Subsequently, informant contacted an acquaintance,

DAVID SAX, of Chicago, owner or former owner of Saxony Hotel,

Miami, Florida, and now a banker in Chicago, formerly a

manufacturer of punch boards. He told him of the article

and asked how GIANCANA could be approached.

SAX told the

informant he knew one of GIANCANA'S close business associates

and could arrange a contact. u

Some time later, informant received telephone

call from one DAVE (last name unknown) and TEDDY (last

name unknown), who claimed to be GIANCANA's business

associates and desired a meeting

to discuss the matter.. U

Informant met DAVE and TEDDY in Miami, Florida,

and they seemed to know considerable about his

financial

standing, the fact that his resources were committed and

that the

brother of informant was principal controller of

their business interests. J

At

first, DAVE and TEDDY wanted to know something

of informant's connections to assure themselves he could

get gambling concessions in Puerto Rico and/or another

Caribbean area. U

In the presence of DAVE and TEDDY, informant

called L. 0. PENDLING, a Negro attorney and member of Parliament,

Nassau,

Bahamas, with whom PCI had had prior business

associations and made an appointment to meet PENDLING in

Washington, D.C., in late August, 1963.

PENDLING was

unable to keep the appointment since the March on

Washington made it impossible to get hotel reservations. U
