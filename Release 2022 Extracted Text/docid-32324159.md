In addition to the above,

extensive investigation

has been conducted by the Dallas FBI Office concerning the

bookmaking activities of MELVIN RALRHAMARSHALL, FBI #516847A

and his associate, RILEY B.AB4WCUM,

FBI. #2485459.

This

investigation has ascertained that

these bookmakers were

obtaining race results via long distance telephone from the

Delaware Sports Service, Wilmington, Delaware.

Investigation

also ascertained that during the Spring of 1963 these two

men were operating as

bookmakers over the telephones located

in MARSHALL's residence.

As a result of arrests by the Dallas

Police Department Vice Squad based on FBI information and

the FBI's investigation, both men have ceased their bookmaking

operations and are now legally employed, although the investi-

gation concerning the possible violation of federal statutes

is continuing.

On February 3, 1964, information was received from

DL T.7 that Dallas area

bettors, using information obtained

Prom 2 tatt nuide Sports Publications, Inc., Los Angeles, Calyp

California (operated by SOlo GERSHENHORN) publication, wer

regularly_bedting the bookmakers in bets placed on basketball.

On February 7, 1964, DL T-2 advised that four young Dallas

area bettors

who, through their legal employment, had access

to an IBM machine were feeding data into this machine such

as point spread, home team, comparative scores, and based

on the results furnished by the machine, were betting on

T.%.
