returned an indictment charging » ISADORE MAX MILLE

and STONE's brother, Sais. OGHRON, STONE in 14 counts of Te Lf

Because of the above convictions and indictments a

according to information received from DL T-2, T-3, T-4 and
T-6, bookmakers in the Dallas area have Yecome extremely
cautious in their activities. They are no longer accepting
checks of any kind in payment of gambling debts (nine checks %

Police Department Vice Squad based on FBI information and

the FBI's investigation, both men have ceased their bookmaking
operations and are now legally employed, although the .investi-
gation concerning the possible violation of federal statutes
is continuing.
