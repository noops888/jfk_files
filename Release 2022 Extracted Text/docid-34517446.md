Employment

ROBERT SCHEER is employed as Managing Editor of
‘Ramparts’ magazine, 301 Broadway, San Francisco, California.

“Ramparts” magazine,
issue of 4/67

Portrait of SCHEER

“Human Events" publication, Washington, D.C., in its
issue of April 8, 1967, carried a story headlined, "The Inside
Story of 'Ramparts' Magazine”. A portion of this story,
"Scheer's Radicalism", reads as follows:

“Probably the best known nationally of Ramparts'
staffers is Managing Editor Robert Scheer, who, at
30, has made a career of New Leftism. A former member
of the pro-Castro Fair. Play for Cuba Committee, he
is the most articulate of the Ramparts crew es) con-
tends that he is an anti-Communist.

“Last year Scheer ran for the Democratic nomi-
nation for U. S. Congress in Berkeley, hinging his
entire. campaign on getting out of the war in Viet
Nam and getting into the 'War on Poverty.’ Several
weeks ago, Scheer traveled to Prague, Czechoslovakia,
to meet with the Communist-controlled International
Union of Students and representatives of the National
Liberation Front, the political arm of the Communist
Viet Cong in South Viet Nam. ‘

“Not publicized in his race for Congress but
revealed later was the fact that Scheer's campaign
coordinator was Carl Bloice, a 28-year-old Communist
party member. Bloice's CP membership was hardly a
secret; for several years he had been a by-lined staff
writer for People's World, the Communist weekly on
the West Coast, and then-he was publications director
of the Communist-controlled W.E.B. DuBois Clubs.

“From Berkeley to D.C.

“At last summer's Communist, party convention in
‘New York City, Bloice vas electe to the CP's National
Committee and the requirements for serving on that
policy board make it clear Bloice has been a CP member
since at least January 1964, although intelligence
agencies place it many years earlier.

"Just two months ago the newsletter of the Robert
Scheer campaign - he is keeping his organization intact
under the name of Community for New Politics (CNP) -
carried a social note: ‘Carl Bloice, heretofore
coordinator for CNP, has left Berkeley for the larger
battlefield in Washington, D.C., where he will be a
correspondent for People's World and The Worker. At
a farewell party December 23 at the home of Mr. and
Mrs. Robert Scheer, Carl was presented with several
going-away gifts, including a larger than life poster
of Mao-Tse Tung....Carl has indicated he will be an

occasional correspondent [for the Scheer newsletter]....
We all wish him the best of luck in Washington and
we feel fully comforted by the fact that we are not

losing a coordinator, but gaining a spy.'
"Tax Money Helped

"The portrait of Mao probably brought a gust
‘of laughter when it was unveiled and presented to the
Moscow-line Bloice, and the ‘gaining a spy' phrase was
simply New Left humor. The story makes two important
points: 1) Scheer's campaign manager was a Communist;
and 2) The.Capital correspondent for two Communist
newspapers will contribute occasional articles to
Scheer's campaign organization. .
"Scheer has told Human Events that he hired Bloice
‘for his technical competence’; that he likes him as
a person, but violently disagrees with his politics.

"Communist Bloice, however, was only one of Scheer's
supporters. »Another backer was the U. S. Treasury,

which channeled funds into Scheer's campaign. It
worked this way. During his campaign one of his
workers was Mrs. Phyllis Haberman O'Donnell, who has
been chairman of the Est Bay DuRfois Club. Mrs. O'Donnell
worked on a work-study program directed by the
University of California's Department of Criminology

| Gahich is now practically another Sociology Department)
and was assigned to a leftist group called Welfare
Rights Organization as a case worker. In truth, she
worked for the Scheer campaign and reported on it
at WRO meetings.

"The work-study program was originally funded
through the Office of Economic Opportunity, receives
its funds through the National Defense Education Act
and is overseen by the Department of Health, Education
and Welfare." ;

Writings

ROBERT SCHEER is the author of a pamphlet written
for the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions, which
he later condensed into an article for “Ramparts” magazine
entitled, "The Vietnam Lobby". The article purports to show
how various Americans worked to misinform the public about
Vietnam. The persons whom SCHEER holds responsible for misleading
the American people are JOSEPH KENNEDY, Cardinal SPELLMAN,
ARTHUR SCHLESINGER, JR., NORMAN THOMAS, J. BRACKEN LEE,
General EDWARD LANSDALE, MARVIN LIEBMAN, and others.

to Prague, 1967

The “San Francisco Examiner’ newspaper, issue of
February 24, 1967, carried a page 1 news article headlined,
“Ramparts Editor at Prague -ieet" by CARL ROW. This article
explained that “a few days ago a brief, cryptic report out of
Prague; Czechoslovakia, was passed among a handful of top
officials in Washington".. The report said that an editor of
"Ramparts" magazine had visited Prague and held “a long, secret
session” with officers of the Communist controlled International
Union of Students (IUS).

The article continued by stating that “Ramparts” is
the magazine that exposed the fact that the Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA) had been financing the National Student °
Association (NSA), which in’turn had worked for several years
to prevent IUS from dominating the youth of the world. The
article questioned what relationship there was between “Ramparts”
ana the IUS.

ROWAN telephoned ROBERT S ER, Managing Editor of
“Ramparts”, in San Francisco and SCHEER admitted that he had
met with representatives of the National Liberation Front,
political arm of the Communist Viet Cong, in South Vietnam,
and also with IUS officers in Prague “several weeks ago” for two
days. In response to a question as to who controlled IUS,
SCHEER replied, “It is essentially an organ of the foreign
policy of the Soviet Union”. SCHEER emphasized that he had
visited IUS headquarters strictly for journalistic reasons
and that he was in Europe writing a story for “Ramparts” on
Bertrand Russell, “(the 94-year-old British philosopher who
plans a Vietnam ‘war crimes trial' of President Johnson)", so
he continued on to Prague to check the international implications
of the “Ramparts” article on the NSA. SCHEER volunteered,

‘We don't truck with Communism in Ramparts. We compare the

U. S. position in Vietnam with the actions of the Soviét Union
in Hungary. Both are intolerable and we make no bones about it.
Any attempt to smear us at Ramparts is libelous and we'll

sue. I warned the same thing when they were muttering

about me being a Communist.when I ran for Congress".

a political movement in this District and this campaign was

only the opening wedge."

During the interview, SCHEER said the cost of running
his campaign had been $35,000 to $40,000, most of it being
donated by "students, housewives, longshoremen and what-have-you,”
and none of it coming from his own pocket. He said, "When I
started this campaign I didn't have a dime."

The “National Guardian" (NG) newspaper, issue of

Brown Hints 3rd - Party Move, a New Trend in California
Politics". This article reported on the state-wide conference
on power and politics which was held at East Los Angeles College,
Los Angeles, California, on the weekend of September 30 -
October 2, 1966. The sessions brought together opponents of
the Vietnam war and those disillusioned with both major political
parties seeking unity. The article stated the following
vegarding the part played in the conference by ROBERT SCHEER:

"Robert Scheer, foreign editor of Ramparts magazine,
young, eloquent, whose near-win in the Oakland primary
was closely watched by the White House, posed the question
that was to lead to the split. How is it possible, he
asked, to be against the war in Vietnam, to back the Ft.
Hood Three, and the anti-war demonstrations -- while at
the same time voting for Democratic Gov. Edmund G. srown
for re-election? 'The kids who refuse to fight in
Vietnam,' he said, ‘are the real heroes.' He warned
that 'we are close to war in China and may be only
weeks away from fighting in North Vietnam, and
called for ‘structural change! American society.

His was to prove the dominant vcice at the conference."

The article continued by explaining that a serious
split developed over whether to support mither the Democratic
nor Republican candidates for Governor of California. The
article said "among those who backed the ‘lesser evil’ proposal
when the standing vote was taken were left liberals, communists,
labor leaders, Democratic politicians." Many in this group
left the conference because they would not support the Republican
candidate for Governor as a means of forcing Governor BROWN to
take a stand in opposition to the Vietnam war.

DU sponsored a ineeting December 2, 1966, in the
auditorium of Los Angeles Trade College, 700 block, Washington
Boulevard, Los Angeles, with from 1,000 to 1,500 people in
attendance. The topic of the discussion was “What “ill the New
Development on the Left Be?" ROBERT SCHEER from “Ramparts”
magazine, EUGENE GENOVESE from Rutgers College in New Jersey,
and DOROTHY HEALEYfrom Southern California District CP were the
speakers. HEALEYspoke first, stating that the most important
things for the groups on the left to do today were to unite on
common grounds and to be critical on grounds where they cannot
agree, as well as to give allegiance to the other 14 sdcialist
countries in the world. She described these countries as the
hope of the future. ROBERT SCHEER attacked her bitterly, his
main contention being that he felt he could not even say he was
a socialist because of all the erimes that are committed in
the name of socialism. He said he could not align himself

with other countries in the socialist world because of the
barbaric deeds committed by some of these countries.

He led a vicious attack against the Soviet Union,
against the STALIN era, against the crimes that were committed
in the Soviet Union against Jewish people and Jewish culture,
and against other religious people and intellectuals in the
Soviet Union. He made reference to the two writers who had been
recently jailed in Russia. In a rebuttal and question and
answer period the attack went back and forth, mainly between
GENOVESE and HEALY against SCHEER for his anti-Soviet Union
position. SCHEER constantly brought up Hungary, stating that
the oppression that went on in Hungary is no different than the
oppression of the United States in Vietnam. He also said the
Soviet Union is a sick society just as the U. S. is a sick
society, and he is quite sure that the workers in each society
are not much aware of or care about the reletive difference of
the sickness.

SCHEER's remarks are reported in the December 10, 1966 issue
as follows:

“Scheer, who ran as a peace candidate in the
Democratic primary in the Seventh Consressional District,
winning nearly 45% of the vote, spoke of the kind of
revolution he would like to see. ‘Revolution is better
than rebellion,' he said, ‘but I am interested in
what a revolution will lead to....Soviet society is
vicious....I want a revolution that means the night
of a man “to control his own life.’

"Referring to Marxism, Scheer said, 'The. theories
don't work. The working class is not getting poorer
and poorer. :

has no ideology, (but because of that) it does not

there a New Left?

°'The old Left was tired, cynical, frightened...
LSD is more important than (considered by the 'Old

Dream and said it isn't so great have made a statement
more profound than anything the Old Left has ever
made'."

"Editor Attacks U. S. Policy in Vietnam; Sees National Peril".
In this article it was stated that ROBERT SCHEER had delivered
a speech at the Kaymond College High Table, University of the
Pacific, Stockton, California, on September 7, 1966. SCHEER
maintained that the concept of an international communist
conspiracy was false and the U. S. is mistaken in considering
it a unified, ever-growing force that can only be contained by
force. He stated that the communist conspiracy is’ a movement
that does not hold together because of nationalistic interests.
He cited the.Sino~Soviet dispute and the international
squabbling between satellite countries and the major communist
powers. He said the Vietnam conflict began as an internal
dispute and if the U. S. withdrew from the conflict this
withdrawal would reaffirm the communists’ confidence in the
possibility of peaceful co-existence.

He concluded that if anyone is genuinely concerned

about American security, he is going to have to work to

reverse American foreign policy.

‘The Guardsman’, weekly student newspaper at City
College of San Francisco, in its. issue of October 19, 1966,
carried a news article headlined, ‘Scheer Lectures on Involvement
in Southeast Asia’. The article stated ROBERT SCHEER spoke at
the College Theater to a capacity audience. He was reported
to have reviewed the historical changes in Vietnam, the French
role in Vietnam affairs, and the limited policy set by President
KENNEDY of only sending 30,000 advisors as “technical aid only
for_a limited period of time to prevent a colonial posture”.
The article stated further, “In a summary ccnclusion SCHEER
said that if there is an international communist movement, it shoulc
cease to exist, that there are hardly two communist countries
that coexist, that communism is in truth a form of nationalism
and that practically speaking, ‘it does not exist’." ~

"The Daily Cardinal“, student newspaper of the

"“tanti-Communism is what holds the American people
together, not the Judaeo-Christian ethic,' radical
author Robert Scheer told 500 people in the Social
Science building Thursday.

"He argued that the United States is attempting
to impose on.the Southeast Asian crisis the 'myth!
of a monolithic Communism and the policy of ‘contain-
ment' that developed out of the post-World War II
Eastern European situation 20 years ago.

"He said that America has become 'so imbued
with the anti-Communist mythology’ that it has become
the over-riding criteria for all, and especially
foreign policy decision-making.

“He cited the investigations of philosopher
Bertrand Russell's Vietnam ‘War Crimes Tribunal!
which purports to show American use of 'fraguentation
bombs! that are not effective militarily, bu. which
demoralize the population. ‘And these bombs are
designed not so much to kill as to torture.’

"'what is frighteningly horrible about this ‘whole
policy,’ he said, 'is that it works. It succeeds
militarily even where it fails politically.’

“He urged his listeners to ‘support the Vietcong,
or National Liberation Front...given the fact that
they are the only ones standing up to the American
‘intrusion' over there.'

‘He said that it is t the North Vietnamese
who have shown 'bad faith' in efforts to negotiate,
‘but us.' They have already offered concessions, ~
he said, ‘even though it is we who are bombing them.’

"Russian and Chinese foreign policies, before
and after the death of Stalin, he said, ‘have been
essentially conservative, and not aggressive.’ He
cited as evidence the Trotsky-Stalin conflict and
Mao Tse-tung's early differences with the regular
Chinese Communist Party apparatus over this issue.”

A meeting was held at Hospitality House, Balboa
Park, California, March 16, 1967, to hear ROBERT SCHEER talk on
the CIA (Central Intelligence Agency). He was introduced as
Editor of “Ramparts” magazine. His only comments concerning
the CIA were that the CIA was the "whipping boy" for high
officials of the U. S. Government. He indicated that if anything
went wrong with the policy of the high government officials,
they could always blame CIA for their failures.

In discussing the Vietnam war, SCHEER stated the
President of the U.'S., along with other government officials,
were guilty of murder of innocent women and children. SCHEER
then spoke of a trip he had taken to France and Belgiur.. He
said he had talked to important officials in these countries
and gained the impression that these Qfficials were opposed
to the war policy of President JOHNSON, particularly the bombing
of North Vietnam. SCHEER alleged that. there were more bombs
dropped in Vietnam than were dropped during World War II. He
claimed that the reason the U. S. was using anti-personnel bombs
against the people of North Vietnam was because they did not
agree with the U. S. and the use of anti-personnel bombs was of a
punitive nature.

SCHEER took the position of an independent criticizing
both the "Commie" and “Bircher" elements.

SCHEER went on to say that "other people will make revolutions"

FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE

The April 6, 1960, edition of "The New York Times"
newspaper contained a full-page acvertisement captioned
"What Is Really Happening in Cuba," placed by the Fair Play
for Cuba Committee (FPCC). This advertisement anncunced
the formation of the FPCC in New York City end declared the
FPCC intended to promulgate "the truth about revolutionary
Cuba" to neutralize the distorted American press.

"The New York Times" edition of January 11, 1961,
reported that at a hearing conducted before the United States

-Senate Internal Security Subcommittee on January 10, 1961,

Dr. CHARLES A. SANTOS-BUCH identified himselt and ROBERT TABER
as organizers of the FPCC. He also testified he and TARER
obtained funds from the Cuban Government which were applied
toward the cost of the aforementioned advertisement.

On May 16, 1963, a source advised that during the
first two years of the FPCC's existence there was a struggle
between Communist Party (CP) and Socialist Workers Party (SWP)
elements to exert their power within the FPCC and thereby
influence FPCC policy. This source added that during the
past year there had been a successful effort by FPCC leadership
to minimize the role of these and other organizations in the
FPCC so that their influence as of May, 1963, was negligible.

The SWP has been designated by the Attorney
General of the United States pursuant to
Executive Order 10450.

On May 20, 1963, a second source advised that
VINCENT "TED" LEE, FPCC National Office Director, was then
formulating FPCC policy and had indicated that he had no
intention of permitting FPCC policy to be determined by any
other organization. This source stated that LEE believed
that the FPCC should advocate resumption of diplomatic
relations between Cuba and the United States and should
support the right of Cubans to manage their revolution without
interference from other nations. LEE did not advocate
supporting the Cuban revolution per se.

FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE (cont'd.)

The November 23, 1963, edition of "The New York
Times" reported that Senator THOMAS J. DODD of Connecticut
had called FPCC “the chief public relations instrument of
the Castro network in the United States." It is to be noted
that Senator DODD was a member of the Senate Internal
Security Subcommittee which twice conducted hearings on the
FPCC.

The December 27, 1963, edition of "The New York
World Telegram and Sun" newspaper stated that the pro-Castro
FPCC was seeking to go out of business and that its prime
activity during its lifetime had been sponscrsnip of pro-
Castro street rallies and mass picket lines, end the direction
of an active propaganda mill highlighting illegal travel-to-
Cuba campaigns. Its comparatively brief span of life was
attributed to mounting anti-Castro American public opinion,
the 1962 Congressional hearings which disclosed FPCC financing
by Castro's United Nations Delegation, amd ultimately, the
bad publicity which the FPCC received from disclosure of
activities on its behalf by suspected Presidential assassin
LEE H. OSWALD.

On February 6, 1964, the previously mentioned
second source advised that V. T. LEE had recently remarked
that the FPCC was dead and that there were no plans to
organize another similar organization.

On April 13, 1964, a third source advised that
there had not been any FPCC activity in many months and that

May, 1965, to organize the May 21-22, 1965, community “teach-in" on
the University of California, Berkeley, California (UCB) campus.

Public literature distributed by the VDC reveals that the
purpose of the VDC is to mold public opinion to force withdrawal of
the United States from Vietnam, and to utilize dramatic, large-scale
demonstrations in increasing public alarm about the Vietnam war.

A second source advised on June 24, 1966, that at a meeting
of the San Francisco Branch of the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) in
San Francisco, California, on June 22, 1966, KIPP DAWSON, whom source
identified as a member of the Branch, commented, among other things,
that “with our help" the VDC was finally recognized as_a political
power and was under “our control.”

The SWP has been designated by the
Attorney General of the United States
pursuant to Executive Order 10450.

During the period from August 18, 1966 to October 7, 1966, the
VDC was publicly announced as having been expelled from the UCB as
a recognized on-campus organization. ,

A third source advised on September 29, 1966, that PETE CAMEJO
was the chief spokesman for the VDC in its attempts for reinstate-
ment asa recognized UCB on-campus organization. Following the re-
instatement of the VDC in October, 1966, CAMEJO decided to disband
the Campus Chapter of the United Committee Against Var (UCAW), which
he had organized to replace the VDC on the UCB campus when it was
expelled. The UCAW Chapter was disbanded and the VDC subsequently
became an “affiliate” of UCAW.

“she third source further advised that as of September 29, 1966,
the VDC was controlled and dominated by PETE CAMEJO. Source added
that the VDC is no longer under the control of the old stalwarts of
the original VDC and there is no continuity between the original and
current VDC. ;

W. E. B. DU BOIS CLUBS OF AMERICA (DCA)

A source has advised that on October 26-27, 1963,
a conference of members of the Communist Party (CP), including
national functionaries, met in Chicago, Illinois, for the purpose
of setting in motion forces for the establishment of a new
national Marxist-oriented youth organization which would hunt for
the most peaceful transition to socialism. The delegates were
told that it would be reasonable to assume that the young
socialists attracted into this new organization would eventually
pass into the CP itself. . i

A second source has advised that the founding convention
for the new youth organization was held from June 19-21, 1964, at
150 Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco, California, at which time
the W.E.B. DuBois Clubs of America (DCA) was adopted. Approx-
imately 500 delegates from throughout “the United States attended
this convention. The aims of this organization, as set forth in
the preamble to the constitution, are: "It is our belief that this
nation can best solve its problems in an atmosphere of peaceful
coexistence, complete disarmament and true freedom for all peoples
of the world, and that these solutions will be reached mainly
through the united efforts of all democratic elements. in our
country, composed essentially of the working people allied in the
unity of Negroes and other minorities with whites. We further fully
recognize that the greatest threat to American democracy comes
from the racist and right wing forces in coalition with the most
reactionary sections of the economic power structure, using the
tool of anti-Communism to divide and destroy the unified struggle
of the working people."

Over the Labor Day weekend, 1965, the DCA held a con-
ference in Chicago, Illinois, and a new slate of officers was
elected to the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the DCA.
Since Labor Day, 1965, identities of those serving on the NEC has
varied; however, according to a third source as of May, 1966,
thirteen of the fifteen members of the NEC were members of the CP
in the San Francisco Bay area.

As of July, 1966, the headquarters of the DCA was
located at 180 North Wacher Drive, Chicago, Illinois.

the San Francisco Bay area as the
SF100-46 832 Bay Area Young Socialist Alliance, aka.

the Bay Area Committee of the Young
Socialist Alliance, Bay Area Committee
for the Young Socialist)

A source advised on May 16, 1960, that the Bay Area
Young Socialist Alliance (BAYSA) was formed in February 1958,
as the Bay Area Committee for the Young Socialist (BACYS). At
a later state in its development prior to adoption of the name
BAYSA, the organization was known as the Bay Area Committee of
the Young Socialist Alliance (7ACYSA).

The source advised that as a result of a national
convention held April 15-17, 1960, at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,
the BAYSA became a branch of the national organization to be
known as the Young Socialist Alliance (YSA) and will carry out
in the Northern California area the policies of the YSA.

A second source advised April 28, 1966, that the
BAYSA is currently active and is composed of three locals:
The San Francisco YSA, the Berkeley YSA, and the San Jose YSA.

The first source advised on April 28, 1966, that the
BAYSA, although ostensibly an independent organization, is
in reality controlled by the San Francisco Branch, Socialist
Workers Party (SWP) and the Oakland Branch SWP.

The SWP has been designated by the
Attorney General of the United States
pursuant to Executive Order 10450.

YOUNG SOCIALIST ALLIANCE

The May, 1960 issue of the "Young Socialist" (YS),
page 1, column 3, disclosed that during April 15-17, 1960, a
national organization entitled "The Young Socialist Alliance"
(YSA) was established at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This issue
stated that this organization was formed by the nation-wide
supporter clubs of the publication YS.

The above issue, page 6, set forth the Founding Declara-
tion of YSA. This declaration stated that the YSA recognizes the
Socialist Workers Party (SWP) as the only existing political
leadership on class struggle principles, and that the supporters
of the YS have come into basic political solidarity with the SWP
on the principles of revolutionary socialism.

A source advised on May 23, 1966, that the original YSA
was an organization formed during October, 1957, in New York City
by youth of various left socialist tendencies, particularly members
.and followers of the SWP. The leaders of this group were the
guiding forces in the establishment of the national organization.

The source further advised on May 23, 1966, that the YSA
is dominated and controlled on a national basis by the SWP through
having SWP members comprise exclusively the National Executive
Committee (NEC). The YSA, in reality, is the youth and training
section of the SWP and the main source of new SWP members.

The headquarters. of the YSA are located in Room 535,
41 Union Square West, New York City.

- The SWP has been designated pursuant to
Executive Order 10450. ~
