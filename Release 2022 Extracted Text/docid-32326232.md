The Bureau appreciates that

during your oarly contacts

with "Clip" it was necessary to exercise care with respect to

the questions asked so you would not disclose to him more informa-

tion than you obtained from him.

Reairtel indicates that in view

of later developments this problem is not as great as it was

previously.

The Bureau desires to point out that even though the

informant may now appear more at ease with the Agents and nore

trustful of them, you should still continue to exercise extreme

caution in your conversations with him so you will not disclose i

formation in Bureau files during the course of these conversations.

With respect to the suggestion contained in the penultimate

paragraph of roairtel you are advised that it is not

felt that dis-

senination of

information recoived fron the informant can be held

in abeyance until the conditions of this suggestion are completely

fulfilled in all instances. As you undoubtedly have observed

from various communications received from the Bureau regarding the

information received from this informant, dissemination is being

made to the beparcment of Justice pronotly of those matters con.

It

be obtained by your office from the informant. It is expected

that this practice will continue to be

followed in the future.

If you have not already done

turnishing

so, quairtel immediately

information requested in Buairtel of 9/15/61.
