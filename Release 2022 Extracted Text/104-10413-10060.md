Dr, Robert H, Bahmer

Archivist of the United States
National Archives and Records Service
Washington, D.C, 20408

Dear Dr, Bahmer:

I have been asked to reply to the informal inquiries
which you and the Deputy Administrator of General Services,
Joe E, Moody, have made to this Department concerning the
authority and procedures for releasing for public disclo~ °
sure ceftain of the documentary material that was produced
or acquired hy the President's Commission on the Assassi-
nation of Prusident Kennedy (the Warren Commission).

The Commission has, of course, completed its inves-=
tigation, submitted its report, and transferred all of
its records, papers; and other documentary material. to.
the National Archives for preservation, Many scholars
and other persons are anxious to study that material,

Last year, the Executive departments and agencies
which had furnished documentary material to the Commis-
sion developed certain guidelines for determining which
of the items they had furnished could be released to. the
public, As a result of the applications of those guide~
lines, approximately two thirds of that material has been
made available to the public, :

Since the Commission did not provide any guidance or.
impose any restrictions in this regard at the time that
its files were transferred to your agency, since the Com~
mission is now out of existence, and since your agency is
now the receiver and custodian of the records of the Com-
mission, this Department believes the Administrator of
General Services, acting through you and your staff, is
now in the same legal and administrative position with

respect to the records, papers, and other documentary
material transferred to your agency by the Commission, as
the Commission was prior to that transfer.

Consequently, we believe that your agency has the i
authority and obligation to review that material and to
determine which of it should be made available to, or
withheld from,the public at this time, and to conduct
subsequent reviews of such material at reasonable inter-
vals until all of it is released, In this regard, we:
believe it would be appropriate for your reviews of that
material to be made in conformity with the guidelines
which were developed and applied by the various Executive
departments and agencies with respect to the material. they
had contributed to she Commission, However, we do not con-
sider those guidelines as imposing absolute standards. for
the release or disclosure of Commission-produced material
in your custody, If in any specific case a sound legal
basis exists for withholding or for releasing any such
material notwithstanding provisions of the guidelines,
your agency should, of course, disregard the guidelines,
Similarly, if sound-archival or other principles or rea-
sons, not inconsistent with law, exist for disregarding
the guidelines in some particular case, we believe that it
would be appropriate*for your agency to disregard the guide-.
lines. in that case. If any significant legal problem should
arise in this regard, the Department of Justice will, of
course, be happy to assist you in any way that we can,

Mr. Randall:

According to telcon between Mr. Savige (Info §& Priv) and
Mr. Johnson of Nat'l Archives on 12 Dec 75, CIA apparently
needed to review for declassification of material on Lists
1, 1A, 2 and 2A (see attachments) just the documents which
were forwarded to us along with the lists by NARS. Mr. Paul
Hartman reviewed the documents (also attached and has made

appropriate notations for detlassification.
