Confidential Informant BA T-1, who is familiar with

March 20, 1964, that he had had no recent contact with JOE :
CORBI except that he had seen him for the first time in several
years. He mentioned he had known JOE CORBI very well in
their younger years. He added JOE was never active in the

million dollar lottery deal out of Canada. JOE CORBI had
been picked up in Baltimore. Informant mew that before this

Brewery and when Free State Brewery went out of business he
took over thé management of the Villa Nova Night Club.

On March 6, 1964, Confidential Informant BA T-2
advised that the prior arrangements with FRANK CORBI regarding
weekly lay-offs from numbers operators to FRANK CORBI through
HITTY WILDSTEIN had been cancelled. Informant advised that CORBI
was not then receiving lay-off money from any gambler in
Baltimore due to instructions received by CORBI from JOE GALLO,
a New York hoodlum. This weekly lay-off money was not to be
collected uhtil JULIUS SALSBURY is released from confinement
for evasion of Federal income tax. .
