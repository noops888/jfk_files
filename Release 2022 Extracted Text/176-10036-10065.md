FUNDING

I. Cuban financing of subversive operations in Latin

America is _9a8y to-ascertain and bard—to documents

Our evidence shows that it is generally effected

by couriers carrying cash.

A.

A Venezuelan politician, Fabricio Ojeda, re-
turned from Cuba in March of 1962, and was seen

by several witnesses to have large quantities

. of US currency stuffed in a false-bottomed com-

partment of his suitcase: There is no law
against bringing currency into Venezuela, so

that authorities could. not even determine how

*.much he had brought in. Ojeda later was cap--

tured,. tried, and sentenced for guerrilla ac-

tivity.

A Nicaraguan exile,’ Julio Cesar Mayorga Porto=
carrera, was flying from Mexico to Honduras in
September, 1961, when weather forced the plane
to overfly Honduras and land in Nicaragua. He
was found to be carrying $3,600 in cash from
Cuba for ‘Nicaraguan rebels in Honduras. ©

Last March Ecuadorean troops raided a guerrilla

training camp in the mountains west of Quito and

arrested some 48 members of the URJE. (Union of
Revolutionary Ecuadorean Youth): The ‘leaders:‘of
‘the pany admitted having ‘received guerrilla
training in Cuba, but there’ was’-no other evidence
at the time of any Cuban involvement. The URJE;
however, was a Communist-front group whose leaders
had thrown off the discipline of the regular Con-
munist Party, and this January the Communists can
aged to have a URIE convention, run by Young Con-

nunista, expel the. leaders. They were accused,

- according to published ——— of having wasted

$44,000 supplied by Cuba for guerrilla activities.

One of our reliable sources in the Communist Party

D.

/ has informed us that the
next-to-last Cuban chargé in Quito blamed the
fiasco on the fact that his successor had passed”
the money to the URJE without coordinating with
the regulay” Communist party.

A highly. placed Guatemalan Communist who defected

‘last November has given us a specific account of

procedures by which Cuba sent cash to Mexico to
buy weapons which were then smuggled into Guate-

mala.

We also have considerable evidence ‘of involved
bank ‘transfers by which Cuban money eventually |
reaches latin American ‘front groups to. pay for
political and propaganda activity. In some
countries where the Cubans still have diplomatic.

missions, we have. obtained photostats showing

‘that Cuban diplomats paid for printing ‘of front-

group ‘propaganda .

gust ldst month, one of the first Brazilians to F
receive guerrilla warfare training in 1961. was
picked up-with a suitcase full of ammunition he
was carrying to some of those same guerrilla
training camps exposed when the Varig plane

crashed in Peru, Interestingly enough, the

Brazilians believe ‘that ‘the money Cuba had been

providing for ‘the camps actually came from Com-

munist China. ‘Since the exposure of the Varig.

first reached the Cuban embassy in Rio with

their complaints about mismanagement, confusion,

and corruption--the Cubans have apparéatly

shows it is still :limping along. The man with.
the suitcase full of ammunition said that a woman
attorney. in Rio had given him —_ money to: ‘buy a
large hacienda as a new guerrilla camp. We know

that this woman is a cut-out in the communica~
tions between . the pro-Communist Peasant Leagues,

which have run the camps, and the Cuban embassy.

The principle that guerrillas must be self- 'sustainé

ing. has obviously been applied to finances as well.

Communists have staged waves of bank robberies in

Venezuela, Peru, and Argentina,

A.

The most spectacular hold-up was that of a bank
ina Lima suburb last year which netted almost
$100,000. Some of the participants have been
caught and are ‘being tried ‘in the mass trials .
of. more than 200 Communists just starting in

Peru. We know that the hold-up was carried out

: by. a combination of guerrillas and ordinary

criminals, who divided the ‘loot fifty-fifty.
Some of ‘the share of. the common criminals has
been recovered, but the Cotimunist half is be-~
lieved to have reached the sizeable guerrilla
forces of Hugo Blanéo in the Cuzco valley:

Just last week a bank in an outlying Veriezuelan

‘€6wn was robbed of $25,000 by’ men wearing FALN

armbands,

Argentine police last July raided a Buenos Aires

warehouse and found evidence that it had been
