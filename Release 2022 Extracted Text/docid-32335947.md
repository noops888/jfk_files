Re Miami letter to Bureau 5/22/63, captioned

"ISMAELA MARGOT PENA FERNANDEZ, aka; PSI-CUBA, Butile

105-115547, in which leads were set forth to establish

identity and whereabouts of subjéct.

On 6/12/63, PSI PENA, adding to intormation she

previously furnished,

stated, that FRANCISCO/RODRIGUEZ

TAMAYO,

Cuban exile at Miami,

had attempted at time of subject's

arrival in U.S. from Cuba, about end of 1962, to have

subject appear for interview on radio program of Cuban

commentator JUAN AMADOR.

However, this plan did not

materialize, apparently because subject did not

want such

interview.

Thereafter her whereabouts became unknown.

On 6/14/63, PSI PENA stated she contacted the

wife of RODRIGUEZ TAMAYO on 6/13/63,,

and ascertained that

the husband of subject was named LUIS

" PSI did

not, however,

determine the whereabouts of subject and

husband and believed this information was not currently

known to RODRIGUEZ TAMAYO or wife.

Records of INS, Miami, and the Cuban Refugee

Center, Miami, checked on 6/14/63, were negative on LUIS

COJIGAL.

These records were previously found negative

*on subject.

Miami will continue through PSI PENA to develop

information leading to location and identity of subject

and husband:

If PSI is unproductive in this matter direct

interview of FRANCISCO RODRIGUEZ TAMAYO will be undertaken

but in a manner to protect PSI, To date interview of RODRIGUEZ

has been withheld to avoid compromising the PSI
