Our Nr. 486.% .

le The statement by the Texas state authorities that the slaying of
OSWALD closes the investigation of the KENNEDY assassination brought on public
reactions of doubt by some segments of the,information media (commentators and
journalists) of the intentions of the Daltas police who conducted the investi-
gation. This in turn facilitated the qécision of the federal authorities to
step into-the investigation immediately. R. KENNEDY's hand can also be seen
in this. Therefore, a struggle between the right and groups close to KENNEDY
will continue over the political jmplications of the attempt. It must be
expected that in the near futurg‘it will pass to more basic matters of. foreign
and internal policies of the new president. Although the right was not success-
ful, so far, in obtaining a }tigh degree of anti-communist tension in the
community, and force, in this way, JOHNSON to immediately withdraw from
KENNEDY's line, undoubtedly the reaction expanded its influences. Its repre-
sentatives in Congress,* HICKENLOOPER. for example, began an‘open.attack against
KENNEDY's policy of seeking agreements with the Soviet Union, emphasizing with
this the hope that JOHNSON will not be such an "inexperienced" politician.

2. In tHe UN great importance is attached to JOHNSON's italks with
MIKOYAN, DE GALLE and ERHARD (the level and number of the FRC delegation
attached special attention). The Western delegations of Europeans and Scandi-
navians, with whom we talked, avoided any speculation whatsoever as to the
result ofthe talks. |

seit a highzlevel delegation (the remaining countries of the People's Democ-
racies sent thé €hiefs of the delégations of the UN Session). At the airport
in New York Ambassador YOST (one of the two deputies of STEVENSON, who went to

Washington alone). greeted them, thanking them officially for the trip. The
Press was very courteous.
