By letter 1/3/62, Pittsburgh Office advised the Bureau of
the fact that all informants and sources familiar with any
phases of the activities of the MANNARINOs had agreed that
the IRS raid in New Kensington, Pa., on 8/24/61, the
Westmoreland County raid of 9/17/61, the FGJ inquiry in
Pittsburgh, and the election of reform candidates for the
New Kensington city administration had all combined to make
an information vacuum in that city, due to drastically
curtailed gambling and the resultant inactivity of the
MANNARINOs and their associates-employees. :
