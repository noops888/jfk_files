ADMINISTRATIVE

This report has been delayed due to the preoccupation of

the preparing Special Agent with important investigative

aspects of this and related cases.

However, pertinent

information has been furnished to

the Bureau and interested

offices as received by appropriate communications.

Information in this report of possible value to the

Internal Revenue Service has been furnished orally to

Special Agent JACK SCHWARTz, Intelligence Division,

Internal Revenue Service, Pittsburgh, who is conducting

the investigation of subject for his service.

By letter 1/3/62, Pittsburgh Office advised the Bureau O1

the fact that all informants and sources familiar with any

phases of the activities of the MANNARINOs had agreed that

the IRs raid in New Kensington, Pa., on 8/24/61, the

Westmoreland County raid of 9/17/61, the FGJ inquiry in

Pittsburgh, and the election of reform candidates for the

New Kensington city administration had all combined to make

an information vacuum in that city, due to drastically

curtailed gambling and the resultant inactivity of the

MANNARINOs and their associates-employees.

INFORMANTS

Except in one instance, the T symbols utilized in this

report will be the same, where applicable, as those used

in previous reports back to, and including, that of 7/28/61.

In the case of PCI JAMES W. BURGART, who has been PG T-25

in prior reports, recent conversations with Departmental

Attorneys WILLIAM KEHOE and JOHN MULLANEY have caused

SA FORSYTH to believe that they have guessed his identity,

and for this reason,

the precaution of giving a new

I symbol to him will be taken.

PG T-2 is PG 612-C.

PG T-3 IS PG 615-C.

PG T-8 is PCI HERBERT LEERAY.
