We Discover Lee OSWALD in Mexico City

CIA a4a produce ove very significant piece of information on Lee
OSWALD before he shot President Kennedy. On 1 October 1963, our Mexico
City Station intercepted a telephone call Lea OSWALD nade from someplace
an Mexteo City to the Soviet Mabassy there, using his own rane. Speeling
broken Russian and using bie true nove, OSWALD was talkin: to the Bubassy
= OBYEDXOY, who often answers the phone. OSWALD said he bad visited
the ons previous Saturday (23 ceptenbar 1963) ona spoken to o
consul whose name he hed forgotten, and who hea prowised to send a tele-
gran for him to Washington. He wanted to know if there vere ——

Mla plece of inforsation was profuse fron a telephone tap ceutes

vhich ve operate Jointly with the office of the President of Mexico. It



14-00000

the Soviet Exbassy in Mexico Clty was probably the Lee OSWALD who bea

is highly secret and not known to Mexican security and law enforcesent
officials, who have their own center. Our joint center produces ireat
nasees of telephone intercepts which are transeribed and revieved by our
small staff in Mexico Clty. By 9 October, the OSHALD telephone conversa-
ton of 1 October had been transeribea and a summary of It cabled to
Wasaington. sme mane Lee OSNALD meant nothing special to our Hexico
City Station, but in their report they did Judge him to be on American
nale.

The cabled report vas veceived in Washington on 9 October ana checked |

in our files, where it was iimedlately noted that the Lee OSWALD phoning

éefectea to the Soviet Daten tn 1959 ond xetuened to the USA ta 1962. On
10 October 1963, the day after the report from Mexico City, CIA Headquarters
sent out a cabled report sbout Lee CSWALD's phone call to the Soviet
Bubassys the report vent to s FBI, the Departuent of State (because
OSHALD vas a US citizen), and to the Havy Departuent (because he was a

former Marine.) ‘The cabled report to these agencies highlighted the

SEGEET



14-00000

LikLiheod that the Lee OSWALD mentioned was probably the former defector.
A copy of this same cable was delivered by hand to the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, with which we have no cable link. The sae day

fn long cable vent out to Mexico City informing our Station of the back~
ground of defector Lee OSWALD and asking for nore information. Our Station
vas instructed — ite inforretion on the phone call te the Mexico
City offices of the FAI, the Enbassy, the Naval Attschs, and the Imsigra-
tion a Raturalization Service. ‘hia was done.

In ita original report of 9 October, Mexico City hed said it had a

photogrepa of on opparent American male leaving the Soviet Embassy ba

1 Cctoder 1963, the day OSWALD phone there. A very sensitive operation

in Mexico City provides us with secretly taken photographs of many but not
all visitors to the Soviet Eubassy there, taken with telezhoto renses.
Accordingly, ve cabled the Ravy Departuent on 2h October 1963 asking fox
a photomeph of Loe GSIALD froa hie Marine Corps days 0 ve COSLA coepexe
photos. We had not received thia photogreph by 22 Fovenber 1963, but in

any event, it turned out that the man photosraphead outside the Soviet

3



14-00000

Bubassy was not OSWALD anyway. As chance would have it, none of our

several photo obsesation points in Mexico. City had ever taken en identi-

flable picture of Lee OSKALD.

Our Kexico City Station very often produces information like this

on US citizens contacting Soviet bloc enbasaies in Mexico City. Frequently

the infomation ve get is extressly tnerinineting, and on one or tv
ecensions ve have even been oble te apprehend and return to the USA
Anerican military personnel who are attempting to defect. In all such
cases, our Headquarters desk requests and obtains the special a of

the Deputy Director for Plans to pass the derogatory information on a US

“eltizen to other yovernment agencies. Derozatory information on Americans

ia not treated routinely; in each case the DDP or his Assistant persorally

scrutinize the information, make sure it is creéible, and decide whether and

to whom it will be passed. Only in absolute emergencies is the Hexico City

Station authorized to pasa such information directly to the FBI office in

the U.S. Embassy.

At this vriting (13 Decenber 1963) ve do not Imov what action the FAI



14-00000

and other agencies may have taken based on our report. We surmise thst the
FDI may have made local checks throush Mexican authorities to see if
Lee OSHALD waa actually in Mexico City on 1 October. Indeed, Later in-
vestization has confirmed all the details of his trip, where he stayed,
and vhat he did. To avola crossing lines with the FBI, our Mexico Station
undertook no local fuvestigation of its om. As ve row know, OSWALD left
Mexico on 3 Octebsr end was no loner there when our report was put out..
“Since thie telephone tap operation is a Joint one vith the textean
Presidency, the Mexicans also had the 1 October intercept on Les OSWALD,

but 1 apparently slumbered in their files until the agsasefontion took

“place.

A phone message from the FAI cane at about the sase time, naming OSWALD

as the possible assassin and asking for trecea. The nessaze vas passed
on at once by the Chief CI, Mr. Angleton, to Mr. Bireh OMleal of his

Special Investigations Unit. Mrs. Hetty Egeter of this Unit imediotely
recogaisea the rane of Lee OSWALD and went for his file. At the cane

tine, Nes, Bustos of the Mexico Desk, who had written our first #epart on

OSWALD om 10 October recownized the nese froa radio reports and vent '

after the same file. Mr. Reichhardt, Hexico Desk Chief, who was home on

leave, heard the news and phoned in a reminder that we bad somsthing on i

OSWALD, While we were preparing a cable to Mexico City asking them for I

more information on OSWALD, Mexico City itself heard OSWALD's nane on the

Yotse of Aserica broadcast and cabled to us a reminder of the Inforsatton

the Station had seat in on bin, . : ; \
For the next week, a dozen people in the Agency vere continuously

engaea in handling incoming nessages on the case, writing reports to be

cabled out, tracing the names mentioned, and researching files. Witain a

week, 27 cabled reports had gone out to the White House, the State Depart-

nent, and the FBI. Mauy cables of guidance ana inquiry baa been seat to



14-00000

our overseas stations, end many pieces of Infornation on OSWALD and bis
wife haa been received back. ‘The Mexico City Station researched its
telephone taps very thoroughly and came up with several more conversations
probably involving OSWALD, but not actually mentioning this name; these
connected bia also to the Cuban Consulate in Mexico City. Several Mexicans
were arrested and questioned ebout his activities, giving a good pieture
of what he was really up to. Many conferences were held with the Fal
Liaison officer vko asked us for certein actions and passed us information
from the Fat tnvestigation. On-the minus side, a host of tetwtentors,
Boe anonymous, bombarded overneas cnibassies with spurious tips on the case,
wost of which we investigated. All of these are soon discredited, bub they
ere still coming in

During thts phase of cur work, ve served prinarily in support of the
Fal, which was entrusted by ‘the President with the major responsibility for
the investigation. The FBI was toc busy to supply us vith much of Sta

own inforzation, but answers were given to specific questions we posed to

essist our investigation. The Department of State did photograph its entire

eraney:

file on OSWALD and pass thea to us, ona the FAI gave us a copy of the
Soviet Consular file on OSWALD which haa been publicly given by the Soviet
Ambassador to the Secretary of State. On Friday 6 December 1963, Deputy
Attorney General Katzenbach invited us to review the FBI's comprehensive

report on the case to make sure our sourcea vere not jeopardized ang that

our information vas correctly quoted. We found the resort highly
interesting and no threat to our security, as long as it wes read only
by the suthérdzed investigative bodies.

A particularly sinister aspect of one @ealings with the Soviets

Soviet Enbassy, the guard OBYEDXDY suggests that the Consul CSWALD haa
talked to vee KOOTIXOY if he was dark, OSWALD seens to osree with this,
but the identification 1a very casual. In his 9 November letter to the
Soviet Consulate in Washington, OSWALD gives the nane oF the man he’ dealt
with as "KOSTIH,” but there is no person of that exact naze tn the Soviet
Embassy in Nexico City. KOSTIKOY ip accredited as a Consular Attache and
does actually do a lot of consular work, but he is believed to be a
Soviet XGB officer, and it is believed that he vorks for Department 13 of
the KGB, the Departeent charged with sabotage and assassinations. the
suspicion that KOSTIXOY io a KGB officer arose from his work habits, and

his association with other KGB officers, It was hardened when it vas
