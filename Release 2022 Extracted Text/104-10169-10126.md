Preliminary Survey:

Due to the inadequacy of the submitted material, only tentative
summarising statements can be made.

Summarizing Statements:

‘The writer is evidently a.reserved and careful person who
attende to his affairs in a rather deliberate manner. He p:
good intelligence (not brillant), ia well educated and professionally
trained. He has thoroughly absorbed the material he has read and
studied and knows how to utilise it ina purposeful manner. His way:

of thinking is clear, logical and fairly adaptable. He apparently is

anxious to learn new things and.to wid:
intellectual ambitions, but the emphasis of his interests is in the
He does not pos: much originality, but he
identifies himself with well-selected patterns which may let him
appear more sophisitcated than he actually is, He discards unne
@ary and superfluous material, but he may not discern the vital pointe
in more intricate and unfamiliar problems unless properly pointed out
to him. He is a careful observer of small details which he correlates
properly to their larger aspects within his familiar frame of Fr
He combines a certain amount of imagination with sober-mindedness
and matter-of-factness. He tries to expedite his work, but he is not
likely to sacrifice accuracy to expediency. His critical faculties are
well developed and he evaluates by rather standards. Also, he
is not likely to voice his criticiem openly as he tends to avoid open
controversies, Within the area of his knowledge and experience, he
can exercise initiative and deal with the overall picture of a project.
He has some understanding for mechanical functioning which may not
be fully trained and expluited, -He can figure and calculate and he hae
learned to think in larger texms and transactions. He is conservative
in his calculations and ne will make every possible effort to get along
with the money and material at his disposal. Secretely, he would like to
pend money freely and play the role of a big shot. He has some
administrative abilities which he can exercise within a Mmited familiar
area, In relation to this, he can work out the blueprint of a plan and
supervise ite proper axecution.. He is neat and orderly and he likes to
arrange evorything in a proper manner. He can take orders, follow

his horizon. He has some

prescribed rules and regulations and he will take care that people who
work for him do the.same. In the execution of his tasks, he is exact,
conscientious and reliable. He is serious, methodical and systematic
in his approach. He can express himself in an adequate form, verbally
as well as in writing. He is able to present his material in a concise
and understandable manner. He is not likely to say one word more
than would be absolutely necessary, which is one of his customary
precautions, He is a diligent worker who pursues his aims persist-
*. ently and who does nxt rest until the last item of an assignment-is
-" completed, When ne ry, he can mu ter a considerable amount
of patience. His analyzing and synthesizing faculties are not particu-
larly pronounced, but he has a way of figuring out the implications of

times, underestimate his capabilities. He concentrates well on his
work and at the same time, takes in everything that is, going on

and information,

Emotionally, the writer is predominantly an introverted type
- who can join required extraverted professional and social activities
‘without much emotional participation. With the aid of his strong
capacity for identification, he blends in with his environment and
avoids attracting special attention. While-he is emotionally not very
mature and individualized, he is fairly well equilibrated, composed
and poised. He has his feelings and impulses under the strictest
rational control and he is not likely to be carried away by them. His
Ego-feelings are much stronger than most people who deal with him
H would suspect, He is rather confident of himeelf and inwardly may
even consider himself quite superior to others, There is almost
‘ome impertinence in his inner attitude which helps him to assert
himself and make his claims known in various indirect ways. He is
not quite as harmless as he may appear and.he knows exactly what he
is after, He proceeds with great carcfulness and precaution and he
| a iw quite clever in anticipating possible dangers. His self-defensive and
|

.self-protective mechanisms are strongly developed and he is most
secretive about his affairs, He is not likely to confide completely in
anybcdy. Unncticed, he keepa up a strong personal reserve preventing
ethers from coming too close to him. He is ego-centered and somewhat
welfish and he will not. lose sight of his personal advantage in whatever
he is doing. He haz developed a colorless and consistent facade which

may serve as a cover for various activities he wants to hide. If he
considers it necessary, he can be quite versatile and he is able to
make quick changes and switches. In a closer relationship, he can
be rather enigmatic and he may surprise by unexpected actions and
reactions, He is guided by some ideological system (most likely of
