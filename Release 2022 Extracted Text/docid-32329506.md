On 11/24/64, CG 6788-C* advised that a meeting
was held in his presence during which ALDERISIO held a
kangaroo court concerning the activities of BOB FERRELL and
BILLY DAUBER who caused a female acquaintance of ALDERISIO
to swindle $2,000 for them on a bogus whiskey deal. CATUARA
present at the meeting on behalf of DAUBER, his right hand
man and enforcer. CATUARA explained that DAUBER had no
prior knowledge that female swindler was acquaintance of
ALDERISIO and that FERRELL was most at fault because female
actually FERRELL's girl friend and he got her into it.
ALDERISIO instructed FERRELL, DAUBER and CATUARA to return
the $2,000 to the female so she could return same to ultimate
victims. ALDERISIO told CATUARA he would "make it up to
him in some other way." During the course of this meeting,
it was apparent from tenure of conversation that CATUARA
is taking orders from ALDERISIO and is, therefore, of lesser
stature in the Chicago area organized crime structure than
ALDERISIO, esi

Also during this meeting, ALDERISIO learned from
CATUARA and DAUBER that FERRELL had been receiving a 10%
cut of Worldwide Mortgage Corporation activities through i
use of FERRELL's office space at Wheeling, Illinois, where-
upon ALDERISIO became extremely provoked because FERRELL had
failed to turn over any of his 10% cut to ALDERISIO, FERRELL
was ordered by ALDERISIO to immediately get out of the 1
Wheeling office and confine his activities to First National
Mortgage Company business at Chicago, Illinois.

JOE STEIN explained to ALDERISIO a deal between
himself, DAUBER, FIDANZI and the Bank of Niles, Niles,
Illinois, wherein STEIN with assistance of DAUBER and
FIDANZI, arranged with the Bank of Niles to collect a
$33,000 outstanding loan account. DAUBER and FIDANZI
felt they had a commission coming; however, STEIN stated
this collection was not done for a fee and, therefore, no
money was coming to anyone. STEIN, in conversation with

CG 92-350 Sub 1

DAUBER, advised DAUBER that he and FIDANZI had no fee
entailed in this collection. ALDERISIO advised CATUARA
that. some times a favor is done for a bank in order to
obligate the bank to return a favor in the future, which
is of material assistance in the operation of a mortgage
brokerage business.

During the course of the conversation, ALDER
i to be apprised of i yo K Act 5 (g)(2(0)
NO in the mortgage brokerage field.

It is noted previous information concerns the
negotiation of a dispute between two factions of the Chicago
hoodlum element. It is further noted ALDERISIO and CATUARA
were not previously known to be closely associated, and they
operate in different sections of the Chicago area.
