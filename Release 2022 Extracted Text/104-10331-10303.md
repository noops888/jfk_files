drop the item as not related.

The note on the page is

Eatinger's. (copy attached)

4. 28 June 1976 - Re the copyright question; Eatinger says

to postpone the item until the Board makes a ruling. The

law is silence on copyright issue. We will describe the

document on the withdrawal sheet so researched can request

directly from CBS.

Vincent Thill and James O'Connell are releasable.

somewhere in the DCI files.

Eatinger's notes (attached) :

4 May 1964 - since we are treating "anti-Castro" activities

as related, leave the reference to books in.

24 Sept 1975 - Eatinger is having the cases searched in OGC

files

for relevance to JFK.

25. Sept 1975 - The New Orleans mail intercept operation was

of interest to the HSCA investigation and has been mentioned

in our files.

The item refers to the Senate Select

Committee and it is doubtful if it is JEK related. Eatinger

says it is our call.

26 July 1978 (memo for the Record) - Eatinger was not

comfortable with our deletion ! ]; he has originally

proposed to release.

I recommended that we at least delete

the word prison.

There may not have been many women in

prison with that background.

Falkiewicz noted his expectation that Ron Kessler's article on

President Kennedy's assassination will appear in the 14 November Wash-

ington Post.

Bolten called attention to today's Washington Post article about

David Wise's book (attached) and stated his belief that it contains details

which were not included in the Senate's published report. It was agreed

that this material was deleted from the Senate report and that Wise's

Laccount is correct. In response to the DDCI's query, Bolten stated that

we had not had prior word of the Wise book.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

Staff Meeting Minutes of 26 July 1978

The Director was on leave; Mr. Carlucci was testifying on the Hill;

Mr. Blake chaired the meeting.

Mr. Blake asked letu to explain the disturbing ABC story emanating

from Havana.

Hetu said that ABC reporter Reynolds called him and said

that as part of Cuba's 26 July celebration, a double agent will march in

a parade and appear at a press conference, saying that CIA tried to prove

that Cubans were involved in President Kennedy's assassination. Castro

also plans to announce CIA activities in Africa to track the Cuban presence

there. Hetu told Reynolds that he hesitated to comment at the present time

but the charge regarding the Kennedy assassination was ridiculous.

McMahon summarized an FBI report that a Cuban Intelligence Service

official has been

in contact with an unidentified journalist in connection

with the World Youth Festival now taking place in Cuba.

The journalist

stated that the festival will include a tribunal that will condemn CIA.

activities throughout the world. It will also reveal the above-mentioned

charge that the CIA tried to prove Cuban involvement in President Kennedy's

assassination.

Former CIA agents will be revealed as well as proof of CIA

activities in Africa. This report also mentioned that a press conference

will be held.

Greaney (for OGC) added that on 21 July an OGC representative paid

off a former agent in New York Who had been in prison in Cuba." She had

been a member of the original 26th of July Movement and seemed to have

become extremely radical and bitter.

Greaney said that he would not be

surprised if this individual appeared at any of the above-mentioned

activities.

Responses

to your questions on DCI Morning Meeting Minutes

1. Chuck does not see the need to coordinate DCI Bush's

memo to DDCI; however, it does contain comments by Senatox

Inouye. If we want to cover all bases,

I can contact OCA.

2.

We assume (Merhige) is an Agency employee and should be

protected. We do not recognize his name.

V

The reference to Wise's book would constitute "official

acknowledgment".

It will require a bit of research to

determine what they were referring to.

Re copyright issue, still waiting on Eatinger to get

back to me.

the comments on de Morenschildt's mental state was

released in the Oswald 201.'

6.

Vincent Thill retired overt (see attached card); I am

also checking with OS.

7.

James O'Connell was exposed in Peter Wyden's Bay of

Pigs; I am checking with oS.

8. Regis Blahut

- released in JPK material; we coordinated V

with SO at the time.

9. Re LBJ Library document, I will check with Pittman.
