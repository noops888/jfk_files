in Spain (which Espinosa entered illegally), Eepinosa wes in-
formed that there is a plan to overthrow the Castro regime
and to kill Castro and some of his main leaders, The plot is
led by Cubeleg and some of the March 13 Movement, plus (I be-
lieve) some military officers, They must move very quickly
because-more and more people are learning of the plot and
there-is growing risk of exposure, They are anxious to have
some coordination, or at leaet consultation, with responsible
Americans, .: They are not confident: that they could win an all-
out fight against the Castro forces, and are thinking more in
terms of taking control for a short time (perhaps only ea few
hours), -killing Castro and his most effective men (thus
ruining the Castro movement forever), end then trying to hold
out .for as long as feasible. . It-is essentiel that they know
what, if anything, the Americans might-do to help, now end/or
later, when the coup is. attempted, Also, they wished to alert
the United States Government.to what was being planned,

O'Brien of the New York FBI to ask that the latter arrange for

-his to talk with some serious and relieble man from CIA,

O'Brien did so, Espinose then told the foregoing story, end
more, to a CIA men named "Hal", Hal impressed Espinosa as
being intelligent and reliable, Eepinose understands thet Hal

events, Espinosa wes assured CIA understood the urgency of ¢

running out, LEspinosa's friends in Paris keep caliing him,
ceutiously asking whether there has been some "response",

but Espinosa has had to keep putting then off, Meanwhile,

the Cuban who was waiting in Spain for the answer has had to
xeturn.” Espinosa keeps waiting to hear whether the Americens
will play bail with the Cubelds “group. The plot has lasted
for over 18 months, and the plotters plan to go ahead very
soon no matter whether the Americans “play ball" or net, One
reagon is that they almost have to go ahead now, for the plot
will soon be discovered and then it will be entirely hopeless.

Espinosa also referred to @ jeweler by the name of
teppéldino (spelling?), located at 47th Street, in New York
City, Teppedino works for CIA and has frequent contact with
the Cuban Ambassador, in Paris, The Ambassador regularly dis-
poses of jewelry and other valuables made available from Cuba.
He does this through Teppéltino, However, the latter fools
CIA. , For exemple, the Ambassador agrees to sell for $80,000.
Teppel{ino informs CIA the price is $110,000, and quietly
pockets the difference. On the other hand, Teppeldino and

CIA think the Cuban Ambassador does not know he is working for
CIA, but the Ambassador does know,

Espinosa is determined to bring the very dangerous
situation o£ the Cuban plot to the attention of some top level
official in the United States Government unless he receives
at least some reply from CIA.

Comment:

Espinosa was not overly tense and did not indulge in his-
trionics, but I felt he was quite determined to push this
matter further if he did not get some response within the very
near future. I cannot, and do not have to, judge his reli-
ability on the basis of this one conversation, However, if
had to guess at this point I would be inclined to accept mos
cf what he said about actual events, But of course there
all sorts of cbvious possibilities, including provocation.
