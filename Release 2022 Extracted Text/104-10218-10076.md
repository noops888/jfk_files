LICOOKY Project
Termination of LICOOKY-1

"ACTION RLQUIRED - REFTRENCES

“1, Attached herewith is the LILINK report on the
terwination of LICOOKY-1. This report was received fron
LILIMK on 24 June 1966.

2. Forwarded under separate cover rre two copies of
the Secrecy and Tormingtion agreezent signed by LICCCKY-1,
in true name, on 23 Juno 1963.

3. At the tine of termination, LICOCKY-1 was given (1)
salary for Fobruary 1966, (2) ono-way airfare from Hexico
City to New York, and (3) Federal Tax refund amounting to
9,005.00 HN. The household itens in her possession at the
time of termination, which belonged to the Station, were
sold tc her for US $300.00.

4. It should be noted that although LICOOKY-1 claims
she intends to remain in the United States, she retained her
apertment, which yas turaed over to a rental agency for sub=
renting. The Station believes that she intends to retura
within the next several months or so should it devolep that
she cannot find suitable work in the New York aren. Should
she do so on her own it may bo that the Station would want
to wrke occasional use of her, and for that purpose a post
office box to which she can write to initiate contact was
given her prior to departure.

3 Fi Dri of Dispatch

1. LICOOKY-1 has been terminated effective 1 July 1966.

i

The last meoting with her was held on 23 June. She was

paid her salary through 30 June, her income tax refund

for the period 1 January 1965-= 30 June 1966 and given

aa

= _ | | money for «ic-way air fare to New York City. She was
: conpletely catisfied with the financial teras of the. e

settlement. A Termination Secrecy Oath, signed in true
: t

“none, was © stained.

aie stilaadivating

2. L-i plans t» return to New York on or about 1 July, she
said she wiil look for a job thore, and ig confident she

witl have no difficulty obtaining one. She does not yet

{
t
i
4
}

know where jhe will be living.

3. Le is sub’ -tting the apartment she occupies here. She
; ee purehas:d the KUBARK-owned household effects which |

hee 2m 1: .cd to her for that apartment. For this

reasoa, in .iditicn to the fact that she had acquired

many close é:iez25 and interests here as a result of five

years resicc.c., ihe Station expects that she will return

to Kexico, <i sh she insists she has no plans to do

int ea

50.



‘

She was given a post office box address te use to contact
the Station in the event that she does return to Mexico
and feels it necessary to do so. But no committment was
made to her regarding any future contact or payment for

information. : ”

She was previously told that the telephone number of the
New York KUBARK office is listed in the directory and

_, she could call that office it contact-were necessary while - - -

she was in the United States. She asked if that would

still be the case and

is told that it was but only to
attempt such contact for an important or urgent matter.
But sin:se she tends to liberally apply importance to a
wide viciety of events and subjects, and since she is
likely to be short of money shortly after arriving, it

would ix2t be surprising if she did try to establish such
contact. :

Reference: HMA 26,621, 15 July 1965

1, LICOOKY-1's efforts as described in reference have
substantial merit and some potential particularly if the Station can
find a way to tie them in with the LIREAM effort in the intellectual

field. .
ciel

2. LICOOKY-1 certainly is to be commended for her effort in
: getting writers both of the right and left such as Carlos PELLICER
= Camara to join the AEM. From a KUBARK standpoint the most iutcrestiag
contact is the one with PELLICER because he has been the reported force
behind the COMES/CLE effort in Hexico. i

. 3. Although her assigned tasks as reported in pare 7 a, b end d
ogtie LILINK memo do not entail making her witting of other Btativa
reacts <ogaged in HASPAVN Ops among the intellectuals, on awendscnt
to her OA is required, and one has been requested. If her efforts
progress to the point where she might be able to influence leftist i
writers in their efforts to establish the CLE in Mexico (para 7 ¢ of
LILINK meso) Headquarters should be forvarded your ideas on why and how
LICGOKY-1 should be used as an active HHSPAWN agent, and another
anucudsent will be required for this role.

|

4. AEDRIETTE will discuss this operation with the Station duriag q

his TDY. I 4
5. Ip view if the restricted OA vhich confines KUBARK's : | i

essoclation with LICOOKY-1, it is important that Hcadyuarters reaain
awarc of apy unusual activity in ber personal life which sight effect
her security or the granting of amendments to her OA for individual i
operatione. Therefore, we tould appreciate your kecping us inforned
om a more timely basis of sny undertakings such as the recruiteeots
for membership in the AEM described im reference. ~Z ee E

1. The first steps to organize the Mcxican ¥riters*

-tion (AEM - Asociacién de =Escritores ce

in February of 1964 after Bartolome Costa~/

co) were taken

ic and the Zaplana

Bookstores published a proposal in the metropolitan newspagers,

offering to establish a new series of library prizes iad urging

the Mexican writers to join am associatien that could provide

material berefits for its nenbkers. . The first mecting of the

AEW was held on 12 August 1954, For some tine the remained,

as insignificant as other sirilar o 4 hed been

organized fron time to tixe, such as the Society of Literary Au-

thors and The Society of Friends of ° ican Books wich never

achieved any effectiveness or respectability. Mexico's establisi2..

and well knovn writers have always shunned these organizations.

2. LICOOKY-1 became interested in the 4

S! through her triends:

with Costa-Aric and say the possibility of building the
an organization which would include the middle of the read and
right wing authors who had been systematically boycottedc since
the Lfzare Cérdenas' regime when Narciso Snssols, a nember of the

Connunist Party, was Minister of Education.

3. LICCOKY-1 began a one wan campaign of recruiting relatively
well known right wing writers who could not be considered medicere
or nonentities. As LICCCKY-i's campaign began to succeed it be~
cane easier to recruit the more important writers of Mexico cover-

ing the whole political spectrum. In October of 1964, LICCOxY-2

persuaded Carlos Pellicer CS:ara, well &

orn Huxdcan post, to

join the AE, It then became casier to get other well kn

writers to join, In all LICCCKY-2 recreited ubout 30 of the well

knovn Mexican writers to cone into the AE!
