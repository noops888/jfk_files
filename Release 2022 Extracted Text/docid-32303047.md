as of September 1,' 1959, SAM MANNARINO was drinking to excess,
being drunk almost every day.

On Décember 11, 1959, PG T-1, who has furnished reliable
information in the past, advised that. SAMUEL MANNARINO is
not. drunk daily but is under the influence of narcotics
which he takes to minimize the pain he 1s suffering from
his spreading abdominal malignancy. PG T-1 estimates that

In January; 1958, ENRIQUE CASADA, dn exiled Cuban, opposed to
thé administration of Cuban President FULGENCIO BATISTA, told
MILTON that. he had an opportunity to obtain a boat. CASADA
explained that. JOB MEROLA, of: Miami Beach, hada Cuban girl
friend who could arrange for the purchase of this boat.

CASADA took MILTON to the Garden of Allah Motel and Apartments,
Miami ,Beach, where the boat "Menace" was docked, MILTON tested
the engines and told CASADA that they would have to be fixed,
after which CASADA told MILTON that he might use this boat
within a short time for an excursion into the Florida Keys.
CASADA then took MILTON to JOE MEROLA's apartment in the
Garden of Allah Motel. MEROLA told MILTON that he owned the
‘wenace." CASADA then. told MILTON that some Cuban friends of

the boat encountered more serious éngine trouble. The Cubans
went ashore in a dinghy to obtain aid. In the meantime, a
storm came: up and the ~ began to leak, forcing MILTON te
peach it on = sand bar. . Later that night, agents of the
United States Customs Service, searched the "Menace" but found

trip was actually. intended to have been a military expedition
to Cuba and that the Agents of the U.S.. Customs Service had
taken into custody three of the individuals who had been-
passengers on the “Menace.” HILTON later attempted to contact
JOE MEROLA but could not locate him. :

ADMINISTRATIVE

It. is noted that 1t was set out in rerep that PCI JAMES,
THORNTON McCLOWRY;- MD; Springdale, Pa., advised that Father
NICOLA FUSCO, Pastor of Mt. St. Peters Roman Catholic
Church, New Kensington; Pa., was close to the MANNARINOs,
and in Jate 1958, hid’SAMUEL MANNARINO in the church's
apostulate house: when SAMUEL MANNARINO was being sought

for service of a Subpoena «

On July 23, 1959, PCI McG]
IIT, as follows:

¥ iad ‘ised SA THOMAS G. FORSYTH;

on about July 13, 1959;°Father FUSCO asked PCI if he would
give SAM MANNARINO a thorough physical examination. PCI
replied that if cancer were indicated, he could do nothing
for MANNARINO;.at which point Father FUSCO indicated he knew
that MANNARINO was suffering. from a malignancy, PCI feels
there are only two reasons why he should be approached to
examine. MANNARINO: éithe SAM MANNARINO is frightened and
looking desperately for other, contrary.medical opinion;

or MANNARINO -intends to "use" PCI-by having him subpoenaed
at a later date to testify that MANNARINO is too i11 to appear
in any court proceeding. PCI wanted to ‘know if there was any
reason the FBI would not want him to examine SAM MANNARINO,
and PCI was advised that any decision along this line was his
- alone.

on September 15, 1959; PCI McCLOWRY advised that Father
FUSCO and his.chauffeur departed on September 11; 1959, by
jet airline flight to Rome, Italy, purpose of visit unknown,
PCI stated that this ‘trip was. paid for.in its entirety by
the MANNARINOs, PCI also advised that prior to Father
FUSCO's. depature, ‘Father FUSCO told PCI that it would not
be necessary for him to give a physical. examination to
SAMUEL MANNARINO, inasmuch as MANNARINO has become more or
less resigned to the inevitability of his death from his
cancer,
