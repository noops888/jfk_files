31. March 1961

SUBJECT: Gerald P. Hemming, Ji. lovas to diani to Engage in inti-casiro

1. Gerald Patrick Henring, Je. (erroneously referre: to in 00-1(5)-?, 170, 536

as Jerry P. Henning, Jr.) informed Hendrickson of the los Angeles Fiel dirice

thar he was moving to Miani, Florida and would arrive there on Mondsy, 20 :r 61.

Huzing stated that he was going to contact Jimmy Gentry, 953 S.W. 22nn St.,

Agi. 8, Mismi, Florida (Telephone: FRanklin 4-3255) and

that these tid nan were

tl.: going to proceed with a plan of action aired at orgainizing a anti group

of professionals" (experienced revolutionaries) who would atrempt to conduer:

cartain reconnaissance operations on the mainland of Cuba via paracint: drops

and either light plane or water pick-ups. lemming also stated he winted tu

do what ho could in Miami to attempt to unite the anti-Castro forces these and

also to lessen the influence of a number of "mercenaries" who had joined various

of those movements and were doing it more harin

than good while bleeding off

much of the available money.

2.

The available background information on Harming was furnished in

LA-23939 (00-A(5)-3,170,536). Some additional Information is included sa

the attached Application for Conmission or Warrant Rank, US Navy Di Nev!!

Reserve, filled out by kenning during his tour with the US Marine Corps and

dacid 23 Jun 58. Hemming also clains to have been unofficially che deed out:

on nonerous aircraft wiie serving with tha Cuban Air Foice during ric First

half of 1950 includlug the L-20, F-47, AC-o, Cessna 170 and Piper Printear.

I: does not have a a connicial or private pilos licoose. In addici..:, ":

reporicily maintained an interest in parachuting during his recent .:

Los Angolos (Saptenber 1960-llarch 1961), and claimed to have jumped ar leas!:

once a month with one of the local parachute and siydiving elubs.

3. The above information is passed on bacause it appears likuly that the

Agency may wish efther (1) to make certain that no amateur reconnaissance

operations directed at Cuba are undertaken, or (2) in one way or another to

guide such activities to maximize their usefulness.

4. On the basis of several debriefing sessions with Menning, Heidrickson

is inclined to believe that Hemming is both sincere and scrious in his dosi.:

to assist the US Government, provided that this can be accomplished throug!

tis continuing to act as a

"soldier of fortune". It is alvays possible, oi tie

other band, that he is still loyal to the Cuban Government and at some future

date will attempt to embarrass the US.

The information which Hemming furnished during his stay in Los lagcles

was disseminated in the following reports:
