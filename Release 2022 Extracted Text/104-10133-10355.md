SOssECT: Gerald P. Hemming, Jr. Moves to i to Engage in Anti-Casiro

Uperacivus

Gerald Patrick Hemming, Jr. (erroneously referred to in ©
P. Henning, Jr.) informed Hendrickson of the Los Angeles Fieli Oo
3 noving to Miami, Florida and would arrive there on Hond
ing stated that he was going:to contact Jimay Gentry, 952 $.W. Pe
8, Miami, Plorida (Telephone: FRankLlin 4-3255) and that these two
going to proceed with a plan of action aimed at orgainizing a
of ‘ professionals" (experienced revolutionaries) who would attempt to
in veconnaissance operations on the mainland of Cuba via paracinic
Zt either light plane or water pick-ups. Hemming also stated he wanted to
do what ha could in Miami to attempt to unite the anti-Castro forces thoxe :
also to lessen the influ2nce of a number of "mercenaries" who had j
of ‘these movements and were doing it more harm than good while ble
much of the available money.

2, The available background information on Hemmiag. was fural
LA-23939 (00-A(S)-3,170,536). Some additional information is incl
the ached Application for Conmission or Warrant Rank, US Navy or Ne
Reserve, filled out by Hemming during his tour with the US Narine Corps and
dated 23 Jun 58. Henming also claims to have been unofficially che»
wmerous aircraft while serving with the Cuban Air Force during
tal£ Of 1930 dacluding the L-20, F-47, AT-5, Cessna 170 and Pipar 7
Bh: do aet have a US com ial ox private pilose Lice
reportedly maintained an interest in parachuting during his rece!
Los Angeles (September 1960-HMarch 1961), and claimed to have jumped ar teas!
once a moath with one of the local parachute and skydiving clubs.

3. The above information is passed on because it appears likely that the
Agency may wish either (1) to make certain that no amateur reconnaissance
operations directed at Cuba are undertaken, or (2) in one way or another to
guide such activities to maximize their usefulness.

4. On the basis of several debriefing sessions with Nonuming, Hendri
is inclined to believe that Hemming is both sincere and serious in his de
to assist the US Government, provided that this can be accomplished throu!
his continuing to act as a “soldier of fortune", It is always possible, oc. tha
other baad, that he is still loyal to the Cuban Government aad at soma future
¢cate will attempt to embarrass the US.

5. The infoxmation which Hemming furnished during his stay in Los Aagcles
was disseminated in the following reports:

00-B-3,169,985 (Evaluated 5, 1 & 6, 3)
3,169,982 (  " 3, 1 & 6, 3)
