1. as you will recall, et the time of AMMUG/1's defection, Ol
he bed vith him $2,50G,(U.5.) hich #43 retsinec by the (SUADOVE's)
because their (foreigm)jotfice believed that this might have to be
-turned ‘beck to the PARUKEN government upon request. - Although :
the foregoing position hardly appeared consistent with (BHABOVE's )d|
surrender of documents and files which even more clearly were
the property of PBROMEN, you and LANGOSCH agreed that KUBARK's
interaste would be served pest by taking the documents and the
person and by not quibbling about the bolding of the money.

2. In the absence of any news to the contrary, it appeara
that PERUMEN has not clained the woney arc hes no intention of
doing so. Accordingly, it would eppear thet (SHAROVE may bo
williag to turn over the 2,500 now. ol

3. As motters stand, KUBARK bss tarned over $2,500 to AXKUG/L
but our tax unit considers that this must be treated as taxable
income. Hence, in order that AMHUG/1 may net $2,500, the payment
here aust be charged to 55,010. This will include the tax payment
{and the tax on tax) but the total tax of $510 will be held by
tie Finance Section until tine for filing. If you could recover
the $2,500 held by (514301 Ro tax problem will be encountered
and administrative headaches will be avoised at _ Pad of March.
