Hy sere Coleone! Johnson

: 1, Colone! Johnson gave a full account of his two meetinge with
Dr. MIRO in Miami on 5 and 6 Cetober, following in detail the Memo-
iq varida for the Hecord preparad by Colonel Johnson of these mectings.
He also outlined the items Faula bad givon Dean as the budget for 1961
isu en the basie of thoir receiving $100, 060 for that month. That outline,
it was remarked, appears to be largely the same as tho old F RD budget.
All present felt that this budget appeared to be well-padded and. largely
for salaries. 2. wi remarked by Colone)] Johnson that there seeried
! tobe a vory. good. possibility that some of those on the oalary Hat may
aint i also, be:receiving support from HEW, Colonel Johsson remarked that
- he would be seeing. Dr.“ MIRO on Monday, 16 Cctober, at which time
he expects to clarify some of the budget matters and also to got from ‘
CLA's Miami station some more details from bir. Paula, ;

2, Mr, Coerr raised the question of what was the cover to be
used by Colonel Johnson in his contacts with Dr, MIRO. Colonel Johnson
: . aid thatthe covor question had not yet been resolved, that it was :
i questionable how long any cover would bold up, particularly with the
H i press, that the cover of public relations consultant, the cover of a

it research man or-teacher In Miami, and various other possibilities were

: t under consideration. Mr, Coerr commented that the astute press rep-

: rosontatives might soon learn the identity of the CIA representative

: with MIRO, particularly if opposition leaders like PRIG, who, he re-

marked, already seems to know, should become angry and report in

the press what they know, Mr, Hurwitch stated that MIRC had told him

i that PRIO, or a representative of PRIC, had saidto MIRC, "lunder-

‘ stand that you have a Colonel Johnson as your representative with the
U. S. Government." MIRO aleo declared to Mr, Hurwitch that only

‘ he, MIRO, and his secretary, ARAGON, had.reason to know of

= Colonel Johnson's role. There was some speculation on how PRIO had

learned of the matter. +



3. Mr, Whedbee oaid that there was noed to, clarify just who
Colonel Jobnaon represented to Dr, MIRO, that AIRC had beon told
he would have a represontative who would havo {requent contact with
Mr, Goodwin in the White House and Mir. Vioodward and others at
the Department of State and would aleo be in contact with the Agency,
and that it waa accordingly the understanding of the Agency that
Colenel. Johnson would thorefore represont or be the link between
Dr. MIRO and the U. S, Government, at least in the Miami-area.

He romarked that this certainly had some bearing on the cover mattor
and its security aspects. Mr, Coerr remarked that it seemed
Colonel Johnson was simply an overt representative of the Agency.
Ms. Whedbee remarked that this was hardly poseible and otill havo
any. security or deniability, If he was overt, he was automatically

& representative of the U. S. Government. Mr. Hurwitch interposed

* that he considered Colonal Johnson to be solely the representative of

the Agency. He said-that Mr, Goodwin had aid that he, Goodwin,

only wanted to be consulted on tha most important fooues and that MIRO's
normal contact in Washington for policy guidance ahould be with the
Cuban doek in the Department of Stato. In Miami, Colone} Jobson
would thea work out with MIRO the Agency support of theac policies.

4. Mr, Hurwitch continued, expreeging his view that
Colone! Johnson ohould have the authority from the Agency to discuss
and approve Dr. MIRO's operational plane ouch ao tours to Latin
America, support of internal gr.ups ‘and the like and, if certain plano
wore approvod by them, to sit down with MIRO, the military advisors
and representatives of the internal groups, and work out final details
for actually running operations in support of these elements,
Mr. Whedbes countered, -"It is by no means a6 simple as that. This
{9 a lot more complicated than just having two or a dosen people sit
down in Miami and agree on something. Take, for instance, the .
simple matter, relatively speaking, of sending to Latin America a
person on a speaking tour. Did you know that the Immigration and
Naturalization Service and tho FBI require oll requests for support

‘from them to be sent back here to Washington and then their people.

in Miami have to be instructed by their Headquarters here in Washing-
ton to facilitate such travel, thus, in effect, the final control on travel
je up here in Washington and it doesn't oven reside in the Agency.
Each individual hag to be so handled.” Mr, Hurwitch said be thought
that thie could be worked out so that it could be done entirely locally
in Miami, Mr, Whedbee expressed some doubt and said that somehow

he had the improsoion that MIRO had Uttle-assets but thought that
Mf ho could acquire all the facilities of CIA as a sovernmont ontity
placed at his disposal, he-could do something. Of course these
facilities and the authority of CLA simply could not be turned over to

Dr, MIKO,

5.. Colonel Johnaon sald that he felt there was a ‘considerable
area in which we could support Dr. MIRC and he. referred to the
Stato Department's propaganda plan, “Cperacion Grieta, " which
Dr. MIRO said he bad received during his visit to Mr. Hurwitch and
Mr, Morales Carrion. Mr, Hurwitch explained that this waa in no
senso a Dopartment of State plan but rather a suggested draft by
Morales Carrion and :pagsod to MIRO ao merely an indication cf the
‘sort of propaganda operation in Latin America that might be effective.

6. On the subject of propaganda and the activities of the
“collateral groups" like the FORD, the DRE, atc, outside the CRC,
both Mr. Wollam and Mr, Hurwitch said they believed it wou!d be
possible to transfer these groups and their activities in their entirety ©
to Dr. MIRO in accordance with his desires. Mr. Whedbeo said
he sympathized with MIRC's position but doubted that it would work,
ddr, Hurwitch sald that if we had some doubts on thie matter, he won-
dered.-why theas doubts had not been brought up by Mr. Bissell in the.”
discussions with Mr. Goodwin. Mr, Hurwitch then claimed he hada
Goodwin memo saying tho DRE, FORD, and all internal groups must
be financed through MIRG, - Mr, ‘Hurwitch woaderad when thie new
Position had developed in the Agency. Mr, ¥hedbee stated that tho
Agency had bad long experience during the past tio years in dealing
with the various Cuban elements both in and outside Cuba, and that
thead types of probleme had existed {rom the beginning and although
they may seem new to Mr. Hurwitch and Mr. Wollam, who had recent-
ly come on the desk, they certainly were not new to Mr. Coerr, who
readily agreed. Mr, Whedbee pointed out that, in the early stages of
1960, attempts were made to form some sort of coalition of the
miscellaneous Cuban groups. Finally the FRD was born and much.
later the CRC, responsibility for which was thén transferred to tho
White House and the State Department alter the invasion. In the first
oF early stages mentioned, relatively little had come of our attempts
to genorate meaningfw activities through Cuban-controlled channels
euch og tho FD, that the Agency, to achieve any real degree of success
{n developing propaganda and cther activities against Castro, had to
form miscellaneous groups, political and collateral, and then try to

shove them one way or the other under the umbrella of the FRD,
He pointed out that the most telling criticloin made by the prees and
by members of the State Department, too, at that time was that
we were forcing those vatious groups through monetary contro! into
Joining the FRD, He otated further that this had been discussed in _
Baltimoro. last month in détall with Dr, MIRO, who at that timo
geoined to agree that if-D¥, MIRO and the CRC were to succeed In
controlling tho other groupa, both collateral and political, it ideally

ould be by leadership rather than by exercising financial control.

7. Mr. Whedbeo then brought up the question of Just how far
should we go in support of MIRO and the Council, and how are wo going
to Justify some of these expenses. Concidorable discussion followed,
at the conclusion of which Mr. Whedbee said he would like to throw out
onthe table eome.specific pointe simply as an indication of some of
the problem areas which he felt had deon at least touched upon by tho
diceussioa and to which in tha coming weeks come consideration would’
have'to be given, although cortalaly this meeting should act try to
arrive at any definitive answers:

a. I ehould be clarified whether or not, in fact, some of
those persona listed as receiving salarioa from the FRD are a! 0 res
€eiving economic aid from tho HEW,

b. It should bo noted that Dr, MIRO's requeet’to engage in
activitics are oomotimes very unrealistic, For example, at one point
Dr. MIRO wanted to take, over the Swan Island operation and wanted
to put up a $2, 000, 000 radio station at Key West to beam propaganda
to Cuba and’dleo to Jam Cuban broadcantes,

¢, The proposal to have round table discussions including
. MIRO, his military. commission, and representatives of the internal
sell “te decide on sabotage and commando-type raids is rather ua-
realistic for a variety of reasons, including security factors and the
question of whethor or not thie would be acceptable to any or all of

the internal groups,

Hl “4. Dr, MIRC has apparently the fdoa that ho can use his
million dollars for whatever he desires with little or no advance ap-
proval, and above this figure he may ask for unlimited funde for
operations. This area certainly needs clearing up.

o. Di. MIRC, hao requested that the /.gency turn over to
him the funds, the control of the bank accounts, and the entire
mechaniom for making the “dopendent paymento." This {a a rather
hey item related to past history. Mr, Whedbeo otatod it wae bio
personal opinion that thie should not under any circumstances be .
turned over to the CRC to administer independently. i

{.° Relative to MIRO's request for aid to tho Escambray ;
resiotance group, Mr. Whedbee tated that be had discussed this *
matter very thoroughly with Dr, MIRO, and it appeared from that |
convoreation that MIKO had had only one indirect contact with this |
group. Dr. MIRO had merely a piece of paper signed by RAMIREZ:
and several others allogedly in the Escambray, stating that there {
were some 30 of thom in deaperate strate and in need of oupport and
that, {{ weapons were givén to them, thoy could muster 100, :
Dr, MIRO waa at that point not even sure how the paper had got to {
him and had.no'means whatsoover of communicating with RAMIREZ, |
He proposed the uae of a boat'to get the supplies to the North coast -
of Cubs, but had no idea how to get thom from the North coast to the
Zecambzay, Aa an alternative, ho guggested an alr drop by 8 plano

from Florida.

F g: With regard to.the financial aid that MIRO had epohea
to both Mr. Hurwitch and Colonel Jonson about, f.e., the $70, 000

monthly to bo sent into Cuba via the| |Mr, Whedbee
pointed out that ¢ when contacted by an Agency

roprasentativo, that he, for tho time being, did not want bis

Erabasoy utillued further in this type of transaction, that of the $70, 000

givon MIRO, apparently only $40, 000 was sent into
and, of this, a large portion went for the needs of parsons in asylum
in the Embassy rather than for-aupport of Cuban intornsl resistance
elements outeide the Embassy. In at leant one instance, the Agency,
through separate channels, had, in fact, arranged to send funds to
the principal intornal group. which wi pposed to have received--
but didn't--a portion of the $49,000, Certdinly wo could not give
further support to thie activity without a good deal of clarification of
exactly how future (unde were to be gent in by Dr. MIRO.

8. Mr. Hurwitch then said that, with regard to Dr. MIRO's pro-
posal for the Council to establish itself on Cuban soil via a commando
operation and then got U, S. military support, this had been brought up

repeatedly with Mr. Goodwia, and Dr. MIRO had been told flatly not
to count on a U.S, military operation against Cuba. Mr, Hurwitch ”
said that MIRC now seems to be making the same proposal again
through Colonel Johnson, and that he should be discouraged from
making any plans for such an operation,

9. Mr. Hurwitch said that he believed something could be done
for the three Cuban residents of the U. S. who had fought at Playa
Giron, but who now couldn't get ald through the Hefugee Council or
Social Security. Ho offered to take care of any such matters with HEW,
Accordingly, the names and data were left with Mr. Wollam for
Mr, Hurwitch’s uee. Mr, Hurwitch added that Mr, Wise at the
Refugee Conter in Miam{ might be a goed contact if CLA wanted to
handlo these matters iteelf in Miami,
