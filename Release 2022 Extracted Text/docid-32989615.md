MEMORANDUM FOR MR. SULLIVAN

I have given very careful consideration to your memoranda of

June 7, 1971, and June 16, 1911, together with the memorandum of

to the President

September 22, 1970; Mr. Brennan's memorandum of September 21, 1970,

initialled by you; and also Mr. Child's memorandum of May 23,

oflices and the problems incident thereto, together with the recommendations

of Messrs. Dalbey, Felt, and Beaver upon the recommendation made in your

memorandum of June 7, 1971, suggesting the closing down of a number of

the foreign liaison offices, some of them recently established last December

with your approval.

First and foremost, I want to clarify a point you have raised in

of Mexico City, are not operational and that we cannot develop "hard, high

quality, positive intelligence by sending men to these countries only in a

liaison

capacity." We do not have the legal right to establish any foreign

offices on an operational basis.

The law specifically limits foreign intelli-

gence operations to coverage by the Cla, and, therefore, we have known

all along that our offices in foreign countries could not be in an operational

status.

I cannot agree that establishing liaison offices in foreign coun-

tries without being operational prevents us from developing hard, high quality;

and positive intelligence. Certainly in all memoranda prior to your memo-

randum of June 7, 1971, you did not indicate any such reservation and, in

fact, you specifically initialled the memorandum of Mr. Brennan addressed

At that time I believed that by

reason of your approval ot the various monoranda dealing with the foreign

had followed and, in lack, approved the establishment of additional Lalson

and which 1 Indicated was precitected upon Mr, Erranan's memorandum of

September 21, 1970.

I want to also point out that at no timo, either in September or

more recently, did l ever sussest to the Prosident the iden that we should

expansi our foreiga linison operatione. It was the President's Idea expressed

to me la keptember, 1970, that such expansion should take place, and, an

a result thereol, I submitted my letter to him of beptember 81, 1970.

that Di. Elasinger inquired of me so to what had happened to the expansion

of our foreian liaison which the Freaident had approved being expanded in

Cepternbex, 1970. Whon Itold Dr. Klasinger that thia matter bad been

delayed in the State Department and that I had been awaiting word tox approval

of the came by the Searetary of State, Dr. Kissinger stated he would personally

take this matter up with the Presidont and that I would recoive in a lew days

of the Russian Government and the United States Government concerning

the limântion of arms. As 1 have previously indicateá in my mamorastium

.. SUBJECT: • EXPANSION OF FOREIGN\LIAISON.

On 10/12/71 I met, at their request, with lAmbassador

Wymberley Coerr, Deputy Director of the Bureau of Intelligence

and Research, Department of State, and R. Glynn Mays, also

of the Department of State but assigned to the National Security

Council, Under Secretaries Committee. Also present was SA

but 15t5.

Graham A. Day of this Division.

The State representatives advised that the Director's

letter of 9/20/71 to Secretary Rogers requesting clearance for

six new liaison posts abroad had been referred to the Committee

for clearance. As part of their normal procedure, the views of

the affected Ambassadors were solicited with the result that a

number of questions were raised.

State is currently in the process

of effecting a five per cent reduction in U.S. personnel overseas

and each Ambassador was concerned with the proposed increase in

the personnel complement with which he is charged. Several

Ambassadors asked what information might be given

to the host

government and others inquired as to why their post had been

selected.

Both Coerr and Mays appeared to be genuinely cooperative

and indicated that they merely wanted our assistance:in- preparing

brief material which might be forwarded to the Ambassadors' as'

a general response to their inquiries.

They were pleased to

learn that a number of the new posts will be, in effect, acting

•as regional offices, covering more than one country. No question

was raised, and of course no comment was made, concerning the

• dévelopment of high-level intelligence and it

was explained that,

as in the case with our other posts, our representatives will be

establishing and maintaining liaison with the police and other

investigative agencies of the countries visited in order to

expedite and insure the thorough handling of leads abroad arising

from the Bureau's domestic investigations.

It was explained that three of the new posts (Manila,

Rio de Janeiro and Santo Domingo) represent a reopening of

offices formerly: in existence and that only one post (New

"Delhy)

will be in a country not previously covered.

Both Coerr and Mays indicated that there was

some

pressure to resolve the problem and prepare a response to

the Director's inquiry.

They did not, however, indicate:

how much time this might involve.

• In response to their inquiry we have prepared a

letter, addressed to the Under Secretary of State at their.

request, noting the general objectives of our foreign liaison

posts and explaining in general terms why each of the six

new locations was chosen.

We have also indicated the territory

Dear Mi. Irvin:

Ambassador Hymberley Coerr and Mr. R. Glynn Mays:

of your Department have asked for additional details with

reference to my letter of September 20, 1971, to Secretary

Rogers.

Specific questions were raised concerning the

location of the proposed new posts and concerning our

method of operation when they are established.

In general, our need for additional liaison

abroad stems from the constantly increasing travel abroad

of United States citizens under investigation in this

country.

activities abroad, I suggested the reopening of these three

posts.

Although relatively close to Hong Kong,

from which the area has since been covered,

the volume of our work in the Philippines is

such that it can best be handled by a man

The continued United States

military presence in the Philippines, coupled

relatively large work load in this area.

we have not previously had regular coverage,

Dominican Republic, thereby creating

problens of IBI interest in connection with

the Neutrality Act, the Foreign Agents

Registration Act and other matters alfecting

internal security interests.

To a smaller

extent,

this is also true of Haiti.

Although my request for this limited expansion

was made at the specific instruction of the President, I

know that he would not sanction an operation which was not

economically worthwhile.

You way be assued that, as in

the past, these new posts will be carefully supervised and

prompt action taken should it be determined either that

their continued existence is not warranted or that additional

assistance is necessary.

I hope that it will be possible

R. Glynn Mays of the Department of State who has

been handling, on a working level, our request to expand our

foreign liaison telephoned 11/4/71.

He stated that the

affected Ambassadors had been canvassed again for their

concurrence and each had raised a number of additional questions.

He explained that basically, the Ambassadors were chafing

at a request for expansion at a time when the Governnent is

in the throes of additional contraction in its overseas posts,

and he indicated that a number of the Ambassadors had pointed

out that there are existing arrangements under which FBI

leads can be handled in their territory and they do not under-

stand, based on the small volume of work they have witnessed

in the past, why FBI wishes to station a man in the territory

full time.

With reference to our request to open in Kuala

Lumpur, Malaysia, he said he would like us to authorize him

He stated

the Bureau with Mays 10/12/71 to discuss our request, had

He was told that we felt

no useful purpose

would be served by further discussion of

operational details but that if the Department of State

had questions it desired answered, it should address them

to us in writing and we would deal with them in an appropriate

manner.

We made

no comment concerning the proposal to

exchange Singapore for Kuala Lumpur (actually, the two points

are very close and we see no objection to the change).

Mays said he understood our position and would

relay it promptly to his superiors.

He indicated that the

United Nations Chinese problem and

the Congressional action

concerning

foreign aid had occupied the full time of the

top personnel at State with the result that they are not

familiar with the latest developments surrounding our

request. It is quite apparent that unless we call a halt

as we have done in our discussion with Mays today, we could

continue conferences and discussions endlessly without

achieving our objective.

With reference to the implied

questioning of the volume of FBI work in the new areas, it

should be noted that our selection of the locations for the

new posts was based not on work load but on potential for

production of high level intelligence of interest to the

White House.

This has not, of course, been included in

either our letters to state or our discussion with it.

SUBJECT: EXPANSION OF (FOREIGN LIAISON

As instructed, I met on 11/24/71 with State Under

Secretary John N. Irwin II; Deputy Under Secretary William

B. Macomber, Jr.; his Executive Assistant, Samuel R. Gammon;

Wymberley Coerr,

Deputy Director, Bureau of Intelligence and

Research; and R. Glynn Mays of State's Methods and Systems

Staff.

I was accompanied by SA Graham A. Day of this Division:

Mr. Irwin, who was unable to stay for the entire meeting,

stated he was most appreciative of the Director's rapid

and

cooperative response to his request for further discussion.

He pointed out that he has a tremendous respect for the Director

and for the organization which he has built and has instructed

his personnel at State to do everything in their power to

fulfill the

FBI request.

He noted that the request did, however,

represent a substantial

problem for State and that he had

asked for discussion because of the difficulties which State

had encountered.

State is fully aware of President Nixon's instruction

that FBI liaison activities be expanded.

The President has

also,

however, instructed that the official profile of the

United States

be lowered abroad and that a five percent

across-the-board reduction in United States

overseas personnel

be made.

Coming as it does on the heels of President Johnson's

fifteen percent reduction and President Nixon's earlier ten

percent reduction, this has created serious staffing problems

in each U.S. Embassy.

As the Ambassador's concurrence is

necessary before any new personnel can be sent abroad, each

•- of those potentially affected by our expansion was consulted

by state and each one raised serious objections. Some, as

will be indicated below, questioned the necessity for an Agent

to be stationed in their countries and several, pointing

to

the current expansion of the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous

Drugs, which is also being strongly resisted, asked why one

Justice representative could not represent both agencies.

As a result, both Mr. Irwin and Mr. Macomber asked that we

take a hard

look at

our proposals to see if some adjustments

could be made which would result in a smalder overall increase

in our overseas-personnel..

I pointed out that there would be no possibility

of our "doubling up" with Narcotics investigators, explaining

that our functions and methods of operation are totally

different and would actually be incompatible in some areas.

noted that our modest request had actually been scaled

down before it was forwarded to State and that we had limited

each office to a single Agent with only one Clerk-Stenographer.

I referred to the detailed explanation for our request which

had been furnished in our letter of 10/14/71 to Mr. Irwin

and stated that we would not have made the request if we

had not felt it fully justified and responsive to the

President's instruction. I said that we would, however,

see if there was any way in which the total number of personnel

involved might be reduced.

It was agreed that following this

review, we would meet again for further discussion during

the week of November 29, 1971. Comments and recommendations

concerning

the specific

follow:

Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

The Agency for International Development Mission

here has been withdrawn in the face of local criticism of

U.S. efforts to influence the Brazilian Police.

We have

been covering this enormous country from our office in

Argentina on a 2,500 mile round trip basis. No criticism

has been made of our liaison contacts with

the Brazilian

Police or other agencies, and we feel we should insist on

reopening our office here. By reducing our staff in

Buenos Aires by one

e Agent

and one clerk which we intended

intended

to do anyway), reopening this office will result in no

increase in personnel.

Act 5(91121 (9112)(D)

Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia

There is an abnormally large percentage of

and the addition of another investigative agency

is

feared by the Ambassador as objectionable to the Malaysian

Government which is endeavoring to maintain a neutral position.

State asks that we let them explore the possibility of opening

in Singapore

instead of. Kuala Lumpur.. Singapore is extremely

close and is actually a better location from the standpoint

of travelers both east and west as Singapore is a normal

international aviation stop. We believe Singapore would be

just

as good a location

as

Kuala Lumpur and recommend that

State be asked to make

"the necessary arrangements without

further delay.

Memorandum E. S. Miller to Mr. Rosen

Re: EXPANSION OF FOREIGN LIAISON

Manila, Philippines

Although the Ambassador here has voiced objection,

we feel that we should insist upon reopening this office:

There are a number of National Academy graduates in the

Philippines, and we have a ready reservoir of good will

which we can tap both 'in our regular work and in öur search

for political intelligence.

-

Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic

The Ambassador here was most specific in pointing

out that the present coverage from our office in nearby

San Juan seemed to be fully adequate.

He added that the

precarious political situation could

be worsened by the

addition of U. S. law enforcement personnel. We believe

we could forgo reopening santo. Domingo w.

with no loss.

"The

Agent in San Juan now covering

the area (and who wais

scheduled to reopen the office, can be fully briefed con=

cerning the collection of political intelligence and, by

stepping up the trequency of his visits, can not only cover

the Dominican Republic but also establish liaison in Haiti

and jamaica.

New Delhi, India

It was pointed out that, whereas we had planned

to cover last and west Pakistan from this point, the current

hostilities would make this unfeasible. India itself, however,

is a huge country with an enormous

population and is of great

potential political significance.

For the present, we could

establish liaison from here with Iran and could await the

• resumption of better relations between India and Pakistan

before visiting the latter.

We feel we should insist upon

opening this office.

Re:

EXPANSION OF FOREIGN LIAISON

Canberra, Australia

at this time as, of the

ouTa pröbably be the least productive of political intelli-

gence since it has a stable government and enjoys friendly

relations with the U.S. From a cost standpoint, this would

probably be the most expensive post to open merely because

of the great distance and high transportation costs.

ACTION:

It is recommended that we inform State we have

very carefully reconsidered our request and, in an effort

to be fully cooperative, we have altered our request with

the result that only six additional positions abroad will be

fueeded ather than the tweive originally requested. We will

ask to open at Rio de Janeiro, Manila, New Delhi and Singapore,

making other arrangements for

the coverage we had requested

from Santo Domingo and Canberra.

We will press for an

early meeting for the consideration of this proposal and

ask that we be permitted to proceed at the earliest possible

moment as there has already been so much delay.

SUBJECT:: EXPANSION OF (FÓREIGN LIAISON

• ?.:

As indicated in memorandum 11/29/71, we had an

appointment to discuss our expansion further with Deputy

Under Secretary of State Macomber at 3:30 p.m., 11/30/71.

At noon on 11/30/71, Mr. Macomber's office advised that he

had been unexpectedly summoned by the Secretary of State

to a meeting which would occupy the balance of the afternoon,

and we were asked to postpone our discussion until 12/2/71.

I stated that I was quite anxious to resolve this matter

without further delay and asked to meet with other State

representatives to discuss our proposal as originally planned.

Accordingly, we met with Ambassador Wymberley Coerr, Deputy

Director. of State's Bureau of Intelligence and Research;

Samuel R. Gammon, Executive Assistant to Mix. Macomber;

and

R. Glynn Mays of State's Methods and Systems Staff. I was

accompanied

by SA Graham Day of this Division.

• I stated that the staffing problems encountered

by State had been explained to the Director and that, in

an effort to cooperate, he had authorized us to materially

reduce our initial request. I said that we would agree to

Singapore in place of Kuala Lumpur as suggested by State,

and we would cancel our request to open offices in Canberra

and Santo Domingo.

I pointed out that we would staff our

office in Rio de Janeiro by reducing our present staff in

Buenos Aires and that we were therefore requesting, in effect,

only six additional positions abroad (3 Agents, 3 clerks) in

place of the original 12, from which we would open offices,

lianila clio de janeiro, New Delht andeither Singapore

or Kuala Lumpur.

Imbassador Coerr said that he greatly appreciates

the Director's cooperation and asked that his thanks bej (/

conveyed to the Director for this.--He instructed Mr. Mays

to immediately wire the Ambassador in Singapore to explore

the possibility of our opening there in place of Kuala Lumpur.

He then stated that our choice of Manila was especially

troublesome because, at Presidential direction, a special

reduction in U. S. personnel had been made there over and

posts.

He said that the situation in Manila was so critical

that he would ask that we discuss it further with the Director

to see whether we might open in Canberra, Australla,. In Place

• of Manila, possibly covering: the Philippines Irom canberra.

In addition, Mr. Mays said that the Ambassador in New Delhi.

had expressed .doubt.whether-there.was.sufficient FBI.WOrk.IN;

India to justify stationing a man there.

Mays asked for

figures which State could use to support our request.

I stated that we were faced with a situation in

which the President had, on September 20, 1971, asked the

• Director to expand his liaison operations abroad and that

here we were more than two months later without having taken

a single action in direct response to the President's instruction.

I pointed out that it seemed to me that the President's instruction

should take precedence over any Ambassadorial question and

that I saw no point in becoming involved in quibbling with

individual Ambassadors in efforts to justify doing what the

President had asked. Ambassador Coerr said that he understood

our position perfectly and State would proceed to correspond

with the Ambassadors further. He did ask that we present

the special problem of Manila for determination by the Director.

With respect to Manila, we have a fair volume of

work there now which we do not have in Australia. Further,

we do not feel it would be feasible to cover Manila from

Australia because of the distance involved, and we want to

leave our office in Hong Kong free to concentrate on the

greatly enlarged Chinese problem. We feel, thererore, that

despite the Ambassador's objection, we should insist upon

reopening our office in Manila.

ACTION: If approved, we will inform Ambassador Coerr that

his proposal that Canberra be substituted for Manila has been

reviewed by the Director and that he feels, as he did when

he approved the reduced proposal, that it is essential for

us to reopen our office in Manila. We will also tell

Ambassador Coerr again that too much time has already elapsed

and that this matter should be resolved promptly.

EXPANSION OF FOREIGN LTAISON

We are recommending that opening of our mew office

at New Delhi, India, be temporarily postponed in view of the

present situation.

War was declared on India by Pakistan the same day..

that clearance was received from State for our office there.

We have been watching the situation closely and it has

deteriorated to the point where we believe it would be futile.

for us to station a man there right now. All commercial

airplane flights to New Delhi have been cancelled by the

....

Indian Government and State has advised us that they are

considering the possibility of evacuation of American

nationals as is currently being done in Pakistan.

Our

Legats are dependent upon developing friendly relations with

the investigative agencies of the host country. Recent

statomonts by president Nixon, Sacretary Rogers and

Ambassador Bush have

tended to

• blame India for escalation •

of the situation with

the result that considerable hostility

has been developed in

India against the United States.

A

very recent demonstration around the United States Embassy

in New Delhi is evidence of this.

This is just not the

time for a new Legat to introduce himself as a United States

representative to Indian agencies.

We checked with State on this and Glynn Mays, with

whom we have dealt in connection with the expansion, said

the situation is such that the Indian Government nigiri even

"decline to issue a visa to our representative although he

cannot say for sure. As our purpose in sending'@ tanlbol971

India is to have him secure political intelligence items

from his contacts, it would seem that

he would be unable to

do this until the

situation eases and a less hostile attitude

prevails.

ACTION:

It is recommended that we hold up on sending our

personnel to New Delhi for a period of 30 days, on the

expiration of which the situation will be reassessed and a

further recommendation made for

• the Director's consideration.

satisfaction that, since our conversation of a few

increasing the FBI's liaison activities in certain

keep a tight control on all overseas personnel,_a

and

to our ambassadors overseas to monitor and direct the

operations of alt elements assigned to thett missions.

We have recently instructed our Ambassadors in

Brasilia, Manila, and Singapore to consult with their:

respective host governments on this subject, and we

expect to hear from them shortly. Once we receive

formal clearance from those host governments and have

resolved the remaining technical and administrative

At 3:21 p.m. on July 1, 1975, he furnished me a copy of the

on Recommendations of the Commission on CIA Activities Within the

following our review, we discussed our suggestions with Mr. Callahan

and Mr. Jenkins and

then telephonically advised Mr. Marvin of the

proposed changes. Mr. Marvin adopted all of the proposed changes

except our suggestion that the paragraph regarding Recommendation 30

should include a comment that any agreement between. the CIA and the FBI

should not be undertaken until we have more information concerning possible

/ legislation which may be enacted following the conclusion of the inquiries

being made by the Senate Select Committee.

On July 2, 1975, I received from Mr. Marvin a copy of the final

draft which was transmitted to the White House and discussed with him the

absence of any change in the paragraph regarding Recommendation 30.

Mr. Marvin explained that while they concurred in our reservations about

attempting to draft an agreement without considering the possibility of new

legislation, they felt that the cover leiter to the President indicated

sufficiently that the comments were preliminary observations and that

considerable additional work would be necessary.

comments on the recommendations of the Commission on

CIA activities within the United States (The Ro kefeller

Commission).

Many of the recommendations bear directly

on the operations of this Department, since a change in

the charter of the Central Intelligence Agency will often

carry

with it implications with respect to the responsi-

bilities of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

I am enclosing a memorandum which consists of

preliminary observations on the recommendations. The

•basic purpose of the memorandum is to point out those:

recommendations which may require some modification

before they are implemented.

:

The observations are preliminary in nature because

the development of guidelines in this

area requires a

• considerable amount of work and a great deal of consulta-

tion with other agencies of the government as well as

with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

We have already

begun this process and are moving as quickly as possible.

I will, of course, keep you informed on the progress

of the Department in developing guidelines with respect

to the relationship of the Department, including the FBI "

to

the CIA.

Sincerely,

Edward H. Levi

Attorney General

MEMORANDUM

COMMENTS ON RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE COMMISSION ON CIA

ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE UNITED STATES

The comments of the Department of Justice on

the recommendations of the Commission

are as follows:

Recommendation 2, suggests an Executive Order

spelling out the CIA's jurisdiction for collecting in-

formation about the domestic activities of U.S.

citizens. The functions of the FBI in domestic intelli-

gence investigations and counterintelligence investiga-

tions within the United States ought to be kept quite

separate from the functions of the CIA. The problem is

more than "proper coordination with the FBI"

as the

recommendation seems to suggest.

Domestic counterin-

telligence is within the responsibility of the FBI.

As

to that part of the recommendation urging the destruction

of information, it should be noted that some of this in-

formation may have found its

way into IBl files where it

may or may not be legitimately retained.

Further, the

recommendation suggests that information inconsistent

with the Executive Order be destroyed at the conclusion

of pending congressional investigations or as soon there-

after as permitted by law.

In this respect, it should be

made clear that no files should be destroyed before the

Department of Justice closes its case as to possible

criminal violations by CIA officials or employees.

Recommendation 3, that Congress establish a

Joint Committee on Intelligence, raises the question whether

this committee would be yet another oversight committee

conflicts and confusion inevitably arise.

Recommendation 6 concerns theestablishment of

guidelines governing CIA's relationship with the Department

of Justice with respect to allegations of criminal conduct

by CIA or its employees.. It is no longer Department policy,

if it ever was, to defer prosecutorial decisions to CIA,

or cases concerning CIA autivities.

This Commission recom-

mendation is a gond one, and the guidelines must make clear

that the Department will prosecute. criminal conduct by CIA

or its employees wich the same vigor it would prosecute

any other criminal corduct.

- 2 .

Recimmendation 9(g) suggests that the CIA's

Inspector General Reports - some of which may involve

allegations of criminal activity -- should be provided

the National Security Council and the Executive Oversight

body. for the CIA whose establishment is recommended else-

where in the report.

Such a reporting requirement is un-

objectionable, but it should not be read as putting the

decision whether to bring allegations of criminal conduct

to the attention of the Department of Justice in the

hands of persons outside CIA.. Any possible criminal

violations by CIA of its employees should be reported

directly and immediately to the Department of Justice by

the CIA Inspector General:

Recommendation 12 calls for guidelines on CIA

employees

conduct.

These guidelines are important and

will not, we suspect, be easy to draft.

The recommendation

also suggests that the Director of Central Intelligence

should approve all actions rising questions of CIA author~

. If any proposed activity raises the possibility of

criminal violation, the Attorney General should also be

consulted.

Recommendation 13 suggests that the CIA should

be prohibited from engaging in domestic mail openings,

but it leaves open the question, whether the CIA ought to

participate in the opening of theimail of U.S. citizens

abroad. Further, part (b) of the recommendation implies

that the CIA may conduct mail cover examinations in the

United States.

This raises the question whether the CIA

rather than the FBI should be conducting any domestic

activities of this sort.

..-.

Recommendation 14 raises serious problems.

For

one thing, It suggests the development of an evaluation

unit wathin the Department of Justice or the FBI to coordin-

ate intelligence and counterintelligence information. This

could be viewed as an invitation to create a new internal

security organization for the purpose of keeping track of

dissident domestic political groups.

On the other hand,

failure to create such an organization could be seen as

perpetuating some of the difficulties suggested in the

report. The Department

of Justice is studying this recom-

NW 65360 Docld:32989615 Page 56

---

## Page 57

- 3-

mendation to determine the proper solution to this problem.

Recommendation 15 suggests that the President refrain.

from directing the CIA to perform what are essentially

Internal security tasks. Because of the need for a rather

strict separation of the functions of the CIA and the FBI,

the difficult question of defining an internal security

matter probably ought to be undertaken.

The recommendation.

also calls for destruction of certain files of the CHAOS

project. No files of the CHAOS project should be destroyed

before the Department of Justice closes its dase as to possible

criminal violatiors by CIA officials or employees in connection

with the CHAOS files:

Recommendation 16 calls for a written determination

by the Director of Central Intelligence that CIA infiltration

of domestic groups is necessary "to meet a clear danger to

agency facilities, operations, or personnel, and that ade-

quate coverage by law enforcement agencies

is unavailable."

On the basis of the Commission report, it is not clear under

fort circumstances it would ever be necessary and proper

the CIA to infiltrate domestic groups.

Perhaps a briefing

of officials in the Department would lead to a better under-

standing of the implications of

this policy. In any case,

there should be explicit guidelines defining the Director's

authority to order such infiltration.

Recommendation 17 calls for, the destruction of some

CIA files, upon the conclusion of the current congressional

.. investigations or as soon thereafter as possible. As indi-

cated earlier, no files should be destroyed until the Justice

Department's investigation is completed.

Recommendation 18 states that the CIA may investigate

individuals affiliated with it, but that such investigations

"must be coordinated with the FBI" when there is evidence

of espionage of violation of law involved. If the CIA is to

avoid getting into law enforcement investigations,. perhaps it

should

simply turn all criminal investigations over to the

Bureau rather than "coordinate" with the FBI or any other

enforcement agency. This problem of separating law enforcement

from foreign intelligence is a rifficult problem.

The De-

partment of Justice has the problem under study and will try

to make a more definite statement about it later.

Recommendation 19 would compel the FBI to accept

cases involving allegations of security violations "without

NW 65360 Docld:32989615 Page 57

---

## Page 58

- 4 -

regard

• to whether a favorable prosecutive opinion is issued

by the Justice Department.

". This could raise serious

difficulties.

For example, it would have the effect of

putting the FBI in the uncomfortable position of investigating

a matter without reasonable expectation of prosecution.

Recommendation 19(a) could be read

as requiring the Director

of Central Intelligence to refer all serious or continuing

security violations to the Security Committee of USIB for

its determination whether the case should be referred to the

-Department.

The Director should be able to refer these cases

directly without resort to an intermediary.

Recommendation 21 supports legislation making it a

criminal oftense for CIA employees to leak classified infor-

mation.

In general, the recommendation raises controversial

-issues

similar to those raised in connection with some of

•the provisions in S.1.

• Swith the Central Intelligence Agency in drafting any necessary

It 1 gene

The Department,.of.course; will work

- legislation.

i "..

=..=

Recommendation 22 suggests that the Director of Central

• Intelligence should approve in writing certain physical sur-

¡ veillance operations, but again it does not provide the

Director with any clear guidelines as to when and under what

circumstances approval should be given. It is not clear to

what extent, if at all, the CIA should undertake physical sur-

veillance operations within the United States. Moreover, there

Cis the issue of the role of the FBIsin matters such as these.

The issue is under study by the Department.

Recommendation 23 is ambiguous in that it could be read

as meaning that all interceptions of wire or oral communica-

• tions within the United States would require a warrant. Read

another way, the recommendation could be understood to meani

that the CIA could' conduct warrantless activities in foreign

intelligence matters either within the U.S. or abroad. It has

been the Administration's position that certain national security

surveillances do not require a warrant. Also, the recommenda-.

tion fails to discuss procedures already agreed to by the Direc-

tor of the Central Intelligence Agency regarding the interception

by the CIA of wire or oral communications of Ameriçan citizens

abroad.

Recommendation 28 suggests that equipment for monitor-

ing conversations should not be tested on unsuspecting persons

NW 65360 Docld:32989615 Page 58

---

## Page 59

- 5 -

living within the United States. Perhaps this recommendation

should also apply to unsuspecting American citizens living abroad

as well.

Recommendation 30 suggests that the Director of Central

Intelligence and the Director of the FBI should draft a de-

tailed agreement setting forth each agency's jurisdiction and

devising procedures for effective liaison between them.

While

it is important that there be cooperation between the CIA and

the FBI, this issue ought not be left solely to an agreement

between

the two agencies.

At the least, if there is to be an

ügreement, representatives of the Attorney General or his De-

partmental designee ought to be involved in its negotiation

and preparation.

NOTE:

GRET

See I. J. Smith memorandum to E. S. Miller 6/8/73,

captioned "SPECOV.'

The particulars revealed above regarding coverage of

Kraft while in France during 1969 have been the subject'of

detailed testimony by Mr. Kraft 5/10/74 before the United States

Senate Subcommittee on Adminstrative Practices and Procedures,

the Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights of the Committee on

the

Judiciary, and the Subcommittee on Surveillance of the Committee

on Foreign Relations.

His testimony appears in the printed records

of the above Committees' proceedings and an earlier public dis-

closure of the surveillance concerning Joseph Kraft appeared in the

9/20/73 issue of the New York Times.

Mr. Kraft had apparently

learned the particulars of the surveillance through adminstration

leaks. We have deleted the identity of the country involved in

the elsur in an attempt to fulfill the confidential nature of our

relationship with the French security service, the DST, and to

avoid

further embarrassment to them

The French actually conducted

the microphone surveillance in question and have previously formally

protested to us concerning media reports and other public dis-

closure which revealed their involvement in the surveillance.

Request Pertaining to Electronic Surveillance

NOTE CONTINUED:

We have alluded in the memorandum to the SSC to certain memor-

many details of the electronic surveillance. Our flat denial

of any memoranda regarding authorization or re-authorization with-

out reference to the Sullivan memoranda would raise more questions

than it answers and flies in the face of the Committee's knowledge

into this matter attached to this note are two memoranda from W. C.

Sullivan to Mr. Hoover which are of the type referred to by us

in the memorandum to the Committee.

As a fallback position,

should the Cormittee rephrase its request and seek to obtain the

assorted memoranda from W. C. Sullivan to Mr. Hoover referred to

above, it is felt we could comply with such request after appro-

priate sanitization of the exchange of correspondence between

w. C. Sullivan and Mr. Hoover.

The sanitization would be under-

taken in order to preserve our interests, particularly protection

of the French DST, and to protect the privacy of the only three

individuals who reportedly had knowledge of the electronic sur-

veillance within the Bureau, W. C. Sullivan, former Paris Legat,

Norman Philcox, and the late J. Edgar Hoover.

This note has been

classified

"Secret" in order to protect the confidentiality of our

relationship with the French security service the disclosure of

which could reasonably be expected to result in serious damage to

national security. Classified by 6283, XGDS 1, Indefinite.

ALL FEI INFORNLATION CONTINED

HULLA AS UGLAIN

DANT 10/3100085p24Men

Pursuant to our discussions concerning the disposition of

certain records relating to the surveillance activities

directed at your client, Mr. Joseph Kraft, the Department

is making the following temporary arrangements:

l. Pending further Departmental action relating

to the policies which will

govern records of the

¿ype invulved in lu. Traft's Case, all documents,

recordings, or other recoras of any cype tu lhe

Department'

scustody or control which constitute,

summarize, or describe the contents of the over-

hearings obtained

as the result of any electronic

surveillance directed against Mr. Kraft and mem-

bers of his family will be placed under seal..

As long as the items described above remain

under seal, no official or employee of the Depart-

ment will have access to them for any purpose, and

no official or employee of the Department will

allow any person outside of the Department to have

any such access, cxcept as described below. The

only material referring to these items will be a

single index card needed to locate the sealed items.

The Index card will bear only Mr. Kraft's name and

a file number.

3. Should some future need which we do not now

foresee require any official or employee of the

Department to obtain of permit access to the

aforesaid

items, the decision on such access shall

be made personally by the Attorney General. The

Attorney General shall not grant any access without

notifying Mi. Kraft of his counsel in writing at

least ten days prior thereto, and providing him or

..;*

them an opportunity to discuss the matter per-

sonally with the Attorney General before the

gIant is made.

The notice shall set forth the

date upon which access will be permitted if it is

granted, and the purpose for which and person by

whom access is sought. The Attorney General will

personally inform Mr.

Kraft or his counsel of a

decision to grant access as soon as practicable.

after it is made, but in any event at least five

business days before access occurs.

14. Although this arrangement is not intendea to

constitute a permanent solution to the questions

you have raised concerning these documents, it

will not be rescinded or modified by the Attorney

General or his

successors unless the Attorney Gen-

eral gives Mr. Kraft or his counsel ten days'

prior notice and affords him or them an opportun-

ity to discuss the matter personally with the

Attorney General before he rescinds or modifies

the agroomont.

the attornay Ceneral then

decides to rescind or modify this agreement he

shall. personally inform Mr. Kraft or his counsel

of that decision at least five business days before

it is implemented.

As a result of our discussions, I understand that this

temporary arrangement is acceptable to Mr. Kraft, of course

without waiver of any legal rights he may have as a result

of prior surveillances.

I advised you, we are working

now on general policy Acterminations which, we hope, will

offer a permanent solution to the problem this settles temp-

orarily.

Of course, under the terms of this agreement we

will notify you of any policy determination which would

involve a modification of this agreement.

Until a final policy is determined, this agreement should

assure Mr. Kraft that no person will read or otherwise use

these documents in any manner so long as they remain under

the seal arrangement.

Sincerely,

Mr. Hoover:

JUVE

Instead of taking up your time giving you a veri

report, I will set out briefly the basic facts in this n

relative to my European trip.

First, I am sure you would want to know how very, very

willing and cooperative this high-ranking official was.

moment I arrived I called for an appointment with him and was

others scheduled to see him because they were in his outer office

when I went through. He was too gracious, however, to mention it.

26332

Second, I presented directly the request and predicated

it on my reason

to believe that this person could be in contact

with the soviets and it was necessary to determine one way or

the other.

Giving

it this predication I thought would mate our

position nuch more valid and secure. he loid me they would do

it for us without any hesitation.

Parenthetically,

I might add

that such

a cover is regarded

as illegal.

However, he made no

mention of this and they do it all the time. He pointed out that

if this man is living at a hotel or an apartment where complicated

switchboards are involved, there would be some technical problems.

I told him that I understood this. He assured me that if it is

technically possible to do it, it would be done and if it required

solving a problem, it would be solved if at all possible.

Third, as it was necessary..for this official to have

this man located, the situation analyzed, and the equipment put

in use, I decided not to stay for a day or so to get a sampling

of the product.

If it could have been put on immediately,

I would,

of course, have stayed around a day to see what it would be like.

"Fourth, 'I instructed our Legat concerning the sensitivity

immediately in order that you will be able to handle it directly

Sixth,

the high-ranking official with whom

I dealt suggested

that we might want to give consideration at the end of this

operation to listening

to the tape with one of his translators

to see it they had overlooked anything significant, which he

said could happen because they know nothing about this person's

would send the tape over here but this is not possible because

they have an unbreakable rule that the tape can't be taken out of

Is it were removed; it would cause considerable wonderment and

speculation. However, he said he could safely and securely have

me enter a portion of this area to listen if I thought it necessary.

I told him this was a decision which could be faced after the

product was examined carefully and that then you would make the

docision.

Further Documents Pertaining

Any information with respect to the origins of National

Security Action Memorandum 161 would logically be in the records

of The Whice Housc, and you may desire to consult with the White

louse regarding this aspect or your request.

1 - The Attorney General

NOTE :

Although memoranda and other documents have been

prepared in the past in connection with the internal

security programs operated by the FBI pursuant to our legal

authority in this field, National Security Action Memorandum 161

simply transferred supervision of these internal security

programs from the National Security Council to the Attorney General.

These were ongoing programs whose essential character was not

altered by National Security Action Memorandum 161. It appears

that no documents were prepared within the FBI in connection

with its implementation. However, we have previously furnished

to the committee, with Departmental concurrence, copies of the

Attorney General's memorandum of March 5, 1964, and we are

referring the SSC to this document.

Within the Committee mandate, contained in

S. Res. 21, there are four broad subjects relating to the

intelligence community which we are required to investi-

gate and study in order to determine the facts and ulti-

mately to decide whether to make recommendations for

legislative or other changes.

they are:

I. The structure, performance, and utility of

government operations with respect to intel-

ligence activities.

2. Whether certain policies or practices are

or are not illegal, unethical, or otherwise

improper.

3. Whether there has or has not been excessive

duplication or inadequate coordination be-

tween and among intelligence agencies and,

more generally, the efficiency of intelli-

4.

Whether there has or has not been adequate

internal and external control and oversight

over the policies and practices of intelli-

gence agencies.

In attempting to find the answers to these funda-

mental questions, the Committee is proceeding in two ways.

First, we are examining intelligence functions broadly as

instruments of

government policy, giving attention to the

authority for particular functions, the problems which

dures by which intelligence activities are

intelligen a tireles are destined to see name

proposed, approved, executed, evaluated, and terminated,

the range and scope of the activities utilized to achieve

intelligence objectives, and the propriety and utility of

the activities undertaken.

Second, we will examine in

depth certain subjects within the broad topics of inves-

tigation. (We would, of course, welcome your suggestion

of other

cases that

would give

added insight into intelli-

gence matters under your jurisdiction.) These specific

subjects

for investigation are not intended to limit the

scope contained in the more general questions.

The annexed notifications spell these matters

out in greater detail. In addition, they ask certain

specific questions, set forth certain previously requested

documents not yet received, request additional documents,*

and, in some cases, ask for the names and present addresses

of persons who have held certain positions.

Where appro-

priate, the subject's description indicates that, pursuant

agreed Outline for Inquiry Procedures

primarily concerns allegations of abuse or other contre-

versial specific matters where there is reason to believe

improprieties may have occurred.

Finally, the notifications

indicate the name(s) of the staff member(s) who, in addition

to the Committee's senior staff, will be responsible for the

particular matters.

• The Committee, in the course of the next few

months, will undertake other subjects for investigation

as its work proceeds and will notify you as appropriate.

We look forward to your cooperation in these

matters.

Sincerely yours;

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

(INCLUDING DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE)

I.

Issues

The Committee's inquiry into the intelligence and

counterintelligence activities of the Federal Bureau

of Investigation is examining fundamental issues which

bear directly on the adequacy of current legislation

and administrative organization and procedure.

The

Committee seeks to determine whether FBI intelligence

and

counterintelligence activitles achieve legitimate

objectives in conformity with the rule of law.

Among

the basic issues to be addressed are the following:

A. What is the legal authority for FBI Intelligence

and counterintelligence activities?

Should the

FBI's authority be clarified or revised or

incorporated in a comprehensive statutory

charter?

B. What limitations are placed on FBI intelligence

and counterintelligence activities by the

Constitution and laws of the United States?

Should these limitations be clarified or

revised?

C. What have been the purposes and aims of FBI

intelligence and counterintelligence activities?

Should these objéctives be modified?:

D. How have the intelligence and counterintelligence

activities of the FBI been organized and coordinated

with other agencies of government?

Should these

procedures and practices be revised?

E. What have been the procedures for and techniques

of intelligence gathering and dissemination and

counterintelligence operations used by the FBI?

Under what conditions and through what procedures

should these methods and techniques be used in

the future?

F. What have been and should be the mechanisms for

internal and external policy-making, control,

and supervision of FBI intelligence

Intelligence activities?

.

As a means of

examining the above issues in the

sontext oi actual ibl intelligence operations,

the Committee intends to study certain specific

topics, some of which are general in nature, and

others of which involve specific cases, programs

or techniques.

Part II, below, contains descriptions

of the general areas into which the committee: intends

to inquire.

Part III contains descriptions or the

specific cases mentioned above.

The descriptions

specifically indicate whether the investigation may

concentrate on specific allegations of possible

abuses or other controversial matters where there

1s. reason to believe improprieties may have occurred.

• In addition to the topics described below, additional

areas of inquiry may develop during the course of the

Committee's work.

II.

Areas of General Inquiry

A.

Legal Authority. for FBI Intelligence and Counter-

intelligence Activities

The Committee is examining the legal basis for FBI

intelligence and counterintelligence activities.

There may be serious question as to the adequacy

of the present legislative framework for the FBI's

functions in these fields. Current statutes

authorize the FBI to perform investigative and law

enforcement functions, but they do not specifically

authorize intelligence or counterintelligence

•activities. Therefore; the Committee seeks to

determine whether the FBI's authority should be

clarifled, revised, or incorporated in a compre-

hensive statutory charter.

Responsible staff: Senior staff

Task Force leader

Mark Gitenstein

B. Organization and Operation of the FBI Intelli-

gence Division

The Committee is investigating the structure and

operating practices of the FBI Intelligence Divi-

sion.

Proposals have been made that the national

security intelligence and counterintelligence

functions of the FBI should be lodged in a

separate

agency or otherwise separated from the FBI's

criminal investigative activities.

Further recom-

mendations have been advanced for improved coordina-

tion between the FBI and other intelligence agencies,

for strengthened

supervision of FBI intelligence and

counterintelligence activities by the Attorney

General or an independent board, and for clearer

standards and procedures for FBI activities in this

area. Thererore, the committee desires complete

information on the operating practices and proce-

dures of the FBI Intelligence Division and of the

field office activities supervised by the Intelli-

The Committee's inquiry focuses on the following

specific areas:

1. FBI Internal Security Intelligence Operations

The Committee seeks to determine the nature

and purpose of FBI intelligence operations

directed at foreign intelligence activities

and subversive or extremist activities within

the United States.

It has been alleged

that

the scope of FBI intelligence investigations

is too broad and has

extended to legitimate

political activities. Consequently, the Com-

mittee must examine how the FBI's responsibili-

ties have been defined.

Responsible staff: Senior staff

Task Force leader

Mark Gitenstein

2.

The FBI and the U. S. Intelligence Community

The Committee seeks to determine what have

been the policies and procedures for coordina-

tion between the FBI and other agencies in the

-U: S. intelligence community.

There have been

occasions in the past where friction between

the FBI and other agencies has produced serious

dissatisfaction within the U. S. intelligence

community.

The purpose of this inquiry is to

evaluate the adequacy of past and present co-

•ordinating mechanisms.

FBI Foreign Counterintelligence Operations

The Committée seeks to determine the nature of

FBI counterintelligence operations directed at

foreign intelligence activities within the

United States or at any other hostile foreign-

related activities within the United States.

Since FBI operations to "counter" these activi-

ties go beyond intelligence collection, the

Committee must consider whether such practices

require statutory authorization. The impact

of counterintelligence operations on United

States foreign relations will also be considered..

Responsible staff: Senior staff

Task Force leader

Loch Johnson

Barbara Banoff

Inspection Division Investigations

The Committee is examining the relationship

of the FBI Inspection Division to FBI intelli-

gence and counterintelligence activities.

This

includes both regular Inspection. Division

reviews of Intelligence Division and field

office functions and specific investigations

of allegations of improper conduct in connec-

tion with FBI intelligence activities.

FBI Intelligence Activities and State or Local

Law Enforcement Agencies

The Committee seeks to determine the nature of

the relationships between FBI intelligence

• activities and state and local law enforcement

agencies.

This subject involves the delicate

balance between the necessary contralization

of certain law enforcement activities and the

Constitutionally-mandated decentralization of

general law enforcement responsibility.

It is

necessary for the Committee to evaluate the

centralizing influence of the FBI, as well as

the FBI's role as a check on local law enforce-

ment abuses.

IIT. Case Studies

General Questions

The descriptions which follow of the specific cases the

Committee intends to

study are, intended to serve the

dual purpose of notifying the W'BI of the issues the

Committee will explore in connection with each case

and eliciting from the FBI all information and material

• the techniques listed above, as well as to the

matters

set forth in the following specific cases.

°1.

Warrantless Electronic Surveillance

The Committee seeks to determine whether the

Attorney General should have the authority

to authorize electronic

This power has been exercised by succeeding

Attorneys General since 1940, upon the explicit

directive of the President.

Clandestine Informant Activities

The Comnittee is examining all aspects of the

FBI's use of informants, sources, and undercover

personnel and the techniques employed by such per-

sons.

Although informants are the single most

productive source of intelligence information, the

difficulties of controlling their activities may

increase the possibility of improper conduct.

The

use of informants to infiltrate organizations also

may pose dangers to the right of associational pri-

Consequently, proposals have been made for

• Enc impositton of a Judicial warrant requirement

or other safeguards for the use of informants.

The Committee seeks to evaluate such proposals

well as the contributions of informants to the

accomplishment of legitimate objectives.

In addition,

the Committee is examining informant

activities

with respect to several particular situa-

tions and cases.

This investigation may involve

specific allegations of abuse or controversial

matters where there is reason to believe improprie-

ties may have occurred. The Committee's inquiry

covers the general circumstances surrounding the

following incidents or cases:

a. Wounded Knee;

b. Kent State;

c. • New York v. Stroble (Attica);

d. United States v. Buckalew (Gainesville);

The "Huston Plan"

The Committee is examining the FBI's role in the

disposition of the report of the Interagency Com-

mittee on Intelligence (Ad Hoc) in 1970. This

report as submitted to the President included cer~

tain options which were specifically identified as

"illegal". It purported to represent the joint

recommendations of all members of the U. S. intel-

ligence community, but FBI Director J. Edgar

Hoover disagreed in a series of footnotes.

The serious consideration given to such al-.

egedly illegal proposals gives this case

othe utmost significance.for the Committee's under-

standing of the risks of uncontrolled intelligence

activity. This case may involve specific allega-

tions of abuse and controversial matters where

there is reason to believe improprieties may have

occurred.

Questions

The Committee requests that the FBI and the Justice

Department address the following specific questions:

I. What contacts occurred between Tom Charles

Huston and personnel of the FBI and the Depart-

ment of Justice during 1969 and 1970? Identify

by date and names of persons involved.

2. What was the purpose of each

such contact?

3. ° With respect to any assistance provided to the

Interdepartmental Committee on Intelligence

(Ad Hoc) by personnel of the FBI:

a. Who were the FBI participants?

b. What kind of assistance was provided?

C.

What was the role of the FBI in preparing

the various drafts of the special report

of the Committee?

What were the specific arguments advanced

for the inclusion of the allegedly illegal

options in the

special report submitted for

the President's consideration? Were other

allegedly illegal options considered and

rejected?

Were any measures taken by the FBI to imple-

ment specific elements of the Huston Plan?

This includes both the allegedly "illegal"

aspects and other provisions such as the

expanded recruitment of 18-21 year old infor-

mants.

What are the present views of the FBI and

the Department of Justice as to the legality

and propriety of the various options included

in the special report?

June 27, 1975

Within the Committee mandate, contained in

So Res. 21, there are lour broad subjects relating to ene

intelligence community which we are requirea to investi-

gate and study in order to determine tne facts and ulti

mately to decide whether to make recommendations for

legislative or other changes. • They are:

1. The structure, performance, and utility of

government operations with

respect to intel-

ligence activities.

i"

2.

Whether certain policies or practices are

or are not illegal, unethical, or otherwise

improper.

3.

Whether there has or has not been excessive

duplication or inadequate coordination be-

tween and among intelligence agencies and,

more generally, the efficiency of intelli

gence activities.

4.

Whether there has or has not been adequate

internal and external control and oversight

over the policies and practices of intelli-

gence agencies.

In attempting to find the answers to these funda-

mental questions, the Committee is proceeding in two ways.

First, we are examining intelligence functions broadly as

instruments of government policy, giving attention to the

authority for particular functions, the problems which

intelligence activities are designed to solve, the proce-

dures by which intelligence activities are and have been

proposed, approved, executed, evaluated, and terminated,

the range and scope of the activities utilized to achieve

Intelligence objectives, and the propriety and utility of

the activities undertaken.

Second, we will examine in

depth certain subjects within the broad topics of inves-

tigaticn.

(We would, of course, welcome your suggestion

of other

cases that would give added insight into intelli-

gence matters under your jurisdiction.

These specific

subjects for investigation are not intended to limit the

scope contained in the more general questions.

specific questions, set forth certain previously requested

documents not yet received, request adâitional documents,

and, in some cases, ask for the names and present adaresses

of persons who have

Issues

The Committee's inguiry into the intelligence and

counterintelligence activities of the Federal Bureau

of Investigation is

examining fundamental issues which

bear directly on

the adequacy of current legislation

and administrative organization and proccaure.

Committee seeks to determine whether FBI intelligence

and

counterintelligence activities achieve legitimate

objectives in conformity with the rule of law.

Among

the basic issues to be addressed are the following:

A: What is the legal authority for FBI intelligence

and counterintelligence activities?

Should the

FBI's authority be clarified or revised of

incorporated in a comprehensive statutory

charter?

B. What limitations are placed on FBI Intelligence

and counterintelligence activities by the

Constitution and laws of the United States?

Should these limitations be clarified or

revised?

C.

What have been the purposes and aims of FBI

intelligence and counterintelligence

activities?

Should these

objéctives

be modified?

D. How have the

Intelligence and counterintelligence

activities of the FBI been organized and coordinated

with other agencies of government?

Should these

procedures and practices be revised?

E. What have been the procedures for and techniques

of intelligence gathering and dissemination and

counterintelligence operations used by the FBI?

Under what conditions and through what procedures

should these methods and techniques be used

• In

the future?

F.

What have been and should be the mechanisms

for

internal and external policy-making, control.

and supervision of FBI

intelligence

and counter-

Intelligence activities?

As a means of examining the above issues in the

sontext of actual Ibe InteLligence operations,

the committee intends to study certain specific

topics, some of which are general in nature, and

others of which involve

specific cases, programs

or techniques.

Part Il, below, contains

descriptions

of the general areas into which the committee: intends

to inquire.

Zait lil contains descriptions of cre

specific cases mentioned above.

The descriptions

specifically indicate whether the investigation nay

of possible

abuses or other controversial matters where there

is reason to believe improprieties may have occurred.

In addition to the topics described below, additional

areas of inquiry may, develop during the course of the

A.

Legal Authority. for FBI Intelligence and Counter-

intelligence Activities

The Committee is examining the legal basis for FBI

intelligence and

cointerintelligence activities.

There may be serious question as to the adequacy

of the present legislative framework for the rol's

functions in these fields. Current statutes

authorize the FBI to perform investigative and law

enforcement functions, but they do not specifically

authorize intelligence

or counterintelligence

'activities.

Therefore; the Committee seeks to

determine whethef the FBI's authority should be

clarified, revised, or incorporated in

• a compre-

hensive

statutory charter.

Responsible staff: Senior 'staff

Task Force leader

Mark Gitenstein

B.

Organization and Operation of the FBI Intelli-

gence Division

• The Committee is investigating the structure and

operating practices of the FBI Intelligence Divi-

sion.

Proposals have been made that the national

security intelligence and counterintelligence

functions of the FBI should be lodged in a

• separate

agency or otherwise separated from the FBI's

criminal investigative activities.

Further recom-

mendations have been advanced for

improvea coordina-

tion between the FBI and other intelligence agencies,

for strengthened

supervision of FBI intelligence and

counterintelligence activities by the Attorney

General or an independent board, and for clearer

standards and procedures for FBI activities in this

area.

Therefore, the Committee desires complete

information on the operating practices and proce

dures of the FBI Intelligence Division and of the

field office activities supervised by the Intelli-

gence Division.

The Committee's inquiry focuses on the folloing

specific areas:

1. FBI Internal Security Intelligence Operations

The Committee

seeks to determine the nature

and purpose of FBI intelligence operations

direcüed at foreign intelligence accivities

and subversive or extremist activities

within

the United States.

It has been alleged that

the scope of FBI intelligence investigations

is too broad and

has extended to legitimate

political activities. Consequently, the com-

mittee must examine how the FBI's responsibili-

ties have been defined.

Responsible staff: Senior staff

Task Force leader

Mark Gitenstein

2. The FBI and the U. S. Intelligence Community

The Committee seeks to determine what have

been

the policies ana procedures for coordina-

tion between the FBI and other agencies in the

- U:S. intelligence community.

There have been

occasions in the

past where

friction betreen

the FBI and other agencies nas produced

serious

dissatisfaction within the U.S. intelligence

community.

The purpose of this inquiry is to

evaluate the adequacy of past and present co-

• ordinating mechanisms.

FBI Foreign Counterintelligence Operations

The Committée seeks to determine the nature of

FBI counterintelligence operations directed at

foreign intelligence activities within the

United States of at any other hostile foreign-

related activities .ithin the United States.

Since FBI operations

to "counter" these activi-

go beyond intelligence collection, the

Committee must consider whether such practices

require statutory authorization.

The impact

of counterintelligence operations on United

States foreign relations will also be considered..

FBI Intelligence Activities and State or Local

Law Enforcement Agencies

The Committce seeks to determine the nature of

the relationships bauween aBi irtelligence

activities and state and local law enforcement

agencies.

This subject involves the delicate

balance between the necessary contralization

of certain law enforcement activities and che

Constitutionally-mandated decentralization of

general law enforcement responsibility.

It is

necessary for the Committee to evaluate the

centralizing influence of the FBI, as well as

the FBI's role as a check on local law enforce-

ment abuses.

Electronic Surveillance

The Committee is examining all forms of electronic

interception of. communications including wiretap-

ping; electronic eavesdropping, consensual elec-

tronic surveillance interception of. video and iata

communications, local monitoring devices, and all

other forms of

electronic or technical monitoring.

The Committce's general questions apply to each of

* the techniques listed above, as well as to the

matters

set forth in the following specific cases.

•1.

Warrantless Electronic Surveillance

The Committee seeks to determine whether the

Attorney General should have the authority

to authorize electronic surveillance for cer-

tain purposes without a prior judicial warrant.

This power

has been exercised by succeeding

Attorneys General since 1940, upon the explicit

directive of the President.

The Suoreme Court

• has ruled that this power does not extena to

purely domestic matters, but the remaining scope

of the Attorney General's authority remains un-

defined by the supreme court..

Questions

The Committee requests that the FBI and the

The "Huston Plan"

The Committee is examining the FBI's role in the

disposition of the report of the Interagency Com-

mittee on Intelligence (Ad Hoc) in 1970.

This

report as submitted to the President included cer

tain options which were

specifically identified as

"illegal".

It purported to represent the joine

recommendations of all members of the U. S. intel-

ligence community, but FBI Director J. Edgar

Hoover disagreed in a series of footnotes.

The serious consideration given to such al-

legedly illegal proposals gives this

the utmost significance for the Committee's under-

standing of the risks of uncontrolled intelligence

activity. This icase may involve specific allega-

tions of abuse and controversial matters where

there is reason to believe improprieties may nave

occurred.

Questions

The Committee requests that the FBI and the Justice

Department address the following specific questions:

I. What contacts occurred between Iom Charles

Huston and personnel of the FBI and the Depart-

ment of Justice during 1969 and 197C?

Identify
