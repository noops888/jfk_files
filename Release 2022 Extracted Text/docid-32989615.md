MEMORANDUM FOR MR. SULLIVAN

I have given very careful consideration to your memoranda of
June 7, 1971, and June 16, 1971, together with the memorandum of

Mr. Wannall of May 27, 1971, which was initialled by you; Mr. Wannall's
memorandum of May 28, 1971, initialled by you; my letter to the President
dated September 21, i970, initialled by you; your memorandum of

‘September 22, 1970; Mr. Brennan's memorandum of September 21, 1970,
initialled by you; and also Mr. Child's memorandum of May 23, 1969,
analyzing the work and the accomplishments of our various foreign liaison
offices and the problems incident thereto, together with the recommendations
of Messrs. Dalbey, Felt, and Beaver upon the recommendation made in your
memorandum of June 7, 1971, suggesting the closing down of a number of !
the foreign liaison offices, some of them recently established last December |
with your approval. : {

First and foremost, I want to clarify a point you have raised in
your memoranda, namely that our foreign liaison offices, with the ex
of Mexico City, are not operational and that we cannot develop "hard, high
quality, positive intelligence by sending men to these countries only ina
liaison capacity." We do not have the legal right to establish any foreign
offices on an operational basis. The law specifically limits foreign intelli,
gence operations to coverage by the CIA, and, therefore, we have known
all along that our offices in foreign countries could not be in an operational|
status.”

I cannot agree that establishing liaison offices in foreign coun-
tries without being operational prevents us from developing hard, high quality
and positive intelligence. Certainly in all memoranda prior to your memo-
randum of June 7, 1971, you did not indicate any such reservation and, in
fact, you specifically initialled the memorandum of Mr. Brennan addressed

to you under date of September 21, 1970, upoa whieh 1 predicated my letter
to the President of September 21, 1976. At that time J believed that by
reason of your approval of the various memoranda dealing with the foreign
Haison operations, you were in accord with the procedures which the Bureau
bad followed and, in fact, opproved the establishment of additional Maison
offices which } Hated in my letter to the President of September 21, 1970,
and which 1 indicated was predicoted upon Mr. Erensien's memorandum of
ine ecienad 21, 1970,

¥ want to also point out that at no time, either in ceptember or
more recently, did Lever suggest to the President the idea that we should
expand our foreiga Maison operations. it was the President's iden expressed
to re in Geptember, 1970, that auch expansion ahould take place, and, as
a vesult thereoi, 1 submitted roy letter to him of september 31, 1570. The
President i kuow in my progente directed My. Haldeman ta present my
letter to the President to the Secretary of State for prompt and immediate
concurrence. Several montis passed, and tt was not until Gecember, 1976,
that Dr. Kissinger inguired of me as to what had happened to the expansion
of ow foreign Haison which the President bad anproved being expanded in
Septenter, 1070, When [told Dr. Kissinger that this matter bad been
delayed in the State Department and that I hed been awaiting word for approval
of the same by the Seoretary of State, Or. Kisvinger stated he would personally
take this matter up with the Presidont mad that 1 would receive in a few days
the State Departraent's aporoval of the expansion of our foreign liaison,
neveral days later in Recembker, 1076, | received a telephone call irom .
seeretary of State Rogers stating that the President bed epoken to hira about
the expansion of ow foreign Baison oporations and that he was in full accord
with the saaie with the excaplion of the opening of an office st Helsinki in
view of the paading negotistions te be carried on there by representatives
of the Russian Government aud the United States Government concerning
the Hmnflation of arms. As 1 have previously indicated in my memorandum
to you, } concurred with the suggestion of the Xecretary of State and countored .
with the recommendation that instead of opening an offica at Helsink, we open
an office at Copentagen, with which the Seeretary agreed,

letter of 9/20/71 to Secretary Rogers requesting clearance for
six new liaison posts abroad had been referred to the Committee
for clearance, As part of their normal procedure, the views of
the affected Ambassadors were solicited with the result that a
number of questions were raised, State is currently in the process
of effecting a five per cent reduction in U.S. personnel overseas :

the nersonnei complement with which he is charged. Several
Ambassadors asked what information might be given to the host :

selected, fe . a :

as in the case with our other posts, our representatives will be
establishing and maintaining liaison with the police and other
investigative agencies of the countries visited in order to

Honorable John Notiwin Tl-.
Under Secretary of State .

Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Irwin:

Ambassador Wymberley Coerr and Mr. R. Glynn ways 3°
of your Department have asked for additional details with “3:
reference to ny letter of September 20, 1971, to Secretary
Rogers. Specific questions were raised concerning the

Pox es

location of the proposed new posts and concerning our R
method of operation when they are established. Sa5
In general, our need for additional liaison oie
abroad stems from the constantly increasing travel abroad Bo
' of United States citizens under in’ tigation in this eA
: country. or example, jusi five years ago in fiseal 1966, ai

rey a total of 653 persons wanted in he United States were
ocated through requests initiated by our Legal Attaches.
n fiscal 1971, 2369 such persons were located. in fiscal
4966, slightly more than $800,000 in property stolen in the
nited States was located abroad; while in fiscal 1971,
dearly $1,500,000 of such property was so located. In :
lesponse to earlier programs aimed at reducing United States
lersonnel abroad, I closed our posts at Manila, Rio de Janeiro
: - #nd Santo Domingo and endeavored to cover those areas by
‘road trip from other posts. This has resulted in inevitable
delays and in materially increased travel costs, As a
result, when the President asked that I increase our liaison
activities abroad, I suggested the reopening of these three ~
posts, : i ;

an Our method of operation at each post will continue,
as in the past, to include the developnent and maintenance: ‘
of a close, cooperative relationship with the police and

comments concerning the six proposed new offices follow:

CANBERRA, AUSTRALIA Australia and New Zealand
were originally covered by road trip from
7 Manila and subsequently, following the close
. : of our post in Manila, from Hong Kong. The
ne yolume of work, particularly in Australia,
has increased to the point that it can no
longer be handled efficiently at such a
- distance, and it is expected that the a
* establishment of a representative in Canberra -

WiLL provide for the more rapid handling of 7
vou s ouxy requests. In addition to the Commonwealth :
’ Police and[the Australian Security Intelligence
Organization, liaison would also be maintained ~
with the state and territorial police agencies tgs

KUALA LUMPUR , MALAYSIA ‘The Agent stationed’
here would be responsible for liaison in
Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore, all currently
.t being covered by road trip from Hong Kong, and
would initiate coverage in Indonesia.
preee Kuala Lumpur was chosen as a central location 27
for the coverage of this large area which is
increasingly visited by persons of interest to
the FBI. My representatives in Hong Kong have
- been unable to visit this area with sufficient
frequency to insure the prompt handling of our
ae : work.

Honorable John

« MANILA, PHILIPPINES Our liaison post was ©
originally opened in Manila in August,
1961, and was closed on August 31, 19659,
in an effort to reduce overseas-costs,
Although relatively close to Hong Kong,
. from which.the area has since been covered, oe

- the volume of our work in the Philippines. See
such that it can best be handied by a man
on the scene as we have encountered numerous
delays in our efforts to secure information
at long distance. The continued United States
military presence in the Philippines, coupled
-with the large number of Philippine nationals
who have become involved in difficulties in

7 the United States and then returned to their

home, has resulted in the continuation of a : an

relatively large work load in this area. sac aaeenue saaee

NEW DELHI, INDIA This is an area in which : .
Ye have not previously had regular coverage, - a AE
and it has been necessary on a number of a
eeeasions to despatch representatives from .
ral : Rome or Hong Kong to handle problems arising
ee there. It is planned that our representative
aoa in New Delhi will cover not only India but also
saat East and West Pakistan and Nepal. It is possible
ve : that additional territory may be assigned to
‘ Secune this office in the future. It is noted that :
7 - there are nine graduates of the FBI National —
Academy located in this area. :

RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL This office, which was
in operation from 1941 to 1967, was consolidated
with our post in Buenos Aires, Argentina, as an
economy measure. During the more than four years
that it has been closed, it has become increasingly
apparent that the loss in prompt and effective
coverage is greater than the small saving justifies.
A number of individuals of interest to the FBi

have either moved or traveled to Brazil, and it |

Honorable. Joba. N... Iewin..t

has become apparent that prompt coverage

can only be secured through direct,and .
7 . continuing liaison with the investigative
ee SEaREEe! agencies of this huge country. _

“SANTO DOMINGO, DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
This office, originaliy opened Bay 21,
-1965, was closed March 18, 1969, as an
. economy measure and coverage has been 7 BCP
bo. maintained by Agents assigned to the FBI . apTauane Sat
PEE EEets . office in San Juan, Puerto Rico. It is fet
aaeeace - proposed that the Agent assigned to -
. Santo Domingo will initiate coverage in
Haiti. There is a considerable population
of Dominican exiles residing in the
United States who continue to be involved
with the various political factions in the
Dominican Republic, thereby creating
problems of FRI interest in connection with ©
the Neutrality Act, the Foreign Agents
7. Registration Act and other matters affecting
zat a internal security interests. Toa smaller | an
Heo extent, this is also true of Haiti. i

Although my request for this limited expansion
was made at the specific instruction of the President, I
know that he would not sanction an operation which was not
economically worthwhile. You may be assured that, as in
the past, these new posts will be carefully supervised and
prompt action taken should it be determined either that
their continued existence is not warranted or that additional ..
assistance is necessary. I hope that it will be possible
for you to secure the requisite clearances in the near future.

R. Glynn Mays of the Department of State who has :

‘ been handling, on a working level, our request to expand our
foreign liaison telephoned 11/4/71. He stated that the “
affected Ambassadors had been canvassed again for their .
concurrence and each had raised a number of additional questions.” ~
He explained that basically, the Ambassadors were chafing :
at a request for expansion at a time when the Government is

in the throes of additional contraction in its overseas posts,
and he indicated that a number of the Ambassadors had pointed

out that there are existing arrangements under which FBI

leads can be handled in their territory and they do not under-
stand, based on the small volume of work they have witnessed

in the past, why FBI wishes to station a man in the territory
full time. With reference to our request to open in Kuala
Lumpur, Malaysia, he said he would like us to authorize him

st

ts suplore
alternative. He stated an overwhelming percentage of the
personnel in the American Embassy at Kuala Lumpur are actually
Central Intelligence Agency representatives, and the Ambassador:.
felt there should be no further addition of Security repre-.--~
sentatives, .

Mays said that Ambassador ‘Coerr, who had visited
the Bureau with Mays 10/12/71 to discuss our request, had_.-

numerous questions raised by the Ambassadors could be dis-

could participate in the discussion. Mays was told that the

' SUBJECT: EXPANSION OF [FOREIGN/ LIAISON

As instructed, I met’ on 11/24/71 with State Under
Secretary John N. Irwin II; Deputy Under Secretary William
B. Macomber, Jr.; his Executive Assistant, Samuel R. Gammon;
Wymberley Coerr, Deputy Director, Bureau of Intelligence and
Research; and R. Glynn Mays of State's Methods and Systems
Staff. I was accompanied by SA Graham A. Day of this Division.
Mr. Irwin, who was unable to stay for the entire meeting,
stated he was most appreciative of the Director's rapid and
cooperative response to his request for further discussion.
He pointed out that he has a tremendous respect for the Director
and for the organization which he has built and has instructed
his personnel at State to do everything in their power to 7
fulfill the FBI request. He noted that the request did, however,
represent a substantial problem for State and that he had 7
asked for discussion because of the difficulties which State
had encountered,

that FBI liaison activities be expanded. The President has
also, however, instructed that the official profile of the
United States be lowered abroad and that a five percent
across-the-board reduction in United States overseas personnel
be made. Coming as it does on the heels of President Johnson's
fifteen percent reduction and President Nixon's earlier ten ~
percent reduction, this has created serious staffing problems
tim each’ Ul’. Embassy, As the Ambassador's concurrence is
necessary before any new personnel can be sent abroad, each
. o£ those potentially affected by our expansion was consulted
by State and each one raised serious objections. Some, as
will be indicated below, questioned the necessity for an Agent-—_
to be stationed in their countries and several, pointing to
the current expansion of the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous
Drugs, which is also being strongly resisted, asked why one

Memorandum E. S. Miller to Mr. Rosen
Re: EXPANSION OF FOREIGN LIAISON ..-° - : .

I pointed out that there would be no possibility
of our “doubling up" with Narcotics investigators, explaining
that our functions and methods of operation are totally
different and would actually be incompatible in some areas.
I noted that our modest request had actually been scaled ~*~
down before it was forwarded to State and that we had limited
each office to a single Agent with only one Clerk-Stenographer.
I referred to the detailed explanation for our request which
had been furnished in our letter of 10/14/71 to Mr. Irwin
and stated that we would not have made the request if we
shad not felt it fully justified and responsive to the
‘President's instruction. I said that we would, however,
earéfully consider each part of the request once more to
‘ see if there was any way in which the total number of personnel
j involved might be reduced. It was agreed that following this
4 review, we would meet again for further discussion during
the week of November 29, 1971. Comments and recommendations
concerning the specific areas follow:

Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

The Agency for International Development Mission
here has been withdrawn in the face of local criticism of
U. S. efforts to influence the Brazilian Police. We have
béen covering this enormous country from our office in
Argentina on a 2,500 mile round trip basis. No criticism
has been made of our liaison contacts with the Brazilian
Police or other agencies, and we feel we should insist on
reopening our office here. By reducing our staff in

We_ believe we could forgo opening an office here
at this time as as, of thé various offices considere > this
‘FOULA probably be the least productive of political intelli-
gence since it has a stable government and enjoys friendly
relations with the U. 8. From a cost standpoint, this would
probably be the most expensive post to open merely because

ACTION:

It is recommended that we inform State we have
very carefully reconsidered our request and, in an effort
to be fully cooperative, we have altered our request with
the result that only six additional positions*abroad will be
pruceced wather thau the twelve originally requested. We will
ask to open at Rio de Janeiro, Manila, New Delhi and Singapore,
making other arrangements for the coverage we had requested
from Santo Domingo and Canberra, We will press for an
early meeting for the consideration of this proposal and

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED !

Gare WO|Ed By: IED |

As indicated in memorandum 11/29/71, we had an ~
appointment to discuss our expansion further with Deputy
Under Secretary of State Macomber at 3:30 p.m., 11/30/71.
At noon on 11/30/71, Mr. Macomber's office advised that he
had been unexpectedly summoned by the Secretary of State
to a meeting which would occupy the balance of the afternoon,
and we were asked to postpone our discussion until 12/2/71.

I stated that I was quite anxious to resolve this matter
without further delay and asked to meet with other State
representatives to discuss our proposal as originally planned.
Accordingly, we met with Ambassador Wymberley Coerr, Deputy
anme Director. of -State's Bureau of Intelligence and Research;
Samuel R. Gammon, Executive Assistant to Mr. Macomber; and

R. Glynn Mays of State's Methods and Systems Staff. I was
accompanied by SA Graham Day of this Division.

. -I stated that the staffing problems encountered

by State had been explained to the Director and that, in
an effort to cooperate, he had authorized us to materially
reduce our initial request. ‘I said that we would agree to
Singapore in place of Kuala Lumpur as suggested by State,
and we would cancel our request to open offices in Canberra
and Santo Domingo. I pointed out that we would staff our
office in Rio de Janeiro by reducing our present staff in
.. . Buenos Aires and that we were therefore requesting, in effect,
4 only six additional positions abroad(3 Agents, 3 clerks) in.

Ambassador Coerr” said that he greatly appreciate
~ the Director's cooperation and asked that his thanks bes :
conveyed to the Director for this.—_He_instructed Mr, Mays .
to immediately wire the Ambassador in Singapore to explore
the possibility of our opening there in place of Kuala Lumpur.
He then stated that our choice of Manila was especially
troublesome, because, at Presidential direction, a special
reduction in'U. S. persontiel had ‘been ‘made there over and °

that he would ask that we discuss it further with the Director

In addition, Mr. Mays said that the Ambassador in New Delhi

: which the President had, on September 20, 1971, asked the
" * Director to expand his liaison operations abroad and that
here we were more than two months later without having taken
: a Single action in direct response to the President's instruction,
i : I pointed out that it seemed to me that the President's instruction
| F should take precedence over any Ambassadorial question and .
: that I saw no point in becoming involved in quibbling with
individual Ambassadors in efforts to justify doing what the
President had asked. Ambassador Coerr said that he understood
our position perfectly and State would proceed to correspond
with the Ambassadors further. He did ask that we present
the snecial problem of Manila for determination by the Director.

i
I
I
l

With respect to Manila, we have a fair volume of
work there now which we do not have in Australia. Further,
we do not feel it would be feasible to cover Manila from
Australia because of the distance involved, and we want to
leave our office in Hong Kong free to concentrate on the
greatly enlarged Chinese problem. We feel, therefore, that
despite the Ambassador's objection, we should insist upon
reopening our office in Manila,

7 ACTION: If approved, we will inform Ambassador Coerr that
~ Bis proposal that Canberra be substituted for Manila has been .
reviewed by the Director and that he feels, as he did when-
he approved the reduced proposal, that it is essential for
‘us to reopen our office in’ Manila. We will also tell :

~ Ambassador Coerr again that too much time has already elapsedi

and that this matter should be Eaceabetee promptly. |

desired the Bureau's views on a letter to be addressed to the President
by the Attorney General commenting on the recommendations of the
captioned Commission in its final report.

At 3:21 p.m.on July 1, 1975, he furnished me a copy of the .
proposed letter to the President and a copy of its enclosure, "Comments
on Recommendations of the Commission on CIA Activities Within the
United States." I took the material immediately to Mr. Wannall and
following our review, we discussed our suggestions with Mr. Callahan
and Mr. Jenkins and then telephonically advised Mr. Marvin of the
proposed changes. Mr. Marvin adopted all of the proposed changes
except our suggestion that the paragraph regarding Recommendation 30
should include a comment that any agreement between.the CIA and the FBI
should not be undertaken until we have more information concerning possible
legislation which may be enacted following the conclusion of the inquiries
being made by the Senate Select Committee. -

On July 2, 1975, I received from Mr. Marvin a copy of the final

absence of any change in the paragraph regarding Recommendation 30.
Mr. Marvin explained that while they concurred in our reservations about
attempting to draft an agreement without considering the possibility of new
legislation, they felt that the cover letter to the President indicated

Dear Mr. President:

In your memorandum of June 11th you requested our
comments on the recommendations of the Commission on
CIA activities within the United States (The Rotkefeller
Commission). Many of the recommendations bear directly
on the operations of this Department, since a change in
the charter of the Central Intelligence Agency will often
earry with it implications with respect to the responsi-
bilities of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

I am enclosing a memorandum which consists of
recommendations which may require some modification
before they are implemented. :

The observations are preliminary in nature because
tion with other agencies of the gSvernment as well as
with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. We have already
begun this process and are moving as quickly as possible.

I will, of course, keep you irifovmed on the progress

to the CIA.

MEMORANDUM

COMMENTS ON RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE COMMISSION ON CIA
ACTIVITIES (WITHIN THE UNITED STATES

~ The comments of the Department of Justice on -
the recommendations of the Commission are as follows:

: Recommendation 2, suggests an Executive Order
spelling out the CIA's jurisdiction for collecting in-
formation about the dowiestic activities of U.S.
citizens. The functions of the FBI in domestic intelli-
gence investigations and counterintelligence investiga~
tions within the United States ought to be kept quite
separate from the functions of the CIA. The.problem is

_ more than "proper coordination with the FBI" as the

" recommendation seems to suggest. Domestic counterin-
telligence is within the responsibility of the FBI. As
to that part of the recommendation urging the destruction
of information, it should be noted that some of this in-.
formation may have found its sway into FBI files where it
may or may not be legitimately retained. Further, the
‘recommendation suggests that information inconsistent
with the Executive Order be destroyed at the conclusion
of pending congressional investigations or as soon there-
after as permitted by law. In this respect, it should be
made clear that no files should be destroyed before the
Department of Justice closes its case as to possible
eriminal violations by CIA officials or employees.

Recommendation 3, that Congress establish a
Joint Committee on Intelligence, raises the question whether
this committee would be yet another oversight committee
. for the FBI as well. As the report recognizes, when there

7 are too many committees assuming an oversight function ..

conflicts and confusion inevitably arise.

Recommendation 6 concerns theestablishment of
guidelines. governing CIA's relationship with the Department
of Justice with respect to allegations of criminal conduct
by CIA or its employees. . It is no longer Department policy,
La. if it ever was, to defer prosecutorial decisions to CIA,

7 . or cases concerning CIA activities. This Commission recom-
mendation is a good one, and the guidelines must make clear:
that the Department will prosecute.criminal conduct by CIA
or -its employees wich tne same vigor ‘ait would prosecute
any other criminal conduct. :

Rectmmendation 9(g) suggests that the CIA's
Inspector General Reports ~- some of which may involve
allegations of criminal activity -- should be provided to
* the National Security Council and the Executive Oversight
body: for the CIA whose establishment is recommended else-
where in the report. Such a reporting’ requirement is un-
objectionable, but it should not be read as putting the
a decision whether to bring allegations of criminal conduct
: to the attention of the Department of Justice in the
hands of persons outside CIA. Any possible criminal
violations by CIA or its employees should be reported
directly and immediately to the Department of Justice by
the CIA Inspector General.

Recommendation 12 calls for guidelines on CIA
employees’ conduct. These guidelines are important and
- + will not,we suspect, be easy to draft. The recommendation
_ also_suggests that the Director of Central Intelligence
should approve all actions raising questions of-CIA author-
ity. If any proposed activity raises the possibility of
eriminal violation, the Attorney General should also be
consulted.

Recommendation 13 suggests that the CIA should
be prohibited from engaging in domestic mail openings, .
‘but it leaves open the question, whether the CIA ought to
participate in the opening of thexmail of U.S. citizens
abroad. -Further, part (b) of the récommendation ‘implies
that the CIA may conduct mail cover examinations in the
United States. This raises the question whether the CIA
rather than the FBI should be conducting any domestic |
HEE Ee activities of this sort. : : : .

Reconméndation 14: raises s2rious problems. For

bi one thing, it suggests the development of an evaluation
unit within the Department of Justice or the FBI to coordin~
ate intelligence and counterintelligence information. This

“ could be viewed as an invitation to create a new internal
security organization for the purpose of keeping track of
dissident domestic political groups. On the other hand,
failure to create such an ocganization could be seen as .
perpetuating some of the aifficulties suggested in the
report. The Department cf Jusvice is studying this recom-

W 65360 Docld:32989615 Page 56
ty



mendation to determine the proper solution to this problem.

aa : ;
Recommendation 15 suggests that the President refrain

| from directing the CIA to perform what .are essentially

“internal security tasks. - Because of the need for a rather

strict separation of the functions of the CIA and the FBI,

the difficult question of defining an internal security

matter probably ought to be undertaken. The recommendation -

also calis for destruction of certain files of the CHAOS

joo project. No files of the CHAOS project should be destroyed
before the Department of Justice closes its dasé as to possible

criminal violatiors by CIA officials or employees in. connection
with the CHAOS files.

Recommendation 16 calls for a written determination
by the Director of Central Intelligence that CIA infiltration
of domestic groups is necessary "to meet’ a clear danger to ~
agency facilities, operations, or: personnel, and that ade-
quate coverage by law enforcement agencies is unavailable."
On the basis of the Commission report, it is not clear under
what circumstances it would ever be necessary and proper
for the CIA to infiltrate domestic groups. Perhaps a briefing
of officials in the Department would lead to a better under-
standing of the implications of this policy.” In any case,
there should be explicit guidelines defining the Director's
authority to order such infiltration.

: Recommendation 17 calls for,the destruction of some

| . CIA files, upon the conclusion of thésaurrent congressional

. investigations or as soon thereafter as pgssible. As indi-

cated’ earlier, no files should be destroyed until the Justice i?
Department's investigation is completed.

Recommendation 18 states that the CIA may investigate
individuals affiliated with it, but that such investigations
"must be coordinated with the FBI" when there is evidence
of espionage or violation of .law involved. If the CIA is to
avoid getting into law enforcement investigations, perhaps it
should simply turn all criminal “investigations over to the
Bureau rather than "coordinate" with the FBI or ‘any other i
enforcement agency. This problem of separating law enforcement
from foreign intelligence is a 4ifficult problem. The De-
partment of Justice has the problem under study and will try
to make a more definite statement about it later.

. Recommendation 19 would compel the FBI to accept
* eases involving allegations of security violations "without

regard to whether a favorable prosecutive opinion is issued

by the Justice Department." - This could raise serious
~difficulties. For example, it would. have the effect of

putting the FBI in the uncomfortable position of investigating
‘a matter without reasonable expectation of prosecution.
‘Recommendation 19(a) could be read as requiring the Director

of Central Intelligence to refer all serious or continuing oneal
- security violations to the Security Committee of USIB for

its determination whether ‘the case should be referred to the
-Department. The Director should be able to refer these cases
-directly without resort to an. intermediary. Evers FA
Recommendation 21 supports legislation ‘making ita
“eriminal offense for CIA employees to leak classified infor-
‘mation. In general, the recommendation raises controversial
-issues similar to those raised in connection with some of ’
*the-provisions-in S.1. The Department,,:.of ,course). .will..work
Gwith thée*cehtral Intelligence Agency in n drafting: any necessary
< legislation. a 7 i
“Recommendation 22 suggests that the Director of Central

7 ‘Intelligence should approve in writing certain physical sur-
‘veillance operations, but again it does not provide the
“Director with any clear guidelines as to when and under what

- circumstances approval should be given. It is-not clear to
what extent, if at all, the CIA should undertake physical sur-
veillante operations within the United States, Moreover,- there
‘is the issue of the role of the FBEsin matters such as these.
“The issue is under study by ne Department.

s.
: Recommendation 23 is ‘ambiguous in that it could be read
as meaning that all interceptions of wire or oral comminica-
tions within the United States would require a warrant. Read
another way, the recommendation could bé understood to mean’
that the CIA could’ conduct’ warrantless activities in foreign
intelligence matters either within the U.S. or abroad. It has
been the Administration's position that certain national security
surveillances do not require a warrant. Also, the recommenda-~
tion fails to discuss procedures already agreed to by the Direc-
tor of the Central Intelligence Agency regarding the interception
by hare CIA of wire or oral communications of American citizens .
abroa

Recommendation 28 suggests that equipment for monitor-
ing conversations should not be tested on unsuspecting persons



: living within the United States. Perhaps this recommendation
should also’ apply to unsuspecting American citizens living abroad
“as well.

. ‘Recommendation 30 suggests that the Director of Central
Intelligence and the Director of the FBI should draft a de- .
tailed agreement setting forth each agency's jurisdiction and °*
devising procedures for effective liaison between them. While
it is important that there be cooperation between the CIA and
the FBI, this issue ought not be left solely to an agreement
between the two agencies. At the least, if there is to be an
agreement, representatives of the Attorney General or his De~

* partmental designee ought to be involved in its negotiation

and preparation.

ON,

Reference is made to SSC letter to the Attorney
General dated May 14, 1975, with attached appendices roquesting
certain documents and other information fron the FBI.

Item number 17 in Appendix D requested all memoranda
and other materials reflecting written or oral authorization
and re-avthorization by the Attorney General and/or the
Dixector of the FBI for electronic surveillance of Josoph Kraft.

A review of PBI files, including the unsealed portions
of the FBI file containing assorted memoranda regarding an
electronic surveillance on Joseph Kraft has failed to locate
any written or oral authorization for such clectroni¢e surveil-
ance as requested in the referenced communication,

We have, hovever, Located in the wmsealed portion
o£ the above file certain memoranda which reveal that a Bureau
official, apparently at the direction of the late Director
of tha FBI, J. Edgar Hoover, traveled to a foreign country
vhere at the urging of such Bureau official the security service
‘ e£ that nation placed an electronic surveillance on Joseph Kraft's
hotel xoom for a period of approzimatcly one week in 1969.

1 - The Attorney General

NOTE: ser

See T. J. Smith memorandum to E. S. Miller 6/8/73,
captioned "SPECOV." :

The particulars revealed above regarding coverage of
Kraft while in France during 1969 have been the subject’of ,
detailed testimony by Mr. Kraft 5/10/74 before the United States
Senate Subcommittee on Adminstrative Practices and Procedures,
the Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights of the Committee on the
Judiciary, and the Subcommittee on Surveillance of the Committee
on Foreign Relations. His testimony appears in the printed records
of the above Committees' proceedings and an earlier public dis-
closure of the surveillance concerning Joseph Kraft appeared in the
9/20/73 issue of the New York Times. Mr. Kraft had apparently
learned the particulars of the surveillance through adminstration
leaks. We have deleted the identity of the country involved in
the elsur in an attempt to fulfill the confidential nature of our
relationship with the French security service, the DST, and to
avoid further embarrassment to them. The French actually conducted
the microphone surveillance in question and have previously formally
protested to us concerning media reports and other public dis-
closure which revealed their involvement in the surveillance.

Request. Pertaining to Electronic Surveillance

NOTE CONTINUED : suffer

We have alluded in the memorandum to the SSC to certain memor-
anda found in the Kraft file in an effort to be completely

candid with the Committee since they are obviously aware of

many details of the electronic surv@éillance, Our flat denial

of any memoranda regarding authorization or re-authorization with-
out reference to the Sullivan memoranda would raise more questions
than it answers and flies in the face of the Committee's knowledge |
of the existence of our elsur file on Kraft. For additional insight |
into this matter attached to this note are two memoranda from W. C.
Sullivan to Mr. Hoover which are of the type referred to by us

in the memorandum to the Committee. As a fallback position,
should the Committee rephrase its request and seck to obtain the
assorted memoranda from W. C. Sullivan to Mr. Hoover referred to
above, it is felt we could comply with such request after appro-
priate sanitization of the exchange of correspondence between

W. C. Sullivan and Mr. Hoover. The sanitization would be under-
taken in order to preserve our interests, particularly protection
of the French DST, and to protect the privacy of the only three
individuals who reportedly had knowledge of the electronic sur-
veillance within the Bureau, W. C. Sullivan, former Paris Legat,
Norman Philcox, and the late J. Edgar Hoover. This note has been
classified "Secret" in order to protect the confidentiality of our
relationship with the French security service the disclosure of
which could reasonably be expected to result in serious damage to
national security. Classified by 6283, xeDS 1, Indefinite.

under seal, no official or employee of the Depart-
ment will have access to them for any purpose, and
no official or employee of the Department will
allow any person outside of the Department to have
any such access, except as described below. The
only material referring to these items will be a
singlé index card needed to locate the sealed items.
fhe index card will bear only Mes Krake’ S name and
a file number.

“13. Should some future need which we do not now

As a result of our discussions, I understand that this

Vo without waiver of any legal rights he may have as a result
of prior surveillances. As I advised you, we are working
now on general policy determinations which, we hope, will
offer a permanent solution to the problem this settles temp-
orarily. Of course, under the terms of this agreement we
will notify you of any policy determination which would
involve a modification of this agreement.

Until a final policy is determined, this agreement should
assure Mr. Kraft that no person will read or otherwise use
these documents in“any manner so long as they remain under
the seal arrangement. 5

“—-report, I will set out briefly the basic facts in this nc
relative to my European trip.

First, I am sure you would want to know how very, very
willing and cooperative this high-ranking official was. The
moment I arrived I called for an appointment with him and was
given it immediately. It was obvious he had to work me in before
others scheduled to see him because they were in his outer office
when I went through. He was too gracious, however, to mention it.

Second, I presented directly the request and predicated
it on my reason to believe that this person could be in contact
with the Soviets and it was necessary to determine one way or
the other. Giving it this predication [f thought would make our
position much more valid and secure. He toid me Licey would do
it for us without any hesitation. Parenthetically, I might add
that such a cover is regarded as illegal. However, he made no
mention of this and they do it all the time, He pointed out that
if this man is living at a hotel or an apartment where complicated
switchboards are involved, there would be some technical problems.
I told him that I understood this. He assured me that if it is
technically possible to do it, it would be done and if it required
solving a problem,it would be solved if at all possible. te

Third, as it was necessary..for -this official to have
this man located, the situation analyzed, and the equipment put
in use, I decided not to stay for a day or so to get a sampling
of the product. If it could have been put on immediately, I would,
of course, have stayed around a day to see what it would be like.

Fifth, the material will be sent directly to me without

for the translation here and then get the material to you
immediately in order that you will be able to handle it directly
with the gentleman.to whom you alluded in our conversation.

Sixth, the high-ranking official with whom I deait suggested
that we might want to give consideration at the end of this
operation to listening to the tape with one of his translators
to see if they had overlooked anything significant, which he
said could happen because they know nothing about this person's
background, contacts, etc. He said that if it were possible he
would send the tape over here but this is not possible because
they have an unbreakable rule that the tape can't be taken out of
this clandestine central headquarters where the work is done and
if it were removed; it would cause considerable wonderment and
speculation. However, he said he could safely and securely have
me enter a portion of this area to listen if I thought it necessary.
I told him this was a decision which could be faced after the
product was examined carefully and that then you would make the

This is to advise you that the French
have overcome some very difficult operational
problems and have installed a microphone in this

Appendix B, Part IL, Item number 9, of referenced
letter requested all memoranda and other materials pertaining
to the origins, contents, and implementation of National Security
Action Memorandum 161, dated Junc 9, 1962.

By memorandum dated March 5, 1964, te J. Edgar Hoover,
Chairman, Interdepartmental Intelligence Conference,
the Attorney General, implemented Presidential instructions
contained in National Security Action Memorandum 161. In his
March, 1964, communication to Mr. Hoover, the Attorney General
dixected that the Interdepartmental Intelligence Conference
should continue to function in accordance with principles
governing its operations previously approved by the National

Any information with respect to the origins of National
Security Action Memorandum 161 would logically be in the records
of The White House, and you may desire to consult with The White
House regarding this aspect of your request.

1 - The Attorney General
NOTE:

Although memoranda and other documents have been
prepared in the past in connection with the internal
security programs operated by the FBI pursuant to our legal
authority in this field, National Security Action Memorandum 161
simply transferred supervision of these internal security
programs from the National Security Council to the Attorney General.
These were ongoing programs whose essential character was not
altered by National Security Action Memorandum 161. It appears
that no documents were prepared within the FBI in connection
with its implementation. However, we have previously furnished
to the Committee, with Departmental concurrence, copies of the
Attorney General's memorandum of March 5, 1964, and we are
referring the SSC to this document.

The Honorable Edward H. Levi :

Page Two June 27, 1975

Within the Committee mandate, contained in
S. Res. 21, there are four broad subjects relating to the
intelligence community which we are required to investi-
gate and study in order to determine the facts and ulti-
mately to decide whether to make recommendations for
legislative or other changes. They are:

1. The structure, performance, and utility of
government operations with respect to intel-
Ligence activities.

2. Whether certain policies or practices are
or are not illegal, unethical, or otherwise
improper.

3. Whether there has or has not been excessive
duplication or inadequate coordination be-
tween and among intelligence agencies and,
more generally, the efficiency of intelli-
_ gence activities.

4, Whether there has or has not been adequate
internal and external control and oversight
over the policies and practices of intelli-
gence agencies.

In attempting to find the answers to these funda-
mental questions, the Committee is proceeding in two ways.
First, we are examining intelligence functions broadly as
instruments of government policy, giving attention to the
authority for particular functions, the problems which
intelligence activities are designed to solve, the proce-
dures by which intelligence activities are and have been
proposed, approved, executed, evaluated, and terminated,
the range and scope of the activities utilized to achieve
intelligence objectives, and the propriety and utility of
the activities undertaken. Second, we will examine in
depth certain subjects within the broad topics of inves-
tigaticn. (We would, of course, welcome your suggestion
of other cases that would give added insight into intelli-
gence matters under your jurisdiction.) These specific
subjects for investigation are not intended to limit the
scope contained in the more general questions.

ny



The Honorable Edward H. Levi
Page Three : 7 June 27, 1975

The annexed notifications spell these matters
out in greater detail. In addition, they ask certain
specific questions, set forth certain previously requested
documents not yet received, request additional documents ,*
‘and, in some cases, ask for the names and present addresses
of persons who have held certain positions. Where appro-
priate, the subject's description indicates that, pursuant
to the agreed Outline for Inquiry Procedures, the matter
primarily concerns allegations of abuse or other contro- i
versial specific matters where there is reason to believe
improprieties may have occurred. Finally, the notifications
indicate the name(s) of the staff member(s) who, in addition
toy the Committee's senior staff, will be responsible for the
particular matters. PEE

. the Committee, in the course of the next few
months, will undertake other subjects for investigation
as its work proceeds and will notify you as appropriate.

We look forward to your cooperation in these
tatters. : SO

. Issues

The Committee's inquiry into the intelligence and
counterintelligence activities of the Federal Bureau
of Investigation is examining fundamental issues which
bear directly on the adequacy of current legislation
and administrative organization and procedure. The
Committee seeks to determine whether FBI intelligence
and, counterintelligence activities achieve legitimate
} objectives in conformity with the rule of law. Among
the basic issues to be addressed are the following:

“A. What is the legal authority for FBI intelligence
- and counterintelligence activities? Should the
FBI's authority be clarified or revised or -
. incorporated in a comprehensive statutory
charter?

B. What limitations are placed on FBI intelligence
and counterintelligence activities by the
Constitution and laws of the United States?
Should these limitations be clarified or
revised?

C. What have been the purposes and aims of FBI
intelligence and counterintelligence activities?
Should these ebjéctives be modified? ~

D. How have the intelligence and counterintelligence
activities of the FBI been organized and coordinated
with other agencies of government? Should these
procedures and practices be revised?

E. What have been the procedures for and techniques
of intelligence gathering and dissemination and
counterintelligence operations used by the FBI?
Under what conditions and through what procedures
sfiould these methods and techniques’ be used in
the future?

F. What have been and should.be the mechanisms for
internal and external policy-making, control,
and supervision of FBI intelligence and counter-
intelligence activities?

As a means of examining the above issues in the
e€ontext of actual FBI intelligence operations,

the Committee intends to study certain specific
topics, some of which are general in nature, and
others of which involve specific cases, programs

or techniques. Part II, below, contains descriptions
of the general areas into which the Committee: intends
to inquire. Part III contains descriptions: of the
specific cases mentioned above. The descriptions
specifically indicate whether the investigation may
concentrate on specific allegations of possible
abuses or other controversial matters where there
is.reason to believe improprieties may have occurred.
In dddition to the topics described below, additional
areas. of inquiry may develop during the course of the
Committee's work.

.Legal Authority. for FBI Intelligence and Counter-
intelligence Activities

The Committee is examining the legal basis for FBI
intelligence and counterintelligence activities.
There may be serious question as to the adequacy
of the present legislative framework for the FBI's
functions in these fields. Current statutes
authorize the FBI to perform investigative and law
enforcement functions, but they do not specifically
authorize intelligence or counterintelligence
‘activities. Therefore, the Committee seeks to
determine whether the FBI's authority should be
elarified, revised, or incorporated in a compre-
hensive statutory charter. i

Organization and Operation of the FBI Intelli-
gence Division ~

The Committee is investigating the structure and
operating practices of the FBI Intelligence Divi-
sion. Proposals have been made that the national
security intelligence and counterintelligence
functions of the FBI should be lodged in a separate
agency or otherwise separated from the FBI's
eriminal investigative activities. Further recom-
mendations have been advanced for improved coordina-—~
tion between the FBI and other intelligence agencies,
‘for strengthened supervision of FBI intelligence and
counterintelligence activities by the Attorney
General or an independent board, and for clearer
standards and procedures for FBI activities in this
area. Therefore, the Committee desires complete
information on the operating practices and proce-
dures of the FBI Intelligence Division and of the
field office activities supervised by the Intelli-
gence Division. i

NW 65360 Docld:32989615 Page 88



‘, The Committee's inquiry focuses on the following
specific areas:

1. FBI Internal Security Intelligence Operations

The Committee seeks to determine the nature
and purpose of FBI intelligence operations
directed at foreign intelligence activities
and subversive or extremist activities within
the United States. It has been alleged that
7 the scope of FBI intelligence investigations
- is too broad and has extended to legitimate ¢
; political activities.. Consequently, the Com-
vo mittee must examine how the FBI's responsibili-
ties have been defined.
.” Responsible staff: Senior staff
7 Task Force leader
Mark Gitenstein

2. The FBI and the U. S. Intelligence Community

The Committee seeks to determine what have
been the policies and procedures for coordina-
tion between the FBI and other agencies in the
—U. S. intelligence community. There have been
occasions in the past where friction between
the FBI and other agencies has produced serious
dissatisfaction-.within the U. S. intelligence
community. The purpose of this inquiry is to
evaluate the adequacy of past and present co-
_ ordinating mechanisms.

FBI Foreign Counterintelligence Operations

The Committee seeks to determine the nature of
FBI counterintelligence operations directed at
foreign intelligence activities within the
United States or at any other hostile foreign-
related activities within the United States.
Since FBI operations to "counter" these activi-
ties go beyond intelligence collection, the
Committee must consider whether such practices
require statutory authorization. The impact
of counterintelligence operations on United

“States foreign relations will also be considered..

Inspection Division Investigations

The Committee is examining the relationship

of the FBI Inspection Division to FBI intelli-
gence and counterintelligence activities. This
includes both regular Inspection.Division
reviews of Intelligence Division and field
office functions and specific investigations
of allegations of improper conduct in connec—
tion.with FBI intelligence activities.

FBI Intelligence Activities and State or Local
Law Enforcement Agencies :

The Committee seeks to determine the nature of
the relationships between FBI intelligence

. activities and state and local law enforcement

agencies. This subject involves the delicate
balance between the necessary centralization
of certain law enforcement activities and the
Constitutionally-mandated decentralization of
general law enforcement responsibility. It is
necessary for the Committee to evaluate the
centralizing influence of the FBI, as well as
the FBI's role as a check on local law enforce-
ment abuses. ; 7

ase Studies
General Questions

The descriptions which follow of the specific cases the
Committee intends to study are.intended to serve the

dual purpose of notifying the FBI of the issues the
Committee will explore in connection with each case

and eliciting from the FBI all information and material
in: its possession relating to the questions the Committee
wishes to explore in each case. In order to avoid
unnecessary repetition of certain questions which will .
be basic to.the Committee's investigations of each

ease, certain fundamental questions are set forth Hat
below. As-to each case described, the Committee

intends to explore these fundamental.questions, and
expects that the FBI will, as to each case, provide

all information and material it has relating to these
basic questions even though they are not repeated in

the discussion.of each particular area.

1. What is or has been the legal authority for the
activity? a

.2. What have been the purposes of the activity?
3. What techniques have been employed in the activity?

4. What kinds of information have been” gathered in
' the activity?

5. How have specific uses of the activity been initiated
and approved?

6. How have the targets for the activity been selected?
7- What have been the criteria for target selection?

8. How has the intelligence which is collected been
used?

9. To whom has the intelligence collected been dis—
seminated? i

10. What has been the basis for any dissemination with
respect to each recipient?

11. How has the activity been coordinated with other
intelligence agencies?

12. What have been the effects of this coordination?

13. To what extent has each of the foregoing been. com-

i patible with the legal authority-for and the purposes
of the activity?

14. By what means has the activity been monitored,
controlled and administered?

15. What are the potential abuses to which the activity
. may lead?

16. To what abuses has the activity led?
17. What steps have been taken to investigate such
i abuses?

"18. What steps have been taken to avoid such abuses?

| 19. What have been the costs and utility of the
: activity? .

In some instances, the specific questions set forth

i below may appear to -repeat some of the general questions.
" The purpose in such cases is simply to clarify the appli-
eation of. the general question to the specific case.
Except where inapplicable by their terms, all general
questions relate to each specific case.

A. Electronic Surveillance

The Committee is examining all forms of electronic
interception of communications including wiretap-
ping, electronic eavesdropping, consensual elec-
tronic surveillance interception of video and data
communications, local monitoring devices, and all
other forms of electronic or technical monitoring.
The Committee's general questions apply to each of
* the techniques listed above, as well as to the
matters set forth in the following specific cases.

“1. Warrantless Electronic Surveillance

: The Committee seeks to determine whether the
. Attorney General should have-the authority
to authorize electronic surveillance for cer-

nN tain purposes without a prior judicial warrant.

‘ This power has been exercised by succeeding
Attorneys General since 1940, upon the explicit
directive of the President. The Supreme Court

F. Clandestine Informant Activities

‘The Committee is examining all aspects of the
FBI's use of informants, sources, and undercover
personnel and the techniques employed by such per-
sons. _ Although informants are the single most
productive source of intelligence information, the
difficulties of controlling their activities may
increase the possibility of improper conduct. The
use of informants to infiltrate organizations also
may pose dangers to the right of associational pri-
vacy. Consequently, proposals have been made for
«the imposition of a judicial warrant requirement
bl or other safeguards for the use of informants.
The Committee seeks to evaluate such proposals as
well as the contributions of informants to the
. accomplishment of legitimate objectives.

4

5 In addition, the Committee is examining informant
&ctivities with respect to several particular situa-
tions and cases. This investigation may involve
specific allegations of abuse or controversial
matters where there is reason to believe improprie-
ties may have occurred. The Committee's inquiry
_covers the general circumstances surrounding the
following incidents or cases:

a. Wounded Knee;
b. Kent State;
c.- New York v. Stroble (Attica);

d. United States v. Buckalew (Gainesville);

e. United States v. Briggs (Camden);

f. New York v. Dillon (Hobart College);

g. United States v. Marshall (Seattle).

Additional cases may also be examined.
In addition to the above cases, the Committee is
‘examining the role of FBI informants in providing

information to the FBI concerning members of the
following organizations:

The Honorable Edward H.yLevi

Attorney General 2197

U. S. Department of Justice

Washington, D. C. 20530 ne

Dear Mr. Attorney General: : : f

i Enclosed with this letter aren

concerning certain matters currently under

by the Select Committee which relate to government enci
under your jurisdiction.

These notifications are submiited pursuant to
an agreement between the Committee, the various inte
gence entities, and the White House. c. t
agreement, the various entities in the
have agreed not only to make available the pertinent
witnesses, but also to submit in response all info
and material which they possess that is relevant to
areas and cases which the Committee wiskes to investigate.
The response should include all relevant underlying docu-
mentation and other information, including documents
which may not have come to the Committes's attention and
which the Committee has not specifically requested
all material relating to any prior Executive braneh
into the matter. In addition, we would welcome a
ed by the
tee and any other observations on the subject chat
believe-ewould be helpful.

disclosure that underlies that agreeme
filling the full disclosure policy contained in the
ment is indispensible to mi
the formulation of our ultimate pe
recommendations.



The Honorable Edward H. Levi :
Page mo dune 27, 1975

Within the Committee mandate, contained in
S. Res. 21, there are four broad subjects relating tc she
intelligence community which we are required to investi-
gate and study in order to determine tne facts and ulti-
mately to decide whether to make recommendations for
legiskative or other-changes. . They are:

i. The structure, performance, and utility of
government operations with respect to intel-
Ligence agtivities.

2. Whether certain policies or practices are
ee or are not illegal, unethical, or otherwise
improper.

3. Whether ‘there has or has not been excessive
duplication or inadequate coordination be-
tween and among intelligence agencies and,
more generally, the efficiency of intelli-
gence activities.

4, Whether there has or has not been adequate
internal and external control and oversight
over the policies and practices of intelli-
gence agencies.

In attempting to find the answers to these funda-
mental questions, the Committee is proceeding in two ways.
First, we are examining intelligence functions broadly as
instruments of government policy, giving attention to the
authority for particular functions, the problems which
intelligence activities are designed to solve, the proce-
dures by which intelligence activities are and have been
proposed, approved, executed, evaluated, and terminated,
the range and scope of the activities utilized to achieve
intelligence objectives, and the propriety and utility of
the activities undertaken. Second, we will examine in
depth certain subjects within the broad topics of inves-
tigaticn. (We would, of course, welcome your suggesti
of other cases that would give added insight into intelii-
gence matters under your. jurisdiction.) These specific
subjects for investigation are not intended to limit the
scope contained in the more general questions.



pod

The Honorable Edward H. Levi
Page Three June 27, 1675

The annexed notifications spell these matters
out in greater detail. in addition, they ask certain.
specific questions, set forth certain previously requested
documents not yet received, request additional documents ,*
and, in some cases, ask for the names and present addresses
of persons who have held certain positions. Where appro-

-priate, the subject's description indicates that, pursuant

to the agreed Outline for Inquiry Procedures, the matter
primarily concerns allegations of abuse or other contro-
versial specific matters:where there is reason to believe
improprieties may have dgcurred. Finally, the notifications
indicate the name(s) of the staff member(s) who, in addition
to the Committee's senior staff, iontar be responsible for the
particular matters.

‘The Committee, in the course of the next few
months, will undertake other subjects for investigation
as its work proceeds and will notify you as appropriate.

We look forward to your cooperation in these
matters.

to limit the agreement to come forward with all rele-
vant information and material, including documents, whether
or not they have been brought to the Committee's attention
or have been specifically requested by the Committee.

(INCLUDING DEPALS4ENT OF JUSVICE)

I. Issues
The Committee's inguiry into the intelligence and
counterintelligence activities of the Federal Bureau
of Investigation Is examining fundamental issues which
bear directly on the adequacy of current legislation
and adininistrative organ tion and procedure. ‘The
Committee seeks to determine whether FBI intelligence
and counterintelligence activities achieve legitimate
a objectives in conformity with the rule of law. Among
the basic issues to be addressed are the following:

“AL What is the legal authority for FBI intelligence
- and counterintelligence activities? Should the
FBI's authority be clarified or revised or
Pd incorporated in a comprehensive statutory
charter? v

B. hat limitations are placed on FBI intelligence
and counterintelligence activities by the
Constitution and laws of the United States?
Should these limitations be clarified or
revised?

C. What have been the purposes and aims of FBI
intelligence and counterintelligence activities?
Should these cbjéctives be modified?~

D. How have the intelligence and counterintelligence
activities of the FBI been organized and coordinated
with other agencies of government? Should these
procedures and practices be revised?

E. What have been the procedures for and techniques
of intelligence gathering and dissemination and
counterintelligence operations used by the FBI?
Under what conditions and through what procedures
should these methods and techniques‘be used in
the future?

F. What have been and should.be the mechanisms for
internal and external policy-making, control,
and supervision of FBI intelligence and counter-
Antelligence activities?

Areas of General Inquiry

A. Legal Authority. for FBI Intelligence and Counter~
intelligence Activities

The Committee ‘hs examining the legal Shetede for FBI
intelligence and counterintell
There may be serious question as to the aad
of the present legislative framework for the FséI's
functions in these fields. Current statutes

s authorize the FBI to perform investigative and lew
enforcement functions, but they do not specifically
authorize intelligence or counterintelligence
‘activities. Therefore; the Committee seeks to
determine whether the FBI's authority should be
clarified, revised, or incorporated in a compre-
hensive statutory charter.

Responsible, staff: Senior ‘staff
e : Task Force leader
Mark Gitenstein

B. Organization and Operation of the FBI Intelli-
gence Division

“The Committee is investigating the structure and
operating practices of the FBI Intelligence Divi-
sion. Proposals have been made that the national
security intelligence and counterintelligence
functions of the FBI should be lodged in a separate
agency or otherwise separated from the FBI's
eriminal investigative activities. Further recom-
mendations have been advanced for improved coordina-
tion between the FBI and other intelligence agencies,
for strengthened supervision of FBI intelligence and
counterintelligence activities by the Attorney
General or an independent board, and for clearer
standards and procedures for FBI activities in this
area. Therefore, the Committee desires complete
information on the operating practices and proce-
dures of the FBI Intelligence Division and of the
field office activities supervised by the Intelli-
gence Division.

occasions in the past where friction between
the FBI and other agencies has produced serious
dissatisfaction within the U. S. intelligence
community. The purpose of this inquiry is to
evaluate the adequacy of past and present cc-
