We Discover Lee OSWALD in Mexico City

CIA aid produce one very significant piece of information on Lee
OSWALD before he shot President Kennedy. On 1 October 1963, our Mexico
City Station intercepted a telephone call Lee OSWALD made from someplace
dn Mexico City te the Soviet Eubassy there, using his om raze. Speaking
broken Russian ana using his true name, CSWALD vas talking to the Bubassy
guard, comment, who often answers the phone. OSWALD said he haa me
the a previous Saturday (23 September 1963) and spoken toa
consul waose name he had forgotten, and who had prouised to send a tele-
grea for him to Washington. He vanted to know if there vere ee

14-00000

is highly secret and not known to Mexican security and lav enforcement
officials, who have their om center. Our joint center produces great
masses of telephone intercepts which are transcribed and reviewed by our
soall staff in Mexico City. By 9 October, the OSHALD telephone conversa-
Sion ef 1 October bad been transcribed and a summary of it cabled to
Washington. The name Lee CSHALD meant nothing special to our Mexico
City Station, but in their report they did Judge bin to be on American
rales

The cabled report was received in Washington on 9 October and poe :

in our Files, where it was immediately noted that the Lee OSWALD phoning

the Soviet Exbassy in Mexico City was probably the Lee OSWALD who hea

defected to the Soviet Union in 1959 and returned to the USA in 1962. On
10 Octover 1963, the day after the report from Mexico City, CIA Headquarters
gent out a cabled report about Lee OSYALD’s phona call to the Soviet

” ;
Embassy; the report went to the Fal, the Departuent of State (because

OSWALD was 9 US citizen), and to the Navy Department (because he ves 8

former Marine.) ‘The cabled report to these agencies hishlighted the



14-00000

Liklihooa that the Lee OSWALD mentioned was probably the former defector.
A copy of this seme cable was delivered by hand to the Iniisration and
Haturalization Service, with which we have no cable Link. The suse day

a long cable went out to Mexico City informing our Station of the back=
ground of defector Lee OSWALD end asking for more information. Our Station
vas instructed to pass its inforsetion on the phone call to the Mexico
City offices of the FAI, the Enbassy, the Naval Attache, and the Imigra-
tioa en Raturalization Servis. ‘This was done.

In its original report of 9 October, Mexico City hed sata it had a

photograpa of an apparent Anericen wale leaving the Soviet Embassy on

1 October 1963, the day OSWALD phone there. A very sensitive operation

in Mexico eae ns with seeretly taken photographs of many but rot
all visitors to the Soviet Eubassy there, teken with teleshote lenses.
Accordingly, we cabled the Ravy Department oa 2h Ca 1963 asking for
IR Sap eC oe ric
photos. We haa not received this photograph by 22 norecter 1963, but in

any event, 1t turnea out that the man photographed outside the Soviet



14-00000

Eubasay was not CS¥ALD anyway. As chance would bave it, none of our

several photo obsezgtion points in Mexico City had ever texen en identi

fable picture of Lee OSWALD.

Qur Hexico City Station very often produces information likes this
on US citizens contacting Soviet bloc enbassies in Mexico City. Frequently
the information ve get is extremely incriminating, and on one or two
occasions we have even been able to apprehend and return to the USA
American military persennel who are attempting to defect. In all such
cases, our Eexdquarters desk requests ani obtains the special permission of.

the Deputy Director for Plans to pass the derogatory information on a US

“citizen to other yovernzent agencies. Derozatory information on Americans

is not treated routinely; in each case the DDP or his Assistant persorally
scrutinize the infomation, maxe sure it is credible, and decide vhether ond
to whom it will be passed. ox in absolute emergencies is the i City
, Ec 5
Station authorized to pasa such information directly to the FBE office in

the U.8. Exbassy.

At this writing (13 Decenber 1963) ve do not know what actioa the FBI



14-00000

and other agencies may have taken based on our report. We surmise that the
DI may have made local checks through Mexican authorities to see if
Lee OSWALD was actually in Mexico City on 1 October. Indeed, later in-
vestigation has confirmed all the details of his trip, where he stayed,
end what he did. To avola crossing lines with the FBI, our Mexico Station
ungertook no local investigation of its om. As we now know, OSWALD left
Mexico on 3 October and was no longer there when our report was put out. .
- Since this telephone tap operation 18 @ joint one with the Mextean
Presidency, the Mecticans also had the 1 October intercept on Lee OSWALD, ©

but it apparently slumberea in their files until the assassination took

_"plase.

22 Hoverber 1963
When word of the shooting of President Kennedy reached the offices

of our operating divisions ana staffs on the afternoon of Friday 22 Hoven-

,
ver 1963, transistor radios were turned on everywhere to follow the

tragedy. When the rame of Lee OSWALD was heard, the effect was electric.

A phone meseage from the FAI came at about the sane tine, naming OSWALD



14-00000

as the possible assassin and asking for traces. ‘The nessage vas passed
on at once by the Caief CI, Mr. Angleton, to Nr. Birch O'tleal of his
Special Investigations Unit. ors. Eetty Egeter of this Unit imediotely
recognized the nate of Lee CSVALD and went for hia file. At the sone
tine, lis. Bustos of the Mexico Desk, who had written our first feport on
OSSIALD om 10 October recomnised the nase froa radio reyorts and vent
after the sane file. Dir, Reichhanit, Hexteo Desk Chief, who vas hove on
leave, heara the news ani phoned in o reminder that we had something on
CSHALD, While we vere preparing a cable to Mexico City asking thea for
nore information on OSALD, Yercice City itsol? heard OSWALD's nome on the
Yotce of Aserica bronicast and cabled to us 9 rendoder of the information

week, 27 cablea reparte had gone.out to the White House, the State Depart-

rent, and the FEI. Many cables of guidance and inquiry hea been sent to

14-00000

our overseas stations, and many pleces 5 information on OSWALD ana his
wife had been received back. ‘The Mexico City Station researched lis
telephone taps very thoroughly and came up with several more conversations
probably involving OSWALD, but not actually mentioning this names these
connected him also to the Cuban Consulate in Mexico City. Heveral, Mexicans
were arrested and questioned about his activities, giving a good pieturs
of what he was really up to. Many conferences were held with the Far
Liaison officer vho asked us for certain sections and passed us information
from the Fat suvestigation. Om. the minus side, a host of faintestors,
ome snonymous, boabarded overseas cnbassies vith spudous tips on the case,
most of which ve Investigated. All of these are soon discredited, but they
are atill caaing in.

During this phase of our work, we served prinarily in support of the
FSI, which was entrusted by the President with the rajor responsibility for

7 . st

the investigation. The FBI was too busy to supply us with much of its

om inforcation, but answers were given to specific questions we posed to

essist our investigation. The Department of State did photograph its entire



14-00000

file on OSNALD end pass them to us, end the FBT gave us a copy of the
Soviet Consular file on OSWALD which had been publicly siven by the Soviet
Ambassador to the Secretary of State. On Friday 6 December 1963, Deputy
Attorney General Katzenbach invited us to review the FAI's comprehensive
report on the case to make sure our sources vere not jeopardized and that
our information vas correctly quoted. We found the report highly
Intereating end no threat to our security, as long as it vas read only
by the outhérized Investisative bodies.

After the first fev days, the CJA investigation of the case was

handled at Eosdquarters by a small staff usually charged with dnvestization

’ pnd analysis of the most important security cases, and by a few officers

end analysts of eee Fentaphere Division.

As soon as cur Mexico City Station realized that Lee OSWALD vas the
prize suspect, it beyan re-vereening ell. the written telephone transeripte
in its files covering the Soviet Rubassy for the pertinent period. ‘the

actual tapes were also reviewed, but many of them haa been erased after the

discovered and their contents cabled to Washington, where they vere
@issemizated to the White House, the State Departrent, the Federal
Bureau of Investigation.
OSWALD's name was not actually mentioned in these additional calls,

Silvis DURAY maya that she will note thia on his “cara,” and the Soviet

Consnlate in Vashington about their requests Zor permission to return to

about this as late as 9 Hovenber 1963.

Silvia DURAN vas arrested again on 27 Hoveaber ana hela until 29
Hovenber. She tola essentially the same story over asain.

Yell-placea sources within the Cuban Embassy in Hexico City stated
that vben Silvia DURAN vas released fron police arrest the first tine on
25 Novenber; she was quite pleased with herself. She told ber colleagues
the sane story set out above, afding only that the Mextean police had

OSHALD, ‘Te reeetion vithia the Cuban Eubasey to the neva of President
Kennday's death was sonbre. To ante, there Js no}{ credible infornatisn in
CIA files vhick youla appear to link Lee OSWALD with the Cuban goverment
or the Cutan intelligence service.

The vbole question of whether Les OSWALD haa any secret connection
with the Soviets or Cubans in Mexico cannot pet be ansvered, but certain

parts of the evidence inilcate to the contrary. Silvia DURAW and the



14-00000

Soviet Consular officials spoke of him es @ man with “no friends in Cuba”
on the one kana, spd es & man not "known in the Soviet Esbassy, on the
other. The very openness of his visits and the phoue calls spenk against any
secret role. His trip to Mexico was not itself a secret nets he traveled
under his real nase or a close variant of it, livea openly in Mexican
hotels, and corresponded with the Soviets through the open mall% about

At when ba got back to the US, its trip to Mextce saa apparently made
necessary because it was the nearest Cuban dipleoatic installation where

he coula apply for a visa.

A perplexing aspect of CSHALD's trafficicing with the Cubans and
Soviets in Mexico City is his assertion in his call of 23 September that he
id not know hi sdd@ress when he vas at the Soviet Consulate and cane to
the Cuban Consulate because they ked it. It 4a hard to explain just vat
he meant, but 4t shoulé be renesbered that he was teluing in Russian,
language he could not zanaje, and that when he came to Mexico he was in the
process of moving from Hew Orleans to Texs. He way not have meaorized

hin new edé@ress in Texas, whatever it wes, and may not have been able to



14-00000

lay hands oa 1 when he vas dn the Soviet Consulate that asy. Perkaps
be hea earlier given the addresa to Silvia DUSAN and wanted to lock it
up on ber card.

A particularly sinister aspect of cous dealings cae the Soviets
in Mextee Clty arises fron the Likithood that he set vita Soviet Consul
Yoleriy Viadinirovich KOSTINOY, In his 1 October phone call. to the
Soviet Bubassy, the guard ODYEDNOY suggests that the Consul. CSYALD haa
talked to was KOBTIOOY if he wns dark. OSWALD seems to agree with this,
‘but tha identification 1s very casual. In his 9 Noveubsr letter to the
Soviet Consulate in Washington, OSWALD gives the nane of the man he’ dealt
with as "KOSTIN," but there is no person of that exact nase in the Soviet
Exbessy in Kexico City. KOSTIMOY is accredited as e Consular Attache and
does ectually do a lot of consular york, but be ts believed to be a
Boviet KGB officer, and it is believed that he works for Department 13 of

¥ . .
the KGB, the Departzent charged with sabotaze and assassinations. ‘the

suspicion that KOSTIXOY to a KGB officer arose from hic work habits, and

his nasociation with other KGB officers. It was hardened when it vas



14-00000

found that he handled a Soviet agent who vas trained to do sabotace
work and that he turned this agent over to another KC3 officer who is
aefinitely known to work for the 13th Department. It is senerally true
ia KGB work that sabotage agents are handled only ty 1] "Department
officers.

Eubassy guard Ivan Ivanovich OHSDKOY in hinself believed to be a
KGB pan fron previous assignments as a bodyzuara and sureiliant. But
unless some direct evidence of Soviet complicity ts discovered, it is
most likely that OSWALD's dealing vith KGB ren OBYSDKOY and KOSTIOY was
nothing more than # gris coincidence, a coincidence dus in part to the
Soviet habit of plociag intelligence wen in the Exbassies tn positions
vhere they receive a large portion of the visitors ana phone calls, AIL
of the five consnlar officers in the Seviet masses are|eeee fertenerces
intelligence officers. Certainly if OSWALD bad been a Soviet egent in

: .

training for an assassination asslument or even for sabotage work, the
Soviets would have estopped him fron making open visits and phone calls to

the Eoviet Eubassy In Mexico after he tried it a couple of tines. Our



14-00000

experience in Mexico, studying the Soviet intelligence service at close

range, indicates that they do make sove mistakes and are sovetimes lnsecure —

in their methods, but that they do not persist in such glering errors.

fone insight on the Cuban attitude tevard the arrest of Silvia DURAS

and the involvesent of the Cuban Consulate in the OSWALD case can be
gained frou two intercepted phone calls ease betveen Cuban President
Osvaldo DORFICOS ana Coben Anbassador to Mexico Joaquin HERUATUSZ Armas oa
