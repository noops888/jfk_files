killing~of RENE NUNEZ and ANGELO.GIGLIO but not held, and that

he was questioned again in January, 1953, when he was grazed

in the shoulder by one of three shotgun blasts aimed his way

at close range while he was driving a car in Tampa. The same
article recited that he refused to take a lie detector test

when questioned at the police. station following his being picked
