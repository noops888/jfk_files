B. GAMBLING - IN FLORIDA

The "Tampa Morning Tribune", Tampa, Florida, dated January 8,

1958, carried the information in an article that SANTO TRAFFI-

CANTE, JR. "played

a sinister role as 'kingpin' of a Florida

West coast syndicate...".

"His outfit appeared to rake in a

'gross of more than a million a year' from bolita racketeering,

RALPH W. MILLS, former director of the Hillsborough Crime'

Commission, declared in a 1952 speech".

The article recited

the subject inherited his influence in

the underworld from his

father; that subject was one of a list of witnesses for the

KEFAUVER Committee Hearings in Tampa, Florida, in 1950, but

he never appeared before the Committee; that he was questioned

by sheriff's deputies during an investigation of the double

killing Of RENE NUNEZ and ANGELO GIGLIO but not held, and that

he was questioned again in January, 1953, when he was grazed

in the shoulder by one of three shotgun blasts aimed his way

at close range while he was driving a car in Tampa.

article recited that he refused to take a lie detector test

when questioned at the police station following his being picked

up for questioning in the murder of JOE ANTINORI in November, 1953.

The same article set out that on May 15, 1954, the subject and

his brother, HENRY, were charged with bribing a St. Petersburg,

Florida, detective to carry on bolita operations in Pinellas

County,

Florida.

Records of T-19 reflected

Florida, back in the 1920's, was

connected with the vice rackets

with the IGNAZIO ANTINORI family of Tampa and that SANTO, JR.,

figure in the underworld who with other relatives were powerful

in the illegal narcotics traffic in the Tampa area and prominent

in gambling in Tampa and Havana. He reported subject had been

in ANASTASIA's company frequently in the past six months in

New York and noted that ANASTASIA was known to the police in

New York as the lord-high-executioner of Murder, Inc., and

together with TRAFFICANTE was a leader in the "Mafia.'

T-14 reported a release by a Hilton International

representative mentioned that "a preliminary agreement for the

casino lease had been made with a group headed by ROBERTO MENDOZA,

a Cuban businessman, and CLIFFORD JONES, a Las Vegas attorney."

Newspaper releases

indicated that MENDOZA was a close friend of

Cuban President FULGENCIO BATISTA.

These news reports further

indicate that associated with ROBERTO MENDOZA are CLIFFORD JONES,

MENDOZA's brother, MARIO MENDOZA, Senator KENNETH JOHNSON of

Las Vegas, and a New York attorney SIDNEY ORSECK.

T-14 reported that Mr. JOHN W. HOUSER of the Hilton

Hotel International was told by attorney ORSECK that ROBERTO

MENDOZA had been in touch with JOSEPH RIVERS,

wa., JOSEPH

SILESI, who had made an approach on behalf of another group on

september 17, 1957, by LOUIS SANTOS, Wa., SANTO TRAFFICANTE,

operator of the gambling casino at the Sans Souci:

T-14 reported

that it appeared possible that RIVERS

was in fact, "the front" mentioned in the note believed from

SANTO TRAFFICANTE tO ALBERT ANASTASIA.

VII. PERSONAL HABITS AND PECULIARITIES

T-1 advised that he has known subject to be armed.

in the past and subject has used JAMES COSTA LONGO as a body-

guard in the past. In view of this information, together with

subject's history in Tampa rackets for the past

years, he should

be considered possibly armed and dangerous.

T-27 advised subject wears horn rimmed glasses and

obtained seven pairs of these glasses in Tampa, Florida, in the

Summer of 1957.

"Life" magazine issuedof March 10, 1958,

described subject as a "bespectacled, scholarly looking, as if

he might be around Havana to complete a Ph.D. in Sociology."

T-14 described subject as always wearing glasses

mobster flare for the sensational, and that his dress could be

described as conservative collegiate with a preference for grays

and browns.
