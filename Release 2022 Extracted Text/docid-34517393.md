since that time. ROMERO is from Candelaria, Pinar del Rio-
Province, Cuba, and is married to HILDA, last name unknown,

trips to Cuba by ROMERO over the past few years. It is the
source's understanding that one of the conditions of ROMERO's
parole is that he not again attempt to travel to Cuba by
boat.

The source had planned a clandestine boat trip to
Cuba in November, 1967, in order to attempt to rescue a
friend of his in hiding in Havana. This friend is JOSE LUIS
FORNELL-JACINTO, also known. as “PIQUILI", a Cuban refugee who
had been-intercepted by the Cubams during a clandestine trip
to Guba and who has been in hiding since early 1967. The
source was unsuccessful in his attempt to rescue FORNELL.

About the middle of November, 1967, at around 2 AM
in the morning ROMERO came to the home of the source and
advised that he had recently received a letter from Cuba which
was sent by diplomatic pouch to the "Czechoslovakian Embassy
in New York" (source noted he was probably referring to the
Czechoslovakian mission to the United Nations) ™ This letter
was in answer to a previous letter from ROMERO to the Cuban
government, ROMERO showed the source a typewritten, ome page
letter which instructed him to determine and report upon the
activities of the following:

1. MANUEL ARTIME and the Nicaraguan problem.

2. RAMON FONT, who has explosives of Comandos L
(anti-CASTRO organization in Miami). -

3. FELIX PELAEZ, manager of the 7-11 food store
at corner of Northwest.27th Avenue and 17th Street, Miami.

According to the source the letter also contaimed
an instruction in the lat paragraph to call the writer at a
certain time, time not recalled by the source. The source
said, however, this time was written in military style, for
example 1330, and the source could not recall if a day or
date was mentioned. The letter was unsigned, as best as the
source could recall,

Re; EPIFANIO ROMERO DELGADO

The source stated that EPIFANIO explained that the
letter had been sent to him from a Cuban in New York through
whom he had made contact with the Cuban government. He
said he had been instructed by this person to form a clandestine
group of five persons, composed of himself, the source,

ALFREDO BORGES GALINDO, JOSE BENITO CLARK SANCHEZ and JOSE
LUIS FORNELL-JACINTO. Although the last named individual
is in Cuba he is to be taken into the group ‘tipon his return
to Miami. (U)

According to the plan as outlined by ROMERO to the
source, ROMERO would make a trip to Cuba where he would be
furnished certain documents from ranking officials in the
Cuban government indicating their dissatisfaction with the
Cuban government and a willingness to cooperate with the
United States. With these documents in hand ROMERO would
return to the United States and attempt to interest Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) in this information. (Ui

According to the source ROMERO did not state that
he would attempt to interest CIA in conducting an infiltration
effort into Cuba in which the participants would be arrested,
but only indicated that he would attempt to interest CIA in
the possible defection of some important Cuban government
officials based on the documents furnished to him for this
purpose, (\))

According to the source ROMERO stated he hoped to
be paid by both the Cuban and United States governments ae
the same time and to thus solve his financial problems. (U)

According to the source ROMERO stated he had already
discussed this plan with JOSE BENITO CLARK SANCHEZ and although
he did not mention having talked with ADOLFO BORGES, the source
assumed he had also discussed details of the, plan with BORGES
since they are extremely close friends and reside together. (U)

The source stated that ROMERO requested that he take (Uw)

him, ROMERO, with source to Cuba on his next trip in order
that he could obtain these documents and initiate this plan.
Although the source agreed to do so, he subsequently left
for Cuba within a few days without ROMERO and returned to
Miami in mid December, 1967. During a later contact with
ROMERO the source explained to him that he had not taken him
because ROMERO was on parole and the source feared he might
get into trouble with the authorities. (u\

The source further advised that in general con-
versation with one MANUEL CHAMISO, 435 Southwest 4th Street,
Miami, supervisor at the doll factory where ROMERO recently
worked, he had determined that ROMERO had made two trips to
New York City in November and December, 1967. According to
CHAMISO, ROMERO had said he was making these trips in an
effort to obtain a boat, to travel to Cuba.

The source stated he was of the opinion that ROMERO
holds no loyalty to the Cuban government and is not a Communist,
but is strictly an opportunist who would do anything for
money.

On January 8, 1967, STEPHEN CSUKAS, Enforcement Agent,
United States Customs Service, Miami, advised that EPIFANIO
ROMERO DELGADO was involved in a shooting incident with the
United States Customs near Key Biscayne, Florida, on February
23, 1967, involving two boats with identification numbers
FD 3340F and FL 1462AE. According to: CSUKAS, ROMERO was sub-
sequently found guilty in United States District Court,
Miami, for Assault Upon A Federal Officer and on May 5, 1967,
was sent&nced to fifteen months in prison. He was subsequently
released on parole after having served three months of this
sentence.

CSUKAS advised that a source close to ROMERO had
stated on January 7, 1967, that ROMERO had been in telephonic
contact in December, 1967, with someone at New York City, tele-
