since that time. ROMERO is from Candelaria, Pinar del Rio

Province, Cuba, and is married to HIldA, ast name unknown,

who still resides in Cuba.

The source described EPIFANIO

trips to Cuba by ROMERO over the past few years. It is the

source's understanding that one of the conditions of ROMERO's

parole is that he not again attempt to travel to Cuba by

boat.

The source had planned a clandestine boat trip to

Cuba In November, 196%, in order to attempt to rescue a

friend of his in hiding in Havana. This friend is JOSE LUIS

FORNELL-JACINTO, also known as "PIQUILI"

• & Cuban refugee who

had been intercepted by the Cubans during a clandestine trip

to Cuba and who has been in hiding since early 196%. The

source was unsuccessful in his attempt to rescue FORNELL.

About the middle of November, 1967, at around 2 AM

in the morning ROMERO came to the home of the source and

advised that he had recently received a letter from Cuba which

was sent by diplomatic pouch to the "Crechoslovakian Embassy

In New York" (source noted he was probably referring to the

Czechoslovakian mission to the United Nations)! This letter

was in answer to a previous letter from ROMERO to the Cuban

government. ROMERO showed the source a typewritten, one page

letter which instructed him to determine and report upon the

activities of the following:

1. MANUEL ARTIME and the Nicaraguan problem.

2. RAMON FONT, who has explosives of Comandos I

(anti CASTRO organization in Miami).

3. FELIX PELAEZ, manager of the foll food store

at corner of Northwest 27th Avenue and 17th Street, Miami.

According to the source the letter also contained

an instruction in the last paragraph to call the writer at a

certain time, time not recalled by the source. The source

said, however, this time was written in military style, for

example 1330, and the source could not recall if a day

date was mentioned. The letter was unsigned, as best as the

source could recall.

whom he had made contact with the Cuban goverment. He

said he had been instructed by this person to for a clandestine

group of five persons, composed of himself, the source,

ALFREDO BORGES GALINDO, JOSE BENITO CLARK SANCHEZ and JOSE

LUIS FORNELL-JACINTO.

Although the last named individual

to Miami. (U)

According to the plan as outlined by ROMERD to the

source, ROMERO would make a trip to Cuba where he would be

furnished certain documents from ranking officials in the

Cuban government and a willingness to cooperate with the

United States. With these documents in hand ROMERO would

return to the United States and attempt to interest Central

Intelligence Agency (CIA) in this information. (U)

According to the source ROMERO did not state that

he would attempt to interest CIA in conducting an infiltration

effort into Cuba in which the participants would be arrested,

but only indicated that he would attempt to interest CIA in

the possible defection of some Important Cuban government

officials based on the documents furnished to him for this

purpose. (4)

that he could obtain these documents and initiate this plan.

The source further advised that in general con

versation with one MANUEL CHAMISO, 435 Southwest 4th Street,

Miami, supervisor at the doll factory where ROMERO recently

worked, he had determined that ROMERO had made two trips to

New York City in November and December, 1967. According to

CHAMISO, ROMERO had said he was making these trips in an

effort to obtain a boat

, to travel to Cuba.

money.
