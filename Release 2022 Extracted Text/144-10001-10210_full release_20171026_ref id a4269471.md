Doc Réf 1D: A4269471
GILBERTO POLICARPO LOPEZ aka eee, ee RODRIGUEZ

Born January 26, 1940, in tlavana Cuba.

Lopez ‘allegedly was at the home of Mary Quist in Tampa,
Florida, on November 17, 1963, awaiting a telephone call from
Cuba. The telephone call supposedly was to give him the
“go ahead order" to leave the United States. Lopez apparently
received such a telephone call sometime between November 17
and November 20, because on the latter date he obtained an
entry permit for Mexico.

A Mrs. Manuel (Christina) Amor, 8407 39th Street,

Tampa, Florida, telephoned sometime after 5:00 a.m. on
December 8, 1963, a friend in Cuba named Teresa and was told

Lopez had arrived safely in Cuba via Texas and Mexico.
