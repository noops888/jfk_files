On Novenber 26, 1963, Mr. A. HI, Young, Procuction

Group B (Cuban) of National Security Agency (NSA) , contacted

Liaison Agent to advise that NSA is undertaking a

project to

determine whether recent radio traffic between Cuba and the U.s.

may possibly contain any information of significance in captioned

case, particularly any intormation which migoi inaicate a

connection begween the Cuban Government and Oswaid's assassination

of President Kennedy.

Young stated that NSA has in their files copies of

numerous radio messages

between the U.S. and Cuba obtained

through NSA monitoring activities; that this traffic, which

averages approximataly 1,000 messages per day, is much too

volunanous

for an examination of each nessage; anu

that through

la mechanical computer process, they intend to select for further

examination any message sent during the past three months which

might contain the name of Ostald..

They also desire to include

in this computer project a selection of messages containing the

names of any close associates of Oswald, particularly in the

Fair Play for Cuba Cormittee, as well as any significant

addresses which may have been found among Oswald's effects.

Young asked whether we could review the resuits of our

investigations of Oswald and

furnish. NSA a

list of his

nore

significant contacts as well as addresses found in his effects.

After checking with the Espionage Section, Liaison

furnished Young the full name of subject's wife and

the alias,

Hidell, which he used in purchasing the murder weapon by mail.

Re was

advised that our investigation in this case is still

under way, that it is very extensive, and that upon completion

we will review the results for the purpose of determining

whether there are additional logical names or addresses

pertinent to the NSA project.

inmediately make the first run on this project with the names

GILBERTO POLICARPO LOPEZ aka GILBERTO

LOPEZ RODRIGUEZ

Born January 26, 1940, in Havana Cuba.

Lopez allegedly was at the home of Mary Quist in Tampa,

Florida, on November 17; 1963, awaiting a

telephone call from

Cuba. The telephone call supposedly was to give him the.

"go ahead order" to leave the United States. Lopez apparently

received such a telephone call sometime between November 17

and November 20, because on the latter date he obtained an

entry permit for Mexico.

A Mrs. Manuel (Christina) Amor, 8407 39th Street,

Tampa, Florida, telephoned sometime after 5:00 a.m. on

December 8, 1963, a friend in Cuba named Teresa

and was told

Lopez had arrived safely in Cuba via Texas and Mexico.
