REF: MEXICO CITY 46000 (IN 1047459)

As you will note from Ref, the Mexico City Station was unable to

locate LIONION-1 in Mexico and believes he may be in Spain. We are

preparing a priority cable for the Madrid Station which will give them

the background and ask their assistance

in locating him. We are not

asking them to contact him at this time.

The Mexico Station also drew a blank on the whereabouts of Viola

June COBB, AKA June COBB Sharp, and Henry P. Lopez. It will be noted

that the Station carried out pretty thorough investigation, and there

seems to be nothing

to indicate either are now in Mexico.

On the assumption that Sharp and Lopez may be in

the United States,

we suggest that the HSCA be advised of the results of out torts falsharp

efforts to locate them in Mexico.

We believe that any

and Lopez, both of whom are u.s. persons, should be initiated by the

HSCA rather than the Agency.

In order to assist the liscA in the in the U.s, we have included what

on their last known whereabouts

a) Viola June COBB Sharp was known

to have been in New York City in

1968. We have no address there. As of about 1960, her father,
