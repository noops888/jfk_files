The attached carbon copy of

our memorandum to our Miami

Field Office was forwarded

along with subject's 201

file to your office for

processing into his 201

folder.

Apparently the

memorandum became separated

during processing and was

returned to this office

yesterday. Per our conversa-

tion this date, request

you process this document

and have it filed in

subject's 201 folder. Thank

you very much for your

assistance.
