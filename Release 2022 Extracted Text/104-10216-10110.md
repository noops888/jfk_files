F 1. Three ANTRUNK operations, the foremost objective of each of
“ which has been to re-contact ANTRUNK-10 to broaden the base

of MHAPRON recruitment in the AMTRUNK project, have been mounted

in 1964, Two of the three have been partially successful but 7
to date ANICE-14, the AMTRUNK leader, has been unable to make
contact with AMTRUNK-10.

2. Operation ASTRUNK VI was mounted in January 1964. This
wag tho operation in which AMTRUNK-9 and his family were ex-
filtratod. Tho unexpected presence of ANTRUNK-9's wife and small
children forced: AMICE-14 to vacate the infil/exfiltration area

Prematurely. All three attempts to launch Operation AMTRUNK VII ie
in February were unsuccessful largely because of rough seas and ‘4
the resultant difficulty in towing the AMTRUNK Intermediate Craft. x?
The firefight with the patrol craft in the first stage of the in- af

filtration phase on Operation ANTRUNK VIII in March forced the
team to wait out the alert which their encounter had precipitated.
The team was able to emplace the AMLASH cache and to add to it

an OWVL receiver with instructions and schedules for AMTRUNK-10
as well as additional S/W supplies for ANTRUNK-10 and -11. An
S/W message containing the cache recovery plan was sent to
ANTRUNK-10 shortly after the team's return to the JMWAVE area.
