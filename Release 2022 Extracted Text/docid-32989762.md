February 19, 1968:

This source advised that he and his wife were in
San Juan, Puerto Rico from December 2 ~- 15, 1967. He stated
that the lastem of the last week of his trip, around December
13, 1967, he was sitting in the lobby of the Holiday Inn, half
asleep and overheard a conversation, in English, between two
Negro couples.

This source advised that it appeared that the couples
had prearranged plans to meet at the Holiday Inn, possibly to
eat, and source does not believe that they were registered, as
he did not see them before or after. :

The source said that from the conversation, at least
one couple appeared to be from California, as they were comment—
ing and comparing Governor Reagan to the former Governor Brown.

Source could recall no descriptive’ information con-

_ cerning one of the couples, but he stated that the man who did
most of the talking was approximately 6'3" to 6°4" in height,
and had on a black hat that flopped down on one side. The woman
with him was extremely well dressed, short and heavy set.

The Negro man doing the talking stated a Negro, Supposed-
- ly an associate of Martin Luther King, Jr., and formerly an open
advocate of violence, was to "hit" King during the Washington March
this spring, so as to place the blame on a white man in-the march,
By "Hit", the source took this as to kill King. This incident was
to be used to incite full scale rioting. :

This source advised that he had not wanted to get, involved,
thus the delay in reporting this matter to the Federal Bureau of
