POOR PEOPLE'S CAMPAIGN

The late Martin Luther King, JX., President,

Southern Christian Leadership Conference, publicly stated

prior to his death that he would conduct

a massive civi

disobedience campaign in the Nation's Capital in the Spring

of 1968 in an effort to pressure Congress into passing

legislation favorable to the Negro.

The attached page sets forth detailed data from

the Springfield Division of the FBI relative to this

campaign.

This document contains neither recommendations nor

conclusions of the FBI.

tributed outside your agency.
