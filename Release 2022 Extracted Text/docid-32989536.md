fer afore

Dare: 11/12/75 fink

At 11:15 a.m. on November 12, 1975, Cartha DeLoach

- former Assistant to the Director, telephonically advised me that he
was interviewed under oath by Mike Epstein and David Boshong of the
5 Senate Select Committee on November 11, 1975. He advised that he

was representéd by Charles McNellis, an attorney in the Washington law
Ss firm of Edward Morgan. The testimony was recorded by a stenographer.
3 and principally dealt with general guidelines Mr. DeLoach used in briefing :

various Attorneys General concerning FBI work. They also inquired . “

concerning the Counterintelligence Program in that they asked him if he
had ever briefed Ramsey Clark regarding the Counterintelligence Program. 1
Mr. DeLoach described that portion of the interview as a "political tug of.  Q

ns Mee

war'' in which Epstein attempted to have him say that Ramsey Clark had s
not been briefed, and Boshong attempted to.have him say that Rims vd
> Clark had been briefed.
N x
: Mr. DeLoach said that he testified that he had-briefed Ramsey
Clark regarding the Counterintelligence Program and ‘also briefed’ ‘Clark t

regarding wiretaps and microphones at Clark's specific request: Mr.’ DeLoach;
+ was asked whether he had written a memorandum regarding that briefing,
but he could not recall specifically whether the memorandum was prepared.
He did say that it was the practice for a memorandum to be prepared recounting
conversations with Department officials. The Committee representatives
then advised Mrs DeLoach that they had asked for such documentation from
the Bureau, but a memorandum indicating DeLoach had briefed Ramsey Clark
regarding the Counterintelligence Program was not received among the
documents furnished by the Bureau. Mr. DeLoach requested me to advise
the Bureau that in/View if such a cna can be an be Located, it should be 8
forwarded to the Committeé. “

Memorandum to Mr. Adams
Re: Senate Select Committee

Mr. DeLoach was asked whether anyone from the Bureau had
alerted him to the possibility that he would be asked concerning briefing
Ramsey Clark and whether anyone had suggested to him what his response
should be, He denied that such was the case, but did say that he had
received a telephone call from Assistant Director Wannall asking him
the question whether DeLoach had briefed any Attorneys General regarding
the Counterintelligence Program.

Mr. DeLoach was requested by the Committee to return on
Tuesday, November 18, 1975, at 2:30 p.m. for additional interview at which
time the subject will be the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and
Martin Luther King.

Mr. DeLoach said that a Mr. Wallach of the Committee’s
staff described a memorandum which he claimed that DeLoach had prepared
regarding Jack Anderson and the Warren Commission. Mr. DeLoach said
that he could not recall such amemorandum.

Mr. DeLoach requested that the Bureau make available a
Bureau representative for consultation at 2:30 p.m. on November 18, 1975.
Mr. DeLoach said he madethis request because he was uncertain as to the
scope of the testimony he might be asked to give regarding Martin Luther
King. In response to his question, I told Mr. DeLoach that informatim
concerning certain confidential sources involved in the origination ofithe
investigation of Martin Luther King has not been discussed with the
Committee staff, but limited discussion has been had with Chairman Frank
Church. I told Mr. DeLoach that inquiries concerning the informants involved
in the basic information in that case should not be answered due to the
sensitivity of the information.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. That the Intelligence Division determine whether there is

a memorandum describing a briefing of Ramsey Clark by Mr. DeLoach
concerning the Counterintelligence Program.

Re: Senate Select Committee

RECOMMENDATIONS (CONT'D)

2, That the aboy e-described memorandum be made available
to the Committee with such excisions as may be necessary.

3. In response to the specific request of Mr. DeLoach, a
Bureau representative familiar with the King matter should be available for
consultation at the time of Mr. DeLoach's testimony on November 18, 1975.

Re: Ralph David Abernathy

of 8/29/75 captioned "U. S. Senate Select Conmittea to Study
Govermmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities”
(brackets indicate excisions made). This memorandum was
furnished in response to a SSC inquiry regarding a special
paper for the Vice President concerning racial disturbances

in Mississippi end Georgia, Other documents furnished the ssc
xegarding Abermathy ace: (1) Bureau letter to Atlanta 7/14/64
requesting information concerning Abernathy's escapades

(2) FD-302 containing interview of Abernathy after King's
assassination and (3) Correspondence with Pittsburgh office
regarding counterintelligence activity against Abernathy,
including copy of congressional record 5/6/68. (AL1 attached.)

In addition the SSC asked whether Abernathy was ever
the subject of electronic surveillances (a charge also made
by Abernathy in the attached article).

was subject of active Bureau investigation following hi.
assumption of tiie presidency of the SCLC in the spring of i968.
That investigation was closed in 8/74. IFK Law 10(a)1

None of the attached documeats furnished the SSG
concerning Abernathy is classified and Legal Counsel Division
concurs with Intelligence Division, that if a representative of
the SSC exhibited such documents to Abernathy no violation of
Federal laws is involved. Such action by the SSC, however,
might constitute a breach of agreement between the FBI and the

. §8G which, in essence, is that information furnished the
Committee is to ba in confidence and not disclosed to um
authorized individuals. ~

RECOMMENDATION:

I£ approved, that a representative of the Legal
Counsel Division, through liaison contact with the Committee,
ascertain the facts ef this matter.

they have arrested and charged three of the leaders for the damage done
ta the Adrainistration Building when they went in the other night. and broke

Phe Vies President sald what he wants to be able to do is bring
out some facts the media conveniently overlooked, 1 said they never give
the things that are being done constructively, many times by students, to ~
try to prevent this, but they eraphasige ali thecthings: these jerks are doing.

The Vice President said he saw & picture about Augusta showing
some of the Negroes jumping out of store windows with font and booty and
fleeing and you never hear anything about thet. fe said whatever I can give
him that ean ameliorate some of the impact; that he uiiderstands some of
these things are wrong and we are probably soing to find some of the shootings
showed too much force, but none the less, the people have te understand
the very thrust of the newapaper articles is that a buach of police shot down
six Negroes and what happened before «~ why did they shoot at them ~-- not
just because they felt like killing people. I said they were severely provoked
at Kent and we will finish Augusta, Atlanta, and Jackson this week.

I told the Vice President 1 was sending to him Wednesday, the
‘material Kent Crane asked for, which cives in summary the material we
have sent in detail,

The Vice President said he thought he was going to have fo start
destroying Abernathy's credibility, so anything i can give him would be
appreciated. 1 told him I would be glad te, I said I was the only one who
apoke out against ‘Martin Lather King and 1 got hell, but I did not give a daman

The Pittsburgh "Point," a weekly newspaper

dated 10/24/68, contains an article which indicates that

Dr. RALPH ABERNATHY will speak at a mass rally at Central
Baptist Church,- Pittsburgh, Pa., on 11/2/68, as part of a
drive by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference

(SCLC) -to educate Black communities concerning the threes a
major presidential candidates.

The Congressional Record dated 5/6/68, on Txzne. 5%

(11968 edition of the "Herald," 407 Butler Street, Anderson,
“ . C., South Carolina's oldest Negro newspaper, contains
ry the testimony of a 15 year old female member of ABERNATHY's
church. The testimony relates to a filthy and perverted
sex scandal between ABERNATHY and the girl according to :
the Congressional Record. It is believed that if information
relating to this sordid episcde on the part of ABERNATHY
were made public in Pittsburgh, his effectiveness would be
- curtailed. ! Y

aid Chairman of Deacons of the Church prior to Abernathy's
appearance. The paper contains an articie about a sex scandal
involving Abernathy and a 15-year-old girl. The Congressional
Record also contains information about this scandal.

RALPH’ ABERNATHY—PREACHER
OR PERVERT

Mr. RARICK. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
my remarks, .

‘The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentleman
from Louisiana?

‘There was no objection.

Mr, RARICK, Mr. Speaker, ever since
Ralph Abernathy assumed concrel of
the rich man’s “poor people's march” to
occupy Washington, most southerners
who know about Abernathy have shud-
dered at the deceit and nationa? prestige
buildup given Abernathy as a leader.

We have kept our peace—knowing
that any comment would not receive fair
consideration—in all probability dis-
counted as “racism.”

But the news estab!‘shment, knowing
the facts, continued to be silent until
the Montgomery Advertiser on May 2,
1968, spoke out.

In a lead editorial captioned, “The
Leader of the Great Crusade,” the
Montgomery Advertiser slashed into
Abernathy's reputation by calling him,
“an unpolished and disreputable clod”
and politely, I assure you, rehashed the
sex scandai involving Abernathy and a
15-year-old female member of Aber-
nathy’s church, :

I have a complete transcript of the
testimony of the exploited girl given at
the jury trial of her hiusband—who was
acquitted by a jury of chasing and strik-
ing at Abernathy with a hatchet.

The testimony of the youthful victim,
Vivian McCoy Davis, uncontradicted by
Abernathy, -is so filthy and perverted
that I cannot—in good conscience—
place it in the Recorp for our colleagues’
examination.

I wili, however, make her testimony
available on request to my colleagues,
or It can be obtained from the iferald,
407 Butler Street, Anderson, S.C.—South
Carolina’s oldest Negro newspaper—by
asking for a copy of their June 19, 1964,

Mr, DORN, Mr. Speaker, I ask unani-
mous consent to address the House for
1 minute and to revise and extend my
remarks,

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentleman
from South Carolina?

There was no objection.

Mr. DORN. Mr. Speaker, WILBUR
Mus, our esteemed and beloved col-
league from Arkansas, was honored by
Clemson University in my congressional
district on Saturday, May 4.

When Clemson University honored our
inguished colleague, Witsur Mutts,
Clemson was in turn honored. As chair-
man of the great Committee on Ways and
Means for more than 10 years, WiLeur
Mutts has exercised a great and bene-
ficial influence on this Nation, and indeed
on the entire free world. His wise counsel
and superb leadership in international
trade, taxation, social security, and fiscal
esponsibility has profoundly influenced
the destiny of this Nation and the course
of freedom in the Western World.

Witcor Mints was awarded an honer-
ary doctor of laws deszree by Clemson
University for his statesmanship and
leadership in preserving the economy of
cur country and for his forthright stand
for fiscal responsibility.

Mr. Speaker, it was fitting and proper
that our great colleague be honored at

five greatest Senators of all-time.

Mr. Mints, while in the Calhoun man-

America—was presented a gavel and
pounding block made from a tree grown
on the Calhoun mansion grounds by Dr.
Wright Bryan, Clemson vice president
and former editor of the Atlanta Journal
and the Cleveland Plain Dealer.

The lovely and charming Mrs. Mills
accompanied her distinguished husband
to «ue Clemson campus. His excellency,
the Honorable Robert E. McNair, Gov.
ernor of South Carolina, and our own be-
loved and great colleague, the gentleman
irom South Carolina, Mznpen Rivers,
chairman of the Committee on Armed
Services, were present for this, one of
the most momentous occasions in the his-

COINTELPROS

a)
This is to advise of information furnished to the Senate
Select Committee (SSC) on 11/13/75, documenting information previ-
ously provided to the Committee indicating our Cointelpro efforts had
phased down prior to formal discontinuance of the programs on 4/28/71,

On 11/7/75, Barbara Banoff of the SSC staff advised the
Committee had reviewed the exhibits in the Petersen Report on FBI
Cointelpros in an effort to determine if Cointéipro actions had been
phased down as indicated by SA David Ryan in his deposition to. the
Committee in 10/75, Banoff stated SSC staff members had reviewed
all proposals for Cointelpro action in the Communist Party and New
Left programs, as reported in the Petersen Committee Report exhibits,
and these verified the fact these two programs had been considerably
phased down prior to 4/71, She stated the Petersen Report exhibits
did not list the dates of activities for proposals in the Black Nation-
alist, White Hate, and Socialist Workers Party programs and
requested this be furnished to the Committee. According to Banoff,
this information would be broken down for each of the five programs
to show how many actions were instituted in each quarterly period
during the life of the individual programs, and that a chart would be
prepared for the Committee's use.

After obtaining information from the IS-1 and the Is-2
Sections (enclosed), the requested data for the additional three programs

was furnished to Banoff on 11/13/75. ‘These charts do indicate the |
programs had phased down considerably prior to their formal termi-
nation .

£ origin or to ‘some other "denied area." I under-
stand from our conversation that the intelligence
manual’ of the’ FBI refers toa procedure in which
the FBI would request Customs officials to examine
‘or to facilitate the FBI inspection of the outgoing
‘baggage of such individuals.” . This appears to be a
clandestine :effart to determine if such "defecting
: emigrants" are transporting the products or other
\*) “evidence ‘of espionage or if they are being coerced
'. into leaving the United. States. 2

: As I mentioned in our brief telephone conver-_
.sation yesterday, Customs has advised me that it

. has no program for assisting the FBI in the in-

. spection of outgoing baggage and has not been
approached, at the Headquarters level,.for this

“type of assistance. Its concern is with incoming
baggage, -and Customs doubts that it could segregate
a particular individual! s outgoing bag for inspection.

The Customs Service acknowledges that an FBI
- request for assistance could have been made with an
_: individual Customs official at the local office
>: level without the knowledge of Customs Headquarters

A.12. What is the authority and prdcedure for inspections on-behalf of

another agency such as CIA, FBI, DEA, IRS, Postal Service, and Internal
Security Division? : Le

The US Customs Service has the authority under 19 U.S.C. 1499 to
examine all mercharidise arriving in the United States. We believe this
authority encompasses and authorizes Customs to conduct inspections at
the request of the CIA, since the statute states that imported merchan-
dise "shall not be delivered from Customs custody, except under such
bond or other security as may be prescribed by the Secretary of the
Treasury to assure compliance with all applicable laws, regulations
and instructions which the Secretary of the Treasury or the Customs
Service is authorized to enforce... ." 50 U.S.C. 403 authorizes
Federal agencies to cooperate with the CIA. There are no established
procedures for Customs inspections carried pn at the behest of the

CIA. Any request would be handled on a case by case basis.

The language of 19 U.S.C. 1499 as cited above may also, in our opinion,
be: potentially applicable in connection with the FBI examination of

; imported shipments. We are unaware of any established procedure for %

Customs inspections carried on at the behest of the FBI. Any request
would be handled on a case by case basis.

The US Customs Service’ shares with DEA enforcement responsibility
respecting certain controlled substances the importation of which is
prohibited by 21 U.S.C. 952, 19 U.S.C. 482 and 1582 provide the
authority for the Customs search of persons and baggage. Final
operating procedures between DEA and Customs have never been formalized.
Attachment A is the interim Customs-DEA operating procedures issued by
the US Customs Service, Attachment B is the interim Customs~DEA opera~
tion procedures issued by DEA. :

Customs assists IRS in enforcing the Currency and Foreign Transactions
Reporting Act, 31 U.S.C. 1051 et seq. The Treasury Department
Regulations issued to implement 31.U.S.C. 1051 et seq., Part 103

of Title 31 CFR, require that reports be filed with the Commissioner
of Customs by individuals engaged in transporting currency or other
monetary instruments in excess of $5,000. These reports must be filed
upon entry into or departure from the United States of such an individual.
The pen of 19 U.S.C. 482 and 1582 are used to search persons
and baggage arriving from foreign countries in order to ascertain
compliance with many Federal and state laws of which The Currency and
Foreign Transactions Reporting Act is one.

B.11. Under what circumstances, if any, have Customs Service
facilities. been made available to agencies of the national
security intelligence community?

As it has in the past, Customs continues to cooperate with
and assist-other Federal agencies, including those of the
national security intelligence community, in the performance
and enforcement of their statutory responsibilities on
those occasions when these agencies request the assistance
of the Customs Service. At least one significant exanple
of this cooperation has been the subject of interviews by
the Committee's Domestic Intelligence Task Force with a
number of present. and former Customs employees.

Interview of Donald E. Moore by Mr. James Dick
of the Senate Select Committee Staff

After being sworn by Senator Huddleston, I was interviewed
under oath by Mr. James Dick in the Old Carroll Arms Hotel on
1 October 1975. The interview started at approximately 1020 hours
and lasted until 1345.

During the interview I was shown numerous Bureau documents
and asked questions about them. Some of the meetings described in
the. documents I had no recollection about but I answered all the
questions to the best of my ability.

I said that Mr, Hoover had personally approved the various
mail programs. On some memoranda whic: did not go to Mr. Hoover's
office and-were signed off by Mr. Belmont I said I thought this was
because Mr. Hoover had approved the program either orally or ina
prior memorandum and therefore I thought Mr. Belmont did not send
the subsequent memorandum in to Mr: Hoover.

Iwas asked if any Attorney General ever was informed of the
mail program and I advised that the only one I personally knew was
advised was Attorney General Katzenback. I explained that sometime
in 1965 I received a phone call from Mr. Belmont on a Saturday
morning and he asked me to come to his office as we needed to see
the Attorney General with regard to some testimony the previous
day before a subcommittee chaired by Senator Long of Missouri.

Mr. Belmont, in his office, advised me that Chief Postal Inspector
Henry Montague had appeared before the Long Committee and had
been told before his testimony not to answer any questions that might
relate to national security matters, When he was asked whether

mail ever left the custody of the Post Office Department he answered
no as he believed to decline to answer would be tantamount to a yes
and could affect national security. Mr. Belmont talked to Mr. Tolson
by phone and thereafter we met the Attorney General in his office.
Courtney Evans, former Bureau Assistant Director and thena
Special Assistant to the AG, was also present but Mr. Dick did not

.
ask me who was present and I did not volunteer Courtney's name.
Either Mr. Montague had contacted the AG or Mr. Belmont had
mentioned the matter to him for as I recall the AG was aware of the
problems when we arrived. After discussing the matter, as I

recal* the AG said he would try to see Senator Long to get the

matter resolved. Mr. Dick asked if we told the AG we were

opening the mail we received from the Post Office and I said I

could not specifically recall this. He asked if we would have advised
the AG if he had asked and I said yes. As to whether I learned later
if, the AG ever discussed this with Mr. Hoover and if we were advised
to discontinue I said I knew of no such discussion, if one took place,
and we were not told by Mr. Hoover to discontinue until mid-1966.

I also did not know if the AG saw Senator Long.

Mr. Dick asked about the Baltch case and if I had informed
former Assistant Attorney General Yeagley about mail intercepts
‘in the case andI1 said I had, He asked if Mr. Yeagley had informed
the Attorney General and I said I did not know but I believe that
Attorney General Kennedy was advised by the Bureau later. AsI
recall when trial started the US Attorney had made a statement that
required the government to either amend the statement or drop the
case and after Cuurtney Evans, then still in the Bureau, had advised
the AG of the mail intercept the AG decided the case should be
dropped. Mr. Dick asked if I was aware of a briefing Attorney
General Kennedy received in the New York office and if I knew
whether the mail programs were discussed. I said I remembered
the briefing, understood it was very comprehensive, but I do not
Khow if it covered the mail programs.

2 >

Mr. Dick asked if I knew whether any other Attorneys General
had been advised of the Bureau's mail programs and I said I did not
know of any. I also did not know of any Postmaster General who had
been advised, or Presidents.

With regard to‘the Hunter Project I said I had been aware
of it from the time the FBI started receiving material from it.
I could not recall how we were first advised but I believe either
the Post Office suggested we go to CIA or the Post Office went to
CIA and suggested we be advised. He asked if Mr. Hoover was aware
of it and I said he was.

«~2-

Aes



Mr. Dick asked me various questions about my contacts
with Mr. Montague, several of which were set forth in the various
Bureau memoranda I was shown. With regard to the institution of
Z coverage in New York City he asked me if we first made contact
with the Chief Postal Inspector her’: and I said we did. He asked
who contacted hjm and I said I believed Mr. Boardman contacted
Mr. Stephens who was then the Chief Postal Inspector. Mr. Dick
asked if I had ewer contacted Mr. Stephens and I said to the best
of my recollection I had never met him and was quite sure i had
not contacted him on any mail program. In response to a question
as to whether I had ever advised Mr. Montague the FBI opened mail
received from the Post Office I said I had not,

Tadvised Mr. Dick I knew of no mail intercepts by the FBI
after 1966 and was quite sure there had beer none.

UNITED STATES SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON
INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE: INTERVIEW OF FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION
(FBI) SPECIAL AGENT HOMER W, SCHWEPPE BY
SSC_STAFF MEMBER JAMES DICK

On September 23, 1975, after a short orientatiou
discussion ond after advising him of his rights under the 4
Constitution and reminding him that his appearance was
voluntary, SSC Stafi Nember James Dick interviewed FBI

“Special Agent Homer W, Schwepne in the presence of SSC
stenotypist Susan Hanback regarding his knowledge of

the following: The "Hunter Project," "Bureau Informant
200," "the SAM Survey," “Z Coverage," and opening of mail
by FBI employees.

At the outset Dick asked Schweppe to document his
FBI service. Schweppe responded by listing the following:
Assignments in San Francisco from late 1946 to mid-1947;
in Los Angeles from mid-1947 to mid-1951; at FBI Headquarters
(FBIHQ) from May, 1951, to May, 1958, and again from late
1960 to November, 1961; in the Washington Field Office (WFO)
of the FBI from May, 1958, on, except for the 1960 to 1961
period just cited.

During the course of the interview Schweppe was
, also asked to indicate the nature of his assignments at‘
FBIHQ. He indicated he was assigned for the main part to
units within the Domestic Intelligence Division dealing
with Soviet military attache personnel and with members
of Elizabeth Bentley's “espionage ring."

U.S.- SSC ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES ster

Dick's initial inquiry was directed to the extent
of Schweppe's knowledge of the "Hunter Project," When
Schweppe concedéd he was not f>miliar with the term, Dick
offered as an exhibit for review a copy of a February 6,
1958, memorandum directed to Director Hoover entitled "Hunter
Project."" This memorandum outlined arrangements to be
effected between the FBI and the Central Intelligence Agency
(CIA) regarding the manner in which the FBI would be provided
the results of CIA's monitoring of certain overseas mail,

On review of the document, Schweppe stated he was certain

he had never seen that memo, but he acknowledged that on

the basis of the memo he had a recollection about such
activity by the CIA, Schweppe recalled that at some point
prior to his transfer from FBIHQ in May, 1958, and he
indicated he felt it must have been earlier than the

February 8, 1958, date indicated above, he had pass across
his desk in the normal flow of official mail what he referred
to as the modern day version of computer printout lists
consisting, to the best of his recollection, of names of

what were presumed to be Soviet residents as well as addresses
in the Soviet Union, Schweppe indicated that he kad soen
‘several such lists but since they did not seem applicable

to the type of cases being supervised by Schweppe at the
time, he paid them little heed. He_recalled that at least
with some of the later printouts there were instructions
accompanying theprintouts to the effect that names and/or
addresses of interest should be flagged for what was

presumed to be a "watch list" of some sort.

Dick asked specifically when Schweppe first
became aware of the lists montioned above; whether he was
familiar with FBI Form 5-88, a form prepared for placing
@ request on the “watch list"; whether he had seen any of
the results of the CIA monitoring; and whether he had
seen any reproduction of correspondence photographed by
CIA in connection with the “Hunter Project.”

U.S.” SSC_ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES saphien

Schweppe replied that he thought the lists
he mentioned earlier probably were seen by him before
February, 1958, but he’ acknowledged he could not recall
exactly when, He said he could not now recall ever haviug
seen FBI Form 5~88, He replied that, since he felt he had
never placed a name or address on the “watch list," he
would not have any specific results routed to his personal
attention, He added, however, that if the results were
routed to all supervisors concerned with Soviet intelligence
and’ related matters, he probably did see such results
and routinely initialed the accompanying routing slips.
He said he could recall no specific "CIA results" if, in
fact, he did see anything specific. 7

Dick asked whether Schweppe was aware of who
designated the routing of the lists he had seen, and
Schweppe responded that he assumed it was some individual
in the office of the division's Assistant Director who
performed such an administrative function. Schweppe said
he did not recall a Miss Triplett (phonetic), who,
according to Gick, was responsible for routing the “Hunter
Project" matorial to appropriate supervisors, Schweppe
said he could have been included in such routing because
of his assignment.

Dick then queried Schweppe on his familiarity
with the term "Bureau Informant 200" (BI 200), when he
first became aware of the term, and whether he ever saw
any of the material attributed to that informant, In
this connection Dick exhibited another FBIHQ memo dated
February 6, 1958, whi referred to BI 200 as the designation
used by FBIHQ to forward to its field offices information
received from CIA under the "Hunter Project." Schwepne
was unable to recall exactly when he first became aware
of the use and‘identity of BI 200, but he assumed it was
in early 1958. He said he could recall seeing information
attributed to BI 200 both while at FBIHQ and in WFO but
that he could no longer recall the specific nature of the
items involved. He said he presumed that all of thom
dealt with-Sovict-related investigatory matters, Schweppe
said he did not believe he has seen any references to
BL 200 in the past 15 years or so and that he may have seen
as many as five references a year before that.

Dick also queried Schweppe about his knowledge
of the "SAM Survey" (SAM) and "Z Coverage" (Z). He
asked Schwepne whether he knew when "SAM" and "Z" were
initiated, what they consisted of, when they ceased,
when he first became aware of them, and whether he had seen
any results of those projects. Schweppe replied that
SAM" and "'Z" were on a need-to-know basis within WFO but
that he in time heard about them through office “shop
talk" and then concluded that those designations indicated
projects in which mail to and/or from the Soviet Union and
Soviet bloc countries was monitored, He said he did
not know when those projects were initiated or when they
terminated, He said that he would have to guess within a
tolerance of two or three years that ‘.e first heard of those
projects in the early 1960s, Schweppe said he was called
on from time to time to translate correspondence in German,
which correspondence had been photographed by some source
not identified initially. Schweppe suggested that on later
inqui t the source of the correspondence he was
informed it s either from "SAM" or "Z," He said he was
unable to recall specifically who so advised him. He felt
it was possible that word was just "passed along" to that
effect. He could not recall whether each specific individual
item was identified in a particular, special manner so as
to tie it in to its source. Schweppe stated that he believes
all such material translated by him was directed to officials
at the Soviet and/or Soviet bloc embassies in Washington,
D. C., and not to any non-diplomatic personnel, Such
translation requirements were quite infrequent, and Schweppe
was not called on to translate any such material within
the past eight or ten years, to the best of his recollection.

Schweppe said it was his impréssion that "SAM"
in New York City was handled in space al one. or the other
of New York's airports, He said he was unaware of the
specific arrang nts in Washington, D, C, He related that
he was’ aware that FBI Special Agent John De Bettencourt,
since deceased, was directly involved in WFO's "Z Coverage"
project but that he did not know specifically to whom De
Bettencourt was answerable,

Dick asked whether Schweppe was aware of any
mail having been opened by FBI e:aployees in situations other
than the projects referred to above. Schweppe, after making
the observation that Federal law and FBI regulations
prohibit such activity, said he himself had never opened
anyone's mail in his capacity as an FBI employee, that he
never observed any other FBI employee so engaged, and that
he personally was not aware of any specific instances in
which that might have happened. At this point Schweppe
related that while he was assigned to the Los Angeles
Office, he suspected that a female employee, whose name he
gould not recall, might possibly have been engagéd in the
surreptitious opening of other people's mail because of
the suspicio#gnature of her actions at certain times,
Schweppe added that these were suspicions raised by
circumstantial evidence only.

Dick then presented a hypothetical situation in
Which agents on duty might obtain mail posted by an
individual and then proceed to open the same and review
the contents. He asked whether Schweppe was aware of any
such instances, Schweppe acknowledged that the suggested
Scenario sounded realistic enough but added that he could
recall no such actual situations,

During the course of the interview, Schweppe
indicated that he had been assigned to Soviet-relatad
investigatory matters in WFO until early 1959, after
which he was assigned to the handling of German, Latin
American, Middle East, and Chinese investigatory matters
at different times,

Schwevpe concluded by stating that his knowledge
and recollection of the subject matter constituting the
basis for the inquiry were weak. We reiterated that he
never opened any other person's mail in his capacity as an
FBI employee, that he never witnessed any other FBI employce
opening any such mail, and that he cannot recall ever
being aware of any Situation in which mail was opened by
FBI employees, exclusive of the "SAM" and "Z" projects
mentioned above,

This interview commenced about 10:15 a.m.,
September 23, 1975, and concluded at about 11:15 p.m.

the same day.

Res Series of Studies Prepared at the Request
of Former Deputy Attorney Ceneral
William D. Ruckelshaus

With respect to inguiry number three of the
Ruckolshaus memorandum, two items included in the
original response to the Department, viz., Section 87
of the Manual of Instructions, and the study prepared
in August, 1972, for former Acting Director I. Patrick
Gray III, i.e., the Position Paper prepared by former
FBI Section Chief Thomas J. Smith captioned "Domestic
Intelligence Division-Scope of FRI Authority, Jurisdiction,
and Responsibilities In Domestic Intelligence Investigations,"
haye not been inciuded in the material furnished herewith
since both items were previously furnished to the s5SC in
response to earlier and separate requests.

1 - The Attorney General
NOTE:

Copies of those studies previously furnished
to the Department were readily located in appropriate
files. However, review of numerous logical files failed
to'locate any serials revealing a response to the -
Department relative ta inquiries two, eight, and 10 of
the 7/20/73 Ruckelshaus memorandum. By memorandum from
O. T. Jacobson to Mr. Callahan, 7/5/74, (almost one year
later) regarding the status of responses to the Ruckelshaus
inquiry, it was noted that response to questions two, eight,
and 10, while completed and ready for the Department, had
not been furnished to the Department. The memorandum is
apparently consistent with another earlier memorandum to
W. R. Wannall from T. J. Smith dated 12/14/73, regarding
this matter wherein it was suggested that prior to com-
pleting any studies which had been ordered by Richardson
(former AG) and Ruckelshaus, we should wait for Mr. Saxbe
to take office as AG. This memorandum also contained
Director's notation "No need to do anything further at
this point."

Material prepared in response to questions two,
eight, and 10 was located in the IS-3 Section, INED, and
is being included in material furnished to SSC since such
material appears to be covered by the SSC request.

Dear Mr. Levi:

At the close of his testimony on September 25,

Mr. Charles Brennan, former Chief of Domestic Intelligence
Division, -indicated that he could not answer a question
posed to him by me. The question relates to the status of

a so-called "closed" FBI Domestic Intelligence case file.
Suppose that the individual who is. subject of the filte is a
member of the military service or applies for employment
with a federal government agency, and the agency requests an
FBI name check. What information would be provided to the
federal agency by the FBI as the result of that name check?
jWhat information would be provided to that agency if the FBI
conducted a background investigation on that individual?

DICK was friendly and afinble but businesslike
throughout the interview. In «a brief initial off-ine-racord
exchange, DICK explained that he was interested in SCHTPPE's
hnowledge of the “Hunter Project." When SCHVEPPL indi cai
he was not faniliar with the term, DICK consulted his not
to confirm whether SC/IWEPPE in fact wau the party ho intended
to interview, A check by him corroboraced that SCHVEPPE's
name had been provided him by the Vepartment of Juztice
as an individual with knowledge of "Hunter" and related
projects.

(ourine this initial exchange, SCWEPPT indicated
that his Yecollection of specifics such as "exac
and “Did you ever sec?" or “When did you fix v learn?”
or "How many tines did you see?” besed on Taterial possibly
seen by him over a period of several months as far back
as 1958 was limited, DICK agreed “and «suggested that there
really might be no need to continue the interview, but in
the end he suggested that since 211 purties were in place,
the interrogation might as well proceed.

He indicated that a transcript of the interview
would be available for veview by SCHMVEPPE in about a week,
DICK said he would contact SA DALY at FRIHOQ at the
appropriate time. On contact on 9/30/75, DICK said the

INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE: INTERVIEW OF FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION
(FBI) SPECIAL AGENT HOMER W. SCHWEPPE BY
SSC_STAFF MEMBER JAMES DICK

On September 23, 1975, after a short orientation
discussion and after advising him of his rights under the
Constitution and reminding him that his appearance was
voluntary, SSC Staff Member James Dick interviewed FBI
Special Agent Homer W. Schweppe in the presence of SSC
stenotypist Susan Hanback regarding his knowledge of
the following: The "Hunter Project," "Bureau Informant

00," "the SAM Survey," "Z Coverage," and opening of mail
by FBI employees. .

At the outset Dick asked Schweppe to document his
FBI service. Schweppe responded by listing the following:
Assignments in San Francisco from late 1946 to mid -1947;
in Los Angeles from mid-1947 to mid-1951; at FBI Headquarters
(FBIHQ) from May, 1951, to May, 1958, and again from late
1960 to November, 1961; in the Washington Field Office (WFO)
of the FBI from May, 1958, on, except for the 1960 to 1961
period just cited.

During the course of the interview Schweppe was
also asked to indicate the nature of his assignments at
FBIHQ, He indicated he was assigned for the main part to
units within the Domestic Intelligence Division dealing
with Soviet military attache personnel and with members
of Elizabeth Bentley's "espionage ring."

U.S, SSC ‘ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES .__

_« ° Dick's initial inquiry was directed to the extent
of Schweppe’s knowledge of the "Hunter Project." . When
Schweppe. conceded he was.not familiar with the term, Dick

- offered as an exhibit ‘for review a copy of a February 6, ae
.1958, memorandum dirécted to Director Hoover entitled “Hunter —

‘ Project." This memorandum outlined: arrangements to -be.
effected between the FBI and the Central Intelligence Agency
(CIA) regarding the manner in which the FBI would be provided’
the results of. CIA’s monitoring of certain overseas mail. ~
On review of the document,. Schweppe stated he was certain -
he had never seen that memo; but he acknowledged:that on. ~
‘the basis of the memo he had a recollection about such
‘activity by thé CIA, Schweppe recalled that at some point

- prior -to his transfer from FBIHQ in May, 1958, and he -

’ indicated he felt it must have been earlier than the -
February 8, 1958, date indicated above, he had pass across
his desk in the’ normal flow of official mail what he referred
to as the modern day version of computer printout lists
consisting, to the best of his recollection, of names of

‘what were presumed to be Soviet residents as well as’ addresses | 7

in the Soviet Union, Schweppe indicated that.he had seen
several such lists but since they did not seem applicable |
to the type of cases being supervised by Schweppe at the
time, he paid them little heed. He. recalled that.at least.
‘with some of the later printouts there were instructions |
accompanying theprintouts to the effect that names and/or

. addresses of interest should be flagged for what was 7

-. presumed to-be a "watch list" of some.sort...

: .Dick. asked specifically when Schweppe first ;
became aware of the lists ‘mentioned above;. whether hé was
‘familiar with FBI Form 5-88, a form prepared for placing
a request.on the "watch list"; whether he had seen any of

. the results of ‘the CIA monitoring; and whether he hed -
seen any. reproduction of correspondence photographed by ~~
CIA in connection with. the "Hunter Project." a :

: . -Schweppe replied that ‘he thought the. lists :
: he mentioned earlier probably were seen by him: before

February, 1958, but he acknowledged he‘could not: recall -
exactly when.: He said he could not now recall ever having.
seen FBI Form 5-88. “He replied that, since he felt he had
néver placed a mame or address on. the "watch list," he
would not. have any specific results routed’ to his: personal .
attention. He added, however, that if the results were
routed to all supervisors concerned with Soviet intelligence
and related. matters, he probably did see such results -
and routinely initialed the accompanying routing slips, .

_ He said. he ould: recall no specific "CIA beac aaa if, in

7 fact, he did see anything specific. .

- “ Daek asked whether ‘Schweppe- was’ aware of ‘who
designated the routing of the lists he had seen, and.
Schweppe responded.that ‘he assumed it was some. individual
‘in the office of ‘the division’s Assistant Director who
performed such an. administrative function. Schweppe. said”
he did not recall a Miss Triplett (phonetic),. who,
according to“Dick, was responsible for routing the “Hunter

. Project" material to appropriate supervisors. Schweppe
Said he could have been included in such routing because
of his. assignment .

. : Dick ‘then queried Schweppe on his familtarity’
‘with the term "Bureau Informant 200" (BI 200), when he

first became aware of the term,.and whether he ever. saw - .
any of the material attributed to that informant, “In —
this connection Dick exhibited. another FBIHQ-memo dated . :
February 6, 1958,’ which referred to BI 200 as ‘the. designation
used by FBIHQ to forward to its field offices. anformation

. received. from CIA under the "Hunter Project." Schweppe
was unable to recall exactly when he-first became aware
of the use and. identity of BI'200, but he assumed it was

‘in early 1958. He said he could récall seeing information
attributed to BI 200 both while at FBIHQ and. in WFO but -
that he could no longer recall the specific nature.of the
items involved. He said he presumed that all of them
dealt with Soviet-related investigatory matters. Schweppe’
said he did not believe he has seen any references. to

’ BI 200 in the past 15 years or so and that he may have: seen:
as many as five sozerenee a year before that.

‘U.S. SSC ON INTELLIGENCE. ACTIVITIES . SECRET -¢
F Dick also queried. Schweppe about -his -knowledge '.

of the "SAM. Survey" (SAM) and "Z Coverage" (Z). He =~ :°-

- asked Schweppe whether he knew when "SAM". and “Z" were
initiated, what they consisted of, when they ceased, 7

when he first ‘became aware. of them, and whether he had seen
any results of those projects. Schweppe replied that.

-"SAM" ‘and."Z" were on @ need-to-know basis within WFO but

that he in time heard about them through office “shop. §_"
talk" and then concluded that those designations indicated .

'? . projects in which mail to and/or from the Soviet Union and |

Soviet bloc countries was.monitored.’ He said he did.
not: know when those projects. were initiated or when they
terminated. He said that he would have to guess within a’ —

“ tolerance of two-or three years that he first ‘heard of those -

projects in the early 1960s. Schweppe said he-was.called -
on from time to time to translate correspondence in German, —

which correspondence had beei' photographed by some source —

not identified initially. Schweppe suggested that on later —

inquiry, about the source of the correspondence he was

| -dnformed it was either from.."SAM" or "Z." He ‘said he was”

unable to récall specifically who so advised him. He felt.
it.was possible that word was just “passed along" to that ©
‘effect. He could ‘not récal] whether each specific individual .

. item was identified in a particular, special manner ‘so as ae
‘to tie it in to-its source, . Schweppe stated that he. believes |

all such material translated. by him was directed to officials

at the Soviet and/or Soviet bloc embassies in Washington,
- D, C., and not to any Hon-diplomatic personnel. . Such

translation requiremeats were quite infrequent, and Schweppe ©
. was not called:on to translate any. such material within —
ithe past eight or ten years, to the best: of his recollection.

. an Schweppe said it was his impression that. "SAM". .
in New York City. was handled in space at one or the other.

of New York's airports. He said hé was unaware of the = |.
‘specific arrangements in Washington, D.C. He related that-
he was aware that FBI Special Agent John De Betténcourt, i
-since deceased, was directly ‘involved in WFO's "Z Coverage". .
project but that he did not know specifically to whom De. -
Bettencourt was answerable. : . : Peete

. Dick asked whether Schweppe ‘was avvare of ‘any :
aria “mail having been opened by FBI employees in ‘situations other
than the projects referred to above, Schweppe, after making
the observation that Federal law and FBI regulations’
prohibit such activity,. said he himself had never opened
anyone’s mail in his capacity as an FBI employee, that he
never observed any other FBI employee so engaged, and. that -
he personally was not aware of any specific instances in :
-which that might have happened. At ‘this point Schweppe~
related that while he was assigned ‘to the Los Angeles
Office, he suspected that. a female employee, whose name he
+éould not recall, might possibly ‘have been engaged im the
. surreptitious opening of other people's mail because.of
the suspicious nature of her actions at certain times. | sanee
Schweppe added’ that. these were need raised by aenoeue
“circumstantial evidence only. - ‘ : an

. Dick then presented a hypothetical: situation -in
: which agents on duty’ might obtain mail posted by. an’
individual and then proceed to open the same and review
the contents. He asked whether. Schweppe was- aware of any
such instances,  Schweppe acknowledged that the suggested | :
‘scenario sounded realistic enough but added that he contd

“recall. no such actual situations. . rt oat

: During the course ‘of the “interview, 'Schweppe
i indicated that he. had been assigned to Soviet-related,
‘investigatory matters in WFO until early 1959,.after .
which he was assigned ‘to the handling of German, Latin
‘ American, Middle East, and Chinese" investigatory matters Tee
_ at different times, ~ 7 :

Schweppe concluded by stating that his ‘knowledge
- and recollection of the subject. matter constituting the’
basis for the inquiry were weak. He reiterated that he
never opened any other: person's mail in-his capacity as an.
FBI- employee, that he never witnessed any other FBI employes -
opening any such mail, and that he cannot recall ever,
being aware of any situation in which. mail was opened by
: FBI employees, ‘exclusive of the "SAM" and Sal cas nacicaaey
mentioned above. .

- AN ANALYSIS OF FBI DOMESTIC SECURITY
INTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATIONS: AUTHORITY,
OFFICIAL ATTITUDES, AND ACTIVITIES IN HISTORIC PERSPECTIVE:
A SYNOPSIS

Many persons who are currently examining the FBI's
domestic security intelligence authority and the parameters
of this jurisdiction begin their analysis at a mid-point in
the history of this Nation's struggle against the force of
subversion. This approach tends to result in a mechanical
examination of the subject without the benefit of an under-
standing of the historical forces and necessities which
brought about the need to conduct domestic security intelli-
gence investigations. In an effort to clarify the role the
FBI has played in this field, it is deemed appropriate to
submit this concise review of historic events illustrating
the evolution of the problem of domestic subversion, atti-
tudes of Government officials towards the problem, and how,
against this historic backdrop, the FBI, came to be assigned
domestic security intelligence responsibilities.

Many today assume incorrectly that the FBI commenced
i domestic security intelligence investigations within the last

. several years. In fact, the Bureau of Investigation, the pred-
ecessor of the modern FBI, was given foreign and domestic
security responsibilities during World War I (WWI), 1917-1918.

In 1917, Congress enacted the Selective Service
and Training Act, the Espionage Act, and the Trading with the
Enemy Act, followed in 1918, by the Sabotage and Deportation
Acts. Enforcement responsibilities for the most part 11 on
the Bureau of Investigation. :

During World War I there was at all times an
‘enormous overlapping of investigative activities among the
various agencies charged with the winning of the war. There
were probably seven or eight such active organizations opera-
ting at full force during war days and it was not an uncommon
experience for an Agent of this Bureau to call upon an indi-
vidual in the course of his investigation, to find out that six
or seven other Government agents representing as many other
investigative agencies had been around to interview the party
about the same matter.

NW 68262 Docld:32989536 Page 171



In an effort to counter the radicals and anarchists,
| the Department and Bureau, in conjunction with the Department
| of Labor, which had primary jurisdiction over immigration
Matters, used the provisions of the "Deportation Statute" as
an answer. ,

. ‘In 1919, J. Edgar Hoover, a Departmental Attorney
since 1917, was placed in charge of the General Intelligence
Division, Department of Justice. The Division had the respon-
sibility of correlating information obtained by the Bureau for
the purpose of preparing material for deportation proceedings.
As a Departmental Attorney, Mr. Hoover not only observed the

! wartime problems but experienced the difficulties associated with

| intelligence- type investigations while with the Division.

a on October 5, 1920, he prepared a report on the
General Intelligence Division and stated very clearly that
information which the Bureau was collecting was being used
by the General Intelligence Division ofthe Department of
Justice as pure and valuable intelligence information to assess
internal domestic radical activity as early as 1919.

| : In 1924, Harlan Fiske Stone was appointed Attorney
General of the United States, and his concept as to the Bureau's
role was quite clear:

"The Bureau of Investigation is not concerned with

- political or other opinions of individuals. It is
concerned only with such conduct as is forbidden by
the laws of the United States. When a police system
goes beyond these limits it is dangerous to the
proper administration. of justice and to human
liberty..."

J. Edgar Hoover, who was appointed Director of the
Bureau of Investigation by Attorney General Stone in 1924,
followed this policy from its inception.

To complete the picture of official FBI policy and
attitude regarding investigation of radical activities during
the 1920's and early 1930's, it must be noted that intelligence-
type investigations were conducted on a very limited basis and
for specific purposes when requested by the Attorney General
and Secretary of State under the provisions of the Appropriations
Act, 28 U.S.C. 533(3).

NW 68262 Docid:32989536 Page 172 |


Though the Departmental and Bureau policy from
1924 to 1934 was to not engage in general domestic security
intelligence investigations, the communist-anarchist problem
‘was ever present and of great concern to the public, the
Executive, and Congress. The “red radicals" and anarchists
were no longer alone in the field, however, for in the early
“1930's, National Socialism, the Nazi party ideology of
Adolf Hitler, grew to power in Germany and anti-Semitic, anti-
racial propaganda was being peddled by Nazi operatives, aliens
and pro-German Americans in the United States.

On May 8, 1934, Mr. Hoover appeared at a conference
at The White House attended by President Franklin D. Roosevelt,
the Attorney General, the Secretary of the Treasury, the
Secretary of Labor, and the Chief of the Secret Service.-’ The
topic of concern was the Nazi movement in the United States. As
a result of the conference, Hoover recorded on May 10,1934:

",,.it is desired that a very careful
and searching investigation be made of this
movement, with particular attention to be os
given to activities indicating that either
the German Embassy or the German Consulates
throughout the United States may have con-
nection with this movement.

"The investigation should be considered
as a so-called intelligence investigation,
that is to say, the reports should be pre-
pared in one general summary at specified
intervals in order that the Attorney General
may have them made available, and in turn
make them available to the President."

It is readily recognized that this Presidential in-
struction waS not a sweeping and general assignment to conduct
domestic security intelligence investigations, but rather to
conduct an intelligence investigation within specified guide-
lines. Nonetheless, here, based upon a Presidential Directive,
the Bureau departed from past statutory policy and immediately
initiated an intelligence investigation, which by necessity,
involved aliens and United States citizens and was conducted
for the primary purpose of informing the Attorney General and
the President as to the general activities of the movement.

This investigation of the Nazi movement, conducted:
along the specified guidelines set by the President, was not
-expanded to include investigation of such communist or radical
movements whose purpose it was to overthrow the Government.
In-a memorandum dated October 9, 1935, for the Acting Attorney
General, the Director noted in his response to a State
Department inquiry as to the feasibility of exchanging radi-
-cal information with foreign police sources:

"At the present time the investigative
activity of this Bureau is restricted, in ~
matters of this kind (communist and radical
matters) to those activities which constitute
a violation of some Federal statute.

"Very little information is obtained by
this Bureau relating to the activities of thesé
radical organizations, which. advocate the over-
throw of the United States Government. It,
follows, of course, that information of this’.
kind is of no value when existing laws do not
permit a prosecution of ‘the persons engaged
in advocating the overthrow of the Government.
I will, however, be glad to receive at any
time, information from any foreign police
department, which pertains to organizations
established for the purpose of attempting to
overthrow this Government, and will in the
event the Bureau can take no action upon the
a : information furnished transmit the information
to those Governmental agencies who may be
interested in the material obtained."

On August 24, 1936, Director Hoover, representing
the Department in the Attorney General's absence, was summoned
to The White House by President Roosevelt. As reflected. in two
memoranda by Mr. Hoover, dated August 24 and August 25, 1936,
the President "was desirous of discussing the question of the
subversive activities in the United States, particularly
Fascism and Communism." Hoover recorded that the President
stated he had been concerned about the communist and fascist
movements and "what he was interested in was obtaining a broad
picture of the general movement and its activities as may
affect the economic and political life of the country as a
whole."

NW 68262 Docld:32989536 Page 174. .



The President inquired what suggestions Hoover might offer
_relative to this matter. Hoover recorded that he responded
to the President as follows:

"I told him that the appropriation of the
’ Federal Bureau of Investigation contains a
provision that it might investigate any matters
referred to it by the Department of State and
that if the State Department should ask for ,.-
us to conduct such an investigation we could
do so under our present authority in the -

appropriation already granted." (Emphasis - 7 ie
aged} ; BEE EeEEEEEEEe

On careful reading, and examination in light of the
historic setting, it is apparent that the President and Hoover
were talking about money, not jurisdictional limits. The
President wanted a Broad intelligence investigation conducted
not for purposes of prosecution and inquired.of Hoover if the
FBI could supply the product. Hoover responded by. informing”
.the President that money had been appropriated by Congress
“under the Appropriations Act and to activate the provisions
for justifiably using the funds would require a request from
the Secretary of State. The FBI could, of course,.
investigations for which Congress had not provided appropriations.
The final topic discussed at the August 24, 1936, meeting was the
President's desire that Hoover coordinate the investigation with
the "Military and Naval Intelligence Services."

The entry of the Bureau into the new field of domestic
security intelligence investigations necessitated the creation
of administrative procedures to handle the incoming information.
By memorandum dated August 28, 1936, an assistant submitted a
tentative outline for the manner in which it was recommended
information concerning subversive activities be maintained at
Headquarters. ‘He outlined the following -"general classifications":
Maritime Industry, Government affairs, steel industry, coal
industry, newspaper field, clothing, garment, and fur industry,”
general strike activities, Armed Forces, edudational institutions,
general activities--Communist and Affiliated Organizations,
Fascisti, Anti-Fascisti movements, and activities in Organized
Labor organizations. Mr. Hoover noted on the memorandum that
this was a good beginning.

.By letter of October 20, 1938, Attorney General
Homer Cummings forwarded to the President a memorandum from
Director Hoover wherein Hoover outlined for the President
the general scope of the FBI intelligence effort and the areas
of coverage being afforded.

"In order that there may be a clear view
of the detailed information covered, there is
set forth the following break-up of the various
subjects that appear in the files of the
Intelligence Section; Maritime; government;
industry (steel, automobile, coal mining, and
miscellaneous); general strike; armed forces;
educational institutions; Fascisti;, Nazi;
organized labor; Negroes, youth; strikes;
newspaper field; and miscellaneous. | Any
information of a subversive or general intelli-
gence character pertaining to any of the above
is received at the FBI headquarters at the
Seat cf Government and is reviewed, summarized,
and placed upon editorial cards which are
filed by name of the subject matter, as well as
by name of the individual, so that it is en-
tirely possible to find in the index the col-
lection of names of individuals engaged in any
particular activity, either in any section of
the country or in a particular industry or
movement. Indicative of the present size ‘of
this index, there are approximately 2,500
names now in the index of the various types
of individuals engaged in activities of
Communism, Nazism, and various types of foreign
espionage." (Emphasis Added)

Additional legislation was apparently not deemed
‘ + necessary by officials of the Department and the Bureau.

Attorney General Homer Cummings (1938):
-"No additional legislation to accomplish the
general objectives seems to be required."

Former Director J. Edgar Hoover (1938):

“Such expansion -in the FBI as may be desired
and may become necessary can be covered, it is

NW 68262 Docld:32989536 Page 176



_ believed, under present provisions existing
in the annual appropriations bill. of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation,.... : Under
this provision investigations have been
‘conducted in years past for the State
Department of matters which do not in
themselves constitute a specific violation
of a Federal Criminal Statute, such as 7
subversive activities. Consequently, this.
provision is believed to be sufficiently
broad to cover any expansion of the present
intelligence and counterespionage work which
it may be deemed necessary to carry on."

Recommendations of Departmental and
Bureau officials in considering the necessity
for the issuance of a Presidential directive
(1939):

"Formal order on the part of the
President would hardly be needed to accom-
plish this result" (centralization of in-
vestigative responsibility.) "All that would
be required from him would be a letter to
each department head."

President Roosevelt, on November 2, 1938, personally
advised the former Director that he approved of Hoover's plan,
thus confirming that there was a meeting of the minds among

the primary participants.

The world situation steadily worsened during the
1930's. Amid this chaotic world situation the United States
attempted to stand neutral; nevertheless, the danger of potential
espionage, sabotage, and subversion was of paramount concern.

Various Federal investigative agencies commenced
uncoordinated and decentralized investigation of reports of
subversion. Some even prompted local citizens' groups to
assist their efforts, much reminiscent of the American Pro-
tective League and various ad hoc groups formed for the same
purpose during World War I. In response to this growing problem,
the Bureau recommended remedial action through the Attorney
General which resulted in a letter dated February 7, 1939, being
directed to various Federal department heads from Joseph B.
Keenan, Assistant to the Attorney General, which stated in part:

-7-

NW 68262 Docid:32989536 Page 177 _



"I take pleasure in informing you that
in cooperation with the Military Intelligence
Division of the War Department, the Federal
Bureau of Investigation of the Department of
Justice has undertaken to investigate matters
relating to espionage and subversive activities.

"In order that such matters be handled
expeditiously, it will be appreciated if you
will instruct your personnel that in case any
information is received concerning the above-
mentioned matters such information should be
promptly forwarded to the nearest field office
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation."

Here was a direct effort of the Department and the
FBI to prevent the confusion, delays, and violation of personal
rights incident to such investigations during the previous war.

Nevertheless, the letter of February 7, 1939, was

virtually ignored by other agencies, and a cumbersome committee
system, under the direction of the Undersecretary of State,
was inaugurated. The committee was composed of representatives
of the War, Navy, Treasury, Post Office, and Justice Departments,
in addition to the State Départment, whose function it was to
receive information of a subversive nature, make an analysis,
and then forward the matter to the agency deemed most suited to
handle the investigation. The bulk of the matters were referred
to the FBI and the military and naval intelligence services.
The previous arrangement, based on the President's desires of
1936, was completely ignored, causing a waste of prior efforts
and accumulated information, delays in referral of cases, and
general confusion.

. . The Department and Bureau prepared a memorandum dated
June 5, 1939, containing ideas and recommendations to be pre-
sented to the President in an effort to resolve the controversy.

"For the reasons outlined above it is
recommended that the definite steps be taken--
first, that the interdepartmental committee
described in the first paragraph of this memor-

7 andum be abandénéd and that in its place the
investigation of all espionage, counter-espionage
and sabotage cases be cohtrolled in the Intelli-
gence Divisions of the War and Navy Departments

NW 68262 Docid:32989536 Page 178



and the Federal Bureau of Investigation and that
“the directors of these three agencies function
in the capacity of a committee to coordinate the
activities of the three agenciés named. Second,
that confidential: instructions should bé issued.
by the President to the heads of all government
departments except War, Navy, and Justice, in-
structing that absolutely no investigations shall
: be conducted by the investigative agencies of
7 those departments into cases involving actually
or potentially espionage, counter-espionage or
sabotage. . The heads of all government depart-
ments should be instructed in this order to
refer immediately through existing channels
direct to the nearest office of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation any data, information
or material pertaining to cases of this type.
Formal order on-the part of the President
would hardly be needed in order to accomplish
this result. All that would be required from
him would be a letter to each department head."

This recommended procedure, concurred in by President
Roosevelt, resulted in the confidential Presidential Directive
of June 26, 1939, which reads: i i

: "It is my desire that the investigation of

all espionage, counterespionage, and sabotage

matters be controlled and handled by the Federal ..

Bureau of Investigation of the Department of Justice

the Military Intelligence Division of the War 2 ery
Department, and the Office of Naval Intelligence of

the Navy Department. The directors of these three
agencies are to function as a committee to

coordinate their activities.

"No investigations should .be conducted by
any investigative agency of the Government into
Matters involving actually or potentially any
espionage, counterespionage, or sabotage, ex-
cept by the three agencies mentioned above.

"I shall be glad if you will instruct the
heads of all other investigative agencies than
the three named, to refer immediately to the

~9-

| NW 68262 Docid:32989536 Page 179



nearest office of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation any data, information, or
Material that may come to their notice
bearing directly or indirectly on espionage,
-counterespionage, or sabotage."

The overall problem was not, however, Rati resolved
with the Directive of June 26, 1939. Reports were frequently
received in Washington indicating that various local police
authorities were forming “sabotage squads" and the like and,
therefore, further clarification was deemed necessary.

The Department and FBI again Liniae to the President
to resolve the question.

At 6:20 p.m. on September 6, 1939, the Attorney ‘General
reached Mr. E. A. Tamm, Assistant Director, and advised him as
is reflected in Mr. Tamm's memorandum dated September 6, 1939.

"The Attorney General called and stated
that the President issued the order today. He
stated it reads, in part, as follows:

"President Roosevelt today requested all
local law enforcement officers to cooperate
with the FBI in the drive against espionage,
sabotage, subversive activities, and violation
of the neutrality laws. Mr. Roosevelt issued
a formal statement requesting all police
officers, sheriffs, and other law enforcement
officers to transmit to the G-Men all infor-
mation’ bearing on such cases. This task
must be conducted in a comprehensive and
effective manner on a national basis and all
information must be carefully sifted out and
co-related in order. to avoid confusion and
irresponsibility. To this end I request all
police officers, sheriffs, and all other law
enforcement officers in the United States
promptly to turn over to the nearest represent-
ative of the Federal Bureau of Investigation
any information obtained by them relating to
espionage, counter-espionage, sabotage, sub-
versive activities, and violation of the
neutrality laws."

The Presidential ‘Directives of June 26 and September 6,
1939, were apparently not issued for the sole purpose of fully
describing the scope of FBI domestic and foreign security intelli-
gence investigative jurisdiction, but rather were issued to
place and finalize investigative authority in the FBI and the
military intelligence services over those areas of jurisdiction
where conflicts were developing. It should be noted, however,
the subject matter of the President's instructions regarding
domestic security intelligence investigations ‘6f 1936, as re-.
affirmed in 1938, is also addressed in the Directive of
September 6, 1939, thus tending to confirm the President's
intent that the FBI and military services handle all matters ,
relating to foreign and domestic security intelligence investi-
gations. To coordinate their efforts, the FBI and the military
intelligence services formed the Interdepartmental Intelligence
Conference (IIC). :

The manner in which the FBI and the military intelli-
gence services delineated their respective responsibilities is
reflected in a series of Delimitations Agreements of June 5,
1940, February 9, 1942, and February 23, 1949. Each of these
Delimitations Agreements generally cites in the preamb gthat
in conformity with the Presidential Directive 6f Sune 26% 1939,
as augmented by the Directive of September 6, 1939, investi-
gation of all "espionage, counterespionage, sabotage, and sub-
versive activities (or subversion) will be delimited" as
therein described. .

The Delimitations Agreements.of 1940, 1942, and 1949,
‘stated that the FBI shall investigate those matters involving
citizens and foreign nationals or foreign-directed activity in
certain geographic areas, including the United States, and,
among other duties, shall advise the military of "cases of
actual or strongly presumptive espionage or -sabotage, .including
the names of individuals definitely known to be connected with
subversive activities" (1940 and 1942) or "developments con-
cerning the strength, compoSition, and intentions of civilian
groups within its cognizance which are classed as subversive and
whose activities are a potential danger to the security of the
United States" (1949).

The IIC as an independent committee ceased to exist
as, pursuant to the National Security Act of 1947, which formed
the National Security Council (NCS), it was absorbed and
chartered by the NSC, presided over by the President. The IIC-
charter issued by NSC dated July 18, 1949, reads in part:

-ll-

NW 68262 Docld:32989536 Page 181



"Pursuant to the provisions of Section 101
of the National Security Act and NSC 17/4 as
approved by the President, the National Security
Council hereby authorizes and directs that the.
Interdepartmental Intelligence Conference effect
the coordination of all investigation of domestic
espionage, counterespionage, sabotage, sub-
version, and other related intelligence matters
affecting internal security.

"“(1) The Interdepartmental Intelligence
Conference shall be’ constituted as set forth in
the Presidential Directive of June 26, 1939,
that is, the Director of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, the Director of the Intelligence
Division of the Army, the Director of Naval
Intelligence, and in addition, the Director,
Office of Special Investigations, U. S. Air
Force, which office has been created since the-
issuance of the original Presidential Directive.

"D. Nothing herein shall be construed.as
modifying or affecting the Presidential
Directives issued to the members of the IIC
relating to their individual responsibilities
and duties. The Delimitations Agreement among
the members.of the IIC relating to the investi-
: _ , gative responsibilities and duties of the in-

7 dividual members and other agreements among

: these members relating to the same matters
shall remain in full force and effect and shall
continue to be amended, changed, and supple-
mented at the discretion of the IIc." -

Thus, it was reaffirmed on Presidential atithority
through the charter of the, IIC-that the Presidential Directive
of June 26, 1939, as mentioned in the charter and the Delimi-
tations Agreement, and the Directive of September 6, 1939, as
contained in the Delimitations Agreement, were not to be
modified or affected and, through the agreement, were to remain
in full force and effect.

The Presidential intent has also been manifested and
reaffirmed through the issuance of subsequent Directives by
President Roosevelt on January 8, 1943, President Truman on
July 24, 1950, and President Eisenhower on December 15, 1953.

Such reissuances appear to occur to reinforce and remind in-
terested parties of this intent during times of national
peril--1943, during the height of WW II; 1950, during the
Korean conflict; and 1953, during the Cold War era and enact-
ment of the Atomic Energy Act.

On dune 9, 1962, President John F. Kennedy executed
National Security Action Memorandum 161, wherein he stated in
part:

"2. Accordingly, I have directed that the
two interdepartmental committees concerned
with internal security--the Interdepartmental

Intelligence Conference (IIC) and the Inter-
departmental Committee on Internal Security

: (ICIS)--which, have been under the supervision

of the National Security Council, will be
transferred to the supervision of the Attorney
General. The continuing need for these com-
mittees and their relationship to the Attorney
General will be matters for the Attorney General
to determine."

On March 5, 1964, the Attorney General directed a
charter to the IIC which is identical to the charter issued by
the NSC in 1949, save for the issuing authority being the
Attorney General in place of the NSC. Since that time, the
FBI has operated in the field of foreign counterintelligence and
domestic security investigations under the overall supervision
of the Attorney General.

In addition to the reaffirmation of the Presidential
intent, the Attorney General has codified his instructions that
the FBI Handle such matters in 28 CFR, Section 0.85(d):

“Carry out the Presidential directive of
September 6, 1939, as reaffirmed by Presidential
directives of January 8, 1943, July 24, 1950,
and December 15, 1953, designating the (FBI) to
take charge of investigative work in matters re-
lating to espionage, sabotage, subversive activ-
ities, and related matters."

eo o s

The FBI, in addition, is responsible for the investi-
_gation of numerous Federal statutory violations, many inherently
addressing the field of domestic subversion and extremist ”
‘activities, as well as for retaining material and conducting
such investigations as are necessary and proper under the Federal
Employee Loyalty Program.

As has been illustrated, the FBI, since World War I,

has been the recognized Federal agency to conduct investigations
of a national security nature, and, since 1936, has been
authorized to engage in domestic security intelligence’ investi-
gations through a series of Presidential Directives, as reaf-
firmed, Executive Branch charters, and through the parallel
interest generated in the duty to investigate statutory violations
in-the field. : 7

Honorable Richard S. Schweiker
United States Senate
Washington, D.C. 20510

Dear Senator Schweiker:

At the hearing before the Select Committee on
Intelligence Activities, you asked me to comment on a
specific provision from the FBI Manual of Rules and
Regulations. As I told you at the hearing, through
some misunderstanding, I had not seen that. provision
until almost immediately before the afternoon session of
. the Committee began and indeed while I was at the witness
table. I did not have an opportunity to check the specific
provision or to know about its origin. My statement that
I was sure it did not represent present policy represented
“my firm belief.

I note that according to the press reports that
a Bureau spokesman later in the day informed a reporter
that the statement is still in the manual and that it does
represent Bureau policy. I am writing this letter to you,
with a copy to Senator Church, because I would not wish
to mislead the Select Committee in any way.

I do believe, however, some further explanation
| is in order. First, the Bureau informs me that the
provision has not been interpreted to mean that an investiga-
tion should not take place and that "any interpretation
that an investigation would not be instituted because
of the possibility of embarrassment to the Bureau was never
intended and, in fact, has never been the policy of this
Bureau." I am told that "what was intended to be conveyed
was that in such eventuality FBI Headquarters desired to
be advised of the matter before investigation is instituted
so that Headquarters would be on notice and could direct
= the inquiry, if necessary."

: Second, the manual provision dates back to
March 30, 1955.

Third, I am informed by the Bureau that
“immediate steps are being taken to remove that phraseology
from our Manual of Rules and Regulations."

Sincerely,

' Raward H: Levi

This informative memorandum, for record purposes, li a
reports on conference 11/10/75 between Bureau and Senate
Select Committee (SSC) personnel concerfiing informarit matters.

Attached is a copy of an 11/7/75 letter, with
attachment, which served as a basis for the conference which
was requested by SSC Staff Member Bob Kelley, The letter sal;
covered three principal items: (1) a paper which the SSC ins
invites us to prepare concerning informant matters, (2) a Yb bt
request for additional documents, and (3) a request to jet ri f
interview Agents who handled three former informants, Me vA

Present at the conference on behalf of the SSC
Staff were Bob Kelley, Andy Postal, David Bushong and Jeffre:
Kayden, Attendees at the conference for the Buréau were
S. F. Phillips of the Senstudy 75 Project, Supervisors E. P.

Grigalus (IS-2 Section) and H. A. Newman (IS~1 Section) of
INTD, and T, L. Sheer of the General Investigative Division,

The following matters were discussed at the
conferende. In respect to paragraph 1, page 2, of the SSC
11/7/75 letter, Kelley acknowledged error in the letter in
that the SSC is now requesting documents relating to only

one\, not two, of three former informants who are scheduled

Re: Senstudy 75
62~-116395

Agents it desired to interview, principally those who had
handled the three former informants during specified
periods; and also-indicated a desire to interview former
SAC Roy Moore who supervised the Special in which former
informant Hardy was involved. By separate correspondence
we are handling the matter relating to release from confi-
dentiality agreement of the pertinent personnel.

The conference also discussed details of the
memorandum the SSC invited us to prepare, which memorandum
would enable the Bureau to present to the SSC an overall
view of our informant program. It was agreed at the
conference that we will deal with our informant program
in the domestic field and not any aspects relating to
jassets in the counterintelligence field. Unit Chief
Grigalus was designated to coordinate and prepare the
necessary memorandum with assistance and input from Newman
and from the Criminal Informant Unit of the Special
Investigative Division, whose assistance Grigalus will
separately solicit.

None, For information and record purposes.

Dear Mike:

As.a follow-up to our briefing of Assistant Director
Wannall on November 6 concerning our proposed format and
witnesses for public hearings on December 4-5 on the FBI's
use of intelligence informants and sources, we would like
to make the following requests.

“As discussed ‘in our meeting with Mr. Wannall, we in-
vite the Bureau to submit a memorandum on its intelligence
informant and source program that could be inserted in F
the record of the testimony of Bureau representatives at
the hearing. This memorandum would enable the Bureau to-
present to the Select Committee a complete description
« of its program and to discuss the issues of particular

“interest to the Committee members. These include, for
example, 1) the size, scope and purpose of the program,
including an assessment of the program's cost and effective-
+ ness, and the distinctions and relationships between the
intelligence informant program and the Bureau's criminal
informant activity; 2) the criteria that determine when

an informant may be used in an organization or group; and

. 3) the program's command and control system, including the
- limits that are placed on the activities of informants

and the type of information an informant or source is per-

mitted to report to his handling agent and the Bureau.

In addition, the memorandum would discuss possible leg-

islation in the informant area, such as the imposition

of a warrant requirement or additional administrative re-

view. To permit the Select Committee members to study this

memorandum in advance of the hearing and to discuss it

with FBI representatives during their testimony at the pub-
lic hearing, we request that the memorandum be submitted,
by November 24, ALL BAe od ae RTD

Also I am enclosing requests for documents relating

to testify on December 4. These requests supplement our, ©
document request of August 20, 1975 pertaining to informants
(Part IV-4). a
’ In addition, we wish to interview and possibly de-
pose the Special Agents who handled the three former in-
formants (Rowe, Hardy and Cook) who are scheduled to
téstify at the public hearing on December 4. Because of
the limited time remaining before the scheduled hearings,”
‘we request’that the Special Agents be made available for

The referenced request and attechment cited 14

Supervisor S. F. Phillips of the Senstudy 75 Project on
11/7/75, Shaheen indicated he did not believe any further
written information need be given to the SSC to serve as
documentation for Levison's CP membership, Phillips suggested,

Committee an LIM along the lines ve are now taking which
will be on record with the SSC that the oral briefing was

Reference memorandum from E. W. Walsh to iit
Mr. Jenkins dated 11-6-75 captioned "Disciplinary Matters, Explanation
Concerning Manual Provisions."

During public testimony by Attorney General Levi before
the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities on 11-6-75,
Senator Richard Schweiker read a portion of the Rules and Regulations,
Part I, Section 9, Item C, dealing with disciplinary matters. The
Senator said the rule indicates that investigations will be halted because
they might "embarrass the Bureau." Referenced memorandum enclosed
a statement, prepared by the Administrative Division, explaining the
Bureau's policy in such matters, which was to be included in the record
of the hearings.

Mr. Hotis met with Senator Schweiker shortly after the!
hearings on the afternoon of 11-6-75 and requested that the Senator/itisert
an explanation of our policy into the record. He told the Senator i# was
incorrect to suggest that the purpose of the rule was to terminate, or
as the Senator put it "abort," an investigation that might prove to be
embarrassing to the Bureau. He said the purpose of the rule is simply
to insure that any incident or allegation that might discredit or undermine
the public confidence in the Bureau should be brought promptly to the
attention of Bureau Headquarters to insure that the matter is handled in
an appropriate manner. Because of the controversy surrounding the
phrase "embarrass the Bureau," however, we are revising the language
of that provision so that it will more accurately convey our policy.

Senator Schweiker said he did not intend to focus attention
on the Bureau in this matter but simply was trying to underscore the need.
for an Inspectors General Office in the Department of Justice. He said
he feels certain that other agencies of Government have similar 16 7 oy

Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams Memo
Re: SENSTUDY

He agreed that the policy is a sound one but said the rule is rather
awkwardly worded. Schweiker said he had not intended to be critical

of the Bureau and wanted Mr. Kelley to know that he has the utmost confi-
dence in his leadership of the Bureau and has said so on two national
television programs. He assured Mr. Hotis that he would insert the
Bureau's explanation into the record immediately following his questioning
of the Attorney General on the subject.

Copies of the Bureau's explanation were delivered on the
morning of 11-7-75 to Duggee Hatrey, an assistant in the Senator's office.
We were later advised by Elliott Maxwell, a staff member of the committee,
that Senator Schweiker asked him to make certain that this explanation
appeared in the record of the hearings.

SUBJECT

Telephone Rm. —
Director Sec’y —

This memorandum recommends urgently needed ; a
consideration by Legal Counsel Division (LCD) of vital ()
issues in the Senate Select Committee (SSC) review of the

Martin Luther King, Jr., investigation and conference of
appropriate Bureau officials to establish Bureau's position
in respect to forthcoming SSC hearings on King matter.

Legal Counsel to Mr. J. B, Adams memorandum,
11/5/75, “Testimony and Furnishing of Information to
Congressional Committees" (copy attached), reports the
formation of a White House group tasked to keep the
White House advised of problems which the various Congressional
dommittees' requests and/or testimony before such committees
might create, Assistant Attorney General (AG) Rex Lee,
Civil Division, is Department's representative in group.
The existence of this newly created group and the imminence
of scheduled SSC hearings on the King matter in about
10 days makes imperative Bureau considerations and setting
of policy relating to special problems discussed below.

By way of background, we have furnished the SSC l
a large volume of documentary material from our files ‘
concerning the King and related matters. Additional infor- OF
mation has been given to the SSC through the medium of its.“
interviews of current and former FBI employees, as well as
through a special, highly classified personal briefing of

hai ator Church and selected SSC Staff Members by Bureau

Memorandum to Mr, W. R. Wannall
Re: Senstudy 75
62-116395

personnel, Two key issues should be noted: (1) In the vast
majority of instances we have excised, from material given

the SSC, vital information relating to King's subversive
connections and personal life because the SSC specifically
requested we excise information whith is the product of
electronic surveillances of King and because information
might lead to identities of extremely valuable Bureau informants
(SOLO operations). (2) We have also not furnished the SSC
very enlightening Bureau documents regarding King again at

the specific request of the SSC to not furnish Bureau
monographs containing King data, For your information,
prohibition to furnishing product of electronic surveillances
on King results from certain agreements between the SSC and
the attorney for Mrs. King, apparently because, from the

best information we have, the King family desires no publicity
relating to the former investigation of King.

If the SSC goes forward with its current plans
for hearings on the King matter, public and/or executive
session, very serious problems are anticipated, These are
primarily two in number, one relating to privacy considerations,
the other relating to the Bureau possibly being placed in the
untenable position of defending or explaining past actions
and judgements but not being able to put forth the full facts
supportive to those actions and judgements. To put it
plainly, are we going to “enter the ring with one arm tied
behind our backs?"

Also entering our study of this matter is the
necessity for securing Departmental backing for whatever
position we think is the best one to take. Again, in view
of the imminence of the hearings, alacrity in proceeding
with the action recommended is urged.

ACTIONS:

1. LCD immediately give needéd consideration to
the vital issues outlined above and advise:

(A) Whether privacy considerations will
inhibit Bureau testimony.

(B) Whether the Bureau should allow the
SSC to dictate the scope of the Bureau
testimony in a manner which will
prohibit full disclosure of all the facts.

| 2. After LCD formulates recommendations as to

(A) and (B) above, conference of appropriate Bureau officials
should be convened to resolve these important pending issues.

It is suggested, as a minimum, conference include Messrs. J. B.

U. § Senate Select Committee

With Respect to Intelligence Activities (SSC)

Re: Interview of Former FBI Special Agent (SA)
George CG. Moore by SSC Staff Members

At 2:00 p.m., September 29, 1975, I appeared at the
Dirksen Senate Office Building at the request of Staff Member
James Dick to be interviewed regarding NSA monitoring activities.

(As a matter ef interest, while waiting in the reception
room for Mr, Dick, I was approached by Mr. John ELLif£ who
introduced himself and asked if I remembered meeting him in
the office of former Assistant Director C. D. Brennan about four
years ago. I did not remember him and so informed hin. He
stated that sometime in the next several weeks he would contact
me in order to discuss a number of things, I told him that I
would a) available in the afternoons but desived some advance
notice.

The captioned interview commenced at about 2:05 p.m
and lasted about one hour and 30 minutes. It was conducted by
Mr. James Dick accompanied by Mr. Peter Fem, both members of
the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Staff, The interview
was tecorded by a stenotypist who was described as a "court
reporter." I was not placed under oath but was advised that I
would be asked to come back to read the typed transcript and
to swear as to its authenticity before a Senator from the
Committee, I was told that I could have the benefit of counsel
if so desixed. I did not desire such.

The focus of the interview was directed almost solely
on my knowledge of NSA's monitoring activities with respect to
U. S. citizens and, in particular, was directed at my knowledge
as to when such monitoring commenced and stopped and the nature
of the administrative matters surrounding this activity,



U. S. Senate Select Committee

With Respect to Intelligence Activities (SSC)

Re: Interview of Former FBI Special Agent (SA)
George ©. Moore by SSC Staff Members

Duting the interview, I was shown a letter prepared
during October, 1970, by Special Agent Joseph Michela with
attached list of individuals and organizations directed to NSA
vequesting NSA coverage, My initials appeared as one of those
approving the letter and I verified such and related my knowledge
of events leading up to the preparation of the letter, namely
an earlier briefing by NSA people of various representatives
of Division 5 in which we were told what NSA could produce for

“us and at which time we were encouraged to request such by a
letter such as the Oetober, 1970, letter,

Qther FBI documents (copies) which were exhibited to
me were two other letters prepared members of the Extremist
Section (dates not remembered by me but letters were prepared
by William H, Atkinson and Roger §. Young). I was also showt
a copy o£ a letter prepared by fT. J. Smith to the Attorney
General dated in 1973 which discontinued our cooperation with
NSA in this matter as a result of the Keith decision,

A number of questions were asked as to meaning of
some of the phraselogy in Smith's letter as well as what appeared
to be statements inconsistent with above previous-mentioned
letters. Im essence, I told them that T, J. Smith would be the
proper person to answer those questions and not me. I also told
them that I did not help prepare the letter.

They were interested in the identities of NSA people
who came over to the FBI to give the original briefing. I
could not recall any of their identities,

They seemed vary interested in why the October, 1970,
letter was written, who approved it and whether Director Hoover
saw it. As to the latter question, theze was no initial of
the Director but he could not tell from the Xerox whether it
passed through his office,

U. S&S Senate Select Committee
to Study Governmental Operations
With Respect to Intelligence Activities (SSC)

Re: Interview of Former FBI Special Agent (SA)
George G. Moore by SSG Staff Members

I was pressed by a series of questions as to whether
I had ever made oral requests of NSA not confirmed by letter.
I advised that I recalled being in telephone contact on several
occasions with a “liaison contact" at NSA but believed it was
mainly as a result of his calling me and my returning his call,
I stated that although my recoilection is such that I did not
recall making oral requests, I could not make a firm denial as
I just eould not recall, (I also could not recall the name of
this person at NSA who initiated the calls). Finally, I told
Mx. Dick that if he had any information indicating I had made
such a request which would refresh my memory, such would be
helpful. He then advised that he did have information such
requests were made by others in the FBI orally but not by me,

He also wanted to know my assessment as to the quantity
and quality of information furnished. He was advised that the
quantity was extremely small and I could not judge or evaluate
quality at this date without seeing the product again,

I tried to stress throughout that actually we got very
little as a result of these requests and that we considered
such requests to be quite normal and not sinister and really
nothing to have made such an impact on ones memory as to be
remembered through the years. Also, I furnished my opinion that
we did not consider such monitoring or requests to be "illegal"
at least prior to the Keith decision.

In addition to the above, the interviewers were
advised of a briefing given to a small group of NSA employees
re "Foreign Influence in Extremist Matters" given by former
SA CG. E. Glass and me sometime after October, 1970.

Staff Member Fenn showed me a couple of documents re
Army's request for NSA monitoring, copies of which had been
furnished the FBI according to copies displayed. I did not recall
ever having seen them,

RE: THTERVIE OF MRS. ENYA D. METCALP,
AUMINISERATLVE ASSISTANT TO TUS DIRECTOR
OF THE FBI, BY SSC STAPF MEMBERS

The following pertains to an interview of Mre. Metcalf
by SSG Staff Members. .

On September 2, 1975, 85C Staff Member Nark Gitenstein
requested of the Legal Counsel Division of the FBI that
Mrs, Metcalf, among others, be made available for a Staff
interview concerning her knowledge of the “official and
confidential” files which were mainbained in the office of
Mx. J. Edgar Hoover, the late Director of the FBI. Mrs. Metcalf
had been previously interviewed by personnel of the FBI's
Inspection Division during an inquiry of the “official and
confidential” files matter which was conducted at the request
of the Department of Justice. The SSC has been previously
furnished a summary of the results of that inquiry and has
reviewed FD-302s reporting the results of interviews of
employees concerning the matter, Director Clarence M. Kelley
of this Bureau approved the release of Mrs, Metcalf from
existing employment agreement, for the purpose of the SSC Staff
interview. There foliows the report of the interview of
ties, Metcalf as furnished by her.

On Tuesday, October 21, 1975, I was interviewed by

Mary DeOreo and Mark Gitenstein, at the Bureau in Assistant
Director John Wintz's office. Interview commenced at 9:35 Ait

Re: Interview of Mrs. #zma D. Metcalf,
Administrative Assistant to the Director
of the FBI, by SSG Staff Members

The questioning started about when I entered on duty
in the Bureau and when I was assigned to Director Hoover's
office and the positions held in that office. I was shown a
sketch which I understood had been drawn by Miss Gandy reflect~
ing the physical layout of Director Hoover's office and using
this layout, I told them that when I was first assigned to the
Director's office, I was secretary to Mr. Holloman and pointed
out where my desk was located and that I was not in the immediate
office with Miss Gandy until 1963.

LT was asked about whether Mr. loover may have confused
personal files and official-confidential (OC) files and I told
them { certainly felt that was not the case. I was told that in
some of the files there would be a “buck-slip" with ‘P.r."
written on it and was asked whether the Director wrote these or
Miss Gandy, and that was why they asked if Mr. Hoover might
have confused the two. I was told that actually they could not
tell in some instances Lf it was Miss Candy's writing or the
Director's and that there were several, particularly during 1963.
I told them that I was sorry but I could not help them, that
actually I was on sick leave in May, 1963, and again from June,
1963, until January, 1964. I was asked who would have been on
my desk during that period and I toid them Miss Ruth McCord.

Mr. Gitenstein indicated that it had been learned from
a previous interview that there were approximately 11 file
eabinets in the office contalning personal files and 0¢ files
and that an index was kept. I toid them that was my recollection
and of those, two drawers were the OC files and these were in
two bottom drawers of one cabinet and that actually, there was
a table in front of those drawers with reference books and
such kept on top and in order to get to those files, indicating
there was certainly not much reference to them, Jt was necessary
to pull that table out to get to then. As to the index, it
was one index, and to distinguish personal files from Oc files,

Re: Interview of Mrs. Exma D. Metcalf,
Administrative Assistant to the Director
of the FBI, by SSC Staff Members

the 0C files were indexed on pink cards and personal files

on white. I was asked if those files were encased in a cabinet,
and I told them they were not, that they were merely filing
cases; however, in back of Miss Gandy's desk were, I believed
if I recalled correctly, four two-drawer filing cabinets,
stacked, which were in a cabinet built for them and these
contained strictly Mr. Hoover's investment and financial records.
I was asked if in the personal files there were any files such
as on telephone bills or the like. I told them there was not,
but that in one cabinet there were 2 or 3 drawers which

Miss Gandy maintained on such things as telephone and matters
pertaining strictly to the maintenance of Mr. Hoover's house.

In regard to the 0C files, I informed them that tiose
were sent to Mr. Felt during the week of Mr. Hoover's death as
well as pulling the pink index cards, which were then sent to
Mr. Felt. ZL was shown a listing of files in the 0C files and
was asked if I had prepared it. 4 told them I had and was
asked about the two dates, one in Octaber, 1971, as I recall,
which had been scratched out and the date of 4- ~72 written over
it. I told them that I had a very hazy recollection, but it
seemed that Miss Gandy had indicated the Director wanted a
listing of the OC files and the one in October was prepared;
that Mr. Hoover before his death had started going through his
personal files and indicating which were to be destroyed or kept
and in those were a few which he indicated should go in the OC
files. Upon being questioned as to how this was physically
handled, I told them that I would pull the files, place them in
a work box and Miss Gandy would take them in to the Director and
the Director indicated to her his desires and she would so
indicate by putting a notation on the file itself. I said that
I would then destroy the ones so indicated and would pull the
index cards from the index pertaining to those. Mr. Gitenstein

Re: Intervlow of Mrs. grea D. Metcalf,
Administrative Assistant to the Director
of the FUE, by SSC Staff Members

pointed out that some of the Listiny was single spaced and
most double spaced ond askad Lf those vould show some of the
personal files ware indicated for OG by the Director and were
merely added in and since most of the single spaced items were
at the beginning of the alphabat, dow: Inte the "B's," that
Hx. Loover had gotten through that mmy of his personal files,
and I told him ft felt that was the case. In regard to some other
single spaced items later in the alphabet, I tofd him that I
fakt in preparing the list originally, I had gotten onc or two
out of order alphabetically and xather than d3 over the page,
did it that way,

As to the October date boing scratched out and the
4= -72 date written over it, I said that i felt that it was an
error on my part, that imstead of putting 5 (for ay), parkicu-
havly since it vas right at the bepimming of tha month, £
inadvertently wrote "4" inskead of "5." E was quentioned
about the check marks appearing beside the Listing soma of which
had 2 check marks, and £ said that 1 checked the isting against
the actual files and checked them off and where there were 2
checks, I had probably starced checking the List and was
interrupted and simply started over again.

In regurd te the destruction of the personal files,
thoy vere primarily interested in ones sent to Mx. Moover's
home and why and asked if I recalled » conversation lilss Gandy
had with tir. Gray and Mr. Pelt pertaining to furnishing a room
at the Bureau where Hiss Gandy could continue working on the
| files ond it was decided they could be sent to Mr. Hoover's
| home there Miss Gandy could continue to work on thea, I told
them I recalled Mix. Gray being in the office a couple of tines
er so, once when he held an Exceutives Conference and a time or
two when he stopped in and his talking to Miss Gandy, bat that
T wont ohead with my work and was not a party to the conversatlon
and therefere did not pay any attention.

Res Interview of Iirs. Erma D, Metcalf,
Administrative Assistant to the Director
of the FBI, by SSG Staff Members

T was asked ahout the index for the personal files
and I said it was destroyed. They asked about the procedure of
destroying the personal files and I advised I started at one
end and Miss Gandy, of course, was occupied with Mr. Hoover's
office and packing up the library, etc., and she was working
om the other end of the alphabet; i was asked if as the files
were destroyed they were checked as to whether anything should
go into the 0G files and whether letterheads or any other manner
was used as criteria and I told them that was not the case as
actually letterheads would really not be good criteria; that
it was simply a matter of judgment and, of course, having worked
with the files, I would be familiar with the content of a lot of
them. I also sald that while we had files on all the honors
and awards to the Director, they were merely copies of material
in Bureau files. I was asked if im going through the personal
files, any were pulled and placed in the 0C files and I told
them I recalled none being added to the OC files other than
the ones added by Mr. llnover prior to his death, They asked
if any files were pulled from the personal files not for
destruction and E stated I recalled one which pertained te an
honor or award Mr. Hoover had received from Romania, I believed,
although I could not be sure, which I gave to Miss Gandy inasmuch
as I felt it should go back to the State Department or some
such procedure followed. I was asked if there were any flles in
the prrare files which were not correspondence and I said I
sould cite one example and that pertained to Mr. Hoover's doss -
their licenses, shots, ctc. I was asked if, when a personal
file was pulled and destroyed, at thak time the index cards were
pulled and destroyed, and I teld them that was not the case,
that it would be too time-consuming to pull the cards individ-
ually and that they were destroyed all at once, after, of course,
having pulled the pink OC index cards which were sent to Mr. Felt.

fL was asked tn cormection with the destruction of the
personal files whether someone from the Vashington Field Office
came over with au Agent with him to get the material for destruction.

Re; Interview of Mrs. Erna D. Metcalf,
Administrative Assistant to the Director
of the FBI, by §SC Staff Members

I advised that at the beginning, I was simply tearing them up
and putting them in the confidential trash basket, but due to
the quantity of it, I was borrowing confidential trash baskets
and then we started getting the big trash bags and that someone
from Washington Field would come over to get it for disposal,
They questioned about whether any of it was in boxes which were
sealed and then picked up, and I told them that 1 remembered the
bags and have a fecollection that probably not having bags handy,
the material was torn up and placed in boxes, as I recall, trying
to arrange the material in the box so as to make it more compact
end more room to add more material for destruction.

In regard te the personal files which went to
Mr. Hoover*s house, I was asked if I recalled how this was done,
and I told them I was sorry, but I simply could not recall.
was also asked if there was a time when we said it was done and
over, that the job had been completed. I told them I could not
say that it actually came wp, tha it was strictly a matter of
being in shock, trying to clean out after someone has passed
away, to make room for someone else to come in,

I was asked whether I had ever been out to Hr. doover's
home, particularly after his death. I told them I had not
been to ix. Hoover's hone since his death; however, when Miss
Gandy was on leave and I was covering her desk, each Saturday
a pouch of work was taken out to Mr. Hoover's home and I merely
went to the house to deliver the pouch, but did not enter. I
was agked if I was in contact with Miss Gandy while she was
still working at the house on the files and any discussion was
had concerning them and I told him that Miss Gandy is a friend
of mine and we do cali each other sccasionally and sometimes
meet for dinner, bat these are and were merely social and we did
not discuss such things.
