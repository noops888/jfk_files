(5) LIFEAT/Exile

vided information of interest to KUSARK on E-l's planned travel and the delays

Commnist from the country of concern to that Station.

In addition to the FIRRETO coverage mentioned in

provided to the local ODINVY office irom the coverage of David DRUCKER, Charles

SMALL (ake SMOLIKOFF) and Noah and Anna SEBORER has been evaluated as valuaole

by: that office. It is particularly useful in covering movements of American

is now apparent that in his retired
