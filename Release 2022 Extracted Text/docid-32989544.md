Ultimately it ended in a split of my small group on

whether we should carry our newly raised consciousness

of that need.

"When sisters want us to, we go to court with them.

When I go to court I find that it can do bad things to my

All judges are pigs.

years when she shouldn't have gotten anything at all.

"I was in the House of Detention when there was the

bail fund demonstration on December 20, 1970.

The whole

tier was so excited. When someone saw the first people she

let out a scream and everyone rushed to the windows.

the chanting increased outside we started to sing and chant.

They locked us in our cells so each person would be isolated

and intimidated about chanting.

But all the women kept it

Everyone inside said the feeling about this demonstration

was different than other demonstrations.

There had been more

contact. The women saw Afeni and Joan and another woman

that they had known inside outside in the demonstration.

DATE:

Re New York airtel and IHM, 8/28/72, and captioned

as above.

on 11/28/72, INFORMANT advised the Women's Bail Fund,

(WBF) is not a leading element and lacks any influence in the

movement in New York City.

A review of the subject file discloses there is no

structure to the WBF and that it is a coalition of women who

belong to various groups in the New York City area,

, whose main

purpose is to raise funds for selected women in jail.

It is noted that Weatherman subjects have contacted

those involved in the bail fund.

However, have decryed the

lack of political diréction of

the WBF and would like to turn

it into a defense committee because of a lack of any other

direction. There is no indication, that this has occurred, and

the bail fund still remains a loose coalition oi like-minded :.

individuals irom various groups seerino to suise duids for

various purposes. Because of its lack of common political, dir.

ection, it has had no influence and presently is ineffective in

the movement.

In view of the above, the NYO is discontinuing investi-

gation in thies. matter

as a structured group for a common political and ideological

purpose.

Re: Vincent Hallinan

Vincent Hallinan was candidate for President

or tne united states on the Independent Progressive Party

ticket in 1952.

This party was formed in California in 1948

and ceased to exist in 1954, when it failed to poll sufficient

votes to remain on a California ballot.

The California

Senate Fact-Finding Committee on Un-American Activities in

its 1955 report on page forty-six, states in part that the

Independent Progressive Party in California was quickly

stock and'barrel by the Communist Party of California.

A source advised on April 20, 1966, that Vincent

Hallinan was the Treasurer for American Institue For Marxist

Studies (AIMS).

A characterization of AIMS

YOU CANNOT HAVE

WARS WITHOUT

WOMEN

Women must use their minds, their voices, and

their bodies to stop the killing in Vietnam; to do

less is to ignore our special responsibilities to

the human race.

"10, 000 women have sat back and let their sons

be killed in Vietnam. If we had 10, 000 women

willing to go to jail if necessary we could stop

the war in Vietnam. You cannot have wars with-

out women. "

Jeannette Rankin made the above statement in

May of this year. Fifty years ago, as the first

woman elected to Congress, she voted against

World War I. She has consistently maintained

her struggle for peace, and at 86 she is as coura-

geous and vigorous as ever--an inspiration to all

women.

The presence of the United States forces in the int

•ernal struggle of Vietnam is immoral and illegal.

There can be no possible justification for our inte

ference in the domestic affairs of this tiny distant

land.

This 86-year-old woman has stated that she is wil

ing to stay in jail until the bombing is stopped. N

all women are free to join her, but we can assure

her' that thousands of women will march peacefull

beside her. Some will picket, others will go to ja

with Miss Rankin. Every woman's participation i

equally valuable. We are confident each one will

the maximum of which she is capable.

On January 8th, women from all over the land wil

converge on Washington to demand the end of this

dishonorable wai. We shall come as individuals,

or as organizations, but we shall join together as

concerned women under the aegis of Jeannette Rai

SEATTLE WOMEN ACT FOR PEACE (SWAP)

A source reported on May 17, 1952, a meeting of the

Ballara-Greenwood CP Cluo was

held in seattle, April 25, 1902,

at which TAIMI HALONEN was nominated to be the new Chairman of

this Club.

Along with other business of the evening, HALONEN

said she expected to devote a good portion of her time to sWaP,

an organization of peace forces that met recently with seven

members.

She said four of the seven were from the "left" but

dia not go into detail. She said the group had problems of an

organizational nature because it was new, and she thought she

coula neip.

On April 5, 1963, a second source stated a meeting of

the University CP Club was

nela at seattle on April 2, 1963.

KEN ROSE, a member of the Club, reported the most influential

peace organization in Seattle

was SwAP.

On July 31, 1964, a meeting of the North Central CP

Section Committee was heid

at Seattle. WILL PARRY, Section

Chairman, said attention shoula be placed on three political

questions - peace, civil rights, and labor. Under peace, he

said CP clubs should inject the Women Act for Peace campaign

into the election campaign. At another Section meeting,

February 5, 1966, TAIMI HALONEN was praised for effective

peace work and for her help in developing unity among the peace

forces.

Section-wide concentration was urged in assisting

SWAP to visit 1,000 workers on the Vietnam issue.

A third source advised on February 24, 1966, a

Northwest District CP Committee meeting was held at Seattle

February 12, 1966.

After lunch, the entire

group participated

in passing out leaïlets pertaining to cacial matters and the

been

used consistently by SWAP and is that of ANCI kOppEl, also known

as MrS. CHARLES KOPPEL.

INFORMATION CONCERNING

(INTERNAL SECURITY)

The San Francisco Office has reported that an

organization known as the Jeannette Rankin Brigade has sent

out a call for women from throughout the Nation to demonstrate

at the White House on 1/8/68.

This call also urges partici-

pants to "enter the U.S. Congress" to present demands for an

end to the war.

Jeannette Rankin, who is the Chairman of the

Brigade, is an 86-year-old

resident of Watkinsville, Georgia.

She was a Congresswoman from Montana from 1917 to 1919 and

served one term in 1940. She voted against U.S. involvement

in World Wars I and II.

Rankin has publicly protested the

war in Vietnam and has asserted her willingness to go to

jail in protest of the bombing.

The Secretary of the Brigade has been identified

as Vivian Hallinan, the wife of Vincent Hallinan who was

identified in 1966

as the Treasurer for the American Institute

of Marxist Studies, a communist front organization.

The above information has been furnished to the

White House, the Department of State, the Attorney General

and military intelligence.

In view of the Bureau's responsibility to identify

subversive elements which may participate in the demonstration

sponsored by this group and to keep the White House and other

agencies advised of developments, it is felt that the field

should be notified of the proposed demonstration and furnished

with instructions for handling information concerning it,

including the need for informant coverage of participating

groups.

BRIGADE FORMED TO CONFRONT CONGRESS

Helena, Montana

November 27, 1967

To all American Women:

I an proud of the fact that my first

vote cast in Congress was a vote

against war. It was the first oppor-

unity for a woman to vote, because I

was the first woman to be

elected to

Congress.

I believed then, as I do today,

that women are the ones that must be

concerned with the needs and develop-

ment of the human race.

I have always

fought for the dignity of all human

beings - for those of the present

as

well

as those of future generations.

I will continue to struggle as long

as I live. I hope all women will res-

pond to

the following call and join me

in Washington on January 8, 1968, the

opening day of Congress.

Jeannette Rankin

A CALL TO ALL AMERICAN WOMEN whO

are outraged by the ruthless slaughter

in Vietnam and the persistent neglect

of human needs at home TO COME TO

WASHINGTON ON JANUARY 8

AMERICAN WOMEN represent 51% of the

voting population of out country.

AMERICAN WOMEN have the power to a-

chieve peace and a decent life for

every Amarican.

This is woman power!

Demonstrate it to the Congress of the

United States! Come to Washington on

January 8 as Congress opens in joint

session.

Support Jeanette Rankin as

she leads a representative delegation

of American women to the Capitol to

demand that:

*Congress, as its first order

of business, resolve to end

the war in Vietnam and imnedi-

ately arrange for the with-

drawal of all American troops.

*Congress use its power to make

reparations for the ravaged land

we leave behind in Vietnam.

*Congress listen to what the

American people are saying and

refuse the insatiable demands of

the military-industrial complex.

WOMEN OF AMERICA, our power is un-

limited. On January 8, American women

will:

*PETITION the United States Con-

gress

• *CONVENE a Congress of American

Women that afternoon to develop

programs to meet the crisis in

America - programs which will

express our political power,

reason and conscience.

According to source Cne, the southern California

council of sP is presently coordinating local activity to

form a contingent of the JRB from Southern California. They

are making office space and telephones in their Los Angeles

headquarters, 5899 West Piço Boulevard, Los Angeles available

for this purpose.

Spearheading the local committee are

Mary Clarke and Eva Korn, both of whom are active in WSP.

Mary Clarke is currently a member of the JPE's National

Source Three reported during November 1947, that

Eva Korn was a member of the Los Angeles County

Communist Party (ASCCP.) during the years 1946

To give publicity to the proposed activity of the

JRB, the local WSP office is circulating a reprint from the

"San Francisco Chronicle"

', Issue of Saturday, May 20, 1967,

page nine, which contained a feature article regarding the

opposition

to wars by former Congresswoman Jeannette Rankin,

for whom the JRB has been named.

Rankin Brigade should be made up of only those women who

volunteer to participate with the prior understanding that

they should be ready to spend at least two months

in jail

for the commission of civil disobedience while in Washington,

D. C.

Sunderland also suggested that a good way to recruit

women to join the brigade would bento make a pitch for

recruits when Mary Clarke, Dagmar

are making their respective speaking engagements across the

United States since their return from a trip to Nosth Vietnam,

which they visited as representatives of WSP during the

fall of 1967.

Source Four advised during the summer of 1965

that June Sunderland, 3730 Hollister Avenue,

Santa Barbara, California, had attended a 1967

"peace conference" in Helsinki, Finland, at the

invitation of the Communist Party (CP),

and that

funds to cover her expenses were raised in pari

by the CP; and that following her attendance at

the Helsinki affair she went on to Russia for ten

days at the invitation and expense of the Soviet

Government.

Source One learned that a communication was re-

ceived from eastern sponsors of the JRB on December 7, 1967,

indicating that the JRB march on Washington might not

held on January 8, 1968, but possibly would be set back until

either the 15th or 22nd of January 1958, depending upon

the date that the United States Congress would reconvene.

The communication indicated that since the entire purpose

of the Brigade would be to coniront the opening joint session

of Congress that it would be futile to schedule the march

prior to the date Congress would reconvene, The suggestion

was made that recruitment of local omen to participate in

the ERB be held in abeyance until a confirmation had been

obtained indicating the date on which Congress would reconvene.

Source One, had indicated that although the "Call"

as reproduced in "La Wiso"

, states,

"There will be local

actions across the country at the same time as the action

the Communist Party, USA.

The second source added on May 15, 1967 that the PSSEC continued to

meet during 1962 through 1967 and that it remains under the control of the CEPD,

while WILLIAMS was in California regarding the court martial

of her son, RONALD LOCKMAN. . .

HALLINAN originally had wanted WILLIAMS to be at

the launching of the Brigade at a press conference to be held.

in Washington, Do Co, on Veterans Day, 11/11/67, along with

mothers, sisters,

and widows of men killed in Vietnam.

HALLINAN desired

WILLIAMS to furnish her with the names of

mothers and wives of men killed in Vietnam who felt their

loved ones should not have been there at. all.

Since Mrs. WILLIAMS did not return until after

11/11/57, she did not know of the event, and therefore, did

not participate.

Additionally, she did not get around

to

reading all her

mail until much

after she returned to

Philadelphia.

This was the reason the source did not learn of this

Brigade until December.

Jeannette Rankin made the above statement in

Way of this year.

Fifty years ago, as the first

woman elected to Congress, she voted against Torld

War I. She has consistently maintained her strug-

gle for peace, and at 8e she is as courageous and

vigorous as ever - an inspiration to all women.

The presence of the United States forces in

the internal struggle of Vietnam is immoral and

111egal.

There can be no possible justification

for our interference in the domestic affairs of

this tiny distant land.

This 86-year-old woman has stated that she.

is willing to stay in jail until the bombing is

stopped.

Not all women are

we can assure her that thousanas of women Till

march peacefully beside her.

Some will picket,

others

will go to jail until bail is arranged,

and others will stay in jail with Hiss Rankin.

Every woman'e participation is eoually valuable.

Te are confident each one will do the maximum of

which she is capable.

On january 8th, women from all over the land

will converge on Washington to demand the end of

• this dishonorable war.

December 18, 1967

Dear Friend:

We are sending this letter to you and others from whom we have not heard much

recently, in the hope of re-enlisting your efforls in the Women for Peace

movement.

It has been too long since we last heard directly from many of you,

and our meetings with those of you whom we have seen recently have been brief.

Of course, we know the paralyzing sense of frustration we all feel occasionally,

as we learn of the mounting horrors in Vietnam.

But this feeling is only

temporary, and quickly gives way to activity.

As women, we bear the major

responsibility for the preservation of life, and thus a major responsibility

in the peace movement.

Inclosed you will find an announcement of the latest national women's effort

for peace. Several peace groups in Portland are cooperating in raising funds

to send representatives to hashington. We hope that you will also support this

effort, to insure representation from Portland Women for Peace. The coupon

on the enclosed notice is for your use in this effort.

In addition, we will have a supportive peaceful demonstration

in Portland at

NOON, Monday, JANUARY 15th

Pioneer Post Office

5th and Morrison

We are asking participants to wear black, and to bring a black

(or dark colored) umbrella.

We shall carry the umbrellas opened,

min or shine. Placards (to wear) and leaflets (to distribute),

expressing suppet to the deannette Rankin Brigade,. will be

available.

We shall march around the Post Office block for one hour

from noon to 1 p.M., leafleting as we walk.

He hope, It you cannot go to lashington, yoursell, that you will contribute to

neup someone else to go, and that you will also join with us at the Pioneer

fost Office at noon Monday, January 15th.

In addition, please let us hear from you on your ideas of what more we might

do locally.

We have some ideas too, which we hope to share with you, and on

winich we shall need much help.

Please get in touch with one of us soon. Your help, ideas, and efforts are

urgently needed.

Yours for Peace,

I am proud of the fact that my first vote cast in Congress was a vote against war.

It was the first opportunity for a woman to vote, because I was the first woman

to be elected to Congress.

I balieved then, as I do today, that women neu the ones that must be concerned

with the needs, and development of the human race. I have always fought.

for the

dignity of all human beings - for those of the prosent as well as those óf future

generations. :::

I will continue to struggle as long as I live.

I hope all women will respond to

Washington, D..C. area. Source one advised that it is

contemplated all the women will stay in Washington, D.C. until

Tuesday, January 16, 1967.

source one advised it was reported the women from

across the nation would gather at the Union Depot, Washington, D.C.

it is hoped ten thousand women will participate in the

demonstration. After the gathering at Union Depot, the women

will march in

solemn procession, all wearing black, to the

steps of the capitol building where the petition containing

the redress of grievances will be presented to the Congress.

Source one further advised it had been reported that Representative

Mc Cormick and Senator Mansfield had agreed to receive the

petition.

• Representative Mc Cormick, according to source one,

had agreed to accept fifteen women in his office at which time

he would receive the petition, but source one advised the

JRB now wants Representative Mc Cormick and Senator Mansfield

to accept the petition on the steps of the capitol building

in order that they might get news coverage. After the petition

has been presented, the JRB wants the redress of grievances

read into the Congressional Record.

Further activities of the JRB while

are to includé a three hour

"Women's Congress, In Washington, D.C.

• possibly on

grounds of Georgetown University.

Mary Clarke pointed out that although the original

intention had been to have only those women participate

in the JRB who were willing to risk arrest for civil disobedience,

she stated at the above meeting that no civil disobedience is

anticipated in view of the large number of organizations

participating who are opposed to such civil disobedience.

However, she further stated that individuals are not going to

be discouraged who might elect

to create civil disobedience.

COMMUNIST INFILTRATION OF THE

FIRST UNITARIAN CHURCH OF LOS ANGELES

A source advised on May 22, 1967, that the

premises of the First Unitarian Church of Los Angeles, 2936

West 8th Street, Los Angeles, California, have been utilized

for meetings by Communist Party members and sympathizers over

a period of years.

Speakers and lecturers at the church

frequently espouse Communist causes or follow the Communist

Party line.

Communist front group literature is distributed

at the church. The church is used by some Communist Party

members for

"mass concentration" work.

This same infiltration extends to adjuncts of

the church such as the Unitarian Public Forum and the Fellow-

ship for social Justice, formerly known as the Unitarian-

Universalist Fellowship

for Social Justice.

STEPHEN H. FRITCHMAN has been minister of the

church since 1948.

Reverend STEPHEN H. FRITCHMAN is described in

California, 1940, page 115, as a very

and connected with numerous

zations and activities."

Membership in the First Unitarian Church does not,

of itself, connote membership in or sympathy with the Communist

Party.

in the upcoming 1966 Congressional

elections.

The same source stated that WSP 1s a non-membership

W. E. B. DU BOIS CLUBS OF AMERICA (DCA)

A source advised that on October 26-27, 1963, a con-

ference of members of the Communist Party, USA (CPUSA), including

of the donat

national functionaries, met in Chicago, Illinois, for the purpose

ci setting in motion forces for the establishment of a new national

Marxist-oriented youth organization which would hunt for the most

peaceful transition to socialism.

The delegates were told that it

would be reasonable to assume that the young socialists attracted

into this new organization would eventually pass into the CP

itseif.

A second source has advised that the founding con-

vention for the new youth organization was held from June 19-21,

1964, at 150 Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco, California, at

which time the name W.E.B. Du Bois Clubs of America (DCA) was

adopted.

Approximately 500 delegates from throughout the United

States

attended this convention.

The second source advised in September, 1966, that

Mike Zagarell, CPUSA Youth Director, stated that

in Negro

communities the Party still supported the plan to build "left"

socialist centers and to solidify the Party base

through the

DOA.

This since also advised in September, 1966, that Daniel

Rubin, CPUSA National Organizational Secretary, stated the Party•

believes the DCA should have a working-class outlook and be a mass

organization favorable to socialism, socialist countires and

Marxism, and ir April, 1907, advised that Gus Hall, CPUSA General

Secretary, indicated the DCA primary emphasis should be on

Women For Peace groups in the San Francisco Bay area.

These groups support programs to achieve goals such as:

(1) Continued disarmament negotiations.

(2) A strong and flexible United Nations.

(3)

Planning now at state and national levels for

conversion to peace-time economy and positive

efforts to ease world tensions.

Ihe women act as

individuals and as a group, with specific

actions suggested by individuals and groups from all over

the world.

Decision to participate jointly on any given

suggestion is democratly arrived at by members of the Co-.

ordinating Committee. Effective cooperation with other

peace groups is encouraged. Monthly Coordinating Committee

meetings and general meetings, as warranted, are open to

all and announced in mailings to members.

There are no

dues or membership forms nor conditions for membership.

To stir an awareness of the need for peace, Homen for

Peace encourage public education in peace objectives at

local schools and sponsor peace-oriented demonstrations

the group attempts to influence government officials

by letters and conferences.

CHICAGO COUNCIL OF AMERICAN-SOVIET

ROLATIONS, Formerly known as chicago

Concid of American-soviet friendssip

EDWIN GORDON FOX, 7147 Jeffrey Avenue, Chicago,

Illinois, (now deceased) made available in January, 1954,

the

"First Annual Report CCASF," an undated publication which

stated that the Chicago Council of American-Soviet Friendship

(CCASF) was incorporated in July, 1943. This document stated,

"The Council's affiliation with the National Council of

American-Soviet Friendship (NCASF) was validated August 11,

(1943). The present name was adopted to conform to standard

national practice.

It should be noted, however, that the

Chicago Council is entirely autonomous; the government of its

affairs rests exclusively in the hands of its Chicago Executive

Board,"

On April 8, 1965, a source furnished information to

the effect that as of March 11, 1965, this organization would

be known as the Chicago Council of American-Soviet Relations

(CCASR). MANDEL TERMAN continued to be listed as Chairman of

organization.

During April, 1965, a second source advised that

MANDEL TERMAN had arbitrarily dissolved the Board of Directors,

assumed all financial and other functions of the organization,

and was maintaining existing records of the organization at

his residence, 660 West Irving Park Road, Chicago, Illinois.

The aims and purposes of this organization continued to be

to work for peaceful coexistence and friendship with the UssR.

While it claimed to be an autonomous organization, its program

followed the NCASF and it was in frequent contact with the

NCASF.

On November 5, 1958, a third source advised that in

the early 1940s, MANDEL TERMAN was a member-at-large of the

Communist Party (CP) of Illinois.

November, 1958, where he had gone to discuss the treatment of

Jews and

to discuss Jewish culture in the USSR with the

leadership of the Soviet Union.

CHICAGO COUNCIL OF AMERICAN

SOVIET RELATIONS

January, 1960, a fourth source advised that the

CCASR went out of existence in the

spring of 1965 due to

health condition of MANDEL A, 'PLIN.

The offices oi the

CCASR, formerly located at 32 West

Rancolph Street, Chicago,

were for a short time carried at HANDEL TERMAN's home

resi-

dence,

660 West Irving Park Road,

Chicago.

During the Fall

of 1965 due to the defunctness of the cCash, the CP of Illinois

found it necessary to sponsor a rally honoring the 48th

anniversary of the Russian Revolution under a temporary

committee called

• "The Chicago Conmittee for American-Soviet

Friendship Rally." This rally was held on November 7, 1965,

and once the rally was held this temporary committee went

out of existence.

The fourth source advised that as of the present

time the CCASR is defunet in the chicago area and any future

rally to be held on the

American-Soviet friendship theme will

have to be organized by the CP of Illinois on a temporary

basis.

The NCASE has been desigratso pursuant to brecutive

Order 10450.

NATIONAL LAWYERS GUILD

CHICAGO CHAPTER

A source advised on May 9, 1967, that it was

his

understanding that the National Lawyers Guild (NLG) was

formed around 1936 in New York City, and that the Chicägo

Chapter of the NG (CCNLG), which is affiliated with the

national

group in New York, was formed shortly theresiter:

possibly in 1937 by a group of liberal progressive lawyers

in protest against activities of the American Bar AssoCa&ülOn

which they claimed was a non-liberal,

non-progressive

organization. The CCNLG has no established headquarters bat

occasionally

uses the return address of its officials in

TO ALL AMERICAN WOMEN,

I am proud of the fact that my first vote cast in Congress

was a vote against war. It was the first opportunity for a

woman to vote because I was the first woman to be elected

to Congress.

I believed then as I do today that women are the ones who

must be concerned with the needs and development of the

human race. I have always fought for the dignity of all

human beings -- for those of the present as well as those

of future generations.

I will continue to struggle as long as I live.

I hope all women will respond to the following CALL, and

join me in Washington on January 8, 1968, the opening

day of Congress.

With highest hopes,

A CALL

AMERICAN

WOMEN

who are outraged by the ruthless slaughter in Vietnam

and the persistent neglect of human needs at home

TO COME TO WASHINGTON JANUARY 15. & 16 ..

AMERICAN WOMEN constitute 51% of the voting population, yet a high percentage of us don't vote. .

It is time for women to break out of their societal molds and take their place as effective, vocal citi-

zens. WOMEN CAN ELECT the President they want; Women can determine the political, social and

economic direction of the nation. WE HAVE WOMEN POWER. Let's use it to demonstrate our

opposition to this war to the Congress of the United States.

We are a broad coalition of women from many areas of American life. We shall meet in Washington

on January 15 for the opening of Congress to demand the following:

1. CONGRESS, AS ITS FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS, RESOLVE TO END THE

WAR IN VIETNAM AND IMMEDIATELY ARRANGE FOR THE WITHDRAWAL

OF ALL AMERICAN TROOPS.

2. CONGRESS USE ITS POWER TO HEAL A SICK SOCIETY AT HOME.

3. CONGRESS USE ITS POWER TO MAKE REPARATION FOR THE RAVAGED

LAND WE LEAVE BEHIND IN VIETNAM.

4. CONGRESS LISTEN TO WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE SAYING AND

REFUSE THE INSATIABLE DEMANDS OF THE MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL

COMPLEX.

After we petition the United States Congress, we will hold our own congress to articulate our position

on the basic problem of achieving peace. We declare our intention to return to our communities and

mobilize women to dedicate ourselves to reshaping American society, and restoring our country to a

position of honor in the community of nations.

On January 15, we will meet at the Union Depot in Washington, D.C., at 11:30 A.M., and walk behind

our delegation which will present our petition to the U.S. Congress.

On January 16, many of us will stay in Washington to begin implementation of these demands by

presenting them to our Congressmen and Senators. We hope you can stay.

COMMUNIST INFILTRATION OF THE

WOMEN STRIKE FOR PEACE,

Also Known As

Women's International Strike for Peace

A source advised on May I4, 1967, that the Women

Southern California area began

1tg operations in the late fall of 1961, as an affiliate

of the national organization formed in Washington, D.C.

It

1s a peace oriented women's organization which is opposed

to the present American foreign policy in Vietnam.

It has

also sought legislation which ould bring about the abolition

_...of the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUA). In

recent months the organization has sponsored demonstrations

protesting

the United States Involvement in Vietnam and

calling for the complete withdrawal of all United States

from Vietnam.

In the spring of 1966, 1t was instrumental

In originating and

putting into effect

support for "

peace candidates"

elections.

The same source stated that WSP. is a non-membership

organization and has no officers.

The organization is open

to women of all political opinions who are interested in world

peace.

It makes no effort to exclude from its activities

members of, or persons sympathetic to, the Communist Party.

and related groups.

The gulding force behind the Southern California

WSP groups is MARY CLARKE.

A second source advised in July,

that CLARKE was dropped from the Western Division, Los

ARgies Courty Communist Party (LACCP) In the Spring of 1955,

WOMEN FOR LEGISEATIVE ACTION

A source advised on May I, 1963, that the Women

for Legislative Action was cormed in 1952, claiming to be

an independent organization dedicated to non-partisan parti-

cipation in legislative and civic activities. Its position

in favoring or opposing legislation. usually parallels the

position of the Comrunist Farty and related groups. It also

supports legislation to abolish the House Committee on Un-

American Activities. Membership in the Homen for Legislative

AcElon does not, of itself, connote membership in or sympany

witr the Communist Party.

JEANNETTE RANKIN

HELENA, MONTANA

November 27, 1967

TO ALL AMERICAN WOMEN,

I am proud of the fact that my first vote cast in Congress

was a vote against war. It was the first opportunity for a

woman to vote because I was the first woman to be elected

to Congress.

I believed then as I do today that women are the ones who

must be concerned with the needs and development of the

human race. I have always fought for the dignity of all

human beings - for those of the present as well as those

of future generations.

I will continue to struggle as long as I live.

I hope all women will respond to the following CALL,, and

join me in Washington on January 8, 1968, the opening

day of Congress.

With highest hopes,

Dear WSPER:

Women Strike for Peace nationally is supporting the Jeannette Rankin Brigade.

Planeloads, trainloads and carloads of women will be coming into Washington on Mon-

day, January 15th, from all over the country.

He are particularly pleased with this action because it represents for the first

time a real coalition of women's peace groups, church groups, theatre personalities, .

and community leaders.

The Day is envisioned as a solemn, dignified confrontation of those who should be

representing the ever growing opposition to the war.

We ask that you write your Con-

gressmen urging that they support the four points listed in the enclosed Call as Con-

gress reconvenes.

Later in the afternoon at our Women's Congress we want to be able to

report on Congressional responses.

We will all meet at Union Station in Washington at 11:30 All and slowly walk to the

Capitol. We ask the women to wear black.

We will be led by Jeannette Rankin who will

proceed to the top of the Capitol steps with a representative delegation of 50 women to

resent our petition to the two men who represent the whole of Congress, Senator Mike

ansfield and Speaker of the House McCormack. The delegation will read the demands be

ore the assembled women and the two Congressmen.

Leaving the Hill, the women will enter

juses for a motorcade to a Congress of American Women (place to be

announced).. Women

rill present an analysis of the current crisis on the war front and the domestic front,

Leading to suggestions for program and actions to be taken back to our comnunities for

,lementation.

Women may choose to remain in lashington the next day to meet with their Congressmen.

I you wish to stay and wish help in securing accommodations, contact the Hospitality Com

ittee, 2140 P. St. N.W. Washington, DC (293-2020). We regret that in order to get the

owest

train fare we had to guarantee return the same day; therefore you would have to

inance your own trip back on the loth. .

Our hope is that 10,000 women will converge upon Washington. We urge you to parti

ipate.

Yours for Peace,

Ethel Taylor

TO ALL AMERICAN WOMEN:

I am proud of the lack that my first vote cast in Congress

It was the first opportunity

fox a woman to vote, because I was the first woman

to be

I believed then, as I do today, that women are the ones that

must be concerned mith the needs and development of the

hunan race. I have always toughi for the dignity. of all

human beings - foi those of the present as well as those.

I will continue to struggle as long as I live. I hope all

* Today, January 15,

Ungress

reconvenes in Washington.

Women from all over the United

States have gathered there to

petition the Congress in the

name of the Jeanette Rankin

Brigade.

Jeannette Rankin,

the first woman to serve in

Congress and the only person

to vote against U.S. entry

into both World Wars, leads

the women there, along with

such other sponsors as Mrs.

M.L.King, Mrs. Harry Belafonte,

Mr's. John C. Bennett, Mrs.

Benjamin Spock,

Mrs Judith

Morse Eaton, The Brigade is a

national coaliti

of women.

antiwar groups mobilized

against the war in Veitnam.

As the cost of the war in lives

and money mounts daily, the

women of this country call upon

congress to take action against

it.

To support the senators and

Congressmen who oppose the war,

to encourage those who are troubled

but silent, to speak out, and to

make our position known

to those

who still support this immoral

war, we, as women of Hawaii, are

gathered here.

Our messagè to

Reps. Mink and, Matsunaga, to

Sens. Fong and Inouye, is that

women will no longer give their sons and loved ones to a government

waging a genocidal war...

women will no longer accept a government which represents a military

and industrial

machine rather than its people...

women will no longer consent to raise their children in the blight

and neglect of a society geared to profit and war...

women grieve for suffering people all over the world and will no longer

remain silent while the gap widens between the rich and the poor...

We ask our government to design and carry out a domestic program

commensurate with the needs of the American people; to foldow a

policy of non-intervention in the affairs of other countries; to

pursue our official committment to disarmament, and to respect

international law.

American women who, as women everywhere, are the bearers and conservers

of life, will not stand idly by as life is destroyed. in our name.

About two hundred Oahu women have signed the following petition to

Congress:

As Congress reconvenes, we urge that its first order of business

be to put an end to the war in Vietnam and arrange for the withdrawal

of. American troops; and that the Congress turn its attention to

ameliorating the crisis in America.

We urge the Congress to heal a sick society at home, to make reparations

for the ravaged land we leave behind in Vietnam and to refuse to

listen to the insatiable demands of the military-industrial complex.

SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA

JANUARY 15, 1968

Chairman of the Brigade, announced to the demonstrators that this

local demonstration was principally gathered to support women

from around the. United States who were gathered in Washington,

D.C. today,

as part of a nation-wide demonstration sponsored by

to petition Congress to resolve

the conflict in Vietnam.

the Jeannette Rankin Brig Bridges stated that inasmuch as it

was not possible for the demonstrators to personally contact

their congressmen,

most of whom were out of town; that following

the presentation of a petition to Mayor Joseph Alioto, the

demonstrators would then proceed to the Western Union Office on

10th and Market Streets in San Francisco, so that the women

protestors could send wires to their congressmen, protesting

United States policies in Vietnam.

Bridges indicated that the

petitioners

would request Mayor Alioto to convey to Congress

their petition, which among other things urged Congress, as its

Ilnst order of business, to resolve to end the War in Vietnam and

immediately arrange for

withdrawal of all American troops from

Vietnam; for Congress to use its power to heal the sick society

at home and to make reparations for the ravaged lands left

behind in Vietnam.

source advised March 2, 1967, that Mrs. H.

Bridges, also known as

Nikki Bridges, 35

San Francisco, California, was

listed as a recipient of a new yearly subscription

to the "People's World" (PW), expiration date.

March 4, 1968.

The PW is a west coast communist newspaper, •

published weekly in San Francisco.

The next speaker was identified as Aileen Hernandez.

She spoke

for approximately five minutes and briefly explained

to the demonstrators who Jeannette Rankin is and what the purposes

of the Jeannette Rankin Brigade

are. She stated that the group

has no principal spokesman and it is principally a group of

women who are involved and committed in a fight for peace.

Several of the demonstrators, led by Nikki Bridges,

then proceeded to the Office of Mayor Joseph Alioto to present

SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA

JANUARY 15, 1968

Approximately ten minutes later the Mayor of

San Erancisco appeared on the steps of the City Hall and announced

to the demonstrators that he would gladly transmit their

petition to Congress.

Mayor Alioto stated that he fully

believed in the constitutional right of peaceful assembly.

He indicated, however, that because he had consented to

transmit the demonstrators' petition to Washington, he did not

necessarily agree with it.

The Mayor then stated that it

was his personal opinion that the United States Government and

the Johnson Administration had done all in its power to attempt

to come to a peaceful and honorable

solution in the Vietnamese

War.

He related that he felt that it was now up to the other

side to make the same attempts to arrive at a

peaceful solution

in the Vietnamese conflict.

At approximately 12:45 p.m., the demonstrators proceeded

to the Western Union Office located at l0th and Market Streets

in San Francisco, so that wires could be sent to their congressmen

in Washington.

A Special Agent of the fBI observed one plaine

Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco.

A second source advised on December 4, 1967, that

Elaine Yoneda is a current and active member of the Communist

Party, (CP) . .

On January 15, 1968, a Special Agent of the FBI

observed a silent protest by a

group of women on the lawn

of Colton Hall, Monterey, California, between 3:00 and 5:00 p.m.

These women

were ostensibly gathered to support the demonstration

being held in Washington, D.C., sponsored by the Jeannette Rankin

Brigade.

There were no speeches given; the demonstrators merely

conducted a silent vigil.

A one page leaflet captioned "Women To Take First

Step to End The War" printed by the Jeannette Rankin Brigade,

at 150 Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco, California, was handed

out at the above demonstration.

A Xeroxed duplication of this

leaflet is appended to this memorandum.

INFORMATION CONCERNING

Reference is made to a memorandum,

captioned as

above, dated December 28,

1967, at Miami, Florida. The memorandum

concerned a call issued by the Jeannette

Rankin Brigade for American Women to travel

to Washington, D. C. on January 15, 1968,

to petition the United States Congress to

end the war in Viet Nam.

A sourse, on January 15, 1968, advised that the Miami

Chapter of the Women's International League for Peace and

Freedom (WILPF) had scheäuled a demonstration to take place

January 15, 1968, at Miami, Florida.

The demonstration

would be a support activity for the Jeannette Rankin Brigade

that would be in Washington, D. C. on that date to petition

Congress to end the war in Viet Nam.

The January 16, 1968, issue of

the "Miami Herald,"

a local Miami, Florida

newspaper, contained an article entitled

"FIve Thousand Women Join Viet Wir Frotest."

The article, identified Jeanette. Rankin w

as an 87 year old woman pacifist and

former member of Congress who voted in

Congress against the American entry into

both world wars.

A Special Agent of the Federal Bureau of Investi

gation (FBI) on January 15, 1968, observed an anti-war

demonstration take place in Miami, Florida. Approximately

70 participants, mostly elderly women, assembled at the

Torch of Friendship, Bayfront Park, downtown Miami, at

2:00 p.m. They stood in silent vigil, some wearing black

Three women representing the black community wors

to fly to Washington from the, southern

California JRB Committee.. They were Bobbie, Hodges, Althea

and Glory Roberts. Two women affiliated

thex peace-oriented Pasadena Chapter of the Women's International

League for Peace and Freedom; Cathy. Hofer, and Marian Beardsley,

were also to join the above women for the flignt to Washington,

according to Source One.

On January 15, 1968, Special Agents of the Los Angeles

Office of the Federal Bureau of

Investigation observed a

group of women assemble in front of the Old State Building, 217

West First Street (First and Broadway, in the downtown Civic

Center), Los Angeles, Califomia, at approximately 9:30 AM.

The women were carrying placards indicating they were the

local representation of the JRB.

They also had two leaflets

for distribution (Xerox copies of which are appended to this

memoranäum) which called for women to participate and which

indicated that a voting block of American women had the power

to put an end to the war in Vietnam. These leaflets bore the

address of the JRB as 5899 West Pico Boulevard, Los Angeles,

California (90019), which is the address of the headquarters of

the WSP in Southern California.

Starting shortly after 10:00 AM, the women proceeded

to hold a rally on the south steps of the Old State Building,

with the speakers utilizing an electronic amplification system,

which was' held by actress Leslie Parrish.

Source One indicated that Parrish had originally been

scheduled to fly to Washington, D. C., to participate in the

JRB action at the Capitol, but

changed her plans at the last

minute in order to remain in

Los Angeles.

The rally was headed by Tina. Iomash, who acted as

the local JRB organizer and answered some of

the questions

regarding the JRB from members of the news media on the scene.

Veronica Sissons acted as mistress of ceremonies.

Speakers

Included Mary Henry. Negro civil rights and poverty worker;

Margaret fright who has been identified by Sources One and

Two as a militant black nationalist, who has been extremely

active in recent months in disturbances at Manual Arts High

School, Los Angeles, which resulted in a court injunction to

prohibit her entering those school grounds); and television

actress Ellen McRae.

The speakers all called for a coalition

of women to form a

strong voting block which could produce

legislation to end the war in Vietnam, end poverty and "legislated

injustice"

A count made as the demonstrators marched between the

Old State Building and the City Hall revealed that 250

black), and eight non-Caucasian adults were involved, plus

some youngsters

and infants.

The mother of one of the children

had a cardboard sign, depicting a bomb and the caption, "I'm

Glad I'm Not Vietnamese"

strapped to the back of her son who

appeared to be less than four years of age.

With Veronica, Sissons again acting as mistress of / y

ceremonies; the rälly uas addressed by Chacoite shermen,

Margaret Wright, Tima Tomash, and Jily Schary.

The latteri

was introduced as a radio commentator employed by Los Angeles

Radio Station KLAC.

She

joined the others in calling for a

coalition of

to influence legislation and bring an end to

war in Vietnam. She also called for support of other "liberal

radio broadcasters on our side"

", one of whom she named as

William Winter.

, west coast

communist newspaper, in its edition of June 11, 1946, described

William Winter as chairman of a local citizens' committee to

safeguard the Joint Anti-Fascist Refuge Committee, which

organization has been cited pursuant to Executive Order 10450) •

Charlotte Sherman was introduced as the wife of

ii.:

"Laurence Shernan, it being pointed out that he was an "

unsuccessful

candidate for public office, on a peace slate,

during 1907; but that both he and his wife were continuing

the

fight for an end to the war in Vietnan.

She said,

"It is time

for us to re-examine our role. as women.

Homen are a vehicle

Thoreau, indicating they were as timely today, as when he wrote

them.

Margaret Wright stated that werees the majority of

women in the demonstration were wearing black to denote mourning,

that she and her non-Caucasian associates who feel, "Black is

beautiful" were dressed in white to indicate their attitude of

mourning.

She called for the elimination of ROIC (Reserve

Officers Training Corps) from local high schools and junior

colleges, adding,

"They have got to get

live bullets out of the

schools,

and get

some live teachers in."

She repeated these

same statements during the arternoon when the JRB moved to

the Los Angeles City Board of Education.

As the rally was breaking up, Wright grabbed the

public address system and said that it had been learned that

the City Council was in session inside the City Hall Building.

She urged the women not to. disperse, but to join her and....

others in invading

• the City Council

Chambers with a demand

that the JRB be allowed to speak to the Council even though

they had not made previous arrangements for a place on the

agenda that day.

Some of the women were already out of range

of the public address system and did not hear this announcement

by Wright, having already been dismissed by. Sissons and told to

reconvene at the Board of Education following luncheon.

Approximately 200 of the demonstrators did enter

the Council Chambers.

They got word to the councilmen; through.

one of the staff members, that they wished to be heard.

A motion to allow a JRB representative to address them was

put before the Council, and defeated by a vote of six to five.

Immediately following this vote, there was a unanimous vote

that the Council adjourn. As the councilmen filed out of the

room, Tima Tomash rushed

to the front shouting demands that

retur, while other of the women hissed and booed the

city legislators.

During the noon hour some of the women distributed

leaflets in the City Hall and on the surrounding streets in

the downtown Civic Center.

At 1:00 PM, the women, whose numbers had by that

time been reduced to 125, massed in the patio of the Los

Angeles City Board of Education, 450 North Grand Avenue,

Los Angeles. Sissons, Wright and Tomash addressed-the ...

assembled demonstrators, pointing out that money spent in

Vietnam could be better

spent in education.

Wright claimed

that many of the so-called student "drop-outs" are in reality

, claining that she herself was one of the latter.

We know this is a racist

we blacks are not going to fight a racist war"

i :She.:

indicated that rather than fight overseas, the black people

would remain at home and fight the racists. She also said,

"Just because I'm pro-black doesn't necessarily mean I'm anti-.

white."

Wright said,

"I'm not political, but I am honest. I

can't honestly get up and say the pleage of allegiance to the

American flag, because I really don't have liberty and justice;

so I just get up and stand and won't repeat the pledge.

Later, when she observed a photograph of President Johnson

hanging from a wall in the Administration Building at the

Los Angeles City Board of Education, she told the JRB women

with her,"

"We shouldn't have to look at such pornographic

pictures.

Wright said that her arrest at the hands of Los

Angeles City School Security Oilicers, during the recent

Manual Arts High School disturbance, had at least one bright

result. She said that at the time

of her arrest it had been

necessary for the arresting officers to drag her down the

hall as she was too heavy for them to carry.

Then she added

that the next time she is arrested the officers will not have

that excuse as she has lost thirty pounds in the meantime.

I'he speeches in the patio ended at 1:30 PM and many

of the women left immediately. Seventy-eight women remained

and attempted to enter a special committee meeting being attended

by some of the School Board members.

They were inforned by a

member of the administrative staff that the public meeting of the

School Board would not be held until 4:00 PM, the regularly

scheduled meeting time.. The women milled around in the hallway

outside the meeting room, until finally a staff memoer came out

and told them that two members of the School Board, Reverend

James E. Jones and DI. Julian. Nava, had agreed to grant them an

audience. The women were then ushered into the public board

room of the School Board where they waited until 2:00 PM at

which time the above-named Board members granted the demonstrators

a short audience and answered some questions put to them by the

One question, as to how much longer the members of the

School Board were going to permit recruiters from the armed

forces to interview students at local high schools and junior.

colleges remained unanswered, but Dr. Nava pointed out to the

women that he had seen nothing wrong in entering the armed

forces to fight for this country himself when he was 17 years

of age; and he could see nothing wrong in other young men who

wanted to do the same today. The demonstration was cancluded

by 3:00 PM. There were no incidents and no arrests. '

Placards carried during this demonstration in Los

Angeles bore the following captions:

"Eat Texas Beef, Not L.B.J. Baloney"

"Woman Power is Vote Power is Peace Power"

"Draft Beer Not Students"

"Where Have All the Men Gone-To Graveyards"

"Jeannette Rankin Brigade-Women's Votes Count, End

SOUTHERN CONFERENCE EDUCATIONAL FUND, INC. (SCEF)

The Southern Conference for Human Welfare (SCHW)

was cited as a Communist front by the House

Committee on

Un-American Activities, House Report 592, June 12, 1947:

In the

same house report.

"The southern Patriot" was cited

as an

"organ" of the SCHW.

An amendment to the charter of the SCHW dated

April 26, 1946, changed its name to the Southern Conference

Educational Fund, Incorporated (SCEF) and stated its purpose

to be to improve the educational and cultural standards

of

the Southern people in accordance with the highest

American democratic institutions, traditions and ideals.

The masthead of the April, 1967, issue of

"The Southern Patriot" indicates that it is the publication

of SCEr, editorial

and business offices of which are

located

at 3210 West Broadway, Louisville, Kentucky,

Eastern office of which

is located at Suite 412, 799

Broadway, New York City. New York.

"The Southern Palriot"

is published once each month, except July. ScE? is stated

to be dedicated to ending discrimination based on race,

creed, color, sex, national origin or economic condition.

Carl Braden

is identified as

Executive Director

o1 SCEF and Anne Braden as editor of "The

Southern Fatriot."

Party (CP), Louisville, Kentucky, testified on December

• 119

SCEF (Continued)

continued as an independent organization, rallying support

for integration and democracy and helping to stimulate

and nurture new movements of the early 1960's. The SCEF

maintained headquarters in Louisians for twenty years, but

in 1966 moved its headquarters to Louisville, Kentucky.

A

source advised on March 2, 1961, that Claude

Lightfoot, a Communist Party functionary, stated at a meeting

of the Communist Party in Baltimore, Maryland, on February 25,

1961, that the Communist Party is not connected with any

progressive movement but indirectly they do have some influence

in the SCEF.

A second source, who is familiar with some phases

of Communist Party activity in the New Orleans area, advised

on June 3, 1966, that during the time that the SCHW

was in

existence, members of the Communist Party were members of

and worked actively in the SCHw; however, since the formation

of the SCEF, Communist Party members have not been encouraged

to work in the SCEr.

The source stated that the SCEF is

a progressive, liberal organization, which he considers a

Communist Party front organization because it has gone along

with the Communist Party on certain issues, particularly

on the racial issue.

A third source advised on May 25, 1965, that

George Meyers, a Communist Party functionary, expressed

great admiration for Carl and Anne Braden and the SCEF,

with which they are affiliated, and expressed the view

that the SCEr is the best organization in the south

as far

as doing effective work is concerned and that they have a

better idea of what they are doing, where they are heading,

and influence other organizations for the better.

The second source also advised on June 3, 1966,

that many people who are officials and supporters of the

SCEF, while liberal in their views,

are by no means Communists.

"What Is Really Happening In Cuba," placed by the Fair Play

for Cuba Committee (FPCC). This advertisement announced the

formation of the FPCC in New York City and declared the FPCC

intended to promulgate

"the truth about revolutionary Cuba" to

neutralize the distorted American press:

"The New York Times" edition of January 11, 1961,

reported that at a hearing conducted before the United States

Senate Internal Security Subcommittee on January 10, 1961,

Di. Charles A. Santos-Buch identified himself and Robert Taber

as organizers of the FPCC.

He also testified he and Taber

obtained funds from the Cuban Government which were applied

toward the cost of the aforementioned advertisement.

On May 16, 1963,

a source advised that during the

first two years of the FPCC's existence

there was a struggle

between Communist Party (CP) and Socialist Forkers Party (SWP)

elements to exert their power within the FPCC and thereby

influence FFCC policy. This source added that during the past

year there had been a

successful effort by FPCC leadership to

minimize the role of these and other organizations in the FPCC

so that

their influence as of

May, 1963, was

negligible.

The SWP has been designated pursuant to Executive

Order 10450.

On May 20, 1963, a second source advised that Vincent

"Ted" Tee, FICC National Office Director, we inen formulating

FPCC policy and had indicated that he had no intention of

permitting FPCC policy to be determined by any other organization.

This source stated that lee believed that the FPCC should .

advocate resumption of diplomatic relations between. Cuba and

the United States and should support the right of

Cubans to manage their revolution without intezterence from

othei nations. Lee did not advocate supporti?; the Cuban

revolution per se.

The November 23, 1963, edition of "The New York Times"

reported that Senator Thomas o.

Dodd of Connecticut had called

FPCC "the chief public relations instrument of the Castro network

in the United States." It is to be noted that Senator Dodd was

a member of the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee which

twice conducted hearings on the FPCC.

_UBA COMMITTEE (CONT' D)

The December 27, 1963, edition of "The New York World

regram and Sun" newspaper stated that the pro-Castro FPCC

-was seeking to go out of business and that its prime activity

during its lifetime had been sponsorship of pro-Castro street

rallies and mass picket lines, and the direction of an active

propaganda mill highlighting illegal travel-to-Cuba campaigns.

Its comparatively briei span of life was attributed to mounting

anti-Castro American public opinion, the 1962 Congressional

hearings which disclosed FPCC financing by Castro's United

Natiors Delegation, and ultimately, the bad publicity which

the FPCC received from disclosure of activities on its behalf

by suspected presidential assassin Lee H. Oswald.

On February 6, 1964, the previously mentioned second

source advised that V. T. Lee had recently remarked that the

FPCC was dead and that there were no plans to organize another

similar urganization.

On April 13, 1964, a third source advised that there

had not been any FPCC

activity in many months and that the

FPCC had been dissolved.

DEMONSTRATION PROTESTING UNITED STATES POLICY

IN VIETNAM; WASHINGTON, 3C, JANUARY 15, 1968

CONFIDENTIAL

TAIMI HALONEN and THORUN ROBEL were mildly self-

critical about not working for the programs the younger women

were promoting. TAIMI said she was tired after working long

hours on the Seattle conference to be held Saturday, January

20th at Mt. Zion Baptist Church in Seattle at which the

Seattle delegation would report. HALONEN made the observation,

however, that the women working on the program were all very

experienced leaders and she trusted they would formulate a

satisfactory program.

On Monday, January 15, 1968, the delegates including

the group from washington State, met at the Union Station in

Washington, DC: It was learned here that the instructions

which had been given the day before at the Shoreham Hotel were

evidently for the California group only, because many California

people had been badly beaten in previous demonstrations and

they were very cautious and somewhat apprehensive.

The

official pattern was different.

Mimeographed

sheets headed

"Jearrette Rankin Brigade - Information and Instructions" were

passed out and

these appeared to be the official instructions.

A reproduction is attached.

The Washington State delegation was enlarged when a

Mrs y BACKUP from Tacoma arrived.

RADER said some of the money

usually received from wealthy contributors had been collected

by Mrs. BACKUP.

Reverend HAROLD BASS of Tacoma collected

,.—

$1?0. 00, and wanted someone eise to go instead of ZErRa

( STUDAMIRE) •

RADER defended herself when TAIMI HALONEN criticized

her for bringing ZEFRA along since ZEFRA is at least six months

-pregnant.

-

After the demonstration, HEALY and RADER spent much

of the time urging the speakers to include in their talks some-

thing about the status of the American Indian.

ELLA BAKER from

New York did inciude a paragraph irom the paper the Washington

State delegation submitted to Congress.

This

was entitled,

"American indians and the Struggle for

Peace". It had been

prepared by LONNIE HEALY although at its bottom it carried the

notation

"(Prepared by the Jeannette Rankin Brigade Delegation

from Washington State)."

RADER, HEALY, and CORR became indignant because the

audience did not give a standing ovation to Mrs. MARTIN L. KING,

Jr. or any of the Negro speakers.

HEALY expressed great dissatisfaction with the

basic organization i:

the gathering.

She wanted an organi,

zational meeting instead of a rally type meeting which

occurred. HALONEN

and ROBEL agreed somewhat. HEALY implied

the whole thing was a waste of her time.

In the workshop section of the meeting, HALONEN

worked in the legislative action section; HELEN

FRENCH and

ELAINE HORSLEY in the electoral campaigns; and HEALY and

CORR in racism.

too, the younger women were very

critical. HEALY, particularly, resented having men as

"resource people" for the group.

She said she thought this

was a women's congress. TAIMI said she found herself in a

situation that was quite different in that she was working

very broad spectrum of politically and economically

oriented

individuals and it was a real

learning experience.

HORSLEY was anxious to get back home and work for peace while

the spirit of JEANNETTE RANKIN was still fresh.

She and

HELEN FRENCH expressed

the view the congress met the needs

of American women in giving a concrete program on which to work.

Tuesday, January 16, 1968, was for lobbying. The

Seattle and Tacoma people were

told

to meet at the Methodist

Building, 100 Maryland Avenue.

HALONEN, ROBEL, HEALY, HORSLEY,

and HELEN FRENCH arrived before the appointed time. After about

an hour, EMELIA CASSIDY arrived stating RADER had an eye problem

and would be unable to attend.

Mrs. BACKUP joined the group.

LINDA CORR and ZEFRA were too tired to get up so early.

group called on Washington State's Senators JACKSON and MAGNUSON,

but they were not in their offices.

After leaving a copy of

the women's petition and a questionnaire prepared by the

Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (see attachment)

they called on Washington State's Congressmen FLOYD HICKS and

BROCK ADAMS. Mr, HICKS WaS OUT OI TOWn: MIS. HORSLEY knew, the :

Congressman personally and her son knew two of the office

personnel.

She asked that they relate to him that she was

vitally interested in peace and social justice.

Congressman BROCK ADAMS was in his office and spent

about twenty minutes talking with the group concerning his

political views and some of

the political machinations of his

party.

The

group

then began to disintegrate. ELAINE HORSLEY

left to get a 2:30 flight to Boston where she would visit her

son who is attending Harvard University.

She stated she stayed at DONNA ALLEN's home there. She said

MARJORIE RADER got an eye infection which kept her from going to

RADER remained at ALLEN's residence.

troubles might be attrituted to the fact STUDAMIRE is expecting

a baby in April. Crosity stated there were too many rules to

follow.

The delegates weren't premitted to carry a nail file,

wear peace buttons, or exhibit RANKIN buttons.

They had to walk

six abreast and were not allowed to march around the White

House.

She said a suit will be brought in court for this

denial of their rights. She went on to state each person had

or was given $10.00 to carry on his person so he could not

be arrested for vagrancy.

CASSIDY said a nurse, Mrs. HELEN M., COOK, had been

very helpful to the group.

COOK told CASSIDY she could be reached

at 719 Beechwood Road, Media, Pennsylvania, if more information

is desired concerning

Veterans for Peace, which was not further

described.

GUY RADER, a CP member at this meeting, tried to stop

CASSIDY when the latter complained ZEFRA STUDAMIRE was too

immature to have been sent to the conference, but CASSIDY wasn't

easy to stop.

She was incensed over the fact money had been used

for STUDAMIRE's trip and the latter refused to cooperate.

RADER

and STUDAMIRE remained in Washington, D.C. after the conference

to handle some business

The National Congress of American

Indians opposes inis distortion of history. Beatings and murder of Indians

in raine go unchallenged. Congress voted in 195 to open up Indian land

reservations to state jurisdiction.

In actuality, this rides established

tribal courts and federal jurisdiction. It gives local bigoted authorities

more opportunity to harrass and open the way to ternination of our treaties

and in several places resulted in actual loss of land.

It Is as deadly to be an Indian in America as it is to be a soldier

in Viet Nam.

In che three years before 1907, more Indian children below the

age of lû had died in this country than the 6,628 U. S. combat casualties of

tle entire Viet Nan War (as of the end of 1960). Most of these were children

below the age of six.

The price we pay is the built-in racism our children are taught in

school, over television, in cartoons; the Indian has become a joise, to white

Anericans. We pay because we don't know our own history,

!

The thread of struggle for self-determination runs through the history

of Indian-Americans.

When a few Indian youth speak of Red Power, the roots go

deep into their history in

finding nourishment for this demand.

Just as some

Negro leaders today speak of W.E.B. DuBois as having raised the same issue of

identity long before the level of struggle, which is Black Power, arrived.

This struggle has gone on for 400 years.

The Indian people have been sending spokesmen to bring their grievances

and their positions before the power structure of this country for two hundred

They have fought in the courts since at least 1830 when the case of

the Cherokee Nation vs. Georgia tested the ability and the willingness of the

United States to protect an Indian Iribe in its efforts at self-determination.

The Vietnamese war is a continuation of the whole racist war we have

waged ajainst the Indian People. Understanding this is a part of understanding

the Viet Nam war.

We respond to what is happening to Vietnamese children, yet

the Indian people have suffered from the same policy of extermination and

destruction of their identity.

We must unite with the strivings of those who have had to deal with

United States' genocide for 200 years!

We can help io push the United States to ratify the United Nations

Resolution, "Ireaty Against Genocide", that the United States should correct

the history and policy of genicide against the Indian people.

Today this

"It is forbidden to parade, stand, or move in processions

The statute further provides that exceptions from these prescriptive provisions

Will be made in the discretion of certain Congressional leaders and/or Capitol

The exceptions are allowed on "ocassions of national

The petition of the Jeannette Rankin Brigade apparently does not become "the

The same request was made to the District

of Columbia Court of Appeals and was likewise denied. As it was then impossible

to obtain relief prior to January 15th the Brigade's attorneys are continuing the

appeal on a non-emergency basis in the Court of Appeals and have every confidence

of ultimate victory.

This is far from the last time that these women of any other Americans intend

to appear in their nation's Capitol to petition their government. Hopefully this

will be the last time that they find it so difficult to do so.

The petition of the Jeannette Rankin Brigade apparently does not become "the

cintes for public assistance and chila welfare programs.

Tr 1937.

the Washington Legislature repealed the Erupors Low of 185iy and

enacted a State social security Law. "Welrore" has boen a bone of

contention ever since.

Greenleigh Report

In 1963, the Washington Legislature appropriated $20,000 for a study

of the state's public assistance programs.

The study was nade by

Greenleigh Associates, and the Greenleigh Report was presentod

Dacembar, 1964.

report stated that public assistance grants in

Washington, with standar s based on 1959 prices and

12% ratable reductions, 1? e 40% below the minimum

standards for health and decency. Speaking of child

welfare needs, the report sald: "There 1s an excessive

and increasing rate of referral of children to the

Juvenile Courts, both for dependency and delinquency.

There 1s an excessive and increasing trend for children

to be removed from their natural families and cared

for olsewhere."

WHAT ABOUT RATABLE REDUCIIONS?..

The 1965 Legislature removed the ratable reductions. The 196?

Legislature ordered the Dept. of Public Assistance to bring 1t's

pricing standard's up to 1967 levels.

New standards were put into effect July first. Increased allowances

for rent vary from county to county.

Other allowances were increased

an average of 10-3/4%aIn King County the total Increase was 16%.

Thus, King County grants have been increased by 28% since 1964,

but the cost of llving has increased by at least 5% Grants are st1l

17% less than acceptable levels.

The maximum grant for a Seattle family consisting of

two adules, a boy 13, and a girl o, 1s $205.80 a

nonth--$3,429 a year.

But recent changes in the

Federal Social Security Law cast a shadow on even

Ihe local welfare officials will not

offer any guess as to what may happon nest.

NEW RATABLE

REDUCTIONS ARE ALWAYS A POSSIBILITY.

There is much talk of getting people off welfare by putting them to

work.

Yet who will take care of the children? Child care costs fIO

$60 to $80 per child per month in Seattle.

«CRES ACT FOK PEACE (SWAP)

A source reported on May 17, 1952, a meeting of the

Ballard-Greenwood CP Club was held in

Seattle, April 25, 1962,

at which TAIMI HALONEN was nominaïed to be the new Chairman of

this Club. Along with other business of the evening, HALONEN

said she expected to devote a good portion of her time to SWAP,

an organization of peace forces that met recently with seven

members.

She said four of the seven were from the "left" but

did not go into detail. She said the group had problems of an

organizational nature

because it was new, and she thought she

could help.

on April 5, 1963, a second source stated a meeting of

the University CP Club was held at Seattle on April 2, 1963.

KEN ROSE, a member of the Club, reported the most influential

peace organization in Seattle was SWAP.

on July 31, 1964, a meeting of the North Central CP

Section Committee was held at Seattle.

WILL PARRY, Section

Chairman, said attention should be placed

on three

political

questions - peace, civil rights, and labor. Under peace, he

said CP clubs shoula inject the

Women Act for Peace campaign

into the election campaign. At another Section meeting,

February 5, 1966, TAIMI HALONEN was praised for effective

peace work and for her help in developing unity among the peace

forces.

Section-wide concentration was urged in assisting

SWAP to visit 1,000 workers on the Vietnam

issue.

A third source advised on February 24, 1966, a

Northwest District CI Committee meeting was held at Seattle

February 12, 1966.

After lunch, the entire group participated

in passing

out leaflets pertaining to racial matters and the

Vietnam war which carried the name of SWAP, 5411 Ravenna Avenue

Northeast, Seattle, Washington 98105, which address has been

used consistently by swAP and is that of ANCI kOPpEL, aLso known

as Mrs. CHARLES KOPPEL. KOPPEL has been and continues to be

the coordinator and apparent prime motivating force of SWAP

as of May, 1967.

corruces at a meeting in

January, 1960, decided to prepare for opening a cooperative.

bookstore and directed the CP State Board to set up a Party

committee for this purpose:

The above source also reported that at a state-wide

CP conference held on August 27, 1960, CP District Chairman

BURT NELSON reported on the WCC.

NEISON announced the committee

was determined to have the bookstore opened by the earliest

possible date, probably October 15, (1960). He urged support

of the woo.

A second source in February and March, 1960, advised

a committee of CP members during those months commenced organi-

zation of the WCC with authorized capital of $2,000 which was.

to sell shares and make other plans for operation of a bookstore

selling "progressive" literature at Seattle.

In May and June,

1960, this source reported BURI NELSON, On May 18, 1960, stated

the CP District Literature Commission would concern itself with

the bookstore and other types of literature to be sold.

May 31, 1960, BURT NELSON suggested October 1, 1960, as the

tentative opening date of the bookstore.

A second source advised on November 2, 1960, the

principal aim of the WCC is to establish a bookstore in the

Seattle area inasmuch as this need has long been recognized by

the Washington State CP due to difficulties encountered in main-

taining a Party literature apparatus, and it is desired to have

available public facillties to attract supporters and sympathizers.

This source stated the WCC has obtained a location for its

bookstore at 710 Stevart Street, Seattle, and operations

commenced at that location on November 5, 1960.

A third source advised on May 1, 1967, that the wCC

held its annual meeting of shareholders at the Roosevelt Hotel,

Seattle, on April 30, 1907. As a pari

of the business at this

meeting, a report was made on the financial status of "co-op

On January 15, 1968, a group of approximately 175

women gathered at the Pennsylvania Railroad 30th Street

Station in Philadelphia, Pa.

They boarded three special

coaches on the 8:10 a.m. train for Washington, D.C.

the

group was the Philadelphia Contingent of the Jeannette Rankin PA DC

When all were assembled, the group marched in orderly

fashion to Union Square near the Capitol. Prior to the march

it was announced that a small group of women would present

their petition to Congress,

On April 17, 1959, a confidential source advised

Ehat on February 12, 1959, a Socialist Workers Party

(SWP)

minority group under the leadership of National Committee

member SAM BALLAN, split from the SWP.

The source stated that this minority groud,

referred to as the Marcyites, after many years of program

and policy differences on varied issues concerning tactics

and interpretation of political events, split from the swi

on the

grounds that the Party was liquidating itself by

departing from the Marxist precepts of LEON TROTSKY and

retreating from the fight for the world socialist

revolution.

The final issue which ultimately forced the

split was

the ninority's opposition to the SWP regroupment

policy which involved cooperation with the Communist Party.

(CP) periphery-individuals characterized by the minority

as petty-bourgeois.

the minority program, according to the source:

advocated unconditional defense of the Soviet Union and has

as its goal the building of a revolutionary party with a

complete proletarian orientation for the purpose of overthrowing

capitalism in the United States and throughout the world.

On May 12, 1960, source advised that this minority

group had chosen the name Workers World Party.

..

On May 1, 1967, a second confidential source

advised that the Workers World Party, which maintains head- •

quarters at 46 West 21st Street, New

York, lew lork, supports

the People's ReDublic of China in its ideological dispute

with the soviet Unior.

The SWP and CP have been designated

pursuant to. Executive Order 10450.

Re San Francisco airtel and letterhead memorandum

to the Buneau, dated 1/16/68.

This matter was opened by the San Francisco

Office

on November 1?, 1967, on receipt of information from sr 1773-5

that an organization

known as the Jeannette Rankin Brigade had

sent out a call for a demonstration to be held at the White

House, Washington, D. C., on January 8, 1968, in protest of

the war in Vietnam.

As noted in referenced San Francisco

communication, the above efforts culminated in a demonstration

at Ser. Francisco, California, on January 15, 1968, and a companion

ciemonstration held in Washington, D. C., on January 15, 1968.

A review of the San Irancisco files in the above matter

reflects that NIKKI'BRIDGES, San Francisco Chairman of tha Seisque

on Manch 2, 1967, listed as a recipient of'a new yearly sub-

GOW/ sms :

On January 31, 1968, at a mectie of the Marin

Peace and Freedom

a general discussion concerning ine brigade, it vas felt

that the group did not want the Brigade to become another

formalized group, but rather keep the Brigade as a loose

organization, and as an umbrella group for the WILPF.

San Francisco files in addition reflect that:

there has not been at any time a known group of members

of the Brigade; rather the organization has been sponsored

by women on both a local and national level, many of whom

ano nembers of varied women's peace groups.

In view of the above information, indicating a lack

of specific membership and future activity, no further inves-

tigation is being conducted by the San Francisco Office under

the Jeannette Ranti: Iriguie caption at the present time, VACB.

This matter will be closely followed and should any

future information received by the San Francisco effice arzaar

to varrant additional investigation, this matter will be reopened.

advised that all information

which had been developed by that

January march on Washington and the supporting local demonstration

in Chicago January 15, 1968. They had no knowledge that any

meetings or other activitios have boon hold subsequent to that

time andrare of

the opinion that the organization as a continuing

affair did not "get off the ground" in Chicago.

Information concerning the January demonstrations vas

received at that time from numerous Chicago informants.

and others in a position to learn of any subsequent activity were

alerted through frequent contacts and have advised they have no

knowledge of continuance of the Brigade as an active organization.

over poor to support the aggressive war policy that is killing

for a march from the Justice Department to the Pentagon,

than Irom the pentagon to the Justice Department, but that

no permit had been obtained as yet.

It was pointed out that

a march from the pentagon to the Justice Department was

preferred as there would be less chance of losing marchers

en route to the Justice Department than from marching

from the Justice Department to the Pentagon. It was stated

that no buses had been chartered at NY, but it was hoped that

It is rather a law firm comprised of a group

of lawyers interested and sympathetic to the

New Left and Black Power organizations, and who

counsel and derend individuals in these groups

They likewise permit

the Women's National March on April 10, 1971, and that the

people in Washington, D.C. will make the ultimate decision

regarding the route of the march.

on March 24, 1971, the second source made available

Committee" concerning the national women's march on the

Pentagon on April 10. This literature contained in part as

follows:

"We are going to the pentagon on April 10 to

serve notice on our enemies that women are moving against

them.

Our urgency and our fury at the expansion of the

Indochinese war and our rage at the repression of our black

and brown sisters and brothers needs expression right now.

We are joining with other women to struggle for the everyday

things we need and against whatever and whoever prevents us

from getting them.

"We need and want our sisters around the country

to build for this action in their own ways, and to communicate

with other sisters their ideas,

suggestions

and criticisms.

STUDENTS FOR A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY

Students for a Democratic Society, commonly

known as SDS, came into existence at a founding convention

held during June, 1962, at Port Huron, Michigan. From an

initial posture of "participatory democracy," Marxist-

• Leninist ideology of various shadings became predominant

during 1968-1969 with debate centering on how best to create

a revolutionary youth movement.

SDS moved from involvement

in the civil rights struggle to an anti-Vietnam war position

to advocacy of a militant anti-imperialist line linking up

the oppressed peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America

with the black liberation movement in the United States.

All major factions within SDS embrace Marxism-Lenism

and identify internationally with China, Cuba and North

Vietnam as countries leading the worldwide struggles

against the United States.

However, the Soviet Union

was regarded as imperialist and with the Communist Party,

United States of America, "I-visionist" in nature.

SDS operated under a national constitution which

called for an annual Nationa. Convention (NC) and quarterly

National Council meetings wherein programs were initiated

and debated. Three national officers were elected

annually

with a National Interim Committee to run the organization.

Regional offices and college chapters elected delegates to

the national meetings but each functioned independently on

local matters.

Its official publicition "Fire" (formerly

"New Left Notes") last appeared in lecember, 1969.

Internal factionalism of serious proportions

developed during 1968 - 1969 and tie following three factions

evolved as a result of a split at he June, 1969, NC:

Weatherman, Worker Student Alliance (WSA), and Revolutionary

Youth Movement (RYM) •

effect of the split on SDS chapters

throughout the country was divisive.

Some aligned with one

of the other of the three major factions.

Others, unable to

identify with any faction, disassociated with SDS

completely

and changed names.

The SDS national office in recent years was

located at 1608 West Madison Street, Chicago, Illinois.

WEATHERMAN

A'PENDIX

-.

Initially called the "Action Faction," Weatherman

came into being inmediately before the June, 1969, Students

for a Democratic Society (SDS) National Convention (NC).

At this iC Weatherman won all three national officer positions

and a majority of the National Interim Committee as well.

subsequently, they took over the SDS National Office (NO)

in Chicago, and controlled its funds, paper and national

records. Although internal struggle existed until late 1969,

weatherman for all major purposes controlled soS nationally

from June, 1969, until its 1:0 closed in rebruary, 1970. At

this time it no longer considered itself part of

SDS.

The term Weatherman emerged fron an ideological

paper prepared by its leaders entitled

"You Don't weed a

weatherman to know Which Way the Wind Blows" /"New Left

stance of Weatherman: Marxist-leninist in content but with

strong advocacy that

action not theory would bring about

revolution in the United States.

This posture was complemonted

with an international identification to

the Cuban revolution

and CASTRO's statement that the duty of a revolutionary is

to make revolution.

During October, 1969, Weatherman riots in

Chicago resulted in more than 260 arrests for nob action

anâ related charges.

A program of armed struggle was

finalized during a December, 1969, "War Council" wherein

terrorist tactics and political assassination were

contemplated.

The basic strength of Weatherman was then

revealed to be some 300 - 350 nationally and geographically

apportioned to the Midwest, New York, and some Northwest.

As its rhetoric of violence escalated, Weatherman

leaders increasingly discussed the necessity of

an underground

operation wherein more than 90 percent of the organization

would be submerged; "affinity groups" of three - five members

would function independently.

In February, 1970, Weatherman

leaders announced a program of "strategic sabotage" with

Source further advisel that during late Summer,

1969, the PLP faction of SDS established its National

Headquarters (NH) on the second floor of a loft-type

building at 173A Massachusetts Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts.

The campaign on which the PLP faction

centered was to build

a worker student alliance or a sampus worker student

alliance. Thus, they adopted the names of Worker Student

Alliance (WSA) or Campus Worker Student Alliance.

Source stated that the "New Left Notes," printed

in New York City, is the official publication of the WSA

faction.

A second source advised during January,

1970,

that within the SDS, the WSA is a caucus of which the PLP

constitutes the leadership.

A third source advisel during July, 1970, that

during demonstrations staged ir the Boston area during the

Spring and Summer of 1970 by the NH, the main theme of

previous demonstrations staged oy the NH shifted from

protestations of the Vietnam War and other United

REVOLUTIONARY YOUTH MOVEMENT

A source advised that the Revolutionary Youth

Movement II (RYMII) faction of Students for a Democratic

Society (SDS) held a national conference at Atlanta, Georgia,

from November 26 to 30, 1969. At this conference it was

decided to form a new organization to be known as Revolutionary

Youth Movement (RYM), characterized as a mass anti-imperialist

youth organization, said organization being proposed rhe

separate and distinct in form and content from SDS.

"principles of Unity" adopted by the conference included a

why adopter bot

struggle against white supremacy and male supremacy: fights

against imperialism, anticommunism, fascism and oppression

of youth; and support of the right of self-determination of

all "oppressed nations," also support of the right of all

"oppressed and exploited"

peoples "to armed self-defense."

It was agreed that RyM would not be a Marxist-Leninist

organization; however, source said this was decided in order

to indicate an organization broad enough in form to

be

acceptable to everyone. A temporary National Steering

Committee (NSC) made up of eight females and two males was

of eight Feme

elected to govern RYM until national officers could be

elected during the Spring of 1970.

RYM publications have listed the RYM National Office

(NO) at Post Office Box 5421 and Post Office Box 77012 C,

both Atlanta, Georgia, and a second source has advised that

the NO has no office space but would probably be considered as

located at Apartment 27, 1067 Alta Avenue, Northeast, Atlanta.

Second source advised that women dominated the

founding conference and have continued to dominate NSC

meetings to the point that "women's liberation" has apparently

become the RYM's principal issue - also that RYM's poor

financial condition has resulted in its failure to publish

a paper.

During early 1970, RYM has decided to cater to

the working class rather than youth, since the potential for

social revolution lies in workers.

A third source has stated that it was decided at

the March, 1970, NSC meeting that RYM women had decided the

organization will be molded into a "working class, Marxist-

Leninist, revolutionary, anti-imperialist, problack

nationalist, people's women's liberation organization."

According to the article, "The Progressive Labor

Movement was founded in 1962, by MILTON ROSEN and MORTIMER

SCHEER after they were expelled from the Communist Party of

the United States for assertedly following the Chinese

Communist line."

A source advised on June 3, 1968, that the PLP

held its Second National Convention in New

to June 2, 1968, at which time the PLP reasserted its

objective of the establishment of a militant working class

movement based

I on Marxism-Leninism.

the next convention.

The PLP publishes "Progressive Labor," a bimonthly

magazine, and "Challenge-Desafio,"

" a monthly newspaper.

Source advised on May 25, 1970, that the PLP

According to information received from the Washington Field

Office and Domestic Intelligence Division, the y'April Tenth Women's Committee"

of New York City, a recently formed group of women's protest organizations,

plans a "'March on the Pentagon" on Saturday, 4/10/71, as an anti-war protest.

Plans call for the protesters, who may number as many as 5,000, to assemble

at L'Enfant Square, Constitution Avenue, between Seventh and Ninth Streets,

Northwest, between 11:00 a.m. and noon, and thereafter march to the Pentagon

via Constitution Avenue and Memorial Bridge. The demonstration is scheduled.

to end around 5:00 p.m. The Committee has reportedly chartered 14 busses

capable of carrying 630 passengers from New York City to Washingto. The

busses are scheduled to unload at the Justice Building, where it is reported the

women will demonstrate. It is noted that L'Enfant Square, the assembly point

for the demonstrators, is within one block of the Justice Building. The protesters

are then scheduled to march to the Pentagon, where they will hold another

demonstration and will be picked up by the busses at the Pentagon.

General Services Administration (GSA) and Department security

officials are cognizant and plan to reinforce the guard force at the Tenth Street

Auto Entrance, which is the only Justice Building entrance open on Saturday.

Since we do not conduct tours on Saturday, no adjustment in our tours is neces-

sary.

Boston file 100-38735 entitled "EVAN PATCHEN

DELLINGER, aka PATCH DELLINGER; SM - ANARCHIST (BUFILE

100-450998)" reflected that DELLINGER was subject of

Boston investigation based on his participation in a

"Teach-In"

and Rededication Service on 1/29/68 at the

Arlington St. Church, boston. During the above activity,

DELLINGER made a statement in support of the "Resistance

Group" and turned in what was reported to be Selective

Service cards.

The primary function of the Resistance Group

was to aid, abet, and counsel young men faced with the

draft.

EVAN PATCHEN DELLINGER graduated from Swarthmore

College, Swarthmore, Pa., on 6/6/66 majoring in economics.

He was arrested at Chester, Pa. on 4/1/54 and was charged

with disorderly conduct.

The 1968-59 Harvard University Directory of

Officers and Students reflected that DELLINGER was enrolled

in the School of Medicine, Harvard University, Cambridge,

Mass.

It had been reported that PATCH DELLINGER was

present at a Socialist Workers Party (SWP) Street Meeting

in New York City on 7/21/64.

The file further disclosed that inasmuch as the

Boston office had no current information associating DELLIN-

GER with the SWP or the Young Socialist Alliance and that:

his activities on behalf of the New England Resistance were

pacifist in nature, it was felt that DELLINGER did not

warrant inclusion on the Security or Agitator Indexes main-

tained at that time; and thus, the case was placed in a closed

status.

based on his participation in the previously mentioned

Rededication Services at the Arlington St. Church in Boston

on 1/29/68 at which 23 individuals turned in either a

Notice of Classification and/or a Registration Certificate.

Two other individuals turned in some other type of document.

It was determined that DELLINGER had turned in a Selective

Service Registration Certificate and two Notices of Classi-

fication issued by LB #28, Flemington, New Jersey. Also,

a two-page statement signed PAICHEN DELLINGER supporting

the Resistance movement was turned in.

In April, 1972, AUSA, Boston declined any prosecu-.
