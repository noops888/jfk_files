Women's Bail Fund

Unless otherwise stated, all sources in
this memorandum have furnished reliable
information in the past.

On March 30, 1971, a fist confidential source
furnished literature, concerning the Women's Bail Fund, which
was picked up at the Upper Westside Womens Center, 627
Amsterdam Avenue, New York, New York (NY) on March 27, 1971.

The literature captioned, "Women's Bail Fund" argued that the
Women's House of Detention, in New York City (NYC), should

not exist and that "the Women's House of Detention, along with the
prisons and jails across the country, is a weapon used by the
power structure here in America to oppress and exploit the people
of poor communities." It further relates that "Women have come
together in New York from many different organizations to form a
Women's Bail Fund for all the sisters inside the House of
Deention. The Bail Fund is also working to prepare simple
pamphlets on law because of the total lack of any legal

resources in the House of Detention and secure legal assistance
where needed." The address is listed as the Women's Bail Fund,
P.O. Box 637, Cooper Station, NY, NY 10003.

on August 26, 1971, the first source furnished
literature on the Women's Bail Fund which stated, "The women's
Bail Fund is a coalition of Third World and white women who are:

".....raising bail to release women prisoners from
Rikers Island,

"establishing communication with women inside.

".,..assisting women who are bailed out in meeting
their needs,

"....providing legal information for prisoners.
"....making public the torture these women undergo.
"...supporting prison struggles everywhere."

On April 12, 1971, a second confidential source
made available a flyer on the Women's Bail Fund which was
distributed at the National Womens March on the Pentagon on
April 10, 1971. The flyer, captioned, "Victory to the NLF and All
Oppressed Peoples" states "Women in Vietnam and in the United
States are fighting for the right to live: for the very right
to exist.....the U.S, is now dotted with concentration camps for
the poor and non-white: the jails.....But imprisonment doesnt!

their dignity, they organize and fight back. When one sister is
beaten they organiz and resist. In the coldest part of winter
when the boilers had broken down, the women worked in freezing
temperatures in cold water to do the laundry-not ‘because the
figs made us do it - but for our ‘own beautiful sisters.' .....We
Vietnamese, Black, Latin, White and Asian-american women are
united in our struggle - we share common go0als and face a common
enemy. We express our complete solidarity with the NLF and shall
work to bring the victory there."

On May 14, 1971, Special Agents (SAS) of the Federal.
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) observed a demonstration in front
of the NYC Women's House of Detention sponsored by the Woments
Bail Fund and Youth Against War and Fascism (YAWF). The
demonstrators chanted slogans calling for release of their
"sisters" from jail and expressed opposition to a proposed move
of the inmates of the Women's House of Detention from its
downtown site to the Rikers Island Prison Facility. The
demonstrators called this proposed move an attempt to isolate
the "sisters from their supporters."

By means of a loudspeaker, the demonstrators called to
several inmates of the House of Detention who appeared in the
upper storey windows, obtained their names and place of arrest.
This information allegedly was to be used to obtain bail for the
prisoners in question. Thereafter, several speakers denounced
the jails as concentration camps and called for the release of the
"political prisoners.,",in the House of Detention. Among the
speakers was Shirley/Taylor of the Women's Bail Fund and a
former inmate of thé Women's House of Detention,

“fy

A first confidential source advised that Beverly, Sterner,
Channel 13 News, 304 West 58th Street, New York, New York,

is affiliated with the Women's Bail Fund (WBF).

An article appeared in the March, 1972 issue of
the "Liberated Guardian", captioned "Women's Bail Fund;
Organizing Our Anger", written by five unidentified members
of the Women's Bail Fund Collective.

The article relates "The Women's Bail Fund is a
group of about 35 women in New York City that bails women
out of jail (150 so far). They have been organized for over
a year and a half and did their first bailout on December 20,
1970, They have been active in supporting other groups
involved in the prison struggle. They do legal follow-up
for bailed-out sisters who want it and have been talking
with people about the prison struggle, why jails exist, who
the real enemies are, etcetera."

The article is introduced’ by the following
statement:

"For this article we wanted to talk about ourselves.
So five of us volunteered to collect different thoughts from
as many women as possible in our group and then pooled these
reflections in this article, using the words from their raps."

The article, being reflections of the various
members of the group, is a series of quotes by unidentified
members concerning the WBF.

Women's Bail Fund

The following are reflections of some WBF
members carried under the subcaption "Our Roots - Why
We Started - Why We Joined".

"There was a woman in my consciousness-raising
group who was in the bail fund when it was first getting
started and she talked with others about it. To some of
us it was a very exciting idea. To others it was
frightening - connecting to political activity as women.
Ultimately it ended in a split of my small group on
whether we should carry our newly raised consciousness
to any sort of feminist political action or not.

"In the past, I was politically frustrated because
I was only involved in one-shot actions. I saw what was
happening in terms of how this system functions to oppress
black people and that resulted inalot of pain for me. I
felt I had to reflect my stands in a day-to-day struggle.
I had the sense that the women in the WBF were also aware
of that need.

“When sisters want us to, we go to court with them.
When I go to court I find that it can do bad things to my
head. I make judgements like this jude is better than another
one, but it's all shit. All judges are pigs. Or like
feeling good that a sister got six months instead of five
years when she shouldn't have gotten anything at all.

"I was in the House of Detention when there was the
bail fund demonstration on December 20, 1970. The whole
tier was so excited. When someone saw the first people she
let out a scream and everyone rushed to the windows. As
the chanting increased outside we started to sing and chant.
They locked us in our cells so each person would be isolated
and intimidated about chanting. But all the women kept it
up. Everyone inside said the feeling about this demonstration
was different than other demonstrations. There had been more
contact. The women saw Afeni and Joan and another woman
that they had known inside outside in the demonstration.

That was real important.

"A lot of it was the bail fund. The bail fund
banner with the address made it real that people were serious
about supporting people inside. It wasn't going to be a
one-shot deal.

Women's Bail Fund
The following are reflections carried under.the
sub-caption "Questions We Are Facing Right Now",

“There's a real dialectic between reform amd
revolution. So much of what we do is short-term support
stuff that can be seen as reformist. When prisoners raise
these demands it's understood to be revolutionary; when
people on the outside raise them, they are felt to be
reformist, I have done a whole lot of courtroom work,
both in the bail fund and before too. In fact, the whole
social work thing is what I come out of, which is why it
is so hard for me to deal with all this ('cause I obviously
reflect a lot of that work). Social work when it started
back in the late 1800's and early 1900's came out of real
radical circles, the radicals and feminists and such. And
when you read MAO, he talks about service to the people
as a revolutionary thing. But for us it feels weird
because it has been co-opted. I think that the movement
now, trying to recoup the revolutionary aspects, that
original sense of service to the people, trying to help
people survive.

“One of the ways to really keep ourselves
out of the rut of being social workers is to engage in
more political education among ourselves and to ask other
groups how they've dealt with this question. Also we
should be more involved in educating other people.

"We should be doing more for women inside. We
need to really work on facilitating communications
between the sisters inside the jail. Women prisoners
have been slower to get organized but I'm sure this is
because there is so much isolation in the women's jail.
Concretely, we need to write more letters to find out what
is going on, send literature, but also tell the women.about
each other, about what other women are thinking and feeling.
This would stop the sense of isolation and increase the
sense of solidarity.

. ."I think much of the movement is guilty of
ultra-leftism. In China the Communists worked on a lot
of things that were a lot less than what they ultimately
wanted. We're too afraid of being contaminated by being
involved in reform movements. We too often define our
enemies too broadly and our allies too narrowly.

"I've been real impressed with what women in the
group are willing to commit themselves to do and that they
fulfill those commitments. And that atmosphere of res-
ponsibility affects new members too, This is real
important. It helps me through the rough times and all
the ideological hassles and struggles we go through.

You really have a sense that everyone really wants. to work
things through, search for solutions, wants to hold
together because we feel responsible for the work, Even
the way people ask for leaves of absence when they are
sick or too busy, that they feel they want to explain

why they have to stop doing work for a while, shows
people's commitment and responsibility."

.The "Liberated Guardian" was created in
April, 1970, through active and violent
dissent against the politics and policies

of the "Guardian", Its major aims were

to produce a "more revolutionary" paper,

to operate collectively within it and to
maintain by design a loose political position.

The "Guardian" is self-described as an
"independent radical newsweekly" which
takes a strong left position but is not
identified with any organized group. It
is considered to be the largest radical
weekly in America.

A second confidential source advised an account
for the WBF was opened on July 6, 1971, for $3,500. The
account was closed ten days later on July 16, 1971. This
account was opened by Patricia,Reiner of 2451 Aldrich y
Avenue South, Minneapolis. Reiner, on August 30, 1971, {
submitted a forwarding address of 855 South Cedar Lane,
Valparaiso, Indiana, 46383. panes

A third confidential source advised the WBF"
set aside money for ConstanceXTrimble at the First National
Bank, Minneapolis, Minnesota. ' The source advised two accounts
were opened for the WBF on behalf’of Trimble. One account
was a savings account in the amount of $2,000; the other
was a checking account in the amount of $3,800. “The
trustees for these accounts were listed as Neil B.» Dietrich

Constance Trimble was tried and found
not guilty on a charge of first degree
murder for making a telephone call
which lured a St. Paul, Minnesota
police officer to an ambush slaying
which occurred in 1970.

On April 5, 1972, and April 8, 1972, a fourth
confidential source advised Jennifer Dohrn and Judith
Clark were in contact with various members of the WBF
on these two days.

Judith Ann Clark is a member of the
Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) -
Weatherman faction and was underground
in_1970 prior to her arrest on December 17,
1970 by Special Agents (SAS) of the FBI
New York City, as a result of an outstanding
arrest wanted for unlawful flight to avoid
prosecution - mob action. Clark was
indicted by a Federal Grand Jury at
Chicago, Illinois in April, 1970, prior

to her arrest. She was sentenced to

three years, for which she spent nine
months in the Cook County Jail, Chicago,
Illinois, and was released in July, 1971,
to serve the remaining time on probation
in New York City.

Jennifer Ellen Dohrn is the sister of
FBI Top Ten Fugitive Bernadine Rae Dohrn.
Both sisters are alleged members of

the SDS - Weatherman faction.

SDS was founded during June, 1962, at

Port Huron, Michigan, and in the 1960's

Internal factionalism during 1969 produced
three main factions: Weatherman, Revolutionary
Youth Movement (RYM), and Worker Student
Alliance (WSA). The Weatherman and RYM no
longer consider themselves associated with

the SDS. The WSA faction continues to use

On April 14, 1972, a fifth confidential source
advised that Judith Clark was in touch on April 3, 1972,
with a Beth Last Name Unknown (LNU), at 466 East 48th
Street, Brooklyn, New York, concerning the WBF,

The source advised that Clark, on November 5,
1972, was in touch with an unknown female and discussed
the Wednesday night meeting of the WBF. Clark discussed
the fact that Jeannie LNU, Estelle LNU and Laurie LNU
would be at the meeting at 5:30 PM, that evening at Clark's
residence. The source related that Sara LNU and Naomi LNU,
both from the Defense Bail Fund, were also expected at
the meeting. Clark discussed the fact that the WBF
has no common politics and no common political direction
at this point and the WBF could become a defense committee,
not because it would be desireable, but because of a lack
of any other direction.

The source\advised that_on the same day, Clark
was in touch with AmyALobenstine from the WBF at telephone
number 663-1136, and both agreed to attend an education
meeting of the Fund. 4 Le

The fifth confidential source further related
that Clark was in contact, on April 8, 19%2, witha soe
Marilyn Dalismer, 254-4498, and a ShelleyMhawrence, jo"
663-1136. Both were identified by the sourke as being
associated with the WBF.

On 11/28/72, INFORMANT wdvised the Women's Bail Fund ,
(WBF) is not a leading element and lacks any influence in the
movement in New York City. .

A review of the subject file discloses there is no
structure to the WBF and that it is a coalition of women who
belong to various groups in the New York City area,’ whose main
purpose is to raise funds for selected women in jail.

It ig noted that Weatherman subjects have contacted
those involved in the bail fund. However, have decryed the
lack of political direttion of the WBF and would like to turn
it into a defense committee because of a lack of any’ other
direction, There is no indication,that this has occurred, and .
the bail fund still remains a loose coalition or Lik -minded
individuals from various groups see! to salse Vusds for
various purposes. Because of its lack
ection, it has had no influence and presently is ineffective in
the movement.

In view of the above, the -NYO is discontinuing investi-

information from sources that the bail fund is being redirected
as a structured group for a common political and ideological

Re: Vincent Hallinan

Vincent Hallinan was candidate for President
of the United States on the Independent Progressive Party
ticket in 1952. This party was formed in California in 1948
and ceased to exist in 1964, when it failed to poll sufficient
votes to remain on a California ballot. The California
Senate Fact-Finding Committee on Un-American Activities in
its 1955 report on page forty-six, states in part that the
Independent Progressive Party in California was quickly
captured by the communists and soon was being operated lock,
stock and’barrei by the Communist Party of California.

A source advised on April 20, 1966, that Vincent
Hallinan was the Treasurer for American Institue For Marxist
Studies (AIMS).

A characterization of AIMS

is contained in the appendix.

According to the source, it is the aim and
objective of Vivian Hallinan when she goes to Washington,
D.C., in conjunction with the Kankin Brigade to get herself
arrested as she believes that nothing can be accomplished
unless the women are arrested and then dc their talking
from jail.

A source reported on May 17, 1962, a meeting of the
Ballard-Greenwocd CP Club was held in Seattle, April 25, 1962,
at which TAIMI HALONEN was nominated to be- the new Chairman of
this Club. Along with otner business of the evening, HALONEN
said she expected to devote a good portion of her time to SWAP,
an organization of peace forces that met recently with seven
members. She said four of the seven were from the "left" but
did not go into detail. She said the group had problems of an
organizational nature because it was new, and she thought she
could help,

On April 5, 1963, a second source stated a meeting of
the University CP Club was held at Seattle on April 2, 1963.
KEN ROSE, a member of the Club, reported the most influential
peace organization in Seattle was SWAP.

On July 31, 1964, a meeting of the North Central CP
Section Committee was held at Seattle. WILL PARRY, Section
Chairman, said attention should be placed on three political
questions - peace, civil rights, and labor. Under peace, he
said CP clubs should inject the Women Act for Peace campaign
into the election campaign. At another Section meeting,
February 5, 1966, TAIMI HALONEN was praised for effective
peace work and for her help in developing unity among the peace
forces. Section-wide concentration was urged in assisting
SWAP to visit 1,000 workers on the Vietnam issue.

BRIGADE FORMED TO CONFRONT CONGRESS

Helena, Montana
November 27, 1967

To all American Women:

I am proud of the fact that my first
vote cast in Congress was a vote
against war. It was the first oppor-
unity for a woman to vote, because I
was the first woman to be elected to
Congress.

I believed then, as I do today,
that women are the ones that must be
concerned with the needs and develop-
ment of the human race. I have always
fought for the dignity of all human
beings - for those of the present as
well as those of future generations.

I will continue to struggle as long
as I live. I hope all women will res-
pond to the following call and join me
in Washington on January 8, 1968, the
opening day of Congress.

Jeannette Rankin

A CALL TO ALL AMERICAN WOMEN who
are outraged by the ruthless slaughter
in Vietnam and the persistent neglect
of human needs at home TO COME TO
WASHINGTON ON JANUARY 8

AMERICAN WOMEN represent 51% of the
voting population of our country.
AMERICAN WOMEN have the power to a~
chieve peace and a decent life for
every American. This is woman power!

\

Demonstrate it to the Congress of the
United States! Come to Washington on
January 8 as Congress opens in joint
session. Support Jeannette Rankin as
she leads a representative delegation
of American women to the Capitol to
demand that:
*Congress, as its first order
of business, resolve to end
the war in Vietnam and immedi~
ately arrange for the with-
drawal of all American troops.
*Congress use its power to make
reparations for the ravaged land
we leave behind in Vietnam.
*Congress listen to what the
American people are saying and
refuse the insatiable demands of
the military-industrial complex.

WOMEN OF AMERICA, our power is un~
limited.
will:

*PETITION the United States Con-
gress . a hd
*CONVENE a Congress of American
Women that afternoon to develop

- programs to meet the crisis in
America - programs which will
express our political power,
reason and conscience.

For further information about the
Brigade, contact your nearest WSP
group or write to the Jeannett@’Rankin
Brigade, 133 W. 72 St., N-¥, 10033.

IN VIETNAM, WASHINGTON, D. C., JANUARY 8, 1968
INFORMATION CONCERNING (INTERNAL SECURITY)

The following information has besn made available
by sources who have furnished reliable information in the
past: |

Source One reported on December 7, 1967, that copies
of "La Wisp", monthly newsletter of the Southern California
Council of the Women Strike for Peace (WSP - see appendix)
being mailed to the WSP mailing list on that date contained
a "Call" from the Jeannette Rankin Brigade (JRB) "To all
American women", announcing a proposed march on Washington,
D. C., on January 8, 1968, when the United States Congress
opens in joint session. This march would be to demand that
Congress, as its first order of business, resolve to end
the war in Vietnam and immediately arrange for the with-
drawal of all American troops. (A xerox duplication of the
first page of the above-mentioned December 1967 issue of
"Ila Wisp", containing this “Call", is appended to this
memorandum.

The partial list of JRB' sponsors included in this
issue of the "La Wisp", contained the names of only two
women presently active in the Southern California area,
Mary Clarke (see characterization of her in the appendix
page on WSP), and motion picture actress Leslie Parrish.

Source One has advised that Parrish has only
recently become interested in activities of WSP and has
attended less than five WSP activities, Source Two reported

Angeles). .She has formerly been a member of the American
Federation of Radio and Television Artists, and is currently
a member in good standing with the Screen Actors Guild,
Hollywood, her dues being paid through May 1, 1968.

According to Source Cne, the Southern California
Council of WSP is presently coordinating local activity to
form a contingent of -the JRB from Southern California. They
\ are making office space and telephones in their Los Angeles
headquarters, 5899 lest Pico Boulevard, Los Angeles available
\ for this purpose. Spearneading the local committee are
\ Mary Clarke and Eva Korn, both of whom are active in WSP.
Mary Clarke is currently a member of the JRB's National Steer-
ing Committee.

Source Three reported during November 1947, that
Eva Korn was a member of the Los Angeles County
Conmunist Party (ASCCP) during the years 1946
and 1947.

To give publicity to the proposed activity of the
dJRB, the local WSP office is circulating a reprint from the
"San Francisco Chronicle", issue of Saturday, May 20, 1967,
page nine, which contained a feature article regarding the
opposition to wars by former Congresswoman Jeannette Rankin,
for whom the JRB has been named. (A xerox copy of the reprint

are making their respective speakirig engagements across the
United States since their return from a trip to North Vie tnam,

fall of 1967. : —

Source Four advised during the summer of 1965
that June Sunderland, 3730 Hollister Avenue,
Santa Barbara, Califor nia, had attended a 1967
"peace conference” in Helsinki, Finland, at the
invitation of the Communist Party (CP), and that
funds to cover her expenses were raised in part
by the CP; and that following her attendance at
the Helsinki affair she went on to Russia for ten
days at the invitation and expense of the Soviet
Government.

Source One learned that a communication was re-
ceived from eastern sponsors of the JRB on December 7, 1967,
indicating that the JRB march on Washington might not be
held on January 8, 1968, but possibly would be set back until
either the 15th or 22nd of January 1968, depending upon
the date that the United States Congress would reconvene,
The communication indicated that since the entire purpose
of the Brigade would be to confront the opening joint session
of Congress that it would be futile to schedule the march
prior to the date Congress would reconvene. The suggestion
was made that recruitment of local womeri to participate in
the SRB be held in abeyance until a confirmation had been
obtained indicating the date on which Congress would reconvene,

aeaua Source One, had indicated that although the "Call",

as reproduced in Te) Wiso", states, "There will be local
actions across the country at the same time as the action
.in Washington, D. C,, " that there are no current plans for

COMMUNIST INFILTRATION OF THE
WOMEN STRIKE FOR PEACE,
Also Known, As.
Women's International Strike for Peace

A source advised on May 14, 1967, that the Women
Strike for Peace (WSP) tn the Southern California area began
its operations in the lete fall of 1961, as an affiliate
of the national organization formed in Washington, D.C, It
is a peace oriented women's organization. which is opposed
to the present American foreign policy in Vietnam. It has
also sought legislation which vould bring ebout the abolition
of the House Committee on Un-American Activities. (HCUA). In
recent months the organization has sponsored demonstrations
protesting the United States involvement in Vietnam and
ealling for the complete withdrawal of all United States
troops from Vietnam, In the spring of 1966, it was instrumental
in originating and putting into effect a campaign advocating
support for "peace candidates" in the upcoming 1966 Congressional
elections, oy : aans

The same source stated that WSP is a non-membership
organization and has no officers. The organization is open
to women of ail political opinions who are interested in world
peace, It makes no effort to exclude from its activities
menvers of, or persens sympathetic to, the Communist Party’
and related groups. PEELE . :

The guiding force behind thé Southern California
WSP groups is MARY CLARKE. A second source advised in July,

W.E.B. DU BOIS CLUBS OF AMERICA (DCA)

A source advised that on October 26-27, 1963, a con-
ference of members of the Communist Party, USA (CPUSA), including
national functionaries, met in Chicago, Illinois, for the purpose
of setting in motion forces for the « blishm anew national
Marxist -oriented youth organization which wou. unt, foo the most
peaceful transition to socialism. The delegates w told that it
would be reasonable to assume that the young sociaiists attracted
into this new organization would eventually pass into the CP

itself.

A second source has advised that the founding convention
for the new youth organization was held from June .29--21, 1964,
at 150 Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco, Califoonin, at which
time the name W.E.B.DuBois Clubs of America (DCA) was adopted.
Approximately 500 delegates from throughout the United States
attended this convention.

The second source advised in September, 1966, that MIKE
ZAGARELL, CPUSA Youth Director, stated that in Negro communities
the Party still supported the plan to build "left" socialist
centers and to solidify the Party base through the DCA. This
scurce also advised in Septoaber, 1966 that DAN SL RUBIN, CPUSA
National Organizational Secretary, stated the Party believes
the DCA should have a working-class outlook and be a mass organiz-
ation favorable to socialism, socialist countries’ and Marxism,
and in April, 1967, advised GUS HALL, CPUSA General Sécretary,
had indicated the DCA primary emphasis should be on developing
mass resistance to the draft.

A third: source advised in September, 1967, that JARVIS
TYNER was elected chairman of the DCA on September 10, 1967, at
the Third National Convention of the DCA held in New York, New

York, from September 8-10, 1967.

A fourth source advised during August, 1967, that JARVIS
TYNER is a member of the National Committee of the CPUSA.

-~' A fifth source advised on September 21, 1967, that the

headquarters of the DCA is located at 34 West 17th Street, New
York, New York.

Women Strike for Peace

The "Berkeley Daily Gazette," a daily newspaper of
general circulation published in Berkeley, California,
contained an article in the November 19, 1965,evening
edition reflecting that in November, 1961, when con-
cern mounted over radioactive fallout from nuclear
testing, a group of women in Washington, D. C. started
Women Strike for Peace. The idea spread rapidly through-
out the country and now embraces 900 groups, including
Women For Peace groups in the San Francisco Bay area.

These groups support programs to achieve goals stich as:
(i) Continued disarmament negotiations.
(2) A strong and flexible United Nations.

(3) Planning now at state and national levels for
conversion to peace-time economy and positive
efforts to ease world tensions.

The women act as individuals and as a group, with specific
actions suggested by individuals and groups from all over
the world. Decision to participate jointly on any given
suggestion is democratly arrived at by members of the Co-
ordinating Committee. Effective cooperation with other
peace groups is encouraged. Mont thly Coordinating Committee
meetings and general meetings, as wavvanted, are open to
all and anneunced in mailings to members. There are no
dues or membership forms nor conditions for membership.

To stir an awareness of the need for peace, ‘lomen For
Peace encourage public education in peace objectives at
local schools and sponsor peace-oriented demonstrations
and public meet S, Newspaper ads, billboards, and
eandicates for public office. On the national level
the up attempts to influence government officials

by letters and conferences.

Characterizations of Organizations

[ PHILADRIPHIA SOCIAL SCIENCE FORUM COMMITTEE

A source advised on November 14 and 17, 1958 that a meeting of the
District Education Commission, Commumist Party of Eastern Pennsylvania and
Delaware (CPEPD), was held November 13, 1958 at 3425 Powelton Avenue, Phila-
delphia. At this meeting, DANIEL RUBIN, the District Education Director,
presented a proposal for a series of forums under the nominal sponsorship of
. the Philadelphia Social Science Forum Committee (PSSFC). The source stated
that PSSFC was merely a paper organization and this series of forums was
: organized by the District Education Commission and had to be- approved by the
* District Committee (CPEPD) before being put into effect.

“This eource stated on dune 12, 1959, November 5, 1959, and October 21,
1960 that the PSSFC remained under the control of the District Education
Commission, CPEPD.

A second source reported on October 9, 1961, that the District Execu-
tive Committee (DEC), CPEPD, met on October 2, 1961, and approved plans to hold
and to support anew series of forums of PSSFG beginning November 10, 1961, and
ending in May, 1962.

The second source on May 8, 1964, advised that the main purpose of the
PSSFC is to bring to Philadelphia well known ‘speakers who -have a pro~Communist
point of view. Included among the speakers each year are national leaders of
the Communist Party, USA.

The second source added on May 15, 1967 that the PSSFC continued to
meet during 1962 through 1967 and that it remains under the control of the CPEPD.

Apartment Houses,.61. Peninsula Road, Belvedere, Calif., wrote
to Mrs. VIVIAN WILLIAMS by. letter dated October, 1967, which
was not delivered at Philadelphia until November, 1967,

while WILLIAMS was in. California regarding the court martial

of her son, RONALD LOCKMAN.

HALLINAN originally had wanted WILLIAMS to be at
the launching of the Brigade at a press conference to be held.
in Washington, D. C., on Veterans Day, 11/11/67, along with
mothers, sisters, and widows of men killed in Vietnam,
HALLINAN desired WILLIAMS to furnish her with the names of
mothers and wives of men killed in Vietnam who felt their
loved ones should not have been there at.all,

Since Mrs, WILLIAMS did not return until after
11/11/67, she did not know of the event, and therefore, did
Not participate, Additionally, she did not get around to
reading all her mail until much after she returned to
Philadelphia,

This was the reason the source did not learn of this
Brigade until December.

The ptesence of the United States forces in
the internal struggle of Vietnam is immoral and
illegal. There can be no possible Justification
for our interference in the domestic ait fairs of
this tiny distent land.

This 86-yesr—old women has stated thet she ©

estopped. Not all women ere free to join her, but
we can aseure her that thousands of women will
watch peacefully beside her. Some will picket,
cthets will go to jail until bail is atranged,
and othets will etay in jail with Hiss Renkin.
Every woman's patticipation is eoually valuable.
Ye ate confident each one will do the maximum of
which she ie capable.

On January 8th, women from all over the land ¥
will converge on Weshington to demand the end of :

Dear Friend: : :

We are sending this letter to you and otters from whom we have not heard much
recently, in the hope of re-enlisting your efforts in the Women for Peace

movement. It has been too long since we last heard directly from many of you,
and our meetings with those of you whom we have seen recently have been brief,

Of course, we know the paralyzing sense of frustration we all feel occasionally,
as we learn of the mounting horrors in Vietnam, But this feeling is only
temporary, and quickly gives way to activity. As women, we bear the major
responsibility for the preservation of life, and thus a major responsibility

in the peace movement,

mclosed you will find an announcement of the latest national women's effort
for peace. Several peace groups in Portland are cooperating in raising funds
to send representatives to Washington. We hope that you will also support this
effort, to insure representaticn from Portland Women for Peace. The coupon
on the enclosed notice is for your use in this effort.

In addition, we will have a supportive peaceful demonstration
in Portland at

We hope, if you cannot go to Washington, yourselz, that you will contribute to

In addition, please let us hear from you on your ideas of what more we might
do locally, We have some ideas too, which we hope to share with you, and on
which we shall need much help,

urgently needed.

Dear Friend:

We are sending this letter to you and others from whom we have not heard much
recently, in the hope of re~enlisting your efforts in the Women for Peace ,
movement, It has been too long since we last heard directly from many of you,
and our meetings with those of you whom we have seen recently have been brief,

Of course, we know the paralyzing sense of frustration we all feel occasionally,
as we learn of the mounting horrors in Victnam, But this feeling is only
temporary, and quickly gives way to activity. As women, we bear the major
responsibility for the preservation of life, and thus a major responsibility

in the peace movement,

Enclosed you will find an announcement of the latest national women's effort
for peace. Several peace groups in Portland are cooperating in raising funds
to send representatives to Washington, We hope that you will also support this
effort, to insure representaticn from Portland Women for Peace, The coupon
on the enclosed notice is for your use in this effort,

,
In addition, we will have a supportive peaceful demonstration
in Portland at

NOON, Monday, JANUARY 15th

Pioneer Post Office

5th and Morrison
We are asking participants to wear black, end to bring a black
(or dark colored) umbrella, We shall carry the umbrellas opened,
rain or shine, Placards (to wear) and leaflets (to distribute),
expressing support for the Jeannette Rankin Brigade, will be
available. We shall march around the Post Office block for one hour,
from noon to 1 p.m,, leafleting as we walk,

Wwe hope, if you cannot go to Washington,yourself, that you will contribute to
help someone else to go, and that you will also join with us at the Pioneer
Post Office at noon Monday, January 15th.

In addition, please let us hear from you on your ideas of what more we might
do locally, We have some ideas too, which we hope to share with you, and on
ywhich.we shall need much help.

Flease get in touch with one of us soon, Your help, ideas, and efforts are
urgently needed, :

Yours for Peace,

To’ all American Women: . a,
_¢ Dam proud-of the fact that my first vote cast in Congress was a vote against war.
It was the first opportunity for a woman to vote, because T was the ie woman
to be elected to Congress. a

I believed then, as I do today, that women aru the ones that must be concerned
with the needs ,and. development of the human race. I have always fought for the

: dignity of all human beings -- for those of the proset aswell as those -df future™
generations. .. - .

I will continue to struggle as long as I live. I hope al], women will” pond to

, the following.call and A Join 1 nein Washington on January 3), 1968, the opening day

Source three advised in July, 1955, that Mary Clarke
was dropped from Los Angeles County Communist Party

and not for any political differences with LACCP.

Source one further reported that Glory Roberts of
Pacoima, California, who is editor of the "Social Action
Communicator", a monthly publication located in Pacoima,
California, recording secretary of the Peace Action Council (PAC)
(See Appendix), and representative to the PAC from the Black
Congress and vice versa, was selected as Chairwoman of a JRB
committee to reach into the black community to get participants
from the Black ghetto involved in the demonstration in
Washington, D.C. on January 15, 1968. Source one advised that
in order to do this, all the organizations comprising the
JRB will have to pledge money to get the women to Washington, D.C.
and back to Los Angeles, California. :

Source one stated that three committees have been
established within the JRB. One of these committees has
been established to draw up a list of redress of grievances.
Each branch of the JRB throughout the nation will, when
gathered in Washington, D.C, as a main committee, decide
the major grievances and the redress of grievances will be
incorporated into a petition to be presented to Congress.
The second committee will be to involve the people in the
black community in the demonstration. The third committee is
to act as a coordinating committee.

and other women making the trip will pay all their own
expenses, No expenses are contemplated while the women are

in Washington, D.C, inasmuch as arrangements have been made
for the women to stay with other WSP members in the
Washington, D.C. area. Source one advised that it is
contemplated all the women will stay in Washington, D.C. until
Tuesday, January 16, 1967.

Source one advised it was reported the women from
across the nation would gather at the Union Depot, Washington, D.C.
at 11:30 A.M, on January 15, 1968. Source one further reported
it is hoped ten thousand women will participate in the
demonstration. After the gathering at Union Depot, the women
will march in solemn procession, all wearing black, to the
steps of the capitol building where the petition containing
the redress of grievances will be presented to the Congress.
Source one further advised it had been reported that Representative
Mc Cormick and Senator Mansfield had agreed to receive the
petition, Representative Mc Cormick, according to source one,
had agreed to accept fifteen women in his office at which time
he would receive the petition, but source one advised the
JRB now wants Representative Mc Cormick and Senator Mansfield
to accept the petition on the steps of the capitol building
in order that they might get news coverage. After the petition
has been presented, the JRB wants the redress of grievances
read into the Congressional Record.

Further activities of the JRB while in Washington, D.C.
are to includé a three hour "Women's Congress", possibly on the
grounds of Georgetown University.

Mary Clarke pointed out that although the original
intention had been to have only those women participate
in the JRB who were willing to risk arrest for civil disobedience,
she stated at the above meeting that no civil disobedience is
anticipated in view of the large number of organizations
participating who are opposed to such civil disobedience.
However, she further stated that individuals are not going to
be discouraged who might elect to create civil disobedience.

COMMUNIST INFILTRATION OF THE
FIRST UNITARIAN CHURCH OF LOS ANGELES

A source advised on May 22, 1967, that the
premises of the First Unitarian Church of Los Angeles, 2936
West 8th Street, Los Angeles, California, have been utilized
for meetings by Communist Party members and sympathizers over
a period of years. Speakers and lecturers at.the church
frequently espouse Communist causes or follow the Communist
Party line. Communist front group literature is distributed
at the church. The church is used by some Communist Party
members for “mass concentration" work. :

This same infiltration extends to adjuncts of
the church such as the Unitarian Public Forum and ‘the Fellow-
ship for Social Justice, formerly known as the Unitarian-
Universalist Fellowship for Social Justice.

STEPHEN H. FRITCHMAN has been minister of the
church since 1948,

Reverend STEPHEN H. FRITCHMAN is described in
the Fourth Report, Un-American Activities Committee in
California, 1948, vage 115, as a very active "Communist
fronter" and connected with numerous “Communist front organi-
zations and activities."

Membership in the First Unitarian Church does not,
of itself, connote membership in or sympathy with the Communist
Party.

2 source advised on May 14, 1967, that the Women
Strike for Peace (WSP) in the Southern California area began
its operations in the late “all of 1961, as an affiliate
of the national organization formed in Washington, D.C, It
is a peace oriented women's organization which is opposed
to the present American foreign policy in Vietnam. It has
also sought legislation which ‘ould bring about the abolition
of the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HCUA). In
recent mor:ths the organization has sponsored demonstrations
protesting the United States involvement in Vietnam and
ealling for the complete withdrawal ofall United States
troops from Vietnam. In the spring of 1966, it was instrumental
in originating and putting into effect a campaign advocating
support fcr "peace candidates" in the upcoming 1966 Congressional
elections.

The same source stated that WSP is a non-membership
organization and has no officers. The organization is open
to women of ail political opinions who are interested in world
peace,  t maxes no effort to exclude from its activities
menbers of, or persons sympathetic to, the Communist Party
ana related groups.

The guiding force behind the, Southern California
WSF groups is MARY CLARKE. A second source advised in July,
1955, that CLARKE was dropped from the Western Division, Los
Angeles County Communist Party (LACCP) in the Spring of 1955,
for personal reasons and not because of any political differences
with the LACUP. -

Rubin, CFUSA National Organizational Secretary, stated the Party -
believes | the DCA should have a bbpiioeats 38 class outlook and be a mass

Sec: etary andioeted. the DCA primary emphasis should be on

Women Strike for Peace

The "Berkeley Daily Gazette," a daily newspaper of —
general circulation published in Berkeley, California,
contained an article in the November 19, 1965,evening
edition reflecting that in November, 1961, when con-

cern mounted over radioactive fallout. from nuclear
testing, a group of women in Washington, D. C. started
Women Strike for Peace. The idea spread rapidly through-
out the country and now embraces 900 groups, including
Women For Peace groups in the San Francisco Bay area.

These groups support programs to achieve goals such as:
(1) Continued disarmament negotiations.

(2) A strong and flexible United Nations. -

(3) Planning now at state and national levels for

conversion to peace-time economy and positive
efforts to ease world tensions.

The women act as individuals and as a group, with specific
actions suggested by individuals and groups from all over
the world. Decision to participate jointly on any given
suggestion is democratly arrived at by members of the Co--
ordinating Committee. Effective cooperation with other
peace groups is encouraged. Monthly Coordinating Committee
meetings and general. meetings, as warranted, are open to
all and announced in mailings to members, There are no
dues or membership forms nor conditions for membership.

To stir an awareness of the need for peace, Women For
Peace encourage public education in peace objectives at
local schools and sponsor peace-oriented demonstrations
and public meetings, newspaper ads, billboards, and
candidates for public office. On the national level
the group attempts to influence government officials

by letters and conferences.

CHICAGO COUNCIL OF AMERICAN-SOVIET
ATLATIONS, Formerly known as Chicago
council of American-Soviet Friendship

EDWIN GORDON FOX, 7147 Jeffrey Avenue, Chicago,
Illinois,(now deceased) made available in January, 1954, the
"First Annual Report CCASF," an undated publication which
stated that the Chicago Council of American-Soviet Friendship
(CCASF) was incorporated in July, 1943. This document stated,
"The Council's affiliation with the National Council of
American-Soviet Friendship (NCASF) was validated August ll,
(1943). The present name was adopted to conform to standard
national practice. It should be noted, however, that the
Chicago Council is entirely autonomous; the government of its
affairs rests exclusively in the hands of its Chicago Executive
Board."

On April 8, 1965, a source furnished information to
the effect that as of March 11, 1965, this organization would
be known as the Chicago Council of American-Soviet Relations
(CCASR). MANDEL TERMAN continued to be listed as Chairman of
the new organization.

During April, 1965, a second source advised that
MANDEL TERMAN had arbitrarily disselved the Board of Directors,
assumed all financial and other functions of the organization,
and was maintaining existing records of the organization at
his residence, 660 West Irving Park Road, Chicago, Illinois.
The aims and purposes of this organization continued to be
to work for peaceful coexistence and friendship with the USSR.
While it claimed to be an autonomous organization, its program
followed the NCASF and it was in frequent contact with the
NCASF. :

On November 5, 1958, a third source advised that in
the early 1940s, MANDEL TERMAN was a member-at~large of the
Communist Party (CP) of Illinois. TERMAN was in Russia in
November, 1958, where he had gone to discuss the treatment of
Jews and to discuss Jewish culture in the USSR with the
leadership of the Soviet Union.



CHICAGO COUNCIL OF AMERICAN~
SOVIET RELATIONS

: In January, 1966, a fourth source advised that the
€CASR went out of existence in the ving of 1965 due to the
health condition of MANDEL A. Ti The offices of the
CCASR, formerly located at 32 ¥ ndolph Street, Chicago,
were for a short time carried at MANDEL TERMAN's home resi-
dence, 660 West Irving Park Road, Chicago. During the Fall

of 1965 due to the defunctness of the CCASR, the CP of Illinois
found it necessary to sponsor a rally honoring the 48th
anniversary of the Russian Revolution under a temporary
committee called “The Chicago Committee for American-Soviet
Friendship Rally.’ This rally was held cn November 7, 1965,
and once the rally was held this temporary committee went

out of existence.

The fourth source advised that as of the present
time the CCASR is defunct in the Chicage ar and any future
rally to be held on the American-Soviet friendship theme will
have to be organized by the CP of Illinois on a temporary
basis.

understanding that the National Lawyers Guild (NLG) was
formed around 1936 in New York City, and that the Chicago
Chapter of the NLG (CCNLG), which is affiliated with the
national group in-New York, was formed shortly thereafter,
possibly in 1937 by a group of liberal progréssive lawyers
in protest against activities of the American Bar Associxtion
Which they claimed was a non-liberal, non-progressive
organization. The CCNLG has no established headquarters kut

HELENA, MONTANA,

: -.., November 27, 1967

TO ALL AMERICAN WOMEN,

I am proud of the fact that my first vote cast in Congress
was a vote against war. It was the first opportunity for a

woman to vote because I was the first woman to be elected

to Congress.

I believed then as I do today that women are the ones who
must be concerned with the needs and development of the

human race, I have always fought for the dignity of all
human beings ~~ for those of the present as well as those

of future generations.
I will continue to struggle as long as I live.

T hope all women will respond to the following CALL, and
join me in Washington on January 8, 1968, the opening

day of Congress,

With highest hopes,

JEANNETTE RANKIN

i and the persistent neglect of human needs at home

TO COME TO WASHINGTON JANUARY 15. & 16 -

\. AMERICAN WOMEN constitute 51% of the voting population, yet a high percentage of us don’t vote. -
It is time for women to break out of their societal molds and take their place as effective, vocal citi-
zens. WOMEN CAN ELECT the President they want; Women can determine the political, social and
economic direction of the nation. WE HAVE WOMEN POWER. Let’s use it to demonstrate our
opposition to this war to the Congress of the United States.

We are a broad coalition of women from many areas of American life. We shall meet in Washington
on January [5 for the opening of Congress to demand the following:

1, CONGRESS, AS ITS FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS, RESOLVE TO END THE
WAR IN VIETNAM AND IMMEDIATELY ARRANGE FOR THE WITHDRAWAL
OF ALL AMERICAN TROOPS. .

. CONGRESS USE ITS POWER TO HEAL A SICK SOCIETY AT HOME.

3. CONGRESS USE ITS POWER TO MAKE REPARATION FOR THE RAVAGED
LAND WE LEAVE BEHIND IN VIETNAM.

4. CONGRESS LISTEN TO WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE SAYING AND
REFUSE THE INSATIABLE DEMANDS OF THE MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL
COMPLEX.

After we petition the United States Congress, we will hold our own congress to articulate our position
on the basic problem of achieving peace. We declare our intention to return to our communities and
mobilize women to dedicate ourselves to reshaping American society, and restoring our country toa
position of honor in the community of nations.

On January 15, we will meet at the Union Depot in Washington, D.C., at 11:30 A.M., and walk behind
our delegation which will present our petition to the U.S. Congress.

On January 16, many of us will stay in Washington to begin implementation of these demands by
presenting them to our Congressmen and Senators. We hope you can stay.

. when the United States Congress reconvenes in January 1968.

Source One advised that the Women Strike for Peace
WSP - see appendix) and the Women for Legislative Action
WLA - see appendix) are the two major organizations in
Southern California working for the success of the January 15,
1968, activities of the JRB both locally and in Washington,
D.C. Subcommittees of the JRB have been meeting in the
headquarters of WSP at 5899 West Pico Boulevard, and WLA at
5889 West Pico Boulevard, Los Angeles. During the most
recent of these subcommittee meetings, held during the first
week in January 1968, at the latter location, much of the _
discussion was related to proposed action in Southern California
by women who would be unable to travel to Washington, D. C.,
for the January 15th confrontation with Congress.

Minor changes in the previously announced schedule
of local activities for January 15, 1968, were agreed upon
at this meeting, as follows:

JEANNETTE RANKIN

HELENA, MONTANA,

November 27, 1967
TO ALL AMERICAN WOMEN,

I am proud of the fact that my first vote cast in Congress
was a vote against war. It was the first opportunity for a
woman to vote because I was the first woman to be elected
to Congress,

I believed then as I do today that women are the ones who
must be concerned with the needs and development of the
human race, I have always fought for the dignity of all
human beings -~ for those of the present as well as those
of future generations.

I will continue to struggle as long as I live.

I hope all women will respond to the following CALL,, and
join me in Washington on tonal 8, 1968, the opening
day of Congress,

With highest. hopes,

c

Pee

We have prepared a summary of aa scheduled

be held at the Capitol on January 15, 1968. A copy of this
memorandum is attached for ready reference,

It has been previously reported that the Jeannette x
\Rankin Brigade, a nationwide group of women opposed to the a
war in Vietnam, will sponsor a demonstration in Washington,D.C.;
on January 15, 1968, to petition Congress to end the war in
Vietnam.

Current plans of the Brigade call for the demon-
stration to assemble at Union Station, Washington, D. C.,
at 12:30 p.m. and march to the Capitol via Louisiana Avenue,
The Brigade has been unable to obtain a permit to assemble
at the Capitol as previously planned,

Their request to meet with Speaker of the House, 8
John W. McCormack and Senator Michael J, Mansfield on the

| Dear WSPER:

Nomen Strike for Peace nationally is suovorting the Jeannette Rankin Brigade.
[Pleneloads, trainloads and carloads of women will be coming into Washington on Mon-
day, January 15th, from all over the country.

Ye are particularly pleased with this action because it represents for the first

time a real coalition of women's peace groups, church groups, theatre personalities,
‘and community leaders. — .

i The Day is envisioned as a solemn, dignified confrontation of those who “should be
‘representing the ever growing opposition to the war. We ask that you write your our Con=
igressmen urging that they support the four points listed in the enclosed Call as Con-

gress reconvenes, Later in the afternoon at our Women's Congress we want to be able to \
report on Congressional responses, x

. - : q
We will all meet at Union Station in Washington at 11:30 AM and slowly walk to the

Sapitol. We ask the women to wear black, We will be led by Jeannette Rankin who will
oroceed to the top of the Capitol steps with a representative delegation of 50 women to
oresent our petition to the two men who represent the whole of Congress, Senator Mike
‘ansfield and Speaker of tne House McCormack. The delegation will read the demands be- .
fore the assembled women and the two Congressmen, Leaving the Hill, the women will enter
yuses for a motorcade to a Congress of American Women (place to be announced). . Women
rill present an analysis of the current crisis on the war front and the domestic front,

‘eading to suggestions for program and actions to be taken back oe our communities for in-
slementation,

Women may choose to remain in Ya shington the next day to meet with their Congressmen.
f you wish to stay and wish help in securing accommodations, contact the Hospitality Com
Attee, 2140 P. St. N.W . Washington, DC (293-2020). We regret that in order to get the

ovest train fare we had to guarantee return the ani day; therefore you would have to
inance your own trip back on the 16th,

Our hope is that 10, 000 women, will converge upon Washington,

and neglect of a society geared to profit and war...

women grieve for suffering people all over the world and will no longer
remain silent while the gap widens between the rich and the poor...

pursue our official committment to disarmament, and to respect
international law,

amehiorating the crisis in America,

We urge the Congress to heal a sick society at home, to make reparations
for the ravaged land we leave behind in Vietnam and to refuse to
listen to the insatiable demands of the military-industrial complex.

JANUARY 8, 1968

INFORMATION CONCERNING

The "Kansas City Star" newspaper, Kansas City,
Missouri, edition of January 14, 1968, contained an article
stating that Kansas City women were responding to a "woman
power" appeal issued by Miss Jeanette Rankin, former member
of Congress, to end the war in Vietnam. According to the
article, a small delegation of Kansas City women plan to go
to Washington, D. C., on January 15, 1968, to participate in
the march by the "Jeanette Rankin Brigade" to petition Congress
for a United States withdrawal from Vietnam. The others in
the group would remain in Kansas City and present copies of
the petition to the offices of U. S. Representatives Richard
Bolling, Kansas City, Missouri, and Larry Winn, Kansas City,
Kansas, at 1:00 p.m., on January 15, 1968.

The "Kansas City Star" evening edition of January
15, 1968, carried an article stating that on the afternoon
of January.15, 1968, 20 women appeared at the offices of
Representatives Boliing and Winn. They carried no signs
and the demonstration was orderly. The women, all from the
greater Kansas City area, merely presented a petition asking
Congress to end the war in Vietnam and withdraw American
troops, to make reparations for the "ravaged land we leave
behind in Vietnam", and to listen to the American people
and refuse "the insatiable demands of the military-industrial
complex". The article stated that the Kansas City branch of
the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom
had been planning to send representatives to the Washington
march, but it was not until Wednesday that they decided to
present the petitions to Congressmen Winn and Bolling.

According to the article, Mrs. John M./Swomley > IPey Puaee
Program Chairman of the organization,” stated the Kansas City _
group hoped to identify with the women in Washington and their

CONFIDENTIAL

DEMONSTRATION PROTESTING U.S.
POLICY IN VIETNAM

SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA
JANUARY 15, 1968

Chairman of the Brigade, announced to the demonstrators that this
docal demonstration was principally gathered to support women
from around the United States who were gathered in Washington,
D.C. today, as part of a nation-wide demonstration sponsored by
the Jeannette Rankin Brigade, to petition Congress to resolve
the conflict in Vietnam. Bridges stated that inasmuch as it

was not possible for the demonstrators to personally contact
their congressmen, most of whom were out of town; that following
the presentation of a petition to Mayor Joseph Alioto, the
demonstrators would then proceed to the Western Union Office on
10th and Market Streets in San Francisco, so that the women
protestors could send wires to their congressmen, protesting
United States policies in Vietnam. Bridges indicated that the
petitioners would request Mayor Alioto to convey to Congress
their petition, which among other things urged Congress, as its
first order of business, to resolve to end the War in Vietnam and
immediately arrange for withdrawal of all American troops from
Vietnam; for Congress to use its power to heal the sick society
at home and to make reparations for the ravaged lands left
behind in Vietnam.

A source advised March 2, 1967, that Mrs. H.
Bridges, also known as Nikki Bridges, 35
Kronquest Court, San Francisco, California, was
listed as a recipient of a new yearly subscription
to the "People’s World" (PW), expiration date
March 4, 1968.

The PW is a west coast communist newspaper,
published weekly in San Francisco.

The next speaker was identified as. ‘AileenHernandez.
She spoke for approximately five minutes and briefiy~ explained
to the demonstrators who Jeannette Rankin is and what the purposes
of the Jeannette Rankin Brigade are. She stated that the group
has no principal spokesman and it is principally a group of
women who are involved and committed in a fight for peace.

Several of the demonstrators, led by Nikki Bridges,
then proceeded to the Office of Mayor Joseph Alioto to present
their petition.

DEMONSTRATION PROTESTING U. S.
POLICY IN VIETNAM

SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA
JANUARY 15, 1968

Approximately ten minutes later the Mayor of
San Francisco appeared on the steps of the City Hall and announced
to the demonstrators that he would gladly transmit their
petition to Congress. .Mayor Alioto stated that he fully
believed in the constitutional right of peaceful assembly.
He indicated, however, that because he had consented to
transmit the demonstrators' petition to Washington, he did not
necessarily agree with it. The Mayor then stated that it
was his personal opinion that the United States Government and
the Johnson Administration had done all in its power to attempt
to come to a peaceful and honorable solution in the Vietnamese
War. He related that he felt that it was now up to the other
side to make the same attempts to arrive at a peaceful solution
in the Vietnamese conflict.

At epproximately 12:45 p.m., the demonstrators proceeded”
to the Western Union Office located at 10th and Market Streets
in San Francisco, so that wires could be sent to their congressmen
in Washington.

A Special Agent of the FBI observed one Flaine weed
Yoneda participating in the above demonstration and folléwing -~
‘the demonstration Yoneda was observed to return to her employment
at the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union
(ILWU) - Pacific Maritime Association, Pension Fund, at 150

Golden Gate Avenue,’ San Francisco.

A second source advised on December 4, 1967, that
Elaine Yoneda is a current and active member of the Communist
Party, (CP).

On January 15, 1968, a Special Agent of the FBI
observed a silent protest by a group of women on the lawn
of Colton Hall, Monterey, California, between 3:00 and 5:00 p.m.
These women were ostensibly gathered to support the demonstration
being held in Washington, D.C., sponsored by the Jeannette Rankin
Brigade. There were no speeches givens the demonstrators merely
conducted a silent vigil.

A one page leaflet captioned "Women To Take First
Step to End The War“ printed by the Jeannette Rankin Brigade,
at 150 Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco, California, was handed
out at the above demonstration. A Xeroxed duplication of this
leaflet is appended to this memorandum.

The January 16, 1968, issue of
the "Miami Herald," a local Miami, Florida
newspaper, contained an article entitled
"Five Thousand Women Join Viet War Protest."
.. The article identified Jeannett,
as an 87 year old woman pacifist
former member of Congress who voted in
Congress against the American entry into
both world wars.

gation (FBI) on January 15, 1968, observed an anti-war

A source advised on May 9, 1967, that it was his
understanding that the National Lawyers Guild (NLG) was
formed around 1936 in New York City, and that the Chicags
Chapter of the NLG (CCNLG), which is affiliated with the
national group in New York, was formed shortly thereaiter,
possibly in 1937 by a group of liberal progressive lawyers
in protest against activities of the American Bar Association
which they claimed was a non-liberal, non~-progressive
organization. The CCNLG has no established headquarters tut
occasionally uses the return address of its officials in
literature.

Reference is made to prior memoranda captioned as

January 11, 1968, from Los Angeles, California.

Sop mer AP rom le feats ; :

Southern California, yas held on January 11, 1968, in the
offices of the Women/Strixe for Peace (WSP) (see appendix),

that city on January 15, 1968. Clarke indicated that she and
Mrs, Hallinan had already received numerous queries from

representatives of the Washington news media regarding proposed

action to be taken by the JRB. She also noted that it might

be necessary to re-route the proposed JRB march on the Capitol,

in view of some "1882 Law" rélating to demonstrations in the -
vicinity of the Capitol building.

According to Source One the women from Southern

On January 15, 1968, Special Agents of the Los Angeles
Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation observed a :
group of women assemble in front of the Old State Building, 217
West First Street (First and Broadway, in the downtown Civic
Center), Los Angeles, Califormia, at approximately 9:30 AM.
The women were carrying placards indicating they were the
local representation of the JRB. They also had two leaflets
for distribution (Xerox copies of which are appended to this
— memorandum) which cailed for women to participate and which

* to hold a rally on the south steps of the 01d State Building,
with the speakers utilizing bapen cetera amplification system,

which was’ held by actress Lesl arrish. /¢ |

Source One indicated that Parrish had originally been’
scheduled to fly to Washington, D. C., to participate in the
JRB action at the Capitol, but changed her plans at ‘the last
minute in order to remain in Los Angeles.

At 10:50 AM, the women marched to the steps on the
First Street side of the Los Anxeles City Hall for a second
rally. A count made as the demonstrators marched between the
Old State Building and the City Hall revealed that 250
adult Caucasians (majority of whom were women dressed in
black), and eight non-Caucasian adults were involved, plus
some youngsters and infants, The mother of one of the children
had a cardboard sign, depicting a bomb and the caption, "I'm
Glad I'm Not Vietnamese", strapped to the back of her son who
appeared to be less than four years of age.

With Verontea, Stefons again acting as mistress of y ff
ceremonies; thé rally“vas addressed #wictte Sherman,

by ©
Margaret Wright, Tima Tomash, and Silaschary The latter’ -- ~
was introduced as a radio commentator employed by Los Angeles
Radio Station KLAC. She joined the others in calling for a
coalition of women to influence legislation and bring an end to
the war in Vietnam. She also called for support of other "liberal
radio broadcasters on our side", one of whom she named as

William Winter. (The"Daily People's World", west coast

communist newspaver, in its edition of Jume 11, 1946, described
William Winter as chairman of a local citizens! committee to
safeguard the Joint Anti-Fascist Refuge Committee, which
organization has been cited pursuant to Executive Order 10450).

Erlotké Shennan was introduced as the wife of

- Laurence “Shevaan, it being pointed out that he was an

unsuccessful candidate for public office, on a peace slate,
during 1967, but that both he and his wife were continuing the
fight for an end to the wer in Vietnam, She said, "It is time
for us to re-examine our role.as women. Women are a vehicle
for giving life. We will not be a venicle for perpetuation

of wars", She then read some anti-war quotes from Henry David
Thoreau, “indicating they were as timely today, as when he wrote
then.

Margaret Wright stated that wheress the majority of
women in the demonstration were wearing black to denote mourning,
that she and her non-Caucasian associates who feel, "Black is
beautiful" were dressed in white to indicate their attitude of
mourning. She called for the elimination of ROTC (Reserve
Officers Training Corps) from local high schools and junior
colleges, adding, "Ihey have got to get live bullets out of the
schools, and get some live teachers in." She repeated these
same statements during the afternoon when the JRB moved to
the Los Angeles City Board of Education.

As the rally was breaking up, Wright grabbed the :

public address system and said that it nad been learned that
the City Council was in session inside the City Hall Building



.they had not made previous arrangements for a place on the

. American flag, because I really don't have liberty and- justices

hw 68262 Docld:32989544 Page 383

She urged the women not to.disperse, but to join her and...
others in invading the City Council Chambers with a demand
that the JRB be allowed to speak to the Council even though

agenda that day. Some of the women were already out of range
of the public address system and did not hear this announcement
by Wright, having already been dismissed by, Sissons and told to
reconvene at the Board of Education following luncheon,

Approximately 200 of the demonstrators did enter
the Council Chambers. They got word to the councilmen, through-
one of the staff members, -that they wisned to be heard.
A motion to allow a JRB representative to address them was
put before the Council, and defeated by a vote of six to five.
Immediately following this vote, there was a unanimous vote
that the Council adjourn, As the councilmen filed out of the
room, Tima Tomash rushed to-the front shouting demands that
they return, while other of the women hissed and booed the
city legislators.

During the noon hour some of the women distributed -
leaflets in the City Hall and on the surrounding streets: in
the downtown Civic Center. _

At 1:00 PM, the worfen, whose numbers had by that

time been reduced to 125, massed in the patio of the. Los see
Angeles City Board of Education, 450 North Grand Avenue,

Los Angeles... Sissons, Wright and Tomash addressed-the ~--- ---
assembled demonstrators, pointing out that money spent in
Vietnam could be better spent in education. Wright claimed
that many of the so-called student "drop-outs" are in reality .
"push-outs" ng that she herself was one of the latter. .
She said, books, not bombs. We know this is a racist
war and we blacks are not going to fight a racist war"; She.
-indicated that rather than fight overseas, the black people
would remain at home and fight the racists. She also said,
"Just because I'm pro-black doesn't necessarily mean I'm anti-
white. : :

Wright said, "I'm not political, but I am honest. I
can't honestly get up and say the pledge of allegiance to the

so I just get up and stand and won't repeat the pledge.
Later, when she observed a photograph of President Johnson
hanging froma wall in the Administration Building at the
Los Angeles City Board of Education, she told the JRB women
with her, , "We uaa aioe have to look at such pornographic
pictures. —

- yp



Wright said that her arrest at the hands of Los
Angeles City School Security Officers, during the recent.
Manual Arts High School disturbance, had at least one bright
? result. She said that at the time of her arrest it had been
necessary for the arresting officers to drag her down the
hall as she wes too heavy for them to carry. Then she added
that the next time she is arrested the officers will not have
that excuse as she has lost thirty pounds in the meantime.

The speeches in the patio ended at 1:30 PM and many
of the women left immediately... Seventy-eight women remained -.
and attempted to enter a spécial committee meeting being attended
by some of the School Board members. They were informed by a
member of -the administrative staff-that the public meeting of the
School Board would not be held until 4:00 PM, the regularly
scheduled meeting time.. The women milled around in the nallway
outside the meeting room, until finally a staff member came out
and told them that two members’of the School Board, Reverend
James E. Jones and Dr, Julian. Nava, had agreed to grant them an
audience. The women were then ushered into the public board
room of the School Board where they waited until 2:00 PM at
which time the above-named Board members granted the demonstrators
a short audience and answered some questions put to them by the
women. One question, as to how much longer the members of the
School Board were going to*permit recruiters from the armed -
forces to interview students at local-high schools and junior-
colleges remained unanswered, but Dr, Nava pointed out to the
women that he had seen nothing wrong in entering the armed
forces to fight for this country himself when he was 17 years
of age; and he could see nothing wrong in other young men who
wanted to do the same today. The demonstration was cancluded
by 3:00 PM. There were no incidents and no arrests. '* 7

Placards carried during this demonstration in Los
Angeles bore the following captions:

-"Rat Texas Beef, Not L.B.J. Baloney”
"yoman Power is Vote Power is Peace Power"
“Draft Beer Not Students"
"Where Have All the Men: Gone-To Graveyards"

"Jeannette Rankin Brigade-Vomen's Votes Count, End

SOUTHERN CONFERENCE EDUCATIONAL FUND, UNC. (SCEF)

The Southern Conference for Human Welfare (SCHW)
was cited as a Communist front by the House Committee on
Un-American Activities, House Report 592, June 12, 1947.
In the same house report, 'The Southern Patriot" was cited
@s an "organ" of the SCHW.

An amendment to the charter of the SCHW dated
April 26, 1946, changed 1ts name to the Southern Conference
Educational Fund, Incorporated (SCEF) and stated its purpose
to be to improve the educational and cultural standards of
the Southern people in accordance with the highest
Awerican democratic institutions, traditions and ideals.

The masthead of the April, 1967, issue of
"The Southern Patriot" indicates that it is the publication
of SCEF, editorial and business offices of which are
located at 3210 West Breadway, Louisville, Kentucky,
Eastern office of whieh is located at Suite 412, 799
Broadway, New York City. New York. "The Southern Patriot"
is published once each month, except July. SCEF is stated
to be dedicated to ending discrimination based on race,
creed, color, sex, national origin or economic condition.

Carl Braden is identified as Executive Director
oi SCEF and Anne Braden as editor of “The Southern Patriot."

Mrs. Alberta Ahearn, 2311 Payne Street, Louisville,
Kentucky, a self-admitted former member of the Communist
Party (CP), Louisville, Kentucky, testified om December 11,
and 13, 1954, in Jefferson County, Kentucky Criminal Court
in a State sedition proseculion égainst Carl dames Braden.
| She identified Carl Braden and his wife, Amne McCarty Braden,
as having been known to her as members of the CP from
January, 1951 to December, 1954. 7

The SCEF is self-described as having deep roots
in the South where it began as the educational wing of the
SCHW, organized in 1938 to work for economic and political
reform. When the SCAHW disbanded in the late 1940's, SCEF

continued as an independent organization, rallying support
for integration and democracy and helping to stimulate

and nurture new movements of the early 1960's. The SCEF
maintained headquarters in Louisiana for twenty years, but
in 1966 moved its headquarters to Louisville, Kentucky.

A source advised on March 2, 1961, that Claude
Lightfoot, a Communist Party functionary, stated at a meeting
of the Communist Party in Baltimore, Maryland, on February 25,
1961, that the Communist Party is not connected with any
progressive movement but indirectly they do have some influence
in the SCEF.

A second source, who is familiar with some phases
of Communist Party activity in the New Orleans area, advised
on June 3, 1966, that during the time that the SCHW was in
existence, members of the Communist Party were members of”
and worked actively in the SCHW; however, since the formation 7
of the SCEF, Communist Party members have not been encouraged
to work in the SCEF. The source stated that the SCEF is
a progressive, liberal organization, which he considers a
Communist Party front organization because it has gone along
with the Communist Party on certain issues, particularly
on the racial issue.

A third source advised on May 25, 1965, that
George Meyers, a Communist Party functionary, expressed
great admiration for Carl and Anne Braden and the SCEF,
with which they are affiliated, and expressed the view
that the SCEF is the best organization in the South as far
as doing effective work is concerned and that they have a
better idea of what they are doing, where they are heading,
and influence other organizations for the better.

The second source also advised on June 3, 1966,

that many people who are officials and supporters of the
SCEF, while liberal in their views, are by no means Communists.

FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE

The April 6, 1960, edition of "The New York Times” -
newspaper contained a full-page advertisement captioned
“What Is Really Happening In Cuba," placed by the Fair Play
for Cuba Committee (FPCC). This advertisement announced the
formation of the FPCC in New York City and declared the FPCC
intended to promulgate "the truth about revolutionary Cuba" to
neutralize the distorted American press,

“The New York Times" edition of January 11, 1961,
reported that at a hearing conducted before the United States
Senate Internal Security Subcommittee on January 10, 1961,

Dr. Charles A. Santos-Buch identified himself and Robert Taber
as organizers of the FPCC. He also testified he and Taber
ebtained funds from the Cuban Government which were applied
toward the cost of the aforementioned advertisement.

On May 16, 1963, a source advised that during the
first two years of the FPCC's existence there was a struggle
between Communist Party (CP) and Socialist Workers Party(SWP)
elements to exert their power within the FPCC and thereby
influence FPCC policy. This source added that during the past
year there had been a successful effort by FPCC leadership to
minimize the role of these and other organizations in the FPCC
so that their influence as of May, 1963, was negligible.

The SWP has been designated pursuant to Executive
Order 10450. oo

On May 20, 1963, a second source ised that Vincent
"Ted" Tee, FPCC National Office Director, *. tien formulating
FPCC policy and had indicated that he had no intention of
permitting FPCC policy to be determined by any other organization,
This sonrce stated that Lee believed that the ¥P :
advocate resumption of diplomatic relations Letween Cuba and
the United States and should support the right of
Cubans to manage their revolution without i
other nations. Lee <2id not advocate suppor
revolution per se,

the Cuban

The November 23, 1963, edition of "The New York Times"
reported that Senge Thomas J. Dodd of Connecticut had called
FPCC "the chief puplic relations instrument of the Castro network
in the United States." It is to be noted that Senator Dodd was
a member of the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee which
twice conducted hearings on the FPCC.

7 The December 27, 1963, edition of "The New York World
,egram and Sun" newspaper stated that the pro-Castro FPCC
-was seeking to go out of business and that its prime activity
during its lifetime had been sponsorship of pro-Castro street
rallies and mas§ picket lines, and the direction of an active
propaganda mill highlighting illegal travel-to-Cuba campaigns.
Its comparatively brief span of,life was attributed to mounting
anti-Castro American public opinion, the 1962 Congressional
hearings which disclosed FPCC financing by Castro's United
Natiors Delegation, and ultimately, the bad publicity which
the FPCC received from disclosure of activities on its behalf
by suspected presidential assassin Lee H. Oswald,

On February 6, 1964, the previously mentioned second
source advised that V. T, Lee had recently remarked that the
FPCC was dead and that there were no plans to organize another
Similiar organization,

On April 13, 1964, a third source advised that there
had not been any FPCC activity in many months and that the
FPCC had been dissolved.

With regard to Women Strike for Peace

Ogxober 20, 1962, quoted.Dr. FRANCES
FRRING, national leader of WSP, as lee

that Mrs. DONNA ALLEN, a national leader

of WSP; Mrs- DAGMAR WILSON, founder and

leader of WSP; and RUSS NIXON, General Manager
of the "National Guardian" (see appendix) were
"found gailty of contempt in the U.S. District

had expressed 4 willingness to testify at an
open hearing where their views would not be
subject to possible distortion by HUAC, as

has happened at other closed HUAC hearings)."

tration provisions of the Internal Security
Act of 1956 and the membership provisions of
the Smith Act; favor social and cultural

Among those present were MARY CLARKE, Los Angeles, California;

California. Several California women were there to hear /
instructions for Monday. Rumors were rampant. One person
said police would plant two hundred “agent provocateurs" in
the line of march to create scenes which would result in

i arrests. It was aiso stated police had prepared for five
hundred arrests; that all telephones into the demonstration

j headquarters were being monitored; and that permission to

i march was still being withheld. After the California group

i had been briefed, the following instructions were read to

the Washington delegates by MALVINA REYNOLDS of California:

1

(1) Maintain silence throughout the march.

(2) Maintain strict discipline; walk to the right
on the sidewalk.

: (3) Follow the instructions of monitors in blue
armbands who will be under orders from white arm-banded marshals.

RE: DEMONSTRATION PROTESTING UNITED St & PGLICY
IN VIETNAM; WASHINCTOX, D2 0., JANUARY 15, 1968

“| TAIMI HALONEN and THORUN ROBEL were mildly self-
eritical about not working for the programs the younger women
were promoting. TAIMI said she was tired after working long
hours on the Seattle conference to be held Saturday, January
20th at Mt. Zion Baptist Church in Seattle at which the

Seattle delegation would report. HALONEN made the observation,
however, that the women working on the program were all very
experienced leaders and she trusted they would formulate a
satisfactory program.

On Monday, January 15, 1968, the delegates including
the group from Washington State, met at the Union Station in
Washington, DC. It was learned here that the instructions
which had been given the day before at the Shoreham Hotel were
evidently for the California group only, because many California
pecple had been badly beaten in previous demonstrations and
they were very cautious and somewhat apprehensive. The
official pattern was different. Mimeographed sheets headed
“Jearrette Rankin Brigade - Information and Instructions" were
passed out and these appeared to be the official instructions.
A reproduction is attached.

-
o ~ The Washington State delegation was enlarged when a

Mrs. CKUP from Tacoma arrived. RADER said some of the money
usually received from wealthy Bees ahead had been collected

by Mrs. BACKUP. Reverend HAROLD-BASS of Tacoma collected . --~-
$179.00, and wanted comeone e1se tc go instead of ZEFRA
(STUDAMIRE). RADER defended herself when TAIMI HALONEN criticized
her for bringing ZEFRA along since ZEFRA is at least six months
pregnant.

After the demonstration, HEALY and RADER spent much
A of the time urging the speakers to include in their talks some-
Fi thing about the status of the American Indian. ELLA BAKER from
BEE . New York did inciude a paragraph trom the ‘:paper the Washington
a State delegation submitted to Congress. This was entitled,  ..
d "American indians and the Struggle for Peace", It had been
j prepared by LONNIE HEALY aithough at its bottom it carried the
notation "(Prepared by the Jeannette Rankin Brigade Delegation
from Washington State)."

RADER, HEALY, and CORR became indignant because the
audience did not give a standing ovation to Mrs. MARTIN L. KING,
Jr. or any of the Negro speakers.

CONPIDENTT At

HEALY espressed great dissatisfaction with the
basic organization ci the gathering. She wanted an ongani-
zational meeting instead of a raily type meeting which
occurred. HALONEN and ROBEL agreed somewhat. HEALY implied
the whcle thing was a waste of her time.

In the workshop section of the meeting, HALONEN
worked in the legislative action section; HELEN FRENCH and
ELAINE HORSLEY in the electoral campaigns; and HEALY and
CORR in racism. Here, too, the younger women were very
eritical. HEALY, particularly, resented having men as
"resource people" for the group. She said she thought this
was a women's congress. TAIMI said she found herself in a
situation that was quite different in that she was working
with a very broad spectrum of politically and economically oriented
individuals and it was a real learning experience.. ELAINE
HORSLEY was anxious to get back home and work for peace while
the spirit of JEANNETTE RANKIN was still fresh. She and
HELEN FRENCH expressed the view the congress met the needs
of American women in giving a conerete program on which to work.

Tuesday, January 16, 1968, was for lobbying. The
Seattle and Tacoma people were told to meet at the Methodist
Building, 100 Maryland Avenue. HALONEN, ROBEL, HEALY, HORSLEY,
and HELEN FRENCH arrived before the appointed time. After about
an hour, EMELIA CASSIDY arrived stating RADER had an eye problem
and would be unable to attend. Mrs. BACKUP joined the group.
LINDA CORR and ZEFRA were too tired to get up so early. The
group called on Washington State's Senators JACKSON and MAGNUSON,
but they were not in their offices. After leaving a copy of
the women's petition and a questionnaire prepared by the
Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (see attachment)
they called on Washington State's Congressmen FLOYD HICKS and
BROCK ADAMS. Mr, HICKS was out or town. Mrs. HOKSLEY knew, the
Congressman personally and her son knew’ two of the office “‘
personnel. She asked that they relate to him that she was
vitally interested in peace and social justice.

Congressman BROCK ADAMS was in his office and spent
about twenty minutes talking with the group concerning his
polatical views and some of the political machinations of his
party. The group then began to disintegrate. ELAINE HORSLEY
left to get a 2:30 flight to Boston where she would visit her
son who is attending Harvard University.

After some sightseeing in the afternoon, HALONEN,
ROBEL, and Mrs. BACKUP checked into the Plaza Hotel since
they were going to stey a day or two longer for some workshops.
RADER stayed also. The rest of the group, HEALY, CORR, ZEFRA
(STUDAMIRE), CASSIDY, and FRENCH went to Friendship Airport
and boarded UAL Flight 41 for Seattle.

While in Washington, HEALY kept trying to call a
CARL BLOICE who the source thought used to be either in Seattle
or San Francisco, but she never reached him.

The workshops held on January 15th after the march were:
(1) Legislative Action

(2) Electoral Campaign

(3) Press

(4) New Women in New World

(5) War at Home

(6) Resistance
(a) Action
(b) Draft
(c) Direct Action

of the Trade Union CP Club was held at Tacoma, Washington, on
January 18, 1968, at which EMELIA CASSIDY, also known as MILLIE
CASSIDY, a member of that club, reported on her trip to Washington,
D.C. She stated she stayed at DONNA ALLEN's home there. She said
MARJORIE RADER got an eye infection which kept her from going to
the march. RADER remained at ALLEN's residence. She added
ZEFRA STUDAMIRE shouldn't have gone because she was uncooperative
and would not attend anything. She was rude, said her bed was
too low and complained about the food. Some or all of these

troubles might be attributed to the fact STUDAMIRE is expecting
a baby in April. CasicllY stated there were tco many rules to
follow.

The delegates weren't premittec to carry a nail file,
wear peace buttons, or exhibit RANKIN buttons. They had to walk
six abreast and were not allowed to march around the White
House. She said a suit will be brought in court for this
denial of their rights. She went on to state each person had
or was given $10.00 to carry on his person so he could not
be arrested for vagrancy.

CASSIDY said a nurse, Mrs. HELEN Mc(COCK, had been
very helpful to the’ group. COOK told CASSIDY she could be reached
at 719 Beechwood Road, Media, Pennsylvania, if more information
is desired concerning Veterans for Peace, which was not further
described.

GUY RADER, a CP member at this meeting, tried to stop
CASSIDY when the latter complained ZEFRA STUDAMIRE was too
immature to have been sent to the conference, but CASSIDY wasn't
easy to stop. She was incensed over the fact money had been used
for STUDAMIRE's trip and the latter refused to cooperate. RADER
and STUDAMIRE remained in Washington, D.C. after the conference
to handle some business with the Student Non-Violent Coordinating 4
Committee (SNCC) according to CASSIDY.

THE STRUGGLE FC ry

Today, in Rattle Creet:, Michigan, the city's scal, adopted in 1551,
“4 vacist and violence because it pictures a white man hitting oa «na a

awith a rif’e butt. Some Indis 2 television prograo
vuster" as indicacive of racist America. The National Congress of American
Tadians opposes sais distortion of history. Beatings and murder of Indians
in Haine go unchallenged. Congress voted in 195 to open up Indian land
¥eservations to state jurisdiction, In actuality, this rides established
tribal courts and federal jurisdiction. It gives local bigoted authorities
wore opportunity to harrass and open the way to termination of our treaties
and in several places resulted in actual loss of land.

It is as deadly to be an Indian in America as it is to be a soldier
in Viet Nam. In the three years before 1$u7, more Indian children below the
age of 18 had died in this country than the 6,623 U. S. combat casualties of
tle entize Viet Nam War (as of the end of 1966). Most of these were children
below the age of six.

The price we pay is the built-in racism our children are taught in
school, over television, in-cartoons; the Indian has become a joke, to white
Americans. We pay because we don't know our own history.

The thread of struggle for self-determination runs through the history
of Indian-Americans. When a few Indian youth speak of Red Power, the roots go
deep into their history in finding nourishment for this demand, Just as some
Negro leaders today speak of W.E.B, DuBois as having raised the same issue cf
identity long before the level of struggle, which is Black Power, arrived.
This struggle has gone on for 400 years.

The Indian people have been sending spokesmen to bring their grievances

“and their positions before the power structure of this country for two hundred

years. They have fought in the courts since at least 1330 when the case of
the Cherokee Nation vs. Georgia tested the ability and the willingness of the
United States to protect an Indian Tribe in its efforts at self-determination.

The Vietnamese war is a continuation of the whole racist war we have
waged ayainst the Indian People. Understanding this is a part of understanding
the Viet Nam war. We respond to what is happening to Vietnamese children, yet
the Indian people have suffered from the same policy of extermination and
destruction of their identity,

We must unite with the strivings of those who have had to deal with
United States' genocide for 200 years!

We can help to push the United States to ratify the United Nations
Resolution, "Treaty Against Genocide”, that the United States should correct
the history and policy of genicide against the Indian people. Today this
refers to the destruction of their identity as'a people and linke with the
struggles of people for their identity all over the world. To stop the policy
of genocide, of racism, to develop compensatory steps to undo the effects of
the crimes against the Indian people, to Temove the oppression of the Indian
people! res aa =o eects LR te SEETESsEnEEOEn

All the forces in this country cannot win democratic power without
waking this correction of what was done to the American Indian people.

aern Welfare programs in the United 3%ates i. With passage of

Socinl Security Actr-~in 1955, sutnorizing federal grants to

ates for public assistance and child welfare programs, Tn 1°37,

the Washington Legislature repealed the Poupers Law of 165% and

enacted a State Social Security Law. "Welfare" has been a, bone of
5

contention ever since.
Greenleigh Report wore :

In 1963, the Washington Legislature appropriated $20,000 for a study
of the state's public assistance programs. The study was made by
Greenleigh Associates, and the Greenleigh Report was presented in
December, 1964, ~

This report stated that public assistance grants in

Washington, with standar s based on 1959 prices and

12% ratable reductions,t." ‘e 40% below the minimun

Standards for health and decency, Speaking of child ’

welfare needs, the report said:"There is an excessive

and increasing rate of referral of children to the

Juvenile Courts, both for dependency and delinquency.

There is an excessive and increasing trend for children

to be removed from their natural families and cared

for elsewhere,"

WHAT ABOUT RATABLE REDUCTIONS?.

o

The 1965 Legislature removed the ratable reductions. The 1967
Legislature ordered the Dept, of Public Assistance to bring itts
pricing standard's up to 1967 levels.

New standards were put into effect July first. Increased allowances
for rent vary from county to county. ther allowances were increase
an average of 10-3/4%.In King County the total increase was 16%.
Thus, King County grants have been increased by 28% since 1964,
put the cost of living has increased by at least 5%. Grants are still
17% less than acceptable levels. .
The maximum grant for a Seattle family consisting of
two adults, a boy 13, and a girl 8, is $285.80 4
month--$3,429 a year, But recent changes in the
Federal Social Security Law cast a shadow on even
this figure. The local welfare officials will not
offer any guess as to what miy happen next. NEW RATABLE
REDUCTIONS ARE ALWAYS A POSSIBILITY,

There 1s much talk of getting people off welfare by putting them to
work. Yet who will take care of the children? Child care costs from

$60 to $80 per child per month in Seattle, g
Some examples of women's wages:
Nurses Aid = $1.40 per hour =~ $2912.00 “per year

House Cleaners ~ $1.65 per Hr Dept. Store Clerk ~ $1.762 per hr
hotel maids 1.69 " 4m :

A source reported on May 17, 1962, a meeting of the
Ballard-Greenwood CP Club was held in Seattle, April 25, 1962,
at which TAIMT HALCNEN was nominated to be the new Chairman of
this Club. Along with other business of the evening, HALONEN
said she expected to devote a good portion of her time to SWAP,
an organization of peace forces that met recently with seven
members. She said four of the seven were from the "left" but
did not go into detail. She said the group had problems of an
organizational nature because it was new, and she thought she
could help.

On April 5, 1963, a second source stated a meeting of
the University CP Club was held at Seattle on April 2, 1963.
KEN ROSE, a member of the Club, reported the most influential
peace organization in Seattle was SWAP.

On July 31, 1964, a meeting of the North Central CP
Section Committee was held at Seattle. WILL PARRY, Section
Chairman, said attention should be placed on three political
questions - peace, civil rights, and labor. Under peace, he
said CP clubs should inject the Women Act for Peace campaign
into the election campaign. At another Section meeting,
February 5, 1966, TAIMI HALONEN was praised for effective
peace work and for her help in developing unity among the peace
forces. Section-wide concentration was urged in assisting
SWAP to visit 1,000 workers on the Vietnam issue.

A third source advised on February 24, 1966, a
Northwest District CP Committee meeting was held at Seattle
February 12, 1966. After lunch, the entire group participated
in passing out leaflets pertaining to racial matters and the
Vietnam war which carried the name of SWAP, 5411 Ravenna Avenue
Northeast, Seattle, Washington 98105, which address has been
used consistently by SWAP and is that of ANCI KOPPEL, also known
as Mrs. CHARLES KOPPEL, KOPPEL has been and continues to be
the coordinator and apparent prime motivating force of SWAP
as of May, 1967.

A fourth source reported in 1945
ANCI KOPPEL was a member of the
Professional Group of the Communist
Political Association (CPA), also
known as the Rogers CP Club at
Seattle, Washington.

The CPA has been designated by the
Attorney General of the United States

: On Februa~y 23, 1960, orted the Communist
Party (CP), Northwest trict 0%: e, at a meeting in”
January, 1960, decided to prepare for opening a cooperative -
bookstore and directed the CP State Board to set up a Party
committee for this purpose. :

The above source also reported that at a state-wide
CP conference held on august 27, 1950, CP District Chairman
BURT NELSON reported or the WCC. NELSON announced the committee
was determined to have the bookstore opened by the earliest
possible date, probably October 15, (2960). He urged support
of the WCC. : ‘ -

: A second source in February and March, 1960, .advised
a committee of CP members during those months commenced organi-
zation of the WCC with authorized capital of $2,000 which was-
to sell shares and make other plans for operation of a bookstore
selling "progressive" literature at Seattie. In May and June,
1960, this source reported BURT NEISON, on May 18, 1960, stated
the CP District Literature Commission would concern itself with
the bookstore and other types of literature to be sold. On
May 31, 1960, BURT NELSON suggested October 1, 1960, as the
tentative opening date of the bookstore.

: A second source advised on November 2, 1960, the
principal aim of the WCC is to establish a bookstore in the
Seattle area inasmuch as this need has long been recognized -by

the Washington State CP due to difficulties encountered in main-
taining a Party literature apparatus, and it is desired to have
available public facilities to attract supporters and sympathizers.
This source stated the WCC has obtained a location for its
pookstore at 710 Stewa. Street, Seazttlc, and operations

commenced at that location on November 5, 1960.

A third source advised on May 1, 1967, that the WCC
held its annual meeting of shareholders at the Roosevelt Hotel,
Seattle, on April 30, 1967. As a pari of the business at this
meeting, a report was made on the finaucial status of "Co-op
Books", 710 Stewart Street, Seattle, for the preceding year.

United States against the War in Vietnam.

The train arrived at Washington, D.C., at about
10:45 a.m. The group remained at Union Station, Washington,
D.C., for about an hour waiting for women arriving at the
station from other points, so that the march could begin.

When all were assembled, the group marched in orderly
fashion to Union Square near the Capitol. Prior to the march
it was announced that a small group of men would present
their petition to Congress, while VIVECA\LINDFORS would pc,
read the petition to the assembled group df women at Union™ 7

On April 17, 1959, a confidential source advised
that on February 12, 1958, a Socialist Workers Party (SWP)
minority group under the leadership of National Committee
member SAM BALLAN, split from the SWP. :

The source stated that this minority group,
referred to as the Marcyites, after many years of program
and policy differences on varied issues concerning tactics
and interpretation of political events, split from the SWP
on the grounds that the Party was liquidating itself by
departing from the Marxist precepts of LEON TROTSKY and
retreating from the fi ght for the world socialist
revolution. The final issue which ultimately forced the
split was the minority's ovposition to the SWP regroupment
poli cy which involved cooperation with the Communist Party.
{CP) periphery- -individuals characterized by the minority
as petty-bourgeois,

The minority program, according to the source,
advocated unconditional defense of the Soviet Union and has
as its goal the building of a revolutionary party with a
complete proletarian orientation for the purpose of overthrowing
capitalism in the United States and throughout the world,

On February 1, 1968, Wetective ROBERT BOCK, Intelligence
Division, Chicago PD, advised that’ LUCILLE MONTGOMERY was the
motivating force and almost solely responsible for organizing
.for the Brigade in Chicago, She was assisted as needed by the
individuals listed above in arranging for participation in the
January activity and held several meetings at her apartment in
that regard.

Merete psaet
On April 18, 1968, | Sergeant LOVELY and Detective BOCK’
advised that all information which had been developed by that
agency regarding the Brigade was concerned directly with the :
January march on Washington and the supporting local demonstration
in Chicago January 15, 1968. They had no knowledge that any
meetings or other activitics have been heid subsequent to that
time andvere of the opinion that the organization as a continuing
affair did not "get off the ground" in Chicago.

Information concerning the January demonstrations was
received at that time from numerous Chicago informants. These
and others in a position to learn of any subsequent activity were

Women's National March on
the Pentagon, April 10, 1971

A confidential source, who has furnished reliable
information in the past, on March 10, 1971 made available
a four page folder captioned, "Women's National March On
The Pentagon April 10," sub-captioned, “defend the right-to
live."

This folder reflected women's disagreement with
the Nixon administration's policy in regards to Indochina,
and states, in part, as follows: -

"Our sisters in Vietnam have stretched forth a hand
to us. They are’ our example, We answer them with our strength
together, Women are marching against the Pentagoh ,on April
10. With dignity and rage we march against the American
Medical Association and its health system that cares nothing
about the health of the people. We march against the
partnership between police and organized crime, whicn makes
heroin a big business-----silently endorsed by those who
'govern us', We march against politicians, hustlers and
Kickback men, whose corruption and crimes are paid for by the
people. We march against the injust court system, and for the
freeing of all political prisorrs."

"Grant's Tomb", a community newspaper, upper west
side, New York City (NYC), March, 1971, Number 2 Issue, page
_ 10, contained an article captioned, "women March on
Washington? This article reflected, in part, as follows:

"Out of the outrage against the war that was the unifying

force of the Ann Arbor conference, the women's cuucus decided
to channel our frustration into a public statement calling for
a women's march on Washington, D.C, on April 10, We all felt
the urgency to show how we as women feel oppressed by the same
U.S. system that needs the dominance of men over women, white
over black, brown and,yellow,heterosexual over homosexual, and
over poor to support tre aggressive war policy that is killing
ow Vietnamese sisters and brothers,------

"We are making this march one step in showing the
world our solidarity. as women with all our sisters in Vietnam
who are fighting for their lives, The Ccmmittee to Defend the
Right to Live, a South Vietnamese women's organization, has
called for our support." : :

The confidential source mentioned above on March
15, 1971, furnished information that on March 11, 1971, a
"women's meeting" was held at Washington Square Methodist
Church, 135 West 4th Street, New York, New York (NY).
Approximately 70 people were present. It appears to the source
that the Pentagon action April.10th is being led by the same
women, in the Women's Union", who are planning the trip to ‘
‘“Toronto, Canada~in late MSrch, 1971. The only decision arrived
¢ at during the meeting, according to the source, was that on
“the scheduled date, April lOth, there will be a march on the

Women's National March

Reference is made to New York memorandum
dated March 16, 1971.

On March 24, 1971, a source, who has furnished
reliable information in the past, advised that on March 22,
1971, a "Committee for April 10" held a meeting at the Law
Commune Office, 640 Broadway, New York City (NYC), which
was attended by 30 to 40 females. It was learned that a
woman from the New York (NY) group was already in Washington,
D.C. working with others there to arrange permits, speakers,
et cetera, for the womenS march on the Pentagon on April 10,
1971. It was stated that it was easier to obtain a permit
for a march from the Justice Department to the Pentagon,
than from the Pentagon to the Justice Department, but that
no permit had been obtained as yet. It was pointed out that
a march from the Pentagon to the Justice Department was
preferred as there would be less chance of losing marchers
en route to the Justice Department than from marching
from the Justice Department to the Pentagon. It was stated
that no buses had been chartered at NY, but is was hoped that 7
15 buses would be needed. |

Women's National March
on the Pentagon, April 10, 1971

Law Commune

On September 16, 1969, a second source, who

has furnished reliable information in the

past, advised that the Law Commune is not an

organization in the usual sense of the word.

It is rather a law firm comprised of a group

of lawyers interested and sympathetic to the

New Left and Black Power organizations, and who

counsel and defend individuals in these groups

as the occasion arises. They likewise permit

their premises to be used on occasion as a meeting
‘place for these organizations and distribute

some of their literature.

On March 25, 1971, the second advised that as of
now there is much confusion over the mechanical aspects of
the Women's National March on April 10, 1971, and that the
people in Washington, D.C. will make the ultimate decision
regarding the xoute of the march, The source stated that
in Ny, information concerning buses for Washington, D.C.
will be available at the Upper West Side Women's Center,
627 Amsterdam Avenue, NYC, telephone number 874-6696,

On March 24, 1971, the second source made available
a piece of literature sent out by the "April 10 Women's
Committee" concerning the national women's march on the
Pentagon on April 10. This literature contained in part as
follows:

"we are going to the Pentagon on April 10 to
serve notice on our enemies that women are moving against
them. Our urgency and our fury at the expansion of the
Indochinese war and our rage at the repression of our black
and brown sisters and brothers needs expression right now.
We are joining with other women to struggle for the everyday
things we need and against whatever and whoever prevents us
from getting them. .

"We need and want our sisters around the country
to build for this action in their own ways, and to communicate
with; other sisters their ideas, suggestions and criticisms.
This'is a temporary contact list which came out of the Ann
Arbor Conference:

Women's National March
on the Pentagon, April 10, 1971

Reference is made to New York (NY) memorandum
dated March 26, 1971.

On March 30, 1971, a source, who has furnished
reliable information in the past, advised that on March
26, 1971, a "Committee for April 10" had a meeting at
the McIntosh Student Union, Barnard College, New York City
(NYC), to plan and organize for the Women's March on the
Pentagon on April 10, 1971. The meeting was attended by
30 individuals and had no chairman.

The source stated that at the above meeting, two
representatives,man and wife, from an “Action Committee"
on certain islands near Okinawa, planned a march on April
10, 1971 in Washington, D.C, to protest giving over to
Japan what they feel to be Chinese islands. This march is
to begin at 1:00 p.m. at the Washington Monument, up
Massachusetts Avenue to the State Department, and possibly
oh to the Japanese Embassy. Support of the women's group
was requested; however, after the two left the meeting, the
"Committee for April 10" decided not to support the Chinese
march on the grounds that they were too "liberal."

Women's National March on
the Pentagon, April 10, 1971

The source advised that at the above meeting, it
. was stated that no permit had been obtained as yet for the
Women's March on the Pentagon on April 10, 1971. It was
stated that the march will proceed from a * Werassy spot" at the
Justice Department at noon, past the Bureau of Indian Affairs,
Department of the Interior, Department of Labor and on to
the Pentagon, An hour at each end of the march would be
allowed for speakers, though the group doubted they would use
it. Guerrilla theatre activity by participating groups in
front of the various government buildings was discussed and
encouraged, though specifics were not mentioned,

The source stated that at the above meeting, copies
of a letter to Madame Binh, head of the Vietcong delegation
to the Paris peace talks and the North Vietnamese in Paris,
were passed out, describing the purpose of the April 10 march.
This letter is get forth as follows:

"March 25, 1971

"Dear Mme. Binh,

"On April 10, many of us American women will be
marching on the Pentagon, You know already of the other
actions being planned here against the war. As women, we
are coming out from separate cities and roles, trying to
ereate reality out of what we once held looked up in ow
imaginations. In marching on the Pentagon, we are joining with
all people inside and outside of Amerika, who fight against
Amerika's attempt to control us.

"We've been conditioned so long to accept Amerika's
definition of us as weak, passive, and powerless, and to deny
all our feelings of love and strength, that it has been a
struggle for us to turn towards each other and fight for our
freedom,

"your own long struggle in Indochina, and the struggle
of Third World people here at home, awakened us to the
destruction that Amerikan power represents all over the world.
Your many victories against that power have been an inspiration
to us. But it-wasn't until we joined together to examine and
share our own experiences as women in Amerika that we saw

ourselves not only as your supporters, but as sisters in a
revolutionary struggle for the liberation of all people.

"We are becoming women of the revolution, working
in our own way to stop the bombs from dropping in your land,
at the same time that we work to build day care centers, health
elinics, and a whole culture that will come from and respond
to the needs of all the people, not just the rich and the
powerful. The enormous anger and energy of sisters together
is a force that confuses and terrifies the rulers of Amerika.

"It's so incredibly hard for us to write what
we're feeling, to express to you and our Vietnamese sisters
and brothers the depth and strength of our love and solidarity.

"Tidings of revolutionary joy from sisters inside
Amerika,

"In love and respect,
"April loth Women's Committee"

STUDENTS FOR A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY

Students for a Democratic Society, commonly
known as SDS, came into existence at a founding convention
held during June, 1962, at Port Huron, Michigan. From an
initial posture of "participatory democracy," Marxist-

-Leninist ideology of various shadings became predominant

during 1968-1969 with debate centering on how best to create
a revolutionary youth movement. SDS moved from involvement
in the civil rights struggle to an anti-Vietnam war position
to advocacy of a militant anti-imperialist line linking up
the oppressed peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America

with the black liberation movement in the United States.

All major factions within SDS embrace Marxism-Lenism

and identify internationally with China, Cuba and North
Vietnam as countries leading the worldwide struggles

against the United States. However, the Soviet Union

was regarded as imperialist end with the Communist Party,
United States of America, "xr: visionist" in nature.

SDS operated under a national constitution which
called for an annual Nationa. Convention (NC) and quarterly
National Council meetings wherein programs were initiated
and debated. Three national officers were elected annually
with a National Interim Committee to run the organization.
Regional offices and college chapters elected delegates to
the national meetings but each functioned independently on
local matters. Its official publicition "Fire" (formerly
“New Left Notes") last appeared in december, 1969.

Internal factionalism of serious proportions
developed during 1968 ~ 1969 and tie following three factions
evolved as a result of a split at «he June, 1969, NC:
Weatherman, Worker Student Alliance (WSA), and Revolutionary
Youth Movement (RYM). The effect of the split on SDS chapters
throughout the country was divisive. Some aligned with one
or the other of the three major factions. Others, unable to
identify with any faction, disassociated with SDS completely
and changed names.

The SDS national office in recent years was
located at 1608 West Madison Street, Chicago, Illinois. It
was closed in February, 1970,

the Pentagon, April 10, 1971

Initially called the “Action Faction," Weatherman

¢ came into being immediately before the June, 1969, Students
for a bemocratic Society (SDS) National Convention (HC).
At this NC Weatherman won all three national officer positions
and a majority of the National Interim Committee as well.
Subsequently, they took over the SDS National Office (NO)
in Chicago, and controlled its funds, paper and national
records. Although internal struggle existed until late 1969,
Weatherman for all major purposes controlled SDS nationally
from June, 1969, until its 130 closed in February, 1970. At
this time it no longer considered itself part of SDS.

The term Weatherman emerged from an ideological
paper prepared by its leaders entitled "You Don't Weed a
Weatherman to Know Which Way the Wind blows" ("New Left
Notes" June 18, 1969). This statement outlined the basic
stance of Weatherman: Harxist-Leninist in content but with
strong advocacy that action not theory would bring about
revolution in the United States. This posture was complemented
with an international identification to the Cuban revolution
and CASTRO's statement that the duty of a revolutionary is
to make revolution.

During October, 1969, Weatherman riots in
Chicago resulted in more than 260 arrests for mob action
and related charges. A program of armed struggle was
finalized during a December, 1969, "War Council" wherein
terrorist tactics and political assassination were
contemplated. The basic strength of Weatherman was then
revealed to be some 300 - 350 nationally and geographically
apportioned to the Midwest, New York, and some Northwest.

As its rhetoric of violence escalated, Weatherman
leaders increasingly discussed the necessity of an underground
operation wherein more than 90 percent of the organization
would be submerged; "affinity groups" of three - five members
would function independently. In February, 1970, Weatherman
leaders announced a program of "strategic sabotage" with
police and military installations as primary targets.

In February, 1970, Weatherman abandoned the
SDS NO, 1608 West Madison Str naco, Tilirois, and
throughout the country ertered an un.erscound status,

WORKER STUDENT ALLIANCE/
PROGRESSIVE LABOR PARTY

A source advised duriig August, 1969, that at
the National Convention (NC) of Students for a Democratic
Society (SDS) held in Chicago, [llinois, during June, 1969,
a split arose between the Progr:ssive Labor Party (PLP) and
the National Office (NO), the N) becoming known as the
Weatherman faction. The PLP fastion drew the largest
support among those in attendanve at the NC.

Source further advisel that during late Summer,
1969, the PLP faction of SDS established its National
Headquarters (NH) on the second floor of a loft-type
building at 173A Massachusetts Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts.
The campaign on which the PLP faction centered was to build
a worker student alliance or a campus worker student
alliance. Thus, they adopted the names of Worker Student
Alliance (WSA) or Campus Worker Student Alliance.

Source stated that the "New Left Notes," printed
in New York City, is the official publication of the WSA
faction.

A second source advis2d during January, 1970,
that within the SDS, the WSA is a caucus of which the PLP oH
constitutes the leadership.

A third source advisei during July, 1970, that
during demonstrations stayed ir the Boston area during the
Spring and Summer of 1970 by tr2 NH, the main theme of
previous demonstrations staged oy the NH shifted from |
protestations of the Vietnam Wer and other United States
foreign policy matters to attac<ing domestic issues such
as racism and unemployment and jemonstrating support of
the “workers' struggle."

Characterizations of =he SDS
and PLP are set out separately.

REVOLUTIONARY YOUTH MOVEMENT

A source advised that the Revolutionary Youth
Movement II (RYMII) faction of Students for a Democratic
Society (SDS) held a national conference at Atlanta, Georgia,
from November 26 to 30, 1969. At this conference it was
decided to form a new organization to be known as Revolutionary
Youth Movement (RYM), characterized as a mass anti-imperialist
youth organization, said organization being proposed as
separate and distinct in form and content from SDS. ‘The
"principles of Unity" adopted by the conference included a
struggle against white supremacy and male supremacy: fights
against imperialism, anticommunism, fascism and oppression
of youth; and support of the right of self-determination of
all “oppressed nations," also support of the right of all
“oppressed and exploited" peoples "to armed self~defense."
It was agreed that RYM would not be a Marxist-Leninist
organization; however, source said this was decided in order
to indicate an organization broad enough in form to be
acceptable to everyone. A temporary National Steering
Committee (NSC) made up of eight females and two males was
elected to govern RYM until national officers could be
elected during the Spring of 1970.

RYM publications have listed the RYM National Office
(NO) at Post Office Box 5421 and Post Office Box 77012 Cc,
both Atlanta, Georgia, and a second source has advised that
the NO has no office space but would probably be considered as
located at Apartment 27, 1067 Alta Avenue, Northeast, Atlanta.

Second source advised that women dominated the
founding conference and have continued to dominate NSC
meetings to the point that "women's liberation" has apparently
become the RYM's principal issue - also that RYM's poor
financial condition has resulted in its failure to publish
a paper. During early 1970, RYM has decided to cater to
the working class rather than youth, since the potential for
social revolution lies in workers.

A third source has stated that it was decided at
the March, 1970, NSC meeting that RYM women had decided the
organization will be molded into a "working class, Marxist-
Leninist, revolutionary, anti-imperialist, problack
nationalist, people's women's liberation organization."

A characterization of the SDS
is set out separately.

PROGRESSIVE LABOR PARTY

The "New York Times" city edition Tuesday,
April 20, 1965, Page 27, reported that a new party of
"revolutionary socialism" was formally founded on April 18,
1965, under the name of the Progressive Labor Party (PLP),
which had been known as the Progressive Labor Movement.

According to the article, "The Progressive Labor
Movement was founded in 1962, by MILTON ROSEN and MORTIMER
SCHEER after they were expelled from the Communist Party of
the United States for assertedly following the Chinese
Communist line."

A source advised on June 3, 1968, that the PLP
held its Second National Convention in New York City, May 31,
to June 2, 1968, at which time the PLP reasserted its
objective of the establishment of a militant working class
movement based on Marxism-Leninism.

The source also advised that at the Second National
Convention, MILTON ROSEN was unanimously re-elected National
Chairman of the PLP and LEVI LAUB, FRED JEROME, JARED ISRAEL,
WILLIAM EPTON, JACOB ROSEN, JEFFREY GORDON and WALTER LINDER
were elected as the National Committee to lead the PLP until
the next convention.

The PLP publishes “Progressive Labor," a bimonthly
magazine, and "Challenge-Desafio," a monthly newspaper.

Source advised on May 25, 1970, that the PLP
utilizes an address of General Post Office Box 808, Brooklyn,
New York, and also utilizes an office in Room 617, 1 Union
Square West, New York, New York.

WOMEN'S NATIONAL MARCH
ON THE PENTAGON
APRIL 10, 1971

On March 30, 1971, CV T-1, who has furnished
Seno information in the past, advised that in Kent, Ohio,
x URSHAN.and one other female are the organizers of
the men's National March on the Pentagon, April 10, 1971,
in Washington, D,C. (Women's March). .
CV T-2, who has furnished reliable
information in the past, advised that on
. September 9, 1970, that as of September,
1970, NANCY KURSHAN was one of five
"non-leaders" of the Youth International
Party,.(YIP) in New York City who actually
run the organization.

Source stated that KURSHAN has printed approximately
1,000 leaflets concerning the Women's March. It was learned
that the women from Ann Arbor did not care for the idea of
a Women's March on the Pentagon but the New York Women
overruled the objection since they appealed to the May Day
Coalition to do all the work such as obtain housing for the
people.

On, March 31, 1971, CV T-1 advised that there-would
pe a meeting Thursday night, (April 1, 1971) in Kent, Ohio,
concerning the Women's March. This source stated that.a
leaflet regarding the Women's March was discussed in
Kent, Ohio on March 31, 1971. Source also stated that it was
learned that the Women's group in Boston is planning to travel
by bus to Washington, D.C, on Friday (April 9, 1971),arriving
Saturday (April 10, 1971), and returning to Boston Saturday
night (April 10, 1971).

on a "one-shot" basis for one demonstration observing
international women's day. Backers of the demonstration
were factional Trotskyist elements who are few in number

There is no indication captioned group is
a separate entity, organized for on-going action.

Boston file 100-38735 entitled "EVAN PATCHEN
DELLINGER, aka PATCH DELLINGER; SM - ANARCHIST (BUFILE
100-450988)"' reflected that DELLINGER was subject of
Boston investigation based on his participation in a
"Teach-In" and Rededication Service on 1/29/68 at the
Arlington St. Church, Boston. During the above activity,
DELLINGER made a statement in support of the "Resistance
Group" and turned in what was reported to be Selective
Service cards.

The primary function of the Resistance Group
was to aid, abet, and counsel young men faced with the
draft.

EVAN PATCHEN DELLINGER graduated from Swarthmore
College, Swarthmore, Pa., on 6/6/66 majoring in economics.
He was arrested at Chester, Pa. on 4/1/64 and was charged
with disorderly conduct. ‘

The 1968-69 Harvard University Directory of
Officers and Students reflected that DELLINGER was enrolled
in the School of Medicine, Harvard University, eee
Mass.

It had been reported that PATCH DELLINGE SR was
present at a Socialist Workers Party (SHR) S treet Meeting
in New York City on 7/21/64,

The file further disclosed that inasmuch as the
Boston office had no current information associating DELLIN-
GER with the SWP or the Young Socialist Alliance and that
his activities on behalf of the New England Resistance were
pacifist in nature, it was felt that DELLINGER did not
warrant inclusion on the Security or Agitator Indexes main-
tained at that time; and thus, the case was placed in a closed
status,

Docld:32989544 Page 566



BS 100-44951

A xeview of Boston file 25-25585 (Bufile 25-569484)
reflected that DELLINGER was also subject of investigation
based on his participation in the previously mentioned
Rededication Services at the Arlington St. Church in Boston
on 1/29/68 at which 23 individuals turned in either a
Notice of Classification and/or a Registration Certificate.
Two other individuals turned in some other type of, document.
It was detexmined that DELLINGER had turned in a Selective 2
Service Registration Certificate and two Notices of Classi-
fication issued by LB #28, Flemington, New Jersey. Also,

a two-page statement signed PATCHEN DELLINGER supporting
the Resistance movement was turned in.

In April, 1972, AUSA, Boston declined any prosecu-.
tion concerning DELLINGER.

On 8/21/72, personnel of the Office of the Mass.
Commissioner of Probation, Suffolk County Courthouse, Boston,
a central repository for all traffic and criminal conviction
records within the Commonwealth of Mass., advised that their
files contain no record identifiable with CHARLES WELCH,
WENDY SOBEL, or EVAN PATCHEN DELLINGER.

literature for women."

On March 20, 1972, WF T-3 advised that the "Furies"

WFO 100-55290

Source knew of no radical revolutionary tendencies
or activities being planned or contemplated by any of the
"Furies" members.

On April 10, 1972, WF T-4 advised that several months
. ago, when several girls moved into the residence at 219 llth
Street, S.E., Washington, D.C., they were observed carrying
what appeared to be a printing press into the basement of the
apartment.

Source advised that several females frequented the
house and one of the girls has a baby. Source advised that most
of the girls who frequented the address have extremely short
hair and always wear slacks.

On July 13, 1972, WF T-5 advised that three women,
SUSAN HATHAWAY, SUSAN SCHWING, and COLFTTA REID originally
rented the house located at 219 llth Street, S.F., Washington,
D.C, Source had no background information on any of these
women and was not aware of anyone else residing at the
residence. Source has received no complaints about the
residence from the neighbors.

On July 7, 1972, WF T-6 advised that the Sojourner
Truth Press in Atlanta, Georgia, was a printing press for
hire, which prints mostly "New Left" material for "New
Left" organizations, yet it espouses no opinions of its own.
As long as their fee is met, they will print what is
desired, i.e. papers, pamphlets, flyers, etc.

On September 11, 1972, WF T-7 advised that the Sojourner
Truth Press had gone out of business on August 15, 1972,
due to a lack of funds. Source also advised that the individuals
connected with the Sojourner Truth Press were planning on
leaving Atlanta.

' On September 13, 1972, a telephone call was made to
] telephone number 688-6222, the telephone number for the
Sojourner Truth Press, Atlanta, Georgia, and a recorded voice
advised that service for that telephone number had been dis-
continued,

On July 13, 1972, WF T-4 advised that several young
white girls continued to reside at 219 llth Street, S.E.,
Washington, D.C. They appear friendly, but keep very much
to themselves.

NW 68262 Docld:32989544 Page 590



WFO 100-55290

On August 23, 1972, this source advised that
apparently four or five young white girls now live at

219 llth Street, S.E. Source has seen numerous different

| girls frequenting the residence, but is unsure exactly

how many reside there at the present time.

One girl, name unknown, who resides at the residence,
has stated to source she is a music teacher. Source has
seen several girls on different occasions carrying what
appeared to be newspapers. Source states that all the girls
are generally quiet and keep to themselves.

On September 13, 1972, WF T-5 advised that SUSAN
HATHAWAY, SUSAN SCHWING and COLETTA REID still rent and
apparently reside at 219 llth Street, S.E., Washington, D.C.

Source stated that these three girls continue to
pay their monthly rent promptly and she said that each
- of the girls takes turns paying the rent each month.

Source related that when the dwelling was rented to
these three girls, they made a remark that they were employed
by a "research organization", name unknown, and did most of
their research at the Library of Congress.

Source stated that she has not been in the dwelling
at 219 llth Street, S.E., since it was rented to these three
girls, but she has received no complaints concerning any of
their activities.

On September 14, 1972, WF T-8 furnished the August, 1972
copy of the "Furies" Newspaper.

A subsequent review of this issue, as well as all
| previous issues, did not reflect any radical revolutionary
or anti-government theme. All issues have been devoted to
articles pertaining to lesbian/feminist interests.

On October 12, 1972, WF T-9 advised that an internal
conflict has developed within the "Furies" collective and they
are breaking up into different factions, based on ideological
differents.

| NW 68262 Docid:32989544 Page 591



Whether or not the paper will continue is unknown
at this time.

On December 1, 1972, WF T-9 advised that the
"Furies" stopped publishing their newspaper sometime in
the Fall of 1972.

Source was unable to locate a subsequent issue
after the August, 1972 issue.

AC,

Re WFO report of SA ‘JERRY M. GRAVES, 12/13/72, and ,
WFO letter to Bureau, 1/31/73.

On 3/6/73, tNFORMAMT advised that for. all intents
and purposes the "Furies" organization and collective have
ceased to function. There are no plans to publish another
newspaper, and most of-the members have left to pursue their
own interests.

As réported in re WFO report, investigation of this
case did not reflect any activities on the part of the "Furies" —
that would be consideréd revolutionary or subversive:

The "Furies" newspaper ceased publication in August,
1972, and did not espouse a radical revolutionary line.

In view of the above, this case is being closed.
WFO will remain alert for information regarding any vossible
future activity on the part of the *“Furies", and will report,
same at that time. oA
