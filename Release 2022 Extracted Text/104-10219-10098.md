MEMORANDUM. FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT:

Conversation with Mr. Richard H. Davis re the Milian

Martin, former NSA Employee, Case

At the request of C/SR, I delivered a copy of the

MOScOW

Embassy report on the meeting that two U.S. exchange

professors had

with William Martin

to Mi.

Richard H. Davis,

Deputy Assistant Secretary, EUR On December 13, 1963.

nI. Davis read the paper, said it was very interesting,

remarked that he could not recall that Martin's health situation

in Leningrad had been the subject of press coverage. He said

that the contents of the paper would be of interest

to Secretary

Rusk and Ambassador Thompson. He asked if he could retain the

copy which I brought over in

order to brief them.

He later

added John Guthrie's name to the list.

I agreed.

I told Mr. Davis that we received the paper via our

channels at the Amvassador's request.

Further that the two

American professors had been advised

by the Embassy to neither

Beck nor refuse further contact with Martin and to report in

detail on any further meetings.

4. I asked Mr. Davis if he had any objections to CIA

passing the information to the FBI and NSA.

He said he did

not object and that we could indeed forward the information

to them.
