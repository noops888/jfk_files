Subject: ARRB request re Fabian Escalant Font

1.

The following is a gist of my phone call Thursday

afternoon (30 November) with Gunn re his request to see

Escalant's file (s)*:

As requested by DO; I told Gunn that since we had been

unable to link Escalant with the JFK collection or

investigation the issue of relevance had been raised and

that he would not be able to see any files this week.

Gunn response: "This is an issue that they: (ARRB statf)

takes seriously... if we (Agency] want a 'formal request!.:

would prepare one this afternoon...not a fishing expedition

...information from a credible source in Johnson White

House.. (information] linked to 1964 and CIA...

I suggested that we discuss after he returned from the

Conference. He indicated agreement.

2. Gunn may change his mind and send over a formal

request anyway; he clearly plans to pursue this issue.

I

recommend we ask Gunn to be more specific in terms of

Escalant's relevance to the JEK assassination story,

timeframe and what he is looking for; this could be

either in a meeting with him or in a formal request. He has

mentioned in each of his conversations that the Agency may

not want this to be a formal written request, but is vague

on why.

3. See attached article for Escalant's current

activities re JFK Assassination story.

* [Gunn first raised the issue of Escalant several weeks ago;

last week he ask if it would be possible to view the file

prior to attending a conference on the JFK Assassination

that Escalant would also be attending).

(Station commentary: from the "Evening Information Review"

neuscast,

• . ТЕХТ:

(FBIS Translated Text!: A group of invescigarors, eight U.s.

and suo Cuban, have just held a meeting in Rio de Janeiro,

Brazil.

The group analyzed the polirical circumstances, direct causes, and

nain responsibility for the assassination of U.S. President John F.

Fennedy in November 1963. It is interesting to point out that 32

years after the Dallas assassination, well-tounded doubts continue

to glow over the official reports riven at that time.

• . ГЕХТ:

A seminar enritled: JFK, The Truth Revealed was organized by the

kin de Janeiro authorities in latc August in that capital city.

During that seminar, Cuban and U.S. experts agreed to rule out

the cheory of

a sole killer, which is the main conclusion of the

report issued by the Warren Commission.

The comnission sas

appointed las by the ll.S. government to invesrigare the case.

. .ТЕХТ:

U.S. lawyer Wagne

Smith, forner chiet ot the U.S. Interest Office

in Havana, said he was convinced l.S. secrer services and Cuban

counterrovolutionary clements had plotted to murder President

Kennedy for not authorizing new aggressions agginsi Cuba, atrer the

foiled 1961 mercenary invasion.

Wayne Smith said that, after 30

years of studies and investigations

by specialists from non-

governmental U.S. organizations,

it had been established that

President Kennody had

rejected the plan of implementing new anti-

Cuban operacion in 1903; the same year in which he vas shot to death

in Vallis.

• . TEXT:

It is not futile to recall that during chose days of

counterrevolutionary effervescence -- sponsored, promoted, and

financed by the government in washington -- attempts vere

made to

build a case against the Cuban government on charges that 1r vas

responsible for this crime.

The allegation vas that the Cuban

government was retaliating for the Bahia de Cochinos action.

At

that tine, il was said that the Cuban government had hired several

U.í. Mafia criminals in carry out the arrack.

There vas a great

deal of sperulation about accused ler Harvey Usuald's islis

Moscow and Havana, there he allegedly trained for the Dallas

sperition.

P'esident kennedy's assassination vas lalloved by an unusual

numher of deaths.

accidental and clearly indicared chal some one was trying to crase

.. TEXT:

•Division General Fabian Escalante, from the Cuban Interior

Ministry, represented Cuba at the seminar.

He based his thesis on

ahas fact that the Cuban counterrevulucion had played a fundamental

inde in the assassination.

Gen. Escalante presented a vell-

documented position to back his theory and

was widely-praised by the

seminat's participants. Other thenries presented at chis event

polnted to che collusion between the U.S. Central Intelligence

Agency and che Cuban counterrevolurion sectors, mainly located in

one city of Miami.

.. TEXT:

Recently, several secret documents from the Warren Commission's

investigations vere

They are evidently intended to weaken

the strength of versions chat vere closer to the truth. Anocher lot

It will most surely
