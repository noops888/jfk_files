Note for: C/HRG

Subject: ARRB request re Fabian Escalant Font

on

1. The following is a gist of my phone call Thursday
afternoon (30 November) with Gunn re his request to see
Escalant's file(s) *:

As requested by DO, I told Gunn that since we had been
unable to link Escalant with the JFK collection or
investigation the issue of relevance had been raised and
that he Mena not be able to see any files this week.
Gunn response: “This is an issue that they. (ARRB staff] _
takes hig sencpetar a . if we [Agency] want a‘formal request -..\
would ‘prepare one this afternoon...not a fishing expedition
..-information from a credible source in Johnson | White

House - .- ({information] linked to 1964 and CIA...

Ir suggested that we discuss after he returned from the
Conference. He indicated agreement.

2. Gunn may change his mind and send over a formal
request anyway; he clearly plans to pursue this issue. I
recommend we ask Gunn to be more specific in terms of
Escalant's relevance to the JFK assassination story,
timeframe and what he is looking for; this could be done
either! in a meeting with him or in a formal request. He has
mentioned in each of his conversations that the Agency may
not want this to be a formal written request, but is vague
on why.

3. See attached article for Escalant's current
activities re JFK Assassination story.

*(Gunn first raised the issue of Escalant several weeks ago;
last week he ask if it would be possible to view the file
prior to attending a conference on the JFK Assassination
that Escalant would also be attending].

«TEXT: :

(F8IS Translated Text] A group of investigators, eight U-S.
and tvo Cuban, have just held a meeting in Rio de Janedro, Brazil.
The group analyzed the political circumstances, direct causes, and
main responsibility for the assassination of U.S. President John F.
Kennedy in November 1963. It is interesting to point out that 32
years after, the Dallas assassination, well-founded doubts continue
to grow over the official reports piven ac that time.

«TEXT:

A ee entitled: JPK, The Truth Revealed vas organized by the
Rie de Janeiro authorities in late August in that capital city.
~ TEXT:

During that seminar, Cuban and U.S. experts agreed to rule out
the theory of a sole killer, which is the main conclusion of the
report issued by the Uarren Commission. The commission vas
appointed was by the .S. government to investigate the case.

+ - TEXT:

U.S. lavyer Wayne Smith, former chiet of the U.S. Interest Office
in Havana, said he vas convinced U.S. secret services and Cuban
counterrevolutionary elements had plotted to murder President
Kennedy for not authorizing new aggressions ageinst Cuba, atter the
foiled 196] mercenary invasion. Wayne Smith said that, after 30
years of studies and investigations by specialists from non-
governmental U.S. organizations, it had been established that
President Kennedy had rejected the plan of implementing new anti-
Cuban operation in 1963; the same year in which he vas shot to death
in Dallas.

-TEXT:

it is not futile to recall rhat ducing those days of
counterrevolutionary effervescence -~ sponsored, promoted, and
financed by the government in Washington -- attempts vere made to

build a case against the Cuban government on charges that if vas
cesponsible for this crime. The allegation vas that the Cuban
government was! retaliating for the Bahia de Cochinos action. at
that time, {t was said that the Cuban government had hired several
U.S. Hafia criminals to cacry out the attack. There vas a great
deal of speculation about accused Lec Harvey Uswald’s visits to
Moscow and Wavana, vhere he allegedly trained for the Dallas
oper ition.

Division General Fabian Escalante, from the Cuban Interior
Ministry, ‘represented Cuba at the seminar. He based bis thesis on

the fact that rhe Cuban counterrevelution had played a fundamental
tole in the assassination. Gen. Escalante presented a vell-
documented position to back his theory and vas widely-praised by the
seminar’s pacticipants. Other theories presented at this event
pointed to] the collusion between the U.S. Central Intelligence
Agency and| the Cuban counterrevolution sectors, mainly located in
tie city of Miami.

.- TEXT: |

Recently, several secret documents {rom the Warren Commi ssion’s
investigatilons vere revealed. They are evidently intended to. veaken
the strength of versions that were closer to the truth. Another lot
of evidence, hovever, vas left in the shadov. Tt vill most surely
be revealed when the good and bad people related to this historic
episode have died. :

[FBIS Translated Text] Rio de Janeiro, 78 Aug (AE) -~ The shot
Uhar destroyed the skull of then U-S. President John Fitzgerald
Kennedy on the morning of 22 November 1963, at Dealey Square in
Dallas, strongly hit Latin America, and has had repercussions
throughout the world. This matter vill be discussed beginning 29
August at the Rio de Janeiro Court.

-- TEXT:

At the “JFK -- The Truth Revealed" international seminar, U.S.
investigators and legal experts and Cuban secret service agents will
try to explain how the death uf Kennedy ves masterminded. The
asSassination reportedly divided power in the continent between the
interests of terrorist CIA sectors (among them, Cuban
counterrevolutionaries) and the mafia, which vas responsible for
arms smuggling and international drug trafficking.

+ TEXT:

For the first time, U.S. and Cuban agents, among them Division
General Fabian Escalant Font, of the Cuban Interior Ministry, will
be able to analyze a 14-page document issued by the U.S. Congress,
the classification of which was lifted on 7 May 1994. The document
proves the links betveen Lee Harvey Osvald and Jack Ruby (the man
who killed him hours hefore his trial) and the ties that both of
them had with Florida smugglers and drug traffickers, who vere also
involved in the assassination of Kennedy. The document notes that
Ruby vas one of the mafia bosses who was directly involved an
heavy veapons smuggling.

» TEXT:

In his capacity as chief of Fidel Castro's personal guard, Gen.
Escalant Font managed to foil 648 attacks against the Cuban leader,
most of which vere, according to the Cuban secret service,
masterminded by the CIA. Gen. Font brings, among other surprises,
the identity of the men vho vere at Dealey Square in Dallas and vho

shot at Kennedy from five different places.
. TEXT: va

There is something of which Font is sure: the shot that killed
Kennedy was fired trom a point in front of him, and could not have
been fired by Osvald. At the square, according to agents infiltrated
among the conspirators, vere exiled Cuban gunmen Pedro Dias Lanz,
Orlando Bosch, and Guillerme and Ignacio Novo Sampol, in addition to
Osvald himself. A former U.S. marine, Oswald was ready to assume the
gailt for the attack, while CIA agents would press charges against
the Fidel Castro regime.

. TEXT:

Says Brazilian historian Claudia Furiati, vho vrote the hook
entitled "ZR-The Rifle That Killed Rennedy," based on unpublished
Cuban secret service documents: "The assassination of John F. 7”
Kennedy is not a closed matter, and its consequences are still being _
felt in Brazil and Latin America." ZR-Rifle is the code for CIA -
parallel operptions staged to eliminate foreign figures. The main
target of such operations, which vere not under Kennedy’s control,
was Fidel Castro.

according to the Cuban secret service, Kennedy’s willingness cto
fight the mafia.. restore dialoguc with Cuba, and implement a more
responsible policy toward Latin America, without permanently
resorting to the military, was the reason that led the conspirators
to order his death.

{FBIS Translated Text} According to the Cuban documents, among
the conspirators vere CIA agent David. Phillips, the ZR-Rifle
coordinator (who reportedly also participated in the ousting of
Chilean President Salvador Allende in 1973, and, three years later.
in the assassination of Chilean diplomat Orlando Letelier. a former
ambassador of Salvador Allende in the United States) and Santos
Trafficante, a mafia coordinator, who reportedly hired Cuban gunmen.
According to the Cubans, however, the mastermind behind the murder
was CIA Director Richard Helmes.

Gen. Esealant Font said that the other conspirators who
masterminded the death of Kennedy were mafia members John Rosseli,
Carlos Mareelo and Sam Gianeana; Cuban counterrevolutionarc?
Joaquin Sanjenis, Pedro Dias Lan, Felix Rodrigues, Nino Diaz, Manuel
Actimes, Orlando Rosch, Luts Posada Carriles. and Tony Cuesta, among
ethers; and CIA agents Hovard Hunt, Tony Varona, Gerry Nemming,
Frank Sturgis and Clay Shaw.

» TEXT:

In the secret Cuban documents, Lee Osvald appears as'a special
chap:er. Before the assassination of Kennedy, Oswald -- under CIA
otientation -- learned Russian, lived in the USSR and, from Mexice,

tried to ttavel to Cuba. Ais mission failed. the Cuban agents said
and he could not leave for the island. At chat time, the CIA
contucled. an oftictal of the Cuban Embassy in Mexico to establish a
link betveen Osvald and the Cuban Government, despite the tact that
Oswald's contacts vere precisely among the anti-Castroist
paramilitary militias in Florida.

Says Claudia Furiari: "Osvald vas part of another plan. and the
CIA had already chosen him as the man whe vould appear to be the
oaly one guilty for the death of Kennedy. cven thongh he was not
avare of it.”

. TEXT:

According to Rio de Janeiro Court President Jose, Gama Malcher,
the importance of the seminar on JFK lies in the objections against
parallel power -- like that of the CIA -- vhich several times
attacks legally established pover. "They are powers within pover,
and they are sometimes outside the realm of government control,”
Melcher said.

.- TEXT:

Cuban and U.S. investigators agree on one point: The vorld,
especially Latin America, vas never the came after the death of pe
Vonnedy. i
. TEXT: . -

In the years that folloved his death, dictatorships intenstfied
in Latin American countries, among them Brazil and Chile, vith the
support of radical CTA sectors, and drug trafficking and arms
smuggling began tv operate in a new geopoiitical context, based on
poverful cartels. This vas a revard that the mafia was eagerly
avaiting, atter the Criminal Union declined to establish its old
headquarters in Cuba, which had been strengthened in the time of
Fulgencio Batista, Fidel Castro’s predecessor. The reward for Cuban
exiles was the strengthening of the blockade against the Castro
cegime, while the United States, vhich vas engaged in a strong arms
bualdup policy. extended the var in Vietnam unti} 1973.

Shortly aftecvard, the same CIA agents became invo’
