CHINESE DELEGATE DISRUPTS WORLD PEACE COUNCIL,

28 NOV: 63

Msg Nr: 1357

I learned that in Today's inaugural meeting of the World

Peace Council, on which I am reporting in a dispatch. of the

same date, Professor LANGE, Polish Deputy. 'Chairman of the

Council of State, opened the work by expressing his profound

sorrow over the death of President KENNEDY and affirting that

his passing must be considered a serious loss for humanity.

The French delegate MADAULE expressed similar sentiments, pro-

posing that the entire assembly join in them. While all the

other delegations were agreeing on this proposal, a Chinese

delegate seized the microphone and, despite the Chairman's

attempts to prevent his speaking, sirce the intervention of the

Peking delegation had not been

requested according to procedure,

stated, shouting, that KENNEDY's death should not be mourned

since he was the principal,exponent of aggressive Capitalism

and that if there should be grief', it should be expressed for

all those who had died through the crime of aggression of the

capitalist system, personified especially by the United States.

A profound silence in the Assembly followed the untimely re-

marks of the Chinese'delegate, after which work was resumed.
