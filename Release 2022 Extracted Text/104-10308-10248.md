Miami, Dec. 25, 1963

Dear IRMA,

I hope that you and your family are voll when

this lotter reachos you.

A tew days ago, racolved your letters in new

Jersey, but since I left for Miami with my friends on

Saturday, in order to stay there two weoks and to take cure

of some business, I

did not write until I got here.

I want to toll you that there was some difficulty

with the vitamines, because the company which was supposod

send them could not do so and I had to lind another ageacy

to. do it because nobody wants that merchaudise, due to tie

but 1 was able to lind onc

that you will notify ne

as soon as you get then, because this is a new agency

for me.

I am glad that I am ablo to do that favor becauso

I think as much of that boy as I do myself.

Toll my uncle FLANCISCO that his nephew from de:ie.

going to write to him and is going to send the IllA letter t:

your address.

I will tell you about keNNedy's death in the othe

lotter when I am 1a New Jersey. A11 thât is a ?.

Stops are boing taken for your uncle to be able t:

get out of Moxico and I think that it vill be possiblo to get

the visa soon, and to have him hero.

I am not saying anything to you about Miami

because I do not want to draw any conclusions yot:"

Weil, IRMA, writo to me at my addross in New Jersi

as usual. Regards to

the whole fantly.

Your brothor in Christ,

(Sigu'" with Initials that look likr J.(.)
