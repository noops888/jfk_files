PURPÖSE

CONSIDERATIONS

Collect and report intelligence on anti

regime attitudes, on potential resist-

ance, and on vulnerabilities and

strengths of Communist security,

system.

There is a rick that this action will dieclose this U.S.

intelligence activity within Cuba, Selected personnel

are being intensively trained.

This first team has 2

agente. An area in which resistance has been reported

has been selected. Agent operations must stay alive

make useful contacts, and report securely to CIA:

Physical risk to personnel is substantial, due to lack

of intelligence.

First reports from Wept team are

expected by the end of March, while reporte from the

second and third teams, dispatched in March, are ex-

pected to start in April:

Many of the agents infiltrated into Cuba will be trained

for paramilitary skille as well as intelligence, collection,

with the thought that they will be in place incide Cuba

and ready to act whenever paramilitary operatione are

decided upon. However, CLA has noted that, once the

agents are inside Cuba, they cannot be controlled

effectively from outside Cuba, although every effort

will be made to attempt such control.

These staff intelligence officers may also be used in the

future for communications or agent handling. it future

developments warrant.

ACTIVITY

4. * Caribbean Admission Center;

Opa-Locka, Florida, fully

activated by. 15 March 1962.

PURPOSE

To collect intelligence required for the

operations, to identify and earmark in

telligence assets as refugees arrive,

and to provide security against Com-

munist agent operations.

5. #

Periodic intelligence esti-

mates,

as required by progress

of operations.

To up date NIE 85-62, so that current.

estimates can be considered at national

policy levels.

CONSIDERATIONS:

This operation,

in response to early recommendation

as essential by the Chief of Operations; is moving at

utmost speed to become fully active by 15 March, with

a new building completed and occupied, and with a

staff of 43 at work. Overatione commenced 15 February

and, as of 9 March, 33 people were active at the Center.

(ClA responsibility, with support by Defense, Justice,

State,: USIA:)

As the operations develop, there will be both increased

intelligence collection and a need for as current an In-

telligence Estimate as the U.S. can produce meaningfully.

It is likely that a more informal method of producing an

Intelligence Estimate for use at the national level (than

now governing the issuance of NIE's) may bave to be

followed. CLA is now publishing daily intelligence sum-

maries on Cuba and is planning a bi monthly or weekly

report summing up intelligence for this purpose: (CIA

respondibility. with support of others as'required)

OTHER OPERATIONS:

"Continue negotiating for

British help in contaminating

locomotive lubricante..

To cripple Cuba's rail transportation.

British assistance is required to undertake a successful

sabotage of Cuban locomotives, through contaminating

lubricants. It is expected that a minimum of 3 months

is required before locomotives in Cuba start breaking

down, once the contaminant is introduced.
