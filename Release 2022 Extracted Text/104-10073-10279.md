3. Respectable Intellectual Front: Following funda-
mental Conaunist principles for nets dovencnt tare, Geter
than the JCP itself follows these tenets), the ex-JCP

organizers of BEREIREN kept themselves in'’the background
and lined up a number of prominent Japanese progressive
intellectuals and leftist cultured persons to front for
BEHEIREN. The choice of ODA Makoto, ox-Fulbrighter and
popular young novelist, to b@ the chief front man — Chair=
man - was an extremely lucky stroke for BEHRIREN. ODA has
‘ taken to this grand-standing, front work like a duck to
water. It has given him a chance to give unbridled vent to if
bis own latent anti-American feolings, puffed him up to the
extent that he has been dubbed “the emperor" by other BENKIREN
activista, and given him at long last an ideological mission
to pursue. YOSHIKAWA has performed magnificently in feeding
ODA's ego needs and in infusing end indoctrinating ODA so
that his words and actions take on sufficiently virulent
anti~Anerican overtones, ODA bus served anothor vital
function for BENEIREN by recruiting a sizeable number of
« £ellow intellectuals to join the ranks of BEEBIREN activists.

4. Organizational Development: In its 2-1/2 year history,
BEESIREN has not appreciably changed its organizational foraat,
although it has moved its office three tines and modified its
mame even oftener, EBEREIREN is not a “mass organization", be-
cause it has had no “sizeable popular backing to the present
time. Its hard core, secretariat organization is run by
YOSHIKAWA and his lieutenants. Its public image, intellectual
front is led by ODA, and given body by a‘score of like-minded

ntellectual friends of ODA and YOSHIKAGA, who form the loose
body of BEHEIREN's activist leadership. Under this BEMEIREN
leadership superstructure lies a paltry base of only several
hundred BEHELEEN “rank-and-file“;supporters, mostly young
Japanese students. Organizationally, BEHEIREN has no formal
membership system, so its base of supporters is fluid and not
precisely measurable. However, the base support for BEHEIREN
has definitely been on the upswing during 1967, and made such
. moteble strides during the past summer that JCP Headquarters
officials finally felt conStrained to note with concern that -
BEEEIREN was beginning to drain off a growing number of. pro-
gressive youth who otherwise would have been absorbed into
the JCP's own youth movement. BEEEIREN leaders have tried to .
help this growth along by setting up a youth section, calling
it "Young BEHRIREN." BSEHEIREN's imaginative actions and
publicity-conscious programs have heen responsible for its
recent growth, and this period of growth seems to he now on

SECRET.



the verge of really picking up speed and tomentun. As a result
of its role in the case of the four deserting sailors, BEHEIREN
has reaped bountiful publicity, has succeeded in touching a
delicate Japanese public nerve of sympathy and pacifism, open-
ing a floodgate of support for BEHEIREN from all over Japan.
When this case fades from the limelight, it is still most
likely that a fair percentage of current wave of, lar

support for BEHEIREN wil: ermane: cking,
giving for the first tine, a meanaug: ase to

support its future activities,

a &. Activities and Accom ishments: BEHEIREN has engaged
“an a nunber of pro: propaganda actions; and actions, participated in inter-
national anti-Vietnam War activities. It has tried to co~
operate with certain front activities in Japan controlled by
the JCP, most notably the gapen Committee to Investigate War
Crimes in Vietnam activitii which culminated in the Tokyo
Court of last Atigust, but has been soundly and rudely rebuffed
“by the JCP.. In spite of this, BEHEIREN bas churned along at
its own pace, with a continuing series of anti-Vietnam war
_ actions, most of them related in some way to the American
/“pacifist movement. In this regard, BEHEIREN has succeeded in
cornering a virtual monopoly on Japanese contacts with the U.S.
pacifist movements, and has effectually capitalized on this to
promote its own action program. The case of the four deserting,
sailors, while an spparent lucky windfall for BEHEIREN, only
points up the fact that BEEEIREN, through past organizational
work and promotional activities, was “johnny-on-the-spot",
ready and capable (unique in Japan in this regard) to take
the ball and run with it. BEHEIREN ran all the way in this
case and scored its most notable success since it was organized.
(Attachment 2 is a listing of BEREIREN's more notable activities
since its founding. Attachment 3 is a partial listing of
American and other foreign persons kno\ to have been in
contact with or cooperated with BEHEI)

B.: The Case of the Four Sailor Deserters and BEREIREN.

1. How It Starter The consensus of all available overt
medin material, with no recorded dissent, indicates that the *
four sailors voluntarily left their ship, went AWOL, and ended

=“ Mp wallowing around Tokyo's hippie-land. - Precisely what personal

» grievances prompted the four to embark on this mis-adventure is
not yet known. But, up to this point, the four could fairly be
categorized as misguided youngsters, gone astray in a foreign
land, and due to get slapped back in line with traditional

Navy justice when they finally decided to stop the fun and go

back to the ship. So far, this made their cases far from

Seg. s ; But instead of returning to
‘stip of their ovn volition or being apprehended by. tha
be Patrols the four made contact with BBHEIREN leaders,
Again, press reports indicate that this was just a coincidenco,
‘that there was no pre-planning by the four to contact PEMZIREN,
stetere are no available overt nor ‘covert reports that indicate
otherwise.'; But, once the BEHEIREN people’nade contact, they
recognized the potcatial imnediately and:moved fast for the
Eo Mall.» (Attachment 4 ie a Yoniuri Newspaper clipping, 22 Nov-
enber 1967, that is both « representative and comprehensive
account of this phase of the case. Even if this article
whould contain some minor inaccuracies, the basic line sees
factual and bas not been challenged cleewhere.) ,

.°: BEMBIREN Takes Over: “When the four made contact with

& BEEEIREN, it suddeniy became an entirely different ballganc.

BEHEIREN had everything needed to capitalize on this: veteran

és; metivist leaders who are experienced enough to recognize the
windfall that had come their way; an apparatus that could

Sy provide hiding places for the four; long standing lisison

% contacts with Soviet Enbassy officials for use in pleuing ll

exit from Japan; solid conta reliable Ancrican

pacifists with whom the bona fides of the four sailors could

be checked; money and organization to capitalize on the

propaganda potential (such as preparing a movie film for the

= initial BEHEIREN press conference announcing the desertion,
prepared more likely than not by BEHERIREN stalwart KUBO.

activists capable of sympathizing, encouraging, soothing, or

agitating iad four young sailors, so that there would be 20

#4." The BENRIREN Apparatus At Work: While many of the
er mpall pieces of this Soaisse le, which would put the whole case in

proper deteiled chronological order and eliminate speculation
kyon minor points, are still missing, enough is known now,

;a°) through overt and covert sources, that the picture of BEHEIREN's
TEs bePt handling of this case shines through clearly. The follow
16 ing elements, all part of the BEERIREN apparatus, make up the
ulk of the picture: ne 4 * : 7

% a) |e-ow When EEREIREN got hold of the four on -
about 26 October, they had to be hiden out for the approximate
two week period until their exit from Japan could be arranged.
This presented BEHEIREN no great logistical problem. A number
of the BEHEIREN activist leaders have homes vell suited to
harboring fugitives. For example, BEHEIREN activist leader
hos a villa hidden avay in Chigasaki, which

was used on the night of 12 September for 2 meeting of about
20 top BEERIREN leaders, and which would be highly suitable

Sreeriiin both the Kanto and Kansai sreas.

YOSMIEANA has maintained periodic contact with Soviet Exbassy
officials for years. BEEEIREN Chairmen ODA hss met Soviet

“ Vasilyevféh, and second by YOSHIKAWA to First Secretary
Sergey D. Anisinov, urgently requesting a private meoting
later that day to discuss “an extremely important, extrencly

delicate matter", without doubt the case of the four sailors.

c). BEREIREN/U.S. Pacifist Linison: BENEIREN contacted
Dartmouth University professor Ernest. P. Young, who flew to
Japan on & November, apparently helped BEEBEIREN leaders chock,
out the bona fides of the deserters, and returned to the U.S.
on 11 November, (Attachment 5 isthe translation of a Sankei
Shinbuy article, dated 21 November, reporting an interview
‘With Young, giving his version of his role in this case.)

5. . Escape to Moscow: The four deserters turned up in
_Moxcow on 20 Novenber. The press has speculeted widely ard
‘unanimously that the four left Japan on the Soviet passeager
ship Baikal on 11 November. Again, there is no dissenting
opinion, overt nor covert. The only mystery concerning this
final phase of the Japanese portion of this case concerns the
_mechanics of how the four boarded the Baikal and who assisted
. im this maneauver. But with the sailing of the Baikal fron
Yokohama, BEHBIREN completed its most highly successful and
beautifully executed activity in its 2 1/2 year history. Not

. only did BEBDIREN smear the American Government's image in
Japan, not only did SEHEIREN gain a vast amount of priceless
publicity that will swell the ranks of its supporters and be
invaluable in future activities, but BEEEIREN doubtlessly .
even made a profit, financially, on this low budget operation
- donations are still pouring into BEEZIREN Headquarters fron
allover Japan to “help and protect U.S. deserters”. 9: +;
