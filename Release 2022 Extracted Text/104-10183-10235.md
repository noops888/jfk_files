b. A/1 was requested to meet Carlos Jorge
ROBRENO Marquez aka “El Mage’ who has communicated
with A/1 by letter and phone from Paris o2 several .
occasions, having brought 2 “personal" message from”
AMLASH/1 for A/1. A/1 is also to get a good assessment
of "EL Mago", including a determination nis reasons
for Ieaving Cuba, or considering so, permanantly. It

is possible that "£1 Mago" may be a good prospect for
récruétiient; although as an individual, he is not
particularly palatable. This opinion is also that

of both AMLASH and,A/1; but as an action type, he may
te suitable for specific tasks. (See report of

28-29 February 1964 Meeting) A/1 was told to bear

in mind that a person of this type could have been
co-opted hy the DSE in return for dropping of possible
criminal charges for public prawls, etc. As discussed
{n-the previous contact report, "El Mago” drinks
heavily to the extent that he upon more than one
peeasion has gotten into serious brawls, including
the one several years ago in which he shot an American
citizen for alleged advances to a girl friend of his.
(EL Mago's" motives and true allegiance remain clouded,

to say the least.)

c. According to letters from “El Mago," Jose
Alberto IBARRA Martin, aka “EL Loco Blanco", is
expected to follow “EL Mago" to Paris; and he too
has additional -information ‘from ANLASH. At this
writing, "El Loco" has not arrived in Paris. El Le
is of the same ilk, same crowd, as "Et Mago," but not
very bright.) A/i was also asked to debrief him,
assess, and report if he showed up hice Tigi was in town.

developed by A/l-

e. A/1 was requested to spend the minimam time
necessary in paris to accomplish the above missions, then
fly to Geneva to assist LAPSLEY at the UNCTAD activities.
Upon being showa a list of the known delegates, he stated
that he did vot know any ‘of them personally, put through
several mutual friends and other ploys, he felt that he
could inject himself into their circles to a useful degree.
A/1 has valid reason to be in gwitzerland as he often

goes there ia connection with jexelry purchases, and to
soe his business partner AMWATP/2, who resides in Geneva.
A/iL also volunteered to check in with the Rome Station in
the eveat there was something ne could do for them. as
