Sonetime later the sane day, IGLESIAS called back to

the jewelry

would be taken to Paris and placed

in the care of CARRILLO, who was empoxered to close the

deal on the spot if the price were right.

During this

meeting with the undersigned All stated that he was

interested in looking into

if we had no

objections,

as deking remembered seeing the Jewelry in

Havana in 1960 at which time he assessed it as being

worth in the vicinity of some 250,000 dollars.

also commented that he thought this particular batch of

jewelry was that which "Che" GUEVARA had taken into his

personal possession at the time.

A/1 was told that

there were no objections from KUBARK, as loag as A/1 was

aware of all the possible ramifications. A'l was asxed

to get all the particulars

on the transaction and its

background. Paris is to keep Hqs. informed of this as

developed by A/1.

A/l was requested to spend the minimum time

necessary in Paris

to accomplish

the above

missions,

fly to Geneva to assist LAPSLEY at the UNCIAD activities.

Upon being shown a list of the known delegates,

he stated

that he did not know any of them personally,

but through

several mutual friends and other ploys, he felt that he

could inject himself into their circles to a useful degree.

A/l has valid reason to be in Stitzerland as hu often

goes there in connection with jewelry parchases, and to

see his business

partner, AVWAIP/2, who resides in Geneva.

A/1 also volunteered to check in with the Rone Station in

time in order

to follow up with his contacts

with "El Mago",

CARRILID, and possibly with "El Loco Blanco."

f. It was stressed to A/l that his actions in all

meetings with Castroites should be consistent with his

reputation as a basically apolitical businessman who

maintained friendly relations with his old acquaintances

and friends

still with the Castro governnent and/or

resident in Cuba.

We believe that he is fully aware of

and will proceed

with sufficient caution

as not to

jeopardize his

entre into Castro government circles in

Cuba and abroad.
