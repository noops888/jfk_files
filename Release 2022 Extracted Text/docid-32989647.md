BLACK PANTHER PARTY

> The above source imdicated that following the speeches,
there was a presentation of “black musie and black dances."
There were no incidents whatsoever in connection with this
program, and the Beloit College paid the BPP for appearing on
this occasion,

An article appeared in the "Beloit Daily News," a
newspaper published daily at Beloit, Wisconsin, on March 24,
1969, entitled, "Revolution." The artiele carried the sub-
caption, "The Black Panthers View 1969 as Year of Change in
America."* The article quoted an unnamed spokesman for the
. Chicago BPP as having said the following at an ~exnosur ed
program at the Beloit College Chapel:

2. "It seems hard for some people to understand that
this country is going toward the brink,” The article indicated
thet Fred Hamptan, Nennty Chairman nf the RPP ofs Thlinnis,
had stated that black people in 1969 are going to cause a “change
in America, and that the BPP is going to cduse this change,
Hampton further challenged the blacks to take the initiative
in bringing about thé change instead of relying on whites to
change things for them.’ Hampton also stated that revolution
was imminent, but he was quoted as sayimg that revolution
does: not mean that black people would take over because he said
if black people took over, then there would be another
revolution because of the white people, He indicated the
revolution was just a means of "radical change."

This article further indicated that Alvino Shinn,
Deputy Minister of Finance, BPP of Illinois, classified™’the -
BPP as basically a propaganda unit. - Shinn s ated, "Our
philosophy is based on Marxism, but that doesn't mean we're
communists." Shinn further denounced capitalism and Stated
that the black people did not want to be fooled any longer
by talk of democracy; He stated that democracy means imprison-
ment. BEE

The article said that Hampton talked of means that
may be employed in the "revolution." He predicted, "Guns
will prove to be the final answer, becamse whites carry guns
into the ghetto." He was further quoted as saying, "You stop

guns with guns,"

BLACK PANTHER PARTY --

A second’ confidential source of the Milwaukee Office,
who has furnished reliable information in the past, furnished
the following information on April 30, 1969; .

On March 27, 1969, he determined that the Dominican
College, Racine, Wisconsin, was sponsoring a program this
evening to be held at Breakers Building, and that the program
was to spotlight Negro culture. It was noted that at the.
parking lot around Breakers Building were parked numerous
vehicles bearing Illinois and Wisconsin license, plates,

‘The program was attended by an undetermined number

of students, most of whom were young whites, men and women,

Many2appeared to be "hippies," and there were several who

appeared to be part of the staff at the College, An unidentified
- ° Negro female took charge of the progratl, and she, announced
that the program would éntail a short skit to show tne Negro
image as it had been in the past and then a talk and a discussion‘
would be presented by Chicago Black: Panther members to’ show the
present day Negro status. The skit was a highly. emotional
two-part presentation depicting the slave factions on the
plantation and -the beating of a colored girl.with a leather
strap by a white slave master. Much reference was made to
"Niggers" and to “Dirty Niggers." Much hysterical praying
‘and crying was done by the sole Negro female participant in
-the play.

Following the play, several unidentified Black
Panthers then showed a newsreel, which depicted all the
various modern police weapons, including tea? gas, mace,
and the new Smith and Wesson dart tranquilizer guns. The
movie depicted various riot: situations, but the sounds being
madé, by participants were largely inaudible. Nevertheless,
various distinct statements were made by people -in the film
in reference to what was being done to a Negro femade. They
said she was beaten in the head by a policeman and then someone
said that a Negro ma,e had been shot in the back by a policeman,

> Subsequent to the film, a young ‘unidentified Negro

male, who was introduced as the Security Agent for the Black
Panthers, arose and stated that "Sh__is going to hit the fan
this summer." He stated Racine is isolated from Chicago-by
distance, but that the members of Chicago Black Panthers

1 had come to help them organize at Racine. He then introduced
the Secretary of the BPP, a Negro female, whose name source
could not recall, who discussed the meaning of the aforementioned
film. She was then responsible for showing a second film
which depicted the ten point program of the Black Panthers.
‘She expressed to the crowd a displeasure with them because
she heard some snickering regarding some of the points depicted
in this film, particularly the points that all Negroes should
be freed from prisons at once, no matter the crime, and that
they? should all be draft exempt.

: - _ The source indicated that during the sweech by
i the prieeniered Chief of the Black Panthers, he welcomed all
the students to the meeting as well as “all the FBI, Cid,

and PD persdnnel" that might be in the group.

The above raat left the meeting as it was breaking
up, and he indicated that no incidents*were reported during
the meeting or subsequent -to the meeting He indicated further
that he had observed some of the vehicles parked at the College
‘and had noted some propaganda material lying on the seats of
some of the automobiles, He indicated specifically that he
had seen a stack of papers from the People Free Republic
of China and other books entitled simply, "Propaganda."

. The above source alvised further or this date that
the visit by the Black Panthers at the College had been paid
- by the Student Council of Dominican College. This money :
was ‘allegedly raised through collections. This money was also
to pay for Black Panther newspapers and other literature which
had been passed out by the six Black Panther member$ who had
attended the meeting,

BLACK PANTHER PARTY
According to its official newspaper, the

Black Panther Party (BPP) was started during December
1966’ih Oakland, Calif., to organize black people so
they can take control of the life, politics, and the
destiny of the black community. It was organized by
Bobby George Seale, BPP Chairman, and Huey P, Newton,
BPP Minister of Defense. Newton is presently serving
a sentence of 2 to 15 years on a conviction of
manslaughter in connection with the killing of an
Oakland Police officer.

”

The official newspaper, "The Black Panther,"
which further describes itself as the "Black Community
News Service," states that the BPP advocates the use of
guns and guerrilla tactics in its revolutionary program
to end oppression of the black people, Residénts of
the black community are urged to arm’themselves against .
the police who are consistently referred to in the ~
publication as "pigs" who should be killed,

. i "The Black, Panther" issue of septenber in
1968, CoRtains an saiveriai by BRP Mimisice of ‘Bducation,
George seine Murray, which ends with the following: a
“Black men. Black people, colored persons of
America, revolt everywhere! Arm yourselves. The only
culture’ worth. keeping is a revolutionary culture, Change.
Freedom everywhere. Dynamite! Black Power, Use the
.gun., Kill the pigs everywhere!

Included in the introduction to an article
appearing im the October 5, 1968, edition of "The Black
Panther" is the statement, "...we will not dissent from
American Government. We will overthrow it."

a

Issues of "The Black Panther" regularly contain
quotations from the writings of Chairman MAO Tse-tung of
the People's Republic of China and feature MAO's statement
that "political power grows out of the barrel of @ gun.”

: The national headquarters of the BPP is “located
at 3106 Shattuck Avenue, Berkeley, Calif. Branches have
been established at various locations throughout the
United States, ‘ :

We want freedom. We want power to determine
the destiny of our black community.

We want full employment for our people.

We want an end to the robbery by the. white
men of our black community.

We want decent housing fit for shelter of
human beings.

expose the true nature of this decadent ater
society.

We want all black men to be exempt from
military service. . :

We want an immediate end to Sonics brutality
and murder of black people. 7

We want freedom for all black men held in:
Federal, state, county and city prisons and jails.

We want all black people when brought to trial to
be tried in court by a jury of their peer

group or people from their black community as
defined by the constitution of the United States.

justice and peace, and as our major political
objective, a United Nations supervised plebiscite
to be held throughout the black colony in which
only black colonial subjects will be allowed to
participate for the purpose of determining the
will of black people as to their national destiny.

The following two articles by RUFUS WALLS,
who is the Minister of Information, Chicago Chapter
BPP, appeared in the first spring semester edition
of the "Phoenix", an underground-type newspaper
published by Negro militants at Crane Junior College,
2250 Wést Van Buren, Chicago, Illinois. The newspaper
was distributed on Crane campus on February 12, 1969.

"BLACK CAPITALISM

"Pirst, we must understand the true term used for
Capitalism. It denotes the economic system set up by.
Flanders in the 13th century and Florence in the 14th
century which mainly was long distance trading. Their |
histories shed light on the conditions as developed
by the total Westerm World. The English woolen in- .

economic system for private profit until it became the
roots of all evils. The selfish owners expanded

their means of production hy creating civil wars,
murdering.and raping Asia, Africa, Latin America and

even their own motherland while America assisted in

the most barbaric acts ever perpetrated by man!

"Under Capitalism, all decisions concerning pro-
duction and who will get the profit is always made
by the rich (sic) In America, it is a handful of
White Anglo-Saxons (JOHNSONS, KENNEDYS, ROCKEFELLERS,
and a few more) who are making decisions for all ethnic
groups. Under Capitalism, the working class. (95%)
have no choice but to sell their energy or better yet
their backs for token economic gains. In order to be.
a Capitalist, one must have capital and Black People
have no capital nor own any means of production.
We are a Capitalist people! We are a landless people!
We are the poorest of the poor! Why are we in this
bag? Historically the Black colony was created for
the purpose of super-exploitation. Being a product
of the system-~a system that enslaved our forefather--a
system that burned Black people alive, lynched and

NW 65360 Docld:32989647 Page 52 ; : oe



crushed pregnant Black women. to death! A-system that -
keeps us on a reservation and the bureaucrats who
uphold and perpetuate this system don't give a

damn if bread is on the reservation or not! What is
ironic when we try to get off the reservation, they
think they are justified in killing us?.

"If Black people or a handful in essence~-one
in every ten thousand should be given franchises to
set up a monstrous machine in the Black colony it
would be a counterpart to the tyrannical white Anglo
Saxon's. Who would they exploit! It is understandable
while the pig (sic) NIXON so readily endorsed Black
Capitalism. Are we so blind until we cannot see that
this is just another smoke screen to deny us of
total equality?

"We believe and understand that the term Capi
as well as so-called Black Capitalism is irrelevan
to us. For the simple reason there will only be a few
more material goods, a few more advantages, a few more
privileges; so those who run the show are going to do
a little bit better!. What will happen to the Black
have-nots in this country? We must tune our minds in
on promoting the interest of the Black have-nots who
are the majority in this country. The people must con-
trol the material goods, the means of production if
they are ever to abolish, exploitation of money hungry
pirates. :

,

7 "We know, slick NIXON knows, and we Black Panthers

must inform and educate the people through activity.
Activity through any means possible to bring about
radical reforms if we are to survive as a people!!"

"BLACK MAN,.LISTEN?.

"I think there are many profound, incisive, and
elusive things that Black men find hard to say to other
i Black men; but I'm inclined to believe it's the small
7 7 things of life we find hard to say t. each other--small
H _: but important things that will mode our, destiny. I'm
. going to say some cf the small things that are very
important dealing with our future. Brace yourself
brothers, I'm going to give you the lay of the land!

"Here-we-are trapped in a monstrous unprecedented
dilemma that's crushing the life out of us! Stripped
of all manhood, no authority to -make any laws concerning
our lives nor authority to say when our children are to
go to school or what kind of education they are to
receive. Horrifying! Yet I hear and read so much
negative lip protest 2 so much negative literary-pro-
test. Begging for political justice from ‘the enemy,
I say it's futile to ask the oppressor for freedom
because he can't free us even if he wanted to in a
Capitalistic system. As long as we continue ‘to beg and
rage, they will only give us arguments and continue
to say we're uncool and not ready. This really hurts
when they say we are not ready because it's the--
notorious truth--Black men don't beg, they demand!

"We must redefine the term Black Man just as
MALCOLM X and HUEY P. NEWTON did and stand firm on
our beliefs and if necessary let there be rivers of
blood in maintaining our beliefs. As a Black Man or”
those whom are conscious of self and environment, it
is our responsible to re-educaté the people in which
they will know what avenues to approach toward alter-
nating the Black Colony in which the masses will
benefit. :

: . "First, we must heighten the contradictims around
the so-called iaw and that jive : constitution. We

-8-

must politically stimulate the minds of our people
where as they will understand that what is really
happening to them and why? Our teachings must focus
‘on national as well as international issues so we

ean equate and analyze our situation with other
oppressed nations in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.
We must heighten the contradictions around the history
in which we were white washed by the power structure's
monstrous--misleading communication system-~dogmatic
papers and books, irrelevant television series, and
naive radio programs.

"Second, we must emphasize and highly stress
that all Black Teachers, Artists and Clergymen praise

‘and glorify Black Freedom fighters who have been

murdered or incarcerated by hands of the enemy. From
HARRIET TUBMAN--MARCUS GARVEY-~~-MALCOLM X-~DR. KING to
HUEY P, NEWTON; this must be done for pride and dignity.
These methods of teaching must be profound and incisive
in order to bear ripe fruit. This is needed to stimulate
the mind, Hence, the mind will be transformed toward
self-emancipation. a

"This package carries the seeds for transplanting
a new nation of Black People. -A package that will
fuse Black Solidarity, a package that will produce
undying love and courage where as it's people will not
compromise, nor give one iota to the enemy... They will ~
understand and know enae they will be giving-~their
freedom!

"Look! Black Man, this is the only way to lift
the yoke of bondage that is oppressing as in this
decadent oligarchy society: I see and understand
we're dealing with inhuman elements (pigs) who have long
dehumanized each other by their racist beaucratic

-Capitalistic system which has plagued a paranois

~ atmosphere throughout the entire world!

.The following article by RUFUS WALLS,
appeared in recent issue of the "Phoenix" and was
distributed on Crane Junior College campus on
April 1 and 2, 1969:

"PIG POLICE IN BLACK COMMUNITY

"We are living in a police state (Fascism); not
only do pigs forcibly subdue all Black Orientated
organizations, but they are allowed to freely walk
the streets of our black communities and use any means
at their disposal (clubs, mace, 357 Magnums, ec.) in
order to contain and brutalize Black people.

“We must take a stand! We must be prepared for
the consequences. We must face these pigs just as
HUEY P, NEWTON: did in this present state of police
oppression. (Pig Barbarianism) Why are so many police
in the Black Community? Why is-the stop and frisk law
only applicable to Black People? Why are our Federal,
state, county and city jails only filled and splattered
with the blood of Black People? Why must our. Black
People unnecessarily face constant police harassment
and agitation? Why are missiles bordering every Black
Community in the country?

"Why are So many so-called riot control weapons
being stockpiled? We must understand and deal with
the fact that our community is now facing the unmerciful
gestapo--the occupational army--namely the Pig Police.
In order to deal with the tail--we must first deal with
the head boar--Tricky Dick Daily whose only claim to fame is
the exploitation of Black People! We must support,
unite and call upon all people to destroy these pigs
swiftly and in whole without mercy. Not only- must we
move on the pigs but the money hungry pirates who own
stores--~grocery, clothing; hardwares, restaurants,
currency exchanges, business events, real estate, etc.,

“whom are not sensitive and loyal to ihe Black Community.

- 10 ~-

eS



No longer can we sit back and accept humiliation and
exploitation of these racist money hungry pirates.

"We must know, understand, deal with the system
that has created these horrible conditions for Black
People. Capitalism is the mother that nursed this
monster into being. Yes! Capitalism created this
Fascist Police State along with the dehumanization
processes that has murdered millions of Black People
and mentally crippled millions of Black People. This
system must be destroyed before it destroys all of us.
The beast is on her last leg and she is pulling ‘us
down into a bottomless cesspool with her. This beast
is falling because of the lies she has told and the
blood shed all over the world.

"Yesii She is falling and she knows it: She knows
the oppressed people are sick and tired of her barbaric,
oppressive policy. We must, for survival sake, create

anew front in the Black Community just like. the one
in Viet Nam?

On-February 14, 1969, FRED HAMPTON, Deputy
Chairman, BPP, Chicago Chapter, spoke at Old Town's
Boy's Club, 1207 West .Madison Street, Chicago, Illinois.

HAMPTON explained the BPP ten points and

described the BPP as a military group. He stated the
purpose of BPP is to correct the abuses in this society.

visited upon the Blacks and to build a powerful Black
society, which can deal effectively with the white beast.

All Blacks should have guns so that when the
man comes to your door you could blow him away. Whites
have been committing genocide for 400 years and now
the Blackman is beginning to fight back. White education
is meant only to use, control and corrupt Black youth
and foil their minds. After Black youths are under
control, then the whiteman will move on Black adults.

HAMPTON, noting several white adults in the
audience, asked them, in obscene terms, what they were
doing at a Black meeting. An elderly white woman, in
tears, stated she and her friends meant no harm and were
just trying to be helpful. The crowd, practically all
of Negro race, appeared stunned by HAMPTON’s statement

to the whites.

headquartered at 360-362 Nelson Street, S. W., Atlanta, Georgia,
ig a nonmeabership organization, which was born out of the

: sit-in movement that erupted across the South beginning

in 1960.

Today SNCC identifies itself as an organization in
the revolutionary vanguard. It advocates that to be successful
it is necessary to develop a revolutionary ideology and
revolutionary progran. 7

According to SHCC the year 1967 marked a historic
milestone in the struggle for the liberation of black people
in the United States and the year thet revolutionaries
throughout the world bagan to understand more fully the impaet
of the black movement. SNCC declared that “liberation will
come only when there is final destruction of this mad octopus—-—
the capitalistic system of the United States with all its
life-sucking tentacles of exploitation and racism that choke
the people of Africa, Asia, and Latin America. The realities
of black life, together with the recognition instilled in SNCC
workers forced its members to further popularize the legitimacy
of self-defense and rebellions when oppression became too great.”

From May, 1966, until May, 1967, Stokely Carmichael
was National Chairman of SNCC. As of July, 1968, Carmichael
resided in Washington, D. C., where he was affiliated with
SNCC and active as temporary chairman of a black coalition
group. In May, 1967, Carmichael was replaced by Hubert Geroid
Brown, commonly known as HH, Rap Brown, who served until

In June, 1968, at tne Staff and Central Committee
meeting of SNCC held in Atlanta, Georgia, it was decided to
restructure the organization by equalization of responsibility
by creating ten deputy-or vice chairmanships. The-primary 7
purpose for this change is to take law enforcement pressure off

YOUNG SOCIALIST ALLIANCE-CHICAGO

A source advised in late November, 1959, that the
Young Socialist Alliance-Chicago (YSA-C), formerly known as
Young Socialist Supporters, had its origin in a series of
informal discussions held in Chicago prior to June, 1959,
among individuals who were close to the Socialist Workers
Party (SWP).

The YSA-C as of November, 1959, proclaimed itself
to be a city-wide revolutionary youth organization designed
to build socialism in America and aimed toward youth on
college campuses in the Chicago area and as being independent
of all adult groupings.

According to a second source in April, 1968, the
“YSA-C was considered the youth group of the Chicago Branch
SWP and affiliated with the national organization of the YSA
in New York. The YSA-C officers as of April, 1968, were
current members of the Chicago SWP,

The SWP has been designated pursuant to Executive
Order 10450.

slaughter in connection with the killing of an Oakland police officer.

The official newspaper, "The Black Panther," which further
describes itself as the "Black Community News Service," states that the
BPP advocates the use of guns and ¢ucrrilla tactics in its revolutionary
program to end oppression of the black peuple. Residents of the black
community are urged to arm themselves against the police who are con-
sistently referred to in the publication as "pigs" who should be killed.

“The Black Panther" issue of September 7, 1968, contains an
editorial by BPP Minister of Education, George Mason Murray, which
ends with the following:

"Black men. Black people, colored persons of America,
revolt everywhere! Arm yourselves, The only culture worth keeping
is a revolutionary culture. Change. Freedom everywhere. Dynamite!
Black Power. Use the gun. Kill the pigs everywhere."

Included in the introduction lo an article appearing in the +
October 5, 1968, edition of "The Black Panther" is the statement, "...
we will not dissent from American Government. We will overthrow it."

Issues of ''The Black Panther" regularly contain quotations
from the writings of Chairman MAO Tsc-tung of the People's Republic
of China and feature MAO's statement that "polilical power grows out of
the barrel of a gun."-

The nationa] headquarters of the BPP is located at 3106 Shattuck
Avenue, Berkeley, California. Branches have been established at
various locations throughout the United States.

as evidence the numerous raids on the BPP Offices throughout
the United States,

Artie Seale, the wife of Bobby Seale, read a state-—
ment to the group that was inaudible.

Allen Holmes, also known as Omar, was observed by

The above rally was dismissed without incident.

On October 10, 1969, FBI Agents observed 20 to 25
hippie-type individuals passing out leaflets in front of
the Cook County Hospital, 1835 West Harrison Street, Chicago.
The leaflets indicated a rally would be held that date at
the hospital, sponsored by the Revolutionary Youth Movement

“I (RYM II) faction of SDS, Young Lords and the BPP.

- The demonstration occurred about 2:30 p.m., and
Lynn French, a Chicago BPP member, addressed the group;
saying the BPP could perform a better service for indigent o
people in the ghettos instead of the Cook County Hospital,
if they (BPP) were allowed to operate a day caxe and health
center. The crowd meeting at the Cook County Hospital was
orderly and at the conclusion of the rally, the Baise dis-
persed without incident,

have all advised during the
early part of October, 1969, that a coalition does in ct
exist between the BPP, the Young Lords and the Young Patriots,
a white youth gang of displaced southerners, and RYM Ii faction
of SDS. RYM II faction of SDS is led by Mike Klonsky, former
National Secretary of SDS. All sources felt the coalition
existed and would continue to exist only as long as the BPP
felt that it could receive some benefits from such a coalition,
Sources felt that the coalition had deteriorated because of
the refusal of the BPP to engage in any activity with these
other groups unless the BPP was benofited.

MEETING OF WEST SUBURBAN CIVIL

WELFARE AT FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH,
2114 MAIN STREET, MELROSE PARK,
ILLINOIS, OCTOBER 14, 2969

A characterization of the Black Panther Party (3PP)

is attached in the appendix pages.
oo

ae On October 16, 1969, the current issue of "The

Proviso Herald", a weekly newspaper, distributed in the
Maywood, Illinois area, carried an article entitled,
"Hampton, Graham, blast Poverty Bias", which reads as follows:

‘Thirty-nine years ago, the Melrose Park village
board denied the request of a group of black residents
to build a church within the village, claiming it would
attract "the colored element from Maywood and Chicago.*

Last Tuesday, Proviso area blacks met in the First
Bapstist church of Melrose Park, a Negro church, to
discuss other “problems of* black people in the suburbs.’

The small crowd (about 35 or 40) ranged from in-
tense Black Panthers with high and wide Afro haircuts
to middle aged suburban couples.

Fred Hampton, chairman of the Illinois Black
Panthers, was scheduled to appear along with the
Rev. George Clements; Dr, Charles Hurst, dean of
Malcolm X college; and Bill Graham of Maywood's
Human Relations commission.

Hurst and Clements didn't show, so Graham led
off with a multi-pronged attack on what the federal
“and local government is and is not doing.

nt He blasted the proposed family planning pro-
gram, saying that the bill, ‘which is not yet safe,
is going to be shoved down our throats.'

‘When genocide can be forced upon us, there
is some question as to the sanity of a system that
would allow this,' he said.

Graham, calmly but angrily, called the elementary
schools in dist. 89 'a network of failure factories,’
and high school dist, 209 'racist oriented.'

He also cited poor housing for low and low middle
income families where ‘rats play hopscotch with a dead
roach,’ and'a welfare system where recipients have to
storm the welfare office to get what they're entitled
to on paper,'

Ron Satchel, health minister of the Illinois
Black Panthers, gave a brief talk on the organiza-
tion's free breakfast program and free health care
center,

He also scored family planning, saying that
‘increasing population isn't the problem, but the
maldistribution of food,’

But it was Fred Hampston who dominated the
meeting. With the skill of a practiced surgeon,
he dissected mid-twentieth century American society.

7 ‘Facism is what we have in this country today,
3 she heatedly began, ‘and there are three integral
parts; the avaricious businessman, the demagogic
politician, and the racist pig dog policeman.'

a Hampston, embattled in the courts on assault
charges, said one of the worst dangers for blacks
is their belief in the white power structure's

! "false values.'

i ‘Athletics and entertainment are the biggest
form of exploitation there is,' he cried, blasting
the likes of Wilt Chamberlain and singer James Brown
as helping to perpetuate a dangerous myth,

segue ‘*Hell, with all this work to be done, we got
A no time for playing.'

The Panther chairman said that everyone has
the right to defend himself, so if people don't
want the Panthers to have guns, all guns should
be thrown in the ocean and not turned in to Chicago
police sup. James Conlisk 'so that he can sell
them,’ :

'When you mix explosive chemicals and put
them in a keg,' he continued, ‘you can march
; around it, picket it, slap petitions on it, but
7 it’s still explosive. You have to get inside at
the chemicals, the cause,'

Hampton said he knew his theories weren't
7 very popular. .

TBut look, I'm 21, if you think that it has

' all happened in 21 years and that I did it, then

‘ you should take me out and shoot me. But ‘you and
I know these situations have been around for a
long time, and the only people who can change any-—
thing is us, the people.'

On October 2, 1969, a fourth source, who previously
furnished information concerning a discussion by unidentified
persons on September 30, 1969, at the SDS National Office,
Chicago, regarding placement of a bomb in the Federal Building,
Chicago, was unable to identify photographs of SDS Natiorl
Officers or other leading SDS activities as participants
in the discussion concerning the Federal Building bomb plan.

The fourth source did advise that the bomb
discussion was originated as a result of discussion concerning
the specific action intended by SDS, Weatherman Faction, for the
October 10, 1969 activities of that faction called "Attack on
the Courts."" The fourth source stated the original discussion
concerning the Federal Bomb Plan did not specifically concern
the trial being conducted in the building regarding "The
Conspiracy 8" defendants. The bomb plan outlined was directed
to the general SDS plans on October 10, 1969, for their
advertised "Attack on the Courts," 7

At 7:00 p.m. on October 3, 1969, a fifth sourc?
reported that persons occupying office mace, consisting of
four rooms on -the forth floor at 28 East Jackson Boulevard,
Chicago, under the name of "The conspiracy” have placed sheet
steel behind the glass door entrance to that office space.
"The Conspiracy" is an exclusive organization composed of
eight individuals who refer to themselves as the “Conspiracy
8" indicted during March,1969, by the Federal Grand Jury,
at Chicago, for conspiring to violate the ARL of 1968 as a
result of their-individual activities during the violent
confrontations which accompanied the DNC during August, 1968,
in Chicago. The organization was formed for the purpose of
soliciting funds for the legal defense of the eight individuals
indicted and to plan activities to be carried out for the
purpose of calling world wide attention to the trial.

one of the occupants of "The Conspiracy" office space
state,"Looks like the dirty pigs got in here last night.”
The fifth source also reported personally observing from
an adjacent room approximately 100 quart bottles filled
with an unidentified liquid. The bottles were not capped
did not have an odor and no wicksar other materials were
noted associated with them. The bottles were sitting on
the floor and on two eight foot tables in the room. Source
stated based on such a brief observation, a speculation
could not be made as to whether the bottles were incendiary
devices.

The trial of "The Conspiracy 8" reconvened
at 10:05 a.m. on October 3, 1969, in United States District
Court, Federal Building, Chicago. No disturbances or
unusual incidents occurred during trial proceedinys.

During the morning session the Defense conducted
eross examination of a Chicago Police Sergeant Robert Murray
regarding his testimony concerning observations in Lincoln
Park during the 1968 DNC activities. To offset Sergeant
Murray's testimony, Defense brought in to the court room a
simflar appearing white male, wearing a motorcycle helmet
in an effort to confuse Murray's testimony as to his identifying
Jerry Rubin's, a: ©* tne trial defendants, activity in
Lincoln Park. Defense raised objections to testimony of
other police officer witnesses claiming their testimony in
surveiling the tral defendants violates the defendant's
constitutional rights of privacy. Court recessed on

On October 7, 1969, Richard Elrod, Assistant
Corporation Concil, City of Chicago, advised he was contacted
on October 6, 1969, by Mark Kadish, who identified himself
as an attorney, and stated he wanted to represent the demon—
strators who would participate in the Weatherman and RYM II
SDS factions, October 8 through ll, 1969, activity scheduled
to occur in Chicago.

Kadish advised on this occasion that he and 20
other attorneys, including 10 from Ohio and 10 trom Wisconsin,
*desired to be notified when demonstrators were arrested.
Kadish was advised by City of Chicago court officials that
.any arrests that might be made would involve individuals,
not organizations, and that any request for an attorney
would have to be made on an individual basis by the persons
arrested. Kadish was further advised in the event those
arrested desired an attorney they would, of course, be
permitted to have one. Kadish was told that he and his
group would not, however, be allowed to assume legal repre-
sentation for demonstrators who might be arrested.on a
mass basis. 7

Elrod further advised that Kadish requested that
permits be granted so that SDS demonstrations ‘could take
place on the dates indicated at the following locations:

and cross-examination by defense attorneys. The defense
again raised the question of unauthorized police surveillances

MILITARY TRAINING SCHEDULE

A four week mandatory class for all members (‘fuesday,
Thursday and Sunday) with the exclusion of all non-members. Two
classes should be conducted by a small military staff, classes
conducted expressing party ideology, and stressing military
discipline at all times! Upon the entering of the classroom of

- the military instructor all talking should cease and all trainers

should take a firm attentative standing position and remain in
this manner until given the order to be seated. All classes

er class activities should begin with: All Power the People

and victory to the People's Revolution. The main purpose of the
class is to give every party member a hasic practical knowledge
of the military phase of the Peoples' struggle. There should be
no absenteeism from the Political Education Classes (no excuses),
reason being a military mind without a people's ideology is a
hired Willer and the peoplé don't need no more pigs. Classes
should be conducted in an orderly manner at all times.

STRUCTURE OF THE CLASSES

“I, Discipline

A. Discipline is the exact execution of orders resulting
from an intelligent, willing obedience rather than one
based solely upon habit or fear. Discipline is necessary
to secure orderly action which alone can triumph over
the seemingly impossible conditions of battle. The party
members mu: t be able to recognize and face fear because
fear is the enemy of discipline. Fear unchecked will
lead to panic and a unit that panics is no longer a
discipline unit but a mob, There is no sane person who
is without fear, but with good discipline and high morale
all can face danger. Punishment of individual members for
breacher of discipline is sometimes necessary, but only
to reform or @liminate those who are unfit to serve the

. People's Revolution.

c) 8 Points of Attention

Military Respect

Correcting the false idea that there is a contradiction
between military and political ideology.

Teaching that the People's Liberation Army cannot
exist without the people, the people have nothing
without a socialist ideology, so the peopla is
socialist ideology, the People's Liberation Army must
have a socialist ideology in order to relate to the
people, if its to serve the people as their military
arm.

i Society (BDS), as ji is known today, came into being at a founding

‘ convention held at Port Huron, Michigan, in June, i962. From an
initial ideological posture of "participatory democracy," the current
line of the national leadership reveals an adherence to Marxism-Leninism.
Michael Kionsky, National Secretary, in March, 1968, calied for the
puilding of a revolutionary Marxist-Leninist movement, The program
of SDS has moved from involvement in civil rights struggles to a1 anti-
Vietnam war position and finally to its present advocacy of an in i-~
imperialist line, linking up the oppressed peoples of Asia, Afric: and
Latin America with the black liberation movement in the United States.
China, Vietnam and Cuba are regarded as countries which are liading
the world-wide struggles against United States imperialism. On the
other hand, SDS regards the Soviet Union as an imperialist powe - and
does not support the policies of that country.

SDS maintains a National Office in Room 206, 1608 West
Madison Street, Chicago, Nncis. Its official paper "New Left Notes"
reflects the line of the national leadership and program adopted at
meetings of the National Council and National Interim Cammittee
(NIC), Three national officers and a NIC of eleven members are
elected each year during a June National Convention.

OT'S PROGRAM

YOUNG PA

, CLASS
We see that the key to truly understanding and improving our situation
4s to truly understend the nature of class society, We see that in
America and in the world that those who have money, control those who

‘do not. WEALTH-Foti

We feel that the wealth of the world should

be shared equally emong ell people. The workers or the masses of
the people produce the wealth and they should control it. We see
‘that our ellies are those who have nothing and our enemies are those
who have too much, .
WELFARE OF THE PEOPLE
We believe that all people are entitled to adequate food, clothing,
shelter and medical care. We believe that businessmen should not make
a profit on the things that we need to survive. We demand decent and
- adequate housing at a low cost for poor people. We demand safe,
Clean day care centers for mothers wno work, We demand that mothers
who went to raise their children in their own home be paid for this
wital work.
PIGS & PIG POWER STRUCTURE 2
“We demand the end to the pigs murdering and brutalizing our people.
The pigs are the tool of the rich man. The pigs are in our community
to protect the property of ‘pobber-baron landlords and avaricious
businessmen and not the lives or the interests of the people who
: Live in the community. We call the police pigs because they oppress

“hy “SCHOOLS -. SDUCATION

te heceehichebeas that thé mein purpose of the educational systen as it

gow ow stends is: to make people fit smoothly into the capitalistic class

society, We understand that the children of poor people are trained
to be “poor people--the children of factory workers are trained to
work in factories--the children of rich peupTe are trained. to take
their parents places, The present educational system is irrelevant

’_ eo the true needs and desires of the people, The schools are run

.i4ke prisons because this society is a prison, We demand that all -

people know their true history. We demand that ell people have the

-, opportunity to develop thejr abilities,

We oppose the draft because it means poor and working class men fighting

rich mens wars. We oppose imperialistic vars of agression.such as the one-

re

in Viet Nam. We believe that all patriotic men and women should serve only — i

An the army of liberation. Rich people can buy their way out of the draft,

* but poor and working class people have no choice, eWe demand that the old

stey home and construct a new society.
6. UNION

Labor unions are a good thing. But we still know that the majority of

faervicans work long hours under bad conditions for ‘poor wages and never

‘ave nothing to show for it. We demand an end to discrimination on the
job and in the unton, Men and women of all races should get equal wages and

better working conditions. mS

We understand that the businessmen in the community meke their living off
ofus, We understand that we make the products that they sell back to us.
We demand that if businessmen intend to stay in the community they treat us
as brothers and do not cheat us by charging prices we can't afford. We
-demand thet if businessmen make profits in the community, these profits be
dnvested in the community in the form of goods and services.

B. RACISM

Racism is a tool of capitalism to make people fight emong themselves,

instead of fighting together for their freedom. Divisions of race and sex
: serve the interests ‘of the rich, ruling class and not of the people.
fet 9. RELEASE ALL POLITICAL PRISONERS
We demand the release of all political prisoners. We understand that the
: majority of so-called "criminals" in our concentration-canp prisons are
victims _of our class society. Justice is a luxury that only.rich men can

afford,. These people should be released to build a new society rather

than hidden away for society's mistakes.

20. CULTURAL NATIONALISM
. We believe that to fight only for the interests of your close cultural_
brothers and sisters is not in the interest of all the people, and in fact

perpetuates racism. All power to the poor and working people! Culturél

‘ mationalism does not solve the politicel problems of the oppressed people,

t — but only perpetuates exploitations - capitalism makes millions on love beads,

afro-shirts, and cowboy hats, Cultural nationalism is a tool of capitalist

Revolutionary solidarity with all oppressed peoples of all countries and
races defeats the divisions created by the narrow interests of cultural

Monopoly capitalism and corrupt Russian-socialism are enemies of the

interests of the oppressed people throughout the world.

On Ssptember 18, 1969, when Special Agents (SAs) .
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) were conducting i
a neighborhood investigation, Mrs. WILLIAM FESPERMAN, wife
o2 the then leader of the Young Patriots answered a door
and when interviewed furnished the following information:

The YP has three main programs. The first is a
"free Pantry Program" which operates out of the Patriot's
Office and yntil that time, September1@ , 1969, had fed
420 people. There is a proposed medical clinic which was
- geheduled to open before the end of 1969, At that time, an
alternate school was being run by the Patriots in which Mrs. Hl
FESPERMAN was a teacher. The school had an enroliment of i
fourteen children. :

Hrs, FESPERMAN stated that the group is net prone 4
“9 violence and that their idea of violence was similar to that 1
@2 the BPP, They would not attack anyone but if they were 7 Hl
yietimized by police brutality, they would defend themselves.
Hes, FESPERMAN declined to furnish any other information
teyarding the YP.

The YP are attempting to organize the people of
the Uptown area of Chicago. Once the people are organized,
thay intend to use their vote in local elections in order
to defeat the building of high rise apartments in’ the Uptown
area of Chicago and force absentee landlords to rebuild the
area, The main unifying force of the YP is their belief that
they are victims of pelice brutality. Although very few of
tha youths within the group have ever bsen arrested, and none t
of their leaders have ever been arrested, they claim they are i
genstantly stopped on the street, searched and harrassed by
the police.

* -¥ou SPENT $62.57 ON FORKIGN sID LiSf YEsaR! WHaT. HaS IT DONE FOR YOU"

Am example of what happened to your tax money:

Yn 1965, Four American students visited Guatemala. They made a point
of interviewing an official of the U.S, agency for International
Development (aID), which handles most U.S. foreign aid. The AID
gonges $ 2,300,000,000 from U.S. taxpayers each year. The students
were interested in what we pet in return.

One of the students asked the aID man what sort of things were being
done to help the Guatemalan people. The official replied, "Well,
actually that's not our direct responsibility. You see, the real
purpose of aID is to open up this country to american business in-
vestment." The students were shocked, but the A7D man went on to
tell them why he thought this was a good thing. Fointing to a con-
struction site, he said, "See that housing project? We got a U.S.
construction company to come down here and build low cost housing
units for local workers and their familias." —

One of the students asked the man, "How much do you charge for one?”
AID man: "$2,500 altogether, but that's in small monthly payments."
Student: "How much does it cost to build one?”

AID man: “Well, the companies have to make a profit .. e
Student: "Come on, how much?”

AID man: "about $800 a piece.”

”

What has happened here?

& U.S. taxpayer is milked of $800. The government gives the money
to AID, which turns it over to an american construction company.
Now the stuffed-shirt businessman who gets this money goes down to
Guatemala, hires workers there for 30¢ an hour to build a house,
and then charges these workers $2,500 to live in it.-.

Tis has happened: 1 The american working man is conned out of money

2a Guatemalan worker is forced to work for
starvation wages, mortgages his life away for
a home, and begins to hate the U.S. for screwir
him and his country

3 a rich businessman who owns an international
construction company makes $1,700 clear, tax
free profit while undertaking no risk and
investing almost no money.

Why does this happen?

ince Government dominates small foreign countries to serve the

nocd of the very rich, the small class of hogs that actually runs
this country. ‘he workire people ot the entire world are bled by
this ruling class: That is why they revolt in Cuba, Vietnam,

Bolivia, and Guatemala, and that is why they say, "Yankee go home!"

Who does it help?
Owners of big businesses—- banks, factories, chain stores,

What are these peuple called?

How many capitalists are there?
Damn few. The richest 1% owns 76% of all stock, The top

What does that mean to us?
Since these rich pigs have the money, they can say where
it goes, who gets it, and how much they get.-_

What are the results of this?

i out of 3 Americans is underfed.

Not enough schools.

Not enough houses.

Not enongh medical care.

ftoLken air and poisoned water.

Wars that kill our youth, widow our women, and turn half
the world appiust us: Vietnam. Korea. Dominican kepublic.

Why do we blame the capitalists? .

Took who holds the power in this country. Look where our
"leaders" spend our money. These multi~millionaires made
their fortunes off other men's sweat and labor. They

didn't give a damn about us then, when they took the profits.
They don't share the wealth that we produced. They make

the decisions; we do the work and pay the taxes.

Something must be done. The Young Patriots Organization is
about oing it. A11 Tower to the reople!

BLACK PANTHER PARTY, Also
Knoyn As Black Panther Party
pon Sets b= sensei

According to its official newspaper, the black Panther
Party (BPP) was started during December, 1966, ‘in Oakland,
California, to organize black people so they can take control
of the life, politics and the destiny of the black community.
it was organized by BOBBY SEALL, BPP Chairmen, and HUEY PR,
NEYTON, BPP Minister of Defense, NEWTON was sentenced in 1968
to serve 2 to 15 years after being convicted of manslaughter
in connection with the killing of an Oakland police officer.

: The official newspaper, "The Black Panther," which
further describes itself? as the “Black Community News Service,"
states that the BPP advocates the use of guns und guerrilla
tactics in its revolutionary program to end oppression of the
Dlack people, Residents of the black community are urged to
arm themselves against the police who are consistently referred
to in the publication as “pigs” who should be killed.

‘ne Black Panther’ issue of September 7, 1968, contains
an editorial by BPP Minister of Education, GEORGE MASON MURRAY,
vhnich ends with the following:

“Black men, Bluck people, cclored persons of
america, revolt everywhere! Arm yourselves, The only culture
worth keeping is a revolutionary culture. Change. Freedom
everyvbere, Dynamite! Black Power. Use the gun, Kill the
pigs everywhere,” 7

Included in the introduction to an article appearing
in the October 5, 1958, edition of ‘The Black Panther" is the
statement “....ve will not dissent from American Government,
We will overthrow it."

issues of "The Black Panther’! regularly contain
quotations from the writings of Chairman Mao Tse-tung of the
People's Republic of China and feature Mao's statement that
"political power grows out of the barrel of a gun."

The national headquarters of the BPP is located at
3166 Shattuck Avenue, Berketey, California. Branches have

. Democratie-Sucirety (SDS), as at
“being at a founding convention } d at Port Wuron, Michi-van,

in June, 1962. From an initial ideoluyical posture of

“participatory democracy," the current line of the national

leadership reveais an adheruvnce tu Marxism-Leninism,

MICHAEL .KLONSKY, National Secretary, in March, 1969, valled

for the building ot a revolutionary Marxist-Leninist movement.

The. program of SDS has moved from involvement in civil rights
struggles to an anti-Yietnam war positioun and finally to
ts present advocacy of an anti-imperialist Line, Linking

up the oppressed peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America

with the black liberation movement in the United States.

China, Yietnam and Cuba are regarded as countries which are
_isading the world-wide strupyles against United States imperial~
‘ism. Oa the other hand, SDS revards the Soviet Unzron as

an imperialist power and docs not support the-polices of

“New Left Notes" reflects the line of the national lead hip

“National Interim Committee (NiC). Three national officers

for, harboring a fugitive from justice, in building occunied by
an organization calling themselves the Black Panthersa Special
Agent in Charge MARLIN W. JOHNSON of the Citicago Federal Bureau
of InVestigation office instructed SA STRATTON: to conduct
a lawful search of the building in which Ske iarrests were made,
with assistance of other Special Agents of the FBI,

Posters, pamphlets, printed material and machines
were observed on the walls, floors, desks aid chairs and it
appeared to SA STRATTON that these items would be subject
te seizure under a search warrant issued im conformance with
Rule 41 (b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure in
conjunction with violations of Title 18, U.S. Codey Sections
2383, 2384 and 2385, e

Section 2383 relates to rebellian or insurrection
against the authority of the United States ar the laws thereof
- or in gfving aid and comfort thereto.

"  Seetion 22Rb wélates te con

put down, or to destroy by force the Goverment of the United
States, cr to levy war against them, or to @p;ose by force
the authority thereof, or by force to prevent, hinder, or
delay the execution of dhy paw of the United States, etc.

Section 2385 relates to willfully advocating, etce
the overthrow of the Government of the United States and
the printing, etc. of material, and the orgmizing, etc. of
persons for such purposese

5 SA STRATTON therefore directed tat certain
materials be seized and preserved as evidence of violations of
laws of the United States, possibly being ceumitged in presence
of Agents, both as mere evidence and as material designed
or intended for use or wnich is or has beenused as means of
committing a criminal offense (Rule 41 (b)) md material that

seeueeet it

del conducting this search, the following matters
were considered?
: The arresta were completed between approximaté ly
5:30 aem. and 6:00 a.m. and it would not be possible-to
prepare detailed affidavits for search warrant and appear
before the U.S. Commissioner or a District Court judge
for several hourss .

‘ The building had been prepared with electrical
devices and with solid steel doors and iron doors and bars
placed over entrances, exits and windows, thusly preventing
any entrance without breaking and entering and with
use of firearms, Several weapons were present an@ seized
and it is known to Agents that this organization calling
themselves the Black Panthers has consistently stated that
attempt-to search or to effect arrests would be plete ety
resisted, even with fireartis. :

> 2.

That ‘attempts nh “enter the buiLaing nad wet wlth
no co-operation of any kind from persons in the building,
and any future ‘attempts to enter would. undoubtedly. be met
in the same way, necessitating an armed force sufficient
to effect the execution offa search warrant, thus making
it impractical, to obtain and effect a search by warrant
on the same day. 7

Lila ihood ‘of “destruction of evidence and removal
of evidence while the paperwork necessary for a search
by search warrant was being accomplished and filed.

Tenseness of the general neighborhood due to
prior racial disorders. : *

a "TU LINOIS BLACK PANTHER PARTY PLATFORM AND PROGRAM

cea 1. WE: ae FREEDOM, WE WANT POWER TO DETERMINE THY DESTINY
OF OUR BLACK COMMUNETY
We believe that black people will toe be free until we
are able to determine our destiny.

2. WE WANT FULL SMPLOYMENT -FOR OUR PEOPLE,

We believe that the federal government is responsible
and obligated to give every man employment or a
guaranteed income. We believe that if the white
american businessmen will not give full employment, then
the means of production should be taken fuom the
businessmen and placed in the community so that the
people of the community can organize and employ all

eof its people and give a high standard of living.

3. “WE WANT AN END TO, THE ROBBERY BY SHE WHITE pAN OF OUR

> PLAOY COMMUNTTY |

“We believe that this racist government has robbed us

and now we are demanding the overdue debt of forty

acres and two milleg. Forty acres and two mules was
promised 100 years<“ago as restitution for slave labor
and mass murder of black people. "We will accept the
payment in currency Which will be distributed to our
many communities. The Germans murdered six million Jews.
The american racist has taken part in the slaughter of
over fifty million black people; therefore, we feel that
this is a modest demand that we make.

4... WE WANT DECENT HOUSING, FIT. FOR SHELTER OF HUMAN REINGS.

We believe that if the white landlords will not give
decent housing to our black community, then the
housing and land should be made into cooperatives so
that our community, with government aid, can build
and make decent housing for its people. ad

5. WE WANT EDUCATION FOR OUR PEOPLE THAT EXPOSES THE
TRUE NATURE OF THIS DECADENT AMERICAN SOCIETY. WR

OUR ROLE IN THIS PRESENT DAY SOCIETY.

We believe in an educational system that will give
to our people a knowledge of self. If a man does not
have Knowledge of himself and his position in society
and the world, then he has little chance to relate

to anything else. . 7 a

We believe that black people should not be forced
to fight in the military service to defend a racist

“This is the ninth point of the Black Panther Party's*

How can a petty bourgeois banker understand how a

Black People are oppressed because we do not cemtrol

“COLLABORATING WITH THE ENEMY

a,

"The Government of the U.S. is trying desparately
‘ to maintain her domination over oppressed peoplés in
this pig society. One of her first tactics is to base
herself an official collaborators and reactionary
elements. These traitors-sons are Singled out, given
concessions, and placed on the national news media
to denounce the revolutionary movement and, the peoples.
aspirations for freedom. The govermment has made a
concensus of its loyal and faithful traitors-sons,
mobilized them to make declarations and condemnations
~on radio, TV, and in the papers to the effect of
denouncing the peoples' rights to,self-defense in-the
» face of brutal nie attacks. The *Biack Panthey Party
has uncovered this scheme to keep the peopie at the mercy
of tis vitious pig power structure. ‘We see this :
stepped-up campaign against the révelutionary peoples
party as an attempt to cut off the “sound” population
from the revolutiofiary body. The pig; power structure
knows that if the people follow the Black Panther Party,
they will be unable to exploit, oppress, and murder
us at will, These same traitors who denounced the
people's legal right to be free, endorse the cynical,
inhuman, deviate methods used to suppress the people.

i "The traitors-sons are helping the enemy pigs in
i ‘ their national propaganda scheme to promote black
capitalism, knowing from the start, tha® the resulting
black capitalism is neo-colonilism. These collaborators,
these black pigs, these white traiters are to be found
\ on national, state, and local levels. They can be found
' in Congress, in-pig Nixon's cabinet, in the supreme
court, in state legislative bodies, and in loeal arms of
national civil rights organizations.. They will tell
you that the pyoblem is economic an? social; that they
will vigorously try to solve the heasing question and end
poverty, knowing well that these problems will never be

solved as long as there is capitalism. They treat
tHe demand for national liberation as if it is-a
manifestation of social discontent. They move with
the illusions that their promises to improve living
conditions will be sufficient to bring back order and
peace. They misinterpret the peoples national con-
sciousness and ignore it in order to receive their.
concessions from the pigs. They are helping those
avaricious capitalist pigs run their con games on the
people. As long as these enemy pigs exist, the

power structure and their running dogs will use them
to point the masses in the wrong direction,

“The Black Panther Party will forever educate the
masses to their deviate tricks and they, *tco, will have
to face the wrath of the armed people. The Black
Panther Party, the beacon light to freedom, will show

the people how to resist the efforts of these collaborators,

WHOM IT MAY CONCERNED:

“You have no doubt heard about the Black Panther ae

Party. If you haven't, the Black Panther Party is the
vanguard party of the oppr« ed people. We have taken
upon ourselves the task of getting what the people
want, getting what the people need, getting what the
peuple deserve.

"In meeting the wants, needs and just rewaftis of the
people, we have initiated a Breakfast for School Children
Program which will be free to hungry children-~ children
who ‘fe to school without food in their stomachs: and,
a.Defense Fund for the many Brothers placed in jails and

ceac hecanse they have not receive@a fair aud jmpartial

“We, the Black Panther Party know that both these ~
causes are of such magnitude as to warrant the immediate
attention of the entir# community. We realize that its
hard enough to go to school, but for g child to have to
go to-school on an empty stomach is criminal. Criminal
.because some super rich capitalist won"t pay decent wages or
hire qualified people today to do a jom to make cnough
money to feed their children, At the same time we realize
the courts have been unjust and unconstitutional in their
handling of Black people brought before them. The pig
power structure in this country is focmsing it’s blood
thirsty attacks onthe Leaders of the BlackePanther Party
“in all states. It is most important that these leaders remain
among the people. They must be allowed to tell the truth
abdut this decadént system.

“We come to you, knowing you are fair and asking for
your support for these two worthy causes. We are asking
for donations of fgod for these hungry children and money
contributions for the Defense Fund. Your donation may be
gmall or Targe--it’will all be appreciimied. We of the
Black Panther Party thank you — your @onation if there igs one.

is not personally known by the masses, but yet the -aghion was
respected and followed by the people.

The Vangard Party must provide leadership for the people.

When the people rn thet it is no longer advantageous for then
to resist by going inte the streets in the activities of the
gurrijla warfare method, they will quickly follow this example.

&

But first; they must ri ct the party which is transmitting
ois message, When the Vanguard ‘group destorys the machinery of the
oppressor by dealing with him in small groups of three and for,
and then escapes the might of the oppressor by dealinethe masses
will adhere to this correct strategy. When the masses will
be overjoyed and hear that a gestpo potp police has been excuted

butqit is iuportant for the party toe show the people how to go

insufficient, many slave revolts occurred,

There are basically thre ways one can learn; Through study,
through observation, and through actual experience. The back

vanguard group first be activists, Without this knowledge of the b

one could not gain the fundamental knowsdge of the black revolution in racist
“America. t i

: s : 7

The main fuction of the party is to awaken the pcople and to teach them the
strategic icthod of resisting the power structure, which is preparcd not only to
combat the resistance of the people with massive krutality, but té totally ami~
hilate. the black commuyjity, the black population, :

, : ‘ .

If it is learned by the power structure that black pcople have"x" aaount of
gums in their possession, this will not stimulate the pouer structure to prepare
itself with guns, bevause At is already more than prepared,

The end result of this education will be positive. for Black people in their
reisitence and negative for the power structure in its oppressicn, because the
party alvays exemplifies revolutionary defiance, If the party is not going to
make the people aware of the tools of liberation and the st&htegic. hod that is
to be used, there will be no means by which the pcoplk will be mobilised properly.

The velationship between the vanguard party and the masses is a secondary
relationship. The relationship between the members of che vanguard party is a
primary relationship. It is important that the m@mbers of thg vgnguard group
maintain a face-toface- relationShip with each other, ‘his is important if th
party m nmery is te te effective, It is impossible to put icpgether fim
party machinery or‘programs without this direct rel. rip, The member
vanguard group should be tes&éed revolutionaries, This will mininize the dan
of Uncle Tom informers and opporgunists, 7

&

The main purpose of vangiard group shoul. be to raise the coi:
the masscs throuyh educaticnal programs and certain physical activist:

the masses must know that the party exists. The party must use all means
availavle to get this information across to the masses. If the masses do not
have knowledge of the party, it will be impossible for the masses to follow
the program of the, party. :

The vanguard party is never underground in the beginning of its existcnce,
because this would limit its effectiveness and educatior rocesses, How cen you

above ground as long as thedog power structure will allow, ard hoffe fully when the
party is forced to go underground the mes of the party will already have been
put ‘across to the people. The vanguard party's activities on the surface will
necessarily be shortlived,

STUDENTS FOR A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY

A source has advised that the Students for a Democratic
Society (SDS), as it is known today, came into being at a founding
convention held at Port Huron, Michigan, in June, 19¢2. From an
initial ideological posture of "participatory democracy," the current
line of the national leadership reveals an adherence to Marxism-Leninism.
Mickael Klonsky, National Secretary, in March, 1969, called for the
building of a revolutionary Marxist-Leninist movement. The program
of SDS has moved from involvement in civil rights strugéles ta an anti-
m war position and finally to its present advocacy of an anti-
ailst line, linking up the oppressed peoples’ of Asia, Africa and
Latin America with the black liberation movement in the United States.
China,. Vietnam and Ciba gre regarded as countries which are leading
the world-wide struggles against United Statgs imperialism. On the
other hand, SDS regards the Soviet Union as an imperialist power and~
does not support the policies of that country.

SDS maintains a National Office in Room 206, 1608: West
Madison Street, Chicago, Illinois. Its official paper "New Left Notes"
reflects the line of the national leadership and program adopted at
meetings of the National Council and National Interim Committee
(NIC). Three national officers and a NIC of eleven members are
‘elected each year during a June National Convention.

SDS Regional Offices and university and college chapters
elect delegates to National Council meetings wherein program and
ideology are debated, but each Region and chapter is autonomous in
nature and is free to carry out independent policy and programs
reflective of local conditions.

. 7 e, : +.

The Student Honviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC),,
headquartered at 360-362 Nelson Street, S. ¥., Atlanta, Georgia,
ig a nonmembership organization, which yas born out of the

1 8it-in movement that erupted across the South beginning
in 1960.

Today SNCC identifies itself as an organization in
the revolutionary vanguard. It advocates that to be successful
it is necessary to develop a revolutionary ideojogy and
revolutionary program.

t According to SNCC the year 1967 marked a historic
- mile@tone in the struggle for the liberation of black people
in the United States and the year that revolutionaries
throughout the world began to understand more fublw the impaet
. of the black movement. SNCC declared that "liberation will
ie come only when there is final destruction of this mad octopus--
the capitali&tic system of the United States with all its
life-sucking tentacles of exploitation and racism that choke
the people of Africa, Asia, and Latin America. The realities
ef black lifs, together with the recogrrition instilled in SKNCC
workers forced its members to further popularize the legitimacy
of self-defense and rebellions when oppression became too great."

From Hay, 1966, until May, 1967, Stokely Carmichael
was Ndtiop#21 Chairman of SXCC. As of July, 1968, Carmichael
resided in Washington, D, C., where he was affiliated with
SNCC and active as temporary chairman of a black coalition
group. In May, 1967, Carmichael was replaced*by Hubert Geroid
Brown, commonly known as H. Rap Brown, who served until
June, 1968.

q

In June, 1968, at the “Staff and Central Committee
meeting of SNCC held in Atlanta, Georgia, it was de@ided to
restructure the organization by equalization of responsibility
by creating ten deputy-or vice chnirmanships. The primary: ~
purpose for this change is to take law enforcement pressure off
any Single individual.

A source advised in May, 1968, that the Chicago
Branch of SNCC was an affiliate of the national SNCC with
headquarters located -in Atlanta, Georgia. It was a non-
membership type group headed in Chicago by ROBERT ALFONZO
BROWN, a 19 year old male Negro, with the title of Midwest
Region Director. BROWN maintained strict loyalty fo STOKELY
CARMICHAEL, Recruiter and Organizer and former National
Director of SNCC. BROWN attempted to align ChBagu's SNCC
, activities within the framework of CARMICHAEL's policies.

commented as follows:

MILITARY TRAINING SCHEDULE

7 A four week mandatory class for all members (Tuesday,

Thursday and Sunday) with the exclusion of all non-members.
Two classes should be conducted by a small military staff, clas;
conducted expressing party ideoloxy, and stressing military
discipline at all times. Example: Upon the entering of the class-
room of the military instructor, all talking should tease and all
trainees should take a firm attentive standing position, and 7
remain in this manner until given the order to be seated. ALL
classes og class activities should begin with: All power the
people and victory to the people's revolution. The main purpose
of the dass is to give every party member a*basic pragtical
knowiedge of the military phase ot the peoples! strugple. There
should be no absenteeism from the Political Education Classes
(no excuses), reason being a military mind without a people's
ideology is a hired killey,and the people don*t need no more pigs.
Classes should be conducted $n an orderly manner at all times.

eS

ie
Structure of the Classes

I. Discipline:

_ Discipline is the exact execution of orders resulting from an
intelligent, willing obedience, rather than one, based solely
upon habit or fear. Discipline is necessary to secure orderly
action which alone can triumph over the seentingly impossible
condition of battle. The party members must be able to recognize
and face fear because fear is the enemy of discipline. Fear
unchecked will léad to panic ane a unit that panics is no longer
a disciplined unit, but a mob. There is no saneperson who is
without fear, but with good discipline and high mowale all can
face danger. Punishment of individual members for breaches of
discipline are somelimes necessary, but only to reform or
eliminate those who*are unfit to serve the people's revolution.

THE MOVEMENT: The question of nation-
alism 1g a vital one in the black mave-
ment tolay. Sone have ciade a distinction
between cultural nationalism and revolu-
tlonary nationalism. Would you comment

gon the differences and «give us your
views?

HUEY P, NEWTON: There are two kinds
of nationalism, revolutionary nationalism
and reactlonary nationalism, Revolution-
ary nationalism ts first dependent upon
a people's revolution with the end yual
belng the people in power. Therefore
to be a revolutionary nationalist you
would by necessity have fo be a soctal-
ist. If you are a reactionary nationalist
you are not a socialist and your end
goal is the opnres ier of the neerty,

Cuhural nationalism, or pork chop
nationalism, as I sometimes call it, ts
basically a problem of having the wrong
political perspective, It seems to be a
reaction instead of responding to poll-
ti@al oppression. The cultural nationalists
are concerned with returning to the old
African culture and thereby regalaing
their identity and freedam Inather words,
they feel that the African culture’ will
automatically bring political freedom,
Many times cu}tural nationalists fall into
line as reactionary nationalists,

Papa Doc In Haitl Is ane excellent
example of reactionary nationalist. He
oppresses the people but le does promote
the African culture, He’s against anything
other then black, which on the surface
seems very good, but for him it Is only
to mislead the people. He merely kicked
out thé racists and replaced them with
himself as the oppressor. Many of the
nationalists in this country seem todesire
the same ends.

The Black Panther Party, which is a
revolutionary group of black people,
realizes that we have to have an identity,
We have to realize our black heritage
in order to give us strength to move
on and progress, But as far as returning

the old African culturr, it's unneces-
sary and it’s not advantageous in many
Tespects, We believe that culture itself
will not Hberate us. We're going to need

_ some stronger stuff.

Revolutionary Nationalism

A good example of revolutionary nation-
‘alism was the revolution in Algeria when
Ben Bella took over, The French were
icked out but it was a people's revolu-
\yion becaus2 the people ended. up in
power, The leaders that took over were
‘not interested in the profit motive where

’

NW 65360 Docld:32989647 Page 557

4 .

they could exploit the people and keep
them {na state of slavery, They nation-
alized the Industry and plowed the would-
be profits into the community, That's
what socialism ts all about in a nutshell
The people's representatives are inoffice
* strictly on the leave of the peuple. The
wealth of the country is controtled by the
people and, they are considered when-
ever modifitations in the industries are
made,
‘The Black Panther Party ts 2 revolu-
tlonary Nationalist group aud we see
a major contradiction between capitalism
in this country and our interests, We
realize that this country became very
rich upon slavery and that slavery 1s
capltalisin in the extreme, We have twe
to Hight, wabltadsm agd racism,
We must destroy both racist®and capi-
talism,

e

MOV Directly related to the
question of nattonalism is the question
of unity within the black community,
There has been some question about this
since the Bla@k Panther Party,has,run
wandidnts sain: vter unick cdnurcates
in recent California election: What is
your position on thas matter’

HUEY: Well a very peculiar thing nas
happened, Historically you got what Mal-
colm X calls the field nigger and the
house nigger. Ghe tause nigger had some
privileges, a little more. He got the
worn-out clothes «é the master and he
didn't have to work as hard as the field
black. He came to respect the master

to such an extent until he identitied with
the master because he got a few of the
leftovers that the fleld blacks did not
get, And through whis identity with him,
he saw the slavemaster's interest as
being his interest. Sometimes he would
even protect the slivemaster more than
the slavemaster would protect himself,
Malcolm makes ‘the point twat if the
master's house hajpened to cateh on fire
the house Negro sétl work harder than
the master to put te fre out and save
the master’s house, While the teld Negro,

+ the fleld blacks was praying that

house burned down, The house black
ddentificd with the master so much that
when the master would get sick the
house Negro woul! say, “Master, we's
sick!”

Black Bourgeoisie

The Black Panthe Party are the field
blacks, we're hoping the master dies if
he gets sick, ‘The 2ikek bourgroisir seem

to be acting in the role of the hot
‘They ary pro-admunistration,
like a few concessions made, but as far
as the overall setup, they have a litte
mgre material goods, a litle more ad-
vantage, a few more privileges than the
black have-nots; the lower And
so they identify with the power structure

and they see their Interests as the power
structure's Interest, In fact, 1's against
thelr interest,

The Black Panther Party, was forced
to draw a line of demarcation, We are
for all of those who are for the promo-
tion of the interests of the black have-

1 nots, which represents about 98% of blacks
here in America, We're not controlled
by the white mother country radicals
nor are we controlled by the black bour-
geoisie, We have a mind of cur own

i a itself with our complete program, then

our enemy, And they will be attacked
and treated as such.

HUEY: The wille mother country radical
is the offespring of the children of the

ploiting all peuple, concefitrating on the
people of color. These are children of
the beast that seck now to be redeemed
because they reallze that thelr former
heroes, who were slave masters and
murderers, put forth ideas that were
only facades to hide the treachery they
inflicted upon the world, ‘They are turn-
ing their backs on their fathers.
The white mother country radical,
in resisting the system, becomes some-
what of an abstract thing because he's
not oppressed as much as black people
are, As a matter of fact his oppression
is somewhat abstract simply because
he doesn’t have to live in a reality of

& __ Black people in America and colored

White Revolutionaries.

This presents somewhat of a problem
in many ways to the black revoiutionary
especially to the cultural nationalist, The
cultural madecalls! doesn't understand the
winte revolutionaries because he can’t
see why azyone white gyould turn on the
system, So they think That maybe this is
some more hypocrisy being planted by
white peopte,

1 personally think that there are many
young white revolutionaries who are sin-
cere in attempting to realign themselves
with magktad, and to make a reality out
of the Tigh moral standards t
andl forefathers only es

revolutionazies found the heroes in the
black colony at home and in the colonies
throughout tthe world,

‘The young white revolutionaries raised
the ery for te troops fo withdraw from

Vietnamghanis off Latin america, with-
draw from tie Dominican Kepublic and
also to withévaw from the black community
or the black eolony, So you havea situation
in which the young white revolutionarles
are attempting:to identify with the oppress-
ed people of the colonies and against the
exploiter.

The problam. arises thén in what part
they can play. How can they ald the col-
ony? How can they ald the Black Panther
Party or any other™black revolutionary
group? They can aid the black revolut-
jonaries tml by simply turning away
from the -exttblishment, and secondly
by choosing wletr friends. For instance,
they-have adlolce hetween whether they
will be a fia of Lyndon Baings John-
son or a fried of Fidel Castro, A friend
of Robert ‘Kennedy or a friend of Ho
Chi Minh, Ant these are direct opposites,
A Erlend .ofmine or a friend of Johnsons.
After they mae this choice then the white
revolutionatis, have a duty and a respon
sibility to act,

‘The imperialistic or capitalistic system

They occupy thém dy sending soldiers

policemen or soldiers are only a gun in

Ushment secure in its exploltation. The

s first problem it seems 4s to remove thes

there first is black unity, We haye a pro-
blem in the black colony that ts partieular
to the colony, but we're willing to accept
aid from the mother country as long,
mother country radicals cea
have, as Eldridge Cleaver says in SOUL
ON ICE, a inind of our own, We've re-
gained our mind that was taken away from

us and we will decide the political as well

as the practical stand Uat we'll take,
We'll make the theory and we'll carry
out the practice, It's the duty of the enol
revolutionary to aid us inthis,

$0 the role of the mother country radi-
cal, and he does have a role, Is to first
choose his friend and his enemy and
afler doing this, which It seems he's
already done, then to not only articulate
his desires to regain his moral standard
and align hitnself with hutnamty, but also
to put this into practice by attacking
the protectors of the Institutlons,

MOVEMENT: You have spoken a lot about
dealing with the protectors of the system,
the armed forces, Would you tke to elab-
orate on why you place so much emphasis
on this?

nue; ane reasons ual i deel reas
strongly about dealing with the protectors
of the system is simply because without
this protection from the army, the police
and the military,the institytions could not
go on in their racism and exploitation,
For {nstance, as the Vietniinese are
driving the American impertalist troops
out of Vietnam, it automatically stops
the racist imperialist institutions of A-
merica from oppressing that part{cular
country, The country cannot implement
its racist program without the guns, And

. the guns are the military and the police,

If the military were disarmed in Vietnam,
then the Vietnamese would be victorious,
We are in the same situation here in
America. Whenever we attack the system
the first thing the administrators do Is to
send out their strongarm men, If I's a
rent strike, because of the indecent housing
we have, they will send out the police to
throw the furniture out the window. They
don’t come themselves, "Chey send thetr
protectors, So to deal with the corrupt
exploiter you are going to have to deal
with his protector, which {is the police
who take orders from him, This isa must,

SNCC andliberals

HUEY: There was somewhat of an un-
healthy Mlagonship In the past with the
white liberdls supporting the black people
who were ‘nying to gain their freedom, 1
think that agpod example of this would be
the relatiombip that SNCC had with Its
white liberals, [ call them white liberals
because theydifier strictly from the white
radicals, ‘Tle relationship was that the
whites contilled SNCC for a very long
time, From the very start of SNCC until
here recently, whitgs were the mind of
SNCC. They controfled the program of
SNCC with money and they controlled the
ideology, or the stands SNCC would take,
‘The blacks:inSNCC were completely con-
trolled prograim-wise; they couldn't doany

The result was that the iead-rshiy of

the penis is part of the body, ‘The onit-
potent administrator laid down a decree
when he realized that his plan to enslave
the black map had a flaw, when be dis-
“covered that he had emasculated himself,
He attempted to bind the pems of the
slave, He -atlempted to show that his
pems coud reacn jure: wan ce super-
masculine menial's penis. He s
the omnipotent administrator ca
access to the black woman.” The si
masculine menial then hada psychological
attraction to the white w&man (the ultra
feminine freak) for the sine reas
that ft was forbidden fruit. The omnipotent
administrator decreed that this kind of
contact would be punished by death, At
the same time in order to reinforce his
sexual desire, to confirm, to assert his
manhood, he would go into the slave
and have sexual relations witt
vornen (the self-relant Amazon),
Not to be satisfied but simply io confirm
his manhood. Because tf he can only satisty
the self-reliant Amazon then he would be
sure that he was a man, Because he
doesn’t have a body, he doesn't have a
penis, he psychologically wants to castrate
the black man. The slave was constantly

& seeking unity within himself; a mind and

a body, He always wanted, to be able to
decide, to gain respect from his woman,
Because women want one who cancontrol,
1 give this gutline to fit Into a framework
of what is happening now. ‘The white
power structure today in america defines
itsel! as the nad, They want to control
the world: ‘They yo off and plunder the
world, ‘They are the polleemen of the
world exercising control especially over
people of color.

Re-capture the Mind

‘The white man cannot gainhis manhood,
cannot unite with the body because the
body is fick. The body 1g syyboit ot

thing as he views i.) The slave is in
2 TUCK betier sitbation because ms cit
being’ a full man has always oven viewed
psychologically, And it's always easier
to make a psychological transitien than
a biological one. iC he can only recapture
his mind,greeapture his balls, then he
will lose all fear and will be free te
determine his destiny, ‘This is what is
happening at tis time with the rebellion
of the world's oppressed people against
the controller, They are regaining their
mind and they're saying that we have a
mmmd of our own, ‘They're saying that we
want freedom to determine the destiny
of our people, thereby uniting the mind
with their bodies, ‘They are taking the
mind back from the Sinnipotent admunt-
strator, the controller, the exploiter.

In America black peuple are also chan-
ing that we have a mind of our own,
We must have freedum to determine
our destiny, It's almost a spiritual thing,
this unity, this harmony. This ynity ot
the mind and of the body, thts “unity of

the dictatorship of the proletariat has
-no roum for the omnipotentadministrator;
there's no room for the exploiter. So
therefore he must go to the countryside
to regain his body; he must work, He
is really done a favor, because the people
force him to unite his mind with his
body by putting them both to work. At
She same time the intelléctual teaches
the people political ideology, he educates
them, thus uniting the mind and the
body in the peasant, Their minds and

bodies are united and they control their
country. I think this is a very good
example of this unity and It ts my idea
of the perfect man,

The Guerrilla

MOVEMENT: You mentioned at another
point that the quarriiia was the prefect
man and this kind of formulation seems
to fit in directly with the guerrilla as
a political man, Would you like to cement
on this? :

HUEY: Yes, The guerrilla is a very
unigiie man. This is incontrast to Marxist-
Leninist orthodox theories where the party
* controls the military, The guerrilla isnot
only te warrior, the munary iignier;
he fs also the military commander as
well as the political theorctigian, Debrey
says “poor thé pen without the guns,
poor the gun without the pen”, ‘The pen
being just an extension of thé mind, a
tool to write down concepts, ideas &The
gun is only an extension of the body,
the extension of our fanged teeth that we
lost through evolution, {t's the weapon,
i's the claws that we lost, it's the body.
‘The guerrilla {s the military commander
and the political theoretician all in one.
In Bolivia Che said that he got very
Httlé help from the Communist Party
there, The Communist Party wanted to
be the mind, the Communist Party wanted
to have full control of the guerrilla
activity, But yet weren't taking part in
the practical work of the guerrillas, The
guerrilla on the other hand {s not only
united within himself, but he alsoattempts
tolspread this to the people by educating
the villagers, giving them political per-
‘spective , pointing out things, educating
them politically, and arming the people.
“Therefore the guerrilla ts giving the
peasants and workers a mind. Because
they've already got the bodywyou get a
unity of the mind and the body, Black
people here in America, who’ have long

—

been the workers, have regained our
‘mtads and we now have a unity of mind
and body.

MOVEMENT: Would you be willing to
extend this formula in terms of white
radicals; to say that one of thetr struggles
today 1s to get buck their bodies.
~

HUEY: Yes, I thought I made that clear,
The white mother country radical by
becoming an activist fs attempiing to
regaln his body. By being an activist
and, not the traditional theoretician who
outlines the plan, as the Communtst Party
has been trying to do for ever so long,
the white mother country radical ts re-
gaining his body. The resistance by white
radicals inBerkeléy during the past three
nights ts a good Indication that the white

are on the say hone, They have
identified their enemies, Thygwhite radi-
cals have integrated theory vith practice.
They realize the American system {s the
real enemy but in order to attack the
American system they must attack the
ordinary cop, In order to attack the
educational system they must attack the
ordinary teacier. Just as the Vietnamese
nennle tn attack the Americ’ ctetam
must attack the ordinary soldier” The
white mother country radicals now are
regaining their bodies and they're also
recognizing that the black man has a mind
and that he is a man,

MOVEMENT: Would you comment on how
this psycholofical understanding aids in
the revolutionary struggle?

HUEY: You can see that in statements
until recently ‘bk people who haven't
been enlightened have defined the white
man by calilng him ‘the MAN", ‘The
Man” 1s making thts decision, “The Man”
this and “The Man” that. The black

woman found it ditficult to respect the
black man because he dign’t even define
himself as a men! Because he didn't
have a mind, because the decision maker
was outside of himself, But the vanguard
group, the Black Panther Party along
with all revolutionary black groups have
regained our mind and our manhood.
Therefore we no longer define the amni-
potent administrator as ‘the Man"...
or the authority as “the MAN”. Matter
of fact the omnipstent administrator along
with his security agents are less than a
man because WE define them as pigs!

INTRODUCTION

"Essays From the Minister of Defense" is a collection
of truths, principles and beliefs practiced by the Black
Panther Party. The writings come from.the pen of Huey
Newton, the Minister of Defense of the Black Panther Par-
ty but the spirit of the writings, the faith expressed and the
undying love for black people exhibited therein,comes from
the souls of colonized black people. The peopte are the

heroes. .
g- The Black Panther Party is a vanguard party for we
7 Africans in U.S, What we beheve inis armed revolution,
= @ permanent revolution, the creationof as manyViet Namo

as are necessary to defeat'U.S, racism and imperialisrn
throughout the world. As you read "Essdys From the Min-
{ster of Defense" you will begin to untlerstand the princi-
ples for the”armed revolution that is beginning in the U.S
If you carry oufithe principles, you willl be a people's war-
srior, and will be bringing black pe&ple and the oppresse:
people everywhere closer to freedom, justice, and equai-
ity throughout the world, The Minister of Defense is ¢.1-

Our slogan is Huey will be set free by any means ne-
essary and if he is not set free the skyis the limit.

Introduction: , e
Huey P. Newton's column in THE BLACK PANTHER
newspaper was entitléd "In Defense of Self Defense." The
following articles by the Minister of Defense were taken

from those columns.

“In Defense of Self Defense.” : June 20, 1967.

Laws and rules have always been made to serve mean
ple." Rules of society are set up by peoplé so that they will

t be able to function in a harmonious way. In other words,

in order to promote the general welfare of society, rules
and laws are established by men. Rules sgpould serve men,
+ and not men serve rules. Much of the time, the laure ama ,
rules which officials attempt to inflict upon poor people are
non-functional in relation tu ihe status, of the poor in socie-
ty. . am

go

These officials ar€ blind to the fact that people should
not respect rules that are not serving therm, It is the duty
of the poor to write and construct rules and laws that are
in their better interests. This is one of the basic human
rights of all men.

Before 1776, white people were colonized by the Eng-
lish. The English government had certain laws and rules
that the colonized Americans viewed as not in theim best
interests but as a colonized people. At that time the Eng-.
lish government felt that the colonized Americans had no

the people living here in America. The colonized Ameri-
can felt he had no choice but to raise the gun in defense of @
the welfare of the colonized people. At this time, he made
certain laws insuring his protection from external and in-
ternal aggressions’ from governments and agencies. One
such ferm of protection was the Declaration of Indepen-
dence, which states: '"...,whenever any government be-

people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute a new pev-
ernment, laying its foundations on such principles and or-
ganizing its powers in such forms as to them shall seem
most likely to effect their safety and, happiness." C

Now these same colonized white people, these ex-
slaves, robbers, and thieves, have dénied the colo
black man the right to even speak of abolishing this
pressive system which the white coloni
ated. They have carried their madness to the four cor-
ners of the earth, and now there is universal rebelhon
against their continued rule and power.. The Black
in America are the only people who can free the werk
loosen the yoke of colonialism end destrey the war

chine are turning there is no country that can defeat this
monster of the West. But Black people can make a mal-
function of this machine from within. Black people can
destroy the machinery that's enslaving the world. Ameri-

‘ .

The slavery of Blacks in this country provides the oil
for the machigery of war that Amcrica uses to enslave the
peoples of the world. Without thjs oil the machinery can-
not function, We are the driving shaft; we are in such a
strategic position in this machinery that, once we become
dislocated, the functioning of the remainder of the machin-
ery breaks down, 7

Penned up in the ghettos of Arnerica, surrounded by
his factories and all the physical components of his eco-
nomic system, we have been made into "the wretched of

in the elementary stage of throwing rocks, sticks, empty

for a chance to murder unarmed Black people. The racist
cops have worked out a system for suppressing these spon-

Black people must now move, from the grassroots up
through the perfumed circles of the Black bourgeoisie, to
seize by any means necessary a proportionate share of the
power vested and collected in the structure of America.
We must organize and unite to combat by long resistance

is why they have made it a felony to teach guerilla wartare.
This is why they want the people unagmed.

The racist dog oppressor fears the armed people; they
7 fear most of all Black people armed with weapons and the
ideology of the Black Panther Party For Self Defense. An
unarmed people are slaves or are subject to slavery at any
given moment. if a government is not afraid of the people
it will arm the people from foreign Sggression. Black
people are held captive in the midst of their oppressors,
There is a world of difference between thirty million un~

One side of this difference contends that Black people
are in the peculiar position where, in order to gain ac-
ceptance into the "mainstream" of American life, they
must employ no tactic that will anger the oppressor 7
whites. ‘This view holds that Black people constitute a
hopeless minority and that salvation for Black people lies
in developing brotherly relations, There are certain
tactics that are taboo, Violence against the oppressor
must be avoided at all costs, because the oppressor will
retaliate with superior violence. So Black people may
protest, but not protect. They can complain, but not cut
and shoot, In short, Black people must at all costs re-
main non-violent,

On the other side of the difference, we find that the
point of departure is the principle that the oppressor has
no rights that the oppressed is bound to respect. Kill the
slavemaster, destroy him utterly, move against him
with implacable fortitude. Break hjs oppressive power”
by any means necessary. Men who have stoad lefore
-the Black masses and recommended this response to the
oppression have been held in fear by the oppressor. The
Blacks in the colony who were wed to the non-violent
alternative €ould not relate to the advocates of implacable
opposition to th€ oppressor. Because the oppressor al-
«ways prefers to deal with the less fadical, i.e., less
dangerous, spokesmen for his subjects. He would pre-
fer that his subjects had no spokesmen at all, or better
yet, he wishes to speak for them himself. Unable to do
this practically, he docs the next best thing, and endorses
spokesmen who will allow him to speak through them te
the masses, Paramount amongst his imperatives is to
see to it that implacable spokesmen are never allowed

to communicate their message to the masses. They are
never allowed to communicate their message to the
masses.. Their oppressor will resort to any means
necessary to silence the implacables.

7 : a

The oppressor, the endorsed spokesmen, and the
implacables form the three points of a triangle of death.
The oppres$or looks upon che endorsed spokesmen as a
too] to use against the implacables to keep the masses
passive within the acceptable limits of the tactics he is
capable of containing. The endorsed spokesmen look



”

2

upon the oppressor asa guardian angel who can always be
depended upon to protect them from the wrath of the im-
placables, while he looks upon the implacables as’ dan-
gerous and irresponsible madmen who, by angering the
oppressor, will certainly provoke a blood bath.in which
they themselves might get washed away. The irnplacables
view both the oppressors and the endorsed teadérs as his
deadly enemies. If anything,“ he has a more profound
hatred for the endorsed leaders than he has for the op-
pressor himself, because the implacables know that

they can deal with the oppressor only after they have
driven the endorsed spokesmen off the scene.

idistorically, the endorsed spokesmen have alway

held the upper hand on the implacables. In Afro-Ameri-
can history, there are shining brief moments when the

~-implacables have outmancuvered the oppressor and the
endorsed spokesmen and gained the attention of the
Rlack masses. The Black masses, recognizing the
implacables in the depths of their despair, respond
magnetically to the implacables and bestow a devotion
and loyalty to them that frightens the oppressor and en-
dorsed spokesmen Ynto a panic-stricken frenzy, and
they leap into a rash act -- murder, imprisonment, or
exile -* to silence the implacables and to fet their show
back on the road,

°

The massés of Black people have always been
deeply entrenched and involved in the basic necessities
of life. They have not had time to abstract their situ-
ation, Abstractions come only with leisure. The
people have not had the luxury of leisure. Therefgre,
the people have been very aware of the true definition
of politics: politics are merely the desire of individuals

{and groups to Setisfy first, their basic needs ~- food,
shelter and clothing, and security for themselves and
their loved ones. The Black leaders endorsed by the
power structure have attempted to sell the peuple the
simple-minded theory that polities is holding a political
office; being able to muve inte a $40,000 hom peing
able ta-sit near white people ina restaurant (while in
fact the Black mitsses have not been able to pay the
rent of a $40.00 rat-infested hovel).

. a The Black leaders have led the community to believe
that brutality and force could be ended by subjecting the
people to this very force of self-sacrificing demonstra~ _
tions. “The Black péuple realize brutality and force’ can
only be inflicted if there is submission. The community
has not responded in the past oy in the present to the ab-
surd and erroneous, deceitful tactics of so-called legiti-~
mate Blacx leaders. The community realizes that force
and brutality can only be eliminated by counter force
through self defense, Leaders who have recommended
these tactics have never had the suppurt and following
of the downtrodden black masses who comprise the bulk
of the community. Grassroots -- the downtrodden of
the Black community, even though they rejected the hand-
picked handkerchief heads endorsed by the power struc-
ASneee ture, the people have not had the academic or administra-
a. tive knowledge to form themselves in long resistance to
. the brutality.
. : 4 Asser:
Marcus Garvey and Malcolm X were the two Bilack
men of the twentieth century who posed an implacable’
challenge to both the oppressor and the endorsed spokes-
men that c#uld be dealt with in any other way than pre-
cisely the foulémanner recorded by history. Malcolm,
in our time, stood on the threshhotd with the oppressor
and the endorsed spokesmen in a bag that they ‘couldn't
get out of, Malcolm, implacable to the ultimate degree,
held out to the Black masses the historical, stupendous
victory of Black collective salvation and liberation from
the chains of the oppressor and the treacherous embrace
of the endorsed spokesmen. Only with the gum were the
black masses denied this victory, But they learned from
Malcolm that with the gun, they can recapture their
dreams and bring them into reality.

4 . The heirs of Malcolm now stand millions strong on
their corney of the triangle, facing the racist dog op-
pressor and the soulless endorsed spokesmen: The
heirs of Malcolm have picked up the gun and, taking
first things first, are moving to expose the endorsed
spokesmen for the Black masses tu see them for what
they are and always have been, The choice offered by
the heirs of Malcolm to the endorsed spokesmen is to

oo repudiate the oppressor and to crawl back to their people

But first, they must respect the party which is trans-
mitting this message, When the Vanguard yroup destroys
the machinery of the oppressor by dealing with him in
“o small groups of tnree and fuur, and then escapes the
might of the oppressor, the masses will be overjoyed
and will adhere to this correct stratezy. When the masses

hear that a xestapo policeman has been exvcuted while
sipping coffee at a counter, and the revolutionary execu-

‘ tioners fled without being traced, the masses will see the
validity of this type of approach to resistance, It is not
necessary to organize thirty million Black people in pri-
mary groups of two's and three's but it is important for
the party to show the people how to go about revolution.

. During slavery, in which no vanguard party. existgd and .
forms of communication were severely restricted and in-
sufficient, many slave revolts occurred,

. There are basically three ways ope can learn:

experience. The black community is basically composed
of activists, The h activity,
either through observation of or participation in the acti-
vity, To stud¥ and learn is good but the actual experience
is the best means Of learning, The party must engage in
activities that will teach the people, he black community
is basically not a reading community. Therefore it is
very significant that the vanguard group first be activists,
Without this knowledge of the black community, one could
not gain the fundamenval knowledge of the black revolution
in racist America,

The main function of the party is to awaken the people

and to teach them the strategic method of resisting the

q power structure, which is prepared not only to combat the
resistance of.the people with massive brutality, but to
totally annihilate the black community, the black popyla-
tion, : . .

If it is Tearned by the power structure that black peo-
ple have ''x'' amount of guns in their possession, this will
not stimulate the power structure to prepare itself with
guns, because it is already more than prepared.

The end result of this education will be positive for
Blaek people in their resistance and negative for the
power structure in its oppression, because the party al-
ways exemplifies revolutionary defiance. If the party
is not going to make the, peoplé’ aware of the tools of lib- «
eration‘and-the strategic method that is to be used, there
will be no means by which the people will pe mobilized

7 The relationship between the yanguard party and the
masses is a secondary relationship. The relationship be+
tween the members of the vanguard party is a priimary 7
relationship. It is important that the members of the van-
guard group maintain a face-to-face relationship with each
ether, This is important if the party machinery is to Be
effective. It is impossible to put together functional party
machinery or programs without this direct relationship,
@The members of the vanguard group should be tested revo-
lutionaries. This will minimize the danger of Uncle Tom

* _ informers and opportunists. et

ee

The main purpose of vanguard group should be to
raise the consciousness of the masses through educational
programs and certdtn physical activities the party will
participate in. The sleéping masses must be bombarded
with the correct approach to struggle through the activi-
ties of the vanguard party. Therefore, the masses must

ne know that the party exists, The party must use all means
available to get this information across to the masses. If
the masses do not have knowledge of the party, it will be-
impossible for the masses to follow the program of the”
party. i:
*

The vanguard party is never underground in the be-
ginning of its existence, because this would limit its ef-

\ fectiveness and educational processes. How can you
teach people if the people do not know and respect you?
The party must exist above ground as long as the dog
power structure will allow, and hopefully when the party
is forced to go underground the message of the party will
already. have been put across to the people. The vanguard
party's activities on the surface will necessarily be short-

lived.

tremendous impact upon the people before it is driven into
* secrecy. “ : 2. va : .

’

At this time, the people know the party exists, and
they will seck out fu rther information on the activities of .
this underground party, :

Many would-be revolutionaries work under the falla-
cious illusion that the vanguard party is-to be a secret
organization that the power structure knows nothing about,
and the masses know nothing about, exgept for occasional
letters that come to their homes by-night, Underground
parties cannot distribute leaflets announcing an under-
ground meeting. These are contradictipris and’ inconsis-
tencies of the so-called revolutionaries, The so-called

i A ®- revolutionaries are in fact afraid of the very danger that
| they are advocating for the people. These so-called revo-
7 . lutionaries want the people tu say what they themselwess

* are afraid to say, and the people to do’ what they them-
' selves are afraid todo, This makes the so-called revolu-
: tionary a coweae, and a hypocrite. 7
| If these imposters would investigate the history of
| revolution, they would see that the vanduard group always
starts out above ground and js later driven underground
| 20 by the aggressor, The Cuban Revolution exemplifies this
7 " fact; when Fidel Castro started to resist the butcher
Batista and the American running dogs, he started by”
speaking on the campus of the University of Havana in
* public. He was later driven to the mils. His impact upon
; the dispossessed people of Cuba was very greatyand re-
ceived with much respect. When he went into secrecy,
.Cuban people searched him out. People went to the hills
Ny to find him and his band of twelve. Castro handled the
. : revolutionary struggle correctly. If the Chinese Revolu-
tion is investigated, it will be seen that the Communist 4
Party was quite on the surface so that they would be able
to muster support from the masses, There are many
areas one can read about to learn the correct approach,
such as the revolution in Kenya, the Algerian Revolution,
Fanon's THE WRETCHED OF THE EARTH, the Russian
.Revolution, the works of Chairman Mao Tse-tung, anda

A revolutionary must realize at if he is sincere,
°geath is imminent dué to the fa-t that the things he is
saying and doing are extremely dangerous. Without this
realization, it is impossible to proceed as a revolutionary.
The masses are constantly looking for a guide, a Messiah,
to liberate them from the hands of the oppressor. The
vanguard party must exemplify the characteristics of
worthy leadership, Millions and millions of oppressed
people might not know members of the vanguard party

personally or directly, but they will gain through an in-
direct acquaintance the proper strategy for liberation via
the mass media and the physical activities of the party.
It is of prime importance that the vanguard party develop
a political organ, such as a newspaper produced b§the .
party, as well as employ strategically revolutionary art
and destruction of the oppressor's machinery. For ex-
ample, Watts, The economy and property of the oppres-
sor was destroyed to such an extent that no matter how the
oppréssor tried to whitewash the activitfes of the black
rotners, the real nature and the real cause of the acuvity
was communicated to every black community. For further
example, no matter how the oppressor tries to distort and
confuse the mesgage of Brother Stokely Carmichael, Black
people all over the gountry understand it perfectly and
welcome it. a : e

‘The Black Panther Party for Self Defense teaches
that in the final analysis, the amount of guns and defense
weapons, such as hand grenades, bazookas, and other
necessary equipment, will be supplied by taking these
weapons from the power structure, as exemplified by the
Viet Cong. Therefore, the greater the military prepara-
tion on the part of the oppressor, the greater is the avail-
ability of weapons for the black community. It is believed -
by some hypocrites that when the people are taught by the
vanguard group to prepare for resistance, this only
brings the man down on them with increasing violence and
brutality; but the fact of the matter is that when the man
becomes more oppressive, this only heightens the revo-~
lutionary fervot. The people never make revolution. The
oppressors by their brutal actions cause the resistance by
the people. The vanguard party only teaches the correct
methods of resistance. So, if things can get worse for

oppressed people, then they will feel no need for revglu-
tion or resistance. The complaint of the hypocrites that
the Black Panther Part for Self Defense is exposing the
people to deeper suffering is an incorrect observation,
ad People have proved that they will not tolerate any more | rs
oppression by the racist dog police through their rebel-
lions in the black communities across the country. The
people are looking now for guidance td extend and
strengthen their resistance struggle. 1

ae FEAR AND DOUBT»

>. New! . :
By Huey P. Newton May a, 1967

The lower socio-economic Black male is a man of
- confusion. He faces a hostile environment and is not sure
that it is not his own sins that have attracted the hostili-
~ ties of societv. All his life he has beer taught (expvligity
and implicitly) that he is an inferior approximation of hu-
misnity. As aman, he finds himself void of these things
that bring respect and a feeling of Worthiness. He looks
around for sométhing to blame for his situation, but be-,
-cause he is not sopHisticated regarding the secio-econom-
ic milieu and be ause of negativistic pafental and institu-
tional teachings, he ultimately blames himsell.

When he was a child, his parents told him that they
were not affluent because "we didn't have the opportunity
to become educated," or "we did not take advantage of the
educational opportunities that were offered to us." They
tell their children that things will be different fog them if
they are educated and skilled, but that there is absolutely

“ nothing other than this occasional warning (and often not
ny even this) to stimulate education. Black people are great
worshippers of education, even the lower socio-economic
Black person, but at the same time, they are afraid of 7
+ exposing themselves to it. They are afraid because they
are vulnerable to having their fears verified; perhaps they
will find that they can't compete with white students. The
Black person tells himself that he could have done much
more if he had really wanted to. The fact is, of course, : .
that the assumed educational opportunities were never

aa pales

160 ee :
NW 65360 Docld:32989647 Page 584



available to the lower socio-economic Black person due
to the unique position assigned him in life.

It is a two-headed monster that haunts this man.
First, his attifude is that hé lacks innate ability to cope 4
with the socio-economic problems confronting. him, and
second, he tells himself that he hag the ability but he sim-
ply has not felt strongly enough to try to acquire the skills
needed to manipulate his environment. In a desperate
effort to assume self-respect, he rationalizes that he is
lethargic; in this way, he denies a possible lack of innate
ability. If he openly attempts to-discover his abilities, he
and others may sce him for what he is - or is not, and
this is the real fear. He then withdraws into the world of
the invisible, but not without a struggle. He may agtempt
to make himself visible by processing his hair, acquiring
a boss mop", or driving a long car, even though he can't

@_ afford it, He may father several illegitimate children by
several different women in order to display his mascu-
linity, But in the end, he realizes that BR is ineffectual |
in his efforts. 7 *

Society responds tc him as a thing, a beast, a non-

entity, something to be ignored or stepped on. He is
asked to respect“laws that do not respect him. He is
asked to digest a cod® of ethics that acts upon him but not
for him. He is confused and in a constaht state of rage,
of shame and doubt. This psychological set permeates
all his interpersonal relationships, It determines his
: view of the social system. His psychological develop-
; . ment has been prematurely arrested. This doubt begins
' ata very early age and continues through his life. The
parents pass it on to the child and the social system ‘rein-
forces the fear, the shame, and the doubt. In thg third
- or fourth grade, he may find that he shares the classroom
oo “with white students, but when the class is engaged in
& reading exercises, all the Black students find themselves
in a group at a table reserved for slow readers. This
may be quite an innocent effort on the part of the school
system, The teacher may not realize that the Black stu-
dents feared (in fact, feel certain) that Black means dumb
and white means’smart. The children do not realize that
the head start the children got at home is what accounts
for the situation. It.is generally accepted that the child
1s the father of the man; this holds true for the lower
~ socio-economic Black peuple.

country are intensifying the terror, brutality, murder o
7 * and’ repression of Black people.

S At the same time that the American government is
’ waging a racist war of genocide in Vietnam, the concen-"
tration camps* in which Japanese Americans were in-
terned during World War Il are being renovated and ex-
panded. Since America has historically reserved thé
1 most barbaric treatment for non-white people, we are
forced to conclude that these concentration camps are
being prepared for Black people who are determined to
gain their freedom by any means necessary. The en~
slavement of Black people from the very beginning of this
country, the genocide practiced on the American Indians _
and the confining of the survivors on reservations, the
savage lynching of thousands of Black men and women,
the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki,
and. now the cowardly massacre in Vietnam, all testify to 7
. the fact that towards people of color the racist power
qi structusd of Americ? has but one palicy: renressian. #

genocide, terror, and the big Stick.

a.

} 7 ‘Black peopie nave pegged, prayed, petitioned, dem-
7 onstrated and everything else to get the racist power
structure of Amerifa to right the wrongs which have his~
: torically been perpetrated against Bla@k people. All of

: these efforts have been answered by more repression,

i deceit, and hypocrisy. As the aggression of the racist

i American government ¢ lates in Vietnam, the police
agencies of America escalate the repression of Black
people throughout the ghettos of America. Vicious police
dogs, cattle prods and increased patrols have become
familiar sights in black communities. City Hal, turns a
deaf ear to the pleas of Black people for relief from this
increasing terror. : : 7

q " The Black Panther Party for Self Defense believes
that the time has come for Black people to arm them-

i eee selves against this terror before itis too late. The «
pending Mulford Act brings the hour of doom one step

problems can mean anything from a radicql restructuring
of our society to genocide against the black community.

The pigs are curidug dunn ou the peoples
because large numbers of black, brown and white people are understanding what this country
and the pigs are all about. The more we understand, the harder we fight. And the harder
we fight, the greater is the threat to the political, economic and social control of this country
- by the, racist power structure. And when the people in power feel threatened they respond na
in the only way they can—with forge and violence.
As the number of black rebellins, campus revolts, labor strikes, welfare marches and
sit-ins, rent strikes, ete., increase, the power structure afid its pigs become increasingly
incapable of stopping the people and are forced to develop newer, more sophisticated methods
to control them. That is what police institutes like the one at the University of Illinois at
Chicago Circle and the one on police technology at IIT are all about.

“Just Doin’ My Job” a

We often hear about how the cop is ‘just doing his job”. That’s certainly true enough;
but what exactly is his “job”? The actions of the police in the black and brown commumniti
make that clear. Try telling any ghettu dweller that the police are in his community to protect
the people. He knows that is a lie—they are there to protect private prop@rty, to function as
an “occupying army” to protect the property of the outside —yenerally white—businessman,
When the “showdown” between property and peuple’s lives comes the pigs will always si

ith the businessman, The order that Daley gave last April —*Shoot to kill” —was no mistake.

gilvie’s statement upon sending in the National Guard—*Property Must Re Protected" —
meant the same thing—the property of storeowners and slumturds is to be maintained at the
cost of human lives. e

Pigs serve three repressive functions in what we will call the black and brown internal
colonies. This is not to say that the pigs are not repressive in white neighborhoods; the brutal
attachs on white youth—st@dents, dropouts, gang kids, and to an increasing extent while
workers—should dispel that idea, The pigs function in a similar manner in white
neighborhoods but it is obvious that the repression brought dewn on the black and brown
communities is not only more Intense given the nature of this racist suciety, but it is of

“ese

5 a qualitatively different nature from the way whites are treated.

The police function first to maintain “law and order*; the law which
the capitalist class has developed to protect its wealth and property and
the order which it needs to maintain its power. The pigs are the armed
force which is used to “Serve and Protecg” the rulers of this country.
Police are assigned to patrol the ‘neighborhoods, schools, hangouts
parks. Any deviation from their ideas as to what constitutes “good behiv
is met with brutal force. ‘They occupy and surround the high schools (black,
brown and white) to keep any opposition to the rotten educational system
from “getting out of hand®. Actually they act more like guar:
which is what the high schools function as. Inthe past year they have
increased the size of the gang intelligence unit (GIU) from 38 to over 200.
The GIL watches, spies on, harasses and intimidates anyone they defin
as being a member of a “gang”. 7 :

Second, police act to destroy the dignity and spirit of resistance which
is so widespread in the black and brown communiti hey verbally and
physically abuse and intimidate people on the street—men, women, and -
young people are forced to undergo constant harassment, intimidation and
coercion—stop and (risk, curfew violations, no standing on corners, women

We occasionally hear It said that the fault Mes*with the individual policeman, and that he
needs to be “educated”. Lut the hatred for the police comes not as a result of the actions
of the individual cop but as a response to the functions (outlined above) witich the police play.
Those of us who were in the park during the Convention this summer ar who live in black
or Spanish communities know that it doesn’t matter if a cop is a PhD or a grade school
dropout because once he puts on the uniform, he begins to “do his job’.

The police have not acquired any new functions; they have historically been tools of the
ruling class. They helped the slaveowners to keep the slaves “in their place® and. prevented
slave rebellions. They served the industrial bosses and robber barons, men like Jay Gould
and Andrew Carnegie, in breaking strikes—stopping picket lines, protecting scabs and
brutally beating, sometimes killing, striking men and women. They helped the company
owners during the thirties when working men and women fought fur unions and a decent
standard of living. Even today they help to suppress wildcat strikes.

; WHAT TO DO : : : |
& ol o, hy

It should be clear that the police institute will not in any
“way benefit the biack. and: Latin communities, the working
people or the youth of this country; will not in any way help to
solve the serious problems we face—racial ‘inequality,
imperialist wars, poverty, In fact, by emphasizing a policy of
overwhelming police power and continued repression it may
aggravate the problems,

We must expose and educate people to understand the role
of this institute and the pigs. We must demand that*this
institute be- stopped.

While we demand that the police institute get off the Chicago
Circl@- campus, it is not because we see the University as
some sort of “ivory tower” which must be.protected uly

outside influences, The university-with is police instite!

lice institut

step to stopping it permanefitly. If it is moved off the campus
and into the .community we will organize t6 stop it there.

“Minister of Foreiya Atisits not. confine itself to only fighting; besides fighting

to destroy the enemy's military strength,. our Party
must also shoulder such important tasks as doing pro-
paganda among the masses, organizing the masses arming
Black people, helping them to astablish revolutionary
political power afd set g Up party orge®nigations, .The
Black Panther Party defends itself with guns and force
not merely for he sake of fighting but in order to con-
duct propaganda among the masses, organize them, arm
them, and help them to establish revolutionary.political
power. without these objectives, fighting looses its
meaning anc the Black Panther Party looses the reason
for its existence.

Dote . 6/10/69

On June 4, 1969, Special Agent (SA) GORDON S.
BROOKS and SA HERMAN Ii, SCOTT arrested PATRICK KEEN at the
headquarters of the Black Panther Party (BPP), 2350 West
Madison Street.

_ KEEN was subsequently transported by Bureau
automobile to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FRI)
Office at 219 South Dearborn Street, where he was photo—
graphed, fingerprinted and interviewed concerning his
association with the BPP and with the oer dece GEORGE SAMS, “IR.

KEEN was provided with a copy of a Warning and
Waiver Form which he read and pehcchantal he understood, but . _ t
declined to sign.

KEEN provided the following information:

He stated that he has been a member of ‘the BPP
for approximately three weeks and advised that on the
night of June 3-4, 1969, he was the Officer of the Day (OD)
at BPP headquarters, 2350 West Madison, Chicago, Illinois.
He advised that as the OD he had been in charge of the BPP
office, ,

KEEN observed a photograph of GEORGE SAMS, JR.
and stated that he did not know SAMS by name nor did he
recognize the photograph. He stated that he had-never
seen the person in the photograph in the BPP office.

KEEN advised that a couple of weeks ago, he had
gone into the BPP office and had heard someone talking
loudly in another room in the office. We stated that he
made inquiries about the person making the noise and was
told that the man's name was WADDELL and that he was from
BPP headquarters on the West coast. He added, however,
that he did not actually observe WADDELL and, therefore, -
would be unable to state whether or not this person was
identical with the photograph of GEORGE SAMS, JR.

ILLINOIS STATUTES DON'T PREEMPT
a GUN FIELD CONTROL FROM CITIES

\chicago ordinaice-curbing ordinance su
. Stained against constitutional, statutory argue
> ments by MMlinvis Supreme Court. ~

Chicago's all-

quiring detailed information on every firearms transfer
and registration of already possessed guns. and prohih.
iting anyone from taking a gun out of his house ar
place of business is unsuccessfully attacked by indi-
viduals and a sporting goods sture. The Hlini
preme Court sustains the ordinance inst alleg
that the state has pre-empted the gua control field,
and that the ordinance violates the Second Amend-
“ment. The court i do by arguments
that the ordinance is vague and confusing, that it un-
Tawfully delegates legis power lo a edy official
and that it is an unreasonable exercise of the police
-power. (Brown v, Chicago, 5/28/69)

Digest of Opinien: The pre-emptiun argument is without
merit, The stale, tute deals with registration of owners
only, whereas the ordinance ty for registration of weapons
themselves, There is no inconsistency of repugnancy between
the two. :

Although the Se und Amendment to the U.S. Constitution
provides that the ryht of the people to keep and ber army

BLACK PANTHER PARTY, Also
Known As Black Panther Party
for Sel

1 : According to its official newspaper, the black Panther

| Party (BPP) was sturted during December, 1965, in Oakland,

California, to organize black people so they can take control

of the life, politics and the destiny of the black community.

I It was organized by BOBBY SEALL, BPP Chairmen, and HUEY P,

| NEWTON, BPP Minister of Defense. NEWTON was sentenced in 1968
to serve 2 to 15 years after being convicted of manslaughter —

\ in connection with the killing of an Oakland police officer.

The official newspaper, "The Black Panther," which
further describes itself as the “Black Community News Service,‘
states that the BPP advocates the use of guns und guerrilla
tactics in its revolutionary program to end oppression of the
black people. Residents of the black community are urged to
arm themselves against the police who are consistently referred
‘to in the publication as “pigs” who should be killed.

“The Black Panther’ issue of September 7, 1968, contains
an editorial by BPP Minister of Education, GEORGE MASON MURRAY,
which ends with the following:

"Black men. Bluck people, colored persons of
America, revolt everywhere: Arm yourselves. The only culture
worth keeping is a revolutionary culture. Change. Freedom
everywhere, Dynamite! Rlack Power. Use the gun. Kill the
pigs everywhere,"

Included in the introduction to an article appearing
in the October 5, 1968, edition of ‘The Black Panther" is the
statement "....we will not dissent from American Government.

We will overthrow it.”

- Issues of "The Black Panther” regularly contain |
quotations from the writings of Chairman Mao Tse-tung of the \

felt the coalition existed and would continue to exist only as
long as the BPP felt it could receive some benefit from such a
coalition, The sources did advise the coalition had deteriorated
because of the refusal in the past of the BPP to engage in any
activity with these groups unless the BPP received some benefit.

Both the BPP and CP agree they have a concurrent
theory toward the antiriot law trial currently in progress

“* BLACK PANTHER PARTY, Also
“Known AS Bluck Panther Party
“for Self-Defense

According to its official newspaper, the Black Panther
Party (BPP) was started during December, 1966, in Oakland, .-
California, to organize black people so they can take control
of the life, politics and the destiny of the black community.

It was organized by BOBBY SEALE, BPP Chairman, and HUEY P,
NEWTON, BPP Minister of Defense, NEWTON was sentenced in 1968
to serve 2 to 15 years after being convicted of manslaughter

, in connection with the killing of an Oakland police officer.

The official newspaper, "The Black Panther," which
further describes itselZ as the "Black Community News Service,"
states that the BPP advocates the use of guns and guerrilla
tactics in its revolutionary program to end oppression of the

“black people. Residents of the black community are urged to
arm themselves against the police who are consistently referred
to in the publication as "pigs'' who should be killed.

oe "The Black Panther" issue of September 7, 1968, contains
‘an editorial by BPP Minister of Education, GEORGE MASON MURRAY,
which ends with the following:

"Black men, Bluck people, colored persons of
America, revolt everywhere! arm yourselves. The only culture
worth keeping is a revolutionary culture, Change. Freedom
everywhere, Dynamite! Black Power, Use the gun. Kill the
pigs everywhere.”

: Included in the introduction to an article appearing
-in the October 5, 1968, edition of "The Black Panther" is the
statement ey eWe will not dissent from American Government.
fe will overthrow it.”

Issues of "The Black Panther” rogulasiy i contain

4 atations from the writings of Chairman Mao Tse-tung of the
‘People? 6 Republic of China and feature Mao's statement that
» "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.”

The national headquarters of the BPP is located at
3108 Shattuck Avenue, Berkeley, California, Branches have

STUDENTS FOR A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY

: A source has advised that the Students. for a
‘Democratic Society (SDS), as it is known today, came into
being at a founding convention held at Port Huron, Michigan;
in June, 1962. From an. initial ideological posture of
"participatory democracy," the current line of the national
leadership reveals an adherence to Marxism-Leninism.

* .MUCHARL KLONSKY, National Secretary, in March, 1969, called .
“fon the building of a revolutionary Marxist-Leninist movement.
fhe program of SDS has moved from involvement in civil rights
_ Struggles to an anti-Vietnam war position and finally to
'4%8 present advocacy of an anti-imperialist line,. linking -
“Up the oppressed peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America

, with the black liberation movement in the United States.
China, Vietnam and Cuba are regarded as countries which are
leading the world-wide struggles against United States imperial-
“ dessa. Gm the other hand, SDS regards the Soviet Union as : :
an impérialist power  “d does not support the polices of : Hi
that country. et

SDS maintains a National Office in Room 206, 1608
Vest Madison Street, Chicago, Illinois. Its official paper
“New Left Notes" reflects the line of the national leadership
and program adopted at meetings of the National Council ane
> National Interim Committee (NIC). Three national officers ¥
and a NIC of eleven members are elected each year during a vi
‘June National Convention.

SDS Regional Offices and university and college
_ chapters elect delegates to National Council meetings wherein
‘program and ideology are debated, but each Region and chapter
is autonomous in nature and is free to carry out independent
policy and programs reflective of local conditions.

APPENDIX

. STUDENTS FOR A DEMOCRATIC SCCIETY

: A source has advised that the Students for a
‘Democratic Society (SDS), as it is known today, came into
being at a founding conyention held at Port Huron, Michigan,
in June, 1962. From an. initial ideological posture of
7 “participatory democracy," the current line of the national
= leadership reveals an adherence to Marxism-Leninism,
* -~MECHASL KLONSKY, National Secretary, in March, 1969, called
‘fon the building of a revolutionary Marxist-Leninist movement.
Tha program of SDS has moved from involvement in civil rights
_ Struggles te an anti-~Vietnam war position and finally to
"ats present advocacy of an anti-imperialist line, Linking
up the oppressed peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America
, with the black liberation movement in the United States.
‘China, Vietnam and Cuba are regarded as countries which are
leading the world-wide struggles against United States imperial—
“ dem. Qn the other hand, SDS regards the Soviet Union as
an imperialist power 1d does not support the polices of
that country.

SDS maintains a National Office in Room 206, 1608

- West usdison Street, Chicago, Illinois. Its official paper
New Laft Notes" reflects the line of the national leadership
and program adopted at meetings of the National Council and
National Interim Committee (NIC). ‘Three national officers
and a NIC of eleven members are elected each year during a
-June National Corivention.

SDS Regional Offices and university and college
“chapters elect delegates to National Council meetings wherein
program and ideology are debated, but each Region and chapter
“is autonomous in nature and is free to carry out independent
policy and programs reflective of local conditions.

so.moral about? We-knov the honky got everything. He got. it
"by stealing it. He's nédt going to give you anything. We got
_ to, take it. These brothers on the streets every day take it,

GRENADES, AND BOMBS , ANTI-. PROPERTY AND ANTI- PERSONNEL

No. 1. The very small, home-made grenade is exactly
thessame a the small explosive device used to set off
the firebomb. _ 5

It is the CO2 cartridge as described in the 7
preceeding directions, only instead of using a cigarette ~
to time the fuse, you can light the fuse and throw it.
This little CO 2 cartridge just as it is doesn't do a
lot of damage, but it can be dressed up to become a very
lethal weapon. It can be made into a deadly anti-
personnel weapon or a very dangerous bomb.

The small CO2 cartridge can be dressed up by fifling |
with 3/4 black nevwder and 2/4 shot, or needles. This is
obvioulsy anti-personnel and will penetrate when the CO2
expledes, but still is not big enough to kill. It has
certain advantages, however. It can be taped to a window,

the CO2 is so small it can easily be concealed on pour

person. P pacet gauat 7

Now, to.make an actual grenade, a weapon that kills, the
following can be done: oon i

: Take. a used, empty aerosol. ean, pull off the

little plastic spray devices, and with a hammer and nail

pound the little plastic nipple down into the can. Use

a punch or screwdriver with hammer to widen tse hole and

make it large enough so that large shot can be inserted

through the hole. Then fil]. with 3/4 black powder and’ .
1/4 gullets or small-headed nails. Insert fuse, and

light when ready to throw. The fuse should be an inch and

a half in length and should leave your hand when ityhas

burned to an inch.

CAUTION: ‘The explos#ve foree of this weapon is great.

It is even more dangerous than a standard army grenade.

r Needless to say, a too-short fuse will result in a

t scattered grenade-holder, A too-long fuse will result
in the person or persons.at whom you have thrown it to
have a chance to throw it back and blow you to fragments.
A guerilla with lousy aim in close quarters can kill his
brothers. This thing is equivalent to about 12 shotgun

on a

blasts at once. If thrown into # car i# will blow to
bits the car ay and everything in it, humax or otherwise.
If thrown in the open, it will kill within a 25 ft,
radius and mim within 100 ft. It is a geod: idea to
familiarize yourself with this weapon By practicing with
a sand-filled facsimile. Try this, and see how long~ the
fuse takes. You cannot afford to misuse this in any
way, as its a real motherfucker of a wezpon. a
To make a bomb use the same principle as for tha grenade,
only instead of lighting the fuse and ttmowing it, you
use the cigarette and set the thing down. For a strictly
anti-property bomb, you don't need the siot' or nails.
Just the black powder. A large amount of commercial
dynamite is made with black powder and ctat's exactly
the kind of bomb you're building here. With thds thing,
the sky's the limit. You can make it as big as you like,
depending only on the size of the container, the can

that you use. A large tar-bucket full, fr instance,
would demolish most any building. This iis a versatile
thing, can be scaled to the size you want, Used in 7
conjunction with gasoline. or set. near aw fual kopk on
explosive container, the blast wauld take an entire
plant and day it-down. Ferhaps the greatest advantage
here is that'all ingredients can be bough legally, at

gun shops, hobby shops even: five and tens,

in this story, the leader of the zaid, Sat.

the apartment. “According to the informants, at least

however, made any mention of Hampton's or Clark's fre-

structure in the United States is taking advantage of
hysteria and is bringing about a fasciststate, American
style. According to Garry every white person is a racist
and every male individual is a supremist. He stated that
economic oppression leads to all other kinds of oppression
and unless this is recognized no progress can be made. He
added that the BPP states that the United States is carrying
on an imperialist war both inside and outside America, but
that racism cannot be fought’ with racism but must be

fought with socialism.

The first source stated that he determined that
Richard Criley and Jack Kling in discussing Garry's speech
disagreed with Garry's stating that every white was a
racist inasmuch as the Communist Party (CP) USA does not
believe such is the case. The first source then stated that
the next speaker was Jerry Lefcourt, Attorney for the 21
BPP members on trial in New York City at that time. Lefcourt
gave a run~down of the circumstances of the trial.

The first source added that at the March 7, 1970
conference the additional individuals spoke:

Reverend Calvin Morris, Chicago, Illinois who <
represented the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.

the defense philosophically of the BPP, adding that everyone
in a repressive society is threatened. He stated that talk
is insufficient and that revolution must take place,

Dr. Nathan Wright, Jr., Professor of Urban Affairs,
State University of New York then spoke and characterized the
threat of counterviolence as being violence was incorrect.
He added that 4t.is the American tradition to arm for counter-
attack, and that those in positions of power, who advocate’
law and order obtained their positions by reason of violence.
He stated that unless the black people are given equity then
they should say no to the. "masters".

Arthur Kinoy, an Attorney and Professor at Rutgers
University Law School, New Jersey, stated that the BPP has
tthe central task in operating the movement of the people at
the present time. He said that the enemy moves out of weakness
and fear and are afraid of movements in the ghettos and
universities as well as being afraid of the peace movement.
He added that the ruling class was unable to solve the
problems of sub~society and in that connection emphasized
that the BPP because of their power structure was vital in
defending the rights of minority peoples, He called upon
the conference to plan for the political defense of the BPP
under a national campaign. Sammy Rayner from Chicago then
spoke briefly calling for the election of more black Congressmen.

of speakers of the Chicago "Conspiracy 7" who had recently
been on trial in Chicago for violating Federal Anti-Riot
Laws and who were then free on appeal of their convictions,
One of the speakers was Tom Hayden of that group, who stated
that racists fears come.through in reverse. By way of
example, he said that a person who is a racist and fears a
revolutionary will create illegal acts, what usually happens
is that illegal acts happen against the revolutionary. Hayden
also remarked that if the peace movement is unable to end the
war within the United States it can never end the war in
Vietnam. He emphasized that a massive educational campaign
must be organized within the United States to bring the
Vietnam issue to a point of action.

Hayden's talk was followed by comments on the
“Conspiracy 7" trial by the following defendants; David
Dellinger, J teen? Rubin and John Froines,

The Reverend C. T. Vivian from Chicago then
spoke and stated that the question of the BPP defense
was a question of self-interest for everyone. He
added that the conference was not being held to plan
the defense, but rather to plan a program for survival.
He called for the 1970's to be the years of defense of
civil liberties in America, During this session reports
were given on the four workshops held on March 7, 1970.

department stores in the various cities.

The Reverend Charies Yerkes of New-York City

that this workshop called for a massive educational campaign
on repression and that some of the means that should be

Fred Hampton. Blair Anderson,a former BPP member and a
survivor of the raid stated that he had been beaten and
cursed by the police even though not wounded, Deborah
Johnson, another survivor of the raid testified that she
had been in the back room of the apartment with Fred Hampton

and that as Hampton raised his head he was shot by the raiders.”

She testified that it was possible that Hampton was asleep
when he was killed.

Donette Brewer, another survivor of the raid
testified that in addition to being kicked and cursed,
even though wounded she fell from a stretcher as the
raiders roughly carried her down the steps of the apartment,

Louis Truelock, another survivor of the raid did
not testify before the "Inquest".

Sources five and six stated that the "coroner"
pronounced that the "jury" had found the BPP survivors
innocent of any crime and that the raiders were guilty
of murder. The “coroner" reportedly remarked that we
the people now ask for appropriate action by the state
and hold States Attorney Edward Hanrahan and his police
in contempt of the people,

Both sources stated that the "inquest" was
actually a complete faroe and could not have been accurate
as to detail inasmuch as it was based entirely on information
of the survivors of the raid.

A source has advised that the Students for a Democratic
Society (SDS), as presently regarded, came into being at a
founding convention held June, 1962, at Port Nuron, Michigan.
From an initial posture of "participatory democracy" the Line
of the national leadership has revealed a growing Marxist—
Leninist adherence which currently calls for the building of
a revolutionary youth movement. Concurrently, the program
of SDS has evolved from civil rights struggles to an anti-
Vietnam war stance to an advocacy of a militant anti~imperialist
position. China, Vietnam and Cuba are regarded as the Leaders

. of worldwide struggles against United States imperialism whereas

the Soviet Union is held to be revisionist and also imperialist.

At the June, 1969, SDS National Convention, Progressive
Labor Party (PLP) forces in the organization were expelled.
As a result, the National Office (NO) group maintained its
National Headquarters at 1608 West Madison Street, Chicago,
and the PLP faction set up headquarters in Cambridge,
Massachusetts, This headquarters subsequently moved to
Boston. Each group elected its own national officers, which
include three national secretaries and a National Interim
Committee of eight. Both the NO forces and the PLP forces
claim to be the true SDS, Both groups also print their
versions of "New Left Notes" which sets forth the line and the
program of the particular faction. The NO version of "New
Left Notes" was recently printed undor the title "The Fire
Next Time" to achieve a broader mass appeal.

Two major factions have developed internally within
the NO group, namely, the Weatherman or Revolutionary Youth
Movement (RYH) I faction, and the RYM If faction, Weatherman
is action-oriented upholding Castro's position thut the duty
of revolutionaries is to make revolution. Weatherman is
regarded by RYM II as an adventuristic, elitist faction which
denies the historical role of the working class as the base

-for revolution, RYM II maintains that revolution, although
desired, is not possible under present conditions, hence

emphasizes organizing and raising the political consciousness
of the working class upon whom they feel successful revolution
depends, Although disclaiming control and domination by the
Communist Party, USA, leaders in these two factions have in --
the past proclaimed themselves to be communists and to follow
the precepts of a Marxist-Leninist philosophy, along pro~
Chinese communist lines,

A second source has advised that the PLP faction which
is more commonly known as the Worker Student Alliance is dominated
and controlled by members of the PLP, who are required to
identify themselves with the pro-Chinese Marxist-Leninist
Philosophy of the PLP, They advocate that an alliance between ,
workers and students is vital to the bringing about of a
revolution in the United States.

SDS regions and university and college chapters,
elthcugh operating under the outlines of the SDS National
Constitution, are autonomous in nature and free to carry out
independent policy reflective of local conditions. Because

. of this autonomy internal struggles reflecting the major factional
. dnterests of SDS have occurred at the chapter level since

PROGRESSIVE LABOR PARTY

The “New York Times" city edition, Tuesday, April 20,
1965, page 27, reported that a new party of "revolutionary
socialism” was formally founded on April 18, 1965, under the
name of the Progressive Labor Party (PLP) which had been known
as the Progressive Labor Movement,

According to the article, “The Progressive Labor
Movement was founded in 1962, by MILTON ROSEN and MORTIMER
SCHEER after they were expelled from the Communist Party of the

~ United States for assertedly following the Chinese Communist
“line,"

A source advised on June 3, 1968, that the PLP held
its Second National Convention in New York City, May 31 to
June 2, 1968, at which time the PLP reasserted its objective
of the establishment of a militant working class movement

“ pased on Marxism-Leninism, This is to be accomplished through
the Party's over-all revolutionary strategy of raising the
consciousness of the people and helping to provide ideological
leadership in the working class struggle for state power.

The source also advised that at the Second National
. Convention MILTON ROSEN was unanimously re-elected National
Chairman of the PLP and LEVI LAUB, FRED JEROME, JARED ISRAEL
WILLIAM EPTON, JACOB ROSEN, JEFFREY GORDON, and WALTER LINDER
were elected as the National Committee to lead the PLP until
the next convention.

The PLP publishes "Progressive Labor," a bimonthly
magazine; “World Revolution," a quarterly periodical; and
"Challenge-Desafio,” a monthly newspaper.

The April, 1969, issue of "Challenge-Desafio" sets ©
forth that "Challenge is dedicated to the peoples fight for a
“new way of life--where the working men and women control their
own homes and factories; where they themselves make up the entire
government on every level and control the schools,’ courts, police
and all institutions which are now used to control them."

Source advised on May 8, 1969, that the PLP utilizes
an address of General Post Office Box 808, Brooklyn, New York,

10, 1969, Their appearance on campus was sponsored by the
Black Students Association and Students For A Democratic Society.
The audience was racially mixed numbering between two hundred and
three hundred but including only about twelve white people, BPP
security ‘guards were stationed at each of the four doors to the
lecture hall in the Natural History Building where the above
individuals spoke. Photographs were discouraged by Brother O'Neal,
the BPP security officer and an unidentified "Daily Illini"
photographer who persisted in efforts to take photographs was
escorted from the room. Several whites left the meeting late in
the evening when Hampton indicated they might do so if they wished.
Later, Hampton and Rush instructed all whites to leave the room,
which they did, prior to the holding of a strategy session about
the ot eae

Intemperate language was common and the tone threatening.
Diane Dunn, who is married to another member of BPP and six months
pregnant, was quoted as stating that she could "whip any three
honki in the room." In clearing the room of all whites at the
end of the meeting, Brother O'Neal reportedly said, “We might have
a job to do here, if-you honkies don't get out right now." Hampton
advised blacks to arin themselves because "there's no telling when
thé mad dog white is going to bite you and give you rabies." Rush
reportedly quoted Mao Tse-~tung stating political power flows from
the barrel of a gun,"

Rush presented a ten point program of black demands in-
cluding the following:

In commenting on ‘military service, Rush said they “were
not going to circulate petitions or burn draft cards. He added
"when they cone for us, we gonna give them.a gun." Rush said that
he regretted a seeming lack of cooperation between campus and

7 comunity blacks relating to the current black issue and stated
- "I notice the black students here don't relage with the black

on blacks to reject capitalism-as offered by the white man
stating "if a white man offers you.black capitalism, don't take

Diane Dunn spoke of the role of the black woman in the
"revolution" stating as follows:

"The role of the: black woman is-to push her man, to .~
be behind him all the Way. Without a woman, he is nothing."

CK PANTHER PAR’

BI

According to its official newspaper, the Black Panther Party
(BPP) was started during December, 1966, in Oakland, California, to
organize black people so they can take control of the life, politics, and the
destiny of the black community. It was organized by Bobby George Seale,
BPP Chairman, and Huey P. Newton, BPP Minister of Defense. Newton
is presently serving a sentence u; 2 to 15 years on a conviction of man-
slaughter in connection with the killing of an Oakland police officer.

The official newspaper, "The Black Panther," which further
describes itself as the "Black Commumty News Service," states that the
BPP advocates the use of guns and guerrilla tactics in its revolutionary
program to end oppression of the black people. Residents of the black
community are urged to. arm themselves against the police who are con-
-sistently referred to in the publication as "pigs" who should be killed.

"The Black Panther" issue of September 7, 1968, contains an
editorial by BPP Minister of Education, George Mason Murray, which
ends with the following:

“Black men. Black people, colored persons of America,
revolt everywhere! Arm yourselves. The only culture worth keeping
is a revolutionary culture. Change. Freedom everywhere. Dynamite!

. Black Power. Use the gun. Kill the pigs everywhere."
; Included in the introduction lo an article appearing in the

October 5, 1968, edition of "The Black Panther" is the statement, "...
we will not dissent from American Government. We will overthrow it."

Issues of "The Black Panther" regularly contain quotations
from the writings of Chairman MAO Tse-tung of the People's Republic
of China and feature MAO's statement that "political power grows out of
the barrel of a gun."
. The national headquarters of the BPP is located at 3106 Shattuck
Avenue; Berkeley, California. Branches have been established at
various locations throughout the United States.

the following is to’ be- noted:

On January 14, 1969, _ who has furnished
reliable information in "the. past, advised that he had
determined that a meeting was held on January 11, 1969,
at the Douglas Center, a youth center at Champaign,
Illinois, at which John Lee Johnson was trying to develop
interest in the organizing of a BPP chapter at Champaign-
Urbana, Illinois. related that reliable information
had come to his attention that although Johnson was
attempting to establish himself as a local leader of
Black Panthers, the local leader would probably be Stevie
dackson, or Alonso Mitchell, further advised that
at 6:00" p.m. on January 11, 1969, Stevie Jackson and
Alonze Mitchell had a meeting at the Chief Illini Motel,
Urbana, Illinois, with representatives of the BPP from
“Chicago, Illinois.

The January 14, 1969, issue of the "Courier", a
Champaign-Urbana, Illinois, newspaper, on page 3, reported
that University of Illinois officials apparently will x
examine events surrounding the visit of three members of the
Illinois BPP last weekend to see if campus space use
regulations were violated.

was quoted as saying that Vic Berkey, SDS President, had
made the reservation for a public lecture by Rush, the
Illinois Panthers’ Deputy Minister of Defense and "Hampton,
Deputy State Chairman. (See Appendix regarding SDS).

According to Berkey, the event was arranged in
elose Sponsorship with the Black Students ap eeee (BSA) ,
although SDS.issued the official invitation,

The article quoted. David Addison, BSA President,

as saying that his group was involved only in a "perfunctory"

way. Addison stated that "our role largely was confined to
aking contacts between SDS and black students on campus”.

.-.. Page 3 of the same issue of the "Courier" also
reported that John Lee Johnson, a community organizer in
Champaign's North End, denied Honday a statement attributed
to him in Saturday's * courier” about recruiting members
jocally for the BPP, :

Johnson said he asked only how many persons
present would be willing to join the party Monday morning,
and did not invite anyone interested in membership to
see hin.

Commenting on the appearance here of representatives
of the Chicago-based Illinois BPP, Johnson indicated his -
personal feeling is that the Panthers represent “nothing new",
and that "black people all over must be willing to exercise
all resources to achieve freedom".

The article continued to quote Johnson as saying,

- "There is no need for a beret or a black jacket in order

to attain this’. "If there is a decision that a Panther
Party is to be the uniform organization of Champaign County,
black people themselves shail determine that, net I".

a student newspaper of the University of Illinois, Champaign-

BLACK PANTHER PARTY (BPP.

Urbana, Illinois, on page 3, reported that Vic Berkey,
member of SDS, dismissed rumors of his "abduction" by
two Black Panther members as "baseless". The article
continued as follows:

The rumors began Friday after Berkey had a
meeting with Illinois Black Panthers, Fred Hampton and
Bob Rush. _ Hampton and Rush had agreed to speak on
campus but had been promised a certain amount of money
for doing’ so. ~

7 Berkey said that the Chicago Regional SDS
“implied a commitment that we weren't aware-of". Although
the money promised Hampton and Rush "began at $1000
because that is the way you do things", Berkey said that
the commitment. is now substantially less. He would not
reveal’ the sum-.of money that SDS owes the Panthers, but
he said that SDS organisationally will fulfill its’ commit
ment, “as we always do”.

‘When Hampton and Rush arrived on campus and

" found that the money was net forthcoming, they were upset

and Berkey went into a meeting with them to try and
straighten things out. The Panthers were also angry
because some black’ students were supposed to arrange
housing for them and failed to do so. 7

” Daring the time that Berkey was out of communi-
cation, rumors began to arise that he had been abducted
because of the failure to pay Hampton and Rush. Berkey
said that the Panthers and SDS enjoy a gocd relationship
put that people often do not know how to relate to the —

’ Panthers. Berkéy said, "they “have done the best organizing
. o£ any black group in Chicago, but many people still
- attribute to them the characteristics and actions of a

street gang".

“ On January 16, 1969, , who has furnished
reliable information in the past, advised that on January 14,
1969, John Lee Johnson, held a ‘meeting at. the Douglas Center,

STUDENT NONVIOLENT COORDINATING COMMITTEE (SNCC)

The Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC),
headquartered at 360-332 Melson Streat, 3. ¥., Atlanta, Georgia,
ig a nonnenbership organization, which was born out of the
sit-in movement that erupted across the South beginning

. in 1960.

Today SNCC identifies itself as an organization in
the revolutionary vanguard. It advocates that to be successful
it is necessary to develep a revolutionary ideology and’
revolutionary progran.

According to SHCC the year 1967 marked a historic
milestone in the struggle for the liberation of black people
in the United States and the year that revolutionaries
throughout the world began to understand more fully the impsst
of the black movement. SHCC daclared that "libsration will
| come only when there is final destruction of this mad octugus—~
the capitalistic systaa o? the United States with all ita
life-sucking tentacles of exploitation and racism that choxe
the people of Africa, Asia, and Latim America. The realities
of black life, together with the recognition instilled in SNCC
workers forced its members to further popularize ths legitimacy
of self-defense and rebellions when oppression becrme too great.”

From May, 1966, until May, 1967, Stokely Carmichael
wag National Chairman of SNCC. As of suly, 1968, Carmichael
resided in Washington, BD, C., wherg he was affiliated with
SNCC and active as temporary chairman of a black coalition
group. In May, 1967, Carmichael was replaced by Hubert Geroid
Brown, commonly known a8 H. Rap Brown, who served until
June, 1968. 7

In June, 1968, at the Staff and Central Committea
meeting of SNCC held in Atlanta, Georgia, it was decided to
restructure the organization by equalization of responsibility
by Greating ten deputy-or vice chairmanships. The primary 7
purpose for this change is to take jaw enforcement pressure off
any single individual.

at the meeting was overwhelmingly white with only a
smattering of Negroes.

This source stated that Frederick Hampton, who
arrived at the meeting late,was the final speaker. He.
enumerated the 10. point program of the Black Panther Party.
He said that whatever white people advocate, blacks should
oppose and blacks should bear arms only against whites.

He added that peace is possible only through a gun barrel
and if a white comes to him bearing arms he will lay him
out.

A white girl in the audience asked Hampton if
he was advocating killing whites and getting guns to
dét against “whites When he answered in the affirmative,
She Said “Aré wé that bad?"He“then related how blacks
have been treated by whites and that they would no longer
stand it. She asked how blacks expected to accomplish :
this since they are a minority race. He said"That's a lie"
and he began to scream at hey calling her a “hippie” and
then asked her if she wanted him to make love to her. She.
began to weep and left the hall.

‘A white male listener, referring to statements
about military force, asked Hampton if they really had guns.
He answered "I'm not going to tell you what we have but
don't fool with us." When the man asked other questions,
Hampton told him to leave as the girl did.

: The audience then became excited and began
- asking questions at all panelists without first being
_ recognized, . Many shouted their displeasure at the tone and

among individuals who were close to the Socialist Workers
Party (SWP).

The YSA-C as of November, 1959, proclaimed itself
to be a city-wide revolutionary youth organization designed
to build socialism in America and aimed toward youth on
college campuses in the Chicago area and as being independent
of all arial groupings.

YSA-C- was considered the youth, group of the Chicago Branch
SWP and af ated with the national ofganization of the YSA
in New York. The YSA-C officers as of April, 1968, were
current members of the Chicago SWP.

BLACK PANTHER PARTY

According to its official newspaper, the Black Panther Party
(BPP) was started during December, 1966, in Oakland, California, to
organize black people so they can take control of the life, politics, and the
destiny of the black community. It was organized by Bobby George Seale,
BPP Chairman, and Huey P. Newton, BPP Minister of Defense. Newton
is presently serving a sentence o: 2 to 15 years on a conviction of man-
slaughter in connection with the killing of an Oakland police officer.

The official newspaper, ''The Black Panther," which further
describes itself as the "Black Community News Service," states that the
BPP advocates the use of guns and guerrilla tactics in its revolutionary
program to end oppression of the black people. _ Residents of the black
community are urged to arm themselves against the police who are con-
sistently referred to in the publication as "pigs" who should be killed,

"The Black Panther" issue of September 7, 1968, contains an
editorial by BPP Minister of Education, George Mason Murray, which
ends with the following:

"Black men. Black people, colored persons of America,
revolt everywhere! Arm yourselves. The only culture worth keeping
is a revolutionary culture. Change. Freedom everywhere. Dynamite!

jack Power. Use the gun. Kill the pigs everywhere." 7 .

Included in the introduction to an article appearing in the
October 5, 1968, edition of "The Black Panther" is the statement, "...
we will not dissent from American Government. We will overthrow it."

Issues of "The Black Panther" regularly contain quotations
from the writings of Chairman MAO Tse-tung of the People's Republic
of China and feature MAO's statement that "political power grows out of
the barrel of a gun."

« The national headquarters of the BPP is located at 3106 Shattuck
Avenue, Berkeley, California, Branches have been established at
various locations throughout the United States.

arrest, Ivory bragged to a group at the dinner of how he (Ivory)
had led the Maywood Negro youths to the Village Hall on July 30,

wants Negroes to stop stealing from other Negroes and committing

so that the trial will be the BPP against the state which will
result in great publicity for the BPP and its goals.

Informant furnished the following information on
May 6, 1969; :

There was a Black Panther Party (BPP) meeting at
ROBERT BRUCE’s house on the evening of May 2, 1969. Present
were FRED HAMPTON, BRUCE, WALTER ALLEN, GREGORY PERKINS,
TYRONE GLADNEY, MATTHEW ANGRUM, NEAL THOMAS and DAVID VALENTINE.
Several other young Negro males were present whose identities
are unknown to the informant. PERKINS claimed he had talked
to the owner of the Tastee-Freeze at 12th and Madison
and the owner said he would drop the charges against PERKINS
and LEN WATTS for the damage they had done, The case comes
up in court on May 21, 1969. ‘i

There was a meeting of the BPP at BRUCE’s house on
May 5, and the same individuals were present as on May 2.
The informant stated that some of the older, married members,
like CARSWELL, the WADE brothers seemed to have become afraid
of coming to the meeting and afraid of possible future
trouble because d their involvément with the BPP. " He stated
some of these members may drop out.

The informant also noted that NATHANIAL JUNIOR was
not present. Informant heard that the trouble in Summit-Argo
wherein the woman was burned and beaten arose because she would
not produce a gun she had been keeping for someone else.

Informant heard from a former girl friend in Summit
that NATHANIAL JUNIOR was trying to kill the woman and a boy.
One DENNIS HARVEY, also of Summit was with JUNIOR and HAMPTON
was giving orders. During the torture and beating JUNIOK and the
others were scared off when they heard someone coming.

At the meeting on May 5, 1969, BRUCE and ALLEN
stated that if HAMPTON is sentenced on May 13, to a term in prison
they were going to try to blow up Lhe Maywood Police station .



; There will be a BPP trial on this coming Friday
night May 9, 1969, for FRED HAMPTON, This trial is in

keeping with the BPP rules that say that a BPP member

must be tried by black persons of his own standing in the
community and the trial in court with white judges and

juries is an improper trial. The time and place d the

trial are not yet known but present will be members of the BPP
from Chicago, Summit, Maywood and possibly California.

HAMPTON expressed hope tnat BOBBY SEALE would also be there.

HAMPTON continues to want Sergeant SAMSON to be the
next Chief of Police, There is a rumor around Maywood,
however, that Captain WILBERT SAMUAL will be appointed.
HAMPTON doesn't want him to be the Chief of Police,
because he is not a Negro,

Black Panther advocate

Carolyn Rodgers, Negro female
-black poetess

W,. C. Anas Luqman, Negro male
Leader of the Malcolm X Black Hand Society of
the World, Inc.

On May 20, 1969, a second source, who has fur-
nished reliable information in the past, furnished the
following information to a representative of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI):

ir Source advised that approximately 300 persons
attended a memorial celebration for Malcolm X at the
Capitol Theater. Source stated that W, C, Anas Luqman

was the first speaker and he spoke concerning the necessity
of all black people to unite together, stating that Malcolm
X was the beginning of this black unity movement which

is set up to lead the blacks out of ignorance and into
vitalized lives. Luqman described Malcolm X as a "black
prince"

Source continued that Russ Meek spoke at great
lengths about the necessity of blacks having to start
getting together and stop selling out to the whites.
Meek's comments concerned blacks getting arms and learning
such things as karate to help kill the oppressors. Meek
spoke about each Negro becoming acquainted with his
neighbors so that he may seek shelter and hiding when
whites move against him. Meek stated that all blacks
were not helping their black brothers and the white
man can still overpower the Negro and throw: him in jail
any time he wants to. Meek spoke concerning the Black
Panther Party (BPP), and the fact that this party has
scared many whites who do not know where they will
strike next.

RE: MALCOLM X BLACK HAND SOCIETY OF THE WORLD, INC.

. Source indicated that various honorary awards
were granted to Negroes in attendance and these awards
presented; by the Malcolm X Black Hand Society of the
World, Inc., went to Dick Gregory, Huey Newton, and
Bobby Seale, both BPP members and which awards were
accepted by Fred Hampton.. Several other of these
awards were given to persons who the source could not
identify.

A characterization of the BPP is ittached.

Source advised that Carolyn Rodgers read
some of her poems, two of which were entitled "T Ain't
Seen ‘Nothin! Yet" and "Poem. For Malcolm",

Source identified Fred Hampton of the Chicago
BPP as the next speaker and Hampton expressed his
great love and respect for Malcolm X and for his philo-
sophies, stating that Malcolm X had gone to the mountain
top but had come back to realize that he was still a
“suppressed nigger". Hampton stated that Malcolm X
saw that change was necessary and from that point in
Hampton's speech, he gave a typical BPP speech concerning.
the necessity for Negroes arming themselves to beat
back the oppressor. Hampton concluded by stating that __
he was a révolutionary, with the comments "all power
to the people, all power to the BPP, Panther power",

Source stated that Dick Gregory was the last
Speaker but limited his comments to the necessity for
black people organizing themselves in their own behalf
and indicated he was in Sympathy with the BPP.

Source advised that because of inclement
weather, the scheduled picnic to precede the evening
rally at the Capitol Theater did not take place, other
than a few members of the Malcolm X Black Hand Society

ORGANIZATION OF AFRO-AMERICAN UNITY,
INCORPORATED (OAAU) : i

On June 28,1964, MALCOLM X LITTLE, founder and leader
of the Muslim Mosque, Incorporated (MMI), publicly announced the
formation of a new, all Negro, militant civil rights action group
to be known as the Organization of Afro-American Unity (OAAU),
with himself as Chairman. This announcement..was made at a public
rally held by the MMI in the Audubon Ballroom, Broadway and 166th

+ Stréet, New York City.

A printed and published statement of basic OAAU aims read
by MALCOLM X at this meeting indicates that it shall include "all"
people of African descent in the Western Hemisphere, as well as
"our" brothers and sisters on the African continent. Itis patterned
after the "letter and spirit" of the Organization of African Unity
established (by African heads of States) at Addis Ababa, Ethiopia,
in May, 1963.

A recording of the remarks of MALCOLM X at this meeting
indicates that the aim of the OAAU is to eliminate differences
between Negroes so they can work together for "human rights,"
while the initial objective 1s to "internationalize" the American
civil rights movement by taking it to the United Nations. LITTLE
condemned the non-violent civil rights movement and claims that .-
Negroes should be taught to protect themselves, when and if
necessary. The OAAU will sponsor a program for Negroes in
education, politics, culture, economics, and social reform.

MALCOLM X was assassinated on February 21, 1965, while
addressing an OAAU rally at the Audubon Ballroom, New York City.

On April 13, 1965, a confidential source advised that
on March 26, 1965, the OAAU filed a Certificate of Incorporation
with the Department of State, State of New York, Albany, New York,
and henceforth, the orgapization's true name will be Organization
of Afro-American Unity, Incorporated,

On April 29, 1968, a second confidential source advised
that the president and head of the OAAU is ELLA COLLINS, a half
sister of the late MALCULM X, who resides a great majority of the
time in Boston, Massachusetts.

On April 28, 1968, this same source advised. that the OAAU
headquarters is still located at 224 West 139th Street, New York,
New York. Meetings have not been held in several months and the
organization appears to be breaking up and nu longer functioning.

BLACK PANTHER PARTY

According to its official newspaper, the Black Panther Party’
(BPP) was started during December, 1966, in Oaklana, California, to
organize black people so they can take control of the life. politics, and the
destiny of the black community. It was organized by Bobby George Seale,
BPP Chairman, and Huey P. Newton, BPP Minister of Defense. Newton
is presently serving a sentence vi 2 to 15 years on a conviction gf man-
slaughter in connection with the killing of an Oakland police officer.

The official newspaper, "The Black Panther," which further
describes itself as the "Black Community News Service," states that the
BPP advocates the use of guns and guerrilla tactics in-its revolutionary
program to end oppression of the black people. Residents of the black
community are urged to arm themselves against the police who are con-
sistently referred to in the publication as "pigs" who should be killed.

"The Black Panther" issue of September 7, 1968, contains an
editorial by BPP Minister of Education, George Mason Murray, which
ends with the following: 7

"Black men. Black people, colored persons of America,
revolt everywhere! Arm yourselves. The only culture worth keeping
is a revolutionary culture. Change. Freedom everywhere. Dynamite!
Black Power. Use the gun. Kill the pigs everywhere."

Included in the introduction to an article appearing in the
October 5, 1968, edition of "The Black Panther" is the statement, "......
we will not dissent from American Government. We will overthrow it."

Issues of "The Black Panther" regularly contain quotations’
from the writings of Chairman MAO Tse-tung of the People's Republic
of China and feature MAO's statement that "political power grows out of
the barrel of a gun."

The national headquarters of the BPP is located at 3106 Shattuck
Avenue, Berkeley, California. Branches have been established at
various locations throughout the United States.

Restaurant on 5th Avenue in Maywood on the night of May 28,

held in the old photo store next to the restaurant which is

ROBERT BRUCE is now too scared to do anything
and it appears he wants to bé less involved in the BPP.

PERKINS and THOMAS BLAIR planned to visit
HAMPTON in jail, date unknown.

During the weekend of May 3i-June 1, 3 or 4
BPP members went around in Maywood and got 200 names on
a petition to free FRED HAMPTON. HAMPTON's older brother,
MURTHY WADE, "BOBBY" CARSWELL and NEAL THOMAS, are the
ones who obtained the petitions. F i

CARSWELL said that "TACO CHARLIE" has promised
to get ammunition for the BPP. He apparently has a
ecard of some type which enables him to buy guns and
ammunition. He seems to do everything CARSWELL asks
him to do.

Informant advised on June 6, 1969:

There was a meeting on June 5, 1969, at the home
of GENE MOORE, 1423 South 11th Avenue. He is a supporter
of FRED HAMPTON, but not a member of the BPP.

About 50 Negroes were present, mostly BPP
members and they were all angry about the FBI raid on
BPP headquarters in Chicago.

The discussion centered around the fact that
the raid must have been set up by someone inside. Trey
also claimed the purpose of the raid was to get the
petitions for HAMPTON's release so he would be kept
in jail. They were all angry about the "theft" of the
money and typewriters by the FBI,

CARSWELL said that NATHANIEL JUNIOR and HARVEY
had left the headquarters two days before the raid and
had "gone south",

The BPP does not trust "TACO CHARLIE". Some
members feel he will eventually turn against the Negroes

A new petition will be circulated by the BPP
to get DUFFY removed from the Maywood PD. He is the
officer who testified against HAMPTON at his recent
trial.

A rally is planned for FRED HAMPTON on

All will be invited and money will be collected for

PAUL WADE spoke and said they should all go to
where HAMPTON is and break him out of jail. He also said
that if the police invade any Negro homes that the Negroes
should shoot it out with the police if they are entering

STUDENTS FOR A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY

A source has advised that the Students for a Democratic
Society (SDS), as presently regarded, came into being at a founding
conventionheld June, 1962, at Port Huron, Michigan. From an initial
posture of "participatory democracy" the line of the national leadership
has revealed a growing Marxist-Leninist adherence which currently
calls for the building of a revolutionary youth movement. Concurrently, .
the program of SDS‘has evolved from civil rights strugzles to an anti-
Vietnam war stance to an advocacy of a militant anti-iraperialist position.
China, Vietnam and Cuba are regarded as the leaders of worldwide
struggles against United States imperialism whereas the Soviet Union
is held to be revisionist and also imperial

- At the June, 1969, SDS National Convention, Progressive

Labor Party (PLP) forces in the organization were expelled. Asa
result, the National Office (NO) group maintained its National Head-
quarters at 1608 West Madison Street, Chicago, and the PLP faction
set up headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts. This headquarters
subsequently moved to Boston, Each group elected its own national,
officers, which include three national secretaries and a National

, Interim Committee of eight. Both the NO forces and the PLP forces
claim to be the true SDS. Both groups also print their versions of
"New Left Notes" which sets forth the line and the program of the
particular faction. The NO version of "New Left Notes" was recently
printed under the title The Fire Next Time" to achieve a broader mass
appeal.

"Two major factions have developed internally within the

_NO group, namely, the Weatherman or Revolutionary Youth Movement
(RYM) I faction, and the RYM JI faction. Weatherman is action-oriented
upholding Castro's position that the duty of revolutionaries is to make

revolution. Weatherman is regarded by RYM Il as an adventuristic

elitist faction which denies the historical role of the working class as

the base for revolution. RYM J maintains that revolution, although
desired, is not possible under present conditions, hence emphasizes
organizing and raising the political consciousness of the working class
upon whom they feel successful revolution depends. Although disclaiming
control and domination by the Communist Party, USA, leaders in these two
factions have in the past proclaimed themselves to be communists and

to follow the precepts of a Marxist-Leninist philosophy, along pro~-
Chinese commiunist lines,

A second source has advised that the PLP faction which
is more commoniy known as the Worker Student Alliance is dominated
and controlled by members of the PLP, who are required to identify
themselves with the pro-Chinese Marxist-Leninist philosophy of the
PLP, They advocate that an alliance between workers and students .
is vitai to the bringing about of a revolution in the United States.

SDS regions and university and coliege chapters, although
operating under the outlines of the SDS National Constitution, are
autonoxous in nature and free to carry out independent policy reflective

of local conditions. Because of this autonomy internal struggles
reflecting the major factional interests of SDS have occurred at the
chapter level since the beginning of the 1969-70 school year.

A characterization of PLP is attached.

class movement based on Marxism-Leninism, This is to be
accomplished through the Party's over-all revolutionary
strategy of raising the consciousness of the people and
helping to provide ideological leadership in the. working
class struggle for state power.

The source also advised that at the Second National
Convention Milton Rosen was unanimously re-elected National
Chairman of the PLP and Levi Laub, Fred Jerome, Jared israel,
William Epton, Jacob Rosen, Jeffrey Gordon, and Walter Linder
were elected as the National Committee to lead the PLP until
the next convention.

“The PLP publishes "Progressive Labor," a khimonthly
magazine;' "World Revolution," a quarterly periodical; and
"Challenge-Desafio," a monthly newspaper.

The April, 1969, issue of "Challenge-Desafio"” sets
forth that "Challenge is dedicated to the peoples fight for
a new way of lifeé--where the working men and women control
their own homes and factories; where they themselves make
‘up the entire government. on every level and control the
schools, courts, police and all institutions which are now
beak to control them,"

On Api tl 27, 1969, the above persons arrived at -
the Black Panther Party (BPP) headquarters, 2350 West Madison
Street, and found O'NEAL and SMILEY already present. This
happened about 12:00 noon or 1:00 p.m. énd they arrived in
BRUCE's Pontiac.

ROBERT BRUCE, FRED HAMPTON, BOB RUSH

BRUCE telephoned HAMPTON and told him that the Model
10 police shotgun was missing and they had brought the girl to
the office. HAMPTON, according to BRUCE, said he would be right
over. About this time, RUSH called the otfice and said that
he would be right over. He was advised of the above.

DENNIS HARVEY, WILLIAM O'NEAL, WILMER
ANGRUM, DAVID VALENTINE, JAMES WHITE,
ALBERT MACKEY —

HARVEY told the above group to go arrest MACKEY and
bring him back to the office. ANGRUM took a .32 automatic;
VALENTINE took a .25 or .32 automatic; O'NEAL took HARVEY's
.38 Rohrn caliber and WHITE took a sawed off shotgun. This
group | left in VALENTINE's white 1959 Ford.

It is alleged that upon arrival at MACKEY's hone,

WHITE got out of the car with his shotgun in his pants and
: went to MACKEY's door, He returned to the car because no one

answered the door. :
?
This car proceeded around the corner, " stopped and
WHITE had ANGRUM get out to watch the house while the rest
proceeded to the corner of 63rd and the main street of Argo
where WHITE made a phone call to the BPP office, 2350 West
Madison.

WHITE returned after a very short time because a i
police car went in the direction of MACKEY'’s home. VALENTINE
suggested that the occupants' weapons be left at Brooker T's

Tavern because the bartender there is ‘a friend of Argo area

'S. However, the suggestion was not heeded a.
ceric in probecded toa spot’ around the corner where Adchha had
previously been let cut. 7 7

A person identified as MACKEY by one of the occu-
pants vas walking toward a police squad car as VALENT{NE's
ear passed HACKEY's residence.

When VALENTINE's vehicle stopxed, ANGRUM ran and
jumped into the vehicle.

En route to Argo, O'NEAL was allegedly filled in
on what had already taken place and why they were to arrest
MACKEY. It seems that a model ten shotyun, a police shotgun,
had been left in the possession of MACKHY's friend, name not
mentioned, but who was currently out of town, and when the
Panthers went to this friend's family, they were told that
MACKEY had the gun.

ROBERT BRUCE, COUNT, DENNIS HARVEY, MARGIE
CURRY, JAMES WHITE, NATHANIEL JUNIOR, R{CHARD
POWELL

The above group, except possibly JUNIOR and POWELL,
went into MACKEY's residence and beat him up because he would
not produce the gun they were looking for. This group also
took his shotgun.

MACKEY named MARGIE CURRY as the person having the
gun, The group left MACKEY in Argo and brought CURRY back
to the office at 2350 West Madison.

JAMES WHITE

Upon the arrest of WHITE, he called the BPP Head-
quarters, 2350 West Madison, and related that they had been
arrested, you know what to do.

It was later learned that WHITE's mother had gone
to the BPP office relating to them that WHITE was weakening
and had told her that he was not taking this rap alone. The
Panthers became afraid that he may talk and are concerned
about this. His mother also told the Panthers that he is
now a Muslim.

As a resuit,the Panthers are no longer Pree tne
his defense.
