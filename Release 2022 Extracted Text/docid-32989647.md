The above source indicated that following the speeches,

Hampton further challenged the blacks to take the initiative

in bringing about the change instead of relying on whites to

change things for them.. Hampton also stated that revolution

was imminent,

BLACK PANTHER PARTY

A second confidential source of the Milwaukee Office,

who has furnished reliable information in the past, furnished

the following information on April 30, 1969:

On March 27, 1969, he determined that the Dominican

College, Racine,

Wisconsin,

was sponsoring a program this

evening

to be held at Breakers Building, and that the program

was to spotlight Negro culture. It was noted that at the.

parking lot around Breakers Building were parked numerous

vehicles bearing Illinois and Wisconsin License plates.

The program was attended by an undetermined number

of students, most of whom were young whites, men and women.

Many.appeared to be "hippies," and there were several who

appeared to be part of the staff at the College. An unidentified

Negro female took charge of the program, and she announced

that the program would entail a short skit to show the negro

image as it had been in the

past and then a talk and a discussion

would be presented by Chicago Black. Panther members to show the

present day Negro status.

The skit was a highly emotional

two-part presentation depicting the slave factions on the

plantation and the beating of a colored girl with a leather

strap by a white slave master. Much reference was made to

"Niggers" and to "Dirty Niggers." Much hysterical praying

and crying was done by the sole

Negro female participant in

the play.

Following the play, several unidentified Black

Panthers then showed a newsreel, which depicted all the

various modern police weapons, including tear gas, mace,

and the new Smith and Wesson dart tranquilizer guns.

The

movie depicted various riot situations, but the sounds being

made by participants were largely inaudible. Nevertheless,

various distinct statements were made by people in the film

in reference to what was being done to a

Negro femade.

They

said she was beaten in the head by a policeman and then someone

said that a Negro male had been shot in the back by a policeman.

Subsequent to the film, a young unidentified Negro

male, who was introduced as the

Security Agent for the Black

Panthers, arose and stated that "Sh

=- Is going to hit the fan

this summer."

He stated Racine is isolated from Chicago.by

distance, but that the members of Chicago Black Panthers

had come to help them organize at Racine. He then introduced

the Secretary of the BPP, a Negro female, whose name source

could not recall, who discussed the meaning of the aforementioned

IIlm. She was then responsible for showing a second film

which depicted the ten point program of the Black Panthers.

She expressed to the crowd a displeasure with them because

she heard some snickering regarding some of the points depicted

in this film, particularly the points that all Negroes should

be freed from prisons at once,

no matter the crime, and that

they should all be draft exempt.

The source indicated that during the sneach by

the Security Chief of the Black Panthers, he welcomed all

the students to the meeting as well

as "all the FbI, CIA,

and PD personnel" that might be in the group.

The above soufce left the meeting as it was breaking

up, and he indicated that no incidents-were reported during

the meeting or subsequent-to the meeting. He indicated further

that he had observed some of the vehicles parked at the College

and had noted some propaganda material lying on the seats of

some of the automobiles.

He indicated specifically that he

had seen a stack of papers from the People Free Republic

of China and other books entitled simply, "Propaganda."

The above source advised further on this date that

the visit by the Black Panthers at the College had been paid

by the Student Council of Dominican College.

This money

was allegedly raised through collections.

This money was also

to pay for Black Panther newspapers and other literature which

had been passed out by the six Black Panther members who had

attended the meeting.

The following two articles by RUFUS WALLS,

who is the Minister of Information, Chicago Chapter

BPP, appeared in the first spring semester edition

of the "Phoenix"

• an

underground-type newspaper

published by Negro militants at Crane Junior Coliege,

2250 West Van Buren, Chicago, Illinois. The newspaper

was distributed on Crane campus on February 12, 1969.

"BLACK CAPITALISM

"First, we must understand the true term used for

Capitalism.

It denotes the economic system set up by.

Flanders in the 13th century and Florence in the l4th

century which mainly was long distance trading. Their

histories shed light on

the conditions as developed

by the total Western World. The English woolen in~

dustry really spearheaded Capitalism as a social and

economic system for private profit until it became the

roots of all evils. The selfish owners expanded

their means of production hy creating civil wars,

murdering. and raping Asia, Africa, Latin America

and

even their own motherland while America assisted

in

the most barbaric acts ever

perpetrated by man

"Under Capitalism, all decisions concerning pro-

duction and who will get the profit is always made

by the rich (sic) In America, it is a handful of

White Anglo-Saxons (JOHNSONS,

KENNEDYS, ROCKEFELLERS,

and a few more) who are making decisions for all ethnic

groups.

Under Capitalism,

the working class. (95%)

have no choice but to sell their energy or better yet

their backs for token economic gains.

In order to be

a Capitalist, one must have capital and Black People

have no capital nor own any means of production.

He are a Capitalist people! We are a landless

people:

He are the poorest of the poor.

Why are we in this

bag? Historically the Black colony was created for

the purpose of super-exploitation.

Being a product

of the system--a system that enslaved our forefather--a

system that burned Black people alive, lynched and

- 6 .

## Page 53

crushed pregnant Black women. to death? A system that

keeps us on a reservation and the bureaucrats who

uphold and perpetuate this system don't give a

damn if bread is on the reservation or not! What is

ironic when we try

to get off the reservation, they

think they are justified

in killing us.

"If Black people or a handful in essence--one

in avery ten thousand should be given franchises to

set up a monstrous machine in the Black colony it

would

be a counterpart to the tyrannical white Anglo

Saxon's. Who would they exploit!

It is understandable

while the pig (sic) NIXON

so readily endorsed Black

Capitalism.

Are we so blind until we cannot see that

• this is just another smoke screen to deny us of

total equality?

"We believe and understand that the term Capitalism.

as well as so-called Black Capitalism is irrelevant

For the simple reason

there will only be a few

more material goods, a few more advantages, a few more

privileges; so those who run the show are going to do

a little bit better!. What will happen to the Black

have-nots in this country? We must tune our minds in

on promoting the interest of the Black have-nots who

are the majority in this

country. The people must con-

trol the material goods, the means of production if

they are ever to abolish exploitation of money hungry

pirates.

"We know, slick NIXON knows, and we Black Panthers

must inform and educate the people through activity.

Activity through

any means possible to bring about

radical reforms if we are to survive as a people!!"

"BLACK MAN,. LISTEN!

"I think there are many profound, incisive, and

elusive things that Black men find hard to say to other

Black men; but I'm inclined to believe it's the small

things of life we find bard

to say to. each other--small

but important things that will mode our destiny. I'm

going to say some of the small things that are very

important dealing with our future. Brace yourself

brothers, I'm going to give you the lay of the land!

"Here-we-are trapped in a monstrous unprecedented

dilemma that's crushing the life out of us!

Stripped

of all manhood, no authority to make any laws concerning

our lives nor authority to say when our children are to

go to school or what kind of education they are to

receive. Horrifying! Yet I hear and read so much

negative lip protest and so much negative literary pro-

Begging for political justice from the enemy,

I say it's futile to ask the oppressor for freedom

because he can't free us even if he wanted to in a

Capitalistic system.

As long as we continue to beg and

rage, they will only give us arguments and continue

to say we're uncool and not ready. This really hurts

when they say we are not ready because it's the--

notorious truth--Black men don't beg, they demand!

"We must redefine the term Black Man just as

MALCOLM X and HUEY P. NEWTON did and stand firm on

our beliefs and if necessary let there be rivers of

blood in maintaining our beliefs. As a Black Man or "

those whom are conscious of self

and environment, it

is our responsible to re-educate the people in which

they will know what avenues to approach toward alter-

nating the Black Colony in which the masses will

benefit.

"First, we must heighten the contradictions around

the so-called law and that jive constitution. He

- 8

NW 65360 Docld:32989647 Page 54

## Page 55

must politically stimulate the minds of our people

where as they will understand that what is really

happening to them and why? Our teachings must focus

on national as well as international issues so we

can equate and analyze our situation with other

oppressed nations in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

He must heighten the contradictions around the history

in which we were white washed by the pover structure's

monstrous--misleading communication system--dogmatic

papers and books, irrelevant television series, and

naive radio programs.

"Second, we must emphasize and highly stress

that all Black Teachers, Artists and Clergymen praise

and glorily Black Freedom fighters who have been

murdered or incarcerated by hands of the enemy.

FrOm

HARRIET TUBMAN--MARCUS GARVEY--MALCOLM X--DR.

KING to

HUEYS. NEWTON; this must be done for pride and dignity.

These methods of teaching must be profound and incisive

in order to bear ripe fruit.

This is needed to stimulate

the mind.

Hence, the mind

will be transformed toward

self-emancipation.

"This package carries

the seeds for transplanting

a new nation of Black People. • A package that will

fuse Black Solidarity, a package that will produce

undying love and courage where as it's people will not

compromise, nor give one iota to the enemy.. They will

understand and know what they will be giving--their

freedom!

"Look!

Black Man, this is the only way to lift

the yoke of bondage that is oppressing as in this

decadent oligarchy

society:

I see and understand

we're dealing with inhuman

elements (pigs) who have long

dehumanized each other by their racist beaucratic

distributed on Crane Junior College campus on

April 1 and 2, 1969:

"PIG POLICE IN BLACK COMMUNITY

"We are living in a police state (Fascism); not

only do pigs forcibly subdue all Black Orientated

organizations, but they are allowed to freely walk

the streets of our black communities and use any means

at their disposal (clubs, mace, 357 Magnums, etc.) in

order to contain and brutalize Black people.

"We must take a stand! We must be prepared for

the consequences.

We must face these pigs just as

HUEY P. NEWTON • did in this present state of police

oppression.

(Pig Barbarianism) Why are so many police

in the Black Community?

Why is the stop and frisk law

only applicable to Black People? Why are our Federal,

state, county and ci"y jails only filled and splattered

with the blood of Black People?

Why must our. Black

People unnecessarily face constant police harassment

and

agitation? Why are missiles bordering every Black

Community in the country?

"Why are so many so-called riot control weapons

being stockpiled? We must understand and deal with

the fact that our community is now facing the unmerciful

gestapo--the occupational

army--namely the Pig Police.

In order to deal with the tail--we must first deal with

the head boar--Tricky Dick Daily whose only claim to fame is

the exploitation of Black People! He must

unite and call upon all people to destroy these pigs

swiftly and in whole without mercy.

On February 14, 1969, FRED HAMPTON, Deputy

Chairman, BPP, Chicago Chapter, spoke at Old Town's

Boy's Club, 1207 Hest Madison Street, Chicago, Illinois.

HAMPTON explained the BPP ten points and

described the BPP

as a military group.

He stated the

purpose of BPP is to correct the abuses in this society:

visited upon the Blacks and to build a powerful Black

society, which can deal effectively with the white beast.

All Blacks should have guns so that when the

man comes to your door you could blow him away. Whites

have been committing genocide for 400 years and now

the Blackman is beginning to fight back.

White education

is meant only to use, control and corrupt Black youth

and foil their minds.

After Black youths are under

control, then the whiteman will move on Black adults.

HAMPTON, noting several white adults in the

audience, asked them, in obscene terms, what they were

doing at

a Black meeting. An elderly white wonan, in

tears, stated

she and her friends meant no harm and were

just trying to

be helpful. The crowd, practicaly all

of Negro race,

appeared stunned by HAMPTON's statement

to the whites.

YOUNG SOCIALIST ALLIANCE-CHICAGO

A source advised in late November, 1959, that the

Young socialist Alliance-Chicago (YSA-C), formerly known as

Young Socialist Supporters, had its origin in a series of

informal discussions held in Chicago prior to June, 1959,

among individuals who

were close to the socialist workers

Party (SWP) .

The YSA-C as of November, 1959, proclaimed itself

to be a city-wide revolutionary youth organization designed

to build socialism in America and aimed toward youth on

college campuses in the Chicago area and as being independent

of all adult groupings.

According to a second source in April, 1968, the

YSA-C was considered the youth group of the Chicago Branch

SWP and affiliated with the national organization of the YSA

in New York. The YSA-C officers as of April, 1968, were

current

members of

the Chicago SWP.

The SWP has been designated pursuant to Executive

On October 16, 1969, the current issue of "The

, a weekly newspaper, distributed in the

Maywood, Illinois area, carried an article entitled,

"Hampton Graham, blast Poverty Bias", which reads as follows:

"Thirty-nine years ago, the Melrose Park village

board denied the request of

a group of black residents

to build a church within the village, claiming it would

attract " the colored element from Maywood and Chicago.*

Last Tuesday, Proviso area blacks met in the First

Bapstist church of Melrose Park, a Negro church, to

discuss other "problems of black

people in the suburbs.'

The small croud (about 35 or 40) ranged from in-

tense Black Panthers with high and wide Afro haircuts

to middle aged suburban couples.

Fred Hampton, chairman of the Illinois Black

Panthers, was scheduled to appear along with the

Rev. George Clements; Dr. Charles Hurst, dean of

Malcolm & college; and Bill Graham of Maywood's

Human Relations commission.

Hurst and Clements didn't show, so Graham led

off with a multi-pronged attack on what the federal

and local government is and is not doing.

Be blasted the proposed family planning pro-

gram, saying that the bill, 'which is not yet safe,

is going

to be shoved down

our throats.'

"When genocide can be forced upon us, there

is some question as to the sanity of a system that

would allow this,' he said.

Graham,

calmly but angrily, called the elementary

schools in dist. 89 'a network

of failure factories,'

and high school dist. 209 'racist oriented.'

He also cited poor housing for low and low middle

income

families where 'rats play hopscotch with a dead

roach,

' and'a welfare system where recipients have to

storm

the welfare office to get what they're entitled

to on paper.'

Ron Satchel, health minister of the Illinois

Black Panthers,

gave a brief talk on the organiza-

tion's free breakfast program

and free health care

center.

He also scored family planning, saying that

'increasing population isn't the problem, but the

maldistribution of food.'

But it was Fred Hampston who dominated the

meating.

with the skill of a practiced surgeon,

he dissected mid-twentieth century American society.

"Facism is what we have in this country today,!

he heatedly began,

'and there are three integral

parts; the avaricious businessman, the demagogic

politician, and the racist pig dog

policeman.

Hampston, embattled in the courts

on assault

charges, said

one of the worst dangers for blacks

is their belief in the white power structure's

'false values.'

'Athletics and entertainment are the biggest

as belping to perpetuate a dangerous myth.

'Hell, with all this work to be done, we got

no time for playing.'

The Panther chairman said that everyone has

the right to defend himself, so if people don't

want the Panthers to have guns, all guns should

be thrown in the ocean and not

When you

them

in a keg,' he continued, 'you can march

it's still explosive. You have to get inside at

'But 100k, I'm 21,

The program of SDS has moved from involvement in clvil rihts

struggles to an anti-Vietnum war position ind finally to ta

present advocacy of an anti-imperialist line, linking up the

oppressed peoples of Asia, Mirica and Latin America with ihe

black liberation movement

in the United States.

China,

Vietnam and Cuba are regarded as countries which are leading

the world-wide struggles against United States imperialis..

On the other hand, SDs regards the Soviet Union as an

imperialist power and does not support the policies of that

country.

SDS maintains a National Office in Room 206, 1608

Its official

MILITARY TRAINING SCHEDULE

A

four week mandatory class for all members (luesday,

Thursday and Sunday) with the exclusion of all non-members. Two

classes should be conducted by a small military staff, classes

conducted expressing party ideology, and stressing military

discipline at all tings!

Upon the entering of the classroom of

the military instructor

all talking should cease and all trainers

should take a firm attentative standing position and remain in

this mannar until given the order to be seated. All classes

or class activities should begin with: All Power the People

and victory to the People's Revolution. The main purpose of the

class is to give every party member a basic practical knowledge

of the military phase of the peoples' struggle.

There should ba

no absenteeism from the Political 'Education Classes (no excuses),

reason being a military mind without a people's ideology is a

hired killer and the people don't need no more pigs. Classes

should be conducted in an orderly manner at all times.

STRUCTURE OF THE CLASSES

1. Discipline

A. Discipline is the esact execution of orders resulting

frOm

an intelligent, willing obedience rather than one

based solely upon habit or fear.

Discipline is necessary

to secure orderly action which alone can triumph over

the seemingly impossible conditions of battle.

The party

members mu' t be able to recognize and

face fear because

Pear is the enemy of discipline.

Fear unchecked will

lead to panic and a unit that panics is no longer a

discipline unit but a nob. There is no sane person who

15 without foar,, but with

good discipline and

high morale

all can face danger.

Punishment of individual members for

breacher of discipline is sometimes necessary, but only

to reform or eliminate those who are unfit to

serve the

people's Revolution.

The "New York Times" city edition Tuesday, April 20, 1965,

page 27, reported that a new party of "revolutionary socialism"

vas

formally founded on April 18, 1965, under the name of the PLy, which

had been known as the Progressive Labor Movement.

According to the article, "The Progressive Labor Morement

was founded in 1962, by Milton Rosen and Mortimer Scheer alter they

were expelled from the Communist Party ‹ ihe United Statre for assertedly

following the Chinese Communist line."

A source advised on June 3, 1968, that the PLP held its Second

National Convention in New York City May 31 to June 2. 1968, at which

time the PLP reasserted its objective of the establishment of a militant

working class movement based on Marxism-Leninism. This is io be

accomplished through the Party's overall revolutionry stratesy of

raising the consciousness of the people and helping to provide identogical

leadership in the working class struggle for state power.

The source also advised that at the Second National Convention

Milton Rosen was unanimously re-elected National Chairman of the PLP

and Levi Laub, Fred Jerome, Jared Israel, William Epton, Jacoh Rosen,

STUDENTS FOR A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETE

A source has advised that the Students for a Democratic

Society (BDS), as it is known today, came into being at a foundings

convention held at Port furon, Michigan, in June, 1962, From an

initial ideological posture of "participatory democracy," the current

line of the national leadership reveals an adherence to Marxism-Leninism.

Michael Klonsky, National Secretary, in March, 1965, called for the

building of a revolutionary Marist-Leninist movement.

The program

of SDS has moved from involvement in civil rights struggles to &1 anti-

Vietnam war position and finally to its present advocacy of an ini

imperialist line, linking up the oppressed peoples of Asia, Afric, and

Latin America with the black liberation movement in the United rates.

China,

Vietnam and Cuba are regarded as countries which are landing

the world-wide struggles against United States imperialism. On the

other hand, SDS regards the Soviet Union as an imperialist yowe • and

does not support the policies of that country.

SDS maintains a National Office in Room 206, 1608 West

Madison Street, Chicago, Illinois. Its ofticial paper "New Left: Notes"

reflects the line of the national leadership and program adopted at

meetings of the National Council and National Interim Committee

(NIC). Three national officers and a NIC of eleven memotes are

elected each year during a June National Convention.

SDS Regional Offices and university and college chapters

elect delegates to National Council meetings wherein program and

ideology are debated, but each Region and chapter is autoromous ir:

nature and is free to carry out independent policy and progruns

reflective of local conditions.

1, CLASS

We see that the hey to truly understanding and improving our situation

is to truly understand the nature of class society. He see that in

America and in the world that those wno have money control those wio

do not, WEALTH-LUMER! We feed that the wealth of the world should

-....... ..

be shared equally among ell people. The workers or the masses of

the people produce the wealth and they should control it. We see

that our allies are those who have nothing and our enemies are those

who have too much.

2. WELFARE OF THE PEOPLE

We believe that all people are entitled to adequate food, clothings

shelter and medical care. We believe that businessmen should not make

a profit on the things that we need to survive. We demand decent and

30

•adequate housing at a low cost for poor people. We demand safe,

clean day care centers for mothers who work, We demand that mothers

who want to raise their children in their own home be paid for this

vital. work.

PIGS & PIG PONER STRUCTURE

He demand the end to the pigs murdering and brutalizing our people.

The pigs are the tool of the rich man. The pigs are in our community

to protect the property of robber-baron landlords and avaricious

businessmen and not the lives or the interests of the people who

live in the community. We call the police pigs because they oppress

the people. The world belong's to the people not the pigs.

SCHOOLS - EDUCATION

We understand that the main purpose of the educational system as it

DoN Stands 18 to make people fit smoothly Into the capitalistic class

Boclety, We understand that the children of poor people are trained

so be poor people: the children of lactory workers are trained to

voris in factories--che children of rich people are trained to take

their parents places, The present educational system 13 Irrelevant

to the ¿rue needs and desires of the people. The schools are run

like prisons because this society is a prison. We demand that all

people know their true history. We demand that all people have the

opportunity to develop cheir abilities.

DRAPI

We oppose the draft because it means poor and working class men fighting

rich aens wars. We oppose imperialistic wars of agression such as the one.

in Viet Nam, We belleve that all patriotic men and women should serve only

In the army of liberation. Rich people can buy their way out of the draît,

but pooï and working class people have no choice. •We demand that the old

rich men tno create the wars should fight them and that the young men should

stay home and construct a new society.

6. UNION

Zabor unions are a good thing.

But we still know that the majority of

Americans work long hours under bad conditions for poor wages and never

have nothing to show for it. We demand an end to discrimination on the

job and in the union. Men and women of all races should get equal wages and

better working conditions.

EXFLOITATION OF THE COMMUNITY

We understand that the businessmen in the community make their living off

of us. We understand that we make the products that they sell back to us.

We demand that if businessmen intend to stay in the community they treat us

as brothers and do not cheat us by charging prices we can't afforà. We

demand that if businessmen make profits in the community, these profits be

invested in the community in the form of goods and services.

B. RACISM

Racism is a tool of capitalism to make people fight among themselves,

instead of fighting together for their freedom. Divisions of race and sex

serve the Interests of the rich, ruling class and not of the people.

9. RELEASE ALL POLITICAL PRISONERS

He demand the release of all political prisoners. We understand that the

majority of so-called "criminals" in our concentration-camp prisons are

victims of our class society. Justice is a luxury that only. rich men can

afford.. These people should be released to build a new society rather

Baan hidden away for society's mistakes.

20. CULTURAL NATIONALISM

. We belleve that to fight only for the Interests of your close cultural

prothers and sisters is not in the interest of all the people, and in fact

perpetuates racism. All power to the poor and working people! Cultural

nationalism does not solve the political problems of the oppressed people,

but only perpetuates exploitations - capitalism makes millions on love beads,

afro-shirts, and cowboy hats. Cultural nationalism is a tool of capitalist

exploitation.

example of

1965,

what happened to your tax money:

Four American students visited Guatemala. They made a point

of interviewing an official of the U.S. ugency for International

Development (AlD)

which handles

most U.S. foreign aid. The AID

Songes $ 2,300,000,000 from U.S. taxpayers each year.

The students

were interested in what we get in return.

One of the students asked the MID man what sort of things were being

done to help the Guatemalan prople.

The official replied, "Well,

actually that's not our direct responsibility. You see,

the real

purpose of aID is to open up this country to american business in-

vestment. "

The students were shocked, but the AlD man went on to

tell them why he thought this was a good thing. tointing to a con-

struction site, he said,

"See that housing projet?

We got a U.i.

construction company to come down here and build low cost housing

units for local workers and their familias."

One of the students asked the man, "How much do you charge for one?"

AID man:

"$2,500 altogether, but

that's in small monthly payments."

Student:

"How much does it cost to build one?"

All man:

"Well, the companies have to make a profit..."

Student:

"Come

on, how much?"

AID man: "about $800 a piece."

Waat has happened here?

A U.S.

Taxpayer is milked of $800. The government gives the noney

to AID, which turns it over to an

american construction company.

Now the stuffed-shirt businessman who gets this money goes down

to

Guatemala, hires workers there for 30x an hour to build a house,

and then charges

these workers $2,500 to live in it.".

Inis has happened: I The american working man is conned out of money

2 a Guatemalan worker is forced to work for

starvation wages, mortgages nis lile away for

a nome,

and begins to hate the u.w. for screwIl

him and his country

3 a rich businessman who owns an international

construction company makes

$1,700 clear, tax

free profit while undertaking no risk and

investing almost no money.

Why does this happen?

U.S. Governmait dominates small

foreign countries to serve the

mord of the very rich, the small class of hogs that actually runs

this country.

The

workire, poople of the entire world are bled by

this ruling class:

"ABOUT FRED"

As a fesult of an det of repression by America"s "Pig Power Structure;"

there now exists cnother "Political Prisoner.."

As of, May 26, 19.89, America once again has kidnapped from the oppressed

masses,

a man concerned solely with our liberation and freedom. Chairman of

the Illinois Chapter of the Black Panther Party, Chairman Fred Hampton is tem-

pororily (jailed) in a 'wéll known' illinois Concentration Camp. Wa say, "tem-

porarily jailed" because we know and fully understand that once you, the masses,

realize just what fred Hampton stands for, fights, for, and what U.S, capitalism

ond U.S. imperalism stands for, you too will sirive to FREE CHAIRMAN FRED;

AND ALL OTHER POLITICAL PRISONERS.

In regards to accomplishing 'our' mission, we ask for your support in attending

the planned rally in Honor of Chairman Fred Hampton. As well as a day of en-

joyment, this will also be a day of education for all. And it may even be a day

..of bringing about more unity to oppressed people of America. a

On June 4, 1969 SA RAMON W. STRATTON was present at

2350 West Madison, Chicago, Illinois, when arrests were made

for: harboring a fugitive from justice,

in building occunied by

an organization calling themselves the Black Panthers.

Special

Agent in Charge MArLIN " Jounson of the Chicago Federal Bureau

of Investigation office instructed sA STRATON to conduct

a lawful

search of the building in which the arrests were made,

with assistance of other Special Agents, of the FBI.

Posters, pamphlets, printed material and machines

were observed on the walls, floors, desks and chairs and it

appeared to SA STRATTON that these

items would be subject

to seizure under a search warrant issued im conformance with

Rule 41 (b) of the Federal Kules of Crininal Procedure in

conjunction with violations of Title 19, US. Code, Sections

2383, 2384 and 2385.

Section 2383 relates to rebellion or insurrection

against the authority of the United States or the laws thereof

or in giving aid and comfort thereto..

sentin 2394 mólatos to consniram to overtlun,

Section 2385 relates to willfufly advocating, etc.

the overthrow of the Government of the United States and

the printing, etc. of material, and the orgmizing, etc. of

persons for such purposes.

SA STRATION therefore directed that certain

materials be seized and preserved as evidence of violations of

laws of the United States,

possibly being comitted in presence

of Agents, both as mere evidence and as material designed

or intended for use or wilich is or has been used as means of

n conducting this search, the following matters

were considered:

The arrests were completed between approximately

5:30 a.mo and 6:00 a,m. and it would not be possible-to

prepare detailed affidavits for search warrant and appear

before the U.S. Comnissioner or a District lourt judge

for several hours.

The building had been prepared with electrical

devices and with solid steel doors and iron doors and bars

placed over entrances, exits and windows, thusly preventing

any entrance without breaking and entering and with

use of firearms. Several weapons were present and seized

and it 18 known to Agents that this organization calling

thenselves the Black Panthers has consistently stated that

attempts to search or to effect arrests would be violently

resisted, even with firearms.

That attempts to enter the builaing naú met'

in the same way, necessstating an armed force sufficient

to effect the execution offa search warrant, thus making

it impractical, to obtain and effect a search by warrant

on the same day.

Lilelihood of destruction of evidence and removal

of evidence while the paperwork necessary for a search

by search warrant was being accomplished and filed.

Tenseness of the general neighborhood due to

prior racial disorders.

guaranteed income.

We believe that if the white

Of its people and give a high standard of living.

WE WANT AN END TO THE ROBBERY BY THE WHITE MAN OF OUR

We believe that this racist government has robbed us

and now we are demanding the overdue debt of forty

icres and two mules. Furty acres and two mules was

promised 100 years-ago as restitution for slave labor

and mass murder of black poople.

"We will accept the

many communities. The Germans murdered six million Jews.

over fifty million black people; therefore, we feel that

this is a modest demand that we nake.

4.. WE WANT DECENT HOUSING, FIT. FOR SHELTER OF IUMAN BEINGS.

We believe that if the white landlords will not give

decent housing to our black community, then the

This same pig creates disorder in our schools, and vamps on us when

we stand up for what is ours, as Manuel did. We make demands for belter conditions

in our schools. Maruel made a demand for the people. He said, "Mon, I believe all

people should have power whether they're Black, Brown, or White." And for that he

was assassinated.

Manuel's murder is no exception. Everyday our brothers and sisters are murdered and

vamped on by the pigs.

--Ron Nelson, whose pig murderer Nuccio was convicted by the people, but

--And thousands of other brothers and sisters whose murderers remain armed and

loose and dangerous on the streets.

The people are now demanding some of the "low, and order and justice" that the pig power

structure talks about so much.

We have organized a march on the 18th district pigsty, where the hoad hog, State Attorney

Hanrahan will be and demand action against assassin Pig Lamb Now. . .

--We demand the indictment and conviction of Pig Lamb for murder

--We, demand the release of our brothers arrested to cover up murderer Lamb

The people have lot the pigs rule and terrorize us for too long. They have kept up divided

and confused thru racism. We must stop fighting each other and take on our real enemy --

the racist power structure and their army of pigs. We must act together and demand that

their jive laws work for us -- the People.

We know that the courts have never worked for us. That they are controlled

by the some pig power structure that sends its army of pigs to murder and

horass us. We will demand that they give us justice... but when they do not

"COLLABORATING WITH THE ENEMY

"The Government of the U.S. Is trying desparately

to maintain her domination over oppressed peoples in

this pig society.

One of her first tactics is to basc

herself an official collaborators and reactionary

elements. These traitors-sons are singled out, given

concessions, and placed on the national news modia

to denounce

the revolutionary movement and the peoples.

aspirations for freedom.

The govermnent has made a

concensus of its loyal and faithful traitors-sons,

mobilized them to make declarations and condemnations

on radio, TV, and in the papers to the effeet of

denouncing the peoples' rights

to seli-defense in the

*fare of brutal nir attacks.

The Black Panthey Party

has uncovered this schene to keep the people at the mercy

of this vicious pig powei structure. We see this

stepped-up campaign against the revolutionary peoples

party as an attempt to cut off the sound" population

from the revolutionary body. The pir power structure

knows that if the people follow the Black panther Party,

they will be unable to exploit, oppress, and murder

us at will. These same traitors who denounced the

people's legal right to be free, endorse the cynical,

inhuman, deviate methods used to suppress the people.

"The traitors-sons are helping the enemy pigs in

their national propaganda scheme to promote black

capitalisin, knowing from the start, that the resulting

black capitalism is

neo-colonialisn.

These collaborators,

these black pigs,

these white traitors are to be found

l on national, state, and local levels.

They can be found

in Congress, in pig Nixon's cabinet, in the supreme

court, in state legislative bodies, and in local arms of

national civil rights

organizations They will tell

you that the pooblem is economic and social; that they

will vigorously try to solve the housing question and end

the demand for

national liberation as

if it is a

manifestation of social discontent. They move with

the Illusions that their promises to improve living

conditions will be sufficient to bring back order and

peace.

They misinterpret the peoples national con-

to receive their..

As long as

these rem bees exist, elon the

their running dogs will use them

to point the masses in the wrong direction.

"The Black Panther Party will forever educate the

masses to their deviate tricks and they, too, will have

to face the wrath of the armed people.

The Black

the people how to resist the efforts of these collaborators,

has been transmitled to all the getros of the black nation

across the country. The first man wio threw a nolotor cocktail

The Vangard Party must provide leadership for the people.

It is not necessary to organize

butfit is imporant for the party to show the people how to so

about revolution. During slavery, in which no vanguard party

existed and frons of communication were severly restricted and

insufficient, many slave revolts occurred.

There are basically thre ways one can learn; Through studys

through observation, and through actual esperience. The black

community is basically composed of activists.

Without this knowlige of the black comunity,

one could not gain the fundinenta). knovodage of the black revolution in racist

• Americas

The main fuction of the party is to awaken the people and to loach them the

strategic nethod of rosisting the pover stricture, which is prepared not only to

combat the resistance of the people with massive brutality, but to tobilly ani~

hilate the black commugitas the black populatione

Il it is learned by the power structure that black people have"y" anount of

guis in their possession, this will not stinulate the poucr structure to pregarc

itself vith guis, because it is alrcady more than propared.

The end result of this education vill be positive. for Black people in their

reisitance and negative for the pover structure in its oppression, because the

party alvays exemplifies revolutionary defiance. If the party is not going to

make the people aware of the tools of libcratin and the strategic.method that is

to be used, there will be no means by which the pooph will be nobilised properly.

The pelationship between the vanguard party and the masses is a secondary

relationship.

The relationship between the nonburs of he venguard party is a

primary relationship.

It is important that the members of the vanguard group

maintain a face-toface- rclationship with each other. This is important if th

party müchinory is to so effective.

It is impossible to put together functional

party machinery or programs without this direct relationshio. The menbers of the

vanguaid group should be tesded revolutionaries. This will minimize the danger

of. Uncle Ton infornei's and opportunists.

The main purpose of vanguard group shoulc be to raise the consciousness of

the masses through caucational progrars and certain physical activitics the party

will participate in. The slecping masses must be bombarded with the correct

approach to strusgle though the activities of the vanguard party.

Therefore,

the masses must know that the party exists. The party misi use all means

availaule to get this information across to the masses. If the masses do not

have knowledge of the party, it will be impossible for the masses to follow

the program of the party.

The vanguard party is never underground in the beginning of its existence,

because this would limit its effectiveness and educational processes. How can you

teach people il une people do not know bus and respect you: The party must exisi

above ground as long as thodos power suructure will allow, all honefully wien thi

party is forced to so underground the masage of be party with already have been

put across lo the people.

The vanguard parly's activities on lit surface will

nocessarily be shortlivid.

This is why it is so importunt that the party make a treendous impact

upon the people before it is divin into secrecy.

At this tino, the people know the party exists, and they wil: scek. out

The so-called revolutiontrics are in

fact afraid of the vory danger that they are advocating for the people.

These

so-called revolutionaries want the people to say what they thunsclves are

afraid to do.

This makes. the so-called revolutionary a covaid and a hypocrite.

If these imposters nould investluate the history of revolution, they

would see that the vanguard group always starts out above ground and is later

driven underground by the aggressor.

The Cuban Fcivolution cxerplifies this fact;

when Fidel Castro started to resist

the butchen Batista and the Anerican running

dogs, he staried by preaking on the camus of the University of Havana in

public. He was later driven to the hills. His impact upon the dispossessed

people of Cuba was very treat and received with nuch respect. When he went

into secrecys Cuban people searched him out. People went ot the hills to find

him and his band of twelve. Castro handled the revolutionary struggle correctly.

Is the Chinese Revolution is investigated, it will be seen that the cormisu

Party vas quite on the surface so that they would be able to muster support

from the masses. Thore are many arcas one can road about to Icarn the correct

approach, such as the revolution in Kenya, the Algerian Revolution, Fanon's

THE WRETCHED OF THE FARTH, the Hussian Revolution, the works of Chairhan Fao

Ise-tungs and a host of others.

A revolutionary must realize that if he is sincere, death is inninent dup

to the fact th at the things he

is saying and doing arcextronely dangerous.

Vitivut nis realization, it is impossile to proced as a revolutionary.

The

masses are constantly looking for a guide, a Messiah, to liberate them fron

the hands of the oppressor. "The vanguard party must

exemplify the characteristies

of worthy leadership. Millionstand millions of oppressed people might not imow:

members of the varguard party, personilly or dircetly, but they will gain througa

an indirect acquaintance the proper stratcay for liberation via the mass media

and

the physical activities of the party. It is of prime importance that the

vanguard party develop a political organ, such as a neuspaper produced by the

party, as well as cmploy strategically revolutionary art

and astrucizon of the oppressor's machinery. for example, watts.

The econony

and proporty of the oppressor was destroyed to such an extent that no matter how

the oppressor tried to whitewash the activitics of the black brothers, the real

nature and the real cause of the activity was commmicated to every black commitz

For further example, no matter how the oppressor tries to distort and confuse

the message of Brother Stokely Carmichacl, Black people all over the country

understand it perfectly and velcome it.

The Black Panther Padty for Self Defense teaches that in thefinal analysis,

the anount of guns and defense venpons, such as hand gronides, bacockang and

otter

accessary equipment, will be supplind by baling these weapons from the pover

structure, as excualifid by the Viro Condo

These Sore, the greater the military

preparation on the part of the oppressork the cocater is the availability or

weapons for the black community. It is believed by some hyyocrites that when

the prople are taught by the vanguard group to mopare for resistance, this

only brings the man down on them with increasing violence and brutality; but the

fact of the matter is that when the man becores more oppressive, this only

heightens the revolutionary fervor.

The people nover make revolution. The

oppressors by their brutal actions

We believe that the federal government is responsible and obligated to

give every man employment or a guaranteed income. We believe that if

the white American businessmen will not give full employment, then the

and two mules was promised 100 vcars ago as restitution for slave labor

and mass murder of black people. We will accept the payment in currency

which will be distributed to our many communities. The Germans are now

taly service to detend a racist government that does not protect us. Ne

will not light and kill other people of color in the work who. like black

people, are being victimized by the white racist government of America.

• We will protect ourselves from the force and violence of the racist police

and the racist military, by whatever means necessary.

7. We want an immediate end to POLICE BRUTALITS and MURDER

or blach people.

We believe we can end police brutality in our black community by or-

ganizing blach self-defense groups that are dedicated to defending our

black communily from racist police oppression and brutality. The Second

Amendment to the Constitution of the United Stales gives a right to bear

arms: We therefore beliere that all black peogle should arm themselves

for self-defense.

8. We want freedom for all black men heil in federal, state, county

and city prisons and jails.

We believe

that all black people should ke released from the many

jails and prisons because they have not receivel a fair and impartial trial:

9. We want all black people when hrought latrial to be tried in court by

a jury of their peer group or people from sheir black communities, as

defined by the Constitution of the Linited Stales.

We believe that the courts should follow the U'nited States Constitution

so that black people will receive fair trials. She 14th Amendment of the

U.S. Constitution gives a man a right to be tried by his peer group. A peci

is a person from a similar cconomic, social, religious, geographical, en-

vironmental, historical and racial background. To do this the court will he

forced to seleul a jury from the black community from which the black

defendant came. We have been, and are beng tried by all-white juries

that have no understanding of the "average reasoning man" of the black

community.

10. We want land, bread, housing, education clothing, justice and peace.

And as ou major political objective, a United Nations-supervised plebis-

citro be hele touch the back one wiet only blash cole tial

will of black people as to their national destry.

When, in the course of muman events. in bucomes necessary for one

people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with

another, and to assume, among the powers oftile earth. the separate and

equal station to which the lass of nature andmuture's God entitle them, a

decent respect to the opiions of mankind regenes that they should declare

the causes which impel them to the separation

We hold these truths to be self-evident, tut all men are created equal;

that they are endowed by their Creator wath certam unalienable rights:

that anong these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That, to

sceure these righis, governments are institutalamong men, deriving their

Just powers from the concent of the gorernet; that, shoneser any form of

government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people

to alter or to abolish it, and to institute a nos government, laying ils

foundation on such principles, and organizingits posers in such form, as

1o them shall seem most liliely to effect their safely and happiness. Pru-

dence, indeed, will dictate that governmentslong established should not

be changed for light and transieut causes; and accordingly. all experience

hath shosn, that mankind are more disposal. to suffer, while evils are

sufferable, than to right themselves by abohsling the forms to which they

are accustomed. But, wien a long train of alus's and unsurpations, pur-

suing invariably the same object, evinces a degn to reduce them under :b.

solute despotisfi, it is their right, it is their daty, to thros off such govern-

anchl, and lo provide new guards for their fetire security.

STUDENTS FOR A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY

A source has advised that the Students for a Democratic

Society (SDS), as it is known today, came into being al a founding

participatory democracy,". the current

line of the national leadership reveals an adherence to Marxism-Leninism.

Michael Klonsky, National Secretary, in March, 1969, called for the

building of a revolutionary Marxist-lennist movement.

The program

of SDS has moved from involvement in civil richts strumrles to an anti-

Vietnam war position and finally to its present advocacy of an anti-

imperialist que, linking up the oppressed peoples of Asia, Africa and

Latin America with the black liberation movement in the United States.

China,. Vietnam and Cuba are regarded as countries which are leading

the world-wide struggles against United States imperialism. On the

other hand, SDS regards the Soviet Union as an imperialist power and

does not support the policies of that country.

SDS maintains a National Office in Room 206, I608 West

Madison Street, Chicago, Mlinois. Its official paper "New Left Notes"

reflects the line of the national leadership and program adopted at

meetings uf the National Council and National Interim Committee

(NIC). Three national officers and a NIC of eleven members are

elected each year during a June National Convention.

SDS Regional Offices and university and college chapters

elect delegates to National Council meetings wherein program and

ideology are debated, but each Region and chapter is autonomous in

nature and is free to carry out independent policy and programs

reflective of local conditions.

nonnonbership organization, which yas born out of

the

sit-in movement that erupted across the south beginning

in 1960.

Today SNCC identifies itself as an organization in

the revolutionary verguard.

It advocates that to be successiul

it is necessary to develop

a revolutionary ideodogy and

According to SNCC the year 1987 marked a historic

milestone in the struggle for the liberation of black people

the United states and the your that revolutionaries

throughout the worls baran to understand more tualu the innaci

of the black movement.

SNCC declared that "liberation vill

come only when there is final destruction of this mad octopus--

the capitalistic systen of the United States with all 1tg

111e-sucking tentacles of exploitation and racian that choke

the people of Africa, Asia, and Latta America. The realities

of black life,

together with the recogrition instilled in SNCC

workers forced its members to lurther popularize the legitinacy

of self-dolense and rebellions when oppression became too great."

From Hay, 1966, until May, 1967, Stokely Carmichael

was Nationel Chairman of

SNCC. As of July, 1968, Carmichael

resided in Washington, D. C., here he was affiliated with

SNCC and active as temporary chairusa of

In June, 1968, at the Stali and Central Committee

meeting of SNCC held in

restructure the organization by equalization of responsibility

by creating ten deputy or vice chairmanshipe.

The primary.

purpose for this change is to tase law entorcement pressure off

of the dass is to give every party member abbasic pragtical

knowledge of the military phase of the peoples" struggle.

hired killer and the people don't need no more pigs.

Classes should be conducted in an orderly manner at all times.

Structure of the Classes

A. Discipline is the exact execution of orders resulting from an

intelligent, willing obedience, rather than one, based solely

upon habit or fear. Discipline is necessary to secure orderly

action which alone can triumph over the seemingly impossible

condition of battle.

The party members must be able to recognize

and face fear because fear is the enemy ot discipline. Fear

will lead to panic and a unit that panics is no longer

There is no saneperson who is

without fear, but with good discipline and high mosale all can

The Guerrilla

MOVEMENT: You mentioned at another

seeins

to fit in directly with the guerrilla as

a political man. Would you like to cominent

on this?

HUEY: Yes. The guerrilla

is a very

unique man. This is in contrast to Marxist-

Leninist orthodox theories where the party

controls the military. The guerrilla is not

uniy ine warrior,

tne millary igmer;

military commander as

well as the politleal theoretician. Debraj

says "poor the pen without the guns,

poor the gun without the pen"

tool to write down concepts, ldeas. The

gun is only an extension

of the body,

the extension df our fanged teeth that we

lost through evolution.

It's the weapon,

it's the claws that we lost, it's the body.

The guerrilla is the military cominander

and the political theoretician all in one.

In Bolivia Che said that he got very

little help from the Communist Party

there. The Communist Party wanted to

be the mind, the Communist Party wanted

to have full control

of the guerrilla

activity. But yet weren't taking part in

the practical work of the guerrillas. The

guerrilla on the other hand is nor only

united within himself, but he also attempts

to spread this to the people by educating

giving them political per-

out things, educating

them politically, and arming the people.

"Essays From the Minister of Defense" is a collection

of truths, principles and beliefs practiced by the Black

& DEFENSE OF SELF DEFENSE

By Muey P. Newton

Introduction:

Huey P. Newton's column in THE BLACK PANTHER

newspaper was entitled "In Defense of Self Defense." The

following articles by the Minister of Defense were taken

from those columns.

"In Defense of Self Defense."

June 20, 1967.

Laws and rules have always been made to serve peo-

ple. Rules of society are set up by people so that they will

be able to function in a harmonious way. In other words,

P- in order to promote the general welfare of society, rules

and laws are established by men. Rules should serve men,

and not men serve rules. Murh of the time: the laure tend s

rules which officials attempt to inflict upon poor people are

non-functional in relatioi iu ine status, of the poór in socie-

ty.

These officials are blind to the fact that people should

not respect rules that are not serving them.

It is the duty

of the poor to write and construct rules and laws that are

in their better interests. This is one of the basic human

rights of all men.

Before 1776, white people were colonized by the Eng-

lish. The English government had certain laws and rules

that the colonized Americans viewed as not in their best

interests but as a colonized people. At that time the Eng-

lish government felt that the colonized Americans had no

right to establish laws to promote the general welfare of

the people living here in America.

The colonized Ameri-

can felt he had no choice but to raise the gun in defense of o

the welfare of the colonized people.

At this time, he made

certain laws insuring his protection from external and in-

ternal aggressiong

from governinents and agencies. One

such form of protection was the Declaration of Indepen-

dence, which states:

"... whenever any government be-

comes destructive to these ends, it is the right of the

people to alter or to abolish it,

to institute a new git-

ernment, laying its foundations on such principles and or-

ganizing its powers in such forms as to

them shall seen:

most likely to effect their safety and happiness.

Now these same colonized white people, these ex-

slaves, robbers, and thieves, have denied the coloniver

black man the right to even speak of abolishine this ip-

pressive system which the white colonied Ameramn ire-

ated. They have carried their madness to the for inte

ners of the earth, and now there is universal rebellion

against their continued rule and power.. The Black perple

in America are the only people who can free the world,

loosen the yoke of colonialism and destroy the war :ia-

chine. As long as the wheels of the imperialistic war ma-

chine are turning there is no country that can defeat this

monster of the West. But Black people can make a mal-

function of this machine from within.

Black people can

destroy the machinery that's enslaving the world. Ameri-

ca cannot stand to fight every Black country in the world

anù sigin a civil müo it the one inno. It is militaril;

impossible to do both of these things at once.

The slavery of Blacks in this country provides the oil

tor the machinery of war that America uses to enslave the

peoples of the

world. Without this oil the machinery can-

not function. We are the driving shaft; we are in such a

strategic position in this machinery that, once we become

dislocated, the functioning of the remainder of the machin-

ery breaks down.

Penned up in the ghettos of America, surrounded by

his factories and all the physical components of his eco-

nomic system, we have been made into "the wretched of

the earth, " who are relegated to the position of spectators

while the white racists run their international con game on

the suffering peoples.

We have been brainwashed to be-

Lieve that we are powerless and that there is nothing we

can do for ourselves to bring about a speedy liberation for

our people.

We have been taught that we must please our

oppressors, that we are only ten per cent of the population,

and therefore, we must confine our tactics to categories

calculated not to disturb the sleep of our tormentors.

The people must repudiate the

vided, confused; fighting amöng ourselves, we are still

in the elementary stage of throwing rocks, sticks, empty

wine bottles and beer cans at racist cops who lie in wait

for a chance to murder unarmed Black people. The racist

cops have worked out a system for suppressing these spon-.

taneous rebellions that' flare up from the anger, frustra-

tion, and desperation of the masses of Black people.

We

can no longer afford the dubious luxury of the terrible

cagualties wantonly inflicted upon us by the cops during

these spontaneous rebellions.

Black people must now move, from the grassroots up

through the perfumed circles of the Black bourgeoisie, to

seize by any means necessary a proportionate share of the

power vested and collected in the structure of America.

We must organize and unite to combat by long resistance

the brutal force used against us daily. The power struc-

ture depends upon the use of force within retaliation. This

is why they have made it a felony to teach guerilla wartare.

This is why they want the people unarmed.

The racist dog oppressor fears the armed people; they

fear most of all Black people armed with weapons and the

ideology of the Black Panther Party For Self Defense. An

unarmed people are slaves or are subject to slavery at any

given moment. If a government is not afraid of the people

it will arm the people from foreign aggression. Black

people are held captive in the midst of their oppressors.

There is a world of difference between thirty million un-

armed, submissive Black people and thirty million Black

people armed with freedom and defense guns and the stra-

tegic methods of liberation.

When a mechanic wants to fix a broken-sown car en-

gine, he must have the necessary tools to do the job.

When the people move for liberation, they must have the

basic tool of liberation: the gun. Only with the power of

the gun can the Black masses halt the terror and brutality

perpetuated against them by the armed racist power @truc-

ture; and in one sense only by the power of the gun can the

whole world be transformed into the earthly paradise

dreamed of by the people from time immemorial. One

successful pro-titioner of the art and science of national

liberation and self defense, Brother Mao 'I'se-tung, put at

if forced to, we will tear it down.

"In Defense of Self Defense"

July 3, 1967

Historically, the power structure has demanded thet

Black leaders cater to their desires and to the ends of the

imperialistic racism of the oppressor. The power struc-

Pture has endorsed those Black leaders who have reduced

themselves to nothing more than apologizing parrots.

- They have divided the so-called black leader's within the

political arena. The oppressors sponsor radio programs,

give space in their racist newspapers, and have shown

them the luxury enjoyed only by the oppressor. The

Black leaders servethe oppressor by purposely keeping

the people submissive and passive - non-violent. At any

moment that these so-called Black leaders respond to the

cries of the suffering and downtrodden, unemployed and

welfare recipients who hunger for liberation by any

means necessary.

Historically, there have been a few Black men who

have rejected the handouts of the oppressor and who have

refused to spread the oppressor's treacherous principles

of deceit, gradual indoctrination and brainwashing, and

who have refused to indulge in the criminal activity oi

teaching submission, fear, and love for an enemy who

hates the very culor black and is determined to conunit

genocide on an international scale.

There has always existed in the Black colony of Afro-

America a fundamental difference over which tactics

from the broad spectrum of alternatives Black people

should employ in their

struggle for national liberation.

NW 65360 Docld:32989647 Page 576

## Page 577

One side of this difference contends that Black people

are in the peculiar position where, in order to gain

ac-

ceptance into the "mainstream" of American life, they

must employ no tactic that will anger the oppressor

whites. "This view holds that Black people constitute"

hopeless minority and that salvation for Black people lies

in developing brotherly relations, There are certain

tactics that are taboo. Violence against the oppressor

must be avoided at all costs, because the oppressor will

retaliate with superior violence. So Black people may

protest, but not protect. They can complain, but not cut

and shoot. In short, Black people must at all costs re-

main non-violent.

On the other side of the difference, we find that the

point of departure is the principle that the oppressor has

no rights that the oppressed is bound to respect. Kill the

- the Black masses and recommended this response to the

The

opposition to the oppressor. Because the oppressor al-

,ways prefers to deal with the less fadical, i.e., less

dangerous, spokesmen for his subjects.

He would pre.

fer that his subjects had no spokesmen at all, or better

yet, he wishes to speak for them himself. Unable to du

this pra-tically, he does the next best thing, and endorses

spokesmen who will allow him to speak through them to

the masses. Paramount amongst his imperatives is to

see to it that implacable spokesmen are never allowed

to communicate their message to the masses. They are

never allowed to communicate their message to the

masses:. Their oppressor will resort to any means

necessary to, silence the implacables.

The oppressor, the endorsed spokesmen, and the

implacables form the three points of a triangle of death.

The oppressor looks upon che endorsed spokesmen as a

tool to use against the implacables to keep the masses

passive within the acceptable limits of the tactics he is

capable of containing. The endorsed spokesmen look

15?

. NW 65360 Docld:32989647 Page 577

---

## Page 578

upon the oppressor as a guardian angel who can always be

depended upon to protect them from the wrath of the im-

placables, while he looks upon the implacables as dan-

gerous and irresponsible madmen who, by angering the

oppressor, will certainly provoke a blood bath in which

they themselves might get washed

away. The implacables

view both the oppressors and the endorsed leaders as his

deadly enemies.

If anything, he has a more profound

hatred for the endorsed leaders than he has fur the op-

pressor himself, because the implacables know that

they can deal with the oppressor only after they have

driven the endorsed spokesmen off the scene.

Historically, the endorsed spokesmen have always

held the upper hand on the implacables. In Afro-Ameri:

can history, there are shining brief moments when the

*-implacables have outmaneuvered the oppressor and the

endorsed

spokesmen and gained the attentign of the

Black masses. The Black masses, recognizing the

implacables in the depths of their despair, respond

magneiically lo the implacables and bestow a devotion

and loyalty to them that frightens the oppressor and en-

dorsed spokesmen into a panic-stricken frenzy, and

they leap into a rash act -- murder, imprisonment, or

exile -- to silence the implacables and to get their show

back on the ruad.

The masses of Black people have always been

deeply entrenched and involved in the basic necessities

of life. They have not had time to abstract their situ-

ation. Abstractions come only with leisure. The

people have nut had the luxury of leisure. Therefgre,

the people have been very aware of the true definition

of pulitics: pulities are meroly the desire of individuals

and groups to satisfy first, their basic neers --food,

sholter and clothing, and security for themselves and

their loved ones. The Black loaders endorsed by the

power structure have attemptir lo

sell the people the

sirtiple-minded theory that polities 1s holding a political

office; being able to more into a 510, 000 home; being

able to sit near white people in a restaurant (while in

The Black leaders have led the community to believe

that brutality and force could be ended by subjecting the

people to this very force of self-sacrificing demonstra-

tions.

The Black people realize brutality and force can

only be inflicted if there is submission. The community

has not responded in the past of in the present to the ab-

surd and

erroncuus, deceitful tactics of so-called legiti-"

mate Black leaders.

The community realizes that force

and brutality can only be eliminated by counter force

through self defense. Leaders who have recommended

these tactics have never had the support and following

Marcus Garvey and Malcolm X were the two Black

men of the twentieth century who posed an implacable

" challenge to both the oppressor and the endursed spokes-

men that could be dealt with in any other way than pre-

cisely the foulemanner recorded by history. Malcolm,

in our time, stood on the threshhold with the oppressor

and the endorsed spokesmen in a bag that they couldn't

get out of. Malcolm, implacable to the ultimate degree,

held out to the Black masses the historical, stupendous

victory of Black collective salvation and liberation from

the chains of the oppressor and the treacherous embrace

of the endorsed spokesmen. Only with the gun were the

black masses denied this victory. But they learned from

?

But first, they must respect the party which is trans-

mitting this message. When the Vanguard group destroys

the machinery of the oppressor by dealing with him an

small groups of three and fuur, and then escapes the

might of the oppressor, the masses will be overjuyed

and will adhere to this corroct strategy. When the masses

hear that a gestapo policeman has been exicuted while

sipping coffee at a counter, and the revolutionary execu-

tioners fled without being traced, the masses will see the

validity of this type of approach to resistance. It is not

necessary to organize thirty million Black peuple in pri-

mary groups of two's and three's but it is important for

the party to show the people how to en about revolution.

During slavery, in which no vanguard party existed and

forms of communication were severely restricted and in-

sufficient, many slave revolts uccurred.

There are basically three ways ope can learn:

throgh tudy. through observation.oand through aitual

experience. The black community is basically composed

of gotivists. The community learns through activity,

either through observation uf or participation in the acti-

vity. Iu study and learn is good but the actual experience

is the best means

of learning. The party must engage in

activities that will teach the people. "The black community

is basically not a reading community. Therefore it is

very significant that the vanguard group first te activists.

Without this knowledge of the black community, one could

not gain the fundamenial knowlodge of the black revolution

in racist America.

The main function of the party is to awaken the people

and to teach them the strategic method of resisting the

power structure, which is prepared not only to combat the

resistance of. the people with massive brutality, but to

totally annihilate the black community, the black popula-

tion.

If it is learned by the power structure that black peo-

this wil

The end

result of this education will be positive for

Black people in their resistance and negative for the

structure in its oppression, because the party al-

ways exemplifies revolutionary defiance. If the party

is not going to make the people aware of the tools of lib-

erationand the strategic method that is to be used, there

will be no means by which the people will pe mobilized

properly.

The relationship between the vanguard party and the

masses is a secondary relationship. The relationship be,

tween the members of the vanguard party is a primary

relationship. It is important that the members of the van~

guard group maintain a face-to-face relationship with each

other.

This is important if the party machinery is to fe

effective. It is impossible to put together functional party

machinery or programs withut this direct relationship.

The members of the vanguard group should be tested revo-

lutionaries.

This will minimize the danger of Uncle Tom

_ informers and opportunists.

The main purpose de vanguard group should be to

raise the

consciousness of the masses through educational

programs and certain physical activities the party will

participate in.

The sleeping masses must be bombarded

with the correct approach to struggle through the activi-

ties of the vanguard party. Therefore, the masses must

know that the party exists. The party must use all means

available to get this information across to the masses. If

the masses do not have knowlerge of the party, it will be

impossible for the masses to follow the program of the

party.

The vanguard party is never underground in the be-

ginning of its existence, because this would limit its ef-

fectiveness and educational processes. How can you

teach people if the people do not know and respect you?

The party must exist above ground as long as the dog

power structure will allow, and hopefully when the party

is forced to go underground the message of the party will

alrearly. have been put across to the people. The vanguard

party's activities on the surface will necessarily be short-

lived.

157

NW 65360 • Docld:32989647 Page 581

## Page 582

This is why it is so important that the party make a

tremendous impact upon the people before it is driven into

secrecy.

At this time, the people know the party exists, and

they will seck out further information on the activities of

this underground

party,

Many would-be rovolutionaries work under the falla-

cious illusion that the vanguord party is to be a secret

organization that the power structure knows nothing about,

and the masses know nothing about, except for occasional

letters that come to their homes by night. Underground

parties cannot distribute leaflets announcing an under-

ground meeting.

These are contradictions and inconsis-

tencies of the so-called revolutionaries. The so-called

revolutionaries are in fact afraid of the very danger that

they are advocating for the people. These so-called revo-

lutionaries want the people to say what they themselises.

are afraid to say, and the people to dó

what they them-

selves are afraid to do. This makes the su-called revoiu-

tionary a coward and a hypocrite.

If these imposters would investigate the history of

revolution, they would see that the vanguard group always

starts out above ground and is later driven underground

by the aggressor. The Cuban Revolution exemplifies this

fact; when Fidel Castro started to resist the butcher

Batista and the American running dogs, he started by

speaking on the campus of the University of Havana in

public. He was later driven to the mulls. His impact upon

the dispossessed people of Cuba was very greatyand re-

ceived with much

respect. When he went into secrecy,

. Cuban people searched him out. People went to the hills

to find him and his band of twelve. Castro handled the

revolutionary struggle correctly. If the Chinese Revolu-

tion is investigated, it will be seen that the Communist &

Party was quite on

the surface so that they would be able

to muster support from the masses.

There are many

areas one can read about to learn the correct approach,

such as the revolution in Kenya, the Algerian Revolution,

Fanon's THE WREICHED OF THE EARTH, the Russian

Revolution, the works of Chairman Mao Ise-tung, and a

most of others.

158

A revolutionary must realize

at if he is

sincere,

"death is imminent due to the fart that the things he is

saying and doing are extremely dangerous.

Without this

realization, it is impossible to proceed as a revolutionary.

The masses are constantly looking for a guide, a Messiah",

to liberate them from the hands of the oppressor. The

vanguard party must exemplify the characteristics of

worthy leadership. Millions and millions of oppressed

people might not know members of the vanguard party

personally or directly, but they will gain through an in-

direct acquaintance the proper strategy for liberation via

the mass media and the physical activities of the party.

It is of prime importance that the vanguard party develop

a political organ, such as a newspaper produced bfathe

party, as well as employ strategically revolutionary art

and destruction of the oppressor's machinery. For ex-

ample, Watts.

The economy and property of the oppres.-

sor was destroyed to such an extent that no matter how the

oppressor tried to whitewash the activitles of the black

orothers, the real näture and the reai cause of the actavity

was communicated to every black community. For further

example, no matter how the oppressor tries to distort and

confuse the message of Brother Stokely Carmichael, Black

people all over the country understand it perfectly and

welcome it.

The Black Panther Party for Self Defense teaches

that in the final analysis, the amount of guns and defense

weapons, such as hand grenades, bazookas, and other

necessary equipment, will be supplied by taking these

weapons from the power structure, as exemplified by the

Viet Cong. Therefore, the greater the military,

tion on the part of the uppressor, the greater : prepara-

ability of weapons for the black community. It is believed

by some hypocrites that when the people are taught by the

vanguard

group to prepare for. resistance, this only

brings the man down on them with increasing violence and

brutality; but the fact of the matter is that when the man

becomes more oppressive, this only heightens the revo-

lutionary fervor. The people never make revolution. The

oppressors bu their brutal actions cause the resisiance by

the people. The vanguard party only teaches the correct

methods of resistance. Su, if things can get worse for

159

NW 65360 Docld:32989647 Page 583

---

## Page 584

oppressed

people, then they will feel no need for revolu-

tion or resistance. The complaint of the hypocrites that

the Black Panther Part for Self Defense is exposing the

people to deeper suffering is an incorrect observation.

People have proved that they will not tolerate any more

oppression by the racist dug police through their rebel-

lions in the black communities across the country. The

people are looking now for guidance to extend and

strengthen

their resistance struggle.

FEAR AND DOUBT

By Huey P. Newton

May $3, 1967

The lower

socio-economic Black male is a man uf

confusion. He faces a hostile environment and is not sure

that it is not his own sins that have attracted the hostili-

ties of societv. All his life he has been

taught (explity

and implicitly) that he is an inferior approximation of hu-

manity.

As a man, he finds himself void of those things

that bring respect and a feeling of worthiness. He looks

around for something tu blame for his situation, but be-.

•cause he is not sophisticated regirding the socio-cconom-

ic milieu

and be ause of negativistic patentalud institu-

tional teachings, he ultimately blames himsoli.

When he was a child, his parents told him that they

were not affluent because "we didn't have the opportunity

to become educated, " or "we did not take advantage oi the

educational upportunities that were offered to us." They

tell their children that things will be different fog them if

they are educated and skilled, but that there is absolutely

nothing other than this occasional warning (and often not

even this) to stimulate education. Black people are great

worshippers of education, even the lower socio-economic

Black person, but at the same time, they are afraid of

exposing themselves to it. They are afraid because they

are vulnerable to having their fears verified; perhaps they

will find that they can't compete with white students. The

Black person tells himself that he could have done much

more if he had really wanted to. The fact is, of course,

that the assumed educational opportunities were never

160

NW 65360 Docld:32989647 Page 584

---

## Page 585

available to the lower socio-economic Black person due

to the unique position assigned him in life.

It is

a two-headed monster that haunts this man.

First, his attitude is that he lacks innate ability to cope

with the socio-economic problems confronting. him, and

second, he tells himself that he has the ability but he sim-

ply has not felt strongly enough to try to acquire the skills

needed to manipulate his environment. In a desperate

effort to assume self-respect, he rationalizes that he is

lethargie; in this way, he denies a possible lack of innate

ability. If he openly attempts to discover his abilities, he

and others may

see him for what he is - or is not, and

this is the real fear. Tie then withdraws into the work of

the invisible, but not without a struggle. He may agtempt

to make himself visible by processing his hair, acquiring

a "boss mop", or driving a long car, even though he can't

afford it. He may father several illegitimate children by

several different women in urder to display his mascu-

linity.

But in the end, he realizes that be is ineffectual

in his efforts.

Society responds to him as a thing, = beast, a non-

entity, something to be ignored or stepped on.

He is

asked to respect laws that do not respect him. He is

asked to digest a code of ethics that acts upon him but not

for him. He is confused and in a constaht state of rage,

of shame and doubt. This psychulogical set permeates

all his interpersonal relationships.

It determines his

view of the social system. His psychological develop-

ment has been prematurely arrested. This doubt begins

at a very early age and continues through his life. The

parents pass it on to the child and the social system rein-

forces the fear, the shame, and the doubt. In the third

or lourth grade, he may find that he shares the classroom

with white students, but when the class is engaged in

reading exercises, all the Black students find themselves

in a group at a table reserved for slow readers.

This

may be quite an innocent effort on the part of the school

system.

The teacher may not realize that the Black stu-

dents feared (in fact, feel certain) that Black means dumb

and white means"

'smart. The children do not roalize that

the head

start the children got at home is what accounts

for the situation. It is generally accepted that the child

is the father of the man; this holds true for the lower

socio-economic Black peuple.

161

With whom, with what can he, a man, identify? As

a child he had no permanent male figure wish whom tu

irentify; as a mar, he sees nothing in society with which

he can identify as an extension di himself. His life is

buill on mistrust, shame, doubt, guilt, inferiority, rule

confusion, isolation and despair.

He frels that he is

something less than

a man, and it is evident in his con-

versation: "the white man is 'THE MAN', he got every-

thing, and he knows everything, and a nigger ain't noth-

ing. "

In a society where a man is valued arcording to

occupation and material possessions, he is without pos.-

sessions. He is unskilled and more often than not, either

marginally employed or unemployed. Oftenhis wife (who

is able to secure a job as a maid cleaning for white peo-

ple) is the breadwinner.

He is, therefore, viewed as

quite worthless by his wife and children. It is ineffec-

tual both in and out of the home.

He cannotprovide for

or protect his family. He is invisible, a nan-entity. So-

?. ciety will not acknowledge him as a man. Meris a con-

sumer and not a producer. He is dependentupon the

white man ('THE MAN') to feed his family, to: give himja

job, educate his children, serve as the maid'that he .

tries to emuiate. He is dependeni and le intes 'THE

MAN' and he hates himself. Who is he? Ishe a very old

adolescent or is hesthe slave he used to be?

What did he do to be so BLACK and blue?

• California, State Capitol Building:

The Black Panther Party for Self Defese calls upon

the American people in general and the Back people in

Legislature which is now considering legislation aimed at

keeping the Black people disarmed and poverless at the

country are intensifying the terror, brutality, murder

* and repression of Black people.

At the same time that the American government is

waging a racist war of genocide in Vietnam, the concen-"

tration camps* in which Japanese Americans were in-

terned during World War Il are being renovated and ex-

panded. Since America has historically reserved the

most barbaric treatment for non-white people, we are

forced to conclude that these concentration camps are

being prepared for Black people who are determined to

gain their freedom by any means necessary. The en-

slavement of Black people from the very beginning of this

country, the genocide practiced on the American Indians

and the confining of the survivors on reservations, the

savage lynching of thousands of Black men and women,

the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki,

and. now the cowardly massacre in Vietnam, all testify to

the fact that towards people of color the racist power

struciuse di americ: has but me policy: repression. e

genocide, terror, and the big stick.

'Black people nave begged, prayed, petitioned, dem-

onstrated and eerything else

to get the racist power

structure of Amerita to right the wrongs which have his-

torically been perpetrated against Black people. All of

these efforts have been answered by mure repression,

deceit, and hypocrisy. As the aggression of the racist

American government escalates in Vietnam, the police

agencies uf America escalate the repression of Black

people throughout the ghettos of America. Vicious police

dogs, cattle prods and increased patrols have become

familiar sights in black communities. City Half turns a

deaf ear to the pleas of Black people for relief from this

increasing terror.

The Black Panther Party for Self Defense believes

that the time has come for Black people to arm them-

selves against this terror before it is too late. The

pending Mulford Act brings the hour of doom one step

nearer.

A people who have suffered so much for so long

at the hands of a racist society, must draw the line soine-

where. We believe that the Black communities of Ameri-

ca must rise up as une man to halt the progression of a

trend that leads inevitably to their total destruction.

Policemen, pused as such, and thereby gained entrance

they were contending for control of the boutlegging indus-

entry through their disguise as Policemen, proceeded

SPONSOR: Criminal Justice Curriculum (under a

$79,000 grant from Office of Law Enforcement

PROGRAM: 15 one-week conferences over a two-

year period--it is "the first project ever con-

ducted in the United States"

• The first conference

is to be held May 25-30 and is entitled "Recruitment

and Retention of Police Personnel". (This certainly

sounds innocent enough; take the exampie of the

Cakland Police Dept. They use the most modern,

computerized psychogical and sociological testing

methods to duplicate exactly the racist pigs they now

have. Oakland then retains them with the highest

wage scale and fringe benefits in the country (even

PARTICIPANTS: Command-level. offirers from the nation's

32 largest cities.

LCCATION: University of Illinois at Chicago Cirrle: the

conferences

are

to be located in Chirago because this

location is "geographically centrally located an ideal base

for criminal justice training." Chicago also happens to be

the home of "Shoot to Kill" Daley andthe most computerized

and motorized Pig Dept. and one of the most victmizeci

and brutalized black and Latin communities insthe country.

JUSTIFICATION: The director of the program states that

"UICC has acknowledged its role as an urban center

university with a responsibility to assist in the solution

of urban problems". In reality, the University: does not

feel a responsibility to serve the people of the community.

but the racist power structure. The solution of urban

problems can mean anything from a radical restructuring

of our society to genoride against the black community.

What Police Institutes Are About

The pigs ase coming duns in the piupico Tie sucisi parce dauriure la scien

because large numbers of black, brown and white people are understanding what this country

and the pigs are all

about. The more we understand, the harder we fight. And the harder

we fight, the greater is the threat to the political, economic and social control of this country

by the racist power structure. And when the people in power feel threatened they respond

in the only way they can- with force and violence.

is the number of black rebellions, campus revolts, labor strikes, welfare marches anó

sit-ins, rent strikes, etc., increase, the yower structure afd its pigs become increasingly

incapable of stopping the people and are forced to develop newer, more sophisticated methods

what police institutes like the one at the l'niversity of Illinois at

Chicago Circle and the one on police technology at IlT are all about.

"Just Doin' My Job"

We often hear about how the cop is "just doing his job". That's certainly true enough;

but what exactly is his "job"? The actions of the police in the black and brown communities

make that clear. Try telling any ghetto dweller that the police are in his community to protect

the people. He knows that is a lie-they are there to protect private property, to function as

an "occupsing army" to protect the property of the outside — generally white— businessman.

When the

"showdown" between property and people's lives comes the pigs will always side

with the businessman. The order that Daley gave last April —*Shoot to kill"-was no mistake.

Ogilvie's statement upon sending in the National Guard-*Property Must Be Protected* -

meant the same thing— the property of storeowners and slumlurds is to be maintained at the

cost of human lives.

Pigs serve three

repressive functions in what we will call the black and brown internal

colonies. This is not to say that the pigs are not repressive in white neighborhoeds; the brutal

attachs on white jouth--students, dropouts, gang kids, and us an increasing extent while

workers-should

dispel that idea. The pigs function

in a similar manner in white

neighborhoods but it is obvious that the repression brought down on the black and bren

communities is not only mure Intense given the nature of this racist society, but it is of

174

NW 65360 Docld:32989647 Page 598

## Page 599

5 a qualitatively different nature from the way whiles are treated.

The police function first to maintain "law and order"; the law which

the capitalist class has developed to protect its wealth and property and

the order which it needs to maintain its power. The pigs are the armed

force which is used to "Serve and Protect"

the rulers of this country.

Police are assigned to patrol the neighborhords, schools, hangouts and

parks. Any deviation from their ideas as to what constitutes sood behavior"

is met with brutal force. They occupy and surround the high schools (black,

brown and white to keep any opposition to the rutten educational system

from "getting out of hand". Actually they act more like guards in a prison,

which is

what

the high schools function

a5.

in the past year they have

increased the size of the gang intelligence unit (GIl) from 38 to over 200.

The GIl watches, spies on, harasses and intimidates anyone they define

as being a member of a "gang".

Second, police act to destroy the dignity and spirit of resistance which

is so widespread in the black and brown communitics. They verbally and

physically abuse and intimidate people on the street-men,

women, and

young people are forced to undergo constant harassment, intimidation and

coercion-stop and frisk, curfew violations, no standing on corners, women

just walking down the street.at night humillated or arrested for prostitution.

The strect becomes the cops' turf.

The people who run this country are elther unwilling or unable to meet

the needs of the people; they are more cuncerned with maintaining their

wealth and nower.

The people need and are demandling:

*equality and an end to discrimination

*an end to the fighting and dying? in wars which are fought to protect

the rulers' business interests

*jobs which provide

& program in Lincoln Park which expels Latin families. from thefr homes and apartments

to be replaced by upper-middle-income white professionals. 'The pigs have come down hard

on the Lords as a result of their involvement in these struggles. Cha Cha Jimenez, president

of the YID, has been arrested au least 10 times in the past few months on charges ranging

from disorderly conduct to curfew violations to mob action. Lords are continually harassed

on the streets by the pigs.

We occasionally hear it said that the fault lles with the individual policeman, and that he

"educated". But the hatred for the police comes not as a resull of the actions

of the individual cop but as a response to the functions (outlined above) which the police play.

Those of us who were in the park during the Convention this summer or who live in black

or Spanish communities know that it doesn't matter if a cop is a PhD or a grade school

dropout because once he puts on the uniform, he begins to "do his job".

The police have not acquired

any new functions; they have historically been tools of the

ruling class. They helped the slaveowners to keep the slaves "in their place" and prevented

slave rebellions. They served the industrial bosses and robber barons, men like Jay Gould

and Andrew Carnegie, in breaking strikes-stopping picket lines, protecting scabs and

brutally beating, sometimes killing, striking men and

women. They helped the company

owners during the thirties when working

men

and women lought for unions and a decent

standard of living. Even todas they help to suppress wildeat strikes.

WHAT TO DO

way see be car that thail committe vil not in any

people or the youth of this country; will not in any way help to

solve the serious problems we face-racial 'inequality,

imperialist wars, poverty. In fact, by emphasizing a policy of

overwhelming police power and continued repression it may

aggravate the problems.

We must expose and educate people to understand the role

of this institute and the pigs. We must demand that*this

institute be stopped.

While we demand that the police institute get off the Chicago

Circle campus, it is not because we see the University as

some sort of

"ivory tower" which must besprotected from

vuiside influentes. The university- with its police institutes;

war research, military and corporate recruiting, ROTC-is

as much a part of the racist power structure as any other

institution. We want the pig institute off the campus as a first

step to stopping it permaneñtly. If it is moved off the campus

and

into the .community we will organize to stop it there.

Cur program should be based on the demand: STOP THE PIG

INSTITUTE.

charged by Cook County authorities with serious crimes;

as the victims are in custody, the attorneys themselves bare

not. had the opportunity for thorough interviews of their

clients. WOLFSON stated he wanted to emphasize the fact

that statements in the news

and their attorneys are not necessarily true as the allorrays

have not authorized such statements. WOLFSON further states

that due to the seriousness of the charges pending agains:

the victims, their attorneys would undoubtedly desire to

be present during any FBi interviews.

--

reluctant to authorize an FBI interview with his client,

insist upon obtaining a copy of the results of any fbi

intervier.

Digest of Opinion: The pre-emption argument is without

merit. The state sinute deals with registration of duners

only, whereas the ordinance is for regastration of respons

themselves. There is no inconsistency or repugnancy betucen

the 1850.

Although the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution

provides that the right of the people du keep and hear arms

shall not be intringed, gun control that does not impir tie

efficiency of the staie's active, organised militia (iNationl

Guard). does nos siolate the Amendment.

In the living roon, forty-tve bullet entrance holes

were noted in the south wall, a bullet entrance hole was

noted in the left side of the living, room doorframe, a

bullet entrance hole was found in a white four drawer

dresser in the living room with an accompanying exit hole

in the back of the dresser, an impression of a bullet

that keyholed and struck one of the dresser drawers of s

black double dresser but did not exit the dresser and an

area in the northwest corner of the living room approximately

80" from the floor that had been previously explored that

could have represented either a bullet hole or shot pattern.

A.. The bullets producing the forty-tvo entrance

holes in the south wall of the living room all enteres

the front bedroon. Some penetrated the south wall

of the front bedroom traveling through the partitio

and entered the back bedroom.

It was possible, by

plotting bullet trajectories fron the living coon

through both north and

south wall partitions in tha

front bedroom, to establish that ninetcen of the

forty-two bullets fired into the south wall of

the living room entered the back bedroom.

One of the bullets fired through the south

wall of the living room entered the closet in

the front bedroom and exited through the closet

in the back bedroom.

• C. The -bullet hole in the left doorframe of the

Iving room door was 57 1/4* from the floor. The

bullet had been removed previously. Its trajecton

was nearly at right angles to the doorframe and lere:

with the floor.

bullet holes in the east wall of the front bedrocm, three

bullet holes through the east wall of the closet in the

front bedroom and five bullet holes in a dresser in the

front bedroom.

A. Two shot patterns in the north wall of the

front bedroom were produced by one or more shotgas

firing shotshells loaded with Number 7 1/2 or § shot.

These patterns were 47" and 56"' from the northics:

corneI of the front bedroom and 42" and 31" fros as:

fl00r respectively. The trajectory of these shats

established that they mere fired from the hallry

through the open door to the front bedroon. Pieses

: of lead shot were Iccovered from both holes.

B. The third shot pattern on the north wall of sae

front bedroom was produced by a shotgun firing à scossne:

loaded with 00 Buck. It was established that cae

one pair of pants on a viro hanger was found to hase

been struck with is shot from

two shotgun chaiges.

One charge

struck the lover left front of the cont below the

pocket

opening. The shot penetrated the pants near the bolt line ar=

through the rear pocket which was probably hanging downara

from the pants on the hanger. The pollets exited through the

lower left back of the coat.

The shot dispersal is typical

of that which would be fired at roughly a 150 angle to the

right of. the front of the coat. The pattern is typical of

one produced at a distance of from six to nine feet.

A second charge struck the lower portion of the

right sleeve.

An exit hole was in the back of the right sleare

and a small number of pellets entered the lower right front

of the coat below. the pocket opening.

The shot producing

the hole in the sleeve was fired ai approximately right

angles to the material oi the sleeve, aiso at a distance of

from

six to nine feet. Hased on shot dispersai.

organize black people do they can take control of the lifc., politics, and the

destiny of the black community. It was organized by sol by George Scale,

In conducting this search, the following matters

The: arrests were completed between approximately

5:30 a.Mo and 6:00 a.m, and it would not be possible to

prepare detailed affidavits for search warrant and appear

before the U.S. Commissioner. or a District Court judge

for several hours.

The building had been prepared with electrical

devices and with solid steel doors and iron doors and bars

placed over entrances, exits and windows, thusly preventing

any entrance without breaking and entering and with

use of firearins.

Several weapons were present and seized

and it is known to Agents that this organization calling

themselves the Black Panthers has consistently stated that

attempts to search or to effect arrests would be violently

resisted, even with firearms.

That attempts to enter the building had met with

no co-operation of any kind from persons in the buildings

any future attempts to enter would undsubtedly be met

in the same way, necessitating an armed force sufficient

to effect the execution of a search warrant, thus making

impractical to obtain and effect a search by warrant

on the same day.

BLACK PANTHER PARTY, AlSO

Known As Black Panther Parti

for Self-Defense

According to its official neuspaper, the black Panther

Party (BPP) was sturted during Dicember, 1905, in Oakland,

California, to organize black people so they can take control

of the life, politics and the destiny of the black community.

It was organized by BOBBY SEALE, BPP Chairman, and HUEY P.

NEWTON, BPP Minister of Defense:

NEWTON was sentenced 1x 1968

to serve 2 to 15 years after being convicted of manslaughter

in connection with the killing of an Oakland police officer.

The official

newspaper,

"The Black Panther," which

further describes itself as the "Black Community News Service,'

states that the BPP advocates the use of guns and guerrilla

tactics in its revolutionary program to end oppression of the

black people.

Residents of the black community are urger to

arm themselves against the police who are consistently referred

'to in the publication as "pigs" who should be killed.

"The Black Panther" issue of September 7, 1968, contains

an editorial by BPP Minister of Education, GEORGE MASON MURRAY,

which ends with the following:

"Black men. Bluck people, colored persons of

America, revolt everyshere:

Arm yourselves.

The only culture

worth keeping is a revoiutionary culture.

Change. Freedom

everywhere.

Dynamite: Blark Power. Use the gun. Kill the

pigs everywhere."

Included in the introduction to an article appearing

in the October 5, 1969, edition of

'The Black Panther"

is the

statement "

....we will

not dissent from American Government.

He will overthrow 1t.

Issues of "The Black Panther" regularly contain

quotations Irom the writings of Chairnan Mao Tse-tung of the

People's Republic of China and feature Mao's statement that

"political power grows out of the barrel of a gun."

The national heñdavurters of the BeD te located at

3106 Shattuck Avenue, Berkeley; California.

Branches have

been established at various iscations throughou: the United

BLACK PANTHER PARTY, AlSO

Known As Black Panther Party

for Self-Defense

According to its officlal newspaper, the Black Fanther

Party (BPP) was started during December, 1966, in Oakland,

California, to organize black people so they can take control

of the life, politics and the destiny of the black community.

It was organized by BOBBY SEALE, BPP Chairman, and HUEY P.

NEWTON, BPP Minister of Delense. NEWTON was sentenced in

1968

to serve 2 to 15 years after being convicted of manslaughter

: 1Д

connection with the killing of an Oakland police officer.

The official

newspaper,

"The Black Panther," which

further describes itself as the "Black Community News Service,"

states that the BPP advocates the use of guns and guerrilla

tactics in its revolutionary program to end oppression of the

black poople.

Rasidents of the black community are urged to

arm thenselves against the police who are consistently referred

to in the publication as "pigs" who should be killed.

"The Black Panther" issue of September 7, 1968, contains

an editorial by BPP Minister of Education, GEORGE MASON MUIRAY,

which ends with the following:

"Black men.

Black people, colored persons of

America, revolt everywhere!

Arm yourselves.

The only culture

north keeping is a revolutionary culture.

Change. Freedon

everyabers.

Dynamite! Black Power. Use the gun. Kill the

Digs everywhere."

Included in the introduction to an article appearing

in the October 5, 1958, edition of "The. Black Panther" is the

statement

#il1

not dissent fron American Government.

He will overthrow it."

Issues of "The Black Panther" regularly contain

quotations Iron the writings of Chairman Mao Ise-tung of the

People's Republic of China and feature Mao's statement that

"political poper groys out of the barrel of a gun."

The national headquarters of the BPP is located at

3103 Shattuck Avenue, Berkeley, California.

Branches have

been established at various locations throughout the tuited

States.

STUDENTS FOR A DIMOCRATIC SOCIETY

A source bas advised that the Students. for a

Denocratic

Society (SDS), as it is known today, came into

balag at a founding convention held at Port Huron, Michigan;

In June, 1962. From an initial ideological posture of

"participatory democracy," the current line of the national

leadership revals an adherence to Marxism-Leninism.

MICHAIL FLONSKY, National Secretary, in March, 1969, called

fog the building of a revolutionary Marxist-Leninist movement.

The progran of SDS has moved from Involvement in civil rights

struggles to an anti-Vletnam war position and linally to

its present advocacy oi an

anti-imperialist line, linking

up the oppressed peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America

with the black liberation movement in the United States.

China, Vietaam and Cuba are regarded as countries which

leading the world-wide struggles against United States imperial-

15N.

on the other hand, SDS regards the Soviet Union as

an imperialiat power 1d does not support the polices of

that country.

SDS maintains a National Office in Room 206, 160&

West Madison Straet, Caicago, Illinois..

Its official paper

"Now Left Notes" reilacts the line of the national leadership

and progran adopted at

meetings of the National Council and

National Interim Committee (NIC). Three national officers

and a NIC of eleven members are

elected each year during a

• June National Convention.

SDS Regional Oifices and university and college

chapters elect delegates to National Council meetings wherein

program and ideology are debated, but each Region and chapter

is autonomous in nature and is free to carry out independent

¿policy and programs reflective of local conditions.

BLACK PANTHER PARTY, AlSO

Known As Black Panther Party

I0I Seli-Defense

According to its official newspaper,

the Black Fanther

Party (BPP) was started during December, 1966, in Oakland, •

California, to organize black people so they

can take control

of the life, politica and the destiny of the black community.

It was organized by BOBBY SEALE, BPP Chairman, and HUEY P.

NEVION, BPP Ninister of Defense. NEWTON was sentenced in

• 1968

to serve 2 to 15 years alter being convicted of manslaughter

• in

connection with the killing of an Oakland police officer.

The ofíicial newspaper,

"The Black Panther," which

Lurther describes itself as the

"Black Community News Service,"

states that the BIP advocates the use of guns and guerrilla

tactics in its revolutionary program to end oppression of the

black people.

Residents of the black community are urged to

arm thenselves against the police who are consistently referred

to in the publication as "pigs" who should be killed.

"The Black Panther" issue of Septenber 7, 1968, contains

an editorial by Bpp Minister oi Education, GEORGE MASON MUKRAY,

which ends with the following:

"Black aes.

Black people, colored persons of

Amesica, revolt everybare:

Arm yourselves.

The only culture

worth keeping is a revolutionary culture.

Change. Freedom

everywhere. Dynamite! Black Power. Use the gun. Kill the

pigs everynhere."

Included in the introduction to an article appearing

in the October 5, 1968, edition of "The Black Panther" is the

statement "

• . . . Re

#111

not dissent from American Goveinment.

He will overthrow it."

Issues of "The Black Panther" regularly contain

quotations from the writings of Chairman Mao Tse-tung of the

People's Republic of China and feature Mao's statement that

"political power gions out of the barrel of a gun."

The national headquarters of the BPP is located at

:.

3106 Shattuck Avenue, Berkeley, California.

Branches have

been established at various locations throughout

the thited

States.

STUDENTS FOR A DENOCRATIC SOCIETY

A source bas advised that the Students for a

Danocratic Society (SDS), as it is known today, came into

balag at a founding conyention held at Port Huron, Michigan,

in June, 1962. From an initial ideological posture of

"participatory denocracy," the current line of the national

lesdership reveals an adherence to Marxism-leninism.

• MICHAEL BLONSKY, National Secretary, in March, 1969, called

log the building of a revolutionary

Marxist-Leninist movement.

Tha program oi SDS has moved from involvement in civil rights

struggles to an anti-Vietnam war position and finally to

its present advocacy of an anti-imperialist line, linking

up the oppressed peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America

The simple firebomb is a bottle of gasoline with a rag

stuffed into the top.

When the rag is set on fire, the

bottle is thrown.

When the bottle breaks, the fumes

are spreaa, and

the fire from the, buning rag ignites

the fumes, causing a fireball.

To make a firebomb without having to throw it, a device

must be attached to the bottle if gasoline which will

explode the bottle at a given time, spreading the fumes:

and furnishing a spark with which to ignite these tunes.

In order to make such a "timed firebomb", the basic

ingredients are: one half gallon or gallon jug or hi-

grade gasoline, to which attach a piece tape:

One small time explosive which

is made from these ingredients

are l Jetex fuse, 1402 cartridge.

powder from any iifle pistol

GRENADES, AND BOMES, ANTI-PROPERTY AND ANTI-PERSONNEL

No. 1.

The very small, home-made grenade is exactly

theasame a

the snall explosive device used to set off

the firebomb.

It is the CO2 cartridge as described in the

preceding directions, only instead of using a cigarette

to time the fuse, you can light the luse and throw it.

This little CO 2

cartridge just as it is doesn't do a

lot of danage, but it can be dressed up to become a very

lethal weapon. It can be made into a deadly anti-

personnel weapon or a very dangerous bomb.

The saall CO2 cartridge can be dressed up by fifling

with 3/4 black powder and 3/1 shot, or needles.

This is

obvioulsy anti-personnel and will ponetrate when the CO2

explodes, but still is not big enough to kill. It has

certain advantages, however. It can be taped to a window,

even with your hands behind

your back, and leit burning

the trusty cigarette. Ur ii could be lupeú, mili

the cigarette in the fuel tank of a car.

If throun into

a car, it 1s'guaranteed to bruise the occupants and

empty the car of all personnel in record time. Further,

the COz is so small 1t can easily be concealed on pour

person.

Now, to make an actual grenade, a weapon that kills, the

following can be done:

Take a used, empty aerosol can, pull off the

little plastic spray device, and with a hammer and nail

pound the little plastic nipplo down into the can. Use

a punch or screwdriver with hammer to widen the hole and

make it large enough so that large shot can be inserted

through the hole.

Then fill with 3/1 black powder and

1/1 bullets or small-hoaded nails.

Insert fuse, and

light when ready to throw..

The fuse should be an inch and

a half in length and should leave your hand when itchas

burned to an inch.

CAUTION: The explosive force of this weapon is great.

It is even nore dangerous than a standard army grenade.

Needless

to say, a too-short fuse will result in a

scattered grenade-holder. A too-long fuse will result

In the person or persons.at whom you have thrown it to

chance to throw it back and blow you to fragments.

A guerilla with lousy aim in close quarters can kill his

blasts at once. If thrown into a car it will blow to

bits the car and everything in it, human or otherwise.

If thrown in the open, it will kill within a 25 ft.

radius and mim within

100 11. It is a good idea to

familiarize yourself with this weapon by practicing with

a sand-filled lacsimile.. Try this, and see how long the

fuse takes.

You cannot afford to misuse this in any

way, as its a real notherfucker of a wexpon.

To make a bomb use the same prinetple us for the grenado,

only instead of lighting the fuse and towing it, you

use the cigarette and set the thing down. For a strictly

anti-property bomb, you don't need the siot of nails.

Just the black powder.

A large arount of commercial

dynamite is made with

black powder and that's exactly

the kind of bomb you're building here. Hith this thing,

the sky's the limit.

You can make it as big as you ilke,

depending only on the size of the container, the can

that you use. A large tar-bucket full, sor instance,

would denolish sost any building.

This is a versatile

thing, can be scaled to the size you want.

Used in

_conjunction with gasoline. or set near a fuel tapt or

explosive container, the blast would take an entire

plant anũ lay it cown.

Perhaps the greatest advantage

nere is that'

all ingradients can be bough legally, at

BLACK PANTHER PARTY

According to its official newspaper, the Black Panther Party

(BPP) was started during December, 1966, in Oakland, California, to

organize black people so they can take control of the life, politics, and the

destiny of the black community. It was organized by Bobby George Seale,

BPP Chairman, and Huey P. Newton, BPP Minister of Defense. Newton

is presently serving a sentence vi 2 to 15 years on a conviction of man-

slaughter in connection with the killing of an Oakland police officer.

The official newspaper, "The Black Panther," which further

describes itself as the "Black Community News Service," states that the

BPP advocates the use of guns and guerrilla tactics in its revolutionary

program to end oppression of the black people. Residents of the black

community are urged to arm themselves against the police who are con-

sisiently reierred to in the publication as "pigs" who should be killed.

"The Black Panther" issue of September 7, 1968, contains an

editorial by BPP Minister of Education, George Mason Murray, which

ends with the following:

"Black men. Black people, colored persons of America,

revolt everywhere! Arm yourselves.

The only culture worth keeping

is a revolutionary culture. Change. Freedom everywhere. Dynamite!

Black Power. Use the gun. Kill the pigs everywhere."

Included in the introduction to an article appearing in the

October 5, 1968, edition of "The Black Panther" is the statement, "

...

we will not dissent from American Government. We will overthrow it."

Issues of "The Black Panther" regularly contain quotations

from the writings of Chairman MAO Tse-tung of the People's Republic

of China and feature MAO's statement that "political power grows out of

the barrel of a gun."

• * The national headquarters of the BPP is located at 3106 Shattuck

had failed and they returned to Robbins about midnight.

• On April 2, 1969, Chief

aaron Stout, Robbins, Illinois

PD, advised that investigation indicates that during the last cay

or so, a group of Negro youths, possibly Blackstone Rangers, a

south side Chicago Negro youth

gang, came to Winston's Tavern

and Skin's Tavern, attempting to recruit local Negro youths.

He

stated that it was reported that one of the owners of one of the

above taverns or a member of the Black Panther Party (BPP) was

present and "flattened" several of the recruits.

He stated that as a result of this incident, it is

alleged that the Rangers returned to Robbins during the night

of April 1, 1969, and entered a tavern owned by Merrial Chandler,

male, Negro, age 50, l41st and Claire, Robbins, and shot

BLACK PANTHER PARTY

According to its official newspaper, the Black Panther Party.

(BPP) was started during December, 1966, in Oakland, California, to

organize black people so they can take control of the life, politics, and the

destiny of the black community. It was organized by Bobby Grurge Scale,

BPP Chairnun, and Huey P. Newto?, UP!' Minister of Defense. Newton

is presently serving a sentence vi 2 to 15 years on a conviction of man-

slaughter in connection with the killing of an Oakland police officer.

The official newspaper, "The Black Panther," which further

describes itself as the "Black Community News Service," states that the

BPP advocates the use of guns and guerrilla tactics in its revolutionary

program to end oppression of the blick people. Residents of the black

community are urger to arm themselves against the pulice who are con-

sistently referred. i in the publication as "pigs" who should be killed.

"The Black Panther" issue of September 7, 1968, contains an

editorial by BPP Minister of Education, George Mason Murray, which

ends with the foilowing:

"Black men. Black people, colored persons of America,

revolt everywhere! Arm yourselves.

The only culture worth keeping

is a revolutionary culture. Change.

Freedom everywhere. Dynamite!

Black Power. Use the gun. Kill the pigs everywhere."

Included in the introduction to an article appearing in the

October 5. 1968, edition of "The Black Panther" is the statement, "

we will not dissent from American fivernment. We will overthrow it."

Issues of "The Black Panther" regularly contain quotations

from the writings of Chairman MAO Tsc-tung of the People's Republic

of China and feature MAO's statement that "political power grows out of

the barrel of a gun."

The national headquarters of the BPP is located at 3106 Shattuck

Avenue, Berkeley, California. Branches have been established at

various locations throughout the United slates.

evidence had been discovered

supporting the police version in the form of bird shot

of the raiding officers. Johnson attributed the

pellets to non-police weapons "because any policeman

who used birdshot would be laughed out of the station."

The pellets were reportedly found in the north wall

claimed that Hampton and Clark had been murdered but

that it was the product of a conspiracy "in retaliation

for the killing of two white policemen by Panthers in a

recent shootout on the Southside." The story said Rush

claimed that "officer John Cizefski, a member of

Report of the January 1970 Grand JurY

I INTRODUCTION

At 4:45 a.m.,

December 4, 1969, fourteen Chicago

police officers assigned

to the Cook County States At-

torneys Office, executed a search warrant for illegal

weapons at 2337 West. Monroe/a flat tandombe rented

by members of the Black Panther Party. Nine people were

in the apartment. Iwo were killed instantly in the

gunfire which broke out: Fred Hampton, the militant

and controversial Chairman of the Black Panther Party

of Illinois, and Mark Clark, a Panther member from

Peoria. Four other occupants were wounded, but

survived.

•

Two police officers sustained minor injuries.

:..

Public reaction was prompt and polarized.

The

States Attorneys Office accounts, at first sketchy and

then more detailed, related that the officers were fired

upon as they sought entry, that they returned the fire

and secured the premises after an intense gun battle

with the occupants;

The officers recovered il weapons,

•including a stolen police shotgun, a sawed off shotgun,

and various handguns. A large quantity of ammunition

was seized. According to their account they had no

Knowledge that Fred Hampton was in the apartment, but

did report that Hampton was found lying on a bed with

an automatic pistol and a shotgun next to

his body.

Black Panther spokesmen immediately clained

that Hampton and Clark were victims of a Chicago-style

political assassination pursuant to an official national

Events preceding federal grand jury investigation

Between the time of this incident on December 4,

1969, and the impaneling of this grand jury on January 5,

1970; the air was full of charges and counter charges

concerning what happened.

escalation of public explanations, disputes, versions

and commentary is instructive in understanding the way

to cali for surrender.

The occupants shouted

"shoot

ensued; Fred Hampton was found dead in a back bedroom

from'which gunfire had been seen, and Mark Clark was

fourd-in the living room. Nineteen weapons and large

'stores of ammunition were

a reporter described a tour given newsmen by Rush

showing the only bullet holes "in the spread and mat-

-was-quoted as charging "Hampton was murdered in bed

while he slept, since he was a light sleeper,. some

murdered him with a silencer" (Chicago Today, Dec. 4,

The basic controversy continued to receive

Mr. Hanrahan's statement had little effect on

the burgeoning controversy. On the same day the

above article appeared, another uper was reporting

•that nine Democratic Congressmen had requested the

_National Connission on the Causes and Prevention of

Violence to investigate the matter. They asked the

President to extend the commission for this purpose

and in a letter to the Connission reportedly set out

the basis for their concern: "There were indications

Ervanian explained that all background information would

be reviewed including "arrest records from the raia,

physical evidence, statements from witnesses, and

was too early to tell whether it would be necessary

to require the officers to take lie detector tests.

intensive news coverage began when the Chicago Daily

IncErs this arccunt was matched in

The following day's issue of the Chicago Iribune in

¿Pubizoned an exclusive detailed

account given by the of-

Ificers:

"State's Attorney Edward V. Hanrahan made

the policemen available for interviews (tol refute

what he termed de orgy of sensationalism in the press

and on television." The exclusive Tribune story also

contained photographs supplied by Hanrahan and his top

assistants Jalovec and Boyle, "which they said con-

clusively proved the-Panthers opened the battle by

firing a shotgun blast thru the apartment door."

In this story, the leader of the raid, Sgt.

Daniel Groth, said that he and Assistant States At-

torney Jalovec had both received confidential infor-

mation on December 2, that a cache of weapons

was in

...

• the apartment. "According to the informants, at least

three shotguns had been observed in the flat.

Neither,

however, made any mention of Hampton's or Clark's fre-

guenting the martment, Sgt. Groth said."

At 4:45 p.m.; on December

3, according to the

story, "Jalovec obtained

a search warrant from Judge

Robert Collins of Criminal Court, citing the facts

obtained from the informants.".

-.In the story, Sgt. Groth told of planning the

raid and

selecting the early morning hours to avoid

an incident and to provide safety for his men and

-

neighbors: Groth's account of the way the shooting

started was the most detailed one to date:

Then police spotted

a third Panther

member in the room, Ronald Satchel, 19,

of 2337 Monroe st., who also surrendered.

He also had been

wounded.

In both bedrooms, police found

large stores of arms and ammunition. In

Hampton's back bedroom, four boxes of am-

munition. In Hampton's back bedroom,

four boxes of shotgun

shells were found

as well as shotguns, a rifle, and hand

guns. Similar caches were in the front

==÷-

bedroom, some of it in a flight bag."

•

On the evening of December 1l, the exposure of

detailed accounts again increased.. Using a mock-up

St the apartment built in the States Attorney's office,

2'28 minute televised reenactment was presented

on

WBBM-TV. In the reenactment each officer acted out

and described his part in the raid. The essentials

Were the same as had been presented in the Tribune

exclusive, except that in the reenactment officer

Gorman described how he and officer Davis, blocked from

proceeding down the hallway by Panther gunfire, fired

their weapons (45 caliber sub-machine gun and a 30

cäliber carbine respectively) through the living.room

wall" and into the bedroom area. According to a Daily

News television columnist the following day, the reenact-

ment was given to WBBM with the provision that "nearly

the entire police version be broadcast without inter-

ruption." He also reported that "other local TV

stations reported they had

been offered the same story

possibility, but news directors there say they had re-

fused to work under Hanrahan's restrictions."

The media controversy reached a new high on

December 12 when the Sun Times exposed the fact that

_ the picturea. that accompanied the Tribune "exclusive"

had been erroneously described. After visiting the

apartment the Sun Times reporter claimed that the

picture of bullet holes near the kitchen door were in

fact nail holes and-that-the photo purporting to show

- the bathroom door (proving that the Panthers had fired

from the front bedroom) was in fact a picture öf the

door to the front bedroom which had been struck by

police bullets fired through the living room wall. The

State's Attorneys office and the Tribune both acknowledged

the mistake, but no explanation of how it occurred was

provided.

There was also a further development with

respect to the use of polygraph tests.

A front page

headline in Chicago today proclaimed "Hanrahan Lie Test

Challenge to Panthers."

The story quoted a press con-

terence statement by the States Attorney that he had

refused

request by the officers to take lie detector

tests "for fear that granting it would suggest some

doubt-on our part."

MI. Hanrahan

was quoted as

challenging the occupants to submit to such

tests

saying that if they did so permission would be granted

for the officers

to do likewise (Chicago Today 12/12).

The next day the

same paper quoted Panther leader

Rush as rejecting

the challenge because "I wouldn't

-trust, the people who would be administering the lie

test...and once the police get you and lock you up

in a room, they can get you to say anything they want.

you to say." Rush also repeated his earlier alle-

gations of a planned police murder.

He described how

the police arrived in an unmarked truck full of machine

guns and cordoned off the block. "Like buzzards wait-

sing for the kill, they waited outside until the lights

rent off *** Using a

detaled map of the apartment,"

Bush said, Patrolman Edward Carmody and John Cizewski

were to shoot Fred while a detail led by Sgt. Daniel

Groth were taking care of business in the front."

Rush concluded that murder indictments should be issued

He stated that

economic oppression leads to all other kinds of oppression

that racism cannot be fought with racism but must be

conference the additional individuals spoke:

Reverend Calvin Morris, Chicago, Illinois who

represented the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.

In that connection Morris remarked that all must join in

the defense philosophically of the BPP, adding that everyone

in a repressive society is threatened.

He stated that talk

is insufficient and that revolution must take place.

Dr. Nathan Wright, Jr., Professor of Urban Affairs,

State University of New York then spoke and characterized the.

threat of counterviolence as being vioience was incorrect.

He added that it is the American tradition to arm for counter-

attack, and that those in positions of power, who advocate

law and order obtained their positions by reason of violence.

He stated that unless the black people are given equity then

they should say no to the "masters".

Arthur Kinoy, an Attorney and Professor at Rutgers

University Law School, New Jersey, stated that the BPP has

the central task in operating the

movement of the people at

the present time. He said that the enemy moves out of weakness

and tear and are afraid of movements in the ghettos and

universities as well as being afraid of the peace movement.

He added that the ruling class was unable to solve the

problems of sub-society and in that connection emphasized

that the BPP because of their power structure was vital in

defending the rights of minority peoples.

He called upon

the conference to plan for the political

defense of the BPP

under a national campaign. Sammy Rayner from Chicago then

Laws and who were then free on appeal of their convictions.

One of the speakers was Tom Hayden of that group, who stated

By way of

example, he said that a person who is a racist and fears a

revolutionary will create illegal acts, what usually happens

is that illegal acts happen against the revolutionary. Hayden

also remarked that if the peace movement is unable to

wa within the United States it can never end the war in

Vietnam. He emphasized that a massive educational campaign

must be organized within the United States to bring the

of grievances on the question of racism. He added that tha

workshop called for organizing picket lines in front of

department stores in the various cities.

The Reverend Charles Yerkes of New York City

community action and education workshop in which he stated

that this workshop called for a massive educational campaign

on repression and that some of the means that should be

records, eic.;

2) That a national newsletter be established;

3) That a center for literature and information,

approximately 700 people, predominantly blacks, attended

a "People's Inquest" held at the First Congregational Church,

40 North Ashland Avenue, which inquest was being conducted

by the Illinois Chapter

that the "jury" for the "Inquest" consisted of four men

The "coroner" appointed to conduct the "inquest" was

DI. Charles G. Hurst, President of Malcolm X College.

Jewel Cook, Field Secretary of the Illinois

Chapter, BPP, performed the duties of the "prosecution".

At this affair a movie was shown which reportedly

was a reconstruction of the police raid held on December 4,

leaders Fred Hampton and

Mark Clark were slain,

police, even though he was badly wounded.

Another survivor of the raid was Harold Bell

from Rocklord, Illinois, He stated that he

had

been pulled

from the room

before he

could come to the assistance of

Fred Hampton. Blair Anderson,a former BPP member and a

survivor of the raid stated that he had been beaten and

cursed by the police even though not wounded. Deborah

Johnson, another survivor of the raid testified that she

had been in the back room of the apartment with fred Hampton

and that as Hampton raised his head he was shot by the raiders.

She testified that it was possible that Hampton was asleep

when he was killed.

Donette Brewer, another survivor of the raid

testifted that in addition to being kicked and cursed,

even though wounded she fell from a stretcher as the

raiders roughly carried her down the steps of the apartment.

Louls Truelock, another survivor of the raid did

not testify before the "Inquest".

Sources five and six stated that the "coroner"

pronounced that the "jury" had found the BPP survivors

innocent of any crime and that the raiders were guilty

of murder. The "coroner" reportedly remarked that we

the people now ask for appropriate action by the state

and hold States Attorney Edward Hanrahan and his police

in contempt of the people.

Both sources stated that the "inquest" was

APPENDIX

BLACK PANTHER PARTY, AlSO

Known As Black Panther Party

for Self-Delense

...

According to its official newspaper, the Black Panther

Party (BPP) was started during December, 1966, in Oakland,

California, to organize black people so they can take control

of the life, politics and the destiny of the black community.

It was organized by BOBBY SEALE, BPP Chairmin, and HUEY P.

NEWTON, BPP Minister of Defense.

NEWTON was sentenced in 1968.

to serve 2 to 15 years

after being convicted of manslaughter

in connection with the killing of an Oakland police officer.

The official newspaper,

"The Black Panther," which

further describes itself as the "Black Connunity News Service,"

states that the BPP advocates the use of guns and guerrilla

tactics in its revolutionary program to end oppression of the

black people.

Residents of the black community are urged to

arn thenseives against the police who are consistently referred

to in the publication as "pigs" who should be killed.

"The Black Panther" issue of September 7, 1968, contains

•an editorial by BPP Minister of Education, GEORGE MASON MURRAY,

which ends with the

following:

"Black men.

Black people, colored persons of

America, revolt everywhere! Arm yourselves. The only culture

worth keeping is a revolutionary culture. Change. Freedom

everymbere. Dynamite! Black Power. Use the gun. Kill the

pigs everywhere."

Included in the introduction to an article appearing

in the October 5, 1968, edition of "The Black Panther" is the

statement

....we will

not dissent from American Government.

He will overthrow it."

-

Issues of "The Black Panther" regularly contain

quotations from the writings of Chairman Mao Tse-tung of the

People's Republic of China and feature Mao's statement that

"political power grows out of the barrel of a gun."

The national headquarters of the BPP is located at

3106 Shattuck Avenue, Berkeley, California. Branches have

been established at various locations throughout the United

states..

STUDENTS FOR A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY

A source has advised that the students for a Demorratic

Society (SDS), as presently regarded, came into being at

founding convention held June, 1962, at Port Huron,

Michigan.

From an initial posture of "participatory democracy" the line

of the national leadership has rovonled a growing Marxist-

Leninist adherence which currently calls for the building of

a revolutionary youth movement.

Concurrently, the program

of SDS has evolved Iron civil rights struggles to an anti-

Vietnan war stance to an advocacy of a militant anti-imperialist

position.

China, Vietnam and Cuba are regarded as the leaders

of worldwide struggles against United States imperialism whereas

the Soviet Union 1s held to be revisionist and also imperialist.

At the June, 1969, SDS National Convention, Progressive

Labor Party (PLP) forces in

the organization were expelled.

As a result, the National Office (NO) group maintained its

National Headquarters at 1608 West Madison Street, Chicago,

and the PLP faction set up headquarters in Cambridge,

Massachusetts.

This headquarters subsequently moved

to

Boston.

Each

group elected its own national officers, which

Include three national secretaries and a National Interim

Committee of eight. Both the NO forces and the PLP forces

claim to be

the

true SDS.

Both groups also piint their

versions of "New Left Notes" which sets forth the line

and

the

program of the particular faction.

The NO version of "New

Left Notes" was recently printed undor the title "The Elre

Next Time" to achieve a broader mass appeal.

Two major factions have developed internally within

the NO group, namely, the Weatherman or Revolutionary Youth

Movement (RY) I faction, and the RYM II faction.

Weatherman

is action oriented upholding Castro's position that the duty

of revolutionaries is to make revolution.

Weatherman Is

regarded by RYM II as an adventuristic, elist faction which

denies the historical role of the working class as the base

• for revolution.

RYU II maintains that revolution, although

desired, is not possible under present conditions, hence

emphasizes organizing and ratsing the political consciousness

of the working class upon whom they feel successful revolution

depends.

Although disclaiming control and domination by the

Communist Party, USA, leaders in these two factions have in

the past proclaimed themselves to be communists and to follow

the precepts of a Marxist-Leninist philosophy, along pro-

Chinese communist lines.

A second source has advised that the PLP faction which

Is more commonly known

as the Worker Student Alliance is dominated

and controlled by members of the PLP, who are required to

identify themselves with the pro-Chinese Marxist-Leninist

nomena ho

philosophy of the PLP.

They advocate that an alliance between

workers and students is vital to the bringing about of a

revolution in the United States.

SDS regions and university and college chapters.

although operating under the outlines of the SDS National

Constitution, are autonomous in nature and

free to carry out

independent policy reflective of local conditions. Because

of this autonomy internal struggles reflecting the major factional

Incerests of SDS have occurred at the chapter level since

,the beginning of the 1969-70 school year.

of the establishment of a militant working class movement

based on harxism-Leninism.

This is to

be accomplished

through

the Party's over-all revolutionary strategy of raising the

consciousness of the people and helping to provide ideological

leadership in the working class struggle for state power.

Convention MILTON POSEN was unanimously re-elected National

Chairman of the PLP and LEVI LAUB, FRED JEROME, JARED ISRAEL,

WILLIAM EPTON, JACOB ROSEN, JEFFREY GORDON, and WALTER LINDER

the next convention.

The PLP publishes "Progressive Labor," a bimonthly

magazine; "World Revolution," a quarterly periodical; and

"Challenge-Desafio," a monthly newspaper.

AppENDIX

BLACK PANTHER PARTY

According to its official newspaper, the Black Panther Party

(BPP) was started during December, 1966, in Oakland, California, to

organize black people so they can take control of the life, politics, and the

destiny of the black community. It was organized by Bobby Gorge Scale,

BPP Chairman, and Huey 1. Newion, BPP Mmister of Defense. Newton

is presently serving a sentence u1 2 to 15 years on a conviction of man-

slaughter in connection with the killing of an Oakland police officer.

The official newspaper, "The Black Panther," which further

describes itself as the "Black Community News Service," states that the

BPP advocates the use of guns and guerrilla tactics in its revolutionary

program to end oppression of the black people. Residents of the black

community are urged to arm themselves against the police who are con-

sistently reterred to in the publication as "pigs" who should be killed.

"The Black Pinther" issue of September 7, 1968, contains an

editorial by BPP Minister of Bducation, George Mason Murray, which

ends with the following:

"Black men. Black people, colored persons of America,

revolt everywhere! Arm yourselves. The only culture worth keeping

• is a revolutionary culture. Change. Freedom everywhere. Dynamite!

Black Power. Use the gun. Kill the pigs everywhere."

Included in the introduction to an article appearing in the

October 5, 1968, edition of "The Black Panther" is the statement, "

.. .

we will not dissent from American Government. We will overthrow it."

Issues of "The Black Panther" regularly contain quotations

from the writings of Chairnun MAO Tse-tung of the People's Republic

of China and feature MAO's statement that "political power grows out of

the barrel of a gun."

The rational headquarters of the BPP is located at 3106 Shattuck

Avenue, Berkeley, California.

Branches have been established at

various locations throughout the United States.

BLACK PANTHER PARTY

According to its official newspaper, the Black Panther Party

(BPP) was started during December, 1966, in Oakland, Califurnia, to

organize black people so they can take control of the life, politics, and the

destiny of the black community. It was organized by Bobby George Seale,

BPP Chairman, and Huey P. Newton, BIP Minister of Defense. Newton

is presently serving a sentencc vi 2 to 15 years on a conviction of man-

slaughter in connection with the killing of an Oakland police oilicer.

The official newspaper, "The Black Panther," which further

describes itself as the "Black Community News Service," states that the

BPP advocates the use of guns and guerrilla tactics in its revolutionary

program to end oppression of the black people. Residents of the black

community are urged to arm themselves against the police who are con-

sistently referred to in the publication as "pigs" who should be killed.

"The Black Panther" issue of September 7, 1968, contains an

editorial by BPP Minister of Education, George Mason Murray, which

ends with the following:

"Black men. Black people, colored persons of America,

revolt everywhere! Arm yourselves. The only culture worth keeping

is a revolutionary culture. Change. Freedom everywhere. Dynamite!

Black Power. Use the gun. Kill the pigs everywhere."

Included in the introduction to an article appearing in the

October 5, 1968, edition of "The Black Panther" is the statement, "

...

we will not dissent from American Government. We will overthrow it."

Issues of "The Black Panther" regularly contain quotations

from the writings of Chairman MAO Tse-tung of the People's Republic

of China and feature MAO's statement that "political power grows out of

the barrel of a gun."

The national headquarters of the BPP is located at 3106 Shattuck

Avenue, Berkeley, California. Branches have been established at

various locations throughout the United States:

two Black Panther members as "baseless". The article

continued as follows:

The rumors began Friday after Berkey had a

neeting with Illinois Black Panthers, Fred Hampton and

Bob Rush.

Hampton and Rush had agreed to speak on

campus but had been promised a certain amount of money

for doing so.

Berkey said that the Chicago Regional SDS

"implied a comnitment that we weren't aware-of".

Although

the money promised Hampton and Rush

"began at $1000

because that is the way you do things", Berkey said that

the commitment. is now substantially less.

He would not

reveäl the sum of money that SdS owes the Panthers, but

he said that SDS organizationally will fulfill its commit

"as we always do"

When Hampton and Rush arrived on campus and

found that the money was not forthcoming, they were upset,

and Berkey went into a meeting with them

to try and

straighten things out.

The Panthers were also angry

because some black students were supposed to arrange

housing for them and failed to do so.

During the time that Berkey was out of communi-

cation, rumors began to arise that he had been abducted

because of the failure to pay Hampton and Rush. Berkey

said that the Panthers and SDS enjoy a good relationshi!

but that people often do not know how to relate to the

Panthers.

Berkey said, "they have done the best organisin!

BLACK PANTHER PARTY

According to its official newspaper, the Black Panther Party

(BPP) was started during December, 1966, in Oakland, California, to

erganize black people so they can take control of the life, politics, and the

destiny of the black community. It was organized by Bobby George Seale,

BPP Chairman, and Huey P. Newton, BPP Minister of Defense. Newton

is presently serving a sentence vi 2 to 15 years on a conviction of man-

slaughter in connection with the killing of an Oakland police officer.

The official newspaper, "The Black Panther," which further

describes itself as the "Black Community News Service," states that the

BPY advocates the use of guns and guerrilla tactics in its revolutionary

program to end oppression of the black people. Residents of the black

community are urged to arm themselves against the police who are con-

sisienily referred in in the publication as "pigs" who should be killed.

"The Black Panther" issue of September 7, 1968, contains an

editorial by BPP Minister of Education, George Mason Murray, which

ends with the following:

"Black men. Black people, colored persons of America,

revolt everywhere! Arm yourselves. The only culture worth keeping

is a revolutionary culture. Change.

Freedom everywhere. Dynamite!

Black Power. Use the gun. Kill the pigs everywhere."

Included in the introduction to an article appearing in the

October 5, 1968, edition of "The Black Panther" is the statement, "

we will not dissent from American Government. We will overthrow it."

Issues of "The Black Panther" regularly contain quotations

from the writings of Chairman MAO Tsc-tung of the People's Republic

of China and feature MAO's statement that "political power grows out of

the barrel of a gun."

The national headquarters of the BPP is located at 3106 Shattuck

• JAMES HAROLD IVORY

On December 20, 1969, Captain Wilbert samuels, Maywood,

Illinois, Police Department, advised an agent of the Chicago

Office of the Federal Bureau of investigation (FBI) that Ivory's

Mob Action trial was transferred from Oak Park, Illinois, into

Chicago, Illinois, and continued.

On January 13; 1969, a representative of the Chicago

Office of the FBI reviewed the records of the Chicago, Illinois,

Police Department concerning James Ivory's June 6, 1964,

disorderly arrest and it was determined that the record of

this arrest was on microfilm and not readable.

On February 26, 1969, Captain Samuels, Maywood, Illinois,

Police Department, advised an agent of the Chicago Office of the

FBI that Ivory's

Mob Action trial commenced in Cook County Court

on that date and that the jury selection will commence on

February 27, 1969.

On February 28, 1969, Captain Samuels advised an agent

of the Chicago Office of

the FBI that the jury has been selected

at ivory's Mob Action trial and 1t continues.

However, Captain

-Sanuals noted Ivory's attorney moved that any testimony by Maywood

Village Counsel Robert Grundin be not allowed and the motion was

granted. Captain Samuels explained that Grundin would have

testified of how at Chamber of Commerce Dinner two days after

the July 30, 1968, mob action incident but prior to Ivory's

arrest

Ivory bragged to a group at the dinner of how he (Ivory)

had led the Maywood Negro youths to the Village Hall on July 30,

1968.

BLACK PANTHER PARTY

According to its official newspaper, the Black Panther Party

(BPP) was started during December, 1966, in Oakland, California, to

organize black people so they can take control of the life, politics, and the •

destiny of the black community. It was organized by Bobby Grorge Scale,

BPP Chairman, and Huey P. Newton, Bl! Minister vi Defense.

Newton

is presently serving a sentence vi 2 to 15 years on a conviction of man-

slaughter in connection with the killing of an Oakland police officer.

The official newspaper, "The Black Panther," which further

describes itself as the "Black Community News Service," states that the

BPY advocates the use of guns and pucrrilla tactics in its revolutionary

program to end oppression of the black people. Residents of the black

community are urged to arm themseiven against the police who are con-

sistently referred to in the publication as "pigs" who should be killed.

"The Black Panther" issue of September 7, 1968, contains an

editorial by BPP Minister of Education, George Mason Murray, which

ends with the following:

"Black men. Black people, colored persons uf America,

revolt everywhere! Arm yourselves. The only culture worth keeping

is a revolutionary culture. Change. Freedom everywhere. Dynamite!

Black Power. Use the gun. Kill the pigs everywhere."

Included in the introduction lo an article appearing in the

October 5, 1968, edition of "The Black Panther" is the statement, "

we will not dissent from American Government. We will overthrow it."

Issues of "The Black Panthor" regularly contain quotations

from the writings of Chairman MAO Tse-tung of the People's Republic

of China and feature MAQ's statement that "political power grows out of

the barrel of a gun."

The national headquarters of the BPP is located at 3106 Shattuck

Avenue, Berkeley, California. Branches have been established at

various locations throughout the United Slates.

like CARSWELL, the WADE brothers seemed to have become afraid

of coming to

the

meeting and afraid of possible future

trouble because d their involvement with the BPP. ' He stated

some of these members may drop out.

The informant also noted that NATHANIAL JUNIOR was

not present. Informant beard that the trouble in Summit-argo

wherein the woman was burned and beaten arose because she would

not produce a gun she had been keeping for someone else.

Informant heard from a former girl friend in Summit

that NATHANIAL JUNIOR waS trying to kill

the woman and

a boy:

One DENNIS HARVEY, also of Summit was with JUNIDE and HAMPTON

was giving orders. During the torture and beating JUNIO and the

others were scared off when they heard someone coming.

At the meeting on May 5, 1969, BRUCE and ALLEN

stated that if HAMPTON is sentenced on May 13, to a term in prison

they were going

to try to blow up the Maywood

Polier station

There will be a BPP trial on this coming Friday

night May 9, 1969, for FRED HAMPTON.

This trial is in

keeping with the BPP rules that say

that a BPP member

must be tried by black persons of his own standing in the

community and the trial in court with white judges

and

juries is an improper trial.

The time and place a the

trial are not yet known but present will be members of the BPP

from Chicago, Summit, Maywood and possibly California.

HAMPTON expressed hope that BOBBY SEALE would

also be

there.

HAMPTON

continues to want Sergeant SAMSON to be the

next Chief of Police,

There is a rumor around Maywood,

however, that

Captain WILBEHT SAMUAL will be appointed.

HAMPTON

doesn't want him to be the Chief of Police,

because he is not a Negro.

vitalized lives. Lugman described Malcolm X as a "black

prince"

Source continued that Russ Meek spoke at great

lengths about the necessity of blacks having to start.

getting together and stop selling out to the whites.

Meek's comments concerned blacks getting arms and learning

such

things as karate to help kill the oppressors..

Meek

spoke about each Negro becoming acquainted with his

neighbors so that he may seek shelter and hiding when

whites move against him. Meek stated that all blacks

were not helping their black brothers and the white

man can still overpower the Negro and throw him in jail

to. Meek spoke concerning the Black

Panther Party (BPP), and the fact that this party has

scared many whites

who do not know where they will

strike next.

ORGANIZATION OF AFRO-AMERICAN UNITY,

INCORPORATED (OAAU)

On June 28, 1964, MALCOLM X LITTLE, founder and leader

of the Muslim Mosque,

Incorporated (YMI), publicly announced the

formation of a new, all Negro, militant civil rights action group

to be known as the organization of Airo-american Unity (OAAU),

with himself as Chairman.

This announcement..was made at a public

rally held by the MMI in

the Audubon Ballroom, Broadway and 166th

street, New York City.

A printed and published statement of basic ONAU aims read

by MALCOLM X at this meeting indicates that it shall include "all"

people of African descent in the Western Hemisphere, as well as

"our" brothers and sisters on the African continent. Itis patterned

after the "letter and spirit" of the Organization of African Unity

established (by African heads of States) at Addis Ababa, Ethiopia,

in May, 1963.

A recording of the remarks of MALCOLM X at this meeting

indicates that the aim of the OAAU is to eliminate differences

between Negroes so they can work together for "human rights,"

while the initial objective 1s to "internationalize" the American

civil rights movement by taking it to the United Nations. LITILE

condemned the non-violent civil rights movement and claims that ..

Negroes should be taught to protect themselves, when and if

necessary. The OAAU will sponsor a program for Negroes in

education, politics, culture, economics, and social reform.

MALCOLM X waS assassinated on February 21, 1965, while

addressing an OAAU rally at the Audubon Ballroom, New York City.

BLACK PANTHER PARTY

According to its official newspaper, the Black Panther Party

(BPP) was started during December, 1966, in Oaklana, California, to

organize black people so they can take control of the life. politics, and the

destiny of the black community. It was organized by Bobby George seale,

BPP Chairman, and Huey P. Newton, BPI Minister of Defense. Newton

is presently serving a sentence vi 2 to 15 years on a conviction of man-

slaughter in connection with the killing of an Oakland police officer.

The official newspaper, "The Black Panther," which further

describes itself as the "Black Community News Service," states that the

BPP advocates the use of guns and guerrilla tactics in its revolutionary

program to end oppression of the black people. Residents of the black

community are urged to arm themselves against the police who are con-

sistently referred to in the publication as "pigs" who should be killed.

"The Black Panther" issue of September 7, 1968, contains an

editorial by BPP Minister of Education, George Mason Murray, which

ends with the following:

"Black men. Black people, colored persons of America,

revolt everywhere! Arm yourselves. The only culture worth keeping

is a revolutionary culture. Change.

Freedom everywhere. Dynamite!

Black Power. Use the gun. Kill the pigs everywhere."

Included in the introduction to an article appearing in the

October 5, 1968, edition of "The Black Panther" is the statement, "

- . .

we will not dissent from American Government. We will overthrow it."

Issues of "The Black Panther" regularly contain quotations

from the writings of Chairman MAO Tse-tung of the People's Republic

of China and feature MAO's statement that "political power grows out of

the barrel of a gun."

The national headquarters of the BPP is located at 3106 Shattuck

Avenue, Berkeley, California. Branches have been established at

various locations throughout the United States.

During the weekend of May 31-June 1, 3 or 4

BPP members went around in Maywood and got 200 names on

a petition to free FRED HAMPTON. HAMPTON's older brother,

MURTHY WADE, "BOBBY" CARSWELL and NEAL THOMAS, are the

ones who obtained the petitions.

CARSWELL said that "TACO CHARLIE" has promised

to get ammunition for the BPP. He apparently has a

card of some type which enables him to buy guns and

ammunition. He seems to do everything CARSWELL asks

him

to do.

Informant advised on June 6, 1969:

There was a meeting on June 5, 1969, at the home

OL GENE MOORE, 1423 South Ilth Avenue.

He is a supporter

OF FRED HAMPTON, but not a member of the BPP.

About 50 Negroes were present, mostly BPP

members and they

were all angry about the FBI raid on

BPP headquarters in Chicago.

The discussion centered around the fact that.

the raid must have been set up by someone inside.

They

also claimed the purpose of the raid was to get the

petitions for HAMPTON's release so he would be

kept

in jail. They were all angry about the "theft" of the

money and typewriters by the FBI.

CARSWELL said that NATHANIEL JUNIOR and HARVEY

had "gone south".

CORN NUE d

On November 14, 1969, representatives of

the Federal Bureau of Investigation attended & speech

given by Black Panther Party leader Fred Hampton at

Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois.

A11

those attending the speech were searched

at the entrance

and pictures were taken of

some

of those persons entering.

At 8:40 PM, Joan Gray was incroduced as lead

of the Women's Division of the Illinois BPP. The master

of ceremonies did not introduce himself. Joan Gray

denounced white liberals who lend merely their intellectual

support to the Panther movement, and attacked those/blacks

who espouse black pride and alrican culture.

At 9:00 Pil an individual was introduced as the

Health Minister of the Illinois BPP. This individual described.

the health programs in the ghetto sponsored by the BP?, which

programs are available to all who need them.

Fred Hampton began speaking at 9:10 PM. Hampton

began his speech by indicating his strong disapproval of

the propenents of black pride and culture, stating that

African clothes will not stop a bullet and that the police,

whom he referred to as "pigs", could still shoot blacks

down in the street unless

they defended themselves with guns.

Hampton further denounced the police, stating that more

"pigs"

who were killed, the better for the people.

Hampton compared politics and war to ice and water,

concluding that they are essentially the same substance ano

•can be used for diiferent purposes.

Hampion cited a recent

shooting incident in Chicago Involving Black Panther Jake Winters,

praising Hinters as a true example of a Panther.

Hampton then proceeded to denounce Judge Hoffman

of Chicago in profane and obscene terms, referring to Hoffman

as a homosexual. In describing Hoffman, the adjectives

fracist, racist and

similar terms were used.

Hampton denounced the capitalist system as one where

a minority rose to the top to exploit the majority, and

concluded his speech with the assertion that the BPP was

not

directing its

struggle against ald whites but only against

"fascist racist pigs"

He stated that

those whites who fit

the latter description will be classified by their actions

and not their words.

STUDENTS FOR A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY

A source has advised that the Students for a Democratic

Society (SDS), as presently regarded, came into being at a founding

convention held June, 1962, at Port Huron, Michigan.

From an initial

posture of "participatory democracy" the line of the national Icadership

has revealed a growing Marxist-Lcninist adherence which currently

calls for the building of a revolutionary youth movement. Concurrently,

the program of SDS'has evolved from civil rights struggles to an anti-

Vietnam war stance to an advocacy of a militant anti-imperialist position.

China, Vietnam and Cuba are regarded as the leaders of worldwide

struggles against United States imperialism whereas the Soviet Union

is held to be revisionist and also imperialist.

At the June, 1969, SDS National Convention, Progressive

Labor Party (PLP) forces in the organization were expelled, As a

result, the National Office (NO) group maintained its National Head-

quarters at 1608 West Madison Street, Chicago, and the PLP laction

set up headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts. This headquarters

subsequently moved to Boston,

Each group elected its own national.

officers, which include three national secretaries and a National

Interim Committee of eight, Both the NO forces and the PLP forces

claim to be the true SDS. Both groups also print their versions of

""New Left Notes" which

sets forth the line and the program of the

particular faction. The NO version of "New Left Notes" was recently

printed under the title "The Fire Next Time" to achieve a broader mass

appeal.

Two major factions have developed internally within the

NO group, namely, the Weatherman or Revolutionary Youth Movement

(RYM) I faction, and the RIM Il laction. Weatherman is action-oriented

upholding Castro's position that the duty of revolutionaries is to make

revolution. Weatherman is regarded by RYM Il as an adventuristic

elitist faction which denies the historical role of the working class as

the base for revolution. RYM II maintains that revolution, although

desired, is not possible under present conditions, hence emphasizes

organizing and raising the political consciousness of the working class

upon whom they feel successful revolution depends. Although disclaiming

control and domination by the Communist Party, USA, leaders in these two

factions have in the past proclaimed themselves to be communists and

to follow the precepts of a Marxist-Leninist philosophy, along pro-

Chinese communist lines.

A second source has advised that the PLP faction which

is more commonly known as the Worker Student Alliance is dominated

and controlled by members of the PIP, who are required to identify

themselves with the pro-Chinese Marxist-Leninist philosophy of the

PLF. They advocate that an alliance between workers and students

is vital to the bringing about of a revolution in the United States.

SDS regions and university and college chapters, although

operating under the outlines of the SDS National Constitution, are

autonomous in nature and free to carry out independeut policy reflective

of local conditions. Because of this autonomy internal struggles

reflecting the major factional interests of SDS have occurred at the

chapter level since the beginning of the 1969-70 school year.

A characterization of PLP is attached.

AprIl hU, 2900, page 21, reported that a new party of

"revolutionary socialism" was formally founded on April 18,

1965, under the name of the PIP which had been known as the

Progressive Labor Movement.

Movement was founded in 1962, by Milton Rosen and Mortimei

scheer after they were expelled from the Communist Party

of the United States for assertedly following the Chinese

Communist line."

A source advised on June 3, 1968, that the

PLP

held its Second National Convention

in New

York City,

way 31, to June 2, 1968, ai which time the PLP reasserted

its objective of the establishment of a militant working

class movement based on Marxism-Leninism. This is to be

accomplished through the Party's over-all revolutionary

strategy of raising the consciousness of the people and

helping to provide

ideological leadership in the working

class struggle for state power.

The source also

Convention

Milton Rosen was unanimously re-elected National

chairman of the fur and levi Lauo, fred Jerome,

Jared Israel,

The PiP publishes "progressive Labox," a kimonthly

magazine; "World Revolution," a quarterly periodical; and

"Challenge-Desalio," a monthly newspaper.

The April, 1969, issue of "Challenge-Desafio" sets

forth that "Challenge is dedicated to the peoples fight for

a new way of life-where the working men and women control

their own homes and factories; where they themselves make

up the entire government on every level and control the

schools, courts, police and all institutions which are now

used to control

them."

Source advised on May 8, 1969, that the PLP

utilizes an address of General Post Office Box 808, Brooklyn,
