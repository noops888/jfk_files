{APEARENTLY A NEUSLETTER--UNDERSTAND HE IS NO LONGER ASSOCIATED UITH
LOS ANGELES TIMES ALTHOUGH THEY SYNDICATE HIS MATERIAL} OF Lh DECENGER
ENTITLED "CAN HE BLAME IT ON CIA?" FULL TEXT. BHICH HAS HOT. YET
APPEARED IN ANY PUSLICATION WE KNOW OF, FOLLOWS:
PYASHINGTON--THE LAST TURN IN THE DEFENSE OF. RICHARD
NIXON WILL BE TO BLAME THE WATERGATE ON THE CENTRAL INCTELLIGENCE
AGENCY. SUCH IS THE VIEW OF FORTIER CIA DIRECTOR RICHARD RELMS. AND
SUCH IS THE DIRECTION IN WHICH SEN. HOUARD BAKER IR. TENN} AND HIS
{ MINORITY STAFF ON THE ERVIN COMMITTEE ARE NOW PROCEEDING. IT IS
NOT A VERY SALABLE THEORY. BUT It's ASOUT ALL THAT'S LEFTS AND IF IT &o
COULD BE MADE SALABLEs IT MIGHT EGET RICHARD NIXON OFF THE HOOK.
CONSZDER: IF CIA ACCOMPLISHED THE SREAK-IN. THE SUSSEQUENT WHITE
HOUSE COVERUP MIGHT BE EXCUSED ON THE GROUNDS THAT THE PRESIDENT HAD
j TO PROTECT ZHIS SECRET INTELLIGENCE SERIVCE. AND IF THE ECOVERUP
COULD BE EXCUSED ON THAT GROUND, UNRELATED CRIMES SUCH AS ILLEGAL
