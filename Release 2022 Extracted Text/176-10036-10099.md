WERE KILLED BY THE CIVIL GUARD. EACH OF THESE SEPARATE ACTS HAS

SERVED To WEAKEN THE MOTIVATION OF DIFFERENT SEGMENTS OF VIETNAMESE
AND TO. FURTHER NARROW , POSSIBLY TO A FATAL DEGREE, THE BASE OF

SUPPORT FOR THE REGIME.
2. TUYEN'S DISMISSAL IN

PARTICULAR WOULD CAUSE CONSIDERABLE INSECURITY AMONG LOYAL SUPPORTERS
AND PUBL IC SERVANTS OF ‘THE REGIME WHO KNOW DR. TUYEN'S RECORD OF
LOYAL SERVICE ag THE | Reo DENT AND ESPECIALLY To HIS BROTHER, PRESI-
DENT IAL COUNSELOR NGO DINH NHU. THESE OFFICIALS CAN CERTAINLY

QUEST | ON WHETHER ANYONE ' S POSITION IN THE’ REGIME IS SAFE IF TUYEN
COULD FALL FROM FAVOR.

TUYEN HAD A BAD REPUTATION WITH MANY

OFFICERS IN THE VIETNAMESE ARMY AND BUREAUCRACY AS THE HATCHETMAN
AND TROUBLESHOOTER FOR NGO DINH NHU BUT NO ONE DOUBTED HIS

" BEVOTION TO NHU. YET NHU HAS STRIPPED HIM OF ALL REAL AUTHORITY
SUPPOSEDLY BECAUSE OF A SILLY WOMEN'S TIFF BETWEEN’

MADAME NHU AND MADAME TUYEN. ANY OBJECTIVE GVN OFFICIAL MIGHT

_ QUESTION THE FRIVOLITY, INGRATITUDE AND LACK OF PERSPECTIVE OF A REGIME

THAT ACTS THUS.

INTELLECTUALS PARTICULARLY THOSE FROM NORTH VIETNAM. THOSE wHo

DID NOT LIKE HIM’ AT LEAST TRUSTED HIS FAIRNESS AND BASIC EMPATHY
- WHEREAS THEY NEITHER’ TRUSTED NOR LIKED NHU EVEN THOUGH NHU HIMSELF
WAS AN INTELLECTUAL.

4. WITHIN THE-CAN LAO PARTY, WHICH IS STILL ONE OF THE SECRET
MAINSPRINGS OF SUPPORT. IN VIETNAM FOR THE PRESIDENT AND THE NGO
FAMILY, THE PARALLEL REMOVAL FROM AUTHORITY OF HUYNH VAN LANG HAS
ACCASIONED SIMILAR DOUBTS AMONG THE PARTY'S RANK -AND-FILE. ‘AS IN
TUYEN'S CASE, CAN LAO MEMBERS CAN QUESTION. WHAT VALUE IS LOYALTY .

AND SERVICE IF A MAN LIKE ‘LANG CAN LOSE HIS. POST.

5... THE EVEN MORE SERIOUS MISTAKE WHICH MAY NARROW THE BASE OF
SUPPORT FOR THE GVN TO A FATAL DEGREE WAS THE SHOOTING OF BUDDHIST
PARADERS AT HUE ON THE: OCCASION OF BUDDHA'S BIRTHDAY. . THE HUE
‘REGIME OF CENTRAL VIETNAM COUNSELOR NGO DINH CAN HAS ALWAYS OPERATED
LIKE AN AUTONOMOUS POLICE STATE ‘AND-HAS BEEN NOTORIOUS FOR ITS-
FAVORLTISM TOWARD CATHOLICS; BELYING PRESIDENT DIEM'S
"EARLIER REPUTATION FOR RELIGIOUS TOLERANCE. MANY VIETNAMESE
CATHOLICS FEAR THAT THE GVN'S INCREASING PRO-CATHOLIC SENT WILL BE
HARMFUL TO. THE CHURCH.AS WELL AS TO. THE REGIME. CERTAINLY THE
STUPID SUPPRESSION OF BUDDHIST RELIGIOUS FLAGS AT HUE ON 8 MAY (ON
PRETEXT THAT THEY MIGHT BE CONSTRUED AS CONNECTED TO VC COMMEMORATION

WHEN CENTRAL VIETNAM AUTHORITIES “ORDERED POLICE

TO EXECUTE THE DIRECTIVE BANNING FLAGS, INITIALY THE POLICE MERELY

RESTATED THE ORDER BUT WOULD NOT RIP DOWN ANY BUDDHIST FLAGS.

FINALLY SEVERAL CATHOLIC POLICE DID $0, BUT SOME BUDDHIST POLICE-
MEN REFUSED, SAYING THAT BUDDHIST FLAGS SHOULD BE PERMITTED JUST

AS CATHOLIC FLAGS ARE FLOWN ON SAINTS DAYS. SUCH DEFIANCE OF ‘ORDERS '
AT HUE 1S QUITE RARE

J. “THE CROWNING INSULT TO BUDDHISTS WHICH WILL FURTHER ENFLAME THEM
AND ALSO REVIVE THE OUTCRY AGAINST NGO FAMILY RULE WAS
THE NEWS OF HUE ARCHBISHOP NGO DINH THUC'S PLAN THAT THE PRESIDENT

ASK BUDDHIST ASSOCIATIONS ELSEWHERE IN VIETNAM TO CONDEMN THE
CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE: AND DISORDER OF THE HUE BUDDHISTS. ARCHBISHOP
THUC REPORTEDLY WENT TO-SAIGON TO DEMAND THIS. THE VC COULD’ NOT
HAVE A BETTER PROPAGANDA WEAPON IF THEY-HAD LAUNCHED THE IN-
CIDENT AND DIRECTED .THUC'S REACTION. THEMSELVES.

8. BY SUCH ACTS THE REGIME 1S DESTROYING CONFIDENCE AND LOYAL
MOTIVATION OF PUBLIC SERVANTS, INTELLECTUALS, PARTY SUPPORTERS, AND
THE MASS OF NON-CATHOLIC PEASANTRY IN ITS MOST CRUCIAL TIME.

IF THIS CONTINUES ONLY SYCOPHANTS AND XENOPHOBES WILL
