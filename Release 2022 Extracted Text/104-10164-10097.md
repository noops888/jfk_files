n the name cf Carlos Luis PANIAGUA Mendez. The passport was

cocaine and Xeroxed by, EMCLIPPER-1 who provided a copy to the
tation.

2. EMWISE+15 had previously reported that BOSCH entered the
Dominican Republic with a false Costa Rican passport in the name of
Pedro Antonio PENA. While BOSCH may be carrying a second. Costa,
Rican passport in the PENA name, it appears that he entered the
Dominican Republic with the PANIAGUA passport. The PANIAGUA
passport forwarded herewith shows the following:

A. The Department of Migration of Costa Rica issued a
visa on 24 March 1976 for travel to "C.A., Republica
Dominicana" (p.13).

B. BOSCH departed Costa Rica at Pena Blancas on 26 March
(p. 11) and entered Nicaragua (p. 9). é

D. It appears that BOSCH entered Guatemala City by

E. BOSCH arrived in Santo Domingo at Las Americas : i
airport on 31 March (p. 15). aM

3. BOSCH told EMCLIPPER-1 that the real PANIAGUA had undertaken
most of the travel shown in the passport, but EMCLIPPER-1 did not
establish the date the passport was acquired by BOSCH or how.

4. As reported Ref A, BOSCH was deported to Costa Rica via
Managua on 29 August on Iberia Flight 979. EMWISE-15 reported that.
the PANIAGUA passport was used to deport BOSCH. .
