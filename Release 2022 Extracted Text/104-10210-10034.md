VI. Production

A. Pesitive Intetligence Information
SEES enter nngcnce splornernon

NOSENKO's positive intelligence production has been
meager, and vothing=he reported nerited dissemination a3 an
intelligence report. According to his biography, NOSENKO's
entire adult life until defecting ad been spent either as
a student or as an intelligence officer, and in explanation
- of bis lack of positive intelligence information, he has

stressed that since the early 1950's he had few outside si ;
interests and "no real contacts" outside the KGB itself.* :
NOSENKO'sS assignments to the Soviet delegations to the
Disarmament Conference in 1962 and 1954 were, he hes said,
for cover purposes only. and he aeither had any connections
with officials or organizations in the USSR concerned with
arms control or disarmament policies nor did he take any
part in the substantive work of the delegations.

During the period 18 to 23 Februavy 1964, a wide range
of questions covering various aspects of nuclear weapons,
missiles, electronics, communications, unconventional wea~
pons, military industry, military units and equipment, and
research and development were put to NOSENKO in order to
evaluate his knowledgeability. He had no direct knowledge
of any of these topics, although he was able to identify in
general a few of the KGB organizations which protect sensi~
tive installations such as suclear weapons production and
storage sites. NOSENKO was given a set of requirements
from the Defense Intelligence Agency on 24 February 1964.
These questions were premised on his two TDY tours to the
Disarmament Conferences in Geneva; they dealt with such
matters ag Soviet underground testing, Soviet efforts and
progress in the fields of chemical and biclogical warfare,
Soviet aims and purposes at ‘the disarmament talks, and
Soviet views of the corresponding attitudes and intentions
of the United States. NOSENKO stated he had yo information
on any of these questions but expressed his personal opinion : i
on a. few of them, in general terms. NOSENKO's answers to 5
other questions of a positive intelligence nature--those é
i concerning the viability of the current Soviet leadership.
plans for a new Soviet constitution, anti-Seaitism as

_— governmental policy, personality data on Soviet leaders,
and other political and social matters--were couche:
and general terms and were not based on concrete knowledge.

*At the start of his first meeting- with CIA on 9 June 1962,
7 . however, when explaining how he knew of the real state of
' affzirs inside the USSR (as opposed to that presented by
: Soviet propaganda), NOSENKO said: "I circulate among i
ministers, with the friends of my father, and I hear 7
“what they say.”

Cc. KGB Headquarters

1. Structure and Functions.

Prior to NOSENKO's con t with CIA in June 1962, tho
most recent information on KGB structure and functions had:~
been provided by GOLITSYN, whose information was current as
of December 1961 when he defected. GOLITSYN's data and that
from the Polish defector GOLENIEWSKI wero the first detailed -
new information on this subject available to the U.S. intel-
ligence comnunity since 1954, when DERYABIN, RASTVOROV,
PETROV, and KHOKHLOV defected, just prior to the change-over
from the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) to the Committee
for State Security (KGB). GOLENIEWSKI and GOLITSYN had re-
ported on the 1959 reorganization of the KGB, the first major
realignment o? the KGB's functions since the abolition of
the Committee for Information in 1951, It encompassed the
absorption into the Second Chief Directorate of the duties of
the former Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Directorates. which had
been responsible for political, econonic-industrial, and
transportation security, respectively, It also included the
upgrading of the Illegals Department to the status of a
Special Directorate within the First Chief Directorate, the
consolidation of countcrintelligence operations abroud into
one new department, the Fourteenth, and creation of a new
department--Department "D" (Disinformation) ~-ta coordinate
and intensify the KGB's activities in the area of deception
and misinformation. The lattcr, although placed in the First
Chief Directorate, was established to serve the needs of the
entire KGB.

NOSENKO's 1964 information on the organization and func-
tions of the KGB indicated refinements of responsibilities
in the Second Chief Directorate in accordance with the 1959
absorption of the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Directorates.
The formation of the so-called "Service" (Sluzhba) as a
component of the Second Chief Directorate Tentralized those
political security functions (formerly handled by the Fourth
Directorate) which were uprelated to foreigners in the USSR;
the creation of an element entitled "the Directorate" (Uprev-
leniye) accomplished the same thing for industrial-aconomIc—
Functions formerly managed by the Fifth and Sixth Directorates.
As for the First Chief Directorate, NOSENKO reported the up-
grading of the Scientific and Technical Départment to direc-
torate status, and the expansion of the Information and
Counterintelligence Departments to UService: Number’:1" and "Ser-
vice Number 2," respectively; according to NOSENKO, the
latter organizational designation permits an increase in
personnel without a corresponding rise in the bureaucratic
level of the component.

The accompanying charts offer a comparison of the or-
Ganization of the KGB in 1961, as known from GOLITSYN (and
supported by GOLENIEWSKI), and in 1964, ‘as given by NOSENKO.
Comments on particular weaknesses in NOSENKO's information
on the KGB organization since its formation in 1954 will be
found in Part VII.B.1., Statements of DERYABIN.

2. Modus Operandi

Less meagurzble or precise in comparison with KGB
structure and functions are the sperational methods and
Headquarters procedures of ‘the KGS. . NOSENKO himself has not
been as productive in revealing Tourist Department methods
as was the document which he provided on this subject in
1964. He has not been able to provide a systematic, detailed,
or documented review of the metheds of the other Second Chief
Dircetora.e component to which hy was assigned, the U.S.
Embassy Sectior, nor of the nethods of the Suryc.llance
Directorate with witich ne worked closely. NOSENKO neverthe-
less has furnished insights into the U.S. Embassy Section
and Surveillance Directorate methods in the course of dis-
cussing specific operatwns.

NOSENKO brought to the Geneva meetings in 1964 a draft
of a report te the Collegium of the KGB dated Marth 1963 on
the work of the Tourist Departmert of the Second Chief Direce
torate. He claimed to nave written st hinsell, and it bore
corrections in his handwriting. This draft described KCB
investigatio of and o) ations against Western tourists
suspected of being agents of foreign intelligence services,
primarily in the periud of 1961-125 It described the
functions of each component of the Tourist Department and
the number and qualifications of the operational staff,
giving figures on length of service, educational background,
forcign travel and langu2ges, and training. It went on to
Gite statistics on the number of for ign tourists visiting
the USSR, and the number of foreign ent suspects uncovered
among them througn the work of the A wid variety of
techniques used by the Tourist Departrent were mentioned,
with examples of certain successes interspersed in the
discussion. |

NOSENKO has made numerous references to the techniques
described in this report, as discussed in the many cases
reviewed in detail in tne foregoing treatment of his KGB
career. when interviewed for further information on the
Statistics which appear throughout the 1963 draft, however,
NOSENKO was unable to identify the operations referred to in
the numerics] citations, nor those included as illustrative
examples of operational techniques]

TOP SECRET

Lane CR tae . 128 9G 0) joer aetna a imino esiameai aoe RRR aR mCP NANO

The document refers also to the role of the leadership
of the Tourist Department in briefing other organs of the
KGB on work against foreign tourists. NOSENKO was questioned
on this activity but ould not recall any information contained
in such lectures or discussions, Although the docunent also
emphasized the daily.need for cuordination of the Tourist
Department activities with numerous other components of KGB i
Headquarters and with local organs of the KGB throughout the : 4
Soviet Union, NOSENKO was unable to explain how such coordina- 4
tion was effected in practice, nor could he describe require-
ments for the preparation and approval of. correspondence
pertaining to such coordination; in many instances he asserted ‘
that telepnone calls sufficed, but he said he could.not indi.~ ‘
cate who was authorized to coordinate informally in this way.

t
i

Apart from this information on Tourist Department modus
operandi, NOSENKO has. described the operational methods oF
The US. Enbassy Section of the American Department and of
the Surveillance Directorate in connection with their coordinated
activities against Embassy targets. Of particular note is
Part V.E.3.c., in discussions of operations against Embassy
code clerks. E

3. Staff Procedures

In recounting vtrious operations in which he participated
or which ne supervised, NOSENXO described operations and
events which encompassed various KGB procedures. Some of
these were: authorization tor recruitment; file checks; “
correspondence and coordination with other KGB departments, seers i
directorates, or regional units; technical support of opera-
tions; administration of safe houses; KGB files and reports; ~
and travel authorizations and accountings. He was from time t ‘
to time asked to describe such procedures systematically and
in detail. From such questioning it was not possible to
derive any detailed picture of current KGB procedures. The
little NOSENKO was able to provide did not differ from infor-
mation dated 1954, and was only a small fraction of the. isfor~
mation available from earlier sources. He had no information
on changes or developments in the interim. Examples of the
level of NOSENKO's knowledge of certain procedures may be
found in Part VI1.B.1, DERYALIN's Comments, as may instances
of inaccurate reporting of procedures. i

TOP SEGTET



D. kGB Activitics

1, Operations Against Americans

In the context cf KGB recruitment operations and ipvestigations,
NOSENKO has mentioned 111 Americans: Forty-nine of them were said
to have been recruited, 33 were under development, and seven re-_
fused to collatorate with the KGB; investigations of nearly all ”
the remaining 22 Ameritans were reportedly predicated on KGB sus-"
picion or knowledge of their affiliation with U.S. Intelligence.

Of the 49 Americans recruited, -NOSENKO attributed his knowl-
edge of nine of them to his own direct, personal involvement in
the approaches, usually as recruiting officer; these cases are
discussed at greater length in connection with NOSENKO's XGB
career (Part Vj. His knowledge of 11 other recruitments was said
to have derived from either indirect involvement or contact with
the targets of these operations; NOSENKO indicated that he be-
came aware cf these 11 persons through his duties at varicus times
in the American and Tourist Departments of the XGB Second Chief
Directorate. fecause of interest in American correspondents
during 1954 and 1955 while in the American Department, for exan-
ple, he was abie to report that five of them were KGB agents, al-
though he had taken no part in their recruitments, which had been
achieved earlier; likewise, he learned of two recruitments when
an Anerican Department officer twice visited the Tourist Depart-
ment with a request for operational assistance during 1962 and
1963, when NOSENKO was a Deputy Chief of this department.) In
four cases--al] First Chief Directorate operations--NOSENKO said
he lcarned of the recruitments unofficially from discussions with
friends and from remarks by other case officers which he over-
heard. Two of tnese four cases were considered by NOSENKO to be
among his most significant information, the penetration of the
Orly Courier Transfér Station by U.S. Army Sgt. Robert Lee JCHN-
SON and the recruitment in Moscow and later handling of coce-
machine mechanic Dayle W. SMITH; detailed information on the
JOHNSON and SMITH cases is presented after the tabulation (below)
of NOSENKO's Aaerican leads.

NOSENKO has provided no sources for his information on 25
of the 49 successful KGB recruitment operations against Aneri-
cans, although he has sometimes identified the case officers in
volved in them; most of this information was contained in hand
notes, which No:
he learned of these cases casually while Deputy Chief of the Tour-
ist Department curing 1962 and 1963; many of the recruitments were
said to have been accomplished in 1960 and 1961 at a time when
NOSENKO was serving in the American Department. He has explained

‘these notes as follows: "If I did not participate in a case, I

don't know much about it. Please understand me. ‘Since 1962 when
I first began to get ready for this act (defection], any time I
got a whiff of something which smelled like an agent, I would put
it down. I have a regular safe in my office and then I have a
hidden wall safe. There I may put my personal papers, notes. I
am’ the only one who has a key and any little notes, like those 1
mentioned, I would put in there."

sions, their relations took place
in TAYLOR's quarters, but there-
after, because TAYLOR roomed with
the code clerk Paul JENNER, Sophia
invited TAYLOR to her apartment.
TAY..OR recalled having been, intimate
with her four or five times! there.
Shortly after he began having rela-
tions with her. Sophia announced
that she was pregnant; TAYLOR cf-
fered her money for an abortion but,
he said, she refused to take the
money. In about December 1960,
Sophia invited TAYLOR to. visit her
girlfriend's apartment (she had no
roommate). TAYLOR recalled, that
this was a well~furnished apartment
with, he believed, a full length
mirror on the closet door; TAYLOR
thought the KGB could not have
acquired photographs because the
lights wore out during their rcla-
tions. Around Christmas or New |
Years 1960, TAYLOR also recalled,
there was a party in Sophia's apart-
Ment; two Soviets who did not speak
English were also present. TAYLOR
left Moscow in February 1961, He
has denied ever being approached for
any purpose by Soviet Intelligence.

(1962)

Personal involvement. NOSENKO
said he devoted almost full time
to this case for about a year.

In 1964 NOSENKO said he was pres-
ent in the hall outside the
hotel room in which STORSBERG
was approached. In 1962 NOSENKO
had said that he personally
approached STORSBERG. (1962,
without name)

GOLITSYN told of reading, some time

_in 1957, of a case against a U.S.

Embassy Security Officer, not named,
based on his love affair with his
Russian maid or cleaning woman.

By KGB instruction she told him

she was being forced to work for

the KGB and would be arrested if

she did not. He helped her by pass-
ing her false information, until

the KGB objected, after which he
passed a mixture of false and true
material, This took place between
1953.and 1957. Edward Ellis SMITH
acknowleuged to CIA his having ro-
ceived letters (as described by
NOSENKO)--in June 1956--but denied
having personal meetings with the
KGB . He did confess to the Ambassa-.
dor, but only to having been intimate
with the maid. Not until 1962, when
confronted with the details from
GOLITSYN, did he confirm .the truth
of the rest of the story as GOLITSYN
told it. At all times he deniea
accepting recruitment. See Part
VI.D.d.c. for details.

GOLITSYN reported two leads which
may relate to this operation.

First was to a military code clerk
in Moscow who had been developed

to tho point where recruitment ’
was virtually assured by: spring

of 1960. (STORSBERG was one of

two American “military code clerks”
in Moscow at the time.) Second
lead was to American at U.S. Emb-
assy who was successfully recruited
with the aid of PREISFREUND in

late 1960. (NOSENKO and PREISFREUND

there were three who, he indicated, had access tc

“SASHA, "ANDKEY" (Dayle W. SMITH), and the penetra-

(i) NOSEMKO's Information on the Agent

< the first meeting with CLA in 1944 NOSENXO announced that
he could not continue to work in place for CIA; ne was going to
defect outright, he said, rather than po back to the Soviet Union.
He was ‘told that in order to ments ror his secure -
removal from Switzerland it « sary to expand the
limited number of people in CIA who were aware of his case; in
this connection it was extre that he think hard
he knew etraticn of CIA.
His first reaction his shoulders andicating that he
had no i¢ea, but upon his case officer's sistence he thought
further about the question and finally s "Il do not know of
any in CIA, but there 1s one 1n your military intelligence. This
one worked in Germany and then retur to America in 1955, and
then after i955 he worked in Geruany." He explained that he had
first learned of this case from M.A. SHALYAPIN, who had been the
case officer for this operation in Gerni This agent, whose
Mame NOSENKO did not know, was still in Cermany as of the time x
SHALYAPIN left Berlin in about 1957.* SHALYAPIN told him that this i
agent's KGB cryptonym was “SASHA,” and that he had recruited ‘
“SASHA” himself in Germany, on a purely financial dasas. Asked
if "SASHA" wore a uniform while meeting his KGR handler, NOSENKO -
said he appeared in civilian clothes. He knew "SASHA" was of offi-
cer status, but whether he was in civiiian or military intelligence 7
he could not say; he thought, however, the agent was working ;
against military targets NOSENKO added that "SASHA" returned to
the United States in the 1960's, then specified i962, and returned
to Germany again after that.

In February 1964, talking about another matter, NOSENKO
said he had remembered something that might help to identify
"SASHA." He had heard that the KGB had not -had luck’ in getting *
intelligence from high places in the U.S. Government during the
Cuban missile crisis in late 1962.** SHALYAPIN had

*On the basis of the collateral evidence on KGB officers in
Germany named by NOSENKO im connection with SHALYAPIN (see
betow), it has been established that--despite NOSENKO's

dates of 1955 to 195 SASHA" would have been in Germany and
recruited some time between early 1957. and late 1959, when 4

- ment to Cuba:

At some later date LYAPIN vias Deputy Resident and then Resi-

did not know definitely the period of this tour but believed it
was from 1955 to 195 he did know that V.V¥. ERIVOQSHEY was in
Germany for a short time after SHALYAP arrived, * N.S. SKVORT-
SOV was also there fer a short while, because SHALYAPIN took
over SKVORTSOV's cases befcre the latter left to return to
Moscow. . Although NOSE. unvariably has given 1955-1957 as
SHALYAPIN's dates for his Germany gnment, he has also said
that SHALYAPIN left Germany because he had to go to Cuba, and
that he went to Cuba some time in 1959. He was recalled from
Cuba around January 1962 because he had been rude to the Cubans,
quarrelled with the Chief of Cuban Intelligence, and was drink-
ing heavily. NOSENKO said that he met SHALYAPIN for the first

*On the basis of this item from NOSENKO, SHALYAPIN was iden-

Hl When SHALYAPIN came back from Cuba, he was to be a case

+: Directorate, under S.N. ANTON wv. SHALYAPIN, a full colorel at

_. this time, resented this assignment, and there vas also consider—
able animosity between himself and ANIONOY. whose work in America
hed been criticized by SHALYAPIN, the desk officer for ANIONOV at
that tine. Thus SHALYAPIN decided to retire, asd he applied to
the Medical Commission of the KCB for dizability retirement on
the basis of ailments ne had contracted because of his work. (On é
one occasion NOSENKO claimed that a fraend of a friend of his was
or this commission, and NOSEYKO uscd his influence with him to i
help SHALYAPIN get his medical reliremert.) He retired on full
pension, and NOSESKO then helpsd ham to get a joo with Inturist.
When SKYORISOV and ANTONOV ncard of this. they tried to inter~
cede with V.D, CHELNOKC®, Chi-f of the iourist Department, Second
Chief Directorate, to prevent him from getting the job, because
they both wanted to revenge themselves on SHALYAPIN for his
having exposed both of them in the past @ poor work. NOSENKO, 7
however, personally told CHELSOKO¥ of ike truc background of 7
their efforts and pointed out to him how good a case officer
SHALYAPIN was. NOSENKO got LYAPIN’5 file from the Tourist
Departuent officer who ordercd it in conection with the Inturist
job and brought it to CHELNOKOV. As a result of tis interven~
tion by NOSENKO, SHALYAPIN got the Inturist job. These actions 5
on NOSEXKO's part made him a close friend of SHALYAPIN.

ce ew ae

Because of this SHALYAPIN felt free to talk to NOSENKO,
and over drinks he expressed his particuiar bitterness at the way
the First Chief Directorate had treated nim. since without him .
it wovid not have had an agent Like “SASHA in Germany at that
time (1963). On a couple of otner wh occasion SHALYAPIN:
told NOSENKO some of the details about "SASHA."

The above story is what NOSENKO most often cited as the back-
ground for his having happened to learn about "SASHA." Under in~
tensive questioning, however. on cxactly when and how he first
learned of the "SASHA" case, NOSENKO backed off of his original
attribution to SHALYAPIN; he said he did not remember when or from t
wnom he had first picked this up, but that it could have been
from GUK, or LOPUKHOV, maybe SHALYAPIN or others. He added, hov-
ever, that.he was sure that SHALYAPIN had talked to him about the

case at some time.** -

i
:

*GUK was in the United States from. August 1954 to September
1956. He had transferred from tne Second Chief Directorate
to the American Department of the First Chief Directorate in
January 1952, according to GOLITSYN. Trus if he ard SHALYAPIN
served there together, it was either during the latter's home
leave in May-October 1953, or in late 1956, before SHALYAPIN

H
went to Germany. : |

At this time NOSENKO nad already met CIA representatives in
Geneva and had agreed to collect information for them.



NOSENKO has indicated that others to vnom the ‘SASHA case
was known were GUK, because ho worked an th i Department
when he returned from Switzerland in 1962: KRIVOSHEY, because he
was a good friend of SHALYAPL LOPLKHOV, «ho was with NOSENKO

because ne too ‘is sly" and "knows every-
thing that is going on wherever he is"; ZAOVSTROVISEV was in Ger-

Although he had first attributed rhe story of “SASHA” in re~
lation to the Cuba sissile crisis to SHALYAPIN, in subsequent
discussions of the “SASHA” case, NOSENKO has dinicd that he learned
of it from SHALYAPIN. He could not recall from #hom he did hear
this, "perhaps from (Yu.I.} GUK, from (Yu.4.) LOP{KHOV, or from
(V.M.) KOVSHUK. :

Question: When did he leave Moscow?

NOSENKO: He left in 1950, It seems sc, yes. He said that he
z would not work in the USA.

NOSENKO went on to say that “ANDREY" was the cryptonym
assigned to the agent by the Second Chief Directorate at the time
of Ais recruitment. Although NOSENKO was not sure of the dates,
the was certain that this man, a U.S. Army Sergeant, had been
spotted for the KGB by Roy RHODES, whose KGB cryptonym was
"QUEBEC", RHODES was stili an Moscow when “AND!
cruited; he had told the KGB about many other U.S, Embassy
employees, including military personnel, and the name “ANDREY"
would mean nothing to RHODES because he did not know that the
KGB had recruited this man.*

The mechanic worked satisfactorily in Moscow for the KGB,
providing materiais and infcrmation on ciphers. “ANDREY" pro-
mised he would cooperate with the Soviets in future assignments
abroad, but would not work with them in the United States as he
did not want to "sit in the electric chair." He was paid well
for his cooperation in Moscow, and the Soviets wanted to pay
him more but he refused to accept it because he said he couid
not plausibly explain the possession of too much money. When
the KGB offered him diamondsand other gems for later sale, he
did not take them, telling his case officers that possession
of a large diamond of more than a carat in the United States
could arouse the attention of the police. In 1950 the agent
left Moscow for the United States, and the KGB waited for him
to reappear in some other country, but he did not. Finally in
1955 the KGB sent an officer, who had participated in the re-
cruitment of the agent in Moscow, to the United States for the
purpose of finding "ANDREY" and the officer had no other

case; records were checked for the dates of RHODES' assign-
ment in Moscow, which were April 1951 to July 1953. Accord-
ing to RHODES, the date of his own recruitment by the KGB
was January 1952. When these dates were cited to NOSENKO
on two separate occasions during the 1962 meetings he
changed the original date for the recruitment from 1949
or 1950 to 195z or 1953, In 1962, as well as in 1964,
he said he was certain that the recruitment had already
taken place prior to his (NOSENKO's) entrance on duty with
the KGB, In 1962 he gave this date as « Marck. 1953, In
1964 and since he has given a variety of dates for this,
ranging from the beginning of 1952 to April 1953. (See

taken place alwys in cars: Kk’ lese his surveillance

wait by the highway; the Anerican would drive by and stop hi:
car; KOVSHUK would sit dow: with him in the car, receive the
materials, and give him the money; ther KOVSHUK would get out,
and the American.would drive on.

Accoréing to NOSENKO, the person who compromised Rudolf
Ivanovich ABEL (Reino HAYHANEN, who defected to CIA’in Paris in
May 1957) also gave away information on Roy RHODES, who had been
in Moscow as a garage superintendent, ‘When RHODES was under
investigation, ‘ANDREY" was Jled as a witness because he had
worked With RHCDES in Moscow. "AWREY" was the only person called
as a Witness, ard he was called upon several times to tell how
RHODES had behaved in Moscow. The agent, NOSENKO stated, could
be identifaeé by the fact that he was the only person who testi-
fied at the trial. He suffered during this investigation period
and stopped meeting the Soviets. He was afraid he would be ex-
posed and arrested too, as a result of RHODES' arrest, NOSENKO
sgested that “ANDREY" may have had sore suspicion of RHODES'
involvement in his own recruitment; or he may merely have been
panicky because he knew he could be accused of the same thing
as RHCDES. Little by little, however, "“ANDREY" resumed his
meetings with the Soviets, having little other choice.

KOVSHUK turned “ANDREY" over to a member of the Washington
Lecai Residency and returned to Moscow, NOSENKO d:d not know

. When the "ANOREY" case was discussed with NOSENKO in
Geneva in 1964 and in additional discvssions after his defec-
tion, he altered several details of the 1962 story and supplied
some new detaits about the recruitment, various officers know-
ledgeable of the case, and information provided by "ANDREY."
Only where the 1964 information differs from that of 1962 or
adés to it is 1t included below.

The recruitment of "ANDREY" took place in 1948 or 1949
according to one interview, in 1952 or earlier by another, and
in 1953 according to a third discussion of the case with NOS-
ENKO, The association in NOSENKO's mind between "“ANDREY' and
Roy RHODES remained firm, but he could not be certain whether
“ANDREY" was still in Moscow in 1953 or that he heard nothing
about the agent in 1954.

“ANDREY" used to play cards, NOSENKO reported, and may
have played poxer for high stakes. He also said that "ANDREY"
had worked at the Pentagon - in codes - but by the time that
KOVSHUK got in touch with him he was nearing the end of his

I'm absolutely sure it is, It's absolutely correct. The fact

that they called him - they summoned him to be interrogated during

the investigation - this 1s absolutely correct..." eter he ‘i
said: "As I tole you, take all those who were called up for the -
pre-trial investigation of RHODES, not who were at the trial but i
at the pre-trial ard among those people must be 'ANDREY'..." i
Questioned further on whether “ANDREY" had testified at the trial
of Roy RHODES, NOSENKO repeated: "No, he did not testify at the
trial, and at the pre-trial investigaticn he was only called up
once for questioning because he had worked with RHODES at one
time."

NOSENKO“was told CIA that "ANDREY" had not yet been iden- 4

Describing “ANDREY's" production in Moscow, NOSENKO stated

that he explained to the KGB how the code machines in the U.S. i
Embassy worked ard on one occasion NOSENKO expressed the opinion ’
that 'ANDREY" may have given the KGB parts of code machines sucn
as "discs" (sic, meaning rotors). In this connection, NOSENKO
recalled that one Aleksandr SELEZNEV, a deputy department chief 7
in the Communications Directorate of the KGB, had pneen involved :
in the “ANDREY' case: NCSENKO sa:d he first saw him in 1953 f
during the period that "ANDREY" was working for the KGB in Mos-
cow, SELEZNEV came to meetings in the first Department, Second
Chief Directorate, held to discuss and-plan the "ANDREY" opera-
tional meetings. The reason for SELEZNEV's presence was that
the case officers were not technical specialists. and SELEZNEV
would supply them with the questions to be asked of "ANDREY."
Since SELEZNEV ceme to these meetings in civilian clothes,
whereas NOSENKO normally saw him in uniform in his visits to
the First Department in 1960 and 1961, NOSENKO speculated that
SELEZ@EV may have gone in person to some of the meetings with
"ANDRE! NOSENKO was asked if SELEZNEV had instructed the case
officers working with “ANDREY" to ask him for discs from inside
the code machines, but NOSENKO replied that he did not know,
Although he did not know how the KGB exploited him, NOSENKO
repeatedly emphasized "ANDREY's" great importance to the KGB
during the time he worked for them in Moscow, "Thanks to his

- help they were able to read your State Department codes. To

i date we have never been abie to read your military codes..."*

Ef NOSENKO was asked if “ANDREY" had broucht military code material
to the KGB, and he replied: “No, I believe it was only State
Department material, What he did mainly was to describe the
operation of code machines and what daily cr other periodic
settings were made..."

According to NOSENKO, “ANDREY" supplied valuable material

was able to furnish good materiel, not only orally but also in
the form of documents, papers, and written material. This was
true for the period KOVSHUK was handling him and also for the
BAGRICHEV phase of the operation, NOSENKO was queried as to
whether during the period between June 1962 and January 1964 he
hed heard about "ANDREY" continuing to supply good information.
He answered: "No, something is going wrong there with this
operation."

Tne lead to the penetration of a sensitive U.S. military
installation in the Paris area during 1962 and 1963 was the first
piece of information NOSENKO gave CIA after reestaclishing con-
tact in Geneva in January 1964. NOSENKO characterized this lead "q

NOSENKO was unawate of any other services this
agent may have earlier performed for the KGS and estimated that
he had been recruited in 1962.

j

NOSENKO's lead eventually led ification of

3S "Army Sergeant Robert Lee JCHNSON, JOHNSON ‘s wife Hedwig,
and James Allen MINTKENBAUGH, a friend, as KGB agents. All
three had been recruited in Berlin in 1953 and had worked
closely together since. Althouch Mrs. JOHNSON's direct par-
ticipation (she servee as a courier) ended with JOHNSON's
transfer from Berlin in 1954 and despite KGB efforts to com-
partment the activities of JOHNSON and MINTKENBAUGH after 1959,
all three were aware of the others' clandestine work. NOSENKO's
lead to JOHNSON therefore compromised the other two.

While investigations of the NOSENKO lead were proceeding
in the early autumn of 1964, JOHNSON deserted his duty assign-
ment at the Washington Area Courier Station in the Pentagon
and disappeared until the end of November, when he voluntarily
turned himself in to Air Force Police officials in Las Vegas,
Nevada. JCHNSCN had arrived at his Pentagon assignment in May
1964: for the previous nine months he had been serving as non-
commissioned officer in charge of the classified documents
contro] section of the Seine Area Command Headquarters in
Camp Des Loges, France: for two years before this, until Aug-
ust 1963, ne had been assigned to the U.S. Armed Forces Cour-
jer Transfer Station at Orly Field in Paris. During the
latter assignment JOHNSON had regularly stood weekend security
watches in the Station's vault area, and it was to this pericd
of time that NOSENKO's lead pertained. 7

In confessing to Anerican authorities in January 1965,
JOHNSON admitted having penetrated the Orly vault for the
Soviets about seven times during December 1962 and the first
five months of 1963. Although there were certain differences
in timing and detail, JOHNSON's confession closely matched |
the complete description of this operation earlier given by
NOSENKO, Except to implicate himself and other participants,
JOHNSON added few essential details that were not already

known. JOHNSON's Icss of access to the Orly vazlt in August
1963 coinciréed closely with the date when MINTXENBAUGH lost
cortact with the KGB, probably in September of that year.

NOSENKO has described the Paris operation as being entirely
a Pirst Chief Directorate case. He first learred of it in 1952,
shortly after returning from his meetings with CIA in Geneva, in
casual conversations with one ur more Second Chief Directorate
technicians who had been sent TDY to Paris to assist the local
Legal Residency. NOSENKO was not sure which technician told him
about the case, or under what circumstences. Additional infor-
mation was similarly obtained “in bits end pieces" from one or i
the other of the technicians: over the next year and a half, and 3
NOSENKC had most recently discussed the case with the TOY "flaps .
and seals" expert in Paris while he (NOSENKO) wes enroute to
Geneva in mid-Januery 1964. NOSENKO explained that, although as 7
a@ Second Chief Directorate officer fe had no rightiul access to H
information on this operation, he hed worked with the special i
technicians in operations eqainst tourists and other foreigners 7
in Moscow and was on good terms with them. In such circumstences, :
NOSENKO said, it frequently happens tnat KGB cfficers will tell
other KGE officers "some details of operations on which they are
working."

The following discussion of the details of tne operation
commences with a review of NOSENKO's sti on the case and
the way in which he learned about it. Y néer of the dis-
cussion covers events leading up to the confessions by the
JOHNSON couple and MINTKENBAUGH; the substance of their admis-
sions, including the security problems posed by Mrs. JOHNSON's
mental condition and the Soviet concern tor her illness; and
the assessmenc of the damage to U.S. interests caused by the ;
activities of J:.HNSON. :

(ii) The Lead from NOSENKO

i

The agert was described by NOSENKO as being. a U.S. mili-
tary man, probably not an officer, who served nightime guard
duty with others at an American military installecion in
France where an airfield was located and where top secret
documents were held in a vault which he had helped the KGB : i
to penetrate. He was scheduled to leave France in May 1964. i
Through him the KGB acquired documents on U.S. strategic bomb-
ing targets in the USSR and France; “almost all" of these
materials were of interest to the Soviet Ministry of Defense,

NOSENKO said. From early 1962 until the agent was promoted,
the KGB Legal Residency in Paris effected six entries into i
the room with the assistance of technicians from the Special
Section, KGB Second Chief Directorate’ whom NOSENKO named.
" After the agent lost his access, Fedor FOFANOV** was sent to .

* The Special Section, according to NOSENKO, handled surrep-
titious entries into Western embassies in Moscow.

**FOFANOV was assigned from June or July 1963 to February 1964
to the Soviet Embassy in Paris as an employee, and he is
pelieved to have replaced a suspect KGB officer in this
overt position; he abruptly left Paris immediately after
NOSENKO's defection. NOSENKO indicated that FOFANOV was one

ve of several technicians transferred from the KGB Operational-

. Technical Directorate to forin the Special Group cf the KCB

Second Chief Directorate. NOSENKO proposed that he himself

Paris “in case he will get access acain some time, even just a
quick possibility." NOSENKO's statements concerning this lead

are given in chronological order below. i

NOSENKO said at the 23 January 1964 meeting* thst: he first
learned of the successful agent penetration of tie classified
documents vault at an “important American military organization”
in the Paris area shortly after returning from Geneva in: June
1962. NOSENKO did not know the designation or precise nature of
the instaliation involved in this operation, but because the
documents included information on strategic targets in France as
weli as in the Soviet Union, he assumed that it was a “strategic
planning installation." He also knew that the instsllation had
its own airfield and that there were “procedures for bringing top
secret documents in and for teking them out."

There had ceen six successful entries of the vault, four
in 1962 and two in 1963. On each occasion Special Section tech-

_ nigians had travelled TDY to Faris under courier cover to assist

the local KGB case officer in the technical details of the opera-
tion, Their function was to advise the case officer concerning

‘the entry and later to process the documents. The case officer,

on this basis, would give appropriate instructions to his agent,
and it seemed probable to NOSENKO that the technicians had never
met the American.

Entry into the vault erea was first achieved after the
agent had used some radioactive substance to determine the com-
bination, (NOSENKO thought that the agent had also photographed
the lock for KGB study.) Subsequent etries were always made
between two and five o'clock in the morning. The agent removed
documents from the vault and delivered them to his case officer,
who in turn passed them to the Special Section technicians. The
envelopes were then opened, photographs were made, the documents _
were repackaged, and the envelopes were given back to the agent —
by the case officer for return to the vault. Thereafter, the
Paris Legal Residency pouched the films to Moscow, and the
technicians themselves left Paris until the next opportunity
for éntry.

The last time the vault had been entered was in the fall
of 1963. At about that time the agent, a military man, received
‘@ promotion end was relieved of his night watch duties. (The
agent was scheduled for rotation to the United States but, with
his promotion, had obtained an extension until May 1964.) Al-
though the agent was still active in January 1964 and was still
assigned to his military post, he therefore had lost access to
the documentary information. NOSENKO characterized this in-
formation as highly sensitive and valuable to the KGB, adding
that the Chief of the Paris Legal Residency as well as several
case officers there had been rewarded for their part in the
operation.

* Because of technical difficulties in recording the first
part of this meeting with NOSENKO. it is not possible to
give a verbatim account of his initial statement on this
case. What NOSENKO said at this time has been pieced to-
gether from remarks he made later in the meeting, from
recorded recapitulations of his statements by his case
officer later during the meeting and from notes taken at
the meeting.

Finally, at the 23 January 1964 Ci reed
that three of the Special Section technicians whe had travelled
to Paris to participate in the operation were S.A. IONOV, L.A.
LEBEDEV, and S.D. ILYIN: he said he could probably identify more
if shown pictures of diplomatic couriers who ha@ travelled to : 7
Paris. NOSENKO d:d not know the identity of the Paris-based
case officer. With the exception of those concerning strategic
bembing targets, NOSENKO had no information on the nature of the
documents which had seen obtained. He explained that he had
never seen ary of these documents, that the technicians who had
seen them did not reed English, and that they had learned about
the cargetting data only casually, from asking the case officer
rat's thi ruff?" at the time they were taking photographs.

Asked on 1 February 1964 whether CIA could do anything with 4
its information concerning the travels of LESEDEV which might 3
help to identify the EGR agent of the Paria Legal Resadency,

NOSENKC replied: "Of course you can, Fer instance, f1nd out

when inose ccuriers were in Paris, what were the dates of their

stay there, keeping in mind that this will be cne and the same

LEBEDEV, (V.V.) SINITSYN, that Venyamin KARETNIKCV*., Not

FOPANOV ~ he came in the fall and did not get involved.** Then

WS SISTTISYN and K?ZETAKOV, whose first name and patronymic have
also Leen given by NOSENKO as Venedikt Vesilyevich were also
in tne Special Section, according to NOSENKO,

**NOSENKO gave CIA a similar clue concerning travel by the spe-
cial technicians on 12 June 1962: "The Chief of the Special
Section ergey IUCNOV. an excellent man. He is on @ mission
to Paris. (Note: CIA has been unable to equate any Soviet in
Paris at this time with IONOV, There is no record that ICNOV
has been abroad under that name since December 1955. He made
several trips to Paris and Brussels during the 1953-1955 pe-
riod.) ...In the Second Chief Directorate there are good spe-
cialists, with experience. These lads sometimes go to Aus- I
tralia, to France, immediately when something is needed. At « |
once. This means that there 1s something (going on) where H
they are sent... In this Section there are two or three spe-
cialists wno can open any package and then seal it back up as
it was, But th sre only two or three of these altogetrer, {

Therefore. wnen there is something somewhere abroad, there is A

an immediate request to send these guys. One went to Australia
one or two years ago. This meens that there was something
there. One went to France. Then this IONOV received the
Boyevoye K. Zaamya for this. Every time (they travel)
“they use a different last name. every time a different one...
There are three men there that can open anything and then make
it look as if nothing had been cone... I know them. But. they
' never come out in their own last names. Each time they have
a different one. There were (M.I.) PREOBRAZHENSKIY, (V.2.)
KARETNIKOV, and LEBEDEV." In speaking of IONOV's assignment
to Paris and the travel of KGB "flaps and seals" specialists
to France, NOSENKO apparently was not referring to the JOHN-
SON case; NOSENKO said he first heard about the case after
returning from Geneva in 1962; and JOHNSON stated firmly that
the first entries of the Orly Courier Transfer Station. did
not begin untii late 1962, about six months after NOSENKO
made this statement. In 1964 NOSENKO named both LEBEDEV and

KARETNIKOV as having a part in the Orly penetration. Contrary
to his statement, however, both travelled under true name
on their tenporary assignments. CIA had no traces on

NOSENKO said on 6 April 1964 that before leaving Moscow.
for Geneva in January 1964, he had been told that the Paris
Legal Residency agent had lost his access and that POFAIOV was
sent to Paris in the nope that the agent would again be able
to get into the vault cefore his transfer to the United States.*
When NOSENXO arrived at the Soviet Embassy in Paris on 19 Janu-
ary 1964 while en route to Geneva, FOFANOV "was on duty at the
entrance to the Embassy. He was the duty man, and of course
when he saw me, he sa:i ‘George, Ueorgel’ So we chatted and
he said he was not doing good, but he would probably ke sitting
there until May... So I asked him how this case was (going),
was he Going any gocd, and he said that, for the present, he
was not doing anything good but he had hopes that something
might happen. ‘That's all.”

Also on 6 April 1964 NOSENKO stated that the penetration
operation was “strictly a First Chief Directorate case." He
then went on to Gescribe the role of the Second Chief Direc-
torate's technical specialists in gaining entry to the vault |
and in photographing the documents: “The specialists were not
the ones that carried out the operation, It was carried out
by the case officers of the Residency. The specialists worked

then he can tell them and FOFANOY will be there to handle it

“Taking :into consideration that I heard that almost all
of the material they got was of interest to the Ministry of

lation. It was a military installation. It was definitely an
installacion:and. not just a single person with access to these
secret documents, I know the operations were carried out only
at night. The whole operation was completed while the agent
was on duty. The agent couldn't bring cut 2 great deal of
material; only:what he could hide on his person. From what
the boys were ‘saying, I would think that he was not alone on

going out for’ coffee or a sandwich; he is gone only 5 or 10
minutes..'| I’ think he was still in the same installation even
though he lost immediate access to the room after his promotion.
This is why FOFANOY was sent in mid-'63. FOFANOV said when'I
saw him on 18 January 1964 (NOSENKO means 19 Januery) that the
agent is supposed to stay in Paris until May 1964. He said
that the agent "is supposed to leave in May and then he (FOFANOV)
will be finished there.

without NOSENKO answering the next question, about what the
Special Section officers had Gone in this operation. NOSENKO
volunteered no additional information concerning his sources
for the lead. and he was not questioned further on the matter
during this. the first of the 1964 meetings. The transcript
of this meeting suggests. however, that NOSENKO got his infor-
mation from one of the technicians who not only travelled to

Paris to instruct the Legal Residency case officer en t' technical
aspects of the entry but also was involved in photographing the
gocuments provided ny the egent. 7

O told CIA on 2@ January 1954 that he het learned

of this operation, shortly after returning to Hoscow from Geneva
in 1962,. from a friend in the KG¥, one of several technicians who
participated in the cperation. NOSENKO thought the source of this
information was either LEEEDEV or FOFANOV.

During intensive debriefing on 6 April 1964 NOSENKO stated:
"YT £iest heard about this from KARETNIXIV." After describing the
functions of the Special Section in Moscow, he went on to say that
KARETNIZ“OY came frequently to the Tourist Department to see him.
The reason for their association was that NOSENKO then supervised
work with the Moscow hotels designateé for use by foreign tourists,
while the Special Section set up equipment in verious rooms cf
these hotels. The debriefing concinted:

NOSENKO: Why do they come to see me? First of all, they know
me quite well ard, seconély, simply because I super-
vise this (American Tourists) section. IOXOV would
come...to chat among other things. KAREINIKOV told
me about this, in Paris,

Question: What did KARETNIKOV say when you first heard about
this?

NOSENKO: That they had carried out operations several times in
Paris, that two had alseady been there for this pur-
pose, that they went there as diplomatic couriers to
Paris... (NOSENKO at this point repeated KARETNIXOV's
description of the role of the Special Section tech-
nicians in advising the Paris-based KGB case officer
and the methods which were used to gain initial access
to the vault.)

NOSENKO: KARETNIKOV was the first and then LEBEDEV. LEBEDEV
was later.

Question: These were the only two people, you say?

NOSENKO: Only two, only two.

Question: But you told me before that FOFANOV told you about
it too.

NOSENKO: FOFANOV, FOFANOV. I knew that FOFANOV is here in

Paris. He was on duty at the entrance to the Em-
bassy... (Here NOSENKO told of his conversation with
FOFANOV about the case. NOSENKO then explained that
he had already heard from LEBEDEV that the agent had
lost his access and that FOFANOV haé been assigned
to Paris against the possibility that ne would re-
gain it.)

According to NOSENKO on 29 July 1964, he "first heard about:
this case from .fficers of the Special Section in 1962 - from
LEBEDEV or KARETNIXOV, but I can't remember which was first.
LEBEDEV or KARETNIKOV visited my office and maybe I. might say:

i

‘I haven't seen you in a long time, what hav2 you been doing?!
And he would sey: ‘Oh, I have just been to Paris on etrip.' Or
maybe I asked KARETNIKOV where LEBEDEV was because I hadn't seen
him in a long time, and he told me that LEBEDEV was away on &
trip."

When asked on 29 July 1964 which officers had ever mentioned ~

this case to him, in eny way at any time, NOSENKO replied: "KARET~
NIXOV, LEBEDEV, and IONCV in Moscow and FOFANOV in Paris in Janu-
ary 1964," He affirmed that he had never discussed the case with,
or mentioned it to, anyone else. "Yes," he continued, “I think
LEBEDEV was the first one to speak to me about this case, because
in 1962 I was Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department and was super-
vising the work of the Third Section on hotels and restaucants.*
LEBEDEV was a member of a commission which had been set up in the
KGB to flan for the operational exploitation of new hotels which
were being built or planned. He was coming to see-me about these
metters. So while I might hear just a little bit about this from
IONOV, I would hear more from LEBEDEV, because he was a gocd friend
and was ccning to my office on business."

The following is from the protocol which NOSENKO aigned on
18 February 1965:

"Z £€irst learned of the penetration of an American
installation in Paris after my return to Moscow in June 1962
and at @ time that I was a conscious and willing coliaborator
of the CIA and was attempting to gather information of inter~
est to Anericar. Intelligence. I immediately recogr.ized the
importance of this information to American Intelligence when
I first heard it.

“I learned of this case in small pieces, in several
conversations (some in my KGB office and possibly others
elsewhere) with several different officers of the KGB over
@ period of several months. These officers were KARETNIKOY,
IONOV, ard LEBEDEV, all members of the Special Technical
Section of the Second Chief Directorate.

"I do not remember from which of these three officers
I first heard of the case, which of these officers told me
what portions of the story, or when-I learned the individ-
ual details of this case which I have reported to CIA, or

the season of the year in which I learned them.

"I do not know why these officers told me of the
Paris case, except that we were in good relations. In
such circumstances it frequently heppens that KGB officers
will tell other KGB officers some details of operations on
which they are working.** I don't know whether they told
other KGB officers this information. As my relations were
equally good with each of those three officers, any of
them could have told me any part of it.

* This would place NOSENKO's earliest knowledge of the case scme-
time after July 1962, when he said he became Deputy Chief of
the Tourist Department.

**This sentence was added at NOSENKO's request prior to signing
the protocol.

After preliminary investigation of the NOSENKO lead by the
FBI, CIA, the U.S. Air Force Office of Special Investigations, and
the Department of the Army (ACSI), it wes decided in early Septem-
ber 1964 to concentrate on Army Sergeant Robert Lee JOHNSON as the
likeliest candidate for xeing the KGB acent in this operation. On
2 October 1964, however, CCHNSON disappeared from his nome in
Alexandria, Virginia, after telling his wife that he was on his
way to work. JCHNSCN, a courier with eccess to "secret" materials) +
at the Pentagon, failed to appear for duty on Monday, 5 October. b'{ 3
Army counterintelligence officers then. called at the JOHNSON home ‘
to interview his wife. Mrs. JOHNSON said that she had detected i
nothing wu: ual in her husband's behavior during the previous sev~ +
eral weéks, tt he had samply left for the office at about 2:45 fe
pem. On Fricay, the 2 had not returned. She did not know
why he had ieft or where JOHNSON might have gone. Mrs, JOHNSON
repeated this statement in two later interviews, one toward the
end of Octoler and the second in the middle of November 1964.

Soon after JCHNSCN's disappearance, representatives of ACSI i
interviewed an Arlington. Virginia, real-estate salesman, James oo f
Allen MINTKE\BAUGH. He had been identified by Mrs. JOHNSON as
her husband's closest civilian acquaintance. having known JOHNSON
from the time 12 years eerlier when they served together in the :
Army. MINTKENRAUGH had first learned of JOHNSON's disappearance
on Sunday, 4 October, wher he telephoneé the JOHNSON home and had
talked to Mrs. JOHNSON. Twice the same day and once the next
MINTKENSAUGH had telephoned the Pentagon in hopes of locating 4
JOHNSON. During the anterview. he told the ACSI representatives :
that he had no idea where JOHNSON was. The last time he had seen
JOHNSON, MINTKENEBAUGH said. was several weeks earli at which
time everything seemed normal, although JOHNSON had complained
of diffaculties raised by his wife's mental condition.*

JOHNSON failed to reappear by 9 October 1964, the Army
+: thereupon decleared him a deserter, and the F8I was brought into
. the case. The FBI reinterviewed both Mrs. JOHNSON and MINTKEN-
BAUGH on several occasions 1n search of information which might
‘lead to JOHNSON's whereabouts. On 10 November, immediately follow.
FB < INTKENBAUGH asked his roommate,
to take him to CIA Headquarter
aiscuss “a matter Of importance." During an interview that same
evening MINTKENBAUGH confessed to a CIA representative that he
had been a Soviet agent since 1952 or 1953, following his recruit-
ment by JOHNSON. He described 1n general terms his own espionage
activities during this 11 or 12 year period as well as those of
Sgt. ard Mrs. JOHNSON. No mention was made of the Orly penetration,
however. The next day, while his roommate was. out of the apart-
ment, MINTKENBAUGH packed his things and disappeared, leaving a
note saying that he would be "back in the spring."

* JOHNSON had tola a Pe: tagon co-worker shortly before he went
AWOL that, "My wife 1s driving me crazy!" Others there had
noticed that JCHNSON appeared nervous and seemed to be drinking
heavily in the Gays immediately preceding his disappearance.

is whereebouts unknown, until
25 Nove: 1964, At that time he turned himself in to a U.S. Air
Force policeman in Reno, Nevada. Hie had, he said, run out of
money. COHNSON was immediately incarcerated on the charge of
being absent without leave.

SCANSON remained at large, h:

On 1 December representatives of the FBI and ACSI visited
Mrs. JOHNSON to inform her that her husband had been found. Then,
for the first time, she launched into a long, detailed account in
which she implicated JOHNSON, MINTKEVBAUGH, and herself in espion-
age activities for the Soviets, (She tiad not confessed earlier,
she said. because of fear of what JOHNSON might de to her.) Mrs.
JCHNSON @escribed what JOHNSON nad done on behalf of the Soviets é

while stationed in Berlin during 1953 and 1954, while serving in
the United States from 1957 to 1959, and during his recent tour
in France om 1959 to August 1964, JOHNSON, she said, had told
her in 1962, when he was assigned to the Orly Field Armed Forces
Courier Station, thet he had removed documents from the vault
there cn three occasions and hed passed them to the Soviets.

A joint FBI

SI team two days later began to interrogate
JOHNSON on the basis of the informacion which had been received
from NOSENKO, Mrs. JOHNSON, and Mi% ‘BAUGH. JOHNSCN stead-
fastly maintained his innocence: He had gone AWOL, he said, only
in order to force the Army to hospitalize his mentally ill wife
and te require the Army or some other agency to find a means cf
taking care of his children. (He later iasisted thet he had had
no idea of the suspicions concerning him at the time he deserted.) !
During these interrogations, which lasted until 22 December,
JOHNSON was confronted with the allegations made by his wife and
MINTKENBAUGH. He made a point-by-point denial. Meenwhile, MINT-
KENBAUGH himself had beer located by the FOI on 5 December at
his brother's mountain cabin in California and was under inter-
rogation.

JOHNSON was courtmartialed for desertion in December 1964
and was sentenced to reduction in grade, forfeiture of pay, and
was ordered to reimburse the government for the cost cf return-
ing him to Washington. The sentence included no confinement
and, as he continued to profess his innocence, he was home for
Christmas. FBI-ACSI plans called for a resumption of question-
ing on the espicnage charges after the New Year, On 1 January
1965, however, before the new interrogations began, JCHNSON
walked in and made a voluntary confession. His reason for
doing so, ne said, was solely to help his children ard his wife,
whose mental condition was worsening. The substance of this
confession is given in the section which follows.

(v) Information from Other Sources

The confessions by the JOHNSON couple and MINTKENBAUGH
constitute the bulk of evidence on the case. They indicate
that the operation which began in 1953 reac’.ed its peak in late
1962 and early 1963 when JOHNSON peretrated the vault at Orly,
that Mrs. JOHNSON's mental condition posed a serious threat to
the security of the operation and that the KG3 recognized this
fact no later than late 1960. After August 1963 KGB interest i
in JOHNSON's access to classified information declined markedly, 7 i
and MINTKENBAUGH's contact with the KGB was severed at approxi-
mately the same time. The JOHNSONs and MINTKENBAUGH were

heed to KGB efforts at compartmentation and continued to discuss 2
their clandestine activities with each other. Their statements
are summarized below, followed by a detailed presentation of
their accounts of the operation. Mrs. JOHNSON’s revelations to
others about the agent status of her husband. ana the Soviet re-
actions to Mrs. JOHNSON's meatal illness which caused her.to
make these revelations.

An effective and reliable agent from 1953 cn, JOHNSON
arrived at Orly in May 1961, out it was rot until the fall of
1962 that he obtained the combination of the vauit. Probably in t
December JOHNSON made the first of hig seven entries. into the . rf

:

vault. Five more penetrations appear to have been made during the
period January to March 1963, and the final one occurred in May
1963. As summer approached and the deys became longer,’ JOHNSON's r
KGB case officer told him he was suspending the operation, on the , §
grounds that the sorter hours of darkness had increased the risk
beyond acceptable limits. buc the vault entries would recommence
ana intensify in the fall. In August, however, JCHNSON was trans- 3
ferred to the Seine Area Command headquarters at Camp Des Loges, i
France. and lost access to the vault. As noncommissioned officer 7
in charge of the Classified Control Center at Camp Des Loges,

JOHNSON had access to all classified documents originating with

the Headquarters conmand and with certain other commands as well;

yet the KGB never pressed him to produce these documents and,

SJTOHNS' said, seemed uninterested in the documents he offered :
to provide. when he was transferred to the United States in 1964

following NOSENKO's defection, JOHNSON received the impression ‘
from his KGB handler that he was being “dropped.” JOHNSON claims
to have had no contact with the Soviets during the six months
between his reassignment to the Pentacon and his epprehension

in December 1964.

MINTKENBAUGH first served the KGB as a spotter of American
personnel in Berlin during 1953 and 1954 and later. from 1956 to
1959, as a courier between JOHNSON and officers of the KGB Legal
Residency 1n Washington, D.C. At the time JOj SON was assigned
to Orleans, France, in late 1959, MINTKEIBAJGH was taken to
Moscow to prepare for his “most important assignment." At KGB ;
instruction, MINTKENBAUGH moved from California to Arlington., f
Virginia, in 1960. The plan was for him to establish a self-
owned business so that he could be joined by 2 female (a KGB
Illegal) who was to become his wife end operationel assistant.

“Once this was accomplished MINTKENBAUGH was to act as 2 courier,
servicing a network of KGB agents throughout the United States.
Despite repeated KGB pleadings and admonitions. he took no fur-
ther steps to establish the desired cover, and for this reason
the Soviet plan never materialized. Moreover, MINTKENBAUGH has
said, by early 1962 he was depressed and disillusiored and was
looking for 2 way to breek contact with the KGB; from this point ‘i
or somewhat earlier he claims to have performed his various KGB
assignments in a perfunctory way or not at all. Contact was
finally broken sometime in the late summer or early fall of
1963 when MINTKENBAUGH was unable to read directions for fur-
ther meetings which the KGB passed him on photographic film via
deeddrop. The KSB took no steps to reinstitute contacts, and
MINTKENBAUGH's own efforts - after apparently experiencing a
change of heart - proved unavailing.

1954 period, when she acted as a courier between JOHNSON in West

Having edmitted his espionace activities to ACSI and the
FBI, JOHNSCN gave what he said was the complete history of his
relationships with Sovict Intelligence since the carly 1950's.
The following account is based largely on ACSI réports to the
U.S. Security Board on 12 and 26 January 1965; they provide the
details of his original confession ard elaborate on his activities
curing his most recent tour in France.*

In 1952, JOHNSON wes stationed in West Berlin where he was
the acting first sergeant of a Transportation Corps company.
Desponcent because he wes passed over for promoticn and not given J
the first sergeant posicion, and believing that his application 4
to marry would te disapproved, JOHNSON decided to defect to the u
Soviets. His first attempt to defect was aborted in February : ‘
1952 when Hedwig admitted to JOHNSCN at the last minute that she "
had lied to him when she had informed him earlier that she had
cont ed th: Soviet authorities in East Berlin and arranyed for
their defection as he had requested. After the initial attempt
to defect. JOHNSON persueded Hedwig to return to Eest Germany to
contact the Soviets, wnich she did. About a week after the abort-
ed effort to defect. Hedwig and JOHNSON met with the Soviets in
East Germany. JOHNSON ormed the Soviets he was “fed up with
the American way of life" and wanted to defect to the USSR. JOHN-
SON was toid there was no hurry about his proposal to defect, a
statement with which he agreed. Another meeting was arranged
for the fcllosing week. During the period between the first
meeting end his marriage to Hedwig on 25 Aprii 1953, JOHNSON met
almost weekly with the Soviets. JOHNSON was finally told that
he would be of more use to the Soviets if he were to remain in
the American Sector. He agreed to do so and at the same time to !
perform tasks for Soviet Intelligence. JOHNSON has stated that '
he refused the money the Soviets offered for his services at i
that time, but he continued to work for Soviet Intelligence until
his transfer to Rochefort, France, in April 1954. i

During his Berlin assignment JOHNSON conducted the follow-
ing activities on behaif of Soviet Intelligence:

- He was given a Minox camera by the Soviets and
trained in its use.

- JOHNSON's first important assignment was to call
on a man named “Willie” (presux by Hedwig JOHNSON to
be Willie BRANDT, present Mayor of Berlin) ntp wear his
uniform at the time he called on “Willie, FES get "Willie"
in his jeep by telling “Willie” the Americans wanted to
speak with him. He was to drive "Willie" to the Check-
point between East and West Berlin where "Willie" would
be taken into custody by the Soviets. JOHNSON was
instructed to use eny force necessary, and he agreed
to bring "Willie" to the Checkpoint dead or alive. JOHN-
SON.went to the address in Schoenenberg, West Berlin,

- provided by the Soviets, entered the residence, but made
no further attempt to carry out his orders.

* Although the FBI subsequently debriefed JOHNSON in depth on
his entire espionage career, these two ACSI reports contain
the main substance of his story. +

“TOPS



il 1953, JOHNSON spent
week in Grandenberc, as a guest of the Soviets,
@uring which time various meetings were held, usually in
JOHNSON's room. During the weex there JOHNSCN was questioned
extensiveiy about his personal life and w2s asked routine
questions about his organization. He was given a book on

the history of Ccmmunism which he read several times, and on
one occesicn he wes questioned to such a degree on general
subjects trat JOHNSON felt he was possibly being psycho-~
analyzed. 1 JOHNSON returned to dest Berlin, Hedwig re-
mained in East Germany to act as courier between JOHNSON

end the Soviets. JOHNSON supsequently met with Hedwig on

a weekly basis.

- JOMISON was directed by the Soviets to try to. obtain
an assignment with CIC or the Military Intelligence Detach-
ment (4ID). He believes he mey have tried to get into CIC,
and he definitely applied for an assignment in MID but was
turned down.

- JOHNSON was given the assignment of furnishing the
nemes of CIC personrel in Berlin. He accomplished this by
utilizing the Berlin Post Telephone Directory, which he
also subsequently supplied to the Soviets. The Soviets were
extremely pleased with this accomplishment.

- In about May 1953, JOHNSCN was reassigned to the G-2
Section of the Berlin Command, with a secret security clear-
ance. ard assigned duties as a Message Center clerk. Be-
cause MINTKENBAUGH, then assigned to the 2 Section as
chief clerx, would te able to detect JOHNSON taking photo-
graphs in the office. and because JOHNSON believed that
MINTKENBAUGH could act as a lookout for JOHNSON during the
period he was photographing documents, JOHNSON decided to
recruit MINIKENBAUGH. He subsequently "tested" MINIKEN-
BAUGH and recruited him to commit espionage for the Soviets.
The recruitment was accomplished without the prior know-
ledge or approval of the Soviets. JOHNSON believes MIX
KENBAUGH was agreeable because of the excitement of the
idea. JCHNSCN and MINTKENBAUCH subsequently lived to-
gether and were closely associated in espionage activities.
Hedwig lezter escorted MINTKENEAUGH to East Berlin, after
which MINTKENBAUGH came under the direct supervision of
the Soviets and no loncer worke¢ for JOHNSON,

- During his assignment with G-2, JOHNSON photographed

‘almost everything in his office, including cables, rosters,

intelligence summaries, alert plans, evacuation plans, and
possibly clearance documents. Usually he photographed the
documents on his.lunch hour. JOHNSON also wrote reports
containing his personal observations and activities, which
he photographed for transmittal to the Soviets. Hedwig
acted as their courier, carrying the film to East Germany
in the hollowed out portion of: the heel of her shoe.

- When JOHNSON informed the Soviets that he expected
to be transferred out of Berlin some time in 1953 due to
an overage in his MOS, he was instructed to try to obtain
an assignment in. Heidelberg, Germany. . At that time JOHN-
SON was disillusioned with the Soviets since they had

informed him that much of the information he passed to the
Soviets was of no interest to trem. He therefore maze no
attempt to obtain the Heidelberg 2ssignment. Instezd, JOHN-
SON took leave to Wiestaden, Germany. Wher JCHNSCN next met
with his Soviet handler in Karlshorst, East Germany, JONSON
informed the Soviets he had been to Heidelberg and had re-
quested an assignment in the G-2 Section there. He was
questioned in detail about his trip, but believes he was
able*to convince the Soviets of the truth of his statements.

JOHNSON stated he had no contact with the Soviets after his

in the United States 1n 1957, through MINTKENBAUCH.

In July 1956 JOHNSOU was discharged from the Army and moved

to Las Vegas, Nevada. In the early parc of 1957 MINTKENZAUGH re-
contacted JOHNSON in Les Vegas and gave him a present cf $500 from

t

Soviets. No

‘onditions were atzuched to the gift, but JOHNSON

was. offered a salaried job if he would re-join the Army and again
work for the Soviets. The Soviets instructed JOHNSCN to cbtain
some type of work involving security. JOHNSON re-joined the Army

as instructed on 18 February 1957

all angles.

JOHNSON maintained contact with MINTKENBAUGH on 2 bi-monthly
He passed photographs, personal reports and the JP-4 fuel

sample to the Soviets through MINTKENBAUGH and was paid by the
Soviets on an average of $300 per month. JOHNSON was paid an
additional bonus for the JP-4 fuel sample, which was of particular
interest to the Soviets. He signed receipts for all payments
received.

by Vitaliy UR OV, who introduced himself as “Vintor."** In 7
Mis. JOHNSON's presence, URZIUMOV expressed an interest in JOHN- :

ex y post, a NATO supply installation, and in JOHNSON's i
job. which involved the handling of requisitions for supplies and 4
repiacement pacts for NIKE missile sites. He asked JOHNSON to

renew his intelligence work, and JCHNSON agreed.

Beginning in early January 1960, JOHNSON had approximately
eight meetings with URZAUMCV in Paris These etings took place
on the first Saturday of each month, ana during the first few of
them JOHNSON was a: panied by has-wife."** Originally it was
Plarsed that Hedwig would t a courrer, but s plan was dis-

detailed oral explanation of the information which he was furnish-
ing the Soviets. The meetings with UR2 ‘OV lasted from 15 to 30
minutes, and at them JCHNSON passed the information he had managed
to collect underwent training, and assisted in the development
of dead drops and emergency plans.

While stationed at Orleans. JOHNSON furnished the Soviets
with photographs of éccuments, typewritten reperts of his obser-
vations, and personality data on other persons working in the
Mutual Security Brance c£ the ordnance agency. Specifically he
passed information on the French S-iO and S-11 anti-tank wire-
controlled missiles, then in use by the NATO forces and on parts
supplied to NIKE-Ajax units in Italy as well as the locations of j
these units. He also gave the Soviets a complete description of i
his own job and duties and of the organization and structure of :
the ordnance agency.

In late 1960 JOHNSON found it necessary to seek a transfer
from Orleans because of his wife's mental condition.**** He dis~
cussed this transfer at length with URZHUMOV, who agreed that the

ia MINTKENBAUGH took JORNSON to Washington on his own initdative,
when, according to MINTKENBAUGH. he told his case officer
that JCENSON was waiting 1n a drugstore on Wisconsin Avenue
and wanted to meet him. The Soviet became greatly disturbed |.
and took MINTKEN2AUGH to task for acting without instructionss

of the Soviet Embassy as of March 1959. He replaced a sus- }
Pected Soviet Intelligence officer, and GOLITSYN stated that 5
he was almost"convinced” that URZHUMOV was a KGB officer.
URZHUMOV was scheduled to leave Paris in early 1965.

*** In a later debriefing, JOHNSON said that theymet "generally
every two weeks." JOHNSON's wife apparently attended neet~

information coming from the ordnance agency at Orieans was “not
too important."  URZHUMOV advised JOHNSON to try to get an assign-
ment either at SHAPE or EJCOM since the Soviets could use a
source at either of these headquarters.* JOHNSON reenlisted in
April 1961, end having requested assignment at Headquarters,

at Orly Field, a unit which he knew handled top secret and crypto-
Graphic material, According to JOHNSON, URZHUMOV eppeared to be

JOHNSON arrived at tne Orly Courier Transfer Station in May
1961 and for the next year met frequently with URZHUMOV. He was,
however, unable to furnish anything of intelligence interest be- 7
cause of stringent security precautions, but he did give URZHUMOY i
reports of personal activities, personality sketches, and sug-
gestions as to which individuals seemed to te potential recruits
for the Soviets. At one of their regular meetings in the fall of i
1962, URZHUMOY introduced JOHNSON to anew Soviet case officer. |
G.N. VLASOV, who called himself “Felix."** Thereafter JOHNSON
saw very little. of his former handler.

SON, the nature of the operation changed
after VLASOV nandling, JOHNSON said, proved
to ve more dir and less discreet than URZHUMOY'Ss had been: :
Where under URZHUMOV most of JOHNSON's time was spent on locat- 7
ing dead drops, the formulation of emergency plans, and training,
penetration of the vauit now became his primary mission» The
first preak in this direction came, JCHNSON said, when he was
able to optain the combination to the door jeading to the vault
area:*"* one of the officers in cha.ge had thrown in the trash t
can a piece of paper containing the combination in coded form 7
and JCHNSON retrieved it after the officer left the room. (JOEN- Et }
SON haé earlier made an impression of the key to the inner coor {
of the vault when one of his co-workers had inadvertently left 4
the key in the door. The Soviets had made a copy.) JOHNSON
describeé this phase of the operstion as being slow and careful, i,
He first wrote seports on every detail of the courier service, :
including schedules for arrivais, deliveries, and handling of
a classified materials. On VLASOV's instruction he also photo-~ :
graphed the vault door and the office and made detailed measure-
ments of the door and the vault, this was accomplished et night,
using a Minox camera furnished by the Soviets.

According co Jt

* "JOHNSON later said “Viktor” had told him that the only in-
‘ - formation of value that he hed supplied while stationed at
Orleans was that concerning the S-10 and S-11 missiles.

** VLASOV was scheduled to be replaced in Paris in January 1965.

*** JOHNSON has described the courier station as consisting of
two rooms, an office area and the vault. ‘Entrance to the
vault from the outer room was through two metal doors. The
first door was secured by a steel bar at either end of which

t was a Sargent and Greenleaf combination padlock. The second
door was secured by a key lock.”

During this period, too, JOHNSON began to establish a work
pattern by volunteering to work straight through the weekend
beginning Saturday morning and ending Monday morning. (He ex-
plained to his superiors and fellow workers that he wanted to
have Monday and Tuesday off in order to do the shopping and nows2-
cleaning for his wife, who was not veli. This errangement was -
agreeable to all, as everyone would have every weekerd off.)
JOHNSON also began to bring his shaving equipment and fsod to the
. office in an Air France bag; this bac wes to be used in the ofera-

a tion, and it was necessary that it be thought commonplace for him :
to carry it around, a

JOHNSON estimated that about a month elapsed between the tine ‘
he obtained the combination to the vavit and the first penetration.
During this time he and V!ASGV met acout every third nig’ to dis- :
cuss the penetration and plans were discussed for removing the
documents, the Soviets' processing of them, 2nd their sefe return
to the vault. The plan, as finally acreed upon, called for a
meeting or the Friday nicht before the penetration was to be mad
to discuss cetails and arrange meeting sites. All penetrations
were to be carried out during the midnight hours on Saturday;

JOHNSON was to enter the vaule at 2305 hours, obtain the material,

leave'the office ac 2313 hours, and make the delivery to the

Soviets at 2315 hours. As things worked out in pzactice, JOHNSON

said. he sometimes entered the vault somewhat earlier. His selec-

tion ef documents was on the basis of their addressees; all were

wrapped.* He would then go outside to wake sure no U.S. per-

sonnel were in the area, then lock the front door, open the vault,

teke the materials, lock the vault, and with the documents in his i
Air France bag drive to the meeting site a short distance away. F :
There he ould exchange the bag for en identical one provided by
the Soviets, containing sandwiches and a bottle of doped cognac,
and return to his duty post. JOHNSON explained that if on re-
turning to the station he was confronted by a visitor, he wes to
say that he had gone out to get some food; if it appeared that
the visitor planned to stay long enough to upset the plan, the
cognac was to be used (it never was used). A second ccntact
with the Soviets, to retrieve the materials, was scheduled for
between 0300 to 0400 hours at a different meeting site, about
six minutes' drive away.

On one or perhaps two occasions when the combination to the
lock had been changed. JOHNSON used a special device (supplied
by VLASOV) to determine the new combination. On 23 February
1965, JOHNSON said that he was quite certain he used this de-
vice twice, in February and Marcn 1963. This device was in
two sections, one of which was a plate. The device fit snugly
over the lock, the plate being placed to the rear of it, and
the device recorded the combination of the lock by means of
radioactive material in one section of it. JOHNSON said that
VLASOV gave him the new combination to the lock about a week
after he hed placed the device on the lock as instructed.
JOHNSON had earlier made photographs and detailed measurements
on the locks used to secure the vault door; because the

that described by NOSENKO, which lists bombing targets in
France and that it had been sent to France during this
period.



radioactive device supplied by VLASCY fitred then exactly, he
supposed that it had been mede especially for this penetration
operation.*

JOHNSON could not recall the date when the first penetration
of the vault was made, but he said that it couid not have been de-
fore November 1962 as his car was our of commission throughout
October. Definitely, according to JCHNSCN. there was » penetra- .
tion just before or after Christmes 1362, and tne first four pene- :
trations were spacec closely together Qu: ioned in detail on
this subject during February 1965, JCH N eventually arrived at
the estimate that there was Fo penetrat:on made in November 1962,
that tv. entries were made in December, and chat five more pene-
trations tcok plece during January-May 1963. Regard:ng the Decen-
ber penetrations, he first believed that they micht have been on
the 15th ard 29th of the month, ater saic that tnought
they had taken place on consecutiv turdays. and finally re-
affirmed his belief that one was made on the 29th and ruied out
the possibility of one on the 2znd. He believed that the January
entry took place in the middle of the month, probably the 19th,
and :aid hé was quite cervain that ar entry took place on 26

April.t*

The operation proceeded without disruption until it was
terminated during tre summer menths cf 63 on instructions from
VL2SCV, who felt that the days had too isng and that the
operation could not be carried our ‘light. Plans were dis-
cusseé for expanding the operation it was resumed in the fall,
however. Up until this time JOHN had keen instructed not to
take out more than i2 or 15 enveiopes at a time as the Soviet
technici *** couid not handle a lar quantity during the time
available. In the stepped-up operation, according to VLASOV,
sufficient personnel and facilities *ouid be available to process
approximately 30 envelopes.

scribed this device, or one very similar
to it, in Geneva on 12 June 1962 “X-rays are beamed against
a safe in order: to determine the combination by radiation...
that is, in order to open a new zsfe, any safe... The (spe-
cial) equipment is contained in two suitcases; they turn it
on and rays are emitted in order to sense vi combination
should be chosen." JOHNSON said the dev was contained in
two separate pocket-sized packages as a guard against. harm-
ful radiation, and both JOHNSON and NOSFNKO have described
the possible effects of this radiation on the health of its
operator. NOSENKO was not asked and did not volunteer why,
if this equipment was available at least as early as June
1962, it was not used earlier in the Orly penetration oper-
ation.

** By matching Saturdays with the dates on which CIA records
show the special techniciens named by NOSENKO to be in Paris,
ACSI arrived at the following possible dates for the penetra-
tions: 15 December 1962, 22 December 1962, 19 January 1963,
26 January 1963, 16 February 1963, 2 March 1963, and 25 May

that he did not feel that his espionage efforts at Camp Des Loges
had been very profitable for the Soviets. It was his opinion that
the most important Gocument to which he hed access during this
period was the top secret one on Seventh Army plans for retreat
to the Pyrenees in the event of a Soviet Army attack. when he
proposed that he ettempt to obtain it for the Soviets, however,
VLASOV showed a complete lack of interest. VLASOV's attitude led

. JOHNSON to believe that the Soviets already had the document.
JOHNSON stated further that it was his usual practice to scan>
documents which came into his possession and to make oral and
sometimes written reports to the Soviets on their general contents.
He specifically recalled discussing with: VLASOV the periodic
counterintelligence summaries issued by CIC to which he had access,
but VLASOV had not seemed interested in them. JOHNSON believed }
these discussions came up in connection with possible use of the H
"roll-over" camera, and that VLASOV’s response had been that the
informétion involved was not worth the risk of his exposure.*

JOHNSON recalled: that “at their last n2eting and for a few
meetings prior thereto, he and 'Felix' (VLASOV) did not stop at
a cafe as had beer. their practice.** Instead, the entire meeting
was congucted as they walked in the area of their point of con-
tact in Paris. At one of these meetings ‘Felix' apoeared to be
visibly upset. In fact, he had not appeared for a meeting on
the appointed date. The contact was not made until the alter-
nate date. At that time ‘Felix' suggested that he (JCHNSON)
knew why they had not met as scheduled. Whenhe (JOHNSON) replied
that he did not know, ‘Felix’ explained to him that a Soviet In-
telligence officer had defected in Gereva and that they had to :
be extremely cautious. ‘Felix’ told him that he did not have to 7 i
worry, that the off-cer did not know him, but 'Felix' instructed
him to destroy anything which could idencify him with Soviet
. Intelligence. 'Felix', wno normally was very calm and self- " 3
assured, was completeiy out of character on this occasion. At
this and succeeding meets before he returned to the United
States, he (JOHNSON) tried to tell 'Felix' about the status of
his expected rotation to the United States in May. ‘Felix' did
not appear to be interesteé in anything he had to say. Finally,

* JOHNSON said that in the Classified Control Section he had
access to all classified documents originating with Seine
Area Command and to some classified documents originating
in other Headquarters; he was responsible for supervising
the printing of classified documents and for accounting..for 5
and distributing all authorized copies of these documents. .
JORNSON was asked on 18 February 1965 whether it would have
been possible for him +o take original documents or copies
of them to his Soviet handlers. He replied that he could
have forged receipts and taken a document from the Center
on his person and, in addition, he could have made extra.
copies of any classified document. .He did not do: this i !

at a meeting in early April, when ‘Felix’ told him that it was
their last meeting, which came as 8 surprise to JOHNSON, he
(JOHNSON) raised the questior. of how. he was to notify ‘Felix" in
the event there was a change in his anticipated assignment to

the Courier Station in dashington for which he had not yet been
‘given official orders, ‘Felix’ in reply instructed him to place
on a Gesignated wall of a building somewhere in Paris the letter
‘a’ if he received orders for assignment in the Weshington area
and. the letter 'X' if he received crders for assigrment elsewhere."

At this meeting VLASOV also told JOHNSON that he was not to
worry 1f contact was not established immediately upon his return
to Washington. He then gave JOHNSON contact instructions which
called for the firet meeting to take place in New York City in
December 1964, eight months later. At some point in his cdiscus-
sions with VLASOV, JOHNSON told the FBI, he was surprised to see
URZHUMOV enter the cafe where they were sitting and join them at
the table. This was the first time thet all three had met to-

“gether since URZHUMOV had turned him over to VLASOV in 1961, prior

to the Orly penetrations. For URZHUMOV's benefit, VLASOV again
reviewed the arrangements for reestablishing con+act in December,
which gave JOHNSON an opportunity to express concern that he was
to be out of contact for such a long time and to suggest the
desirability of some sort of emergency contact arrangements such
as he had’ had during his duty tour in Paris. VLASOV and URZHUMOV
told JOPNSON that such arrangements would not be necessary.*

JOHNSON claimed to have had no contact with the Soviets
during his assignment at the Pentagon Courier Transfer Station
from May 1964 until he went AeOL in October of that year.

¥ According to MINTKENBAUGH, when JOHNSON contacted him in
Arlington after his return to the United States, JOHNSON
said that when he was leaving Paris the Soviets. treated: him
as though he was heing “dropped.” JOHNSON said he had been
instructed to get rid of all materials used in the operation i

before leaving France. He also told MINTKENBAUGH that an- yo aiemenae

other reason for this belief was the fact that he had asked
for instructions regarding emergency meeting procedures but
had been told by the Soviets that none were needed. MINT-..
KENBAUGH remarked to the FBI that this was a change in
usual procedures.

fulfilling other less 2mportant KGB <3 * He also indicated
that; during the latter part of his agent career, he was a
reluctant collacerator and became a handling problem for his
KG2- ease officers.

MINTKENBAUGH's career as a KGB agent began in the summer of
1953, ‘shortly after a chamse encounter with his old acquaintance,
JOHNSON. Within a matter of weeks JOENSON told MINTKEISAUCH that
he was a Soviet agent ard then, without consulting the KGB, re-
ecruited MINTKEN@AUGH as an assistant. JOXNSON's KG8 handlers.
were ‘extremely upset’ when they earned vhat JOHNSON had done
and 1t was not untal October 1953, some m nS iater, that th:
would agree to meet MINIXENBAUGH. In the interim he-assisted
JOHYSON by standing watch while the iatcer photographed docu-
ments. From Octoker 1953 to April 1954, when MINTKENBAUGH was
transferred temporarily to duty with.a military hospital in
France, he carried out a number of ignments forthe Soviets,
alinost all connected with the spotting and assessment of Americans
stationed in Jerlin. For the five-month period he was in France,
MINTKEIBAUGH claimed to have been out of touch with the KGS Upon
returning to kerlin in September 1954, he resumed his spotting
activities and spent a part of his time learning photography, the
construction and use of dead drops, and secret writing techniques
in preparation for his impending transfer to the United States.
He left Berlin in February 1956,

MINTKENBAUGH performed his next espionage assignment a year
later when, in January 1957, he visited and reactivated Sergeant
JOHNSON at KGB instruction. The iollowinc month he began service
as a courier between JOHNSON, who was stationed first in Califor-
nia and then in Texas, and the KG3 in Washington, D.C. Other than
these periodic courier trips, MINTKENBAUCH carried out no other
KGB assignments until the late fall of 1959.

Probably in October 1959, MINTKENBAUCH flew to Berlin and
from there, in company with a KGB officer, to Moscow, where he
was lodged in a safe apartment. For about three weeks he received
individualized training in photography, cryptography, and manual
Morse reception, with emphasis on the iatter. At the end of this
period, his case officer asked fo: the first time whether MINTKEV-
BAUGH was willing to marry a Soviet woman and tive with her in the
Washington area. According to the KGB plan as explained to MINT-
KENBAUGH at this time, he would “establish a roof over his head"
near Washington, preferabiy in Ariington; then, with the assis-
tance of his “operational wife" he would serve as a courier,

* Although NOSENKO did not report on MINTKENBAUGH, he and JOHN-
SON were so closely connected operationaliy and had such com-
plete knowledge of one another's:activities, that the confes-
sion of either agent would almost inevitably result in the
apprehension of the other. For this reason MINTKENBAUGH's
story is given here in some detail. ‘This account, for the
most part, was given as part of and subsequent to MINTKEN-
BAUGH's confession of complicity in Soviet espionage, but be-
fore he was convicted for conspiracy.

delivery to tne KCB via dead drops, Several days after this,
hile MINTKENBAUCH was still considering the KCB proposal,
he was visited by “Alex,” MINTKENBAUCH was told "Alex" was
a senior KCB official and a "very important person." ("Alex"
was later identified as Aleksandr FEKLISOV, then Chief of
the American Department of the KCB First Chief Directorate
and later, under the name FOMIN, KGB Legal Resident in
Washirgton.) “Alex” told MINTKENBAICH that nis Soviet wife
would serve only as a cover for MINTKENBAUGH's espicnage:
Her pr ce would allow MINTKENBAUSH to travel freely

ughout the United States (New York, California, end New
ico were mentioned spectficaily) without having to worry
about a “nagging wife," She also would be able to help hin
yationally, pasticulariy with radio communications, From
"Asex's" manner ard questions, NJTKENBAUIH gathered that he
had come mainly to "size him up" for this assignment, which
MINTKENBALGH now agreed to accept.

“Subsequently MINTKENBAUCH was introduced to his inteaded
bride, known to him only as "Ireze,"* and the two spent some
time together to yet acquainted. She nad either been informed
or recognized that MENTKENBAUGH was a homosex-al and told

the end of December 1959. His only a: from the Mos~
cow trip was to establish his own busin nm the Washington
area as soon as possible so that "Irere" could join him.

Pollowing KGB instructions, MINIKENBAICH moved to
Arlington, Virginia, in about October 1969, bet tailed to

eventually persuaded the KCB to accept his participation and
to contribute financial support) M{NIKENBALGH took out a
Virginia real estate license in the spring of 19€1 and found

was working for this firm, it was indicated that eventually
the KGB would like him to get a real estate office of his
own, which the Soviets would finance. MIN!KENBAUGH took
no steps to do so.

MINIKENBAUGH was also given a number of other assign-
ments during this period. One of these struck him as being
probably related to "Ireze's" dispatch to the United States.

tris female had. cnigrated to Finland h her famaly

as a child. Because of her age and "Ircne's" Saltic origin,

_MINTKENBAUCH speculated that the assignment aight be related :
‘to his principal ore. In November 1960 UINTKENBAUGH was

turned over to a new Soviet case officer who, probably sone

‘time in 14961, gave him a list of assignments which required

that MINTKENBAUGH travel] to Oklahoma to locate a number of

} missile sites. He was also to trace a petroleum pipeline fas
running from Texas to Pennsylvania, to pinpoint the location

of a U.S, Department of State high.frequency transmitter .
: near Warrenton, Virginia, and to determine the location of 3
underground facilities of either the State Department or A
CIA near Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. MINTKENBAUGH was success-
fl in carrying out some of these tasks and failed in others.

By carly 1962, accurding to MINTKENBAUGH, he was in
considerable financial difficulty. The real estate firm a
where he vas employed was going bankrupt, his remodeling ood
business required sizeable additional expenditures, and :
money was also needed to support other real est ventures
in California. MINTKENBAUGH egain approached the KGB for
funds, which were reluctantly given, The KGB case officer
was "quite upset" on this occasion and told MIN’ KENBAUGH
that the KGB could not continue to “pour money into the
[semodeling} operation." He again instructed MINTKENBAUGH
to finish up the business as soon possible so that he
could "stop wasting time" and establish his own cover firm.

bepressed by his financial reverses, MINTKENBAUGiI now
“pegan to feel increased pressures” because.of his involves
ment with the Soviets. He has since claimed that at this
time he wanted desperately to break off his relationship
with the Soviets but did not know how to do it. He has
stated his emotional condition "became so serious that he
decided that he had batter leave town for a while before he
had a nervous breakdown." During this period, MINIKENBAUGH
claimed, he was furnishing no information of value to the i
KGB but was merely going through the motions of cooperation. 4

For these reasons, MINTKENBAUGH sold his share in the
house-rcmodeling business to his partner in the spring of
1962, resigned his position with the real estate firm, and
unbeknown to the KGB, flew to Florida for about a month.*
He financed the trip with part of the money he had recently
received from his KGB handler. Shortly before departure eee f
MINTKENBAUGH ‘wrote a letter to JOHNSON in France explaining . -
that he was sick, that he was in dire financial difficulty 3
and needed more money, and that he was going away for a

1 while, He told JOHNSON to pass the letter to the Soviets.

the time to remain perranently in Florida: Tne trip was in 7
reality an attempt to “run avay, to drop out of his espion-

age activities." He hoped the KGB would lose interest in
him in hisabsence.. Tke letter to JOHNSON, MINTKENBAUGH
said, was ta give the Soviets a logical explanation for his
absence.* x

Nevertheless, MINTKENBAUCH returncd to Washington in
tine for his next scheduled me+ting with his KCB case officer. He
He returned, .MINTKENBAUGH toia the FBI, "to face the music."
The KGB officer was repurtedty furious that MINTXENBAUGH had
written t ‘OHNSON, a violation of the very specific instruc-
tions MINTKENBAUGH had earlier received to destroy JOHNSON's
address and eak all contacts with him, Shortly after bis
return, NINTKENBAUGH found a job with another Arlington
real estate agency. Fron this point on to the end of the
operation, his principal assigament wes to photograph rental
applications submitted by persons he knew or believed to work
for CIA or otherwise to be of interest to the KGB. i

The subject of the independent cover business and of
"Irene's" arrival in the United States was not dropped,
however, Soviet cfforts reached a high point, MINTKENBAUCH :
estinated. in Avgust 1962 when ha was summoned to a special 3
meeting and found “Alex” (FEKLISOV), whom he had last seen
in Moscow, waiting fur him at tae meet site. In what imq
essed MINTKENBALGH as a “pep talk," it was explained by
lex" th he had cone ail the way from Moscow to see him.**
MIATKENBALGH, he stated, was worth a great deal of money to
the Soviets, who were willing to give it to kim, but MINTKEN-
BAUCE must take immediate stcps to establish his own business. {
FEI SOV indicated that there had been no change in the plan
to send "Irene" to Washington once this was dose. Emphasizing
this point, “Alex said that the Soviets would assume respor-
sibility for all expenses involved in setting up such a
business and would cover any loses which might result.
Moreover, he advised MINTKESBALGH to devise sone sort of
cover story to explain the large amounts of money the KGB
was prepared to give hin. Other aspects of MI? NBAUGH'S:
performance, including his failvre to follew up on various
assignments in the Washington area, were also discussed.

“In fact, if MINTKENBAUCH had not written to JOHNSON, it is
likeiy that his absence would have gone unnoticed by the KGB,
for he had no dead drops to service or meetings scheduled in
this period. There are other examples of this alleged anbi-
valence on MINTKENBAWH's part. He has told the FBI on :
several occasions that he was looking for a way to break con= ‘ i
tact with the KGB and once said the "during recent years he 4
had been intentionally careless from a security standpoint

and did not care whether he would be apprehended in connection
with his Soviet operation." On the other hand,’ JOHNSON has
said that MINTKENBAUCH was depressed when the KGB finally did
drop contact with him and that MINTKENBAUGH went to consider-
able lengths to reestablish it.

**The August 1962 date is apparently incorrect, as is "Alex's"
statement that he came to the United States especially to see
MINTKENBAUGH, Travel records indicate that FEKLISOV, who
arrived in Washington in 1960, was out of the country from

18 July to 10 September 1962. :

: Mention continued to be made of the KGB plan at neetings ood
subsequent to “Alex's talk; MINTKEMBAUGH had nc doubts that,
as he had been told in Woscow, his primary mission was to
estdblish himself in a cover business of his owa, At one of
inese meetings MINTKENBAUCH was told that "Irene" had become
#21, but that the KCB planned to sond someone else in her
place as soon as MINTKENBAUGH could provide cover. The
latest meation of the plan which MINTKENSAUGH could recall
was at a meeting in the late summer of 1963, At that tine,
bis KGB case officer was distressed because 20 steps had a
been taken and told him: "I have been here two years with
you and this has rot happened." There is no indication in
WINTKENBANGH's confession that he ever toos any decisive
steps. to comply with KCB wishes in this regard.

These meetings in the late summer and/or early autumn of
2963 were apparently the last dirsuct contacts NTKENBAUGH
had with the KCK, At one of them, he recalled, his KGB
handler reveiwed the verbal recognition signais to be used
in the event that it became necessary for an unknown Soviet
to contact him and said that he, the KGB officer, "might

fot be around in the future,"* 3 KENBAUCH aext unloaded

his dead drop probably in Septemt

to develop the Tilm on which, according to established
procedures, schedules and sites for future meetings and dead
drops were given, Only parts of the KGB instructions could
be made out, however. MINTKENBAUCH took the biame for this, -
teliing the FBI that ke had “botched up the film" by using
faulty developer. He was able to determine only that his
emergency meeting site had been changed and that his next
dead drop was scheduled for loading on 23 November 1963, but
he did not know the location of either, MINTKENBAUCH's
means of contacting the KUB therefore was broken. Although
thereafter 2 appeared at various of his previous meeting
sites in the Washington area and called the emergency tele-
phoze number given him by his case officer, MINTKENBAUGH
was unsuccessful in reestablishing contact, The KG3 took
29 initiative to do so, insofar as MINIKENBALGH knew. **

JOUNSON's disappearance and an FBI interview concerning
JOHNSON on 10 November 1964 caused MINIKENBAUGH to *tovart

on bis roommate o drive
bim to CIA Headquarters. There, during the nig or 10-11
November, he confessed his espionage activities to a CIA
representative, The next day, before the FBI had a chance

- to talk to him, MINTKENBAUCH moved out of his apartment in

- Arlington and disappeared. The FBI located him on 5 Deceme
ber 1964 at his brother's mountain cabin in California.

Pree *MINTKENBAUGH's case officer at the time was S.D, ROMANOVTSEV,
who did not leave the United States until December 1964, more
than a year later.

2*According to JOHNSON, MINTKENBAUGH told him in the spring
of 1904 that he was considering as a last resort travelling
to Mexico under a false identity in order to recontact the
Soviets there. There is no evidence that he attempted to do

(c) Hedwig JOHNSON's Statenents

Mrs. JOHNSON's active participation in Soviet espionage
was short in time and limited in scope, encompassing only the :
period from 1953 to 1954 when she acted as a courier for
JOHNSON in Berlin, She did, however, remain knowledgeable
of JOHNSON's, and to & lesser degree MINTKENBAUGH's, iptellie
gence activities and was-.later able to describe these to the

FBI. ae

Mrs. JOHNSON's account of her recruitment generally
agrees with that given by her husband. She told the FBI
how JOUNSON, embitterec over his failure to receive an
expected promotion, had sent her to East Germany to contact
Soviet officials for the purposes of offering them his
services, Mra, JOHNSON said that JOHNSON was primarily
interested in revenging Himsel? against the U.S. Army end
hed forced her into accepting this mission by telling her
that he would not marry lier otherwise. Her first attempts
to ostablish contact with the Soviets at Karlshorst in early
1953 were fruitless, and it was not until about three months
later that she succeeded in delivering JOHNSON's message.
She was told to return to Karlshnorst the same evening with

her husband.

At this first meeting, the JOHNSONs were questioned by
a group of about seven Soviets concerning JOHNSON's desire
to cooperate against the United States and his motivations
for wishing to do so. JOHNSON gave the Soviets no classified
information eat this time and no decision wes made that night
about using him. The Soviets said they first wanted to 7
check on JOHNSON and his wife, At the close of the meeting,
Mrs, JOHNSON was given false identity papers to facilitate
future crossings of the sector border.

Shortly thereefter, Mrs. JOHNSON eccompanied her husband
to a second meeting with the Suviets. Again, she said,
JOHNSON passed no information to the KGB other than a copy
Of his leave papers, After the meeting, however, JOHNSON
asked her for a pair of shoes so the Soviets could alter
the heels to form & conccalment device, “This was done.

On four of five occasions prior to JOUNSON's transfer to the
United States in 1954, she crossed the border carrying film

negatives which JOHNSON had placed in the shoes. According

to Mrs. JOHNSON, she never knew what was on the film and she
received no money other than for expenses from the Soviets.

JOHNSON married her, as promised, in April 1953,

This apparently comprised her total espionage career,
but JOHNSON was in the habit of discussing the details of
his activities with her. In addition, she often accompanied
JOHNSON to operational meetings after his return to France
‘in 1959 and until her deteriorating mental condition made
this inadvisable in November 1960. (She still went with .
JOHNSON to the vicinity of the meetings and waited for him.)
Her knowledge of his activities thus wes practically total.
JOHNSON, for example, gave her full details of the Orly Pene~
tration, including descriptions of the methods used to achieve
initial entry, how he selected documents for the Soviets,
and the procedures used to pass the documents to his case
officer and later return them to the vault.

Mra. JOHNSON's knowledge of MINTKENBAUGH's espionage
activities was less detailed. She had accompanied MINTKEN=
BAUGH when he was first introduced to the Soviets and was
present at at least one later meeting; she was aware that he
was involved in the photography of documents with JOHNSON
in Berlin; Strs. JOHNSON knew that MINTKENBAUGH hed “gone to
Russia and there received an assignuent from the Soviets."
From MINTKENBAUGH's -letters to her and-JOHNSON while they
were stationed in France, Mra. JOHNSON learned of MINTKEN~
BAUGH's real estate ventures and got the impression that

‘"MINTKENBAUGH was using his real estate background to assigt

Soviet agents in getting located [in the United States] ."
JCHNSON, she said, put a stop to the exchange of letters
with MINTKENBALGH, telling her that MINTKENBAUGH had written
things he should not have mentioned and that Mrs. JOHNSON
(who was about to onter a mental hospital for treatment)
“might talk about Soviet egents entering the United States»

_and setting up business firms."

(d) Mental Condition of Hecwig JOHNSON

Mrs. JOHNSON’s nental instability first manifested. itself ' ‘|
in serious form is late 1960, while JOHNSON was assigned to the :
ordinance agency of the Orleans Area Command in France.

At that time, JONSON said sae persisted in claiming that

she was boing followed by a black sedan, that there was @

microphone in the refrigerator, that she had been acquainted

with the recent American defectors Martin and Mitchell,

and thot JOHNSON was having -an affair-with a local French- ~~ Svesdastatatevsstnres iii cfrmesccteris
girl who stayed with their children.*

tba

As a result, Mrs. JOHNSON was admitted to the Army
Hospital at La Chapelle, France, in November 1960 and was
Jater moved to another hospital at Landstunl, Germany. Ske
was under professional observation for about a month on this H
oceasion and returned home shortly before Christmas 1960. i
Following her release from the hospital, Mrs. JOHNSON was :
unable to sleep, and as the local doctor would not ‘prescribe
more than two slecping pills a week, JOHNSON took her to
Vienna in January 1961, After she had been examined, JOHN-
SON was told that she would havo to remain in a private hospi-
tal there for an indefinite period of time for medication.
When JOHNSON later returned to Vienna, the hospital doctors
advised him to have Mrs. JOHNSON live for several years in Fi
Vienna with her fanily or, as an alternative, in some other
large city with a German-speaking population in order to
provide an environment to which she nad been accustomed.

create aldlanid ais,

She returned twice to Vienna for shock treatment and
examinations while JOHNSON remained in France. When JOHN-
SON travelled to Vienna to get Nrs. JOHNSON after the second
of these visits in the fall of 1962, her doctor told him that
she had referred to him (JOHNSON) as a “Russian general" 7
and had accused one of the nurses of being a Soviet spy. j
(Earlier, in the presence of neighbors, JOHNSON was accused H
by his wife of being a spy.) JOHNSON learaed from his }
father-in-law that Mrs. JOHNSON hed also told him that JOHN~
SON was a Russian general, Eventually lirs. JOHNSON was i
persuaded to commit hersclf to a U.S. Army hospital, and at A
the end of April 1964 she was evacuated from France to Walter .
Reed Hospital in Washington. (JOHNSON and his children
returned to the United States several days later.) She was
released shortly afterward, but her erratic behavior, JOHN-.
SON said, prompted his disappearance in October 1964,

The FBI report of this debriefing of JOHNSON states
that "as an overall analysis cf his wife, he described her 4
as over-sexed. During the past 10 years her sexual demands ;
had tripled over what they had previously been and she never fe
seemed to be sexually satisfied." MINTKENBAUGH's statements 7
tend to confirm this evaluation. He. has described Mrs. JOHN- :
SON as being a nywphomaniac who indiscriminately indulged in
any kind of sexual activity with persons of either sex. Fur-
thermore, for two years she prostituted herself regularly with
JOHNSON's knowledge while weekending in Las Vegas; he gambled
with the proceeds.

Mrs. JOHNSON is now confined in a Virginie mental insti-
tution. #

*JOHNSON has denied the latter charge. Nevertheless, JOHNSON
on his own initiative did tell the French girl that he was &
Soviet spy, and he sounded her out concerning her willingness
to work for the Soviets.

(e) Soviet Concern About Mrs- JOHNSON's Illness

When it became apparent that his wife's treatment in
Vienna nad been unsuccessful and that. he would have to
leave Orleans to find a more suitable environment for her,
JOHNSON discussed the matter in detail with his KGB case
officer. In the fall of 1962, after he made photographs
of the vault door for URZHUMOY, “the Minox camera was re-
turned to the Russians, This [according to JOHX iN] was done
f Soviet concern Y Hedy"S, mental Conditions TT TTT
was instructed to retain no incriminating naterials
in his possession.” After URZHUMOV learned of Mrs, JOHNSON's
confinement in a U.S. military hospital, JOHNSON said he
became "all shook up" about the possibility that she might
talk. URZHUMOY told JOHNSON to inform his wife that he was
no lénger working for the Soviets, and JOHNSON must never
again bring her to an. operational meeting. URZHUNOV also
advised JOHNSON to cease all intelligence activity for a
while, and all espionage paraphernalia was to be returned to E t
the Soviets.* Reviseu and more elaborate emergency contact
arrangements, providing for contact in Vienna and Washington
as well as Paris, were agreed upon to replace earlier, un-
successful procedures, and preparations were made for JOHN~
SON's eScape should he be compromised. He said on 6 Janu- #
ary 1965 that there was no particular pressure concerning 7
the emergency contact and escape arrangenents “except that -
there was always the question and corcern that nis wife :
might talk."

ate bs sas

Soviet fear that Mrs. JOHNSON might talk also was re~
flected in the handling of “MINTKENBAUGH in Washington. MINT-
KENBAUGH explained to the FBI that "during the period when
Hedy was confined to an Army hospital in Europe [November
and December 1960] his KCB case officer arranged with him
to effect an ‘eye-to-eye’ meeting-at—Brentano's Bookstore
in downtown Washington, D.C. MINTKENBAUGH was scheduled to
visit the bookstore three times a week for a three-week
period. The Soviet indicated that this procedure was to be ;
adopted in order that it would be assured that Hedy bad said
nothing during her hospital confinement which would expose
the operation. MINTKENBAUGH said that he presumed that the
Soviets had effected arrangements in Europe to become aware
in the event licdy would reveal any facts concerning her know-
ledge of Soviet Intelligence, In the event Hedy did talk
and a dangerous situation resulted, the Soviets were to ad=
vise MINTKENBAUCH through a drop or by a meeting." o

*In other tellings, JOHNSON has also said that the espionage
equipment, which included a Minox camera and tripod and a
flashlight with a "hollow-battery” concealment device, was
returned to URZHUMOV at his (JOHNSON's) own suggestion.

(vi) Damage by JOHNSON to U.S, Interests :

The following excerpts are from a preliminary damage’
assessment* of JOHNSON's espionage activities since 1953
which was submitted to the U.S. Intelligence. Board by its
Security Committce on 11 January 1966: -

“The relatively low level of sensitivity of the
information which JOHNSON passed to the Soviets during
his assignments in Berlin, the U.S., and Orleans,
France, coupled with the passage of tine since those
activitics, permit an initial assessment of relatively
minor damage.

"The damage done by JOHNSON at Orly, however, is
of another order of magnitude, Extensive investigative
efforts by the affected members of the U.S, intelli-~ t
gence community [NSA, CIA, State Department, DIA, and
the military services|...have succeeded in identifying :
both the type, and in some cases, the specific docu-
ments, which were in’the Orty vault at some time during
the period November 1962 to May 1963. But it hes not
been possible to identify prcetisely which documents
were in the vault on the dates of the penetrations....

The only viable assumption...is that all the documents

to-which JOHNSON had physical access during the period

of his vault penetrations, i.¢., all the documents in

the vault, were subjected to possible compromise by t

the Soviets....The review, which is Continuing, in-
- volves a considerable volume of documents which may

total more than a thousand.

"The full extent of damage will only be known
when the current review of documents by all affected
agencies is completed.** The damage assessments pre-
pared by the military services, however, based on a
review of their documents to date, indicate that as a
result of access to documents in the Orly vault, the i
Soviets may have learned:

1. Details of the Single Integrated Opera-
tional Plan (SIOP) including the attack plans of
the Joint Chicfs of Stafi, the identity of Soviet
targets, the tactical plans of USAF elements in-
cluding weapons systems and methods of delivery.

*Compilation of the final damage assessment has been compli-~
cated by three factors. One was the difficulty involved in :
4 determining what specific documents may have passed through seicelas
the Orly Courier Transfer Station during his assignment there.

Second, since all documents remained wrapped while at the

station, JOHNSON himself has been of little assistance in

identifying them, although he has said that he concentrated:

his selection on documents addressed to particular commands.

Finally, Armed Forces courier service records for this period

have been. destroyed,

"From these preliminary reports,..it is evident
that Sgt. JOHNSON's cooperation with Soviet Intelligence

The initial damage assessment docs not cover the period
from August 1963 until May 1964, wher JOHNSON had access to 7
all classified documents originating with the Seine Area
Command and to documents from a number of other commands.
JOHNSON has insisted that, during this period, ne passed only 7
one "Secret" decument to his Soviet handlers; ke has admitted,
however, providing oral and some written reports concerning
documents he read which were classified "Secret" and "Confi-
dential” and which concerned emergency and evacuation plans :
of the Setne Area Command, Having claimed no contact with H
the Soviets after he began his duty tour at the Pentagon,
JOHNSON has thus indicated that he furnished no information
to the KGB for that period, which began in June 1964 and i
ended in his disappearance in October 1964.

4. Unsuccessful Approaches to U.S, Citizens*®

a. The HARMSIONE Case

(4) Introduction a

After providing the two promised leads** at his first
meeting with CIA on 9 June 1962, NOSENKO then volunteered
that the-KGB-in 1958 or-1959 had made en unsuccessful re- _ iz sitet
cruitment approach to Richard C, HARMSTONE, Secchd Secretary
at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. Initially NOSENKO said that
the KGB had photographs of HARMSTONE in homosexual ss well
as heterosexual ects, but in 1964 he stated that although
the KGB knew HARMSTONE to be @ homosexual, it had no phcto-
graphs of him in such activities. The KGB, thanks to micro=
phones in the Kmbassy, learned thet HARMSTONE did not tell
U.S. authorities the full story of the approach, omitting
the fact that approach was based partly cn his homo~
sexuality. HA TONE's report of the approach was not,
however, made in the Embassy. When HARMSTONE was reassigned
from Moscow, @ mary of his XGB file was turned over to
the KGB First Chief Directorate, and NOSEMKO indicated that
he waé unaware of any developments in the case thereafter.
Since the approach was made prior to his transfer to the
U.S. Ecbassy Secti of the American Department in January
1960, NOSENKO said he did not personally participate in the
operation but was infowmed of it by V.M. KOVSHUK, Chief of
the Section. The cificers who did take part in the case
could not be idenii?sed by NOSENKO.

HARMSTONE, a bachelor, was posted to Moscow in Octo-
ber 1957, He went to the security office in the Embassy on
23 May 1959 to report a series of events which kad culminated
the day before in his having been approached for recruitment
by a self-admitted KGB officer (then known to HARMSTONE only
as "Sergey" but later identified as KOVSHUK). The approach
was based, with accompanying photugraphs, on his alleged
homosexuality, an allegation which HARMSTONE denied in his
interview by the Embassy Security Officer. He refused to
collaborate, HARMSTONE said, but he had agreed to meet "Sergey"
on 23 May. In keeping with his instructions from U,S, authori-
tics, HARMSTONE lunched with "Sergey" that afternoon and
thereafter avoided holding meetings with him. After his
reassignment from Moscow in October 1959, HARMSTONE admitted
to the Department of State Security Office that he had a
homosexual background and the phdtographs shown to him by
KOVSHUK had been genuine, but he again claimed to have rejected
the recruitment attempt. HARMSTONE subsequently resigned from
the Department.

Among the CHEREPANOV papers passed to the Noscow Embassy
in November 1963*** was a document dated August 1958 on the
KGB plans for operational activity against HARMSTONE,

*NOSENKO kas described a total of five unsuccessful attempts
by the U.S, Embassy Section, American Department, KGB Second
Chief Directorate to recruit U.S. Embassy personnel stationed
in Moscow. Two of these, the attempted recruitments of mili-
tary code clerks KEYSERS and STORSBERG in which NOSENKO says
he participated personally, are discussed in Part V.E.3.c.
The remaining three are described here.

#*These are the BELITSKIY and "ANDREY" leads, ‘discussed in
Parts VI.D.6. and VI.D.3.b., respectively.

“464,

Details on the HARYSTONE case from NOSENKO and other
sources are presented below,

(41) Information from NOSENKO

On 9 June 1962, at his first meeting with CIA in Geneva,
NOSENKO said at the outset that he would sell two items of
information in return for the money he needed, and that he
“would tell CIA-no more-~-After—he had-finished describing —
the “ANDREY” case, however, he volunteered a story about
HARMSTONE, a Second or Third Secretary at the American Em-
bassy in Moscow. The KGB tried to recruit him, but he re-
fused the approach. Previously the KGB ad used both female
and male agerts against him, and the KCB had photographs of
the homosexual side as well as his activities with girls.
NOSENKO believed that HAHMSTONZ did not tell the whole story
to the U.S. officials, reporting only that there nad been
an approach to him based on compromise with women. The
report on the approacn had not been submitted in the Embassy.
(SOSENKO did not say where he reported it, however.) At
this meeting, having calied the BE. 17SKIY case the first
matter he would give to CIA and “ANDREY" the second, NOSENKO
characterized the HARMSTONE case thus: ."HA#MSTONE. HARM-
STONE, This is already the third item. 8e patient. That's
enough for today. (Laughing.)" :

In February 1964 at CIA request, NOSENKO reviewed the
CHERERANOV documents, one of which concerned a KGB plan for
operations against Richard HARMSTONE. Part of the plan,
according to the documcat, was to get HARMSTONE drunk and
photograph him in intimate relations with a Soviet girl.
NOSENKO said this was in fact the way tle KG3 did get the
material on which it based the later approach to him: "They
got him drunk, At the same time they had him photographed.
And after that they talked with him. They tried to recruit
him, but he evaded the proposition. He declined the recruit-
ment. But he also said nothing; he did not report. For this
reason they consider that if he comes into their view again
somewhere, even in a third country, ther they will get to
him and say: ‘How about recruitment? This happened on such
and-such. You did not report it. Have you thought it over?
You are hiding it for so long from your government, from the
State Department, that you had cortact with Soviet Intelli-
gence.'" NOSEMKO was asked how the KGB knew HARMSTONE had
not reported the approach. He replied: "He was monitored,
and we would have heard if anything about this matter was
reported....Undoubtedly if he reported it, something would
have been heard from [the KGB microphone in] the Minister. |
Counsellor's [office] .They would dictate a message on this.

Asked who tried to recruit HARMSTONE, he said, "I do
not know. That was prior to my coming into the department.
This was in the year 1958 or 1959. I don't know who was the
case officer who spoke to HARMSTONE." Asked if this officer
was still in the American Department, he replied: “I don't
think he is. I don't think he is concerned with it anymore.”

Later reinterviewed concerning the HARNSTONE case,
NOSENKO repeated his assertion that he could not identify
the KCB officers who were persorally involved in the case,
adding that he had learned of the case from KOVSHUK. He
also repeated his statements that the XGB knew HARMSTONE

had rot given the Embassy a full account of tae recruitnent
approach; this was known from the microphones in the Erbassy,
from the telephores, and from the fact that HARUSTONE did |
not leave the Soviet Union immediately. (He thought that |
HARMSTONE had left the Soviet Union rot long after the ap- 3
proach was made, toward the end of Lis tour, and it was not

an early departure.) The KCB also knew HARMSTONE to be a

homosexual, but did not nave any pictures of him in this kind 4
anes _ of activity; the KGB did nave, however, a series of nude Sedcecoeseeeeeceesnieeiaee aie
pictures of him with a female agent, and NOSENKO believed 4
these photographs had. been shown to HARNSTONE in the course 3
of the recruitment attempt. NOSENKO thought that the KGB ;

may have had more informaticr on HAKMSTONE. than he, NOSENKO, i
was aware of and could tell CIA--otherwise, he said, the KGB

would not have made the approach. HARMSTONE left i ¢
Mosce:, NOSENKO added, a summary of his file was given to H
the First Chier Directorate, but he never heard whether they 1
had made an attempt to contact him thereafter.

(141i) Informatien from Other Sources

HARMSTONE, one of the economic attaches at the Enbassy,
shared an office with William TURPIN, also an econoaic
attache, until TURPIN » replaced in Avgust 1958 by George

_ WINTERS.* WINTERS and ISTUNE worked together until HARM.
STONE finished his tour in October 1959.

The KCB plans for operational activity against HARMSTONE
outlined in the CHEREPANOV document dated August 1958 tally
closely with information reported in Foreign Service dis-
patches by TURPIN, HARMSTONZ, and Janes RAMSEY, and sub-
sequently confirmed by HARMSIONE in interviews conducted by
the FBI. The descriptive details in the CHEREPANOV document
about the agents to be used against HARMSTONE are quite
specific and, when matched against the Foreign Service cis-
patches, make it fossible to identify them even thotgh the
document uses only cryptonyms when reterring to them. For
example, the plan states: "Through the agent 'NIKONOV,' who
works in the Institute of Economics of the Academy of Sciences
USSR, continue to rerder to HARMSTONE small favors on a re~
ciprocal basis (cooperation in arrarging visits with economists,
visits to the institute, etc.) trying, on his part, to obtain
from HARMSTONE materials on the economics of South America
(the specialty of 'NIKONOV')."" TURPIN, HARMSTONE himself,
and WINTERS each reported having many contacts with Yu.V. BELOV,
who was the American Embassy's liaison contact with Soviet
economists, particularly in the Institute of Economics of
the Academy of Sciences. BELOV was fluent in Spanish, and 4
was concerned with economic problems of South America.
Similarly, most of the other agents have been identified with
individuals on whom there was detailed information available
from overt contacts in Moscow.

HARXNSTONE came to the security office ir the Embassy
on the morning of 23 May 1959 and stated that he was in
serious difficulty and wanted to discuss the matter. He told
of having been drugged while dining at the home of BELOV in
April 1959; also present was a “cousin” of BELOV's who was

other Soviets who were part of the day's outing, among them
a couple named "SOKOLOV" (identifiable in the CHEREPANOV
paper as the casa officer A.M. MIKHAILOV and the agent - «
“KRUCHININA"). At a visit’ to a dacha after lunch, a friend
named "Sergey" was present and made HARMSTONE's acquaintance.

“Sergey” then identified himself to HARMSTONE zs a worker
of the KGB who had been investigetiug the case of a “notorious
homosexual,” naming BELOV's "cousin." /

Also, "Sergey" offered to assist HARMSTONE in his career,

and gave hin his office number, to be called from outside

the Enbasey lest HARMSTONE should be overheard making the”

call.

Following the initial interview with the Security Of- .
ficer, the latter reported the situation to the Minister 5
Counsellor, Richard DAVIS, wno concurred in the Security 7 '
Officer's belief in HARMSTONE's innocence of the homosexual ;
allecation. The two agreed that HARNSTONE might keep the -
scheduled appointment to have lunch with “Sergey” that same A
arternoon. i

"Sergey" did most of the talking that afternoon, ac~
cording to HARMSTONE, commenting on a number of the Embassy
personnel and various prominent Soviet personalities.
“Sergey” planned for HARMSTONE to lunch with him the fol-
lowing week, but, followirg instructions of the Security
Officer and Minister Counsellor, HARMSTONE thereafter fended
off "Sergey" by telling him it was pointless for HARMSTONE

: to see him, that the KGB knew the situation to be "completely
phoney," and that the KGB should stop harassing him; he
wanted no assistance, no further luncheons, no other appoint= i

i on a dinner HARMSTONE was having in a restaurant with @ :

casual Soviet contact (a student) in August 1959. HARMSTONE :

. said he repeated his refusal to see "Sergey" and the latter

departed.

In August or September of 1959 HARMSTONE passed a note
to the Security Officer in the Embassy in which he reported
that he was certain that his KGB friend "Sergey" was identical
with George WINTERS* contact in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
Y.M. "KOMAROV'* He explained how he had come to this discovery: i

*KOMAROY is the alias used by KOVSHUK on his ten-month visit
to the United States in 1957-1958 #nd later in Moscow with
his American contacts, until 1963 when he began to use his

that be would cooperate, then deciding that he would not.

The KGB then sent hima several more letters threatening to exe

told the Ambassador of the situation, He was immediately
sent home, and that ended the operation.

In 1964 NOSENKO denied that he had had eny personel
role in the case, explaining that as a junior officer in the
U.S, Enbassy Section at the time, working on correspondants,*
be would not have taken part in so important en operation,

He said that he had heard about the operation from V,X,
KOVSHUK, whose case it was at the time. (On a later occasion
NOSENKO claimed that in a legal sense he had a personal role
in the case; ke was assigned to a phone-watch to receive sur-
veillance reports on the operation.) Otherwise, the accounts
by NOSENKO of the SMITH operation have been consistent with
the story he related in 1962,

(c) The BINDER Case
(i) Information from NOSENKO

While reviewing notes he had brought te a meeting in
Geneva on 26 Janusry 1964, NOSENKO first: mentioned the
unsuccessful attempt to recruit Peter BINDER, NOSENKO said
that BINDER, the “top Sergeant in charge of America House,"

room at the America House for some time and had been obtaining
articles such as dresses and coats forher from the United
States, Because BINDER's activities were confined to America
‘House, the KGB-was unable to photograph his indiscretions
and thus had little means to exert pressure on him. The
recruitment approach consequently failed.

In later intervievs by CIA and the FBI, NOSENKO idesti-
fied the woman ‘olved as Galya MORELLI, a KGB agent 6n=
ployed at America liouse as a dishwasher, NOSE’KO said that
Vladirir DEMKIN of the U.S, Embassy Section was the case of-
ficer working egeinst BINDER, and that S.M. FEDOSEYEV, Chief
of the American Department, took part in the approach. This
was in 1962, NOSENKO said, after he had transferred to the
Tcurist Gepartment, and for this reason he ‘could provide
no further detuils on the case,

(44) Information from BINDER

Master Sergeant Peter BINDER arrived in Moscow, where

he was assigned as manager of Amcrica House, on 16 March 1961.*
He was approached by the KGB on 15 January 1963 and reported
the KGB attempt to U.S, Embassy officials the same day. On

22 January 1963 BINDER was withdrawn from Moscow before the t
completion of his tour. At the airport as he was leaving, }
the Soviets attempted to prevent his departure by saying :
that he had never beer properly accredited to the USSR,
The plane was delayed for abcut 15 minutes while a heated . j
exchange took place between Soviet officials and tke American i i
officers accompanying BINDER, He then was allowed to leave.
The following description of the Soviet recruitment attempt
is drawn from devriefings of BINDER by the U.S, Embassy Se-
curity Officer in Moscow on the day of the incident and from
debriefings by the FBI and Department of the Army after his
return to the United States.

In about December 1961, according to BINDER, he first
became intimate with MORELLI, a dishwasher at America House
whom he has described as being a pretty, intelligent, well-
manicured girl of about 26. Their relationship continued

‘ until June or July 1962, at which time MORELLI “disappeared”
from her job without notice while BINDER was on leave. During

¥It was BINDER who summoned the Embassy Security Officer, i

Hugh MONTGONERY, to Anerica House in the summer of 1962 when i
he became euspicious of "LILLIAN," the "Austrian" girlfriend

telling MONTGOMERY that she was going to her hotel to get her 1
passport, which would prove her nationality, "LILLIAN" disap

their affair, BINDER occasionally gave MORELLI gifts of
money and clothing but restricted his meeticgs with her to
his room in the dormitory. In about February or March 1962
MORELLI came to BINDER and said that she thought she wes
pregnant; she nade no dezands of BINDER, hovever,. and eaid
nothing about getting an abortioa.:, Although at his first
interview in Moscow BINUER said that MORELLI at no time in-
dicated that she was required to obtain. information for the
Soviets,—he told the FBI -in late_February_1963 that_on one”
occasion in his rcom at America House MORELLI admitted to him
that she was sent to America House by the Soviets and that
all employees there were required to meet in two groups once
a month with their contacts [KGB officers] to discuss the
America House personnel.

On the morning of 15 January 1963, the day of the ap-
proech, BINDER left: America House on foot to got a haircut
at a Sovict barbershop, some 300 yards away. While he was
enroute, a car pulled up beside him, three “goons” strong=
armed him into the back;seat, and he was driven to @ nearby
Militia station. After some perfunctory questioning, one —
of the Militiamen made several phone calls, and an interroe
gator arrived a few minutes later.

The interrogator had a letter which he said had been
mailed by MORELLI to the U.S, Embassy and had been inter-
cepted by the KGB. The letter contained numerous allegations
against BINDER, which the interrogator preceeded to list.
Among them, BINDER was able to recall the following:

-On 25 November 1961 there was a party at America
House for Soviet enployees, a?’ter which BINDER and
MORELLI went to BINDER's room. Subsequently BINDER
and MORELLI lived together as man and wife.

-At another party, in December 1961, BINDER
inted out five cnulisted men living in America House
Pine letter named them] telling MORELLI that they were
informants for John ¥, ABIDIAN, the Enbassy Security
Officer.* He told MORELLI t the girls working in
America House should be particularly careful of Charles
GIDARO, as he was ABIDLAN's right-hand nan.

-In February 21962, MORELLI told BINDER that she was
pregnant, and BINDER instructed her to get an abortion,

~At the George Washington's Birthday Party in 1962
BINDER pointed out ABIDIAN to MORELLI and Svetlana
IVANOVA, another employee of America Rouse, and told then
to be careful of him as he was the Embassy Security Offi-e
cer.

~At some point BINDER gave a sewing machine to &
Soviet citizen to seil forhim At another time BINDER
crdered from the United States’a coat for the America
House exployee Luba TISHKINO, but then told her that it
had been lost in the mail, The coat was not really lost,
however; BINDER gave it to one of the old cooks at Ameri-
ca House because she paid him money for it.

After asking whether BINDZR was acquainted with
Mr. LOHRER of the West Cerman Embassy, the. interrogator

asked if BINDER hid given LOHRER goods to sell on the
Soviet market.

7 -Jn April 1962, BINDER told MORELLI that Hugh |

: MC OMERY had arrived at the U.S, Embessy as Security
Ofzicer, that MONTCOMZRY was a good friend of his, and

that he had told MONTCOMERY about his effsir with

it.

-BINDER told MORELLI and Svetlana IVANOVA that
Richard C, JACOB,* a U,S, Embassy employec, was a "well-
trained spy" and that MORELLI and IVANOVA should there-
fore be careful of hix.

In cescribing his convereation at the Militia station,
BINDER said tinat, after the interrogator had asked’a number
of quegtions, he, BINDER, complaired that the Soviet was
talking too fast, An interpreter was thereupon called in
and remained until BINDER «as questioned concerning JACOB,

At this point. the interpreter left and tha interrogator
continued to question BINDER on versozal matters. Except

for the relatively short tims the interpreter was there,

all questioning was in Russian, which BINDER gererally undere
stood. fter discussing BINDER's fanily, the interrogator
asked BINDER what ought to be done about the letter and the
charges it contained. He suggested that if the letter were
sent on to the American Ambassador, to whom it was addressed,
U.S, officials would not belicve BINDER's denials of the
charges, bis carcer in the Army would be ruined, and BINDER
Would io longer be able to support his two daughters, According
to BINDER, his reply was that there was -nothirg he could do
if the Soviets decided to forward the letter, and "that would
be that.” The interrogator then left the room.

When he returned about i5 minutes later he spoke to
BINDER in a friendly manner, commenting that BINDER had been
in Moscow for almost two years and that it was obviously
important for him to finish his tour there and remain in the
Army. BINDER agreed with this. The interrogator then said
that BINDER's actions whi! in the Soviet Union had been quite

‘proper, that he had always been very fair to the Soviet girls

who worked for hin, and that he, the interrogator, had decided
to help him, The Sovist continued that he was going te forget
about the letter and ail the charges contained in it and that
the letter would not be forwarded, He elso pointed out that
as the letter was not going anywhere, <here was ro need for
BINDER to mention the incident of his arrest to anyone. BIN-
DER was then driven back to the barber shop.

BINDER summed up the entire incident, which lasted a
little over two hours, by saying that the approach. was very
low-key and that at no time was he specifically asked to eup~
ply information to the Soviets, although this was implicit in the
remarks of his interviewers,

During questioning by U.S. authorities aftervards, a
BINDER seid that he had denied the truth of the allegations,
point-by-point, and that, apart from the charge that he was Si
intimate with MORELLI, none of them, in fact, were true. ;

be The VASSALL Case
G) Information from NOSENKO

At the 11 June 1962 meeting with CIA, NOSENKO first mention-
eg the lead which was later equated with William J.C. VASSALL, the
KGB agent in the British Admiralty. Neither then nor later in
1962 did NOSENKO identify this agent by name.

NOSENKO was asked on 11 June 1962 whether he had ever heard
Qf the KGB agent George BLAKE, "the man who compromised the famous
tunnel operation in Berlin,"* NOSENKO replied: "Yes, I did. But
I'll tell you this, that there was a far nore important Englishmina
who was our agent than BLAXE.** He is a very big man, and from him
we get all kinds of materials, We get all the details about NATO. H
He is our number one agent, the best of all intelligence informa- '
tion, He hed been in Moscow, and we recruited him there. We got
him on 2 homosexuality charge, a very extreme ore involving: multi-
ple persons. The case officers who recruited him received the
Order of Lenin... He is not an intelligence man. He is a high-
ranking man. He is working on all kinds of NATO matters and is
delivering most valuable information... He was in Moscow some
time ago. My friend and three others in the KGB section running 7
him received the Order of Lenin, ‘That is a very high distinction
for the KGB... I do not know the man's name, cut I do know when
he was in Moscow, and I know that he has a very high position.

“ “He is in London now." NOSNKO was reluctant to go into further

details at this, his second meeting with CIA, but he added: “red
tell you all about him tomorrow, my brothers. I will tell you Hl
many things tomorrow, and the day after... This is our number
one operation. There is no sum of money we would not be willing
to pay him.“

The next day NOSENKO was asked for additional information
about the “high level British agent," and he told his case offi-
cers: "I don't know the exact content of the material (he was
giving) except that they were very valuable military documents,
and I know that he even brought in draft copies when he was here
in Moscow. He went to London, and I believe he works in a Minis- i
try. I think it is in the office of the First Lord of the Admir- i
alty. He still meets with our case officer even now. He brings :
them extremely valuable material. He is either a deputy or a ‘
First Secretary, or a member of the secretariat; the most im— i
portant thing being that all material of the greatest signifi- L.

‘““ fant value passes through his hands. He was recruited in 1956 :
or 1957. I don't know when he returned to London, but he was
working with the (KGB Legal)Resident there, who was at that

voc osy ws: time @ man whose name is Major General (N.B.) RODIN.*** RODIN
*~ BLAKE, a British MI-6 officer, has admitted that he informed
the KGB of the Berlin tunnel operation (which involved the i aan
intercept of Soviet and East. German telephone ‘conversations 7 eg
by CIA and MI-6) prior to the time the operation became j EF
active in May 1955; it was terminated in April 1956. : :
** In September 1964 CIA sought more details from NOSENKO about _ cost
BLAKE, He responded: “BLAKE? Who is BLAKE?" When reminded,
NOSENKO sai “I don't know what kind of information he
(BLAKE) gave. I think he gave information, but I don't know
what ki or how mich. This is a mistake on what I supposedly
said before." For a further discussion. of BLAKE, See Part
7 V.D.7.b.

also received an Order of Lenin for his participation in’ the case,

but this was for the obtaining of valuable documents and not be-

cause of any involvement in the agent's recruitment. RODIN was
personally. in contact with the agent in London... I don't know
what position he (the agent) held in Moscow. I don't want to

tell you anything I don't know. Remember, this was handled by

enother section ard I could not very well ask them. You see, it's
none of my business. He gave us everything on military and polit-
ical matters. I found out (about this agent) from my friend (V.A.)
CHURANOV. He was involved in the recruitment personally. He is
in Moscow now, He returned about .a year ago from CopenKagen. He

was there as the (KGB Legal) Resident, under the cover of. First
Secretary. Prior to that he was the Chief of a section in the
English Department of the Second Chief Directorate. That was
about three years ago, and at that time he personally recruited
the Englishman.” :

NOSENKO told “CIA on 13 June 1962 that the “high-level

British agent" had on one occasion provided a report on an Anglo-

American and British Intelligence operations.* Durint inal
meeting in 1962, a day later, NOSENKO again stated that RODIN
had received the Order of Lenin for his part in the operation.
When asked whether the name KOROVIN meant anything to him in
connection with operations against the British, he replied
have heard that name, but I cannot associate it in any way.
Possibly he is the man in London now."**

I

After recontacting CIA in 1964, NOSENKO reported that he
had alreacy provided almost all he knew about VASSALL, who had
been arrested in 1962. VASSALL, NOSENKO summarized, was re-
cruited in Moscow and turned over copies of official Embassy
documents while there. After he returned to England and while
he was working in the Admiralty, he was considered to be the
KGB's best agent. His value, NOSENKO said, was indicated by
the fact that CHURANOV had received a KGB award for his role
in the recruitment and then later, when VASSALL was producing
in England, the Order of Lenin along with RODIN, the handling
officer in London,***

* “NOSENKO on 1 February 1964 said: "In general it was known
from some source important information was coming in from
the British, specifically, information about NATO, As soon
as the NATO Intelligence Services would hold a meeting in
London, we had the information as to what was discussed.
When the American, Canadian, and British groups met in
London. The material came in from that VASSALL, or from
someone else--I don't know." On 8 September 1964 NOSENKO
commented further that in 1960 or 1961, about the same time
he heard about these materials, he also learned that the
KGB First Chief Directorate had a good source’ in British
counterintelligence. NOSENKO said that he did not know
whether VASSALL had access to this type of information or
whether this. indicated another source. :

** NOSENKO was asked on 29 January 1964 whether RODIN, -VASSALL's
handler in London, was also known as KOROVIN, He replied he
thought so.

***Questioned on CHURANOV's reaction to VASSALL's arrest, NOS-
ENKO stated on 29 January 1964 that CHURANOV had said: “Well,
this is all. This is the end of my career and I'll never
abroad again." Shortly afterwards, CHURANOV went to GRIBANOV

NOSENKO added a few details concerning the compromise of
VASSALL. The KGS, he said, had evidence of homosexual acts
between VASSALL and one homosexual, but then the K35 menaged to
acquire photographs of him involved with three homosexuals at the
sane time. NCSENKO was unable to recal] the names of two of them,
whose KGB cryptonyms were "MUKHIN" and "SIBIRYAK" (the latter a
young scientist and the only one of the three who could speak
English); the third wes Viktor BELYANOVSA!¥,.aa actor. in SCOW
who also took part i erican citizen
Martin MALIA and CHURANOV told NOS-
ENKO that VASSALL was and became sick when he
saw the photographs.

NOSENKO told CIA on 24 January 1964 that he hed been very
worried in 1963 when it was reported in an article by Joseph
ALSOP thet VASSALL had heen apprenended by the British as the
result of a lead from the Americans. "I remember," NOSENKO said,
“the press stated thet there was a defector who was a diplomat
and who was about to come to England fro: the States and that he
was instrumental in heving unearthed this Soviet spy, at a high-
levei place. whose name was VASSALL,* The First Chief Director-
ete was in an uproar wnen they read this ALSOP article Asa
matter of fact, at the KG conference 1 insisted that our recent
flaps were a result of information from COLITSYN, particularly
(on) YASSALL. When they asked me now I knew, 1 said we have
recorés here that he was given VASSALL's material to read in
connection with his own work."

NOSENKO suid on @ September 1964 that his fears that the
articles in the Western press might eventually bring him under
suspicion were allayed when ke learned from CHURMWIOV some time
later that the First Chief Directorate had reluctantly decided
that GOLITSYN must have been the source to the VASSALL lead. The
leaders of the First Chief Directorate did not want to believe
at first that GOLITSYN was the source of the lead, but it was
known that although GOLITSYN did not know VASSALL's name, he had
on one or two occasions translated materials received from
VASSALL.

(ii) Information from G¢

TSYN

On 26 March 1962 GOLITSYN was being interviewed by British
authorities and provided information leading to the identifica-
tion of VASSA#LL as a KGB agent. GOLITSYN said that he worked
in the International Treaty Organizations Section of the Infor-
mation (Reports) Department “of the KGB First Chief Directorate,
from September 1959 until May 1960. During this period he re-
ceived documents from the British Admiralty which were copies
of papers from top Admiralty officials concerning the construc-
tion and financial expenditures relating to a naval base at
Clyde, dated July 1959. On the basis of many of these docu-
ments GOLITSYN had to prepare a report for the Soviet Minister
of Defense. He said that he ‘was told that the British Depart-
ment of the First Chief Directorate had also disseminated such
information, and after contacting the Pritish Department he was
given a large file of copies of original documents from British
Admiralty, including documents of the First and Second Lords of
the Admiralty, (The documents he read were Russian translations
of copies of original British documents.) There were other

documents covering all Admiralty activity mentioning navy bases,
fleet commands in the Mediterranean, Aden and cther cities in i
the Mediterranean area. There were also docusents dealing with a
pases in England and concerning important questions and deci-

sions in the Admiralty.

usually received at two-month intervals. He related that he had
talked in 1955 to a KGB officer friend, Ye. G. KASHCHEYSV,* who
‘was recalled to the USSR in 1954 from London. . KASHCHEYEV told
GOLITSYN that at that period KGB had two other important agents,
one of whom was BLAXZ, ‘The other important source was working
in naval intellicence in 1954, but GGIITSYN said he @id not know

because that officer received the Order of Lenin for. his work in
England at about that time.

During a 5 April 1961 interview GOLITSY% was show a selec-
tion of documents concerning the British Naval Command Organiza-
tion in the Mediterranean. He selected two documents he thought
he had seen before, although he said he was not sure. These
documents were: (a) Internal Admiralty Memorandum, Subject: A
“Commar.d in the Mediterranean," dated 2 July 1959; and (b) inter-
nal Admiralty documents, Subject: "Unified Headquarters for the ! :
Middle East," dated 22 January 1960. i 1

When GOLITSYN was shown additional British documents on
7 April 1962, he recalled he had seen documerts concerning "the i a
whole infrastructure program, the whole of NATO." as well as | 7
documents concerning notes of meetings held in the Admiralty.

GOLITSYN said on 25 May 1962 that the photographic repro-
ductions of the documents were of medium or better quality, in-
dicating they had been reproduced by a process better than hand-
held Minox camera production.

By 12 September 1962 British authorities had focused
sufficiently on VASSALL to arrest him. VASSALL immediately
confessed.

(iii) Information from VASSALL

On the day of his arrest, 12 September 1962, VASSALL con-
fessed that he had spied for the Soviets almost continuously since i]
the spring of 1955." (A search of his quarters immediately after
his arrest resulted in the discovery of 15 rolls of exposed film
which, when developed, revealed 140 pho-ographs of pages from 17
official Admiralty documents dated betweer. 24 July and 3 September
1962; all were reported to be secret documents, "the exposure of
which would cravely damage the security of the state.") In his
confession, VASSALL describ: his recruitment py CHURANOY and
another man, Known only as “Nikolay” in March 1955 on thé basis
of compromising photographs taken during the course of a “homo-
sexual orgy" involving himself and a number of Soviets. at the
Berlin Hotel in Moscow at the end of October 1954. From about
September 1955 on until he returned -to England, VASSALL bought
KGB silence by bringing CHURNOV and “Nikolay” documents from
the British Embassy. In May i956, in anticipation of his depar-
ture for home, VASSALL was introduced to a third Soviet, subse-
quently identified as RODIN/KOROVIN, who was to become his con-
tact in London. Their first meeting in England took place about ' ‘
the end of August 1956. VASSALL continued to meet RODIN once 1
every three weeks until the arrest of Soviet Illegal Gordon LONS- . 1
DALE in January 1961, which resu’ed in a four month moratorium : 4
i
q

on persenel meetings. To these meetings VASSALL would bring docu- i
ments that he obtained from his office in the Naval Intelligence j
Division of the Admiralty; the documents would be photographed .
and returned to VASSALL during the saze meeting.

Several months after RODIN had broken off contact as a re-
sult of the LONSDAL! arrest, VASSALL was contacted by N.P, KAR-
PEKOV**and there were infrequent meetings from then until May
1962. It was not until May 1962, however, that VASSALL was told
to resume his espionage collection; he was trained to operate an
Exakta camera and used it thereafter il his arrest. The last
two meetings with KARPEKOV took place on 13 and 17 August 1962.
At the meeting on 13 August, KARPEKOV told VASSALL that he was
going away on holiday and the further meeting four days later
was arranged so that VASSALL could hand over anything he had
obtained before KARFEKOV left. At their final meeting, KARPEKOV
arranged for their next meeting to take place on 30 October 1962.
(KARPEKOV left London for the Soviet Union on 6 September 1962.)

By VASSALL's account, the first time he received any money
from the Soviets was just before Christmas 1955, when he was
given "at least 1,000 rubles." Thereafter, at every fourth: © - °°

pounds, an estimate which the British consider “modest, to say
the least” judging from VASSALL's luxurious way of life.

ROSENKO was asked why this nédian was considered to be
an Illegal rather than an agent. Reeffirming that he was an Il-
legal, NOSENKO explained that “an agent always has legal status.
This man may run an lilegal net. And they may give him money
to support other Illegals, and therefore that is the category
assigned to him." The CIA case officer sumsed up this new infor-
mation by say. Terefore, in addition to the classic type cf
Illegal who is a Soviet citizen and wno is trained for a long
time and then goes to a foreign country to develop his legend

who would be called Illegals if they are membe: of a Soviet

The BELITSKIY Operation

Introduction

Wnen NCSENKO first contacted CIA in June 1962, one of the
two. pieces of information which he said he was willing to sell
was the fact that the CIA agent BELITSKIY was -nder KCB control.
(B.Ye. BELITSKIY, a Radio Moscow broadcaster and Soviet Govern-
ment interpreter, had been a CIA agent in place since his recruit~
ment at the Erussels Exposition in September 1958.) At the time
NOSENKO made his information known, BELITSKIY hed met CIA repre-
sentatives in the West in debriefing sessions on three separate
occasions. The last occurred in Geneva in May 1962 while BELIT-
"SKIY was serving as an interpreter for a WiO Conference. At that
time NOSENKO was also in Geneva, participating in the Disarmament
Conference.

b. Information from N

(i)

aistd ultemeadial

In the discussions with CIA officers on 9 ard 11 June 192,
NOSENKO revealed considerable informetion on BELITSXIY, He also
described his own connection with the case and offered his opinion
.on how CIA should proceed in the light of his revelations. He
claimed that he had first heard of the RELITSKIY case, by its
code name "BELKIN," when he was working in the U.S.Embassy Section
American Department, KGB Second Chief Directorate. Not directly
involved with the agent, he learned of the case through his friend-
ship with the chief of the section (name not given) which was then
running him.* "So I already knew there was this 'BELKIN,'" said
NOSENKO, He did not actively participate in the case, however,
until the spring of 1962. During his tour with the Disarmament
Conference, NOSEIKO said, he received a cable from Moscow direct-
ing him to give advice to the “young” and "inexperienced" case
officer, V.L. ARTEMYEV in thé event ‘that ‘American’ Intelligence
should contact BELITSKIY in Geneva. Actually, NOSENKO continued,
the Second Chief Directorate had “inserted" BELITSKIY ‘into the
WHO delegation in the hope that CIA would ."find him." There was
such a contact, NOSENKO said, and therefore he knew about the
handling of .the case insofar as the Geneva meetings were con-
cerned, although he had not been personally involved in it be-
fore.

NOSENKO described 3ELITSKIY as a KGB agent whom the Americans
_ had recruited in London and never met inside the Soviet Union. 7
NOSENKO stressed both of these. points a number of times: "So I sod
knew that in due course he was recruited in London...’ There was
never any contact with him inside." NOSENKO stated that BELIT-
SKIY was an agent of the American Department in 1962, although
he. had once worked for the Second (British) Department. He

* NOSENKO said that at that time he himself was Deputy Chief of
the U.S,Embassy Section. It follows from this that he would
have become aware of the BELITSKIY case between January 1960 ’
and January 1962, In 1964 NOSENKO identified the friend who ity
had told him about BELITSKIY as V.I. PETROV, Chief of the i 4
Second Section, American Department, responsible for pene-. :
be babe American Intelligence operations, mainly those in
the USSR. : >

claimed not to know the date of recruitment but seid that he
knew that the case was already 1n progress during his second
assignment with the U.S. Embassy Section (January 19€9-January
1962), and "The first time he went abroad he was already our
agent. He had been our agent for a long, long time..."

NOSENKO indicated that the KGB's purpose in running the
BELITSKIY operation was to lure American Intelligence into meet-
ing with the agent inside the Soviet Union. In this way, the

“KGB hoped to learn the channels and means through which Anerican

Intelligence communicated with agents inside the Soviet Union.
This, said NOS O, was the “most important task" of the Second
Chief Directorate. Although BELITSKIY, ir, meeting with his An-
erican case officers, continually pleaded fear of contacting or
being contacted by American Intelligence in Moscow, NOSENKO
claimed that this was a ruse end that the real KGB intent was to
use BELITSKIY “to craw you to us - to the Soviet Union - so that
you would work with him net abroad." He said that after BELIT-
SKIY was recruited in Lenton, CIA "did not go on with him...
didn t hold‘any mect with him." Nevertheless, he said; the
KGB “cherished the hope...to lead him in somewhat dceper...well,
now they have.“

NOSENKO commented that the KGB First Chief Directorate,
with its*own r nsibilities and objectives, was unaware of the
purpose of the Second Chief Directorate in the BELITSXIY case.
The First Chief Directorate, through Department D, provided
dezinformatsiya (disinformation, referred to by NOSEYKO as
“g@eza") at the Second Chief Directorate's request, but in this
case, as in other "games," it did not know for what ultimate
purpose the "ceza" would be used. NOSENKO indicated that in
such cases I.1. AGAYANTS, Chief of Department D, did not even
know in what country the disinformation was to be used, let alone
the identity of the agent. The Second Chief Directorate, more-
over, was at liberty to add or discard items from the "deza" pro-
vided by Department D.*

NOSENKO stated that after the directive from Moscow arrived,
he participated in the direction of BELITSKIY's meetings with
the American case officers, advising ARTEMYEV on specific steps
to be taken. For example. NOSENKO said, when the American case
officers asked BELITSKIY whether he could establish contact
with some Soviet on the Disarmament Delegation, NOSENKO advised
ARTEMYEV not to use anyone from the Soviet Ministry of Foreign
Affairs. Rather, he told ARTEMYEV that BELITSKIY should pretend

—_—__—

* While on this ceneral subject, NOSENKO commented that the
Second Chief Directorate was looking to the.day when its: offi-

Legal Resident was “weak" and "over-cautious." According to
NOSENKO, this man had keen ordered by Moscow to help in the
BELITSKIY case "if anything is needed” but tried.to interfere
with the actual running of the case. At that, point, NOSENKO.

that he was gettirg information fron the heed of the Acerican
Department of TASS, A.K. KISLOV, who was then in Geneva.* The
information BELITSK:Y furnished to the Arericans would, of
course, be "deza" from the KGB. This plen was carried out, and
BELITSKIY reported information “‘frcm KISLOV" to his Anerican case
officers. To backstop this part of the operation, in case the
Americans “checked up," NOSENKO and ARTEMYEV arranged for BELIT-
SKIY to be introduced to KISLOV, :

According to NOSENKO, Departivent D prepared ‘Other disinfor-
mation for BELITSKIY to give to his American case officers in
response to their positive intelligence requirements. The Second
Chief Directorate asked Lepartment D to “make it good information,
so the opposition will not sense that it is “deza. ** "Moscow is
happy, " NOSENKO reported, ‘because KGB Headquarters believed that
CIA had accepted “at face value" the information which BELITSKIY
gave. Among these pieces of disinformation, NOSENKO said, was
the name of a Soviet Intelligence officer in the WHO in Geneva.

Concerning the individuals involved in this case, NOSENKO
related that BELITSKIY had been met in Geneva first by the An
ican case officer "B6b" and later also by “Henry" who was "calied
out from the States The KGB case officer, ARTEMYEV, was “still
@ young fellow,” althouch he had good potential, and had not
worked on the BELITSKIY case in Moscow. Ee had been sent to
Geneva to work on counterintellicence matters and to direct
PELITSKIY if the Americans should make contact with him.*** After
the WHO conference ended, NOSENKO said, the Sovist participants
left in groups; BELITSKIY departed on 26, 27, or 28 May but
ARTEMYEV stayed a few days longer.

According to NOSENKO, Moscow believed that CIA had accepted
BELITSKIY's bona fides. From the KGB standpoint, while BELiTSKIY
was "not a bad agent," he was apt to go a bit too far sometimes
and to "add things on his own." for this reason, NOSZNKO said,
the KGB decided not to let him spent too much time with CIA,
fearing that he might say something "which would cause you to
sense that he is a plant."

NOSENKO strongly and repeatedly advised CIA to “continue the
game" but under no circumstances to meet the agent inside the
Soviet Union. He indicated that he considered it "in your inter-
ests" to continue to play BELITSKIY, and he remarked that the
KGB. would guess how CIA found out about the case if it were

with KISLOV.

NOSENKO commerted, concerning disinformation in general and
speaking of this case in particular, that it is “very diffi-
cult" to-pass disinformation, and that there is a certain
“danger" ‘connected with passing it - in providing "that. which
is almost true, changed just a little bit," the agent might
give away something that is of real value to-the opposition.
There is also the danger of arousing suspicion:in the minds
of the opposition's case officers if the information is not
good enough, he implied.

terminated - he and ARTEMYEV were the only officers abroad who
knew about the operation. (At that very moment, he said, the ©
KGB was waiting for someone to arrive in Moscow and contact the
agent.}.. NOSENKO proposed 4 plan through which CIA coulda cause
the KGB to send BELITSKIY abroad again, and two days later he
again urged that this plan be edopted: CIA should choose an
elderly couple who were travelling to the USSR and give them a
letter to mail to BELITSKIY immedtately on their arrival; in the 7 j
letter there should be a Fint through which BELITSKIY (and -the acne . |

+ KGB) would realize that CIA wanted him to come otit and did not
plén to contact him inside; the KGB would then be forced to send
-BELITSKIY abroad again in order to continue the "game." This
reaction would be in line with the mission of the Second Chief
Directcrate "to recruit the foreigners... and then pass them on 7
to you for your recruitment. That ie our mission - give our own
Russians to you for recruitment and recruit foreigners..". NOSENKO 7
also continueds "Don't trust him for & second put... give the L
impression that you believe him." He stressed that the travellers ‘
chosen for this task ke "elderly," that they not pe connected with i
CIA in any way, end, most important, thet they mail the letter H
immediately on their arrival. NOSFNXO also advised CIA to do i
something about the safe apartment in which "Eob" and “Henry"
had met BELITSKIY. He complained that BELITSKIY had noted that H iH
the name on the door was not that of the American Counsellor i t
whose apartm it was supposed to be, and he said that BELITSKIY H 5
had also reported that he felt it had an “un-lived in" look. : H

(14) Statements in 1964 |

When he came to the West again in 1964, NOSENKO again dis-
cussed the BELITSK1Y case.* In January 1964, he was asked his
advice about CIA's handling BELITSKIY. Again he suggested that
CIA "continue the plan" in order.to determine “what actions they
will undertake when they will see that you do not plan to have
Moscow contacts." He commented: “You have a realistic basis
for not doing this in view of the PENKOVSKIY case, etc." **
Again he expressed the opinion that "what they are trying to do
in this case is to pull for a Moscow contact... Tne hope is
that you would go out to meetings with him in Moscow." The
Second Chief Directorate did not consider the BELITSKIY case a’
big operation: “it was only a small success from our viewpoint."

NOSENKO claimed, as he had in 1962, to have been personally
involved in directing the meetings BELITSKIY had had with the
Americans in Geneva, ARTEMYEV “was a very young man, There-
fore, a cable came from Moscow ordering me to take over the
direction of the case over ARTEMYEV... in. case a contact was
made, and it was." NOSENKO -ndicated that it was 0.M, GRIBANOV
himself, Chief of the Second Chief Directorate, who had ordered
him to take charge.

Vis nated be Led learned ainyt the cake originally “th VEO
or 196L" from PETRY, ef uf the Second Section of the American
Department. "J don't know when the case began, but it was coing
in 1960 and 1961," he said. In 1962, he obtained more details

from ARTEMYEV,. who was in the same Gelegation as SELITSKIY, and

“then the cable came from Moscow ordering him to help ARTEMYEV

‘in the case. NOSENKO said he did not know who recruited BELIT-

: SKIY for the KGS, but it was not PETROV, This operation, like
all "games" of the Second Section, was supervised by M.G, MATVEYEV,

: Deputy Chief of the American Department..

F In 1964 NOSENKO made a number of comments and observations

‘which he had not brought up in any way in 1962. In noting, for

‘example, that BELITSXiY had originally been a British Department
agent, he remarked: “Maybe they tried to serve him up to the
British, and maybe the British didn't bite." As for the charac-
ter of BELITSKIY and the KGB's view of their agent, on 29 Janu-
ary 1964 NOSE-XO stated: “If you were to stop it, then wait
until the appropriate moment, confront’ him, tell him the 'geme'
is up ~ you xnow all about him - then he might co for this and
you may recruit him." On 2 February 1964, when the CIA case
officer suggested that perhaps RELITSK1Y might mot have reported
everything to the KG3, especially the amount of money he had
been given by CIA, NOSENKU acreed that perhaps this was co "be-
cause I*was very much surprised how little money the Americans
gave BELITSKIY,.. I was convinceé that something was rot right,
and I told ARTEMYEV chat I didn't believe that the Americans
could pay such small sums. I was convinced that BELITSKIY only
reported that he received a small part of what he actually got."
NOSENKO said that when he told PETROV that he did not believe
BELITSKLIY, PETROV said he t.ad not quite accepted his reports
either, becauseevery time BELITSKIY came home from abroad, “he
always tries to hand me some gift and therefore I'm inclined
to agree with you." NOSENKO said that BELITSKIY had been
thoroughly investigated but that he himself felt that “it is
possible that at any given moment a person would change his
mind and go off." NOSENKO mentioned for the first time, on
10 June 1964, that the British Department had a file "in which
material had been placed which would indicate that there were
some suspicions” about BELITSKIY, but that “this ‘suspicious’
file was not given to the Second Section, American Department,
when they took over.”

c. Information from Other Sources

BELITSKIY was a chemist by training and a translator and
radio commentator by profession, At the time of his recruit-
ment, and throughout his relationship with CIA, he was employed
by Radio Moscow, Fluent in English, he was used primarily as
a scientific commentator on programs beamed to the British Isles.
In addition to his radio work, BELITSKIY frequently served as an
interpreter for the Soviet Government, both at home and abroad,
an@ achieved considerable recognition in this capacity during
such widely publicized events as the POWERS trial ‘and GAGARIN's
visit to England. Ostensibly he was fully trusted by the Soviet
authorities and was allowed an unusual degree of freedom in his
association with foreigners,

EELITSKIY was recruited by CIA in Brussels in September
1958 while he was serving as an interpreter at the Soviet Pavil-
ion of the World's Fair. During the iod in which he was being
assessed as 2 potential agent, BELIT ¥ created the impressions
that: first, he was not in full agreement with the current Sov-
iet regime and probably even harbored some grudge against the
Soviet system because his father had been purged under STALI
second, he was not averse to considering defection at some future
date, provided he could do so with his wife; and third, he was
eager to pick up extra money, in return for which he was willing
to provide information acquired in the course of his duties.

ag



In the two years prior to his recruitment, BELITSXIY had
on several occasions been rather outspoken during conversations
with certain desterners with whom he had come in contact. His
frankness concerning his disaffection with certain aspects of
Soviet life as they affected his career as iL
on several occasions (including an_enicade in wi
borrow money from a member of
eral years earlier), had convi'

that he was a provocation agent. In talking with
the CIA case officer who questioned him about this frar.kness,
BELITSKIY stated that he had been trying to make contact with
either British or American Intelligence “for the past three
years", but that he had "not been able to do so securely." He
added that he felt he had been “very careful" to whom he had
spoken frankl He said that he had “trusted” and had
felt that could "put him in touch with the proper persons."

The possibility of BELITSKIY's being a Soviet provocation
was thoroughly and frequently considered, both initially and
as the case progressed. In view of available evidence, com-
bined with the personal impressions of the CIA case officer who

indicated that BELITSKIY is
ut his personal affairs and does not

felt that BELITSKIY was sincere, it was judged at the time of
his recruizment that BELITSXIY, whatever his true motives, was”
not controlled ‘by the KG’. During the 11 hours of meetings in
Brussels, the case c cer observed, YELITSKIY “did not over-
sell himself," "claimed no military friends," “offered no oper-
ational leacs (even when requested)," “did not actempt to elicit
information," “refused AIS contact inside the Soviet Union,"
"did not use a single intelligence tem," and

wiet's expressed fear for his owh security Cineluding

1 refusal to contact American Intelligence inside the
USSK), and his apparent ignorance of intelligence terminolocy

and proféssional techniques, contributed to the initial judcment
that he was not under KGB control. ITSK1¥'s motivatiom appear-
ed to be a combination of factors, including revenge for the per-
gecution of his father, disaffection with the cppression by the
Soviet recime of Jews and intellectuals (he fell into both cate-
goriesjartie shortage of consumer goods for the average Soviet

with @merican Intelligence ITSKIY replied with the question:
"Did you read Dr. Zhivaco?" Although certain aspects of his
past behavicr were somewhat puzzling, none was actually incon-
sistent with, nor aroused any strong suspicion concerning, his
claims that he was acting entirely on his own initiative.

In April 1950 BELITSKIY was in London tut did not contact

“CIA. He later explained this in terms of his personal security

and also indicated that he thought CIA micht contact him. In
June 1950, CIA sent a summary of the operation to MI-6, request-
ing any assistarce it could provide and offering to share the
product of the operation. In August MI-6 gave CIA its view:
BELITSK1Y had come to London with a Soviet intelligence brief:
his attempts to contact Westerners were so blatant that the KGB
must have known about them; but it was possible that not all of
the agent's activities were necessarily controlled by the KGB.
in September 1960 CIA advised MI-6 of its agreement that BELIT-
SKIY "undoubtedly had an RIS mission when he came to the UK
earlier this year," adding the opinion that he probably had
been used in the past by the KGB; also, that the only way to
resolve the unexplained points, CIA stated; was to engage in a
secure interrogation which would include a polygraph examina-
tion. As of October 1960 the CIA position'on the case was

“As matters now stand we have our doubts

as to the bona fides of BELITSKIY, but are not convinced that
all his actions have been controlled by the RIS. We consider
him too valuable a potential source to drop without exploring
all possible avenues of investigation. Subject has acknow-
ledged access to high-level Soviet scientists and to informa-
tion of high priority interest."

In October 1960, BELITSKIY attended a World Journalists’

‘Rally in Vienna but, he explained later, had no. opportunity to

contact American Intelligence during his 10 day visit.

The next personal contact with the agent was made in
London in July 1961* when a series of meetings took place;

* PENKOVSKIY (see Part VI.D.7.b.) was also in London (on TDY
alone) in July 1961.

during two of these BELITSKIY wes given a polygraph test. He
was questioned closely (albeit in a friendly manner) about his
relationship with the KCL. He explained that he was frequently
in contact with persons whom he suspected to be KGS, both in
his work at Radio Moscow and particularly in connection with his
travels abrcead, but that his only official briefing by the KGB
was in connection with the POWERS trial. On another occasion,
he said, he was told how to handle himself if the “wrong” ques-
tions were asked at the MARTIN/MITCHELL press conference in
Moscow, but this was not openly a KGB briefing, HELITSKIY also
indicated that all travellers 1 ing the USSR were routinely

eyes open" to locate potential targets of information. He said Hy
he felt that “whatever he had teen eble to do along this line"

had resulted in his being given T0Y's abroad and having relative i
freedom of movement.

At the end of the London debriefings it wes concluded by
MI-6 and CIA that BELITSKIY “did noc appear to be practicing «
deception or to be controlled by the RIS." Both did agree, how~
ever, that he was “evasive when pressed, then glib, but without
volunteering information."* The majority view at that time was
that the agent's prime motivation was a financial one, coupled
with an assurance of CIA assistance upon his defection. It was }
also believed that BELITSKIY had by then become so deeply in-
volved with CIA that it would be very difficult for him to break ;
contact and/or to report his plight to the KGB. i

The third contact with BELITSKIY was made in Geneva in May
of 1962. The CIA case officer met the agent six times, for a
total of approximately 12 hours. At this series of debriefings
@ second American case officer was introduced. In his report on
the contact the original case officer stated that he felt
“stronger than ever that Subject's potential as an agent is
unlimited." He stated that his original views on BELITSKIY's
bona fides had not changed and that he felt the latter realized
that he had passed the point when he could afford to report his
collaborati with CIA to the KGB. The second case officer
reported that the reservations which he had had ebout the acent's
bona fides before the meetings with him had been dispelled by
the latter's manner. He also reported, however, that on two
occasions during the meetings he had had a "sinking feeling"
that "the relationship was not kosher." He said that during
the discussion of the two factions which BELITSKIY claimed 1
were then vying with each other in the Soviet Union (the 7
“moderates” vs. the "“hard-liners"), he had the feeling "that
the tale was concocted and maybe the agent was trying to convey

* Throughout the course of this operation various individuals
participating in it expressed doubts about BELITSKIY's bona
fides. Whatever doubts may have existed, however, they did
not affect the conduct of the case;.the general consensus was
that the agent was not controlled by the KGB, and the. case
continued to be run as if he were not. Moreover, the poly-
graph examiner reported that BELITSKIY had been “substan-
tially truthful in his answers to the questions asked," al-
though he did recommend that the agent be re-exsmined under
controlled conditions.



526.

to U.S, authorities something that someone wanted to have convey-

ed and could rot have done‘through normal mnels.“ The second
case officer was also struck, by a chance which he perceived in
BELITSKIY's manner when they:were discussing the matter of con-

tact inside the Soviet Union? At first, KELITSKIY was very con-
cerned, but toward the end of the meeting he seemed to abandon

all caution and to be quite happy about it, even suggesting that

a CIA courier could perhaps bring him some scarce goods. 5

Throughout the relationship, however, BELITSKIY exhibited
great concern for his personal safety. During the period between i
the initial and the second series of meetings, CIA sent him two H
open letters containing secret writing. He responded to the first
(in time to validate the terms of the contract). but not to the }
second, explaining in e later meeting that his failure to do so 1
had been due to fear for his own safety. His reasons for this
fear (including the fact that the handwriting on the open letter
was “typically American"), were judged plausible and convincing,
and his desire to discontinue this type of communication was
respected. although BELITSK1Y did not wish to communicate by
secret writing, he did later agree that "in a matter of gravest é
importance" he would permit CIA to send him a message via some- a
one with whom he could be, logically, in proféssional or social
contact. He stipulated, however, that it be someone who was
entirely "clean" and completely unwitting of the true nature of 4
his relationship with CIA. He i sted, moreover, on a guaran- ! q
tee that if CIA ever did have to communicate with him by any :
means, it should never refer to the sudject of a previous
conversation, He felt that under such circumstances he would
stand a better chance of refuting any accusations, since there
would be no evidence that he had responded to the o
American Intelligence. BELITSKIY also expressed concern on sev-
eral occasions for the case officers' welfare as it related to
his own, cautioning them, for instance, never to go to Berlin
or to Moscow.

BELITSKIY was deemed from the first to have access through
his work to information of unusual value to the United States
on the Soviet political scene, scientific personalities, and
science-related events. In addition, it was hoped that through
various relatives, friends, or acquaintances. he would be able
to provide some information on certain other high-priority re-
quirements. During each of the series of debriefings he was
able to furnish some general information on Soviet political
factions and currents, on many scientific and governmental
personalities, and on missile and space-related events. This
information was in general, however, either not of great value,
already known, or impossible to evaluate or corroborate. Never-
theless, the case officer felt that the agent had "no way of
measuring the usefulness of any particular piece of informa-
tion" and that he was "going out of his way to provide us with
everything he thought might be of possible use."

BELITSKIY was not able to. answer specific requirements
in the highest priority fields of missiles ard atomic energy.
However, as he himself stressed, he did not have direct access
to classified documents, and CIA had not expected that he
would be successful in these areas. On the other hand, he _
did appear to have access to some military information of a
classified nature through his status in the military reserves.
Although previously, he said, he had not been interested or

Before any henetit from thi S aspect of his life could be reeped,
his reserve status was charged to ‘limited aveilabilizy” and he
was no longer expected to attend reetings.

On the other hand, EELITSKIY was successful in cultivating
a number of individuals whe were potentially valuable sources of
information to him on priority ta:cet areas One of these. for
example, was a cousin who aliegedly was chic engineer in a
plant concerned with nuclear submar in Furthermore, the type
of information which BELITSKIY was reporting indicated that, in
the course of his work and through cuitivation and extension of
his broad range of acquaintances, ke should be able in the future
to provide CIA with extremely information.’ He was able,
for example, to report thes: which were censored from his
scientific program 5 s wse of there security impli-
cations. He also occasionally re ved interesting news in ad-
vance of its publication. He hi learned of the ouster of the
Americar diplomat, Kermit S. MID? ‘some time before it was
officially announced. in October 1952. He aiso had knowledge of
the attitudes and activities of certain non-Soviets in Moscow
who were of interest to CIA, sucn as Francis Gary POWERS, and
was acquainted with several Westerners who had defected to the
USSR. Also, BELIWSKIY remarked that he had once known someone
who had lived in the house of “the real Rudolf A8FL," this
friend had told him that Rudolf Ivanov. ABEL, the KG2 Illegal
arrested in the United States the adentity
of the reai ABEL, who nae died.

With regard to certain specifics assignments which he failed
to carry out, RELITSKIY invariably off d expianations for his
inability to do so (usually relating fear for his personal se-
curity) which were difficult to regacd as unreasonable. One
example was his decision ‘at the Last minute~ not to kring to
CIA the Radio Moscow telephone book which he had been asked to
get. He “had it in his hand while ps.king." he said, but felt
that “hecause of a current réorganization at the Radio" the
information would be “outdated” by the time CIA got it and that
therefore he did not think it worth tisking 1ts being found if
his baggage should be inspected.

Evaluations of BELITSKIY's behavior, attitudes and apparent
motivation, and production were continually made in the course
of the case. Although there was a definite feeling that he had
not been frank about the full extent of his relationship with
the KGB, neither the results of the polygraph examination, the
conclusions of a graphological analysis, nor the judcments of
the two individuals who had contacted him personally during
the three series of debriefings tended to contradict these con-
clusions directly.

Moreover, as the case progressed, it appeared that his
reputation within the Soviet Union was growing and that his
usefulness to CIA was increasing correspondingly. His personal
contacts and potential sources of information. became more nu-
merous as his job responsibilities increased. The trust which
his superiors placed in him seemed to be borne out by the

freedom he was allowed. It appeared that there was a good
chance he would be permitted to exit the Soviet Union from time
to time and would therefore be able to get informatior to us
despite his reluctance to communicate fron within, He was thus
consieered, on the whole, to be a-nighly useful potential, if
not actual, source of positive intelligence information who was
basically motivated to help American Intelligence.

After the NOSENKO information was received in June 1962,
CIA continued the BELITSKIY operation. A fourth series of meet-
ings was held with the agent in the United States in October of
1962, .BELITSKIY was at that time accompanying a Soviet celega-
tion to "The Second Informal Conference of Influential Ameri-
cans and Soviets"(at Andover, Mzssachusetts), a gathering of
prominent Soviet and American citizens to discuss international i
problems in the interests of world peace.* ‘The Soviet deleca- j
tion of 16 was headed by a member of the CPSU Central Committee, 7
who was listed as a representative of the Soviet Trade Union i
Press. The conference occurred during the Cuban crisis, 21 to H
27 Ocrober 1962.** F

During this extremely critical period in Soviet-American
relations, BELITSKIY comaunicated the following points to his
CIA case officers:

- The members of the delegation had been briefed in :
Moscow by the First Deputy Foreign Minister to be concilia-
tory, even to the degree of pointing out that the Soviet
Union disagrees with China on the distribution of nuclear
weapons to other powers, and to avoid any position which
could be regarded as offensive to the Americen partici-
pants.

|

- BELITSKIY “personally” regarded President KENNEDY's i

announcement of a "blockade" of Cuba as appalling. He |

stated that he was convinced that Cuba could have been

weaned from the Soviet Union by very careful handling |

without alienating opinion in other countries, and that
the President's action tended to strengthen the position
of the "hard line, tough talk" faction in the Soviet
Government. Immediately following the President's an-
nouncement, the delegation was instructed to make the
Soviet position plain, but to do so in a moderate tone.

- The leader of the Soviet delegation had partici-
pated in a discussion with Norman COUSINS, of The
Saturday Review, who explained to him the reasons for

the President's stand on Cuba, “According to BELITSKIY,
who had acted as interpreter, the Soviers' reply to
COUSINS was that the USSR had réfused to give nuclear
weapons to China ard that there would re no point in
risking en affront to Communist .Chira by giving advanced
weapons to Cuba. He said the Soviet Union was willing
to enter into negotiations with the United States on the
question of the spread of nuclear weapons co other

Stand was that he was pressured by the coming election
and the need to circumvent criticisz oy the Republican
Party: by Congressional leaders; and by a report that

Except for once sailing abroad on a Soviet cruise ship,
BELITSKIY has not been seen in the West since nis October 1962
visit to the United States. His voice, however, has been heard
frequently in broadcasts from Radio Moscow sin.e that time.

Among BELITSKIY's broadcasts wes a two-part series of 22 November
and 2 December 1965, reamed to the United Kincdom and to eastern
North America, calied ‘Inquest Into the, Facts’ surrounding the
publication of The Penkovskiy Papers. ,

a. Conpromis
(4) Introducti

Twice during the first meeting with ClA in Geneva in June
1962 NOSENKO alluded to the compromise of the CIA agent penetra-

(ii) CIA Operation with Poroy

After 32 months of contacts «ith CIA while he was stationed
in Austria, PCPOV was transferred in September 1955 to East Ger-
many to become a case otricer at the GRU (tactical) intelligence
point in Schwerin, and contacts with CIA were resumed in January
1956. ‘The GRU reassigned POPOV on 28 June 1957 to the Inspection
Directorate, a stratecic intelligence element in Berlin/Karlshorst,
where he handled some of the lilcgais being dispatched from, re-
turning to, and training in East Perlin. There he remained in
contact with CIA until his recall te Moscow in November 1958 (see
below). Meanwhile:

- During July and until 13 August 1957 POPOV handled
. a total of five Illegals passing through East Berlin and
was made responsible for a sixth Illegal in training there.
He was relieved of the latter responsibility on 2 November
1957.

- The next and last Illegal to be assigned to POPOV,
in early October 1967, was a woman whose true identity is.
believed to be M.N, TAIROVA. She was destined to join
her husband, I.A. TAIROV, in the United States. Before

against Yugoslav targets, ZHUKOV was personally known to
POPGV. On 23 November 1957 POPOV said: “Can you imagine
whom I ran into in Karlshorst two or three times? It was
my competitor on Yugoslav operations when I was in Vienna.
Do you remember ZHUKOV of the KGB?... He may be assigned
here or /may te/ on TDY, but he has just come recently.
(A year later POPOV reported that ZHUKOV was still in
Berlin/Karlshorst working, he believed, in Anglo-American
operations.) It would thus appear that: the KGB sent

In January 1964 NOSENKO gave a detailed account of the compro~
mise of GRU Colunel O.V. PENKOVSKIY, the CIA and British Inteili
gence (M4I-6) penetration agent whose arrest by the KG was.
announced on 2 vember 1962. In «subsequent cebriefings and) in-
terrogations NOSFNKO has offered further information on certain
aspects of the PENKOVSKIY compromise, continuing to maintain that
it was brought about by KGB surveillance in Moscow during 1962.
Also according to NOSEUKO, it was not until the latter stages of
the operation that the KGB realized American Intelligence was
involved with MI-6 in this operation.

The reports by NOSENKO and other sources on the PENKOVSKIY
compromise are presented below, but to place them in context,
they are preceedec by a brief summary of the FENKOVSKIY operation
from the CIA and MI-6 standpoint.

(ii) Resume of the PENYOVSKIY Operation

In August 1966 PENKOVSKIY gave two American tourists a pack-
age of materials to deliver to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. These
materials included a description of a proposed dead drop site at
Mumber 2 Pushkin Street, which PENAOVSKIY had selected for a pos~
sible communication channel; in the letter PENKOVSKIY enclosed in j
the package, he also gave his home telephone number and instructions uy i
for a 2all to be placed to him at a certain time to indicate that : iH
tne package had been received and that the Americans were interested i :
in further contact with him. Efforts to make this telephone con-
tact with PENKOVSKIY failed, as did several additional efforts on i
his part to establish contact with the U.S. Embassy. The Pushkin i
Street address was checked from the outside on two occasions there-
after by
who walked past the_buiiding cn 12 November and 4 December 1950.
On 21 January 19€1 went inside the building and checked
the precise location of the dead drop site, behind the radiator
in the vestibule of this building. (On 30 December 1961, John
ABIDIAN, U.S. Embassy Security Officer and coopted CIA worker,
also went inside the building to check for possible ioading ef the
dead drop by PENKOVSKIY.) In April 1961, PENKOVSKIY succeeded in
making contact in Moscow with the British businessxan, Greville
WYNNE, with whom he was already acquainted from previous trips to ©
Moscow by WYNNE. Through WYNNE, PENKOVSKIY passed to MI-6 docu~
ments and notice of his forthcoming trip to London in April. MI-5
promptly netified CIA, and the two services jointly conducted the
operation until it was terminated by the KGB on 2 November 1962.

Throughout this period PENKOVSKIY served in a GRU element
under cover of the State Committee for Science and Technology
(GKKNR) in Moscow, and it was under GKKNR cover that PENKOVSKIY
travelled abroad three times, to England in April-May and July—

* August 1961 and to France in September-October 1961. In addition

to PENKOVSKIY's personal meetings with American and British case* 4
officers while on these TDY'’s, there were 27 exchanges of

materials in Moscow. The CIA and MI-6 intermediaries used for

these exchanges were WYNNE, on his business trips to the. USSR; Mrs.

Anne CHISHOLM, wife of an MI-6 officer stationed at the British

Embassy;* | - . fic : :

(b) Reports cn the Compromi

hen esked in January i964 whether he knew how PENKGVSKIY
was compromised, NOSENKO answered that he had "all the details”
and then gave the following account:

Ever since the POPOV case (see Part VI.D.7.a.) there
had keen intensive surveillance of personnel from the U.S,
and British Embassies in Moscow, As a result of this sur-
veillance, Mrs. IISHOLM was seen ducking into an alcove,
evidently following a Soviet citizen whom the surveillance
team was unable to identify. Surveillar coverage of
Mrs. CHISHOLM - and, indeed, on all British Embassy per-
sonnel - was immediately increased, and she was soon
observed following the same Soviet citizen on the street
in a clandestine manner. The Soviet citizen was identi-
fied as PENKOVSKIY.

The KGB imnediately launched a full investigation
of PENKOVSKIY, including a complete check of his back-
ground. To avoid alerting him, knowledge of the investi-
gation was kept to a minimum, and surveillance of him was
restricted to stationary points in the neighborhood of
his residence and office. As one part of the investiga-
tion, a man who closely resembled PENKOVSKIY and dressed
like him was made to walk in front of Mrs. CHISHOLM when
she was on a Moscow street; when she began to follow
this man, the KGB thus obtained confirmation of its
identification of PENKOVSK1Y. Another part of the in-
vestigation entailed a search of the PENKOVSKIY apartment;
to uccomplish this, he was given a drug which made hin
so ill that hospitelization was necessary; and. Mrs. z
PENKOVSKIY was lured from the apartsient on a ruse; nothing
was fourd during this search. The KGB next aimed a power-
ful telescope at the window in PENKOVSKIY's apartment and
obtained an apartment directly above his; fromithe over-
hanging balcony of the apartment occupied by the KGB some

oe SE tei



flower pots were suspended, one of them able to take
pictures through the window of the epartment below; in
this manner the KGS photographed PENKOVSKIY removing
“suspicious materials" from the back part of his desk;
in the search of the apartment which’ followed, these
materials were found in the desk, rut the KGB left them

there.

By the time WANE visited Moscow in July 1962, both
he and PENKOVSKIY were under surveillance, and their sus-
picious behavior in front of the Fexing Restaurant on
5 July gave the KGH another conclusive indicator of PENKOV-
SKIY's activities. Also, the KGB was eble to monitor
conversations between PENKOVSKIY and WYNNE in the latter's
hotel room, despite the fact that PENKOVSKIY turned on
water faucets whiie they were talking.

PENKOVSKIY was errested only when the KGB knew that
WYNNE was scheduled to go to a Satellite country. PENKOV-
SKIY gave a complete confession, and it was only at this H
point that the KGE realized American Intelligence was in-
volved in the operation. After P OVSKIY revealed details
about the Pusnxin Street deai drop, the KG2 correlated this
information with that contained in the surveillance report
of ABIDIAN's presence at the spot.* Nevertheless, in

"arranging a trap at Pushkin Street on z November 1962, the
KGB expected the dead drop to be serviced by someone from

Embassy. instead, JACOB |

was apprehended there. SaaaaeaeE i

The KGB felt that it had obtained all pertinent in- |
formation from PENKOVSKIY and that he was “beyond redemp- i

tion" even for future interrogetion. PENKOVSKIY was
executed.

In subsequent questioning soon after his defection, NOSENKO
repeatedly claimed that the KGB jhad no prior knowledge of 4merican
Intelligence participation in the PENKOVSKIY operation until
JACOB's arrest on 2 November 1962 at the Pushkin Street dead drop. ‘ ced

NOSENKO was asked in July 1964 for details on the KGB
official report (obzor) about the PENKOVSKIY case. He said that
he had never read the report because, although printed, it had
not been circulated as of the time of his departure for Geneva
in January 1964, By O.M. GRIBANOV (Chief of the KGB Second Chief
Directorate) and "various other case officers," however, NOSENKO :
was told of certain of the items which would appear in the KGB i
‘official report and most of which he had already reported. The
fact that the KGB surveillance team had failed to identify
PENKOVSKIY at his first observed meeting with Mrs. _ CHISHOLM,
NOSENKO added at this time, would not be included in the report.
According to GRIBANOV, whereas the report would state the KGB
knew PENKOVSKIY was working for both the British and American
services, in reality the KGB did’not know of the Americans'
involvement until PENKOVSKIY was arrested. With regard to this
latter point, NOSENKO said that the KGB investigation of PENKOV-
SKIY was handled by officers fromthe British Department: rather : “
than the American Department of the KGB Second Chief Directorate, . .

except for V.M. XOVSHUK of the latter depart Furthermore,

NOSENKO stated, the KGB interrogators attempted to force JACOB
to admit he was 4 British citizen.*

In Februzry 1965 NOSENKO provided his most.complete zccount }
of the PENKOVSK1Y compromise and the KGS investigation which ;
ensued: :

“The first that PESKOVSKIY appeared in life of the
KGB was during one of WYNNE's visits to »
knew of PENKOVSKIY's acquaintance with AYNNE and that he
was even visiting him in the hotel where WYNNE was staying.
The KGS checked with the GRU, and the GRU answered that
PENKOVSKIY was working on WYNNE as a target. PENKOVSKIY
was working in the GXKNR as a cover, and dYNNE was one of
his acquaintances. Later, there was massive surveillance
of the employees of the British Embassy - I don't know
exactly with whom - but P&IKOVSKLY was noticed being in
contact with someone from the British Embassy. but sur-
veillance lost him... Later he was nouiced with the wife
of British Embassy officer CHISHCLM. At this point, the
¥GB didn't tell the GRU anything, because the GRU had no
right to have any contact with any foreign embassy people
without telling the KCB - except at official receptions
and functions, and éven here they have to tell the KGB
so that surveillance will know. And when surveillance
noticed PENKOVSKIY with Mrs. CHISHOLM, they immediately
recognized him as the cuy they had lost.

"This was the beginning of the very active work on
PENKCVSKIY - without telling the GRU. They (the British
Department, KGB Second Chief Directcrate) were checking
his work at the GKKNR, They managed with the help of
the KGB Third Directorez«**to leok at his file. And
they tried ta control him at home. They were afraid to
put him under regular surveillance because he would
immediately find out - he was a capable officer - but
they put surveillance on him from time to time. However,
they set up a closed (fixed surveillance) post in a
building opposite his apartment, about 200 meters away.
They got a flat there, set up a post, and watched his
window with a telescope. They also used the flat directly
above PEXKOVSKIY's flat. Here they even put microphones
to hear his conversations with his wife and tapped the
telephone of course. Then they noticed that he was hiding
something in his desk, taking the drawer out and putting

:/* Something behind, And when he was taking off his shirt
he was putting notes (inside). They noticed him taking
pictures. Above his flat there was a balcony with

which could ke lowered so that it could take pictures
through PENKOVSKIY's window by command (remote control)
from the closed post. This was to get evidence, to
see the documents he was working with.

“There was another meeting with WYNNE, PENKOVSKIY
met WYNNE in WYNNE's hotel, They spoke in the bathroom

with the water running. But the KGB manaced to intercept
the conversation - not everything, but several words indi-
cating there was something incriminating, PEKOVSKIY

“They decided to enter PENKOVSKIY's apartment and see
what was hidden in his desk. In the GRU tl controlled
what documents PENKOVSKIY was taking...

“They used a drug to put him’ in the hospital, a pre-
paration which they put on his chair. He intaled it into
his body and got sick. His skin became reddened and he
felt pain and had to go tc a doctor, a military doctor who
put him immediately in the hospital. He wernt to a military
hospital - they were ready for him there - and was hospital-
ized... They considered his wife. then his wife s mother,
or his mother, or maid - i don't know - and the elcer girl
in school. On the second day of his illness a KGB officer
disguised as a soldier came to PENKOVSKIY's flat and told
his wife that the doctors wanted her to be checked because
it was possible PENKOVSKIY had a contagious disease. not
serious. She went to the hospital, and the flat was en-
tered. Keys had been mace before. They took pictures of
everything. They found many things, code pads and so on,
which showed that he was really working. After that they
decides to arrange his arrest.

“PENKOVSKIY was supposed to go abroad, and the KGB
did everything to prevent it, but in such a way that he
wouldn't understand. They even cancelled a whole delega-
tion.* This was while they were still trying to get’ proof.

“Then WYNNE came to Hungary, They arrested PENKOVSKIY
and I think one or two days later they took WYNNE.

“The manner of arresting PENKOVSKIY was s: ch that
even GRU wouldn't know about it. (D. M.) GYISHT ‘I (head
of tne GKKNR) took part. He told PENKOVSKIY to come with
him to the Central Committee, and when they were down in
his car he said: “Wait here a minute while I get a docu-
ment I forgot." There was an entrance on Gorky Street,

at but the car was in the courtyard behind. -The KGB was
waiting here, PENKOVSKIY got in the car, and that was
_ it - he couldn't call out, no one saw it.

“Two days later I know that (General S.G.) BANNIKOV
(Deputy Chief of the KGB Second Chief Directorate) flew
to Hungary and took WYNNE. I don't know the details of
WYINNE's arrest, but I know that BANNIKOV returned with
WYNNE... ; :

SKIY's female relatives or one of his ‘s female rela-
tives was a former KGB agent, and she intercepted the
girl...

"Mrs. CHISHOLM was walking on the. street end“ they.
dressed @ man just like PENKOVSKIY - he entered a telephone
booth or an apartment house entrance or something. She saw
him. It was necessary that they see each other at a dis-
tance refore making contact. J don't remember exactly,
but there was a little pack or square; and there was some—-
thing connected with CHISHOLM's child, something connected
with cendy.

“and about the Pushkin Street you know - that was for
PENKOVSKTY.

"The investigation was a big secret. I ‘found out only
when he was arrested, It was in 1962. Maybe @ month or
half a month before the arrest I micht have heard that
there was something hot in the Second (British) Department...
The Second Depactment officers were running around. (G.V.)
BONDAREV (of the British Department) was running to GRIBANOV
and didn't have to wait. Something was up, but wnat? Nay-
be (A.V.) SUNTSOV (of the British Department) told me: ‘Soon
we will nave an outstanding success.' I think that he said
that to KOVSHUK and me, because it was obvious that some-
thing was going on. In GRIBANOV's outer office it was
‘noticeable that BONDAREV was running to GRIBANOV every
day... GRIBANOV then dismissed others, even turning away
his deputies. BONDAREV was always there. So I knew some-
thing big was going on, but I didn't know what - maybe it
was a recruitment.

“Of course, I could have heard something from surveil-
lance. I was going to the dining ‘roon with Venyamin KOZLOV
(Chief of the American Department, KGS Surveillance Direc-
torate). I was close to him in 1960-1961. I went with him
in the general's dining room occasionally.,. KOZLOV would
say: 'Something is going on in the Second (British: Depart-
ment, KGB Surveillance Directorate).' Because he knew
the chief of surveillance for the Second Department...

"I don't remember where I was when the arrest was
announced... The officers in the First Department didn't
know what was going on. BONDAREY asked JACOB to confirm
that he was an Englishman, They were expecting an English-
man, not an American. The First Department was stunned
when they found out that an American had come to Pushkin
Street...

"The first time the KGB saw PENKOVSKIY and WYNNE
together they asked the GRU apout it, I think even (GRU
Chief I.A.) SEROV himself, whether PENKOVSKIY was “working:
with WYNNE. And PENKOVSKIY had-written-up something-about
his contact with WYNNE. The GRU replied that the contact
was official... WYNNE was coming as a businessman. The
GRU doesn't have a counterintelligence mission against
businessmen, The Second Chief Directorate does, and they
Moticed. Maybe PENKOVSKIY went to WYNNE's hotel room,

eard these things from SUNTSOV and from different .°
officers. GRIBANOY gave lectures, and BANNIKUV ‘too GRIB-
AiGV in Caucasus (I heard it myself). GRIBANOV spoke for.
three and a nalf or four hours without stop. During the
first half hour GRIRANOV spoke about the work of Averican "
Intelligence. Then he told them about the PENKOVSKIY case, ie
talking from notes, when I left in Jantary 1964 I heard
that the case study on PEXKOVSKIY was fin. d but mot yet ~~
printed. . BAINIKOV also gave a lecture, for the officers
of the Second Chief Directorate, which I-did not attend...

"I even visited the trial, not the first day end not
the last day. I went with some of the officers... we
got tickets from the Second Department. I went with one..of
the officers from the’Journalists Sect:on and stayed there ‘
for about an hour. Sone of the officers from the Seventh - on “i

SKIY the man, that in Turkey he was acting badly, and that ze
there was a bad knurakteristika (fitness report) in his ~
file... In the trial they never said that he was a colonel
or that he was in GRU, In the case study there was : Pate
more. They said many things - that he didn't give money }
to his wife, only five rubles a day. i

“I don't know the exact date that the surveillance
saw PENKOVSKIY and lost him. Maybe already in 1961, 1
remember that while 1 was working in the First (American)
Department in 1960-61, maybe in 1961, there ~as. a period
when - maybe once or twice - they took surveillance teams
away from us, despite the need for several brigades for
ABIDIAN, and gave them for a time to the Second Depart--

“I learned these details after the arrest. I heard
it from officers in the Second Department, SUNTSOV told
me, (S.K,) ROSHCHIN could have told me. GRIBANOV didn't
mention surveillance losing PENKOVSKIY in his lecture...
I think the massive surveillance on the British Embassy
was November-December 1961, but I don't know exactly,
PENXOVSKIY was in contact with someone else before this
woman, Mrs. CHISFOLM. The KGB knew who it was. It was
a British employee, but I don't know who... This might
have been in GRIBANOV's lecture. But GRIBANCV didn't.

details of the closed post or the details about the bal- -
cony. There was something in the case study that SUNTSCV' caer

that he himself resisted confessing, whereupon the GB produced
evidence consisting of tape recordings of conversations, photo-
graphs, and WYNNE's own business diaries.

The KGB played for WYNNE two tape recordings of conversa-
tions he had had with PENKOVSKIY, anc WYNNE (who was convinced
that the recordings were genuine) pinpointed the dates when the

bid conversations were heid: 27 May 1961 and 2 July 1962. The 27 May
1961 conversation was the one in which PENKOVSKIY mentioned his
girlfriend "ZEp"; it further consisted of an exchange of cryptic
remarks as PENKOVSKIY indicated to WYNNE that he had material
he wanted to pass to him, WYNNE told him not to discuss it then
and there but to wait till they were out of the restaurant.

The photographs were of WYNNE alone, of WYNNE with PENKOV-
SKIY, of WYNNE with unknown Soviets, of PENKOVSKIY with Mrs.
CHISHOLM in a park,* and of JACOB at the Pushkin Street dead
drop. Concerning the photographs of himself, WYNNE was able to
give the dates when they were taken, and the earliest of these
dates was 27 May 19€1--the same day iis restaurant conversation
with PENKOVSKIY was recorded. ‘This photograph showed WYNNE
approaching the CHISHOLM residence in Moscow. Another photograph,
taken during his August 1961 visit to Moscow, Cenonstrated that
the KGB observed an exchange of materials between PENKOVSHIY
and WYNNE. At the time the photograph was taken, PENKOVSKIY
had brought a satchel to WYNNE containing materials for British
Intelligence. (The satchel appeared in the phctograph.) WYNNE
took the satchel from PENKOVSKIY, left PENKOVSKIY waiting while
he-went upstairs and emptied it, came back downstairs with the

: empty satchel, and returned it to PENKOVSKIY.

¥—PERKOVSRIY and Mrs. CHISHOLM met twice in a park, in July
and December 1961; WYNNE believed that the photograph he
saw showed trees in full foliage.

¢. Compromise of CHEREPANOV

(i) Introduction

NOSENKO brought to his first meeting with Cli in January
1964 an official ¥GB "temporary duty authorization” showing
that he had been permitted to participate in the USSR-wide
search for A.N. CHEREPANOV the month before.* At this :
meeting and subsequently NOSENKO gave details on CHEREPANOV's nes
background, his transmittal of KGB papers tu an American in
Moscow, his compromise, his efforts to escape to the West,
his eventual fate. Essentially, according to NOSENKG,
CHEREPANOV was 2 dissatisfied former KGB «fficer who provided
American authorities with genuine KGB documents d whose
treason was discovered as a result of the U.S. assy handing
over the documents to the Sovict Ministry of Forcign Affairs. |

(43) Earlier Information on CHFREPANOV

CHEREPANOV's nane first was brought to CIA's attention
in October 1953 as a potential Suviet dcfector.

Jack RAYMOND, Belgrade correspondent for thy New York
Tines, telephoned a Third Secretary of the U.S. Embassy
there to tell him that he had a man in his office with in-
formation "from behind the Iron Curtain"; RAYMOND suggested
that someone from the Embassy would find the man of interest,
but the man allegedly did not wont to come to the Embassy.
The Third Secretary went to RAYNOND's office, wh he met
the unnamed individual in the presence of RAYMOND's Yugoslav
secretary. RAYWOND explained that the man had been writing
. to him from his home village, but. RAYMOND had not replied
until recently when he told the man to stop at his office,
as he had just done that day. RAYMOND added that the person
-had offered information of a kind that he did not feel he
could use in his news reports. The Third Secretary took the
man to his quarters and interviewed him, then interviewed
him again iater the same day in his office in the Embassy.

held the rank of lieutenant colonel, as NOSENKO himself

told CIA. He later retracted this claim, placing his rank

genetime late in January 1954 delayed the approach, It was
then fourid because of many other Soviets in his apartment
puilding, there were no opportunities for a secure approach.
Before an approach could be made under any set of circum
stances, the same American military attache had a half—nour
conversation with CHEREPANGVY while attending the Soviet En-
bassy's Rod Army Day reception in. February 1954. The ate
teche used each of the acveral occastons when the two were
glone to probe under various pretexts tor CHEREPANOV's desires
regarding a further contact, but CHEREPANOY respondec eitner
with non itval answere or not at all. The attache reported
hig impr dons that CKEREPANOY was a "confirmed ard lceyal
Soviet official of no special stature," and thet he was
“neither interested in nor desirous of further contect with
the West."

Two yeara later, in February 1956, it wea reported that
CHEREPANOV maintained limited social contacts with the U.S.
Air Attache and Coneul in Belgrade.

In April 1956, at a "farewell intimate luncheon" at-
tended by a representative of the American Embassy, CHERE=
PANOY stated that he was roturning to Moscow “here he hoped i
to be assigned for &@ year or two, but he was not certain

According to a report dated June 1956, CHEREPANOV had
been active in courting people from the U.S. Embassy io
Belgrade, and as of the time of the report, had gone back
to the USSR "probably to work in the Foreiga Office."

More exte:sive information on CHEREPANOV was provided
in 1857 by Milos GREGOVIC, a Yugoslav who defected to the
British in Octobor 1957. He hed been a UDB agent working
in Belgrade against foreign diplomats. CHEREPANOV was one
of his operational targets. According to this source,
CHEREPANOV was first posted to Belgrade in 194& or 1949,*
and was one of the very few Soviet diplomats who remained in
Belgrade after the break with the Cominform, at which tize
he wag charge d'affaires. In 1952 or 1953 he became First
Secretary and head of the Consular Department.** At this
time he was identified by the UDB as a Soviet intelligence
officer, The main reason for the UDB certainty about this
was the wide scope of his contacts with Yugoslav workers

*The break between Yugoslavia and the Cominform took place
in June 1948, There was no formal break in diplomatic re- r
lations between the USSR and Yugoslavia, although there was : :
no. Soviet Ambassador present in Belgrade from 1950 to 1833, PEPE
and there was no Soviet military attache representation pre-
gent from 1851 to 1953. According to the Yugoslav diplomatic
lists, Aleksandr CHEREPANOV arrived in Belgrade sometime in
1952, appearing on the diplomatite list for the first time in
November 1952, as Second Secretary. He was.one of only

seven Soviets appearing on the diplomatic list at this

time. The new Soviet Ambassador appeared for the first time
on the November 1953 list, bringing the total diplomatic
representation up to eight.

and students, a number of whom were arrested by the UDR on 4

suspicion. On several occasions the UDB had felt it had
almost enough evidence to enable the Yugoslav Government to
expel CHEREPANOV, but the evidence was never completely
satisfactor’

Thus in 1954 GREGOVIC was assigned the task of con-
promising CHEREPANOV's wife, Irene. Approximately three
months after he met her, CREGOVIC personally succeeded in
compromising Irene. He continued to handle her as an in-
formant over a period of about a year and a half, during
which time he also maintained their personal relatiorship
on a spasmodic basis. Irene’s information enabled the UDB
to discover that CHEREPANOV had established a network of
informants amonc: workers and students, mostly in Belgrade
and its vicirity. Subsequent information established the
fact that he was also in cluse contact with trade union
leaders and particularly with river port workers, a number
of whom were subscquently found to be anti-Yugosiav and pro-
Soviet in their outlook. Another Soviet, an intelligence
officer who had been recruited By the UDB, confirmed to
GREGOVIC that CHEREPANOY was a member of Soviet Intelligence.
The Soviet said also that CHEREPANOV had been an intelligence
officer during the war and had at one stage bcen parachuted
behind the Cerman lines on a special services operation
which resulted in the kidnapping of a German general.

GREGOVIC described CHEREPANOV as “always smiling but
in fact an extremely cold and cruel individual." Although
vhe did not appear to be emotionally attccned to his wife,
“he was extremely jealous and watchful of her, He frequently
urged his wife to use her exceptional beauty and seductive
charm in cultivating Yugoslav cfficials in order to obtain
information. GRECOVIC also said that CHEREPANOV was very
fond of hunting, which "appeared to give relief to his ex-
cessively sadistic nature."

CHEREPANOV was recalled to Moscow in mid-1956, according
to GREGOVIC.

Soviet provocaticn, which could lead to a denunciation of
the Embassy on the grounds of possessing Glassified Soviet
Government ducuments,** Embassy officials had the documents
photographed and on the next day, 5 Novenber, turned the
originals over to the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

“At the librarians! s request, on 16 November the Embassy -

placed a phone call to 2 man who identified himself as

i of all the people who had been working ‘in the American Department
‘during the time period covered by the papers, 1959 to 1960 or
1961.

The whole matter was he!d very tightiy in the KGB, and its
investigation went on for no more than 26 or 25 days. When the
KGB examined the doc:ments. some were round to be in CHEREPANOV'S
6G, but no documents were found which pertained to CHERE-

" PANOV's own case work, or that of the U.S. Embassy Section where

he worked. (NOSENKO also noted that the KGB found no docunents
dated later than 196]--rone for 1962 or 1363--only 1959, 1960 ard
1961.) Trius there were a number of indications pointing towards
CHEREPANOV, who had lett the section 1n 1961. The KGB did not
dare alert him by putting full-time surveatiance on him, but in-
stead mounted fixed surverilance posts at his home and office.

In order to provoxe CHEREPANCV into some precipitous action on
the basis of these susp)zicus points, a former KGB colleague was
sent to visit him and, in the cour-e of conversation, to mention
the great disturbance in the KG3 bevause someone had passed
stolen KGB documents to the Americans, CHEREPANOV manifested no
reaction to the news and was quite cool about the matter. The
next day the fixed surveiilence post opserved leaving his
house in the morning at nis usual time, apparently on his way

to work, but the fixed survetliance post at his office soon re-
he had not arrived at work. He had “simply dropped
te

4n intensive search ‘all over the ty of Moscow” ensued
then spread throughout the Sovier Union. Border controls were
tightened, photogrepns of CHEREPANOV were sent out to Republic
and local KGB and militia offices, all means of transport were
covered. Reports began coming in from various places that some-
one who seemed to fat CHEREP/NOV's description had been seen
acting suspiciously here and there. Reports wh came into
KGB Headquarters fre:a Gorkiy Cbiast strongly indicated the possi-
bility of CHEREPANOV's presence there, so NOSENKO was dispatched
to the area to check the reports.”

NOSENKO went to Gorkiy on the four:h day after CHEREPANOV's
disappearance. The area was covered with very deep woods,
“where a person could lose self for iife." On the severth
day CHEREPANOV was located and arrested in Baku, where he was
on his way to the Iranian border.

* When NOSENKO first told this story, at the first meeting in
Geneva in January 1964, he pulled from his pocket a document
which he said was his official KGB “temporary duty authoriza-
tion" to go to Gorkiy Oblast for the CHEREPANOV search. He
noted that he had brought it out iliecaily, to show CIA, The
document, authorizing the-Gorkiy KGB office to extend cooper-
ation to NOSENKO, was valid from 15 to 30 December 1963.

A special plane was immediately sent to Baku, cerrying
S.Ms FEDOSEYEV and several other American Department officers.
They picked him up and headed immediately back to Moscow,
interrogating CHEREPANOV on the plane. He immediately con-
fessed to having given the documerts to the Americans.
When asked why, he said he was “angry at the KCB, very
angry," and besides, he thought he might ask the Americans
for some money in return for the documents. He confessed
that on 4 November he had passed the documents to an Ameri.
can tourist wio was a librarian interested in Russian books.
He said he had given thé documents to this American in the -
entrance hallway in the building of the “inistry of Foreign
Affairs, the building in which the Ministry of Foreign =
Trade was also housed.

Because of the fact that CHEREPANOV had eluded the KGB
between the two fixed surveillance posts which had teen
established, the Second Chief Directorate suffered consider-
able criticism for not putting CHEREPANOV under fuli, round~ i
the-clock surveillance, CHERFPANOV himself, however, told : :
the KGB that had he detected surveillance on himself he
would have written to the government and newspapers a letter
of protest against "such an indignity, such persecution,"
and then would have committed suicide, leaving the KGB
without proof.

CHEREPANOV was in prison when NOSENKO left the USSR -
(on 18 January 1964) and would be shot, but the effair would }
not be publicized. In addition to his wife, CHEREPANOV
would leave a daughter as a survivor.

of 16 signatures, with dates after all but four, indi-
cating that s¢ individuals had read the report

addressed tu the Sccond Chief Directorate, ard copy

Two reports are on, Americans who had alr ady left

There are four operational plans for a “work

ber of surveillance teams assigned to work directly against

period, from late November 1957 to mid-March 1958, when the
FBI was conducting surveillance of two Iliegals in New York
City as an outgrowth of an operational lead from CIA source
POPOV (see Part VI.D.7.a.). Information from NOSENKO rela-

Another document is typed on A preprinted letter-
head form entitled “Agent Report"; the form has all of
the KGE organizational titles printed oa it, with blank
space left to be filled in-for the date, the rumbcr of
the section, department, “and directorate, the hare of
the agent source and that ‘af the case officer who rem
ceived it. This particular report is taat of the agent
"LILIANA,” concerning her. contacts with WINTERS petween
3 and 6 Sarch 1959, The report describes how she made
his acquaintance and what transpired a: cach of her
mectings with him thercafter. Following her report is
a brief statemer.t of future plans for the use of this
agent against WINTERS, A notation appears on the first
page that the report was translated from Spanich, al-
though the name of the translator is not given. (This
seems to suggest that the agent wrote her ova account
of her activities, as she is identified in the report
as having recently repatriated to the Soviet Union from
Argentina.) The typing date appears as 18 April 1959,
and the signature line was prepared for Major KOYSHUK,
“Deputy Chief, First [American] Departrent* of the KGB
Second Chief Directorate.* KOVSHUK's rame also appears
as the case officer who received the r2port fron the
agent.

One handwritten document, entitled clusions on
the Matter of Operational Development LANCELLE,"** is
on a kind of paper different from that used for any of
the other doaiments; it is lined and columned, and the
headings at the top of the columns (e.g., number and
date of document, to whom addressed or from whom sent)
suggest that the paper is a record sheet or log of cor-
respordence. It bears the date of October 1960, sut is
not signed, nor does any designation of section, depart-
ment, or directorate appear. The doctment is a summary
of LANGELLE's activities in the Soviet Union, primarily
details of his activity as intelligesce. officer for
CIA. One facet of LANGELLE's operatioral activity is
described in some detail, as follows: “On e 28tn of
May 1958 L. loaded a dead drop at Lenin Hitls. He ate
tempted to give the visit to Lenin Hills for the pur-
poses indicated above the outward appezranes of an inno-
cent outdoor recreation trip with chileren. Incidentally,
prior to loading the dead drop L, had previously cased
the travel pattern of his surveillance, the situation at
Lenin Hills, and had visited that area with his wife.

"As a consequence, it was established that this
dead drop belonged to a person recently arrested by the
Directorate of the KGB under the Council of Ministers

meetings with POPOV in Noscow are set out accurately,
with dates. WINTERS' mailing of a letter to POPOV is
mentioned, but in contrast to exact dates used through-
out the paper for other events cited, the date of

WINTERS’ mailing is given only as "January 1959

There is a handwritten document comprised of nanes
and addresses of Soviet citizens, headed with a state-
ment that these are auttors of letters addressed to the
U.S. Embassy in Moscow, but intercepted by the KGB.
Where dates of the letters are given, they are for Octo=
ber 1960, 1 few cases the contents of th2 letters
are characterized (e.g., "request for financial aid--
5,000 rubles," “complaints about inability to live on
persion"), Under two of the names a note appears,
which looks as though it had been added at a different
time or with « different pen, but in identical hand=

letters were enclosed in the package of documerts.

next is only a signature, it may well be the game hand.
The name is CHEREPANOV's. This document, tha only docu~
ment having for its subject a Sovict citizer, is a type-
written summary of derogatory inforration oa a Soviet
youth who began to lead 2 dissolute life ia 1957,
becoming a black market speculator and a homosexual.

As a consequence he was expelled trom the Komsomdl and
fyom the Institute at which he had been study » He
nonetheless continucd his criminal activities, including
contacts with foreigners for purposss of flezing the
USSR, despite warnings by the militia and the Ki2, and
he had two long mcetings with Attache Richard SNYDER,
"Consul of the American Embassy,’ to discuss his wisn to
go to Ancrica. ‘The document, dated February 1960, is
signed by Lt. Col. A, CHEREPANOV, “Senior Case Officer

Chief Directorate. (Presumably the document is relevant
to the American Department because of the contact with
an American diplomat.)

The remaining papers are handwritten drafts of

of them on WINTERS, All these notes are the same

(x) NOSENKO's Comments on the CHEREPANOV Papers

On 3 February 1964 NOSENKO was shown all the CHEREPANOV
Papers with the exception of the FEKLISOY repert on opera-
tional conditions in the United States. Just b«fore they
were given to him to read, NOSEXKO was asked if he had been
shown the pepers before he left Moscow; replied that he
had not. He said he knew that the documen ained to
BOWDEN, RAMSEY, HWARMSTONE, WINTERS, and LANCELLE, but he
had not read them, Asked who in the Second Chicr Cirectorate

knew exactly which documents were involved, NOSENKO named
S.M.FEDOSEYEV, Chief of @ American Departrent at the tine;
GRIBANOV, Chief of vhe aad G.I,
GRYAZNOV, Chicf ‘of th Se three

officers, he said, had possession of the docunents after
they were returned by iD to the KCB.

: NOSENKO then proceeded to examine and read aloud the
contents of the documents, making occasional explanatory
comments as he went along. He identified the tandwriting

of CHEREPANOV himself, as well as that of ‘KUSKOV, KOVSHUK, and
BELOGLAZOV, Concerning the substance of the documents, NO
SENKO made very few comments. in discussing tne operational
plan for work against WINTERS, NOSENKO noted that this docu-
sent, which was a hardwritten draft, had b i cd by
KOVSHUK, Chief of the U.S. Embassy Section; SUSENKO then said:
“He should not have signed this I do net know way ne signed
it. He should not have signed it." Asked why not, he said:
"Because it is a draft. He should have sign4 the typid

copy. Ard why he signed the rough draft I do not know..."

As he studied the agent report which KOVSHLY ressived
from source "LILIANA,” concerning WINTERS, NOSENKO commented
on KOVSHUK's failure to fill in the line which is intended
to identify the safe apartment or operational apartment
where the report was rcceived. "It is obligatory to indi~
cate the place, in the sccond line," he added. “It is
obligatory to write in the number of the persoral rile [this
did appear in the document] and where the contact took place."

Reading aloud the agent plan for BOWDEN, described
therein as the FBI man in the Embassy, NOSENKO came ‘to the
section which states: “Ironically one day as though by
chance he [BOWDEN] blurted out to our agent "SHEDOVA‘'
‘ARTUR's* affiliation with American Intelligence." He wes
interrupted to be asked who "SHNEDOVA" was; NOSENKO said:
"Cleaning woman undoubtedly. An affiliation of 'ARTUR' with
American Intelligence." He was then asked: “What connec-
tion did 'ARTUR' have with American Intelligence?" To this

*"ARTUR" was the KGB cryptonym for NOSENKO's agent Arsene
FRIPPEL; see Part V.D.5.

ERROR SOC OER A ECD TMA ERNE,

NOSENKO replied: "That I cannot say." The CIA case officer
remarked: “Why, you should know, you're his case officer...”
NOSENKO ignored this comment and continued to read.the docu-
ment aloud. A little further on in the document reference

is wade to usc of future agents to report on BOWDEN; again
“ARTER™ is ment.oned, and NOSENKO identified nim this time
as FRIPPEL, Then he said: "I asked FRIPPEL, and he said
‘But I know nothing.’ ‘How is it you do not, when hoe is

the counterintelligence man in your Embassy? He interrogates
you!' And he ansvered: ‘But no, he is a good man.'"

In reading a draft report which appears to nave been
an attempt to summarize the KGB information on WINTERS, NO-
SENKO read out the sentence: "During his stay in the USSR,
WINTERS sent eight espionage letters,* and loadec a drop
jn connection with a game the KGB played with American Intel-
ligence."" He was asked ft he knew about those eight letters, __

oe he said he did not.

NOSENKO retorted: “But at that time I would not have run him
down. He did not know that he had Metka on hin.*+* Prior to
the year 1962 did you know about Mctke? No, I don't believe
you did." At this, he was asked: Uh, you mean those eight
letters were detected from Metka? NOSENKO said: “Of course."
The case officer asked: "Not from surveillance?" NOSLNKO
said: "No. Beyond the fact that he could be seen mailing
then, the rest Metka gives....Wéll, that letter which was E
mailed by WINTENS to FOPOV was without Metka. That which was
for POPOV definitely was without siztka. But the other
‘letters, that was not so. I would not blame him. How would
he know? He put them in his pocket--that's all." NOSENKO
added that the lette’ which was sent’ to POPOV was one of the
eight letters to which the document refers.

NOSENKO then reviewed the document concerning Richard
HARNSTONE.**4# He repeated his earlier statement that HAR\—
STONE had been compromised and had been approached by the KGB,
that be turned down the recruitment offer, but that he did
not report the approach to the U.S. Embassy. He was asked
how the KGB knew that he had not reported the approach, to
which NOSENKO replied: “He was monitored and we would have
heard by audio if anything about this matter had been re~
ported....Undoubtedly if he reported it something would have
been heard from the Minister Counsellor's materials as to
what this might be. Ard they would dictate a message about
this."*#* Later NOSENKO was asked who tried to recruit HARMSTONE.

**#The first source of information on KGB use of Metka, the
KGB code name for thief powder or detecting powder, Was
NOSENKO, in June 1962.

*#*#See Section VI.D,.3.e. for a discussion of the HARMSTONE case.

‘***4HARMSTONE did report the KGB approach, and the Minister
Counsellor's office was the site of a discussion of the case.

He answered: "I do not know; -that was prior to my coming
into the departuent.- This was in the year 1953 or 1959,

I don't know who was the case officer who spoke to HARs-
STONE." ‘OSENKO vas asked: "Is he still in the Lepartment?”
He replied: "I don't think he ts. 7 don't think he is

concerred with it any more.

NOSESKO read the document which set forth highlights
of LANGELLE's operational activities in Moscow, chiefly
devoted to the POPOV casc, but also including information
Ginaccurate in detail) concefning a dead drop site in Lenin
Hills.** As ve read this section he cemmented: “Incidentally,
they [the KGB] found the dead drop and contents by accident.
Little children, child “Asked if fe knew anything about
this incident of Lenin Hiils, he answered, "Kids, Russian
children found it by accident. For after LANGELLE hed left
the area, survetllance checked over the area, but they found
nothing ." Reading rurther he cume to the statement that
it was er established that the dead drop was intesded
for the person already arrested by the KCB, REPNIKOV. To
this he added that REPNIKOV was known as-Stanislav “Slava”
REPNIKOV, who nad been recruited by some tourist; these de-
tails were not included in the CHEREPANOV document. He was
asked if REPNIKGV had been arrested and was thereafter
working under KGB control, but he said this was not the case.
He expleincd that he had been arrested, and thi KGB there=
after “roughed him up once in a while” becau ¢ was of the

category of Soviets who were known to associate with foreigners.

He did not know what American tourist had recruited REPNIKOV,
but he was aware of the fact that REPNIKOV had not beer
arrested until after the tourist had left the USSR, ***

When he was reviewing the summary; of information on
LITTELL, who had left the USSR before the summary was pre=
pared, NOSENKO was asked if he knew anything about one of
the Soviets named as a one-time contact of LITTEL's, B.P.
VORONTSOV. The document, a rough deaft with corrections,
contained a statement that a meeting between LITTEL and

*KOVSHUK was identified by HARMSTONE as the KGB officer who
made the approach.

**See the foregoing section on the contents of the CHERE-
PANOV package for details on the inaccuracies included in
this document.

***REPNIKOV had been reported as a dissident Soviet youth
as early as 1955, and in 1957 he told one of his American

‘contacts that he had once been arrested and served time in

a Soviet prison at some time for one of his attempts to
escape illegally from the USSR, He was arrested again there-
after for a second plan for escape, and he was given psycho-
logical treatment as a rcsult. REPNIKOV was in contact with
a number of Americans and other Western travellers again in
1958 and 1959, In September 1959 another Soviet, a friend
of his, told an American tourist that REPNIKOV had been
arrested after ‘receiving a letter from an American which
thanked him for his interest in being an ageat and gave him
directions for future contacts. In tke summer of 1960 there.

of REPNIKOV and a friend of his on charges of being agents of
CIA. Neither was. . ie

VORONTSOV took piace on the strect, and they went to a

restaurant together. It further said that VORONTSOV was
continuously in coutact with foreign tourists. These two
lines are crossed out in the draft, and in their place is
written: “The Second [Counterintelligence and Security}
Department of the UXGB for the city of Moscow is fully
oriented concerning -him.""| NOSENKO was told that VORONTSOV
most recently worked for. Inturist-at the Hotel Metropol ino
Moscow, and that he had had a number. of meetings with
Anerican students and with tourists. NOSENKO commented:
“This is agent work, He is an agent." He was asked, "But
to you nothing is known?" NOSENKO said, "Absolutely nothing."*

NOSENKO went over the rest of the CHEREPANOV documents
rapidly, for the most part simply reading them aloud, with
side remarks on topics unrelated to the donoments or the
Americans discusscd therein.

*In the summer of 1963, VORONTSOV had contacted two different

groups of young Americans and told them of his plans for es-
cape from the Soviet Union. He also told them he had informa-
tion about KGB agents through his Inturist employmest, and
that the American authorities should be told of him and his’.

used to get in touch with him to assist him in his escape .
plans. He was so open in his contacts, unrealistic in his
Plans, and insecure in his conversations with the young_Ameri-
cans (none of whom had any intelligence connections) that

when they reported to American embassies in the West, VORONT-.
SOV was immediately assumed by U.S. authorities to be either

a clumsy provocateur or a fanciful, immature youth. . Nothing
further was heard from VORONTSOV. There had been no previous
record of him in CIA files; the CHEREPANOV document was the
only confirmation of his other contacts with foreigners.

during the interrogations of February 1965 whe ‘NKO said that

Section] never sew these documents." NOSENKO has not changed his
origina) statement that the KGB has never been able to break
the military codes.

qualified

NOSENKO has stressed that he has no aptitude for technica]
matters and had no interest’in or access to information on spe-
cific techniques used by KGB cryptologists to break the American
codes. He suggested in general terms, however, that KGB suc-
cesses in this field were made possible in part by information
obtained from American cryptographic personnel who defected. and
were recruited in the late 1940's and the 1959's, in part by
information from the microphone installations in the two mili-
tary code rooms and certain U.S. Embassy offices. NOSE has
not specified how this information was used or which of these two
categorics of sources was of greater valuc, although he did re-
port that the loss of KGB ability to read the State Yepartment
codes coincided with and was largely a result of the installation
of an acoustically secure enclosure for cryptographic operations.
(The date was late 1961 or early 1962, according to NOSENKO, but
actually late 1962, according to U.S. authorities.) At th

same time, NOSENKO indicated, the microphone in the de
hich was probably effective until late 1960,
was of little use.

There is a degree of correlation between NOSENKO's informa-
tion on KGB cryptologic successes. and that earlier-reported by

®—Tr-was Tor this Teason that his own and the section's "number-
- one mission" in 1960 and 1961 was to recruit a military code

b. Information from XCSENKO

From.his personal experience, NOSENKO said in 1962, he knew
that the KCB Eighth Girectorate had broken the enciphered mes-
sages of the U.S, Embassy in Moscow but not those of the military
elenents there. At the end of 1961 or the beginnizg of 1962,
however, the KGB cryptologic success ended, accordi:ig to NOSENKO
in 1964. He has furnished some details on the types of Embassy
enciphered traffic being read in clear text and on the way in
which the clear text was treated within the KGB Second Chief
Directorate; in addition, NOSENKO has indicated that the KGB used
microphones in the Embassy and exploited human sources to further
its cryptolegic work. These points are reviewed separately below.

(i) Breaking U.S. Ciphers

The first reference-by NISENKO ‘to KGB cryptolegic successes
against U.S. Government eliciphered traffic was made at his sec-
ond meeting with C1A en 11 June 1962. At that tire he raised the :
subject in connection with his personal security new that he was EB
in contact with CIA. He said: "If possible, handle things in
such a way that on!y a small group knows. Listen, I don't trust
your records because there are people even there. I will tell
you something more. We are reading certain of your codes. There-
fore I don't trust this business and, therefore, { ask... It is i
better to list me somewhere in your records as an intelligence ~
officer who you have uncer development, But don't indicate ay
rank anywhere.* Listen, here is what 1 fear--! even had the idea
of going home and putting a bullet through my head and ending it
all. Because I don't trust you. | don't trust your methods and
I don't believe that you can keep a secret 'secret.’ I am afraid
that something will go wrong. :

"Listen, we are reading your ciphers. We are even reading
your ciphers. Certain of your ciphers are being read. We are
reading [them] at the present time. [ am afraid to tell you this.
Why? You will change them and they will guess at once why there
has been a change after everything had been going smoothly for
so many years. You must give some .thought--Let them read [the
codes]. Nothing has happened, America has not disappeared.
America is just as strong as it always has been.

"We are reading ail the State Department ciphers. Under-
stand, [we are reading} all the State Department {ciphers], but
not the military [ciphers]. This is the situation: We are re
ing all the State Department ciphers. [Several words unintelli-
gible, as NOSENKO is whispering.] What THOMPSON has said, what
is present Counsellor, McSWEENEY, [has said]. All this is being
read, i.e., these ciphers are being read, but the nilitary
{ciphers] are not. The military are not. [I know this because]
I worked in this business, against the American Embassy... I
was a deputy section chief. I know everything and I am telling
you everything. And my main work was with a code clerk...#*

Vater in this meeting, NOSENKO said he was a major; for a
further discussion of NOSENKO's rank, gee Part V.G.1.

** James STORSBERG, see Part V.E.3.c.(ii).



LENE SLL LIES L ODL ILLITE TTT NN “

I can even tell you that we tried to get him there, but it didn’t
work out...

if you change something right now, they will understand at once
that it could have come only from me... All ciphers that go from
Moscow tc Washington are being read, but not the military [ciphers],
the State Department ones. Because we still are unable to under- t
stand the military ciphers, but the State Department ciphers are
being read. But, if you wish to protect me, you must--I don't *
know what to do--let them be read. Listen, J saw them every day,

every day, i.e., the ciphers, ail enciphered State Department

cables wnich went from the Embassy. We had them all, down to

the last one. I saw them every day..."

"So, we are ‘reading all the State Department ciphers. But ae 4

eran:

During the third mecting, on 12 June 1962, NOSENKO revised
his statements made the day before. He now said that only cer-
tain of the State Department codes had been broken, and that he
had only rarety seen the clear text of deciphered cables, NOSEXKO
repeated that military cipher systems had not been broken. His
statements were ag follows: {We are reading] not all, not all, i
of course. Sore are being read... All things which are sent in :
cipher are, of course, intercepted, but not all are being read:
It is impossible. to read them, It is necessary to k 7
Ciphers to read them. Well, let's suppose that we send {encipiered i
cables] from ‘the United States. You pick all of them up, but you :
cannot read them. It's the same with us. Everything that leaves i
the Embassy, everything like a teletype machine, all this is noted,
everything, no matter how it is transmitted. But everything is i
not read... The State Yepartment ciphers are being read, not
all, but they are being read... I mean that what the military
sends we are not able... but we can read some of what your diplo- Hy
mats send, Not we [the KGB Second Chief Directorate] but the . :
[KGB] Eighth Directorate. They are reading some things.”

Asked whether the KGB was reading all the State Department's
enciphered traffic or only a small part of it, NOSENKO replied:
"Not all. We are not reading all the State Department [traffic]."
He also said, contrary to his statement of 11 July 1902 that he
saw the deciphered traffic “every day," these documents reached
bin "very seidom"--at the most "ten or twelve times" during 1960
and 196i.

Following his defection, NOSENKO reported that he had learned
in discussions with G.I. GRYAZNOV of the American Department,
KGB Second Chief Directorate, during 1962 and 1963 that the KGB
could no longer break State Department enciphered traffic by the ‘
end of 1961 or the beginning of 1962.* (Earlier, on 24 January
1964, NCSENKO said that he knew "definitely" that the KGB Eighth

‘Directorate was then having no success in breaking enciphered : 3

traffic of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow.) At about the same time
that State Department traffic could no longer be read, NOSENKO
reported, various U.S. Embassy officers were less often heard

W~Kcecording to NOSENKO, he was transferred to the Tourist Depart-
age from the U.S. Embassy Section, American Department, about .
this time.

discussing significant information over the concealed microphones
in their offices. This devetopment had led GRY Vand S.M.
FEDOSBYEV (Chief of. the American Departzent} to conclude that a
“room-within-a~room” had becn installed in the Emoassy and that
other security measures had becn instituted ‘there.+ After his
transfer from the American Department io carly 1962, NOSENKO con-
tinued, he also had occasion to discuss the KGB ioss of code-
breaking capability with GRIBANOV, Chief of the Second Chief Direc-
torate; from him NOSENKO learned that tne Central Committee of the
Communist Party was exerting considerable pressure on the Chairman
of the KGB for continuation of. tne material formerly obtained in
this manner; consequently, the KCB Cnairman vas demanding maximum
effort from all officers in the recruitment of code clerks,

In the second series of hostile interrogations. on 20 February
1965, NOSLNKO made the following statement conccraing KGB crypto~
logic success during 1960-1961; “Occasionally the Ergnth Directo-
rate would break messages, but very, very seldom, and we never sag
the documents."

(ii) Handling of Dec

he

In mid--1964 NOSENKO was dcbricfed or the proce
the American Department, during nis reported tenure re in 1960-
1961, in handling tne clear iext of dev iphered cabies of the U.S.
Embassy. The report of NOSENKO's statemeats on this subject is as
follows: “The Russian text of those State Ge par nt coded mes-
sages which had been broken was sent to SEMICHASINYY, the Chairman
of the KGB, who sometimes forwarded it to Oleg Miknaylovich GRI-
BAN Chiet of the Second Chief Directorate. BANOV at tines
forwarded some of the materiai to Vladimir Alek. evich KLYPIN,
Chief of the American Department, or KiYPIN’s successor, S.M.
FEDOSEYEV. NOSENKO saw such material on the desk of KLYPIN and
later on FEDOSEYEV's desk, but. was never permitted to read it.
NOSENXO knew, however, that tne reader had to sign for those
articles that he read. Nikolay ZkuSkO¥, from the Sccretariat
of the Second Chief Dizectorate, tbrougnt a book containing the
broken State Department messages to KLYP: or FELOSEYEV, Hie
would open the book to certain pages vhich had red paper and
permit KLYPIN or FEDOSEYEV to see the material. This was Eighth
Directorate material, but NOSEXKO did not know wnere or how
ZEMSKOV got it... At times portions of this material were read
aloud to NOSENKO by KLYPIN, but they concerned the Position of
the American Ambassador or the U.S. Covernment on political ques.-
tions and were of no significunce to nim. In. frequently there was
mention of the expected arrivai of Americans who were not per-
manently assigned to the Embass and NOSENKO renembered that
one such item concerned the arrival of one or two men, a ‘commis—
sion,’ to check the work of the Political Section. Ine attitude
of the Secretary of State or the American Ambassador was some-
times expressed on certain unremcmbered topics, but NOSENKO took
no interest in the information as it did not relate to agents or °

dures used by

formation on the decline in quality of intercepts resulting

agent activities. NOSENKO noted, however, that the material con-
cerned. messages from the American Ambassador, Moscow, to the
Secretary of State and from the Secretary of State to the Ameri- *
can Ambassador, Moscow, All of this material was highly sensitive,
and few people were permitted to see it or ever to know of its
existence. NOSENKO stated that it was treated aore carefully

than Top Secret infornation." a

(iii) Methods of Cryptologic Attack

Unable to describe the techniques of the KGB Eighth Direc-
torate in breaking U.S. Lepartment of State cryptographic systems,
NOSENKO nevertheless did indicate various acthods applied to the
problem as known to him from his position as Deputy Chief of the
U.S. Embassy Section and his responsibility for andling the pro-
duction of XGB microphones concealed in the assy. One method,
mentioned by NOSENKO on 12 June 1962, stemmed from the habit of
certain Embassy officials (notably Ministers Counsellor FREERS
and McSWEENEY) dictating the text of outgoing cables aloud.

When the texts were picked up ca the KGB micropnones,* the Eighth
Directorate compared against enciphered traffic intercepted

by other means. The two other methods indicated, analysis of
equipment sounds and exploitation of human sources, are dis-

cussed in greater detail below,

NOSENKO has twice referred to the Eighth Directorate's
interest in equipment sounds and snatches of technical conversa-
tions picked up by the microphones in the State Department and
military code rooms. He said on 24 January 1964: "Now, we also
listened to the code room and the teletype office, but we could
never get anything out of the teletype office because of inter-
ference [equipment noises which drowned out conversations] .**

In the military cc.Je room--that was where [James H.] STORSBERG
and later [Matthew P.] ZUJUS worked--we didn't get much. he
could hear STORSKERG swearing on occasion, and then he would men-
tion a group of numbers. This was, of course, all recorded and
we turned it over at cnce to the Fighth Directorate, dealing
with coding snd decoding. Of course, all other intercepts were
turned over to them also." NOSENKO reported on 14 May 1964:

"In 1960 and 1961 from the State Department code room [we heard]
always the sounds of machines only. Machines only. Three times
during these two years maybe somebody said one phrase or one of
the guys said several numbers. Jim STORSBERG was sitting alone
in the military area. The reception was good. He seldom spoke.
Sometimes he repeated numbers to himself and sometimes a mechanic
of code machines came to him, a military guy, a sergeant... I
forget his name.*** They said two or three phrases: ‘Did you

W See Part V.E.3.g. concerning the KGB microphones in the U.S.
Embassy.

** Until December 1962 when an acoustical room was installed
within the State Department to enclose cryptographic equip-
ment, teletype and code machines were vulnerable to the one
microphone later discovered in this area. Since that time
presumably only the teletype equipment could be heard. Here
NOSENKO is speaking of the earlier period. On 20 February.
1965 he said, however: "The microphone is not in the State
Department code room, but next door where the teletype
machines were located." This information was true only after
the secure room was installed.

#** William Stanton HURLEY, a Warrant Officer who supervised mili-
tary communicaticns, repaired cryptographic equipment, per-
formed stand-by cryptographic duties when STORSBERG was un-
available, and supervised other sensitive activities (see
Part V.E.3.c.).

There were numbers. He took them for one or two days and then
" returned them."

: NOSENKO was more specific with regard to another source of
analytic information. Questioned on 24 January 1964 concerning

the recruitment and use of code clerks by the American Departaent,
NOSENKO enumerated the recruitments known to him and then said:

“As I.recall, way back in 1948 or 1949, there was a man of yours
who defected. He stayed behind. I believe his name was McMILLAN.*
1 don't remember his exact name, but he stayed tehind in the USSR
and I know he helped them a great deal. Then, after him, was this : é
‘ANDREY.' | Thanks to his help they were able to read your State

Department codes.** To' date we have never been able to read your
military codes. '‘ANDREY' was not a code clerk. I believe he was 7

a code-machine technician. After that there were many efforts

made, but there were no successes. Right now I know definitely :
that the Eighth Directorate, which is involved with decoding, .
does not have anything at all. In the past they have submitted

reports to KHRUSHCHEV and the Central Committee on their inter- j
cepts. But now they are not getting anything at all. Therefore, {
right now the highest priority mi n given to the First [Ameri- t
can} Department and the Second [British] Department is to get A |
at code clerks, But in any event, they never were able te get
at your military codes." The debriefing continued:

Question: But did not 'ANDREY' bring out military code material?

NOSENKO: No, I believe it was only State Department material.

SMI s information were limited to this period or extended
to 1960-1961. Apparently the same type of cryptographic

equipment was in use by the State Department for the entire
time. See Part VI.D.3.b. for further details on this case.

What he mainly did was to describe the operation of {

code machines and what daily or other periodic settings 4

were made.*** Then, of course, those two who were very ‘ pte j

NOSENKO's statements about the KGB microphones in the Ameri-
can’Embassy léd.to investigations by U.S. authorities which re-
sulted in damage assessments, part cf which are germane to the
NOSENKO reports on KGB cryptologic successes. NSA examined the
question of cryptographic security in light of the microphones
found in the State Department and military code rooms at the
Embassy, while the USIB Security Committee studied the security
ramifications of other microphones which were discovered in the
Embassy. Extracts from the NSA and USIB Security Committee
reports are given below. Although the latter report docs not
operetta aee mention the cryptologic potential held by the nicro-
phones, it states that classified cables were dictated in the
Internal Political Section offices until Decenber 1963; most of
the military cables, the report adds, were typed by the origina-
tor, but certain ones were dictated in the Military Attache
offices.

(i) NSA_ Report

"... There were two code fooms in the Embassy, one serving
the Department of State and the other serving the attaches. An
operating microphone was discovered in each of these two rooms, *

“During the fall of 1962, special enclosures were built for
each of these rooms, and all cryptographic operations were per-
formed in these enclosures beginning in December 1962. Enclo-
sures of this type are built to rigid specifications and have
been exhaustively tested. They are designed to protect against
just such networks as discovered in Moscow. Thus, we may conclude
that there has been no compromise of information in Moscow due
to cryptographic operations since December 1962, so long as the
enclosures were operated in ‘accordance with the proper procedures.
Between 1952 and 1962, however, the code rooms were not protected
against this type of surveillance...

"... It was technicaliy feasible for the Soviets to have re-
covered the plain texts of the messages encrypted and decrypted
by machines; in these code rooms. This stems from the fact that
teleprinters and cryptographic equipments do not run silently;
they emit acoustical and electromagnetic energy--that is, they
make.noise as they! type, print. and punch information. The
sounds emitted by the machinery involve minute differences in
amplitude, frequency, and timing as different letters and charac-
ters are processed by the equipment. Relatively insensitive
pick-up devices can detect these differences if they are placed
cat fairly close range to the equipment as was the case in each
of the Moscow code rooms. When these sounds are recorded and
analyzed the plain text of messages can be reconstructed. Con-
sidering the specific equipment used, we must conclude that the
Soviets could have recovered the texts of most messages sent to
or from the Moscow Embassy from the time of occupancy until
December 1962 in the case of Department. of State traffic, and

, through 1960 in the case of attache traffic...

“In addition to the recovery of the plain texts of indi-
vidual messages being processed during this time period in Moscow,
_ ait is possible that information on the cryptographic operation

¥—Kecording to all Knowledgeable sources queried in the investi-_
gation of Dayle SMITH, all cryptographic operations, both military
and State Department, were performed in a Single room on the ninth
floor of the new Embassy building in 1953 and 1954. Separate
code rooms were established sometime after this and before 1959.

of the MCB (State Department cipher machine) and the KL-25
(Attache cipher machine) was recovered... This results fron

the fact that the sounds madé by these equipments reflect the
internal mechanical workings of the cipher machine; these sounds
can be recorded, analyzed, and the cryptosystem itself could
have been reconstructed. If this did occur, not only the nes-
sages processed in Moscow, but also those messages processed by
other posts using the same machines and the same cryptomaterial
could have been lost to the extent that they were intercepted...

"The attache cryptomaterials are similarly conpartmented.
During the period 1952 to 1960, various rotor machines were used.

| From I95S to 1958, the KL-1 was used, and from 1958 —
to date the KL-7 has been used. In October 1960, the KL-7 was

placed in a special sound-proof box which prevented any attache
traffic from being recovered after that time, since all attache

messages were processed either in that system or in one-time pad...

. "In Moscow, the Department of State during the period Octo-
ber 1960 through February 1961 enciphered nearly all messages
classified Secret and Top Secret in one-time pads, resulting in
the loss only of the Confidential traffic during that period.
Department of State found it necessary to revert to the use of
one-time tape machines for messages classificd up to Secret from
March 1961 until the enclosures were installed. Therefore, most
Confidential and Secret traffic was probably lost during that
period; but Top Secret messages were still enciphered in one-time
pads and thus secure...

“We must assume that all Department of State communications
shat were machine-processed in Moscow could have been compromised
from 1952 to December 1962. These consisted of messages of all
classifications until October 1960; Confidential. messages only
from October 1960 until February 1961; and Confidential and. Sec-
ret messages from February 1961 until December 1962.

"Most Department of State classified messages involving
Iron Curtain posts exclusive of Moscow should also be assumed
to have been compromised during 1952-1959 through cryptomachine
information derived at Moscow. It can be assumed that such
messages during 1960-1962 were not compromised by this means.
State Department classified messages which excluded Iron Curtain
osts would not have been compromised by the Moscow penetration
Because of the isolation of crypto systems. :

"Machine enciphered military attache traffic processed in
Moscow ‘should be assumed compromised until October 1960, but was
secure after that date.

“During 1952 to 1954, all traffic in the entire attache net
which included Moscow could have been, compromised.

“There is no reason to believe that any information was :
compromised through cryptographic operations after December 1962
when special enclosures were installed, so long as -the enclosures
were operated in accordance with the proper procedures...

. (4i) USIB Security Committee Report

"The security. practices and procedures [at the American
Embassy] appear to have followed a pattern from April 1953 to
May 1960, at which time the first plastic [acoust 1} room
was installed. A change occurred in the work habits [in May
1960) in that the more senior State Department officers utilized
the plastic recom for sensitive discussions and dictation. The
room could accommodate only a limited portion of the Embassy
classified discussions and, accordingly, a number of classified
discussions were held outside of this secure area. In the April
1953-May 1960 period it was an accepted practice of the Ambassa-
dor and the Deputy Chief of Mission to discuss openly in their
offices routine classified operations of the Embassy and to dic-
tate classified documents and telegrams. Extremely sensitive
matters such as high-level political decisions, matters perti-
sient to the most sensitive U.S.-Soviet relationships and positive
intelligence operations were not dictated and if discussed,

were mentioned in a cryptic manner...

"In the External Political Section during the 1953-1960
period there were daily staff meetings... Work assignments
were given at these meetings to individual officers who, in turn,
prepared classified dispatches or telegrams to the [State] De-
partment.. It was reported that the officers of the External
Political Section frequently dictated classitied material, includ-
ing telegrams, within their offices. Officers of the Internal
Political Section generated few classified telegrams... These
were, however, typed in the offices. From May 1960 to date (1964)
the Ambassador-DC’ operation conducted their most sensitive clas-
sified discussions and actions in the acoustic room; however,
routine classified day-to-day operations were discussed and dic~
tated in the offices. Ambassador KOHLER. reported that since
August 1962 he and members of his staff working on substantive
or sensitive matters utilized the secure room and that all ma-
terial to be encrypted was drafted in long-hand or dictated in
the acoustic room.

"The pattern for the External Political Section and the
Internal Political Section remained basically the same during
the period of May 1960 to the present time; however, the most
sensitive matters were discussed or dictated in the acoustic
room or drafted in longhand... In September 1962 the second
acoustic room was erected for the typing section for the handl-
ing of sensitive classified material. From December 1963 to
date it was indicated that no classified telegrams have been
dictated outside of the acoustic rooms. It was stated, however,

“that the day-to-day operations including analysis of develop-

ments within the Soviet Union were. openly discussed in various
offices and the conclusions reached later became the basis of
classified documents or telegrams...

“The military attaches reported that most cables were
drafted in longhand or typed by the originator and then turned
over to the code clerks for transmission. In certain instances
cables were dictated in the offices..."

1. Introduction

NOSENKO, as previously indicated, came to Geneva with the
Soviet Delegation to the Disarmament Conference in mid-March
1962 and established contact with CIA in June of that year.
His arrival in,Geneva and his first meeting with CIA thus
oceurred threemonths and six months, respectively, after
Anatoliy Mikhailovich GOLITSYN defected to CIA from the KGB
Legal Residency in Helsinki, on 15 becember 1961,* and was ex-
filtrated to the United States.

A discussion of what GOLITSYN said about NOSENKO appears in
Part V.I.7.

Presented below are, first, a summary on GOLITSYN, then
a survey comparing GOLITSYN's and NOSENKO's leads, and finally,
a protocol on GOLITSYN which NOSENKC signed.

2. Background Information on GOLITSYN

GOLITSYN, a KGB counterintelligence officer, was assigned
to the Soviet Embassy in Helsinki in Suly 1960 under the alias
of Anatoliy KLIMOV. In defecting to CIA, he previded more than
20 documents taken from the Helsinki KGB Legal Residency files
as well as extensive information about KGB officers and opera~
tions acquired during his 16-year career in the KGB.

GOLITSYN had had a variety of job and training assignments

in the First Chief Directorate in Moscow and training assignments
The bulk of his career was

in the Second Chief Directorate.**
spent in work against the American target for the First Chief
Directorate; this was his responsibility in Helsinki and had
also been his principal area of responsibility during his pre-
vious tour abroad, in Vienna from 19£3 to 1955. (In the lat-
ter assignment he had been known to Petr DERYABIN, who defected
to CIA in 1954, and this was the reason for GOLITSYN being

assigned to Helsinki under alias.)

Among the GOLITSYN documents was a study of American In-
telligence operations exploiting tourists visiting the USSR,
the so-called “legal travel program."*** This study, which
runs to sixteen pages in translation, was prepared in KGB
Headquarters and was sent to the Helsinki Legal Residency under
a cover letter, dated 7 April 1961, which suggested a number
of steps to be taken in order to counter such operations.

The study was based on two principal sources:

¥ Recording to NOSENKO, GOLITSYN defected on or about 15 Janu- :
ary 1962, after NOSENKO had been reassigned to the Tourist

Department.
** As a result of this service, GOLITSYN was the original

source of numerous leads to identifiable penetrations

of Western Governments, including agents with access
to classified information such as William VASSALL (see
Part VI.D.5.b.) and the French officer in NATO, George

PACQUES.

documents to the KGB.)

the USSR which had keen revealed to, or uncovered by, the
KGS. (Some of the cases had peen publicized throuch Soviet
announcements of arrests and trials, but -the majority of
those cases cited by nane in the study had not previously

tourists were wrongly accused by the KGB{

struction to recruit or agents in tourist agencies handling
travel to the . These eg s couid then provide information
on the use of these firms ty foreign intelliger.ce services in
work against the Soviet Wnicn.

GOLITSYN had information on certain aspects of the KGa Second
Chief Directorate work against the U.S, Embassy in Moscow. Prior
to his assignment in Helsinki he had conferred several times in
April and May 1960 with cfficers of the U.S. Empassy Section of
the Anerican Departnent, Second Chief Directorate, concerning
possible assistance he couid render them in their work against
American code clerks transiting Helsinki en route to their Moscow
posts.* Durirg his assigi t to Helsinki he travelled to Moscow
on TDY in January 1961, at which time he discussed: with these
same officers the possibility of his using in Heisinki a Finnish
businessman, Johannes PREI ‘EUND, who had been recruited by the
Second Chief Directorate for an operation against an American
code clerk in Moscow.** GOLITSYN acquired furcher information
about such operations on at least two occasions, when Second
Chief Directorate officers visited Heisinki on TDY and either
called on him for support or chatted with him about officers and
eperatiors, .

3.  GOLITSYN Leads _and Information from NOSENKO

ae Microphones in the U.S. Embassy

In his visits to the Americar, Department GOLITSYN learned
by accident of KGB technical operations against the U.S. Embassy

* NOSENKO denied that GOLITSYN visited the American Department
at any time in 1960.

**Although knowing that GOLITSYN went to the American Depart-
ment in 1961, NOSENKO said that the month was not January
but July, for it was in July that he ‘NOSENKO) was on leave;
GOLITSYN's passport, however, verifies he was in the Soviet
Union in January 1961 and shows no entries for July of that
year. See Part V.E.3.c. for further details on PREISFREUND.

he could sce that there were many such reports, each having a red
line on it, which signified that these reports were the property
of that department of the KGB Operational Technical Directorate
(oTU) which was responsible for making installations. He
j explained that this meant that she Amcrican Department had to re-
turn the reports to that Directorate, and this was the reason for
a search being made. The enly cffice in the U.S. Eabassy which

d. Leads to Operations Against U.S. Fmbassy Not Covered by
KOSENKO iz

GOLITSYN reported on six operations against personnel of
the U.S. Embassy in Moscow which have not appeared ia the re-
porting by NOSENKO.** ‘These cperations are summarized below.

GOLITSYN heard in about 1957 of the recruitment of a female

“employee~-"like a secretary"--of the U.S. Embassy. With another

American girl, she had travelled tc Georgia in 1957, ‘There the
KGB placed in her path a KGB agent, a Georgian male. They be-
gan living together, and this relationship continued in Moscow
where she was recruited.

help is equated to STORSBERG cn the basis of NOSENKO's and’
PREISFREUND's statements that FREISFREUND participated in no
other operation, GOLITSYN reported that the target of this
operation was recruited; NOSENKO reported that STORSBERG re-.
jected. the KGB approach. :

** By virtue of his position as Deputy Chief of the U.S. Emb-
assy Section in 1960 and 1961, NOSENKO said, he was directly
responsible for knowing of ali KGB operations against person-
nel at the Embassy in that period and definitely would have
known of any successes since his earlier tour; he knew that
"ANDREY" was the last successful one (1953-54).

iiinenpememsng?-the-U-S7-Embassy Section that~the-latter-had-as~an-agent:
code clerk in the Pebassy who was scheduled for transfer to Hel-

goed

sinki. This subject came up in a discussion of GOLITSYN's forth-
coming assignment to Helsinki, and GOLITSYN was told that if the
agent was transferred to Helsinki, GRYAZNOV might let GOLITSYN
have him as his agent. GRYAZNOV gave GOLITSYN 1.0 details about
the operation other than the fact that the agent had provided the
KGB with some iaformation and the KGB considered him “a real agent."

Also in the spring of 1960, GOLITSYN learned from GRYAZNOV
that he, GRYAZNOV, had developed an operation against a military
code clerk at the U.S. Embassy to the point that the KGB was "99
per cent sure" that the target would be recruited. “From the
accounts given by NOSENKO and STORSBERG, this ddes not appear to
concern the STORSEERG operation, which.was just beginning at this
time. NOSENKO has mentioned no other operation against a military
ecde clerk.

I.¥. KURILENKO told GOLITSYN that while serving in the U.S.
Embassy Section he had followed an American diplomat returning to
the United States in 1959, and there he had completed the recruit-
ment which had begun while the diplomat was assigned to the U.8.
Embassy in Moscow.* According to KURILENKO, he had travelled to
the United States under cover of the Soviet Exhibit Committee.

GRYAZNOV informed GOLITSYN in April or May 1960 that an

‘;merican, possibly 2 code clerk, but definitely an employee of.

the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, was cither recruited or prepared for
recruitment on a hcmcsexual basis beginning in 1959 and concluding
in 1960. The KGB had photographs of the American in various homo-
sexual acts. However, SHELEPIN, who had just become Chairman of
‘the KGB, was stressing ideological rather than blackniail recruit-
ments at this time; SHCLEPIN said that this method of approach was

. "too dirty" and the KGB should find another way. SHELEPIN did

not exclude the future use of the photographs, which the KGB would
hold in reserve.

Arother case mentioned by GRYAZNOV to GOLITSYN was that of
the attempted recruitment of an American female secretary on the
basis of her relationship with a KGS agent, either a lover or a
close friend. The agent, with the help of a KGB officer, tried
to influence her, but failed. She left the USSR prior to July
1960, but the KGB pianned to work on her again, as she was to
return to Moscow.

On a TDY trip to Helsinki in November 1960, V.V. KOSOLAPOV
of the U.S. Embassy Section told GOLITSYN that he had come there
in order to ride back to Moscow on the train with a U.S. Embassy
code clerk with whem he planned to strike up an acquaintance to
be continued in Moscow.** In about September 1961 a friend of °
KOSOLAPOV's came to Helsinki on TDY, and GOLITSYN tried to get

. him to talk about KOSOLAPOV's train operation, but he would not

discuss the case. From this GOLITSYN was certain that the re-
cruitment had been successful.

GOLITSYN learned from V.M. KOVSHUK, apparently in January 1961,
that the Finnish agent- Johan PREISPREUND had recently been used in
the successful recruitment of.an American at the U.S..Embassy.
NOSENKO has described no successful operations in-which PREISFREUND
took part (see preceding section). ~

¥—HOSENKO said that there was no operational reason for KURILENKO's
travel to the United States at the time of the Soviet Exhibition
in New York City, and. that KURILENKO's duties related only to
security; the KGB Resident in New York City, NOSENKO added, could
have given KURILENKO some special task if he wished.

4. NOSENKO's Information on GOLITSYN

In February 1965, after he had been questioned by
CIA about GOLITSYN, NOSENKO signed the following state- 1
ment concerning his knowledge of GOLITSYN:

"I have never met or seen Anatoliy Mikhailovich
GOLITSYN.

“During the period 1960-1961, while I was serving boy
as Deputy Chief, First {U.S.Enbassy] Section, First ;
{American] Department, Second Chief Directorate of the
KGB, I remember that Anatoliy GOLITSYN visited the
Section to discuss the proposed use of my agent "PROKHOR" i

{PREISFREUNU] in the operations of the Helsinki Residentura. ‘ :
I was away from Moscow at the time of GOLITSYN'S visit,

but I know that he talked to V.M.KOVSHUK, and that at
KOVSHUK's request he also talked to [Yevgeniy] GROMAKOV-

: : SKIY fof the American Department] about American diplomatic
couriers travelling through Helsinki en route to anc from
Moscow, and to KOSOLAPOV about American code clerks. I

‘ do not remember what they specifically discussed. I
learned about this visit from KOVSHUX after I “eturned
to Moscow from leave, and also heard about it from
KOSOLAPOV and GROMAKOVSKIY.

"Yl do not know the date of this visit of GOLITSYN's,
but I do know that it was after hewas posted to Helsinki.
I believe that it was in the summer of 1961. I know for
icertain that I was away from Moscow at the time on leave,
because KOVSHUK told me about it after I returned from "
leave. Since he discussed code clerks, I would have met
him if I had been there.

"I have been told by my interrogators that this
visit of GOLITSYN's took place in January 1961, I do
mot believe this to be true because I know that I was .
ost on leave when he came and my leave was in July '
1 . 8

"I never heard of any other visits by GOLITSYN to
the First Section, First Department, during the time
that I served there in 1960-1961.

j

"J have been told by my interrogators that GOLITSYN
visited the First Section, First Department, three times
in May-June 1960 before going to Helsinki and that he
talked at length to KOVSHUK and GRYAZNOV about what. he
could do. in the Helsinki Residentura to assist our Section .
in its operations against code clerks coming to the :
American Embassy in-Moscow. I am sure that GOLITSYN did
not make any such visits in 1960 and that. no such conver-
sations took place at that time. Since I directly super-
vised the work of GRYAZNOV and KOSOLAROV and shared the
same office with then, any professional discussions by them
with GOLITSYN about code clerks would be either with my
knowledge or would be reported to me. If he.did in fact
make such visits in May-June 1960, I cannot explain why I
do not know about them.

“I have been told by my interrogators that KOSOLAPOV
visited Helsinki in November 1960 to accompany an American
code clerk on the train to Moscow. I have also been told
that on this trip he hadofficial contact with GOLITSYN
concerning this code clerk and concerning one of GOLITSYN's
assignments to assist the First Section, First Department,
Second Chief Directorate by developing infornation on
code clerks before they left Helsinki for Moscow. I do
not know that KOSOLAPOV went to Helsinki in November 1960.
I do not know that KOSOLAPOV accompanied any Anerican
code clerk to Moscow from Helsinki, except Paul JENNER.

I do not know that KOSCLAPOV met with GOLITSYN and dis-
cussed the subject of code clerks with him in Helsinki in ‘
November 1960 or that KOSOLAPOV ever saw GOLITSYN in
Helsinki.

that GOLITSYN's defection took place after 1 had trans-
ferred back to the Seventh [Tourist] Department in
January 1962. In the ensuing investigation within
the KGB, I was never questioned on what code clerk
operations COLITSYN may have known about.

"I know that no written damage report on GOLITSYN's i
defection was prepared in the Second Chief Directorate,
In the Seventh Department, where I was serving at the
time of GOLITSYN's defection, I remember that V.D, !
CHRLNOKOV, the Chief of the Department, was questioned 7 A
about the orienterovka [study] on tourist. operations : {
which GOLITSYX was known to have taken.

"I have been told by my interrogators that GOLITSYN
defected on the night of iS December 1961. I cannot
accept this date because I know that I was no longer in
the First Department at the time of GOLITSYN's defection.
I agree that the true date of GOLITSYN's defection must

F, Surveillance of Soviets in the United States oe

i : 1, Information from NOSENKO
i At the second meeting with CIA in Geneva in 1962, NOSENKO

[Ears related that V.A. KOZLOV, Chief of the American Department 4
5 of the KGB seventh (Surveillance) Directorate, had gone to ,
[ oa the United States the year before to investigate the suspected
cessation of surveillance of Soviets stationed in New York City te

and Washington, D.C.*

"We have sensed that. something has happened in America,"
NOSENKO said at that time, "We do not feel surveillance. There
is no surveillance." The KGB Legal Resident in New York City,
B.S.IVANOV, had reported the situation to the KGB First Chief
Directorate which, in turn, had scught the Second Chief Direc-
torate's opinion as to why no surveillance was being noted.
Unable to suggest a reason, the Second Chief Directorate asked
whether the surveillance of Soviets could have been called off
temporarily, The First. Chief Directorate doubted that this
could be the case but did state that radio traffic normally
used in U.S, surveillance “was not on the air." KOZLOV con-
sequently was sent to the United States to assess the situ-
ation, and in the course of 2 month, NOSENKO said, he visited
both New York City and Washington, KOZLOV discovered not only
that there was no surveillance of Soviets but also that "they
dropped our democracies -- Bulgaria, Rumania, Hungary. They
temporarily took them [surveiliance] off."

Also at this meeting NOSENKO commented that:

- "I€ your surveillance comes up on the radio, they
{KGB monitors} pick them up everywhere." z i

- The practice of KGB case officers was not to
proceed directly from a Soviet installation to a meeting
with an agent, but rather to use other Seviets as decoys
"so that you will think we are working on somebody, where-
as in fact we are not working on them. [American] sur-
veillance is onto everyvody as soon as they come out
the door" of a Soviet installation.

NOSENKO's only other reference to surveillance in the
United States was made on 29 January 1964 during a discussion
of the "ANDREY" case.** While V.M.KOVSHUK was in the United
States trying to reestablish contact with "ANDREY", NOSENKO
said, he’ was usually accompanied by two other KGB officers.
KGB monitoring of FBI surveillance communications revealed
that KOVSHUK and the others*** were referred to by the FBI as
“the Three Musketeers."

2.Information from Other Sources
a. GOLITSYN
In early 1962 GOLITSYN reported that the KGB was well,

®——XO7ZLOV was in New York City from IS November to 30 December
1961, except for a two-week period (from S$ to 19 December)
when he was in Washington. His departure from New York City
fell on the same day that John ABIDIAN. visited the Pushkin
‘Street dead drop in Moscow: and that, according to NOSENKO,
KOZLOV later went to the dead drop site (see Part V.E.3.d.).
KOZLOV had earlier been in the United States with the

*. Bolshoy Ballet, from 12 April to 14 June"1959.

acquainted with Ametican counterintelligence surveillance
tactics, and since about 1953 the KGB, through special ap- Ee
paratus, was able to monitor radic traffic stemming from 3
American surveillance of Soviet Embassy personnel, While at

the KGB Juridical Institute in 1957-58, CGOLITSYN said, he

had read studies on the methods used by U.S. counterintelligence

in fonducting surveillance cf Soviet cfficials’in Washington

and New York City. The studies included some American docuzents,
obtained through KGB agent sources, ccataining instructions

for carrying out surveillance on Soviets. The KGB, GOLITSYN

added, used this information defensively abroad and in adapting

its own surveillance techniques within the USSR. fs

¢, CHEREPANOV Document

One of the documents provided by CHEREPANOV in November
19634 was entitled "Operational Conditions in the U.S.A. and
i@ Activities of American Counterintelligence Organs Against
Seviet Installations and Scviet Citizens in the U.S.A, in
1957-58." Nearly half of this document, signed by
FEKLISOV,** was devoted to a discussion of the organization
_and methods of FBI surveillance of Soviet officials stationed
in New York City and NYashington. The informaticn (sources
not indicated) covers radio communicaticas between fixed
surveillance posts and mobile surveillance posts.
