capability {a-in the ffeld of collection of FI intelligence and
operational support, the latter being Nis most outstanding area of
contribution to Station objectives, He would also be capable of
running CI operations, His knowledge of CA type work, however,
cannot be assessed at Headquarters,

Subject's cover is a natural one and poses no difficulties,
7 Since Subject has been in the intelligence field for over 20 years,
he is psychologically prepared for his dual role in intelligence
operations and ia well qualified to operate without strong Station
support,

Weadquarters is not in a position to coment on the timell+
ness ot quality of his operational reporting, but no defects in this
regard have been noted ner h yy dean drought to the attention
of Headquarters by the Station,

PERSONALLY-OWNED QU,

\ Because of the number of inquires received regarding personally-
owned quarters, the following memorandum which has been sent to
a number of posts may be useful as a guide to our policy on the
subject:

When an employee occupies personally owned quarters his SF-1190
should show in Section 21 (5) the initial purchase price as
shown by the deed, Section 21 (6) (7) and (8) should show

A annual rates for utilities as authorized by Section 132.5 of

Hy the Standardized kexulations (Government Civilians, Foreign
Areas), “Thése are the only items of cost to be cunsidered,

F When the quarters allowance system provided for reimbursement,

for quarters costs within a predetermined maximum, the regulations

\ provided that the allowance for personally owned quarters should
not exceed 10 percent of the purchase pr ed to dollars

$ at the exchango rate available at the time of purchase, plus allow-
able utilities, The 10 percent of purchase price was ample to
take care of taxes, dep tation; repairs, interest on investment,
and amortization of the costs within’a reasonable period of time
by U; S. standards, Only light, fuel, and water could be added

in arriving at the allowance.

Under the current quarters allowance system, it is expected that
the flat rate will be paid unless the authorizing officer believes
it necessary to reduce the payment under Section 134.2 of the
Standardized Regulations, The employee in personally owned
quarters would be treated the same as any other (except that

ho cannot receive advance payment of quarters allowances under
Section 113 of the Standardized Regulations). This makes
unnecessary .a special rate for personally owned quarters, The
requirement to report the purchase price on SF-1190 is to pro-
vide- the authorizing officer additional information to be considered,
together with any other pertinent local circumstances, in deciding
whether reduction of the allowance is necessary and, if so, how
much, Only the utilities costs are to be considered in addition
to the purchase price except in tiose rare instances where Land
rent 4s involved, Recause of varying conditions between posts

and individials, it was not considered advisable to specify any
certain percentage of the purciase price that should be considered.

In addition to the information on the SF-1190, the authorizing
officer should consider local circumstances, which vary greatly
from post to post, in deciding whether the occupant of personally
owned quarters should be treated any differently than the employee
in rented quarters and receiving the flat rate allowance,

Méxioo, DP.
al, April, 1969

SUBJECT: Involuntary Retirement

1, A desk officer from Headquarters visited the xéxico
City Stetion during mid-November, 1968. While here, the visiting
officer talked with the writer for Spproximably one hour regarding
the operation of the Litempo project and writer's plans for the
futuro. The following points were discussed:

seaaieg (a) The fact that the project was egonsidered to be an
Anmportant and succeasfuh one,

(b) Writer was aveoifioally asked if he had any plans
for an early retirewent. Writer replied in tho negatives Tue
visiting offiner indicated complete satisfaction with writer's
desire to continue in the service, and noted that it wanld he

(a) When the visiting officer asked whether the sariter
had ever visited Headquarters during bis oareer with the service,
and found that he had not done 30, the officer asked whether
writer could arrenge to visit. ¥eadquarters for a week or ten days
during his next hone leave, which would take plage in August, 1969.
Writer ind{ooted that he sould be most pleased to do B0o E

2¢ Based on the foregoing, writer made plana to provead to
the United states on homo leave in early August, 1969, to return
in’ mid-September, 1969. Since auch matters cannot be handled on
short notice, writer has already rented @ house in San Franaisoo,
California for the pertod in question, :

30 This 1 whore matters stood, when, on 7 April, lest,
writer was advined that he would be retired, effective 30 June,
1969, in aecordence with various ohanges of poltoy, He ans also
asked to confirm in writing that he te in scoord with the plan
to place him on retired status as of 36 June, nexts

4. While the roasoning behind what appears to be a comlete
reversal of poliey, vloeaevis the ariter, may be orystal elear to
tho responsible uffietals at Headquarters, uriter ta at a eomlete
losa to understand,



For the #riter to indicate his agreszent with a plen which
appears.to him to be arbitrary, short-sighted end irraticral, would
: ts bo completely out of-charaoter-for @ peraon-who has. spsnt. almost i
thirty years in the intelligence field, and has a justifiable pride
in his statua aaa professional intelligence officer, As a
--———profesaional, writer also realizes when the handwriting, nowever
dllegible.it might be, is on the wall, and, thet if the desision
has already been made to retire him involuntarily, then retired he
i will be === involuntarily, Little it may matter, writer desires
oe to emphasize that nothing in this memorandum should be construed
to indicate writer's personal eccord or approvals

: 5s According to writer's records, as of 30 June, next,
he will have complated the following government service:

Yre. Kos. Daza

(a) Military: 2nd, Lt., 30th U.S.
Infantry; Prosidio, San Fran-
atsco, 26 Oet., 1939 to 32
TUL, LWOsscccevsverscseeves 9 6

(b) Speotal Agent, 12 Auge,
1940 to 31 October, 1960..... 20 2 18

(e) Careor Agent, 1 Nove,
1960 to 30 June, 1969....004 8 8

(4) Accusulated A/L as. of 30 June,

1969, - 656 bra, neces Sue

Total Service we... 29 11° 16

Writer desires to complete thirty years’ aervioe, and requsata
thet the effeotive dete for hia involuntary retirement be set

sooordinglys

6. Nose Taave: Shile eriter readily understanda the
rotionale oP @ Fullng preventing the taking of hose louve at
government oxpenge within two yeara of voluntary retiruaent,
he does not see that the interrots of falrnoao, jJuaticae cr
denanay are tein: served in attempting to apply the same ruling
to sriter'e involuntary retiresent, As a aatter of possidle
htatortaal tat iter deolros to point out that, shea he
joined the ger in 2256, he voluntarily asve up the bons
duavs ehias he hed earced @ith the (3 yenre), @riter has



taken hone leave in 19£2, 1964 and 1966, in aooordenns with
Pegulationas In line wita what anpaared to be Agensy polioy as
of Novembor, 1963, writer has made plans for home laave from
August to 15 Septesder, 1949, Writer fesls. moat strongly that

~“heand hie fahily snould bo allowed to take this leave at

government expense.

|

|
innannataeal|

‘ 8, In conclusion, eritar wishes to atate that he haa
thoroughly enjoyed his asscatation with the Agenay euring the

past Mine years, and ts proud of his part in the acecuali shmenta
of the México Clty Station, Owing to the nature of writer ts
position, nis personal gontaata hove been largely lizited to

fhe personnel of the Station hore. The writer haa the highest
professional and personal regard for the Chief of Station. with
vhom he has been privileged to serve, as vell ay the highly
competent case officers who havo worked with writer on tie projeote

It is a ecurce of great satisfaction and pride to the
Briter to have known and worked with a truly great Aerioan,
Sr. Allon W. Dulles, whom the "San Franolseo Chronicle” (generally
g hostile orttio of the Agency) described posthumously as
+The most creative, powerful and eminent U.S, intelligence
officer of modern times", And, a8 one's career comas to a close,
the words of Prosident Nixon, in desoribing Mr. Dulles* great
gontribution to his country, have a very sartioular significance:
“.eoIn the nature of his task, his achievements were kaosn to
only @ fow,. But, because of-him, the world 18 a safer place today",
