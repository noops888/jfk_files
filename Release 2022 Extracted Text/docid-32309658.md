BETANCOURT indicated that he had been the General
Coordinator of the 30th of November anti-Castro organization
in Cuba during 1959, 1960 and the first part of 1961. He
arrived in the United States at Miami on June 29, 1961, via
small boat. Upom his arrival in the United States, he assumed
leadership of the 30th of November movement in Miami until
approximately October, 1962, when he entered the U. S. Army
under the Cuban recruitment program at Fort Jackson, S. C.
Subsequent to this, he has been affiliated with the 30th of
November movement in Chicago for approximately two years,
1963-1965, and in Miami, 1965 to date.

BETANCOURT is currently _employed_as_a security guard
for the Nation ive Agency and the National
Industr tion (affiliates), 590 S, W.27th
Avenue, Miami, Fiorida. In connection with this employment,
he is a guard at the Cuban. Refugee Processing Center of the
Department of Health, ‘Education and Welfare (HEW) three days
ta week, The Processing Center is located in Buildings T-90
and T-94 which are utilized by the U. S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service (INS) in processing, fingerprinting and
photographing Cuban refugees upon their arrival in the United

these arrivals

BETANCOURT related he met ROBLEJO around the first
of January, 1967, when ROBLEJO reportedly returned from Mexico
City where he had been attempting to seek the release of Cuban

\peobitical prisoners in Cuba, He met ROBLEJO through ANGEL

est VEZ, a coworker of BETANCOURT at the Hotel Fontainebleau
w oth were employed as waiters at that time, At the
request of ESTEVEZ, BETANCOURT furnished ROBLEJO a table gratis
at the Frank Sinatra.show at the Fontainebleau Hotel, for which
ROBLEJO was apparently grateful. As a result of this, ROBLEJO
sought BETANCOURT's assistance in attempting to obtain the

} release of political prisoners and recently BETANCOURT was

+ made a member of the Executive Committee of the CPLLC.

In this connection, BETANCOURT accompanied ROBLEJO

to San Juan, Puerto Rico, the first week of June, 1967.

BETANCOURT by this time had the impression ROBLEJO was actually
\ anti-United States and he considered ROBLEJO a “leftist-socialist."
While in_Puerto Rico, they met with MANOL Y and RUFOSBROPEZ...
ESQUET. ROBLEJO discussed the possibility of RAY and LOPEZ
ESQUET becoming active in seeking the release of Cuban
political prisoners. However, no definite agreement or
conclusion was reached.

~ SEERER—

BETANCOURT stated that on or about June 15, 1967,
he and ROBLEJO, while temporarily staying at 2930 Loiza,
Santurce, Puerto Rico, were having a general conversation and
ROBLEJO changed the topic to BETANCOURT’s current work as a
security guard at the Miami Airport where the Cuban refugees
are processed. ROBLEJO asked detailed questions concerning
the nature of the activities~at~this-location, to which BETANCOURT
explained that Cuban refugees upon their arrival in the United
States are processed here’, including having their photographs
taken, being fingerprinted, arid being interrogated. ROBLEJO
asked BETANCOURT if the FBI was there, which BETANCOURT acknowl-
edged in the affirmative, and ROBLEJO asked, "What do they do
there?" BETANCOURT answered, “They investigate and clear all
of the refugees arriving from Cuba in the United States."
ROBLEJO was interested in knowing if BETANCOURT saw "those papers"
and BETANCOURT stated he had’ seen them, (BETANCOURT indicated
this was entirely fictitious, but since he did not trust ROBLEJO,
he felt he might be in a position to be of possible assistance
to the U. S. Government). ROBLEJO asked BETANCOURT if he could
"photograph...take a picture of the documents or the people
the FBI investigates." BETANCOURT asked ROBLEJO if he was
"crazy," stating that if he did something like that, he could
be put in the “electric chair.” ROBLEJO indicated that with
the use of a small camera, this could be accomplished very
easily. Almost immediately, the topic was changed and BETANCOURT
indicated to ROBLEJO he had to leave San Juan immediately because
his child had just broken his collar bone. BETANCOURT also
indicated to ROBLEJO that his, BETANCOURT'’s, wife had called
and said she did not have any money in the house to buy food,
etc. At this point, ROBLEJO gave BETANCOURT a check in the
amount of $300.00, drawn on the First National Bank of Miami,
on the account of the Committee of Relatives of the One Hundred.
ROBLEJO made out this check in BETANCOURT's presence and
requested $50.00 be given to ROBLEJO's mother. Immediately,
BETANCOURT cashed the check and sent a money order to his wife,
ERMITAS RAMON ARIAS.

BETANCOURT stated ROBLEJO had given him $50.00 in
cash prior to their departure. for Puerto Rico,

BETANCOURT advised he returned to Miami from Puerto
Rico on June 18, 1967, and ROBLEJO remained in San Juan until
June 28, 1967. He recalled ROBLEJO attempted to have him stay
in Puerto Rico and was “mad" at BETANCOURT for leaving early.

On June 30, 1967, ROBLEJO telephonically contacted
BETANCOURT, during which conversation ROBLEJO indicated he

planned to go to Venezuela, Panama and Ottawa, Canada, and
would see BETANCOURT upon his return, ROBLEJO is interested
in obtaining a Mexican visa in order to go to Cuba to possibly
converse with FIDEL CASTRO or other important leaders in the
communist government of Cuba in connection with the possible
release of Cuban political prisoners.

Local stops tiave been placed with INS in order to be
notified of ROBLEJO's return to the United States.

Miami plans to locate and possibly monitor the bank
account of the Committee of Relatives of the One Hundred and
any other accounts where ROBLEJO is the authorized signature
of an account.

The Bureau is being requested in a separate communi-
cation captioned "SERGIO OSWALDO BETANCOURT COLLAZO, aka
“Ariel,” PSI ~ CUBA," to grant authority to contact him in
order to follow up in connection with ROBLEJO's request as
mentioned above in the event ROBLEJO attempts to pursue this
matter further.

The Bureau will be kept advised, LHM incorporating
pertinent data regarding subject's activities will be promptly
furnished to the Bureau. :
