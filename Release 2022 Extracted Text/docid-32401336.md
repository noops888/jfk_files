a. Although sporadic gunfire
continued through the night in Bagh-
jad, the army is in control.

b. Arif has plans to announce
the make-up of his cabinet today.

It will probably contain some "mild"
Baathists.

c. He permitted Syrian strong- 7

founder of the Baath Party, who were :
caught in Baghdad by the coup, to

doubt very much if they are interested,
however, in the meaningful political
and military unity the previous re-
gime was aiming for.

b. He has been visiting provin-

loyalty. He has continued to spread
the idea that the coup was largely
his own doing.

JFK Act 5 (g) (2) (D)

a. Pamphlets and posters
bitterly lampooning Nasir, espe-
cially for his involvement in Yemen
and Algeria, have appeared on the
streets of Cairo and Suez.

b. Such public expression of
anti-Nasir sentiment is highly
unusual.

ec. It is still in a very low
key, however, and there is no sign
of organized opposition.

JFK Act 5 {g) (2) (D

d. We do not consider Nasir
to be in any immediate danger of
overthrow, though he could be forced
to modify unpopular policies if the
discontent spreads.

6. Bolivia a. The return last week of
Vice President Lechin, who has been
a on ice as Bolivia's ambassador in

Rome, will heat things up in La Paz.

b. The city has already wit-
nessed four minor demonstrations
which Embassy La Paz attributes to
left-wingers encouraged by Lechin's }
presence.

7. Cambodia . a. Sihanouk may have finally
painted himself into a corner on US
aid. §,

b. He has followed up yester-
day's emotional public renunciation
with an official request to our embassy
for talks on the subject.

retain some of our aid, even on his
terms.

ce. The chargé has no informa-
tion on the motives behind this
switch, Our embassy thinks it may
be a move to pave the way for explora-
tory talks by Foreign Minister Suband-
rio at Bangkok with his Thai and
j Philippine counterparts... It may also
be meant to provide a more recep-
tive attitude for Nasution's visit
here.

d. Our embassy thinks Nasution
went in for his Malaysia sabre rat-
tling on Sukarno's orders, or at
the very least, with the president's
tacit support. Sukarno may feel
Nasution has stolen some of his
thunder.

a. Adoula still did not get
around to announcing the expulsion
of all Soviet and Czech embassy per-
sonnel yesterday. However, his
people managed on Tuesday afternoon
to corral and hog-tie the Soviet
counselor and press attaché before
they could eat-up all the incrimin-
ating papers in their possession.

b. The Russians are now being
. held at Ndolo prison, The Congolese
i surete says the seized papers include,
fesse yoit (among other things, minutes of a
i) "liberation committee" meeting of op-
position politicians in Brazzaville,

c. The Belgian ambassador
thinks these papers are probably
genuine. He says the Russians have
made the mistake of underrating the
Congolese and have stumbled into a
surete trap.

d. The Congolese also picked
up two Czech diplomats but have since
released them, This morning they
arrested the correspondent of the
Soviet news agency.

b. The two battalions of
Ethiopians provide the guts of the

c. Justice Party members will
be putting on pressure for early
national parliamentary elections.
However their party leaders do not
believe the Turkish military, which
ousted Menderes in 1960, would per-
mit them to take over if they won §
new elections, ;

armed forces.

their new responsibilities. There
are, however, a few signs of dissen-
sion within this group and between
it and civilian politicians.

g. One of the more ambitious
and troublesome figures is the able
but opportunistic General Ton That
Dinh, the new Minister of Security.
He has been travelling about the
country spreading the idea that the
coup was largely his doing and seems
bent on developing his own independ-
ent base of power. He is a man to
watch.

h. The new regime has also
embarked on a purge of high military
officers who sided with Diem during
the Buddhist crisis and failed to
get on the right side soon enough,

right to restrict Allied use of the
zir corridors. In early 1962, the
Soviets attempted to reserve "blocks"
of air space for their own use. They
Eave since demanded that Western

a. North Vietnamese leaders
are pressing their campaign for neu-
tralization of South Vietnam,

b. They can count on Cambodia's
support. Prince Sihanouk has said
he believes neutralization of South
Vietnam to be the only way to keep
his country and the rest of the area
from falling eventually into Commu-
nist hands.

c. The French feel the same
way. Indeed, Souvanna Phouma re-
portedly told a closed session of
the Laotian National Assembly that
the French were urging him to sup-
port Hanoi in this.

d. Moreover, according to one
of our clandestine sources, the North
Vietnamese have talked Souvanna into
backing the neutralization proposi-
tion in the UN.

e. The troublesome Polish ICC
delegate in Laos, Marek Thee (who
will be going home soon), has just
returned to VAentiane from Hanoi and
is trying, with somewhat less suc-
cess, to enlist British support too.

£. As part of the same campaign,
the North Vietnamese have told the
French they believe sentiment is
growing in the US for withdrawal of
US forces. They reportedly plan to
keep the heat on to encourage it.

g- Hanoi is at the same time
trying quietly to encourage the belief
that it is ready to be reasonable.

h. To hear Thee tell it, North
Vietnamese leaders feel that neutral-
ity for South Vietnam and eventual
reunification is the only way they,

too, can escape from Peiping's clutches.

a. As is usual in Laos, the
tentative agreement for a cease-fire
reached last week between Kong Le
and Pathet Lao commander Singkapo
came to naught.

b. Each side accuses the other
of planning to use a cease-fire to
screen preparations for larger at-
tacks.

c. There is scattered fighting
in the Plaine des Jarres. Lao Army,
neutralist, and Meo guerrilla ele-
ments are jointly engaged in a
limited offensive in the Vang Vieng

e, Sihanouk's actions toward
the US have not been universally
popular. This is particularly true
among government officials, the bus-
iness community (who have reason to
» fear stepped-up nationalization),
s+ and the military, where the US re-
tains a considerable reservoir o
goodwill. ;

f£. Indications are that Si-
hanouk will try to win fuller sup-
port by creating new feuds with
neighboring South Vietnam and Thai-
land. This is a gambit he has used
to advantage in past difficulties.

a. Vietnamese Communist forces
-kept up their high post-coup level
of activity over the weekend.

b. The most significant action
was an attack early yesterday morn-
ing against a US special forces train-
ing camp some 30 miles from Saigon.

c. When the smoke cleared after
a sharp fight, four US soldiers were
missing and at least 35 South Vietnamese
were dead.

d. Late yesterday morning, the
Viet Cong shot down two aircraft sup-
porting a government operation in
the extreme south, and damaged twelve
more. Two more Americans are missing
in this action.

e. Back in Saigon, the new re-
gime's troubles with the ambitious
General Ton That Dinh continue.

f. He is still angling to get
control of the important strategic
hamlet program and has yet to give
up command of the Third Corps, which
the generals assigned to another of
their number earlier in the month.
This corps is of particular signifi-
cance in that it surrounds Saigon.

a. The shaky new accommodation :
between the two countries following
the recent coup in Iraq has been 2
threatened by Syria's action in grant—
ing asylum to Ali Saleh Saadi, the
exiled leader of the extremist wing
of the Iraqi Baath.

b. Saadi had arrived in Syria
unannounced following a brief stay
in Madrid. on Friday, Iraq sent a
message asking Syria to expel him on
grounds that sheltering him was a
breach of agreement. .

c. Both regimes continue to be
troubled with internal dissension
with affairs in one deeply tangled
with those in the other,

d, In Syria, as we mentioned
yesterday, the Baathist regime is
split between moderates who desire
a broadening of the government's
Power base,and a doctrinaire faction
which wants to keep all. control of
the government in Baathist hands.

e. In Iraq, the pull-is more
away from the Baathists. Two minis—
ters have threatened to resign unless
the government adopts an openly pro-
Egyptian policy. Nevertheless the
government feels secure enough to ;
ease up on curfew and transport re- é
strictions imposed since the coup.

a. According to press reports,
Viet Cong attacks on Sunday wiped

out two of the government's strategic
hamlets in the central highlands about
250 miles north of Saigon.

b. More than 1,000 inhabitants
in the hamlets--who are minority
tribesmen--are missing and possibly
have fled into the mountains. They
abandoned a significant quantity of
weapons to the Viet Cong.

ce. These attacks not only sug-
gest continued erosion of the govern-
ment's programs to win over tribal
support, but also signal that stepped-
up Viet Cong pressure against the new
regime is spreading to the north.

b. This year's harvest was
clearly very bad. The weight of
evidence suggests that Soviet grain
stockpiles have been far drawn down
this year and are not sufficient to
protect the country from another
poor harvest.

7 ¢. Our estimate is that total Ey
grain production each year since

1958 has been well below that year's
level of 125 million tons, while

the population has continued to grow.

d. We have

to Khrushchev's oft-stated plan to

killed, three wounded and 39 missing.

the election ‘of socialist Jovita
Villalba of the Republican Democratic
Union is a possibility.

* d, About one quarter of the
registered voters are youths going
to the polls for the first time, and
they may push up Villalba's total.
Also, the Communists, who have said
they will boycott the elections, may
vote for Villalba if they believe
their votes will defeat Leoni.

announced by Venezuelan authorities
yesterday, provides the best evidence
¢i8 to date of major Cuban support for
Latin American subversives.

b. There is definite proof
to support the Venezuelan claim,
The three tons of weapons found in-
clude light automatic rifles and

submachine guns identified as among
those shipped to Cuba from Belgium
in 1959 and 1960. There were also
mortars, bazookas, recoilless rifles,
and ammunition of US manufacture.

ce. Communist documents seized
by Venezuelan authorities earlier
this month reveal that the equipment
was destined for the Venezuelan
Communists' paramilitary arm, the
Armed Forces of National Liberation
(FALN) «

d. The cache was found on 1
November on a beach in Falcon State
in the north, scene of the most -
active guerrilla effort. The Vene-
zuelan government assumes that the
weapons were sent from Cuba by sea.

e. Caracas will lay formal
charges concerning the arms cache
before a special meeting of Latin
America Foreign Ministers scheduled
for December,_ After that it will
ask that the Council of the Organi-
zation of American States be con-
voked for consultation on the matter.

that it is prepared to keep its two
ships involved in the trade from
calling at Cuban ports when their
charters run out next January.

ce. Papadakis is probably ask-
ing the same price for its action as
Basil Mavrolean did recently--removal
of its ships from the US blacklist.
Papadakis operates 19 ships totalling
more than 200,000 tons.

d. Mavrolean's vessels account
for almost half the present British
tonnage calling at Cuban ports and
are the largest single element of
free world shipping to Cuba.

e. The outcome of Mavrolean's
offer is not yet clear.

e, The feelers it put out
after the conclusion of the test-

some of the fraternal parties. They i

they did not write her script. They
would have said it is the Americans

A. South Vietnam Plans are now afoot to shuffle
South Vietnam's Corps commanders so that General
Khanh, considered by General Harkins to’ be the best
of the lot, will take over in the crucial delta (IV
Corps) area, General Dinh, the ambitious Minister
of Security, is still resisting pressure to relin-
quish command of the III Corps area, and is not in-
volved in the current shuffle,

B. Cuba-USSR There are about 8,000 Soviets in Cuba,
> of these military, according to a bloc offi-
cial in close touch with Soviets in Havana. The
figures are close to our own estimate of 4,000 to
7,000. Some withdrawals continue.
