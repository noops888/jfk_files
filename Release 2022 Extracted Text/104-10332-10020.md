Records

1. At its monthly meeting on 17 July the ARRB will be

addressing the issue of the Mexico City Station and its operation

in light of any deletions made by the Agency to protect sources

and methods.

The issues of greatest concern are those

surrounding the joint teltap operations run by the Agency(and the

Mexican Services, official acknowledgment of which could have an

impact on liaison and foreign relations. We therefore, wish to

maintain protection of this information.

2.

We are willing to release information which indicates

the existence of operational teltaps against the Soviet and Cuban

Embassies fas long as they appear unilateral and we can continue

to protect the existence of any participation of the Mexican

(Services. We are willing to release documents which indicate the

existence of Mexico City Station during times outside the window

which we have acknowledged when they contribute significantly to

the historical record.

These steps will be useful to the

WORKING PAPER

Notes from meeting w/ ARRB staff Sept. 11, 1995

ARRB Attendees: Marwell, Gunn, Mary + one

CIA Attendees : Barry, Ellie

Issue:

Inconsistency between Mexico City Chrono item

#132 and ARRB document #31

junn proposed that the Agency release the information ii

locument 31 that was released by mistake in the Mexico Cits

Chrono.

Otherwise, the staff would have to take the

document back to the ARRB for reconsideration which they

felt would undercut the credibility of the CIA and the

staff.

The Board will not uphold a postponement in a

specific document if that information is released by mistake

in another copy of the same document.

Ellie's response - because the information deals with Mex.

liaison, she will have to take their proposal to a higher

level. [response needed by 16 September]

They also requested a "new" highlighted version of the

Mexico City Chrono which reflects all information released

to NARA in the multiple copies of the Chrono and in the

documents referenced in the Chrono.

Issue:

The three documents of concern.

GIBSON - Ellje reviewed the Gibson issues--the fact that he

had denied in court his affiliation with the CIA, etc.

noted that since the document would not be included in the

determination list would the Board be willing to reconsider. "

Marwell said that we could make an addition pitch to the

Board to reconsider, but he did not think it would have any

effect on their decision.

PROENZA - Ellie explained that out goal here was to protect

the "asset" not the method and that the deletions could be

reduced to those words that could result in the

identification of the agent.

Marwell said

that the Board may reconsider based on the need

to protect a source.

Mary ask who was the asset? Was it LIRING?

Ellie said she did not know (it could have been some "AM"

source.

considered the issue of the

paragraph dealt with Oswald, voted to release. Mary said is

was hard to defend the individual released since she did not

have any information on the person.

We pointed out that the this release impacted on other

nothing to do with Oswald.

Marwell said the Board may re-look at the document as part

of looking at similar documents.

The issue of the taps on other Bloc embassies came up. Mary

said the Board was inclined to release given the end of the

Cold War.

[Note: we will locate as many of the "private line tap"

documents we can for special review]

Issue:

Removing the Proenza and Private line tap

documents form the formal notification list

Marwell clearly prefers not to do it at this time (said they

would discuss).

Has no problem with asking the Board to

reconsider or giving us the opportunity to presence

additional

evidence since their next meeting was within the

30 days set by the law, but felt that the Board was not

inclined to keep tabling documents that they had reached a

decision on.

Marwell asked if the Agency plans to "appeal"; he would like

a heads-up.

Later, in private. Marwell said that he wanted to build into

the process a loop that would handle these types of

situations.

Issue:

Presentation to Board at Sept. 20/21 meeting

It was agreed that "STATIONS" would be the focus of the

presentation -- 10:00 am, 20 Sept., one hour.

Marwell recommended providing evidence of bilateral

agreements as well as identifying current harm. Said that

the Board was

leaning strongly toward releasing stations.

Mary pointed out that there were still issues on the Mexico

City station window. There

are documents from the 50s,

references in summaries to the founding of the station and,

most important, the visit by the HSCA

¡ to Mexico City.

Ellie said there was the possibility of opening windows of

stations when Oswald was present, however, this was a key

issue for the Agency and a senior Directorate/Agency

decision.

She indicated that the Do would oppose expanding

the Mexico City window into the 70s.

As for the older documents, we pointed out that we had

already agreed to the release of those documents.

Marwell suggest that the 20 Sept. presentation would be a

good opportunity to address the Private uine and other tel

Taps issue rather than requesting a separate meeting.

After

• the meeting Marwell elaborated on the presentation.

He said to try a avoid going over old ground (US-Mexico

relationship; when possible provide specific/hard evidence

(bilateral agreements carry weight); war-stories did not go

over well and neither did Bill McNair. He emphasized the

importance of using

the language of the law.

Appeal of Unfavorable

Review Board (AIUO)

The JEK Assassination Records Review Board (Board) recently

released documents revealing the existence of CIA stations in

• a (joint tel-tapoperation

with (Mexican liaison, and the identity of a unilateral

penetration

It is the CIA's assessment

that such releases could seriously damage intelligence operations

as well as adversely affect the foreign relations of the United

States.

CIA is presently preparing an appeal of these rulings by

the Board and requests

the support of the Department of State

should these appeals be brought before the President. (S)

Additionally, the Board has just released the existence of

stations in:

and

and in March-April, it will be reviewing a document

that reveals the location of every CIA station in 1965. It is

anticipated that CIA will be preparing to appeal those releases

and requests State Department's assessment as to the damage to

foreign relations should the location of CIA stations be publicly

acknowledged. (S)

It remains essential that the U.S. Government stand by

assurances to persons and foreign governments that information

they provide

and activities they undertake based upon expected

confidentiality remain protected for as long as necessary. These

releases made by the Board seriously undermine the ability of CIA

to uphold secrecy obligations it took on in the past and to make

those assurances in the future. (C)

JFK Meeting today

After speaking with you tonight about the results of the meeting today, Jeremy Gunn called me and relayed his concerns about the

Board's understandings (or misunderstandings) of CIA's position. (Bob Caudle and I discussed what happened at the JFK meeting and

the following is our impression of what resulted. Basically,Edgendid not commit himself on any specifics on these issues, but expressed

his willingness to cooperate with the Board:

1.

Station (Edger was more willing to negotiate this one, but does not agree to its release. CIA wants to present more

information. Edger was not under the impression that this station was to be discussed today so he did not come prepared to present new

information on it. CIA should do this for the Board at the next possible opportunity.

Open Period for Stations Edgenagreed that the staffs of the Board and HRG should work out the exact time period. He had

no problem with the Sept 63-64/period and opening it up to oilin the Oswald file. He did not make any firm commitment on the dates to

the Board, saying that the staffs should come to an agreement on this.

3.

Substitutions for

Stations - Although Edgeh suggested

¿Station" as a substitution, he clearly prefered

something less revealing like A

European station 1, 2, etc.)". Using the former term has far less plausible deniability. The latter

option basically gives up what we want to protect.

Once HRG hears from Edger as to what his understandings are, then someone needs to speak with Jeremy Gunn ASAP on Tuesday

morning before the Board leaves. Jeremy said that unless we correct the Board on its mistaken impression about the above, they will

leave assuming we have come to an agreement and will refuse to revisit this at a latter date.

Let me know if you need me to help out in any way on this. FYl, I will be in meetings at 10AM and 2pm (Win Scott settlement

discussions!!!) tomorrow.

SUBJECT:

Release of JFK Documents

1. I understand the JEK AARB is presently considering the

release of documenta which would identify CIA stations to the

public. I am opposed in general to ravealing the locations of

our stations and would prefer instead to substitute the station

name with a regional designation, e.g. European Station vica

Brussels. I would be willing, however, to open certain stations

during a specific window of time if they are substantively

relevant to the assassination investigation and provided that the

documents in question are sanitized to conceal the permanent

presence of the station? (s)

2.

In all but a handful of instances, public acknowlodgment

of a station would be a political embarrassment to the host

government and would threaten ongoing sensitive operations and

liaison relationships.

In a few instancas, the damage probably

would be minimal or not at all as long as the presence appears to

be temporary.

I have surveyed the involved components and

determined the damage to national security which would follow

such release. (8)

3. I strongly urge that you not allow the information

regarding the Congo and

to be released. The Congo is now

Zaira and the station in the 60's would have been in

the last three years we have managed, with much effort, to begin

the establishment of good working relations with the host

station has recently begun some very sensitive and high-leval

bilateral oparations. Thase obviously depend upon the good will

of the host service.

citizenry came of age in an

atmosphere in which distrust of intelligence services in general,

That

distrust lingers in the public's mind oven today. Exposure of

activities during the Cold War will necessarily raise quastions

about our activities then, and almost certainly lead to further

The existence of

6.

Public acknowladgment of our stations in Managus,
