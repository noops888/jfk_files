WORKING PAPER

Notes from meeting w/ ARRB staff Sept. 11, 1995

ARRB Attendees: Marwell, Gunn, Mary + one
CIA Attendees : Barry, Ellie

Issue: Inconsistency between Mexico City Chrono item
#132 and ARRB document #31

Gunn proposed that the Agency release the information in
document 31 that was released by mistake in the Mexico City
Chrono. Otherwise, the staff would have to take the
document back to the ARRB for reconsideration which they
felt would undercut the credibility of the CIA and the
staff. The Board will not uphold a postponement in a
specific document if that information is released by mistake
in another copy of the same document.

Ellie's response - because the information deals with (Mex.
liaison, she will have to take their proposal to a higher
level. [response needed by 16 September]

They also requested a “new” highlighted version of the
Mexico City Chrono which reflects all information released
to NARA in the multiple copies of the Chrono and in the
documents referenced in the Chrono.

Issue: The three documents of concern.

{GIBSON - Ellie réviewéd the Gibson issues--the fact that he
had denied in court his affiliation with the CIA, etc. I
noted that since the document would not be included in the

determination list would the Board be willing to reconsider. :

Marwell said that we could make an addition pitch to the
Board to reconsider, but he did not think it would have any
effect on their decision.

PROENZA - Ellie explained that out goal here was to protect
the “asset” not the method and that the deletions could be
reduced to those words that could result in the
identification of the agent.

Marwell said that the Board may reconsider based on the need
to protect a source.

Mary ask who was the asset? Was it LIRING?

Ellie said she did not know (it could have been some “AM”
source.

SECRET


13-00000

SECRET

Mary ask for more information on LIRING.

“PRIVATE LINE TAP” - According the Marwell, the Board
considered the issue of the “private lines” but since the
paragraph dealt with Oswald, voted to release. Mary said is
was hard to defend the individual released since she did not
have any information on the person.

We pointed out that the this release impacted on other
documents which dealt with private line taps plus the Board
had not limited its release to the paragraph that mentioned
Oswald but releaséd the name in other calls which had
nothing to do with Oswald.

Marwell said the Board may re-look at the document as part
of looking at similar documents.

The issue of the taps on other Bloc embassies came up. Mary
said the Board was inclined to release given the end of the
Cold War.

(Note: we will locate as many of the “private line tap”
documents we can for special review]

Issue: Removing the Proenza and Private line tap
documents form the formal notification list

Marwell clearly prefers not to do it at this time (said they
would discuss). Has no problem with asking the Board to
reconsider or giving us the opportunity to presence
additional evidence since their next meeting was within the
30 days set by the law, but felt that the Board was not
inclined to keep tabling documents that they had reached a
decision on.

Marwell asked if the Agency plans.:to “appeal”; he would like
a heads-up.

the process a loop that would handle these types of
situations.

Issue: Presentation to Board at Sept. 20/21 meeting

It was agreed that. “STATIONS” would be the focus of the
presentation -- 10:00 am, 20 Sept., one hour.

Marwell recommended providing evidence of bilateral
agreements as well as identifying current harm. Said that
the Board was leaning strongly toward releasing stations.
Mary pointed out that there were still issues on the Mexico
City station window. There are documents from the 50s,

references in summaries to the founding of the station and,
most important, the visit by the HSCA to Mexico City.

Ellie said there was the possibility of opening windows of
stations when Oswald was present, however, this was a key
issue for the Agency and a senior Directorate/Agency
decision. She indicated that the DO would oppose expanding

the Mexico City window finto the 70s]

As for the older documents, we pointed out that we had
already agreed to the release of those documents.

Marwell suggest that the 20 Sept. presentation would be a
good opportunity to address the Private Line and other Tel
Taps issue rather than requesting a separate meeting.

After the meeting Marwell elaborated on the presentation.
He said to try a avoid going over old ground (US-Mexico
relationship; when possible provide specific/hard evidence
(bilateral agreements carry weight); war-stories did not go
over well and neither did Bill McNair. He emphasized the
importance of using the language of the law.

penetration_ > It is the CIA's assessment

that such releases could seriously damage intelligence operations
as well as adversely affect the foreign relations of the United

the Board and requests the support of the Department of State
should these appeals be brought before the President. (S)

Additionally, the Board has just released the existence of

and in March-April, it will be reviewing a document
that reveals the location of every CIA station in 1965. It is
anticipated that CIA will be preparing to appeal those releases
and requests State Department's assessment as to the damage to
foreign relations should the location of CIA stations be publicly
acknowledged. (S)

It remains essential that the U.S. Government stand by
assurances to persons and foreign governments that information
they provide and activities they undertake based upon expected
confidentiality remain protected for as long as necessary. These
releases made by the Board seriously undermine the ability of CIA
to uphold secrecy obligations it took on in the past and to make
those assurances in the future. (C)

FROM: Linda p

DATE: 03/18/96 06:24:14 PM
SUBJECT: JFK Meeting today

After speaking with you tonight about the results of the meeting today, Jeremy Gunn called me and relayed his concerns about the
Board's understandings (or misunderstandings) of CIA's position. (Bob CaudléSand | discussed what happened at the JFK meeting and
the following is our impression of what resulted. Basically/Edgandid not commit himself on any specifics on these issues, but expressed
his willingness to cooperate with the Board:

1. | Station (Eaiep was more willing to negotiate this one, but does not agree to its release. CIA wants to present more
information. (Edger was not under the impression that this station was to be discussed today so he did not come prepared to present new
information on it. CIA should do this for the Board at the next possible opportunity.

2 Open Period for Stations (Edggnagreed that the staffs of the Board and HRG should work out the exact time period. He had
no problem with the Septlest64/period ‘and opening it up tyfishn the Oswald file. He did not make any firm commitment on the dates to
the Board, saying that the staffs should come to an agreement on this.

3. Substitutions for en - Although €dgeysuggested { )Station” as a substitution, he clearly prefered

something less revealing like [European station 1, 2, etc.)". Using the former term has far less plausible deniability. The latter
option basically gives up what we want to protect.

~ Once HRG hears oc? ‘as to what his understandings are, then someone needs to speak with Jeremy Gunn ASAP on Tuesday

morning before the Board leaves. Jeremy said that unless we correct the Board on its mistaken impression about the above, they will
leave assuming we have come to:an agreement and will refuse to revisit this at a latter date.

Let me know if you need me to help out in any way on this. FYI, | will be in meetings at 10AM and 2pm (Win Scott settlement
discussions!!!) tomorrow.

Deputy Director for Operations

SUBJECT: Release of JFK Documents

1. I understand the JFK AARB is presently considering the
release of documents which would identify CIA stations to the
public. I am opposed in general to revealing the locations of
our stations and would prefer instead to substitute the station
name with a regional designation, e.g. European Station vica
Brussele. I would be willing, however, to open certain stations
during a specific window of time if they are substantively
relevant to the assassination investigation and provided that the
documents in question are sanitized{to conceal the permanent

2. %In all but a handful of instances, public acknowledgment
of a station would be a political embarrassment to the host
government and would threaten ongoing aensitive operations and
liaison relationships. In a few instances, the damage probably
would be minimal or not at all as long as the presence appears to
be temporary. I. have surveyed the involved components and
determined the damage to national security which would follow
such release. (8)

3. I strongly urge that uu not allow the information
regarding the Congo and to be released. The Congo is now

4, Within the context of our European presence, I have the
following comments:

~ Public acknowledgment would force the
government and liaison service to pay closer attention to
Station operations and therefore present a threat to ongoing
sensitive operations. (3)

- A neutral country. Public acknowledgment
of a CIA station would embarrass the government and liaison;
thereby inhibiting the close and productive liaison
relationships we now enjoy as well as presenting a threat to
ongoing sensitive operations. (8)

Paris - No additional damage. (8)

\

Bonn - No specific damaga. (S)
Berlin - No specific damage. (8)

~ Public acknowledgmant would embarrass the

cause a decrease in our operations. (8)

London - No specific damage. (8)
Ottawa - No specific damage. (8)

. 5. Our Eastern European stations pose a unique problem when
we considar public exposure. Station is recovering from
operating for almost fifty years in an undeclared status. During
the last three years we have managed, with much effort, to begin
the establishment of good working relations with the host
government and internal/external services. As a result, tha
station has recently begun some very sensitive and high-level
bilateral operations. Thesa obviously depend upon the good will
of the host service. The citizenry came of age in an
atmosphere in which distrust of intelligence services in general,
and the CIA in particular, was thoroughly ingrained. That
distrust lingers in the public's mind even today. Exposure of
our station's previously undisclosed presence and operational
activities during the Cold War will necassarily raise questions
about our activities then, and almost certainly lead to further

inquiry about our present relationship. It is doubtful that our
relationship, and certainly our very sensitive operations, could
withstand the resulting public’ debate. The existence of
Station, past and present, cannot be surfaced at this tima
without serious damage to national security. (S)

6. Public acknowledgment of our stations in Managua,
San Jose, Panama City, San Salvador, Santo Domingo, Buenos Aires,
Lima, Santiago, and Montevideo would not further damage our
operational capabilities in a specific sense. Overall, any
release of information about _a clandestine service breeds

7. We receive significant national collection syatema
support from which affects national system collection
efforts against Tier IA targets throughout Asia. We would
jeopardize this by releasing tha presence of our station to the

public. is a special case in that there is continuing
disagreement regarding our station. We should not. complicate the
current "Spy Mania" atmosphere in | There have been two
incidents regarding our presence in during the present ~

year. Any further disclosure’ would exacerbate the tension and
create an untenable operational atmosphere for our station and
pergonnel. (8)

7 8. Public acknowledgment of a station in would be a
problem for the U.S. Government. U.S. and foreign
relations are always delicate; the Government is very
sensitive to parceived slights to its national sovereignty, and
public acknowledgment. of a station would prove embarrassing to
the Government which in turn could ask that the station be
closed. If the station were closed or significantly downsized,
it would affect a larga number of important intelligenca

must call your attention to the general damage done to us by any
