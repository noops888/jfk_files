‘MEMORANDUM FGR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Guba TDY ~ Edvard G. Tichborn -(P) -

93
03 1. ‘On 12 January and 13 January I talked vith un Toamey)and
(Bob Raynenda)of 41 Diviaion to firm up details ra Tithborn's briefing here
om 15 January end re preparations for his trip to Cuba,

°

2. Re the briefing, it was decided that: {1) Mr. fase aa} will give
Subject a general briefing on the Cubsn political state on (the zajar one
will be undertaken, by the Staticn) (2) Subject will be given sanitized
copies of the Ferlongo (?) report ndia) Section IV, and of the repert
prepared. by:the Plans Branch/PP/PRD entitled "Target Study of Opposition
Groups in Guba" to be read by Subject whtle at the briefing and then returned
tous. Some observations on security will probably also be made at this
time in addition to instructions on the manner of keeping and subaitting his
financial eccounting. (It should. be mentimed here also that WH Finance/admin
cet) 4s of the opinion that since Tichborn will return to Washingtor
in about 2} weeks time, it is not necessary for him to submit his accounts
‘my mail, aince that can be taken ‘care of on his return.)

3, The problem which seemed to need most careful consideration was
that of his. cover while in Cuba, In talking to operational contacts he
makes there,the cover story suggested by the Station: in IN-47609 of 12 Nov.
1959 appears adequate.’ Hovever, according to Pan American Airways, upon
arrival in Havana the visitor is {ssued.a tourist card by the Cuban
Immigration authorities. One mst state his profession at this time, vhich :
should present no problem to Tichborn. It could be that one {s also asked
his reason for Ueing in-Cuba, In this case, WH has suggested that the
answer .of-Ptourist” would be best since less suspicion would be placed on
Subject in the beginning. Thé importent aspect, howaver,. appears to be
that of covering Tichborn as well as possible in the event that he rms
afoul of the Cuban authorities due to the nature of his activities and his
contacts. I brouglit this matter up with WH and they agreed that one kind
of backstopping might te a good idea. as a result, I contacted Mr. Strange
cf Cover Division vho assured me that, if ne~assary, an appropriate letter

could be provided Tichborn from 4 cover uThe one finally decid

Mr. Strange suggested that if thio-procedure be folloved, Subject should
‘hea Le given tira nameof the branch offica rather than the one in :
Philadelphia, Mr. (Todiey) suggested tho wording of euch a letter (the basic
Adea of which would be {for Subject to combine business with pleasure) which
Iwill urite up (ir egreed upon dy 4C/PAD/YP) in final draft, and Cover
Division will then transfer-1t to the. appropriate letterhead. However, I:
advised both Mr 2(founey)and Mr.. Strange thut before gcing into this zatter
further, I would have to check this whole matter out with you on 14 January.

4. As far as finencing 4s concerned, Mr. souse jof WH is taking care
of this matter and as of 13 January, the request for the advance ($2,000)
has been approved, The request for one-half of Tichbora's salary, ($¢50)
must avait approval util Subject has ‘aigned the'amendzent to his contract
(which was received by this office on today's date). as per your suggestion,
Mr. Strange has agreed to-provide payment af Tichborn by @ check drasn
on the cover company to be deposited with Subject's bank. (I guess the
final decision on thie will depend on how Subject vents the mney, ubether.
a bank deposit or cash.) If done through the cover compsay and sent to
Tichborn's bank, ve should allow at least four or five days for the
deposit to be made, depending upon the speed of the postal system,
