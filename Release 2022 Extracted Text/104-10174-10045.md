3:

The problen which seaned to need most careful consideration was

that of his cover while in Cuba.

In taliing to operational contacts be

makes there, the cover story suggested by the Station In IN-47609 of 12 Now.

according to Pan American Airways, upon

arrival In Havana the visitor is Issued a tourist card by the Cuben

Iumigration authoritios.

One rust state his professdon at this time, which

should present no problem to Iichborn.

It could be that one is also asked

In this case, Wi has suggested that the

answer.ofuPtourist? vould be best since less suspicion would be placed on

Subject in the beginning.

The impotant aspect, however, appears to be

that of covering Tichborn as well as possible in the event that he runs

coptacts.

Mr. (Toomey) suggested the wording of such a lotter (the basd

Iichborn's bank, wa should allow at least four or five days for the

deposit to be made, depending upon the spood of the postal system.
