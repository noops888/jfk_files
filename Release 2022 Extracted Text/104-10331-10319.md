the Assassination Records Review Board, I called retired CIA
employee Ann L. Goodpasture today, }Her phone no. iยง-2]4

4198; address is 4719-B Skillman Ave., Dallas, Texas;
7. The reason for the cali was to advise her that Gunn
planned to contact her to arrange an interview about the
Kennedy assassination. Fred Wickham, DO, had agreed that I
make the call.

2. I explained to Ms. Goodpasture the role of the
Board and the purpose of the interview, and offered to
provide any assistance. She said that she would be willing
to be interviewed, but did not recall the details of events
around the time of the assassination. She asked that she
receive an official statement from CIA releasing her from
her secrecy agreement for purposes of the interview, which I
agreed to obtain.

Washington in November and could be available for the
interview then. She will call me when her plans are firm.

4. I relayed the above to Gunn, who said that he would
call Goodpasture sometime in the next two days.
