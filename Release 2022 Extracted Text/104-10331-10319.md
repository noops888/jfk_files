FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

NOTE FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: JFK Board/Ann Goodpasture

1.

At the request of Jeremy Gunn, General Counsel of

the Assassination Records Review Board, I called retired CIA

employee Ann L. Goodpasture today. Her phone no. is-214-.

The reason for the call was to advise her

planned to contact her to arrange an interview about the

Kennedy assassination. Fred Wickham, DO, had agreed that I

make the call.

2.

I explained to Ms. Goodpasture the role of the

Board

and the purpose of the interview, and offered to

provide any assistance. She said that she would be willing

to be interviewed, but did not recall the details of events

around the time of the assassination. She asked that she

receive an official statement from CIA releasing her from

her secrecy agreement for purposes of the interview, which I

agreed to obtain.

3.

Ms. Goodpasture said that she had plans to visit

Washington in November and could be available for the

interview then.

She will call me when her plans are firm.

I relayed the above to Gunn, who said that he would

call Goodpasture sometime in the next two days.
