New Note

NOTE FOR: dwadP-Moleitl@ pci

FROM: ‘.
DATE: 02/27/95 06:02:46 PM
SUBJECT: JFK Records f

This is in response to your request that | review ASAP the proposed regulations by the JFK
Assassination Records Review Board.

I see Sheryl Walters hand very much in evidence here. | see from the attachment that she is the Board's
GC. -

Like you, | am very concerned about the breadth of the reg's definitions. The key to keep in mind is the
statutory authority for the Board. | would argue that the definition of “assassination record” in the statute
(44 U.S.C. section 2107 note; section 3(2) of the Act) is more limited than the reg. The statute defines an
assassination record as one “related” to the assassination of JFK. Thus, when section 1400.2:(d) and (e)
of the reg authorize Board access to organizational charts of governmental agencies and records ~
necessary and sufficient to describe the agency's records policies and schedules, filing systems and
organization, and storage facilities and locations, | would argue that such information is way too far afield.
There is no way we-can allow the Board to have access to this information, which in any event is.
prohibited by section 403g from disclosure notwithstanding any other law.

The same issue arises with respect to section 1400.7(d) of the reg that proposes to include in the
definition of record any records for a person by another name or personal identifier. This would appear to
authorize Board access to ail information about an agent who may have only been tangentially involved in
the assassination but whose crypt is given in many other unrelated documents about unrelated
operations. Talk about your camet's nose under the tent!

Finally, section 1400.5 of the reg raises an old dog of an issue. The National Security Archive (Sheryts:

old employer) has been fighting for a lang time in FOIA litigation that the FOIA refers to records and that

therefore all information in a responsive record must be released unless otherwise exempt. There is no

FOIA exemption, they argue, for non-responsive material in a record. This is a big problem for mutti-topic
documents, such as the NID. We, of course, argue that agencies are only required to process that which
is asked for and delete non-responsive material as unrequested. The proposed reg would mean that the
Board would have access to all information in a document about several unrelated operations or events if
that document even mentioned the assassination or anything related to it. Again, the camef's nose.

SUBJECT

1. Attached for your review and comment is a copy of
proposed regulations prepared by the JFK Assassination i.

The possibility of requiring additional records searches is
raised.

2. The Board plans to discuss the regulations at its
next meeting on 6-7 March, so it would be helpful to give
the Board our input in advance of that meeting. Please
provide en | Harrelson (x30292) or me (230373) with your
comments by 1 March.

” The President John FiKonnedy .
Assacsination Records Colléction Act of
1992, 44 U.S.C, 2107 note (as amended}
(ARCA). establishod the President Jobn
F. Kennedy Assassination Records .
Collection (the JFK Collection) at the
Nauonal Archives and Records tee
Administration (NARA). In establishing
the process for public disclosure of all
records relating to the essescina tion,
Congress created an independent agency
within the executive branch, the
Assassination Records Review Board
(the Board), which consists offive — .
citizens appointed by the President.
Under the statute, the Board is
empowered to deuide “whether e record
constitutes an assassination record.” 44
USC 2107 note, Sec. 712A).
Congress fusther made clear its intent
that the Board “issae guidance to assist
it lating the scope or universe of
tion records.” President Joho

In constructing the i
set But here, the Board seeks to

* Implement congressional intent that the

JFK Collection contain “the most
comprehensive disclosure of records.
related to the assassination of Presidont
Kennedy,” Id. at 18. The Board is also
mindful of Congress’s instruction that
the Board apply a “broad and
encompassing” working definition of
“assassination record” in order to
achieve the goal of assembling the
fullest historical secord an this tragic
event in American history and on the
investigauons that wore undertaken in-
the assassination’s aftermath. The Board
recognizes that many agencies have
slreudy begun to orgunize and review
records responsive (o the ARCA even
before the Buard was appointed and
began its work. Nevertheless, the
Board's aim is that this guidance will
aid in the ultimate ussombly and public

into it.

The Dourd’s preposed guidance ts

_ designed to help government agencies

and the Board identify and make
available to the public all documonte
that will enhance, enrich, and broaden
the historical record of the assassination
of Prosidont John F. Kennedy. The
Duard souks through this guidance to
fulfill Congross's “inton{t] and emphasis
that the search and disclosure of records
turdur thts Act must go bayond™ the
records of previous commissions and
Coramittevs ustablished to Investgato

21. The Board also soeks to provide
notice of the scope of its intended
exercise of authurity ta soek additional
information or secords in ordor to fulfill
its functions and responsibilitios under
the ARCA.

In addition, the Board proposes to
create a mochanism to facilitate the
Board's ongoing work and to further
ensure future public access to the fl
broadest possible historical record. This
mechanism will be known us the
“Catalog of Assassination Records"
{COAR). The COAR is intended to be an
