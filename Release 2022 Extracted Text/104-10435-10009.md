Garrison Investigation of Kennedy Assassination:
Francisco Antonio BARTES Clarens (201-289885),

20 November 1967. eee

(2) Involvernent in Garrison's investigation:
None known to date. His former position as head of
the Cuban Revolutionary Council (CRC) in New Orleans
and bie earlier tie to Lawrence LABORDE and others
in respect to guerrilla training for anti-Castro Cubane
has already, however, been drawn to Garrison's attention.

(3) [DDP and DGS relationships:

Z
a) |/DDP. Although a POA for use ta
JMATE was requested on 2) December 1960 and
granted 30 January 1961, the request was cancelled
on 30 August 1941, and BARTES was not used
during this interval. (Per JMWAVE 0483,

4 December 1957.) On 27 May 1965 SOD/AB/OPS/3
reguested a POA to permit the use of BARTES as a
pilot in the Congo, The POA was granted on

20 July 1965, and an OA on 9 September 1965.
Testing of Subjects skill as a pilot revealed, howeve.
that he was not qualified for the intended assignment.
He wae returned to the U.S. on il February 1966
without having been used operationally.

(b) DCS.) The firat contact of DCS New
“Orleans with BARTES occurred on 4 May 1961.

Between that date and 9 Jancary 1967 a total of
23 meetings took place. BARTSS is the source of
six DCS reports. Contact hag not been terminate

b. George BROWN.

(1) Prior references: None.

2) \Involvement in Garrison investigation: A _ |
DCS Housten report of 27 December 1967 states that

George BROWN received a disturbing telephone call on

22 December 1987 from Hugh AYNESWORTH of Newsweek,
whe gaid that Bill “Gervags" (Comment: Presumably
identicel with Willlam H. GURVICH) had indicated that



Garrison may try to implicate BROWN in the
“avsaseination plot”, "The allegation ie that in some
unspecified manner Brown was involved with the CIA
in its objective of ‘covering up ' the ‘conspiracy! for
Preatdent Johnson. Aynesworth sald Gervage bas
documents, including at least one in Garrison's own
handwriting, which presumably have been extracted
from Garrison's flles.

that BROWN has cooperated closcly with CIA in funding
operations. Checks are under way.

(2) Involvernent in Garrison's investigation:
None known to data. During the week 21-23 Decomber
1967 several U.S. newspapers reported that on 20
December Garrison's office had accused one Edgar
Eugene BRADLEY of North Hollywood, California, of
conspiring to assassinate President Kennedy. On 27
December he was arraigned on a fugitive complaint and
released on his own recognizance. Extradition ia currently
moot. There is no CIA record of Edgar Eugene BRADLEY.
On or about 20 December 1967, however, the Washington
bureau of the Los Angeles Times rade an inquiry of the
A/DGI regarding Leslie Norman BRADLEY. The Newsweek
iseue of 8 January 1968 speculated that Garrison might
kave confused Edgar Eugene with either of two other mon,
one of whom is". . . 3 sometime New Orleane pilot
named Bradley who was once jailed in Cuba for anti-Castro
activities." This description fits Leslie Norman BRADLEY.

Ramparts of January 1968, p. 47, states that a former
Minuteman named Jerry Milton BROOKS had said that
BANISTER was the “head of the Anti-Communism League
of the Caribbean." Ramparts asserts that this "league"
was “assertedly an intormediary between the CIA and
Caribbean insurgency movements."

clearly indicates that GATLIN was the sole member of
