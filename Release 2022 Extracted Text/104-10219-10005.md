MISSION, INCLUDING PROCESSING THE FILM.

AT THIS TIME ME MAS DESCRIBED

AS BEING "CONSCIENTIOUS, LOYAL, HARDHORKING AND DEDICATED. "

IN 1957

HE HAS GIVEN FIVE WEEKS OF CLANDESTINE OPS TRAINING IN THE HOS-ARER,

BEING DESCRIBED BY HIS TRAINER AS MORE @PRO-AMERICAN THAN MEXICAN. ".

PIA FOR THE KDFACTOR ACTIVITY, WHICH PROVIDED SURVEILLANCE AND PHOTO

COVERAGE OF THE SOVIET TARGET.

AT THE TIME OF TERMINATION, HIS

= CONTRACT AGENT SALARY HAD INCREASED TO 57000 PER ANNUM.

SIGNIFICANTLY

EXCEPT FOR GIVING ENGLISH

LESSONS AND OTHER MINOR COVER ACTIVITIES.

GERENDE WAS CONSIDERED TO BE A FULLOTIME RIACTION EMPLOVEE.

- НЕ

SERVING AS LP KEEPER AND TRANSCRIBERITRANSLATOR OF.

AN AUDIO OPERATION,

INVOLVEMENT

CUBAN MISSION AND CUBAN EXILE GROUPS,

GENERAL OPS SUPPORT, AND SPOTTING AND ASSESSMENT:

ON 8 OCT 1963,

GERENDE SUCCESSFULLY PASSED AN SESHIRL, ALTHOUGM IT EMERGED THAT:HE

MAD NOT ACCOUNTED FOR ALL FUNDS PASSED TO HIM (THE STATION DISMISSED

THIS PROBLEM) AND FELT THAT HE WAS BEING UNDEREMPLOYED BY RTACTICA.

CONCERNING THE LATTER CHARGE, THE STATION SEEMS TO HAVE HAD PROBLEMS

THROUGHOUT THE 1960'S KEEPING GERENDE FULLY OCCUPIED, SINCE FOR

CEEDING AND FIGHT FOR THE CUSTODY OF THEIR THREE CHILDREN.

DECEMBER 1969 GERENDE WAS. PUT ON HALF PAY AND HAD MIS OPS

DUTIES

SUSPENDED BY THE STATION BECAUSE OF HIS FULL-TIME INVOLVEMENT IN

LEGAL MATTERS SURROUNDING THE DIVORCE.

ON 26 JUNE 1970 GERENDE AND

LIEMPTY-TO SIGNED QUIT CLAIMS AND SECRECY AGREEMENTS.

GERENDE WAS

PAID 510, 00O AND LIEMPTY-19 52500. AS TERMINATION BONUSES. AND THE

PAYMENTS

WERE MADE ON A MONTULY BASIS SO THAT THE STATION MOULD MAVE

SOME CONTROL OVER THE TWO AND THEREBY KEEP THEIR RTACTIDA STATUS

FROM EMERGING DURING THE DIVORCE PROCEEDINGS.

ON 8 JULY 1970

LIEMPTY-JO UNEXPECTEOLY APPEARED AT HAS IN AN ATTEMPT TO GET A LARGER

FINAL INSTALLMENT OF

TERMINATION BONUS.

AND RENTING HIS HOUSE TO STATION STAFFER

THERE

HAS NO INDICATION THAT EITHER GERENDE OR HIS WIFE HAD VIOLATED THEIR

SECRECY: AGREEMENTS. STATEMENT. MAS MADE THAT HE NO LONGER APPEARED

ТО ВЕ

5.

IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT GERENDERS AGENT SERVICE RECORD

QUALIFIES RECOMENDATION FOR MIS REUSE BY SAYING THAT ME SHOULD HAVE

SUFFICIENT OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT INCOME TO OBVIATE THE NEED FOR FULL

TIME RTACTION EMPLOYMENT, AND HAVE RESOLVED HIS PERSONAL PROBLEMS.

IT WOULD APPEAR THAT EXCEPT FOR A POSSIBLE ROLE IN SERVICING SPECIFIC

OPS SUPPORT TASKS, GERENDE OFFERS LITTLE POTENTIAL FOR THE STATION.

SUGGEST THAT THE

STATION MAY WISH TO DISCUSS GERENDE WITH THEODORE

tract agent ho has been employed by he Agency 1n Mexico

City Bince 18 barch 1955 under an NOC, during which time

he has served this igency well..

During the past fifteen

responsibilition and placed on ball salary in Decenber 1969.

3.

In March of 1970, Mexico City Station docided

that GERENDE's personal problems were not being resolved,

and because of the continuing security threat; plans vere

made to terminate both GERONDE and his vife by

the end of

FY 1970.

The LiEMPTY Project reneval, approved in May

1970, was amended to include a termination bonus for

GERENDS Of $10,000 for 15 years of service with the Agency,

and in addition approval was roceived to pay Hrs. GERENDE

tho sua of $2,500 as a security neasure designed to keep

her fron revealing her husband's drency affiliation and

what she knous about Agency operationg in Hexico..

Thig

mination bonuses to both GERINDE and his wile be pald on

& monthly baalg rather than ln one lump sun as a security

measure to assure at least an elomont of control over

both individuals, slace the continued recolpt of these

monthly paynonta depanded on their loyalty to the agency.

MENORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: GERENDE's Wife's Visit to Washington

1.

On 6 July 1970, Mr. Walt Raymond of the CA

Staff

advised that GERENDE's wife was in Washington

and had been in touch with him.

Apparently Mr.

Ramond and GERIDE's wife had been acquainted.for

some time in the past. Neither admits that Mr. Raymond

is an Agency employee.

GERENDE's wife advised that

she wanted to get in

touch with someone in Agency

Headquarters.

Mr. Raymond advised her he would contact

his liaison people to see what could be done.

2.

DIRECTOR 048632 was sent to the Station out-

lining this and requesting Station's advice as to

whether a Headquarters representative should meet with

GERENDE's wife.

MEXICO CITY 3612 (IN I17477) outlined

details of the termination of GERENDE and his wife and

recommended against seeing her.

I discussed this matter briefly with

3 Legal Counsel's Office, who felt even if Station

should recommend seeing GERENDE and his wife, that it

would be limited to WH Division representation.

On

7 July I advised Mir. Raymond of the Station's answer

as contained in MEXICO CITY 3612.

He said he would

contact GERENDE's wife approximately 8:30 of the evening

of. 7 July, and

tell her that his liaison contact had

been unable to find anyone who would see her.

Mr. Raymond

was uncertain as to what GERENDE's wife might do.

The Station's position

with GlInde from the

start has been

that he must agree io an anicablo setticment with

his wife in order to insure that she would not foel forced to take

steps which would jeopardize the gecurity of Station operations.

For this reason, the station insisted fion the beginning that any

financial sottlement with his wife would have to take into account

the fact that he was recciving a certain salary fron knock, and

that he could not fairly keep this salary out of the settlement on

the grounds that his wife could maic no lezal claim to that

salary, GERiNDE's wile was made aware of our position on this, and

she was fateful, even though she realized that this arrangement

was strictly informal.

The Station felt that GERLNDE could not be

allowed to uso his KVROCK salary as a weapon in the disputc with his

wife; because if he did, she could hardly be expocted to refrain

exposing his conneetions. Indeed, events have shown that

inclined to sive GERINDE'S wife (LIE:ITY-19) the benefit of the

procrastinate, even when his marriage was at stake).

she could tell her lawyer about GRaDE's salary.

She was told

she could not mention the KVROCK portion under any circumstances,

and that if she told anyone that GRENE bad any connection with

LINPURE,

the connection would be denied and GERINDE would be

terminated.

She appeared to accept this gracefully, even though it

meant she would have to scale her support desands down to the

level of GERENDE's overt income (GaliDE's nonthly salary fron

RVROCK was over 7,000 pesos; he carned an additional 4 to 5,000 pesos

teaching English,

and he has since rented their house, for which

ho is receiving slightly. less than 7,000 pesos monthly).

Subsequently, LIEMPTY-19 was told that the Station would see to it

The complicating

factor is the uncertainly of GERINDE's future with RRUCK.

The

Station has maintainod for sone

tine that it is impossilic to

continue to pay GRINDE his full salary solely torun the LICALL

and LILYRIC basehouses.

Now that

has absorbed this duty

with only small inconvenience and gone loss of timeliness, lt nakes

even less sense to put GEPENDE to work only to do this.

CERENDE

has long been aware of the Station's thinking in this regard, and

prior to the current peroonal crisis he had been told that he

would have to work harder at a creater variety of tasks in order

to retain his position. As Headquarters is avare, he had been

reputation for boing Inzy was oarned years ago.

The question which

must be answered is whether or

not to terminate GURUNDE.

He can be useful to the Station, but

the station has learned to got along without hin.

What are the

security hazards involved?

The fencral range of

his knowledge is

described in paragraph 5 of reference.

the loss to the Station, particularly in terns of support operations

against the MIHARSH target, would be considerable. The Station

does not beliove that GülENDE would deliberately exposo any of this,

abut it is impossiblo to predict what LIENPTY-19 might do, particularly

since she would feel that she had nothing to lose,

termination bonus would probably be in the neighborhood of tẹn

thousand dollars: Presumably LIEMPTY-19. is avare of the fact that

he would get such a bonus, although the Station has never discussed

this with her and the possible division of such a bonus between the

two of them has never been nentioned.

during the reporting period on all activity centered on the front

As an example of the value of LILTRIC coverage, within one week of

affecting all of lexico, with new numbers bearing no relation to

the old), LILYRIC had provided a complete list of the new numbors

this enabled the Station to identify AESEASICK!s

After spending the month in South:

much

enjoyed her solitude.

We had alrrady talked about divorce before

her trip to Hollard in the spring. I had told her that I would not

corsider parting with the children and she said she would consider

leaving them to me if I would settle the dot to her father as well

as give her a sibstantia! share of what she considered was her part

of the house.

The title of the house was in my name and had been

since the buying of the laid. LIEPTY-19said I could no:tgage or

sell the house but that the money was what she was mainly intercsted

I. told her that the sale of the house vas not finarcially

wise in its unfinished state and that the house and land are very

Iskely to appreciate sharply over the next three or four years

considering the housing developments going on in the area.

Added

to this was the sentimental attachment to the house an area.

plus what she was asking, was sonething I could not afford considering

the more than 12 percent cost of such a mortgage in lexico.

These Chille's

not been pressed

since they were orlalnally nude on 13 lovenber

1969 by LITIPTY-19.

The ruling, on those charges, should the

case come to trial, must be made by three judges

of the 2ª Curte

Penal composed of the 4th, Sth, and 6th Juzgados Penales. . The

judgo of the Go Juzgrdo is Lic. QUIRIZCO, an alunnus of

GERINDE'S Lawycr,

JOrIC MarIO MAGALION.

Torother they have,

on two occasions,

been to speak to Judgo CRuz lollado who

agrced not to issue an ariest warrant and who has, firally,

called for a hearing on 16 March (suusequently postponed)

at

10:00.

MAGALLON haS given GERIDE assurances that the charges

are likely to be disnissed.

b. Fraud - this charge was unde by LIHlPTY-19 and her

lawyer on 11 December 1969, tho dậy after GERBiDE left the

Villa Obregon Jail aftor having spont a weel: there for

disoboying a court ordcr.

(The court order had consisted of

an unfounded request to have GERIDE expolled from his houso

and to have LIEIITY-19 reinstated there with her father, as

the temporary custodian of the childien. GERFIDE refused them

admisson under those terms, bence disobeying the Villa Obregon

judgo's order, so the judgo's secrotary arbitrarily ordered,

ong the spot,

a lO-day detention.

subsequently, the judge,

LUCAS del ARENAL, was forced to lift the detention after seven

days and dismiss hinself from the case and divorco proceedings

as incompotont. The judge has had to face charges of

collusion from and with

the lawyers of both partics, 1.e.

Alagallon and Jurado.

The chargo of fraud rests at desa 31a

of the Procuraduria del Distrito Federal.

The Public Ministry

Agent in charge of that table is Jorge GUTIERKEL Cruz.

LIEMPTY-19 claims that the money lent to her and GERENDE for

building the house at ladera #39 was actually loaned to buy

the house and that GrENdE, knowing they were carried under

tho separate proporty marriage clause ld wrongfully placed

tho property in his name only, thereby committing fraud.

Actually,

the land was bought

by GERbiDE before Christnas 1965

sna complicated transaction involving three other partners:

Robert Bancroft HHIT&HOUSE, John (Dick) RENNA, and Janes

Halter HURLEY, and each of

the partners placed the property

in their respective names with the complete knowledge of their

spouses.

Later the land was subdivided and after nineteen

months the deeds were issued.

LIEITY-19 supervised and prodded

the notary who made the transaction and she was perfectly aware

that the property was in GIREDE's name.

In August 1967 when

construction of the house began, LIE:PTY-19's father's noney

was used which he had deposited

in Mexico for the purpose.

Since January 1969, according to the terms of the loan

agreement, GERENDE has been paying it off and has receipts frOm

LIEPTY-19 to show for it.

GRENDE has presented both the land deed ("escritura")

pre-dating the construction.of the house and the receipts

Ehowing up to date payaent of the loan at the "resa 31ª."

No further action bas been

taken by LInTY-ly or her laujer

on this matter but tie charre has not iinally been settled and

15 still fending.

The charge 1s,

of course, unfounded and is

awaiting the proper "lubrication" in order to be filed aray.

c.

Neglect - this charge was made by LIEPTY-19 in

Decenher 1969 at the 7° Jugado Mixto de Pa- claining

that

GERRiDE had abandoned LiS!PTY-19 and the children to their fate

and that they wore utterly destitute.

GERINDE was not

notified of this charge and on 9 February after attending a

bearing at the Villa Obregon jugado (see belon), once out on

the sidewalk, Judicial police agents detained GETENDE, took

bira to the Procuraduria and frm there to Lecumberri.

This

process involved being finger-printed and mugged.

The

following day GERMiDE was out on a 2,000 pesos bond and three

days later, 13 February, the justice of the peace (a woran)

fornally set GERINDE free for lack of evidonce.

Magallon went back on s larch to pick up the bond money and

see if

had appealed but he had not and, apparently,

Cong on na.

that natter is closed.

6. On 14 Novembor 1969, one day after LIEPTY-19 disappeared

from

hose taking the children with her, GERaiDE brought charges

against ber for minor lesions and showed redical proo! thereof.

Tho hearing of 9 February after which GENUIDE was detained, ras

called by villa Chregon judge Bonfilio SiGURI.

GERINDE reiterated

the charge, LIENPTY-19 denied it, the judge ruled against her,

ordered ber to prison but since the injuries vere minor,

not require privation of liberty and she must only go and sign-in

once a week.

7. LIEWPTY-19 1s at present teaching school at the Edron

Academy on Caleri Street in San Angel Inn.

The two older children

are going to school thero.

During the latter part of November, all

December and half of January, the children did not attend any

school.

On three occasions GERINDE has been to the school at 13:30

to try

to speak to LIEAPTY-19 and see the children.

LIEPTY-19

has objected to this and the meetings tave been short and fruitless

except

for GRINDE learning that they are still staying at the Dutch

Ambassador 's.

GEKENDE's last visit there was on 3 March (Tuesday).

8.

After the Villa Obregon judge disnissed hinself from the

divorce proceedings, according to standard procedure,

to reside at the Ist Juzgado Civil in the D.f.

The judge is Olda

CORREA (sonan) and has the reputation of being tough and pretty

straight.

Since LIEMPTY-19 has not given an address where divorce

suit papers can be served her, the suit has not yet been initiated

on GERENDE's part.. LIENPTY-19, on the otherland, has not had

ACTION CITRID - REIS FREES

ACTION REQUIRED: For Your Information

REFERENCE

: HMNA-37623, 1 August 1969 (Inst Progress Report)

1.

Althougs this report migat normally be subritted one nonth

from now, the use of oliver G. SCANTLING tas shiftod sufficiently

to varrant a special report at this time.

our next progress leport

will be submitted for the period 1 October through 31 December un-

less exceptional circunstances

justify another chango.

2.

Tho fundamental change in the use of SCANTLING (who bas

suifered the post six wecks from paratyphoid) is that he has been

divorced fron routino cut-out operations and will henceforth bo

used foi priority tasks and taigets which will better utilize lis

proven talents.

First,

in late September ZARBOCK took over LICASA-1

for diroct handling.

The LICASA oparation offered no particulir

challenge to SCASTLING and it is doubtful that his intermediary role

offered any particular additional security in this caso.

In fact,

if & flap should ever develop in this case SCANTLING would just add

one more local who would have to ba extricated from the tongs of the

GOM.

Second,

it has been decided that SCANTLING will very soon turn

LIANVIL-l over to Raymond GERENDE.

The details are presently being

worked out.

In line with our decision to use SCANTLING for re-

, cruitment efforts principally (and less so for routine agent handling)

he is presently preparing for a recruitment attempt against Subject 'of

* MEXICO CITY-1502.

When that operation is completed he will be tar-

geted against the MIllARSh target both through a commercial outlet of

the Bloc and through various clubs and sports centers where he may

have access to IMARSil types.

Aside fron these responsibilities,

vill be used as needed in other recruitment situntions especially in

support of a ne surveillance team.

WH/CONTRACTS

Recommendation to Amend the Contract of

Raymond H. GERENDE (Contract Agent)

Include Improved Termination Benefits

and a Salary Increase

1.

During the past year Mexico City Station has

submitted several dispatches recommending that paragraph

11 of Subject's contract be amended to include ree benefits

in the event of Subject's termination and'or resignation

from. Agency service.

These Station recommendations have

been carefully reviewed by C/WH/Contracts and a Menorandum

was forwarded to C/WH/l containing guidance on the suggested

contract amendment.

The above information has been reviewed again by

AC/WH/1, and we

are requesting approval for the following

amendments to paragraph ll of Subject's contract:

A) Iu the event of GERENDE's termination by the

Agency he will receive three mönth's pay plus one

month's pay for every full year of service since

18 March 1955, calculated at the rate applicable at

the time of termination.

B) In the event of resignation and/or voluntary

retirement upon 60 days notice the following schedule

would be acceptable to the Agency as being in its best

interests and a payment considered as a terminal payment

as follows:

(1)

Less than 15 years service (prior to March

1970) 20 days pay for each full year of service.

(2) : Over 15 years service, but less than 20

years service (prior 18 March

1975) three nonths

salary plus 20 days pay for each full year of service.

SECRET,

SEGLET.

(3) Over 20 years service, three months

salary plus one month's pay for each full year

service.

(4) All payments above are to be calculated

at the rate of pay applicable at the time of

retirement and/or resignation.

3.

As to the points raised by WH/Contracts in their

Memorandum concerning this amendment we would like to note

the following:

A). GERENDE

is a Mexican citizen,

working for the

Agency since 18

March 1955 under an MOC, who considers

himself to

be a "career" employee of the Agency, and

whose initial local employment for cover purposes was

largely notional under a system

of "ghost payrolling".

GERENDE received no income or benefits from this "cover"

position which terminated due to the demise of the

company on 31 December 1967. GERENDE's other "cover"

is self generated in that he gives English lessons in

his spare time to middle management Mexican nationals

employed by American owned companies in Mexico City.

His income benefits from

this

"cover" are minimal, but

suffice for satisfying acquaintances as to the source

of his income.

In conclusion, GEKENDE is considered by

the Station to be a full time contract agent,

on call

at all times for operational activity.

Any other local

benefits which may accrue to him by the virtue of his

being a Mexican citizen should not, we feel, be a concern

of this Agency given the above circumstances of his employ-

ment with us.

This Branch is of the belief that the resignation

and/or retirement schedule outlined in paragraph 2, B above

provides career benefits for GERENDE in the event that he

must resign and/or retire in the event of unforseen personal

circumstances.

It additionally rewards nim for his loyalty.

of service, and at the same time provides him with incentive

to remain in Agency service for the additional financial

benefits that will accrue to him providing both future

security and incentive.

## Page 98

SECTET

5.

During the past two years GERENDE has served as

a principal agent handler for a sensitive fixed sur-

veillance project; has carried out unilateral recruitment

approaches

against the Cuban target; has been

used in

special support investigations; and is presently being

considered for use

in special

operations of a sensitive

nature.

A review of the progress reports in GERENDE'S

operations discloses that the Station has been more than

satisfied with GERENDE's performance and is anxious to

take advantage of his full potential. GERENDE's last

salary increase from $6,000 to $6,500 per annum was granted

in July 1965, and there have been no increases since.

Since the Field Station/ Headquarters negotiation over

amendment of paragraph ll of GERENDE's contract has been

in progress for over

one year and a hall, we are of the

belfef

that the Station wished to finalize this amendment

prior to requesting a salary increase for the agent.

It

18 theretore requested, considering the above, that approval

be given for a salary increase from $6,500 to $7,000 ef-

lective l August 1969, and that his contract be so amended.

The Field Station will be queried for their approval via

cable prior to implementation of the contract amendment.

Raviond He GRINDE's Cover Status

ACTION RIQUERED - REIERINCES

In preparing a recent request for an

amendment to Raymond

H. GERINDE's contract, it occurred to us that it would probably be

useful to bring Headquarters up-to-date on GERiNDE's cover status.

As a full-time contract agent, GEKENDr is on call at all times sor

operational activity.

His cover activity not only proviles hin with

the necessary flexibillty, it is also solid enough to provide hiu

with a plausible explanation of his existence and his incono.

öt English,

GERINDE has two major cover activities. One is the teaching

mainly to middle-managenent personnel of American-owned

In sexico City.

This is done on a regular basis for a few

OSRA

-hours each day and carns GERUNDE an income of about 5000 pesos per

His second cover activity, and one which is largely a cover

and not really activity,

is working as a salesnan for IDiN A.

GERINDE

actually earns only about 500 pesos per month

irom this, but this lact

is a closely guarded secret.

GRiNDi's acquaintances assume: that a

good part of his income

comes from this cover.

Previously, GERENDE

had been able to "prove" a total income of about 8000 pesos per month,

ostensibly from IDay.

IDEN B was owned by LISTERINE, and for years

The had carried GEREND:

on his payroll as an independent salesman on

commission.

He would ostensibly pay GERINDE a certain arount of

money: and

IDEN B's accountant would duly file income tax returns and

Social

security based

on this alleged payment.

IDEN B would also

pay whatever taxes were called for by the statements filed. This

system of "ghost payrclling" is quite common in Mexico, as everybody

gains:

the company because

its declared profit is lower than it

really is and, therefore, subject to less

tax, and the individual

because he 1g

ordinarily given a kickback for allowing his name to

be used (or in GRINDE's case, because it provided cover).

3.

All this ended on 31 December 1967,

when LISTERINE sold

IDEN B

to IDEN A.

for a while thereafter, GERINDE paid taxes caly

on the money he actually earned with IDEN A, which was, as stated,

about 500 pesos per montl.

As of 1 July 1968, however, LISTERINE

arranged, at GRENDE's request, to have his accountant

(who continued

to handle GRENDE's taxes as a favor to LISTERINE) to lump together

all Of GRINDE's earnings (from teaching as well as IDEN A)

a8

"professional earnings" and to file returns for GERENDE which included

the total amount.

This is not quite as satisfactory as the old

arrangement (among other things GRINDE must now pay his own taxes)

but for cover purposes it is entirely adequate. Other than LISTERINE

and the accountant, no one knows that GERNDE's ostensible earnings

have dropped, and, as far as we know, LISTERINE is the only person

who is aware

of GERINDE's tie with WOFIRM.

undoubtedly wish to reward his long years of loyal service with a

generous tersination payment.

He has earned it,

and only termination

for cause per paragrapi 10 (b) oi his cohliact uculd prevent nim

fron receiving it.

3.

vexican law (it is the law,

not custon) says that an erployce

who is fired nust be paid three months' salary plus twenty days'

salary for each full year employed by the company at the pay rate

existing at the time of separation.

GERINDE'S

current cover. company

adberes to this formula.

Since GERENDÉ'S termination clause has

always read that he would be paid a full month's salary for every

year of service (in the event of his termination ? wOFIR!), we would

not want to change that, and in fact we wish to add to it the three

months' pay guaranteed by Mexican law.

it the sase time, we do see

some virtue in the suggestion in paragraph 3 oi Red B that tull

retirement benefits (in the event of GEKENDE's resignation) would

apply only aïter 20 years' service, with lesser benefits until then.

Our suggestion would be that in the event of his resignation prior to

15 full years of service (1.e. prior to 18 March 1970) he be paid

twenty days' salary for each iull year, that alter lo yoars but prior

to 20 he be paid this amount plus three full months' salary, and that

aiter 20 years he be paid three months' salary plus one months' salary

fur every lull year. It is true, of course,

that Mexican law does

not make any orovision for payment of a termination bonus to an

employee who resigns, but most enlightened companies have some sort

of retirement program, and, as Ref B correctly points out,

"working

for WOFIRM is a very special case and deserves exceptional tinancial

consideration."

In the case of GRIND, we are no& attempting to

establish any pattern.

This

is a special case (as are nost) and the

Station merely wishes to insure that GERINDE, who has made

WOrIRy a

career without receiving any career beneiits

in return,

is rewarded

for his loyalty and is given

some incentive for the future.

GERENDE

is not without his faults, and he is being adequately compensated for

the work he performs, but

we cannot expect to get nore out of him

without showing bim greater respect.

4.

The Station

requests,

therefore, that the following amendment

be made in paragraph 11 ol GERENDE's contract:

In the event of GERINDE's termination by WOFIRy, he will

receive three months' pay plus one

month's pay for every full

year-of service since

18 Narch 195J, calculated at the rate

applicable at the time of termination.

bo

GERINDE's resignation upon 60 days' notice will be

accepted by WOFIRil as being in its best interest, and GERENDE

will be eligible for terminal payment according

to the following

formula: Prior to 18 March 1970, GERINDE will recelve. 20 days'

pay for every full year of service since 18 arch 1955; after 18

March 1970 but prior to 18 March 1975, GEREND will receive

three months' pay plus 20 days

for every full year since 18

March 1955: after 18 larch 1975 GERUNDE will receive three months

pay plus one

month for every full year of serrice since 18 March

1955.

All payments are

to be calculated at the rate applicable

at the time of resignation.

5. Paragraph 10 (b) will, of course, remain in force.

6. Ref D asked that GERENDE's contract be extended for another

year without change.

We assume that this has been done, although we

have not been notified.

During the reporting period, the project's principal

agent, Raymond H. GERENDE,

was assigned additional tasks, aimed

at broadening his usefulness to the Station.

These tasks

included spotting and assessment as well as the handling of a

recruited agent, ERFAIN-3.* GERENDE did well, and it 1g believed

that a new dimension has been opened for him, and by the sane.

token,

the Station has, in effect, gained a new asset.. The

LIEMPTY base houses continued to produce at their usual rate

and with their usual effective support to Station REDTOP oper-

ations.

The LIMITED Base House and its operator, LIENPTY-6,

were terminated on 31 May 1968.

Termination was decided upon

partly to save money and partly because advancing age had measur

ably decreased the reliability and cilectiveness of LIENPTY-6'g

LIELPTY-26 was rehired, which permitted the LILYRIC Base

House to give us the sane total hours of coverage as LILyRIC

and LIMITED had together in the past.

2. During the reporting period,

the case officer has been

meeting GRINDE an average of three

times per week.

Meetings

are usually pre-arranged, at various sites and times. leetings

average 20 to 30 minutes.

GERENDE turns over to the case

officer neratives, prints, logs, and other reports which he bas

picked up from the base houses since the previous meeting,

alon; sith brief contact reports on his meetings with base

house representatives.

Reports on other operational activities

are also turned in and discussed, and GRINDE is given instruc-

tions, notes for the base houses, and negatives for any enlarge-

ments which may be desired by the Station.

AlSo, LIENVOY tapes

and transcripts are exchanged at each meeting.

The departure

of LIACUTE-l at the end of

April 1968 left the Station without &

BEDOX transcriber.

As a temporary solution, pending the return

of LIACUTE-l or the recruitment of another BEDOX transcriber;

GERENDE's wife, LIENPTY-19, has been hired at the rate of 31.50

pesos per hour

to transcribe the Spanish language portions of the

She does the work in her home, and GRENDE transports the

tapes.)

GERENDE has the direct agent-handling responsibility for

following LIE.ITY agents:. LIE!PTY-4 (photo-processor; not

twice per week); LIEMPTY-G (LINITED; met once per week until

termination); LIEUPTYs 13, 14, 26, and 27 (LILYRIC; LIEMPTY-13

normally met twice per week - in his absence LIEMPTY-27 makes

meetings); and LIEMPTY-9 (LICALLA; met twice per week).. Ho is.

responsible for directing their work, paying them, and handling

all of the administrative problems which may develop.: To judge

from the results, GRENDE has excellent rapport with these agents

and is able to get a consistently high performance rate from

then - particularly LICILLA and LILYRIC personnel.

As noted in reference, GERENDE was employed by the

Mexican MIRAVEL committee,

which we found a useful side benefit.

His SHRAVEL activity during the reporting period has been mininal,

but we expect it to start picking up again... GRENDE has con

ducted a few discreet inquiries and investigations for us within

the SHRAVEL complex, and wo have instructed him to try to get

en assignment which will keep him as close to the FJSTEAL

delegation as possible.

5.

Reference also pointed out that GERENDE had performed

nicely in the cultivation and development of an operational

lead, and that the Station planned to give GERENDE more of the

same. Furthernore, GERIDE's standing assignments (LIE!PTY

base houses, AFRAVEL activity, and occasional support of JNIOD

requirements) were not challenging enough or occupying enough

Of GERENDE's tire.

GERENDE. is rather firmly committed to

WOFIRY by virtue of the fact that he has worked for NOFIRM for

over 13 years and has no other outside employment of any.

consequence.

By the same token,

he was,

through no fault of

his own, doing less work for WOFIRJ! than at any time in his

career.

GERENDE's operational exposure through the years

dictated mate and more restrictions on his activity, for sound

security reasons. The solution to GERUNDE's problem (lack of

a pronising future) and the Station's (not getting its money's:

worth) seemed to be to give GERENDE additional tasks which he

could handle under suitable cover and with due regard to security

precautions..

Since most of GeriNDE's support activities had

been against the FJSTEAL target, particular care would have to

be taken in cormitting him further in this direction.:

It was

decided, therefore;

that his principal retooling would be in

a non-FJSTEAL field..

to

G. In line with the above reasoning, GEREiDE was introduced

on 17 February 1968. The idea was that

GERINDE would be trained to assist

in somo of his

operations against

targets.

GERINDE'S principal

duty thus far has been to take over the handling of ERFAIN-3,

under

close supervision and guidance.

GERINDE has

perforned quite creditably in this task..

He seems interested

in the sork and has learned quickly.

On the other hand, an

apparently ingrained habit o! procrastination has resulted in

dilatory reporting.

IL GERLIDE can overcome this (and both case

officers are working hard to teach GERENDE the importance of

prompt and complete reporting) there seems to be every reason

to believe GERENDE will develop into a competent agent handler.

GERENDE was also given the task of locating and developing

(in allas) a girl who,

por LIENVOY, was being cultivated by

AERODENT.

Although GERENDE had to be continually reminded of the

assignsent, he did an excellent job of meeting the girl and

Gaining her confidence.

It is quite likely that he could have

recruited the girl as an access agent against AERODINT, but as

this point was reached another operation against AERODENT waS

launched and it was not felt that attempting to recruit the girl

would serve any useful purpose, for the time being at least

(among other things, there ras

no indication that she had had

any contact with AERODENT for some months).

The only flaw in

GERINDE's performance was the time it took hin to get around to

doing the job.

It should be mentioned, however, that at the

same time GERENDE had a number of pressing personal matters to

attend to, including overseeing the completion of his new house,

which he finally noved into on 10 March 1968, even though

construction is still not entirely completed.

haong other assignments completed by GRENDE in the

reporting period were the renting of an apartment for use as &
