_ 9eCRET,

17 July 1970

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Western Hemisphere Division
SUBJECT 1 Baymond H, GERENDE (P) and Wife.

1. Raymond H. GERENDE is a Mexican citizen ond con-
tract agent “ho has been employed by the Agency in Mexico
City since 18 March 1955 under an MOC, during which tine
be has served this Agency well, During the past fifteen
years GERENDE has been generally engaged in the. area of

“operational support activities in Mexico City. For:the

past two years he served as a principal agent handler

for a sensitive fixed surveillance project, LIEMPTY; was
used in unilateral recruitment approaches against the
Cubar target; and in special support investigations.

Ure, GERENDE, who is LIEMPYY/19, has been cmployed off

and on since 1958 as @ support asset, (transcriber/trans=
lator) under HOC, and during the past two yoars has worked
intermittently transcribing unilateral telephone tap tapes.

2. During the past year GERENDE and his wife have
had serious marital problems which culminated in a sepa~
ation in November 1969, and divorce actions sere initiated
by both parties. The divorce proceedings are still in
the courts, and bitter disputes have resulted between both
parties concerning custudy of tho children, division of
personal property, and the wonetary settlezents.. The above
problem is compounded by the fact that GERENDB's wife knows
in some considerable detail.of GERENDE's activities on
behalf of tho Ajency and if she exposed him, it-could lead
to the surfacing of GERENDE's Asency employment and pos-
gible compromise of operations LIEMPTY, LIMESA, LIEMBRACE,
and LIFRAT, as well as numerous individual Station assets
such as LISTERINE, LIZAZOR/1, LIBAND/1, and David i.
WILSTED (P).. Since late 1909, Mexico City Station bas
been in touch with both GERENDE ana his wife om this prob-
lem, and every effort has beon made by the Station to have



14-9009,

woe ~ SECRET. a
-2-

both parties settle the divorce amicably and to protect
GERENDE's cover and that of the projects. Because of the
above family problems which threatened GERENDE's personal
cover and security, he vas relieved of all operational
responsibilities and placed on half salary in December 1969.

3. In March of 1970, Mexico City Station decided
that GERENDE's personal problems were not being resolved,
and because of the continuing security threat, Plans were
made to terminate both GERENDE and his wife by the end of
FY 1970, The LIEMPTY Project renegal, approved in May
1970, was amended to include a termination bonus for
GERENDE of $10,000 for 15 years of service with the Agency,
and in addition approval was received to pay Mrs, GERENDE
the eum of $2,500 as a security measure designed to keep
her from revealing Ler husband's ‘wency affiliation and
what she knows about Agency operations in Mexico. This
project approval carried the ADDF xcaveat that the ter-
mination bonuses to both GERENDE and hig wife be paid on
“a monthly basis rather than in one lump sum.as.a_security
measure to assure at. least an element of control over

» vy» both individuals, sioce the continued receipt of these

+, monthly. payments depended on their loyalty to the Agency.
GERENDE and bis wife were terminated by Station represen-
tatives in Mexico on 26 June 1970 under st:ndard Agency
- procedures, and separate Quit Claims and Secrecy Agroe-
monte were siyoed by both GERENDE scd. bis wife. Neither
GERENDE ior his wife had any objection to the wording of
the Quit Claims or the Security agreements, and both
appeared to be satisfied with the terms of the settlonent,
and with the fairness of the Agency's position.

GEREDE

3, The GERINDE problen is unquestiozcbiy a serious one. fe
are forwarding under separate cover copics of several ucmoranda
Prepared by GERENDE, Ono outlines the history of his marital
problems, another describes the current legal situation, and a
third outlines proposals for a settlement, Tiere is no hope of
reconciliation, ‘he Station's position with GLENDE from the
start has been that he must agree to an amicable ecttlement with
his wife in order to insure that she would not fcel forced to take
steps which would jeopardize the security of Station operations,
For this reason, the Station insisted from the beginning that any
financial settlemont with his wiic would have to take into account
the fact that he was receiving a certain salary frow RVROCK, and
that he could not fairly keep this salary out of the settlement on
the grounds that his wife could eake no legal claim to that :
salary, GERENDE's wire was made aware of our position on this, and
she was grateful, even though she realized that this arrangement
was Strictly taformal, The Station felt that GERENDE could not be
allowed to use his KVROCK salary.as a weapon in the dispute with his
ife, because if he did, she “could hardly be expected to refrain
rom exposing his connections, Indeed, events have shown that
‘IGERENDE's. wife is a vindictive worzan, and if it had not been clear
‘to her that she, as well as GENZIDZ, would lose money if he loses

his job, she might have blown the whistle long ago. GERENDZ, for
his par., would have preferred to keep his RYROCK salary entirely
out of the picture, Eventually, hovever, be agreed that the Station
position was fair, and he said he would conforn,

"4. The attached: memoranda from GERENDE are, in the Station's
Opinion, basically fair accounts. In the beginning, the Station
was inclined to give GERENDE's wife (LIEMPTY-19) the benefit of the
doubt,,largely because her description of G:RENDE's character
Weaknesses came as no surprise (particularly his tendency to
rocrastinate, even when his marriage was at stake). Early in the
gconflict, LIEMPTY-19 contacted RIZZUTO and asked point blank what
.-she could tell her lawyer about Gi2EDE's salary, She was told
she could not mention the RVROCK portion under any circumstances,
and that if she told anyone that GZRENDE had any connection with
LNPURE, the connection would be denied. and GERHNDE would. be
terminated. She appeared to accept this gracefully, even though it
meant she would-have to scale her support dezands down to the
level of GERENDE's overt income (GZR&NDE's nonthly salary fron
RVROCK was over 7,000 pesos; he e2rned an additional 4.to 5,000 pesos
teaching English, and he haS since rented their house, for which
he is receiving slightly. less than 7,000 pesos monthly).
Subsequently, LIEMPTY-19 was told that the Station. would see to it
that as long as GERENDE continued to. receive an RVROCK salary, he,
would give her the same proporticn of this salary that the courts
.Idetermined should be paid from.his overt incone. This, of course,
was strictly an informal arrangezent, one which would stop_t. Sienna
jainute GPRENDE Stopped receiving 2 salary. Latér, as Liz:PTy-19's
‘Position hardened and her vindictiveness bégan to rule her actions,
LIEMPTY~-19 was. reminded ‘by the Station that the longer it took for
an amicable solution to be reached, the greater was the chance
that GERENDE would lose his job. If she persisted in. having hin
arrested (which She succeeded in doing twice), his job would be ‘
jeopardized, While she continued to repeat sweetly that she had‘no
intention of causing his termination, and had never breathed a
word to a soul about his RVROCK iation, her attitude was. in
fact jeopardizing his job and if -he lost his job, she and. the
children, as well as GERENDE, would lose income, Her attitude is

€oubly disappointing | in view of the fact that as slic became- more ard
more unreasonable, GERINDE vas moving in the ether direction,

5. The outcome can still not be predicted. AS can be seen
froma GERENDE's menos, the tvo sides are still far apart on a nuaber
of points, including specifically moncy,. LliiPTY-19 insists on
10,000 pesos per nonth D: willing to pay 5,000, GERiNDZ
is currently or haj)t-pe a is total (n1t sorrced
nonthly income is around 14, (000 pesos, this, he would not only
havo to pay the amount which is finally agreed upon, he nest also
continve payments Gi 2560 pesos per month to LIEMPTY-l1¢'s father
(paying off a loan obtained to build their house), The complicating
factor is the uncertainly of GERENDE's future with RVROCK, The
Station has maintained for some, tine that it is impossible to
continue to pay GERINDE his full salary solely torun the LICALLA
and LILYRIC basehouses, Now that has absorbed this duty
with only small inconvenience and some loss of timeliness, it makes
even less sense to put GEREXDE to work only to do this, GESRENDE
has long been aware of. the Station's thinking in this regard, and
prior to the current peroonal crisis he had been told that he
would have to work harder at a greater variety of tasks in order
to retain his position. As Headquarters is aware, he hed been
given Additional tasks, and, as reported in reference, he had begun
to respond very well, There has never been any question of GERENDE'’s
ability. As we have previously stated, he is personable, intelligent,
bilingual and binational, and has had Rood training and experience
in certain fields, On the. other hand, there has long been doubt

:about his seriousness of purpose, his initiative, and his ambition,

The: "roversal of roles" which he describes in one of the attached ‘
memos, Which took place when he was confined to his hore as an

«LP keeper, did more than cause domestic probleas ~= it apparently
deprived him of the discipline of a daily job. His well-deserved
reputation for being lazy was earned years ago.

6, The question which must be answered is whether or
not to terminate GERENDE. We can. be useful to the Station, but
the Station has learned to get along without hin. What are the
security hazards involved? The general range of his knovledge is
described in paragraph 5 of reference, If all of this tere blown,
the loss to the Station, particularly in terms of support operations
againststhe MHHARSH target, would be considerable, The Station
does ‘not belicve that GERENDE would deliberately expose any of this,
but it is impossible to predict what LIFMPTY-19 might do, particularly
“since she would feel that she had nothing to lose, havirg already
-lost a possible source of income through the termination, G#RENDE's
termination bonus would probably be ‘in the neighborhood of ten
thousand dollars. Presumably LIEMPTY-19 is aware of the fact that
he would get such a bonus, although the Station has never discussed
this with her and the possible division of such a bonus between the
two of them has never been mentioned. i

LICALLA

7%. The LICALLA basehouse continues to function without changés,
except for the fact that has been. meeting LIEMPTY-9
since 9 December 1969, .Brief meetings with LIEXPTY-9 are held once
&@ week at pre-arranged times and places (well away: from the MHHARSH
ea) Occasionally special meetings are called, by phone, by

if special coverage..is desired (as in the AESEASICK case,
for example). There have been no problems, ‘operational or personal,
involving the basehaise or LIEMPTY~9 during the reporting period.
LIEMPTY-9 provided 1,728 photographs during the reporting period,
and in addition to his regular reporting on observed activities of
MHHARSH personnel, he provided special coverage’ as requested. This
"special coverage" consists of his observations. of a selected
individual -—- who does he spend. his time with, how is he behaving,
‘when fas he present (or absent), etc, LIEMPTY-9 spends over 40

and over the years he has pottento know tien, and their habits,

“gafety" of the MIUIARS! back yard, thereby enabling us to nake
tentative ALKICK or ALGRIP identifications, TDYers can often be
linked up with thelr internal escort, officers, In the: case of
specific targets, LICALLA special coverage can sowetines give clucs
to personal relationships which can be exploited, During the reporting]
period we had special coverage on AESEASICK (to determine any
changes in pattern following the AEMIDRIFF defection and following
the operation against him --.arnlin both cases LICALLA did report ~
some change in pattern); 201-365870 (for much the sauce reason,
although here the evidence was not. as clear); AEPOLYP (to gather
information on bis patterns and his associations); AETAKLOFF
(for, the same reason); and 201-638166 (to find out if he did,
in fact work in the "restricted area" and who his associates were,
a requirement which was quickly satisfied), Also, LICALLA has been
asked to report on the arrival and activitics of TD¥ers such as
the AKKICK security inspectors (he is not, of course, told that
“security inspectors" are expected -~ he is told of the expected
arrival of visitors, and he can spot a visitor.or newcomer immediately),
the possible arrival of 201-314616 and, currently, to attcmpt to
identify, at least by association, the person: who went out to meet
» an LUREAD agent (subject of MEXICO CITY 2741, 17 March 1970), The
« -‘Walue of LICALLA to the REDTOP program in Mexico City can scarcely
“be overstated,

LILYRIC
8.’ There have been no changes during the reporting period of
on of the LILYRIC. baschouse activity, except that
took over ‘the h £ the LILYRIC personnel from
ERENDE in early December, normally meets only LIZMPTY-13,
at pre-arranged sites and so well away from the MHHARSH

area), once a week for pick-up of the filus and reports, He occa=
sionally meets LIEWPTY-14 (LIziPTY-13's wifc) when LIEMPTY-13 may
be out of town, The LILYRIC coverage is a family enterprise

th the work equally divided among LIZMPTY-13, 24,-26, and -27,

ho split up the hours of duty so that there is uninterrupted
“coverage Mondays through Fridays from 0800 to 1800 hours, and

0800 to 1500 hours Saturdays. (Extra-hour or week-end. coverage may
be. requested as necessary, and. the LILYRIC: personnel responded to
the Station request for. such extra.coverage during the AEMIDRIFF ,
and AESEASICK cases.) The family has continued to provide reports
during the reporting period.on all activity centered on the front
entrance of the MHHARSH Embassy, Such coverage included, as in the
past, daily logs on the comings and goings.of MHHARSH officials,
up-to-date recording of MHHARSH license numbers, special activities
and visitors (particularly Americans, of whom five were spotted and
reported on during the reporting. period), and.sone. 3,500 photographs,
As an example of the value of LILYRIC-coverage, within one week of
the change of license plates at the MHHARSH Embassy (a biannual change
affecting all of Mexico, with new numbers bearing no relation to
the old), LILYRIC had. provided a complete list of the new numbers
(along with the cars to which the plates are assigned). Among
other things, this enabled the Station to identify AESEASICK's
companions during his last few days in Mexico, Without LILYRIG
identificaticoof the new license. plates would have taken. ponths and
would have handicapped our. operations, LILYRIC has also provided
Special coverage of the visit of a Latin American CP representative,
and is.currently watching for the two AEKICK security technicians,
201~314616, and the man who went to meet the LNREAD agent. Also,
LILYRIC has reported on visits of Mexican. dudents and the identity
of the MHHARSH representatives who deal with thea or hand out
literature to them. In short, LILYRIC’s services, even though the

(taking over for GERiNDE) since 26 Novenber 1969.

The first few meetings at that tize (late Koveaber a early
December) were arranged by) by telephone to LILVPTY-4 and

primarily concerned LIEPTY-4's reports on GERENDK's family problens
and related security arrangements. Since nid-December,: LIEPTY=4
resumed a regular schedule (usually weekly) of meetings at
pre-arranged sites and times, LIEIPTY-4 has been given a special
extension in the Station to which he-may call as "Dr. Carlos" to
leave a message for "Victor" le can change meeting
plans by directly calling LIEHPTY-4, The only personal problem
directly involving LIEMPTY-4 was surgery on his knee which required
his wearing a full cast. on his leg for over six weeks, During

this period when LIENPTY-4 has been unable to drive, has
been neeting LIEWPTY-4, for the exchange of LICALLA/LILYRIC films
and prints, at LIFIPTY-4's office, under a suitable pretext and with
appropriate security precautions, LIEMPTY-4's services are
invaluable since the Station could not, on a continuing basis,
process the LIEMPTY material in its own photo lab,

SECURITY

10, Other than the security problems inherent in GERENDE's
Personal problems, there have been no security problems during the
reporting period,

FUTURE PLANS |g,
1 that he must be terminated, This is not aneasy decision to nake,

nor will it. be-easy to confront GzxENDE with this decision, He
has, after all, devoted 15 years of his life to RVROCK, Ilovever,
as noted above, in spite of his talents the Station has been able
to getvhlong without his services, Furtheraore, the constant
security risk posed by his wife is, frankly, an unacceptable risk.
To try to molify her by promising her a portion of his salary is
“probably unworkable in realistic terms, particularly since her
attitude has progressively hardened, The Station, therefore,
intends tp terminate GERENDE prior to the end of FY 1970. GERENDE's
contract calls for a termination bonus of one month's salary per
full year, This would come to $8,750 (USD). For various reasons,
including the need to preserve the security of the operation by
ensuring that the termination is anicable, it will probably be
necessary, as stated in paragraph 6, to give GERENDE about $10,000
(USD). Furthermore, it will be necessary to inform LIEMPTY=19 of
the termination, and, to keep her from revealing what she knows, «-
she will undoubtedly have to be given some money herself, The
Station does not believe that it would beequitable or sound fron
@ security point of view to use the money which GFRENDE himself has
earned for this purpose, Therefore, while the figure will remain
negotiable, the Station believes that the sun of $2,500 (USD)
would be a reasonable anouat. Total obligaticns for FY 1970 in:
the LIE:PTY Project are currently estimated at slightly less than
$33,000 (USD). The Project has been approved in the amount of
$38,970 (USD) leaving unobligated approximately $6,000 (USD). It
is therefore requested that the LIZ{PTY Project be amended for
FY.1970 to provide an additional $8,000 (USD) to be used in the
GERENDE termination. Funds will be available at the Station.
.

} 11. As for GERENDE, the Station has reached the conclusion

12,. Regarding the project renewal for r¥Y 1971, as far as
LICALLA, LILYRIC, and LIEMPYY-4 are concerned, co changes in
Procedure are planned, The product is useful, it is:as tinely a3

Increase in cost of living alono would be suliicient justification
to raise salaries, but in the ease of these agents their consistently
excellent work deserves to be rewarded, These salary increases
will probably range between 10 and 20 percent.

13, As for other project expenses, LIENPTY-10 and LIEYPTY~11
will no longer bo funded under LIEMPTY, but have been transferred
to LIEMBRACE effective 1 July 1970, mleal estate expenses should
remain fairly constant, with perhaps a slight allowance for
inflation. The rent on GEREDE's dark room (MEXI 137) will no
lengor be paid with his termination, MV-2823 will be sold or
otherwise disposed of and: should not be included in tho project
for FY 1971, Equipment and operational expenses should remain
constant, -

SUBJECT: GER=YDE Backgrovad and Status Report
of Present Marital Conflict :

1. While this is not intended to-be a full exposition of my '
personal and private life over recent years,’ I would Like to make
_ known Some of the factors that have, from my point of view, led
uP to the present Situation.
yi 2, Y vealize that the interests of the organization and the He
interest of the individuals who may have opportunity to come in i
i contact with my case dictate as little Personal involvement as
= i possible 4n the lives of agents. Indeed, the requirements of
: security, compartnentation and efficiency prescribe the mcdue i
operandi and, to a great extent the :odus vivendi, of agency
Personael net only in the sense of earning a living but also in
manner of living. Ideally, the less said about an agent's private t
life, the better, but, as the years ge by, changes may occur which
j 60 unreported or unnoticed and which may bring about unexpected
i; events and revercussions. ‘When f person has beeu working for the

jJob,.2nd something cones up like the abrupt seporation of - my
wife (LIUMPTY-19) and re with the personal and potential security
risks it has entailed, I feel that some explanation is necessary.
Should it be in order, I would like this explanation te reach not
only my present case officer and Chief of Station but also the

5. We moved to a small apartment in Lomas and, to supplement
the loss cf salary and rent allowance, the Stution began paying
1,000 vesos a month fer the use of a dark roon I had built on the
roof of the building, We had wr third child; vadeleine, unplanned,
two months after settling in the two-bedroom apartment. The
apartment need not have beea-so small tut we had chosea it for its
Jocation and style and because it was to be a temporary stop until
we could find something better, We missed going to the Olympics
in, Tokyo which we had plunned to do (1964) and instead. began
negetiatiag to buy a home building site at Rio Escendido but whea
the:deal fell thragh, we decided to go on leave to Burove again,

sister, Ye visited with LI%cPTY-19's parents in Holland (they had
moved back to !olland aiter having lived in Washington, D.C,, since
1943) and the two children stayed with them while Ly f¥-19 and I
made side trips, Traveling is LI 1Y-19's greatest love in life,
Upon our return to Mexico (I came back twe weels earlier), LI#IPTY-19
was so depressed at leaving fvrope and being back in Mexico she was
otionally and physically inaccessible for about six weeks. She
had not fully adjusted to living ia Mexico or to settling down and
becoming a housewife, Our cramped quarters, way of living, lack

An autonatic washer and even a piano. Naturally, cash was srarce,

exciting and out of the routine of houc and children, She fell in
‘love with the Australians as well, and for several months all she

thought but decided that we had neither the noney to invest nor the

“youth and technical training to make it as pioncers “down under"

athat aspect of our narried life, For several months we tried this
cbut it did not werk out for ne. One night in March 1969 aiter we

TO : Case Officer
‘FROM =: GERENDE
‘SUBJECT: GERENDE Status Report

‘The present situation of the marital conflict between GERENDS and
his wife (LIEVPTY-19) is as follows: -

aah 1, GERENDE is living at his mother's apartment at 99 Carlos
‘B. Zetina Street, Apartment 9, He has rented a three-bedroon
‘Apartment. at Tornel 3 corner with Pedro Antonio de los Santos where
ihe.has stored the household effects and furniture removed from his
; former: address at Ladera 59, Lomas de Bezaros, i

| 2, The house.at Ladera 39 is rented to an-executive of

/ Chrysler Corporation International, Dr. Leon MARKIEWICZ, his wife,
jand fifteen-year old daughter, all ‘of Argentine nationality. The
imonthly rent is 6,700 pesos M/N and the contract is for two years,
p beginning 1. February 1970,

: 3. LIEMPTY-19'and the four children are apparently. still
. hyiving at the rosidence of the Netherlands' Ambassador, Baron

'Schelto Van ‘Heemstra at Peia 360, Jardines del ‘Pedregal. It seems
; fairly certain they are. at that address from things that the two
older children, Adriana. and Chris, have said to GERENDE on the last
| two occasions he has seen then, They have been there since
{5 December 1969, LIEWPTY-19 has denied that she has a-fixed address

band says that she is staying with "friends, ‘

LIEMPTY-19 is continuing to-use the services of
s her lawyer and, through him, is Pressing for even more
eous terms in the divorce than she had asked in November,

Please see ttached copy and translation of the latest proposal
made by| on 4 March 1970, .

a 5. The charges and accusations: made by LIEMPTY-19 against
“-WGERENDE are still not completely resolved and are as follows:

rests at the 5° Juzgado Penal, 2° Corte Penal located at

a. Insults, threats and attempted homicide -- this charge ~

i
i



H

Lecumberri, The judge 43 CP7S Mollade,  Tiese CMweEes have

not been pressed since they were originally nade on 13 Novenber
1969 by LINMPTY-19, The ruling on these charges, should the
case come to trial, must be made by three judzes of the 2° Corte
Penal composed of the 4th, Sth, and 6th Juzgados Penales. . The
judge of the 6° Juzgade is Lic. QUIPAZCO, an alusnus of
GEREKDE's lawyer, Jorge Mario ALLON, Topether they have,

on two occasions, been to speak to Judge CRUZ Mellado vio
agrced not t issue an arrest warrant and who has, finally,
called for a hearing on 16 March (subsequently postponed) at
10:00. MAGALLON has given GERENDE assurances that the charges
are likely to be dismissed,

b, Fraud ~~ this charge was made by LIEYPTY~19 and her
lawyer on 11 December 1969, tho day aftex GERFIDE left the
Villa Obregon jail aftor having. spent a week there for
disobeying a court order. (The court: order had consisted of
an unfounded ‘request to have GERINDE expelled from his house
and'to have LIEMPTY-19 reinstated ‘there with her father, as
the temporary custodian of the children, GERENDE refused then
admissbn under those terms, hence disobeying the Villa Obregon
Judge's. order, so.the judge's secrctary. arbitrarily. ordered,
Ongthe spot, a 10-day detention, Subsequently, the ddge,
LUCAS del ARENAL, was forced to lift the detention after seven
days and dismiss himself from the case and divorce proceedings
ag incompetont, The judge has had to face charzes of
collusion from and with the lawyers of both Partios, i.e,
Magallon and Jurado, The charge of. fraud rests at sfesa 31%
of the Procuraduria del Distrito. Federal, The Public Ministry
Agent. in charge of that table is Jorge GUTIERREZ Cruz.
LIEMPTY-19. claims that the money lent to her and GERENDE for
building. the house at Ladera #39 was actually loaned to buy
the house and that GERENDE, knowing they were married under
tho separate property marriage clause Ind wrongfully placed
the property in his name only, thereby cowmitting fraud.
Actually, the land was bought by GERENDE before Christnas 1965
in’a complicated transaction involving three other partners:
Robert Bancroft WHITZHOUSE, John (Dick) RENNA, and- Janes
Walter HURLEY, and each of the partners placed the property
in their respective names with the complete. knowledge of their

‘Spouses. Later the land was. subdivided and after nineteen

months the decds were issued, LIE!PTY-19 stpervised and prodded’
the notary who made the transaction and. she was perfectly aware
that the property was in GERENDE's mame. -In August 1967 when
construction of the. house began, LIE:PTY-19's father's money

Was used which. he had deposited in Mexico for the purpose.

Since January 1969, according to the terms of the loan
agreement, GERENDE has beea .paying it off and has receipts from
LIEMPTY-19 to show for it, ql

. GERENDE has presented ‘both the land deed ("escritura")

Xo further action has been taken by LIncTyY-19 or her lavyer
on this matter but tie charge has not finally been settled and
4s still pending. Tae charge is, of course, unfounded and is
awaiting the proper “lubricztion" in order to be filed azay,

. c. Neglect -- this charge was made by LIE PTY-19 in
Decenber 1969 at the 7° Ji gedo Mixto de Paz claining that
GEREXDE had abandoned LizMPTY-19 And the children to their fate
and that they were utterly destitute, GERIENWE vas not
notified of this charge and on 9 February after attending a
bearing at the Villa Cbregon juzgado (sce below), once out on
the sidewalk, Judicial Police agents detained GEENDE, .took
hin to the Procuraduria and frea there to Lecumberri, This
process involved being finger-printed and mugged. The
following day GERFNDE was out oa a 2,000 pesos bond and three
days later, 13 February, the justice of the peace (a woman)
formally set GERENDE free for lack of evidonce. GERENDE and
Magallon went back on 5 !erch to pick ‘up'the bond money and

see if{ | had appealed but he had not and, apparently,
that matter is closed. : :

Tho hearing of 9 February after which GERIZIDE was detained, was
called by Villa Cbregon judge Bonfilio SEGURA, GERENDE reiterated
the charge, LIEMPTY-19 denied it, the judge ruled against her,.
Ordered her to prison but since the injuries were minor, it does

not require privation of liberty and she must only go and sign-in
once a week,

7. LIEMPTY-19 is at Present teaching school at the Edron
Academy on Caleri Street in San Angel Inn, The two older children
are going to school there, During the latter part of November, all
December and half of January, the children did not attend any
School, On three occasions GERENDE has been to the school at 13:30

to try to'speak to LIEPTY-19 and see the children. LIEMPTY-19

ACTION REQUIRED: For Your Information

| REFERENCE : HMMA-37623, 4 August 1969 (Last Progress Report)

1, Although this report might normally be submitted one month
from-now, the use of-Oliver G,. SCANTLING. kas shifted sufficiently
to warrant a special report at this time, Our next progress report
will be submitted for the period 1 October through 31 December un-
less exceptional circumstances justify another change.

2, Tho fundamental change in the use of SCANTLING (who has
suifered tho past six weeks from paratyphoid) is that he. has been
divorced from routine cut-out operations and will henceforth be
used for priority tasks and targets which will better utilize his
proven talents, First, in late September ZARROCK took over LICASA-1
for direct handling, The LICASA operation offered no particular
challenge to SCANTLING and it is doubtful that his intermediary role
offered any particular additional security in this case, In fact,
if a flap should ever develop in this case SCANTLING would just add
one more local who would have to be extricated from the tongs of the
GON. Second, it has been decided that SCANTLING will very. soon turn
LIANVIL-1 over to Raymond GERENDE, The details are presently being
Worked out. ———

3. PLANS: In line with our decision to use SCANTLING for re-

.eruitment efforts principally (and less so for routine agent pond taney

he is presently preparing for a recruitment attempt against Subject ‘
% MEXICO CITY-1502. When ‘that operation is completed he will be tar-
geted againstthe MNHARSH target both through a commercial outlet of
the Bloc and through various clubs and sports centers where he may
have access to MHHARSH types. . Aside from these responsibilities, he
will be used as needed in other recruitmen ia in
support of a new surveillance team.

Division
VIA : WH/FI '
WH/CONTRACTS
SUBJECT : Recommendation to Amend the Contract of

Raymond H, GERENDE (Contract Agent) to
Include Improved Termination Benefits
and a Salary Increase . 7

from Agency service,

contract amendment.

“2. The above information has been reviewed again by
AC/WH/1,, and we are requesting approval for the following”
mendments to paragraph 11 of Subject's contract:

“A) In the event of GERENDE's termination by the
Agency he will receive three month's pay plus one
month's pay for every full year -of service since
18 March 1955, calculated at the rate applicable at
‘the time of termination.

B) In the event of resignation and/or voluntary |
retirement upon 60 days notice the following schedule
would be acceptable to the Agency as being in its best
interests and a payment considered as a terminal payment

as follows:

(1) Less than 15 years service (prior to March
1970) 20 days pay for each full year of service.

(2) | Over 15 years:service, but less. than 20
years service (prior 18 March 1975) three months
Salary plus 20 days pay for each full year of: service.

1. During the past year Mexico City Station has
submitted several dispatches recommending that paragraph

11 of Subject's contract be amended to include new benefits
in the event of Subject's termination and/or resignation
These Station recommendations have
been carefully reviewed by C/WH/Contracts and a Memorandum
was forwarded to C/WH/1 containing guidance on the suggested

a

ct lates

(3) Over 20 years service, three months
salary plus one month's pay for each full year
of service. .

(4) All payments above are to be calculated
at the rate of pay applicable at the time of
retirement and/or resignation,

3. As to the points raised by WH/Contracts in their
Memorandum concerning this amendment we would like to note
the following:

A) GERENDE is a Mexican citizen, working for the
Agency since 18 March 1955 under an MOC, who considers
himself to be a "career" employee of the Agency, and
whose initial local employment for cover purposes was
largely notional under a system of “ghost payrolling".
GERENDE received no income or bencfits from this "cover"
Position which terminated due to the demise of the
company on 31 December 1967.. GERENDE's other "cover"
is self generated in that he gives English lessons in
his spare time to middle management Mexican nationals
employed by American owned companies in Mexico City.

His income benefits from this "cover" are minimal, but

suffice for satisfying acquaintances as to the source

of his income. In conclusion, GERENDE is considered by

the Station to be a full time contract agent, on call

* at all times for operational activity. Any other local
benefits which may accrue to him by the virtue of his
being a Mexican citizen should not, we feel, be a concern
of this Agency given the above circumstances of his employ-
ment with us.

4. This Branch is of the belief that the resignation
and/or retirement schedule outlined ‘in Paragraph 2, B above
Provides career benefits for GERENDE in the event that he
must resign and/or retire in the event of unforseen personal
circumstances, It additionally rewards him for his loyalty.
of service, and at the same time provides him with incentive
to remain in Agency service for the additional financial
benefits that will accrue to him providing both future
security and incentive.



14-0004,

5. During the past two years GERENDE has served as
a principal agent handler fcr a sensitive fixed sur-
veillance project; has carried out, unilateral recruitment
approaches against the Cuban target; has been used in
special support investigations; and is presently being
i considered for use in spécial operations of a sensitive
nature. .A review of the, progress reports. in GERENDE's
i operations discloses that the Station has been more than
H satisfied with GERENDE's performance and is anxious to

i
i
{

take advantage of his full potential. GERENDE's last
salary increase from $6,000 to $6,500 per. annum was granted
in July 1965, and there have been no increases since,
Since the Field Station/Headquarters negotiation over.
7 i E amendment of paragraph 11 of GERENDE's contract has been
{ i in progress for over one year and a half, we are of the
7 bélief that thé Station wished to finalize this ancndment
prior to requesting a salary increase for the agent. It
is therefore requested, considering the above, that approval
be given for a salary. increase from $6,500 to $7,000 cf-
fective 1 August 1969, and that his contract be so amended.
The Field Station will be queried for their approval via
cable prior to implementation of the contract amendment.

C_pavmond H, GERENDE's Cover Status

1, In preparing a recent request for an amendment to Raymond
H. GERENDy's contract, it occurred to us that it would probably be
useful to bring Headquarters up-to-date on GERLNDE's cover status.
As a full-time contract ageat, GERENDH is on call at all times 1or
operational activity, His cover activity not only provides him witao
the necessary flexibility, it is alsu solid enough to provide him
with a plausible explanation of his existence and his income,

* 2. GERENDE has two major cover activities, One is the teaching
of English, mainly to middle-manayement personnel of American-owned
firms in Mexico City, This ‘is done on a regular basis for a few 954

jours each day and carns GERENDE.an income of about 5000 pesos per.
vionth, His second cover activity, and-one which is largely a cover
and not really activity, is working ag a salesman for IDEN A?
sactually earns only about 500 pesos per month from this, but this tac
is a closely guarded secret. GéRIXDK'S acquaintances assume -that a
good part of his income comes from this cover, Previously, GERENDE
had been able to "prove" a total income of about 8000 pesos per. month,
ostensibly from IDEN B, IDEN B was owned by LISTERINE, and for years
che -had carried GERENDE on his payroll as an independent salesman on
commission, He wovld ostensibly pay GERENDE a certain amount of
money, and IDEN B's accountant would duly file income tax returns and
social security based on this alleged payment. IDEN B would also

pay whatever taxes were called for by the statements filed. This

a SECRET |

Bystem of "ghost payrclling" is quite common in Mexico, as everybody
Bains: the company because its declared profit is lower than it
really is and, therefore, subject to less tax, and the individual
because he is ordinarily given a kickoack for ailowing his name to
be used (or in GERENDE's case, because it. provided cover).

3, . All this ended on 31 December 1967, when LISTERINE sold
IDEN B to IDEN A. For a while thereafter, GERENDE paid taxes oaly.
on the money he actually earned with IDEN A, which was, as stated,
about 500 pesos per month. As of 1 July 1968, however, LISTERINE
arranged, at GERENDE's request, to have his accountant (who continued
to handle GERENDE's taxes as a favor to LISTERINE) to lump together
#11 of GERENDE's earnings (from teaching as well as IDEN A) as
“professional earnings" and to file returns for GERENDE which included
the total amount, This is not quite as satisfactory as the old
arrangement (among other things GERENDY must now pay his own taxes)
but for cover purposes it is entirely adequate, Other than LISTERINE
and the accountant, no one knows. that GERENDE's ostensible earnings
have dropped, and, as far as we know, LISTERINE is the only person
who is aware of GERENDE's tie with WOFIRM.

‘ 1, The Station has finally compiled the information necessary
to answer the questions raised in Ret 8 and, in doing so, wishes to
repeat the request originally made in Ref A ‘to anend Raymond Hi.
GERENDE's contract to provide him with a certain amount of job security

2, First, Ref B raised the point that there had been no efficiendy
reports written on _GERENDE or “evidence of outstanding periormance."
“GERENDE's performance has been evaluated regularly witnin the context
of ‘the regular LIZMPTY Project progress reports, and a review of the
past several reports will demonstrate that the Station has been more
than satisfied with GERLNDE's performance and is anxious to take
advantage ot his ful) potential, The Station does not believe,
however, that "evidence of outstanding performance" should be a
prerequisite for the type of contract anandment being requested. It
is perfectly true, as pointed out in Ref B, that the Station had gone
on record jn 1959 that GERENDE should not be paid a termination
bonus if he should resigu simply to net the extra money or to pursue
another career, By now, however, GERENDE has cast his lot with
WOFIRM, He re: 3.no other career, and to try to start one at
this point would be extremely difficult on. the other hand, if he
should decide to try his hand at something else, the Station would

undoubtedly wish to reward his long years of loyal service with a
generous termination payment, He has earned it, and only termination

(for cause per paragraph 10 (b) of his contract wculd prevent him
from receiving it,

3. Mexican law (it is the law, not custom) says that an employee
who is fired must be paid three nonths" salary plus twenty days'
salary for €ach full year employed by the company at the pay rate
A lexisting at the time of separation, G:RENDE's current cover company
i adheres to this formula, Since GiRENDi's termination clause has
i always read that he would be paid a full month's salary for every
H year of service (in the event of his termination by WOFIRM), we would
: not want to change that, and in fact we wish to ad¢ to it the three
£ mnonths' pay guaranteed by Mexican law, At the sane time, we do see
q some virtue in the suegestion in paragraph 3 of Ref B that full
H retirement benefits (in the event of GERENDE's resignation) would

apply only aiter 20 years' service, with lesser benefits until then.
Our suggestion would be that in the event of his resignation prior to
15 full years of service (i.e. prior to 18 March 1370) he be paid
twenty days' salary tor each rull year, that aiter 15 years but prior
to 20 he be paid this amount plus three full montns’ salary, and that
aiter 20 years he be paid three months' salary plus one months’ salary
for every iull year. It is true, of course, that Mexican law does
not make any provision for payment of a terminatica bonus to an
. employee who resigns, but most enlightened companies have some sort
of retirement program, and, as Ref B correctly points out, "working
for WOFIRM is a very special case and deserves exceptional financial
consideration,” In the case of GERENDE, we are nct attempting to
establish any pattern, This is a special case (as are most) and the
Station:merely wishes to insure that GERENDE, who has made WOFIRM a
Career without receiving any career benefits in return, is rewarded
for his loyalty and is given some incentive for the future. GERENDE
‘Ys not without his faults, and he is being adequately compensated for
the work he performs, but we cannot expect to get nore out of him ’
without showing bim greater respect,
,

4, The Station requests, therefore, that the following amendment

.be made in paragraph 11 of GERENDE's contract:

&. In, the event of GERENDE's termination by WOFIRM, he will
receive three months' pay plus. one month's pay for every full
year: of.service since 18 March 1955, calculated at the rate
applicable at the time of termination,

b. GERENDE's resignation upon 60 days' notice will be
accepted by WOFIRM as being in its best interest, and GERENDE
will be eligible for terminai payment according to the following
formula: Prior to 18 March 1970, GERENDE will receive. 20 days'
pay for every full year of service since 18 March 1955; after 18
March 1970 but prior to 18 March 1975, GEREND2 will receive
three months! pay plus 20 days for every full year since 18
March 1955; Giter 18 March 1976 GERENDE will receive three months
pay plus one month for every full year of service since 18.March
1955, All payments are to be calculated at the rate applicable
at the time of resignation.

5. Paragraph 10 (b) will, of course, remain in force. i
6. Ref D asked that GERENDE's contract be extended for another

year without change. We assume that this has been done, although we
have not been notified.

GERENDE

2.: During the reporting period, tne case officer has been
meeting GERENDE an average of three times per week. Meetings
are usually pre-arranged, at various sites and times. Meetings
average 20 to 30 minutes. GERENDE turns over to the case
officer nematives, prints, logs, and other reports which he has
picked up from the base houses Since the previous meeting,
along with brief contact reports on his meetings with base
house representatives, Reports on other operational activities
are also turned in and discussed, and GERENDE is given instruc~
tions, notes for the base houses, and negatives for any enlarge-
ments which may be desired by the Station. Also, LIENVOY tapes
and transcripts are exchanged at each meeting, (The departure
of. LIACUTE-1 at the end of April 1968 left the Station without a
BEDOX transcriber, As a temporary solution, pending the return
of LIACUTE-1 or the recruitment of another BEDOX transcriber, -
GERENDE's wife, LIEMPTY-19, has been hired at the rate of 31.50
pesos per hour to transcribe the Spanish language portions of the
tapes. She does the work in her home, and GERENDE transports the

tapes.)

3. GERENDE has the direct agent-handling responsibility for
the following LIEMPTY agents: _ LIEMPTY-4 (photo-processor; net
twice per week); LIEMPTY-G (LIMITED; met once per week until
termination); LIEMPTYs 13, 14, 26, and 27 (LILYRIC; LIEMPTY-13
normally met twice per week -= in his absence LIEMPTY=-27 makes
meetings); and LIEMPTY-9 (LICALLA; met twice per week). Ho is
responsible for directing their work, paying them, and handling
all of the administrative problems which may develop. To judge
from the results, GERENDE has excellent rapport with these agents
and is able to get a consistently high performance rate from
them -- particularly LICALLA and LILYRIC personnel,

‘

4. As noted in reference, GERENDE was employed by the
Mexican MHRAVEL committee, which we found a useful side benefit,
His MHRAVEL activity during the reporting period has been minimal,
but we expect it to start picking up again, GERENDE has con-
ducted a few discreet inquiries and investigations for us within
the MHRAVEL complex, and wo have instructed him to try to get
an assignment which will keep him as close to the FJSTEAL
delegation as possible.

5. Reference also pointed out that GERENDE had perforned
nicely in the cultivation and development of an operational
lead, and that the Station planned to give GERENDE more of the
same. Furthermore, GERENDE'S standing assignments’ (LIEMPTY.
base houses, MHRAVEL activity, and occasional support 01 JiROD
requirements) were not challenging enough or occupying enough
of GERENDE's tine. GERENDE is rather firmly. committed to
WOFIRM by virtue of the fact that he has worked for WOFIRM for
over 13 years and has no other outside employment of any.
consequence. By‘ the sane token, he was, through no fault of
his own, doing less work for WOFIRM than at any time in his
career. GERENDE'S operational exposure through the years _
dicta. ea ons 01 S activity,.for sound
security reasons. The solution. to GERENDE’S problem (lack of
a promising future) and the Station's (not ‘getting its money's ~
worth) seemed to be to give GERENDE additional tasks which he.
could handle under suitable cover ‘and with due regard to security
precautions, Since most of GERENDS's support activities had
been against the FJSTEAL target, particular care would have to
be taken in committing him further in this direction, It was
decided, therefore, that his principal retooling would be in
a non-FJSTEAL field. :



[DP aTew arasGc ano SUMEER

“ CONTINUATION OF

SiseAtch TMtA-35080

G, In line with the above reasoning, GERENDE was introduced
{esa 17 February 1968. ie idea was that
wou e trained to assist n some of his

operations against targets. GERFNDE's principal
duty thus far has bi over the handling of :RFAIN-3,
under close supervision and guidance, GERENDE has
performed quite creditably in this task, . He seems interested
in the work and has learned quickly. On the other hand, an
apparently ingrained habit of procrastination has resulted in
dilatory reporting, If GERLNDE can overcome this (and both case
officers are working hard to teach GERENDE the importance of
prompt and complete reporting) there seems to be every reason
to believe GERENDE will develop into a competent agent handler,

7. GERENDE was also given the task of locating and developing
(in alias) a girl who, per LIENVOY, was being cultivated by
AERODENT, Although GERENDE had to be continually reminded of the
assignnent, he did an excellent job of meeting the girl and
gaining her confidence. It is quite likely that he cquld have
recruited the girl as an access agent against AERODINT, but as
this point was reached another operation against AERODENT was
launched and it was not felt. that attempting to recruit the girl
would serve any useful purpose, for the time being at least
(among other things, there was no indication that she had had
any contact with AERODENT for some months). ‘The only flaw in
GERENDE's performance was the time it took him to get around to
doing the job. It should be mentioned, however, that at the
Same time GERENDE had a number of pressing personal*matters to
attend to, including overseeing the completion of his new house,
which he finally moved into on 10 March 1968, even though
construction is still not entirely completed,

8. Among other assignments completed by GERENDE in the
reporting period were the renting of an apartment for use as a
listening post; and initiating a relationship with a Russian
translator working. for the KERAVEL committee,

Reference: HME 8751

1. Before amending GZZENDE'’s contract in accordance vith
reference, we vould like to clarify a few points about GERENDE
and about terminations and resignations in general.

2. We assune from the files that GEREEDE's performance has

been entirely satisfactory but since there are no efficiency re-

ports or actual evidence of outstanding performance, we would
: like to have a statement from the station which would justify the
= requested amendsent. Nine years ago the station said, in IDMA.
13573 that “station would not want to give GERENDE a terminal
payment if he elects to resign just to receive some extra soney
or to parsue sone other career." That vas a long time ago, how-
ever, and thirteen years of loyal collaboration may very well
have changed your mind oa this point.

contract the proviso that. full retireaent benefits (three sonths
salary plus one month's lary for each year worked) ‘should apply
after, say, twenty year's service, vith lesser benefits to apply
between nov and then? i

4. Could you recapitulate for’ us the prevailing Mexican law
or custom (which 1s 1t?) oa termination-at-the-convenience-of-the-
esployer? A aunber of months ago you told us that it was three
months pay plus 20-days-per-year-workec, but the LIFIRE/4 and 5
KMOC's said thit “following local custom of termination subject only
bas to be paid one month's salary for each year of employment".

Your propused GEKENDE terminal payment formula, (which may be a
special case rather than a pattern and ehich, as ve understand it,
pokes no distinction between voluntary resignation and termination-
at-the-convenience-of-the-employer) is one sonth's pay for each
full year of employsent, plus three months pay at the rate applic-
able at the time of termination. Does this imply: that the one -
month's pay for each year worked is conputed at the rate of pay pie~
vailing during each respective year worxed? Does Mexican law or
custom dictate the payment of terminal bonus to employees who resign
voluntarily? (Working for WOFIRM ia a very special case, obviously,
and deserves exceptional financial consideration, but we do want to
understand the background ag it applies to commercial work so that
we may have @ frame of reference or point of departure).

5. We apologize for the long delay in sending thie dispatch.
It was originally written in Karch, and mislaid in transit, but we
thought it had been pouched.

6. Apart from the foregoing, do you recommend any changes in
GERENDE's contract which will be due for renewal on 1 October 18687
