Tused this assignment. .t that time,Subject’s mothor

of which coukd have taken place annrox.Auguat 1960.

At thoso meetings GHONGIY asked asain if Subject had
comnlied with his request for a vritten statenont,if
ho had been at the Embassy,if he had becono ‘acquainted
with anyone fron the Danish nersonnel of the American

-hmbassy. In the meantine, Subject had revenled to hia

and not speak with anybody anymore, inxsubjact was

In Cetober 1936 Subject moved to his present address
