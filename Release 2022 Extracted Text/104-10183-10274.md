Introduction.

1. The General Directorate of Intelligence (Direccion General de
Inteligencia — DGI) is the Cuban external intelligence agency,
Gharged with maintaining security, collecting information,
and promoting Cuban Government intelligence policies abroad.
It is part of the Ministry of Interior (Ministerjo del tnte-
rior), and was established sometime in mid-1961. Tt is con-
cerned caly with operations abroad. The collection cf
intelligence within Cuba, counterintelligence, and security
are the responsibility of the Department of State Security
(Departamento de Seguridad del Estado - DSE). The two agencies
are independent but maintain Jiaison and coordination on cer-

tain matters.

2. The DGI, also known as "M," or “M Department," is organized
under a dircctor general and his deputy; its components, are
a main headquarters with administrative and personnel offices,
eight departments, and the director's office (see organization

+ Chart of page 14).2 It is closely connected with Ramiro Valdes
Sienendez, the Minister of Interior,’ and is also of continuing

gates located near the centet of the block on 80th Street. and a
back entrance with steel doors located directly through the
block on 78th Street. The main entrance is manned by quards
arned with PPShA machineguns;' the rear entrance is kept locked
and is used only in emergencies. No pass or identification is
required to enter the grounds,

The headquarters compound (see diagram on page 15) contasns all
the DGI offices except PINEIRO's home office, the three: opera-
tional departments, and the Special Schools Department, described
below. The main building. called M Building, is situated near
the center of the compound but off the main axis between the
gates. It houses most of the offices in its two stories and also
contains a canteen, public telephones, and a police radio for the
city and the Ministry of Interior. There are no large assembly
rooms; conferences are held in small rooms, Within the compound,
separated from M Building by driveways and parking lots, are
several other structures:

a. A two-story building housing the Personnel Department on the .

first floor and the Inspection Department on the second.

b. Three one-story service buildings: a guard office with
sleeping quarters for 20 to 25 guards, a food-storage ware-
house, and a clothing-storage warehouse. The guard office
itnd the Personnel-Inspection building flank the main entrance

on 80th Street,

c. A two-story building, in the angle of the grounds formed by
78th Street and 49th Avenue, housing the Technical Operational
Support Department, Two of its sections, the Photographic
Laboratory and the Concealment Device Section, occupy indi-
vidual buildings in the compound.

General administrarion of the DGI is handled from the M Building,
where PINEIRO's deputy, (fnu) CHAIN,7 pseudonym "Agusto," has

his office. Besides acting as director general when PINEiRO is
away frou Cuba, CHAIN is responsible specifically for management
of large expenditures, South American affairs, and the approval

of false passports for travelers. He signs, in pseudonym, all
notices and circulars issued to the directorate. His secretary
has the pscudonym "Georgina." CHAIN's office, through “Vidalina,"
distributes cable traffic to the DGI departments. Incoming and
outgoing cable traffic and diplomatic pouch traffic are received
at this office from the Central Ciphering Service (Servicio
Central de Cifradus ~ SCC), which is a communal coding and de-
coding service operated by the DSE. CHAIN's office apparently
also acts as a receiving and distributing center for clandestine
radio traffic but docs not itself send or receive radio messages;
the actual transmission is possibly controlled by the Communist

Party.

the DSE, and some of the office staff are also former DSK nember’.

Soviet Advisors.

Attached to the DGI headquarteis is a group of Soviet advisors,
who occupy offices in M Building. Their presence and identities
are kept as secret as possible, even among the officers who work
with them, and they are known only by pseudonyms. They have
especially close contacts with Manuel PINEIRO and CHAIN, and
with the Illogal Department, whose officers can consult directly
with them at any time. Ordinary desk officers in other depart-
ments can consult the Soviet advisors only at their offices in
M Building,.where no special security precautions are observed,
but they do not see much of them except when visiting the
Illegal Department when the advisors are working there. The

~Sovieta can visit any department whenever they wish.

“Information obtained by DGI agents abroad can be passed to the

Soviet advisors.8 The five known are the following:

His Spanish is fairly good, Ie has a car assigned by the
Cuban government and drives it himself.

b. A Soviet man, name unknown, accompanies "El Frances." He
is five feet eight inches tall, is of medium to thin build,
woighing about 145 pounds, and is clean shaven. An officer
who saw him frequently at DGI headquarters never heard him

speak,

“Juan,” who shares an M Building office with "51 Frances”
but works principally in the Illegal Department, is the
consultant on illegal operations, directs the recruitment
and handling of agents, arranges their entry and cover, and
maintains files, At ono tino he spent about six months in
France; the general. impression is that he was there as an
illogal resident rather thon in the Soviet Fmhassy. He
speaks excellent Spanish with very little accent and ap-
parently has known the language a long tine. He too has a
car assigned by the Cuban government and drives it hinself.
Ho was born between 1919 and 1924 and is an active, athletic

Of the eight departments making up the headquarters, three are
operational, four are concerned with operational support or
training. and one is administrative, The three operational de-
partments are Legal Centers (Centros Legales - MS), Illegal

the last two were formerly a single department, known as MA
(Intelligence), All three departments handle operations abroad

both in countries with which Cuba has relations and in those with

with Communist Parties or organized leftist groups abroad; the
National Liberation Department deals mainly with such parties

and groups; the Department of Leal Centers may work with them
srounilaterally. All three departments are organized in geo-

22. The Department of Illegal Centers (Departamento Centros Ilegales - +
; The department is not, as its name implies, concerned With

operation of illegal ficld stations. but is an information col-
lection and agent candidate spotting department. It has three
major responsibilities: collection of information from foreigners
visiting Cuba; assessment of visiting foreigners for candidates
for intelligence agents; and screening of letters from abroad
volunteering info tion, both to extract any useful data and to
assess the writers as possible candidates for intelligence use.
Among visiting foreigners, the MO Department does: not concern it-+
self with diplomats, they are left to the DSE. nor with foreigners
who are established residents of Cuba. who are the responsibility

er of the Colonial Bureau (see below). In debriefing foreign visi-

7 tors, the department often works through ICAP, which makes arrange-
ments for many its to Cuba: in many instances, the visitors
supply information unwittingly and are never aware that they are
in contact with Cuban intelligence. The MO Department does not
itself recruit agents; it only watches for, screens, and evaluates
foreign contacts as agent candidates. If the persons it selects
are members of a Communist Party or leftist organization, they
are referred to the LN Department: if they are not members of
such groups. they are referred to the Illegai Department; one
of those two units does the actual recruiting.

23. The Department of Special Schools (Departamento Escuelas
Especiales - EE). This department is respousible for training
in guerrilla warfare and related subjects. It is headed by Luis
PIREZ, pseudonym “Bruno Diaz," who is a DGI officer but also a
captain in the Cuban Army. He has a deputy, pseudonym
"Aristides": an office assistant, pseudonym “Armando”; and a
courier, pseudonym "Garcia." The department staff, numbering
more than 50, is made up.entirely of Cuban Army personnel on
indefinite assignment to the DGI; they are directed by the DGI
but continue to be paid by the Army, which also provides all sup-
port for the department. The main office of the EE Department,
which is nly administrative, is a residence at 178th Street
and and 31st Avenue, telephones 21-8426 and 21-8262,° in the
Bafandilla section of the Marianao suburb of Habana. Training
is conducted at permanent school sites in Habana (none outside).
including guerrilla warfare schools at 310 51st Avenue. in the
Country Club district, and three in the Marianao subur' one
in the western part of the Arroyo Arenas section, one in the
western part of the San Agustin section, and one in the area
bounded by 214th and 226th Strects and 7th and 15th Avenues in
the Biltmore section. In addation there are technical training

a main office staff consisting of a secretary. pseudonym "Mayra';
two assistants. pseudonyms "Carmen" and “Maria Antonia"; and an

tinkes to process technical communications for the departments

chief is pseudonym "Maceo." The ENB Section is responsible
for providing any sort of concealment device required for
agent activities, especially those permitting the agent to
carry with him on his travels instructions, information, or
small objects so that they are not discovered in customs or
other examination, It also provides concealment devices for
the forwarding of microfilm or other clandestine materials.

Department of Information Services (Departamento Servicios de

the DGI (after PINEIRO and CHAIN), who also directs some of the
LN Department operational activities. The department is responsi-
ble for collecting information and maintaining up-to-date records
of operational information in every field affecting the security
of Cuba. It has three sections:

a. Operational Information Section (Seccion Informacion
Operativa - 10). Tne section, which has about 12 members,
collects all information necessary for placing and maintaining
an agent in a foreign country, such as the travel and identity
documents required and their dates of validity, data for
legal and illegal travel of staff personnel and agents, maps
of infiltration and exfiltration routes for operational areas,
and up-to-date information on the general situation in each
country where the DGI operates or plans to operate. The
operational and other departments evaluate information they
acquire and send to the [0 Section of the SI Department what-
ever they think useful; the IO Section issues no formal re-
quirements. Most of the information comes from the Ilegal
and LN Departments, but the MS Department may also supply
information. The [0 Section sometimes debriefs staff members
returning from foreign tours or short trips for operational
information or data on foreign governments, but it does not
debrief agent trainees arriving in Cuba. It has ‘one other
function, the publication of false information on people
and countries. One of its members is a translator, Antonio
CARCENO Ferrer, pseudonym "Andres."

Headq

The DGI was probably established in the general reorganization
of Cuban intelligence services begun with the establishment of
the Ministry of Interior in June 1961 and continued for several
months thereafter. At that tine all Cuban intelligence agencies
were put under the new civilian ministry. and the former G-2
overall intelligence organization, which was under military con-
trol, also was civilianized as the Department of State Security
(DSE}. The-internal and external intelligence services were aP-
parently separated at that time: previously they had both been
handled by G-2.

Other aspects of the DGI such as operations will be discussed
in subsequent reports.

Ramiro VALDES has been head of Cuban intelligence since 1959;
before June 1961 he was head of G-2, but with the establishment
of the Ministry of Interior he was appointed minister. He has
continued to devote special attention to intelligence activities

in that capacity.

PINEIRO is an experienced intelligence officer, associated with
Cuban foreign intelligence since 1959.

This number is not listed in the Habana 1962 telephone directory.

DGI officers are normally known by pseudonyms rather than true
names. AS a result, source knew many of his colleagues only by
pseudonym and never heard their truc names, Ramon Cesar CUENCA
Nontoto, a section chief in the {llegal Department, is known by
true name and apparently does not have a pseudonym, and PINEIRO
is known by true name.

CHAIN is probably Army Captain Carlos Sixto CHAIN Soler. an intel-
ligence officer who ved in Washington, D.C,, as a member of

the Cuban Mission to the Organization of American States in 1961
and early 1962; the mission was withdrawn in early 1962.

Source had no information about Soviet operations in Latin
America.

The Soviet Bloc countries with which Cuba maintains relations are:

Europe: Albania, Bulgaria. Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary,
Poland. Rumania, the USSR, and Yugoslavia.

Asia: Communist China. Mongolia, North Korea, and North Vietnam.

The ‘non-Bloc countries with which Cuba maintains diplomatic rela-

tions are:

Europe: Austria. Belgium. Denmark, Finland. France, Greece,
Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg. the Netherlands, Norway,
Portugal. Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United
Kingdom. There are also Cuban missions to the Vatican
and to the United Nations European Office in Geneva.

Asia: Ceylon, India. Indonesia, Iraq. Israel, Japan, Lebanon,

and Pakistan.

Africa: Algeria. Ghana, Guinea, Mali, Morocco, Tanganyika, and
the United Arab Republic.

PINEIRO has his office in his residence at 41st Avenue and

returned to the department ox section that maintains them.
There is a daily courier service between his house and the DGI
headquarters. The house has at least two separate telephones
one personal and one official, the latter providing direct com-
Sunigation with all government agencics. One of the telephone
