CIA, are as follows: He was born 20 October 1927, the first son
of Ivan Isidorovich NOSENKO, shipyard worker who in 1939 was to
become Soviet Minister of Shipbuilding. After Graduating in 1951
from the Institute of International Relations in Moscow, where
he specialized in internatiunal law and the English language,
NOSENKO entered the Chief Intelligence Directorate (GRU) of the
Soviet Navy, serving first as a translator assigned to the intel-
ligence staff of the Seventh (Far Eastern) Fleet and then as a
senior translator and political officer at en intelligence unit
of the Fourth (Baltic) Fleet. In mid-March 1953,. immediately
following STALIN's death, 'OSENKO left the Naval GRU to-become a
junior case officer in the KGB. He was assigned to-the U.S.
Embassy Section of the American. Departinent, KGB Second Chief
Directorate, from 1952 to mid@-1955. During this pericd he was
initially responsible for operational activity surrounding Am-
erican journalists in Moscow and later for operations against
U.S. Army Attaches at the Embassy. When transferred to the newly
organized Tourist Department of the Second Chief Directorate in
1955, KOSENKO had as his targets vi.itors to the Soviet Union
from the United States anda the countries of the British Common-
wealth. Having handled a numoer of successful tourist opera-
tions, NOSENKO in 1958 was promoted to Deputy Chief of the
section responsible for operations egainst American, Eritish,
and Canadian nationals. Eighteen months later NuSENKO returned
to the U.S, Embassy Section as its Deputy Chief. Between January
1960 and January 1962 he was second-in-charge of all KGS activ-
ities against the U.S. Embsssy in Moscow and personally super-

i vised operations against tre Embassy Security Officer, tne

Second Chief Directorate's most important counterintelligence
target at the time, and against American code clerks, collec-
tively the Directorate’s most important recruitment targets.
At thy December 1961 NOSENKO again was transferred to
hecfoarist. Shoarement, this time as Chief of the American-
Britisn-Canaédian Section. Six months later he was made Deputy
Chief of the Tourist Department, and in mid-1963 he became its

‘ First Deputy Chief.

From the time he first contacted CIA in Geneva in 1962,

. NOSENKO's status has been under examination. Only how, three
years following his defection in February 1964, is @ definitive
study of the bona fides question possible:. the voluminous and
diverse reports by NOSENKO, coupled with collateral information,
required that much time for assimilation, correlation, investiga-
tion, and evaluation. NOS=NKO's own testimony, interspersed with
representative’ subsidiary cases stemming from or related to his
reports, constitutes a large part cf the evidence. This review
also draws upon statements and actions by other Soviets, colla-

tions with materials from other sources, and opinions by special-

ists of various kinds. These factual elements are presenteé
without comment or interpretation, except in the penultimate
section of the review where the evidence on’the bona fides of
NOSENKO is evaluated and analyzed.

_ IZ. | SUMMARY OF CPERATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS |

_ As Introduetion

Prem the CIA side, the NOSENKO case can be divided into
three periods: the first Geneva phase of June 1962, the second
Geneva phase of January-February 1964, and the post-defection
handling of NOSENKO from Fetruary 1964 to date. The rest of
Part II is separated into these three periods accordingly.

B. Firat Geneva Phase (June 1962)

The NOSENKO case opened on 5 June 1962 in the corridors of
the Palais des Nations in Geneva during the United Nations Dis-
armament Conference. A then-unidentified Soviet, known to him
by sight from conference ncetinys,. approached U.S. Foreign Ser-
vice Officer David MARK with the suggestion that they get to-
gether for a talk the following day, In the late afternoon of
6 June, the same Soviet motioned MARK aside and said that he
would like to taik to him privately as soon as possible. He
told MARK that he was “not going to pump him for information,
but simply wanted to tel some things." A luncheon neeting
was arranged for 9 June, ugh the Soviet clearly preferred
an earlier date. MARK advised CIA of the appointment, explain-
ing that he thought the upproach so unusual that it might be
an offer of cooperaticn or He said he believed the
Soviet to be Yuriy Ivanov. O, a member of the Soviet
delegation to the arms calxs.

with MARK, NOSENKO told MARK that
he, NOSENKO, was a KGB co! erintelligence officer sent to
Geneva to ensure the security of the Soviet delegation. He knew
that MARK had previously served in Moscow and believed he war
connected with American Inteliligence.* He needed approximately
900 Swiss francs immediately to cover KGB operational funds which
he squandered on liquor and a prostitute in Geneva, and he offered
for this amount to sell txo pieces of information to American
Intelligence. The first of these was the identity of a former
U.S. Embassy employee in Moscow who was a KGB agent and, as of
1962, was “near ciphers" in the Washington area; the second was
the identity of a Soviet in Moscow who, although ostensibly a
CIA agent, was actually planted on American Intelligence. Al-
though NOSENKO at first told MAPK that he would stop at the sale
of these two items, he later stated: "I know you won't let me
alone now." At another point NOSENKO said: "I will not work in
Moscow, but I come out about once a year." NOSENKO also gave
MARK a brief chronological account of his personal and profes-
sional past. MARK explained™that although he was not an intel-
ligence officer, he could place NOSENKO in contact with the
Intelligence Chief in Geneva later that same day.

At the 9 June lunch

MARK introduced NOSENKO to a CIA officer at 2000 hours that
evening, and a three-nour meeting followed at a CIA safehouse in
Geneva. Describing himseif as a KGB Major experienced in opera-
tions against the. American Embassy in Moscow and against tourists
and other travellers to the Soviet Union, NOSENKO told the CIA

officer of his financial difficulties and repeated his offer to
sell two items of information. He said that the need for money
was his immediate motive for contacting CIA, although in the en-
suing discussion he said also that he was dissatisfied with the
Communist regime in the Soviet Union. NOSENKO emphasized, never-
theless, that he had no intention of becoming an American agent--
this was to be a one-time transaction, and after that he would
have no further contact with CIA,

Despite this original reticence, NOSENXO supplied consider-
able biographic information on himself and also discussed in
general terms certain additional KGB operations es well as KG
organizat:on and operational methods in Mcscow, He understoc:l,
as he had told K earlier in the day. that CIA would want more
information than the two items which he originally offered, and
he agreed to meet again two days later.

NOSENKO met CIA representatives £ more times in G
in June 1962. alwavs in the same safero . Wath the second
meeting on 11 June. his initial reservations disappeared ‘almost
entirely. He answered most questions put to him on KGB orgeni-
zation and operations. most of his information oeing concerned
with the Second Chief Directorate. responsible for counterintel-
lagence and security within the USSR, NOSENKO seemed to be what
he claimed to ke: a KGB officer im a sensitive position with
knowledge of amportant KGB operations,

NOSENKO returned to Moscow on 15 June. having promised to
do everything within the limits imposed by personal security con-
siderations to collect information of interest: the areas of CIA
interest had been outiined to him, The only restrictions he
placed on his cooperation were his absolute refusal to permit
operational contact with him inside the USSR and his request
that no mention of his collaboration be made in correspondence
to Moscow. He promised to rotify CIA. via an adéress he was
given, when he came to the West again.

C€.. Second Geneva Phase (January-February 1964)

NOSENKO accompanied the Soviet delegation to a later ses-
sion of the Disarmament Conference (one having gone by in the
interim without his participation). arriving in Geneva on
19 January 1964, The next day he sent a cable to his CIA accom-
modation address announcing his presence, At the first of the
new series of meetings on 23 January he announced that he had
decided to defect to the United States citing as reasons his
continuing disaffection with the Soviet regime and the fact that
he probably would not have further opportunities to travel to the
West in the foreseeable future. Although he implied that he
wanted to defect as soon as possible. he agreed to remain in
place in Geneva for at least two or-three weeks while arrange-
ments for his reception were being made in Washington, NOSENKO
had brought a large amount of new information, much of it in
scribbled notes, on KGB operational activity collected in the
18 months since his last meeting with CIA. Twelve more meetings
were held in a Geneva safehouse over the next twelve days, yary-
ing in length from one and.a half to six hours. i

D. Post-Defection Handling (February 1964-Present

: On 4 February, four days before the date tentatively
selected for NOSENKO's defection, he reported that.a cable had
been received from KGB Headquarters ordering his immediate re-
turn to participate in a KGB conference on foreign tourism to

patties

At the request of the Swiss and Soviet Governments, NOSENKO

met on 14 February with representatives of their respective
Washington Embassies in the offices of the U.S. Immigration and
an Naturalization Service. He told both that he had defected of
his own free will after careful consideration and that he had no
desire to return to the Soviet Union. In anewer to the questions
of the Soviet representatives, he orally renounced his status and
‘ rights as a citizen of the USSR.

CIA completed its initial debriefings of NOSENKO on 18 Febru-
ary, and on 24 February he was introduced to representatives of
the FBI for questioning. At about the sume time, there was a
marked decline in NOSENKO's discipline: He became evasive and
uncooperative, refusing to answer some of the questions of his
debriefers, both CIA and FBI; his nightlife. in Washington and
nearby cities was punctuated by drinking bouts, crude behavior,
and cisputes with his security escort, He explained these
actions by saying that he was under great tensicn as a result of
his defection, abandonment of his wife and children, and the
@isgrace that he had brought to his family name. It was against
this background that CIA acceded to NOSENKO's demand for a vaca-
tion. On 12 Marcn, therefore, NOSENKO left Washington with a
CIA case officer and two CIA security guards for a two-week
vacation in Hawaii. There his behavior deterioriated still fur-
ther: He drank heavily and almost constantly; he engaged in {
sexual acts with a number of prostitutes; he was loud and crude 1,
in ic places; and he spent monev_extravacently |

'
!

and conspicuously

Sem OREO

During NOSENKO's absence, cdnsultations were held with
the FBI concerning steps to be taken to restrict his movements
and activities. Both agencies feared that his behavior would
bring about unwanted attention and publicity, perhaps police
arrest, and that doubts about his bona fides, which were be-
coming known to a widening group of people in the U.S. Govern-
ment, might be inadvertently revealed to NOSENKO himself. The |
FBI on ] April said it would “not interpose objection" ‘to ‘the }
: CIA plan to limit NOSENKO's freedom of movement. The Acting
: Attorney General, the Department of State, and the White House

were also notified of the CIA plan at this time.

In the morning of 4 April NOSENKO was driven to another.
safehouse in a Washington suburb, ostensibly only. for a poly-
graph examination. At the safehouse NOSENKO was given a rou-
tine polygraph examination, lasting over three hours; he

"reacted significantly” to questions concerning his intentions
in defecting tn the United States and other related matters.*
He was then told that he would remain at this safehouse, which
thencefcrward was his regular placa of residence. Since this
time NOSENKO has had contacts with CIA personnel only, has been
under full-time guard, and has not been permitted access to
news media.

Detailed interrogation of, NOSENKO was begun on 4 April 1964
in order to obtain information which he had been reluctant to
give in debriefings, and to clarify contradictions in what he
had already reported. This phase of the interrogations was termi-
nated on 24 April 1964. EE

Despite the searching nature of the questions and the im-
plicit and explicit doubts of his veracity, NOSENKO proved him-
self willing to answer, or to try to answer, questions put to
him. Because much more information pertinent to the quescion of
his bona fides had to be obtained, a new phase of interrogation
was Begun in mid-May 1964. Different interrogators were intro-
duced and questioning was resumed in a neutral, non-hostile man-
nla The period of neutral questioning continued until mid-Novem-
ber 1964. ; :

After further consultations with the FBI, a new round of :
hostile interrogations began on 26 January 1965. NOSENXO was i
questioned for a total of about 140 hours by individual interro- i 7
gators and by interrogation teams consisting of two o> three
men, and he was directly challenged on many of his previous re-
ports. He admitted that certain of his earlier statements had
been incorrect, and that he could not explain contradictions in
his testimony. Nevertheless, NOSENKO maintained he had been
basically truthful, and that he had come to the United States
solely for the reasons he had originally given. This interro-
gation was broken off on 5 March 1965.

Questioning of NOSENKO during the summer and autumn of 1964
and the interrogations of January and February 1965 concentrated
on the period of his claimed service in the U.S. Embassy Section
of the American Department, KGB Second Chief Directorate, from
January 1960 to January 1962. Among the reasons for selecting
this particular period were the comparatively large amount of
collateral information available against which NOSENKO's state-
ments could be checked; the importance of the U.S. Embassy and
its personnel as. the outstanding KGB Second Chief Directorate
targets; their importance from the standpoint of American |
security; and the extent of NOSENKO's knowledge about the acti-
vities of the U.S. Embassy Section, in his capacity as its
Deputy Chief.

In keeping with Soviet practice, CIA asked NOSENKO in
February 1965 to sign a series of interrogation reports, so~
-- galled “protocols,” most: of which concern: the period -of: his
claimed service in the American Department. . These were written
by. the CIA interrogators, and they were designed to incorporate

¥—Bee Part VII.c. for a further discussion of the polygraph
tests. a



NOSENKO's exact statements and meaning on-various specific sub-
jects. The protocols were in no way presented to NOSENKO as
documentary portions of a “confesaion,” but rather as distilled
and final statements of what he dié end did not know concerning
particular topics. NOSENKO was asked to read each page of each
protocol carefully and to sign his name at the bottom te indi-~
cate that he understood and agreed with its contents; he was”
allowed the use of a dictionary end was permitted to ask any
questions and make any changes that he wished. (Amendments were
entered by the interrogators and were initialed by NCSENKO.)
NOSENKO was asked, after reading.each page and after completing
the entire protocol, whether he understood what was written there
and whether there were any more changes he wished to make. He
was then asked to sign and date the statement, "I nave read and
understood this report and certify it as correct," at the end of
the final page. With one exception, which will be noted later,
he did so calmly and without objections, although on one or two
of them he remarked that his statements were presented in such

a Manner as to make them look foolish; although invited to do

80, he was not able to suggest any changes of fact or presenta-
tion which would. make them more accurate. Commenting cn the -
use of interrogation reports, NOSENKO said on 4 March 1965:

"My life story is absolutely correct. Anytring I have signed

is absolutely correct. I absolutely understand what I am doing
when I am signing any paper. This is an official document, and
I fully understand what I'm doing when I sign it as being abso-
lutely correct."

: In May 1965 a CIA psychologist questioned NOSENKO in detail
on his life from birth until 1953, when he said he entered the
XGB,-in an attempt to gain additional insights into his charac~
ter and personality. 7

’
Further questioning was conducted from 26 July until 1% August
1965 with the participation of Peter DERYABIN, a former KGB offi-
cer. These interrogations, the first to be held in Russian,
were for the purpose of using DERYABIN's first-hand experience
in the KGB to obtain a clearer understending of NOSENKO's per~
sonal and professional background.

There were no further debriefings or interrogations until
18 October 1966. On this date NOSENKO was polygraphed on the
case of Lee Harvey CSWALD.

During the period 19-25 October 1966, NOSENKO was questioned for
seven days on specific aspects of selected topics ranging from his
identity to his involvement in and knowledge of specific KGB opera-
tions. Questioning was in both Russian and English.

superiors: "They talked about rxism, the Chinese, Yugoslavia, E
and love; NOSENKO was obviously smitten with her, became verbally
amorous, and told her that he would like to take her off to a
desert island." The girl felt that NOSENKO probably was not
interested in her for intelligence purposes, but seemed to be
genuinely attracted by her. From her conversations with NOSENKO
she was able to report that “he had been in submarines during
the war and, according to himself, had risen to the rank of
Commander. He was e member of the Communist Party. His father
was in the Ministry of Shipping. We himself had served in the

*Although NOSENKO was described in reports (held by CIA) con- °
cerning recruitment approaches to fmcricans in Moscow .prior to
ns first arrival in Geneva, there was no basis in these re-
ports to identify the Soviet described as NOSENKO. The name
NOSENKO did not appear in these earlier reports.



At his second reeting with CIA on 11 June 1962, NOSENKO
described the same incident, in the context cf reporting a pcs~
able KGB penetration of British counterintelligence: “I decided
to try to take this English girl to bed, And this had nothing
to do with work. No, it was simply (sex)...And Yurka (Yuriy
GUK, First Chief Directorate officer in Geneva] said to me:
‘Listen, Yura. Be careful, because we have people cven in
British counterintelli,ence.'" NOSENKO described tne incident
as follows:

“After I had been here a week or two there was a
reception for members of the delegation and at it I saw
a certain English girl. Then RUSK gave a reception and she
was there again. I came to the reception, she saw me,
and I went up to her. She said that it was very nice to
make my acquaintance, and that's all. ROSOV (TSYNBAL)
was there. He saic to m Yura, it loo you
are going to bed with that girl.’ I ans ‘What do i
you mean, Mikhail Scepanovich? She just i sts me.! :

listen further, After this she used to qo to tie Disarma-
ment Conferences. Weli, to make it short, I asked thi
girl for a date, She is Scottish h, net English,
and works in an office here, We agreed to reet at a
restaurant. I asxei my friends which restaurant here is
the best, where there isn't a crowd. We went to the restau-
rant and sat there all evening--all alone. ‘iicre were just
the two of us. The taurant is under the ground and is i
called 'Day and q in Russian, "Sour et Nuit.' We
sat there and then she asked me where we Gould reet ayain.
A day later we met again. Again in the restaurant and then
we took a walk. She got me bothered and then gave me the
brush-off. I called her once. She wasn't at home. I
called again. Again she was out. I called a third time.
t She wasn't there. She thought that I was an intelligence
H officer and that I was interested in her for this reason. 7
This, honestly, wasn't so. I had only one thing in mind.
She was quite a woman...But the English girl felt that i
she was being developed. I met three times with her. |
Three times we were at the restaurant and she.told them

told them this and they [NOSENKO whistled, apparently sig-
nifying that they terminated the relationship] at once.
She knew from the very beginning that I am Russian, from
: : |... the very beginning. In short, I told her a lot of things--
t well, you know--so to get her into bed. Well, we were
i walking on the quay and I said to her: ‘How about going
up to your place?" she answered: 'I can't.' ‘why?! I
said, ‘I'll take off my shoes: and come on tiptoe.’ She
answered: ‘Is it: possible for me to come to you?’ TI
said: ‘You can't come to my place. There would be a
knock on the door at once. The Swiss would tell the
Americans and that would be the end. I can't do this.*
So all I could do was have her next to the parapet. But
the English felt--and nothing was heard about this, but

When NOSENKO arrived in Geneva for the first tine on

There is a special [KGB] department for delegations, a special
one, recently creatnd, And-the chief of this departrent is
simultaneously a deputy chief of the [Second Chief| Directorate.
He is both chicf of the department and deputy chief of the
directorate so that there will be a person who can be held re-
sponsible if anything happens. Understand? The chief of the
directorate (0.5. GRINANOV) hated to sign all sorts of recon~
mendations and so on, when someone can run off in Belgium or
wherever he may be. ‘This happened more than once, and he was
summoned before the [CPSU] Central Committee. Therefore, he
decided to create a new position. ‘Tne person holdirg it is

on tie carpet...so that blame would fall not on the chief of
the directorate, but on his deputy, who is in charge of this
department and who signed off...

“This department," NOSENKO continued, "is concerned with
departures abroad, that is, it checks all Sovict citizens who
intend to travel abroad, both alone and as members of delegations.
Since GOLITSYN [defected] in Finland, we have an order that no
delegation is to bo lot out without an operational worker, not
a single delegation... With me it happened as follows: I was
not planning to go. They told me: ‘You are going.' I said:
"I can't. I have a section. I have 15 people there, all
operating people. Am I supposed to dump them? What can I do?'
‘No, you are going,’ was the reply. ‘And what did tke chief

when he spoke of thc "chief".] said: 'GROMYKO is going this

on an appropriate levwl must go with him. Not a case officer,
not a senior case officer, not a deputy, but the chief of a

chief.' Well, I was the most junior section chief. I was
called in to my chiof, my immediate chief, who is concerned
with the Seventh Department. They had told him that it would
be for a month and on this basis he gave me permission. And
I have been here since 10 March.”

Later during this second meeting NOSENKO volunteered that
in addition to his sccurity officer functions in Geneva, he had
@ special assignment to check on P.F. SHAKHOV, a senior advisor
to the Soviet Delegation.* SHAKHOV had been noted in contact

SHAKHOV has served in and visited the
United States on numorous occasions since 1942, when he was



14-0005,

with David MARX, believed by the KGB to be a CIA officer;
NOSENKO reported, and on this basis the KGB suspected that
SHAXHOV might be an American age~t. NOSENYKO described the
various ways he had tested these suspicions in Geneva. He
first gave SHAKHOV disinformation and looked for indications
that he passed it on to American contacts. Next, SHAKHOV was
told to perform countersurveillance tasks during a meeting by
NOSENKO with an imaginary agent, while other KGB officers
checked for signs tiat SHAKHOV had forewarned the Americans
about the meeting. Finally, NOSENKO revealed to SHAKHOV the
location of a KGB “dead drop" and checked back five days later
to see whether the specially prepared materials which had: been
Placed in it had been disturbed in any way. NOSENKO's con-
clusion from all this, he told CIA, was that SHAKHOV was ab-
solutely free of suspicion, and it was his intention to report
this finding when he returned to KGB Headquarters.

On later occasions NOSENKO reported that SHAKHOV had
previously served with the Ministry. of Foreign Affairs in the
United States and that during this period he acted as an agent
recruiter for the KGB. In 1966 NOSENKO named one person whom
SHAKHOV had spotted and developed in the United Stated,

SHAKHOV, according to NOSENKO, was not and never
haa been a KGB officer. Asked why SHAKHOV was permitted to
travel abroad when he was suspected of being an Ancrican agent,
NOSENKO explained that since SHAKHOV belonged to the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs, the KGB could do nothing about his trips
abroad. "There was no proof, only suspicions," and furthermore,
SHAKHOV was a member of the personal staff of the head of the
Soviet Delegation, S.K. TSARAPKIN.

NOSENKO was questioned again about his 1962 assignment to
Geneva during the February 1965 interrogations. His answers
were incorporated in a "protocol" which NOSENKO certified as
being correct on 26 February 1965. The protocol states:
“GRIBANOV had nothing at all to do with my assignment to Geneva
in 1962, I think that the fitness report written about me for
this trip was signed by {F.D.] BOBKOV, since he was the Deputy
Chief of the Second Chief Directorate who supervised the
Seventh [Tourist] Department. I did not personally discuss
this trip with GRIBANOV before my departure from Moscow. My
candidacy for this assignment was supported by [S.G.] BANNIKGV,
the Deputy Chief of the Second Chief Directorate, who super-
vised the work of the Eleventh [Soviet Delegations] Department

in New York as a member of the Soviet Mission to the UN in 1963.

conducted on me in connection with ny being approved for this
trip.* My assignment was approved by the Eleventh Department,
by the Personnel Office of the Second Chief Directorate, by

the Central Personnel Office of the KGB and by the Certral
Committee of the CPSU."

NOSENKO was asked why he had been selected to make this
trip immediately after assuming the duties of the Chief of the
American Tourist Section, on the eve of the tourist season,
and at a time when he had no deputy. He explained that it
was not thought that the assignment would last so leng, and
CHELNOKOV, his superior end friend, had decided to let him go

as a “treat.”

During interrogations of Octcber 1966 NOSENKO was ques~
tioned further about his 1962 assignment to Geneva as a security
officer. He said that in this capacity he would necessarily
know the identity of all other KGB officers serving with the
Soviet Disarmament Delegation in Geneva. There were only,
besides himself, the KGB First Chief Directorate officers M.S.

was an operational contact in Moscow of the Austria~Germany-
Scandanavia Department of the KGB Second Chief Directorate
and was used in operations against the West German Embassy
there. NOSENKO also said that KISLOV had been a KGB operational
contact during his earlier’ tour in the United States but was
neither then nor later a KGB officer. He characterized FILA-
Tov as a Ministry of Foreign Affairs.official and stated that
he is “definitely not an intelligence officer."

li 7 pity Chief of thé Second Chief Directorate’ thatthe SHAKHO
investigation was the main reason for his assignment to Geneva
in 1962, NOSENKO later in the day stated: "My main task was to~
check the security of the delegation, plus SHAKHOV. You can't
separate these tasks."

In this questioning NOSENKO described the basis for the
suspicions of SHAKHOV, the lack of results from earlier inves-
tigations, and his own preparation for this assignment. He
said that as a representative of the Sovict Delegations De-
partment of the Seccnd Chief Directorate, N.G. SITNIKOV had #
conducted investigations. of SHAKHOV in Geneva in 1961, but .
SITNIKOV was unable to resolve the questions concerning him.

Because of the failure of these early efforts, the KGB decided
to send “a senior guy" to the Disarmament talks in 1962, and
NOSENKO was chosen. "to finish things up." Before leaving Mos-
cow in March 1962, NOSENKO therefore discussed the SHAKHOV
case with SITNIKOV and with one (fnu) LYALIN, the Soviet Dele-
gations Department officer in charge of the SHAKHOV case; he
elso read various materials-on the case, including an investi-
gative plan drawn up by LYALIN, NOSENKO's description of these
preparations provided the basis for the questiofing which
followed:

Question: Why was SHAKHOV under suspicion in June 1962?

NOSENKO; He was working with different delegations at
different conferences and, being in Geneva,
it was noticed that there was something which 4

it begin?

@ report on him which said he was Liking life

pictured as not good and, in addition, he was
not wanting to work as on agent.

2. The 1964 TDY

NOSENKO's 1964 trip to Geneva, commencing on 19 January, was
also in the capacity of security officer with the Soviet Dis-
armament Delegation. He said he was the only security officer
for the group, which consisted of about 25 persons, and again
he was officially listed as an "expert." NOSENXKO reported that
he had three or four agents within the delegation und an equal
number of operational contacts. The only person whom he was
instructed to watch in particular was A.A. TKACHEV, an inter-
preter, who had travelled to Austria in 1960 ard 1961 and who,

the KGB had noted, was in the habit of going about by hinsel?.
Other than this, according to NOSEXKO, his responsibilities
were general in nature.

NOSENKO explained during the February 1965 interrogations
how he was selected for this TDY. The protocol ne signed on
26 February 1965 states: "GRIBANOV hac absolutely nothing to
do with my’assignment to Geneva in 1964, The fitness report
on me for this trip was signed by [F.D.] BOBKOV. For the 1964
trip no decision of approval of the Central Committee of tho
CPSU was required for me or for any other members of ‘the dele-
gation who had been approved for the 1962 trip. It was ny own
personal wish to make this trip in 1964 and I had discussed the
question with [V.D.] CHELNOKOV even in 1963 and had received
his agreement. I had also talked about this with [M.v.]
KHLOBUSTOV:; and [G.] PANCHENKO [both of the Soviet Delegations
Department]. After it had been decided that I would go, in
about the beginning of January 1964, [N.T.] ZNARIKOV, the Chie?
of the Department, suggested that a case officer might not be
required with this delegation. KHLOBUSTROV, PANCHENKO, and
[A.G.] KOVALENKO [Chief of the Tourist Department and NOSENKO's
immediate supervisor] supported me for the assignment as a
personal favor to me." With regard to GRIBANOV's knowledge pt
his assignment to Geneva this second time, NOSENKO said that he
feared that if GRIBANOV learned about the TDY he would have said,
"What, again?" and would not have permitted him to go. It was
for this reason that NOSENKO did not discuss the trip with GRI-
BANOV, he said, and he did not believe that GRIBANOV, in fact,
knew anything about it. is i

C. Motivations and, Intentions of NOSENKO : —~ .

1. Introduction

_NOSENKO has not indicated that his professional status in
the KGB, his standard of living in the Soviet Union, or his
family life prompted him to volunteer to American Intelligence
in 1962 and to defect to.the United States in 1964. He initially
told CIA that he had been. unusually successful during his ten-
year carcer as a KGB counterintelligence officer; his closest
friends and the people whom he admired most were members of the
KGB; he enjoyed his work. The XOSENKO family held & high social
position, d.their economic situation was "luxurious by- Soviet
Btandards." NOSENKO described his family life as close and.
harmonious. He spoke with fondaess and pride about his two
daughters, of his wife's: tolerance and understanding, of the
companionship she gave him; He.expressed love and a sense of
responsibility for his widowed cother, who heavily depended
upon him after the death of his father in 1956. The elder
NOSENKO won his son's admiration for having worked his way up
from an apprentice pipefitter in a shipyard to the position of
Soviet Minister of Shipbuilding. The NOSENKO name is hcnored
in the home town of Nikolayevsk, where the shipyard has been
renamed for the former minister and where a statue of him has
beén erected in the town square. By his own account, NOSENKO

_thus had had a rewarding home life and a successful and enjoy~

able career in the KGB.

‘2. Collaboration in 1962

At the outset in 1962, NOSENKO said he wanted to limit his
reports to two items of information. Before the first meeting
with CIA was over, he went beyond these two items to give de-
tails on the KGB Second Chief Directorzte and other operations,
and he offered to meet again. (Four more meetings ensued in
1962, with NOSENKO providing additional information on the KGB.)
He would not defect, NOSENKO said, unless his personal safety
was endangered by the KGB. Motivations in coming to American
Intelligence, according to NOSENKO, were his financial emergency
in Geneva and his disaffection for the Soviet regime.

a. Readiness to Report to CIA

During his 9 June meeting with David MARK, NOSENKO said he
realized, even before talking to representatives of American
Intelligence, that they would not be satisfied with the two
items of information alone--he expected them to insist on more.
He was introduced by MARK to a CIA case officer later the sane
day, and at the start of the meeting, the following dialogue
took place:

NOSENKO: You see, I am not planning to be your agent...
and don't think that I am going to work with
you in Moscow. No. No...

Why are you telling me this?

Because I wanted to come [to CIA] only for a

to receive money for this, and that's all.

abroad, we will meet one another and perhaps

I will give you someth!..5. God knows. But

that you spoke to Mr. MARK about are of great
importance to us. But I don't have to tell you
that. You know that. But we are not going to

that it is worth every franc... What I want
to tell you is this: of course I will ask you
more, and of course 1 want to know as much as
you know. If you refuse to answer, that's your
business.

I will tell what I am able to tell, What I
know, I will tell. Of course, you youself
understand that there are things concerning our
internal system that I cannot report to you.

past and his professional career. ‘In tiis statement he described
his education, his service in the GRU, his entry into the KGB

various components of the KGB Second Chief Directorate in which
he had served, along with the inclusive dates of his service

in each. This account was very similar to that given MARK
earlier in the day. Still without prompting, he discussed
several specific KGB operations against Americans inside the
Soviet Union, one involving the recruitment of a Yale University
professor on the basis of homosexual compromise and the other
an unsuccessful attempt to recruit an American code clerf.-
NOSENKO said he was personally involved in both cases.*

The question of his further assistance was then raised
again: The CIA officer asked NOSENKO to tell more about the
Yale professor, but NOSENKO demurred, stressing that the agree~
ment involved only two pieces 6f information and ignoring the
fact that he had already given considerably more:

fuse if we meet before my departure. If you
like, on Monday, on Tuesday, any day. Monday
is better for me. Not Sunday, because I have
to be there with my own [people].

This exchange was followed by a lengthy description of the two
leads which NOSENKO had come to sell, the BELITSKIY and the
"ANDREY" cases.

As NOSENKO was about to leave this first meeting, his case
officer asked when they might meet again. NOSENKO suggested
that they meet two days later, on Monday, around noontime as
it would be easier for him to get away unnoticed at lunchtime.
He then said that the case officer was probably trying to get
everything down on tape and asked that this be stopped because
of the risk to his secvrity resulting from such a permanent re-
cord of their conversations. NOSENKO said: "I will not tell
you. anything particularly interesting. But I can tell you some-
thing. But not today. I can tell how LANGELLE blew POPOV--not
LANGELLE, but because of whom and why we found him--for your
future use, so that you will know how to operate. But LANGELLE
was not guilty. It was not LANGELLE who was guilty. Another
person was responsible for the compromise. Next time."

‘by your people and it will be the end of me." Although he

sometimes voiced moral compunctions, from this point on NOSENKO

expressed his primary personal concern as being his own secu-

rity vis-a-vis the KGB. :

b. Attitude Toward Defection __

While willing to meet with CIA representatives during
future trips outside the Soviet Union, which ne estimated would
occur about once a year, NOSENKO in 1962 refused to consider
defection except in circumstances where his personal security
would be endangered. Wis devotion to his wife and children and
the probability that the KGS would take reprisals against them
if he fled were, he said, the primary considerations behind this
refusal. (Without elaborating or the reasuns, NOSENKO said on
another cccasion that he would not want to leave the USSR even
on a permanent KG3 assignment and accompanied by his family.)
Other considerations included his widowed mother's dependence
on him and his love of Russia and the Russian people, as opposed
to the regime. For these reasons, NOSENKO said, he could not
defect as PETROV, GOLITSYN, and KHOKLOV had done.

c. ‘Motivation

NOSENKO told David MARK on 9 June 1962 that he wanted to
contact American Intelligence becaisc he was in trouble over
the loss of KGB operational funds, for which he had to account
prior to his imminent departure for the Soviet Union. His KGB
career would be ruined if he was caught misusing this money,
NOSENKO added, and because he had nowhere else to turn, he was
willing to sell two items of information to MARK. The amount
needed to cover the loss was 900 Swiss francs, or about $210,
and this was the price asked for the information.

NOSENKO's statements of motivation to his CIA case officers
during subsequent meetings are given below:

9 June 1962: In his first meeting with a CIA officer NO-

SENKO asked whether MARK had relayed the reasons why he wanted
to meet with American Intelligence. He then very briefly re-

tional funds. The case officer remarked that there must be ‘
something more to it, upon which NOSENKO said that this was not,
in fact, his main motivation: “I have been working in this
business’ for a long time and I know what I am doing. I have
heard more than is written [in the newspapers]. A reorganization
has been started in the USSR. In short, they have begun to do
away with the ministries and the sovnarkhozy. But this is pre-
mature. Right now our agriculture is falling apart at the seams
and our industry is at the point of collapse because this re-
organization, this innovition, is too early. And this is not
just me, a young man, talking. I mingle with ministers, with my
father's friends, and I hear what they are saying. ;And how much
does a worker earn? © 600-800 rubles in old money, now 60-80.

Why have I told you this? Because under other circumstances
perhaps I would not have come to this. So this is the reason
for what has happened to me. This is perhaps the incident that
drove me into contact with you. It all somehow grew within me.
God knows."

11 June 1962: During the second meeting, NOSENKO himself
raised the Issue of motivation. His case officer had just said
that CIA would respect his wishes in connection with a particu-
lar request when iNOSENKO said: “Speaking of respect, how can
there be respect? I don't even respect myself for what I have
done. But, but, take the press bulletin, the communique of
the Summit Conference in Moscow on various questions. Again
lies, lies, lies, to show that we have had great successes. I
can't see them [the successes]. No, excuse me, I know somewhat
more than the rank and file Soviet man because I work under this i
system. I can see what is- being dcne and what is not being done.
Lies, more lies. This was my mood. I say, ‘How much is it pos-
sible to deceive the people, the Soviet peopie? How far can H
you go?" Our people ure very poor. It is somewhat difficult
to arouse a people such as this. If we stir ourselves up we
will know how to stand up for ourselves, But I feel for my
people. How often can you say that things will be goo’; how
often can you say that we have achieved big successes? Where
are they? Show me them. I can see no trace of them. This is
what I say...that there is resentment in my soul. Do you under=
stand? A terrible resentment. I love my country. You may say
that this is nothing. But I tell you that I cannot act like
GOLITSYN, like KHOKLOV, like PETROV, because I want to be there.
I want to be with my family. That's all. But I feel that not a
only the government is making mistakes. I feel that there are |
faults throughout the entire system of socialism. ‘hat I mean 4
is ‘that things are bad in Czechoslovakia, things are bad in Po-
land, things are bad with KADAR [in Hungary], they are starving
in China, This means that there are great mistekes. Well, 3
that's all. What did you want to ask me, please?” 4

At the close of this meeting, NOSENKO stressed that money
was unimportant as a motive for a continuing relationship: "My
name must not be used anywhere, even in your offices. Understand?
It would be the end of me. I am not afraid of this. The devil
with them. Because I have had such a life. I lost my father,
everything, Why do I say this? I did not come to you simply
because I needed money. I don't need it. I came because I am
resentful inside. Do you understand this internal resentment? i
I do not believe in what is being done. I donot believe:in . 3
this. Listen to me. Let me speak honestly. Have I not had the :

Never...As I said, perhaps the thing which drove me to you was not
money, but this great, great resentzent.”

14 June 1962: The subject of motivation was not discussed
éuring the third and fourth meetings with NOSENKO. As he was
about to leave the Geneva safehouse after the fifth and final
session, however, NOSENKO again touched on the economic inequi-
ties existing inside the Soviet Union and raised a new reason for
cooperating with CIA,.his basic sympathy for the American people.

_ NOSENKO said that he realized that the reason he had given for
coming to us, his need for money, was “not good,” Before he
and his case officers parted, KOSENKO said, he wanted to em-
phasize "without attempting to justify himself" that he had
"always felt a certain sympathy toward the American people.” He
explained that it was not the technical progress of the United
States which attracted him, nor was it the high standard of
living of the American people. It was rather the openness and
directness with which the Americans whom hz had met and seen
handled themselves. As examples he cited his American targets
in Moscow and Secretary of State Dean RUSK, whom he had seen in
Geneva.

Although NOSENKO did mention the difficult economic situa-
tion in the USSR on a few other occasions, he did not relate
these remarks specifically to his motives for volunteering to
CIA. The above excerpts are representative of his total state-
ment on motivation during the 1962 meetings.

3. Decision to Defect (January 1964)

On arrival for his first meeting with CIA during the second
Geneva phase, on 24 January 1964, NOSENKO said that after long
and careful consideration since the 1962 meeting series, he had
decided to defect. He once again criticized the Communist regime
along the same lines as during earlier meetings, but his immedi-
ate motivation seemed to have nothing to do with this NOSENKO
explained that he had recently been promoted to the position of
First Deputy Chief of the Seventh (Tourist) Department of the KGB
Second Chief Directorate, and that because of the stature and
responsibilities of his new job, there would oe ¢+w opportunities,
if any, for nim to visit the West in the future. Therefore, he
had decided to seize the opportunity at hand and to flee to the
United States at once, leaving his family behind. He foresaw no
possibility of his wife and children being permitted to leave the
USSR for the “next twenty years." NOSENKO told CIA that “the
hardest thing is to part with my family.” He had, however, care-
fully considered their fate as the close relatives of a defector,
ad he knew that, because of his mother's position in Soviet so-’ :
ciety, no harm would come to them.

Whereas. NOSENKO: declared his intent todefect immediately,
the CIA case officers at this first meeting in 1964 persuaded
him to remain in place for at least two or three weeks on the
grounds that, first, CIA would benefit much from this; and
second, arrangements for his transfer to arid reception in the
United States would have to be coordinated in advance with CIA
Headquarters.

During this first meeting NOSENKO made no monetary request
of CIA and asked only for reasonable assurance of a secure future tp Ee
in the United States. In this connection, he said, he would 7
prefer to act as a CIA consultant, particularly on counterintel-
_ligence matters because he was a specialist in this field; he a
would be able to give CIA leads and assistance in spotting and
recruiting other Soviets. 7

+

The next five meetings with NOSENKO were devoted exclusively
to debriefings on the activities of the K3a8 Second Chief Direc-
torate. Althorgh his impending defection was mentioned, his ;
reasons for taking this step were not discussed. In the mean-
time, NOSENKO's first CIA handler =lew to Washington for dis- 7
cussions regarding the defection and, on his retarn, told
NOSENKO that the CIA leadership had asked why, specifically,
NOSENKO had decided to come to the United States at that time.
The answer was that NOSFNKO, “after coming back and seeing that
there was no more chance to come to the West, or little more 2
chance," felt that this was his one opportunity to come and make
his life with the Americans. Therefore, he was going to seize
the opportunity while he had it, Asked about this, NGSENKO con-
firmed that this was his reason, and added: "I may never have
another chance, and in addition, I've had sufficient time since
our last meeting here in Geneva [1962] to weigh everything and to
consider everything." Later in this same meeting, NOSENKO again
mentioned his lack of interest in soney and his feelings about
deserting his family: "I understand [that it will be difficult
to adjust to a new life in America] and know that for some time ?
I will be sick within. And I know that a certain pericd of i
time must elapse before this can heal. I even spoke to you
bluntly about my [financial] security. I am absolutely un-
mercenary and have never had any appreciation for money or
wealth...My most difficult and sorest spot of all is my family.
This is the nost basic and most difficult spot of all. And I
know perfectly well that I must go through an illness over
this. For this the only and the best doctor is time. I don't
expect to have a new family there. Of course, I don't know--
but at least I'm speaking from the way I feel now. I have a
strong liking for children--nct only for my own, but for all
children and, losing my own, I am fully conscious how I must
suffer through this. In time I will get used to it. I know
one can get used to almost anything.”

At this meeting, NOSENKO agreed to remain in place for
approximately another week, and the tentative date of 8 Febru-
ary was selected for the defection.

1

y NOSENKO's motives for the defection were not. mentioned i

for five more meetings.’ Then, on 4 February 1964, he telephoned 4

the Geneva safehouse to say he wanted to defect at once. Ar- 4

4. The Letter of July 1964—

The most complete explanation given by NOSENKO of his
_ motives for first contacting CIA and«later defecting to the
} United States is contained.in a letter to his CIA case officer
: dn July 1964. He described this letter as “an exposition of
all those reasons and roct causes which led to the decision
to leave the Soviet Union” and further explained that “every-
thing put down here is lacking in a whole series of lesser
details which to a greater or lesser degree played their
role." Nevertheless, he said, he had tried in this letter
“to set down the main things to show how, when, and why the
decision was born, grew, and hardened within m2 to completely
alter the course of my life.” This letter is preserted below
in its entirety. Most of the biographical and operational j
details mentioned in the letter are covered separately in other 7 a
parts of this paper. Ei

very comfortable circumstances since the positicn of i

my father gave us the opportunity to live without lacking +

£0t anything. And the only difficult periods of my

life (before the death of my father) were: study in

the naval schools in Kuybyshev, Baku and Leningrad;

and the beginning of my working life, the period in

the Far East (1950-1952). The opportunity to be

always well-dressed, to have a sufficient amount :

of money, to have my own car, to be able to use the .

car given me by. my family and also my father's car,

the opportunity to travel to the South and to vaca-

tion in the best sanitariums, dachas, and so forth;

all this unquestionably left its mark on me and be-

came something of a habit. After the death of my

father, my successful progress in my work gave me a
; higher salary, and although I did not have all that
: which I had while my father was alive, still I did not : |

experience any serious difficulties. But already I

wanted to live still better.

"2, Up to 1953, over the course of my entire
life--at school, in the Institute, at work, at home
in the family--it was always pounded into my head
that STALIN was a great genius, that he was good, keen,
etc., and the thought never occurred to me to question
his words or his deeds because everything that he
said, and everything he did,were completely axiomatic.
i The arrestsand trials only involved traitors and it
i was considered and explained that the people who
suffered innocently, especially in 1937 and 1938,
suffered only because at the head of the NKVD in 1937,
1938, was the betrayor of the people YEZHOV. Not
even the shadow of doubt fell on the name of STALIN.
Soon after STALIN's death in 1953 I read a certain
: document given me by my father, This was a secret :
A to letter of the Central Committee of the CPSU on the +
4 :. "ease of the doctors;' it was not addressed to all .
. -* @Ommunists but only to members and candidate members
-- Of the Central Committee. I was deeply shaken by this
J letter which described in detail how these people,



_ important specialists in the field of medicine, were
brought to such a condition that they condemned then-
selves; that is, they confessed to things which had
never happened, to things which they had never done.
They were sixply forced to give the evidence which was
needad | by the ‘investigators, ~The secret letters—onm—

the cult of STALIN and mich that I heard in the KGB
about the reign of STALIN, all this left its mark and
forced me to think deeply about the real truth and to
look at everything more critically. Already I no
longer had th in all these ideas which for years
had been pressed into my head.

"3. The new leaders (KiiRUSHCHEV and Company)
used the same methods but already diluted with the
water of democracy, with playing up to the people
and attempts to convince them that a new era would
arise, a new and better life, and that now the Party
was always going to concern itself with the welfare
of the people. In fact, it was a struggle for power
and the use of all. means in this struggle,“even
microphones (they listened to the conversations of
BERIYA and his friends; later they listened to the
conversations of MOLOTOV, MALENKOV, KAGANOVICH, and
others). .KHRUSHCHEV's endless blabbing about suc-
cesses, when in fact they didn't exist, the figures
about how the USSR had. passed the USA in the produc-
tion of butter and milk, when in the stores they were
available only infrequently. The endless promises
of a better life when in fact nothing of the sort is
taking place. All this similarly forced me to re-
evaluate not only the events which were taking place
in the country, but already the entire ideology of
the Party, its external and internal course.

"4. The events in Novocherkassk where about 20,000
to 25,000 people rose up and the way in which this
popular indignation was suppressed by trocps with many
casualties. This also made a deep impression on me.
When I was resting in the summer of 1961 in Nikolayev,
from my relatives--my father's brothers--I understood
well the real relation of the workers both to the
leadership and to the Party as a whole. At the same
time 1 saw how the workers really lived, how they eat,
what they have and what they can buy with their wages.

"5. %I heard a great deal from my father about
the domestic policies of KHRUSHCHEV in regard to the

development and the course of construction in industry, °

about his complete illiteracy in engineering techno-
logy and industrial economics, about incorrect deci-
sions in regard to many industries, and this was not
only the opinion of my father, but also of other impor-
tant leaders in various fields of industry (MALYSHEV,
VANNIKOV, AKOPOV, and others). But-no one dared to
open his mouth and ‘when in December 1955 my father
tried, as an engineer, to prove that a certain deci-~
sion would be incorrect, he received such a rebuff.
from KHRUSKCHEV. that he was profoundly shaken and in
the opinion of my mother this brought him to his ill-
ness in.1956 and his death in August 1956.

Bungary showed with absolute clarity the bankruptcy
of communist ideology. What was especially important
for me was the fact that in these countries it was

a protest not of individuals or groups, but of the
entire people who could no longer endure a regime
imposed on them by force, Here it is necessary to
emphasize that the life of the people in these coun~
tries was much better than that of the people in the
USSR (1 saw for myself how people live in Czecho~
slovakia, in Germany, and beyond any doubt they live
better than the entire people of the Soviet Union).

"7, The split of the international communist
movement became for me a clear fact and confirmed
my opinion that the theory of communism is a theory
bailt on sand and that it is practiced according to
the needs of the leadership of the Party at a.given
stage of life and that in reality full material wel-
fare would never be enjoyed by the people but only
by the leadership and the Party and the government.

“g. Working in the KGB I came to understand
much ard became conscious of the contradiction between
the internal and external course of the USSR. Such
questions as disarmament, the ban on atomic weapons, the
position of the USSR in the United Nations--all these
are used only in the interest of propaganda and as
@ screen for carrying out of the policies needed by
the conmunist party. (I was myself present at the
negotiations in Geneva and saw the ‘politics’ of the
Soviet delegation.)

"9, My trips abroad opened my eyes wide to the
true reality. Witn my own eyes, I saw how people
live, how much they earn, how they can dress and live
on their wages, and I paid special attention to the
life of ordinary people and not to that of scientists,
engineers, etc. And all the propaganda about the
enormous armies of unemployed in the countries of the
West, about the ‘heavy exploitation’, and the ‘un-
believably difficult life' flew immediately out of
my head. And that which I met with in my work, the
sending of Soviet citizens abroad--who gets sent where
and how, etc.--this finally debunked this propaganda.
Many of my acquaintances--GUK, CHURANOV and others-~
think back with great pleasure about life abroad.

"10. I entered the KOHSOMOL completely without
thinking about it. The time came, the right age, and-
I became a Komsomolnik like all the others. It was

_ different in regards to the Party: I joined the Party
in 1956 after the death of STALIN and while I was

working in the KGB and already at that time there was
a lack of faith and indecisiveness in me. My father
continually inststed on this, saying that without the
Party I would never move ahead and would not have
success in life. But I myself understood and saw

* that I would not be able to work in the KGB unless I

es a-member of the Party...And_if.I worked somewhere '.
else, I would truly never move ahead in my career

unless I entered the Party. But from Che Very" bes” eo
ginning of my entry into the Party, I deeply hated

all the Party talmudism and dogmatis All the

Party meetings were literally a torture. Especially

when I became the deputy chief of the section, the

chief of the section, and the deputy chief of the

department, because then I had to speak at these

meetiags. Because this meant to lie, to twist my

goul, and to attempt to show myself as deeply dedi- 7
cated to the Party and its course.

"11. In 1960 my oldest girl's asthmatic attacks
became worse. The question of a change of climate
was raised. At that time the SCD neeGed to send an
officer to Ethiopia for two to three years to conduct
counterinteiligence work among the Soviet specialists
there. It cost mea great deal of effort to personally
talk GRIBANOV into letting me go, The Party and work i
references had been confirmed, all the questionnaries i
were already filled out, the photos had been submitted; : :
that is, all the formalities had been accomplished. i i
But at the very last moment the Central Personnel of i
the KGB began to protest against my gong with my a
family to Ethiopia. ‘he reason for this was that from
the house check made at my place of residence they
received information that I sometimes came home in
a drunken condition and on this ground had quarrels

ih my wife. A tour abroad with my family was neces~
gary because of the health of my daughter (since 1963
the illness has become better) and also it would
have been advantageous froin the financial point of
view. From this time on I understood that Personnel
Waid not let me go abroad with my family.

"12. Knowing many officers in the FCD, I began
to understand that being sent abroad is entirely
determined, not by knowledge, experience in work and
success, but only by the absolute 'cleanliness' of :
the person's autobiography and complete assurance as
to his limitless dedication to the Party and the |

“government. But not only being sent abroad but the
assignment of personnel in the First and Second Chief
Directorates and the entire KGB depends on the reasons
indicated by me and also on good reiations with the
Badership and good connections with workers in Central
Personnel.

d "13, I lived about 1] years with my wife and our i
i life was not a hell. It is true that there were

quarrels and basically they boiled down to the fact ~ +
that she took an extremely unfavorable attitude to-
wards my delays at work and also when I would be de-
layed with some of my friends and acquaintances after
work and would come home with a few drinks under my

t belt. Of course, I loved and love'my.children and only
the fact that they are taken care of financially until
they grow up and have received an education to some
extent consoled me in taking the decision to leave the
USSR. What do I have in mind when I speak of financial
security? After the death of my father, the family

suggested that we not do this before her death. And;
of course, my mother will not leave my children without
attention, and my share of the. property and the money
will be given to my children.:~ .

"14, I£ the defections of{PETROV, RASTVOROV and
DERYABIN passed without evoking. any particular
thoughts, the defection to the United States of GOLIt-
SYN, whom I had heard of as an intelligent person and
a capable officer, undoubtedly caused me to think
very deeply. Because to act thus, it is necessary
to have not only boldness and decisiveness, but also
great. strength of will. And already I put to myself
the question, will I be able to act thus in view of
the dissatisfactions and disillusionments which had
accumulated inside of me? i

"15, Being in Geneva in 1962, not long before !
my departure I myself of my own desire entered into }
contact with you, The reason for this was the loss :
of money received by me for operational expenses. I .!
would have been unable to accumulate such a sum of
money before my departure and there was nobody to H
borrow from (at this time GUK was’hinself in finan- t
cial difficulty and at the same time he was already i
preparing for his return home). To tell the truth
about the loss of the money would have meant that it i
would be necessary to explain whcre and in what cir- ;
cumstances it had been lost. This would have risked i
expulsion from the KGB and a serious reprimand from
the Party. Not to tell the truth, to think up some
sort’ of a story--they wouldn't believe, and worst of 1
all, they might think that I had appropriated the 2
money, that is, stolen it. And this would be for me ¥
the worst of all and I would, of course, in such BL
event have told the truth. 4

"16. To tell the truth, it was only after my
return home from Geneva in 1962 that I gradually, not
immediately, began fully to realize all the seriousness
of my contact with you and its full meaning. And tener
although I did not give you any promises cr assurances Ceituese H a
about our continued contact in the future, I under- d
stood that you sooner or later would set yourself the. | i
task of continuing our contact. And here it was that’
weighing up all the reasons and causes which I have
indicated above that in 1962 I took for myself the
decision to leave the USSR at the first opportunity
and that I started to work towards being sent on a trip
abroad.

"17. O£ course, I wanted to come abroad with some
sort of 'baggage', that is, with materials which could
be useful and necessary. for you. In this entire period
up to January 1964 I tried to collect information which
would be of the maximum value for you. My assignment

ment in-July 1962 gave me a greater. opportunity than

deals with trips abroad) because I was on good terms ‘
with PENCHENKO who covered Switzerland, besides which |
when I came back from Geneva in 1962 I had prought him
a number of presents.

PENKOVSKIY held himself at the trial; I liked his ap-

been said in the KGB about him andthe sort of person
they were trying to make him out to be (that he was
morally degraded, that he had descended and sunk into
a swamp) that all this was nonsense, bluff, and chatter.

1. Introduction

The extent to which NOSENKO made himself availeble for
meetings with CIA in Geneva in 1962 and 1964 is reviewed here
in connection with his etetements about the KGB duties assigned
to him for these trips, his visits to the XGB Legal Residency,
his personal association with other Soviets. Although
4KO was not precise about how he spent his days and nights
in Geneva, he did indicate that he was his own boss, disposed
of his time as he saw fit, and for the most part had little to
go. at the first meeting with CIA in 1962 he accounted for his
freedom of movement by saying: "I can come and go as Ipleass
at any time. (Ambass3aor) ZORIN knows wno I am, almost the
entire delegation knows who I am, because I don't need to pre~
tend. Nobody pays any attention to me. They know that I am
not 4 Ministry of Foreign Affa man (at the conference
sessions). I sit, listen, leaf through some papers. For this
reason I can leave the conference at any time, or I do not come

i

e will sav a word to me." |

In 1962 NOSENKO seid he was the sole KGB officer in the
94-man Soviet delegation to the Disarmament Conference and as
such he was responsible for the security and behavior of the
entire delegation.” To assist him in carrying out these security
officer functions, NCSENKO had the services of a number of
coopted informants of the KGB who were serving in the delega-
tion. In addition, NOSENKO had the specific mission of check~
ing on suspicions atteched to one of the delegation members,

P. F. SHAKHOV** but ry the time he established contact with CIA,
he said, this assignment had already been completed.

In 1964, NOSENKO said his only operational task then was to
hendle the General security responsibilities for the Soviet
delegation, 3s he had done in 1962. There was no specific
mission such as the one concerning SHAKHOV in 1962.

NOSENKO nas described his investigations of SHAKHOV, but
he has never indicated either that he conducted security checks
of other delegation members in 1962 and 1964, or that he re~
ceived any security-type information (except on SHAKHOV) from
the KGB cooptees who were supposed to be reporting to him.

3. Visits to the KG3 Leqal Residency

Virtually every day, NOSENKO told CIA in 1962, he went to
the KGB Legal Residency in Geneva, apd if he stayed away for
more than a day or two, the Legal Resident, S. I. GAVRICHEV.
vould invariably ask NOSENKO where he had been keeping himself.

sane) . GAVRICHEV, according to NOSENKO, treated him with deference,
bteaccss y ‘and “shortly after his afrival in” Geneva tr March 296 2;~NOSENKO-~w-remnnt recente
a gave a lecture cn counterintelligence to the assembled members ‘

of the Legal Residency. This lecture was given at GAVRICHEV's
request, althouch it was only after some hesitation on ‘the part
of. the Legal Resident that all of his subordinates wefe brought
together to hear NOSENKO. (In return for hélping the Legal
Residency to perform counter-surveillance on. several occasions,
NOSENKO said, he was sometimes allowed by GAVRICHEV to have the
use of an operetional car and driver to go shopping and carry
out other private errands.)

Similarly, in 1964, NOSENKO said he was making nearly daily
visits to the Legal Residency. During the 1964 meetings NOSENKO
stated that it was his close relationship with M.S, TSYMBAL*
which made it possible for him to have visited the Geneva Legal
Residency so frequently, both in 1962 and 1964. “According to
the strict rules," NOSENKO told CIA, “an officer in a status
such’ as mine should not even go to the Residency. In this case i
it is only because I.am deputy chief of a department and GAV-. 5
RICHEV knows my position perfectly well (it is not lower than |
his), and because I have such a sympathetic personal relation- +
ship with TSYMBAL." He then went on to say that TSYMBAL "sort
of escorted me to the Residency. They coulé have simply said:
‘You are here on a mission, we have our own mission, and we
have nothing in common.'" But, NOSENKO indicated, this was
not.the case, thanks to TSYMBAL's intervention.

4. Association with TSYMBAL

At the secord meeting with CIA in 1962 NOSENKO volunteered | :
information on TSYMBAL's KGB background and his current missions
in Geneva, then alluded to his having spoken with TSYMBAL in
Geneva but without placing any particular emphasis on this
relationship.

In 1964, however, NOSENKO claimed that their relationship
was close, explained that it was TSYMSAL (again in Geneva at
the same time) who gained NOSENKO's admission to the Legal
Residency, and said that he had twice gone to see TSYMBAL off
on train trips, once on 24 January when TSYMBAL went to Bern
and again on 26 January when TSYMBAL left Lausanne for Rome.
NOSENKO told CIA he had been dealing with TSYMBAL since 1960
or 1961. At that time "We were looking over some candidates
for recruitment and came across some whose background would
have made them suitable for the Special (Illegals) Director-

didn't.“ NOSENKO also said that TSYMBAL had asked him several
times to transfer to the First Chief Directorate and had
suggested that he might be assigned to the United States. In
fact, NOSENKS added, he had got into some difficlty with O. M.

: GRIBANOV, Chief of the Second Chief Directorate, cy! virtue of

7 TSYMBAL's efforts in 1962 to have NOSENKO transferred and his

leaving the impression with GRIBANOV that NOSENKD (who was still
in Geneva) had agreed to this action.

Questioned in April 1964 about his association with TSYMBAL,
NOSENKC stated that he met TSYMBAL for the first time several
days before their departure for Geneva. Besides saying again
that he saw TSYMBAL almost daily at the Legal Residency and
that TSYMBAL's assistance enabled him to enter the Legal Resi-
dency, NOSENXO reported that in 1962 he went out with TSYMBAL
several times a week to eat lunch or dinner; sometimes they were
joined by I. S. MAYOROV,* sometimes by A. K. KISLOV (see next #
section), and sometimes the two ate alone. During the 1966
interrogations, NOSENKO said that, while he had seen TSYMBAL
on a daily basis in 1562, he saw him only twice in 1964: once i
when TSYMPAL travelled to Geneva from Bern for ore or two days
and later when NOSENKO saw TSYMBAL ‘off for. Rome from Lausanne.

5. Association with Other Soviets

» NOSENKO said in 1962 that the other Soviets he saw most
often were A. K. KISLOV and Yu. I. GUK.** KISLOV, with NOSENKO
was one of the four members of the Soviet delegation staying
at the Hotel Ariane in Geneva, and was said to be head of the t
American Section of TASS and a genuine correspondent.*** During
the 1962 meetings with CIA, NOSENKO reported that KISLOV was. i
not a KGB ozficer and made no reference of his heving any }
affiliation with the KGB, NOSENKO did say, however, that he
had arranged for KISLOV's name to be given the KGB double
agent B. Ye. BELITSKIY**** to use as a notional source of
information on Soviet disarmament policy; BELITSKIY was to .

fete pass this information to his CIA contacts. NOSENKO made

i numerous references to drinking and carousing with KISLOV,
specifically with recard to a night in early June - when
NOSENKO was robbed of or squandered his operational funds,
which brought him to CIA - and on the night of 10 June 1962
when NOSENKC squandered 2000 Swiss francs (the money CIA had
given him) on wine and women.***** In giving NOSENKO the
money to defray these personal expenses, the CIA handlers
expressed to him their concern over the dangers to his security
arising from KISLOV's knowledge of this inexplicable source of |
income. NOSENKO replied that.there was ‘no need to be concerned i '
,since KISLOV was: "too drunk :to-know what is going on," and.in
any event he constituted no.threat. i :

ore so ¥ MAYOROV, according to NOSENKO, was visiting Geneva in st ten os Oat
+ order to have operational meetings with agents.

Both KISLOV and GUK are mentioned in the discussion of
the “ANDREY" case (see Part VI.D.3.b.). GUK was also a
friend of GOLITSYN, who reported extensively on GUK's
° “-eareer in the KG3 including his service in the United
States. i peeeecareseteiea

a KISLOV in Geneva two years before and that they had become
very friendly. For the first time, NCSENKO reported that
KISLOV had beer, a KGB operational contact while in the United
States, that he had been introduced to KISLOV by a KGB officer
in Moscow prior to his departure for Geneva in 1962 in order : i
to be able to exploit him during the Geneva Conference, and ‘
that after returning from Géneva. KISLOV had been recruited as
8 KGB agent on the basis of a favorable report NOSENKO had
prepared.

- Often during the 1962 meetings NOSENKO spoke of his “big, |
big friend” GUK, whom he described as the Deputy Legal Resident | .
in Geneva and the only “strong officer" in the %GB Legal Resi- |
dency. He implied that his friendship with GUK, a former member :

of the KGB Second Chief Directorate, was of longstanding. NOS-

ENKO related that he and GUK were together nearly every day in

Geneva. They often went out together to chat and have a few

drinks, and as a consequence, NOSENKO was able to elicit infor-

mation about some of GUK's operations there. In 1964 NOSENKO

told CIA he found it difficult to obtain information on the

activities of the Geneva Legal Residency because he no longer

had a good friend there like GUK, who had been reassigned to :

KGB Headquarters. when questioned later in 1964 about his

relationship with GUK, NOSENKO said he had come to know GUK

well only during his 1962 TOY in Geneva,

6. Availability for Meetings with CIA

In speaking to David MARK on 6 June 1962, NOSENKO expressed :

7 displeasure over MARK's insistence on deferring their luncheon
(at which NOSENKO sought contact with American Intelligence) { i
until three days later. When the first meeting with CIA did {esas ;

. take place on 9 June 1962, NOSENKO stayed. for three hours,

end it was at his suggestion that another meeting was scheduled |
for 11 June. This second meeting in 1962 lasted seven hours. |
NOSENKO remained in Geneva until 15 June, and in the interim i
he met CIA officers three more times for over seven hours !

ran

BE, Tining of Defection +

After telling CIA on 24 January 1964 cf his decision to
defect, NOSENKO at the same meeting concurred when CIA gave
operational and administrative reasons for hin to stay in

lowed, the date of the defection was moved up to 8 February
in accordance with NOSENKO's wishes and with his reports in-
dicating that less information of value would be forthcoming
than CIA had at first thought. On 4 February, however,

NOSENKO reported that he was being recalled to Moscow for a 4
conference ca tureign tourism in tne USSR, and he therefore . t 3
placed himself in CIA custody on that date.* Details on 3
the timing of NOSENKO's defection are given in the following :
paragraphs. i i

At the 24 January iaceting the CIA case officers agreed
in principle with NOSENKO's Jecisicn to defect.. NOSENKO
felt that it wculd be best for hia to disappear from Geneva
without a trace, leaving all his personal possessions be- t
hind; he assured that CIA could exfiltrate hin from Switzer-
land to the United States. lic wanted to carry out this
plan as soon as possible, but the Cid officers encouraged
him--and NOSENKO agreed--to remain in place for at least
three weeks more, The reasons given NUSENKO for this re-
quest were:

i
i
4

- The desire to get information on the local KGB
Legal Residency and the Soviet delegation to the Dis-
armament Conference while he still had access to this
information;

+ The value of having NOSENKO present when O
GRIBANOV made a visit to Geneva about 7 February a
visit known to CIA only through NOSENKO;**

+ The necessity of making arrangements, accept-
able to NOSENKO, for his defection and resettlement.

The events which followed NOSENKO's agreement to remain :
in place for a short time longer are chronicled below:
IT
* The report of NOSENKO's recall to Moscow for the con-

ference on tourism is discussed further in Part III.F.

*® GRIBANOV was in 1964 the Chief of the KGB Second Chief i:
Directorate and, according to NOSENKO and other sources, :
the sponsor cf NOSENKO's rapid rise in State Security. . -
Several G3@2piGRAEUE sources, have reported that GRIBANOV
was fired from the KGB as a result of NOSENKO's de-
fection (Part III.1.). NOSENKO's relationship with
GRIBANOV is discussed in Part V.H.



26 Jenuary 1964: In a three-and-a-half hour meeting,
NOSENKO emphasized that although he agreed that it was F cf
necessary and useful for him to remain in place until the
GRIBANOV visit to Geneva, he wanted to defect as soon as
possible thereafter, ‘

not. be coming to Geneva after all, for KGB Chairman
SEMICHASTNYY was apparently reluctant to permit him to
travel beyond Vienna. NOSENKO said that he would probably
have definite information on GRIBANOV's trip by the end
of the week,

30 January 1964: At the seventh meeting of the series,
NOSENKO Said that there now appeared to be littie likeiihood
that GRIBANOV would visit Geneva or Paris,* Therefore, he i
wanted to defect right away. As reasons he cited the t
emotional strain of any further delay and the fact.that he i
and his tase officers were wasting their time working if
against the local KGB Legal Residency, which had no worth-
while or promising targets. ile also felt that nothing of : t
value could be obtained from the Soviet delegation because i
“TSARAPKIN himself doesn't kaow what_he will say until he 3
is told by Moscow the day before," :

As the best t or i
the defection, he suggested Saturday merni Feb: Yo
because he probably would not be missed until the following
Monday, This date was tentatively scheduled, and NOSENKO
again repeated his desire simply to "disappear without a |
trace." He also asked about exfiltration plans, t

He repeated his willingness to remain
in place until the arrival of the CHEREPANOV Papers®, which
he was told were enroute from Washington. He explained that ' q
he had felt pressure at the previous meeting because of an P|
imminent move by the delegation from its. hotel to the Soviet 3
villa outside Geneva; at the villa his disappearance would d
be noticed more quickly. This move, he had now learned, had n pecrones J
been postponed pending the arrival of a housekeeping officer 4
from Moscow. E

© From:.2 to 10 February 1964 GRIBANOV was in Paris, where
he was seen on the street with a Soviet identified by
NOSENKO as a KGB counterintelligence officer. There is
no evidence. that he visited Switzerland.

: 1 February 1964: At NOSENKC's request, it was firmly
agreed that the i

Teiection would take place in the morning

tration would be by automobile to West Germany and thence
‘by plane to the United States.* His case officers .con-
firmed that this was correct.

had now decided that it wa me to call a conference to j H
discuss new “tactics and strategies" for handling the in- :

creased number of tourists expected. Since NUSENKO had been
placed in charge of the entire conference, he was directed
to leave at once to prepare a dasic report on the kGs handling
of tourists; the report wesid be read to the conference either
by himself or by soxeone from the leadership of the KGB or
the Second Chief Directorate, NOSENKO explained that he was
the only one who could Jo this jeb as Lt. Col, A.S. KOVALENKO,
the KGS Headquarters Department senior officer, was a rel-
atively new man in this line of operations, having been
there only four or five years, perhaps less, NOSENKO also
told CIA that “by great coincidence’ he had learned, just be-
fore the cable arrived, he was being moved to the Soviet
yilia on the morning of 5 February, lle had arranged for a
Soviet chauffeur to bring a car around at 6930 hours the
next morning for the move, His absence would be noted at
that time, and therefore "the sain thing is to cress the Swiss
border before morning." NOSENKO felt, however, that there t
would be considerable confusion among the Soviets in Geneva
for a time following his disappearance, and that there would |
be no real concern until the evening. To foster Soviet un- 7
certainty he had left his clothing ly around his hotel |

NOSENKO was driven to Frankfurt the night of 4 February
and remained in a safehouse there until 11 February, when press |
publicity about the defection and Soviet demands for an immedi- i net

Soviet official Reactions é 7 i

Later events showing soviet orricial reactions to NOSENKO's de-—
fection are presented below in chronological order:

& February: A Soviet spokesman in’ Geneva reported to
Swiss police that NOSENKO, an "expert" temporarily assigned to
Geneva, had been missing for four days.

9 February: Evening news broadcasts in Geneva carried ‘
reports attributed to both Soviet and Swiss sources that NOSENKO

had disappeared. >

10 February: Unidentified. Soviet sources were quoted in
the press as having said it was presumed that he had defected.

AU. S. Department of State press release was issued iden-
“tifying NOSENKO as a KGB officer and ‘acknowledging his request _
. for political asylum in the Unitéd Stetes. Hy

1) February: The Department of State was advised informally
by Ambassador DOBRYNIN in Washington that a Soviet note to be t
delivered later would ask how NOSENKO had left Switzerland,
request his release, and demand an immediate interview with him.

1? _February: 5S. K. TSARAPKIN, the head of the Soviet Dele-
gation to the Disarmament Conference, read a statement at a press
conference in which he strongly condemned the Swiss authorities
for permitting NOSENKO's "kidnapping" and for hindering efforts
to locate him. TSARAPKIN demanced that immediate steps be taken
to return NOSENKO to Soviet custody.

hi At simultaneous press conferences in Bern and Geneva, the

: Swiss rejected these accusations of non-cooperation and noted

! the Soviet delay in advising the police of NOSENKO's disappear-

i ‘ance and Soviet failure to cooperate with Swiss authorities in
locating NOSENKO.

The Soviet note predicted by DOBRYNIN was delivered to
;the State Department, and a noncommittal reply was given to

¥“Aoparentiy no effort was made to notify Moscow immediately.



Soviet queries concerning the requested Gnterview ‘and the pasate

means of NOSENKO’s departure from Switzerland.

The Swiss Embassy asked for a meeting with NOSENKO in
order to obtain assurance that the defection had been volun-
tary. Arrangements were made to have NCSENKO meet with Swiss
and Soviet representatives in Washington as soon as possible.

(NOSENKO arrived in Washington at 2130 hours this same
evening.)

13 February: NOSENKO said he had no objection to talking
to the Swiss, but he would see the Soviets only if necessary.

14 February: In Moscow, Ambassador KOHLER was summoned
to the office of Soviet Foreign Minister GROMYKO, who read
him a etatement deploring the "evasive" reply of the State

- Department to Soviet inquiries in Washington and terming the.
whole event of NOSENKO's disappearance a "gross provocation
by American Intelligance organs." GROMYKO repeated the demand
for NOSENKO's immediate release from American custody.

The Counselor of the Swiss Embassy, Jean-Louis NATURAL, :
interviewed NOSENKO at the Washington offices of the U.S. : H oe

The Soviet confrontation immediately afterwards was handled

member of the Soviet Delegation to the 1962 Disarmament. :
Conference in Geneva, where NOSENKO said he had first met. him.) H

of his own free will after careful consideration and that he !
had no desire to return to the Soviet Union. In response to |

KORNIENKO's questions, he specifically renounced his status and
rights as a Soviet citizen.

H. Reactions of NOSENKO's Family

Two women who said they were the mother and wife of NOSENKO
called at the American Embassy in Moscow on five occasions
between 24 February and 23 March 1964,* and NOSENKO, who on
the basis of physical descriptions confirmed their identities,
said he had no doubt that the KGB had directed them to do this
in order to pressure him to return, The women expressed dis-
belief that NOSENKO had voluntarily betrayed his family and his
country. They sought a personal mceting with him in the United
States or enywhere else, submitted letters for him, and returned
to the Iimbassy to ask whether he had replied; the younger Mrs.
NOSENKO expiained that she required some definite statement in
writing from her husband so that she could plan her own future
and that of the NOSENKO children.

NOSENKG proposed to respond to his family's letters by
writing two of his own, one which would be intended for KGB
consumption and the other for his wife alone. The first of
these would state NOSENKO's irrevocable decision to remain in
the United States and to sever all ties with his family and
homeland. The second letter would be read by Mrs. NOSEN.
the Embassy, left there, and not reported to the KGB; in
would express hope for 4 reunion, ask her to wait for:him, and
tell her to indicate her willingness to join him in the West
by writing either "yes" or "no" on the letter itself, Although
NOSNEKO prepared both letters, only the first was sent to his
wife; it was mailed from Washington to the NOSENKO home in
Moscow on 7 April 1964,

From March 1964 nothing was heard from NOSENKO's relatives
until mid-1966, when Yuriy Dmitriyevich KOROLEV,** a Soviet
journalist, visited Paris and spoke with representatives of the
French magazine Paris Match. KOROLEV indicatec that he would

Yuriy Vasilyevich KROTKOV in England in September 1963, his
wife appeared at the British Embassy to make inquiries about
him. KROTKOVY, an admitted agent of the KGB Second Chief
Directorate, is believed/ jto remain under
KGB control.

like to serve as a stringer for the French journal and proposed
that he begin with a story on the life of the family of a
“Soviet secret agent." As KOROLEV spoke only broken French
and Enclish, the magazine staff did not seriously pursue the
matter at that time.

On 10 October 1966, however, KOROLEV again appeared at the
Paris Match offices, this time with one Feliks ROSEITAL.who acted
as his interpreter. He displayed a photo spread showing NOSENKO's
wife and family going about their daily affairs in Moscow, and
he submitted a-one-page document in English which gave a short.
account of NOSENKO's background. The document said in part:
“NOSENKO's family consists of a wife, 35, two daughters, 10 and
12, a mother and a younger brother. The family is not prose-
cuted (sic) but feel very badly about the incident (the defec-
tion).- Very soon the wife will apply to the International
Lawyers Organization for a divorce and compensation. It is
possible that this case will be given much publicity. His wife

a defector from the Soviet Union, who is legally considered
to be an enemy of the state, is granted automatically upon
the wife's request. There is.no known precedent for either
Soviet-inspired publicity or divorce difficulties in any
Previous Soviet defection.

been approved by GRIBANOV.

a Western Ambassador in Moscow until as recently as the

2*#** In 1962 NOSENKO told CiA: "“GRIBANOV and I are very friendly
socially and we have often caroused together officially...
He is very friendly and we often go out drinking together."
Under interrogation in Aprii 1964 NOSENKO was asked speci-

_.fically whether he had ever gone out socially with GRIBANOV
after working hours. He replied that he had done so on one
occasion and that TARABRIN waS present at the time. In
February 1965 NOSENKO was asked the same question and this
time answered that he had seen GRIBANOV three times socially,
most recently in October or: November 1963; TARABRIN, he said,
was the only other person present on these three occasions;
all three outings began as drinking. parties in Moscow res-
taurants and the latter two ended at the homes girls
NOSENKO had been asked to procure. Although indicated
that TARABRIN was Chief of the British Department at the
time he was fired, NOSENKO said he had held this position
only until 1963, when he became Deputy Chief of the newly
established Service No. 2 (Counterintelligence) of the
First Chief Directorate. .

A. Introduction

The biography of NOSENKO is built largely upon his owauatate- |
ments to CIA, but certain portions of it have been substantiated :
(as well as contradicted) by other Soviet sources. Given first
below is the NOSENKO autobiography for the pericd preceeding his
entry into the #8, then follows a surmary of his statements
about his non-professional life since becoming a KGB officer, and

‘(finally there is presented a review of what other sources have
said on these subjects.. A separate section of this paper, Part V, a
discusses NOSENKO's career in the KGB. z.

Be NOSENKO's Pre-KGB Autobiography

Although several other sources have since NOSENKO's defec-
tion furnished fragmentary information concerning NOSENKO's early:
personal history, NOSENKO himself has, of course, been the prin-
cipal source on this topic. He volunteered information during
the 1962 meetings, during debriefings in early 1964, and under

i interrogation in April 1964, in 1965, and in 19456." These vari-
ous accounts are arranged in separate columns in the following
table, and. they are organized chronologically frcm NOSENKO'S
birth to his alleged entry into the KGS, The first column in :
the table cpntains statements which NOSENKO made during the June A 2
1962 meetings in Geneva; these were taken from the transcripts :
of the meetings and, for the most part, are in NOSENKO's own :
words, The column headed "1964," derived from the April 1964 4
interrogation, reflects a number of changes in his story before : 5
and during that interrogation. Most of the information given i

in the "1965" column was taken from discussions with NOSENKO,

mainly on his early years, by a CIA psychologist in May of that :
year; however, material from the February 1965 interrogation i
and from DERYABIN's interrogation in duly and August has also

been included when it was not covered in the psychologist's ques-

tioning: and when NOSENKO signed protocols certifying his state-

ments to be correct. The "April 1966" column is comprised of

remarks by NOSENKO in a signed autobicgraphy submitted to CIA

at that time. The final column presents the results of the

October 1966 interrogation as they pertain to NOSENKO's early

life. From column to column appear inconsistencies and contra- A
dictions with regard to dates and locations furnished by NOSENKO, :
although in 1964, again in 1965, and most recently in October

1966 NOSENKO has said that he was "now" telling the truth. The

table shows where he has admitted having previously lied about

certain events and where he seems to have forgotten his earlier

statements to CIA about the occurrence of cther events affecting 4
his life.

: This tabulation of NOSENKO's autobiography concludes in
Part V.A., in which are quoted the various dates and circum-
stances concerning his entry into the KGB which NOSENKO has
given in 1962, 1964, 1965, and 1966.

Cc. Personal Affairs Since Fntering the KGB

1, Family Life :

The Soviet internal passport which NOSENKO carried to
Geneva in 1964 confirms his claim that he married Lyudmila
ROZHEVNIKOVA on 27 June 1953.' (They married approximately
six months after he says he first met her at a sanatorium or. ©
"yest home" outside Moscow and about three months after he
says he joined the KG3.) Immediately after their marriage
the couple moved into the home of NOSENKO's new in-laws at
Ulitsa Serafimovich 2, Moscow, where they lived until obtain-
ing their own apartment on Narodnaya Ulitsa in January 1955.*
KOZHEVNIKOVA's father is Yulian Nikolayevich KOZHEVNIKOV, a
metallurgical engineer by training, who held the position of
First Deputy Chairman of the State Scientific Research Com~
mittee (GKKNIR) of the RSFSR at the time of NOSENKO's defec-

tion. ** .

NOSENKO said that he has two daughters by this second
marriage. According to his: passport, the eldest of these,
Oksana, was born on 21 August 1954’ and the other, Tamara, on
13 July 1958.*** NOS © in 1952 displaved to his CIA handlers
a photojraph of the two girls and their mother and made a par-
ticular point of noting the close physical resemblance between

id On 23 April 1964 NOSENKO was questione? on the various
apartments he occupied in Moscow. He seid that, from the
time of his marr:age to TELEGINA until his departure for
nis first GRU post in the Far East, he lived in an apart~
ment on Meshchanskaya Ulitsa. lle gave up this apartment,
he said, in 1950, when. his Navy orders came through.
Having made this statement, NCSENKO was then asked why
the 1951 Moscow telephone directory still listed him at
the Meshchanskaya Ulitsa address. He replied that he could
not explain but that he was considered to have vacated the
house in 1950. (He later said he moved to the Far East in
1951 - see Section IV.B.) NOSENKO then said that the
previous tenant at Narodnaya Ulitsa 13 had been one Nikita
ISHCHENKO. Although the pnone then in the apartment was
switched to NOSENKO’s name for billing purposes, NOSENKO
never bothered to have the change entered in the Moscow
phone book; he said that this would have required a visit
to a downtown office, the filling out of numerous forms,
etc.; besides he added, he did not use the telephone any~
way. Therefore, NOSENKO said, from 1955 until his defec-
tion in 1964, the telephone in his apartment was listed
under the name of ISHCHENKO. He has repeated this story
during subsequent questionings. The 1961 Moscow phone
directory carries no listing for NOSENKO; it does list

4 ISHCHENKO but gives his address as Krasnokholmskaya
Naberezhnaya, not Narodnaya Ulitsa.

we The GKKNIR of the RSFSR is now the GNTK. PENKOVSKIY worked
under cover in the GKKNIR of the USSR.

;-##* | NOSENKO has also given his second daughter's year of birth
> as 1957.° In 1962 he told CIA that the older daughter was
then studying in the first class at school; in 1965, how-
ever, he said-she began school in the. fall of 1962.

Oksana and himself. He said that he and his wife refer to her
as his "double" (kop:ya). His wife, in a letter after the
defection, referred to Oksana as NOSENKO's kopiya.

NOSENKO's father, the Shipbuilding Minister, died of
stomach cancer in August 1956, three years after NCSENKO says
he entered the KGB Second Chief Directorate. The period of
time surrounding his father's death was, according to NOSENKO,
a turning point in his personal and professional life. It was
then that he "found himself" after an irresponsible past.
@rinking and wenching, and indifference to his work.

2. Venereal Disbase

The incident which NOSENKO has most often cite@ as an

example of his irresponsibility 1n the period prior to 1956
involved his illegal use of KGB alias documents to cover treat-
ment for a case of goncrrhea he contracted in 1954, at the time

| his wife was pregnant with their first child. The CIA psycho-
logist who questioned NOSENKO in May 1966 submit ed the follow-
ing summary of NOSENKO's statements about this incident, which
are about as given earlier (during the April 1964 interroga-
tion):

"A girl friend he had known in Leningrad since 1945 cane
to visit relatives in Hoscow in 1954, \She.called him, and he
spent some time with her. She was not a prostitute, and he

had slept with ner before, so he thought nothing of it. Later
is he developed what he feared was a venereal disease. Since his
wife was pregnant, he was safe both from discovery and the
danger of infecting her. He searched frantically around Moscow i t
for a private doctor wno treated such diseases, tut could not i 4
find one. Some of his friends at the office suggested a central : 4
clinic that would require no documents. He went here but when j
\

confronted with a request for documents, had the choice of
showing his KGB certificate or using a false passport he had
for business, He tried to talk the doctor into letting him
go home to get his documents, but the doctor said he would have
on to be accompanied by a member of the militia; otherwise he
might mot come back, He was required to take treatment of a
communicable disease. He was forced to give the false document.
He..came back for treatment about three times and wes ordered
to report back in two weeks for a final check, They also
demanded the name of the girl, but he claimed he had only just H
met her and did not know who she was. He forgot to go back
and a nurse visited the safehouse about two times ard left i
a-note for him to report. However, he did not go to the safe- :
house so knew nothing of the note. In the false passport was
a listing of where the named person worked, 2 fictitious
i ..',.., factory. As the result of the clinic inquiries, the request
for information got into the hands of the section which made v
the documents. NOSENXO was called before the deputy chief of
the Directorate and severely criticized. He explained what
had happened and was given five days of house arrest. However,
the chief of his section had also gotten word of the infraction
and sentenced him to fifteen days of house arrest without even
talking to him. Ee told his wife he was going on a trip and Z
: moved into the administrative room near the office to serve eee
his term. In the meantime, the Secretary of the KGB Party H



gl.

‘

Committee called NOSENKO's father on the phone and told him

the whole story. NOSENKO's father never tola éither NOSENKO's
wife or mother of the incident, but did chide NOSENKO about

it. The incident was brought before the Komsomol and discussed.
A written reprimand for immoral conduct-unauthorized use of
official documents was placed in his record. This was also

a final warning meaning that any other infraction would result :
in expulsion. .He made the statement that he had been punished
for this incident many times. He could not immediately apply
for party membership; the incident was broucht up repeatedly

in Komsomol.meetings an@ even in party meetings (after he was
accepted) as a horrible example; and it kept him from being
promoted from Senior Lieutenant to Captain. (The Deputy-
Director who gave him five days was a member of the promotion
commission.)"

Although there have been slight changes and contradictions
in NOSENKO's numerous accounts of this story (the house arrest
was variously reported as 5, 10, and 15 de it remained
basically consistent until the October 1966 interrogations
when he said for the first time that he contracted gonorrhea
from the girl in Leningrad in 1945 rather than 1954. In 1954,
he said, he again was infected, this ‘time by a prostitute whom
he picked up in the vicinity of the Leninorad Railroad Station :
in Moscow. When the KGB required that he reveal the source, 3
NOSENKO said, he ascribed the latter case to the original girl
from Leningrad. During the October 1966 interrogations NOSENKO
also told CIA for the first time that he had had venereal
disease on two other occasions while studying at the Institute
of Internat{onal Affairs.

He later began to "feel more a part of the KGB," and as
a junior KGB case officer, he personally recruited Richard
BURGI in the first successful recruitment operation ‘carried
out by the newly-created Tourist Departmert of the Second Chief
Directorate.* “And in 1956," NOSENKO said in 1964, "before
my father's death, I was made a candidate for membership in
the Communist Party and, exactly 15 days later, was assigned
the rank of Senior Case Officer. I develo; a in my-
self, (a feeling) that Ican do thifgs. You know how itis.
When a person feels that he can, that he has some support,
Paid works much better. ‘le has more initiative and so
forth."

3, Affiliation with Communist Party Organs

NOSENKO said that his formal participation in Communist
Party activities began in late 1943 or early 1944 when he poeeretnee
joined the Komsonol at the Naval Preparatory School in Baku.
This step was a casual one, and he has said that he took it
without much thought, mainly because all his friends were

{
Hy
{

i See Part V.D.4.b. for a description of the BURGI recruit-
mént operation. Until 1966 NOSENKO claimed to CIA that
he had received an award for his participation in this
operation. In the October 1966 interrogations he retracted
this and said that he never received eny KGB award for the
BURGI or any other operation.

joining. When NOSENKO entered the KGB in the spring of 1953,
he transferred routinely to the Komsomol organization there
and became Secretary of the Komsomol Organization of the
Second Chief Directorate. This was a small organization
consisting, NOSENKO thousht, of about 17 KGB employees; he
remained its secretary until June or July 1954, when he got
into the trouble over illegal use of operational documents.
According to NOSENKO, “Inmediately after this incident the
Bureau of the Komsomol was gathered, and I was immediately
removed from the position of Secretary.“ A week later, a
“strict reprimand" was entered in NOSENKO's Komsomol records.

In October 1954, on the eve of his 27th birthday, NOSENKO
was forced out of the Komsomol for over-age.* At that time,
the "strict reprimand" he had received several months earlier
was remitted on NOSENKO's petition, and he was permitted to
leave the organization with a clean record. He was not per-
mitted to join the Communist Party immediately, however.
NOSENKO described the situation on 15 April 1964 as follows:
“Yow I had to prove myself. Not being a candidate for Party
membership, I asked them for assignments to show my eagerness,
to prove myself, I also asked the Party Organization of the
Second Chief Directorate for some ‘putlic service’ (obshchest-
venniy) assignments. I collected newspapers." For a year,
NOSENKO "made qood" by running errands and performing other
such tasks, until it was decided that he wes suitable for
Party membership. He applied in Jenuary 1956 and was accepted
as a candidate member of the Party in June the same year?
full membership was granted in 1957. For over a year, from
October 1954 until January 1956, NOSENKO said, he had the
distinction of being the only employee of the KGS who was
neither a Komsomol nor a Party member or applicant.

4. Statements to Others by NOSENKO

Before giving CIA the foregoing details, NOSENKO had
talked about himself to several non-Soviets, including persons
involved in cases which are reviewed in other portions of this
paper. NOSENKO informed the recruitment target Horst BRAUNS
that he had two daughters.** He advised Ivan Ivanovich PREIS-
FREUND, a Finnish citizen used in the recruitment approach to
a U.S. Army sergeant in Moscow, that he was married, his
father was dead but his mother was living, he had served in
the Navy, and he had two children. PREISFREUND met the
“little girls" and later reported to CIA that, although
NOSENKO was a "woman-chaser," he loved his daughters very
much.*** With one KGB agent in particular, Arsene FRIPPEL,
NOSENKO was especially forthcoming: he told FRIPPEL of his

®~ According to the Statutes (Ustav)of the Komsomol in effect

in 1954, the maximum age for a Komsomol member at that-time
was 25. On this basis, NOSENKO should have been excluded
in October 1953, upon reaching his 26th birthday. When
this was explained to NOSENKO by DERYABIN in July 1965,

- NOSENKO replied that he was certain he left the Komsomol

in 1954 upon reaching the age of 27, that he was sure the
maximum age was 26 at that time, and that no special
exceptions were made in his case.

service in the Soviet Navy; he dwelt at length on his father's
work in the Soviet shipbuilding industry: and while using the
alias "NIKOLAYEV" with FRIPPEL, he mentioned that his father
had been employed in the town of Nikolayev. On one occasion
NOSENKO and his wife dined at FRIPPEL‘s home.* NOSENKO told
his recruitment target George DREW in April 1959 that he had
two daughters.

p- Soviets’ Statements About NOSENKO

Portions of the NOSENKO autobiography have been supported
and other portions contradicted by the statements of several
Soviets following the defection. The Soviets' remarks dealing
with NOSENKO's KGB career are reviewed in Part V.I., but with
reference to other aspects of. the background of NOSENKO:

= Letters to NOSENKO in Geneva from his wife (who
later went to the U.S. Embassy after his defection) in-
clude a reference to one of the daughters as his "double"
und two other personal letters in his. possession at the
time of his defection, Yu. I. GUK and'G. I. DUCHKOV,
referred to visits to NOSENKO's wife afd children.

- A KGB officer in Vienna, Vladimir TULAYEV, told
that NOSENKO, whom he knew well, came

“from a wonderful family, loved his wife and children
and earned a good salary. . TULAYEV later told
that he had "friends who knew NOSENKO well."*

said [feast Sieisthne Mose nad KO had twice merried, hed

a go ‘ound, was the son of a Minister in
the government, was notorious for his “adventurous”
nature, and was "famous for his character."

1944 to 1946. (ARTAMONOV's description of the school

- NOSENKO is the son of a former
