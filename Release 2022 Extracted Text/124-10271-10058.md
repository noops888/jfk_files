F:) CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY (CIA) [DOMESTIC CONTACT

SERICE. You previously have been informed regarding CIA's Contact JFK

Division which has had offices in various U. S. cities and which is openly

identified as being connected with CIA. This division has been responsible

• for the overt collection of positive intelligence gained through interviews of

aliens. travelers, büsinessmen, etc. The division has not been engaged

in any operational activity such as the development of double agents. For

your iniormation, ClA has reorganized this division and it is now called

the Comestic Contact Service.

JFK (1) (B) -

, An examination of CIA s activities in the area of overt collection

of positive intelligence has indicated that the Bureau can strengthen its

position by having our field offices establish direct contact with the local

oifices of the Domestic Contact Service. This particularly applies to those

(TB)

situations where the Bureau and CIA both have an interest in Soviet-bloc

and Yugoslav nationals, excluding those who are connected with embassies

or the United Nations. We recognize that CIA has a responsibility for

collection of positive intelligence (i. e. information regarding Soviet-bloc

capaoility in a particular research field) which might be acquired from

such risitors hnt we rannot condone any CIA actirity which might

interfere with Bureau operations. - You therefore are authorized to

establish liaison with local offices of the Domestic Contact Service.

Serrice the nature and extent of CIA interest and all pertinent information

which CIA has gained or may acquire in the future relating to our internal

security responsibilities. If you feel that CIA activity conflicts with

Bureau objectives, you should so advise the Seatof Government, clearly

UBJECT: RELATIONS WITH CIA

Reference is made to my letter of 3/2/70. I made the

statement,

"Unfortunately, CIA also believes that in the past

we did not always act in a forthright manner, and the Agency

undoubtedly could present a list of grievances." It is my

understanding that you want such grievances identified.

There

1s enclosed herewith'a list of cases or situations which arose

over the years.

Based upon a review of files and my. personal recollectio=

this list would be representative of matters which CIA could use

for making charges such as: not being forthright, not playing

falrly and squarely, not cooperating, not being of assistance,

not recognizing the need for concrete FBI contributions to the

foreign intelligence effort.

What CIA may have compiled over the i

years is unknown.

What situations are known to CIA and have not

come to our attention cannot be answered at this time. I am

thinking of leaks including distorted information which may have

been passed to CIA from ex-Bureau employees and CIA informants®

and sources;

It should be clearly emphasized that there is no

indication whatsoever within CIA that the Agency has been seeking

any find of a showdowe or contentation tith the til. contrary,

to what some people may believe, the relationship between the

two agencies up to the recent crisis was never better despite

the problems which have arisen from time to time. I am confident

that a thorough and impartial examination will conclusively

In order that there may not'be any misunderstanding, 1t

Is important to emphasize that the Bureau can also produce an

extensive list of justified grievances.

We can also produce an'

excellent record of support which we have given CIA; presumably

CIA could do the same.

There are ingredients for continuing

conflict and there is also adequate machinery for maintaining

sound working relations and producing badly needed intolligence

I believe that it would be most helpful to you and

Interested Bureau officials when evaluating and passing judgment

on the attached material if we analyzed very briefly the role

of the Bureau liaison Agent. A liaison Agent can be a simple

mail courier.or

he can be the true Bureau Agent ready to confrost

any problem or issue with anotherzgency, very often working with

very limited information..It is expected that the Bureau Agent

carry out his instructions forcefully and efficiently. He must

be prepared to handle all types of personalities under various

conditions.

He must be alert for pitfalls and express hinself

in a nost judicious and prudent manner but always making certain

that the Bureau position is well fortified.

In evaluating the attached and my encounters with CIA,

It should be noted that protests from the Bureau always were

easy to handle because the Agent had J. Edgar Hoover behind him.

However, when an Agent struck atian official on one day and

solicited his cooperation the next day, it did require some

resourceful action. It is believed that other liaison Agents

regularly encounter similar situations. On numerous occasions

I have bittorly feuded vith. CIA officials and this has ircludes

rough language. I have walked out on CIA officials when I felt

they were unreasonable. They took the initiative by asking the

Agent to return•;

I did try to play fairly and squarely with all

of them and never hesitated to accept a confrontation; this includ

the Director of the Agency. When'I lectured to CIA personnel

over the years I always made a point to challenge them to present

any grievances or raise any subject matter relating to the

• Bureau. I never left a discussion with any CIA official without

being positive that our position was absolutely understood.

The approaches utilized by me might be open to criticism.

can only refer, to the records of the Bureau and CIA and I believe

the Bureau's position is most favorable.

I don't think CIA has

ever transmitted a letter.of protest to the Bureau during the .

eighteen years during which the Agent handled the assignment.

INVOLVING CONFLICTS WITH THE

• CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY (CIA)

(1) MOCASE. (THE BORIS MORROS CASE) •

This was a sensitive Soviet-espionage case

which originated in 1943 and terminated for the most

part in 1957..

The case had many wide foreiga ramifi-

cations and historically has been, and undoubtedly

w111 be, one of the most important. and involved cases

of Soviet operations in this country and abroad.

He

did not disseminate any injormation of significance

In this case until 1954. On various occasions when

the Liaison Agent has become involved in heated argu

ments with CIA officials, they have seen fit to raise

this case as an outstanding example of FBI failure to

cooperate with the Agency.

The position taken by CIA

was that it should have been advised regarding the

soviet operational activity in Ioreign countries,

claiming that the Agency mould have had the opportunity

to develop nore information of significance, identify

Soviet agents, and possibly prepare conditions for

recruitment or doubling of Soviet operatives. He did

not disseminate our reports to CIA because of the

!

extreme sensitivity of the case.

Ne actually did not

permit CIA to handle any investigations relating to

the MOCASE until 1957.

In 1957, CIA complained that it certainly had

every right to have received the information earlier

because many aspects of the MOCASE pertained to CIA

employees and operations. CIA further argued that it

had been greatly handicapped in effectively carrying out

the leads in 1957 because the leads were given to the

Agency at the same time that the case was publicized.

The Agency argued that the failure of the Bureau to

coordinate with CIA those French aspects of the case

permitted the French, rather than the U. s., to play &

doninating role in Europe.

"ith regard to dealing with the French, we

took the position that we would cover the leads through

our Legal. Attaches wherever possible and to furnish

leads to CIA in those countries where we did not have

Legal Attaches. CIA maintained that since we were on

record that our Legal Attaches do not handle operations

abroad, the Bureau had an obligation to levy those French

leads on CIA or at. least coordinate with the Agency

before going to the French.

It is to be noted that in any argument relating

to jurisdiction in this matter, CIA will fall back on the

responsibilities placed on the Agency under the provisions

of the National Security Act of 1947 and the implementation

of the foregoing through National Security Council Direc

tives. CIA will maintain that' it is incumbent upon the

Bureau to recognize the provisions of the National Security

Act of 1947 and the Directives. The Agency would argue

that in the BOCASE. these were

ignored by the Bureau.

felt that contact with Bureau officials had very

benefits and left lasting favorable impressions because of

the FBI's worldwide reputation.

CIA also pointed out that

when foreign visitors had no contact with Bureau officials,

they were left with the suspicion that there was some kind

of friction between the FBI and CIA. In 1956, we had a

clear-cut policy to the effect that tours for

such visi

tors would be of a restrictive nature in that such

visitors would view our facilities normally seen by the

public and nothing more. CIA was so laformed but

that our policy prevented the

Agency from truly enhancing U. S. interests abroad.

CIA never lodged an official complaint.

It should beemphasized that for the past several

years there would not be any basis for any forma complaint

In addition, we have learned more about these

this kind of treatment has also immeasurably helped

our Legal Attaches.

(7) CIA - DUTCH INTEREST IN SOVIET ESPIONAGE ACTIVITY

In 1965, the. Dutch Internal Security Service

was in the process of investigating individuals in

Holland who allegedly had been engaged in Soviet-espionage

activity. The Dutch wanted to have certain individuals

in the U.S. Interviewed and approached CIA to make

Inquiry at the Bureau.

At that tine, our relations

with the Dutch had been practically nonexistent because

(12) BUREAU OPERATIONS IN BRAZIL -

In YEAR the U. S. Ambassador in Brazil accused

our Legal Attache of engaging in uncoordinated covert

intelligence activity "of a nature which I believe

exceeds his terms of reference."

The Ambassador further

Indicated that. CIA was unhappy over the Legal Attache's

activities and the Agency allegedly had told the Ambassador

that the Legal Attache had disseminated information from

& source who mas a fabricator or a provocator.

This

situation arose as a result of the Legal Attaches

operation of an informant in Brazil. Some of the

Information that he received from the informant was

of a derogatory nature and related to a Brazilian who

was being touted as a Presidential, candidate. CIA

asked for the identity of the informant and we told

the Agency that the person could not be identified

because he did not wish that his identity be disclosed.

This case is being cited because.CIA may have evidence

that we had been operational in Brazil, had not coordi-

nated pursuant to Directives, and that the matter ras

further aggravated because of the alleged unreliability

of the information.

concerning CIA interest in this matter, if the informant

made the trip.

It was recommended and approved that we

not advise CIA concerning the identity of the informant

It is not known if CIA acquired any knowledge

but, if the Agency did, we potentially are vulnerable.

The Agency could charge that we were operating outside

(35) CIA LECTURERS AT BUREAU TRAINING SCHOOLS

CIA has never been able to understand why the

Bureau will not permit CIA personnel to lecture at Bureau

schools or training courses.

CIA has felt that through

a very valuable contribution both to the Bureau and to

CIA.

The Agency has indicated that its participation in

some of our courses mould give the Agency the opportunity

to describo cIA's erganization, objestires, and operational

problems. Furthernore, it has been expressed that Bureau

personnel could be given the opportunity to pose questions

and there would be a far better over-all orientation ou

The Liaison Agent has always resisted CIA's

request.

It has been a delicate matter to handle because

Bureau personnel have lectured to hundreds of CIA employees.

Although CIA has never officially made an issue

of the matter, the Agency has not been happy about our

attitude concerning exchange of information in the training

field.

When the natter has been broughtup for any discussion

•This 1s an area where discussion with CIA

officials can rapidly generate criticisn of the Bureau

for failure to cooperate and offer the necessary assis-

tance.

Positive intelligence, briefly, is that information

which might assist the U. S. Government in formulating

foreiga policy.. Much' of it is of a political nature and

& vital portion pertains to scientific developments, military

capabilities of foreign countries, and intentions of foreign

countries.

Positive intelligence

the nor-bloc nations.

There never has been, any'lay, Directive, or

Executive Order which has fixed the responsibilities for

the clandestine collection of positive intelligence in

the U.S. The Bureau does have a responsibility which

we refer

to as internal security and shich falls into the

accepted area of counterintelligence. He do investigate

subversives spys, and we develop penetrations of foreign

Intelligence services.

Our work in the positive intelli-

gence field, for the most part, has been restricted to

the compliance of requests imposed upon us by the state

Department, usually when a political crisis occurs in

some country.

• CIA has maintained that there is a tremendous

unexplored

field for expanded acquirement of positive

Interligence in the U.S. This would nean vastly increasec

technical surveillance coverage, development of informants,

and collection of cryptographic material. CIA does not

feel that we have aggressively moved on this particular

subject and that over the years, the agency has been

thwarted in its attempts to do much about the problem.

Honorable Richard Helms .

Director

Central Intelligence Agency

Hashington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Helms:*

As I am gure you will agree, the need for close

coordination of theKintelligence-gathering ansfounter.

Intelligence

efforts of the FBI and the Central Intelligence

Agency (CIA) is self-evident. This matter, is one which

requires a continuing analysis to assure that both agencies

have established working agreements whereby we can most

• effectively reálize positive results with a minimum of

duplication, misplaced effort, and jurisdictional problems.

During January, 1966, representatives of this

Bureau met with officials of the CIA to consider coordina-

•tion of our. mutual efforts in the collection of positive

intelligence in the United States. Ag a result of these

conferences, a set of ground rules was drawn.up and agreed

to by both agencies. A copy of this agreement was transmitted

in my letter of February 7, 1966, to then CIA Director

Vice Admiral William F. Reborn, JI. A copy of the agreeirent

is enclosed for your information. ' This agreement has proven

generally effective and no major problems have been

encountered since

Its adoption in the areas it covers.

•.. The FBI has primary responsibility with regard to

matters involving the internal security of the United States

as well as for conducting counterintelligance operations in

this country. While this Bureau does not have any statutory

responsibilities with regard to the collection of foreign

Intelligence, I have always recognized that the potential

for the development of such intelligence in this country 1s

congiderable.

The FBI has, in fact, made a concerted effort

to obtain positive intelligence of value to other U. S.

:: Intelligence agencies, including the CIA, and policy-making

officials of the Government. While these efforts have,

of course, been incidental to our main internal security

and counterintelligence responsibilities, we have on a

selective basis developed sources, both live and technical,

providing coverage at key foreign establishments in the

United States. The product of this coverage has been furnished

on a regular basis to the CIA and other interested agencies

and officials uf the Guverimeni.

I know that you will share my bellef that this

matter requires a periodic reexamination to assure that the

national security interests continue,to be served in the

most effective and complete manner possible. After reviewing

this matter, including the attached 1966 agreement, I would

velcome any observations you may desire to make.

Sincerely yours,

*. Edgar Hoover
