t

Reference is made to my letter of 3/2/70, 1 made the
ee "Unfortunately. CIA also believes that in the past
_ We did not always act in a forthright manner, and the Agency
undoubtedly could present a list of grievances." It is my
understanding that you want such grievances identified. There
is enclosed herewith a list of ‘cases or, situations which arose
over the years. z

: Based upon a review of files‘and my. personal recollectiozr
this list would be representative of matters which CIA could use
for making charges such as: not being forthright, not playing
fairly and squarely, not cooperating, not being of assistance,
not recognizing the need for concrete FBI contributions to the
foreign intelligence effort, What CIA may have compiled over the '
years is unknown, What situations are krown to CIA and have not
come to our attention cannot be answered at this time. I am
thinking of leaks including distorted information which may have
been passed to CIA from ex-Bureau employees and CIA informants’
and sources,

It ‘should be clearly emphasized that there is no
indication whatsoever within CIA that the Agency has been seeking
any kind of a showdown or confrontation vith the FBI. Contrary |
to what some people may believe, the relationship between the
two agencies up to the recent crisis was never better despite
the problems which have arisen from time to time, I am confident
that a thorough and impartial examination will iain tats
- support the foregoing. : 7

In order that there may not’be any misunderstanding, it
is important to emphasize that the Bureau can also produce an
extensive list. of justified grievances. We can also produce an
excellent record of support which we have given CIA; presumably
CIA could do the same, There are ingredients for continuing +
conflict and there is also adequate machinery for maintaining
sound working relations and producing badly, needed intelligence
information,

7 RES RELATIONS 4 é CIA vaUi e
——

I believe that it would be most helpful to you and
interested Bureau officials when evaluating and passing judgment
on the attached material if we analyzed very briefly the role
of the Bureau liaison Agent. 4 liaison Agent can be a simple
mail courier.or he can be the true Bureau Agent ready to confront
any problem or issue with another ehcy, very often working with
very limited information, .It is expected that the Bureau Agent
carry out his instructions forcefully and efficiently, He must
be prepared to handle all types of personalities under various
conditions, He must be alert for pitfalls and express himself
in a most judicious and prudent manner but always making certain
that the Bureau position is well fortified.

In evaluating the attached and my encounters with CIA,
it should be noted that protests from the Bureau always were
easy to handle because the Agent had J. Edgar Hoover behind hin,
However, when an Agent struck at»an official on one day and
.Solicited his cooperation the next day, it did require some
resourceful action. It is believed that other liaison Agents
regularly encounter similar situations. On numerous occasions
i-have bitterly feuded with-CIA officials and this has -.iscluded
rough language, I have walked out on CIA officials when I felt
they were unreasonable.. They took the initiative by asking the
Agent to return,. I did try to play fairly and squarely with all
of them and never hesitated to accept a confrontation; this incluc:
the Director of the Agency, When'I lectured to CIA personnel
over the years I always made a point to challenge them to present
any grievances or raise any subject matter relating to the

‘Bureau. I never left a discussion with any CIA official without
“being positive that our position was ‘absolutely understood.
The approaches utilized by me might be open to criticism. I
can only refer, to the records of the Bureau and CIA and I believe
the Bureau's position is most favorable, I don't think CIA has
ever transmitted a letter of protest to the Bureau during the .
eighteen years during which the Agent handled the assignment,

(2) MOCASE. “(THE BORIS MORROS CASE) .

a This was a sensitive Soviet~espionage case
which originated in 1943 and terminated for the most
part in 1957,. The case had many wide foreign ramifi-
cations and historically has been, and undoubtedly
Will be, one of the most important.and involved cases
of Soviet operations in this country and abroad, We
did not disseminate any information of significance
in this case until 1954. On various occasions when
the Liaison Agent has become involved in heated argu=
ments with CIA officials, they havé seen fit to raise
this case as an outstanding example of FBI failure to

. Cooperate with the Agency, The position taken by CIA
Was that it should have been advised regarding the
Soviet operational activity in foreign countries,
claiming that the Agency would have had the opportunity
to develop more information of significance, identify
Soviet agents, and possibly prepare conditions for
recruitment or doubling of Soviet operatives. We did
hot disseminate our reports to CIA because of the
extreme sensitivity of the case, We actually did not j

. permit CIA to handle any investigations facie to ’
the HOCASE until 1957.

In 1957, CIA i that it certainly had
every right to have received ‘the information earlier
because many aspects of the MOCASE pertained to CIA
employees and operations, CIA further argued that it
had been greatly handicapped in effectively carrying out
the leads in 1957 because the leads were given to the
Agency at the same time that the case was publicized.
The Agency argued that the failure of the Bureau to
coordinate with CIA:-those French aspects of the case
permitted the French, rather than the Ue 5., to play a
dominating role in Europe.

Xt is. to be noted that in any argument relating
to jurisdiction in this matter, CIA-will fall back on the
responsibilities placed on the Agency under the provisions
of the National Security Act of 1947 and the implementation
of the foregoing through National Security Council Direc-
tives, CIA will maintain that’ it is-<incumbent upon the
Bureau to recognize the provisions of the National Security
Act of 1947 and the Directives. The Agency would argue
that in the HOCASE, these were ignored by the Bureau.

(3) THE ABEL CASE

a .
\

Although CIA has. not raised the point for a:
several years, the prevailing attitude was, and probably
still exists, that the FBI did not play it square with

_ [OIA in the Abel case py not making certain that the
|Ageney was given the proper recognition for its contri-
butions, CIA feels ‘that in the first place,’ there would
not have been any U. S, access or availability to the
source in this case, NAME + . because CIA took
the full responsibility for’ moving NAME from PLACE
to the U. S, in 1957, CIA claims it took the risk and
responsibility of doing this after the Bureau declined
to become involved in any operation designed to transport
"NA ME ‘to the.U. S, It should be noted that NAME
Was an alcoholic and that his first contacts with CIA

in /LAce raised questions concerning Na ME _ nental eee
stability. t

After NAME: arrived in the U. S., we
arranged access to him for a period, the purpose of
which was to obtain a complete story of his intelli-
gence activities in the-U. S. and we were particularly

ljanterested in identifying all of his associates, es=
‘YWpecially the man who later was identified as Rudolph

J bel, After a short handling period in the U. S.,-we
dropped NAME because he became a problem. It was

‘1 extremely critical*situation because we had’ not yet |

identified Abel. CIA agreed to take the responsibility
for the at had and safeguarding of NAME but we



yaished to us by MAHE,

‘oe

lol.
were ‘given free. access this ‘difficult source, ' This
was a most fortunate arrangement-as far as ‘CIA was con-
cerned, because this adjustment gave us the time to work
with NAME ‘and subsequently develop the leads which
led’ to the apprehension of Abel, The Agency has main-
‘tained that it was largely responsible for making
absolutely certain that MAME was mentally and
physically prepared for testinony at .the Abel trial.
AME -was a.key witness. CIA has- also referred to

he heavy expenses incurred by the Agency, all for the
benefit of the Bureau, © CIA has complained that the -
Bureau never really thanked the Agency for its coopera-
tion and CIA has been particularly irked becaused the
Bureau did not see fit to inform the. Attorney General

jor the White House of the role played a CIA.

officials visiting the U. S. under CIA sponsorship were
given excellent treatment on the tour but, nevertheless,
many. of the visiters left most disappointed because they
had not had any contact with any Bureau officials, CIA
felt that contact with Bureau officials had very significant
benefits and left lasting favorable impressions because of
the FBI}s world-wide reputation. CIA also pointed out that
hen foreign visitors had no contact with Bureau officials,
they were left with the suspicion that there was some kind
of friction between the FBI and CIA. In 1956, we had a
clear-cut policy to the effect that tours for such visi-
[tors would be of a restrictive nature in that such
Visitors would view our facilities normally seen by the

In 1965, the. Dutch Internal Security Service .
was in the process of investigating individuals in
Holland who allegedly had been engaged in Soviet-espionage
activity. The Dutch wanted to have certain individuals
in the U. S, interviewed and approached CIA to make
inquiry at the Bureau, At that time,-our relations

INTERNAL SECURITY LEADS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES

" puring the 1950's, we gave our Legal Attaches
numerous leads stemming from internal security cases in
the U. S.. In many instances we did not see fit to
notify CIA although the Agency always maintained that
you could not separate "internal Security" from “counter-
intelligence,"-namely a lead in France pertaining to a
communist in the U. S. warranted advising CIA, if not,
at least asking the Agericy to handlé the. tead. In the
last several years, it is not believed that there is
any basis for complaint since we have regularly been
notifying CIA concerning subjects of cases who travel
abroad, If the Legal Attache is investigating, CIA is
notified in order to avoid duplicate efforts, There
have been exceptions where we have taken the position
that CIA should not be notified betause of the sensitivity
of the matter, How many such exceptfons are known to
CIA cannot be established from our files; however, we
should bear in mind that when aur Legal Attaches inves-. .
tigate, they contact many of the same foreign officials-
normally contacted by CIA. How many of these foreign
officials are CIA informants,or on the Agency payroll,

is unknown,

BUREAU OPERATIONS IN CUBA “

: We operated informants in Cuba when we had a
Legal Attache's Office in Havana, Informants reported
on activities of communists and other subversives in
that country, During the period we operated these
informants, we did not coordinate our operations with
CIA, We did not advise: the Agency that we had such
sources. However, in 1960, after Castro’. came on the
scene, it became infeasible to handle certain informants
in a secure manner, Approval was granted to turn certain
informants over to CIA, What these informants may have
subsequently told CIA about past Bureau operations is
unknown. This item is being cited in the event CIA had
evidence to establish that we had been operational in
Cuba and had not coordinated with the Agency pursuant

In YEAR the U. S. Ambassador in Brazil accused
our Legal'Attache of engaging in uncoordinated covert
dintelligence activity “of a. nature which I believe

_ @xceedS his terms of reference." The Ambassador further

indicated that. CIA was unhappy over ‘the Legal Attache's
activities and the Agency allegedly -had ‘told the Ambassador
that the Lezal Attache had disseminated information from

® source who was a fabricator or a provocator., This
Situation arose as a result of the Legal Attaches
Operation of an informant in Brazil. Some of the |.
information that he received from the informant was

of a derogatory nature and related to a Brazilian who

was being touted as a Presidential-candidate, CIA

. asked for the identity of the informant and we told

the Agency that the person could not be identified
because he did not wish that his identity be disclosed.
This case is being cited because CIA may have evidence
that we had been operational in Brazil, had not coordi-~
nated pursuant to Directives, and that the matter. was
further aggravated because of the alleged unreliability
of the information.

(37) POSITIVE) INTSLLTGHNCE :

‘This is an area where discussion with CIA
officials’ can rapidly generate criticism of the Bureau
for failure to cooperate and offer the necessary assis-
tance. Positive. intelligence, briefly, is that information
which might assist the U. S. Government’ in formulating
foreign policy., Much of it is of'a ‘political nature and

- @ vital portion: pertains to scientific developments, military
capabilities of “foreign countries, and intentions of foreign
countries. Positive intelligence is rot only important
as it concerns the communist=bloc counteaee but also
the non-bloc nations.

There never has been, any ‘lav, Directive, or
Executive Order which has fixed the ¥esponsibilities for |
the clandestine collection of positive intelligence in
the U. S. The Bureau does have a responsibility which
we refer to as internal security and vhich falls into the
accepted area of counterintelligence. We do investigate
Subversive, spys, and we develop penetrations of foreign
intelligence services, Our work in the positive intelli-
. Bence field, for the most part, has been restricted to
rae the compliance of requests imposed upon us by the State .
on Department, usually when a Folitical erisis occurs ‘in
-  " gome country. . :
:CIA has maintained that there is a tremendous
unexplored field for expanded acquirenent of positive
intelligence in the U. S. This would mean vastly increased
technical surveillance coverage, development of informants,
and collection of cryptographic material. CIA does not
feel that we have aggressively moved on this particular
subject and that over the years, the Agency has been -
thwarted in its attempts to do much about the problem.

In’ PATE «|, CIA requested the Bureau to
install technical surveillances at the offices and temporary

MISCELLANEOUS ITEHS

The Liaison Agent: recalls fragments of. other
Situations or conflicts which occured over the years and
which resulted in the voicingof CIA displeasure or criticism.
The Agent cannot recall the.names of the cases which is
mecessary to acquire the required data, There was one
instance early in the 1950's which involved information ~
received from a source of unknown reliability charging
Allen Dulles with having been a communist and a spy while
in Europe... We disseminated the information to several
agencies. Dulles exploded but never lodged a protest.

» The Agent also has recollection of instances when
GIA alleged that its source or informant, was compromised by
Bureau revelation of CIA information during the. course of
interviews conducted by us. Technically, this would be a
violation of the third agency rule and, if CIA had hard
core facts, we would be vulnerable, particularly if an
important informant was lost. CIA never made any official
dssue or protest. ceca

Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Helms:’

As I am gure you will agree, the need foe close
coordination of the «ntelligence-gathering anc,;counter-
Tntelifgence efforts of the FBI and the_ Centre élligence
Agency (CIA) is self-evident. This matter. is one which
"requires a continuing analysis to assure that both agencies
have established working agreements whereby we can most
‘effectively realize positive results with a minimum of
duplication, misplaced effort, and jurisdictional problems.

During January, 1966, representatives of this

Bureau met with officials of ‘the CIA to consider coorgina-:

** tion of our, mutual efforts in the collection of positive
intelligence in the United States. As a result of thése

‘ eonferences, a set of ground rules was drawn up and agreed
to by both agencies. A copy of this agreement was transmitted
_in ny letter of February 7, 1966, to then CIA Director :
Vice Admiral William F. Raborn, Je. A copy of the agreenent
is enclosed for your information. ‘This agreement has proven
generally effective and no major problems have ‘been

. JYneountered since its adoption in the areas it covers.

this country. "While’ this Bureau does not have any statutory
responsibilities with regard to the collection of foreign .
dntelligence, I have always recognized that the potential
for the development of such intelligence in this country is
considerable. The FBI has, in fact, made a concerted effort
to obtain positive intelligence of value to other U. S.

sdintelligence agencies, intluding the CIA, and policy-making

officials of the Government. While these efforts have,

of course, been incidental to our main internal security
and counterintelligence responsibilities, we have on a
selective ‘basis developed sources, both live and technical,
providing coverage at key foreign establishments in the

United States. The product of this coverage has been furnished

I know thet you will share my belief that this
matter requires a periodic reexamination to assure that the
national security interests continue-to be served in the |
most effective and complete manner possible. After reviewing

. this matter, including the attached 1966 agreement, Iwould

welcome any observations you may desixe to make.
