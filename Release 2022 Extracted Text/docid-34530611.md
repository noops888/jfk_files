(LC8424), FRG, with other members of their unit, 1LT Wood and an unidentified
Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO), when they were approached by the Disc Jockey
of the bar, who introduced himself only as John, and asked them if there was
a particular song they would like to hear, After playing the record requested,
John walked back over to Sources and sat down with them. John began asking
them military related questions almost as soon as he sat down. John asked
them what unit they weve from. He wanted to know where they came from
and where they were going. He asked them why they were in Datteln, John
stated that he knew who the Security Sergeant at C Team, 66th USA Artillery
Detachment, Datteln, APO New York 09078, was. When John did not receive the
answers to his Questions he stated that he knew what they were doing in
Datteln. John stated that Datteln was a dead town, but that things were
hoping in Westkirchen (C3549), FRG. The site that the convoy had just come
from. John then listed every site the convoy had just come from. John
identified the sites by unit designation, location, APO number, and telephone
number of the orderly room, John was completely accurate in every detail.
John stated that he mew what they had brought to Datteln and knew how long
they were going to stay. John talked about how easy it was to get information
out of people by using indirect questions. John said that about four years
ago he had a Lieutenant that was supplying him information about the site
at Datteln. John then boasted that he could find out anything he wanted to
by giving ten beers to almost any German soldier at the site. John stated
that he did not have any bugs so Sources and their friends did not have to
worry about what they said. John was very interested in the jeeps in the
parking lot near the Lord Nelson. John said that the jeeps had poor radios
and that he had a transmitter/receiver about one foot long, three to four
inches wide, end about six inches high, with a three foot antenna that could
reach Brazil. When asked where such a radio could be purchased, John said
that it was a special model and could not be bought anywhere. John mentioned
how easy it would be to puta fake bomb into the jeeps and asked Sources if
they checked the jeeps before starting them or just got in and started then.

John wanted to know on what frequency the radios operated, John stated that
he hated to be a Dise Jockey, that he had more important things to do.

John also stated that they had some mighty fine missiles in Soest (MC3813),
FRG. John stated that the Russian Army was far superior to anything in
Europe. He talked at length about the Russian Army. Sources felt that

John was serious about what he was saying and not trying just to make then
uneasy, John asked Margulies if he was a CID agent. Margulies replied that
he wes not. John talked about and named every intelligence agency of the
United States. He mentioned MI, OSS, ONI, CIA, CID and the FBI. John said
that Israel's intelligence network was far superior to that of any countries!
in Europe or that of the United States. John spoke fluent German and English
and spdke Spanish and Hussian to Sources to prove that he knew how. John
said he learned to speak English in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republic
(USSR), and said "we have to learn many languages." John kept asking about
Ramstein Air Force Base and stated that he had been to the NCO Club at
Ramstein. John said he hated the FRG and thet he wanted to go back to

the German Democratic Republic (GDR). John stated that he goes to the GDR
often and that he has been’ to Moscow (NCA), USSR. John expounded on how
much better it was to live in the GDR. John claimed to have a cousin or
nephew, Sources could not recall which, who was a Major in the army in the
GDR. John talked about brainwashing at length and how information could

be gotten from people without the threat of physical-violence. John seid that
the American Prisoners of War in North Viet Nam would never be the same

even after they were released. John stated that his hobby was just listening
and looking around. Sources said that they had to go because tommorrow

was a busy day and they had field exercises at 0900 hours. John quipped in
"Don't you mean that you and the convoy are leaving at 0600 hours?!, and
added that tommorrow whould be a busy day from him also. John mentioned that |
he had stolen something and had sold it. John described the object in great :
detail, as.to size, dimensions, and color, but never said what it was.
Sources could only recall that it wes about one and a half feet long with
fins on the end. Sources thought from the description that John gave, that
he was talking about a mortar projectile or some kind of small rocket.
When Sources left the bar at 0430 hours, they waited for John outside the
bar, but he did not come out. They then proceeded through the parking lot
where their jeeps were parked to their hotel across from the Lord Nelson.
At 0515 houps, Margulies looked out of his hotel window and saw John leave
the Lord Nelson. John proceeded directly to the jeeps in the parking lot
