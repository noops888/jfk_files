FBI Relationships with the Senate and House Select Committees

Senate Select Committee ©

FBI relationships with the Senate Select Committee generally
have been harmonious with responses to the Committee requests ©
delivered promptly. When difficulties have occurred they
have been overcome by negotiation and tolerance on both sides.
Future difficulties that may be confronted and require similar
resolution include the scope of any public hearing regarding
electronic surveillance of foreign nationals or-their agents
and establishments.

House Select Committee °°. ooo

In the past ‘che FBI has experienced, the following difficulties
with the House Select Committee:
“(1) It has hela public hearings which were orchestrated -
to present adverse views without an opportunity for
prepared rebuttal, such as occurred on October 9, 1975,
regarding electronic surveillance matters; 7

{2) It has demanded delivery of documents’ on unreas+
onably short notice considering the time necessary to’
locate and prepare for deliverythe enormous quantity
of documents called for;

(3) It has interviewed employees, former employees
and confidential sources of the FBI without: first
advising the FBI of the proposed interview and has
demanded .the appearance of agents below che’ _policy-
making level.

A large number of documents dealing with electronic surveillance
conducted without a warrant between 1970 and July 30, 1975, were”
fot 7 furnished to the Committee on Friday, October 10, 1975. Certain

: excisions in these documents were made and it remains to be .seen
whether the Committee will accept the determinations made as to
what types of information, é.g., identities of subjects who were
monitored, should’ fee been excised.

The overriding concern for the future is the néed to’ establish:
an understanding on both sides of the policies to be followed by
each in responding to the Committee's mandate. - General agreement .
to specified operating procedures would alleviate the suspicion
on the part.of the Committee and the fear of Committee seesponsi-
bility on the part of the FBI. 7 iyve i

During the discussion on 10/20/75 concerning the
forthcoming testimony of Assistant Director W. Raymond Wannall,
Mr. Wannall mentioned to the Senate Select Committee Staff Members
present (John T. El1Lif£, Domestic Task Force Director, Michael
Epstein, and Mark Gitenstein) that in view of the fact these
hearings would be open to the public the Committee would not be
fully briefed concerning the background involved in the Bureau
mail opening programs because of the sensitivity involved.
Elliff indicated that he was in agreement and that he would
contact F. A. O. Schwartz, Chief Counsel of the Committee, to
see if executive session testimony could be arranged. El1if£
subsequently telephonically contacted SA Paul V. Daly of this
Division and advised him that Mr. Wannall could testify in
executive session on mail openings in the late afternoon on
10/21/75 at approximately 4:30 p.m. subject to the’ approval
of the Senators.

After consultation with Assistant Director Wannall, 4)
El1liff was advised that this would be acceptable and that :
Mr. Wannall would appear for executive session testimony con~- —
cerning mail openi pgs iff the Senators agree to accept executive——"
session testimony.

Michael E. Shaheen, Jr., Special Counsel for Intelligence
Coordination in the Department, was advised of the possible ex-
ecutive session testimony and interposed no objection to the
Bureau giving such testimony.

HERELN TS UNCLASSIFIED 7
Bare § P-/¥-00 5% 5.2 AMI ASG

The following issues are among those which are raised by
the FBI mail opening programs and the FBI's cooperation in CIA's
New York intercept project:

Issues

(1) Whether mail opening as an investigative technique
should ever, under carefully circumscribed regulations
and with proper authorization, be sanctioned in the
counter-espionage field. The FBI mail opening programs
Yaise this issue with more force than the CIA programs
since, in general, the FBI programs were more circum-
scribed, more tightly controlled, and more focused
than the CIA programs. The FBI programs were also very
successful in achieving their counter~-espionage goals.
Mail opening does represent an extremely valuable

of intercepting the communications link in espionage
communications. On the other hand, the sanctity of the
mails is an established tradition in the United States,
and it is doubtful that any selection criteria could be
sufficiently precise to allow for the opening of only
mail to or from illegal agents.

(2) Whether the mail openings that did occur were properly

- authorized. It is clear that FBI Director Hoover
personally approved the majority of the mail opening
programs. The one which was implemented without Head-
quarters approval was terminated shortly after it came
to the attention of Headquarters. It does not appear,

. however, that any Attorney General ever authorized these
programs or that’ the exact nature and full scope of the
programs was even brought to the attention of any Attorney
General, even though opportunities existed to do so.
Similarly, despite frequent contacts with the ‘Postal
Inspection Service regarding the implementation of these
programs, no Chief Postal Inspector was ever informed
that the FBI contemplated the actual opening of mail.

(3) Whether the legal implications of the mail openings were
adequately considered. There is no evidence that legal
considerations were discussed after 1951, and there is
evidence that Headquarters personnel who ran the programs
either considered them illegal or ignored the legal
implications entirely.

(4) Whether the mail opening programs were adequately con-
trolled to ensure that they remained focused on counter~
espionage matters. As noted above, the programs did
generate some information regarding domestic organizations
and criminal activity,.although the primary purpose
always remained in the co gkexr-espionage field. The fact

Poomad -
RA ce ft
t
| NW 65360 Docld:32989673 Page 29



nee eo. .

-~§-

that these programs did generate such information
apparently came as a surprise to the Headquarters
officials who ran the programs and the obvious
questions are whether this was permitted or encouraged,
and, if neither, how it could have happened.

(5) Whether the selection of names for inclusion on the CIA's
Watch List in the Hunter Project was sufficiently con-
trolled and limited. Because the FBI requested the CIA
for information on categories such as peace organizations
and on specific individuals and groups involved in the
peace and women's movement, a serious question is raised
whether there was sufficient restraint on the use of this
source.

NOTE: As discussed in the FBI MAIL OPENING PROGRAMS

summary, several of the FBI mail opening programs utilized, as

+ selection criteria, various "indicators" which, with some accuracy,
identified letters sent by or addressed to foreign illegal agents.
The fact of these indicators has been made public by FBI officials
in recent weeks. But: these indicators are still felt to be
valid and the FBI-has no reason -to believe that they are not still
being used. It is recommended, therefore, that the Committee
avoid questions which would require in response an elaboration of
the nature of these indicators.

STAFF MEMORANDUM

EXECUTIVE SESSION ON FBI MAIL OPENING PROGRAMS

FBI Assistant Director W. Raymond Wannall and William
Branigan, Chief of the Soviet Section of the FBI Counterintelligence
Branch, have requested an opportunity to appear before the Select
Committee in executive session to discuss classified aspects of
the FBI mail opening programs. Both of them will be witnesses
at the public hearing on FBI mail openings on Friday.

The Committee staff has agreed that the public hearing
will not disclose the following. aspects of FBI mail openings:

1. The identity of the foreign nations involved,
including the Soviet Union, Communist China, Cuba,
Mexico, Hong Kong, Japan, most Western European
countries, and several Central and Latin American
countries.

2. The fact the mail to and from the Soviet Embassy
and the Soviet United Nations Mission, the Cuban
United Nations Mission, other Soviet-bloc Embassies
was selectively opened. ()

3. The “indicators" used as criteria for selective
opening of mail screened in several other programs
designed to detect illegal foreign intelligence
agents in the United States. (The fact that there
were "indicators," but not their nature, may be
disclosed publicly.)

4.: The identities of specific individuals and groups
whose mail was opened either by the FBI or by the
CIA at the request of the FBI. (FBI officials will
state publicly that some of these, especially in
the category "peace and protest groups," were not
adequately justified.) Some of these included:

Leonard Bernstein
Clergy and Laymen Concerned About vietnam
Jeremy Stone

Cambridge Center for Study of Public Policy

The following are questions which cannot be discussed in
public hearings because of this agreement. They should be
raised at this executive session:

1.

What was the actual intelligence value of FBI
mail openings aimed at mail to and from the
Goviet and Soviet-bloc embassies? ly’).

What was the actual intelligence value of FBI

mail opening programs using "indicators" and

designed to detect illegal foreign intelligence oe
agents in the United States? [(Soviet and cuban} ] Ox

What was the actual intelligence value of the
material supplied to the FBI by the CIA from
its mail opening operation?

How good are the "indicators" in selecting mail *
of foreign intelligence agents only and not
mail of American citizens or others who are not
foreign agents?

What standards were used for opening mail to and
from Communist China, and what was the intelligence
value of these programs?

Do FBI counterespionage officials desire to resume :
any mail opening programs, with proper authorization
fom Congress and the Attorney General?

How do the benefits of mail opening compare with
the benefits of warrantless electronic surveillance
currently used by the FBI for foreign intelligence
and counterintelligence purposes? ¥

"a constitution that will guarantee us the right to life, liberty,
and the pursuit ef happiness; a constitution that serves the
people instead of a constitution that serves the ruling class".

In early 1969, Junior negotiated to purchase a quantity of
weapons from an undercover United States Treasury Agent, for
the BPP and as a result was arrested on a Federal Firearms charge,
While out of jail on this charge, Junior learned that he had
been indicted and: decided to jump bond and leave the country.

Junior left the country for Canada, through the aid
of persons connected with the draft resistence movement, .
and who did not know of his pending criminal charges or his
affiliation with the BPP. He declined to identify these
persons who aided in his leaving the country or those who
aided him in Canada,

The BPP in no way aided him in leaving the country,
nor did they provide him any financial assistance while he
was a fugitive and for this he is bitter,

Junior decided to leave Canada and return to
Chicago for the purpose of surrendering to face trial

on the Federal Firearms Act charge, because of his
parents' poor health, :

Upon his return, Jearned the APP sade no loner
funectioniny on a demorratio basis but was nev bein dominated
by Bobby Rush, Tllinois Minister of Pefense. Jimior seurht
to bring the party back to its former state, by callin for
reforms and reorganization, which was resisted by Rush and he
was subsequently removed from the Central Staff and he
resigned from the party in Septembor, 1970,

he

: .
7 He is in no way involved with the BPP, or other

extremist activities, at this time nor does he have any plans
to resume his association with the BPP, as he feels "The BPP
and other organizations are boing duped by white intellectual
revolutionary hobbyists, who are taking advantage of the
hopelessness and frustrations of the Black community to
exercise their theories on political and social democracy."

Junior claims to have no knowledge of any BPP
underground, now or in the past; but admits that preliminary
discussion regarding an underground’ cell of the BPP was had in the
early development of the Illinois BPP, but that plan like most
others never got off the ground.

The BPP was, and is, a big disappointment to Junior
in that they departed from their original concept of neighborhood
protection against police brutality, to one of international
identification with communism, He maintained his association
with the BPP in spite of this change in philosophy because .
of his respect and confidence in Fred Hampton, who
rationalized that in order to further the cause of neighborhood
control they’dneed the financing and good will of governments oppose
to people oppression, no matter where these people were,

Junior feels that the BPP is dead in Illinois and
blames its demise to its identification with communism and
coalitions with white revolutionary groups.

He has three things to show for his membership in the
BPP; (1) probation on the Federal Firearms charge, (2) three
years probation on State narcotics case (which he claims was a
frame by police, but. to which he entered a plea, "as part of a !
deal", at the urgency of his BPP attorney); and (3) an outstanding

indictment with tho State of Tllinois charming he and fourteen

others with kidnaping and related crimes, Junior advised that

‘ ‘this was another case of police*harassment of thé BPP, and another
e> ple of how the BPP has lost its attractiveness to people

| in Chicago. Of the sixteen people who were originally charged

{ in the kidnapping case, including the deceased Hampton, only

| two of those, Yvonne King, and Billy Brooks, continue as
members of the BPP. 7

ny Junior claims to have no contact with any members ,
or former members of the BPP, except when the persons charged
with the kidnaping report for trial every month. Junior 7
cites the numerous continuances of the kidnaping case as ’
an example of white hobbyists playing with young black poo
revolutionary hopefuls. To him the continuances represent oe .
a conspiracy on the part of the BPP attorneys and the States "
Attorney's Office, as gn alternate months they ask: that the
case be continued and neither ever objects. If he could afford
it he would not avail himself of.the BPP attorney's services.

Junior is required to report to his probation
officer twice per month and is not allowed to travel
outside the State of Illinois, without prior permission,

Logical sources, in positions to know, advise
that Junior is not now active with the BPP, and has
not been so in more than a year,
On October 29, 1971, the FBI recontacted Junior

and learned that his pending kidnaping case was
continued from October 26, 1971, until November 30, 1971. '

NATHANIEL WALTER JUNIOR

Nathaniel Walter Junior has been identified as a i
former member of the Black Panther Party (BPP), who during the
time he was a BPP member was indicted on state charges of
kidnaping and related crimes, with other BPP members, on
June 8, 1969, by the Illinois Cook County Grand Jury.°

The BPP is a black extremist organization
started in Oakland, California, in December, 1966.
It advocates the use of guns and guerrilla tactics

to bring about the overthrow. of the United States
Government.

The case against Junior, and the other BPP members indicte:.

with him, has never come to trial having been continued
numerous times.

On May 10, 1972, a Special Agent of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (EBI) observed Junior as he appeared
in State Court, and the case was continued until June 15, 1972.

Reliable confidential sources advise that Junior

is not a BPP member, nor does he associate with the membership '
of this organization.

This is to identify two serials, copies of which were
furnished to Barbara Banoff of the staff of the Senate Select Committee
{SSC) for retention in the Committee's files.

Banoff on 10/10/75 requested copies of a memorandum
from Mx. Baumgardner to Mr, Belmont dated 3/30/60 and a letter to
the New York Office and 15 other offices dated 3/31/60, both cap-
tioned "Communist Party, USA, Counterintelligence Program!" be
furnished to the Committee, Banoff stated she believed these documents
had previously been requested but she was unable to locate them in the
Committee files, She said she desired to have these documents
because they set forth a logical program by which the FBI made an
effort to prevent the Communist Party from infiltrating legitimate
imass organizations. As an aside, she stated she thoughtthe FBI was
successful in this effort, indicating she felt the technique was worthy
and proper.

Copies of the above two documents were made available
to a SSC representative on 10/22/75. Copies of the documents
together with a cover page indicating their receipt are attached, No
excisions were required in these documents,

This memorandum advises that the Senate Select

eight FBI documents (attached), The release of these
documents is scheduled for 10/24/75, following the appearance
of Assistant Directors Wannall and Mintz and Section Chief
Branigan before the SSC,

These documents were made available to the SSC
responsive to specific requests, They have been excised
and declassified where necessary, With regard to dissemi-
nation of FBI documents to the Select Committees of Congress,
both the White House and the Department have held that, god
once a document has been excised, declassified and furnished ta
to either Select Committee of Congress, it is that Committee's.”
property to do with whatever that Committee deems appropriate.’
However, we do have an understanding with the Committee tha
allows for more extensive excisions once the Committee decides
to make documents available to the press, Personnel in the
Senstudy Project have reviewed the attached eight documents
and have made additional excisions which are acceptable to
the SSC, These excisions are designed to protect Bureau
sources, targets and, where possible, the identity of Bureau

personnel, REC-114 b 2 I¢é 29 72 “DB

The contents of the documents that will be made
available generally portray the Bureau in a favorable light.
They highlight: (1) tight supervision and control of the
mail ifttercept programs; (2) general objectives of the program;
(3) accomplishments; and (4) Departmental official's knowledge
of the existence of some of these programs.

Of course, it would be desirable if no documents
were released by the SSC; however, Mr, E1Liff advises that
the senators are desirous of furnishing some documents to
the press. If, in fact, Bureau documents have to be released,
it appears that the ones the SSC plans to use are favorable
to the Bureau.

For the information of Bureau officials reviewing
the attached documents, no excisions have been made; however,
the brackets in red ink show what information will be
obliterated from the documents prior to their release to

The Attorney General called on
February 27, 1965, to advise he wanted to consult with the
Bureau on certain problems raised by the Long Committee, which
is exnloring the-use of mail covers, et cetera. - He noted there
waS a possible problem concerning Chief Inspector Montague's
testimony and whether it was necessary for Montague to change
his testinony. Also, he felt that Internal Revenue Service had
been uSing investigative techniques which they shouid not use
-and this could pose a problem. He said that the President had
asked him to coordinate with all executive agencies concerning
the problems raised by the Long Committee, - . f

told by Attorney Fensterwald that if any of the questions
{national security implications Montague should not answer
{Consequently, Montague was estopped from doing other than 3

“XX told Mr. Katzenbach that I certainly agree that this
matter should be controlled at the committee level but that
I felt pressure would have to be applied so that the personal
interest of Senator Long became involved rather than on any
ideological basis. Mr. Katzenbach said that he had alzeady
talked to Vice President Humphrey about Fensterwald, (who ney
considered a wild man,\ and that Humphrey had promised to talk
to Long concerning Fensterwald. Katzenbach said that in
addition to the Vice President he might have to resort to
pressure from the President himself, although he would prefer
to work it out without resorting to the President. He indicated
{there was no one on the committee itself who could be helpful

SUBJECT: Watch List Correspondence

1. As a part of the recent request by the Senate Select
Committee, we reviewed our files to see if there were any responses
to General Allen's letter of September 17, 1973 which requested re-
certification of "Watch Lists." At that time we did not find any
responses. We recently checked with the FBI and Secret Service and
discovered that there were in fact responses. The Secret Service,
by letter dated 21 September 1973, did in fact recertify a "Watch
List" containing U.S. names, however, NSA has not accepted the U.S.
names.

2. Inclosed are copies of the FBI and Secret Service letters.

Re: Senstudy

At the conclusion of the hearing, considerable
questions were asked concerning legislation or direction which
would be necessary from The Congress to permit the Bureau to
carry out mail opening programs which were productive in their
results and which would not at the same time invade the privacy
of innocent American citizens.

are to be required to obtain warrants prior to obiaining mail and if we
are to be successful, a lower standard of probable cause such as is
permissible in administrative searches such as those conducted by
Health Inspectors would be necessary. In answer to a specific question
I explained that the Supreme Court has ruled that mail is protected absolutely

by the 4th Amendment.

STAFF MEMORANDUM

EXECUTIVE SESSION ON FBI MAIL OPENING PROGRAMS

FBI Assistant Director W. Raymond Wannall and William
Branigan, Chief of the Soviet Section of the FBI Counterintelligence
Branch, have requested an opportunity to appear before the Select
Committee in executive session to discuss classified aspects of
the FBI mail opening programs. Both of them will be witnesses
at the public hearing on FBI mail openings on Friday.

The Committee staff has agreed that the public hearing
will not disclose the following aspects of FBI mail openings:

1. The identity of the foreign nations involved,
including the Soviet Union, Communist China, Cuba,
Mexico, Hong Kong, Japan, most Western European
countries, and several Central and Latin American
countries,

2. The fact the mail to and from the Soviet Embassy
and the Soviet United Nations Mission, the Cuban
United Nations Mission, other Soviet-bloc Embassies
was selectively opened. (5)

3. The “indicators" used as criteria for selective
* opening of mail screened in several other programs
designed to detect illegal foreign intelligence
agents in the United States. (The fact that there
were "indicators," but not their nature, may be
disclosed publicly.)

4.° The identities of specific individuals and groups
whose mail was opened either by the FBI or by the
CIA at the request of the FBI. (FBI officials will
state publicly that some of these, especially in
the category "peace and protest groups," were not
adequately justified.) Some of these included:

Leonard Bernstein

Clergy and Laymen Concerned About Vietnam
Jeremy Stone

Cambridge Center for Study of Public Policy

Inquiry at the banks in Tuscaloosa has failed to DfAeY
reveal any accounts in the name of the UKA or ROBERT M. on
SHELTON, except a small personal account of SHELTON at
. - the First National Bank of Tuscaloosa. Informants have

advised that SHELTON is paid probably $8,000 per year for
. his work as Imperial Wizard. This money is sent in monthly

and presumably put in some bank,

An examination of pertinent income tax returns
might furnish information concerning the financial standing
of SHELTON and UKA which could be used in this program.

At the request of the Internal Security Section,
My. William Parker, Internal Revenue Service (IRS), was
contacted on 6/23/67 to determine the status of the IRS
case on Robert Sheiton, imperial Wizard of the United Klans  °
of America. i j

v
Parker advised that IRS had initiated investiga- a +
tion of Shelton for possible tax evasion for the years 1963 ~“, wl
through 1965. This case is still under investigation but ot ‘

indications are that Shelton owes no income taxes for 1963
and 1965 and owes $100 in taxes for the year 1964, According
to Parker, it appears that the criminal tax investigation

of Shelton will be closed and the case will be referred

to the Audit Division of IRS for civil disposition,

April 17, 1967

Enclosed is our 1967 income tax return. Salary for
which there is no W-2 forms comes from several short or

Should the government run short of funds in the meantime

we suggest repeal of the oil depletion allowance or any
other of the tax breaks for the wealthy. -

Assistant Attorney General Burke Marshall of the Civil Rights 7
Division has asked that we give him a statement concerning the Communist

Party affiliation of Hunter Pitts O'Dell. We have called-to his attention /)
current reports which have been furnished to the Security Division, =

Mr. Walter Yeagley, concerning O'Dell's activities. y

Marshall was interested in O'Dell's association with Rev. Martin ..’ J

Luther King and he was given a copy of a report of Special Agent James F. My
O'Connell dated 12/20/62 at New York, which was classified "Confidential", be oe
which had been disseminated to Walter Yeagley of the Security Division. Al
This report reflected the current association of O'Dell and the organization iva

lof Rev. King, namely, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC),
: In addition to the above we also furnished him a copy of a memorandum
| from the Director to the Attorney General dated 12/6/62 and another dated 1/23/63,
{ pertaining to O'Dell.

Marshall stated that upon review of the above information which was
furnished to him, he would like to have a statement from the FBI concerning
the present Communist affiliation of O'Dell, particularly, whether O'Dell
actually is a member of the Communist Party at this time.

I advised Marshall that an appropriate memorandum would be
prepared and furnished to him concerning his request. There is attached
hereto a memorandum which has been prepared by the Security Division
indicating that we have developed evidence through our coverage of the
activities of the Communist Party, USA, which indicates that as of July, 1962,
, Party leaders considered O'Dell to be a member of the Party. It is being
}pointed out nae ai information is highly sensitive and confidential.

Memo tdéMr, Belmont from A. Rosen
Re: Hunter Pitts O'Dell

By way of background, Marshall indicated that the basis for his
request stems from the necessity of having to talk with Rev. Martin Luther
King with reference to O'Dell. He stated that an inquiry has been received
from King about O'Dell and apparently the Department wants tobe able to
adequately handle this inquiry.

ACTION:
Soe 7 :
If approved, attached memorandum to Burke Marshall will be

handed to him. It is brief and specifically points out the need to treat
this information as highly sensitive and confidenttal. 7

On December 6, 1962, you were furnished information
indicating that despite the Reverend Martin Luther King's
statement of Qetober 31, 1962, that Hunter Pitts O'Dell +
had resigned his position with the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference (SCLC), O'Dell had continued to
represent himself as being affiliated with the New York
Office of the SCLC and, during late November and early
Becember, 1962, was actively engaged in the work of
this organization. Reverend King's public statement
of tetobor 31, 1962, was occasioned by an editorial in

s ‘etober 25, 1962, edition of the "Augusta Chronicle,”
sta, Georgia, which identified O'Dell as a concealed
aember of the National Committee, Communist Party, USA,
who wag employed by the SCLC under the alias Jack H. O'Dell.

‘ I thought you would be interested in the fact
that on three occasions during early January, 1963, O'Dell
: registered at an apartment in Atlanta, Georgia, as J. He
O'Dell. On each occasion, O'Dell represented himself as _
: , being with the New York Office of the SCLC, When checking
' © out on January 7, 1963, G'iell requested that the bill be
| charged to the SCLC. An inquiry by the manager resulted in
‘~~! telephonic confirmation from the Atlanta Offlee of the SCLC
that thet organization would pay O'Dell's bill. Also, on
January 10, 1963, O'Dell, Reverend Martin Luther King and
‘ eight other officials of the SCLC traveled together via
Delta Aiclines eee tlanta to Savannah, Georgia.

Subsequently, various newspapers contained
accounts of a statement issued by the Reverend Martin Luther

Oeil had resigned from his position with the Southern .
Christian Leadership Conference. Reverend Martin Luther King
is queted in this statement as denying knowledge of the
communist affiliations of 0'Dei1 and further describing
allegations that O'Dell was the Seutheastern Birector of
his organization as false in that 0'Deil functioned “purely
as a technician with 90 per cent of his work taking place

oes that on instructions of the Attorney General he wanted to clear

to the Bureau, As a matter of fact, the Attorney General has approve:
‘the rough draft contingent upon our approval.

The proposed memorandum, a copy of which is attached,
‘relates to Hunter Pitts O'fell and Stanley Levison and action taken to- fe :
advise Dr. Martin. Luthed/King And his dfimtediate associates of thé 4. pe
communist activities on the part of O'Dell and Levison. Marshall-states” f
that some time ago it was not felt wise, in view of the position of the FBI CL
informant, for Marshall to say that he knew O*Dell to be under communisty. —~
control. Instead, he informed Dr. King and two of his immediate Jel ee ql
associates that O'Dell was believed by many people to have had communist oar

connections and his association with Dr. King's organization was not
in its: best interest.

u

Subsequently, on June 22, 1963, according to Marshall's a x / i
proposed memorandum, he brought this matter very explicitly to i
Dr. King's attention. Later that same date, both the Attorney General
and the President, separately, strongly urged Dr. King that there should
be no further connection between O'Dell and the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference (SCLC). Thereafter, the Attorney General and
Marshall received copies of a letter dated July 3, 1963, from Dr. King
to O'Dell. In this letter King makes reference to a resignation which
O'Dell submitted some months ago which was accepted because of the
SCLC's firm policy that no communist or communist sympathizer would
be on the staff. Dr. King's letter continues by noting _ investigation

connections-with the Communist Party by O'Dell.
~~! —_— tee .

ps —King further tells O'Dell that the situation is such that the
organization cannot even afford the risk of impressions about communist
inspiration and therefore O'Dell's temporary resignation is being made
permanent.

Mr. Marshall's proposed memorandum also advises that he
informed Dr. King on June 22, 1963, Stanley Levison was a secret
|member of the Communist Party. This action was taken on direction
of the Attorney General and the President. Marshall had previously
warned Dr. King about any association with Levison. This was the
on indication given him of firm information mete was under
communist control. G oer Fey ‘On

King

Subsequently, with the passage of time so that the risk to
the informant was not jeopardized, the Director in a personal
conversation with the Attorney General on June 17, 1963, agreed
Dr. Martin Luther King could be informed that he ‘should get rid of
Levison and O'Dell because they are members of the Communist Party.
It was on the basis of this advice from the Director that action was taken
by the Attorney General and the President.

ACTION TO BE TAKEN:

While Mr. Marshall's proposed memorandum does not spell
out the sequence of events here in detail, his summary is nevertheless
accurate and it is therefore believed we should inform Mr. Marshall
that he should feel free, of course, to submit the memorandum as he

SS drafted it. If approved, Mr. Marshall will be so advised telephonically.

New York, New York,

Dear Jack:

Several months ago you submitted your resignation pending an

investigation of your alleged affiliation with the Communist

" party, as was suggested by an article to this effect in the.

Birmingham and New Orleans newspapers. We accepted this «_~

temporary resignation because of SCLC's firm policy that no
Communist nor Communist sympathizer can be on our staff or

_ 4mour membership. We felt that it was imperative to conduct |

; an immediate investigation. As you know, we conducted what we -

felt to be a thorough inquiry into these charges and were unable
* to discover any present connections with the Communist party on °
your part,

* ‘Phe situation in our country is such, however, that any allusion

to the left brings forth an emotional response which would seem | °

to indicate that SCLC and the Southern Freedom Movement are

+> -Communist inspired. In these critical times we cannot afford to

_’ isk any such impressions. We, therefore, have decided in our
. Administrative Committee, that we should request you to od
+ your temporary resignation permanent.

We certainly appreciate the years of unselfish service which you 7
have put into our New York Office, and regret the necessity of

” your departure. Certainly, yours is a significant sacrifice come
mensurate with the sufferings in jail and through loss of jobs :
under racist intimidation. We all pray for the day wi hoes our
; heniaeee may be truly the land of the free. :


i, Mr. O'Dell

RACIAL SITUATION Mr. Baumgardneri

Wes

Marshall, of the Civil Rights Division, reference was made to our
earlier conversation concerning/Congressional requests which had been
received by the Director, relating to ged communist influence in
the“racial demonstrations. ‘the Department's original “position was"

' that there was no immediate urgency in recontacting Senator Monroney,
jin view of recent contacts had with him by Departmental representatives.
‘Today, I pointed out that these requests should not be allowed to
{remain unresolved too long.

Assistant AG iiarshall advised that he had drafted a proposed
letter to be used in replying to these Congressional requests, since |“
he had ascertained that a written reply is desired, particularly by ~

Senator Monroney. In his letter Harshall proposes to paraphrase the {
pf President's statement at his press conference on 7/17/63. Marshall's
fl letter will, of course, make no reference to the President's state-
;f{ment, but merely indicate that this is the conclusion, predicated
\ upon reports and other information supplied to the Department.

In those instances where the Department is dealing with a

Member of Congress believed to be trustworthy, Marshall plans to
deliver his letters personally and to explain that the classified
nature of the reports precludes the furnishing of specific informa-
tion in writing or in testimony. Marshall feels that he can talk
confidentially in this way to Senator Magnuson and thus forestall any

*;xvequests for further information. It was noted that, as a result of

if the Director's conversation with the Attorney General, Marshall had
spoken with Martin Luther King about the dangers of his associating

:} With Stanley Levison and accepting assistance from him. It was,

_, therefore, believed that since this may get back to Members of

ij Congress, Marshall should talk with the individual Senators, where
this can be done on a confidential basis. °

on 5/30/63 furnished information concéFying a conversation 0n that date

between Martin Luther King and Stanley-Levison, who has been a secret
Communist Party member and has conttibuted funds to the Communist

, Party ona regular basis. King stated that he had requested a conference
,with the President and the Attorney General because King thought that now
jwas a good time for such a conference. Levison agreed. Levison stated
that there has never been an Administration in this country that has been
as worried about the Negro problem as the present one. Levison continued
that this is brought about by the Administration's concern with the common
market problem in Europe. It was Levison's opinion that United States
prestige is very important at this time and the inability to control the
racial situation was making it more difficult. It was Levison's opinion,
that the needs of the President are so great | that he is all ready,

for a different policy if it can bring about the kind of controlled situation
that he feels he neéds,

King and Levison agreed that the situation has to be kept moving
so that the President will have to look for an alternative, The President can
then be presented with certain alternatives, This will benefit the President,
for then his problem, fear of violence, will be done away with. It was..:-

out, then the movement must be enlarged, ‘King stated that he would like
to put so much pressure on the President that he would have to sign an

Executive Order making segregation unconstitutional,

will set the pattern for a whole series of southern cities. That is, you come
in with a package, come up with demands, discuss them and come out with a

Assistant Attorney General Burke Marshall of the Civil Rights
Division called to state that he will have to talk with Rev. Martin Luther
Xing with reference to Jack Hunter O'Dell. :

“By way of background, he stated that an inquiry has been
received from King about O'Dell and apparently the Department wants
to be able to talk to King about O'Dell.

Before Marshall can do this he states he would like to have
whatever background information we have on O'Dell. In this regard,
it is noted that O'Dell is supposed to be a member of the Communist
Party and has in the past been associated with the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference. This is King's organization. We have in the
past furnished information to the Department concerning O'Dell and his
association with Rev. King.

Marshall should be furnished with memoranda which have | f
heretofore been given to the Security Division. It is understood that YY
a report of O'Dell's activities is also available and has been furnished /
to the Security Division but has not been given to the Civil Rights iw
Division. It would appear that Marshall is entitled to this information -
‘if he is to properly evaluate O'Dell's background.

Marshall has asked for a summary on O'Dell. If such is not
readily available, copies of material previously furnished to the Depart-
ment would seem to suffice. He stated he has been in touch with the
AR:mpd (8) Attorney General on this matter and is anxious to

have it handled as soon as possible.

These investigations must be both vigorous and incisive. -The
fundamental objective is to identify those who may be engaged or
responsible for acts of violence, and care must be taken to avoid
becoming involved in widespread, nebulous investigation which does
not go to the heart of the problem at hand. When a case is opened,
it should receive immediate continuous attention until the initial
allegation is resolved. The case should be promptly closed if it is
definitely determined that it does not fall within the criteria set
owt in item 3a above. :

Individual cases should be opened on officers, leaders, and aptive
workers in these organizations to,determine whether they have been
involved-in acts of violence or have a definite potential for future
acts of violence. Good judgment and discretion must be exercised in
the case of prominent individuals who may be dupes of such organiza~
tions and who may hold nominal office. Immediately advise the Bureau
when investigation of a prominent person is contemplated; and if
there is any question as to whether there is sufficient probable
cause to fully justify investigation, no investigation should be
conducted without Bureau approval.

investigative reports but should ve indexed from informant reports.

discreet.

and other individuals not connected with such ‘organizations conducted
solely for the purpose of determining the attitude of the individual
may be authorized by the SAC. To obtain authority from the SAC,
credit, arrest, informant, and indices checks should be made and a -

publications need not be furnished to the Bureau in form suitable
for dissemination, In such instances merely submit copies of
pertinent newspaper articles aid publications to the Bureau, Of
course, if such data is‘clearly of a nature as to require contacts
with appropriate sources, such as information of unusual local or
national importance, submit same expeditiously in form suitable for
dissemination, Concisely summarize the pertinent article and include
4 -' therein the results of contacts with appropriate sources, :

4, In many instances situations involving members of the Negro and
Caucasian races result in violations of criminal statutes over which
the Bureau has. investigative jurisdiction. While such matters are
to*be handled in accordance with instructions pertaining to the
substantive violation involved, the Bureau has the additional
responsibility of disseminating pertinent information concerning
any racial aspects of such situations to appropriate Government
officials and agencies that do not ordinarily receive reports in
criminal matters, Therefore, the submission of 3 report ccncerning
the criminal violation involved alone is insufi¢ieat. In general,
pertinent data concerning the racial situation involved must be
Submitted immediately to Bureau in form suitable for dissemination
in order that it may reach interested agencies as soon as possible.

UNITED STATESG, ERNMENT
Memorandum

TO : Mr. Tolson

irotter ..
‘Tele. Hoom

‘rom : A. H. Belmont

fect: THE LONG COMMITTEE

The Attorney General called on the morning of é
February 27, 1965, to advise he wanted to consult with the ~*
Bureau on certain problems raised by the Long Committee, which
is exploring the use of mail covers, et cetera, He noted there
was a possible problem concerning Chief Inspector Montague's
testimony and whether it was necessary for Montague to change
his testimony. Also, he felt that Internal Revenue Service had‘
been using investigative techniques which they should not use
“and this could pose a problem. He said that the President ha
asked him to coordinate with all executive agencies concerning |
the problems raised by the Long Committee.

Inspector Moore and I met with the “Attorney General in
{his office this afternoon, Mr. Courtney Evans was present. I
: told the Attorney General that ‘in Montague's testimony he was 4.
at told by Attorney Fensterwald that if any of the questions had fe
national security implications Montague should not answer thems
e Consequently, Montague was estopped from doing other than answer3
eee in the negative when asked questions touching on national
S security. With this interpretation, it was questionable whether
> an attempt should be made to change or explain Montague's
on testimony, particularly in view of the obvious lack of judgment
x 6n the part of Fensterwald and the desire of 7.ong for publicity.
may . I made it clear to the Attorney General that from our dealings
: witth Montague, he was a man of integrity andsacrificed his
personal desires for the welfare of the country and had cooperat
} fully with us. The Attorney General said he had no intention
of’changing one word of Montague's testimony, but he was
P considering advising Long and Fensterwald that there were
extreme delicate national security matters touching on the areas
being ccvered by the committee and there could be exceptions to
the answers given in the testimony when they touched on such
sensitive security matters. He said further that he contemplate:
seeing Senator Long and impressing on him that the committee
would not want to stumble by mistake into an area of extreme

a interest to ie nati 1 security as they aed did in a matter

Memorandum to Mx. Tolson
Re: -The Long Committee

Taticcting « CIA. ' (Apparently CIA got wind of some inquiries by

the committee relative to their secret operation and went to

the committee and warned them off.) Katzenbach contemplates
asking for a list of the witnesses who will appear before the
committee together with a brief summary of the expected testimony,
On the basis of this, he will be able to advise Senator Long

when he should steer clear of a sensitive area.

I told Mr. Katzenbach that I certainly agree that this
matter should be controlled at the committee level but that
I felt pressure would have to be applied so that the personal
interest of Senator Long became involved rather than on any
ideological basis. Mr. Katzenbach said that he had already
talked to Vice President Humphrey about Fensterwald, who he
conSidered a wild man, and that Humphrey had promised to talk
to Long concerning Fensterwald. Katzenbach said that in
addition to the Vice President he might have to resort to
pressure from the President himself, although he would prefer
to work it out without resorting to the President. He indicated
there was no one on the comhittee itself who could be helpful
and that he did not expect any help from Senator Eastland,

ue. Katzenbach said that He expected troublefrom the
possible activities of IRS and the military in the investigative
field; that if some of these matters are uncovered before the
committee they will tend to undermine the restricted and
tightly controlled operations of the Bureat:. I told him that
our operations are tightly controlled and particularly in the
ffssctte areas of concern, we restrict oursel¥es to important
Jfeisctte matters,

Mr. Katzenbach said he was going to see Senator Long:
on Monday and wanted to know if the Bureau would like someone
jto go along with him, I told him no,

ACTION:
Mr, Katzenbach said he would advise us of the results

of his conversation with Long. He also asked that I advise
the Director of our discyssion and I told him I would.

3) Leonard Bornstein

| a) documents - No Hunter Mali request was Located
for Dernstein. We was, however, included in a list of names
to be removed from the watch list which was prepared on
April 20, 1962 (Exhibit A-2).

bp} date - Dernstein was most likely placed on the
watch list in 1959, since he went to Russia during that year.
On Aprik 20, 1962, he was included on a list of names to he
renoved from the watch list.

ce) basis ~ Since no Hunter Nrit request was located,
there is no background information available concerning the
Zeonard Bernstein who was placed on the watch list. A review
of Bureau files for individuals named Leonard Bernstein does
indicato, however, that tho only Leonard Bernstein who
travelled to Russia ox had any Soviet contacts was
Leonard Bernstoin, born August 25, 1918 (the prominent
conductor and composer). The first item in the Bureau file
concerning Bernstein is dated March 2, 1949, A review of
documents in this file Irom the beginning of the Hunter
program in 1958 until April 20, 1062, the date on which his
nano was renoved from the watch List, failed to locate a
request that he be ineiuded in tho Hunter progyam. However,
information concerning him, coupiled in response to a request
from another government agency in December, 1958, did
indicate that Bernstein planned to visit Russia during
March, 1959 (xhibits C1 and 2).

4) National Mobilization Committee to End tho
War in Vietnam (NMC)

a) documents ~ The NHC was the subject of
Hunter Mail request number 193 (Exhibit D-1), The NUC
was mentioned in a memorandum dated August 28, 1969,
concerning data obtained from the Hunter Mail projeet
during the past year (Exhibit D-2),

b) date ~ This request was most Likely made
between January 16, 1969, and August 28, 1969, No
investigation was conducted concerning the NMC until
September, 1966 @xhibit D-3), The request, however, was
probably not made until after January 15, 1969, the dato
that a CIA representative suggested the Bureau use the
Hunter project for development of leads in the New Left
field (xhibit D-4), Request number 233 was mentioned in a
memorandum concerning results from the Hunter Mail program
which was dated August 28, 1969,

¢) basis - The first item in the Bureau file
concerning the NMC is a communication dated September 14,
1966, which indicates that a group known as the November 8th
Ad Hoc Committee had been formed at Cleveland, Ohio. By
communication dated September 20, 1966, FBI Neadquarters
instructed the New York and Cleveland Division: to keep
Abreast of the plans of this Committees te sponsor demonstrations
during Novenber,196G (Exhibit D~3), By communication dated
duly 28, 1967, FBI Headquarters instructed the New York Division
to prepare a report concerning the same organization which had
become {mown as the NHC (Uxhibit D~5). The name NMC was used
until approximately August, 1969, when an allegedly new
organization known as the New Mobilization Committee to End
the War in Vietnam was formed.

of the Communist Party. This source stated that other Communist
Party functionaries had also @scribed Leonard Bernstein as a
Communist, The sgurve advised that in 1945 Jack Stachel informed
him that Bernstein had agreed to submit to Coxssuniss discipline.

Dear Mr. Attorney General: e

The Select Committee is presently investigating the
activities of the Federal Bureau of Investigation carried
on as part of the COINTELPRO program. We appreciate the
cooperation of the FBI and the Justice Department in
making materials available to us in this area. However,
one problem remains to be resolved. The Committee believes
its staff must contact and interview certain persons who
received information from the FBI in the course of
COINTELPRO operations. The FBI has withheld the names of
such persons from the Committee's use on the grounds that
they were FBI “sources”.

The Committee wishes to stress that it is not inter-
ested in questioning these persons about any role as a
"source", but rather as a recipient of information from
the FBI. ‘Indeed, in many instances we would not have been
aware that the individual was a "source" had not the Far
excised the name from the materials delivered to us.
Nevertheless, to minimize any incidental deleterious effects
on legitimate FBI operations, the Committee has selected a
very limited number of persons whom we desire to contact
and interview. (See attached list and materials.)

As you will recall, we originally discussed this
matter with you some weeks age. Since then the Committee
has had an opportunity to consider the issue more fully in
the light of our experience with other investigations. For
example, our inquiry into the relationships between the
FBI and the Internal Revenue Service clearly showed the

need to use the names of IRS personnel who cooperated with
the FBI in certain COINTELPRO activities. Those names
were made available to us for our use.

As I am sure you can appreciate, what is at stake
here is the investigation of serious breaches of the
security and confidentiality of information obtained by
the FBI. Such information was apparently disclosed or
“leaked" for the purpose of disruption. The full extent:
of such disclosures in many of the cases, such as the
efforts to discredit Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., is still
unknown. Surely, it would be incongruous for an inquiry
into these matters to be impaired on the grounds of the
FBI's interest in preserving confidentiality.

The Committee has a clear mandate and a firm commit-
ment to investigate allegations that the FBI attempted to
harass and discredit individuals. The integrity of this ,
investigation depends upon our ability to conduct inter-
views without the appearance of outside interference.
Therefore, we hope you have no objection to our conducting
the interviews of the persons on the attached list, but if
you do, please contact me by ee October 21. _

A source advised qn May 8, 1968, that the premises
of the First Unitarian Church of Los Angeles, 2936 West @th Street,

and lecturers at the church frequently espouse Communist causes or
follow the Communist Party line. Communist front group literature
is distributed at the church. The church is used by some Communist
Party members for’ "mass concentration" work.

This same infiltration extends to adjuncts of the
church such as the Unitarian Public Forum and the Fellowship for
Social Justice, formerly known as the Unitarian-Universalist
Fellowship for Social Justice.

A source advised in July, 1968, that the Los Angeles
Student Non-Violent Coordindting Committee (LA-SNGC), headquartered
at 7406 South Western Avenue, Los Angeles, California, is not a
membership organization but a loose-knit agency composed of young
militant, black nationalists from South Los Angeles who have
eliminated all Caucasians from their ranks and have initiated a
program against the draft, the war in Vietnam and discrimination
and have proposed.a revolutionary pro izing armed force,
political and economic action to obtai: goals. LA-SNCC is
an arm of the National Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee
organization headquartered at Atlanta, Georgia, and with the naming
of LA-SNCC Director RONALD LEROY WILKINS as Deputy Director of SNCC
for the West Coast, the affinity between the National and Local
organization will be more harmonious.
