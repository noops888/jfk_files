GRAHAM, the resident at 1863 La Lema Avenue, Berkeley, has L

telephone TH 1-7598. It is noted that he is the only

RONALD GRAHAM listed in this directory..

Background Investigation concerning this individual

developed that he is RONALD LEWIS GRAHAM, a WVA, born 10/31/35,

at Taft, California.

a private residence.
