Concerning the attempt to identify RONALD GRAHAM,

who was called from the subject's telephone on 5/19/61 at

TH 1-7598, as set out for San Francisco in report of 10/5/61,

San Francisco letter to New York, dated 11/22/61, reflects

the May, 1961, Oakland telephone directory, which covers

the Berkeley, California, area, reflects that RONALD

GRAHAM, the resident at 1863 La Lema Avenue, Berkeley, has u

telephone TH 1-7598. It is noted that he is the only z

RONALD GRAHAM listed in this directory.

Background investigation concerning this individual
developed that he is RONALD LEWIS GRAHAM, a WMA, born 10/31/35,
at Taft, California, He is a graduate student at the University
; of California, Berkeley, working toward his M.A, and Ph.D, in
Mathematics, Indices of the San Francisco Division were ie
negative concerning him,

It is believed that when GEBSON made the. call on
5/19/61, to RONALD GRAHAM, he was attempting to call RONALD
—~ARTHUR GRAHAM, who is the subject -of SF_100-47554, and not
the above RONALD LEWIS GRAHAM. . @ 4 5
Gb grwid.
On 6/26/61, RONALD anteuayeRauam waz identified by”
PSI EUGENE OAKLEY as the person who was at the 6/3/61 meeting
in San Francisco, of the Bay Area Fair Play for Cuba Committee,
eee which GIBSON addressed, and a later reception for GIBSON at
; a private residence. The informant advised that GIPSON resided
in Oakland with GRAHAM on the night of 6/3/61, although GRAHAM;.
did not appear to be well acquainted with GIBSON or the other “
at these functions.
