MEMORANDUM ‘FOR: Chief, WH-4

‘ _sTHROUGH: Chief, WH Division
SUBJECT: Draft Memorandum, dated 26 October

1961 (attached)
.
1, Ihave no real quarrel with the attached document, but
I would hope that we would follow the realistic and specific
: position adopted by Chief, WH-4 at the State Department meeting -
on 26 October, In other words, we have four major points
which need settling with Miro according to an agreed upon Ling,
In addition, we need to find out what other complaints Miro has
and try to work out solutions acceptable to both sides, Finally,
we must establish a working relationship between Wendell Johnson
and-Miro through which we can attempt to persuade Miro of the
need of reconstituting hiv efforts in order to undertake a.more
: constructive program thasi his-present purely administrative one.
: In the meantime here in Washington we should be rcexamining
the whole question of how to deal with Cuban exiles with the
: thought that we may be able to present recommendations for a
: change in the present policy position, On this last point I have
i talked to Sherman Kent's office and hope in the near future to
receive a report advising what the estimators think they can
contribute on these last issues, At that time we can also get a

time schedule,

2. Irepeat, however, that for the moment-let us con=
centrate on fe major problems with Miro, eliminate the ambi-
guities which have existed between ourselves, State and the White
House and try to obtain Miro's confidence in order to be more
persuasive with him in the future, :

DRAFT

1,. It is our. feeling that it would be desirable to deal with one

representative of the Cuban exile, movements and,owetepreseatative-of the

- Cuban, underground, - Need for coordination of activities alone makes this

logical, However, we all recognize that both the exile movement and

the underground are badly split into‘factions, It will be a continuous

i struggle to achieve cooperation between these factions, and to achieve

complete unity ae a practical political materia not very realistic, Even

within the Council, and within the FRD,there are elements which will
cooperate with each other on some things and not on others, The experience
with Justo CARRILLO and with Manolo RAY, among others, makes this amply
clear.

2, ACcordingly, as discussed by Dr. MIRO with Mr. HANLEY and
Mr, CLARK, in Baltimore in mid-September, there must be cher unifying and
coordinating factors than simply aduerting the U. S. Government or same :
1 one agency will lend support through the CRC, and anyone who wante funds

‘must go to the CRC, For example, it has Know become apparent that

the withdrawal of support from the AFJ,as requested by Dr. MIRO,has simply
meant that the AFJ has become vocally opposed to the CRC. The leverage

formerly exercised with the AFJ has now been removed, A’ least wef" oh.

ticizing the CRC tee-vecaly.

We were fsameoty able to keep them from c!

i 3, We are sometimes dismayed to hear the charges made by Dr.



MIRO that we are not supporting him exclusively. We feel that if we
oaoely.
eee.
withdw support from some of the other groups, they would become

part of Dr, MIRO's opposition, At the same time, we are dismayed at

the chargeg made by Dr. MIRO's opponents that, .a6 in fact has been the case,

a very large proportion of the support for Cuban exile activities has been
given tohim, The other groups claim, as he does, to have considerable
influénce over the underground and the exile communiyg . They too have
contacts in the various Departments of the U. S. Government and in
buainess in the U. S. and abroad; and, a6 a long timo practical politician,
Dr. MIRO cannot be unaware of the implications of thie situation,

4. We have, therefore, never agreed that te it was feasible to
adopt the highly unrealistic view that exclusive support could be given to
the CRC, since some other groups a) Probably would unite againet the CRC,
b) could get support elsewhere, and, c) almost mo inevitably would
organize a significant anti-CRC movement,

5. We have, therefore, made it known to all groups inside and
outside that while we do not inaist (except in the case of the judges) on unifi-
cation and subordination to the CRC, we would prefer that they at least
coordinate with the Council, sed We have actively discouraged any criticiam
of the Council whenever we had an epportunity, oats,

6. Our position has been made difficult by the fact that Dr. MIRO

has stated or implied to representatives of the various factions that he has

high level U, S. Government sponsorhsip and that the factions cari in fhe

He has also asserted to U. S.

future only obtain support through him,
=

SFrcee


officials that he has presented proposals for, _ sesisting the underground and

‘for aiding the underground, tog ganize and hae received no support from the

Agency. The Agency is aware.of the proposal to aid RAMIREZ, with whom at

the time it was proposed in Baltimre, Dr, Miro said he had no communica
ae comnnaicas

Hong line. We still do not know whether there ia a Aeoereenuone Une,
or many of tng details necdtd to ka asvist RAMIREZ in, the Escambray, If

Dr. Miro now has such details, he might pags it to Colonel Johnaon at a

Separate mecting. The Agency te aware of a pafsposal for a 1, 000 man
invasion force psopesa! which was refused by both State and the White House :

before it was presented to the Agency. We nee no purpose in commenting

further on that plan. At such time aa Dr, MIRO has specific plana for

operations to aid the underground, he or his designee might damine discuss

them with Colonel Johnson,

7. We would like to point ‘out that during the difficult monthe since

Arpil we nave’ costinued to urge the internal redistance groups to organize

in a truly underground manner, to establish tines of command and channels

of communications, and to look to the CRC for guidance, We know that in a
number of instances the external representatives have sought to obtain
guidance from the CRC only after our urging them-toxisaec, We would hope that
Dr. MIRO will be frank enough to recognize these contacts, and the fact that
thru these contacts he has been generally-informed onthe! Segantzational

activity in Cuba,

8. We would'like to make special note for Dr, MIRO that we are



not engaged in another invasion attempt, arc not training Cubans for

an invasion, and, therefore, “cannot keep him informed on any such

activity.

9. We would like to point out that Dr. MIRO has been in frequent
contact during the oak few months with the Department of State, ‘represen-
tatives and has, as directed by the White Hause, taken his guidance from
the State Department, He has rarely sought guidince « or even utilized
as a channel his contact with the Agency which hae been continuously -
available. Many times it has been impossible to reach Dr. MIRO for us
to arrange a meeting because he, according to ARAGON, wae either ill,
ona trip, or preparing for an interview with the State Department or the
White House,

10, It is also worth mentioning that, as Dr. MIRO himself stated
in various meetings, it ie for security reasons neither possible or

desirable to keep Dr, MIRO informed in detail of our activities peeing

ste
Cuba or at times certain Cuban exiles residing in this country ‘ond under our

Protection,

11, We have long felt there are certain aspects of our work which
could have been done by the Frente, but because of lack of interest or
leadership on the part of some, the Frente took the credit, but did little,
We refer here specifically to propaganda. We feel that if the opposition to

the CRC among the student and labor groups calld be overcome, some very

useful Work could be done. We would point out that much of the DRE and
bee yf
Secuer


-5-

FORD activities have been done with modest,and frequently without
i any, financial support, We feel that ideas, organization and persons

i ‘with talent are much more important in these areas than money. We
would like to urge onceng ain that the FRD and the CRC take practical
steps to work with the people in the DRE and the FORD. We certainly do

not want to see the energies of these groups dissipated as has so clearly

occured in the cage of the jurists,

12, We renew our proposal once again that Dr. MIRO have his
people come up with some propaganda ideas.and plans with or without
DRE and FORD type participatdion,and we will give them our most sympathetic
; gonvideration. :
131 Despite our misgivings as to the utility of the further support
of the judiciary groups, we understand a commitment has been made to

again advance Dr. MIRO $5,.000 for the judges and we are honoring thie

commitment.
