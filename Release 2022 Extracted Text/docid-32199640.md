round face, small nose, dark complexion, mestizo (Caucasian

and Indian race) poorly dressed, worked

as a porter and a

dishwasher in restaurants.

TORRES Viewed the photographs of CESAR BOULION,

which were forwarded Los Angeles by Kansas City with

negative results.

TORRES could not recall the address of EDUARDO GULLON

and added that he had furnished the address to SA PETERSON "•

in New York.

The only other person whom TORRES knew who was

acquainted with EDUARDO GULLON was a Puerto Rican, name not

recalled, who was also frequenting the Unemployment Agency

on Warran Street daily. TORRES thought that he might have

given the name of this person to SA PETERSON in New York

City, but he could not recall.

The Puerto Rican, who told

TORRES that he was a member of the Nationalist Party of

Puerto Rico was in contact with GULLON and both were

intending to return to cuba to receive instruction in

espionage, sabotage and subversive activities for the

purpose of returning later to the United States.

TORRES described the Puerto Rican as about 29

years, 5' 6", 130 pounds, black curly hair, dark eyes, thin

nose, part Negro, always wore a white shirt and black trousers.

He had worked at the New York Athletic Club in the kitchen.

TORRES did not know 1f GULLON had worked at the New York

Athletic Club, but considered 1t possible since the Puerto

Rican did work there.

TORRES recalled that the Puerto Rican had been

arrester with others in July or August by the New York

rolice Department when a protestation was made public?, that

Negroes were not being allowed to work in the hospitals in

New York.

lORREs considered that if all the photographs of

these persons arrested were obtained that he could via, them

and identify this Puerto Rican.

TORRES advised that he was a former member of the

police department at Havana, Cuba, under the BATISTA regime

and that he has been well acquainted with FIDEL CASTRO and

communist elements of Cuba having worked on the subversive

detail.

While associating with GULLON and the Puerto Rican,

he criticized the United States and posed as being sympathetic

toward communism in order to ascertain information from

them.

TORRES advised that if any information is ever

obtained about his being sympathetic toward communism, that

his should be discounted because he has spent most of his

life and especially the last five years doing everything

possible to fight communism.

TORRES learned from GULLON and the Puerto Rican

that FIDEL CASTRO is now inducing individuals who are in

favor of communism and who are in the

United States to go to

Cuba for special training creating a "Fifth Column" to

return to the major cities in the United States.

TORRES

learned from GULLON that CASTRO intends within a ten year

period to have enough

"Fifth Column" trainees to take over

the United States.

TORRES was certain that by now GULLON, the puerto

rece vina

allegedly 24 others from New York are

now in Cuba

receiving the described training.

He understood that each

Individual who is to go to Cuba for the training is moved

from the united States clandestinely either through Canada

or Mexico. He did not know the identity of the others as

this was told him by GULLON.

TORRES stated that he had intended to obtain the

name of Dominican who was to go also to Cuba for the

above training, but TORRES left New York City before he

obtained the name.

TORRES repeated that GULLON and the Puerto Rican

vasa cuba which TORRES described as a

well acqualnted and that their contee-haver at the

"individuals who are in favor of CASTRO, and communism against

the U.S."

TORRES advised that he knew nothing further than

that above and that if he were to find out further

Information or assist the Bureau, he was desirous of knowing if

the Bureau would back him all the way if he were uncovered as a

person assisting the Bureau.

T'ORRES was told emphatically that he could never

consider himself to be a Bureau employee and that the Bureau

could never give an individual the license to act on his

own and to take the law in his hands.

TORRES explained that he had gone into the Miami

Office some time back and presented some information

regarding the passing out of pro-CASTRO propaganda and that

at that time he had asked for Bureau backing if he should

infiltrate into pro-CASTRO ranks.

He was told then that he

could not consider himself to be

a Bureau employee and he

advised that he could not understand how anyone could assist

the United States with such a policy.

He considers that the

Bureau would back anyone fully who would volunteer to fight

FIDEL CASTRO and communism. •

TORRES stated that he was disgusted with CIA and

Its policy because he was involved in the Bay of

Pigs

invasion and he met representatives of CIA in Guatemala who

could not speak Spanish and actually what they instructed

with regard to espionage and sabotage was archaic. He

digressed at length to explain how when he tried to open some

ammunition boxes during the invasion that he found bricks in

the boxes and he was certain that there had been a

"double-cross"

, all the way on this invasion.

TORRES was critical of the apathy of the American

people toward CASTRO and he warned of the dangerousness of

CASTRO.

He added that he got to know CASTRO in Cuba and

that CASTRO 1s an egotist who will stop at nothing.

TORRES

was critical because he cannot understand why the Unlied

States allows Cuba to maintain a bastion of arms just 95

miles away froin United States shorer; why persons such as

students are allowed to go to Cuba; and why persons are

allowed to furnish monies to aid Cuba without their being

prosecuted. He identified Cuba as the enemy and any

LA 105-15602

information given Cuba against the United States he considers

is an act of espionage.

He could not understand why even

the

Casa Cuba is allowed tooperate in New York City.

TORRES advised that he is associated with a group

whom he did not volunteer to identify who are disgusted with

the apathy of the American people and the U. S. Government

In Latin American and this group of

Cubans consider their struggle not one of fighting to keep

communism out of Cuba or the United States alone, but of

keeping the entire Western Hemisphere free from conmunism.

He considers their struggle to be a losing battle because

he understands that CASTRO could now cause a revolution for

communism in almost every country in South America but that

Russia is not in accord because Russia fears that CASTRO

would take over and cut Russia out of the material gains.

TORRES was not pressed for the identity of this group because

It was apparent that at this time he would not identify

them.

TORRES advised that it is a mockery to not allow

the report of the FBI concerning the assassination of

President JOHN F. KENNEDY to be made public. TORRES advised

that it is a known fact that LEEXOSWALD was connected with

the Fair Play for Cuba and to not alert the American nation

to this as well as to the distortion of OSWALD's mind is to

i do to ne detor son

be "lulled Into a false

state oflcomplacency."

TORRES advised that Americans have l1ttle if any

understanding of the diabolical ambitions of CASIRO or even

much understanding of communism. He related at length how

ne personally attempted to alert the U. S. Embassy at Havana

about FIDEL CASTRO boing a communist and how many Americans

anot tonate same ey at havana

in Cuba and the U. S. were first sympathetic toward CASTRO.

TORRES considers 1t pathetic that the Voice of

America is so 1l1 equipped to compete with the pro-soviets

broadcasts which are being made to Cuba. He has been appalled

great amount of pro-soviat propaganda being exhibited

to the

American people by television and he

was especially

-5-

LA 105-15602

critical of a recent program concerning the Soviet education

of children which he professed was nothing but "a pack of

lies."

TORRES advised that the American people must

understand that it was BATISTA himself who started communism

1tself in Cuba.

BATISTA

TORRES advised that he would willingly advise at a

paper President of Cuba."

He knew PRIO SOCCARAS had been

recently in Los Angeles. He was certain that MANUAL RAY 1

not pro-soviet. Regarding the latter, he stated that he is

not a soviet spy, tnat MANUEL RAY believes in establishing

only a socialized system of government in Cuba and purposely

wants to eliminate communism.

TORRES was friendly and was desirous of having a

meet again.

TORRES advised that he is presently employed at

the Packard-Bell Industrial Products factory and that he

daily tries to apprise his fellow workers who are Americans

of the danger of FIDEL CASTRO toward the future of the

United States.

He explained that the is hopeful of

obtaining better employment in order to continue in his

fight against communism.

He exhibited an advertising sketch

he had drawn and started that he was hopeful of obtaining

employment in designing for advertisements.

He stated that

he needs more money to support his family and more time to

do what he wants to struggle against communism.

TORRES explained that his wife's mother 1s in

Miami and he 1s hopeful of moving her to Los Angeles, and

thereby reside in the Los Angeles area unless CASTRO were

deposed

and he

could then return to Cuba.
