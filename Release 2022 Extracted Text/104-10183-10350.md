REFERENCES:

L. In the English version of the paper based on AMMUG-1 information

prepared for presentation to the OAS, DGI operations were described with

the DGI case titles but without true rames. At the request of the deske

concerned, references to the three specific operations were deleted

from the printed Engilth version and were not treluded in the Spanish

translation. The deletion in the English version was accomplisbed merely

by drawing red lines through the text, leaving it clearly legible.

2. When tise English version of the report was Inadvertently (and

without the Agency knowledge) passed to a Mexican government official,

the Mexican government became aware of Agency interest in the three

operations, since they had been first included and then removed from the

report text.

3. It is believed that in spite of this incwledge no security breach

has occurred.

The mention of the operation, in each case, was a brief

summary, no true names were used (although the location and nationality

of the agent were given), and in one case a description of the person was

altered in a manner to Conceal the identity (a wonian was described as a

man). There was no indication in the text of Agency interest, and the

only indication of it was the deletion of the description frown the final

text.
