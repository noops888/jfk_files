(M) I just wondered . . . you know if

(v) . . » Sully Sherone our attorney,
he told me that he had seen Jimmy of course they were
on this negotiation and he is the one who told me
about . . ,. that they're moving down to Chattanooga and...
from the work we've done in that state, knowing that state

just don't know, This is the toughest one he's ever had,

(M) Well, I'm not sure that that isn't actually gonna be the route
. cause, . . working as we did . . . that's a practical state. ..

and on the other hand I've never seen, you know you talk about
clannishness up in New Hampshire or the clannishness out on
say North Shore in Chicago, Those people are all related to
each other and unless you're in, you're out. Now that would
be true. . they wouldn't like Jimmy but they're not gonna like
Bobby either.

(M) One thing that concerns me though is when we talked in Washington
. . and talked about the possibility of Chicago and so on...

(M) I can't see how it's gonna do one darn bit of good to have the
fix in Chicago, If he gets convicted in Tennessee, because

- from Tennessee it.comes to Chicago and with a recent felon,
he's had it. No matter how much your Judge might help ...
because under those circumstances . .. it's just too soon,

Inaudible

(@) .. .'At least we can keep track of it in Chicago because
we'll be in a position to help . , . . apparently they're just
not sure that the one down South is right on the line...
Inaudible —

(wv) I don't think it's helped him a lot to get it moved,

a Well, I think as a matter of fact it's probably hurt because . , .
little town... 7

69) Sort of a home town thing where everybody knows everybody and
. there is certainly no industry there compared to Nashville ...
law of averages get friendlier...

Inaudible
(M) . . . and anybody that's on the bench down there is gonna listen . .
. which is from that point of view a practical thing but it bothers

me cause he's gotta come out of Tennessee without a conviction
otherwise when he comes to Chicago . . .«

It can't be done by Jimmy, it's got to be done by somebody ....
else that's in an entirely different industry, you as a banker
or somebody like myself as an engineer ...

I agree absolutely . . . it better be somebody . . that can

. » other reason to be talking to these people . , have
nothing to do with the situation down in Chattanooga at all but
. . ah . . I think it can be done but it costs money.

Like, any idea?

Well, I would just guess, I would think that . . ah . . to
delude the top guy would cost a quarter of a million bucks.
Maybe. even half a million, Campaign contributions I don't
think they're interested in, I think they'd be interested in
real money. Maybe . . ,. on a COD basis, that way you know
somebody doesn't get paid before they get .. . ah . cause
they work on the honor system down there anyway, they always
have . . but that the only way .. . the reason I know is that
even though we have this bankruptcy in . ,. ..all kinds of
interstate highway stuff and you have to be qualified...
qualified , . .so. . and they just sit down and say well
okay ... they're looking for cash . . you're in the country
or out of it, they don't. care but that's it. No hitches, no
problems,

Inaudible

You think you can get them to come up with that money...

Did you ever talk to Jimmy about this

The tape recorder was concealed on Meissner's person
by Special Agent William F, Hood prior to Meissner flying to
Detroit and was removed immediately upon his return to O'Hare
International Airport where he was met by Special Agents William
F, Hood and Gale T, Johnson at approximately 2:40 P.M., CST,
January 10, 1964,. Upon removal of the recorder, it was noted
that the supply reel of the recorder had been completely emptied.
