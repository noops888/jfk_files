SOURCE:

1. Contrary to the reports which are issued by the Cuban Goverment, the

financial status of the Cuban economy is rapidly deteriorating ani
beconing a serious problem. During July 1959 an advisor to Prime
Minister Fidel CASTRO Rua, warned hin to proceed more slowly with the
agrorian reform, because the Cuban treasury vas running short of funds. fee
It was pointed out that 57 sygar mi2ls were barkrupt ani had not paid

: the plantation owners for the 1959 sugar crop. CASTRO waa told that
if the reckless confiscation of agricultural properties ccutinued, the
Cuban Goverment would become obligated to assume even more debts in
order to alleviate the hunger of farz workers.

2. Avother drain on the econony is goverment subsidies. For example,
the danoo de Desarrollo Econonico y Social (BANDES, Social and
Economie Developnent Bank) coutrols about U.S. $400 nillion in
properties and investuents such as the Compwita Cubans de Aviacion

‘Cuban Airline Company). The companies have been caught in the
Present contraction of capital and canact survive without goverment
subsidies, The subsidies paid by BAND=S amount to U. S. $8 million
4 month, and this 1s only one exemple of the many payments vhich are
draining tae Cuban treasury.2 .

to proceed vith the agrarian reform progran a3 fast as possible. Since
the bigsest obstacle to carrying out this program 1s the lack of mosoy,
