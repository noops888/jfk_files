I. fontrary to the reports which are issued by the Cuban Governont, tho

financial status of the Cuban econouy 18 rapidly deteriorating and

boconing a serious problem. During July 1959 an advisor to Primo

Ministar fidal CAstho luse werned hin to proceed nora alonly with the

agrarian reform, because the Cuban treasury was running sbort of funda.

It was pointed out that 57 sugar mills were barkrupt and bad sot pald

the plantation ownors for the 1959 sugar crop. CASTSO was told that

1l the reckless confiscation of agricultural propertios contimiod, tho

Cuban Government would becone obligated to assume even nure debts in

order to alleviato the hunger of lara vorkera. I

2. Another drain va the oconory is goverment subsidios. For example,

the danoo de Desarrollo Econonico y Social (BANDES, Social add

Economio Development Bank) coutrola about U. S. $400 a111103 In

properties and investaents such as the Compuñla Cubana de Aviacion

(Cuban Airlino Conpany). The compastes have boen asusht in the

presont contraction of capital and cannot survive without goverment

subsidies. The subsidies paid by BAND'S amount to U. S. 88 million

a month, and this 18 only 0ne exemple of the many payments ubich are

draining the Cuban treasury. ?

Eield Corments.

1. Pros tho reporte undoh baro boon peootred Is appears that there 1e

musing unemployment of farn sorkers. This is the "daad season"

be period between sugar cene barvests--but it is roportad that

most plantation owners and ranchers are fearful of contiacation of

their proportios for the agrarian reform prograny and consoquently

are doing very littlo in the vay of maintenance vark. The lattor

provided at least a marginal firld of employment, and this 10 sor

deniod to

14a, agrioultural vorkers. Honoros, In spito or this

varing; the ágrarlan refora progran has not been aloved. In

fact, It seems to have been intensifiad.
