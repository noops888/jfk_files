OPERATIONAL INFORMATION REPORT

US citizen. Educator.

AUS educator vho spent several months in the USSR during the summer
of 1973 reported that his college-age child, vho accompanied him, had
becone well acquainted vith sone Soviet young people in Moscow and
had learned that they (the' young ‘people) hed an amazing avarencon of
Soviet sccurity-type activities against foreigners. They vere willing
to discuss these activitics quite openly with the young US visitor.
They seamed to knov tha identitics of forefeners who vere under sus
picion, the reasons they were under suspicion and the asture of sur-
voillance activities that were being carried out againet them,

"OVC Co or te
The young US visitor, vho speaks jAsaian fluently, mentioned two cases
in point: one had to do with Leo’ Cruliow, @ correspondent for the
Christian Sctence “onitor. .He is apparently under suspicion because,
firet of all, hie parente were (cr are) Tussin. Secoadly, ha vae

_ with Quaker War Relfef in the USS? during World Nar II. These circu

stances, and perhaps others, have reportedly caused the Soviets to
Yegard him ss some Lind of spy, and he is watched unusually closely.
There was convincing evidence of thiga when Gruliow vas entertained by
the visiting US educator for dinner one evening in the restaurant of
the hotel vhere the US visitor vas staying. As soon as the party vas
over and the US group left, the drunken husband of the vaitress who
had served the group in the restaurant was reportedly suxmoned outside
by two Soviets who vere waiting in a car, and he was questioned in
Great detail as to viat the foreisners had said. The young US visitor
heard this from a young Soviet acquaintance wio either had a friend
working for the Soviet authorities or who was working for the authorix,

Another instance which seemed to denonstrate the youns peoples’
avareness of the-faviet officials’ close scrutiny of foreigners had

to do with a US defector named Vartin whois believed to be living ae

in Hoscov. During the US educator's visit to the USSR he (the ede-
eator) received a letter fron fricnds in the US asking if, he could

find out about artin's present situation — his health, ete. The
educator mantioned the lotter to his child (the US student) and said

he 61d vot want to have anything te do with the request that vas made. ~
By coincidence the US student had already been filled -in on information
about Martin, hovever, by one of the younr Soviets. -The report was
that Mertin was living tn an apertoent at the end of Leningradskiy

Prospekt, that he was living on # pension and he was suffering frou
extreme boradon because be apparently was not doing anything, bat
that he was in good health. Additionally, it wes mentioned thet
Mertin appeared to be in his fifties (vhile he 1s setualiy much
younger). There wea, of course, no way to verify any of thie infer—
metion, but it had been volunteered frealy to the US stodent by
seentngly intelligent young Soviets, and there ecened no reason to
doubt its authenticity.
