MALCOLM CUMMING, Official of British Security

Service, MI-5, advised that he has, for a number of years,

developed confidential

sources in Lloyds of London.

Colonel

CUMMING, at the request of the Legal Attache, contacted

these sources to determine if ANGELO BRUNO had financial

dealings in the gambling casino at the Plaza Hotel, Havana,

Cuba.

On April 24, 1961, Colonel CUMMING advised that

MI-5's confidential sources had stated that Lloyds of

London had acted as the reinsurer for the American Inter-

national Reinsurance Corporation of New York City to the

extent of $70,000 for a policy made out to the subject in

connection with, the gambling casino at the Plaza Hotel,

Havana, Cuba.

Colonel CUMMING said that in April of 1959, a

claim was paid to the subject for $185, 000, principally by the

American International Reinsurance Corporation in respect to

a fire, which had occurred at the gambling casino at the Plaza .

Hotel, Havana, Cuba, on January 21, 1959 6x

Colonel CUMMING stated that in making this informa-

tion available to this office, he would respectfully request

that no dissemination of this information be made outside of

the Bureau:

and that extreme discretion be used in connection with

this Information in order that the American International Rein-

surance Corporation would not know that the original information

came from Lloyas organization in London.

Any such revelation would

certainly jeopardize MI-5's future relation with the Lloyds

concern. 151

Colonel CUMMING also pointed out that Lloyds acts as

a reinsurance organization for other insurance companies, and

any money paid by Lloyds is paid not to the individual policy

holders but to other insurance companies to help them cover their

losses when heavy demands are put upon their resources by their own

policy holders.
