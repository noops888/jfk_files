and winter of 1946-47) was omployed by various Departments and
Agencies of the U. S, Government, including the Federal Bureau of

with foreign government and other U. S. government officials.

Liaison on occasions, both domestic and foroign, related to
matters of the highest sensitivity and importance and accordingly
was conducted at highest levels (Cabinet and sub-Cabdinet).

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr, Birch D, O'Neal,
Cl salt

SUBJECT : Notification of Noa-oligidility for Designation as a
Participant in the CIA Retirement and Disability
System

1. Ihave your memorandum ::if 27 October 1966 which refers to my
memorandum advising you that in the in{tial screening of personnel eligible
to become participants in the CIA Retirement System you have been deters
mined to be ineligible because «fan apparent deficiency in “qualifying duty"?
It is important that you realize that such a deficiency is caly sigalficant la
the initial review of Agency personnel who have 15 or more years ul Agency
service since the law permits such ;-ergons to acquire at their ption a
interest in the CIA Retirement System. At the same time, the law
requires a minimum of 60 months qualifying duty belore one can possibly
adap for retirement benefits under the CIA Retirement System. k serves
purport therefore, to place a person permanently ia the System if there
ie a possibility that he may never cuallfy for benefits thereia.

2. In paragraph 2 of your memoranduin you indicate concern that failure
to contest the initial findings in your case may ; rejudice the possibility of a
favorable decision with regard te your cligibility to .articipate in the CIA
Retirement System at some future date. It is sesumed that you were referring
to the possibility that you may bave some additional service that could perhaps
be considered as qualifying duty under the System. a noted in ;aragraph Z
of my memorandum «£28 September 1966, our Initial determination of
ineligibility does not prectude reconsideration .f your cligibility at some
future date.

3. As you know, Rogulation 20-50 provides ior aa appeal to the Director
of any adverse determinztion under that regulation. Hewever, the regulation
also provides an opportunity :or an employee to ; resent his case to the CIA
Retirement Board prior to the making of an adverse determination. Because
of the large number of employees covered in the initial screening of on-duty
employees to identify thoso eligible for participation in the System, this
procedure vas not applied when, 9 in your case, the employee's Career
Service reported that he did not meet the requirements -f Regulation 20-50 for
nomination 26 a ;articipant. Accordingly, the procedure «{ notifying employees
of their non-cligibility tor participation in the Systen: based upon the initial
finding “f an en:ployee's Career Service has beea ‘ollowed in all euch cases,
This is contrary to the implication in ;aragraph 2? f your memorandum that
other employces in circumstances similar to ycurs vere aot so informed and
I would be pleased to look more deeply into that aspect -f your memorandwa,

if you wieh.



SECRET -

4. In the ovent that you have performed service which you believe to
be qualifying duty under the CIA Retirement System, you are moat certainly
entitled to ;resent the details of such service to the Clandestine Services
Career Service Board for review and formal submission to the CIA Retiree
ment Board. A copy =f this memorandum will be forwarded to the Executive

Secretary of that Board,

SUBJECT : Notification ae OF Designation as a
Part fc ipant teagan Rt vand Disabtlity System

1. As you may know, we ate in’ the” proce: Teviewing the employment
history and current carcer fietd of all employees in the Agency to identify
those who are eligible for designation as a partictpant in the new CIA
Retirement and Disability System. In this precess, the initial review of
each case is made by the individual's Career Service, If.the Head of his
Career Service nominates him for partictpetion in the System, this nomina-
tion 16 reviewed by the CIA Retirement Board which recommends {inal action
to me. However, 1f the Head of the Career Service advises that the employee
does not meet the basic requiresents of HR 20-50 for participation, I have
accepted this’ {nding without turther review by the CIA Retirement Board.
This practice has been adopted in the interest of expediting this screening
process so that those employees vho are eligible to participate in the Sys=
tem may be designated participants as soon as possible.

2. In your case, the Hea! of your Career Service has advised me that
you do not meet the requirements cf UR 20-50 for designation as a partict=
pant and I have accordingly maic the formal determination required by the
regulation that you are not eligible for designation, From a review of your
record 1t appears that the decision of your Career Service was based upon
the fact that you have 15 years cr more of Agency service, but have not a8
yet performed 60 months of qualifying service as required by regulation, My
determination that you are not eligible at this time for designation {n no
way affects your current status under the Civil Service Retirement System,
nor does it preclude reconsideration of your eligibility to participate in
the CIA System 1f you should met the requirements for designation in the

future,
3. Should you desire further information concerning the requirements

for designation asa participant in the CIA Retirement System, I suggest that

you read paragraph. ¢ of HR 20-30 and paragraph $ of the Employee Bulletin
dated 30 July 1965, entitled “Fudlic Lav 88-643, The Central Intelligence

Agency Retirement Act of 1964 tor Certain Employees."

4. Lt 1s always possible that the recards upon which the determination
made in your case may have bees incomplete or inaccurate regarding your actual
employment history with the acency. If, after studying the materials cited
above, you have questions regarding the determination that you are not eligt-
ble to participate in the CIA Retirement System, please feel free to contact
officials of your Career Service. They are familiar with the details of your
case and will gladly discuss then with you. In addition, you may wish to dls-
cuss your case with the C1A Retirement Staff located in Room 205, Magazine
Building (extension 2847), 11 such discussions do not resolve any questions
you have regarding your cligiS request that your case be formally
considered by the CIA Retirement Board, However, this request must be made with-

in 30 days of the date of this memorandum, sat
