Thanks for the quick response on Lockheed. | passed the information to the ARRB staff; they will keep us informed. The fax
cof pages from Rich's book is on its way.

What do you know of NPIC records? In December (?) 1963, NPIC was ask to analyze the Zapruder film of the Kennedy
assassination. In May 1975, the Agency told the Rockefeller Commission that the Secret Service requested the analysis, was present
during the test, and took the film. The ARRB staff has found in the sequestered collection what they believe is evidence that the
Agency made three additional copies. Their question: who directed the copying of the film and what happen to the copies? Do you know
who has NPIC’s 1963 records or how to go about searching this topic?

Who called whom? — Dave Montague and Douglas Home called Homer A. McMahon of
Witnesses/Consultants

Description ofthe Call 00-7

Date: 06/12/97

Subject: Dave Montague and Douglas Horne Called Homer A. McMahon (Modifled on June
13, 1997) a
_ Summary of the Call:

[See Contact Profile for details on how this individual was located.]

Dave Montague located Mr. McMahon and initiated telephonic contact on June 9, 1997; | was invited
to participate in the interview as the staff member most interested in, and most familiar with, the NPIC
working notes of their analysis of the Zapruder film.

The following is a summary of the independent recollections of Mr. McMahon made during ARRB's
cursory, initial assessment interview. Comments are not verbatim unless in quotations:

-He was the Head of NPIC's color lab in 1963. At that time NPIC was no longer in NW Washington
above Steuart Motors (where it was during the Cuban Missile Crisis), but had relocated to BLDG 213 in
the Washington Navy Yard, following a quick 90-day renovation of a warehouse with no windows directed
by Robert Kennedy. McMahon was careful to clarify that he was an employee of NPIC in 1963, not the
CIA, and that the CIA only “paid his salary."

-McMahon did recall the Zapruder film analysis in some detail, and confirmed ARRB's understanding
that the analysis (of which frames in which shots struck occupants of the limousine) was performed at the
request of the Secret Service. He recalled that a Secret Service agent named “Bill Smith" personally
brought the film over to NPIC, and that the personnel involved in the analysis were himself (McMahon),
Bill Smith of the USSS, and a third person whose name McMahon would not reveal to us during the
interview "because he is still current."

-TIMING: McMahon thought that the analysis had occurred only “1 or 2 days” after the assassination;
he also recalled that there was a great sense of urgency regarding the desired product, and that he had to
“work all night long" to complete thé required work (described below). At one point he said he thought he
had gone into work about 1 A.M. to commence the analysis; later he corrected himself and said that
Perhaps it was more like 8 P.M., but that in any case he was sure that the work occurred after normal
working hours, required him to retum to work, and that the analysis went on all night long.

-McMahon never used the name Zapruder film during the interview; he repeatedly referred to the film
in question as an “amateur movie" of the assassination brought to NPIC by the Secret Service.

-PROVENANCE OF THE FILM: McMahon stated that Secret Service agent Bill Smith claimed he had
personally picked up the film from the amateur who had exposed it, had flown it to Rochester for
developing, and had then couriered it to Washington, DC to NPIC for analysis and for the creation of


13-00000

photographic briefing boards, using still photographic prints enlarged from selected individual frames of
the movie. After twice mentioning Rochester as the site where the film was developed, Dave Montague
(in an attempt to specify whether McMahon was referring to R.I.T., or Kodak) asked whether he meant
Kodak, and McMahon emphatically said "I mean Kodak at Rochester." | asked him how firm he was that
this is what the Secret Service agent told him, and he said he was “absolutely certain.”

-REASONS FOR ANALYSIS AT NPIC VICE ANOTHER LOCATION: McMahon said that USSS
agent Bill Smith told him the reason the film had been couriered to NPIC was because NPIC had special,
state-of-the-art enlarging equipment which Kodak did not have at Rochester. McMahon said that after the
analysis of where shots occurred on the film was completed, many frames were selected ("perhaps as
many as 40, but not more than about 40") for reproduction as photographic prints, and that NPIC's special
"10-20-40 enlarger” was used to magnify each desired image frame "40 times its original size for the

* manufacture of internegatives." McMahon said that the internegatives were then used for the production

of multiple color prints of each selected frame. He said that the color lab at NPIC where he worked did not
prepare the actual briefing boards, but that he assumed the briefing boards were prepared somewhere
else at NPIC, in some other department.

-In response to clarification questions by Home, McMahon said that af no time was the amateur movie
copied as a motion picture film ,and that the only photographic work done at NPIC was to make color
Prints. He could not remember whether the prints were 5" X 7" format, or 8" X 10* format.

-Home asked whether he was working with the original film or a copy, and McMahon stated with some
certainty that he was “sure we had the original film." Home asked why, and he said that he was sure it
was the original because it was Kodachrome, and because it was a “double 8" movie. Home asked him to
clarify whether the home movie was slit or unslit, and McMahon said that he was pretty sure the film was
UNSLIT, because "we had to flip it over to see the image on the other side in the correct orientation." He
said that the movie was placed in an optical printer, in which the selected frames were then magnified to
40 times their original size for the production of internegatives. He said a "liquid gate" process was used
(on the home movie frames) to produce the internegatives.

-Prior to the production of intemegatives and color prints for briefing boards, he said he recalled an
analysis "to determine where the 3 shots hit." He said he would not share the results of the analysis with
us on the telephone. The film was projected as a motion picture 4 or 5 times dusting the analysis phase,
for purposes of determining "where the 3 shots hit.”

informed Mr. McMahon that CIA's HRG had deposited a surviving briefing board
and the original working notes in the JFK Collection in 1993 for access by the public, and that they were
not classified. Montague promised to send McMahon an information package explaining the JFK Act and
the Review Board's mandate, and Home and Montague asked Mr. McMahon is he would be willing to
submit to a formal, in-depth, recorded interview at Archives {I with the briefing board and the working
notes available to him during the interview. He agreed.

-McMahon explained that the working notes were “prepared jointly by the 3 of us working on the
Project that night." END

Who called whom? Douglas Home called Roland ("Rollie") Zavada of Witnesses/Consultants

Date: 06/16/97
Subject: Doug Horne Called Rollie Zavada
Summary of the Call:

As requested by Jeremy Gunn, | called Rollie Zavada to pursue questions the ARRB staff has about
the developing and processing of 8 mm film; Jim Milch had given me permission to contact Rollie directly
on an informal basis.

| asked Rollie whether copies of the original Zapruder film could have been properly exposed on a
contact printer using Kodachrome II daylight film, vice Kodachrome IIA (designed for a tungsten light
source). He said the answer was yes, but that the exposure would be extremely slow, because more
exposure time would be needed for the Kodachrome II (daylight) film than for the Tungsten film. He
‘elaborated by saying that with Kodachrome II film in the contact printer vice Kodachrome IIA, that the
required exposure per frame might be one fourth of a second per frame, vice one one-hundredth of a
second per frame with Kodachrome IIA; he said that the contact printer would have to be operated much
slower with Kodachrome I! film than with Kodachrome IIA. [Background: the 11/22/63 affidavits executed
by Zapruder with the Jamieson and Kodak film lab people cite Kodachrome II film as the medium used for
copying the original assassination movie, not Kodachrome IIA; however, the edge print on the 2 Secret
Service copies at NARA reads “Kodachrome MA.']

After | informed Rollie of the apparent discrepancy between the affidavits and the two Secret Service
copies, he said that to him there was not necessarily any discrepancy. He said that the "product type"
was Kodachrome Il, whether the film was II.(daylight) or IIA (tungsten light source), and that the
designation IIA vice II simply indicates a variation in color balance, but not a change in product type. He
‘said that we should not necessarily interpret the apparent discrepancy between the affidavits and the edge
print on the Secret Service copies at NARA as important, because a “film person" would quite possibly
describe only product type, and not address color balance, in ordinary conversation.

He elaborated that a reading lamp is 2800 degrees Kelvin; a contact printer light source is 3200
degrees Kelvin; and sunlight is about 5000 degrees Kelvin.

I next asked him questions about how Kodak labs routinely punched numbers into double 8 mm film
following processing (developing). He said the following:

-the unique, punched numbers would routinely be punched into the tail end of side two of the double 8
mm movie film following developing;

-one reason for this is because the emulsion number (a 7 digit punched number) was always punched
into the head end of side one at the factory.

l asked him where physical splices might normally appear in a normally processed film coming out of
a Kodak lab. His answers follow:

-there should normally be 3 splices, as follows:

-one between the white leader and the beginning of the film (so that the film could be threaded into the
Projector); one in the middle marrying side one and side two after slitting; and one at the tail end, if leader
was added to the tail of the film.


13-00000

asked him whether there were any reason to normally separate (cut) the punched number applied by
the processing lab off of the tail end of side two of the film and splice it into another part of the film, and he
said "no, not unless there was a lot of fogged area on the developed film between the end of the image
and the punched number."

I discussed with him Jim Milch's e-mail of 6/12/97 regarding "a film in his possession which was.
processed in Rochester." Rollie explained that his film is a private home movie, not an assassination film.
He said it is proof that a film processed (developed) in Rochester would have an "R" in the edge print. He
said he would photocopy the edge print and mail it to me so that | can see what the Rochester lab marking
looks like, and then compare this edge print to the edge print on the various films at NARA.

Rollie then discussed potential camera tests using a Bell and Howell camera of the same model as
Abe Zapruder's. He said that further research he has done indicates that the “inertial effect" may be
peculiar or unique to Zapruder's individual camera, and may not occur in other cameras of the same
model. [This has implications for proposed ARRB camera tests.]

Rolile said he would be on vacation from July 10-August 2, inclusive, but would be available after that
for any business we might wish to conduct. END:

MEETING REPORT

Document's Author: Douglas Home/ARRB _— Date Created: 06/18/97

BCLS Tet B r+ (5: Sia
Date: : 06/17/97

Agecny Name: CIA
Attendees: Morgan Bennett Hunter (Ben Hunter) was interviewed by Doug Home, Jeremy
Gunn, Dave Montague, and Michelle Combs

‘Topic: ARRB Staff Interviewed Ben Hunter (Grammatical Edits Made on June 19,

1997) (Final Edit Made June 20, 1997)

Summary of the Meeting 2.00

ARRB staff interviewed Ben Hunter on June 17, 1997. The interview was arranged by HRG at
ARRB's request. Mr. Hunter had remarked to his wife (an HRG employee), during C-Span coverage of
the Review Board's Zapruder film public hearing, that he had worked on an analysis of the film at NPIC in
1963 shortly after the assassination. His wife relayed that fact, and the name of his supervisor at NPIC
(who also worked on the Z-film analysis), Mr. Homer A. McMahon, to the ARRB via Barry Harrelson at
HRG. Previous to this interview, ARRB staff had conducted a brief initial assessment interview of Mr.
McMahon on the telephone.

Mr. Hunter was on active duty in the USAF prior to working for NPIC (Nationa! Photo Interpretation
Center). While in the Air Force as an enlisted man (at Offut Air Force Base in Nebraska, at SAC
Headquarters), he received photographic training and worked on “special processing" programs, which he
explained were aerial and early satellite photography (reconnaissance) products. He sald he was offered
a job at NPIC before he left the Air Force. He said he left the Air Force on 30 November 1962, started
working at NPIC (then located at 5th and K Streets in the Steuart Ford dealership building in NW
Washington) on 17 December 1962, and helped NPIC move to its new quarters at BLDG 213 in the
Washington Navy Yard on January 1, 1963. He said that he worked on the same kind of aerial/satellite
reconnaissance products at NPIC as he did in the Air Force; he specifically mentioned that NPIC had the
capability to handle 70 mm KH4 film, and 9.5" U-2 KHB film. He said that the majority of his experience in
the Air Force was with B & W film, because all of the reconnaissance film in those days was B & W. He
said that he assisted Homer McMahon in establishing the Color Lab at NPIC sometime during 1963, after
working 6-9 months in the B & W section.at NPIC; he said Homer McMahon was the head of the new
color lab.and was his supervisor. Just prior to leaving the Air Force, and just after joining NPIC, Mr.
Hunter said he did a lot of work on reconnaissance photography of surveillance of Cuba during, and
following, the Cuban Missile Crisis. He said much of the work was follow-up photography to ensure that
the Soviet missiles really had left Cuba.

Mr. Hunter said he did participate in an NPIC event involving the Zapruder film in 1963, but cautioned
at the beginning of the interview that his memory of this event was “extremely fuzzy," and told us
repeatedly that Mr. Homer McMahon's memory was probably much better than his. Listed below is a.
summary of the essential pieces of information he passed to us during the interview:

-He recalled that he and Homer McMahon worked with the Zapruder film very shortly after the

‘assassination in 1963, just 2 or 3 days afterwards. At another point he said it may have been the next day

(Saturday) or Sunday, November 24, and that he thought it was prior to the funeral of President Kennedy.
He recalled that no one else from NPIC (other than he and Homer McMahon) was in the building, which
means it was almost certainly the weekend of the assassination; he also recalled that he had to drive in


13-00000

from home to do this job, and that he was not already at work when the project was assigned.

-He recalled that a "Captain Sands" delivered the home movie of the assassination to him and Homer
McMahon; he thought Sands (a person in civilian clothes whom was simply addressed as "Captain*) was
probably with the CIA Office of Security, or perhaps was the NPIC Head of Security, but could not be sure
today. He said that another person may have been present, or arrived with Sands, but could not
remember much about that. Later in the interview, when he was asked whether he remembered any
Secret Service involvement, he said that our question did ring a bell with him, and that yes, he did believe
there may have been a Secret Service employee present. He said that the others (Sands, the person with
Sands, and McMahon) were already present when he arrived. He said Sands remained “close by,”
observing the work, while he and McMahon handled and worked with the Zapruder film.

-He said Sands directed that he and McMahon not talk about their work that night with anyone, not
even anyone else at NPIC, and that if people were to press him on it, they were to be directed to call
Captain Sands. In fact, when he put in for overtime for the Zapruder film work, Hunter said he would not
tell the Head of the Photographic Lab the reason, the person became upset, and he had to direct that
supervisor to call Captain Sands for an explanation. ip

-The Zapruder film was not copied as a motion picture; in fact, Hunter said that NPIC did not have that
capability for color movies, since they were in the business of still, B & W reconnaissance photography for
the most part. He said that the assigned task was to analyze (i.e., locate on the film) where occupants of
the limousine were wounded, including “studying frames leading up to shots," and then produce color
prints from appropriate frames just prior to shots, and also frames showing shots impacting limousine
occupants. He recalled laying the home movie out on a light table and usirig a loupe to examine individual
frames. He could not recall whether they received any instructions as to number of shots, or any
guidance as to where to look in the film.

-He recalled making internegatives from about 8 total selected frames from the movie, and then
making multiple (number uncertain) 8" X 10" or 9" X 9" color prints from the intemegatives. The machine
used for manufacture of the internegatives was a "10 X 20 X 40 enlarger." He said that on initial attempts,
the intemegative size was 8" X 10", but that later the size of the internegs was "cut down." By this he did
not mean cropped, but that the final internegs used were smaller than the initial size of 8" X 10°. He said
that the process of selecting frames of interest, and the production of the intemegatives, took a minimum
eu to 2 hours, and perhaps @ maximum of 3 to 4 hours to accomplish,

He did not personally participate in the making of any briefing boards, although he said he would not
be surprised to find out that someone else at NPIC may have.

-His memories of film content were limited to seeing a skull explosion, bone fragments, and Jackie
Kennedy crawling on the trunk of the car. Apparently to those involved that night the film was only
referred to as a "home movie," but he seemed convinced that it was the Zapruder film based on
subsequent viewings of it over the years in documentaries. He had no independent recollection of which
way the President's head moved (forwards or backwards) from his memories of work that night. He
recalled that there were 2 or 3 frames showing the "head explosion," which he alternatively described as
“a cloud of material surrounding President Kennedy's head.”

-His impression is that the film was probably in 16 mm format, but was not of an unslit double-8 mm
film. It was his strong impression that they were working with the original, but when asked whether there
were images present between the sprocket holes, he said that it was his reasonably strong impression
today that there were no such images present between the sprocket holes in the film he examined at
NPIC. At one point he described the film as “not high resolution.”

-All materials created or used had to be tumed in to Sands upon completion of their work: the motion


13-00000

picture film itself; finished prints (of approximately 8 views); test prints (made for the purpose of
determining color balance); test internegatives; and the final intemegatives used to make the prints.

-As he talked during the interview, his estimates of the amount of time involved to do this work
expanded, to the point where by the end of the interview, he was convinced that the entire job probably
took a minimum of between 5-7 hours to accomplish. Before talking with us about the details of the
process, he said he would initially have estimated only 2-3 hours of work. He recalled that the work
started during the daytime, and ended during the night-time.

-When asked, he said he did recall counting frame numbers (i.e., counting off the location of selected
frames) on the movie film.

-When asked if he or his co-worker McMahon made any notes, he said that he had no specific

: recollection of having done so, but that if they did, the notes were probably related to color correction (i.e.,

use of filters).

-EXAMINATION OF NPIC WORKING NOTES: The NPIC working notes, released twice in response
to FOIA lawsuits as "CIA document 450," are numbered today as RIF # 1993.07.22.08:41:07:620600,
Agency File number 80T01357A, JFK Box # JFK39. The original working notes were placed in the JFK
Collection at NARA in 1993 by the CIA's HRG, along with one surviving briefing board (which consists of 4
panels). The briefing board is also in JFK Box # "JFK39," which is one large flat containing the four
briefing board panels (RIF # 1993.07.21.15:48:04:930600) and the original working notes from NPIC.

This interview was conducted at a CIA office space, not at Archives II in College Park. Consequently,
ARRB staff had.a good photocopy of the working notes with them, but not the briefing board.

-Comments of Mr. Hunter during examination of the NPIC working notes are summarized below:

-—He recognized his handwriting on only one page: the handwritten page which describes the
organization of the briefing board panels; and on this page, he only recognized two words (the column
headers "Print #" and "Frame #") as being written in his hand. He said the remainder of the writing on this
half-page was not his. He did not remember seeing the page before, or witnessing its creation, or writing
on it-he simply recognized the writing for two of the column headers as his.

—He did not recognize any of the other pages in the NPIC working notes, nor did he think that such
activity (¢.g., 3 different shot scenarios, and calculation of seconds between shofs at two different camera
speeds) took place during the night he and Mr. McMahon performed their work. He-was of the belief that
the activity described in the NPIC working notes occurred during a second event at NPIC, one which
occurred after the work done by he and Mr. McMahon.

-—He said that to him, the kind of analysis represented by the NPIC notes looked like it may have
been done by mensuration experts at NPIC, and said that if this were the case, he would think that
candidates for this kind of analysis would be either Todd Augustine, Allan Gill, or Steve Clark.

-—He said that he could recall no discussion of the film speed of the camera which took the
assassination movie (whereas in the notes, both a 16 FPS, and an 18 FPS, timing scenario for shots is
laboriously computed in longhand).

--—He said at one point that "I think this was done again" during the tenure of the Warren Commission.

--—Even after viewing the NPIC notes referring to three sets each of 28 individual selected frames, he
did not waver from his opinion that only about 8 frames were selected for reproduction that night by he
and Mr. McMahon.

Mr. Gunn asked Mr. Hunter to review his pay stubs from 1963 to see if he could determine, from
overtime records, the timing of this event. Mr. Hunter agreed.

At the conclusion of the interview Mr. Hunter expressed a desire to get together with Mr. McMahon
and talk about these events from 1963. We asked him to defer until after we had formally interviewed Mr.


13-00000

McMahon, in person. Jeremy Gunn then suggested that on the day we schedule a formal McMahon
interview at NARA, that we invite Mr. Hunter the same day so that following the McMahon interview, both
men could view the briefing board and original notes together and share their impressions with each other.
Mr. Hunter said he liked that idea. END

Who called whom? = Douglas Horne called Morgan Bennett Hunter (Ben Hunter) of CIA

Description ofthe Cal!

Date: "06/26/97
Subject: Doug Horne Called Ben Hunter
Summary of the Call:

1 spoke briefly with Ben Hunter to say that the July 2, 1997 interview of Mr. McMahon had'’been :
cancelled (at his-Ben Hunter's--request) and that Mr. McMahon had rejected the tentative rescheduled
interview date of July 11 (for the same reason Hunter had been unavailable on July 2—vacation). | told
him there was no scheduled date now for our interview with Homer McMahon, and that my instructions
were to interview Homer McMahon as soon as practical, at a time convenient to Mr. McMahon. | told him
that if he (Ben Hunter) was available at that time, we would include him; otherwise, we would schedule a
second viewing of the briefing board panels for him subsequent to the McMahon interview.

Following discussion of these logistical details, Mr. Hunter said that he had been thinking about the
events at NPIC which he discussed with us, and wished to amend his previous comments as follows:

-He said he now recalls that a Secret Service agent did deliver the materials to NPIC;

-He said he now believes it was the Secret Service agent who said “don't discuss this with anyone,
and if people persist in knowing what you were doing, refer them to Captain Sands;"

-He said he now is fairly certain that Captain Sands was a high-ranking employee in NPIC's
management structure, possibly the second or third highest ranking member of the organization. He
does still recall that Sands was present during the NPIC event he discussed with ys--the manufacture of
internegatives and prints from-selected frames of the Zapruder film.

ARRB has requested information on former CIA employee, John Sands. He is reported to have been a Security Officer at NPIC in
November 1993 and may be familiar with the Zapruder film. Can we confirm that he was at NPIC in Nov. 1993? If so, the ARRB staff
will probably want to interview him and may request that we contact him. We need to know current address and cover status.

Barry: 1993 or 1963?

Topic: ARRB Interviewed Homer McMahon

Summary of the Meeting 00

ARRB staff followed up its June 9, 1997 telephonic initial assessment interview of Mr. McMahon with
an in-depth, in-person interview at Archives !I during which the original working notes from NPIC and a
surviving photographic briefing board could be used as exhibits to test the recollections of the witness.
The interview was audiotaped; therefore, this meeting report will only recount substantive highlights of the
interview. (All statements which read as if they were “facts" are actually Mr. McMahon's recounting of
events as he remembers them in 1997.)

Mr. McMahon was manager of the NPIC (National Photo Interpretation Center) color lab in 1963,
About two days after the assassination of President Kennedy, but before the funeral took place, a Secret
Service agent named "Bill Smith” delivered an amateur film of the assassination to NPIC and requested
that color prints be made of frames believed associated with wounding (“frames in which shots occurred"),
for purposes of assembling a briefing board. Mr. Smith did not explain who the briefing boards would be
for, or who would be briefed. The only persons who witnessed this activity (which McMahon described as
an "all night job") were USSS agent Smith, Homer McMahon, and Ben Hunter (McMahon's assistant).
Although no materials produced were stamped with classification markings, Smith told McMahon that the
subject matter was to be treated as “above top secret;" McMahon said that not even his supervisor was
allowed to know what he had worked on, nor was his supervisor allowed to participate. Smith told
McMahon that he had personally picked up the-film (in an undeveloped condition. from the man wha
exposed it) in Dallas, flown it to Rochester, N.Y. (where it was developed by Kodak), and then flown it
down to NPIC in Washington so that enlargements of selected frames could be made on NPIC's
state-of-the-art equipment. :

After the film (either an unslit original or possibly a duplicate) was viewed more than once on a 16 mm
projector in a briefing room at NPIC, the original (a double-8 mm unslit original) was placed in a 10X20X40
precision enlarger, and 5° X 7° format internegatives were made from selected frames. A full-immersion
“wet-gate" or liquid gate process was used on the original film to reduce refractivity of the film and
maximize the optical quality of the intemegatives. Subsequently, three each 5" X 7" contact prints were
made from the intemegatives. He recalled that a minimum of 20, and a maximum of 40 frames were
duplicated via internegatives and prints. All prints, intemegatives, and scraps were turned over to Bill
Smith at the conclusion of the work. Some working notes were created on a yellow legal pad, and they
were tumed over also. At the conclusion of the work, McMahon said he knew that briefing boards were
going to be constructed at NPIC from the prints, but he did not participate in that, and did not know who
did. McMahon stated definitively that at no point did NPIC reproduce the assassination movie (the
Zapruder film) as a motion picture; all NPIC did was produce internegatives and color prints of selected
still frames.

Although the process of selecting which frames depicted events surrounding the wounding of
limousine occupants (Kennedy and Connally) was a “joint process," McMahon said his opinion, which was
that President Kennedy was shot 6 to 8 times from at least three directions, was ultimately ignored, and
the opinion of USSS agent Smith, that there were 3 shots from behind from the Book Depository,


13-00000

ultimately was employed in selecting frames in the movie for reproduction. At one point he said “you can't
fight city hall," and then reminded us that his job was to produce intemegatives and photographs, not to do
analysis. He said that it was clear that the Secret Service agent had previously viewed the film and
already had opinions about which frames depicted woundings.

At one point in the interview, Mr. McMahon described in some detail various health-related memory
problems which he claims to suffer from. Details are on the tape.

Toward the end of the interview, McMahon was shown the NPIC working notes and the surviving
briefing board (there are four panels), which are both in the JFK Collection in flat # 90A.

NPIC Working Notes: McMahon recognized the half-sized sheet of yellow legal paper containing a
handwritten description of briefing board panel contents, and on its reverse side containing a description
of the work performed that night and how long each step took, as being written in his own handwriting
{and partially in Ben Hunter's). He said that three other full-length yellow legal pad pages of notes.

» (containing three possible 3-shot scenarios, a 16 FPS and 18 FPS timing analysis, and additional timing

computations) were not in his handwriting, and were not made by him or previously seen by him.

: McMahon looked at the 28 photographs on all four briefing board panels,
and said that he had made all of them; he also said that some were missing. !.asked him which types of
images that he had produced he thought were missing, and he said he thought motorcade images from
prior to frame 188 (i.e., earlier in the motorcade, before the limousine disappeared behind the’roadsign) °
were the photographs he produced which were not on the briefing board panels. He said it looked to him
like the prints he had produced had been trimmed, i.e., made smaller. END

MEMORANDUM

July 16, 1997

TO: David Marwell
Jeremy Gunn

FROM: Doug Horne

SUBJECT: Interviews With Former NPIC Employees About Their Involvement With
the Zapruder Film in November 1963

1. In June and July, 1997, through fortuitous circumstance, ARRB became cognizant of,
and was able to interview, both CIA NPIC (National Photographic Interpretation
Center) employees involved in 1963 with photographic reproduction of the Zapruder ~
film of President Kennedy’s assassination. [See attached interview reports with Ben
Hunter (dated 6/17/97 and 6/26/97), and with Homer McMahon (dated 6/12/97 and.
7/14/97).] As a result of these interviews, ARRB staff determined that the undated ~
NPIC working notes (see attached) which pertain to processing activity involving the
Zapruder film in 1963 have been misinterpreted by many researchers as indicating that
NPIC made three copies of the motion picture film for unknown reasons shortly after
the assassination. (I made this assumption myself, in memos dated October 18, 1995
and April 9, 1997.) Our interviews with Homer McMahon (NPIC color lab manager in
1963) and Ben Hunter (his assistant in 1963, and the only other NPIC employee present
during processing of the Zapruder film) in June and July of 1997 revealed that the
processing memorialized by the NPIC working notes (i.e.,.“shoot internegs...print test...make
three prints @") refers only to the reproduction of selected still frames as color prints, with the
manufacture of greatly magnified individual 8 mm movie frames as internegatives as the
intermediate step in this process. It is now clear that the NPIC working notes do not refer
to the reproduction of the Zapruder film as a motion picture, but rather, only to the
production of three sets each of 28 selected still frames for the purpose of making
briefing boards.

2. During our two interviews with Mr. McMahon, he remembered with great certainty
that the Secret Service agent who couriered the Zapruder film to NPIC told him that the
original film, and the duplicate movies struck from it, were all developed at Rochester,
N.Y. by Kodak. This, of course, is contrary to the existing documentary trail which
indicates otherwise—namely, that the original film and the three first generation copies
were all developed by Kodak in Dallas. (See my memo of April 9, 1997 for copies of the
affidavits executed by Abraham Zapruder, his letter to C.D. Jackson of LIFE, and Secret
Service documents which all indicate that the original film and three copies were

Horne e:\wp-docs\edgepmt.wpd

13-00000

2

developed in Dallas on November 22, 1963.) Nevertheless, Mr. McMahon’s memory of
this statement by the Secret Service agent is quite firm, so ARRB staff decided to re-
examine the edge print on the original Zapruder film and the two Secret Service copies
to see if there was any evidence present of developing in Rochester, vice Dallas. Mr.
Rollie Zavada, a former career employee with Kodak, provided me with a photographic
reproduction of what edge print would look like on an 8 mm film developed in
Rochester (see attached); using this example as a control, I visited Archives II today, and
assisted by Alan Lewis of NARA, examined the edge print on the original film and the

‘two Secret Service copies for any evidence of having been processed in Rochester.

Summarizing the results of my examination, I could find no.“R” for Rochester
anywhere on the edge print of either the original film, or the two Secret Service copies,
which are first generation. However, I did notice that both Secret service copies exhibit edge
print which reads as follows: “Processed by Kodak D Nov 63.” I presume that this capital
“D,” found in the edge print on the home movie portions of Secret Service copies 1 and
2, probably stands for “Dallas.” I will raise this question with Mr. Zavada of Kodak
(who is presently on vacation) next month. Thus, at the present time, there is no
physical or documentary evidence I am aware of which supports developing in
Rochester, and considerable documentary and some physical evidence which supports
developing of the original and first generation copies in Dallas.

3. The final three attachments to this memo are hand-drawn, detailed reproductions of
the edge print as observed by me today on the film designated as the original by
NARA, and Secret Service copies 1 and 2. Edge print observations made during past
examinations were not done with this degree of care, and were not memorialized with
this degree of precision.

Background and Questions for DI
DATE

ruder Film

In 1975, the CIA forwarded to the Rockefeller Commission undated internal working

notes from the'CIA‘s NPIC (National Photographic Interpretation Center) then under

the Directorate of Intelligence, which indicate that at one time, NPIC conducted an

analysis of the Zapruder film to determine which frames could be equated with JFKS>
gunshots, and how many seconds had elapsed between shots. A typewritten, undated aed
memo (presumably prepared on May 13, 1975), which forwarded these working papers { *~ x
within the agency, implies that the NPIC had performed the analysis at the request of

the U.S. Secret Service.

My analysis of the working notes from NPIC has led me to conclude that NPIC's work
was conducted approximately between December 6, and December 20, 1963. Reasoning
follows: the NPIC notes reference LIFE magazine's own analysis of the shots as one of

. the three scenarios they considered, and quote verbatim from LIFE's December 6, 1963
issue; furthermore, the NPIC analyst is not sure whether the Zapruder film was shot at
16 or 18 frames per second—and the FBI concluded on December 20, 1963 that the
operating speed of Zapruder's camera was an average of 18.3 frames per second. Thus,
it is reasonable to conclude that this analysis took place between the time the December
6, 1963 issue of LIFE hit the news stands, and December 20, 1963, the date the FBI
determined the operating speed of Zapruder's Bell and Howell camera.

QUESTIONS
The second-to-last page of the NPIC handwritten notes contains the following entries:

-Shoot Internegs 1.5 hr

-Print Test 1 hr

Re: Status of CIA Responses to Assassination Records Review Board’s Requests for
Additional Information and Records

Dear John:

Iam writing to follow-up on our telephone call earlier today and to convey my serious
. _ concern about the status of CIA’s responses to the Review Board's requests for
* additional information and records. Although CIA has completed its responses to
several requests, and many others have been answered in part, a significant number of
requests have not been answered — including some that were made more than two
years ago. On many occasions we have been assured that responses would be
forthcoming, only to have promised dates come and go without answers. It is now
extremely important that these requests be answered promptly so that we may conduct
a proper follow-up if necessary. The issues that we can now identify as being of the
highest priority are identified in the text below by double asterisks (**)' and we request
that they be answered within the next month. We request that the remaining requests
be answered by April 1, 1998.

The remainder of this letter is divided into two parts: first, a listing of the formal
requests for information and records, and second, a listing of the informal requests for
information and records. Please let me know if your understanding of any of the
following points differs from ours so that we can resolve any potential discrepancies.

‘As identified more fully below, the issues are: CLA-1 Organizational Material,
CIA-6 Cables and Dispatches, CIA-13 Backchannel Communications, CIA-IR-03
HTLINGUAL Documents, CIA-IR-04 Disposition of Angleton Files, CLA-IR-07 Claude

“*CIA-IR-22 “A” File on Clay Shaw and Jim Garrison.

In July 1997, the ARRB staff-was shown an “A” file on Clay Shaw which pre-
dated a 201 file. We were also told that an “A” file on Jim Garrison also existed.
The Shaw file was declared to be an assassination record and it was our
understanding that both files were to be sent to HRG for processing. We have
not yet received confirmation from HRG that the files are in process as
assassination records.

CIA-IR-23 Watch Committee Files.

In his memoirs, George Ball reports that upon first hearing of the shots in Dallas
he called DCI John McCone and asked him to activate the Watch Committee.
McCone replied that he already had. The Review Board requests the files of the
Watch Committee for the period January 1963-May 1964.

_CIA-IR-24 Defector File.
