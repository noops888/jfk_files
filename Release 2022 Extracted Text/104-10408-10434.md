ing Holland by rail at the Bentheim crossing point, She had

SUBJECT: Travel of Lee Harvey OSWALD

i, The following information hae been gathered from
reliable sources regarding the travel af Lee Harvey CSWALD
and his wife:

_ 9 October 1959: According to official

British travel records OSWALD arrived in

Southampton this date claiming on his landing card

that he had no fixed address but planned to remain >

in the United Kingdom one week for vacation before

going on to “some school" in Switzerland, (Head- |
“quarters comment: ‘Probably referring to the
Albert Schweitzer College in Switserland with which
he ig known to have been in correspondence.)

be. 10 October 1959: According to the same

official British travel records OSWALD left London
this date by air for Helainki, 201-237 242

©. October 1959: Stockhalm newspaper, Dagens
Nyheter, of 25 November 1963 states Lee OSWALD
passed through Sweden during October 1959. Article
also adde that OSWALD waa unsuccessful in obtaining
visa to the USSR in Helsinki which resulted in his
returning to Stockholm, Two days after he arrived in
‘Stockhobn OSWALD traveled directly to Moscow,
Concluding sentence of article states "This indicates
that the Russian Embassy (Stockholm) gave him a visa.”
According to a reliable source there was no record
that there was any request for a USSR visa processed
through normal channels for OSWALD at any time
daring 1959, and spurce indicated it was difficult to
sexplain how OSWALD:-might have received his:visa in
two days without going through normal channels, The
spnly conclusion which can‘be-drawn is that OSWALD
must have received his visa directly from the Soviet
‘Smbassy in Stockholm which occasionally is-done in
special cases, but the source had no evidence to confirm

this assumption,

at the Torni Hotel in Helsinki from 10 to 11 October and |

then moved to the Klaus Kurki Hotel where he stayed {

until 15 October, apparently waiting for a visa to be
issued him by the Soviet Consulate in Helsinki, He

€. 13 May 1962: According to a Dutch official
source, the Dutch Charge in Moscow issued a transit
visa to OSWALD's wife on 13 May 1962, Their records
reveal his wife was born on 17 July 1941 instead of
19 July 1942 and in Severodvinek instead of Minsk.
There is no record of her having actually transited
‘The Netherlands,

f, 1962: Official British records do not reflect
that OSWALD returned to the United States from the
USSR through the United Kingdom, However, if he
were merely transiting, it would not bave been
necessary for him to fill out a landing card, and
therefore there would be no record of his travel in
the official traffic index,

B- 1963: According to an extremely sensitive and
reliable source, on 23 Novernber Maria SNETHLAGE,
head of the "Werkgroup Informatie Cuba" (Workgroup
Information Cuba), told an employee of the Cuban
Embassy in The Hague that she was sure she had met
“that Mr, LEE ie Havana, who did the murder", She
described him as a-man.of.violence and entirely full of
hate and indicated that it was possible that this man had

been misused by a group, She said she had written to

"GIBSON" about the bad impression she had had of this

LEE, (Headquarters comment: Please refer to our
teletype Nos. 85182 and 85665 for additional information
on GIBSON,) Later, SNETHLAGE told Castro Cubans

4n The Hague that "Mr, LEE of the Fair Play for Cuba
Committee had been slandered and that it was another
person named Lee OSWALD who had done it, SNETHLAGE
eeemed to be glad to have heard this correct" version,
(Headquarters comment: Mr, LEE may be identical with
Vincent Theodore LEE who replaced Richard GISSON as

Hend of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee.)
