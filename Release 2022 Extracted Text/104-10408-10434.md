that he had no fixed address but planned to remain

going on to "some school" in Switzerland. (Head-

c. October 1959: Stockbalm newspaper, Dagens

Nybetes, of 25 November 1963 statea Leo OSWALD

passed through Swedes during October 195% Article

also adds that ONWALD was unsuccessial is obtaining

visa to the USSR in Helsinki which resuited in his

returzing to Stockholm. Two days after he arrived in

Stockhoirs OSWALD traveled directly to Moscow.

Concluding sentenco of article states "Thia indicates

that the Russian Embaasy (Stockholms) gave hita a viad. "

According to a reliablo source there was no record

that thero was any regusat for a USSA visa processed

through normal channele for OSWALD at any time

during 1959, and spurce indicated it was difficult to

explain how OSWAID might have received his visa in

two days without going through nor Inal channels. Tho

only conclusion which can be drawn is that OSWALD

must have received his visa directly from the Soviet

Embausy in Stockholm which occasionally in done in

special cases, but the source had no evidence to confirm

this assumptian.

do 10 to 15 October 1252: According to a very )

reliablo put atremely sonsitive pourer OSWALD stayed

at the Torni Hotel in Helsinki from 10 to 11 October and

then moved to the Klaus Kurki Hotel where he stayed

until 15 Octobex, apparently waiting for a visa to be

issued him by the Soviet Consulate la Helsinki, Fie

traveled to the USSR by train, crossing at Vairikiala on

15 October.

e. 13 May 1962: According to a Dutch official

source, the Dutch Charge in Moscow issued a transit

visa to OSWAiD's wile on 13 May 1962, Their records

rereal his wife was born on 17 July 1941 instead of

19 July 1941 and in Severodvinak instead of Minsk.

There is no record of her having actually transited

The Netherlands.

f. 1962: Official British records do not reflect

that OSWALD returned to the United States from the

USSR through the United Kingdom. However, li he

were merely transiting, it would not bave been

necessary for him to fill out a landing card, aud

therefore there would be no record of his travel in

the official trailic index.
