key man ("lleva la batuta al?i") and appears to be a convinced

Comunist, In the old days, before CASTRO, MIRABAL worked for

- the Sherwin Wiliians paint factory (L-9 thinks S-W in the States
must have a record on hin) which was located a short distance from

the plant owned by L-9's father,

Marlee

f_ Dra.*MACHAD? récently told L-9 thatXZGA was discourteous to her
when she first. arrived here but that he has softened up a bit re-
cently and now seems to "accept" her, She thinks this may be
because che lost two sons in the Revolution (no details given).
She corplained that LLAGOSTENA still doesn't accept her but JURRIN
seems to be coning around. (This may be the usual resentment caused
by a fenale ina responsidle executive position).

Ge Enbassy staff meetings are held every Saturday morning from 0900 on

go The _Ambassador-6aid at a recent staff meeting Shat he was taken
to task by a Mexican senator who asked him why Cuba refused to
sign the atom test ban pact. ARNIS ( he, like RO, is know by
his matrenymic) tried to explain that Cuba could never sign the
agreerent a3 long as she 1s the subject of American agression,
ARMAS said that Enbassy staff people should be prepared to answer
“such questions and nenticnod that-a request was being sent to
Havana to allow the expenditure of sufficient funds to print up
10,000 copies of Fidel CISTRO's speech of 28 September to be
distributed locally -- this specch aprarently conveys the present
"line" on the test ban issue,

k, Foreign !inister ROA recently mentioned in a note to ARMAS that
he is glad to hear that L-9 is painting again, U9 was, in turn,

ps Regarding gara*isy"Nv'7, Cata, now in Caracas, L-9 recently
carned that sonetine in the past when Sara was on-a Cubana
Plane at Noxico City, proparin; to depart for Havana, she made
: a few anti-Revolutionary ronarks. These were reported te :
~ ‘ — ~Orfila, who reported thon to Trrosa PROENZA, who reported to
ae ~~ _.Ramon SINOBAS (at the tine Charge et the Embassy), who fired =.
‘off a cable to MIWEX Havana. %hen Sara got to Havana she was
accused-of “intrigue.” Teresa PxOENZA recently told L-9 about.
~> this,. (REPORT TO CARICAS STATION).

Qe A Cuban functionary on his way to Uruguay from Havana had some
trouble with Nexican officials at tho Central Airport --a
: Cdte. VENTURA took some papers away from him vhen he arrived
2h October and as a result the Cuban was forced to cancel his
onvard reservations on Varig for the night of 25 October ~~ said
he could-not convlete his mission vithout his papers. (Reported this
to CASOT 26 Oct in case LIFIRES might be able to get hold of the
papers 4n questica). 2
pakGet ae mac
ry L-9 says that Dra, ici 100, her daughter feria, and Percerina_
YALONSO all live together near the Enbassy, (This may be in 157
Pachuca where the ANKKO3-1 safe site was located) L~9 will ask
Dra. MACHADO to have dinner with hin at his apartmmnt -- making
sure she 4s there well after nightfall so that he will be obliged
+ 9 | —. 0 see her safely hore and, in the progess, find. out where she

iy lives.

3. As usmal L-9 necded a bit of bolstering. Me said that he ferls intense
pressure at staff gathcrings vhen everyone locks at everyone clse present and
wonders "sho 4s the Judaa in this croup." L-9 stated that ho would much rather
do some other kind of work and would rather sell tomatcss on tho street than
do what he 1s doing now. ‘The thing that really keqps hin going, acide fron his
expressed regard for KUBARK and his oft-repeated affinity for the Anplo-Saxon,
is his sincere disgust with the C‘STXO regime. He again told the story ( B has
heard it a half-dozen tires and Shryock prombly heard it often before that) of
his fathor's having bullt up a big business hy unstinting hard work -- of having
brought his fanily up fron nothing to a position of honest respectability -- only
to be classified as a "bandido" ani “oxplotador" by a bunch of revolutionary buns
with beards, It is the case officer's belief that 1f L-9 did not hava a release
through painting he would break off from the Enbassy and, naturally, from KUBARKe
It 4s furthermore believed that if we wero to ask L-9 to submit to an LCFLUITER
exanination as Headqiarters has reemtly sucnested, L-9 would inncdiatoly break
contact with us as no matter how diploratically the build-up might ve phrased he
would take it aa a slur on his honor and we would be without a penetration into

the Enbassy.

“works very well -- he enerces as a dedicated, nore-or-less apolitical worker,

who 4s not going to take any foolishiess fron anyone who gets in his way, and

who, like many artists, may be just a bit wacky. He cleverly nanages to lose

his temper fron time to tine with good effect since no-one wants to-ruffle him

too much lest his well-known "pull” with Fidel might be enployeds

ozaling eight hours on the ‘nights of 29 May, 31 May and 1 June 1963.

2. Attachnent’B-ts largely positive. intelligence while Attachment C
is basically of operational interest, The intelligence debriefirg was
conducted on the basis of current and past intelligence requirements lists
available at the Mexico Station, To the extent feasible we attempted to -
pinpoint ultinate sources, but headquarters will note that a sizable part of
the information provided was based on personal observation and impressions,
Headquarters should keep in mind that 1-9's perimeter of access was the city
of Habara and that he was exposed prin¢ipally to bureaucrats Kho are identified
with the regime, We caution headquarters on this rather obvious point, per-
haps because we were exposed recently to AMKNOCK-1 who has been living deep
"in the entrails of the monster™ in Oriente and who had a different view of
the temper of the people in that area from that given by LITAMIL-9 for
Havana,

3. In attachment ¢ are the answers to a series of questions of operational
interest which were posed after a thorough review of the LITAYIL-9 operational
file. In some cases fuller biogrephic information can be ovtained from 1-9

° 4f and when required, L-9 was most cooperative and understood clearly what
the debriefer vas looking for, In most cases, however, it 18 not probable
that L-9 will be of great help in making operational approaches and pitches

1, Subject had nothing meaningful to-add on disaffections or

realignments as a-result of the October crisis.

2, With regard to internal friction within the GOC, he said that
there is considerable criticisn of the "old" C: ists by the "new" Commmists
and 26th of July, He cited the case of Felipe’ RA Matos! criticis of
Joaquin GRDOQUI and Nicolas GUILLEN (previously, reported) as cases in point,
By and large, the new Communists and Fidelistas are grabbing off most key
position in the government bureaucracy, Fidel Castro is still the principal
leader of the Revolution and both the PSP and the Soviets know that he is
vitally impostant to them, Source was told by his sister-in-law (Conchita)
that Fidel showed: some annoyance with Blas Roca ope,night when he phoned and
told Rene VALLEJO to tell tnat "son of a bitch” (ge de puta) to stop: bothering
him. Cpachita also says that Fidel 1s somewhat annoyed at his old crony Carlos
Rafael RODRIGUEZ because the zafra 15 proving to be such a bust and that
Pidel has ‘complained that Carios Rafael frequently doctors INRA statistics to
his own advantage, Despite these minor problems with xey,Commnist leaders,

fcca continues on friendly terms with the key members of the PSP, and Blas ;

Roca should be included with ‘Fidel, Raul and Che Guevara among the four most
powerful men in Cuba, Source commented that we mist understand the myth created
by the Revolution and its propaganda “in evaluating internal friction and
cleavages, Non-comiunist officials have been either brainwashed by propaganda,
are still blindly loyal to Fidel, or else have no place to co, Thus, in the
final analysis, the cleavages are superficial and of nc great moment, ———~

3. Source had no detail on the formation of the Partido Unico. He com-
mented that the PSP view PURS as an attempt by Fidel Castro to absorb it and
that the PSP consequently has deen cool to the idea,

“h, Subject was questioned on mass orgenizations in Cuba, but could
provide no information worth reporting.

5. Source was’ questioned on the positions of Lazaro Pena, Luzarde,
Ramiro VALDES and Juan-MARINELLO, fe had little cf importance thought he
commented that Fidel, according to Conchita, did rot hold Lazaro PENA in
high regard, Source had no information on NARINELLO's reported problems at
the University of Habana.

6. We covered the gamit on counter-revolutionary activities and other
types of resistance with disappointingly negative results,

7. In the military field (number of Soviet troops, training in both
Cuba and the Soviet Union, missile arrivals, hiding of military materiel in
eaves etc.) source could add nothing to the bolas which can be picked up on
Flagler Street in Miami.

He said that to his knowledge Soviet technicians were getting along
well with Cubans, but he feels that the Cuban people view the Soviet with
detachment socially:and have very little to do with them,

10, ‘Source was queried on any comments he had heard concerning a
GoC desire for a rapproachenent with the United States, He said that
he Had heard nothing specific, but that he personally felt this was a
prospect’ frequently considered by Castro,

11, In view of Sources excellent sub-source in INRA (Conchita), it had
been hoped tha: he would be able to provide some valuable information on
this organization, Actually, he had little to add to Conchita's comments in
regard to Fidel's attitude toward Carlos Rafael Rodriguez, We asked for |
Conchita's evaluation of Carlos Rafael, and received information which has
many times beer forwarded to headquarters and need not be repeated here,
Conchita made no seaningful comments on the effectiveness of Soviet and
Satellite technicians assiged to INRA, (See also paragraph 5 of attachment
B concerning Fidel Castro which may be of PI interest.)

212, When esked about the principal reasons for industrial difficulties,
Source said that he heard universal complaints about the need for spare parts,
He could only pinpoint the transport ancustry, He had no specific information
on how some U.S, zanufactured spare parts were being received, but commented
that Canada might be the source, He could give no specifics and said that
all correspondence cn these matters is closely.held and encoded when cabled,
He has had no access to such information,

13. Regarding the rationing system, he said that it 1s working more

-smoothly now than @ year ago and that erumbling is less now than in the

past, He said thet things are better organized now and that he saw no desper-
ation because of food or other shortages,

14, Source sa‘d that he had heard of no significant increase in diseases,
though there was ich cosrent about cases of gastroenteritis,

15. Source had no information whatever on the export of the Cuban
Revolution and on the training of revolutionaries from other areas in Cuba.

16, Regarding ¢iplocatic relations with other Latin American countries
and Spain, his understanding 1s that the GOC wants no more breaks and is
especially interested in maintaining the tie with Madrid since Spain 1s the
other country and an airline link to Europe,

loyalty, and-efficiency of the services, He said that loyalty is increasing,

quality is.circumscribed sericusly by insufficient academic preparation and

job training and efficiency’has increased in the past year because of better

discipline and improved administrative practices,

18, Subject had nothing of consequence to add regarding the. organization
of the Ministry of Foreign Relation and the Foreign Service, This subject
will be covered to some extent in the operational attachment to this dispatch,
See paragraph 7 of attachment B concerning the ruror that Armando }*RART will
replace Raul ROA at MINREX,

19, Source had little information on the Church, He said that the
» Catholic Church is not being molested end that relations between it and
the GOC have improved., Pope John XXIII was viewed with favor by the GOC.
(Note: Batistianos in Miami frequently taxe che opposite view.)

20. Source had nothing of value.on the Ministry of Education, the
University of Habana, the literacy program, the establishment of new technical
and scientific institutes, the quality of education at secondary and primary . :

levels,

21, Regarding the United States, he"feels that there is still a furd
: of friendship among the Cuban people and admiration of american technology.
. He said that-a few of his friends listen to U.S, broadessts, but he had
i nothing to say concerning their comments and the extent to which these broad-
casts are having an effect,

22, Regarding the temper of the Cuban people, source does not believe
1 that the ingredients for a revolt exict, He feels that the regime may have
more support now than it had a year ago, or, if such is not the case, that

people are just more resigned to it,

4, Source had inet Jose "Pepin *NARANJO when he came to Mexico with

Blas Roca, but he had little of operational interest to add concerning him. He
said that NARANJO struck him as wily; sharp, but intellectimlly quite superficial.

& 5. We questioned source goncerning Conchita's impressions of Antonio

MUNBZ Jimenez, anid Carlos Raféel *RODRIGUEZ, and nothing of value resulted (see
attachment B for some cotmenté on the position of the latter). Conchita did have
an interesting comment concerning Fidel CASTRO's health. Apparently he has not
fully recovered from a father serious pulmonary illness and she said that he 1s
much less robust than he ised to be. (Attention is drawn to this paragraph in

6. Orlando #SANCHEZ = He 1s the brother of cella SANCHEZ, aud L-9 believes

that he is disaffected with the regime and 4s anti-Communist. SANCHEZ is about

is now in charze of the "Seccion X" store on O'Reilly Street in Habana. His wife,
whose nane escaped L-9, 1s an American and probably of Puerto Rican extraction.
They have at least one child. L-9 feels that there is very little chance that
SANCHEZ 1s recruitable and he dves not believe that he would use Celia for intelli-
gence purposes in any case. As Headquarters knows, L-9 has extended en invitation

© SANCHEZ to visit him in Mexico. We could, perhaps, push this, but the chances
of successfully recruitin: hin in Mexico, according to L-9, would be small. 1-9
said that a sister of Celia, vhon L-9 described as being in her tventles and
married to a formerly vealthy nan from Orfente whose holdings hed been confiscated,
was acainst the regime ard was about to leave Cuba for Miami with her husband.

L-9 did not know the sister's nane.

T- The writer,asked L-9 vhether he had any contact with Eaydee SANTAMARIA
or her spouse, Arnando‘*fAR? Davalos, during his visit, and he said that he had not.
Ee said that it was widely rumored around the Foreign Ministry that Hart misht

12. LIOOZB-1 - L-9 said IL-1 is assigned to protocol in the Foreign Mints-

L-1 has er!ticized extreniss in the regine, 1s pro-R0A, apparently stroncly dis-

further inforcation that is not already a catter of record.

J ad 13. Rant SDEL RIO - He is about 28, weat about half way throu:h medical
school at the University of Habana, is rather short, vell-preportioned, and svoors
bit when he walks, He is probably 3-2 and is assigned to the Consejo Nacional

* | de Cultura. He is a protese of the Consejo's d{rectress, Edith!*cARCIA Suchaca
(see 14 below). 1-9 believes DEL RIO is a strong Fidelista and not a recruitnent

candidate.



“Buchaca aad the Conejo Hactonal de Cultura - GARCIA,
6 ‘trying to place Commnists and extreuists in‘és-many

cultural: slots ‘ae’ rach able ‘Cuban embassies. She is 45-47, a light milatto,-

abort 63-64 inches tall, fairly well proportioned, and an indefatigable vorker.
The Consejo is now located in the Ayuttemieato de Mariano ard has a steff of
-ebout 25 at headquarters. L-9 does -not know of. any clandestine activities 1a which
the Corisejo may be engaged and considers. it basicallya cultural organization. In
‘aadttipn to GARCIA and’ DEL,RIO, 1-9’ recall the nanes of the folloving personnel:
Karta @aRAJONA (plastic arts), Maritza VALONSO (recites poetry). He said that the
Consejo. 1s interested primarily in fostering art ezhibitions, many of vhich are
teplayed abroad. He mentioned Aracio*VANECAS Arroyo, a Hexican employed by the
Gonsesor as a contact, but VANECAS appears to be a strong Castrista. Vanegas :

is 30-34, about 65 inches, well-built, married to a Cuban and a good friend of
Raul Castro. L-9 could come up with no realistic penetration prospects in the
Consejo.

15. Guillermo *GUERRA Matos - L-9 had nothing to add to what has already

been reported. L-9 does not~know GUERRA personally.
—

~ 16. Petre *2A12EGA3 de PEDROSO - Her husband, Regino *PEDROSO, is a poet
of: some stature and Cuban Charge in Peking. L-9 does not know vhether Regino is
2.Commmist, but he knows that he was at one tine arrested for being one. Petra
and Regino have no children. She is middleaze and ia separated from Regino to
collect her benefits in Habana as & retired teacher. She is related to the
Commmist poet, Nicolas GUILLEN. L-9 views Regino as a very slippery article and
did not have any recommendations ccacerning an operational approach. In any case,
there is no real reason to believe that either Petra or Regino would be susceptible

to a pitch.

17. L-9 had nothing to ada to vhat slready has been reported concerning
AMIEO-3 and his fantly.

185 He had nothing 1 new on Crlando' *PATOJA Tamayo, previously reported to

. be en inspector for Ramiro Valdes.

19. L-9 was questicned about the BAYO brothers (Armando and Alberto BAYO
Coscaya), old man BAYO (Sen. Alberto BAYO Ciroud) and General Enrique Lister. The
only comments he had to-make vere thatthe 2AY0s are all helieved to be pro-
regime and that the old man is of no simificance in Cuban affairs. He knew nothing

about Lister.

20, The subject of Conchita, vhich has already been mentioned elsevhere in
this debriefins, vas discussed at lencth with L-9.° Nothing of operational interest
that has not already been reported by the Hexico Station emerged from this discus-
sion. Conchita is still loyal to Figel and L-9 could susgest no workable operational

approach to her.



Siteteeaneceiicaiceeen + Pe Rede Depestre - Source hed.no information of use.

: 22, L-9-Wad quedtioned abcut rumors of Castro penetration of KUBARK
that be had heard during hisvisit, but he could provide no specifics. He gave - .
no’ infomation. on Cuban intelligence activities that 1s not already a matter of

record,

23. Agustin Boar = Nothing new to add except that 1-9 considers this

Vhile he rejected Grovery's pitch, he did so graciously and told J-9 that Crovery
impressed him favorably, While the writer cannot suggest an approach to Alfredo,
it is felt that at this time such attenbts as may be made. to develop him should be
channeled through someone other than his brother. :

LITAMIL-9 said that WOOLRICH was shrewddnd "sneaky", he did not like

his attitude. He appeared to be a person of "confidence", i.e. of
- the Cuban Embassy. WOOLRICH said he had a Cuban visa. WOOLRICH showed
uarscseee 1-9 a letter which he received from Havana several moths ago because
according to WOOLRICH the meeting was scheduled for the end of last
year. WOOLRICH pointed out that the paper was outdated and sucgested
‘that 4t be returned to Hevana and anew one sent to WOOIRICH. The ;
letter provided spaces to fill in by WOOLRICH of the doctors who would
“be going. WOOLRICH told L_9 that he had about five in mind,that some
of those who were going have changed their minds, WOOLIRHC eaid that
Dr. Clenente ROBLES was now vacillating and ke did not know whééhar he
was going to go. I-9 told WOOLRICH he would send the latter soonest
