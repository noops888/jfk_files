The questioning goes as follows: "What instructions were

you given by Mr. Bissell at the meeting?"

Answer, from Mr. Halpern. "MI. Bissell said that he had

recently, and he didn't specify the date or the time, he had

recently been chewed out in the Cabinet Room in the White House

by both the President and the Attorney General for, as he put it,

sitting on his ass and not doing anything about getting rid of

Castro and the Castro regime.. His orders to both Me, Zogby and

to me were to plan for an operation to accomplish that end."

Then at page 36 and 37, Mr. Smothers returned to the same

meeting. Mr. Smothers, at page 37, asked the question of Mr.

Halpern as follows:

Question, "Let me ask you it another way. What was your

understanding of what Mr. Bissell had been told to do by the

President and the Attorney General?"

Answer, "To get rid of Castro and the Castro regime on the

island of Cuba."

Now, in substance, did you have such a conversation with

Mr. Halpern?

Mr. Bissell. I assume his testimony is correct. I don't

happen to remember the meeting.

Mr. Schwarz.. All right.

And did you have some conversation with the President and

the Attorney General in which they told you in effect, in

SUBJECT:

Question 3 of. 4 Questions Developed during SSC

Hearing of MI. Richard Bissell on 12. June 1975:

"A CIA cable (OUT 51708, dated I May 1961)

contains a paragraph that certain informa-

tion from another cable or report was to

be withheld from the Department of State.

The Committee question is, What is it that

was to be withheld?

Why?

Ias it actually

withheld and for how long?"

RESPONSE TO QUESTION 3:

This answer is based on our assumption that the

Committee's query concerns paragraph tio, OUT 51708.

The

background is this. Consul General Dearborn had instructed

the Chief of Station to determine from CIA whether or not

detailed information on plans of the dissidents to undertake

the assassination of Trujillo which the Consul General

had

acquired and reported

to CIA (IN 44067, 30 April 1961) had

been given to the Department of State. CIA Headquarters.

replied (OUT 51708) that the substantive intelligence .con-

cerning the plans and identities of those who, according

to the report, would participate had been passed to ithe

Department of Stateron 1 May 1961.

In its Ieply (OUT 51708), CIA Headquarters appended

as paragraph two a query of its own. With parenthetical

ed to permit easier understanding,

It was:

" (Mr. John Barfield,.

a Foreign Service Officer

who was then assigned to the Consulate), is now

HeS AREA (meaning in. Washington, D.C.).* PLEASE

ADVISE PRIORITY IF. HE WITTING (that M. 3 sub-

machine guns)

POUCHED. TO STATION AND IF HE AWARE

THIS MATTER NOT TO BE DISCUSSED WITH THE DEPART-

MENT OF STATE."

The Chief of Station replied (IN 44957, 2 May 1961).

that Consul General Dearborn had informed him that Mr. Barfield

was aware of the presence in the Consulate of the submachine

guns but that the Consul General, in a note sent via another

Consulate employee who was traveling to washington at the

same time, had asked Mr. Barfield not to talk about them to

Department of State personnel unless queried (presumably by

authorized officials.

The cable included the suggestion

that CIA Headquarters ask MI. Barfield to plead ignorance if

asked about the presence of the submachine guns and to refer

any inquiries in the Department of State to CIA.

The exchange evidently reflected

the intent of Consul

General Dearborn - and CIA Headquarters - to limit knowledge-

ability of sensitive details to those officials of the Depart-

ment of State who were already aware.. It is noted that Mr.

Barfield was in 126l the target of tendentious regime-inspired

radio 'commentary in the Dominican Republic. Further allega-

tions could have impaired. his ability to serve in that

country.

Mr. Schwarz. There's one case officer I think we need for

about twenty minutss on the Cubella thing, and I think his name

is Nesto

Sanche

Senator Schweiker. I don't think that was the name.

The Chairman. Well, let's see if we can get Sanchez and

then there was Bedro, San Juan who can be deposed.

It is

a very

small item, but we should track it down.

If there are any other loose ends, let's tie them up just

as quickly as we can.

Mr. Smothers. Senator, we are now trying to track down

the other addressees on the 13 August memorandum. We have

heard from three of them, and one of them is the Ambassador to

Santo Domingo, and we are sending written interrogatories.

Another one, Mr. Wilson, is in today, and we have still another

one who is in South Carolina, and we will be talking with him.

After some further inquiry, it may be necessary, we will

probably have to make a decision whether we will need to talk

to General Lansdale again. I believe we are already planning

for Mr. Maheu and if we are, we should certainly have that

picture clear in about another week.

The Chairman. Last night, Senator Tower and I met with

the leadership relative to the problem that the Committee faces

with finishing up its work on the assassination issue. It was

the strong feeling of the leadership that the Committee should

issue a united report and that we should make every effort to

Mr. Bissell. Well, Ray Kline, at that time, I think was

the Station Chief in Taiwan. Roberts was a Marine, a retired

Marine officer who was involved in the Bay of Pigs operation.

The Chairman. Well, wasn't the other man then brought

over to also be in this project as well? He was, initially.

Mr. Bissell. I don't believe Mr. Kline was ever involved

in it. I could be wrong about that, but I am almost certain

that he was not.

Senator Schweiker. Mr. Chairman, I would like to read

the whole paragraph so that nobody accuses me of excerpting

part or parcel of the paragraph. It tells a package, but it

has some names I'd like to ask the witness about. It says,

"Whether or not the zealots received direct orders from the

President or the Attorney General, they did receive orders to

eliminate Castro from power in Cuba. The secret war was

result of that policy, and Castro's assassination, if not

specified, was a logical objective of that war.

Acting on the

President's authority, JMWAVE trained several thousand Cubans

in geurrilla tactics, armed then with weapons and explosives

20. and sent them down to the Caribbean with hopes of glory. -All

21

22

of them sought to end Castro's hold on Cuba, and many of them

made attempts on Castro's life in the impromptu tradition in

23

the attack on the Laquina Hotel which is referred to above.

Mr. Dennin. • Now, in Paragraph 2 of the same memorandum,

it is stated that these arms would presumably be used against

key members of the Trujillo regime?

Mr. Bissell. That's right.

Mr. Dennin. That's the last sentence of Paragraph 2.

And you are aware, are you not, sir, that this memorandum was

concuried in by your deputy that would be at the time Mr. Helms,

where it says, concurred, Deputy Director of Plans? And from

your review of the IG report, I take it that you did not concur

in it, but that Mr. Helms did in your absence?

Mr. Bissell. I believe that is the case. This copy

doesn't show it.

Mr. Dennin. We have requested, and I heard again on this

from Mr. Elder yesterday, that there is no copy extant which

would show who actually signed, on behalf of the Chief, Western

Hemisphere Division, and I can 'inform you sir, that i

that was not again, according to the IG report, Colonel King,

but apparently in his absence, his deputy, Mr. Gomez,& was not

you as DDP, but it was

your deputy who concurred in that, and

further that it was not the Director of Central Intelligence

which approved it, but his Deputy, at the time General Cabell.

Mr. Bissell. Right.

Mr. Dennin. Everybody was apparently out of town at that

particular point.

Mr. Bissell. Correct.

Mr. Dennin. And the C/CA, that was the individual in the

office charged with what?

MI. Bissell. Covert action.

MI. Dennin. Specifically that would include provision of

things and getting advice on things like placing bombs?

Mr. Bissell. I suppose it would, although most of its

efforts had to do with political action.

Mr. Dennin. Turning to Tab K, that being a memorandum for

the record of the February 15 meeting in New York, the memorandum

of February 16, you will note on page 5 that

that memoranda

describes a meeting held between the Chief, WH3, that branch

of the CIA having direct line responsibility for the Dominican

Republic.

see that, sir?

Mr. Bissell. Yes,

I do.

MI. Dennin. Now let me point out a couple of things

raised in this memorandum. Once again there is very specific

discussion of assassination, a method of assassinating Mr.

Trujillo which is discussed as using a powerful bomb. A

further method is putting poison in Trujillo's food or alter-

natively in his medicine, and finally, possible methods of

delivering arms and materials to the dissidents are discussed.

Specifically at the end of

that Paragraph 3 you will note that

Holmant reports that EMDECK turned his attention away from arms

and started talking about delivery of other types of materials,

exotic materials, powerful bombs.

Mr. Bissell. I am not finding that particular paragraph.

Mr. Dennin. Say the beginning of Paragraph 4. Let me

just read you the first sentence of Paragraph 4.

"OMDECK 4) said the object of obtaining this kind of help

anyway is the elimination of Trujillo and instead of using

arms or grenades, he began to speak of more exotic materials

and methods." And then it goes on to talk about the powerful

bomb that could be planted along the route of Trujillo's

evening walk.

Do you see that, sir?

Mr. Bissell. Yes, I do.

Mr. Dennin. Would you agrse with me that there is no

question whatsoever that based upon this memorandum for the

record, if it accurately describes the conversation which the

Chief of the Western Hemisphere Division-3 participated, that

assassination was being discussed, that it was being discussed

in a very specific sense, and

that it was made perfectly clear,

as the first sentence in Paragraph 4 indicates, that the purpose

to which the exotic materials sought by the dissidents would be

put was the assassination of Mr. Trujillo?

Mr. Bissell. I do.

Mr. Dennin. Xwould you feel that this memorandum would have

come to your attention, either directly from Me Holman,

from his immediate superior, Colonel King?

Mr. Bissell. would guess this of a summary, and

conceivably it could have come to my attention, again in the

form of an outgoing cable or something of that sort. (96) X

Mr. Dennin. Now having taken some time to go over this,

sir, and the reason I do, I would like you now to turn to and

consider the memorandum from you which is under Exhibit I

in the Senator's bill -- and Curt, you have in your book, on

top of that, the minutes of this Special Group meeting, on

February 14th, '61.

The Chairman. Why didn't you include that in the memor

andum?

A

Mr. Bissell. I cannot tell you, Mr. Chairman. I do not

remember what considerations moved me. I don't know whether

it was because this was common knowledge and it seemed to me

unnecessary to include it, or as you are implying, there was

an element of concealment here. I would be very surprised if

it were the latter, in this case. (10s) A

MI. Kirbow. Mr. Chairman, if Counsel will

yield? Since

I was originally asked to join Counsel to do work up on the

Trujillo program, and I think he knows this too, it appears in

the record before the Committee out of the '67 Inspector

General's report and all of the cable traffic which was directed

from the Consul General to the State Department through the

CIA channels. that this plan of the high explosive device was

transmitted to Consul General Dearborn, the Station Chief,

promptly classified it as an insane idea, which, if they try

to do this, because of the heavy guard, they're going to all

get themselves killed.

And it would appear to me that if that transpired before

the memorandum, the memorandum standing on its own looks very

bad, but with this other information having been tranzmitted

back to the Dominican Republic that it was a foolish plan, it

would appear that there was no plan that they thought was

workable in the United States government.

Mr. Dennin. Among other things, that advises -- well,

that our position, our being the Agency, is that you should

attempt to avoid precipitous action by the intornal dissidents

to the opposition groups until headquarters, by that you mean

CIA headquarters, are better prepared to support assassination

and assassination is added in, I believe the original word is

the code,

LEMSLEW

vertect a

change in the regime and to cope

with the aftermath.

On page 2, it indicates that "Headquarters

is prepared to

take the following actions: deliver machine guns and ammunition,

as soon as the capability to receive those was developed". and it

it

was always the understanding and knowledge of Headquarters

that time and specifically your understanding and knowledge when

you received and reviewed this cable, that those sought after

machine guns were to be used specifically in connection with

an assassination attempt on Trujillo, wasn't that so?

MI. Bissell. It probably was. I don't remember whether

there was any other use, possible use of tham, but I'm going

to let that stand. (107) B

MI. Dennin. Well, going back to just those, there is no

doubt on that, to the document at Tab M, M as in Mary -

DOf CIA came in. A local group in the Don-

inican government wishes to overthrow Trujillo; wishes arms for

that puipose.

On cross-examination it developed that the real plan

was

to assassinate Trujillo and they wanted guns for that purpose.

Herber

wanted to know what the policy should be.

I told him I could not care less for Trujillo and

that this was the general sentiment. But we did not wish to have

anything to do with any assassination plots anywhere, any time.

Herbert said he felt

the same way

RESPONSE TO QUESTION 1:

No specific documentation to show that the Department

of

State or the Special Group approved the transfer of three

carbines to dissidents in the Dominican Republic has been

located. It is possible that approval was considered implicit

in the 12 January 1961 Special Group decision that limited

supplies of small arms and other material should be made

available for dissidents inside the Dominican Republic, in

consonance with the feeling of the Department of State,

as

expressed by its representative at the 12 January meeting.

In this context, we note that. CIA Headquarters instructed

the chie

Of Station to obtain Consul General Dearborn's

concurrence in the passage of the three carbines.

the

Chief ofustation

plied that the. Consul General concurred.

Pertinent messages are OUT 89222, 29 March 1961 and. IN

28146, 31 March. 1961. Both have been made available to

the

Committee.
