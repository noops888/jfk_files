DETAILS
At New Haven, Connecticut

EXISTENCE - ORGANIZATION AND LEADERSHIP

During the past six month period, investigation in the New
Haven, Connecticut area has failed to reveal that there is in
a particular La Cosa Nostra "family" in Connecticut, although
investigation indicates that individuals who will be named
later in this report have definite associations or tie-ins
with certain New York "families", which are in the framework

So far as leadership is concerned, it cannot be determined
that any one individual, who is reliably reported to be a :
member of a particular New York "family", has-direct control i
over other Connecticut La Cosa Nostra members. It does '
appear that members in Connecticut are largely concerned

with illegal gambling activities, from which they derive

their largest income.

RALPH "WHITEY" TROPIANO
MEMBERSHIP

It has been reported by reliable New York sources, and other
sources in New Haven, Connecticut considered reliable, that
TROPIANO is a member of the JOSEPH ANTHONY COLOMBO "family",
formerly headed by the late JOSEPH PROFACI.

Also reliably reported by New York as a member of the. same
organization is GEORGE TROPIANO, brother of RALPH TROPIANO,
residing in the Brooklyn, New York area.

During the past pertinent period, NH T-1 and NH T-2 both
have reported RALPH TROPIANO to be a member of the late JOSEPH
PROFACI "family".

On June 17, 1964, NH T-2, when questioned as to TROPIANO's
activities, advised that he had heard from underworld contacts
that the late JOSEPH PROFACI. was the boss of TROPIANO. He also
remarked that not being Italian himself (NH T-2 is of German
