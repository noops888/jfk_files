I to 9:

CCS recommends deletion of that part of the last sentence, following

the semi-colonnof the first paragraph on page 10 of Chapter Al, which 94

identifies

as the site of Agency training courses. L

is an Agency training installation

and while its CIA

affiliation has been alleged numerous times in the press, no confirmation

of this affiliation has been made by the Agency. Mr. Phillips'

comments

as a former senior Agency officer can be interpreted as constituting

official acknowledgement of the CIA

relationship.
