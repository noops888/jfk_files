of several points she asked for a copy of a cable found in the
file that lists the chronology of the contacts with the two
ladies. That copy was provided via FAX on the same day.

5. .Susan) told me that IP&CRD has recommended that we, ie,
CIA, request Ms. Naman to submit a formal FOIA request for the
photos. The file review suggests to her, however, that a
letter telling Ms. Naman that CIA's record indicates the photos
had been returned, may be more politic. Evidently (Susan) wants
to talk to (Page Moffitt) DD/OCA, about the request so the
response is still undecided. I told her that I was returning
the file folder to the file but that I could retrieve it again
if necessary. It -could be that they will want to review the
file folder for themselves. More to come?

6. Copies of Representative Lagomarsino's letter and the
CIA cable noted previously are attached for information.

Dear Bob:

It has been many years now since I first shook your hand when you
-were originally running for office and 1 met you -_ the cattle
auction yard in Buellton,

I have appreciated your keeping me informed via your newsletter
but am enclosing 3 envelopes showing duplication of two, which
are ineorrect. I have marked them VOID and theproper one to use.

You have always responded to me when I have asked you or been
concerned about anything. I am troubled by many things today but
at the top of my list is the ENVIRONMENT and costly and wasteful

$ Grants (our taxpayer money) given to unethical people for EXPERIMENTS
ON ANIMALS. TI-even got a‘ letter from Casper Weinberger saying the
D.O.D. felt it was necessary for the protection of the United States
for the military to ‘shoot, maim, and kill animals ~ even dogs.

Oh now REALLY!! Come on. Lets get all this craziness and waste
stopped. We have enough injured real bodies around without animal testing.

The other item that has been renewed for me is all the recent interest

in the JFK Assasination. You might remember that as a-plain old tourist

I took a picture in Minsk where later we found Lee Harvey Oswald to be

in the picture. I was glad to give this to the CIA with the understanding
they would return my slide together with 3 blowups 8 x 10 color.

of the Warren Commission Assasination Book

My picture is on Page 4 2B

To this day my efforts and yours have been unsuccessful. You tried
through the FBI, which was an error on:the part of you or your office
= I had said it waa the CIA who interviewed me and to whom I entrusted
my picture. If you did contact the CIA I never did hear from them.
The FBI did respond but merely said they knew nothing about it,

I would still like to have my colored slide back, together with the

3 color 8 x 10 they Promised me. Would you please try again, -but be
sure its the CIA.

Probably because of this picture there must be some sort of a file on
me; so would you kindly arrange for me to have my file through the
Freedom of Information Act. om

Thank you kindly,

“bea | lamnean,

‘Muffington is a threat, but I am telling people how responsive you have
ways heen to ome, and YOU DO PROPEOT OUR ENVIRONMENT, )

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

FROM: (Gloria Boyd? HRG

SUBJECT: Request for Information from the Oswald 201 File to
Support an OCA FOIA Request

1. On Wednesday, 20 May 1992, Susan McMains7 the OCA FOIA
Officer, asked for my help in servicing a request from
Representative Lagomarsino on behalf of one of his
constituents, Ms. Rita Naman. The request was for the return
of a slide and some photographs that were provided in the
Oswald investigation in 1962. As those files are now in the
possession of HRG(Susan/called to ask our help: I became the
HRG contact only because she and I were conferring on another
subject when the request came in and she used one telephone
call to accomplish a double mission.

2. As luck would have it Barry had found an index of some
items in the 201 File that listed a "Photo of OSWALD in
Minsk." A short search located the file folder; VOLUME 35,
BULKY, XAAZ 22420, 29 Apr 64, SR/CI Study: Photo of OSWALD in
Minsk, in Box #9. The folder contains a collection of MFRs,
documents, notes and photographs regarding the acquisition of
some photographs and a movie reel from 2 women that had been
traveling in the USSR in 1961. Ms Naman was identified as one
of the travelers. Also included in the folder were 2 slides.

3. According to the file record the movie reel that was
provided by Ms. Naman was returned to her by mail in March
1962. The slides provided by Ms. Kramer, the other traveler,
were also returned in May of that year. The record notes in
addition that five slides of the 160 provided (presumably by
Ms. Kramer) were “accessioned."

NOTE: "“accessioned" means that they were added to
the photographic collection of the Graphics Register.
The Graphics collection was split with the ground
photos going to NPIC and the personality photos going
to the area divisions of OCR/ISG. Keeping up with
organizational shifts these personality photos should
now be in LDA files? - that is if they haven't been
purged.

4. After conferring with Mr. Pereira, C/HRG and Mr.
Carver, HRG, on Friday, 22 May 1992, I called Gusan) with the
search results on Tuesday, 26 May 1992. Following disscussion
