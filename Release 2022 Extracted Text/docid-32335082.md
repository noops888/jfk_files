A review of the files of the Miami Office re-
flected that by Bureau letter 4/28/61 to the New York
Office, under the caption FPCC, the Bureau forwarded a
letter dated 4/12/61 which was received from CIA. The
CIA‘letter was classified SECRET. The CIA letter stated
a fairly reliable source, not further identified, made-
available-a membership list of the FPCC, Thé CIA source
did not state where or how he obtained the list. A com-
parison of the CIA list and the one forwarded as an
attachment to’ the ref ced communication, reflected

_ they were identical | u

The above referred to lists, however, are not
membership’ lists of the FPCC but rather a list of indi-
viduals who-made a trip to Cuba in December, 1960 under
the sponsorship of the FPCC, |
