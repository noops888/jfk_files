MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Relations with Manolo RAY and the MRP

1. For background see my memorandum of 12 May 1961, reporting on

my long session with Manolo RAY, Rogelio CISNEROS (Eugenio) and Ernesto

BETANCOURT. As will be noted in that memorandum, Manolo promised to

come up with a prospectus within approximately ten days' time, after con-

sulting with his leaders in Cuba.

2. On l June 1961 Mr. Barnes called me to say that Mr. Goodwin had

been visited by Mr. Ernesto BETANCOURT who asked for immediate financial

support for certain activities of the MRP which would run around $10, 000 bed

dollars.

Mr. Barnes asked me to contact BETANCOURT for the purpose of

ascertaining what the funds were to be used for, exactly how much needed, etc.:

I called BETANCOURT and he told me that I should get these details from

CISNEROS (Eugenio), who was staying at room 549 at the Washingion Hotel.

• I called Eugenio and made a date for me and Ray DuBois (Ray Adamo in the ira

name he uses with Ray and Cisneros) to call upon him.

We called on CISNEROS

at approximately 1845 hours 1 Jure, "and he Informed us that he had urgent

need for pesos for use in support of his sabotage and underground activities..

In Cuba, He said his people were absolutely without funde, needed money for

living expenses, transportation, purchase of sabotage equipment, air fares for

couriers, and for assisting people to get out of prison. He said that it was

now possible for people to biry thelr way out of prison by bribing one of the

many "communist" lawyers and judges. He thought that 40, 000 or 50, 000 pesos?

3. We made no commitment to Eugenio other than to say that we would

pass his plea along to the interested people. I reminded him that we had asked

him and Manolo to prepare à plan for consideration and that we were Stilf.

waiting for that plan, I said I personally doubted that anything could be done

until the plan was received from RAY. He said Manolo was planning to come to

Washington on the afternoon of 2 June with the plan, but that he himself was

having to return to Miami immediately and it was vital he be able to take the

money with him, arrange in Miami for purchase of the pesos (at rate of 4'x'1-

things stood.

I discussed our meeting with CISNEROS with Iracy Barnes on the

morning of 2 June. It was Tracy'e opition, in whick I leastily concur, that

we should put out no money whatsoever until we hare bad a chance so examine

support to the RAY group. I am nos arguing agains: providing such support.
