1, For background see my memorandum of 12 May 1961, reporting on
my long session with Manolo RAY, Rogelio CISNEROS (Eugenio) and Ernesto
BETANCOURT. As will be noted in that memorandum, Manolo promised to
come up with a prospectus within approximately ten days' time, after con-
sulting with his leaders in Cuba,

2, On1 June 1961 Mr, Barnes called me to eay that Mr. Goodwin had
been visited by Mr. Ernesto BETANCOURT who asked for immediate fine
support for certain activities ofthe MRP which would run around $10, 00
dollars. Mr. Barnes asked me'to contact BETANCOURT for the purpose:
ascertaining what the funds weré to be used for, exactly how much neede
