NEUTRALITY MATTER — CUBA

MM T-1, who has been engaged in Cuban revolutionary
activities for the past twelve years and who has been closely
associated with ROY EMORY HARGRAVES for the past nine years,
from 1961 to the present time, has furnished the following
information concerning HARGRAVES: ..

In May, 1961, VINCENT JOSEPH HANARD, Miami.
private detective, formed a group called the Freedom
Fighters. This organization of about fifty men con=
sisted of Cuban exile revolutionaries, American mer-
cenaries and adventurers. The purpose of the group
was to invade Cuba and overthrow Cuban Prime Minister
FIDEL CASTRO. HARGRAVES was one of the leading members
of this group.

| The group dissolved after several months when
they realized HANARD had been in a mental institution

and “was completely psychotic. In 1963, in U. S. District
Court, Miami, HANARD was sentenced to two years probation
and $1,000 fine for impersonating a Federal agent.

In November, 1961, HARGRAVES lived at 128.
Southwest 8th Street, Miami, with an unidentified American
girl. He had long hair, a beard, and was periodically
engaged. in burglaries, At that time, he was associated

with ROLANDO MASFERRER. ROJAS, the former Cuban senator
who had a group of men in Miami who’ were planning
military operations against Cuba.

Also in 1961, HARGRAVES was active with
GERALD PATRICK HEMMING, an.American mercenary in Miami
who had formed a group of 20 or 30 men for the purpose
of invading Cuba. Most of HEMMING's. recruits were
military deserters, fugitives, degenerates and psycho-
paths. HARGRAVES was one of the leading members of
HEMMING's groupe

On December 4, 1962, HARGRAVES and twelve others
were arrested by U. S. Customs Agents at Marathon, Florida,
for attempting to illegally. export arms to Cuba.

On February 19, 1963,.HARGRAVES continued to
be unemployed, was involved in burglaries and theft,
lived in flophouses, and was eating at the Salvation
Army shelter.

During: the middle of February, 1963, HARGRAVES
invited three other. individuals to go on a military
mission to Cuba. They recruited eight Cuban exiles and
obtained money and weapons fromROLANDO MASFERRER. They
left the South Florida area immediately in a small boat.

A: few days later, this group arrived at Elbow
Cay, Bahamas, and from there, went to the north coast of

~Cuba, where they hijacked two Cuban Government fishing

boats, They took these two fishing boats back to Eibow
Cay and HARGRAVES returned to Florida for additional
fuel for the boats.

On February 21, 1963, the Cuban Government sent
an expedition to Elbow Cay, arrested the eight hijackers
and recovered the two Cuban fishing boats.

ROY RMORY HARGRAVES.

On March 10, 1963, HARGRAVES, along with Miami
attorney CHARLES ASHMAN, went to Elbow Cay to look for
evidence of Cuban Army occupancy of the island. They
found.no evidence. They did plant some false evidence
there and HARGRAVES later furnished ASHMAN with false
sworn statements from persons who claimed to have wit-
nessed Cuban Government occupancy of the island. ASHMAN
later went to Nassau and London to protest to the
British Government. On October 7, 1964, ASHMAN was
indicted by a Federal Grand Jury in Miami-on 18 counts
of Interstate Transportation of Stolen Property and. was
conmitted to.a mental institution.”

ALEXANDER I. ROURKE, a free-lance photographer
and adventurer, in 1963 was involved in Cuban revolutionary
activity and made illegal airplane flights to Cuba. on
September 24, 1963, ROURKE and another man rented a plane
in South Florida, flew to Cozumel, Mexico, refueled, and
then left for Honduras. They were never heard from again.
The insurance carrier which insured the airplane put up
32500 to search for the missing plane. On November 2,
1963, HARGRAVES, HEMMING and seven others, aboard a
chartered DC#3, left South Florida ona search mission.
They eventually arrived in Guatemala, where they remained
in a drunk and disorderly condition, and w arrested and
ordered out of the country. They then returned to the
United States.

As of March 10, 1964, HARGRAVES was living at
the Barlington Hotel in Miami. Two days previously he,
along with another mercenary, a Cuban exile revolutionary
named. VICENTE (last name unknown), left for the Florida
Keys with a boat.and a large supply of fuel. They
indicated they were going on a mission to Cuba. On

supply and ordered then not to leave the United States.

On October 22, 1968, the SDS (Students for a
Democratic Society) canter in tong Beach, Caltférania,
was bombed, The Long. Beach Police Department advised
that HARGRAVES had been arrested for the bombing and
would be formally charged with the bombing on October 23,

~1968. . The disposition of this charge and arrest is unknown.

On September 13, 1970, MM T1 advised HARGRAVES
publicly states he is involved ina plan to cause military
hostilities between the United States and Cuba. He is
closely associated in this matter with GERALD PATRICK
HEMMING, HEMMING claims the plan is so good that United
States intelligence agency officials are now wo nder ing
why their operatives on the local level do not aid ana
support the plan in which HARGRAVES is involved. HEMMING
claims that he and HARGRAVES have visited the various
Federal enforcement agencies in Miami and they all whole=
heartedly agree with ana sympathetically support the plan
in which HARGRAVES is involved,
