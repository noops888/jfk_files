RE:

ROY EMORY HARGRAVES

INTERNAL SECURITY - CUBA

NEUTRALITY MATTER - CUBA

MM Tal, who has been engaged in Cuban revolutionary

activities for the past twelve years

and who has been closely

associated with ROY EMORY HARGRAVES for the past nine years,

from 196l to the present time, has furnished the following

information concerning HARGRAVES: v

In May, 1961, VINCENT JOSEPH HANARD, Miami

private detective, formed a group called the Freedom

Fighters.

This organization of about fifty men con-

sisted of Cuban exile revolutionaries, American mer-

cenaries and adventurers.

The purpose of the group

was to invade Cuba and overthrow Cuban Prime Minister

FIDEL CASTROâ€¢ HARGRAVES was one of the leading members

of this group.

The group dissolved after several months when

they realized HANARD had been in a mental institution

and was completely psychotic. In 1963, in U. S. District

Court, Miami, HANARD was sentenced to two years probation

and $1,000 fine for impersonating a Federal agent.

In November, 1961, HARGRAVES Lived at 128.

Southwest 8th Street, Miami, with an unidentified American

girl. He had long hair, a beard, and was periodically

engaged in burglaries.

At that time, he was associated

with ROLANDO MASFERRER ROJAS, the former Cuban senator

who had a group of men in Miami who were planning

military operations against Cuba.

Also in 1961, HARGRAVES was active with

GERALD PATRICK HEMMING, an American mercenary in Miami

who had formed a group of 20 or 30 men for the purpose

of invading Cuba. Most of HEMMING's recruits were

military deserters, fugitives, degenerates and psycho-

paths. HARGRAVES was one of the leading members of

HEMMING'S grOUp.

On December 4, 1952, HARGRAVES and twelve others

were arrested by U.

S. Customs Agents at Marathon, Florida,

for attempting to illegally export arms to Cuba.

On February 19, 1963, HARGRAVES continued to

be unemployed, was involved in burglaries and theft,

lived in flophouses, and was eating at the Salvation

Army shelter.

During the middle of February, 1963, HARGRAVES

invited three other individuals to go on a military

mission to Cuba. They recruited eight Cuban exiles and

obtained money and weapons fromROLANDO MASFERRER. They

left the South Florida area immediately in a small boat.

A few days later, this group arrived at Elbow

Cay, Bahamas, and from there, went to the north coast of

Cuba, where they hijacked two Cuban Government fishing

boats. They took these two fishing boats back to Elbow

Cay and MARGRAVES returned to Florida for additional

fuel for the boats.

On February 21, 1963, the Cuban Government sent

an expedition to Elbow Cay, arrested the eight hijackers

and recovered the two Cuban fishing boats.

ROY NIORY HARGRAVES

On March 10, 1963, MARGRAVES, along with Miami

attorney CHARLES ASHMAN, went to Elbow Cay to look for

evidence of Cuban Army occupancy of the island.

They

found no evidence.

They did plant some false evidence

there and HARGRAVES later furnished ASHMAN with false

sworn statements from persons who claimed to have wit

nessed Cuban Government occupancy of the island. ASHMAN

later went to Nassau and London to protest to the

British Government. On October 7, 1964, ASHMAN was

indicted by a Federal Grand Jury in Miami on 18 counts

of Interstate Transportation of Stolen Property and was

conmitted to a mental institution.*

ALEXANDER I. ROURKE, a free-lance photographer

and adventurer, in 1963 was involved in Cuban revolutionary

activity and made illegal airplane flights to Cuba.

On

September 24, 1963, ROURKE and another man rented a plane

in South Florida, flew to Cozumel, Mexico, refueled, and

then left for Honduras.

They were never heard from again.

The insurance carrier which insured the airplane put up

$2500 to search for the missing plane. On November 2,

1963, HARGRAVES, HEMMING and seven others, aboara a

chartered DC-3, left South Florida on a search mission.

They eventually arrived in Cuatemala, where they remained

in a drunk and disorderly condition, and were arrested and

ordered out of the country. They then returned to the

United States.

As of March 10, 1964, FARGRAVES was living at

the Barlington Hotel in Miami.

Two days previously he,

along with another mercenary, a Cuban exile revolutionary

named VICENTE (last name unknown), left for the Florida

Keys with a boat and a large supply of fuel.

They

indicated they were going on a mission to Cuba. On

March 10, 1964, U. E.Custons Agents seized their fuel

supply and ordered then not to leave the United States.

On October 22, 1968, the SDS (Students for a

Democratic Society) center in Long Beach, Calferania,

was bombed.

The Long Beach Police Department advised

that HARGRAVES had been arrested for the bombing and

would be formally charged with the bombing on October 23,

1968. The disposition of this charge and arrest is unknown.

On September 13, 1970, MM T-1 advised HARGRAVES

publicly states he is involved in a plan to cause military

hostilities between the United States and Cuba.

He is

closely associated in this matter with GERALD PATRICK

HENMING. HEMMING claims the plan is so good that United

States intelligence agency officials are now wondering

why their operatives on the local level do not aid and

support the plan in which HARGRAVES is involved. HEMMING

claims that he and HARGRAVES have visited the various

Federal enforcement agencies in Miami and they all whole-

heartedly agree with and sympathetically support the plan

in which HARGRAVES is involved.
