This reference is an SISS report which revealed that in
January, 1959, classes atthe University of Havana had been suspended
for months by Batista and some students had engaged in terrorist
activities against him. The mass of the student body never engaged
in clandestine activities-against Batista, proof of this contention /
was found in the small afmount of students who actually did join
Fidel Castro in the Sierra Maestra or Eloy Gutierrez Menoyo in the SNFE.

was planned but this invasion failed because Menoyo advised the
Cuban government of the plan. He was also in the company of Raul |
Castro in Havana and Rodriguez decided Menoyo could not be trusted.
Menoyo called Rodriguez an enemy of Cuba and Rodriguez saw him for
the last time in mid-1960. (Details of Menoyo's activities in

or contact with Alpha 66. CIA stated that it had no value because
of its discrediting in the Cuban exile community by the disclosure
of the secret alliance between its leader, Veciana, and Eloy
Gutierrez Menoyo, head of SNFE. Under their alliance Gutierrez
diverted Alpha 66. funds to finance SNFE paramilitary operations and
ran them as Alpha 66 activities, The Alpha 66 combat element had no
exploitable military value because it was either identical with or
heavily penetrated by the Gutierrez action group. The dissident
element of Alpha 66, referred to as L66, was regarded by CIA as a
superficial split due to the presence in L66, particularly its
combat group, of Alpha 66 operational personnel, who had been and

On 3/8/63, Dr. Enio Zayas, Newark, NJ, a Cuban refugee,
Doctor of Pharmacy, advised that before he came to the US in :
August, 1962, he was associated with his father, Dr. Constantino
Zayas, owner of Linner Pharmaceutical Laboratories, Havana, Cuba.
He stated that in early 1959, several meetings were held in Havana
for the purpose of ousting the Somoza regime in Nicaragua. Dr. Manuel
Lacayo Farfan was the leader of this group. Zayas and his father went
to Costa Rica in June, 1960, on a business trip, however, his father :
wished to meet with various Nicaraguans living in exile in Costa Rica :
for the purpose of deposing of the Somoza regime. Shortly after they I
arrived they met with Eloy Gutierrez Menoyo. At that time Gutierrez !
was still Commandante of the Cuban Army and had gone to Costa Rica
secretly by way of Mexico. At a subsequent meeting Dr. Lacayo
offered the position of leader of the war effort against Nicaragua
to Gutierrez, which he accepted. However something forced a
cancellation of all these plans. It was Zay@s' opinion that’ something
happened between Gutierrez and Fidel Castro, and Gutierrez had to
flee Cuba. Zayas stated that he did not know of any subsequent plans
by these principals to accomplish the overthrow of the Somoza regime,
