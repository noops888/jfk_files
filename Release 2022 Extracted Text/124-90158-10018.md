not to prematurely alert him to their investigation.

For the information of the Bureau, it would

appear the original information with regard to HART coming

individuals attempted to sell information to the Guyanese

and Venezuelan governments concerning this alleged plot by

HARt after reportedly having been bilked by HaRt, and ClA

Leads are presently outstanding for interview of HOLNESS

and HARRIS.

Previous interviews of HOLNESS, as set out in

Miami LHMs of August 27, 1969 and November 7, 1969 under the

HOLNESS caption developed information regarding HART's

attempts to

purchase arms in Florida in 1969. These LHMS

are being disseminated locally to Customs for information

in its continuing investigation of HART.

in the past. In view of this, on February 12, 1970, ED

ANDERSON, CIA, Covert, Miami,

was contacted with regard to

their current

connection with CIA at which time ANDERSON was

briefed orally concerning above facts. (Sel)(

ANDERSON confirmed that LUIS POSADA continues to

be of operational interest to CIA; and 21though ORLANDC

GARCIAPhas been of operational interest for many years in

the past, he was unable to verify definitely that GARCIAS

is still under CIA control. He also provided no other

information as to extent of CIA's involvement, if any, in

this alleged arms smuggling operation. (e)

Of his CIA connections? SCHACHTEI

will consult with CIA to determine the extent of thei

involvement in this operation.

Since the principal statute involved is under

U. S. Customs jurisdiction and Customs is currently conducting

instigation concerning

HART, Miami feels no interview of

HART should be conducted as requested by State. It would

appear more appropriate that Customs should conduct such

interview at the proper time during the course of their

investigation; and UACB, no interview will be conducted.

Miami will continue to maintain close liaison

with Customs and will submit LHM, with copy to Customs

locally, following interviews of HOLNESS and HARRIS.
