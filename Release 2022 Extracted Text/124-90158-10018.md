consulted prior to any interview of the subject in order
not to prematurely alert him to their investigation.

For the information of the Bureau, it would
appear the original information with regard to HART coming
to the U. S. to negotiate a $300,000 arms deal originated
with HART's contacts in Florida; JOSEPH EUGENSYSOLNESS in
West Dain Beach, STANLE RRIS, in Jacksonville “4tnese
individuals attempted to sell information to the Guyanese
and Venezuelan governments concerning this alleged plot by
HART after reportedly having been bilked by HART, and CIA
is of the opinion this information orginated with them.
Leads are presently outstanding for interview of HOLNESS
and HARRIS.

Previous interviews of HOLNESS, as set out in
Miami LHMs of August 27, 1969 and November 7, 1969 under the
HOLNESS caption developed information regarding HART's
attempts to purchase arms in Florida in 1969, These LHMs
are being disseminated locally to Customs for information
in its continuing investigation of HART,

case, gn January 15, 1970, FAUSTO DANISh¢aLLAR/ and Fla.

Tobacco’ Tax Unit for violation of the National Firearms
Act, possession of unregistered automatic weapons. At time
of their arrest, they were selling firearms to an undé¥éover
Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Unit Agent which were determined

was in contact with MORALES, VILLAR sta ; he been
ygontacted in 1969 by LUIS POSADA, ORLA GARCIA and_ JOHNNY
PREART (associate of POSADA) with arms shipments to

venezuela for use of the Guyanese insurgents. He said that
several shipments of arms had already been sent to Venezuela
with these men and he personally assisted in handling one
such shipment from Ft. Lauderdale to Venezuela. VILLAR
stated that CIA was aware of this and that [POSADA was working

for CIA 1©

On January 30, 1970, MORALES advised that VILLAR
said he has known since January 23, 1970 that HART is in the
Miami area for the purpose of buying weapons and that HART,
ORLANDO GARCIA, and “LUIS POSADA are working together on this
deal.

It is noted that (LUIS, osani{2na ORLANDO GARCIA,
who are allegedly working irinpher in this~“arms purchase,
are’ known to have been of opérational interest to CIA

in the past. In view of this, on February 12, 1970, ED
ANDERSON, CIA, Covert, Miami, was contacted with regard to
their current connection with CIA at which time ANDERSON was
briefed orally concerning above facts. (ge) )

| ANDERSON(Confirmed that LUIS,POSADA continues to
be of operational ‘mterest to CIA; an 1 though ORLANDO
GARCL. as been of operational intere: for many years i,
the past, he was unable to verify definitely that (GARCIA\S
lis still under CIA control. He also provided no other -
information as to extent of CIA's involvem mt, if any, in
this alleged arms smuggling opera tion: QB 7

On February 13, 1970, ASAC SCHACHTER, U. Ss.
Customs, Miami, who has primary gjurisdction with regard to
arms smuggling, was orally apprised of the above’ facts.

SCHACHTER stated he had placed a nationwide stop with the
Immigration and Naturalization Service concerning HART.
SCHACHTER volunteered that he was personally acquainted with

G) SADA and was well aware of‘ his CIA connections%] SCHACHTER
Will consult with CIA to determine the extent o heir
involvement in this operation.

Since the principal statute involved is under
U. S. Customs jurisdiction and Customs is currently conducting
invstigation concerning HART, Miami feels no interview of
HART should be conducted as requested by State. It would
appear more appropriate that Customs should conduct such
interview at the proper time during the course of their
investigation; and UACB, no interview will be conducted.

Miami will continue to maintain close liaison
with Customs and will submit LHM, with copy to Customs
locally, following interviews of HOLNESS and HARRIS,

Bureau is requested to determine from CIA if
(9Gartanno GARCIA VASQUEZ)\ (Bureau File 64-36297) continues to
be of [operational interest] to that @ency. DOR
