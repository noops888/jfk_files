JEK ASSASSINATION FILE REVIEW

Coordination with Office of Congressional Affairs

The Office of Congressional Affairs has told us that

they would like to rely on our review (HRG & DO) Of OLO

materials in the JEK files. They have asked us specifically

to alert them to any statements made about members of

Congress or staff members of HSCA or other committees. -

If you find any such statements or anything else that seems

sensitive let me know and I will call Susan McMains.
