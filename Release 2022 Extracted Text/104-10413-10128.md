(ABEIT 1947 (by_Bil1_Doyle)) until arrival of Win Scott as COS in 1958, Charles

Anderson III.(still in LA/HQ) had developed a support apparatus to ae
exploit leads from the Soviet Embassy, This umbrella type project (LIFEAT)

consisted of multi line phone taps,(Chree photo sites))a mobile surveillance

team and a mail intercept operation.

tapped was Lintea’by availability of a listening post nearvy
(since the taps were not made in the main central) and English/
Spanish (Soviet, Polish, Czech, etc) transcribers. Generally
thess agents (mostly Mexican or Mexican American) were related
(which the station et that time felt was good security in thet

if they telked about“shop; they would talk to each’ other.)

the Station’ got word thet the photo of "uniden man" was being released to the
public by the Warren Conmission. The photo operators were moved to another apt
nearby. The ‘property was'sold (under an operational agreement with LIMOUSINE

the front gate of the Soviet Embassy, -The agents in LIMITED and LILYRIC (both
Mexican fanilies) as far as we knew, were not acquainted with each other.

LILYRIG was a.rented apartment. LICALLA, the third photo site, was located

in one of a row of four houses on the South side of the Soviet Embassy compound

LIMOUSINE as the purchaser (check). This site overlooked the back garden of

the Soviet Enbassy compound. The purpose of this operetion was to get good

identification photographs of the Soviet. personnel (who at thet time vere largel;

3. My memory is a little vague about the origins of the Cuban Bubassy but I
think the staff first developed from a pro-Castro group celebrating on New
Years eve 1959. As I recall, it was a makeshift arrangement of volunteers
through most of 1960 end 61 with Ton Hazlitt producing voluminous reports on
their activities and recruitirg agerits right and left anong Cuban nationals in
Mexico City. :

Warren Commission, To determine who vas-there and whet they were doing I
