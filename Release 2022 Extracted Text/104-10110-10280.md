8. My relations with ne_[Bartes)heve been very good, and I am
Inclined to believe what he says. r, this whole matter, of course,
would have to be evaluated by the Clandestine Services.

9. There _is one other matter | would like to mention In connece
tlon with Mr. (Berths \and that Is that he served for two and a half months
with a group of Cuban filers in the Congo, as he holds a pilot's license.
He did not tell me and I did not ask who the sponsors of this were or
what the[e duties were, He did, however, mention a Colonel [Weber land a
Nr, (Saundars.] 4 strongly Suspect, of course, that this was an agency
operation ~ if so, the Clangess Services will already have & good
deal of Information about ur. (Bai sf

10. 1 pass this on for whatever It Is worth and, If there Is any
further Information whlch | can provide, 1 shall be glad to do so.
