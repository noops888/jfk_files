@. Weapons. ARTINE agreed that it would be in
gobody’s interest for his weapons to fall into the wrong
hands. He was asked for ideas on dis;
ares and came up with the following su;
appears to be on excellent one. The mothership, MV
BANTA MARIA, is in need of repairs and nust go into a
shipyard... Tentative arrangements have been made to
put her in the yards at Galveston, Tex: some tine
fn March or April, ARTINK can order his security detail
to store the arus aboard the ship for "secirit;" reasons
before she leaves for the yard. They will simply re-

snother will be due by the tine the aircraft can
be returned.  ARTIME was reluctant to lst the plane
go back without payment, but also reluctant to
@queese the $2,500 out of his budget. Case officer
» Yoiced his opinion that the owner would probably
be glad to get the plane beck and would not likely
think it worth going to court. However, in view.
of the fact that it would be a "closed-circuit"
transaction and would actually cost the Government
mothing, it is recommended that a special euthoriza-
tion of $2,500 be channeled to ARTIUE for payment

probity. He will surely appreciate this gesture,

SUBJECT 3 Background Sxetch on Dr. Manvel =
: Artine Buesa t.

1. Manuel Artine Buesa, a non-practicing medical
@cotor, began his political activities in Cuba during the '
year 1939 whon he participated in the formation of a civic .
action type program known. as the “Comandos Rurale: The "
Comandos Rurales actively participated with the FO.
Fegies during its initial agrarian reform, but eventually...
broke with it due to Castro’s shift to Harxism-Leninisa.

It war at this point that Artins formed the Movimiento de
Becuperacicn Revolucionaria (252, Sovensat for the Recovery
@f the Revolution), a political organization which he beads
we te date. The degree of Artine’s activities in the civic
ection program was reflected by the fact that Artizs, prior ~
to his break with Castro, had been appointed a cepiity in

the Instituto Hacioual de la Befcrsa Agregaria (IRA) for
Oriente .. actime’s first contact with the Agency

: : 1, On the basis of the discussion on 27 Muy between

Chief, WH and Manuel Artime, we are currently in the process

of submitting a recommendation to the 303 Committee that we as
maintain contact with Artime and render support to him on a

modest basis. His monthly operating budget, which he sub-

mitted to us, would enable him to keep the MRR alive as a
recognized exile political organization, and would allow him,
personally, to maintain his status as an important exile Geer’
leader. This would, in turn, continue his access to heads of

state and other leading political figures in Latin America.

2. Pending action by the 303 Committee, it is recommended

—— of June 1965, on the basis of the following budget

i MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

__ SUBJECT: Contact of Manuel Artine with Professor George :
Lodge and with Col, Barrientos.of Bolivia : .

1, I talked with Manuel Artime by phone the night i 3
of 4 June: He said he had received a call from Professor i

that afternoon but was not at home to talk with bia,
(This was obviously a follow-up from tle offer made tu
Artime by Chief, WH to put him and Lodge. together on his
proposed civic action activities.) I told him there
BO reason he should not return the call and arrange for a
-meeting with Lodge at their mutual convenience,

3. Artime said that was his firs: reaction, but
before he could make the call another message had come in
“c=. gyom Col, Barrientos of Bolivia asking if he could visit
. the country for the benefit of his advice and counsel and

- offering to send a Bolivian Air Force plane to pick him up
and bring him to La Paz. I asked if he were acquainted
with Barrientos or an expert on Bolivia and he said he ‘uew
Ro more about either of them than what he had read in tue
papers. He had no jdea of the reason for the invitation,
- but wanted to check with us and find out if we had any
requirements for him in case we wanted him to make the visit.
*f told him I would check with Chief, WH next morning and
«Gall him back. :

: 3. On the morning of 5 June I called Artime. He said
Professor Lodge had called him at 0700 that morning and told
him he was interested in getting together with him, Lodge
gaid he would be in Panama on 14 June, and Artime said he
planned to be travelling 22 that area at that time and could
easily meet him there. Artime told Lodge he was willing to
make a trip to Poston to see him earlier and that after such
a preliminary mesting, the next meeting in Panama would probably
be more useful, Lodge seemed delighted and invited Artime



ie SECRET
-2-

to lunch vith bim on 9 June. I suggested to Artime that

he plan to meet Lodge on 9 June, stop in Sashington on the
way home where I could meet with him (and furnish him a
briefing on Bolivia which he desperately requested). I
suggested he send a message to Barrientos saying he could
be in Panama on 11 June and could see Barrientos as soon
thereafter as transportation could be arranged. (Artime has
& visit with President Robles of Panama scheduled about that
time and can work it in, together with the meeting with
Lodge on 14 June in Panama, )

4. Artime said he had found out the background of the
invitation from Barrientos. One of Barrientos’ trusted
aides had been to Washington or New York and in passing ©
through Mirai enroute home heard a MRR radio broadcast
about countering subversion, civic action, etc. that
attracted his attention, There was also a brief analysis
of the situation in Bolivia which appealed to him as tl
best-balanced hehad heard, He. thereupon started asking
questions about the MRR and Artine and referred to one”
of Artime’s people who turned over some copies of “Tridente”
(magazine of the MRR), ‘The aide remarked that he was going
to report to Barrientos of his discovery of a Cuban exile
group that seomed knowledgeable of Castro and Communist
Subversion operations and had some useful ideas of howto
counter them, Two days later Artime- received the invitation

from Barrientos. |

c. AKBIDDY-1 gave the impression of not. being involved
with any political plan. Occasionally he talked to friends

Propaganda, Other times he gave consideration to propositions
of friends, such as the Spaniard who acts as his chauffeur
and secretary, concerning various business deals, He also talks
of tyying a farm in Nicaragua to cultivate rice, etc,

reported infornation he had received from Iden A, as follows:.

a; Iden B said that AMBIDDY-1 was only concerned
with maintaining the small. ASWORLD camp in Nicaragua, where
there were weapons, ammunition, and seven men, who were there
without the knovledge of the ODYOKERs. Iden B said. that
AMBIDDY-1 was awaiting an opportuse moment to arm as many
friends as possible and leave for PBRUMEN,

b. Iden C said that there really were arms and
ammunition cached in the camp in Nicaragua, but that the seven

men there spent al) their time looking for persons to buy
the arms and ammunition, -

‘
,

‘ ¢, Iden C also said he believed that if AMBIDDY-1] was
keeping up his radio transminsions and payments to some
Journalists it was because they served as a cover for his
commercial operations and that all the propaganda would

Meetings with AMJAVA-4 in Washington, 27-28 June 1965 :
Subject: Proposed Agency Programs : =

1, Following the demise of AMWORLD, AMJAVA-4 has become
1 familiar with three other Agency programs, or proposed prograas,
7 and he asked if he could have sone clarification as to Just
what we wanted from him and his people. I explained that there were
three different functions which needed to be done and that the
Agency was trying to develop programs to meet each need, The
three functions concerning Cuba are:

(a) to maintain the MRR as a. respected r
organization with a political posture which acceptable to most
Cubans and not inimical to U.S. interests. are asking approval of

- &@ minimum budget for subsidy of the MRR which will pay for its
published and radio publicity matter, subsistence to survivors of
MRR killed, disabled, or captured, and travel expenses for. AMBIDDY-1.
as the der of the tiovement outside Cuba, We are trying to
guide A-1 into a program of Community Development/Civic Action
Projects in Latin America as a means of projecting an image of the
MRR and of A-1 as constructive, forward-looking people instead of
simply exile counterrevolutionaries. We would hope that such
activities would keep the movement together, give the members
practical experience which would eventually be useful in Cuba, and
ain the meantime, would render useful results in countering
problems of insurgency in Latin America.

{

*(>) to prepare a managerial and executive tean of
specially selected Cuban exiles who would be ready to move into Cuba.
should relations be resumed with the United States in order to eee
furnich effective direction of necessary governmental functions and
- assist the United States in denying the island to Communist
control. Selected candidates would, hopefully, be fairly young
as well as intelligent and capable of profiting from extensive
training programs which would be designed for cach to prepare hin
to perform a specific function in a future Cuban regime. . The
program would be apolitical, each person being considered ag an
- individual and not as representative of any organization, This
ag the program for which A-4 is being considered for training in
the field of internal security for work with the Agency ina post- *

Castro Cubaa r:

fa) to select and maintain a small cadre of Cuban exile

situations anywhere in the world on short notice and for short
periods of time. When not mobilized, the Agency would assjxq
them inmaintaining employment and supporting theeselves. te,
would also, of course, be available for emergency operational «
commitment to Cuba if required. (It was explained
the program handled by Mr, Tom Clines of SOD, who
@iscussed it more in detail with A-4.)

j

i
2, A-4 understood that the programs outlined above ware i
only parts of an overall concept concering Cuba, that the Yirse was 5
designed to meet long-term political considerations, the second i
@ meet long-term strategic requirements, and the third to meet Pee
current operational needs, He understood and completely aireed &
with each program, and agreed to cooperate in executing oan of Laseteee
them, to the max: of his ability, He will be happy to spot and
recruit for us in each program, and will try to influence -AyBIDDY-1
song the lines we want him to follow, A-4 appreciated ou,
explanations and stated ‘t he could be much more helpfuh to us
now that he understoud what we were trying to iene deh

‘and has been visiting the center, A-1 received a letter
from Prof, Lodge asking for assignment of an experienced
man to the staff of the center. Bishop McGrath repeated %
the request, saying he would like to have two men as soon
as possible, with a total of six by January when he plans 7
to increase the program, The two mon selected were Silvano
P0OZ0 Carrillo (201-7397743 and Nestor TZQUIERDO Diaz
(201-281933) both Negroes from Oriente Province and former
Comandos Rurales, A~l asked the Bishop what part the Panama
Government played and was told they approved, although they
were not directly involved. ‘A-1 understands that the center
will train students from all over Latin America and has ‘
already graduated more than twenty students from several
countries,

SUBJECT: Meeting with George Lodge, Harvard School
of Business

_-1. Gn 15 July 1965, with Mr. Andy Croce of CA Starr,
I wet Mr, Lodge at the Key Bridge Marriott Hotel to discuss
what he knew about thc relations among AMBIDDY-1, Bishop
McGrath of Panama, and.a rural development program they: are. .
all working on.in Panama, Mr. Lodge described Bishop McGrath - :
@ real ball of fire, about 39 or 40 years old, born of
8. parents in the Canal. Zone but he has taken Panama’
citzenship, He graduated from Notre Dame University, did
Graduate work in Rome and has taught in scveral European
and Latin American universities, such as in Chile. - He is.
one of the three top Catholic prelates in Latin America
and has extremely close ties with the Vatican, 6.g., he is
on the Ecumenical Council and on the birth control group. He
- has an official operating budget of $2,000 per year which he.
augments from every conceivable source, Particularly from ‘the
_ German bishops, He is politically and operationally minded,
an American completely in his attitude and behavior, a
~ typical Irish: politician, Mr.- Lodge submitted somewhat’
wryly. His parents are retired and live in Miami where he :
visits often. . He recently met AMBIDDY-1 there on two occasions, 3
.., Qa this same visit he also, met the Papal Nuncio- fron ‘Santo H
:, Domingo (he appears to receive most of the hot potato type
» assignments in his part.of the world).

: 4, Veraguas Province of Panama is a selected testing
ground for community develonment programa if rural areas.
Te 48 the poorest and most hopeless province of Panama, a
small armed uprising took place there in 1958 and wae put -
dorn, The Communista have their best organization in Panama
‘4a this province, The program there is based on the. village.

Pinto who has-been thereabout 10 years. He is a dynamic
young man who has. lead the villagers to rebuild their village
and church to develop their land and organize a cooperative
and small credit facilities. The village is only 1,200
people but they raised by themselves $1,000 to buy materials peu
and-then built a training center capable of housing, feeding if
and training 60 men at a time in rural cooperatives and rural ce
development, One of their ideas is to select bright looking : are
leaders. and potential leaders from rural areas, first in 7 1 7
Panama and later, hopefully, from other nearby countries EE
for visits of a few days in which they hope to brain-wash —
them of Communist type propaganda they may have heard and
show them what can actually be done so they can take the
good word with them to their own communities. This is in
addition to the regular formal course. of 4 months for
selected young potential leaders from rural communities in
Panama and all over Latin America,

3. Another leading light in the program is Father
Steele who was thrown out of Dominica by Trujillo for
organizing cooperatives and is a recognized authority on
. the subject. Father Steele uses Veraguas as a home base
but travels to Chile, Colombia and other countries conducting
short training courses on the ground, There are some Dutch
' priests on the staff whom Bishop McGrath personally recruited.
+a cnnasit Father Vasquez Pinto has sent about 10 to 15 local boys. to
i the Antigonish School in-Nova Scotia and they are back for
duty. Mr. Lodge describes the group as a highly motivated
and enersetic group and Father Vasquez Pinto as a young and
effective Panamanian priest who is a good operator,. Mr. Lodge
bas two men from Harvard University there to study the
program and assist in any way they can, The Peace. Corps has
&4 people in the Central Provinces of Panama, about 30 of

. them in Veraguas Province. They cooperate with the center,

_ 4m fact the two Harvard men are interviewing each of the
Peace Corps volunteers about their work. Mr. Lodge said they
are coming up with some good informat‘on and ideas which other-
wise would be lost as there is a good deal of. experience

- among the Peace Corps kids but they don't know to recognize
‘ite significance cr how to orgenfze it inte useable form, .

. . 4, The above group is trying to organize the center ag a
viable base with an effective staff to continue the training
< program even if the present leaders should move on, . They
Rope it will become a pilot program for Latin America and -
. that they will be able to seed other similar programa froa

this one. They hope to be able to spot and develop leaders
in remote arcas for future operations in those arcas-
Incidental to these major objectives, they are also helping
to develop the economy of Veraguas, to aevelop production,
transport to markets, credit facilities, and in general to
help alleviate grievances whicb the Comaunists have exploited

5. Bishop McGrath hi ranged with AYRIDDY-1 for about
pix ofAMBIDDY-1'sS people to attend the January 1966 ‘training
course, with 3 or 4 to remain on the staii. Hopefully, one
of them will develop into the executive director of the ~
center. It was agreed that the first reo will not be too
closely associated in the public oye wita AMBIDBY-1 in order
to try to forestall initial bad pubticity fren opposition ©
elements. AMBIDDY-1 and Bishop McGrath agreed, therefore,
that Nestor IZQUIERDO (who. is well known as a long-time
adherent of AMBIDDY-1 ‘from 1958-59
in Oriente) would not be assigned to the Panama center at
this time. AMBIDDY-1 told Bishop McGrath that he would try
to obtain sufficient funds to support the men assigned to the
ith his case

center. He: has not yet brought up this matter W.

and confidence in KUBARK because the AMLILACs believe that
anything AMBIDDY-1 does is done with KUBARK support and blessing.
As Headquarters is avare the great fear of the AMLILACS is that
AMBIDDY-1 will get all the action and all the glory. However,
in view of the current KUBARK/AMBIDL;-1 relationship the
AMLILACs have little to fear and a renewed morale crisis is not
expected to arise. On the other hand, if AMBIDDi-1 were to
re-activate part of his action force and cunduct a raid utilizing
cr non-KUBARK support, that would be another matter. It would then
; be very difficult to convince the AMLILACs that KUBARK was not

REY: UPGA 22667, 10 August 1965 iets

1. As you know, the HQS AMWORLD case officer recently visited
the WAVE area and went to the warehouse with AMJAVA-4 and his wife,
described as a possible purchaser of some of the equipment. The
warehouse is full of soldy and rusting camp and support: equiprr.st,
most of it of. no use in mounting Yriding operations, There. are.
outboard motors, saall. generators, engine spare parts, air drop -
equipment, bedding, etc, in addition to a large nen of baby chicks
purchased by AMBIDDY-1 in bis latest venture of training for rural
Civic development programs in Central America. There was ono -
custodian working around the warehouse and taking care of the
chickens, AMBIDDY-) has. also purchased an off-set printing press,
for $10,000 according to him, which is set up a few blocks avay.
Be plans to use it to print the AMYUM magazine, plus hopefully
making some profit for AMYUM from it on commercial printing jobs.

2, AMJAVA-4 and AMBIDOY-) both laughed beartily at the idea
that the PC of BABUN could be converted to a mothership,. This
was considered and rejected several months ago when AMWORLD was
still authorized to operate. They turned down the: offer of the
ship as a sift thon on grounds that it would be uneconomical even
if given to them free of charge. :

3. AMBIDDY-1 said he did have a total of ten men in Ricaragua;,
five at Monkey Point guarding a cache. of: small arms and teaching the
local Izdiane to read, write and grow rice;’three mon at. Bluefields

a cache of small arms and vorking to develop a email boat
yard for repair and maintenance. of shrimp. boats: from. which. ANBIDDY-1
hopes to. build a fishing cooperative; and two men at Managua with
‘a emaller cache of small arms, one of whom is the AHYUM delegate
to the Nicaraguan Government. AMBIDDY-1 kept about 150! small aras,
with the knowledge and consent of 5Q5, in return for his giving back:
or accounting for the heavier and crew-served we! and most of
the saall arms from AMWORLD, He cl#ixs that all three caches in.

for immediate destruction by the custodiars should an attempt be
made to seize them, AMBIDLT-1 said nenad either plans sor Bo!
to reactivate any bases, except es they might be used for lo-:al
civic action type prograns,

4. ANBIDDY-1 was advised by nis case officer in strongest
‘ terms to sell or throw avay aver, thing from the Ceotral American
: camps, to concentrate on trying to project a pew image of hinself
a8 a constructive and progressive leader involved in commun: ty
development and civic action type Programs in Latin dewrica by
iavitation of the local governments, and to stop talking or acting
ag ® paramilitary operator. He was advised in eves stronger terns
to got out of the DAVE area-as soon as poasible to remove hiasetf
as a target of constant personal attacks against vhich he could
Bot defend hinself He agreed in principle, subject to. waiting
three sonths for his wife to celiver their. first child,

5. WAVE may assure the AMLILAC leader that, to the best
knowledge of KUBARK, the AMWORLD Program is dead, that. AMBIDDY-1
has no real intention and only limited capability of mounting
raids, and that anything he might do aiong the lines of paramilitary
action would certainly. be without ODYOKE support or blessing given
the present political climate in BQ8 area.

6. FYI, BQS continues to try to influence AMBIDDY-1 to stay
out of paramilitary matters entirely, To this end, we shall try’
to keep his top operational personnel otherwise occupied in KUBARK
or other employment, to keep him as fully and usefully occupied as
possible away from the WAVE and PBRUMEN area, and to convince him
to sell or lease his two Swift toats to commercial enterprises
or to another KUBARK program outside the WAVE area. .  -

TF. QS will weicome continued reporting on AMBIDDY-1's
activities from. WAVE sources, which serves a useful as.
@ check and monitor for the cage officer to compare and contrast
with AUBIDSY-1's reports to hin, In addition, ve are recruiting
the former ANWORLD Deputy for Support and Administration, who also

26 August 13565

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
FROM : AMBIDDY/1 - 23 Aug.st 1965

SUBJECT: AMBIDDY/1 discussions with General Anastasio
SOMOZA, President SCHICK and other Nicaraguan
officials, 24 Jul-20 Aug 1965.

1. A/1l first wet with General SOMOZA 27/28 July.
The following points were made in these discussions:

a. General SOMOZA said the State Department is
making an. investigation of how much money he is using to control
the government and win the next presidential elections. SOMOZA
told A/1 that he intended to run and fully expected to win the
election, but would not need to buy any votes. He asked A/1 to
please tell "Washington" that State is very clumsy and if they
Yeally want to know anything they should call on the Agency, or
the FBI, either of which is.much more effective. SOMOZA said
everybody in. Managua knows about State's efforts to block his.
“candidacy and are laughing at them.

b. SOMOZA suid he was meeting Daniel ODUBER of
Costa Rica at the border shortly, and they would make a "non-
aggression pact" agreeing that neither will make trouble. for.
the other's caupaign for election to Presidency. ODUBER had
asked for the interview. SOMOZA told A/l that he thought
ODUBEX had made a "live and let live" agreement with the Com-
munists, and that at their meeting, he would demand from ODUBER
@ public denunciation of the Communists to be followed by
efi.ctive control measures.against them.

©. The MRR will be allowed to build and operate
a@ stall boatyard for construction, maintenance and repair of
ghrimp boats at Biuefields without SOMOZA or the Nicaraguan

‘*@overnment to. be out into. the proceeds. This is part of A/l's

community developxent progrsm, aimed at developing a large
fishing cooperative. based oa Dluefields which will be self-

"" gustaining and profitable for the members and the local economy,

®OMOZA also approved continuation of the basic education
‘ogram being conducted. by A/i’s ive, man contingent at the old
lonkey Point base and eventual déVelepment of that armas a rice-

growing cooperative for the benefit of the local Indians.

y
i


Be

d. General SOMOZA, at A/l's strong recommendation,
“ agreed to start pushing Civic Action programs through the National
Guard in an effort to enhance his personal image preparatory to

the next Presidential campaign. SOMOZA asked A/) to assist and
advise in this effort.

2. The next meeting with General SOMOZA by A/1 was
on 4 August, with following points:

a@. SOMOZA said that the latest program of Fidel

CASTRO is targetted against Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama.
Perv: of the plan includes assassination of the presidents of
the three countries as part of a terror campaign to soften
them up. He said that in Panama, particularly, President
Marcos ROBLES is a prime target but the Communists are exploiting .
® recent turn against him by the. National Guard because he has
cut down on their costs, pensions, and other privileges, If

is eliminated from power, the Communists feel the chief
of tha National Guard will take over and they thinkémm they.
can handle him more easily than they can

soon eeesane somite tg ee eS
nn

bs. Source for above, according to SOMOZA, was a
close associate of Marcial AGUILUZ, whom he described as the top
Communist in Costa Rica and one who had recruited (fnu) FONSECA,
@ Nicaraguan now living in Mexico. FONSECA is a bastard son of
one of SOMOZA's foremen, a Communist, ar? an agent working
@irectly under order of Fidel CASTRO.

: @. A/1 and SOMOZA talked again about a Civic
Action program in Nicaragua and SOMOZA said again that he would
support it. He will assign Father LUGO, a Cuban priest who
served with the Bay of Pigs’ forces, to a position similar to a
chaplain in the National Guard in order to assist in the progran.
SOMOZA will support MRR community development programs with
whatever authorizations are required and with whatever official
or personal preatige he may offer.

3. A/1 next returned to Managua on 17 August and mot
with Major PEREZ of the Nicaraguan Customs Service » & personal aide
to the Generat, PEREZ said SOMOZA was very angry (not at A/1 or

A® Fecale) and difficult to see. He said 3 Colonels were under
arrest for 3 days each for disobeying orders. PEREZ was afraid
to mee SOMOZA for fear he might be arrested also, However, A/1
Gailed SOXGZA by phone and was invited to visit him next day
at Tipitapa, A/1l met him the next day (18 Aug) -and had lunch
with BOMOZA and (fnu) BENITEZ, a Puerto Rican, former politician

there who iv now in business but remaina in contact with and
Working for the U, 8, Government. After luioh, BENITEZ left-

t

oy.

FErvirs ves eSastseeee


and A/1 went with SOMOZA in his car. While they were riding,
SOMOZA told A/l why he was 50 angry. f 7

@. A message had recently come to General_—
SOMOZA from the Nicaraguan Ambassador in Panama saying that.he .
had it from authoritative sources thal. the U. S. not only : ’
would not support his candidacy for the Presidency, but would . .
strongly oppose it. In addition, SONOZA -had word that Sydney aaeeeer
ROSS, Director of El Tiempo (Spanish language newspaper in : ae
New York), after a recent interview with Asst. Secretary Jack
Vaughn of the State Department, had an off-the-record talk .
with VAUGHN after the interview. VAUGHN had said that, so far :
as he was concerned, SOMOZA was no different from the other a
Latin American dictators such aa TRUJILLO, PERON, DUVALIER, ft
STROESSNER, Col. LOPEZ, or Gen. CASTELL Branco, and that he i 5
could certainly not support installing. another military dictator eet -
in Nicaragua. The two reports were confirmatory in SOMOZA'S: : :
“mind and made him feel extremely bad as he said he has always : :
talked favorably about the U.S. and tried to cooperate with them

at every chance.

SOMOZA checked with the U.S. Ambassador in
Wicaragua (whether in person or by sending Pres. SCHICK was

not made clear) about the matter, and received a typical State
Department reply that the U.S. was neutral in Nicaraguan internal
affairs and would take no action about the elections. . The
Ambassador said he could not believe VAUGHN could have made

such statements because of the U.S. position of neutrality in

Bicaraguan affeirs.

i f. SOMOZA also said he had sent a message to
Washington suggesting that if some of the other countries heard
- ghout themselves being lumped with TRUJILLO, PERON, etc. they
~s might well call back their troops from Santo Domingo and tell

Washington to go to hell.
7 He said he was going ahec< with his plans

é g.
regardless of what the U.S. does about it and reminded A/1 of
Mr. J. C. KING's talk with hin (S0N0ZA) at the airport in
Washington to let him know after the mistinon attack on the
SIERRA ARANZAZU that Washington would undersiand if .
decided to kick A/1 and his camps out of Nicaragua. He used

“. this as an example of an attempt from Washington to dictate

“49 ham which he had ignored, telling A/1 that he was a friend,

_ would continue. to be, and would continue to make his own
.. decisions regardless of what Washington might want from him.

.< Q/1 made another strong suggestion that SOMOZA take off his

~. uniform and start making public. his civic action ideas. In

/> addition, he again advised him to go peracually to Washington



| AAI intends to dedicate ba ieeye ns ‘Tride:

to talk directly with VAUGHN and other vy, 8. officials to get
the picture cleared up, 4/1 said, “Let's try to get along
with the Norteamericans, it's better to have them with us

than against us." SOMOZA agreed, but said he had sent his:
brother, Luis SOMOZA, ahead.

h. Te following day, 19 Aug, General SonozA.
called A/1 and said Luis had called hin, reporting he had .
talked to Vaughn in Miami. Said Vaughn had denied talking to
Sydney ROSS or of Passing such infcration to the Ambassador 7
in Panama. Luis said he dropped the subject at that Point and ‘i
talked about other things. (A/1 believes iuis could be
fabricating as usual or could have botched up the interview if
it did take place.) A/1 again strongly recommended that General
SOMOZA make his own visit to Washington and talk to Vaughn and
others in person.

later he directed his activities in the fight against General
BATISTA, going in the Sierra Maestra where he was apointed Lieu-
; tenant by Major Humberto SORI-MARIN,

7 He was appointed Lieutenant because of his friendship with
*: Major SORI-MARIN, because he was catholic, and because of the lack
of trained persons in the Sierra Macstra. .
There are more news on Dr. Manuel ARTi#E Buesa when he
Published the open letter in the newspaper "Avance" denouncing
after he left Cuba,

while in Exile in Mexico.

In answering, the CASTRO Regime accuses him of having stolen
funds from the Cooperative of which he had charge. This was
certified by his friend Major Humberto SORI-MARIN,

: When he arrives in the USA, that is in Miami, Florida, he is
& guest of Mr. Ricardo LORIE and Mr. Michael YABOR. E

Nevertheless, he continues to look for support and tries with
the BATISTA sector, maintaining reunions with MUJAL, Chile MENDOZA

and Engineer BADIA.

The plans of the Council are being completed as far as the

tries and obtains the support of the following persons: | Col.

ANWORLD Meeting tn Mew York, 6 October 1964
SUBIECT: ANTORID Contingency Plans

1, AMJAVA-4 said that AMBIDDY-1 was very enthusiastic
about the ANEIJEIRAS operation and felt this was the real
key to success of our program to overthrow the Castro
regime. He 1s prepared to concentrate on this operation
completely fur the immediate future,

2. I asked 4-4 if they had done any planning on the
Desie that the AMEIJEIRAS operation might not pan out. -
Be asked me directly whether-a decision had been mads to
@oatinue or to cut off support to AMWORLD, I told him
thst a decision had not beea made but that my Headquarters
was very interested in the outcome of the AMRIJEIRAS
e@peration on which he was working. He recognized the
importance of this operation and stated that he and 4-1 |
bad conjectured that future support to AMWORLD might be
@entingent on success or failure of their handling of
that case, I did not confirm or deny this point but’ told
Bim that the organization would surely be happy if they
were able to handle it with succ

3. A-4 then explained that he and A-1 had spent
considerable time discussing the future of their program
and their prospects vis a vis the Agency. He said
that in their opinion one of two things would happen;
@ither the AMEIJEIRAS operation would pay off in which
care they would be able to continue to operate with Agency
wuppert but with a diversion of major objectives or tie
Operation Would peter out, in which case they would have
%e consider what to do without Agency support. He
that A-1 was not only prepared to accept a diveraton of
primary objective but felt that present circumstances
Gictated the wisdom of such a move. However, both of
thea feel that their present paramilitary program must
be sontinued, not because it ia crucial to tho outcome
ef the Cuban situation, but because the strength which
they exhibit through these operations is tho only attrac-
tion to AMWORLD that has caused the AMEIJEIRAS group to
Gontact thon,

i



2

at 4. In case the AMEIJEIRAS operation fails to develop,

ané the Agency should decide to cut off support to AMWORLD,
a-4 says they will continue to try to operate as long os
they can. He said that instead of 200 people they night
be opersting with 20, but they could do something. So lon:
as they have the hardware with which to operate they cana

+ “ell” operations each time. For example, he said, they
would go to Cuban exiles, to Venezuela, to American.
businessmen, etc. and would tell thei The October sper-
ation will cost $25,000. If you will underwrite it we
w21l dedicate it to you and run it in your name.“ He
feels this would carry them for a few months provided they

5 d-4 said that when the support ran out the
hardware was all gone, and there was nothing left with
which to operate, A-1 would take 12 or 15 of his hard
core followers and go into the Eecambray in Las Villas
to make one last ditch effort. I asked him if A-1 felt
Be woul¢ have any chance of a success and A-4 stated that
@hould such a state come to pass, A-1 would definitely
@0 Sn with the expectation of being run down evertually
and shot but that he would do this in order to go out in
@ blaze of glory and to continues to serve as a martyr.
- ém@ said there was absolutely no doubt in his mind that
#1 vould follow this course, that he had a hero compulzion
and a martyr complex and was completely without fear of death.
. ée@ again mentioned an idea held A-1l that he will not live
c pase 29 January 1965 (his birthday) because he ia convinced
it he is destined to reach the peak moment of his life .
during his 33rd year (as did Jesus Christ) and does uot
expect to live beyond that time.

6, I asked A-4 where he, »+:conally, stood in suck a
future undertaking. He said that he was no hero but he had
@edicated seven years of his life as a schoolboy and young
. Sea to Cuban independence, and hc sould not stop now. He
would not go in deliberately to die as a martyr, but he would
° @ontinue with his work doing the best he could with whatever
 geans he could come by. He stated, "A-1 igs not such @ laade?
* g@m@ Tony VARONA who can separate himself completely from she
e@truggie and go out to sell used car Ael cannot exics t¢
@ lige which. 2s routine and without
Gite firat even in a suicidal mission,

A-@ stated that

Teoual power. He will. .



3 Pa

he, himself, was of a different nature but that it would be
just as inpoesible for him te go to a routine type of work
and leave the work of liberation cé/ his country. .

7. 1% asked A-4 what AMWORLD would do if they vere
able to commence operations again, He said they had two
targets on the north coast trav they would like to hit
when they have another chance. Cae is Puerto Vita, the other
fie Manati. They have target studica on Puerto Vite and have
just recruited a refugee from Manati who knows the area
thoroaghly and brought out a large number of photographs -
ef the target with him from Cuba. Unfortunately some of
thes were confiscated by U, 8, Customs when he cane through
Miami, but there were still enough remaining to plan an
operation. He asked if we might be able to help recover the
eonfiscated photos. I told him that if approval to recommence
eperations was given, I was gure we could do so. In the
geantine, I was, of » not authorized .o discuss possible
fature operations but/interested in what ANWORLD was thinking
@long these lines, A-4 ‘understood our position with the .
@urrent suspension of operations.
