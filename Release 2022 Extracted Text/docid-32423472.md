Liberty, Indiana. The ZIP on that is 47353.

Mr. Johnston. And you retired from the Army as
Lieutenant Colonel, is that right?

Mr. Hubbard. Right.

Johnston. With military intelligence?
Hubbard, Military intelligence.
« Johnston. How long had you served in the Army?

Mr. Hubbard. At the time of my retirement I had 22 years,
six months, 15 days, something like that.

Mr. Johnston. And when did you retire?

Mr. Mubbard. 31 March 1973.

Mr. Johnston. What branch were you in in the Army?

Mr. Hubbard. Military Intelligence at the time of my
retirement.

Mr. Johnston. Were you connected with operations
directed at Cuba for Army intelligence?

Mr. Hubbard. Yes.

Mc. Johnston. And would you briefly describe the tine
period you were involved with those operations and the purpcs.
of the operations?

Mr. Mubbard. All right. This is fairly approxinate.

Senator Schweiker. | What does that mean, the

Mx. Hubbard. We were broken down into teams. That was my
geographic area of responsibility.

Senator Schweiker. Detachment A meant those
countires?

Mr. Hubbard. No. Detachment A had a worldwide mission,
very small, very select group at that time, working directly
for the Chief of Staff, the Assistant Chief of staff for
Intelligence.

Senator Schweiker. Of which, Army?

Mr. Hubbard. Of Army, yes, sir.

Senator Schweiker, Do you know offhand, did this ultimanully
go up the chain of command to a Lansdale in Operation MONGOOS’
above you, now? I realize we are guing above your staff.

Mx. Hubbard. I understand General Lansdale was briefed
on some of my material. I personally never briefed the
General. I amsure that someone out of the Pentagon, Detachi
A or the ACSI staff passed this information on. I was told

informally General Lansdale had seen some of the reports.

Senator Schweiker. Okay.

Mr. Johnston. What was your mission from the Puerto Rican
station?

Mr, Hubbard. Insofar as Cuba, we responded to requiremenc
We never unilaterally initiated an operation. We responded
to requirements. My first involvement with the Cubans was in
response to a requirement that picked up intelligence rumors
about a frogman operation against a Soviet sugar ship in
Sago La Grande Harbor, Cuba, and which there was something
unusual about this ship. ‘This was immediately following ua:
British commander, Crabb, as I recall.it, being =~ his body
being found a few days after attempting to investigate a
Soviet ship in London. liis body was found in shreds.

guerilla group which was'knowa:as the Second Front of the
Escambray, through a period of several weeks and, you know, the
dark meetings andwwhatever,

I was directed’to meet'one of the leaders of the Second
Front in Miami, ‘We went to a Cuban safe house. There I was
introduced to a leader, Luis Guitterez Menoyo. After some
seven hours of discussion, he agreed to let me interview this
frogman, but I had to agree to go by boat, blindfolded. At
that time I was not permitted to leave and go back and call the!
and get permission. I had to make a decision whether to
go or no go. So I did. I agreed. I was blindfolded. We
made a black entry out of Miami, past Immigration and Customs.
They kept me below deck so I couldn't see the compass.

We ended up on a small Island that 1 determined was
right off of Andros Island. They had a small base camp in
a former Portuguese sponge fisher village. ‘The only thing
left was the concrete tanks and rodf, They used the roof to
provide cover from aerial surveillance.

1 interviewed the frogman, got the starz, came back
some ten days, 12 days later, as I recall, The Washington
community was flapping, where is Hubbard, at this point. Th.
report was favorably received, as I recall, and I was directe:

to maintain contact.

This Guitterez Menoyo never spoke English in my presence.

‘aldo had a’ feeling he:was nota’ nan to he teusted..’ Hokaver, he
had a second in command,and I'm not sure of the name now --
Iwas trying to think of it -~ Hueget. Ralph was his first
name. He was allegedly a graduate of Georgia Tech. architec-
tural school, a very sharp young man, and I dealt primarily
with him because of the language barrier.

I was sent to Puerto Rico station because of French, to
work Haiti, and between French, arm and hand signals, and
English, I could communicate with Cubans.

But working with Hueget, they wanted us to support them,
us being the United States intelligence community.

I should regress. Although I was operating under a
pseudonys, I very definitely let them know that I was military |
as opposed to CIA because CIA had had the flap on the Bay of |

Pigs. Menoyo had had many of the pecyle the CIA had trained

in the parachute school out on the Bay of Pigs thing, and they

were very bitter, quite bitter. So I let them know that 1

was military support. Well, through negotiations, with sapproy

at the Washington level, we agreed to supply them small

arms, ammunition, rations and medical supplies in exchange for

permitting me to organize an intelligence net within their

unit, to send agents into Cuba to develop a net within Cuba.
This was progressing quite well. I had picked this

Hueget as the team chief, to be the resident agent in Cuba,



North” Carolina, ! to.Miami.

I advised the Second Front of this. Everyone re¢eived the
news quite welcomely, In approximately two weeks I got the
word that no, we would no longer support them, to advise them,
and then I was placed in the awkward situation of saying

I told them we cannot support them, but maintain our good
relations.

As a sad note, the night that I advised them of it,
one of the Cubans became a little excited and pulled a knife
and proceeded to rip up a beautiful new sportcoat I had.

Senator Schweiker. Did you yet reimbursed for that?

Mr, Hubbard. No, sir. I filed a voucher, and never
heard about it.

I maintained this contact at a much lower profile.
would have nothing really to do with us sincer we would
not support them.

Came up, and again, yentlemen, I do not know the
frame, President Kennedy decided that not only would we
support them, but he wanted them stopped, and physically s
because I had made two trips out there was the base can,
the smaller islands off the coast of Cuba where we had e372!
caches and supplies.

well, I.was burned, to use an intelligence term:

They evacuated my family out of Puerto Rico and I was
December of '63. I had this one subsequent contact in approxi-
mately January or February of '64 when I was directed to go
to Miami to turn over Huccet. to a member of the Miami
team and make a personal introduction.

Senator Schweiker. And who was that contact with, the new

Mr. Hubbard. ‘Yes, sir, and sir, I am not sure, but I

think I turned him over to a Captain Stein, David E. Stein,

Senator Schweiker. Did you have dealings with other
groups than the Second Front of Escambray?

Mr. Hubbard. Not of any significance, sir. That was
primarily my unit. I met the leader of Alpha 66 on a one
time, personal introduction basis, Veciana, I had no dealing
with Alpha 66. There was a condlict between the Second Fro.
of the racanbray and the Alpha 66. They were both recruitins
men, support and money, and there was a rivalry between the
two, each accusing the other of being pro-Castro, but misleas.:.}
the American public.

Senator Schweiker. Well, you were financing in some way

the Second Front of the Escambray, in other words, paying tie:

Senator Schweiker. That was it?

Mr. Hubbard. That was about it.

Senator Schweiker. Well, who was doing a similar thing to
Alpha 667

Mr. Hubbard. As I recall, Alpha 66 was the bailiwick of
CIA, but they let Army nibble on the edges at the Miami station
I think Miami had received words of hands off of Alpha 66. Now
I may be mistaken.

Senator Schweiker. ‘They said it was an Army operation.

Mr. Hubbard. Well, if that is the case, it would go
into the Miami station, and that was commanded by Duke Wat)
Junius, J-u-n-i-u-s, Watlington, W-a-t-l-{-n-g-t-o-n.

Senator Schweiker. What was his position at that time?

Mr. Hubbard. He was the station chief, Miami station chie
for Army.

Senator Schweiker. If it wasn't the CIA, as you thought
it might have been, why do you think it was the CIA station
ahat might have had Alpha 66?

Mr. Hubbard. Well, it would have fallen under his
jurisdiction, yeographic responsibility, sir.

Mr. Hubbard. Well, we often had dual coverage of
a country.

Senator Schweiker. Do you remember a person who might have
sed the cryptonym Bishop? that might have had some dealings
with Alpha 66 or Veciana, Morris Bishop?

Mr, Hubbard. No, sir. Most of us at that time, for
security reasons, we knew each other in pseudoname. Very
few of us knew each others' true name. But we had a man whose
true name was Bishop, but that was subsequent, I am reasonably
sure.?

Senator SChweiker. lle was an intelligence officer, you

of Detachment A, as I recall.

I recall Bishop, his name was Lynn, L-y-n-n, Major or Lieutesa

in Panama.

Do you recall did he look anything like that?

Mr, Hubbard. No, sir, he was bald,

Senator Schweiker, Okay.

Does that ring a bell with you on any peripheral contacts
you might have made during this period of time with anybody,
possibly somebody in the arms business supplying arms to the
exiles?

Mr. Hubbard. No, sir, but you mentioned arms. We had
Castro's fois.r Ambassador to London and Castro's first
Minister of Finance that was my source, Burns, William Burns,
carried dual citizenship, British and Cuban, He was Fabri
Nationale's arms representative in Latin and South America.

Senator Schweiker. They were out of Belgium, were they?

Mr. Hubbard. Yes, sir, Fabrique Nationale,

Senator Schweiker. Does he look anything like that?

Senator Schweiker. Lykes?

Darnell, D-a-x-n-e-1-1, a beached captain?

Mr. Hubbard. He was a bona fide ship's captain, but he
was on the beach. -

Mr, Epstein. Was he working for you, Darnell?

Mr. Hubbard. fle was a source of mine. As I recall, he
was born in 1908 in Colorado. He was married to a Cuban
woman, I think perhaps because of health reasons, Lykes
Steamship line took him fTom the ocean-going vessels, and mage
him their Puerto Rican chief. He was in charge of Lykes
Steamship.

Senator Schweiker. How do you spell that?

Mr. Hubbard. Lykes, L-y-k-e-s. It is a large steamship
line here in the United States.

Senator Schweiker. You're saying it is similar. You ary

across the eyes, yes, sir. I am not saying that it is, but
that is the only one that I can come up with.

Alpha 66 or Veciana?

Mr, Hubbard. | Sir, he very possibly did, ‘when Vecdana
would come to Puerto Rico, he would definitely contact Darnell.
I think that he stayed at Darnell's on occasion. That I cannot
say for sure, but my belief is he did.

Senator Schweiker. Is he -- do you know where he is
located now?

Mr. Hubbard. No, sir. The last I know he was in Puerto
Rico, San Juan.

Mr. Epstein. Is there any other name he went under?

Mr. Hubbard, No, sir.

Epstein. Was there a code name that he used?

Mr. Hubbard. No. We did not assigne pseudonames for
spotters. There was no requirement, They were not operational

Senator Schweiker. Tell me what you mean by a spotter.

Mr. Hubbard. All right, sir.

The operational cycle, the people in the field get a
requirement that has been generated at the national level, they
want to know something about a country. It gets down to the
field. Now, we take it and say, all right, who has got access,

who can get it. Well, most of us have spotters. We have

might he have set up some contacts, say, with Alpha 66 before

Senator Schweiker. Did you ever hear of a Cuban intelli-

name in the Second Front that was allegedly a double agent of

, (Senator Schweiker
nennedy at the tins, what his feelings ‘were?

Mr. Hubbard. Well, because of his closé involvement with
the Cuban situation, he was quite disappointed when the United
States policy would not support the guerilla movements anymore,
and especially when they had to police them:up out of the
Caribbean. I was burned on. He thought we were definitely on
the wrong track.

Mr. Epstein. How were you burned on that? How were
you personally burned on that?

Mr. Hubbard. Because I was the only American who had bees
to all of the base camps, and it had to come from me.

Mr. Epstein, So you were the guy that was giving the
message.

Mr. Hubbacd. I was the guy that drew the map for
President Kennedy, Colonel Boydt, and I believe Mr. McCone
briefed President Kennedy, or General Fitch, as I recall, +
the ACSI, and they took my map in and President Kennedy w.
quite happy. Mr. McCone, I believe it was Mr, McCone con~

his men as opposed to Army that had that degree of involveisc..:.,

I was burned and had to get out of there.

Mr. Epstein. Excuse my ignorance on this, but what I

levied on you to draw a map of where all the base camps were
that the Cuban exiles were operating out of.

Mr. Hubbard. Yes.

Mr. Epstein. That your understanding is that that map
was supplied to the British?

Mr. Hubbard. It had to be because they knew exactly
where to go from the Bahamas.

Mr. Epstein. And that thereafter the British, upoant'y
request of the American government, destroyed all the base
camps?

Mr. Hubbard. The British were involved. I don't know if
the United States Navy or Coast Guard was involved, 1 was ia
the process of evacuating my family and keeping them hidden.

Mr. Hubbard. When I came back, the word was down that

President Kennedy had decided not only would they not support
them, he wanted the means destroyed from which they were
mounting these raids.

Mr. Epstein. From where did you hear that? How did you
learn that?

Mr. Hubbard. Well, that was -- everything we got,

people had not received that degree of rapport after the Bay

Mr. Hubbard, General Fitch. Well, now, gentlemen, this
has been several years, but I believe it was General Fitch,
the Army ACSI, Colonel Boydt, the Commander of Detachment A,
and Mr. McCone, and I was told that President Kennedy and the
Attorney General Kennedy were present, the only two present

point in time that Darnell might have been working for one
of the other agencies?

Mr, Hubbard. Possibly. You see, we closed up the Puerto
Rico station in just a matter of months after I pulled out.

In early '64, the Department of the Army closed out the
Puerto Rico station, and it was dormant for several years, and
then they re-established it.

Now, all of our coded assets, coded sources would have bee!
up for grabs to any intelligence community that wanted to
register operational interest in them, Now, as late as three
years ago, I passed his name on to Navy intelligence as a
possible source for them to look up in Puerto Rico. Now,
whether they did, maybe he was under operational dAterest. to
another agency and theréfore could not gain access to him, I
don't know. I recommended that they contact him,

Mr. Epstein. Who in Navy intelligence did you deal with
three years ago, do you know?

Mr. Hubbard, This was the Navy rap in Defense Intelligencd

My. Hubbard. Social, As a géneral observation, the better
educated Cubans and the professional Cubans, when they left
Cuba, did not come to the United States, or did not come to
Miami. They went to Spain, Puerto Rico, South America. We gor
the cane cutters into Miami primarily. Your educated people,
those with money, we had quite a few of them come into Puerto
Rico and later really take over. Within a year they were
Presidents of firms and now Darnell, by virtue of being m.

both in Cuba and San Juan, I'm sure their paths have crossed.
