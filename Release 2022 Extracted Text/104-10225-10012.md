AGAIN AKSING AMCHALKIS TO COME TO CONSULATE OR CALL HIM SO THEY

AMWOLF/I WOULD CHANGE HIS POSITION NOW. AMCHALK/S BELIEVES WE SHOULD

WAIT A FEW DAYS BEFORE ATTEMPTING ANOTHER CONTACT EITHER BY ANOTHER

WITH SECOND MEETING UNLESS HQS DESIRES CONTRARY. BELIEVE WE

Greetings,

L.

I belicve that our chances for

success in this

operation are reasonably good for the following reasons:

(a) A'CHAlK-s is sufficiently courageous to mect A!HOLF-1

in the Cuban Anbassador's office in Madrid, if necessary;

(0) A kOlF-l is a trusted colleague and follower of

AMCHOST-1.

For this reason and in the belief that A'GHOST-I

was awaiting the message,

he would find a way to deliver the

message
