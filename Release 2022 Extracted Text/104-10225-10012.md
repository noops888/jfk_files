3. ANCHALK/S COMMENTED TO CASE OFFICER THAT KE DID NOT THINK

AMWOLF/L WOULD CHANGE HIS POSITION NOW. AMCHALN/S BELIEVES WE SHOULD
WAIT A FEW DAYS BEFORE ATTENPTING ANOTHER CONTACT EITHER BY ANOTHER
MEETING OR TELEPHONE CALL. STATION AGREES WE SiOULD WAIT A Few
DAYS-BUT THAT A TELEPHONE CALL SKOULD PRECEDE auY MEETING. “IF THE
TELEPHONE CALL PRODUCES A CONTINUED NEGATIVE REACTION, WOULD NOT PROCEED
WITH SECOND MEETING UNLESS HOS DESIRES CONTRARY. BELIEVE WE
WILL GET SOME REACTION FROM QUTINID IN THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS.
ANOTHER FACTOR IS THAT AFTER THE ENCOUNTER, AMWOLF/1 WENT TO THE

confirmed what I told AMCHALK-5 orally concerning the amount
of money that could be offered AMWOLF-1 for his defection cr

TIME AND PLACE: Minmi, 3 and 4 OCTOBER

1, I mot AMCHALK-5 at 1430 hours at the Rusty Pelican
Restuarant. I told him wo would like to have him travel
immediately in ordor to arrive in Madrid by 9 October. AMCHALK-5
said he could make it with no problem, ilv wasn't sure his wife
would be able to go on such short notice, but that didn't matter.
I briefod him on the contact arrangewents sent from Madrid and
described WIBALDA to him. I told. him WIBALDA'S name is "ROBERTO,"
AMCHALK-5 said he would make the 0930 hours contact on 10 October,
but of course if somothing goes wrong that he will go to all
the alternate meotings. Ho will be woaring a white sports
Jacket, white shirt, blua tie, blue slacks and black shoes.

2, I told AMCHALK-5 that WIBALDA would have tho letter
for AMGHOST-1 for hia to take to the meeting, and I told hin
4gain not to use the letter unless his recruitmont pitch had
no results. If he does pass the letter, I suguested that he
flex it to prove to AMWOLF-1 that it does not contain a bomb.

3. I told AMCHALK-5 that it looked good for a surprige
contact with AMWOLF-1 on 10 October sami because ho would bo
going to lunch with a woman not connected with his office.
AMCHALK-5 wos pleased to bear this sad because he feels he must
maxe the coutact unannounced for it to be effective, Be said
that if the October 10 contact was missed, there would probably
be another luncheon the following week, AMCHALK-5 is willing
to stay in Madrid as long as necessary. ,

4.  AMCHALK-5 was sorry to hear that I won't be going to
Madrid because he wants to be sure that he 1a given as much
flexibility as possible, and not torced to handle the approach
in a manner that he would not be comfortable with, I told him

Be flaw wae ISS

that VIBALDA underatood tho uituation, and that I was sure tt
woulé all go well. AMCHALK-S aswured me that he has no inton-
tien of letting himself got into & physically dangerous situation

bac iefore tH PACHANKIS 16, I said we would vant to debrief
bin tg Miami and that. either I would see him or PACHANKIS would,
I eaid that 12 PACHANKIS talks to him, be can tell PACHANKIS tho
conplets details of the operation unless I phoned him otherwise,

%. We arranged to meot again at 1900 hours when AMCHALK-6

hours on 10 October.

7. I wished AMCHALK-5 good luck. He 1g much more optemistic
about bigs chances with AMWOLF-1 than I am, but 1t 14s good to work
with 4 man with enthusiaam, Just in case AMCHALK-5 should be
successful, we should be prepared to support him. I suggest that

7. The message to AMCHALK-S follows:

M.

We arranged to meet "PUSHKIN" recently but
you apparently called the meeting off. We can
understand your hesitancy to meet with us in that
place and at that time, We do, however, wish to
meet with you anytime, any place of mutual agree-
ment via any secure channel of your personal
confidence. As you can sec, in this instance,
we have selected un officer whose loyalty to
you is unquestioned. We intended to tell
“PUSHKIN" of possible pitfalls in your path.

We still wish you to know of these dangers.
We realize that you are a true revolutionary
in every sense of the word, We have no

TO REVIEW AND LAY PLANS FOR OPERATION OF REF. AMCHALK-5

EAGER TO UNDERTAKE EFFORT TO EITHER (A) MAKE SELF ATTRACTIVE
TO DGI FOR DOUBLE AGENT PYRPOSES OR (B) PARTICIPATE IN POS-
SIBLE OPERATIONS FOR RECRUITMENT AND DEFECTION OF DGI PERSONNEL

DEPENDENT UPON HOW MEETINGS GO IN

2. FOLLGWING IS EXPLANATION WHICH AMCHALK-5 WILL PROVIDE

DGI OFFICER AS EXCUSE FOR REINITIATION OF CONTACT, I.E. THAT

HE TOTALLY DISILLUSIONED WITH ACTIONS OF U.S. GOVERNMENT VIS-
A-VIS CUBA, THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, AS IS WELL KNOWN IN THE
MIAMI AREA, HAS TERMINATED ALL OF ITS MILITANT ACTION CAPABILITY
AGAINST CUBA, AND THAT HE HIMSELF HAS BEEN DEFINITIVELY TERMI-
NATED. THIS WILL BE MOST PLAUSIBLE TO DGI SINCE THEY UNDOUBT-
EDLY AWARE OF TALK IN EXILE COMMUNITY OF MASS TERMINATIONS.
AMCHALK-5 WILL THEN EXPLAIN THAT SINCE THE U.S. GOVERNMENT
CANNOT BE COUNTED ON FOR ANYTHING HE HAS TAKEN IT UPON HIMSELF

5. AECHALE-5 may aleo bo terminated within this

fizeal year, He has managed to develop a successful,
full-time business and is only slightly involved in
operational activity, Wo aro bolding off on his termination
bocause of the potentially intoresting operational situation
discussed in paragraph 12 of reference. ASCHALK-5 thinks
the black marketcers referred to may be on the vorge of
another trip to Miami, It might be interesting from the
JEROD standpoint to "piggyback" that channel and send in
an incriminating package to a DMOD target. AECHALE-5
@s the source of tho package is already well identified
through tho ANGHOST operation as affiliated with RVRCCK,
There are the two possibilities that tho couriers thomselves
would open the package, inspoct tho contents and turn the

te package over to the DSE or that they would deliver
it unopened to the target. In the latter case the target
might oither turn it over to the DBE, destroy it, or make
use of the contents for his own benefit, Content of the
package would of course have to be tailored to the target
but it might purport to be an agent re-supply cache.
Hany possible avenues would have to be explored; for the
Bonent we would appreciate consideration of the proposal
by tho Desk and JEROD staff, One of the first items to
be rosolved is whether or not there is an inherent "blow
back" feature of the situation which could cause too such
e@nbarraoserent if exposed to press play, Specifically,
is there a cage for an allegation that RVROCK was using

the international orgenization with which tho “couriors”
aro affiliated for "subversive" purposes? Tho ansver to
that question probubly lies somewhere in betweon vhat the
eontents of the package consists of and to what lengthy
tho Cubans would bo willing to go to “bura” the “loyal
eoarads”

couriers.

Answer to WH/Miami 3326 which won prompted by PAalS TSO

Ze hen AMBEDEH-1 was working fur the cowiter revolutionary
section, ha became acquainted with the case of the penetration of
Higuel Dize Isalgue's group.

2. In this operation, the Cuban DOI collaborator who acted a5
principal sgent was Horta Gonzalez, authoross of Bajo Porole. She cam
%o the United States og an exile in 1963 (more or less) and lived in
Misml. She wo handled by “Bolo” Martinez, Cuban BAG DOI Caso Officer
fin the United Hations who would see Marta in New York and Mandi.

3. Marte recruited two agents (at least), one of whom us o
wonan, He did not recall the sex of the other. She bad an “infinity?

organizations and intzo-murel exile politico. Ke does remember thet

Yerte was living in the house of the wonsn she reeruited. She used to

Marta Gonzales knew the places where the reception tean would

Marta Gonsaler knew the names of fishermen rho were members of

the reception team.
Morte Oonsales knew that Isalgue's Béo mother's house wae used

es a “oases de contacto” and that Comandante Guin was recruited by Isalgue
in the aother'a house.

5S. Gen Mismi #4 supply @ List of nemes of people close to Isalgue
to seo if AMBEDEW-1 can recall the agents names. AMEDEY-1 thinks there

4a gocd chance that they are still in ploce even though he tse no info.
6. Marta Gonsales is now beck in Habana. She left the country
via Hexioo and in Mexico was heljed by @ Foreign Relations employee named

More on Isalgue. Ho has one sistor in Habana, @ woman noned Sara. The DOT

suspects her of boing recruited ty Isalgue even though ANBEDEW-1 could not
substantiate this other than to oay that she wes the only brother or sister of
