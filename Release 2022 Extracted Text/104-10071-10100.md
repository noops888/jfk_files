indicates that the SDS was behind the student seizure
of Columbia University. It says, "Right now our
glorious brothers have seized Columbia University--
now named Malcolm X University--and over which an
N.L.F, flag now flies. The others, faculty, deans,
managers, are all scurrying and speaking pious--
saying SDS this, SDS that, while we hold five
= buildings in joyousness and the most serious {
preparations to resist, our movement has over reached."
Enclosed is a check made out against the account of
the SDS in the Chemical Bank New York Trust Company,
