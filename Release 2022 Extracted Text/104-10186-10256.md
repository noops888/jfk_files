Armando (Hatronymic unknowh) is probably tdentical with Armando
TORRES who is believes to be identical with Armando TORRES Mesones.
The main basis for this assumption is that al] have been identified
as aides to Raul CASTRO and it would scem unlikely that he would
have three aides with such Similar names. Also, as can be scen by
the following traces, their backgrounds appear to be similar in

most instances.

A usually reliablo source, in a report dated 29 September 1947,
stated that Armando TORRES was a member. of the Federacion Estudiantil

“Universitaria (University Students’ Federation - FEU) of the

National University, Habana, Cuba. He was involved in sending
letters to obtain aid in the campaign against the Trugillo "tyranny."

A fairly reliable source in a report dated 16 April 1948, said that
Armando TORRES was one of the persons personally contacted by
Vassili BOGATYREV and Ivan MISHINSKY in regard to the establishment

of a Cominform Bureau in Habana. Though TORRES was to work for the
Cominform, it did not, according to course, nccessarily mean he

was a Communist.

A fairly reliable source, in a report dated 7 May 1948, identified
Armando TORRES as a Cuban pro-Communist delegate to the Latin
Ameriéan Youth Congress held in Mextco in late April 1948. He was
an FFU representative to the Congress.

An untested source in a report dated 9 July 1958, said that Armando
TORRES, also referred to as uffalo Bill," claimed he was Cuban
born, but had studdéd in Spain and France.

In a report dated 11 July 1958, an unknown source listed the most
important people surrounding Raul CASTRO. Included was Lt. Armando
TORRE, an aide to CASTRO,.and described ag having been born in
Camaguey, studied in Paris, traveled to Spain and called "The
Frenchaan." In this same report an untested source said that
Armando TORRE, aka: “Buffalo Bill," was born in Habana about 1926,
was five feet six inches tall, 140 pounds, had black hair and an

olive complexion.

Two usually reliable sources, in a report dated 3 and 10 July 1958,
described Armando TORRES, an aide to Raul CASTRO, as a suspected
Communist: who had returned to Cuba from Spain and Hungary ten months
before. TORRES was identified as one of the persons responsible
for the rebel decision to atiduct American citizens in June 1958.
