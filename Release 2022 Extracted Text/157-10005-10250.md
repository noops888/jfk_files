for ANUTS?

Mr. Sarno. I think from December, 1961 or January, 1962
to September, 1967. Then from June -- August, 1968 to
September, 1969.

Mr. Wides. Now let ma go back, and can you give us a
very brief summary of your positions with the Agency prior to
that? I don't mean detailed as to what you were doing.

Mr. Sarno. I joined the Agency in Septembar of 1951.

Mr. Wides. Yes?

Mr. Sarno. I was assigned to three countries before I
hit Florida.

Mr. Wides. All in the Western Hemisphere Division?

Mr. Sarno. All in the Western Hemisphere.

Mr. Wides. So you had rather long stations in each of
those, three or four years?

Mr. Sarno. (Nods in the affirmative)

Mr. DeMarco. When did you become an American citizen?

Mr. Sarno. I was born in Ohio.

Mr. DeMarco. Had you been stationed with Mr. Phillips
in Cuba before you came to Miami, or were you in Cuba bafore
you came to Miami?

Mr. Sarno. Yes.

Mr. Wides. And that is when {Maz was the Chief?

Mr. Sarno. W\was the Chief.

Mr. Wides. And you had contact with Mr. Phillips then?

Mr. Wides. You never heard of any plots, nor of any
arrested people attempting to shoot a bazooka when he was
giving a speech at Havana Stadium?

Mr. Sarno. No, sir.

Mr. Wides. Let me go to the period when you went to
Florida.

When you first came here, that was before Station Chief
GesBraa moved the whole station to Miami?

Mrx Sarno. GNF wasn't there. When I arrived in Florida,

not then -- no, sir, he was not the statdon chief.

Mr. Wides. Who was the station chief?

Mr. Sarno. I don't think I should give you his name.
I don't know. YOu have the rest of all of them, but I can't
recall --
, I can state that there were two station chiefs between
CSB ana Shackley, three of them, in fact.

Mr. Wides. Shackley came in when, 1963?

Mr. Sarno. ‘62.

Mr. Wides. When in '62?

Mr. Sarno. I think the spring of '62 is when it was.

Mr. ides. When was he replaced by Mr. Dimmer?

Mr. Sarno. If I am not mistaken, it was in '64, I think.
June, July, I think, something like that, of '64.

Mr. Widas. And then Mr. Dimmer was replaced in '66 by

Mr. Wides. And then Mr. Esterline replaced Mr. @iitech
or was there someone between?

Mr. Sarno. Mr. Esterline did not replace Mr. [iSSRiy

Nobody replaced because they closed up the station.

Mr. Wides. We understand that the station was operating
very recently.

Mr. Sarno. Wall, I'm not saying -- you sae, the station
you spoke to before, you spoke of, went out of business in
June of 1960 when Mr. EEO ert.

Mr. Wides. I see.

Now, what was the relationship between yourself and the
station? Administratively, and in tarms of reporting, when
you first went down there.

Mr. Sarno. When I first went down there, I was outside.
I believe it was concerning clearances to get me into the
station, because I had never been working in a station before,
so there were special clearances. So at that time, those two
months you're speaking of, I attended a course and I may have
been sent_out once or twice to interview a Cuban refugee or
one of our agents who had left Cuba.

Mr. Wides. And then you set up the Gass vrosran? Did -
you start that project; or was that started when you came in?

Mr. Sarno. It had been started, the nucleus had been

formed at that time.

Mr. Wides. And except where there's a question a an
agent under cover who would be possibly exposed to harm or
that kind of thing in regard to the mention of other Agency
people, certainly at the level of Mr. Shackley or other
officials, Mr. Dimmer, and so forth, that the general Procedures
have been that people at the Agency or retirees have not
refused to disclose names.

Now, you certainly have your rights --

Mr. Sarno. No, sir. I am not questioning you, or anythind
except I've been in this business a long time and I've never
mentioned anybody's name. Now if somebody were to tell me,
if Seymour Bolton were to tell me that I could tell you all nell
names of all my supervisors and everything, it's perfectly all
right. But I've never mentioned a name and I feel that I
shouldn't mention a name.

Mr. Wides. Well, we may have to take a break and do that,
but let me go on.

With regard to the @iiig* program, the Pca Cubans were
not contract agents of the station, is that correct?

Mr. Sarno. No, sir.

Mr. Wides. They were proprietary employees essentially of
essentially?

Mr. Sarno. SEGED was a group -- that proprietary was
set up in September of 1968. Prior to that time they were a

bunch of Cubans just living down in Miami.

Mr. Sarno. Yes, sir.

Mr. Wides. And the program first operated where? Where
did you physically locate? Were you at the University of
Miami, at the Naval Air Station at the begining?

Mr. Sarno. No, sir.

Mr. Wides. Where were you at first?

Mr. Sarno. Are you speaking of our station? Our station

was physically at the

Yeuon, but these Cubans did not
know where the station was.

Mr. Wides. And you just contacted them separately?

Mr. Sarno. They had houses that they rented and they Geeed
out of different houses, and there were many of them, so I
can't recall them.

Mr. Wides. Did you have an office facility apart from the
station?

Mr. Sarno. Myself?

Mr. Wides. Yes.

Mr. Sarno. That was the station.

Mr. Wides. And what was the mission and purpose of
@EGES, when you first started out, as indicated in the project
outline?

Mr. Sarno. Thsy were to collect intelligence on Cuba,
debrief refugees and provide bodies for any possibile operations ["
i
required by the station.

Mr. Wides. They were to debrief refugees?

Mr. Sarno. Debrief refugees, collect and evaluate, maintai
records.

Mr. Wides. Was there a division of the {GS members into
two groups, with only a small group involving the debriefing
of Cuban refugees?

Mr. Sarno. Well, it wasn't too small a group, but if you
would speak of the whole organization overall, yes, it was a
small group.

Mr. Wides. And at what point did you set up any cover.:
apart from the station as a proprietary or notional company;
in between the QR people and the Miami station? In other
words, were the companies: prior to the Latin America Ggesm

company that preceeded it, in time?

Mr. Sarno. In the time that I handled.them, which is
up to the XSER, I think there were three, three covers all
told, or perhaps four. I think we had our debriefing, you

know, under one cover.

Mr. Wides. That was from the start? You had a separate
cover for the debriefing?
Mr. Sarno. Well, from the start we didn't have a place

for them, and it wasn't pulled together as a debriefing unit

When a large flow of refugees started to come in is when we set |

up the special unit.

Mr. Wides. When was that?

Mr. Sarno. Well, they cut off --

Mr. Wides. '64, '63?

Mr. Sarno. It could have been '62, late '62 or '63. And
before, we used to send our debriefers, they were within the
@QSy group, specialists in debriefing, area specialists is
the kind we used. And we would go out to the reception center
and check around and see who had come out of the particular
area.

Mr. Wides. At Opa-Locka?

Mr. Sarno. At Opa-Locka.

And our debriefers would go out and check around with the
people who came in and try to spot somebody who would be
interesting to interview, debrief, concerning the particular
area. And so they usually picked them up in a car and either
took them to a restaurant or took them to a motel or something
and would debrief them. And then we found that it would be
better to get a building for them to be in where we located

them altogether, where they could prepare their reports and

Mr. Wides. And so that's when you first set up the
proprietary for the smaller debriefing component of Ainge
Mr. Sarno. Well, I set up the proprietaries, the pence

company for a small debriefing office, and at the same time, |
|
|

we rented a building, a larger building, and they used to

operate in Coral Gables, received some publicity and we moved
them out of Coral Gables to near the airport in a building whers
the main office was, where this main office was, where these
reports from the debriefers or any other information was

collected would be processed, typed in finished form, translated
and provided to us.

Mr. Wides. About how many people did you have in

Cubans at that time?

Mr. Sarno. Well, that's difficult to say.

Mre Wides. 150? Would you say 150?

Mr. Sarno. I would say inside, outside, it could be
close to 150.

Mr. Wides. Did you have more than a dozen or so working
in the component on debriefing?

Mr. Sarno. As I recall, at one time -- as I recall it,
we had about 22, 23 people working in debriefing.

Mr. Wides. And apart from those Cubans, you had a staff
under you of assistants and secretaries who were Agency

assigned personnel?

ended up that there were one or two Intel assistants --

Mr. Wides. These were Agency personnel?

Mr. Wides. Now, the other, speaking very roughly, hundred
and fifty or so @@@g, Cubans, you said some twenty were
involved when the debriéfing program intensified. What were
the other hundred-odd Cubans involved in?

Mr. Sarno. Well, we had records personnel, we had
I would say six or seven who only worked in records and main-
taining of files, and general index cards, and that was it.
Then we had what we called our reports section which may have
had about fifteen people, twenty people, who wrote reports,
checked them out, cross-referenced, and everything else that
was involved in that.

Mr. Wides. What kind of reports did they write? What
were they writing reports about?

Mr. Sarno. Economic -- whatever they were learning from

against Cuba, and had weapons they weren't supposed to have.

Mr. Wides. Like Alpha-66?

Mr. Sarno. Alpha-66, there were many of them.

And we usually had one of our outside types, either
recruit or get next to an individual of the group and he would
penetrate the group himself to report to us what they were
doing.

Mr. Wides. Do you recall the flights of the Diaz, or one
of the Diz brothers, over Havana dropping leaflets?

Mr. Sarno. What date was it?

Mr. Wides. I believe it was quite early, and it was not
in connection with the @uidmss.

Mr. Sarno. I know the Diaz brothers.

Mr. Wides. Do you recall hearing of flights with +- one
of them with Frank Sturgis over Havana dropping leaflets?

Mr. Sarno. No, sir.

Mr. Wides. It was fairly widely known.

Mr. Sarno. Well, I didn't get into Cubans until maybe
it was June of '60, but the only leaflets I ever saw fly over
Cuba was_the day before the invasion. Those were the only
ones I saw.

Mr. Wides. When you were in Miami, did-you have any
contact with Frank Sturgis, Frank Fiorini?

Mr. Sarno. Never, never. To my knowledge, he never worked

for us.

Mr. Wides. Not getting back to the bulk of the Qji@a
group, apart from the reporting on refugees and the efforts
to keep tabs, which I guess is a summary of what you are
saying on what exile groups might be doing that the government
might otherwise not know about, is it correct that there was
surveillance of the Miami community generally with regard to
possible Castro agents?

Mr. Sarno. Not that I know of.

Mr. Wides. There was no counterintelligence program in
the aig

Mr. Sarno. We had a counterintelligence component in the
@QUESs Program.

Mr. Wides. Why don't you describe that?

Mr. Sarno. The counterintelligence program consisted of
very capable Cubans who knew of the former -- the set-up of
the intelligence agency inside of Cuba, so if anybody ware to
come out, any refugee were to come out and name an individual
that was a friend of theirs that we knew or suspected of
working for the internal security which was the DSE or their
external service, the DGI, our counterintelligence group or

one of the individuals would go out and debrief the fallow

and collect names, and prepare reports on it, and they maintainad

files, and that is what it is.

They never got under a surveillance of any of them, becausd

once a report was written they suspected somebody. They maintail

you would characterize it as surveillance or not; on people
who had already coma and were in Miami as distinct from the

anybody. It was to provide information to them because their
name would come up ‘somewhere in a case.

Mr. Wides. What kind of assistance? You mean more than
just a chance to interview them?

Mr. Sarno. No, just interview. They never used them to |
run a man on the street or anything like that, no, sir.
They tried to get one individual one time and they didn't know
that he worked for us and they tried to hire him and he came
back and reported it. We had to advise them that he was

already working for us.

Mr. Wides. And you had 115 men and:all-

Mr. Sarno. There tare women also, sir.

Mr. Wides. And women, and all thsy were doing was
interviewing refugees and writing reports on axile potential
activities against Cuba?

Mr. Sarno. I would say that was the biggest majority of
their job.

Mr. Wides. What was the rest of it?

Mrz Sarno. They also went out, if our station was going
to run an operation and they needed X amount of bodies, certain
specialized personnel, the @&UMS, would go and locate the
Personnel, talk to them, spot them, get their personal history
from them, send it in, and the;people would be traced out and
checked and cleared and eventually introduced to the station

case officer who would use them in our operations.

Mr. Wides. Who arranged for the training at the training

station at (?), was that used?

Mr. Sarno. For whom?

Mr. Wides. When the Qi, people received training, some
various kind of tradecraft, who would arrange that, yourself?

Mr. Sarno. December, 1961 when I took it over there were
only three cases of EES who were sent away for special
training. Three cases, three individuals.

One came here to Washington, the other was going to be
loaned to a station overseas. He came up and received training
The majority of the training given to the QW} was down in
Miami, Florida.

Mr. Wides. And what kind was that?

Mr. Sarno. Basic tradecraft, reports writing --

Mr. Wides. Did they ever get training in surveillance?

Mr. Sarno. Yes, they received training in surveillance.

Mr. Wides. Why did they get that?

Mr. Sarmo. Well, that is part of their program of
training them as a group.

Mr. Wides. Even though there was no use of them for
surveillance purposes?

Mr. Sarno. I do not recall, sir, ever.sending them out
on a surveillance.

Mr. DeMarco. Who conducted the training?

Mr. DeMarco. From Washington?

Mr. Sarno. Yes.

Mr. Wides. You say the majority of the training was in
Florida. What period are we talking about, throughout the
period?

Mr. Sarno. It could be spread over. Reports writing,
for instance, when the Agency, or when the station was being
cut back in personnel, this group used to produce tons of
reports, and when our station was being cut, the staff was
being cut, I convinced the Chief of Station into having the
reports officers, for instance, trained to prepare reports
which would require very little editing or preparation once
it arrived in the station, which would take a load off the
station, and it was agreed to.

Mr. Wides. You arranged in general for the training or
the training office?

Mr. Sarno. I never trained. j

Mr. Wides. But they worked through you Danitiseeadigeaye

Mr. Sarno. Yes.

of that one year there, and also I must ‘state that although I

Mr. Wides. There were some new people coming in?

Mr. Sarno. Yes. Some of the people would move, they got
a job that paid them more, but there were very few that came
in after the original, say about 1964 I would say it was well
astablished and very few dropped out or were taken aboard there-
after. |

Mr. Wides. They all got what you referred to earlier as
basic tradecraft training?

Mr. Sarno. No, not all of them.

Mr. Wides. How many?

Mr. Sarno. There were very few of them. in the original
group. I never had them trained in basic tradecraft. The
original group which I took over which, if I am not mistaken,
was about eighteen of them, and I understand that prior to
the Bay of Pigs --

Mr. Wides. Eighteen in @@@ySor eighteen in training?

Mr, Sarno. Eighteen in Q§@#p all told.

I understood that prior to the Bay of Pigs these Quy
had been given basic tradecraft training. I never once sent
them out _to receive basic tradecraft training.

Mr. Sarno. No, sir, no, sir.

Mr. Wides. And to your knowledge it was only report
writing?

Mr. Sarno. Well, they trained them in each one of the
sections, and I didn't train the debriefers, so if a new man
was hired and he was put in a debriefing, he was trained u
usually by the Chief of the Debriefing Group,-he was put in
there to work along with other debriefers to catch onto the
thing.

Mr. Wides. Now your testimony with regard to surveillance
training, who issued that, or how many people?

Mr. Sarno. If I am not mistaken, it was four or five.

Mr. Wides. When you first came, or shortly therafter?

Mr. Sarno. Yes, it was all at the -- now, now, just one
second, because I went in surveillance training myself.

I don't recall whether this four or five whom we trained
in surveillance were trained while I had them or they were
trained before I took them.

Mr.Wides. Now after that, those four or five, no other
GQ people to your knowledge received any surveillance
training, is that your testimony?

Mr. Sarno. That is true, sir.

Mr. Wides. What about picks and locks?

Mr. Sarno. Nobody.

Castro agents?

Mr. Sarno. No, sir, they never did.

that when Dimmer came down and brought the fellow, I never saw
the traffic anymore, but during the period that I was looking

personnel as distinct from the station itself?

Mr. Sarno. None whatsoever.

Mr. Wides. They never came down and spoke to you?

Mr. Sarno. When I came out of Cuba, when I escaped from
Cuba, I was brought up here to Headquarters and debriefed, so
I imagine that the person that debriefed me, this is in July
of '61, I would imagine that individual was part of the Task
Force.

had not split the Task Force until the winter of 'fl, '62.

Mr. Wides. And when you came to Washington what kind of

was also the case officer, I used to travel and recruit people. |
I do not specifically recall ever being called to Washington to

Mr. Wides. But do you recall ever discussing the g

program and the Cubans in it while you were in Washington?

Mr. Sarno. Well, if I would come up on a trip and some of
the people who were sitting on a desk hare who were maintaining
the records al everything of the ages, I suppose, vas, they
would come around and discuss perhaps the budget or perhaps
get them to report in a different manner. TI recall on one
occasion discussing the set-up of 1 how the EGS group prepared
the debriefing reports, that they could remove the names from
it, instead of filing them inside the report, they put the
names on cards so they could be put into a computer machine
here.

Mr. Sarno. No, when they were in New York, if they went
to New York. ne
Mr. Wides. Well, let's go back.

The first question I was asking you was with regard to

your relaying to CIA personnel the fact that someone who had

been at QB in Florida was going elsewhere and you said that

that happened, and then I asked you -- we will come to the
operational relationships in a moment -- how frequently that
happened in regard to people coming to New York. For example,
I assume that there were a fair number of Cubans generally in
there for one or two members of EEG who went up to New York
during the course of all of these years.

Mr Sarno. No, sir, no, sir.

Mr. Wides. Would you say several dozen or a dozen?

Mr. Sarno. So far as I recall, there was only one that

ever went up there, and he in turn collected two or three of
|

his other friends around him who formed a little nucleus, but |
there was only one (G8 that went.

Mr. Wides. What about other cities? What other cities
do you gecall people went to?

Mr. Sarno. In the United States?

Mr. Wides. Yes.

Washington?

Mr. Sarno. No, sir. San Juan, Puerto Rico, and that's al

in the United States.

Mr. Wides. Do you recall discussing it?

Mr. Sarno. Well, yes, we did discuss it, obviously it

was discussed, because this fellow came up with a big thing
when they were going to bazooka the UN building.

Mr. Wides. Was this one of the Novo brothers -- or was
either of the Novo brothers in @QGD in Florida? 1 believe
this is the name of the two people who were arrested at the
time.

Mr. Sarno. No, the QM that was in New York is the one
that discovered the Plot and we informed the Bureau and the
Bureau moved in on it.

Mr. Wides. You informed the Bureau?

Mr. Sarno. We informed the Bureau of that shelling of
the UN, and it was the QU, this one GUND up there who got
the information.

Mr. Wides. And he relayed that to someone in New York, or

back, through b to you?

Agency and put into our communications channel, be it by
dispatch or by cable, I don't think they retained all of those

the time?

Mr. Sarno. No, sir.

If you give me a date that I know --

Mr. Wides. I believe it was ‘64,

Mr. Sarno. If it was early 1964, then Mr. Shackley was
there. If it was late 1964 when Dimmer came, then there was
another branch, so there were two branch chiefs.

Mr. Wides. Now did you relay this information, did you
say, to Washington, or directly to New York?

Mr. Sarno. Sir, I never handled communications.

Mr. Wides. Well, I didn't mean you --

Mr. Sarno. If I write it up, I give it to my branch chief
and my branch chief in turn sends it out. But to me, it would
seem logical, knowing communications, that we would send the
cable directly to New York with info to Washington.

Mr. Wides. Were you ever told that communications had
been made to New York? You said before --

Mr. Sarno. They wera on Cuban exiles, groups, collection

New York City.

Mr. Wides. Was it your impression at the time that this
group had no contact with any CIA offices in New York?

Mr. Sarno. Which group, sir?

Mr. Wides. The group that this fellow Enrique had.

Mr. Sarno. Had no contacts with anybody else?

Mr. Wides. You weran't curious, or did you ever inquire?

Mr. Sarno. Well, I would believe it to be that they were
not in contact with anybody up there, because if the report

report that they had passed this information on.

Mr. Sarno. That's what I was speaking of. Many reports
that came there after, they would have indicated that it had
been passed, and I don't recall ever reading a report from
them that he had passed the information on to any contact up
there.

Mr. Wides. Do you recall any instance in which the
Agency asked, through you, and in turn through Gag that
particular people in New York be watched or investigated? :

Mr. Sarno. No, sir.

Mr. Wides. How would they decide what groups or what
individuals te penetrate or keep under surveillance?

Mr. Sarno. Well there were the active groups. This
fellow used to come down to Miami and he would talk to ae

are talking about collecting money, about a supposed operation,

how much money are they getting for it --

Mr. Wides. Whare would he get that information from, from
you?

Mr. Sarno. Get what?

Mr. Wides. Where would get that --

Mr. Sarno. The MI group knew more about what was going on

in Cuban operations in the Miami area than we did, so most of

the information we obtained was through them.

Mr. Wides. So how would he get the information about
potential targets in New York?

Mr. Sarno. Because they had the groups down in Miami
Penetrated, so in Miami, these groups in Miami, would discuss
their contacts with the splinter group sitting up in New York
and the information would come about.

ree Wides. You never got any written instructions or
oral instructions when you were in Washington or Miami to isee I.
if you could arrange for this person to get information on
people in New York?

Mr. Sarno. Never. Never once.

Mr. Wides. What about picketing in New York by Cuban
personnel? There's some reference to that in testimony we've
already received.

Mr. Sarno. There is one incident of the Mexico -- I think
it was against tava where they went to an affair or something
and threw out leaflets. i

Mr. Wides. What about picketing of an airline company or
an airline office?

Mr. Sarno. I heard that that took place, but I was not
in Miami at the time. I was away on a trip.

personnel?

origins of the picketing? How would it come about?

Mr. Sarno. Well, I don't believe it was started, I know
it wasn't started in QMS because one individual cannot start
it, but the groups, the Cuban exile groups who were located in
New York decided to picket it because, I believe, of Mexico's
Yelations with Cuba.

Mr. Wides. At this time, wasn't the Agency «carrying on

a wide variety of operations to try and isolate Cuba economical]

and commercially?

Mr. Sarno. I believe they were, ‘yes. I was never involve

in any of those operations.

Mr. Wides. And including air traffic people, airlines
going to Cuba. That was one aspect of the efforts. to isolate
Cuba.

Mr. Sarno. Well, the airlines going to Cuba, if I
can recall at that time, were not Mexican airlines.

Mr. Wides. You didn't have any idea at the time as to
what --

Mr. Sarno. Mexican airlines do not fly to Cuba. The
Cubans always flew their airplanes over. The Mexicans were
not flying.

Mr. Wides. So you understood this to be harrassment of
a Mexican Company’ or a Mexican national company, because of
Mexico's general relations with Cuba?

Mr. Sarno. Nobody ever suggested that the Agency was the
one who backed the people who did the picketing, no.

Mr. Wides. Now was there a time when @@i@j personnel who

in Puerto Rico with the attendant Cuban exile groups, and it
was the same thing as was going on in New York. They would
collect data on what these groups were doing, operations that
they were preparing, funds that they were collecting, et

Mr. DeMarco. For tha record, I think I should explain to
you that we are highly interested in the sort of activities
that you were involved in in Cuba in 1960 and '61, but our
investigation has to a certain point been slowed down by the
inability to obtain the right kinds of documents and that
being the case, and your insistence here on not answering
certain questions, will require us to simply have you come
back once we have cleared this up with your superiors at the
Agency and once thay have been more forthcoming with documents
that were long ago requested about your activities.

I don't want to pursue just suspicions with you, I'd
rather talk to you about specific dates-and facts.

We are going to pursue this very vigorously, and the
reason I'm intsrested in it is the gambling background, and
I would like to know your training in that area, your experienc¢
in that area and tha reasons why you wera down there.

I had to scrounge around in different ways. w had a brother-
in-law who was a professional gambler. When I was a kid, he
died. He taught me a little about gambling, so I used to go
to the black jack tables and I would win money here, there and |
the other place.

Mr. DeMarco. Is this the hotel black jack tables
predominantly?

Mr. Sarno. No, they had black jack, roulette, they had
baccarat. I would go in there, I would make myself seen, they
would see that I was wearing good clothes and I was winning
Money at the gambling tables and that's it.

I am not to be tied into any Syndicate or anything like
it. I didn't know a single soul.

Mr. DeMarco. You knew no one?

Mr. Sarno. Nobody.

Mr. DeMarco. And your task then, which you learned on
arriving there, was to set up a network?

Mr. Sarno. To set up a network of agents in Cuba, yes.

Mr. DeMarco. So you started meeting people to do that?

Mr. Sarno. No.

We never meet people to do that.

Mr. DeMarco. Describe to me how you did it.

Mr. Sarno. People ware spotted by other individuals and

thay're checked out, and once they're checked out and their

me to handle and train.and what have you.

Mr. DeMarco. I see.

Were any of those Americans?

Mr. Sarno. No, I never spotted any Americans. There }
were two Americans over there who were already working, and they
were given to me to use as, to handle some of the other ones |
that were involved.

Mr. DeMarco. Were they also involved in the same type of
cover you were, gambling?

Mr. Sarno. No. They were not in the same cover. As I
say, it was a.cover provided by the Agency. It was. a cover I
just naturally stumbled into since I was going to the
different casinos and I was winning money there and I could
pass myself off as a tourist-gambler.

Mr. DeMarco. These other two Americans you were talking
about, can you name them?

Mr. Sarno. Well, I'll give you the name. One I would
name, because I was not involved with the other one very long.
One's name is Emelio Rodriquez, but he is dead now.

Mr. DeMarco. He was an American?

Mr. Sarno. Yes, he died of a heart attack. And the
other was Julian.

Mr. DeMarco. Julian?

Mr. Sarno. Julian. I don't recall the last name, but he

only remained for about two months after I arrived.

Mr. DeMarco. What were these two people doing in Cuba
prior to the time they were turned over to you and you met
them?

Mr. Sarno. Collection of intelligence.

Mr. DeMarco. For the Agency?

Mr. Sarno. Yes, for the Agency. They were agents of the
Agency, as was I. But they were residing in Cuba.

Mr. DeMarco. At any time while you were in Cuba, for that
matter, at any time, did you become aware of any Agency
relationships with -~- I'm going to use the term generically --
organized crime. Do you understand what I mean by that?

Mr. Sarno. Yes, certainly.

Mr. DeMarco. Whether or not organized, people who you've
read about in the paper, or you would consider to be involved
in that kind of business, are you aware of any relationships
between any Agency personnel in Cuba or elsewhere?

Mr. Sarno. None whatsoever.

Mr. DeMarco. During the period of time that you were in
the casinos, playing black jack and roulette and so forth, did
you get an opportunity to meet the people that were running
the casinos?

Mr. Sarno. No.

There was. one big Swede jn.the Capri that because it was

close to where I was living I would go in there more often, and|

as soon as I take off from my house, my apartment, I would
head over there and he was always seeing me in and offer me
drinks, but he was not a big wheel, he was just one of their
employees.

Mr. DeMarco. Where was this?

Mr. Sarno. At the Capri.

Mr. DeMarco. You say a big Swede?

Mr. Sarno. A big Swede, a blond-haired fellow. I didn't
even know his name, I'd just call him Swede.

Mr. DeMarco. Was he an American, or from Sweden?

Mr. Sarno. I think he was from America.

Mr. DeMarco. Were any of the peovle that you were
involved in handling in Cuba commercial or airline people?
Any airline people?

Mr. Sarno. No, sir.

Mr. DeMarco. Did any of them have official Cuban govern-
ment positions?

Mr. Sarno. Yes.

Mr. DeMarco. They did?

Mr. Sarno. Some of them did, those were the ones that
you were looking for.

Mr. DeMarco. I don't have anything more at this time.

Mr. Wides. I am just a little puzzled by your testimony
regarding the QE activity with regard to the Cuban community

15 into a place and see a friend and the friend says did you see

I'm not trying to twist your testimony, I know you referred
to the basic purpose being to keep tabs on what was going on
so you would be aware of what Alpha~66 and groups like that
were planning, but in. general, they were the eyes and ears of
the Station in the Cuban community and might come up with
counterintelligence information as well as the information
about the activities?

Mr. Sarno. Yes, sir, yes, sir.

Mr. Wides. And as you understand it on a smaller scale,
this was also true with regards to the group in New York?

Mr. Sarno. Yes, sir.

Mr. Wides. It was not simply to find out about Alpha-66,
but they would also report to the extent that they obtained
CI, that is counterintelligence information, about the Cubans
in New York?

Mr. Sarno. Yes, sir.

Mr. Wides. What about with regards to the activities at
the UN? Any reports regarding UN activity relative to Cuba?

Mr. Sarno. No, sir.

Mr. Wides. Was there a Cuban mission at the UN at this
time?

Mr. Sarno. Yes, sir.

Mr. Wides. And this group never relayed any information
regarding the Cuban mission or the people they contacted in

New York?

Mr. Sarno. No, sir.

Mr. Wides. Why wouldn't they have been used for that
purpose?

Mr. Sarno. Because that is the Bureau's domain. We never
checksd up on Cubans, the diplomats who were in the UN, nobody
was ever in contact with them, they never reported on any
Cuban diplomats in the UN or any of the Cubans seeing them or
anything.

Mr. Wides. Did you ever hear any stories whether they
were associated with 4&0ns, or. not.of Cuban exiles being
involved in any harrassment or surveillance of groups in
America friendly toward the Castro regime, such as the
Vinceremos Brigade and the Fair Play For Cuba Committee?

Mr. Sarno. No, sir.

Mr. Wides. You were not aware of any activity by exiles?
I'm not talking about necessarily QaUMS>

Mr. Sarno. Not of any activities.

Mr. Wides. You never heard anything?

Mr. Sarno. I never heard anything.

You're smiling. I'm telling you, I never heard anything.

Mr. Wides. What about Cubans in the late '60's after the
Vietnam War arose, being involved, Cuban exiles, in any
harrassment or surveillance of peace groups? What do you know
about that?

Mr. Sarno. Nothing.

Mr. Wides. Where would you get the information that‘ there
was a target of opportunity or someone to be debriefed in
another city?

Mr. Sarno. If the Q5iwm were to come up with the informa-
tion, if the iy were to come up with the information, he
would come in and report it and I would authorize him to go {
into that city and find him, because the information could
come in many ways.

See, they were known as tha Cuban municipalities and
operations in the city of Miami, and everybody that came out
from like a provinca or a state would register in it, and
as soon as they got information, the word would get around eae |
Joe Blow came in or something like that, and the word would get
back to the gis and the gous would say, wall, we should
discuss with this fellow, and that's it.

Mr. Wides. You never got any requests for Gap personnel
to be made available for that kind of task from Washington?

Mr. Sarno. To debrief an individual?

Mr. Wides. Or to travel in general.

Mr. Sarno. Yes, yas, they would come down and say, we

would like a person because Washington would hear of an

individual and would like for him to go over and debrief.

such, suggest send an Qo out to debrief.

Mr. Wides. Did you have a particular point of contact

you that would tend to be the ones sending you cables?

Mr. Sarno. No, I wasn't the Station Chief. The cables
come into the station, the Station Chief would pass it to me
