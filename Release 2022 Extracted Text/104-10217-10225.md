report, the evaluation, contact reports of uectings with
QRPHONE/1, a Feview of QRPHONE/1's book and some notes made

by the ‘STPLIMELAM Headquarters officer,

aiter his meetings with QRPHONE/1. These are for the information
of both LCPIPIT and London Station and, taken together, should give
you both the flavor of the variety of measures taken to assess the
operational potential of QRPHONE/1.

3. During INDY at Headquarters ve discussed the
necessity of having QRPHONE/1 undergo an intersive seven day
STFLIMFLAM training program to be conducted It is
our opiuion that in order for this training to be of maxinum
benefit, QRPHONE/1 ought to be ensconced in a
safehouse facility which provides security, comfort and an
atmosphere conduci' to learning. It is important that the
training be conducted in a locale which will allow QRPHONE to give
bis full attention without being disturbed by his multitude of

business and social contacts. Therefo: coumem: that LCPIPIT

. MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Hooting with QRPHONE/1

. *" 2, £ met with QRPHONE/1 for much of the 12th of July

- @nd wearing two hats. Wo first went through tho third phase
of the training exercise in which I had been playing the role
of an agent prospect whom he was to assess and recruit, aod then
later in the OTR safehouse I identified nysolf as the Headquarters
officer responsible for his project. Incidentally, he did an
excellent job in all three phases of the training exercise and
aid particularly voll on the recruitzent itself. QRPHONE/2 is
clever, imaginativo, has an excellent grasp of this espect of
tradecraft and handled himsolf particularly well ina 2 complex
eee ‘Changing training scenario.

. Ag the Headquarters staff officer responsible for his

pees 1X described in dotail the reasons for the long, sorious
jook at hig performance these last several months, the changing
intelligence and operational requirencnts we face, and the care—
ful gserotiny he had been given as we bogan to map out new direc-
tions for him, all of which ended with this advance four-week
training progran, testing, and evaluation and substantive
briefings, ‘He said he was a bit confused by the WOMUSE brief-

ing of last week so I explained how that tied in with this evoning's
planned discussion on the China progran.

MEKORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Final Contact with QRPHONE/1

fously, I set with QRPHONE/] at
the WOHOLD safesite froa 1000 hours to
1230 26 July. The neeting tended to wrap up loose
ends, convey our decision to pursue the STFLIMFLAM progran
(providing QRPHONE/1 himself was amenable), and to make
clear that we expect measurable operational progress withi:
the next year. a

1. As arranged p:

2. Although QRPHONE/1 had been debriefed on 24 July
trip around
y information
go I could put it clearly in perspective it related to
our plans for hia in t coming ye: I'll not bother with
the detsils here because such have already been written for
the record elsevbere, but suffice it to say that QRPHONE/1
was both pleased and relieved at the reception he got fron
his old contacts because of the reflection tnese receptions
had on bis own bona fides. The allegations of his BKTRUST
affiliation which had floated throuzh Burope were never
mentioned by his WOCORK contacts; on tbe contrary at least
one of thea urged QRPHONE/1 to return soon to #OCORK because
this is where the action is. This same individual gave
eading materials on the Coanunist dialectic and
urged hin to study thea closely. This greatly iupressed
because it showed how accurate were tbe briefings
given hia by the Headquarters STFLIMFLAM officer and
demonstrated that ve knew our tactics.

3. I then reviewed with QRPHONE/1 the reasons for our
long close scrutiny of him and bis performance these last
Several aonths followed by our selection of him for advance
training, testing, and redirection in the strong hope bad
t this new task because of its priority
importance to our national collection requirements. I asked



SiGe: ivi «

QRPHONE/1 his Lepressions of it all, bis reaction to the
ST¥LIMFLAM proposal, and whether he would accept its
demanding obligations. QRPHONE said he certainly would
and that he found it a real challenge to his intellect and
his operational skills. The tedious rtudy of t dialectic
would not deter him. His only concern was how he should
actually play it as he developed relationships with
Qppropriate party members and, ultioately, the Chinese in
SMORANGE. .I pointed out he needn't concern himself with
the last point because that would be part of the purpose
of the ten-day training program in SMORANGE in September
which would be given him by the Headquarters STFLIMFLAM
officer. I said the training would require total emersion
for ten days straight, probably in some secluded beach
coast where all involved could reside full
cover-wise;
iply tell his family he had gone to the continent.
I said that would be workiag out the details of
thie with him, probably after bis return from vacation.

4. I said that given QRPHONZ/1's past perforsance,
his credentials with the radical left, and his apparent
interest in visorously pursuing the STFLIMFLAM program ve
expected to be able to measure in six to eight months the
likelihood of his beiny able to achieve all the STFLIMFLAM
objectives based upon the progress he would have made by
thi with bis contacts. Should it appear that the
STFLIMYLAM operation would not succeed we would be discussing
alternative courses of action with him by the end of the
year. He dic say that of all the countries in Europe where
bis STFLIMFLAM and radical left potential is probably the
best, Italy would be first and Denmark second.

5. I told QRPHONE/1 that his meeting with
had been moved to 31 July as he requested, reviewed his

* Buropean vacation plans and his Malta trip and wished hia

the very best of luck. At this point QRPHONE/1 certainly ._.
geees willing and able aggressively to pursue our operational
plans. We shall se e



WOGEAR Review of African Liberation Movements

: ~ In general, the author has done a reasonably good job

-@escribing the i:istorical development of the various African
liberation movements, especially when one considers the com-
Plexity and number of splits and mergers that have occurred
within and among the movements over the years. There are
veral glaring inaccuracies, however, in the author's con-
clusions about the current position and effectiveness of the
, Several Portuguese African liberation movements.

i Regarding Angola, the author characterizes the MPLA as an
Adeologically-oriented group (i.e., Soviet doctrine) that has
failed to grasp and utilize to its advantage the tribal realities
that exist in Angola. The author fails to acknowledge, however,

, that the MPLA has had some success, albeit limited, in building

‘@ movement that is national and multiracial in character rather

. than tribally oriented. Despite its urban intellectual leader-

ship, the MPLA has had some success winning local support: in

* pural eastern Angola.

sii By contrast, GRAE ranks a poor second. From inception,

its primary base of support has been the large Angolan refugee

‘population of Bakongo tribesmen who live in southwestern Zaire.

os ; Although the organization has won some support among Bakongo

. kinsmen across the border in northwestern Angola, it has failed

to broaden its base because of its thinly disguised regional

.-and tribal make-up. Moreover, Roberto's unwillingness to

delegate authority or compromise have produced chronic disputes

‘at the leadership level. The author's conclusion that GRAE is
a formidable force to be reckoned with in the future of Angola

- ds contradicted by the fact that the MPLA is by far the

largest and most effective of the three nationalist groups _

, Opposing the Portuguese in Angola.

MOZAMBIQUE

z . The present FRELINO leadership does not appear to be in the
state of disarray in 1972 that the author believes it is.

~ Although some differences undoubtedly persist, the present
leaders seem to have closed ranks somewhat since the departure
of Simango in late 1969. For the present, any internal squabbles
that may exist are not noticeably affecting FRELIMO's fighting’
abilities inside Mozambique. E

RHODESIA, SOUTH WEST AFRICA, SOUTH AFRICA

- Reasonably straightforward and up to date. No serious
deficiencies.

Notes on QRPHONE by Harvey B. DAITCHMAN

te 1. Revolutionary Image: Discussed. briefly how it -is
- obtained. Pointed out there is a pattern to it which is dis-
cernable among revolutionaries. It is ustally issue oriented

-4n the beginning, the war being one of the key issues, and it
. ‘gradually evolves into a desire to engage in practical activities
which usually expressed best on a continuing basis through work
in an organization. Also connected with this process. is the
gradual development of a different "outlook." It is usually a
mixture of idealism and Marxism-Leninismsocialism-Mao Tse-tung
thought. Usually unstructured but developing.

. - It is possible in this stage to move from one group to
another without any particular approbation being attached for
this transience. This is particularly so if one starts way
outside a M-L-ist group and moves inward towards it. Quite
a different thing to start in a M-List group and go out.

1. Also in development of a new outlook one comes to study

a variety of revolutionary literature. This can take one into
different areas, anarchism, GW advocacy, revolutionary nihilism,
socialism, Marxist-Lenism, etc. However, to get to latter

it must be done logically.

: 2, Tightly Structured Op: Emphasis upon tight, controlled
contacts which seek to accomplish a specific purpose--collection
of info not necessarily one nor always one. Purpose is to lay
ground work for future developments. Purpose to establish certain
contacts which can be later used in either positive or negative
fashion. Structured conversation is also essential. It too
should seek to accomplish something, directed so as to be useful
to future development of op: e.g., desire to have an explanation
‘for an action to be undertaken later--so bring up in conversation
with someone so that can use that conversation later as explanation
for interest in a subject, knowledge of a subject, etc. It is
* checkable.

>. 2:3, Study: Most important aspect in opening phases of op.
‘Without correct study and without development (understanding)

. Of “correct outlook" one will always be a dilettante to the,
/outside looking in, someone who is useful to them "under certain

: conditions," but not someone who is reliable, and not a dependable
“. pevolutionary. This is really the key, the ideological tool,

-4t will open doors that cannot otherwise be entered.

! 4. Contacts: Those to be exploited now and those to be
‘used in or for future time. In the beginning the contacts which
are developed are to be used as a means of building his
justification for having begun the serious study of Marx,



peo Lonin, and Mao.’ This must be discussed with people so that many
° ". are aware of it. These conversations will be later used when he
explains how and why and when he became interested.

5. Diffuse Nature of Op: In beginning op has a diffuse
mature, It is necessary to make many contacts. Some will be
more useful than others, but all have potential for use in
one circumstance or another. Since we have no way of knowing
how or from whom the Chinese collect their intelligence, seek
out, or otherwise spot budding revolutionaries we can assume
“that some one of his acquaintances will report his interest
“im Mao, etc. We can assume that through some of his activities
Chinese will build up his dossier so that at a later date when
. We go directly to the Chinese for help they can look in their
dossier and see that x number of months ago, etc., various
things were reported. Etc.

:.+ 6. Ops as a Process of Development: Permit no diversions

or detours which might become permanent. This would include

targets of opportunity, etc. Must always maintain correct

operational line and cannot reach target by following various

. diversionary tributaries in the temporary interest of collecting
marginal intelligence, Must be prepared to sacfrice diversionary

tasks in pursuit of main goal or objective. If tangential

things are folled up we then have a different op, and a new op

line, must be cautious with this. Ops line serves as guide for

whole op from beginning to end.

zt 7. Tactics in Op: Must always be carefully thought out 50
as to insure forward development of op. Something must be seen

. emerging or useful, or having potential future value for develop—
{ment of op, otherwise it is pointless to undertake it. Tactics
are details. Details are most important aspect in day to day
running of op. They must be paid attention to, must be contrib-
utory, must be carried out in correct sequence, and we must keep
in mind that at one or more points it is these details which will
, be subject of the scrutiny of the opposition. IT IS IMPORTANT
THAT THESE DETAILS APPEAR LOGICAL TO THIS OPPOSITION, even if they
may seem illogical to us at times. Our logic is not the same as
communist logic.

“8. Ops is Step by Step Process: Op should/or can be

’ divided into steps, phases, stages, segments, whatever. Each

" phase should dovetail into the next, To some extent a general
outline can be developed. Each of the major phases should ie
: be sub-divided into stages so that they can be dealt with step

. by step. For example: Three broad categories:

.-1st Phase: All initiatives are ours. We do all the work,

lay ground for future stages. We have a flexible line which

* permits making maximum contacts to be correctly exploited. We
sive training. Also devise concrete activities for him to carry

out. f



ad

Zu@ Yaase: Chinese and others have shown interest. We
will exploit this interest. After he has completed first phase
we will begin to make structured contacts with the Chinese. In
these contacts he will show that he has a grasp of the ideology;
is interested in learning more, desires to study more intensively.
Will use as negative examples: his book, Panthers, some aspects
of Bergman's behavior, the unstructured and undisciplined nature

, Of most revolutionary activists in U.S., particularly among the

blacks, or whatever may seem appropriate at time contact is
made. However, will seek their help to further his study and ~
will indicate recognition of need to return to U.S, in order

to undertake correct role in revolutionary struggle. At this
stage we will have an idea of interest of Chinese. We will be
able to determine whether we can expect progress or not. If
they prove willing to help they will then be asked to guide

his further study, to help him. Through this help they will

be able to see the development which has taken place. We should
get a good feeling of their willingness to guide him after a
couple of meetings. If we are shut out then must make ops
Judgement from that point on--can always target against Soviets
and use Chinese as negative example. If they are interested

we will then lose some aspects of our initiative, but in’ essence
the more initiative we lose to them, the more they try to

‘direct him, the deeper he becomes involved with them, which is

our objective--one of them. He must continue his study.

"8rd Phase: Continue his study; continue his contacts all

i: around, but by now should have significant contacts and can

dispense with the more general "sparrow" approach. Once certain
of their willingness to help we ask about a trip to Peking

to study after which he wants to return to U.S. and take active
role.

Recognize that this may be a sticking point. We don't

want him here. However, this idea has to always be in the

forefront as far as the Chinese are concerned otherwise they
have little reason to be interested in him. This MUST appear to
be his goal. We may be able to circumvent it later for one
reason or another, or it might be useful to bring him back
temporarily. This decision must be reserved for that time.

“These stages and sub-stages must be further divided if
we are to understand the operation correctly and are to carry
ait out correctly. Each action he is asked to undertake must
be seen leading to something concrete in the next or another
step. The whole op goes STEP BY STEP. We do not insert uae
unrealistic objectives, or those which would be desirable but
may be difficult. This is a waste of time. We only seek to
do what is possible--possible is what can be turned into reality.

‘Emphasis must be made on “step by step" approach and must

be maintained. Otherwise we can trip ourselves up by trying to
accomplish something which is out of sequence FOR THEM. For

42g DAR At vir AiR A ep Lee ES



E example: He has read Marx and Lonin. We might say he's quite

: familiar with it. We could then say that he will read Mao and
after that he will be able to pretend to be a Maoist. All of this
is true. He could say it’ and act like he and others thought

. . a Maoist should act, However, appearance and essence are not

ee synonomous. It might appear to non-Naoists that our troop is a

i . Maoist because he can talk as good a game as. anyone else--or

better than those who have not studied as uuch--but the essence

of being a Maoist is not contained in such superficialitTes. .

Nor is the essence of being a Marxist-Leninist s0 contained.

He cannot, for example, bloom or emerge as a Maoist and find

acceptance with the Maoists. They know the process it takes to

get there: "Several years of assiduous study can produce good

results.” (Some Chinese quote on studying Mao.)

- 9, Their Weapon is Also Our Tool: Once we understand
correctly how they wield their weapon, the dialectical method,

it can serve as our tool to pry our way into their camp.

Through proper study and understanding we can deve op and promote
Q's superiority among his friends and acquaintances. To Marxists
he will be much more acceptable and his intel product will
probably be enhanced since they will talk on subjects they might
not have touched upon in the past, he will be more trusted, and
also he will have better recognition of key developments in
Marxist world turough better understanding of their reality.

“10. Some activities which wo might consider enroute.

ac us a. Start His Own Study Group: Chinese would be very

interested. Unlike most study groups with which I am familiar

he would stress study of ideology--in correct way. However, to

prevent them from profiting from such study they can be tied in

knots for months dealing with a variety of ideological problems.
. _There is no point in our developing for their use good
“yevolutionaries. However, it would provide reason for frequent
./contact with Chinese in order for them to help him in the
development of his group. Would probably lead him into contact
‘with other interesting types. Might have it for “Americans
only" abroad--to avoid problems with Brits: whatever:

.

erent b. Might Talk About Starting a One Man Institute for
. Studying African Revolution: could put out a four page broad-
‘sheet for peanuts. It would discuss various African problems. —
His book gives him good reason for such study. He might draw
. “one or two people to him. Can use this too as basis for approach
to Chinese. He will have come to recognize that he had not .
| painted the true picture of national lib struggle in his book
and through his broadsheet he seeks to rectify some his ideas.

¢. He could seek to do another book on "The Dialectics
of African Revolution." Here again the help of various communists,
'-Marxist-Leninists, and particularly the Chincse in providing

"2 guidance (correct guidance) would give him frequent access and

_ contact--providing the Chinese are willing to help.

woe



E d. Start a Broadsheet for American Revolutionaries
Abroad: This would give him contct with a wide variety

‘of radical U.S. types abroad. It would also have feed back
into the American scene and in part fulfill his requirement to
_ have an active role with U.S. revolutionary developments. Etc.
Etc.

opens e. There are other activities which he might also
undertake. The above are a few ideas of what we can do to

" "promote" QRPHONE. He can do a number of different things

at the sametime since much of it overlaps and is hence com-
patible. However, each must be structured, carefully handled,
“with great attention to the details. STEP BY STEP.

-'! Some Words of Caution: Our experience clearly indicates
that it is incorrect to rely upon either the agent or the
station to provide the impetus. This seems to be true for a
mumber of reasons. Case officers change often, chiefs of ops,
bases, or stations change--there is not much continuity. We
are thinking of a long term operation which, as it grows,
becomes very complex. It is not easily understood by someone
who gets involved after it has been going for sometime. It is
. @ven more true of changes in station leadership whose attitude
4s largely developed on his subjective feelings from reading
only cable traffic. The initiative, the operational ideas,
etc. are best kept in Hqs. There is so much more information
~ here to work with, people with whom one can talk, staffs, etc.

Also most officers in the field simply do not have the time to

sit down and plan in the kind of detail that is needed to

continue and develop the op. It calls for solid knowledge of

, the communist reality in order to insure that no errors creep
.jin those contacts he may make. It calls for someone to have the
time to read, study, certain publications, articles, etc., and
then to figure out whether or not a given publication or article
ean be used to make a useful contact, write a useful letter, etc.

If 80, how, and then go the field with the idea, and concrete
directions about how it should be used. Case officers most
likely won't be exposed to the same material and probably wouldn't
have the planning time necessary, or the various resources of
-Hqs to do what needs to be done. _

a <

- +’ This is not to suggest that the field has nothing to say.
However, if the understanding can be clearly made that this is in
fact a joint operation, with Has having an opportunity for big
input, with the understanding that the only thing which matters

; to all concerned is the correct development of the operation in

; the given concrete wnditions and not either the Hqs or the field
trying to establish some kind of supremacy of rights over the
Other--there is a good chance of success.

Agent Profile - QRPHONE/1

QRPHONE/1 is on American citizen and a singleton agent
who has been a recruitea asset for some seven years. He has
extensive contacts among leftist, radical, and communist
movements in Europe and Africa and able to/sustain bis
Telations with many such tigures for operational purposes
in spite of a formal disassociation some years azo.
Originally a member himself of a radical pro-communist
group, his disenchantment with internal personal and
political dissension in an organization to which ne had
firmly committed himself led later to his acceptance of an
operational relationship with the Agency. Although tarzseted
after his recruitment at the plethora of new left and radical
elements in Europe, essentially for intelligence collection
purposes, QRPHONE/1 has recently been redirected toward the
Chinese Communists with a view to ingratiating himself and
seeking their guidance and support as he demonstrates an
interest in more effectively acting on their bebalf. Our
ultimate objective is to precipitate invitations to Mainland
China which will lead to successively higher echelons ot
contact within the Chinese Government.

To prepare QRPHONE/1 for this demanding task, extensive
retraining, assessment and remotivetion were recently E
accomplished and selective recontact wi made by him with
bis more influential and pertinent communist contacts.
Reactions to QRPHONE/1's alleged desire to more fully commit
himself to the communist Chinese cause and the assistance
rendered thus far by these-cownunist contacts are encouraging
pevtane td of the potential success of this agent to achieve
our goal.

Although a complex man to manage operationally because
of his own background and the mix of bis ideological and
professional motivations, QRPHONE/1's intelligence ana
personality are such as to well equip him to meet the
challenge of the tests the Chinese are likely to throw bis
way. He is based| | as is his case officer, and

,

een it in secure safe sites, sometines

QRPHONE/1 has produced numerous intellizence reports
on communist and radical tarzets in addition to his covert
action functions as a journalist and author. His long-tera
tenure with the Agency will be determined in part by the degree
of success of his new!

\directions.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
. SUBJECT: Meeting with QRPHONE/1

re see SER SEEESEfeeeeeemeeee Cr

1.__On 24 July 1972,/
jana the undersigned
converged on the OTR safesite in

to meet with QRPHONE/1 in order to debrief
him on his trip through WOCORK.

2. The discussion was started by having QRPHONE
relate the details of his trip on a city by city basis
describing the people he met and his reception by them.
It should be noted here that several of the individuals
that QRPHONE was to have seen were out of town or
unavailable, however, QRPHONE will correspond with these
individuals in order to maintain his relationship with
them.

NEWARK

QRPHONE met with Leibel Bergman at his home
and stayed overnight (14-15 July) as his guest.
QRPHONE told Bergman that he had decided to make
a full-time commitment to the study of Marxist-
Leninist (M-L) doctrine in order to become more
proficient in M-L theory and would like to join
leas : the RU to further this ambition. Bergman's reaction,
' according to QRPHONE, was enthusiastic. Bergman
gave QRPHONE some M-L literature (which was the
same as the literature| _|/gave him several
weeks ago to study) which he felt would be helpful.
Bergman stated that if QRPHONE was really interested -
in becoming involved in the M-L movement he should i
return to WOCORK because that "was where all the
inconsistencies were." Bergman invited QRPHONE to

a _- a fesissuseepaassl eases

take part in some M-L study groups but didn't
say what exactly would be studied. The
following are some general comments QRPHONE
provided about Bergman. Bergman doesn't like
Newark, he has been mugged several times and
would like to go back to California; however,
that is not possible at this time, so Bergman
will instead move to New York City. Bergman
is pleased with the current development of the
RU. He said that the recent trip to China by
several RU members was successful and that the
trip had been pleasant for them. QRPHONE
commented that it appears that Bergman does not
have the same control of the RU that he formerly
had, although he is regarded as the "guru" of
the RU.

NEW YORK

QRPHONE said that Richard Ward is attempting
to sell the English language rights of
Prince Sihanouk's book My War With the CIA.
Ward had been trying to get Lyle Stuart to
purchase the rights but Stuart's antipathy
toward Wilfred Burchett, "that old Communist"
according to Stuart, was too great. Burchett
apparently wrote the forward and Stuart doesn't
want to publish anything with his name on it.
QRPHONE, in our presence, called Stuart and
convinced him to at least read the manuscript of
the book before he turned it down. Ward-has a
South Vietnamese student living with him as a
combination houseboy/companion. This student,
whose name is David Truong, is the son of the
South Vietnamese presidential candidate Truong

Dinh Dzu, who ran in the 1967 South Vietnames election

on a peace platform and who is now in prison.
QRPHONE said that this student has amassed a large
collection of books on intelligence, that the
books are expensive and that he doesn't have any
idea where the money to buy the books came fron.
He also said he doesn't think Truong has
immigration. papers to stay in WOCORK legally. I
asked if Truong was in any way involved with the
recent attempt to hijack a plane to Hanoi. QRPHONE

stated that Truong knew the hijackers and might have

known something about the attempted hijacking
because the hijackers had also stayed at Ward's
apartment. :

NS oebaniyi

Ward is going to France soon for a vacation
with a girlfriend he refused to identify because
he feels his apartment and phones are bugged
“by at least ten intelligence agencies." Before
he goes on vacation he intends to stop in Paris
and meet with DRV and PRG officials as well as
with Wilfred Burchett. (Ward also met with

[prior to her recent trip to the DRV).
Ward will try to visit.QRPHONE in London sometime
in September before he returns home. Ward
claimed that a "wealthy benefactor" gave him some
$1000 to cover the cost of his vacation. Ward
himself is broke and makes only about haae per
week salary.

DETROIT

QRPHONE was unable to see Milton Henry,
leader of the New Republic of Africa, who was on
vacation in Japan. He did manage to see
FNU Boggs, who is apparen‘ly no longer involved
with radical organizations but who is acting as a
clearinghouse for black and white radicals.
QRPHONE characterized Boggs as less doctrinaire
and less dogmatic than he had been in the past.
Boggs’ feeling about the black radical movement
is that it is in considerable disarray.

CHICAGO

QRPHONE saw LPWEAKLY/1 who told him that he,
was trying to get an invitation to visit China.
LPWEAKLY/1 told QRPHONE that if he went he would
see about taking him along. This was the first.
that QRPHONE knew about LPWEAKLY/1's plans. ~~
QRPHONE was unable to see either Sidney Lens or
Hal Block because they were out of town. He did
corroborate the fact that Block had recently
been to China. QRPHONE spent some time with
Don Wright, who was a member of the RU delegation
to China. Wright is now a full-time RU official
responsible for organizing RU cells in the
Mid-West and seems committed to revolution
although he doesn't speak in M-L terminology.
Wright stated that one problem now facing the RU
involves national exposure, i.e., getting
minorities to become involved with the RU. This
is a change from past RU philosophy which vas that



some

ia Aer) eT

minority groups shouid form their own i
organizations separate from the RU. QRPHONE
said Wright is very bitter toward the Black
Panther movement and thinks that Eldridge
Cleaver is "bad" and that Huey Newton and
Bobby Seale are “corrupt”.

: SAN FRANCISCO

In San Francisco QRPHONE stayed with i :
Davida Fineman. The mysterious M, who appeared i
in several of her letters to QRPHONE, is Martin :
Nichols, a Marxist scholar of note who translated
into the English the entire Fundamentals of
Political Economy. He was once a member of the
RVs

= i

Emotionally, Davida is not as depressed as
she was several months ago, even though her brief
exposure to the world of labor union organizing
a failure. Her comments about the RU were
to condemn the Bruce Franklin group (Venceramos
Organization) which she said is going to bring
disaster to the whole RU because of its
predilection for violence before the groundwork .
for revolution has been laid. Fineman feels that ie as
Robert Avakian, a high RU official, is less wild
and erratic than in the past and has in fact
become a good M-L.

QRPHONE saw Paul Richards, Hodee Edwards’
son-in-law. Richards is a former CP member from
: the Mid-West, which he left because of the people. :
: He feels that the Mid-West is a part of the !
4 country where the Government ought to test nuclear {-
i warheads. QRPHONE also met with Earl and Lee Rose. f
Earl was in the RU delegation to China where he Hiiace
must have caused some embarrassment to the
delegation by his naivete. He attempted to meet
African revolutionaries, particularly members of
the MPLA, which he didn't realize were Moscow-
oriented. Rose asked QRPHONE to write and send
him material on the various African liberation
movements. Lee Rose works for ii

although Earl, her husband, is unemployed.

SECRET RYBAT



>

ATLANTA

QRPHONE went to the Martin Luther King
Center for Social Change, formerly the Martin
Luther King Foundation, where he met with
Tom Porter, the head staffer of the organization.
There was recently a split in the Center and the
Executive Director, a Dr. Scott, was forced out
of office. The office is still vacant and,
according to Porter, will remain so for the
immediate future. The reason for the continued
vacancy is apparently to allow Coretta King and
other members of the Board of Directors to
maintain direct control. Porter is a former
writer for Freedom Ways Magazine. QRPHONE said
that Porter knew of him but didn't say exactly how.
QREPHONE told Porter he would consider writing a
brief on the Center for LPWEAKLY. QRPHONE said
that the Center is going to establish a foreign
affairs staff which will be headed by Jack O'Dell,
an old CP member.

3. After QRPHONE's discourse on his trip, ]
discussed in broad terms what he could expect in the
next year with regard to securing entre to the Chinese.
QRPHONE was told that once he was proficient in M-L
he would be expected to go out and test his knowledge
with various individuals and organizations in order to
gain access and become known to the Chinese.
emphasized it wouldn't be easy, that QRPHONE would have
to be diligent and patient, but that in the end, if he
was successful, the benefits would be many. QRPHONE

accepted this. oe

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief. Covert Action Staff
ATTENTION:
SUBJECT: "completion of Tra of Training Re Report for QRFHONE/1,
Training Program “:
REFERENCE: Memo for Director of Training, From Chief,

Covert Action Staff, dated 23 May 1972;
Subject: “Covert Training for QRPHONE/1”

1. QRPHOUR/1 was trained covertly from 22 June to
14 July 1972. There were sixteen sessions for a total of eighty-seven

training hours.

2. nis was a happy reumion of trainee and instructor. Less then
two years 9go, PHONE was given three days of reports training (Please
see Completion of Training Report dated 19 October 1970). Just as then,
FHONE was totally engrossed in every training session from the moment
of his arrival to the moment of his departure. Remenbering that the
instructor does not eat lunch, PHONE brought a sandwich with him daily
end took this lunch while listening to the instructer. Thus, every
minute of every day was made to count.

3. The only time lost was three hours for jend on the
several phone calls he had to make daily to check for calls to his cover
office, then follow up with calls to those persons who had called his
office and had left messages to be called back. At the most, these calls
took half an hour. (nm some days, they took far less.

4, His cover organization work took up e considerable portion,
everyday, of his free time with the result that he could not do any

casing to speak of for subsequent preparation of commo plans for exercises.

Yor exemple, told early on to prepare two dead drop commo plans, he
was not able to cone up with anything till the lest week -- end then
with only one written one and one that he revejwed orally. As a result
he had to be given time during the training day to write reports of
his countersurveillance exercises and one of his agent developmental
exercises. After one such exercise, asked if he wished to teke time
out during the training day to write his report he said: "No, tonight
I vill make tine to write it.” And he did. And it was @ good report.

5. Oa each Sunday, he went out of town to visit his aged Grandmother.
He used the travel time to read tradecraft books (he read seven altogether).

On Tuesday, July 4th, his publisher appointed him baby sitter for the
publisher's teen age son and there went any hope of getting eny casing
done that day. At least one time, he mentioned that he did not go

to bed till two that morning and as he hed left the afternoon before,

he hed stated that he had meetings starting at rour-thirty that afternoon.
With all that, he nevertheless wes fully alert and attentive every minute
of every training session.

6. In his developmental recruitment series of exercises, his
instructor played the role of operations officer -- and a real dumb-
dumb he was. In such circumstances, PHONE hed to do all the thinking,
all the planning, all the casing for necting sites, all the analyzing,
all the preparing and pointing for the recruitment. It was pure joy
to watch this man, after each meeting and egein before the next one,
go to work on the problem. He knew where he was, knew where he wanted
to go, knew how to get there. When during the critique
et the end of the series of exercises said: "He did a beautiful job,”
PHONE had earned that accolade all by himself, ‘The instructor's only
contribution had been in the teaching of the subject of Agent Acquisition.

7. At this point, the instructor wishes to execute a lov bow in
the direction of He played his agent role excellently vell
and made t! ‘@ Heaningful one for PHONE. ‘The three trips to

must have been very taxing, particularly in view
of his immediately upcoming TDY trip, but they were efforts vell spent.

8. No man, of course, is perfect. Each has an Achilles heel, a
wealmess, or an all-too-human trait, at the very least. Our PHONE has
his. He has a very quick mind. He knows it. And knowing it, he relies
on it, counts on it. This, in turn, leads to a small failure in self-
Giscipline. For example, told to write out his plan for the recruitment
pitch, he came in with six words (maybe not that many) scratched on a
3 by 5 leaf torn out of his pocket notebook. He then proceeded, fron

these few words, to rum off his plan without a single pause for en oe

uh, hm, er, etc. It was as though he was reading a definition from a
dictionary, so smoothly did his mind and thoughts run, He prepares
everything ip.bis mind, it eppears, and does not like to write out .
‘that which he feels he should not have to write out. while it is great
to heve so facile a mind, & bit of discipline, to write out in full

so important an ect es a recuritment pitch, might one day save grief

when an error would have been spotted had the entire plen been written

out then looked over for possible flews.

9. This small flaw, the instructor feels, accounts in considerable
measure for Pu0"g"s failure to bring in a written dead drop plan till

the last days of the program. PHONE felt he could just as easily report
orally. In fact, the other dead drop (he hed been asked to do two)

on which he reported orally, he discussed as though the peper was in - .
front of him and he was reading from it. Nothing was missing -- area

description, access, hours of availability, the opposition, pros and
cons as to suitability -- it was all there. He just didn't like to
write out that upon which he could report orally.

10. In wriving reports on the two counter-surveillence exercises,
he dashed those off in jig tine. No pause for thinking, no pause to

look up at the ceiling or out the window. Just straight writing, includ-

ing paragraphing. Mind and pen were as one. Same thing for his oral
analysis before and after each meeting -- no pause to think, to review,
to reconstruct, to remember -- just an IBM-type printout.

ll. the instructor sets down this reluctance on our hero's part
to write out certain things, not to downgrade him, but to alert desk
end field officers that if they must have < certein report by a certain
time, and they want it in writing, they must be firm. For exemple,
after the second meeting in the developmental series, the instructor
seid: "I must have that report first thing in the morning. Do you
vant to take time out from this afternoon's training session to do it?"
And, as already reported sbove, PHONE preferred to save the training
time and he answered "I will make time to write it". In this case,
time was of the essence because, had to see the report before
the next meeting. To sum up this it When PHOWE feels that en oral
report is adequate he finds it a little difficult to bring himself to
find time to make a written report. Told definitely that he must write
® report end given a deedline, he meets the deadline and the report is

everything it should be.

22. His reports on his recruitment meetings, _—ijsaid, were
excellent. No jumping to conclusions, no padding, no misinterpretations,
Do omissions.

13. ‘The surveillance team captain, reading PHONE's report on his
actions during the countersurveillance exercises, narvelled at the
completeness, total accuracy of description of the surveillants PHONE
had made, including their ages (but always made each man an inch or
two shorter then the actual height -- which PHONE admitted he does a
constantly), and the total recall of every move, every street crossing,
every compass direction. (In the first countersurveillance exercise,
sprung on PHONS without a moment's prior notice, he made one of his
two surveillants. In the second one, with plenty of time to prepare,
he made all three of them. These were two different teams from the

office of Security). Concluding his admiration of PHONE's
, the surveillence team captain said to the instructor: "You

should be very proud of him”.

14. In both exercises, the surveillance teams criticized the
rapidity of PHONE's movements. He walks very rapidly from place to
Place, then spends time to browse in a book shop. ‘Then off again at
@ high rate of speed to his next stop. They also criticized his looking
‘both ways while crossing a one way street. They felt it made him appear

tail conscious. These are a typical habits. The instructor,
also is cuilty of the identical ections. We are highly

kinetic in our movements and as for looking both ways while crossing a
one-way street, we follow the old Marine Corps adage: "There's always
one S.0.B. that doesn't get the word”. By sheerest coincidence, when
the instructor was on his way to the safesite to deliver the surveillance
team's report, he violated his ow rule of looking both ways in crossing
& one-way street and was bowled over by a hippie on a loaded bike --
going the wrong way. Only the large heavy film case the instructor

vas carrying kept him from being knocked flet.

15. Nevertheless, PHONE is now fully cognizant of the appearance
that hie actions create and will vatch it in the future.

16. One last note on the counter-surveillance exercises: He
chose his positions well and he camouflaged his actions beautifully.
Qne example; The instructor called the surveillance team for a quick
feedback on the first exercise and caught the men Just as they returned
to their office. They got on different phones for a three way conversation.
‘They reported one incident as follows: “So repid were PHONE's novements,
that when he met a friend of his, he hardly paused to speak with him,
just waved him off". The second surveillant: "Yo, it didn't look like
that at all, to me, To me it looked like this Indian-looking person
stopped PHONE and asked him for directions and PHONE cave them and just
went about his business”. PHOME's om report, which he wrote up before
he learned about the two different interpretations of the incident:
"2. where I stopped a foreign-looxing man, apparently Indian in origin
and asked hin for the Museum which I knew perfectly well is on 55th
Street. I turned around es he pointed south to 55th Street and spotted
the same man in the grey suit, now holding his hat in his hana”.

17. In the second exercise, there were two items of note: One,
the team was surprised to note in PEONZ's report that PHONE even had
the nome of the book that the surveillant picked up when he folloved
PHONE into a book store. Second, when the exercise wes over, the team
compared notes end decided that PHONE may have made two of them but
could not possibly have made the third man. ‘The team captain, on
PHONE's report, was stunned to see that PHONE had indeed made the third
man also, but good.

18. PHONE hed on elicitation exercise (in addition to the develop-

juisition series) with Mr. Harry Webster, an instructor in the
xffice. After relating the fine job that PHOWE had done, Mr.

Webster's report concluded: "A first rate performance by PHONE, who's
obviously been around -- both coverwise and for real”.

19. His choice of meeting places with his agent could not be
fault r one, he chose an East Side restaurant (where diplomants,
as held himself out to be, would properly be seen dining).

Yet it was far enouzh away from the United Hetions building to lessen ui
the chances that PHONE himself and his putative diplomat terget would Set

be spotted by 2riends or acquaintances. His choi: the next neetin,

[This restaurant wes

“Yoeated in the safesite corplex. He was thus able very smoothly to
invite his agent to the safesite from the restaurant for the recruiting
pitch.

20, He did very well in executing two recognition meetings and

two brush passes. He had no time to write his own commo exercises

(as stated, he was able to write up only one deed drop commo plen)

80 he was given como plans written up by another trainee. To give him
veriety, he was alternately the higher and the lower echelon, alternately
accepted and made the hand-off.

: 21. In operational and intel reports, he did very well. He very
i successfully separated the operational from the intel info and the
source comments from the positive intelligence.

22. Instructor's Observation: PHONE is a proud man, both as an
; individual and as an operator. While he was very discreet about it,
very circumspect, he did, nevertheless, let the instructor know that
the has, on occasion been handled with something less then pure genius.
This, like the previous item, is noted not to down-grade PHONE, but to :
alert both desk and field officers that this man, being very sure, i
positive, definite end strong, hopes to be handled in a manner that i
would have those same words epply. | : 4

23. %In sum: A very good man.

2h, In an effort to evaluate the effectiveness of the training,

we would appreciate a detailed evaluation report in July 1973 from the
field station. This report should indicate the extent to which the
training has made the trainee a more useful and effective asset and
should evaluate the performance in each area of tradecraft in which
training was conducted; negative as well as positive comments are
solicited. ‘The field station's report should also include the trainee's
ow comments. Please ask the field station to slug the report WOMOLD/

MEWOKANDUM FOR: Chief, Covert Action Staff
SUBJECT: Review of Project QRPHQNE

1. A review in some depth of Project QRPHONE was
conducted in January 1972 by DC/CA and we with Branch 3
personnel, with the participation of
(nov of Branch 4, formerly QRPRONE Case cer a
LOPIPIT). Attached at Tab A are the questions which
formed the basis for the review, A full reccrd of the
responses to these questions and the revicw discussion
is not practical co I have attempted below to summarize
the general conclusions which emerged. Attached at
fab B are two charts prepared by Branch 3 for the review
Plus a rough draft “CI Asseesment" which they also
prepared.

ha@ish wife, who would only be willing to leave her
Beeland if the overt job to which GRPHOHE was going
: Was clearly a step upward in his career.

4. Handling, The method by which QRPHONE has been
handled, I.e. mainly through Rodigast (although there
has been direct LCPIPIT contact reaently), ia un~
nesearily cumbersome and not suited to the close consal-
tation needed to explore ORPHONE future directions.
Having been declared the most
gecure place to meet QRPHONE is nd he should
be handled directly by an LCPIPIT officer.

&. Security. QRPHONE cannot escape the record
of allegations that he is Agency-connected. what be can
do, hovever, is face-up to these charges, chaflenge then
and deny the! There may thus always be some clement
of suspicion attached to bin, but, as time passes with
out definite proof of such a connection, its inpact on
bie activities may be minimized and he may be able to
engage in effective sork inspite of it.

6. BSub-agents. It wes felt that QRPHONE ma:
possibly have a fair for recruiting and handling sub-
agents. It was believed that this should be explored
and that he should be given relevant training, based in

This would also provide the opportunity for
 Readquarters exploration with him of his future develop-

7. Future Focus. What QRPHONE'’s own thoughts
be on hig most natural course of development ie Boel
clear, He may have an inclination toward African
Liberation Hovenents—the subject of his most. recent
wajor writing—-but it could be questioned whether on
this or on anti-fedayeen work, there is sufficient
Agency interest to merit such focus. He has no Bignifi-
cant base in the American black community (rather the
contrary) which would make him of intereet to others on
this basis. His overt political orientation is described

as “radical,” but it is an intellectual "“radicalisn,”
not revolutionary. Further, he is basically a theoreti-
cian not a personal activist by nature, He sight be
asked and might undertake activist role—-but it is
felt that it would not sit naturally upon him and
would probably not achieve tever acceas might have
been postulated. Within his theoretician, non-activist
context it was nevertheless felt that the probably-to-
de-expanded field of Chin Communist activities in
Zurope provided the focus which might most usefully be
explored. The expansion of Chinese Conmunist activities
imp Furope may come quite slovly but, in view of the
probable shortage of assets in this field, it was a
matter on which we should have sowe patience. It is
also x field which could be explored without QRPHONE's
meeding to move. Whether he focusses on this field or
another, hovever, QRPHONE needs to develop some job

or organizational base which wil] make him interesting
as a target himself to those we wish to focus him on.
At the present time his cover doe: not provide a power
oF influence base snd he is essentially completely
Gependent upon us.

9. Some tine has passed since the above discussions
took place. I am not aware of the extent to whith there
way already have been a follow-up to them. Needless to
gay, they have decided field implications in which
LOPIPIT needs to be consulted. should they be pursued.

AGENT EVALUATION

iy

{ NAME: QRPHONE/1 DATE: 18 January 1971 }
i
t PROJECT: QRPHONE : STATUS: Contract Agent (Under {
i a Memorandum of Oral fa
Agreement) i

i

COVERT JOB DESCRIPTION: Singleton agent targeted at the radical left,
ncluding Maoist, African liberation, and Palestinian groups.
@/l's access derives from his many contacts in these circles.

|
{ PERFORMANCE OF COVERT DUTIES: Q/1 continues to perform well and
without posing problems for his handler. His personality is
easy-going and his attitude positive. If his efforts are not a
always totally successful -- leaving us with tantalizing bits : H
of information and many uranswered questions -- this is generally i
due to opexational circumstances in which he was simply unable |
to elicit more information on a given subject.
H
{
i

PERFORMANCE OF OVERT DUTIES: Q/1 does a solid and workmanlike job
‘as a journalis jas acquitted himself well both as a
representative of his cover firm and in his free lance activity.
Occasional prompting on this subject produces added effort and 4
in this connection the operation profits particularly from the :
energy and knowledge of the deep-cover agent handler who himself 4
has faced similar cover demands over many years.

1
}
ATTITUDE TOWARD JKLANCE: QRPHONE/1's attitude is positive. (See below
fa under Motivation. J
.
i
!

ATTITUDE TOWARD COVER EMPLOYER: Q/1's attitude is good. He has made

t ‘an ifort to discharge his part of the cover arrangement and to
understand the weaknesses and problems which plagued his former
cover organization. He is approaching his new cover arrangement
with enthusiasm,

MOTIVATION IN ACCEPTING JKLANCE RELATIONSHIP: This is a subject on 4
i which 2 goo ea as en Sa. over i@ course of this operation. |
&

t

The following points can be made on the subject of Q/l's
motivation:

A. His basic image of JKLANCE is positive.

SECRET

"

appre Fite ta



i SECRET

B. This image of JKLANCE as a powerful,professional
organization has been enhanced in.Q/1's case by the
circumstances of his agent relationship, which require
very professional handJing. Indeed Q/l has probably come
to hold a rather glamorous "storybook" image of JKLANCE
and of the importance of his contribution to the JKLANCE
effort. This is a very human trait and should not be
exaggerated in his case, but every one of the wild anti- ~
JKLANCE stories which he heard probably only serves to
accentuate the feeling on his part of being a member of
a very ilpressive outfit.

Cc. In his political evolution over the years, Q/1
has become active in at least two "causes". In both
instances he saw these causes undermined by petty jealousy
and factional struggles and in both cases he was personally
harmed as a result. The product of this situation has been
a certain disillusionment with "causes" and a cynical political
outlook. (In other circumstances this might be called
political maturity.) Q/l now tends to view political trends
as a detached observer rather than a participant.

D. Following on the foregoing thought is the fact
that he is an American (and does not consider himself
disloyal). Given his citizenship and his disinclination to
feel "involved" in the currents of the radical left, he
has been perfectly willing to accept employment by JKLANCE
to report on those currents. He does not give any indication
that he views this as "squealing" on his friends -- indeed
the contrary seems to be the case.

E. On a more mundane level, it must be realized that
Q/1 was recruited at a time when he was in serious financial
straits, He was without a job and was living off the charity
of his wife's family. JKLANCE has given him a job, paid
him reasonably well and regularly, and has enabled him to
be independent of his wife's family's charity.

F. Having accepted JKLANCE employment for a combination
of the reasons set forth above, it must be added that Q/1
clearly likes his work. He enjoys dealing with international
issues and political subjects. He enjoys the travel and
the opportunity to exercise his language capability. In
short, the rather sophisticated and cosmopolitan life which
he has been able to live appeals to him.

G. In assessing the relative importance of these
several factors which make up Q/l's motivation, the under-
signed would stress that C and E were probably the immediate
causes of his acceptance of recruitment while A and D were more
underlying. B and F have arisen since recruitment and
probably play an important role in his current motivation.

Neral etal ce A,

oo gecper

WIFE'S ATTITUDE TOWARD JKLANCE: Q/1's wife is not witting of his
a af ‘ation.: ie was allowed to believe that he was

working indirectly for the Chinese. She certainly is aware

of the past JKLANCE accusations which have been leveled at

Q/1, but as far as Q/1 can determine (and this is not a subject

on which he can come right. out and ask a direct question) she
i continues to inese’story . It should be added
i that Mrs. Q/1 nd. is the holder of some rather
| typical “left” ant IKLANCE attitudes. It should aiso be noted
that the relationship between the two is fraught with a variety
of problems thereby adding to the complexity of the situation.
Certainly the whole subject of Q/l's activities is one which
Mrs. Q/1 views with misgivings and which is simply not discussed --
lest it lead to acrimony. Mention should also be made that
Mrs. Q/1 seems to accept as legitimate the small amount of
money received from Q/l's cover and to regard this as a genuine
stringer relationship.

RESPONSE TO CASE OFFICER HANDLING: QRPHONE/1 has a very pleasant
persona y and responds well to Case Officer handling. He is
a most willing asset requiring no special handling care -- other
than the normal professionalism expected in the handling of a
sensitive asset such as Q/1.

WILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT INSTRUCTIONS OR GUIDANCE: Q/1 is willing to
accept guidance and criticism -- provided it is onstructive.
If anything, he may sometimes be too willing. His willingness
occasionally exceeds his sense of security and it then falls
to his handler to bear in mind security and/or operational
considerations which may affect his pursuit of a given target.
However, this should not be over dramatized.

RESPONSIVENESS: Q/1 is most responsive to requirements levied upon
ma. m this connection it should be recalled that his ability
to respond fully is usually restricted by the nature of his
relationship with his informants; i.e., since he is only eliciting
the information from unwitting informants he is rarely able to
Press for all the desired details.

| JKLANCE CONTROL: Q/1 is dependent upon a JKLANCE salary and he has
‘Signed recruitment documents and a security pledge. We hasten
to add that Q/l is not a handling problem and there has never
been any instance in which either he or his handler has had
occasion to allude to these control factors.

PERSONAL SECURITY: Q/1.has a good sense of personal security and his
jandler makes an effort to build upon this at every opportunity.
As cited above, Q/l's enthusiasm sometimes leads to his failure
to consider all aspects and implications of a given situation.

OTHER SECURITY AND COVER SITUATIONS: The past allegations of Q/l‘s
a. tation with J NCE, many pré-dating his actual recruitment,
add an extre dincasiou vo Q/i's cover situation. We have. no
indication that any of these allegations are based on any proof,

nor have they produced a significant reduction in his number of
| contacts.

ABILITY TO WORK WITHOUT SUPERVISION: Q/1 is a self-starter and can
work well for extended periods without supervision.

ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS: Q/1 poses only a minimum administrative
urden. fe is not overly concerned about his administrative
and financial position, allowances, payments, etc. He merely
expects JKLANCE to do the fair thing by him. However, on the
rare occasion when JKLANCE has failed to perform as he expected,
{ he can be very upset.

REPORTING: Q/1 is a journalist by training. He is an effective
| ———“Yeporter -- both in terms of ability to elicit and writing
4 style.

PERSONAL ENERGY AND ENDURANTE: Q/1 is quite energetic and can continue
his efforts on a sustained basis.

LANGUAGES: In addition to his (native) English, Q/1 can speak French,
. « Italian and German.

WILLINGNESS TO TRAVEL: Q/1 is quite willing to travel -- and even

ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL ABILITY: Q/1l's present operating context

oe is assumed that he has a satisfactory competence in both these

areas, however.

WEAKNESSES; PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL: Q/1 has no major weaknesses,
either personal or professional which inhibit his operational
use. The existence of his "reputation" as a JKLANCE asset --

the combination of the security factors operative in this
case and the unlikelihood of Q/l's contirued eccess to targets

regarded as a career asset.

FIELD CASE OFFICER

COMMENTS OF SUPERVISOR: This is another thoughtful evaluation of this
agent, and reflects the views of the agent handler as well as of the
Case Officer.

I doubt that we have really divined Q/l's motivations for working
with JKLANCE, and this evaluation should be read as the best stab
we can make at this enigmatic subject.

MEMORANDUM FOR: C/CA/B3

{ SUBJECT : Chicom Aspect of QRPHONE/1's
j Operational Potential

1. In continuing ny efforts to probe operational
pert _ the redirection of QRPHONE/1, I talked at

january with his former case officer
and received a very favorable :
‘prognosis re; ng QRPHONE/1's mobility (i.e. his it

possible move to another European city or to Africa), A
his agent recruiting capability (preceded by additional |
| training), and the prospects of making himself attractive
to the Chicoms (again preceded by appropriate training).

' 2. In_pursuit of the latter item I talked at length
i today with the FE Division expert on

long-range Chicom and CP penetration programs. I de- i
scribed in detail QRPHONE/1's background, current status, b
{ and the variety of plans we have in mind and received
! (_|reactions as follows:

| A. The butterfly characteristics that QRPHONE
i has demonstrated thus far will never result in his ‘3 ‘
becoming of interest to either the Chicoms or the
Soviets for any operationally meaningful purpose.
While the Soviets would perhaps see him as potential
1 FI source, the Chicoms would not even do that.

B. Chicom officers abroad are still totally
obsessed with Communist doctrine and its strategic
and tactical application to a degree significantly - {
more zealous than their Soviet counterparts.

Therefore, in looking at potential foreign assets 4
the Chicoms discard persons of shallow substance as 7 i
far as their knowledge of Communism is concerned. 4
They are interested in only those who have a serious
intellectual understanding of Communist doctrine and i
- a serious revolutionary goal. The thousands of leftists aoe
aa of whatever coloring floating around Europe are seen in ’
as only of marginal use to the Chicoms and certainly i
not the sort that they would take into their confidence.



bo > gener
|

C. To become of long-term operational use id
to us in the sense of exploiting his possible :
long-term use to the Chicoms, QRPHONE/1 should a
do two things: join an existing "acceptable" .
i organization such as the Trotskyite Party or a
| black radical party and, at the same time begin f
a serious study of Marxist/Mavist doctrine. AS { i
| he gets into this program (preceded by some ten H
{ days training and close Headquarters direction) H
he should begin. to seek out Communist intellectuals, '
H party members, leaders of radical groups, etc., to
: ask questions about the dialectic, seek additional : fae
1 guidance, borrow books and so forth. In doing this . He
be will in time come into the attention of the it
professional spotters the Chicoms have and begin to eat)
develop the sort of bona fides that the Chicoms,
in time, will find appealing. He should also in
this period seek out Chicom officials with the
same requests for help. The key here is to
demonstrate not that QRPHONE/1 is simply sympathetic,
with Maoism or any other Communist shading but that
he is a dedicated serious revolutionary.

D. A quicker way to come into the Chicom spot~-
light might be for QRPHONE/1 to join the Black
Panthers, the SDS or one of the other radical groups
with which the Chicoms are already known to be in
touch. He will obviously have to sweat out a period
of probation in joining any such group until he
divests himself of his tattered st reputation
and those JKLANCE accusations. feels that a
successful passing of this baptismal period wili +
depend solely on QRPHONE/1's willingness to plunge i
wholeheartedly into a serious study of the terribly
boring and lengthy volumes of the dialectic. AS he
demonstrates his capability to move more deeply into
this field to the satisfaction of the “spotters" he ‘
will be accordingly provided additional help and i
encouragement by Chicom contacts and officials.

o E. The Chicoms will be looking at him as a j {
| possible asset in their long-range targetting of the - wo
' American revolution, henge QRPHONE/1's utterances fan
‘ought to be couched in terms of his ultimate aim of t
contributing to and participating in the American ae
revolution. In other words the Chicoms would see id
little or no use for ORPHONE/1 onerationally in

Europe or Africa |

He could do it perhaps as well in an African setting

LPWEAKLY, really makes no difference because the
Chicoms would test the fil \man himself and would
not ve deterred by his external trappings.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Chief, Covert Action Staff
SUBJECT: QRPHONE
REFERENCE:

Your Memorandum, Same Subject,
Dated 29 November 1971

~1, What follows below are some initial comments of mine on
the referent memorandum, per your request, We really feel in
Branch 3 that for a variety of reasons, we need more time to
deliberate on QRPHONE's future operational activity than the
previous two weeks, Partly this Is due to extended absence by the
case officer in charge who has been plagued with a recurring
Miness--I believe you are familiar with this. It ie 0 in part
attributable to the Section Chief's being new to the position and
having his time absorbed by matters of current priority. So if you
don't mind, we should like to address ourselves further to this
subject following the Christmas holidays. At that time we should
like to Initiate some meetings on thie matter both with yourself

and with other area components including representatives from
Cl Staff.

2. Background: Your memo, of course, was triggered by

an earlier one of mine which proposed that CRPHONE become
operationally engaged in attempting to establish a black Communist
cell The purpose of this would be twofold--
namely, to exacerbate relati thereby between the Soviet Union
and mainland China through various low-key covert action undertakings,
and in the process to further enhance QRPHONE's own credentials

a Maoist activist. This tentative assignment, it should be note
arose because Branch 3 personnel had become increasingly aware of
the possibility that ORPHONE's project statue might be terminated
in the not too distant future, While it is true that in the immediate
preceding month or so, we have benefited from his intelligence
reporting, It Is all too clear that over the past two years, he has
been of diminishing utility to CA Staff and other area divisions. In
dlscusoing his futare with his recent case officer, |
her recommendation was that unless something could be found for him

in the near future, we should give serious consideration to terminating

Tee SECRET

ened



his services during the coming year. Thus my foregoing proposal
arose from a desire on my part not to terminate an aeset of proved
capabilities without giving the agent in question suitable opportunity
to become useful once more.

3. Ci Type Review/ORPHONE Personal Security: Your memo
makes out there have been frequent security reviews of QRPHONE's

security status, and you question the efficacy of our doing still one
more. On this let me point out that in making such a security a
ment, we would be doing so in response to a current request by the
area division concerned whose cooperation we need to direct this
agent, One hardly needs stress that such a request probably should
“be honored in the Interests of maintaining good relations even If its
fulfillment means redundant work, But apart from this, the case
officer also informs me that the case file does not contain any general
summary of the alleged security breaches involving QRPHONE and
their Implications vis-a-vis his activities. It is true however that his
security etatus has been reviewed for each annual project review and
that assesements of hie security status were made following each
‘\-alleged breach, but no up-to-date summary exists. As for our own

gut feelings on his personal security, one hazards that he Is still in
pretty good shape. I agree with you that many of the past charges
leveled against him are of the same ilk as those leveled against other
leftist colleagues(who do not have any Agency assoclation) by their
rivals. And as for the structure of his case officer relationship--

that le, having him handled by a deep cover officer from an adjacent
country--this would appear to be secure in the extreme (s0 much

80 that one would advocate that it be dropped due its operational
Inefficiency.)

We tentatively agree that In all likelthood

for our pr. d operational undertaking du
however, might do very well.

If not perhaps you or EUR Division might suggest another

locale, A® for the question as to whether or not the peation would

want him permanently, only time and his own : perational success could
determine this. One hazards that if QRPHONE were able to make his
way with some good local leftists and had promis of developing some
kind of relationship with mainland China representatives, the station
tight come to regard him as a capital asset,



5. Substance: You noted that ORPHONE.. . “cannot just
simply show up and start a leftist nuclei. . ."" Why not? Others
have. He is a well-known leftist in intellectual circles in Europe
and has written many articles in praise of Mao, This should do
for a start, As for what he might have to offer local leftists . .
money, rgy and id will do. A great deal of money. of course,
is unneeded, but some is. Wecan supply It. As for ideas and
energy, he has both. Concerning the "built-in jealousy, animosity,
etc." which such action would likely engender on the part of local
rival leftists, this may or may not occur. But Is this such a calamity
Uf It should occur? Are not leftists usually fighting among themselves
anyway? In any case, we have nothing to lose by trying to salvage
thie agent. What we have to lose by not trying is an agent asset of
proved worth.

6. Credentials: You say in effect that QRPHONE has not
been known as an activist but only as an Intellectual, (Frankly, the
distinction Is not very important in my mind.) Be that as it may, he
has written many articles on leftist subjects and has talked to
Innumerable leftists around Europe over the years, True, he has
not been involved in such actlons as street demonstrations, but we
would not like him to be so personally Involved in the future in any
case. What we would want him to do {s to write pamphlets, informally
recralt associates to his group and provide a little money to the group
as might be required for various undertakings. Aside from the
organizing and funding, actually thie is not very different from what
he has been doing--except that It will be in one place for a change.

uw You may be very correct in saying
that shopping him around to European stations Isa
poor way to solicit useful tasks for QRPHONE. But I took *.

my lead from C/EUR/CA who made a request along these lines
1s

willing at come future time to visit various field stations and to
attempt selling QRPHONE's services personally, we wou'd be happy
to have him do so. We, of course, don't know when he will be
avallable to do so, and time is passing.

8. Concluding Comment: I really feel that we should relate
to you in some detail the suce once had with the
kind of undertaking which we have jaar for QRPHONE, It may
Interest you. On the other id, it may be perfectly possible that
the situation which ‘once manipulated is not applicable to

if we are not to channel bis energies in this direction, It is incumbent

MEMORANDUM FOR: C/CA/3 :
SUBJECT: Operational Redirection of QRPHONE/1 ;

1. In response to your request that I examine the
QRPHONE/1 project to determine how it might best be
redirected in order to gain greater value for the time and
money involved, I have talked at some length with appro-
priate officers in CI/SO and Africa Division. I have been j
advised that the primary reasons for QRPHONE/1's dwindling ‘
productivity are as follows:

A. Key centers of activity of the radical left
in Europe are London, Paris, and Stockholm. For
different reasons QRPHONE/1's access in these ti

is either circumscribed or off targe’

His reputation among/target
groups of interest to us| has
been so tarnished that he has not=taken into their
confidence significantly enough to be of value.

.B. Although he has a multitude of contacts among
the left, virtually all are shallow, periodic, and then
very brief when they do occur. Even his correspondence
to the more important radical leaders, which used to be
quite informative, has fallen to almost nothing.

Cc. Because his contacts are so cursory, he has
been unable to develop a close and continuing personal
relationship with any one of them in order to develop
the intimate confidence so necessary for operational
exploitation.

D. His cover has always been thin and thus has
circumstantially at least lent credence to the periodic
allegations of his being a JKLANCE agent.

saute



i

a or «|

EZ. Close case officer direction has been made
very difficult. because of the echelons existing
between QRPHONE/1 and LCPIPIT, coupled with relative
infrequency of field case officer meetings.

F. What contacts he has within the African
target, for example, are rendered virtually useless
because his case officers are unfamiliar on ¢ timely
basis with Africa Division requirements and also
miss valuable operational leads simply because they
do not recognize them. (This is no fault of the
ease officers because they obviously have little
opportunity to keep abreast of such requirements.)

G. The somewhat artificial nature of his trying
to portray a pro-Mao stance may help him a bit with
targets similarly inclined but renders him ineffective
with other political shadings among the left.

2. With all of the above in mind and without belaboring
the history of this project, the following recommendation is
offered and has been concurred in informally by CI/SO and
Africa Division officers with whom I have talked.

A. Accepting the fact that QRPHONE/1's operational
utility in Europe is minimal, I propose LCPIPIT be
directed to begin making arrangements for his transfer
PCS to Africa and, hence, his operational control
transferred to Africa Division as soon as feasible.

B. From the point of view of MHCHAOS requirements
and Africa Division's own requirements, both elements
Felt QRPHONE/1 could best be exploited
It is one of the two most active cities in Africa for
the radical left, it is a hot-bed of both Soviet and
Chicom shenanigans, and it is politically vital to
East African stability.

C. However, because o: well-known
association with two exiled. pposition
politicians and current reports that these

would be very. QRPHONE/1 to arrive bag

D. Both to give QRPHONE/1 time to cleanse his
tattered image and because there are almost as i
important operational tasks in West Africa, the idea rs :
is to move him (1){ or (2)) |for :
perhaps a year. This is to done in concert with a
suitable strengthcing of his cover (i.e. two or

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, CA/B-3

SUBJECT: QRPHONE

REFERENCE: Your Memorandum, Subject: QRPHONE
Operations in Europe, Dated 24 November
1971

2, Imade some notes in the margin of referent memorandum upon
first reading it, However, since these are too brief, I thought it best
to let you have my thoughts on this matter in fuller form,

2, As you may know, we had tried for years to give QRPHONE more
meaningful assignments, but there are certain facts about him and the
A, Operation today which simply cannot be ignored, It seems to me that
‘. your memorandum takes inadequate account of these factors.

a. Security: RODIGAST's and QRPHONE's personal security
cannot be faulted, in my judgment. However, that has not protected
QRPHONE from accusations of being CLA, which have haunted him
throughout the years. This is such an endemic charge in the milieu in

f 7

which he operséas shat I feel certain ba would have bad the same chareas
leveled at him
[
b. Location: Apart from the efficiency

there are a number of good reasons arguing against the desirability of

QRPHONE's ames for a meeting, let alone being stationed
i‘ there (e. g., protection of RODIGAST's identity,

and the location there o: I cannot imagine why he would

consider it, or why we sl advocate it.



A different cover for a move to knight be developed, '
but not that of a Maoist developing new cells. | ‘Station is glad to
have him come there and give them "grass roots" reports whenever
he visits, but would they want him permanently? ?

¢. Substance: More generally, QRPHONE cannot just simply
show up and start forming nuclei -- there are already Maoist nuclei --
the various Marxist-Leninist parties (miniscule though they may be)
that existed, and they continue to exist with or without Chinese help.
If he were to have something to offer them -- money, preferably --
they might welcome him with open arms. Otherwise he will encounter
built-in jealousy, animosity, rivalry, and a source of accusation all
over again,

a. Credentials: As a Maoist intellectual (or an intellectual
Maoist? ?), QRPHONE can travel all over, Asa Macist activist, he
has only minimal credentials. The only group he is actively involved :
with is J-- and even with thathe has Heer
never carried a placard, and I doubt if he has even helped them with /
making up a placard. He has helped them with their press releases,
leaflets, etc. In short, with the written word, not the deed. By
nature -- which we must also take into consideration -- QRPHONE
is no longer a "doe: - if he ever was one. And I doubt very much
that he can at thie stage in his life become a "doing" radical. We would
be misusing his natural talents, which could still serve us well, in v
favor of dubious undertaking.

In effect, the proposal (if I read it correctly) is to have na
QRPHONE develop a group which would serve to distribute anti-Soviet te
material. I cannot judge if that would be worth the cost ($40, 0002?) a

but I doubt it. I also do not know enough about th /é
operation to comment on that aspect, particularly as to its feasibility / \f
in a sophisticated European community.

{efethiiettetatiata Shopping him around to the European

£, "CI-Type" Review: A review of the file will show how often
this has been done, and how thoroughly. (I can understand)
asking for a security review -- he had no background knowledge of the
operation that would have given him this information.) I do not know
what you now expect to find, In all frankness, and unless Cl Staff feels
the need for yet another review and is willing to undertake it, I would
consider a Staff-internal review pretty much a waste of time,

3, Having gone around this problem several times in the past
several years-with Cl Staff and the pertinent area divisions (as the
files will clearly show), I am most doubtful that any of them will consider
QRPHONE of sufficient interest (current or potential) to pay what it
costs to maintain him, We may be able to justify it since we attempt
{as no one area division would) -~ and to some extent succeed -- to target
him on a multi-divisional basis. In light of these considerations, and
Since I have developed serious reservations on the long range viability
of this operation (in terms of the cost-effectiveness factor), I believe
that the first order of business is to undertake a basic assessment of
the project. After some internal discussions, this will also, of course,
entail consultations with the Cl Staff and at least area divisions,

4, Iwill appreciate receiving your comments by mid-December.

24 November 1971
MEMORANDUM OF MEETING
SUBJECT: QRPHONE Operations in Europe

1. EUR/CA, and myself briefly
discussed prospective QRPHONE operations on 8 November.
During the discussion I outlined to him a general proposal
which had been bruited about during my recent TDY at
LCPIPIT in mid-October. In substance, this proposal was
that following QRPHONE's forthcoming trips through
Scandinavia and Africa, he then repair to either

for an extended period of time. In either 0:
these locations he would then attempt to identify and
to enlist the cooperation of various unwitting contacts
in the left sector of the student and youth population,
who could assume in time the trappings of a Maoist study
group. QRPHONE would have excellent cover for doing so
inasmuch as he is an established writer of the Maoist
stripe. His relationship with these contacts or followers
would not be set in the routine JKLANCE operational con-
text. Rather, he would guide and motivate such contacts
as would an alleged covert representative of a Maoist
group, and would have been a member of a larger

such group He would, of course, imply
to his fol) ers attempting to develop a
similar nucleus in ee whenever, as
good Communists should.

2.. Operational activity would be of a twofold nature.
First, exploitation of the prospective group of Maoists
would follow along lines of a typical black Communist

| the kind of notional movement which
leveloped in the Middle East some seven or
eight years ago. Hopefully, these unwitting followers, in
turn, would each recruit two or three other sympathizers
who over time could distribute anti-Soviet literature and
é perform other low-key CA operations, as directed by the
Station, and which could be attributed to the PRC.
Presumably their actions would result in some local

- embarrassment to the USSR and the PCI. Second, QRPHONE,

himself, would no doubt enhance his own Maoist credentials--
already strong--to the point where he might well become

‘4, The charge is made that QRPHONE is too thinly
spread and there is a recurring urge that his targetting
be better focussed. Can he in fact be better focussed
on a multi-divisional basis or would focussing, in i
practice,result in his being narrowed down to a primarily ‘=
divisional target?

5. Granting that the CIA label is somewhat in-
discriminately used for character assassination in the
conspiratorial fringe in which QRPHONE has been operating,
isn't he in fact stuck with this label and in view of ‘
the international character of this conspiratorial menersseeiat
fringe, won't it turn up wherever he goes? In this milieu
is there really much chance he will be given any signifi-
cant information (and not deception information) by anyone
who will do so because he wants the information passed
to CIA?

6. When he was looked into in April 1968 by a
Chicom official, what do we suppose to be meant by the
officials finding that it was not clear if he was

i “toro complaints to JADAIN about QRPHONE/1's contacts with expstriates

‘in London, SMOVID expressed JAGUAR's concern about QRPIONE/1's security

and its view that QRPHONE/1'S information was of icarginal value. SMOVID

emphasizing that he was expressing a view personally endorsed by

~| SMUPSILON, outlined three possible options: withdraw QPPIONC/1 from

JAGUAR take over the running of QRPHONE/1. (\)RPHONE/1 subsequently was

.tion,. to JELANCE Station, without reference to SMOTH's explana-

: tion Bioteeens? Could elect. to reopen the discussion in terms of a

'h “| possible change of atmosphere since the change of IDEN. Such a dis-

‘Ed €ussion at least should give an indication of whether SMOTH's explana-

‘sion &s JAGUAR's (and JKLANCE's) major obstacle.

ee 25 Were QRPHONE/1 permitted to resume his London contacts he
ay ‘gould obtain some information of the type JKLANCE would like to get
'E-] @rom JAGUAR. But, in view of the June 1970 S{UPSILON-approved SMOVID
‘4] flenarche to JADWIN, it might be unwise, for the mowent at least, to
sound out JAGUAR about reactivating QRPHONE/1. he would appreciate
Ea] ‘weceiving Lendon Station's views on this subject.

nt 8. One finsl point that should be noted is that/ in
forwarding the above-mentioned JAGUAR report on 24 December 0,
gontioned that visiting ZIBET officer Jeremy !}. FREYMARK recently had
¢] @iscussed these JKLANCE req London with SMOVID, SMENDIVE
n| end SMEVICT and that it was understanding that "it was
gencrally agreed to linit our requests in the future to selected ©
which there is evidence of coup plotting or subversion.”
ided that he looked forward to any followup questions based
om the above criteria that Headquarters wanted the Station to submit to
- *s recollection of his talks with JAGUAR is at slight
fe] variance with) account. FREYMARK recalls that he had agreed
Ip] to limit Ji requests to those cases in which JKLANCE had
i Cee interest and where there was. good reason to suspect a real
e at to. the stebility of the African country against which the London-
He ‘based African might be ecting. Accordingly, there is attached a select
(“| 24st of individuals ebout whose contacts and activities JKLANCE would
af Qike to havo updated inforsation from JAGUAR. The type of information
fi desire is iadicated by the illustrative questions and other data
7 + and replay of our request. whereas we would iike to have unsolicited
i Scgular. seporting on these targets, we reulize that JAGUAR is not

equipped er prepared to accept such a continuing requirencnt. te believd
that tho attached list along with the paragraph five discussion pegged

- to s change of IDENS are good pegs for GIBSON or his designee in re-
(axe with JAGUAR.

PROJECT: QRPHONE STATUS: Contract Agent (Under
tai @ Menecrardum of Ore).
Agreement)

COVERT JOB DESCRIPTION: Singleton agent targeted at the radical left,
meluding Maoist, African liberation, and Palestinian groups.
Q/1's access derives from his many contacts in these circles.

PERFORMANCE OF COVERT DUTIES: Q/1 continues to perform well and i
Without posing problems for his handler. His personality is i
easy-going and his attitude positive. If his efforts are not 1
always totally successful ~- leaving us with tantalizing bits '
of information and many. unanswered questions -- this is generally
due to operational circumstances in which he was simply unable H
to elicit more information on a given subject,

i

PERFORMANCE OF OVERT DUTIES: Q/1 does a solid and workmanlike job E i

as a journalist. He has acquitted himself well both as a

representative of his cover firm and in his free lance activity.
Occasional prompting on this subject produces added effort and
in this connection the operation profits particularly from the
energy and knowledge of the deep-cover agent handler who himself
has faced similar cover demands over many years.

ATTITUDE TOWARD JKLANCE: QRPHONE/1's attitude is positive. (See below
‘under Motivation. fi |

ATTITUDE TOWARD COVER EMPLOYER: Q/1's attitude is good. He has made
an effort to discharge his part of the cover arrangement and to
understand the weaknesses and problems which plagued his former
cover organization. He is approaching his new cover arrangement
with enthusiasm.

MOTIVATION IN ACCEPTING JKLANCE RELATIONSHIP: This is a subject on’
which a good deal has beensaid over the course of this operation.
The following points can be made on the subject of Q/1's
motivation: - * 3 a a

A. His basic image of JKLANCE is positive.

: . SECRET



’ ' ee wi val

B. This image of JKLANCE as a powerful, professional
organization has been enhanced in Q/l's case by the
circumstances of his agent relationship, which require
very professional handling. Indecd. Q/1 has probably come
to hold a rather glamorous “storybook” image of JKLANCE
and of the importance of his contribution to the JKLANCE
effort. This is a very human trait and should not be.
exaggerated in his case, but every one of the wild anti-
JKLANCE stories which he heard probably only serves to =
accentuate the feeling on his part of being a member of
@ very impressive outfit.

C. In his political evolution over the years, Q/1
has become active in at least two "causes". In both
instances he saw these causes undermined by petty jealousy
and factional struggles and in both cases he was personally
harmed as a result. The product of this situation has been
a certain disillusionment with "causes" and a cynical political
outlook. (In other circumstances this might be called
political maturity.) Q/1 now tends to view political trends
as a detached observer rather than a participant.

D. Following on the foregoing thought is the fact
that he is an American (and does not consider himself
disloyal). Given his citizenship and his disinclination to
feel "involved" in the currents of the radical left, he
has been perfectly willing to accept employment by JKLANCE
to report on those currents. He does not give any indication
that he views this as "squealing" on his friends -- indeed
the contrary seems to be the case.

E. On a more mundane level, it must be realized that
Q/1 was recruited at a time when he was in serious financial
straits. He was without a job and was living off the charity
of his wife's family. JKLANCE has given him a job, paid
him reasonably well and regularly, and has enabled him to
be independent of his wife's family's charity.

F. Having accepted JKLANCE employment for a combination
of the reasons set forth above, it must be added that Q/1

‘clearly likes his work. He enjoys dealing with international

issues and political subjects. He enjoys the travel and
the opportunity to exercise his language capability. In
short, the rather sophisticated and cosmopolitan life which
he has been able to live appeals to him.

G. In assessing the relative importance of these
everal factors which make up Q/l's motivation, the under-
signed would stress that C and E were probably the immediate
causes of his acceptance of recruitment while A and D were more
underlying. B and F have arisen since recruitment and
probably play an important role in his current motivation.

mure’s ATTITUDE TOWARD JKLANCE: “ofits wife is not witting of his
a ation. je was allowed to believe that he was

Soreiae indirectly for the Chinese. She certainly is aware
of the past JKLANCE accusations which have been leveled at
Q/1, but as iar as Wl can determine (and this is not a subject
on which he can come right out and ask a direct question) she
continues to a the Chinese story . It ‘should be added
that Mrs. Q/1 is the holder of some rather
typical "left" anti-JKLANCE attitudes. It should. also be noted
that the relationship between the two is. fraught with a variety
of problems thereby adding to the complexity of the situation.
Certainly the whole subject. of Q/l's activities is one which
Mrs. Q/1 views with misgivings and which is simply not discussed —-
lest it lead to acrimony. Mention should also be made that t
Mrs. Q/1 seems to accept as legitimate the small amount of
money received from Q/l's cover and to regard this as a genuine
stringer relationship.

RESPONSE TO CASE OFFICER HANDLING: QRPHONE/1 has a very pleasant
personality and responds well to Case Officer handling. He is
a most willing asset requiring no special handling care -- other
than the normal professionalism expected in the handling of a
sensitive asset such as Q/l.

WILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT INSTRUCTIONS OR GUIDANCE: Q/1 is willing to
‘accept guidance and criticism -- prov.ded it is constructive.
If anything, he may sometimes be too willing. His willingness
eccasionally exceeds his sense of security and it then falls
to his handler to bear in mind security and/or operational
considerations which may affect his pursuit of a given target.
However, this should not be over dramatized.

RESPONSIVENESS: Q/1 is most responsive to requirements levied upon
m this connection it should be recalled that his ability
to respond fully is usually restricted by the nature of his
relationship with his informants; i.e., since he is only eliciting
the information from unwitting informants he is rarely able to
Press for all the desired detuils.

JKLANCE CONTROL: Q/1 is dependent upon a JKLANCE salary and he has

———signed recruitment documents and a security pledge. We hasten
to add that Q/l is not a handling problem and there has never
been any instance in which either he or his handler has had
occasion to allude to these control factors.

PERSONAL SECURITY: Q/1 has a good sense of personal security and his
ndler makes an effort to build upon this at every opportunity.
As cited above, Q/1's enthusiasm sometimes leads to his failure
to consider all aspects and implications of a given situation.

OTHER SECURITY AND COVER SITUATIONS: The past ‘allegations of Q/l's
affiliation wit NCE, many pre-dating his actual recruitment,
add an extra dimension to Q/l's cover situation. We have no
indication that any of these allegations are based on any proof,
nor have they produced a significant reduction in his number of.
contacts. :

ABILITY TO WORK WITHOUT SUPERVISION: Q/1 is a self-starter and can
work well for extended periods without supervision.

ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS: Q/1 poses only a minimum administrative
urden. fe-is not overly concerned about his administrative
and financial position, allowances, payments, etc. He merely
expects JKLANCE to do the fair thing by him. However, on the
rare occasion when JKLANCE has failed to perform as he expected,
he can be very upset.

REPORTING: Q/1 is a journalist by training. He is an effective
reporter -- both in terms of ability to elicit and writing
style.

PERSONAL ENERGY AND ENDURANCE: Q/1 is quite energetic and can continue
“~“his efforts ona sustained basis. -

LANGUAGES: In addition to his (native) English, Q/1 can speak French,
alian and German.

WILLINGNESS TO TRAVEL: Q/1 is quite willing to travel -- and even
enjoys itt

AREA KNOWLEDGE: Q/1 is quite widely travelled in Europe and Africa
‘and consequently has acquitted an extensive area knowledge.

ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL ABILITY: Q/1's present operating context
joes not provide an adequate basis to evaluate these talents. It
is assumed that he has a satisfactory competence in both these
areas, however.

WEAKNESSES; PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL: Q/1 has no major weaknesses,
either personal or professional which inhibit his operational
use. The existence of his “reputation” as a JKLANCE asset --
which is believed by some and rejected by others of his contacts
4s a definite limitation on his employment.

«. CAREER POSSIBILITIES: Q/1 has mentioned to his. handler that he hopes
0 be able to make a career of his relationship with JKLANCE. He
enjoys the work and presumably the financial security. However,

——reprneeeenn ye



the combination of the security factors operative in thia
case and the unlikelihood of Q/l's continuéd access to targets
of interest over a prolonged period argue against his being
regarded as a career asset.

AARON C. LAGI TRA
FIELD CASE OFFICER

COMMENTS OF SUPERVISOR: This is another thoughtful evaluation of this
agent, and reflects the views of the agent handler as well as of the
Case Officer.

I doubt that we have really divined Y's motivations for working
with JKLANCE, and this evaluation should be read as the best stab
we can make at this enigmatic subject.

1970, Attention: Chief, Covert Training/0s/72,
Subject: Covert Training for QRPHOHS/1, Zrous
Deputy Chief, Covert Action Start

1. QRPHORE/1 was treined covertly on 14, 15, 16
October 1970. There were twelve hours of training in the three sessions.

2. In eccordance with the reference training request ond discussions
between the instructor and the two Case Officers, QRPH(RB/1 was given
@ concentrated dosage of reporting instruction with emphasis on spotting
! and assessment reports.

3. GRPHONE/1 is a professionel writer, so there was no problen
in the writing desartnent. The need wes for channelling the writing
capabilities of this man who has been an Agent fo: five years, into
our type of reporting and io end his "stream of consciousness" style
of reporting, as one Cese Officer put it.

4, QRPHONE/1 quite quickly got into the spirit of the training
end by the end of the first session was obviously enjoying it end
epprecieting the opportimity to learn to write our way. He pointed
out that his big problen is having to retein substential emomts of
information in his head for two or three weeks, then put it all dom he,
the night before he meets his Case Officer. From his conversation, t {
it eppeered that organizing a report had never occurred to hin before , eo
and he several tines said "no one ever told ne avout this", "this is # “jp Ast
the first I've learned of this, etc.” ‘hese things were said in happines: ot :

making his reporting less of a chore end more of a joy.

true of other equally highly Literate trainees, who, Like QRIGZ/1,

9. Yor the final session, he had been asled to do assessment
reports of two people. He was rortified vhen he care in on the last
morning, linppily handed in his five intel reports and suddenly realized
that he het completely forgotten to do the other reports. ilowever,
in discussing spotting end assessment reports, it appears that he now
understate them.

10, In en effort to cvaluate the effectiveness of the treining,
we would &ypreciate a deteiled evaluation report in Noverber 1971 fron
the field Atation. This report should indicate the extent to which the
training hing made the trainee a nore useful and effective esset and should
evaluate te performance in each area of tradecraft in which training wes

For the record we are forwarding, u/s/c, a copy of the

status of QRPHONE/1's action against Jacques Verges. As Head-

good advantage in conncction with his recent trip to Algiers.
The letter says, in effect, that Verges has proposed a settle-

rand has agreed to pay this settlement in
Needless to say, QRPHONE/1 has yet to receive
payment. fevertheless QRPHONE/1's purposes are well served by

migration officials when he entered the lounge. He then went to the
duty free shop to purchase a bottle of Scotch and a carton of cigarettes |
for his wife (she smokes Galoises). He presumes that his passport slippe
from his pocket during the process of producing his wallet to pay for
these items. At any rate he did not discover the loss until the flight

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Chief, CA Staff
SUBJECT: LCPIPIT Request for ORPHONE/I Salary Increase

REFERENCE: OEPA - 2122

1, The following is a breakdown of QRPHONE/1's salary history:

Starting salary, June 1965 $600 per month
1 September 1966 $700 per month
1 July 1967 $800 per month

was given an additional $50 per month (also tax free) ae our contribution
toward some form of insurance against the future (endowment, lump sum
cach value, or whatever the Fleld and he finally selected), This appears on
the books as a salary increase. However, although to his ultimate advantage,
It does result in a small decrease in take-home pay since @/1 ls also required
to make s contribution to the payment of the premium.

2. In addition, Q/l's MOC also provides for $10,000 indemnification in
case of death, or payment of $600 per month up to $10, 000 to his wife in case '
of his total incapacitation or disappearance while employed by CIA. Allowance
had originally been made for this provision when he seemed to have an excellent
chance for travel this year we included the provision as a general
benefit, not tied to any particular type of hazardous travel alone. Finally,
this year's amendment to his MOC also included a severance bonus of one
month's salary for each year of satisfactory service. We placed $3,200 Ina
special escrow account to cover his previous four year: ervice, and are
providing in cur Project renewals for each year's required deposit to that
escrow account. Please note, however, that this benefit has not yet been
surfaced either to ORPHONE/1 or to RODIGAST, by decision of LCPIPIT (a
decision which I believe wae wise).

3. It is my feeling that the proposed salary Increase of $250 tax free
per month Is way out of line. I belleve that paragraph 3 of the reference,
comparing Q/1 with a hypothetical GS-12 is a rather specious and unrealistic
argoment. Q/l1, although an American, is an agent, and nothing more, and as
you note in your penciled comment the question of quarters, allowances, and
perlodic step increases is not relevant. In addition, while I do not subscribe


7 SECRET

to some of the criticisms that have been leveled at his production, the fact
remains that I h-ve not seen any marked Improvement during the past two
years Ln the guallty of the materlal he provides us. As time goes on and
the realistic criteria of what le disseminable and what is not are applied
more and more to his production, and this production in tarn remains at Its
present level of superficiality, we will see lcsa and less of It qualify for
dissemination, Since he is an FI agent, this has considerable significance,
although It of course does not present the full picture of hie capabilities. His
operational intelligence has been received with mixed evaluations; usually
his initial coverage of a subject is very well recelved and often whets the
appetite of the recipient for more; somehow, however, that "more" never
seems to materialize -- they get more of exactly the same caliber, but
little more in terms of depth of reporting. Perhaps the fault lies in QRPHONE/1,
in which case we should realize early that what we have here is not a true

Fl agent, but s sort of "operational Intelligence butterfly." Perhaps, on the
other hand, the fault lies in RODIGAST's handling of the man, not in terms of
the personal relationship which RODIGAST has been able to build up with him,
but maybe even because of that relationship. I remember when I first talked
with RODIGAST I quickly realized that he felt he knew more than Headquarters
as to what was important for Q/l to cover and what wae not; I am sorry I

jd RODIGAST on his TDY here and when I was| and that his
home leave has been postponed, for I had hoped to determine for myself
whether RODIGAST stiii felt that way. Whatever the reason, I am by no means
giving up on Q/1, but will continus to try to narrow down his targets so that

he will have a falr shake at showing what he can do when he is not allowed to
cover the waterfront.

4, What the above paragraph Is leading up to, Is that I do not in all
honesty feel that he has done anything to really deserve a promotion, except
balld longevity since the last one, and perhaps not follow up (actively) on that
newspaper job offered to him (bis preference, in any event). However, Ido
realize that a man must have an incentive, and would like to propose that we
suggest to LCPIFIT that a more realistic increase might be in the nelghborhood
ef $100 a month, and that the severance bonus mentioned In paragraph 2 above
might now be surfaced both to RODIGAST and to Q/l as a new benefit.

for details.

eration movement.” Sce OEPA ~ 2037, 2099 und 2123.

Following an overature from a U.S. newspaper QRPHONE/1 made a quick trip }
to consult with Headquarters officers regarding the impli- ‘i
a cations of this overature on his RVROCK status. See LCPIPIT 4222 and
7 DIRECTOR 28728 for details. : = :

Through two unwitting female informants QRPHONE/1 was able to obtain re-

- porting on the Algiers Cultural Pestival. Seo OELA ~ 51298. :
QRPHONE/1 has continued his monitoring of the activity of various African
liberation movement figures in London.

SPECIFIC MATTERS OP OP=RATIONAL SECURITY AND COVER: QRPHONE/1's vacation
with his family produced a marked improvement in his domestic
situation - with its consequent impact upon the cover and security of the
entire operation. ‘This remains a matter of concern and one which will be
carefully monitored. : 5 oe

of this matter (which are thought to be mjnimal) please see DIRECTOR 46178.

“ ESTIMATZ O? AGENT'S CONTINUED DEGREE OF ACCESS TO TARGETS: QRPHONE/1's
' a6GéSS EO His Various targets remains substantially unchanged.

EXTENT TO WHICH AGENT FAS BEEN ABLE TO SERVICE ASSIGNMENTS, INCLUDING
(_ | INTELLIGENCE PRODUCTION: QRPHONZ/1 has approached all his assignments with t
: enthusiasm and energy. He has fulfilled these assignments to the maximum .



: ae
de%ree feasible ~- given nis cover and the unwitting informant-type nature
of his relationship with his many contacts. QRPHONE/1 makes every effort
to overcome this limitation and in this regard a plentiful supply.of  back-
ground information greatly facilitates his clicitation of added details
from his informants. However, this limitation is one which will always
be with us in the case of QRPHONZ/1 and it is one which can sometimes be
particularly frustrating. During the past quarter QRPHONE/1 has been the
source of 11 intelligence reports prepared by LCPIPIT/Reports.

SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS LEVIED UPON AGENT FOR ENSUING PERIOD:. QRPHONE/1L
will make a trip in late September und early October in order to
survey the situation within the Italian new left/radical sector. This
trip is one which has been requested by Rome Station. (The trip will have
been completed by the time thir report is received by Neadquarters.)

QRPHONE/1's contact with an official of tho Eritrean Liberation Front lea
to a TDY by AP Division officer to brief LCPIPIT on
the ELP and to discuss possibla vat exploitation of this contact.

QRPHONE/1's trip to the United States has been deferred until spring 1970
by which time any possible repercussions from QRPEONY's return will be
relatively unlikely.

An effort will be made to explore the operational possibilities posed by
QRPHONE/1's existing (or potential) contacts within the Arab liberation
movements. Headquarters views on this matter were requested in OEPA-2044.

A reescheduling of QRPHONE/1*s trip has been proposed and
Hea@quarters and have been asked for guidance/requirements.

AGENT'S PERSONAL RESPONSE TO ASSIGIVENTS LEVIED INCLUDING MOTIVATION,
PERSONAL SECU! QRPHONE/1"s response to assignuents, like his
performanc ies to be enthusiastic and energetic. The comments
made in previous quarterly reporting regarding his security and motivation
remain valid insofar as RODIGAST and LCPIPIT are able to judge.

AGENT'S PERSONAL RESPONSE TO CASS OFFICER HANDLING OR CRITIQUE OF HIS
REPORTING TECHNIQUs: QRPHONE/1 has a very pleasant personality and re-
Tates easily to others. This is a positive factor in his elicitation of
information from his many contacts and also makes dealing with him a
pleasant and uncomplicated experience. QRPHONE/1 accepts case officer
handling - including direction and criticisn - well and in a constructive
vein. The same holds true of critique of his reporting. Please see pre-
vious reporting on this subject for added details. :

ADMINISTRATIVE MATTERS, INCLUDING PROMOTIONS, TRAINING: A new means of
funding QRPHONE/1's salary is now being devised. This has béen the subject
of several items of correspondence between Headquarters and LCPIPIT. We
plan to consult with the xepresentative bn this matter.

QRPHONE/1 has had some purely overt problems with his| bank (an
apparent error in his statement, etc.) He is also being charged very high
service charges for the performance of routine transfers. If he is not’
able to resolve his problems with this bank it may be necessary for hin

to change banks. .

.

At LCPIPIT's insistance QRPHONE/1 has begun to invest a portion of his
monthly salary in a reputable Mutual Pund of his choice. This modest
anvestment program will enhance his financial security in the event of .
termination and/or a rainy day".

As you know, there have been some indications-in the past

be in touch with and on one occasion provided
QRPHONE with a report (on QRPEONY) which came almost
simultaneously from JAGUAR. Clearly, this does not add up

to much of a case, and we could hardly conceive that JAGUAR
would be involved in the harrassment of NE. Even if

it might be possible that JAGUAR a = to our understanding

1. As addressees are aware QRPHONE/1 has officially been
denied entry into Switzerland since 16 December 1963. This order
was issued in connection with his employment with Identity A,
which was then receiving money from the Chinese--in violation of
Swiss neutrality. A similar order was also issued at that time
for Identity B, who was the Editor of Identity A.

2. It is now some six years later and QRPHONE/1 (at least
overtly) is employed as a legitimate journalist. He is not a
member of any group which is proscribed by the Swiss authorities--
although, of course, he maintains contact with a wide variety of
leftist individuals in pur.uit of his operational tasks. QRPHONE/1
has noted that Identity B has been allowed back into Switzerland-~
in connection with his defense of Arab terrorists and feels that
if the Swiss are willing to do this for Identity B then they should
also lift the ban on his entry into Switzerland. QRPHONE/1
obviously feels personally about this, and it may be that future
operational benefit could be gained if QRPHONE/1 were again able
to enter Switzerland.

3. We are forwarding under separate cover a copy of a report
written QRPHONE/1 following his contact with the Swiss Embassy

jon this matter. We are also forwarding under separate
cover a copy of the letter which he sent the Embassy in which he
formally states his request that the entry ban be lifted.

4. You will note that the Swiss Embassy suggested that
QRPHONE/1 work throush the U.S. Embassy on this matter. We have
told QRPHOME/1 not to do this, but rather to deal directly with
the Swiss. If he needs certification of his status as a working
journalist we suggested that QRPHONE/1 obtain this from the appro-
peicts profzseioral organization (of which he is a member) in
London.

5. We presume that the Swiss Embassy will be
forwarding QRPHONE/1's letter to Bern. We will appreciate being
advised of any Swiss action, or statements, on this case which
may come to the attention of 3ern Station. Any advice which Bern
Station can offer regarding QRPHONE/1's pursuit of this matter
will be welcome.

6. O£ course Bern Station should continue to be guided by
the contents of DIRECTOR-69543 in any dealings with the Swiss
concerning QRPHONE/1.

as which are obviously known to the security
authorities. Furthermore QRPHONE/1 himself might think
it odd that he was being treated in that fashion and

suspect that was aware of his role which
would not help lationship with him. Alternatively
(a) would obviously be a nuisance to say the least, so we

felt that the obvious answer was (b) i.e. an extension of
another year on present conditions.”

We have attached QRPHONE/1's brief report of his visit
tc obtain this visa renewal.

1, Attached find contact and subject reports covering
activities of KULPA during the month of January 1963. The two
outstanding characterjstics of this project remain a helter-
skelter operational pattern and the usual difficulties in
administration,

can not really blame KULPA for the former, His
forte is.aoving around and being able to convince. These tvo
Qualities are rare enough not to demand in too loud a voice
for the third--serious concentration on a long range target.
It 1o not that KULPA lacks the proressionaliem, rather it is
the tempo of his personal and professional lifo that inclines

. bin to speed rather than accuracy, As last aonth was marked by
the stop and go of | 19 thie month vas hampered by
the upcoming Congo voyage, It is not that those ventures are
unimportant, it simply remains difficult to judge KULPA's
Performance on events occuring outside our area of competence.

: 3. We can say nothing new or nothing untrue on the adain-
Aetrative aspects of the project. The cry ie the same froa
#11 snall stations--why must eo much valuable tine be spent on
tiny administrative detail, In KULPA's
porhape compounded by his transfer from
complete file is living eviderce of the

In the regular four way breakdown, tne file reflects
slnost no paper in Plans and Development, Production 1s not
fat, Operations ie fuller but transitory, Support ie 3 crollen,

blistoring monster, Ye see no ond to it. Our present agenda

for the next KULPA meeting calls for a discussion of
Soparate aduinistrative items. One more chestnut and ¥o are —
finished. The KULPAS of the world take precise careful case «

officoring with sufficient time prior and post the meeting to
bring order‘ froa chaos, It is just this tine that a small

station lacks, So far, we are glad to state, KULPA seems to a

worth the price paid. * .

On 12 March 1969 QRPHONE/1 was granted an extension on his
\vali@ until 15 February 1970.

2. Since QRPHONE/1's file at the Home Office indicates an
interest on the part of JAGUAR in his case, JAGUAR was consulted
prior to the issuance of the extension. (This is not unusual in
the cases of persons such as QRPHONE/1 and does not necessarily
imply an “agent” status. Of course WOFIKM is not mentioned at all
in this file.) In coordination with London Station it was decided
that a re-newal of QRPHONE/1's one-year visa was preferable to the
granting of permanent resident status--which would normally have
been the case. We quote from the appropriate memorandum from JAGUAR
to London Station on this matter:

“The choice was between:-

a) an extension of two months

b) an extension of one year i.e. a repeat of what
was granted to him last year

c) that his temporary residence should be made

"unconditional" which would be the normal

procedure if there were no special considerations.

Our feeling was that for QRPHONE/1's cover purposes (c)
would be undesirable; if his friends got to know of it
they might think he was being treated over-generously in
view of his contacts with leftwing revolutionaries such
