2022 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992

28 July 1994

Results of 25 July meeting with Mike Getsey and Steve Tilley

re JFK database extract.

The following item numbers are keyed to Martha Sanfacon's

memo of 27 June, same subject.

#I. "restricted data" -- NARA will accept disk with

restricted data withheld.

Issues will be re-visited after a

decision on disposition of CIA's classified (retention) JFK

collection.

#2. Exemption Codes -- The Agency is not required to use

the additional exemption codes or add them to its system,

however, they must be accounted for in the extract disk...

Getsey suggested that this could be done by the extract

program.

Question: is it possible to add a couple of codes

without a major programming problem?

#3.

White paper for Iden Aids - yes.

#4. Keywords -- NARA has no problem with the length of

CIA's 15 character field for keywords, however, with the

current format NARA can only search on the first keyword.

Each keyword needs to be a separate entity on the extract

disk.

#5. Title Field -- NARA is expanding the title field to cut

down on the number of truncated titles. Does not effect HRG

system which is already 250 characters.

#6.

"Identification Number" -- Move date/time ID number to

Comment Section along

• with box numbers and folder

information (#8).

"Open Criteria" -- Field can be blank.

Use only for

special restrictions on documents; unlikely that CIA will

have documents that require using this field.

Need to

delete canned statement.
