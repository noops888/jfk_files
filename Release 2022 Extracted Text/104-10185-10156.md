fellowirg information concerning MORO: .

MORO 1s a very hard worker and works with preciaton and accuracy.

Politicaliy he is a secure CASTRO supporter, but with intolligence and

moderation. He ls serdous, perhaps excessively reserved, but docs sot

lack.communication of the capacity to Inapire sympathy from both his

collcagucs ai the Embassy and the llailan's withi whom le comes in cortacl.

He never apeaks of bis family. His commercial work at the Embasay

follows the normal oftice routine without any particular security treatmert..

Hls hiring of technical personnel is considered extremely clanailled and ho

refers these mattera directly to the ambassador; no one elec la suthorizod

to have contact with candidates for work in his area. MORO does not use

a automuviie with Coryo dipinnatt lags, provably sur security reasons,:

but Instead drivea a Renault R-8 with temporary license tags which are

valid for one year.
