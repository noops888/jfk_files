cast over radio station WITA, San Juan, Puerto Rico, on 13 January

tive study, the following facts were Ho P|

a. Tt is useless to demand ‘aid from the United States be~
cause the US policy on the Cuban situation is not, cooperative.
We must decide not to leave the liberation of Guba in the hands
of foreigners since it is more our duty to liberate Cuba than
theirs. We have to take action in order to see Cuba liberated
because the Communist regime will never be overthrown by internal
revolt. The decision open to Cubans has two alternatives: the
decision to fight or the decision to submit to losing their
country. We have chosen the alternative to fight for the ulti-
mate liberation of Cuba, without considering the elements of {
time delay or resulting pain from this decision. Pas

b. Reports from our clandestine operators in Cuba re-
vealed the communist plans for Castro's action in 1963, which
are as follows:

(1) To reach a rapprochement with the US Government
through arbitration of the Mexican and Brazilian Governnents.
The Castro regime will assure that it will leave the Moscow
orbit as a satellite and will convert Cuba into a nationalist
socialist country similar to Yugoslavia. fe

We “$s

(2): The first phase of the plan was the release of
the Playa Giron prisoners. The next stage of the plan is to
offer indemities for US property and goods that were confis~
cated two years ago in Cuba. Payment will be made with sugar.

# i iar as
REGRADED UNGEASSIFIED

This plan is under consideration by 'pacifist' elements within
the US Government. Castro's plan includes (2) amnesty to po~
litical prisoners, several of whom have already been released;
and (b) to hold ‘elections! at a propitious time, which will
surely constitute a ‘fixed election.' .

c.. The thesis of ALPHA 66 is to carry out the war of
Liberation of Cuba.

d. The plans of ALPHA 66 are:

(1) ALPHA 66 and the Second National Front of the
Escambray have joined together with military equipment and the
necessary men to initiate war.

(2) We are preparing to increase the attacks soon
to initiate war on Cuban territory, which will lead to the
ultimate downfall of the Castro regime.

(3) ‘Even without material assistance from friendly
governments, the struggle against international commnism on
Cuban soil will begin.

(4) Clandestine operators are in place to stage
aids, sabotage and espionage with the general. purpose to pre-_
pare the conditions for general insurrections.

(5) ‘The aim of the comnando activities is to con-
tinue harrassing the Castro Government, such as the raids on
Caibarien, Isabela de Sagua and Juan Francisco. The raids are
part of a carefully laid out plan peplfing the liberation of Cuba.

“Pidel Castro mows of our activities and is aware that
this time the fight is against men dedicated to liberating Cuba
at all costs. The end is just a matter of time. We call Cubans
to unite in a struggle without animosities. Personal differences
must be forgotten. The enemy is too powerful and our cause too
beautiful to continue the envy and intrigues of political aubi~
tions. Our motto should be War First and Debate Later. The
plans, weapons and the necessary men for the emancipation Cuba
are ready to carry out their trust."

RY) m article printed in the 17 January 1963 edition of
“the San Juan, Puerto Rico English language daily THE SAN JUAN
STAR quoted VECIANA as stating that Eloy GUTIERREZ Menoyo,
leader of the Second Front of the Escanbray organization, had
been making secret visits to Cuba in Novenber and December 1962 -
© orgaiizing underground activities. VECIANA said that resistance
Jeaders in groups of two and three are being infiltrated into
Guba. According to him, GUTIERREZ Menoyo has been stationed at
a secret Caribbean island base of the Escanbray group since
October 1962. VECIANA added that from this secret base they
have been broadcasting to Cuba every night at 2200 hours and
have been also landing equipment there. Members of the Escam—
“pray group, according to VECIANA, have held secret meetings with
about 30 officials of the CASTRO régime who are ready to join a
resistance movement.

{6} Comments: According to the source of VECIANA's speech,
” the information appearing in the speech was received from clan~
destine operators located in Cuba, and was transmitted through
‘a clandestine commmnications system available to VECIANA and
OPERATION ALPHA 66. In the opinion of the confidential source,
VECIANA's statements in his speech, although slightly exaggerated
and embellished, are valid. The confidential source is convinced
that OPERATION ALPHA 66 has the resources and capabilities to

carry out the "action" program of warfare on Cuban territory out=

lined in VECIANA's speech.

{6} Ina statenent dated 8 November 1962, the original
OPERATION ALPHA 66 members announced VECIANA's "resignation"
“after his disclosure of his ties with the GUTIEEREZ Menoyo group.
Henceforth, the statement added, the group would be mown as
--NiGomandos 1-66" to distinguish themselves from VECIANA who _
insisted in using the name of ALPHA 66.
