1963 are set forth.

Briefly, VECIANA stated "ALPHA 66" determi-

cooperative"• He also outlined Fidel CASTRO's plans for action

in 1963 as "reported by our clandestine operators in Cuba."

A

local press report of 17 January 1963 indicated that Floy

GUTIERREZ Menoyo, leader of the "Second Escambray Front" to which

the ALPHA 66 is allied, had recently returned from a clandes-

tine visit to his followers inside Cuba.

democratic forces over the Cuban Communist regime.

This plan is

based on our historical struggle for freedom.

After an exhaus-

tive study, the following facts were revealed:

38

a.

cause the US policy on the Cuban situation is not cooperative.

We must decide not to leave the liberation of Cuba in the hands

of foreigners since it is more our duty to liberate Cuba than

theirs. We have to take action in order to see Cuba liberated

because the Cormunist regime will never be overthrown by internal

revolt. The decision open to Cubans has two alternatives; the

decision to fight or the decision to submit to losing their

country. We have chosen the alternative to fight for the ulti-

mate liberation of Cuba, without considering the elements of

time delay or resulting pain from this decision.

b. Reports from our clandestine operators in Cuba re-

vealed the communist plans for Castro's action in 1963, which

are as follows:

(1) To reach a rapprochement with the US Government

through arbitration of the Mexican and Brazilian Governments.

The Castro regime will assure that it will leave the Moscow

orbit as a satellite and will convert Cuba into a nationalist

socialist country similar to Yugoslavia.

(2) The first phase of the plan was the release of

the Playa Giron prisoners.

The next stage of the plan is to

offer indemnities for US property and goods that were confis-

cated two years ago in Cuba. Payment will be made with sugar.

This plan is under consideration by 'pacifist' elements within

the US Government.

Castro's plan includes (a) amnesty to po-

litical prisoners, several of whom have already been released;

and (b) to hold

'elections' at a propitious time, which wil

surely constitute a 'fixed election.

The thesis of ALPHA 66 is to carry out the war of

liberation of Cuba.

d. The plans of ALPHA 66 are:

• ALPHA 66 and the Second National Front of ti

cambray have joined together with military equipment and tr

necessary men to initiate war.

(2)

We are preparing to increase the attacks soon

to initiate war on Cuban territory, which will lead to the

ultimate downfall of the Castro regime.

(3) Even without material assistance from friendly

governments, the struggle against international communism on

Cuban soil will begin.

(4) Clandestine operators are in place to stage

raids, sabotage and espionage with the general purpose to pre-

pare the conditions for general insurrections.

(5) The aim of the commando activities is to con

tinue harrassing the Castro Government, such as the raids on

Caibarien, Isabela de Sagua and Juan Francisco.

part of a carefully laid out plan seeking the liberation of Cuba.

"Fidel Castro knows of our activities and is aware that

this time the fight is against men dedicated to liberating Cuba

at all costs.

The end is just a matter of time.

We call Cubans

to unite in a struggle without animosities..

Personal differences

must be forgotten.

The enemy is too powerful and our cause too

beautiful to continue the envy and intrigues of political ambi-

tions. Our motto should be War First and Debate Later.

plans, weapons and the necessary men for the emancipationo Cuba

are ready to carry out their trust."

An article printed in the 17 January 1963 edition of

San Juan, Puerto Rico English language daily THE SAN JUAN

STAR quoted VECIANA as stating that Eloy GUTIERREZ Menoyo,

leader of the Second Front of the Escambray organization,

been making secret visits to Cuba in November and December 1962

organizing underground activities.

VECIANA said that resistance

leaders in groups of two and three are being infiltrated into

According to him, GUTIERREZ Menoyo has been stationed at

a secret Caribbean island base of the Escambray group since

October 1962.

VECIANA added that from this secret base they

have been broadcasting to Cuba every night at 2200 hours and

have been also landing equipment there. Members of the Escam-

bray group, according to VECIANA, have held secret meetings with

about 30 officials of the CASTRO regime who are ready to join a

resistance movement.

(0) Comments: According to the source of VECIANA's speech,

the information appearing in the speech was received from clan-

destine operators located in Cuba, and was transmitted through

a clandestine communications system available to VECIANA and

OPERATION ALPHA 66.

In the opinion of the confidential source,

VECIANA's statements in his speech, although slightly exaggerated

and embellished, are valid. The confidential source is convinced

that OPERATION ALPHA 66 has the resources and capabilities to

carry out the "action" program of warfare on Cuban territory out-

lined in VECIANA's speech.

after his disclosure of his ties with the GUTIERREZ Menoyo group.

Henceforth, the statement added, the group would be known as

"Comandos L-66" to distinguish themselves from VECIANA who

insisted in using the name of ALPHA 66.
