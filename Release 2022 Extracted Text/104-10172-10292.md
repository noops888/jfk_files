soenod that he was on the way to a rocrultuent pitch. Honorar, since that

late he has sased off the derogatory comments about

before 23 July, ho has not ralood then since in his conversations with her.

Golub must rowlize by this tino that sn out and out cold recruttamt pitch to

02(4El5 would be futile. Even though liberal minded, Ass in their discussione

has been oritical of the Sovlet system and has stranuoualy defanded capitalisa.

Golub appesra to be attractod to

This was the caso with hla foruer assistant in tha sovlot

SotiAt. Golub frequently refora to Lyubinor mentioning how nuch he likod

what gape Itlends they dera, und how much he misses hima Goluo's

attraction to E5 started when lyubloor left. So given what we know about

Golub's personality, no do not think it too strange that ho "likos hor for

attempt a recrultuont or some other foru of embarrassment; but wo also bellovo
