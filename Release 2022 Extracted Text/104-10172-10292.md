iA a September 1959

1. Reference dispatch has just been received, and we would like te

bring you up to date on the above relationship:

ia~|

a. Follow up tolHE13}3121 During the evening of 4 September,
Golub did not mention his’ previous proposal to have Subject of DIR
42521 teach Soviet diplomats English, Subject on one occasion
stated that she was planning to teach English on Pinnieh TY and
that it looked as 4f she would have a busy season teaching, Golub
did mot pick this up, and the subject was not returned to, The entire
Svening was quite uneventful, and it was spent talking about must,
(The Subject of AIR 4252) will be dealt with by separate dispatch.)
Since that evening Golub has only phoned Costille once and this was
on a business matter, Two Americans were in the Soviet Consulate at
tlie time and were applying for Soviet vieas thru Golub, They had pre=
viowaly been in the American Consulate inquiring about the possibility
of obtaining a Soviet viea in one or two days, Costille advised then
to go directly to Golub and make their request, which they did, Golub
Phoned Costille to state that he would give them their visas as scon
as they wade advance Intourist reservations. When they did this, Golub
immediately gave than the visas. Golut's and Costill paths crossed
once again on 15 Septenber during a Consular Corpe lunch. This vao a

fairly large gathering and Golub and Costille did not have auch opportunity

to talk, However, Costille gave Golub two tickets to the forthcoming
Leonard Bernstein concert in Helsinki, as Colub had previously mentioned
to Costille how much he wanted to go. Golub appeared to be quite grate-
ful for the tickets, and then otated he wanted Costille and Subject of
DIR 42521 to cone back to his apartment soon to hear some more good
ausic, Mr, Johanan Bein of the Israeli was standing near by, and Golub
extended the invitation to him and wife also. Mo date was ‘set, However,
from 4 September to the present, Golub has not phoned Costille for lunch,
Which is a new. record for hin, as heretofore he has called at least once
a week, He has either been too busy, hie interest is waning ss far as
Costille is concerned, or he io, as Headquarters suggests, planning to
turn Costille over to someone elses

b, Costdle contact with Viktor ZECAL“: If Golub ds planning to
tur Costille over to someone else, Zegal seans to be the most obvious.
Zegal has had. every. opportunity to date to start the contact, but he
has not picked up the ball yet, As we have mentioned previously,
Costille Zegal first at the latter's informal cocktail party. How
ever, the invitation came through Golub. Zegal was friendly to Costille
bat not any more so than to the others at the party. At the second
meeting, a Soviet Eabassy sponsored informal reception for the american
Enbassy, Zegal was again polite to Costille but showed no undue interest.
in him. On 7 September, both Zegal and Costille happened to be at the.
same sauna party given by a mamber of the Netherlands’ Rabassy. During
this party the conversation tumed to music, and Zegal mentioned that

he had a large American record collection but that records in Finland were

too expensive to buy, He asked Costille where he ordered his records and
Af Costille would mind ordering some for him. Costille said he would be
glad to. Legal happened to be at a small luncheon on 10 Septexber given
again by a member of the Netherland's Hmbassy, At this time Costille

loaned Zegal two racord catalogues from which he could make hia selections,

Costille has heard nothing to date froa Zogal on this,

. Goled's possible departure from Helsinki: At the Consular
Corps lunchecn on 15 September, Golub once again mentioned to Costille
that he wuld Like to be assiqed to New York City and even hinted
that be hac been offered the Job as Consul at the Soviet Consulate in
Kew York City. It 12 known that Golub is studying English in Helsinks
from a qualified Russtan-inglish language teacher. He alse mentioned
that if assigned to the United otates, he would be given intensive
Language training in Moscow, Costille aleo asked hin if his ¥ife hed
returned from Kescow as yet, He waved his hand as if in disgust and
stated that it was a pity but she was never coming back, This
“estrarcerect® from his wife has never quite rung true to either Costille

Qor to(Abjs. She'has never liked the climate in Finland and hap been
rather aickly ever ince she has been here. It may be that she is
merely waiting for Golub's return to Moscew rather than move back to
Helsinki, Golub has alo mentioned eo ADS e possibility of his going
to Kew York and has hinted at his being in Hoscow by Decenbere

seseions Golub has not once returned to his conversations of 2

date the pressure seens to be off and that Golub has never raised his
suspicions concerning her knowledge of Costille or the fact that the
American Babassy had become avare of Golub!s contact with (AK/59zGolub'e
conduct v4 S$ has still been above reproach and not one romantic
overture has been mide, Although they still discuss politics, art and
music, Golub satay has made an effort to keep avay fron extrenely con-
troversial topics und hes refrained from making his usual derogatory
comments about capitalien and the.U, S. When the relationship first
began, he did not ian to bring up these ua ‘About three waeks

apartment, Golub for souetime has wanted to meet Iden A, who is the
eon of a famous Finnish gdverment official now li the States,
Iden A is here doing research on his father's effect Emin relic,
The evening wis epent in polite sonvereation, Het drinking and dancing.

2. as far as wontact betarven Costile and (U (tone fe concerned, 1t has been
kept at a minigun since her REDSKIN trip and she reported that she had met
Golub, There are no regularly scheduled meetings, the date and time of the
next meeting being arranged at each previous meeting, Throughout the summer,

polka have been held about one in every three or four. weeks» Th have

on different nights of the week. On these meetings (E/5 comes
clone to Costille's apartment after 2000 hours. She takes a bus from the
University, wich ts in the central part of Helsinki, to Cestille's, which
4s in a northern suburb)2Qz/5 aleo lives in the same suburb about 2 kilometers
from Costille, She, therefore, would take the sane bus to Costille's as
she would to her own apartment but would get off two stops later. After the
meetings, which usually last until about 2,00 hours, Costille drives her to
the bus stop nearest her apartment, Costille has never been to her apartments
At noting has any unusual activity been noted outside of Costille'e apartment
or nei Sta, For emergency contactJ(z/5 has been instructed to phone
Costilie at his apartaent from a public phone booth mentioning that she has
missed him, She never once has. identified herself on the phone. After the
phone call, ske has proceeded to a pre-designated spot in the sane suburban
area where Costille xeets her with his car, They then preceed to the outskirts
of town, Ste is drepred off in thé same suburban area, The meetings have
usually lasted approximately 30 minutes. No surveillance has ever deen de~
tectéd, Tris has ocly been done three or four tines. The sane procedure is
used when Costille wants to sdef5J5 before the next scheduled meeting,
Costille ‘has only phoné B35 tudce, and this was in late May during the

garding (E75. By Golub's actions on 23 July, reported in{OFHA}4032, it
seemed that he was on the way to a recruitment pitch. However, since that
date he has: eased off the. derogatory comments about, Americans completely

and seems to be satisfied in his meetings with UEY5 in discussing art, music

and non-controversial political topics. If he had any suspicions about; Cun

before 23 July, he has not raised them eince in his conversations with hers

lub must realize by this time that sn ornare cold recruitment pitch to

R/5 in their discussions

If he is attenpting to get her involved in a romantic relationship whereby
he could exercise. some amotional control, he has moved very slowly. As we
have stressed before, he has not made one romantic overture to her. If he
did, he would be most definitely rebuffed, We do not want to turn this
into a "Dear Abby" letter, but feel that Golub may be suffering from @
father complex. Golub and his wife have been unable to have children, and
he has mentioned that he would desperately like to. Whenever lie talks about
this he becomes noticeably distressed. Golub appears to be attracted to
younger people. This was the case with his former assistant in the Soviet
Consulate here, Mikhail Lyubimoy, who was a young, intelligent, cultured
Soviet. Golub frequently refers to Lyubimov mentioning how much he liked
him, what go, ‘riends they were, and how much he misses him, Golub's
attraction t 5 etarted when Lyubimov left. So given what we know about
Golub's personslity, we do not think it too strange that he "likes her for
her mind." We admit- that if Golub had the opportunity he would certainly

attempt a recruitaent or sone other’form of enbarrasment; but we also believe

that his feelings are such toward(AEY5 that he would continue seeing (AE/5 >
long after his operational. interest had died dow. We have not. forgotten
the fact that Golub’ is a shrewd intelligence operator. From the outset of
(AE/5—Golub contact, we instructed her to use extreme caution, that Golub
was Kore than a Consul, and that behind thie friendly and gregarious nature,
there was a calculating, diabolical individual, and that she should at all -
costs avoid letting herself be put in the position where she would be sus=
ceptible to any form of blackmail, She was told that above all she should
do nothing to indicate. to Golub any contact, any American official.
Because of this we have refrained from givitg (EJs eny "requirenete" to
elicit from Golub believing thet rsonality data would just come out
naturally, We have never giv: aa any cannéd responses to political
questions that Golub might raise feeling that she was clever and well-read
enough to answer. on her own, We did not want to give Golub any impression
that she was being briefed on what to say and to-aak.

4. In answer to para 3 of roference, Costille has never been vo baste
apartaent and has never met her roomate, Identity B. Identity B was an
exchange student in the United States during the 1957-58 academic year.
Although@{AEY5 did not know the roomate before, the arrangeuents for sharing
the apartment ‘were made befd¥6QEy5 came Bi sista abys in the fali of

consented to go when she heard other Americans were going to be there, She
adaitted that she was curious to meet Goltb alec, There are no Gtatioa/or
HBFINCH traces on Identity By ity

S, We agree with Heacyuccters that we do not have much to be gained
froa the continuation of this contact. Our cossier is pretty well filled
vdth bio data on Golub as it ie, and if te wishes to defect, which we doubt
considerably, he won't need her help. However, we feel that to have (i =
coapletely pull a reversal and stop the contact would only arouse his
suspicions that she may be receiving instructions from some eyteide scurce,
Since Golub now has stopped his original provocative tone and
the Soviet interest in Costille has slowed down, at least for the present,
perhaps it would be better fof [AKY5 to continue seeing Golub, as long as he
does the inviting, until she leaves Helsinki, (Her stipend runs out in
January.) Since school is in fall swing her free time will be linited, and
she ill have more of an excuse to alow down hen contact with Golub.
