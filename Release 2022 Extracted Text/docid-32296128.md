In the meantime,

MILTON later attempted to contact

The following information relating to the revolutionary

activities of JOSEPH MEROLA was developed by the New York

New York.

On September 26, 1958, the ATID informant contacted Special

report that a representative of Cuban

revolutionary. leader JOSE ALEMAN requested the informant to

and had requested the informant to accumulate a large pile

of American

"stuff" for him.

MEROLA also told the informant

at that time that he would have to postpone any purchase of

arms since the Miami area was

swarming

with FBI Agents looking

for stolen weapons.

On August 10, 1959, the ATTD informant was interviewed by

Special Agents of the FBI in New York City. During this

interview, the informant confirmed the foregoing information

Barnes street; New Kensington, Pa., known as Triangle Billiards.

When HAZIDAKIS was in Greece the time before this, JOHN VOLOs,

proprietor of a beer distributorship at the intersection of

Third Avenue and Ninth Street, New Kensington, received

HAZIDAKIS' share of the casino's proceeds and turned it over

to him when he returned

• to the United States. The amount

was in the neighborhood of $5,000. VOZOS is not holding

HAZIDAKIS'

share this time and PG I-2 does not know who is

holding it.

GEORGE HAZIDAKIS, a trusted cashier at the Triangle Billiards

gambling casino in New Kensington, returned to Greece in the

ADMINISTRATIVE

It is noted that it was set out in rerep that PCI JAMES

THORNTON MCCLOWRY, MD, Springaale, Pa., advised that Father

NICOLA, FUSCO, Pastor of Mt. Sto-Peters Roman Catholic

apostulate house when SAMUEL MANNARINO was being sought

for service of a subpoena.

On July 23, 1959, PCI MCCLOWRY advised SA THOMAS G. FORSYTH,

III, as

follows:

on about July 13, 1959, Father FUSCO asked PCI if he would

give SAM MANNARINO a thorough physical examination. PCI

replied that if cancer were indicated, he could do nothing

for MANNARINO, at which point Father FUSCO indicated he knew

that MANNARINO was suffering from a malignancy. PCI feels

there are only two reasons why he should be approached to

examine MANNARINO: either SAM MANNARINO is frightened and

looking desperately for other, contrary medical opinion;

or MANNARINO intends to "use"

PCI by having him subpoenaed

at a later date to testify that MANNARINO is too ill to appear

in any court proceeding. PCI wanted to know if there was any

reason the FBI would not want him to examine SAM MANNARINO,

and PCI was advised that any decision along this line was his

alone.

On September 15, 1959, PCI MCCLOWRY advised that Father

FUSCO and his chauffeur depärted on September 11, 1959, by

jet airline flight to Rome, Italy, purpose of visit unknown.

PCI stated that this trip was paid for in its entirety by

the MANNARINOS. PCI also advised that prior to Father

FUSCO's depature, Father FUSCO told PCI that it would not

be necessary for him to give a physical examination to

SAMUEL MANNARINO, inasmuch as MANNARINO has become more or

less resigned to the inevitability of his death from his

cancer.
