SUBJECT&

CUBAN COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES - MANOLO RAY RIVÉRO

On December 6, 1960 agent A. L. TARABOCHIA was contacted by a very reliable

source who indicated that he had spocial information which be had obtained

dising a recent conversation with MANOLO RAY.

MANOLO RAY RIVERO, one of the most capable enfineers in Cuba, participated

in the construction of the Havana tunnel and the Habana Hilton Hotal.

was very active in the underground during BATISTA'& regime and was named

ninteter of Public works in the Castro Government after the lat of January,

1959.

The informant 1s a Cuban physician of world fame who has been an aotive

conspirator against the last three Cuban dietatores MACHADO, BATISTA and

CASTRO.

Due to bla activities and contacts in the professional world of Cuba, the

Infornant is in a position to give accurate information on most anti-Castro

leaders either in Cuba or in edle.

During the interulew, the doctor stated that he had known RAY for a munber

of years and considered him to be an honest and just person.

An indication

of RAile fairness was the fact that during his tenure of office, he awarded

contracts to persons that, although were considered his professional enemies,

were the best quallfied to carry out the projects assigned to them.

Another indication of RAY's efficiency was the fact that he didn't hesitate,

over strong opposition from Castro, to secure the servicee of United States

effelency axperts based in Puerto Rid0 for the reorganization of the ninistry

of Public Works.

According to RAY, the performance of these experts was such

that they were awarded contracts to reorganize two more ministries.

RAY claims that he never adopted socialist policies and to emphasize thie,

he adds that all of the contracts awarded by his miniatry went to firms owned

and operated by private capital.
