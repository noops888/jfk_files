leaders either in Cuba or in exile.

During the interview, the doctor stated that he had known RAY for e number
of yeore and considered him to be an honest and just person. An indieation
of RAi's feirnesa was the fact thot during his temure of office, he awarded
contracts to persons that, althouch were considered his professional enemies,
were the best qualified to carry out the projects assigned to thems

over strong opposition from Castro, to secure the servicee of United States

of Public Works. According to RAY, the performance of these experte was such
thet they were avarded contracte to reorganize two more ministries.
