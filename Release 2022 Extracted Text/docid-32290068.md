7-18 is a personal friend of DA
owner of Falstaff Distributing & Bottling Compan =
Abbeville, Louisiana. RUSSO is also a friend of CARLOS
MARCELLO. RUSSO said He had to pay MOSS and SANDOZ
$100 a week to operate a wire service to Jefferson Downs,
Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, from Abbeville. RUSSO
operated from the Four Way Club until it burned down
about eighteen months ago. He operated out of another
club for two months after the Four Way was destroyed,
or until MOSS and SANDOZ told him he would have to pay
$200.00 a week. RUSSO refused to pay that amount so
he discontinued the wire service and, since that time,
he nor anyone else in Vermilion Parish has been active
in wire service. T-2 tried to persuade RUSSO to go to
the FBI, but RUSSO claimed he did not want to contact

the FBI.
- for e two known places where prostitution .
y is active are y,'s Lounge, which at one time was Loe
operated by FRANCIS/BEJUENE, and theXBonanza Lounge, =).
