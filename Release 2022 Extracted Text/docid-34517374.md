He observed that VERA ORLOFF'& parents were both

born In Russia and that her parents enjoyed their association with

other Russian people and in spoaking the Russian language.

San Francisco Ial stated, that based upon various conver-

sations which he had with VERA ORLOfF's father, he had concluded

that hor father vas pro-Comnuniet. He was unable to recall the

exact statements of JOHN ORLOFF, but advised that JOHN ORLOFF was

continually upholding Connunism and the Sovlet form of government.

He advised that he had never seon a Communist Party membership

card in the possession of JOHN ORLOFF.

One of the principal reasons for ViRA ORLOFF's divorce

from FREDERICK WILLIAM ONICK, according to San Francisco T-i,

was the great influence over her by her parents. He explained

that VERA ORLOPP was married to ONICK for five or six months,

that ONICK was a veteran of World war II; that ONICK continued

his National Servico Life Insurance with ONICK's parents listed

as beneffolarles.

ONICK had planned to have his benefibiaries

changed, but VERA ONICK's father made an lssue over the matter

and had given ONICK a definito period of time in which to change

the beneficiarles.

San Francisco To advised that ONICK resented

this attitude by his father-In-law and refused to change the bene-

ficiaries at that time.

JOHN ORLOFF thereupon Instruoted VERA

ONICK to leave ONICK, which she did, and she shortly thereafter

instituted proceedings for divorce.

San Francisco T-4 advised

that there were probably other differences between ViilA ONICK and

her husband which might have caused them to separate but he expressed

the feeling that if VERA ONICK had defied her father on that matter,

there would have been no divorce.
