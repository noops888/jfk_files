she was born March 24, 1923 at San Francisco, California. She
attended the Tamalpais Union High School, Mill Valley, California
from 1938 to 191 and the California Secretarial School, San Fran-
cisco, from September 1941 to June 192. She was employed at the
U, S. Food and Drug Administration at San Francisco in July 192,
where she worked until September 19,3 when she transferred to the
District Supply Office, U. S. Navy, Twelfth Naval District, San
Francisco. She worked at this job until May 19h7 and she was
unemployed from May 1947 until November 1948 when she received
the afore-mentioned appointment as clerk-stenographer at the San
Francisco Port of iimbarcation. She advised she was divorced from
FRED WILLIAM ONICK, San Francisco, California, who was born

July 4, 1921.

The Department of the Army advised in 199 that VERA
ONTCK was represented at a Loyalty Hearing by the law firm of
RICHARD SLADSTETN, HiROLD ANDERSON, HERBERT RESNER and HAROLD
SAWY Re

San Francisco T-2, who has provided reliable information
in the past, advised in 1949 that the law firm of GLADSTEIN,
AND!RSN, RESNER and SAWYER was composed of members who were either
Communists or Communist sympathizers. This source advised that
the firm had for years represented Commmist Party officials on
legal matters, both of a criminal and civil nature.

San Francisco T-3, who has provided reliable information
in the past, advised in 1949 that VERA ORLOFF was known to him in
19h as a member of the Russian American Society (RAS), San Fran
cisco, an organization designated by the Attorney General of the
United States pursuant to Executive Order 10450.

on the part of VSRA ORLOFF during portions of the 19l,0's advised

sponsored by the RAS and other Russian groups in San Francisco.

tives of the Soviet Consulate in San Francisco prhor to tke closing
of the Consulate in the Fall of 1918.

San Francisco T- advised that he did not believe that
VERA ORLOFF was a member of the Communist Party (CP) or particularly
sympathetic to Communism or that she was particularly interested in
any form of government. He observed that he believed that she
associated with Russian groups because of her parents' association
with these organizations and that they had developed friends among
the Russian people in the San Francisco area mAimly because of their
common background. He observed that VERA ORLOFF's parents were both
born in Russia and that her parents enjoyed their association with
other Russian people and in speaking the Russian language.

San Francisco Ta4 stated, that based upon various conver-
sations which he had with VERA ORLOFF's father, he had concluded
that her father was pro-Communist. He was unable to recall the
exact statements of JOHN ORLOFF, but advised that JOHN ORLOFF was
continually upholding Communism and the Soviet form of government.
He advised that he had never seen a Communist Party membership
card in the possession of JOHN ORLOFF.

One of the principal reasons for ViRA ORLOFF's divorce
from FREDERICK WILLIAM ONICK, according to San Francisco T-l;,
was the great influence over her by her parents. He explained
that VERA ORLOFF was married to ONICK for five or six months;
that ONICK was a veteran of World War II; that ONICK continued
his National Service Life Insurance with ONICK's parents listed
as beneficiaries. ONICK had planned to have his benefi¢iaries
changed, but VERA ONICK's father made an issue over the matter
and had given ONICK a definite period of time in which to change
the beneficiaries. San Francisco Tel advised that ONICK resented
this attitude by his father-in-law and refused to change the bene-
ficiaries at that time. JOHN ORLOFF thereupon instructed VERA
ONICK to leave ONICK, which she did, and she shortly thereafter
instituted proceedings for divorce, San Francisco Tel advised
that there were probably other differences between ViiiA ONTCK and
her husband which might have caused them to separate but he expressed
the feeling that if VERA ONICK had defied her father on that matter,
there would have been no divorce,

San Francisco Teh advised that VERA ONICK had been
instructed to obey her parents without question and that she had \
never questioned the instructions of her father. This source
expressed the opinion that if her father requested her to obtain
confidential data from the United States Covernment, she would
probably act upon his instructions.

He advised that VERA ONICK separated from FREDERICK \

WILLIAM ONICK in May 1947 and filed for divorce in August of

that year. He advised that the ONICKg had a daughter, born
December , 1947. San Franeisco Td; declined to fulnish a signed
statement or appear before a Loyalty Hearing Board.

The 1948-49 San Francisco City Directory reflects that
Mrs. VERA ONICK, stenographer, resided at 3667 - 18th Avenue, San
Francisco. The 1942,,1943, 19h, 1915, 1946, 1951, 1953, and
1954 directories contain no record of VERA ONICK or VERA ORLOFF.

RS: JOHN ORLOFF

San Francisco T-3 has advised that JOHN ORLOFF, VERA ri} -

ORLOFF's f&&ther, has been active in the Russiah American Society,

San Francisco, from October 11, 1943 until December 11, 1953 and

that ORLOFF served in various official capacities during his par-
ticipation in Russian American Society activity.

San Francisco T-3 advised that in July 197, a meeting
of the Communist Party faction within the Russian American Society
had been held in San ! -ancisco and that it was recommended that
JOHN ORLOFF be recruited into the Communist Party. All Party
members present at the meeting, with one or two exceptions, had
concurred in this recommendation, 5F T-3 advised that ORLOFF
subsequently declined the invitation to join the Party, stating
that he performed the work anyway and that he did not have tim
to attend meetings and participate in other direct Party activity.

San Francisco T-5, who has provided reliable information
in the past, advised in 1948 that JOHN ORLOFF was elected president
o. the All Slav Council, San Francisco, California, cn January 28,
1948. ORLOFF was elected as a delegate to the Fourth All Slav
Congress to be held in Chicago, Illinois on September 2-26, 1918.

W. C. STOREK, 610 Funston Avenue, San Francisco, advised
4n 199 he had been president of the All Slav Council of Northern
California from 1942 until 1946 and that the group was formed in
192 and functioned during World War II as a fund-raising group.

STOREK advised that ORLOFF was treasurer of the council
during the period that he, STOREK, was president.

STOREK advised that following the termination of the war
the All Slav Council became affiliated with the American Slav Congress
of New York City and that he and other members who were not Communists
or Communist sympathizers, withdrew from the council inasmuch as the
officers were then either Communist Party members or Communist sym-
pathizers. The All Slav Congress has been designated by the Attorney
General of the United States pursuant to Executive Order 10150.

San Francisco T-3 advised in July 1955 that JOHN ORLOFF
and his wife, ALICE, were present at an Executive Board meeting of
the Russian American Society held July 8, 1955 at 321 Divisadero
Street, San Francisco. This source advised on February 1, 1955
