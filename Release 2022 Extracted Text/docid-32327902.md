tion indicated SANDOMINGO was SCALIA's mistress, and, although

during an

argument. HAV-32 informed that considerable political intluence

had been exerted to obtain SCALIA's immediate release and that

he was set free under $25,000 bond. Source said that SCALIA

was placed under the protection of Lt. Colonel IRENALDO GARCIA

XBAEZ, the Head of the Cuban Army Military Intelligence Service CAfyi

MINGO MACHADO and that she claimed to have shot herself. Source

said that the superintendent in charge of the apartment building

where SANDOMINGO had been shot had been threatened by representa-

tives of GARCIA BAEZ to "keep his mouth shut."

for the Cuban newspaper "El Crisol", had written an article inti-

mating that SCALIA was linked with the Mafia.

reason he had managed to clandestinely obtain the revolver and

had arranged to have two test shots fired from the weapon.
