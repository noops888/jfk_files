previously mentioned, advised that SCALIA had been associated
with SALVATORBYGRANELLO and GEORGE LEVINE several years ago
when they operated a cigar concession in the Hotel Sevilla

f Biltmore in Havana. (,

had been arrested on November 14, 1958, in connection with the
shooting of a Cuban girl named MARTA SANDOMINGO MACHADO at Calle
16 No. 2, Apartment 501, Vedado. HAV-32: stated that investiga-
tion indicated SANDOMINGO was SCALIA's mistress, and, although
SCALIA denied it, it appeared that she had been shot during an
argument, HAV-32 informed that considerable political influence
had been exerted to obtain SCALIA's immediate release and that
he was set free under $25,000 bond. Source said that SCALIA

_was placed under the protection of Lt. Colonel IRENALDO GARCIA .. 4
_SBAEZ, the Head of the Cuban Army Military Intelligencé’ Sérvice Cw
‘and son of Chief of Police PILAR GARCIA GARCIA, Hav-32/ informed

that representatives ‘of GARCIA BAEZ had “gotten to" MARTA SANDO-

MINGO MACHADO and that she claimed to have shot herself. Source

said that the superintendent in charge of the apartment building
where SANDOMINGO had been shot had been threatened by representa-
tives of GARCIA BAEZ to "keep his mouth shut." Source stated
further that a Cuban writer named PAUBIA, who is a police reporter
for the Cuban newspaper "El Crisol", had written an article inti-
mating that SCALIA was linked with the Mafia. Source stated that

PAUBIA ‘had been threatened with death if he did not "forget about

the Mafia and keep his mouth shut."* Hav-32 informed further that

a police officer named OSVA ARANGO had investigated the matter (é

initially. Source said that ARANGO had been informed he would —_—

be promoted to Corporal if he "white washed" SCALIA and that h

would be fired if he furnished a true report on the case. (Y ) ua)

short barrel Smith & Wesson. Source said that this weapon bore
the number 104912 at the base of the grip and the number 32276
on the inside of the frame and on the cylinder. Source noted
that, while the revolver was temporarily in the hands of Cuban
judicial authorities, there was no doubt that it would mysteriously
disappear in the immediate future. Source noted that for that
reason he had managed to clandestinely obtain the revolver and
had arranged to have two test shots fired from the weapon.

Source noted that, while these two test shots could not serve
for evidentiary purposes, they would be available for comparison
purposes in the event the possibility existed that a similar -.
