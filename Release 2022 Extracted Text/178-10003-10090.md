iL. Sabotage Operation

General Carter reported that information should be available by
.Sunday as to the success of this previously-approved operation. Mr.
. Bundy requested that the White House be informed as soon as the

dnformation is obtained.

2. General Lansdale commented in general on his paper of August 31st.

He-noted that some of the.oparetional..representatives had “questioned

- whether this was responsive to the changed situation ehgen ered by the
dissuance of NSAM 181, but said that ‘this plan had been ‘prepared within
tthe framework of the preyiously-approved guidelines (those of August 16).
Mr, Bundy noted that most of the paperwork in response to. NSAM 181 has

been done and the President's statement of Tuesday night had clarified
the situation to a considerable degree. He thus felt that‘the approach

taken in the August 3lst paper was satisfactory.

‘3. The following specific comments were then made on Activities
. Wsted in the paper: (It should be noted that final approval was not
given to the paper at this meeting.)
a. Mr. Martin said that number 20 (balloons) was tricky and that.
the thought a very careful look should be taken when a specific proposal

is prepared, After considerable discussion, iti was agreed that
detaiis should be presented to the Group, to include the content of
the leaflets which would be dropped, and specifics as to the method
and place of launching, the technical details of the release of
“teaflets, etc., etc.

b. Mr. Martin felt that number 25 ("discovery" of caches of

. arms) involves an important aspect of timing. He said, and the Group
agreed, that any such action should be coordinated with U.S. objectives
teward Cuba rather than confusing it with activities in connection with
a third country. Mr. Bundy emphasized that any such undertaking should
be done with: the-idea of providing a-pretext--for further ‘action.

- ¢. In answer to the Chairman's question, Mr. Murrow, supported
by State, said that Radio Swan (number 23) should be continued even
though it is not entixely effective. This ied into a discussion of

“the possibilities of intrusion into radio and TV channels in Cuba. Mr.
Murrow explained the far-reaching reactions that the Cubans could mount
against U,S. radio stations, and said that he felt on balance it would
not be profitable to provoke this kind of electronic warfare. The Group

- asked, however, that a detailed paper on the pros and cons of such
intrusions, to include the legal aspects involved, he prepared, ,

d. At General Carter's suggestion, number 21 (propaganda directed
at Bloc persone] in Cuba) was assigned to USIA and CIA, rather than
just te the latter. :

e. On number 28 (sabotage of assets outside of Cuba), the purpose
was changed from crippling to harrassing Cuban commerce.

General Carter pointed out that reference to support of all

Cuban exile groups (number 48) is ctmpractical. ‘The ward was changed

be undertaken by cother ‘Hemisphere governments) would mot ‘be expected

Ff Mr. Bundy said that he had no worries about

any such sabotage which could clearly be made to appear as the result

of local Cuban disaffection or of a natural disaster, but that we must

avoid external activities such as |, unless

they could be completely covered up.

5. A suggestion was made that small explosives or incendiaries which

could be distributed to Cubans should be infiltrated. General Carter

explained that the problem is not one of such supplies, since they can
be easily improvised, but rather that the people have shown no inclinatior

to use guch.materials despite many exile claims to the contrary.
\

6. It was-suggested.that.the matter .of.attacking and harrassing of

Soviet personnel within Cuba should be considered.

7. The Attorney General and Mr. Bundy said that no reprisals against

exiles who undertake active operations on their own are contemplated.

8. It was suggested that the possibilities of counterfeiting be looked

inte further.

9. General Carter urged again that a deciston be reached as to how
much latitude would be allowed the operating elements of the government,
within broad policy lines. The Chairman indicated that it would not be
a simple matter to delegate responsibilities of this kind to any great

degree. °

10. Mr. Bundy then raised the basic question of the entire spectrum

of other contingencies beyond those envisaged in the MONGOOSE program.

He mentioned as examples what the’ U.S. response should be in the event
of a revolt and whether or not a naval blockade should be mounted,

Do plans already prepared, niust be pursued.
Although recognizing that this type of activity is not within the
; MONGOOSE framework, Mr. Bundy Se General Lansdale's group,
_ particularly the State representative, mee te the initial exploration
of possibilities for later consideration by the Special Group, the
_ Secretary of State and higher authority. On the other hand, General
Carter felt strongly that if General Lansdale and his associates
: were given the responsibility for developing the spectrum of possible
decisiongof this kind, it would inevitably detract from the time

available for MONGOOSE operations. Thie matter was left open for further

-consideration at a meeting next week. . .
