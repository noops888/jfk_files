CLASSIFIED MESSAGE

THAT WOULD LIKE TO DEPEND ON JAPANESE FIRM IN SECURING THE RELEASE

RATHER THAN ON FOREIGN WIRE SERVICE OR ON QKFLOWAGE. IF WE CAN

COME THROUGH IT WILL GREATLY ENHANCE POVARSITY FIRM'S REPUTATION.

Bo PUBLICATION OF RELEASE IN CHUO KORON WHILE 'IT'S "STILL

HOT" WILL GO FAR TOWARD ERASING MISIMPRESSIONS CREATED BY RECENT

SPATE OF. "WHODUNIT" TYPE MAGAZINE ARTICLES AND BOOK MANUSCRIPT

DEALING WITH KENNEDY ASSASSINATION. WIRE SERVICE SUMMARIES WILL

GET COVERAGE IN NEWSPAPERS, BUT WE HAVE CHANCE TO GET THE ENTIRE

RELEASE INTO PRINT, IN A VEKICLE THAT WILL REACH MOST OF JAPAN'S

INTELLIGENSIA. FYI, CHUO KORON IS PREPARED TO PUT ON SPECIAL

ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN TO ANNOUNCE THEIR PRINTING OF RELEASE.
