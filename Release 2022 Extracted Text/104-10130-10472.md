MEMORANDUM POR RECORD

SUBJECT: The Wackenhut Corporation
3280 Ponce de Leon Boulevard
Coral Gables, Florida

i. Mr. Bannerman, Security Office, arranged through Chief,

CCS for the writer to meet Mr. Geor; zWackenhut, President of
subject, to explore its potential for cover| support. At 10:30
a.m., on 14 March 1963, Mr. Wackenhut, Mr. Wes Reynolds, and I
met at Mr. Reynold's home, 3809 37th Street, North, Arlington. -
~My. Reynolds epparently represents Wackenhut in the Washington
area, although I did not gather that the firm is. actually
operating here at present. Mr. Wackenhut and Mr. Reynolds, both,
are ex-FBI agents.

2. Wackenhut started his firm in 1954. In 1961 it was
reported to have 1100 employees and anticipated 1961 sales in
excess of $5 million. At present it has offices in Miami,

Coral Gables, Tampa, Jacksonville, Philadelphia, New York City,
Boston, Buffalo, Denver, Los Angeles, San Jose (Calif.), Honolulu,
Sen Juan and Ponce, Puerto Rico. Wackenhut freely states that

he trades on the reputation of the FBI by publicizing widely the
21 ex-FEI agents, including two former Assistant Directors of the
FBI, in his management.

3- The Operating Divisions of the company end their services
are described in ea Wackenhut brochure as follows:

Investigative Division
Performs all types of investigations for attorneys, insurance

companies, benks and other businesses; sets up internal audit
systems to prevent embezzlements, and investigates personal back-
grounds of prospective executives, business partners and associates.

Scientific Services Division

Conducts pre and post-employment, pre-promotional and speci-
fic lie detector examinations for business and industry; speciel-
izes in technical security and investigetive techniques, scientific
detection devices, and electronic and mechanical security methods
and equipment, and performs electronic "sweeps" to counter business
espionage through the detection of electronic intrusion ettemts.


Internal Intelligence Division
Specializes in exposing and controlling inside thefts that may

range from employee pilferage, through embezzlement of thousands of
dollars, to highly valuable industrial secrets.

Central Clearing Division
Assists personnel and security directors to screen quickly

the backgrounds of present and potential employees through the
messive files of The Wackenhut ‘Yorporation.

Retail Store Protection Division

Increases net profite by reducing inventory shortages through
the control of internel end external losses with security programs
designed to meet the client's specific needs.

Treining Services Division -

Provides specialized training programs for security, fire
fighting, investigative and other personnel of business orgenize-
tions and professional groups.

Industrial Security Division

Provides the essential security services that are required by
all companies seeking or handling government classified contracts;
assists management in @isaster and emergency planning.

end Safety Division

Supplies ambulance services, first aid crews, Waekenhut fire-
men fully trained in the technical field of industrial and mmi-
cipal fire fighting end equipment, and safety surveys, systems,
and educational programs.

~ Guard Forces Division
Selects, investigates, trains and supervises the uniformed
and pleineclothes guards who protect your operations; also provides
uniformed receptionists and guardettes; makes physical property
surveys to determine security requirements and.establishes security
systems and controls.

4. Me. Wackenhut wants to expand abroad, in view of his
successful venture into Puerto Rico. However, he has no definite
Plens as of the present and seemed to be seeking from CIA covert 2
sponsorship] for entry into areas of interest to us. He is pre-

ared to ersonnel himself iM

5- It is not apparent to me that there is any significant
market for Wackenhut's services 1n foreign countries, except
possibly among American businesses with physical Plants overseas.
The nature of these services, I would presume, would make rather .
difficult acquisition of the necessary occupational permits in
many countries. The potential for clandestine intelligence acti
vities would be too Spvious to host governments, and the emphasés


on former FBI personnel probably would enhance such suspicions,
particulerly in Latin Ancrica where "FBI" means "intelligence"
since its WW II activities there.

6. CC8/NC on occasion receives requests for advice to busi=+
ness orgenizations as to setting up security systems at overseas
installations. We recently referred a request of this type,
involving e« major oil company, to the Physical Security element of
the Security Office. Conceivably, the Agency might make some
errangement to advise Wackenhut of such requests, providing pur own
Security Office is satisfied as to Wackenhut's competi aN
could then if desired,

6 compeny succes

secure the contract.

T- ‘Wackenhut seid he would be willing to dispatch teams to
set up personal security systems for foreign chiefs of state
whom the Agency wants protected. He {s amenable, in fact, to any
reasonable application of his capabilities to Agency problems.

He would be willing to negotiate financing in equitable propor~
tions in the event an overt operation, set up at Agency behest,
were not financially self-susteining.

8. Wackenhut impressed me as a clean-cut, energetic, ambitious
young business man who 1s obviously proud of what & to be
@ superior organization of its type. He is intere: profits,
but it is my impression he is sincerely eager to do what he can to
essist the government and feels that CIA offers one possible oppor=
-tunity. Incidentally, he appears somewhat younger in person than __
in the pictures appearing in the promotional material given the
writer.

9. Copies of this memorandum are being furnished those Agency
components vhich might have an interest in utilizing subject com-
pany. Inquirles may be directed to the vriter.
