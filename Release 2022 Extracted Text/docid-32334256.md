Enclosed herewith are four copies of an FD-302

reflecting an interview with Mrs. DELORES SAVOIE, Biloxi,

Miss., on 4/4/67• DELORES SAVOIE is a PCI of the Jackson

fully to her information in this case, together with the fact

that she intends to leave the Mississippi Gulf Coast area and

"get out of the rackets" upon completion of this case.

The information furnished by SAVOIE is extremely

pertinent to this case, and it substantially corroborates

testimony of other witnesses, establishing this conspiracy

and "nailing down" the participation of subject RAYMOND

was relatively weak.

had

check cashing operation.

MrS. SAVOIE advised that

JACKSON,

a resident of Florida.

and GLEN

OWENS, an Atlanta, Georgia, resident, both friends of

JIMMY JAMES, hung around

Red Carpet Club, as did STANLEY

WOODALL. JACKSON was a heavy drinker and had nothing to do with

operation of the club, apparently hanging around because of his

association with JIMMY JAMES.

The same was generally true of

GLENN OWENS.

STANLEY WOODALL waS employed by HArRy BEnveTrat

the Red Carpet Club, but WoODALl was drinking usually and did

little work.

In about March, 1965, exact date not recalled, BUDDY

ROLLING told

MES.' SAVOIE

that he was going to Jefferson Parish,

Louisiana,

and that he would be back in a day or so with some

"hot stuff"

and told her to

pray that he did not get caught.

She assumed ROLLING meant that he was going to bring back some

slot machines from Louisiana, and

she asked him if this was so.

ROLLING told her it was something heavier than slot machines.

She was not aware of any part WOODALL may have played in

obtaining and using the device at the dice table.

Mrs. SAVOIE stated that to the best of her recollection,

JIMMY JAMES' white Cadillac was parked in back of the Red Carpet

Club hooked up to some kind of U Haul trailer.

Mrs. SAVOIE stated she did not stay in the back room and

observe the work there as HARRY BENNETT closed the connecting

doors between this room and the front room, where Mrs. SAVOIE

worked dusting off concrete dust from the fixtures. At about

7:00 p.m., the usual time of opening

for the nightly business,

BENNETT opened the doors; and Mrs.. SAVOIE observed that the

red carpet had been pulled back over the concrete

floor, and the

dice table was in its usual place.

puring the course of the

evening, while working in the vicinity of the dice table, she

could feel small pieces of concrete under the carpet; and she

told BENNETT about this.

On succeeding

days thereafter, she observed that BUDdY

ROLLING worked the dice table, in the course of which he had in

his hand and pocket a small device which appeared similar

to a

small transistor

radio.

He always had this device in his pocket

while customers were at the table. Mrs. SAVOIE stated that

although she was

never specifically told, from her observations

she knew that there was

"juice joint" in operation underneath

the dice table by remote control. She stated she is

acquainted

with the manner in which these devices operate,

as one was in

the Cay Paree Lounge at Biloxi, Mississippi, when she worked

there.

Mrs. SAVOIE advised that this operation continued

with BUDDY ROLLING operating the device until the Red Carpet

Club was padlocked in June or Julys 1965. She was present when

when the "juice joint" was dug out of the floor at the Red

Carpet Club and moved across the street to DEWEY D'ANGELO'S

place Deano's lounge. She stated that this move was accomplished

by JIMMY JAMES, DEWEY D'ANGELO; JACK KRESS, BUDDY ROLLING,

MAURICE ARNOLD, HARRY BENNETT ERIC ROSINNETTE, and PAUL BROWN;

and it was done in one night.

MES. SAVOIE waS

never thereafter

employed at Deano's Lounge and stated she thus was not aware of

the nature of the operation at Deand's Lounge, although she

assumed that BUDDY ROLLING continued to use the "juice joint"

until it reportedly broke down.

Mrs. SAVOIE advised that she personally is aware that

JIMMY JAMES Is an Oldotime acquaintance of JACK KRESS, and from

seeing them together at the Red Carpet Club, she is certain

that JAMES is responsible for obtaining the

"juice joint" from

KRESS and bringing it to Mississippi.

She

stated that she never

actually saw the component parts of this "juice joint" until it

was dug out of the floor for transfer from the Red Carpet Club

to Deano's Lounge.

she could not say positively how it came

to Mississippi, but she belleves JAMES brought it. She recalled

that on one occasion after the "juice joint" was dug up and

that if any law ever asked her about the

should say that JACK JACKSON brought it to Mississippi. JAMES

explained that JACK JACKSON was dead, having been killed in an

automobile accident in Florida.

Mrs. SAVOIE

advised

she is

acquainted with IVAN

ORRELS, known to her also as

"Lanky" Orrels, whom

she knows as

an associate of JIMMY JAMES.

She stated she knew of no con-

nection OrrELs might have with the "juice joint" at the red

Carpet Club and Deano's Lounge, but she recalled having seen

ORRELS from time to time at the Red Carpet Club, as well as at

the Gay Paree Lounge at Bilori,

Mississippi

She specifically

could not recall having seen ORRELS at the Red Carpet Club in

March, 1965, at the time the "juice joint" was

being installed

there.

Mes. SAVOIE advised that about a month before the

"juice joint" was installed in the red Carpet Club, this being

about the latter part of January or early February, 1965, she

was present at the Red Carpet Club when JIMMY JAMES came

with

JACK KRESS and KRESS"

engineer BILL. She observed JAMES

introduce KRESS and BILL tO HARRY BENNETT and definitely got

the impression that HARRY BENNETT had not met KRESS prior to

this time.

Mes. SAVOIE stated

that

after the "juice joint" was

installed and was in use at

the Red Carpet Club, on one occasion

HARRY BENNETT told her that the

juice joint" cost him a hell of

a lot of money® i

¿Also, shortly alter the "juice joint"

was

installed,

she was at Cus Stevens Restaurant, Biloxl,

Mississippi,

having coffee with JIMMY JAMES and CLENN OWENS. JAMES expressed

concern that BUDDY ROLLING las not qualified to run the "juice

joint," and he feared that

ROTtING would "mess things up.

Mrs. SAVOIE stated that she would have no hesitation

whatever to testifying completely and truthfully to all infor

mation she has concerning this matter, although she would prefer

that her name not be made know outside the Federal Bureau of

Investigation or U.S. Department of Justice pending her

testimony at the trial.
