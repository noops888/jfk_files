personally give his blessing to the Frente he said, with a
straight face, that he gave his blessing to any group of
Mexicans which lawfully wished to organize in Mexico
for this was a democracy. He added, however, that he

: + feared that the Frente was. getting ready to put up 2

: candidate for President and that Anericans, including the
Ambassador, could be embarrassed if they found them-
selves involved in this matter.

“ec. Concerning the question of the Colombian proposal
which the Ambassador asked him to consider, [LIFENSOR\°1

- * + gaid we are late in making this suggestion to him. He

asked, however, that I advise the Ambassador that he would
do what he could to have the Ambassador's suggestions

taken into consideration, He ‘said he would get.in touch-with
Manuel Tello today prior to his departure from Mexico City.

I told him; as ie recorded in memorandum, that the
Ambassador understood. the historical reasons for Mexico's
pésition and also understood that the request was late.

Ly ;ENSOA] then raised the question of President Kennedy's
visit which’ he said Senator Mansfield had raised. [He said

: that he would prefer President Kennedy came in December of

: this year, 4s he had advised Senator Mansfield, and that his
personal preference was for a meeting in Monterrey. | He
‘aid, however, that the place of meeting would be lefe entirely
to President Kennedy to choose, and that security of President
Kennedy and his party could be guaranteed any place in Mexico.
His personal preference for Monterrey is because he thought
it lese likely that a small group or an individual might attempt
to cause embarrassment to President Kennedy and his group,
and that auch efforts could be best controlled outside Mexico
City proper. He brought up the question of President Kennedy's
health and the probable affect of the altitude in Mexico City;
but I told him that I thought President Kennedy's troubles had
been due to his back and not to his heart, and that the altitude
should not affect him.
