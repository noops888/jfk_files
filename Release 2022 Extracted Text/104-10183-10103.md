SUBJECT:

Visit with LIFENSOR]

1. On 21 November 1961 I met with LIFENSORjat 1100 hour s

and took up three topics which I had been requested to discuss

with him by Ambassador Mana.

2. The results briefly were:

a. Concerning the agrarian question, LITENSOR said

that he would prefer to discuas this matter personally with

Ambassador Mann prior to Ambassador Mann's having any.

discussions with fits Mialsterd He sugzested that

Ambassador Mann and he mect "next week" as soon as

póssible after be returas from a visit to/Chihuahua to

dedicate a railroad. He asked that this meeting be a

secret one and be arranged through me and that the Foreign

Office nat. be.made-aware.of Ambassador Mann's call on him, 08

b. Concerning the Freate Civico Mexicano, LITENSOR

said that he would prefer that U.S. businessmen not give

money to this or any other anti-Communist group in Mexico.

In particular, he said te feared that this group would get

involved in internal political affairs in Mexico and he thought

internal politics was the business of Mexicans and that

Americans should not get themselves involved. He suggeated

that Ambassador Mann tell U.S. buginessmen who wish to

maxe a contribution to the Frente that they could better help

Mexico by investing in private enterprises in Mexico which

would help to raise the standard of living in Mexico and thereby

would fight Communism. When I told him that I would

personally give his blessing to the Frente he said, with a

straight face, that he gave his blessing to any group of

Mexicans which lawfully wished to organize in Mexico

for this was a democracy. He added, howeves, that he

feared that the Frente was getting ready to put up a

candidate for President and that Apericans, including the

Ambassador, could be embarrassed if they found chem-

selves involved in this matter.

Concerning the question of the Colombian proposa

which the Ambassador asked him to consider, LITENSOR JOI

said we are late in making this suggestion to him. He

asked, however. that I advise the Ambassador that he would

do what he could to have the Ambassador's suggestions

taken into consideration. He said he would get in louch with

Manuel Tello today prior to his departure from Mexico City.

I told him. as is recorded in memorandum, that the

Ambassador understood. the historical reasons for Mexico's

position and also understood that the request was late.

ol

LITENSOR then raised the question of President Kennedy's

visit whick he said Senator Mansfield had raised. He said

that he would prefer President Kennedy came in December of 08

this year, as he had advised Senator Mansfield, and that his

versonal preference was for a meeting in Monterrey. l H

ald, however, that the ulace of meeting would be left entirel

to President Kennedy to choose, and that security of President

Kennedy and his party could be guaranteed any place in Mexico.

His personal preference for Monterrey is because he thought

it less likely that a small group or an individual might attempt

to cause embarrassment to President Kennedy and his group.

and that such efforts could be best controlled outside Mexico

City proper. He brought up the question of President Kennedy's

healtà and the probabie affect of the altitude in Mexico City:

but I told him that I thought President Kennedy's troubles had

been due to his back and not to his heart, and that the altitude

should not affect him.

3. For details of the subjects as listed by me, see separate

memorandum for the files on each.
