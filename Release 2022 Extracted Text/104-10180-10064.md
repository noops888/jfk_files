DISPATCH



MEMORANDUM FOR THR RECORD
SUBJECT: IDEN A

«1. IDEN A telephoned IDEN B on 15 June 1966
who asked him to come to Madrid as soon as possible
go that he could be back in San Juan before the 25th
of June. The, implication wes that IDEN A should be
back in Sap Juan in time to talk to @ PBRUMEN who
was with the PBRUHEN delegation to the Tenth Central
American and Caribbean Games. (ICEN C, was @
delegate to the Games).

2. IDEN A and IDEN PB developed a plan that
involved two action agents already inside PBRUMEK.
One was to assassinate AKTIUG either by rifle fire
or reaocte controlled radio activated explosives
while the other agent was to establish a nilitary base
in the ‘central part of PBRUMEN Station Madrid) | (9-2
spoke with IDEN A who reported he believed" iG
would topple within the next few months and tha
te already had a group inside PERUMEN.

3. IDEN A was interviewed upon bis return
to San Juan where he reported that be did not have
any firm evidence that ANTIUG would topple within

‘the next few months but only that he intuitively believed

that AMTHUG'’s downfall was inainent. Se based this
op reports that things were getting worse in PPRUMEN
and that the people were ready to revolt. He also
based 1t on the fact that he now bas two action agents
‘of the same caliber as AMLASH inside PBRUMEN who are
ready to do nis bidding.

4. TDEN A's ents’ inside PRRUMEN are probably
IDEN C, who might cooperate with ID"X B but not ne

arily



with IDEN A. Further th 3 no firm evidence thadS
IDEN C is against the p: nt regine in PBRUMEN. IDEN D
fs another possible contact. Again, other than sono
unsupported allegations there is no independent

firm evidence that IDEN D is anti-regise.

5. IDFN A also claimed in Madrid that
IDEN E bad dent hin @ message acd that be vas considered
@ potential ally. He explained this in San Juan 7
by yang that during a prese conference his nane
had been mentioned and that IDEN E replied that he -
considered 2BEX A to be his friend. IDEN A rationalized
“that 1f IDEN B had not wanted to indicate in sone way
that he was ‘with’ ID®N A he would have taken this
opportunity to blast his.

6. I debriefed IDEN A on bis Madrid trip and
intentions generally detore I introduced him to
AMEADGER/1. I had first asked .in if he would mind
reporting to us via & trusted PERUMEN exile now living
in San Juan and, after I bad icentified AMBADGER/1, he
replied that he knew him and respected d liked hia,
Tne three of. us had a mecting ard it was agreed that
IDEN A would keep AMBADGER/1 ccapletely informed of
hig plans and that AKBADGER/i vould couvey them to
me in PBPRIME. IDEN A refused to reveal the
identities of his agents inside PDRUHEN deapite strong
pressure. He algo stated that IDEN F and IDEN G would
fe to know about his arrangewent with AMDADGER/1
and with KUBARK. IDEN F and IDEN G, together with
IDEN A, are the triumvirate of the JURE.
