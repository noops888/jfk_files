ubject is a commercial representative from Yugoslavia.
InfornaTion was received from CIA that an individual with the same
last name was a member of Yugoslav Intelligence Service (YIS).
However, another source of CIA advised subject was not a member of
YIS, CIA has learned that an individual believed to be the subject
is being recalled to Yugoslavia, but this individual wishes to
remain in the U. 8.

IA desires verification of t nform: rn
because if it is true,

fosubject is supposed to return to Yugoslavia at end of
April, 1963. Approach to subject by FBI is not recommended because
New York informants said in March, 1963, subject is net engaged in

intelligence activities and because State recently denied clearance
for approach in similar case.
