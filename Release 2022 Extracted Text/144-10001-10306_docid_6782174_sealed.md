Priotity

Msg Nr: 856

I have the honor to inform you of the following::

I learned from an unofficial source that Premier CHOU EN

LAI will leave Peking on 13 or 14 December for an official visit

in Egypt whence he will visit other African countries; among

them Guinea, Ghana, Mali. [SG] not have confirmation of this

information

despite several demarches, to Chinese Protocol.

This discretion seems due to the fact that the Chinese Govern-

ment is (B val using) every means t√≥ avoid a reoccurrence of

the assassination attempt to which' President LIOU CHAO CHI was

subject when he visited Cambodia:

I continue my investigations. .I will keep you informed

as soon as possible.

As I finish this telegram, I learn of the assassination

of President KENNEDY. The British flag has been fufled and

creped since this morning.

Very high consideration,
