photograph of Luisa RODRIGUEZ Calderon, who he stated

had been connected with the DGI (Directorio General de

Inteligencia) and the former Secretary of the Young Com-

munists in the Cuban Ministry of Exterior Commerce.

According to AMMUG/1, the Cuban Government thought

Government while in Mexico so she was recalled to Cuba.

AMMUG/1 was not sure of the details but recalled something

concerning her having received a letter from an American.

Further, AMMUG/1 recalled something about an American

This photograph is part of the surveillance of the
