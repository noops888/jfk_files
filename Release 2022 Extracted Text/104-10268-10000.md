Mexico Station Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Embassies (1963)

:.:

1. Unilateral Coverage:

From the time the Mexico Station was opened in April 1947 until

the arrival of Mr. Win Scott as Chief of Station in 1955, the Station had

developed a support apparatus to exploit leads from the Soviet Embassy in

Mexico City. This umbrella type project (LIPSTICK

nearby and the availability of langauge (English, Spanish, Soviet, Polish,

Czech, etc.) transcribers. Generally, these were Mexican or Mexican-

• American recruited agents.

Three photographic sites were handled by a Station case officer

• assisted by technicians on TDY from Headquarters who advised the Station

on the best types of cameras, films, and concealment devices. These

operations had sub-crypts under project LIPSTICK (namely: LIMITED, LILYRIC

and LICALLA). LIMITED was a fixed site directly opposite the Soviet Em-

bassy. (across the street) which had both a vehicle and a pedestrian en-

trance. The gate to the Soviet Embassy was on the northwest corner of the

Soviet compound and the LIMITED site was diagonally across a double laned

street on the southeast corner of' that block. (See attached diagram).

LIMITED was the first photo base and operated strictly on an experimental

basis in the early stages. This base, however, was closed when the Sta-

tion received word that the photograph of the "unidentified man" was

being released by the Warren Commission. LILYRIC was an alternate photo-

graphic base. It was located in an upper story of an apartment building

on the same side of the street as the LIMITED site bu

the middle of

the block south. It had a planted view of the

insate of the soviet

Embassy. LICALLA, the third photographi

was located in one of a

row. of four houses on the south

side

grothe Soviet Embassy compound.

This site overlooked the

orden of the Soviet Embassy compound. The

purpose of this opera

anawas to get good identification photographs of

Soviet personnel. The three photographic sites were managed by a re-

cruited agent who was a Mexican citizen, the son of an American mother

and Mexican father (deceased). This agent collected the film from the

LIMITED and LILYRIC sites three times a week. The film was then de-

veloped and printed into 8 x 10 contact print strips.

LICALLA film was

originally processed in the Station but in early 1959, due to the resig-

nation of a technician, this film like that of LIMITED and LILYRIC was

processed

on the outside by a recruited agent.

Mobile surveillance was conducted by two American staff officers.

These two officers organized a surveillance team of six recruited agents

which used late model cars and a panel truck for surveillance. The team

could be activated by radio from the LIMITED site whenever someone of

interest left the gate of the Soviet Embassy. These agents were aware of

the LIMITED site since they had been issued LIMITED photographs for

identification purposes.

The Station also conducted a unilateral ma

the nature of the Mexican services at that time. The Mexican Direction

of Federal Security (DFS), with which we conducted liaison, was a hip-

was principally occupied with political investigations and control of

foreigners. Their agents were wiel feels, and corrupt. A station

officer trained a number of them in name tracing and travel control. In

1958, at the instigation of a Mexican official, a joint telephone tap

operation came into existence.

LIENVOY, was run by a Mexican officer. The listening post had 30 lines

connected at one time. The transcription room was staffed by Mexican

Army officers. In 1961, because of mismanagement by the Mexican prin-

cipals, the Station chief, himself, became the project case officer. A

Station officer assisted him in the daily supervision of the listening

post, and in picking up the transcripts and the tapes.

There was also

an American technician inside the listening post.

3. Oswald Coverage:

In mid-1962, the Mexican officer in charge of LIENVOY (the

joint tap operation) asked the American officer at the LEEjoy listening

post for the telephone numbers of the Soviet, cuban satellite in

bassies in anticipation of possible coverage

taps on these Embassies so

that they would not be discove

ến the Mexicans hooked up their

taps. The Mexicans so

after connected five Cuban lines, five

Soviet lines, three Czech lines, two Polish lines, and one Yugoslav

line.

At the listening post, a live monitor made short summaries of

conversations of interest which were then included in a daily resume

for the Chief of Station. Later, when a reel was completely recorded,

full transcripts were typed and passed to the Station; however, there

was usually a time lag of a day or two. Reels which contained Russian

that block. LIIITD was the first bese and it onerated strictly on an

on arinental basis in the early stages. I think the lexi Station bought

one storey

this property (a/Spanish Colorial stone house) through LINOUSIE (check to

be sure). Later this house began to fall apart. This base was closed when

the Station got word thet the photo of "uniden nan" was being

releasea to the

public by the Warren Cornission. The photo operators were moved to another apt

nearby. The property was sold (under an operational agreement with LIMOUSINE

for a long term lease on the top floor of a new apartment biding to be built

on this site). LILYRIC was planned as an alternate photo base to LINITED.

It was in an upper storey (3rd floor -check) on the sare side of the street

as LIMITED but in the middle of the block South. It had a slanted view of

the front gate of the Soviet Eirbassy. The agents in LIMITED and LILYRIC (both

Vexican families) as far as we knew, were not acquainted with each other.

This site overlooked the back garden of

the Soviet Embassy compound.

The purpose of this operation was to get good

identification photographs of the Soviet personnel (uno at thet time were largely

unidentified in Mexico Station records).: The three photo sites vere handled by

Ramon Alvarez (Mexican citizen of U.S. mother who taught elerentary level at

the American School). Ramon collected the film gekke

and LILYRIC three times a week. His sister's husband, Carlos (Mexican doctor) :

to accumulate, the inside co (iahoney) becane disgusted and took the film out

for Ration's brother-in-law to process (probably early 1959). Thus Ramon became

the handler for all three photo bases.

LIUST, 1, ote). This was hardled by Glen WIDDEN (outside ISD officer) ana

l'ahoney using HQ TDY teams for monitoring. This

opsration was also separate

from LICALLA. The two houses in between were rented

to unsuspecting tenants.

c. Mobile surveillance was developed by Anderson and later placed

under Mahoney and Joseph Sancho.. This team consisted

of a half

dozen or so agents who used three to four late model cars aná a

panel truck (which could be used on stake_outs for photo covera e).

The plan was to activate this group by radio (from LIVITED BASE)

Soviet

when soneone of interest left the/Embassy gate and

stay with then

until they made their meetings. These agents knew about the LITED

BASE because they had LI:ITED photos

for identification purposes.

This worked fairly well until about the middle of 1958 (check date)

when one of the surveillance agents got too close to his target and

was arrested by the Mexican transit police

and turned over to the

Mexican Secret Service.

By the time, the Station could arrange through

a cleared attornento bath his out (Juad Austin of the Goodrich,

Little and Riquelate firm), the agent: had identified Sancho (who wes

evacuated across the border at Nogales by Bob Shaw) and the inside-.

phone number of Mahoney. (who vas subsequently replaced by Louis

Puckett). As a result of this flap, the LIF?AT project was broken

up into several others. The agents were not changed but were given

Frank

new crypts. /Estancona and Peggy Haggard replaced Anderson in handling

the unilateral phone taps. Puckett replaced Mahoney and handled the

surveillance team (LIENTRAF) and the photo bases through Remon.

During this period, the J.S.

Ambassador Robert C. Hill (reflecting the policy of then Sec State J.F. Dulles)

was energetic in organizing groups to "fight cormunisn".. One of these

seeds

grew into a proposal Miguel Aleman (jr. son of former líexi President), acting

for Loçez l'ateos, made to Win Scott for a joint telephone tap operation. This

project (LIENVOY) went through about four distressing years of a shakedown.

The lexican in control (LIELEGANT) was inexperienced, old, and greedy.

His

son (LIFIVOY-2) was a masterpiece of deceit and corruption. LIELEGANT also

ranipulated control over the principal agent of LIBIGHT mail intercept.

With this forevarning, LIFEAT (unilateral coverage) was disconnected. However,

2 Polish,

there was usually a time lag of a day or so. Those transcripts which sad

period (fall of 1963) the reels were probably being brought into the station

and carried to Boris by one of the people fron the Soviet Section or they nay

have been carried to him by Flick but I think I brought the reel in and gave

it to Herbert Manell to take to Boris. Herbert Wanell and his wife Berbara

handled all of the processi: g of Soviet transcripts. ly job involved screening

the photographs as soon as we learned that the man calling hinself Oswald was

However, here again there was a backlag because the

photos were picked up three tines a week but the ones ricked up were usually

for dates a few days previously because the doctor proceased the film on a

night time basis.

frequently develoced mechanical difficulties. Bob Zabarnardi and Scathar

(I think) handled this film - pick up and delivery. Lorne l'ackay screered

the film inside the station.

I am certain that the Oswald call came to our attention from the

Soviet line. It was picked up and taken to Boris for a translation because

the caller was trying to speak Russian. Any delay was caused by waiting to

compare the photographs with the typed transcript. There were no copies of

transcriots every made in languages other than Spanish or

Item 74, page 2

An unidentified man (speaking Spanish) calls the Soviet Embassy

Consulate at 1037 hours and asks for the Consul. He is told that

the Consul is not there.

The unidentified man asked what is needed

to get visas to go to Odessa. He is told to call back at 1130 hours.

Item 137, page 2

At 1235 hours a man named ALATRISTE (not a Soviet) from inside the

Soviet Embassy Consulate calls out to number 45-37-72 (Colonial

America, probably a pension or hotel but number not listed in the

telephone directory) and speaks with a man named SAN ROMAN.

ALATRISTE says that he is in the Russian Embassy and they need to

know what day the boat "KALONIA" will arrive in Odessa, that the

Soviets will also need copies of the passenger manifest....

(One concludes that ALATRISTE and SAN ROMAN are shipping representatives

for the boat "KALONIA"',

and needed routine visa information, First

a call was made to the first listing for the Soviet Embassy in the

Mexican telephone directory (which turned out-to be the Military Attache).

They got the phone number for the Consulate and the address.

After

making a call

to the Consulate and learning that it would not be open

until 1130 hours, ALATRISTE went to theraddress to get the needed

information.)

• Item 395, pages 7 and 8

Just after 1600 hours,

the Soviet Consulate received a call from the

cuban Consulate (Sylvia DURAN who said

she had there a U.S. citizen

who had requested a transit visa to Cuba because he is going to the

USSR. DURAN wants to know with whom he spoke at the Soviet Embassy

because she sent him over to them telling him that if the Soviets

approved the visa then the Cubans would give him one without anything

more, advising the (Department of) Inmigration in Cuba.

She wants

to know with whom he spoke because he says that he doesn't know

either with what person and who told him that certainly there would

be no problem.

The Soviet asks DURAN to wait a minute.

After a

short wait DURAN explains the same thing to another Soviet.

This

Soviet tells her to leave her telephone (number) and her name and

someone will return the call. DURAN gives her name and telephone

number 11-28-47 then says as a personal thing, she has moved and

has not advised them of a change of address so will not receive their

Bulletin and can give it to them now.

The Soviet asks her to call

KOUKHARENKO in order to change that address and asks for the name

of the (Cuban) Cultural Attache.

DURAN says it is Teresa PROENZA

whose number is 14-13-26.

The Soviet thanks her.

SILVIA DURAN, ONE IMPORTANT QUESTION STILL PUZZLES USE

CHEN LEE

OSWALD WAS IN MEXICO CITY IN LATE SEPTEMBER ANDEARLY OCTOBER TO

GET A SOVIET VISA AND A CUBANGE

NSIT VISA, DID HE WANT TO TRAVEL

TO CUBA RIGHT AWAY, ALONE, OR HAVE HIS WIFE JOIN HIM THERE AND

THEN LEAVE FOR CUBA, OR DID HE PLAN TO RETURN TO THE STATES FIRST

AND THEN LEAVE LATER• ALTHOUGH IT APPEARS THAT HE WAS THEN THINKING

ONLY ABOUT A PEACEFUL CHANGE OF RESIDENCE TO THE SOVIST UNION,

IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT HE WAS GETTING DOCUMENTED TO MAKE A QUICK

ESCAPE AFTER ASSASSINATING THE PRESIDENT.

2. PLEASE RESTUDY YOUR LIENVOY MATERIAL AND GIVE US YOUR OPINION,

AND ALSO HAVE MEXICANS QUESTION SILVIA DURAN VERY CAREFUI

THIS POINT. ADVISE.

OCT 25 1960

Dear Dicks

Our efforts to answer recent informal inquiries, including some

from the White House Staff, have revealed that, though CIA and the

FBI have detailed records concerning Americans who have been recruited

as Intelligence agents by Blos countries, there does not appear to be

a complete listing of those Americans now living in Bloc countries

who might be called "defectors".

Using the definitions of DCID 4/2,

these persons might be described as those who have either been

capable of providing ussful intelligence to the Bloc or those whose

desire to resettle in Bloc countries has been significantly exploited

for communist propaganda purposes.

This would mean that no attention

need be paid to Americans whose resettlement within the Bloc had no

counter-intelligence implications or had attracted no particular

attention; for instance, this definition would not cover individual

US citizens of East European or Chinese origin who returned to the

"homeland" because

they had never been completely assimilated into

the American society.

There is attached a list of such persons, covering the last 18

months, and it would be appreciated if the Agency could verify and

possibly expand this list for the use of interested Bureaus of, the

Department.

Sincerely yours,

Hugh S. Cumudng,

With regard to that, Nicaraguan's; allegations that the man was in the
