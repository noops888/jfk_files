Mexico Station Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Embassies (1983)

1. Unilateral Coverage: co
From the time the Nexico Station was openied in April 1947 until
the arrival of Mr. Win Scott as Chief of Station in 1955, the Station had
developed a support apparatus to exploit leads from the Soviet Embassy in
Mexico City. This umbrella type project (LIPSTI! ted of multiline

of lines tapped wa! ted only by the availability of a listening post
nearby and the availability of langauge (English, Spanish, Soviet, Polish,

Czech, etc.) transcribers. Generally, these were Mexican or Mexican-

*. American recruited agents.

R

Three photographic sites were handled by a Station case officer
assisted by technicians on TDY from Headquarters who advised the Station
on the best types of cameras, films, and concealment devices. These
operations had sub-crypts under project LIPSTICK (namely: LIMITED, LILYRIC
and LICALLA).- LIMITED was-a fixed site.directly opposite the Soviet Em-
bassy (across the street) which had both a vehicle and a pedestrian -en-

street on. the southeast corner of that block. (See attached diagram).
LIMITED was the first photo base and operated strictly on an experimental
basis in the early stages. This base, however, was closed when the Sta-
tion received word that the photograph of the “unidentified man" was
being released by the Warren Commission. LILYRIC was an alternate photo-
graphic base. It was located in an upper story of an apartment building
on the same side of the street as the LIMITED site mee middle of

Soviet personnel. The three photographic sites were managed by a re-
cruited agent who was a Mexican citizen, the son of an American mother
and Mexican father (deceased). This agent collected the film from the
LIMITED and LILYRIC sites three times a week. The film was, then de-
veloped and printed into 8 x 10 contact print strips. LICALLA film was
originally processed in the Station but in early 1959, due to the resig-
nation of a technician, this film like that of LIMITED and LILYRIC was

processed on the outside by a recruited agent.

Mobile surveillance was conducted by two American staff officers.
These two officers organized a surveillance team of six recruited agents
which used late model cars and a panel truck for surveillance. The team
could be activated by radio from the LIMITED site whenever someone of
‘interest left the gate of the Soviet Embassy. These agents were aware of

the LIMITED site since they had been issued LIMITED photographs for

identification purposes.

winder Mahoney and Joseph Sancho, This tean consisted of a half
dozen or so agents who used three to four late model cars end a
panel truck (which could be used on stake_outs for photo covera-e).
The plan was to activate this group by radio (from LIMITED 3ASE)
when soneone of interest left the/Esbascy gate and stay with then
until they made their meetings. These agents knew about the LRITED
BASE begause they had LIMITED photos for identification purposes.

This worked fairly well until about the middle of 1958. (check date)

by Jack Brady who found himself in the same pincer movement of having Scott
approve a request by LIELEGANT that Brady had turned down by the son, LIE;VOY-2.

Years eve 1959. As I recall, it vas a sakeshift arrangerent of volunteers
through most of 1960 and 61 with Tom Hazlitt producing voluminous reports on
their activities and recruitirg agents right and left enong Cuban netionals in
Mexico City.

the period prior to Oswald's visit and the subsequent investigation ty the
Warren Comission. To deterine who ves there and what they were doing I

have gro:ped persons tozether chronologically with areas of their assignnent

Item 295, page 3

At 1626 hours, A Soviet calls from the Soviet Embassy Chancery
to the Cuban Consulate and asks for Sylvia DURAN. He asks

DURAN if the american has been there.

DURAN: Yes, he is still here.

SOVIET: According to the letters that he showed them from the (Soviet)
Consulate in Washington, he wants to go to the USSR to stay
a long time with his wife who is Russian, but also the
answer had not been received (by him) regarding his problem.
That accordingly these transactions take 4 or 5 months but
without prior approval from the USSR, they have to request
and even then, they could not issue the visa hene (in Mexico
City) without asking Washington. Yet accordingly * this man
(the American) , “+ showed him a letter in, which: he*(the
American) is a member of an organizati¢him.favor of Cuba
and said that the Cubans could not + ‘fint ‘the visa without
the Russian visa and now the et “doesn't know what to do
with him, because he ee tor’ r°the answer from
Washington. aN 3°

DURAN: ..with them also, beg Sy ‘problem with him (the Anerican)

is that he doesn WSériyone in Cuba and in that case it
is very ek fre him a visa, because he was

thinking of sing his visa, because he mew it was
going to take ong time waiting for the Russian visa in
Cuba, and then go on to the USSR.

SOVIET: ..that the thing is that if his (the American) wife were

~ now in Washington (and) going to receive the visa right now

or the permission from the USSR to return to her country, (if)
she is going to receive her visa in Washington, then having
this visa, she can commmicate to whatever place, this
permission, for example; here or in any other place (he) can
Teceive it, but right now they do not have them.

DURAN: ..certainly and neither can (the Cubans) give him a letter
because they do not know if the visa will be approved.

SOVIET: They can only give the visa according to instructions.

DURAN: Then that is what she will put on his application.

SOVIET: Neither can I give him any letter of recommendation because
I don't know him and pardon me for bothering you.

DURAN: It was no bother, thank you very much.

Item 74, page 2

An unidentified man (speaking Spanish) calls the Soviet Embassy
Consulate at 1037 hours and asks for the Consul. He is told that
the Consul is not there. The unidentified man asked what is needed
to get visas to go to Odessa. He is told to call back at 1130 hours.

Item 137, page 2

At 1235 hours a man named ALATRISTE (not a Soviet) from inside the
Soviet Embassy Consulate calls out to number 45-37-72 (Colonial
America, probably a pension or hotel but number not listed in the
telephone directory) and speaks with a man named SAN ROMAN.
ALATRISTE says that he is in the Russian Embassy and they need to
know what day the boat '"KALONIA" will arrive in Odessa, that the
Soviets will also need copies of the passenger manifest....

(One concludes that ALATRISTE and SAN ROMAN are shipping: feptesentatives
for the boat "KALONIA", and needed routine visa infomiation,\First

a call was made to the first listing for the Soyiet. Embassy in the
Mexican telephone directory (which turned ougsto be the Military Attache).
They got the phone number for the Consulate andthe address. After
making a call to the Consulate and learni that it would not be open
until 1130 hours, ALATRISTE went Gvadéress to get the needed
information.)

+ Item 395, pages 7 and 8 Ke Be

Just after 1600 hours, cg Soviet Consulate received a call from the
Cuban Consulate (Sylvia DURAN) who said she had there a U.S. citizen
who had requested a transit visa to Cuba because he is going to the
USSR. DURAN wants to know with whom he spoke at the Soviet Embassy
because she sent him over to them telling him that if the Soviets
approved the visa then the Cubans would give him one without anything
more, advising the (Department of) Immigration in Cuba. She wants
to know with whom he spoke because he says that he doesn't know
either with what person and who told him that certainly there would
be no problem.’ The Soviet asks DURAN to wait a minute. After a
short wait DURAN explains the same thing to another Soviet. this
Soviet tells her to leave her telephone (number) and her name and
someone will return the call. DURAN gives her name and telephone
number 11-28-47 then says as a personal thing, she has moved and

has not advised them of a change of address so will not receive their
Bulletin and can give it to them now. The Soviet asks her to call
KOUKHARENKO in order.to change that address and asks for the name

of the (Cuban) Cultural Attache. DURAN says it is Teresa PROENZA
whose number is 14-13-26. The Soviet thanks her.

_Dear Dicks

Our efforts to answer recent informal inquiries, including some

‘from the White House Staff, have revesled that, though CIA and the
:. FH have detailed records concerning Americans who have been recruited
as intelligence agents by Bloc countries, there does not appear to be
a complete listing of those Americans now living in Bloc countries
who might be called "defectors". Using the definitions of DCID h/2,
_ these porsons might be described as those who have either been
capable of providing useful intelligencé to the Bloc or those whose
desire to resettle in Bloc countries has been significantly exploited -:
for communist propaganda purposes. This would mean that no attention
need be paid to Americans whose resettlement within the Bloc had no
counter-intelligence implications or had attracted no particular‘, |
attention; for instance, this definition would not cover individual
US citizens of East Buropean or Chinese origin who retumed to the
"homeland" because they had never been completely assimilated into
‘the American society.

| : a There is attached a list of such persons, covering the lest 18

; oh . >} months, and t would be appreoiated if the Agency could verify and

' i "sy possibly expand this list for the use of interested Bureaus of. the

He was last seen by the landlady then. Some ve have immigration records showing him

entering Mexico on the 26th which very strongly suggests that he was not in Mexico

on the 16th. what we are trying to find out is where he was every single day -
