MEMORANDUM FOR: Heary Hecksher

YT regret that Iwasn't able to spend more time on
this cnse, interesting as it was. I do have some reservations,
however, in expressing an opinion on Ray since the files are
not complete and extensive research should be undertaken
first; but even sith this reservation I am convinced that one
can sce the picture clearly of the hesitation on the part of
this Agency to support Ray. When support was offered it was
always with some coad:tion, one of which was for Ray to join
the FRD, Although Ray «ss a supporter of Cuban-exile
unification, he was not soing to be forced into joining the
FRD with threats of Son-support.  - -

As you know. Ray was Minister of Public Yorks for Castro
until he resigned his pest in August 1359. He hightailed it
into the Escambray Mountains where he began the now unsuccessful
fight to wiseat Castro. Through intermediaries, Ray had
asked the Havana Station for military assistance, but in
almost every instance be was denied this aid. I say almost
simpty because the file is not clear on whetter we condescended

and dropped supplies.

Ray's political philosophy is somewhat equivocal, but
by-and-large he is strongly for a democratic system of
government and for str economic and social reforms, He
reportedly would respect individual liberties and a
representative government. He would reportedly maintain close
tics with the United States and remove Communism from Cuba.
Unlike Castro, there is nothing in Ray's background to suggest
that he is a communist or sympathizer, A new government in
Cuba, especially ore whose aim is to rid Cuba of Communism,
will, without questian, ask the United States for economic
assistance. I tend ta doubt if we will provide this assistance
without some caveat and the question remains then whether Ray
would be willing to accept conditions to United States aid.

I think he will for he will soon realize that without it he
will have no alternative but. to turn to the Soviet Union and

__—I_doubt if he will be wilting to continue the economic and
gocial chaos now so prevalent in Cuba.

If the decision were mine, J would suggest running an
operation cinitiar to the one usang ANBIDLY-1, We should
asx Ray to put together a list of people whom he would select
for certain governaent positions if Castro were overthrown.
It should not take long fur one to determine the type of an.
administration Ray would have. Each of the individuals he
ists could be checked to determine his political feelings
and his feclings toward the United States. This is important.

In any case I would support him if for no other reason

than to test his determination, strength and to gain further
knowledge of his political ambitions.
