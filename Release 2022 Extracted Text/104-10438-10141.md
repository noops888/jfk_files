Allegation by a Senior Cuban Diplomat.

Concerning the Role

of Cuban Exiles

in

the Assassination of President Kennedy

According to a fairly reliable source, a senior

Cuban diplomat stationed abroad made certain charges in

late. September 1977 concerning

the alleged role of Cuban

the assassination of. President John F. Kennedy.

This diplomat

made these allegations to his colleagues

course of an official meeting

in his embassy. The

diplomat

among other things

that Cuban

such as former Cuban

Air Force officer Di

Lan (fnu)

and others had been

involved in the

assassination of

President Kennedy.

The diplomat referred

in the

context of a security lecture

he claimed that counter-revolutionary activities by Cuban

exiles have increased in recent months:

He said that

recent information had arrived implicating Di a z in the

Kennedy assassination.

The diplomat did not mention any

other Cuban exiles by name or provide

any further details.

He did not identify the source of his information, although

our scurce had the impression that

tions were based on

a recent cable

from the Cuban Ministry

of Foreign Affairs.

2.

This division

has no other factual information

concerning the diplomat's

allegations.

We believe

that

the basis for the diplomat's statement was, probably, in

article which appeared in the New York

"Daily News"

on

20 September 1977.
