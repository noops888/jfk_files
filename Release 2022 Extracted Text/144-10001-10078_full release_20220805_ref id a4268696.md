CUBAN STATEMENT ON VISA FOR OSWALD

FR Havana: RAUL ROA

TO New York: Cuban Mission to the UN

Msg Nr:

25 Nov 63

I am reproducing below the note given to the press by the

Ministry:

With relation to the information published today in the

newspaper Excelsion in Mexico City, affirming that LEE HARVEY

OSWALD had requested a transit visa for travel to the Soviet

Union at the Cuban Consulate in Mexico in September, the Cuban

Government requested information from the officials of our

Consulate in that city confirming that it is certain that

ME. LEE HARVEY OSWALD requested the transit visa for travel to

the Soviet Union on 27 September in the said Consulate.

On being informed by the consular officials that their

office could not grant such a visa without the authorization

of the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Relations, which likewise

would not grant it if it was not previously authorized by the

country of destination, Mr. OSWALD left the Consulate visibly

disgusted.

The said visa was never granted.

This detail, in connection with the other circumstance

that surround the facts, confirm our suspicion that the

assassination of KENNEDY was a provocation against world peace,

perfectly and thoroughly planned by the most reactionary sectors

of the United States.

It is evident that these sectors planned beforehand to

involve Cuba and the Soviet Union in these deeds.

The inconceivable and inexplicable impunity with which an

individual of known penal antecedents assassinated OSWALD, the

principal accused of the assassination of President KENNEDY, in

the presence of the police themselves and in the (5G] of a

prison, demonstrates in a scandalous and indisputable manner

that the powerful reactionary political forces within the

United States are making use of all their resources and influences :

in order to conceal those who master-minded KENNEDY's assassination,

and the true motives for it.

World public opinion demands the enlightening of the deeds.

â€¢It is absurd that the political authoritkes and the prosecuting

attorney of Dallas have declared that the case is closed when

hardly 48 hours have passed since a deed of so great a result as

the assassination of the President of the United States.

Regards.
