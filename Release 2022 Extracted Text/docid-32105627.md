that thing --

true and for anything he did,
That is absolutely/if there /is any blames it is
mine. That's the way we operate.

Now, basically, who was the target then?

The target was Castro.

And why did you feel -- or why did Bissell feel that

it was appropriate to use the syndicate? 4
gambling

Because of the/interests of the syndicate in the

Cuban mess.

They had -- there had been some question whether or.
not they could continue under Castro and therefore

other plans on the assassination or. did this plan
The plan, as I recall, petered out.

And did you become involved with any other person
to try to get these pills into Cuba?

have any contact with on the top echelon.

should be --

have you see that because it is verbatim.

Was there anything that you knew about this plan

to assassinate Castro that you didn't tell Kennedy?,,

taping you said that you told him everything. Would «
that ‘be?

session took? a
About half an hour at least. &

Atleast a half an hour. Do you know whether or not

him?

effect that he was to know about these things. u
-- Words to that effect. a)
:

<

He said he wanted to know about these things.
Did he tell you that you shouldn't do this at all?

No.

Did he in any way say that he disapproved of what
had been done in the past?

record: shows was in May of 1962, did you know that

Bill Harvey was undertaking another plan along these lines? Did

you know that or -~?

the time. Is that right?

check the pills out to see whether or not they
might dissolve or anything along that line?

check things like that --

dropped in 1961 and you said "no". Did you know of any plans other

No.

on the tape that I've been out of the Agency--kept

away from it--for twelve years, so if there was something, I
don't remember.

Br

E:

B:

Do you know of any other attempt at assassination
plots other than the Castro plot?

Absolutely nothing:

Do you have any suggestions or recommendations
concerning making the Agency a more effective

Agency just based upon your experience, an Agency that will do
a good job of intelligence but will-also protect the rights of

Americans?

E:

B:
E:

Bi

Bear in mind now that we are--it is all right to
talk about the rights of Americans, but the rights
of Communists is a separate subject to me.

People abroad, you mean?

Yes.

Colonel Edwards, I am just going to ask you one or
two more questions. In your work in the Office of

Security, were you aware of the fact that there had been some kin

of wiretapping incidént out in Las Vegas involving either Dan
Rowan or Phyllis McGuire.

E:

B:

E:

B:

I knew of it from hearsay.
Do you remember who told you about it?
I think it was Bob Maheu.

Do you know anyone else outside of the Agency that
might have known of any of these plans at the time

that: they were being undertaken to try and assassinate Castro?

E:

B:

What plans?

The plans that were being developed, trying to
assassinate Castro. Was there’ anyone outside the

Agency other than the syndicate people and the people they were
getting--was there any person in the White House that you knew
who knew about this?

E:

B:

E:

NW 64578 Docid:32105627 Page 10

Not that I know of and I am sure there were not.

You basically believe that this was a plan that was

developed by whom then?

By Bissell--by Bissell.

There is not--I mean--I would like to point out

ABWAGIT quod *a citrus AHL WOYd KdOOLOHA



B: And you thought this was developed in connection
with the Bay of Pigs?

E: Right

Br Do you know if Mr. McCone knew about this when
4 he came in the Agency?

E: I don't know, but I don't think he did,

B: All right. Do you know whether or not Helms

eventually knew of the plan?

E: Yes.

Bs Helms did. - :
E: Yes.

Br I believe that's all. I'm going to turn the tape

off now. Is there anything else you'd like to say
for the tape?

E: No, I don't think so.

Br By the way, Helms did have knowledge of the briefing
of Attorney General Kennedy, did he not?

E: I'm not sure.

B: OK. You don't know if it was. I'm going to say

as a matter of fact I may have misled you because
I have notes that indicate that he did not know of the time you
briefed the Attorney General. Do you know anyone else that ‘did
know or did you just go over with Houston on that?

Ez Just Houston and myself

- KAVAMIT Gdod *Y GIwago AHL WOUd 1dOD0LOHa

Br And do you know if Attorney General Kennedy talked
with anyone else in the Attorney General's office?

E: I don't know. I would imagine that he talked with
Mr. Herbert Miller...’

Br Do you know that of your own knowledge or you
just think you do?

Er No, no.

NW 64578 Docid:32105627 Page 11


B: All right. Anything else you want to add for the

record?
E: - No, '
B: ; All right. Thank you very much, sir, for your
cooperation.
E: ‘Sure.
Bs One last question, Mr. Edwards. Did you ever. hear

anyone say that there was a need to develop what
was called an executive action capability on the part of the
Agency which was defined asan ability to liquidate foreign
leaders where it was required for American foreign policy?

-E: No.

B: You never heard either the phrase “executive action
capability” used?

Er No.
. about
B: Did you ever hear the discussion/any need to develo}
a capability to be able to assassinate foreign
‘ . leaders?
E: No.
B: And I think you said you don't know of any attempte

plans to assassinate people other than the Castro
target. Is that correct?

E: That is correct.

B: OK. Thank you. -
