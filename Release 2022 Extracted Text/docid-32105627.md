That is correct.

Do you remember what he said to you - and what you

said to him. about this assassination plan?

Yes, I remember that. -- You had better turn off

that thing --

You wanted me to restate the question.

Bissell asked me if I had any assets

Did you ever talk to either Rosselli or Giancana?

I never met Sam Giancana.

I talked with

Johnnie on several occasions.

Who did you use as your case officer?

I used James O'Connell.

You told me in a prior conversation that whatever

O'Connell did he did for you. Is that correct?

for anything he did,

E:

That is absolutely/if there /is any blame/ it is

mine. That's the way we operate.

B:

Now, basically, who was the target then?

E:

The target was Castro.

B:

And why did you feel —- or why did Bissell feel that

it was appropriate to use the syndicate?

gambling

E:

Because of the/interests of the syndicate in the

Cuban mess.

B:

They had —- there had been some question whether or

you thought the syndicate might be interested in getting rid of Cas

E:

That's right.

B:

All right. Do you know the means by which they were?

going to try to get rid of Castro?

E:

Yes. I know.

B:

And what was that?

E:

By placing botulism pills in his food.

B:

And supposedly there was going to be a person that

was going to get the pills over into Cuba to a

restaurant which Castro frequented. Was that it?

E:

Yes.

B:

E:

And do you remember the name of the person who was

going to do that?

I believe it was Juan Orta.

B:

E:

And do you know if the plan was carried out -the plan

obviously didn't succeed since Castro is still

living. Do you know if the pills ever got to Cuba?:

No. Not of my own knowledge.

B:

E :

Do you know what happened to Orta? As to why he

did or did not follow through with the plan?

Orta got scared.

B:

E:'

Who

was to get in contact with Orta? Was that

the syndicate?

I don't remember.

PH

B :

All right.

Well, Orta got scared -- was this

still in 1961 when he got scared? The Bay of Pigs, &

by the way, was in the Spring of 1961.

E:

I believe it was

"61.

B:

After he got scared, did you get involved with any

other plans on the assassination.or did this plan

go on the shelf, or what happened to it?

E:

The plan, as I recall, petered out.

B:

And did you become involved with any other person

to try to get these pills into Cuba?

E:

No.

GERALD

B:

E:

Now; who inside the Agency besides Bissell did you

have any contact with on the top echelon.

Very important.

The plan was approved by Alan w.

Dulles and General Cabell.

B:

E:

So there was Alan Dulles who was the DCI.

Yes.

B:

And General Cabell was his deputy.

E:

That's right.

E:

And then this Richard Bissell.

That's right.

Now, at some subsequent time did you ever have

occasion to brief anyone in the Administration

or the Government. about this plan?

B:

I briefed Mr. Harvey.

That was inside the Agency.

E:

Yes.

B:

Do you know whether or not Harvey --.

E:

Oh, oh, and I briefed Robert Kennedy.

B:

Let me first talk about Mr. Harvey.

Do you know whether or not Harvey was going to

pick up the plan again at a later time or not?

E:

I did not know.

B:

OK. You briefed Robert Kennedy. Is that correct?

And who was with you at that briefing?

Robert Kennedy and Larry Houston.

Oh, yes. It should be on the record. I'd rather

have you see that because it is verbatim.

Was there anything that you knew about this plan

to assassinate Castro that you didn't tell Kennedy?

No.

Did he tell you that you shouldn't do this at

No.

Did he in any way say that he disapproved of what

Bill Harvey was undertaking another plan along these lines?

the time.

Is that right?

No.

Now, you mentioned these pills. Did you ever

check the pills out to see whether or not they

might dissolve or anything along that line?

E:

I checked the pills on some guinea pigs.

B:

E:

B:

E:

Why did you check the pills?

Because I wanted to be sure they worked..

And, did they work on the guinea pigs?

They sure did.

No.

B:

Colonel Edwards, I asked you whether or not you knew

of any subsequent plans after these plans that were

dropped in 1961 and you said "no"

• Did you know of any plans other

than the plans that involved the

use/this botulism pills?

E:

No.

B:

Is there anything else that you can think of that

might in any way be relevant or related to this

matter that you would like to state for the record?

E:

No.

Is there any question you can think of, whether

I've asked it of not that in any way would involve

this subject?

There is not--I mean--I would like to point out

the tape that I've been out of the Agency--kept

away from it--for twelve years, so if there was something, I

don't remember.

B:

Do you know of any other attempt at assassination

plots other than the Castro plot?

E:

Absolutely nothing!

B:

Do you have any suggestions or recommendations

concerning making the Agency a more effective

Agency just based upon your experience, an Agency that will do

a good job of intelligence but will also protect the rights of

Americans?

E:

Bear in mind now that we are--it is

all right to

talk about the rights of Americans, but the rights

of Communists is a separate subject to me.

What plans?

The plans that were being developed, trying to

getting--was there any person in the White House that you knew

Do you know if Mr. McCone knew about this when

Helms did.

Is there anything else you'd like to say

for the tape?

By the way, Helms did have knowledge of the briefing

of Attorney General Kennedy, did he not?

E:

I'm not sure.

B:

OK. You don't know if it was.

I'm going to say

as a matter of fact I may have misled you because

I have notes that indicate that he did not know of the time you

briefed the Attorney General.
