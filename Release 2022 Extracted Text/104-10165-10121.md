1. It is especially desired to commend the OSS units that were ettached .
to or served in-conjunction with this headguerters and these Chinese armies
and groups whose operations were ccordinated torough this headquarters with
the Chinese Supreme Headquarters.

2, The varied end unusud) tyre of duty rerforned by these units made
their performance of duty most difficult. Ia te of the telief of reny
foreigners, oesed upon ordinary news reports thet the Chinese were firished
guerilla fighters of long experiecce in such operations against the Jepenese,
there wus ectually little of this type of caxbat that tad been carried on
effectively for the pest tuo years. . a eine

G

3. ‘The arrival of aggrecsize and competent sroups of officers, sany ~
with prior comendo service in the Zuropean Theeter, rrovided a great impetus
to the Chinese. These young officers, with little or no crior service in
China, were edle to obtain the confidence of the Chinese entirely becouse of
their silitery efficiency and ability to teach and preduce results and to
fight elozgside of the Chinese iz taeir units. The cormandovunits overcame
many difficulties ard produced outstanding results during their service,
in China. * : : beresery :

conpetent, cooperative, end cutstanding for cortion sense and judgment. :

H Because cf their efforts, many cf tho difficulties which are inherent in

12 dely 19L6

SUBJECT: Captain Lucien Conein
TO Mr. Richard Eelzs

1, Reference is nade to your reyzisition dated kh June 19h6,
requesting a Liaison and Con.dzeting Officer for amzon. Such request
was made by Lieutenant Colonel Zubler, ixecutive Officer. Purther
reference is nade to correszcxderce froz colenel Kubler dated 19
June 1946, under wiich he suggests that Captain Lucien Conein
presently assigned as Mess and Club Officer, de detailed to fill the
above request. a :

2. Captain Conein was reassigned to Amzon at the insistence
of high echelon War Department authorities. When serving nis first
i tour of duty in ETO, Captain Conein becsre involved with the daughter
i of the editor of one of tue leading De Gacllist publications. The
matter apparently was 3 sericus one for x:en Captain Conein was
i returned to the United States, ‘rench officials contacted United States
i Goverment authorities ix Xachington, calling to their attention the
relationship which had previcusly existed tetween Captain Conein and
the aforementioned girl. 2ecause of this situation, SsU was directed
- to return Captain Conein in an innocuous position to STO for the pur-
: poses of settling nis persoral affairs with the aforementioned girl.

3. The suggestion of Colonel Kubler that Captain Conein be used
as Liaison and Conducting Officer has been thoroughly discussed in
Personnel Branch and with Security Branck. It is their manizous

_ opinion that the choice of Ta>tain Conein to fill this recuisition
would be unwise. Because of His past history of versoral relationships
with high French officials, and because of the fact that Captain Conein
is supposed to cccusy an inco-spicuous position, it is deezed aivisable
‘that he renain in his present position ami not be transferred to a
position where he aight subject the organization to criticism and
censure.
