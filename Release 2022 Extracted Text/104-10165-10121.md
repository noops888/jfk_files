: Strategie Services Officer, 055.

I. It 1s especially desired to cormend the OSS units that were attached.

to or served in conjurction with this headquarters and these Chinese Amies

and groups whose operations were coordinated tarough this beadquarters with

the Chirese Supreme Zeadguarters.

2o The varied and unusual type of duty performed by these units sade

their perforance of duty most difficult.

In spite of the belief of sery

Ioreigners, based upos ordinary neis reports that the Chizese were fizished

guerilla fighters of long experietce in such orerations against the Japanese,

there mus actually little of

this typo of coabat that had been carried on

effectively for the past tro years.

3. The arrival of aggressive and competent groups of officers, sany

with prior comrando

service in the European Theater, provided a great inpetus

to the Chinese.

These young officers, with little or no prior service in

China, vere eble to obtair the corridence of the Chinese entiraly bascusa of

their =ilitary efficiezey and ability to teach and produce results azd to

fight alogside of the Chinese ir their units.

The commando units overcane

many difficulties ard produced outstanding results during their service

In China.

This hoadquerters has coordinated nost of 1ts work zith these units

through Colorel Willian R. Peers, Colonel Willian P. Davis,

and It. Colonel

Alfred I. Cot.

All three of these officers have proven to be especially

competert, cooperative, and cutstarding for cormon sense and judgenent.

Because cf their efforts, nany of the difficulties which are inherent in

coordineting nilitary operations mhich are renored fray the channel of

military commend bate never eror arisen.

2.

In the overail planning for the reorganizatisa of

ANZOU and

the streaniining of services personnel (as jiscussed

oy Mr. Leats on his recent irip to rashington), it nas cecided

to combine responsiblilties of seversi services granch citicers,

thus automaticaily ellainating the position of yess and Ciub

officer.

3.

original plans cailed for the rearuitzent of tro

Junior officers

fron the United States,

soth of thon have injicated

ney are not interested in the assignsent offared.

In adiltion

It has becoze

an urgert necessity to izediately assign a junior

officer to conducting and liaison

dutles out of the office if crief

of Mission.

Captain Conein has been assigned to this task in

addition to nis cutles as less and club officer. The time sent on

supervisors

control of the nesses and clubs has

reiched the point

there it entails a total of only about four or five iays per mati.

These duties are principally accountaililty both for supply nd

cash funds connected with the sesses and clubs.

Ise duties of

the concucting and liaison officer are sost peculfar in nature

in thât no set scherule of cutles can

be outlined at least rith

respect to tine.

There häve been ircividual condücting &ssign-

aents that involved a sininun sf a lew hours of a given day ind

otner times such conductiro assignment actually lasted two or taree

or tore sayso

These assignuents come up at unusual times and 1t

1s isperative that de have avallable such junior afficers ts seet

all dezadis nade upon us when they ¿ctually arise.

on the other

hand, the essentlal ness and club duties uay be very reil asani-

oiched in between the more important dutles of the conducting

officer.

4.

There has been some discussion as to the unrellabllity

of subject officer for reasons union to the

ariter.

Thile 1t

1s perhaps true that during the war no une ever t:ok a dis vies

SUBJSCT: Captain Lucien Cocain

TO

8 MI. Richard Feins

I. Reference 1s nade to your revisition dated le June 1946,

requesting a Liaison and cordocting Officer for inzos.

Such request

was made by Lieutenant Colorel Tabler, Executive Officer. Purtter

reference 15 nade to corres-enderce fru jolonel lubles dated 19

June 1946, under mich he surrests that captain Lucien Conein

presently assigned as less and Club Officer, be detalled to fill the

above request.

2. Captain Conein was reassigned to Anzon at tbe insistenco

of high echelon far Departsent authorities. Then serving his first

tour of duty in ETO, Captain Conein becare involved with the daughter

of the editor of one of tue leading De Gallist publications. Ibe

matter apparently nas a sericus one for jen Captain Conein mas

eturned to the United States, rench officials contacted United State:

sorerasent autcorities in tastington, eating in thair attention ti

relationsnip which had previously exsted betreen captain Coneir and

the aforementioned girl.

Because of this situation, suT was directed

to return Captain Conein in an Immocuous position to 310 for the pur

poses or settling nis persoral alfairs vita tre alarezentioned girl.

3. The suggestion of Calorel Kubler that Captain Conein be used

as liaison and Conductirg Officer has been thoroughly discussed in

Personrel Branch and with Security Branck.

It is tbeir unanious

opinion that tire choice of Japtain Conein to 1111 this resuisition

would be unwise.

Because of his past hissory of persoral relationships

with high French officials, and because of the fact tbat Captain Conein

18 supposed to cccupy an inco-spicuous position, it 1s deened aivisable

that he remain in his presen: position asi not be transferred to a

position where he night subject the organization to criticism and
