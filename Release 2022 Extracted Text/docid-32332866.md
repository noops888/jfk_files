on Improper Activities in the Labor or Management Fields.

In connection with the aforementioned efforts to identify

the location of the hunting lodge, the informant originally

Purishing this information, learned on tober lin and life-

through JACK KRUPA, a New Kensington,

long friend and hunting companion of

the MANNARINO brothers,

that SAMUEL MANNARINO's hunting lodge is not locatea in

Somerset County, Pa., but is actually a twenty-room farm house

generally referred to as a hunting lodge, surrounded by approx-

imately 200 acres of densley wooded land

the Pennsylvania-Maryland border, approximately a fifteen minute

drive by automobile from Hagerstown, Maryland. The informant

recalled that he had been in the office of SAMUEL MANNARINO

during December, 1957, when the press ana radio carried

the first accounts of

the fact that GABRIEL MANNARINO had been

called before the Federal Grand Jury in New York. He stated

that shortly thereafter SAMUEL MANNARINO received a telephone

call from GABRIEL MANNARINO in his presence and hurriedly

told him

"they are trying to serve you with a subpoena. Take

off for the brush."

The informant stated that it seemed

logical to him that if SAM MANNARINO's remarks were interpreted

IIterally his advice could have been his subtle way of telling

his brother to proceed to the hunting lodge.

The aforementioned informant said that according to his

source of information, the general area surrounding the

lodge is thickly populated with whiskey stills, and that local

game wardens are reluctant to enter the area because some of

them have been mistaken for Agents of the Alcohol and Tobacco

Tax Unit and have been fired upon by the moonshiners.

The Philadelphia Office was requested, through the Recorder

of Deeds for Franklin County, Pa., to attempt to identify

the aforementioned lodge and to display photographs of

MANNARINO and LA ROCCA at Waynesboro, Pa., and vicinity near

the Maryland border to game wardens, rellable police officers,

and other sources to locate the hunting lodge and determine

whether MANNARINO and LA ROCCA are hiding out in that locality

or have been there in the past six to ten months.

The New York Office advised on November 20, 1958, in reply

to a request to interview FRANK JOSEPH VALENTI, who is confined

to the New York City Civil Jail, that the New York Office believes

it inadvisable to conduct such

an Interview inasmuch as there

is no indication that he would be willing to cooperate with

the law enforcement officers at this time. It was further

noted that there is no indication that he could be interviewed

with full security and that his interview might be subjected

to public notice. It was also advised that the activities

of those confined are being very closely followed by the New

York State Crime Commission, and that former Special Agent

JOSEPH MILENKY; Chief Investigator for that body, is advising

the New York Office of pertinent developments.

The Baltimore Office advised on November 17, 1958, that Mrs.

LILLIAN COHEN, 3701 Clarinth Road, Baltimore, Maryland, advised

that she is the sister of MAX GOLDBERG, thes personal accountant

fOr LA ROCCA, and that she is employed

as a secretary in his

office.

She advised that GODDBERG is critically ill in the

New Kensington General Hospital and is suffering from an ulcerated

colon and other complications. She advised that doctors have

said that this illness could be fatal and if not, will cause

GOLDBERG to be incapacitated for some time. She

she was certain that LA ROCCA had not contacted GOLDBERG or

any of the members of his staff in the recent past and that

if he does so, she will immediately contact the Baltimore Office

of the FBI.

an idea that LA ROCCA and GABRIEL MANNARINO

He again surmised that they had been hidden in the past

by CHARLIE MURGIE of

them to Florida. He stated

that he had reason to believe that

they were staying close to home as he had learned that the wife

was observed during these spot surveillances.

Other Matters of a Miscellaneous Nature

"The Pittsburgh Press" carried a

front page article in its

The article stated that a new Ken-

man named THOMAS "SONNY" CIANCUTTI spent sometime

on October 28, 1958, with the Federal Grand Jury at Pittsburgh.

The article stated that there was speculation that the Grand

racket boss GABRIEL "KELIY" MANNARINO, where MANWARINO 1s

Jury was asking CIANCUTTI,

be the chauffeur of

It said. "KELLY" MANNARINO,, had been ducking

process servers with

amazing success for several months since

New York authorities started investigating the "crime convention"

which MANNARINO attended at Apalachin. The paper said that

another man testifying before the Federal Grand Jury on

October 28, 1950, was JOHN FONTANA, convicted of vote fraud in

1954 and the reputed operator of New Kensington's Barbout game.
