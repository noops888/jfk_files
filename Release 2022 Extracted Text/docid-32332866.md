Real Estate Department of the Potter Bank and Trust Company

in Pittsburgh, will keep the Pittsburgh Office advised of any

office inasmuch as MAX LOUIS GOLDBERG, the personal accountant
and close associate of the subject, makes his permanent
residence in that city. Although the Baltimore Office has
temporarily given up contacting GOLDBERG because of his critical
illness, it is felt that he may be contacted at a future date.
It should be noted that LA ROCCA owes GOLDBERG more than

$5,000 at present and tht if his illness does prove to be

fatal, it is a foregone conclusion that LA ROCCA will travel

to Baltimore to see the GOLDBERG family.

On October 29, 1958, the Philadelphia ©
T-4, who has furnished considerable rejiable informatio
\ ing the legitimate enterprises of the MANNARINO brothers\ and
particularly information concerning real estate transact
involving SAMUEL MANNARINO, had advised during February,
that SAMUEL MANNARINO, during the early portion of 1957,
urrounded by 200 acres

say that the lodge was located in Somerset County, Pa., and

on Improper Activities in the Labor or Management Fields.

In connection with the aforementioned efforts 'to identify

the location of the hunting lodge,the informant originally
furnishing this information, learned on October 28, 1958,
through JACK KRUPA, a2 New Kensington, Pa., councilman and life-
long friend and hunting companion of the MANNARINO brothers,
that SAMUEL MANNARINO's hunting lodge is not located in
"Somerset County, Pa., but is actually a twanty-room farm house ~
generally referred to as a hunting lodge, surrounded by approx-
imately 200 acres of densley wooded land in Pennsylvania near
the Pennsylvania-Maryland border, approximately a fifteen minute
drive by automobile from Hagerstown, Maryland. The informant
recalled that he had been in the office of SAMUEL MANNARINO
during December, 1957, when the press and radio carried

the first. accounts of the fact that GABRIEL MANNARINO had been
called before the Federal Grand Jury in New York. He stated
that shortly thereafter SAMUEL MANNARINO received a telephone
call from GABRIEL MANNARINO in his presence and hurriedly

told him “they are trying to serve you with a subpoena. Take
off for the brush." ‘The informant stated that it seemed
logical to him that if SAM MANNARINO's remarks were interpreted
literally his advice could have been his subtle way of telling
his brother to proceed to the hunting lodge.

The aforementioned informant said that according to his

source of information, the general area surrounding the

lodge is thickly populated with whiskey stills,.and that local
game wardens are reluctant to enter the area because.some of
them have been mistaken for Agents of the Alcohol and Tobacco
Tax Unit and have been fired upon by the moonshiners.

The Philadelphia Office was requested, through the Recorder

of Deeds for Franklin County, Pa., to attempt to identify

the aforementioned lodge and to display photographs of
MANNARINO and LA ROCCA at Waynesboro, Pa., and vicinity near
the Maryland border to game wardens, reliable police officers,
and other sources to locate the hunting lodge and determine
whether MANNARINO and LA ROCCA are hiding out in that locality
or have been there in the past six to ten months.

The New York Office advised on November 20, 1958, in reply

to a request to interview FRANK JOSEPH VALENTI, who is confined
to the New York City Civil Jail, that the New York Office believes
it inadvisable to conduct such an interview inasmuch as there
is no indication that he would be willing to cooperate with
the law enforcement officers at this time. It was further
noted that there is no indication that he could be interviewed
with full security and that his interview might be subjected
to public notice. It was also advised that the activities

of those confined are being very closely followed by the New
York State Crime Commission, and that former Special Agent
JOSEPH MILENKY, Chief Investigator for that body, is advising
the New York. Office of pertinent developments.

The Baltimore Office advised on November 17,1958, that Mrs.
LILLIAN COHEN, 3701 Clarinth Road, Baltimore, Maryland, advised
that she is the sister of MAX GOLDBERG, theg, personal accountant
for LA ROCCA, and that she is employed as a secretary in his
office, She advised that GORDBERG is eritically i11 in the

New Kensington General Hospital and is suffering from an ulcerated
colon and other complications. She advised that doctors have
said that this illness could be fatal and if not, will cause
GOLDBERG to be incapacitated for some time. She stated that

she was certain that LA ROCCA. had not contacted GOLDBERG or

any of the members of his staff in the recent past and that

if he does so, she will immediately contact the Baltimore Office
of the FBI.

C. CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES

T-5, who has furnished reliable information in the past, advised
that he has been unable to develop any information concerning

the present whereabouts of LA ROCGA. He stated that LA ROCCA'ts
associates have been very secretive of late, but that he has

an idea that LA ROCCA and GABRIEL MANNARINO may again be in Warren,
Ohio, He again surmised that they had been hidden in the past

by CHARLIE MURGIE of Warren, Ohio, and that MURGIE had taken

them to Florida. He stated that he had reason to believe that
they were staying close to home as he had learned that the wife

of LA ROCCA is going to have an operation soon.

and that the second
is a subpoena for the appearance of LA ROCCA pefore the U.S.
Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in the Labor

or Management Field. He again stated that the dates for

these appearances have still not been set and that he

cannot do anything further regarding them until LA ROCCA
returns to Pittsburgh or is located in some other jurisdiction.
He advised that he will notify the Pittsburgh office in the
event he should learn anything regarding LA ROCCA in this
regard.

Surveiliances Conducted Relating to this Investigation -

Other than those surveillances conducted at Mercy Hospital,
Pittsburgh, which have already been set forth, spot surveillances
were made.on October 24; November 3, 7, 24, 28; and December

10, 1958, at 900 West Ingomar Road, Ingomar, and at 12 McCandless
Street, Pithsburgh. Nothing of interest to this investigation
was observed during these spot surveillances.

Other Matters -of a Miscellaneous Nature

"te Pittsburgh Press" carried a front page article in its
October 28; 1958, issue entitled, "Probe Spotlight on
Chauffeur of Mannarino." The article stated that a new Ken-
sington, Pa., man named THOMAS SONNY" CIANCUTTI spent sometime
on October 28; 1958, with the Federal Grand Jury at Pittsburgh.
The article stated that there was speculation that the Grand
Jury was asking CIANCUTTI, reputed to be the chauffeur of
racket boss GABRIEL "KELLY" MANNARINO, where MANNARINO is
presently hiding. It said. "KELLY" MANNARINQs, had been ducking
process servers with amazing success for several months since
New York authorities started investigating the "crime convention"
which MANNARINO attended at Apalachin. The paper said that
another man testifying before the Federal Grand Jury on
October 28, 1958, was JOHN FONTANA, convicted of vote fraud in
1954 and the reputed operator of New Kensington's Barbout game.
It should be noted that FONTANA is a close associate of MIKE
