MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD:

SUBJECT : AMMHIP/1 Meeting, New York City,
28-29 Feb 1964.

1. Heoting Time/Place: “AMIMIP/1's office, 31 W.
47th St., New Yor! ty, Friday, 28 Feb. and Saturday, 29 Feb.
Accounting below is composite of the two meetings.

2. Purpose of Meeting. To discuss course of actioa f
by AMVHIP in response to ‘s receipt of word from AMLASH via =
a letter sent from Paris by Carlos Jorge ROBRENO, aka "El Mago", :

3. Details of Meeting. i
a, On eb, A/1 called the writer via sterile i

phone to say that he had received a letter from ROBRENO (R)
postmarked 25 Feb., Paris In one paragraph, R stated that he
had been given several "encargos” from AMAISH for A/1 to be
“tranemitted personally" (see attached copy of letter). Since
the above information was not mentioned in the clear over the
phone, it was decided that the writer should meet with 4/1 in
order to see the letter personally and to guide A/. in any

, Subsequent steps. The writer arrived at A/l's office at
oa 1240, 28 Feb.

Db. It was A/l's impression that the “encargos”
cited in the letter included things beyond personal requests,
but he was not absolutely certain of this interpretation due
to the brevity of the paragraph. To resolve this expeditiously
ap requested in the letter, it was decided that A/1 should call
Paris and talk directly with R, avoiding, of course, any phone
call to the Cuban Embassy there. To achieve this, it first
was necessary to call Luis FERNANDSZ Ruiz, aka "El Inglais" pees |
(5), at GAL-9913) and ask him to get in touch with Luis Enrique cet
PRASANCOS (9), who in turn could pass a message to R asking |
him to call A/1l in New York. No interest of an ops nature : H
was revealed here, as the Paris group was told only (and
truthfully) that R had written to A/\ in New York and that part |
of his letter was unclear in its meaning, thus A/\ wished to
talk directly with R in order to clarify this. (A phone call
was not at all unusual in this case, given A/l's normally
extensive use of the phone, plus the fact that the letter
indicated some urgency and did not include a return address.)
FERNANDEZ readily agreed to the request even thoogh it was
after 2200 Paris time. A/1 waited in his NYC office until

0100 Paris time, but received no return call.

©. During the period subsequent to the call to
FERNANDEZ, the writer discussed the situation with afl. It
was agreed that there was little we could do until we had
heard from R himself. The writer also took this opportunity to
let A/l know that we were rather concerned over the arrival
of R witha jssage from AMLASH, particularly if indeed it
has any connection with AMLASH's future plans. (We knew also
at this time via the PARI cable, but did not so state to A/l,
that R had revealed to TRASANCO that he also expected another
*courier", Jose Alberto IRARRA Martin, aka “El Loco", to
arrive next week with additional word from AMLASH.) A/1 was
so told that the arrival of these messages from AMLASII
further clouded by the fact that AMLASH was in touch with
us through another channel.

a, In reply, A/l agreed that there may be som
cause for concern, but in fact he was not too apprehensive es
he felt both men were "100%" behind AMLASH. A/1l went on to
say that by this he meant that both wen hed been for a long
time assoolated with the circles in which AMLASH had been a
leader, and could be regarded as "loyal" ¢o AMLASII. However,
he did speculate that both men were perhaps closer friends
with each other than either was with AMLASH. A/1 also
stated that both AMLASH and he did not personally oare for the
(R and IBARRA), but that AMLASH did feel that at least
good “action type" and could probably be fitted into
AMLASH plans at some point. (This was reported also in A/l
Contact Report dated 23 Oct 1962) A/1 went on to describe R
@s such the smarter of the two; IBARRA being not too intelligent.
A/\ also stated that both nen drank quite a bit, turning
into belligerent and talkative drunks. Ie stated that this
over-indulgence, with its resulting belicosity, was undoubtedly
responsible for R's shooting of the American in a bar brawl
over a tomato in Havana several yearg ago. According to A/l,
IBARRA ips more commonly known as "El Blanco", after the na
of his step-father, Lino Blanco, to whom IBARRA's mother is
how married.

e. At ca 1630 LMT (New York), on 29 Feb, TRANSANCO
and R returned A/l's call. In brief, R stated that he had
some items to discuss with A,/1, but that it was "nothing
iumediate.” He stated that he had written a subsequent letter
to A/l containing more information and which should arrive
in New York the next Monday or Tuesday (meaning the 2nd or
Srd of March). 8 also stated that IBARRA was coming to Paris
the following yk (week of 1 March) and should bring with
him additional details. A/1 said that he was quite busy at

present and preferred to postpone coming to Europe at this
time if it wasn't absolutely necessary. R said that he felt
it could wait at least until IDARRA arrived; then the matter
could be re-considered. R said he could ke reached at the
following telephone No. 783-2952, at :east for the next f -
days (A/l failed to ask for an address or for. the location -
owner - of the phone). R al stated that he planned to
visit Spain a "little later", but did not disclose to A/1 the
nature of the trip. The conversation ended with A/1 stating
to R that he would be in touch with him later after he had
received the letter from R. Iie also asked R to let his know
when IBARHA arrived in Paris,

f. A/l will contact the writer as soon as he gets
the letter from R and will mail it to the accommodation address
he regularly uses.

4. Seourtty, The writer left A/l's office for the
last time ca + 29 Feb 1964, No incidents of a security
nature were noted. It is noted for the record, however,
that A/l has given AMSPORT/1 a temporary job in his firm,
and the writer's presence was observed by AMSPORT during this
series of meetings.
