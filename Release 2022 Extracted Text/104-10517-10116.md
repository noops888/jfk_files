on 27 Feb, A/I called the writer via stertle

phone to say that he had received a letter from ROBRENO (R)

postmarked 25 Feb., Par18,

In one paragraph, R stated that he

had been given several "encargos" from AMALSII fOr A/l to be

"traneuitted personally" (see attached copy of letter).

Since

the above information was not mentioned in the clear over the

phone, It was decided that the writer should meet with i/l in

order

to see the letter personally and to guide A/l 1n any

subsequent steps. The writer arrived at A/l's office at

oa 1240, 28 Feb.

It was A/l'8 Impression that the "encargog"

otted in the letter included things beyond personal requesty,

but he was not absolutely certain of this interpretation due

to tho brevity of the paragraph.

To resolve this expeditlously

as requested in the letter,.

It was decided that A/l should call

Paris and talk directly with R, avoiding, of course, any phone

call to the Cuban Embassy there.

To achleve thi8,

was necessary to call Luis FERNANDS? Ruiz, aka "El Ingla18*

(5), at GAL-9913) and ask him to got in touch with Luis Enrique

TRASANCOS (9).

who in turn could pass a message to R asking

him to call A/1 in New York. No interest of an ops nature

was revealed here, as the Paris group was told only (and

truthfully) that R had written to A/l in New York and shat part

of his letter was unclear in its meaning, thus A/l wished to

talk directly

with R in order to clarify this.

(A phone call

was not at all unusual in this case, given A/l's normally

extensive use of the phone, plus the fact that the letter

indicated some urgency and

aid not include a return address.

FERNANDEZ readily agreed to the request even though it mas

after 2200 Paris time. A/l walted in his NYC Office until
