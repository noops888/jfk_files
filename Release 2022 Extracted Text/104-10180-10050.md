1.

on 14 December 1970,

the undersigned visited WUSHARP

at the latter's request.and had the following discussion.

WUSHARP asked whether me could use wiSLAß/l as a means of

cont acting Cuban officials for the purpose of establishing

Ities

which could later be exploited by HUSHIRP assets.

I explained to YUSHARP that WUSLAB/l had been instructed.

to adopt a passive role. in relationship to his Cuban

contacts, and to respond only to contact initiated by the

Cubans..

NESHARP stated that they understand our point of view

thoroughly.

At this meeting I briefed HUSIARP on the telephone

call from

a DGI representative cited in reference.

WUSHARP that I would give them a memorandum on this as

as a copy of the PO on Rogelio Rodriguez Lopez. (201-332665)

in which they expressed definite interest.
