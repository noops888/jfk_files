On June.10. 1968, the Jackson Office advised that
PCL ARTHUR LEE LOGUE furnished the Following information:

ARCARDING JOE PAT DA MOUR

LOGUE advised that according ‘to the last contact
he had with JOE PAT DAMOUR he was. residing. at Apartment~
1201, Peachtree Apartments, 2285. Peachtree Road, Atlanta, a
Georgia, telephone 876-0701. LOGUE said.-he does tot know
if this is the location that law enforcement. officers are
aware of but in the event they are not aware’of this
information, it should be used discreetly since DA MOUR
only gives his phone number and address x friends in
the burglary business that he feels hye trust.

LOGUE advised that ISABELI/ (LNU),. the.-exegirl ;
friend of ROBERT |EMERSON WHITE is How. living in the Atlanta
area and frequently contacts SOHN/ HENRY WILDER and. JOE PAT -
DA MOUR. LOGUE said it was the feeling of.a lot of the
burglars that ISABEL was an informant for the FBI since
she had been contacted by FBI Agents in Georgia. He .said
ISABELL claimed once in the latter part-of.:1967 that: BILLY
TEAL and JOHN HEN] Y WILDER threatened to kill her-in a motel
in Huntsville, Alabama, by giving her an overdose of drugs. é
LOGUE said at * thils time she’ allegedly ran -out of the motel
in the nude looking for the police..

LOGUE said that there were "syndicate" contacts
of the bank burglars in fampa, Florida and Miami , Florida,
as well as in thd Bahamd Islands. He said in the past
several months DA MOUR /had been contacted by a coyadicatel..
man in Tampa, Florida, and he made his contact by calling.
an attorny who represdnted SILLY DELANO WALDEN. He said” ~
he believes this attorney is from August, Georgia. LOGUE
said it was his information that the “syndicate" men had

\

NW 68262, Docld:32294367 Page 9 7


SEGRET

some bank in Florida they wanted hit and they were asking

for a good safe man to be sent down to lock things over.
LOGUE said that DA MOUR flew down to the Bahamas. accompanied.
by one of the "syndkate" men from Tampa to Lock the: situation
over. He said DA MOUR lived it up at the cagino and ran. up:
a big bill on the "syndicate" men and they: sent him back to
Atlanta saying they could not use him, :

: LOGUE said that DA MOUR would do: practically
anything illegal including strong armed.robbery. He
said DA MOUR’s m.0o.°is that of a robber rather then a
burglar. He said he specialized in stvong..armed jobs
where he goes into a home with one or more other’ individuals
usually wearing a mask and ties them up robbing the.-victims
of all their valuables. a :

He said he has heard rumors that-DA MOUR is a
‘suspect of unknown armed robberies inthe“Atlanta area
and DA MOUR has indicated he may possibly pull some bank. /
robberies particularly in the areas/where he is not known, ©
He said that he knows DA MOUR has“frequently flown to the
West Coast and it is possible that he may. have. been. involved
in. bank robberies in that ared. - f

fe said DA MOUR/4lso specialized.in sticking.
up. crap games or gambling operations where there is a. lot
of money /involved and the probability is. since. the victins
were engaged in illeg&l actions themselves, they would
not repert ‘the robbéry to the authorities...

He said DA MOUR is also frequently involved
in bank burglaries and since the Falkner, Mississippi
Bank torglary/Adkes to hit banks that have safety deposit
boxes! He said DA MOUR is not a very good safe man and
usually useg someone else who is familiar with the oxygen
lance and Burning bar procedure to get into the safes,

SEORET. :

He said in the past he knows-.DA MOUR has worked
with GENE CLAUDE EASTERLING, BILLY DELANO WALDEN. and
JIMMY KIMES. LOGUE described DA MOUR as. a vicious
vindictive individual who would not hesitate to kill
anyone who he thought may have double crossed him, but
on the other hand DA MOUR himself frequently double
crosses the men he works with. He said it was DA MOUR! s
favorite trick after rummaging through safety deposit
boxes, etc., in burglaries to say "all I got was a few
coins", when in fact it is obvious that he gets a lot of
loot which he conceals from his accomplices.

REGARDING BILLY DELANO WALDEN

LOGUE advised as far as he knows. BILLY. WALDEN
Operates all over Augusta, Georgia, but that he does -
not know his*present address. He said WALDEN“can always
be contacted by calling Mama Mia’s Restaurant in Augusta,
Georgia, and leaving a name and number“For -him to call back,
He said it is WALDEN's normal procedure to.check on the
individual who left their name béfore returning thecall.
He said that among the burglars they refer to WALDEN as
‘Rilly the Burner". He aj that WALDEN, however, is not
really a ‘good man with thé burning bar or oxygen lance,
but that ‘he is the supply source for this piece of equipment.

' LOGUE say that WALDEN is the contact man for
the fences in Yourigstowm and Chillicothe, Ohio. He said
that normally when burglars obtain savings bonds from bank

eburglaries they contact WALDEN and he puts them in touch
with /the people to deal with concerning the stolen-bonds.
LOGUE said Allegedly the men WALDEN deals with are °
“syndicate” men. . LOGUE said om one cecasiion LAWRENCE HEAD
told him /he ‘was to meet ome of the "syndicate"! men to fence
some bonds and he had never met this man before, He said

[7

SECRET

before he entered the place he was approached by a man who had
been following him and said "You're Mz. HEAD aren't you",

and when he said he was, the man told him to come with

him and he took him to the man he gave the bonds to. LOGUE
said he has béen told that the "syndicate!! men check out —
aman in this manner to make sure that he. is not being
followed to their place by any:law enforcement official.

LOGUE said he will probably be able to talk with
WALDEN and determine the source where WALDEN obtains
the burning bars commercially, as well as determining
the name of the fences in Ohio. He said: that the burglars
were now using two types of burning bars. one type being
burning bars that were home made and a larger type burning
bar which is obtained through BILLY WALDEN. He said
apparently WALDEN has a source where he can obtain these .
without them ever being traced back to amyone. ae

LOGUE said that WALDEN also ablegélly has contact
with the “syndicate” men in Florida .and if they want safe
men they usually contact WALDEN‘s,attorney who in. turn
communicates with WALDEN and tells him who to contact in
Florida, He said he has heard that WALDEN and some of his

ra :
associates may have been jdivolved in some strong armed
deals in the Miami areavwhere they forced their way into
the house/and then t! safe men such as WALDEN would
open the/safe and obtain the contents.

REGARDING WILLIAM LAWRENCE HEAD

LOGUE said he recently bad a conversation with
WILLIAM LAWRENCE HEAD, concerning, « trip he made to Tampa,
Miami, and the Bahama Islands to get in touch with "syndicate"
men/ who fore: antévseted in safe burglars. He said that HEAD

st

was to have made contact with BILLY DELANO WALDEN and the |
brother of the top "syndicate" man in the Tampa area. He
said the "syndicate" man or his brother is JOE (LNU), but
he said he has heard the last name but can not remember
the pronunciation of it as it is an Italian name. He said
: this man lives in-a large white clapboard. house in the
Tampa area and he believes it has a Spanish type roof,

&

S,

LOGUE said there might be some way of checking
out this trip to the Bahamas because he had some difficulty
with custom authorities. He said he traveled down to the
Bahamas under the name of DAVIS but on-the return trip
used the name ANDERSON which apparently got him in some
kind of difficulty with custom authorities. He said the
"syndicate" man who apparently got-in some kind of difficulty
with customs used the name of GOMEZ,

: LOGUE said HEAD told him they went to Nassau and
Freeport in the Bahamas where HEAD checked (3 into a hotel or
motel under the name of DAVIS. He saidethat WALDEN was to
have accompanied him on this trip but this occurred om the
same time that WALDEN's wife was-Committing suicide or
attempted suicide and he had immediately return to
Augusta, Georgia. He saidrthat apparently the same "syndicate"
people that DA MOUR hadwContacted were-the ones that HEAD ‘
was put in contact with. He said .ome ofthe banks they
were interested in Witting in the Bahamas was fingered by
a contractor who ,built the bank vault. He said he believes
this bank’ was near Freeport in the Bahamas.

He’ said that apparently the "syndicate" checked
with the Police Department and found out that this vault
was "bugged", but before they could relay this to everyone
involved, two of thelurglars that were to-hit the bank allegedly
got Arrested, one of them being a Negro man, EEE

He said HEAD told him that -one of the banks
they cased in that area had what he believed to be some
kind of British type of dlarm system and he mentiored the
mame CHUB TAYLOR MOSLER and this was supposed to h:ve been
in the bank in the Bahamas. :

He said HEAD apparently returned to Mississippi
without completing any bank scores’ but: that ‘apparently
the so called "syndicate" men had several banks inthe
Miami area as well as the Bahamas they weve interested
in burglarizing. LOGUE said he would:probably be able
to @etermine when HEAD intends to return to that area for
the purpose of burglarizing banks.

REGARDING BANK BURGLARY IN COMO, MISSISSIPPI, ON NIGHT OF
JUNE 4-5, 1968.

LOGUE said that this burglary was discussed _.
with him by LAWRENCE HEAD and BUDDY ADAIR (WILLIAM
JACKSON ADAIR). He said-the way they discugsed@ this was
they were not involved but they were almost positive that
this bank burglary was pulled by WuGHATOWARD POLK, aka,
"Red" POLK, He said that apparent” POLK had stolen a supply
of tools and burning bars from,HEAD and ADAIR which they had
stashed in eee near Lexington, Mississippi.’ LOGUE
said he was not {sure whether or mot’ POLK took their oxygen.
tanks with thém when th made out with the burning bers and
tools but he’ would pace i determine if the tanke were missing.
He said pa sticularly“if the tanks were missing he could
probably determin where HEAD stole them from and if there
were any Adentification numbers on them which could probably
be determined jt they wee the ones left at the site of the
Como bank. ye said POLK was considered a stupid burgler
by others in’the field as he would work with anyone not

knowing whether or not he could trust them,

LOGUE said that LAWRENCE HEAD and BUDDY ADAIR
had stolen numerous oxygen. tanks and acetylene tanks and
they had them stashed along with supplies of tools and
burning bars all throughout Mississippi, and surrounding
states. He said they accumulated a large supply of these
tanks about a year ago when they burglarized a large oxygen
equipment place in Meridian, Mississippi.
