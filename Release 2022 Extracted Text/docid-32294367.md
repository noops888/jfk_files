On Jume 10. 1968, the Jackson Office advised that

PCI ARTHUR LEE LOGUE furnished the following information:

REGARDING JOE PAT DA MOUR

LOGUE advised that according to the last contact

he had with JOE PAT DAMOUR he was residing at Apartment

1201, Peachtree Apartments, 2285 Peachtree Road, Atlánta,

Georgia, telephone 876-0701. LOGUE said he does not know

if this is the location that law enforcement officers are

aware of but in the event they are not aware of this

information, it should be used discreetly since DA MOUR

only gives his phone number and address to friends in

the burglary business that he feels he can trust.

LOGUE advised that ISABELL (LNU) , the ex-girl

friend Of ROBERT EMERSON WHITE IS nOW LIVing In the Atlanta

area and frequently contacts JOHN HENRY WILDER and JOE PAT

DA MOUR. LoGUE sald it was the feeling of a lot of the

burglars that ISABELL was an informant for the FBI since

she had been contacted by FBI Agents in Georgia. He said

ISABELL claimed once in the latter part of 1967 that BILLY

TEAL and JOHN HENRY WILDER threatened to kill her in a motel

in Huntsville, Alabama, by giving her an overdose of drugs.

LoGUE said at this time she ablegedly ran out of the motel

in the nude looking for the police.

LOGUE said that there were "syndicatel contacts

of the bank burglars in Tampa, Florida and Miami, Florida,

as well as in the Bahama Islands. He said in the past

several months DA MOUR had been contacted by a "syndicate"

man in Tampa, Florida, and he made his contact by calling

an attorny who represented BILLY DELANd WALDEN.

He said

he believes this attorney is from August, Georgia. LOGUE

said it was his information that the "syndicate" men had

some bank in Florida they wanted hit and they were asking

for a good

safe man to be sent down to look things over.

LOGUE said that DA MOUR flew down to the Bahamas accompanied

by one of the "syndicate" men from Tampa to lo0k the situation

over.

He said DA MOUR lived it up at the casino and ran up

a big bill on the "syndicate" nen and they sent him back to

Atlanta saying they could not use him.

LOGUE said that DA MOUR would do practically

anything illegal including strong armed robbery. He

said DA MOUR's m.O, 'is that of a robber rather

then a

burglar. He said he specialized in strong armed jobs

where he goes into a home with one or more other individuals

usually wearing a mask and ties them up robbing the victms

of all their valuables.

He said he has heard rumors that DA MOUR is a

suspect of unknown armed robberies Inthe Atlanta area

and DA MOUR has indicated he may possibly pull some bank

robberies particularly in the areas where he is not known,

He said that he knows DA MOUR has frequently flown to the

West Coast and it is possible that he may have been involved

in bank robberies in that area.

He said DA MOUR also specialized in sticking

up crap games or gambring operations where there is & dot

of money involved and the probability is since the victims

were engaged in illegal actions themselves, they would

not report the robbery to the authorities.

He said

DA MOUR is also frequently involved

in bank burglares

and since the Falkner, Mississippi

Bank burglary, likes to hit banks

that have safety deposit

He said DA MOUr is not a very good safe man and

He said in the pant he knows DA MOUR has worked

with GENE CLAUDE EASTERLING, BILLY DELANO WALDEN and

JIMMY KIMES. LOGUE described DA MOUR as a vicious

vindictive individual who would not hesitate to kill

anyone who he thought may have double crossed him, but

on the other hand DA MOUR himself frequently double

crosses the men he works with. He said It was DA MOUR'&

favorite trick after rummaging through safety deposit

boxes, etc., in burglaries to say "all I got was a few

coins", when in fact it is

obvious that he gets a lot of

loot which he conceals from his accomplices.

REGARDING BILLY DELANO WALDEN

LOGUE advised as far as he knows BILLY WALDEN

operates aid over Augusta, Georgia, but that he does

not know his presant address.

He said WALDEN can always

be contacted by calling Mama Mia's Restaurant in Augusta,

Georgia, and leaving

a name and number for him to call back.

He said it is WALDEN's normal procedure to check on the

individual who left their name before returning the call.

He said that among the burglars

they refer tO WALDEN aS

"Billy the Burner". He said that WALDEN, however, is not

really a good man with the burning bar or oxygen lance,

but that he is the supply source for this piece of equipment.

LOGUE said that WALDEN is the contact man for

the fences in Youngston and Chillicothe, Onio. He said

chat normally when burglars obtain savings bonds from bank

burglaries they contact WAlDeN and he puts them in touch

with the people to deal with concerning the stolen bonds.

LOGUE said

"syndicater llegedly the men walDeN deals with are

men. LoGUE said on one occasion LAWRENCE HEAD

told him he was

to meet one of the "syndicate" men to fence

some bonds and he had never met this man before.

followed to their place by any law enforcement official.

LOGUE said he will probably be able to talk with

WALDEN and determine the source where WALDEN obtains

the burning bars commercially, as well as determining

the name of the fences in ohio.

He said that the burglars

were now using two types of burning bars, one type being

burning bars that were home made and a larger type burning

bar which is obtained through BILLY WALDEN. He said

apparently WALDEN has a source where he can obtain these

without them ever being traced back to anyone.

LoGUE said that WALDEN aLso aLLegedLy has contact

with the "syndicate" men in Florida and if they want safe

men they usually contact WALDEN's attorney who in turn

communicates with WAldEN and teids him who to contact in

Florida. Hey said he has heard that WALDEN and some of his

was to have made contact with BILLY DELANO WALDEN and the

brother of the top "syndicate" man in the Tampa area. He

said the "syndicate" man or his brother Is JOE (LNU), but

he said he has heard the last name but can not remember

the pronunciation of it as it is an Italian name.

He said

this man lives in a large white clapboard house in the

Tampa area and he believes it has a Spanish type roof.

LOGUE said there might be some way of checking

out this trip to the Bahamas because he had some difficulty

with custom authorities.

He said he traveled down to the

Bahamas under the name of DAVIS but on the return trip

used the name ANDERSON which apparently got him in some

kind of difficulty with custom authorities. He said the

"syndicate" man who apparently got in some kind of difficulty

with customs used the name of GOMEl

LOGUE Said HEAD told him they went to Nassau and

Freeport in the bahamas where head checked tato a hoel or

motel under the name of DAVIS. He said that WALDEN was to

have accompanied him on this trip but-this occurred on the

same time that WALDEN's wife was committing suicide or

attempted suicide and he had to immediately return to

Augusta, Georgia. He said that apparently the same "syndicate"

were interested in hitting in the Bahamas was tingered by

a contractor who built the bank vault. He said he believes

He said that apparently the "'syndicate" checked

with

involved, two of the burglars that were to hit the bank allegedly

He said HEAD told him that one of the banks

they cased in that area had what he believed to be some

kind of British type of alarm system and he mentioned the

name CHUB TAYLOR MOSLER and this was supposed to have been

in the bank in the Bahamas.

He said HEAD apparently returned to Mississippi

without completing any bank scores but that apparently

the so called "syndicate" men had several banks In the

Miami area as well as the Bahamas they were interested

in burglarizing. LOGUE said he would probably be able

to determine when HEAD intends to return to that area for

the purpose of burglarizing banks.

REGARDING BANK BURGLARY IN COMO, MISSISSIPPI, ON NIGHT OF

JUNE 4-5, 1968.

LOGUE said that this burglary was discussed

WIth hIm bY LAWRENCE HEAD aNd BUDDY ADAIR (WILLIAM

JACKSON ADAIR). He said the way they discussed

this

was

they were not involved but they were almost positive that

this bank burglary was pulled by HUGH HOWARD POLK, aka,

"Red" POLK.

He said that apparently POLK had stolen a supply

of tools and burning bars from HEAD and ADAIR which they had

said he was not/sure whether or not POLK took their oxygen

tanks with them when they made out with the burning bars and

tools but he would try to determine if the tanks were missing.

probably determine where HEAD stole them from and if there

were any identification numbers on them which could probably

be determined if they wer the ones deft at the site of the

Como bank. He said POLK was considered a stupid burglar

by others in the field as he would work with anyone not

knowing whether or not he could trust them.

LOGUE said that LAWRENCE HEAD and BUDDY ADAIR

had stolen numerous oxygen tanks and acetylene tanks and

they had them stashed along with supplies of tools and

burning bars all throughout Mississippi, and

surrounding

states. He said they accumulated a large supply of these

tanks about a year ago when they burglarized a large oxygen

equipment place in Meridian, Mississippi.
