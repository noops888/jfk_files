Mrs! it TSD just told me
in the course of a_ visit that Herman
E, KIMSEY of BEYISION fame,
a former TSD5nick called her on
the phone and tried to get her to
have lunch with him, so he could
get her to analyse the handwriting
of some homosexuals who were
the "real murders of Martin Luther |
King". KIMSEY gives out that he
is working to exonerate RAY for
this peeccadillo. :
Bhrs, said she avoided contact 23 |
and will report this to Mr |

TSD Security Officer.o} (previously
she tol but he told
her to forget it and evade KIMSEY.
I suggested she better tell

as KIMSEY is capable of any action
involving her or the Agency.)

KIMSEY also told Mrs. thathis |
side-kick R Cleve BAKSIEK has fou
a way to use’ lie detector on plants |
even to detect people who murder

other plants in the presence ofa

plant that serves as a witess....
Nothing succeeds like excess....
