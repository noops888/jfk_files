citizenship. According to BARKER's recollection, this occured
in 1953. Dr. LAZO compiled a formidable file on the Subject”
‘and was in communication with a Washington, D.C. legal firm,
which BARKER dimly recalls as that of Edward Bennett WILITAIS,
who was to handle the case locally. A private bill was intro=
duced in the 83rd Congress by Congressman WILLIANS cf New Jersey.
to restore the Subject's citizenship, but BARKER does not know
why no action was taken’on the bill. At the time, he was in
financial difficulties and took a job as a tractor driver out—
side Havana for about & months, in which period he had no contact
with Dr. LAZO, who, as BARKER believes, interpreted his failure
to appoar in the office as a lack of interest in pressing the case
to @ successful conclusion.

8. ‘BARKER knows that Dr. LAZO and WILLIAMS had comited a
wery lengthy and documented file on his background, including his
wilitary record and awards from the Army Air Corps. Currently,
BARKER is traveling on a Cuban passport and is in the U.S. as an
"SP" paroled to Bernie REICHARDT.

6. The Subject pointed out that Dr. Mario LAZO entered the
U.S. about ago and is now in the Washington areas he
believes (73 jis in contact with-him. He knows Dr. LAZO is
familiar with all details of his case and could confira the
Adentity of the Washington attorney who handled the litigation
lonally. . BARKER recalls visiting the attorney's office in Wash-
dngton on one occasion, and Bennet WILLIAMS. was the name he
recalled. He believed the lawyer was involved in the Sewtor
MoCarthy hearings.

7. Based on the above informtion, the following recommend
ations ara. mades 03

a He. [lanes NOfi| be requested to ascertain from Pr.
Mario LAZO name of the Washington law firm which hoadied
Subject's case in 1953, and the reason for the failure of the
