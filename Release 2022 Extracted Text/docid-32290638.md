SUBJECT: CARLOS MARCELLO A 5-7

ANTI-RACKETEERING

Aloysius A. Dargis, a New Orleans informant, as ene
he received information which he had been unable to substantiate
that when Carlos Marcello recently illegally entered the. United
States from jatemala he did so by utilizing a shrimp bdat. operated
by one reri§feotine, Patterson, Louisiana, not further identified.
This ts ALOTUATLON ¥SCCLVET Coli cerning the méthod' of entry
into the. United States by Marcello. This matter has beén:the subject
of intense investigation by Immigration and Naturalization Sérvice
(INS)..since one of the outstanding indictments against the subject
charges illegal entry into this country after his deportation: to
Guatemala. The above has been disseminated to INS.

rrr

Marcello, who is a prime target for Federal prosecution,
“was deported to Guatemala in April, 1961, and reportedly illegally
entered the United States thereafter in the Summer of 1961. He is
currently under indictment and has been r@ileased on bond for deportation
charges, illegal entry into the United States after deportation to
Guatemala (both of these are INS cases), perjury and conspiracy to
defraud the United States. ‘The latter.two indictments are a result
of FBI investigation.

It is interesting to note that Marcello is alleged to have
financial interest in a fleet of shrimp boats opemting in the Gulf of
Mexico.

Bureau files do not show previously known contacts between
Felix. Golina and Marcello. They do indicate one Felice Golina,
Patterson, Louisiana, was allegedly involved in black market activities
during World War II in connection with the shrimp industry in Louisi
