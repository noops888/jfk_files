"“§. Rogarding a SRAC ayaten.for[6 EW/L's uo in Tripoli. Per *- -
Station's requost that approval be g nm to Lease another apartment’ in 9»
hig building would certainly onablo him to transmit from his own to the
fow#G apartment. Ho could bo provided with an appropriate radio (he :
already possesses two tape recorders) for this‘ purpose. fox 3SPEW/1 does not 10?
have a radio in hia car but could have one installed and~arrangements
made for him to transmit to NEUWIRTH's residence. The latter “is located
a@ half block from a main thoroughfare that (GSFEw/1 could frequently and U2
naturally use to get him to various locations in Tripoli. NEUWIRTH's:
reaidonce is also about a block and a half from Iden P wheref GSPEW/1 V2
makes a habit of stopping each Frida: ‘evening during the "happy hour."
He drives to the Iden P, as do Scher [HOCORKERS, and after parking his car | O02
could tranomit before entering the Iden P. GSPEW/1 also has a TV set, 02.
in the event this could be modified aé a SRAC device, but it must be taken!
into consideration that the Libyan programs are only presented during
evéning hours. The Station also has another safehouse apartment in the
Idon Q building which is. also located on a busy thoroughfare and a street
7|| GSPEW/1 would also have need to take in handling business and shopping

fairs. EUWIRTH has been planning to have a radio placed in this

apartment for use duging t meetings with Station assets.

6. ninoun[s EW/1L would often use SRAC only for transmitting
-|purposes. and it would not be necessary to query him on the information he
reported, two-way voice communications would probably be essential in
those instances whero he had tethnical and other fairly complicated data |
fo rolay which would necessitate his case officer being able to make .
Gortain it is understood and does not require clarification-and/or
amplification.
