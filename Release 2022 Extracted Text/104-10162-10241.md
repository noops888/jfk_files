1. Reference dispatch described our efforts against AEBOOR
and stated that the next phase would conaint of a 24 hour a day
surveillance of Subject for a period of about two weoks, The
Coverage was initiated at 0600 hours on 19 May, and terminated

oa
a 1535 hours on 26 May, the day of AEBOOR's departure for home \
eave,

2. The overall results of the surveillance effort were
interesting, and provided us with o groat deal of basie data which ‘
should prove valuable in futuro AEBOOR oporational Planning.
Although tho period covered must bo viewed as somewhat atypical

‘@ince it covered a time of proparation for homo leave, the basic

Thoro was

pattern could not have varied greatly from the norm,
dofinite evasive action disigned to shako surveil
AEBOOR on several occasions; there wore r
establishments which could casily sorve ai

(roported in BUENOS AIRES 3009) with an individual we failed to :

Reforonce: lICSW 7666, 11 Pobruary 1909

1, With the departure of AKBOUR and his wife on home Jeavo,

wo would like to ofYer a fow comments about him for possible future
action by the Station when he returns, The impetus for these
thoughts was a recent examination of the files of atl those Soviets
on the priority target dst to determine 1f, perhaps, one of thom
offers more of a potential for intonsive developwent tnan anotier,
Tho purpose of this review was not to discard tho agreod-upon targot
list, since this list is the rationale behind the entire concept

of soleoctive targotting; but rather, to attempt aa twin. of the
Statlon's focus on tae one particulur Sovies wie appears to be the
best selection for operational development among tio privrity group.
We have looked of such factors os suscoptibilities (known or
Potential) contacts, accossibility, etc. and, tor reasons discuscod
below, feel that ABOOR may be the beat selection for a determined
Station effort mined ot his eventual rocrudtmont, Thus, tho Station's
focus on the other priority Soviets would continue at its present
lovel but at tho same tima, ALBOUR would be placod “uncer the

microscope" as the object of a more intensive Station offort aimed
at gaining muledple accoss to him,

again and instigate a second mecting soon after Subject
returns from home icave. Since there are no other access
Gyeats now in voucie with Subject, th tential for assess-
ment of our target personality by direct Staffer contact
becomes crucial in the selective targotting procedure,
Through the advantages of direct asscssment, wo should be

- able to mika n good judgment concerning the suscep: ibilities
(or lack theroof) of ALBOOR and accordingly, determine the ~
Valuo in pursuing him as a priority target.

b, The impressions of AKBOOR and his wife from the one
meeting thusfer i to offer some possible avenues of approach
which the Station way wish to consider in their plunning. The
wife, in particular, was described as being more relaxed than
AuBOOR and bia he pro ed intorest in theatre, music,
‘and batlet, it might be possible for Nina T, HARGANUL to
exploit this intorest and invite her to selected cultural
events, If ALBOOR does not sha e's proclivitios

the wife appears to articularly appropriate

and her husband, accounts of this relationship from thar

husband constantly doing battle with a dominoor ing wife, If

their hests. T Is, of course, is natural with most couples
who choose not to air their personal differences in public,
but from our point of view, this lack of harmony betweea
ABBOOR and his wife offers distinct pussibilities for the
Btation to contact the wife independentiy and offer her welcone
diversions from the regimented and turbulent Lite with ber
husband. (We call your attention to the reference since it

ad. AVDEPTHs The ability to monitor ALBOOR through this
technical operation was a key factor in deciding to bring him
under cioser focus, it should be.able to provide the necessary
depth to any human assessment of the target and it gives us the
singular opportunity to “observe” AEBOUR when ho is relaxcd at
home and not exhibiting the official mannurisms and personality
which he must display in public and around his other Soviet
colleugues, If wo are able to expand the burgooning Staffer
Contact with Subjoct as well as place access agonts in touch
with him, then his reactions te these contacts can be monitored
and our moves against him tailored accordingly,

3. Aas part of the total offort to build up a large amount of
Angormation on the selected target, we are including a8 an attachnont,
ity Characteristic questionnaire (PCQ) with
ly employing it in conjunction with your
ssment of ALBOOR, we should be able to slowly bulld up
onough information on him that the indirect psychological as
ment techniqvcan also be spphied. The PCQ is o now form and less
time-consunin; an others we believe it should be on intepral part
th t proce focused on a target Soviot and thet
be aid in attempting to

that many of the questions irrelevant and have no bearing on the
determiustion of a sons susceptibility to manipulation, The

1. Even though we have maintained ABLANYARD for a
considerable length of time, we have not been able to
establish a pattern of activity for ASBOOR, The cause
of this lack is quite simple: AELANYARD has been main=
tained more or less on a working hour schedule, 4.0.,
from roughly 0800 to 2200 hours with occasional additional
night monitoring, Roalizing this, wo docidod to carry
out a two week operation whereby we usad difforent equip-

he geems to be ruluctant to talk at length in the language. fle also appears
to know some Georgian, He claims to know the Soviet Union west of the Urals

part of the country, From his commente and from observation it can be
asvuned that he enjoys Mexican and medurn American records and perheps

1. The Station has long been interested in the fact that
but two Soviets voside owsside of the Soviet “compounds.” In
tho fall of 1967 wo hogan o undLagornt investigation and casing
of the apartmant thon occupied by Our
undlateral investigation rovoaled that the lock on the door
of this apartmont was a Trabex--a look which reqnires at a
minimum several hours of picking. Simultancous to our
-wnilatoral investigation we loarned of) | planned
PCS departure, We also loasnod that the Soviets intended to
keop his spartmont and that it wos to be occupied by!
roplacemunt. In mid-January wo derided to send BIBAFFLE-3 to
tho apartmont building in order to betviend the portero. Wo
had hoped that tho portoro would be able to furnish us with @

key to tho apartment, On 25 January we learned that Ivan
ALFERYEV was arriving in Buenos Airva on 27 January. Une
fortunately timo had run out on us, We therefore decided to J
turn to BIOGENESIS.

“Qs ‘There wore sevoral reasons for this decision, First
lof all, we do not doubt tho operational value of having an
fud!y Anstallation in the apartment of an idontifiod sonior
KOB Officer, However, a unilntoral installation 1s a aifzloult
and ot times risky operation, Considering this and matching
it against tho potentinil tuko of the operation wo folt that a
fodnt oporntion woul’ ho moro practical. Cast also influenced
our doaisdon, At thy wamo time our exporionce with BYOGENES IS
in tho "Vista" operation showed that BIOGENESIS was porgectly
willing to give ud and only us the tapes irom the audio
Anatallation, :

3, As Oxpiained in Rezorence A we briefed BIOGENESIS
in the carly aftornoon of 25 January. BIOGENESIS immediately
issved instructions that the portero of tho building be
approachod, This was accomplished successtully in the
late afternoon of tho samo dsy, Unfortunately the portero

: did not have a koy, The sam: night a BIOGENESIS team oF

: threy (including BIBAFFLE-3 nnd BIOGENESIS-14) attempted

7 in vain to pick the Lock, In the course of this locke

4 picking exorcise PIBAYFLE-3 had to identify BIOGENESIS
interest in tho apartment to the owner of tho neighboring
apartmont, Fortunately this individual is wealthy and
was cooperative,

4. Once we had been forced to temporarily withdraw
(ALFERYEV occupied the apartment on 27 January), we
obtained through BIOGENESIS the bluoprints of the target
apartment and tho apartments which abutted. A study of
these bluoprints shows that the apartment bolonging to
tho wealthy coopsrative neighbor has a maid's room which
shares tho wall of the living room of ALFERYEV's
apartmont. We pointed this out to BIOGENESIS and suggested
that they onlist the further cooporntion of the owner in
ordor that a microphone could bo installed through the
common wall. Unfortunately tho owner had departed for
sevornl wooks leave.

8. Tho owner should be back in‘Bucnos Aires at
this timo and wo havo instructed BIOGENFSIS to approach
him again and to move on with the sgoration.. We are also
presently working on an LP, ‘ : o
