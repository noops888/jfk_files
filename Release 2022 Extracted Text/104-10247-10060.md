PRIORITY

1. SUMMARY. This dispatch contains a proposal for the re-
location of a highly competent, trained, experienced JNWAVE
agent, ANICE-14, to another WH area where he could be utilized
in student activities while completing his educational credits
for a law degree. Subject'’s effectivencss can no longer be fully
utilized in the UAWAVE area; it is proposed that his unique
training and qualifications may be of utilization to another
KUBARK Station. *

: 2. JUWAVE Station is currently utilizing a principal agent,
ANICE=14, who appears to be particularly well-qualified for use
in student activities in a Latin Arerican university. AMICE-14
has been a JMVAVE agent since February 1963. Prior to his being

Ee recruited by the Station, he had made ten clandestine trips into

~ Cuba. In tho year and a half since his YecruTtient, hé has made
five more clandestlne trips-uncer Station direction. We has re-
ceivod extensive FI and’ PM training. ife has recruited a number
of agents for the Station, both inside and outside o2 Cuba, up to
and including one high-ranking ofZicer in the present Cuban
Governnent., He has shown outst Qing ability anc initiative in
wll these activities. Unfortunately, 4-14 is now cu knowledgeable

of several interloczing operations currently teing inside
Cuba, due to his direct participation the: ‘ojects, that

MVAVE can no longer continue to allow A-14 to make any further

Rp
black infiltrations, despite his strong desire to continue doing
s0, A-14 has been told that for the protection of the intornal

assets he must make no furthor infiltrations. a

The training also included, groun discussions anc participation
in a series of appropriate operational situations cesigned to teach
operational planning techniques. Several live problems were worked
out by théstudents themselves, to acquire experience in applying
clandestine operational techniques. On Sunday, 10 March, an all day
exercise in Agent Meeting, Casing, Selection of Dead Drops and
Surveillance was held in the city of Key West.

The group eagerly participated in the caily physical training,
which included calisthenics, volley ball, swimming and long hikes.

II, Team Evaluation: pee

During this -period of re-training, the AMTRUNK Team performed
in an overall satisfactory manner. Two team members cid not
perform up to the Team's overall demonstrated proficiency, however,
the continued strong leadership on the part of AMICZ/14 should
raise the competence of the two weak tean members. The team
members are quite compatible, and espirit de corps is good, Their

motivation and morale is high. The AMTRUNKS were safety minded

on the range, practicing good security at the safesites and during

night movement exercises.

III. Individual Evaluations:

A. AMICE/14 - TA - "DAVID"

David is a personabdle young man in fair physical condition,
possessing above average intelligence. He has the ability to
learn and retain material without difficulty. Due to a tooth
extraction and subsequent ¢ ications, he was unable to parti-
eipate in the following training activities: Class work; 20, 21,
and 22 May and 3 June, Night Exercises; 22, 26 anc 28 May.

ability of understanding anc executing detailed instructions with

motivation and morale was cood; his interest and enthusiasm

phase of training. He can accurately ground navigate, read
Coordinates, measure distances, and. locate unknown positions
using intersection and resection, His report + the one night
exercise he participated in, was too general, lacking important
details on the target observed. With more practice, David's
reporting capability should show marked improvement. In the

MORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Assessment for Future KUBA
Utilization, ANICE-14

1. ANICE-14 was recruited in March 1963 for the AXTRINK project
which is concerned primarily with APROX activities. In Octcber 1963,
ANICE-14 became the P/A of the: ANTR team and concurrently Team
Leader. He has 6 other Ax under his supervision. ANICE-14 con-
tinued in this dual capacity until June 1964 when he was told that he
would not be permitted to.re-infiltrate in the near future. During the
course of five infiltration operations over the past year and nis day-
to-day duties as Principal Agent between operations, AXIC=-l4 has be-"
cone thoroughly familiar with the objectives and accomplishments of the
ANTRUNK operation--and concurrently, to a lesser degree, with a parallel
MHAPRON operation (AMLASH)--to the point where his capture inside could
result in the-complete collapse of both projects. This latest develop-
ment in which his activities have been confined to the coatinental
limits’ of PBPRIME iS strictly:against ANICE-14's wishes. as stated
above, AMICE-14 has participated in five clandestine infiltration opera=
tions under KUBARX sponsorship and in another ten before he became con-
nected with KUBARK. The five missions met with varying degrees of
success but in each ANICE-14 showed an uncommon amount of personal
bravery tempered with a realistic application of the principles of
clandestine operations. His performance in these operatiozs has also
been marked with a resourcefulness and stick-to-it-iveness which testi~
fy further to the high degree of motivation and personal integrity which
this agent possesses. .

2. ANICE-14 is 27 years old, married, and has three children from
four years of age to one month. He comes from a family of professional
people and has himself completed 4 of the necessary 5 years for a_law
degree at the University of Hava: While still in Cuba, ANICE-14 was a
student leader in secondary schools in both Matanzas and Havana Provinces
and a member of the Directorio Revolucionario (DR), one of the most active
of the anti-Batista organizations’ and probably Second only to the "26th of
July" in effectiveness. After the revolution, AMICE-14 held responsible
administrative positions in the Provincial Government and iz the Bureau
of Motor Vehicles. For a person o: his relatively young age, he has many
close friends in high positions 1.1 the Castro Government.

3. The most remarkable tai. about AMICE-l4 is that ke is mature *
far beyond his years. He has packed a lot of living into 27 years. He
has been a revolutionary since his late teens and so much 07 his life
has been occupied with clandestine activity of some sort thar it is
really the only “trade” he knows. -(Although CE-14 t admit it
except to himself in his weaker moments, it may be « ossible
for him ever to settle down to any kind of normal lite). ny of those
young Cubans who have been fighting first Batista and then Castro with
an honest zeal and dedication are either dead or serving long prison sen—
tences. Few who have been as active as he are still alive or free, What has



] hen BA
i : fas)

Pee ‘SECRET aun

volved, in an active capacity, in the =
reluctant to leave the WAVE area and to cease active
operations agaizst Castro as long as his services are needed. He
has said that he always intended to complete his education sone

day but that his own and his fanily's future will have to wait un-
Til Fidel is ousted. With his past experience in student activities
and clancestine operations, he cozid be invaluable in the right
Latin American university. However, ke iatends to think of student
activities as child's play compared to the NHAPRON objectives of

the AXTRUNK project. It is still problematical whether or not he
will accept this proposal. - 2

8. ANICE-14 speaks adequate English for operational purposes
and for social. conversation. He understands idiomatic English with
little difficulty. - His written English is poor but both his written
and spoken facility with the language could be improved with some
tutorial training. He wants to speak proper English and he tries
his best to phrase his sentences grazatically but he, at least in
recent years, is hampered by a lack of formal education in English.
While he conbined both P/A and Tean Leader functions for the

TRUNK tean, his case officer did not press hin to provide written
reports. His reports were given verbally to his case officer who
would then prepare-them in English. He has since been given the
use of a typewriter--he had taken a course in typewriting--and his
first report (in Spanish) appears to be thorough and comprehensive.
There is reason why he cannot be developed into a good reporter
because he is very observant and is a keen student of human nature.
He will probably have to be prodded to continue to write but he
has not yet objected to it.

9. In summary, AMICE-14 would be ideal for anti-Communist
student activities in Latin Amcrica--if he wants to give it a try.
This is still only a goal for the i: diate futuroe--he cannot be
a student all his life. The biggest challenge is to find a way to
continue to utilize his talents. It all depends on the Cuban
situation. If Fidelis. ousted, there is an excelle: possibility
that some day ANICE-14 may well be a very influential person in a
free Cuban governzent. If the situasion in Cuba remains status quo
and if a way can de found to “interna-ioialize" his thinking
against Communism as a world menace rather than as the more localized
personal cancer that Cuban Coumuniss represents to hin at present,
he could continue to be of immense value to KUBARK in other Spanish-

speaking areas for many years.
