BRIEFING PAPER ON THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC

I. Situation

Following the break in diplomatic relations in August 1960

U.S. Dominican relations have worsened steadily, and the anti-t. S. sentiment

of the GODR was brought sharply into focus by the appearance of pickets

outside our consulate on 5 January in protest against the OAS vote to

extend trade sanctions against the Dominican Republic. The pickets

Sat the in protest

bore signs condemning the interventionist policy of the U. S. and calling

for the expulsion of Consul General Dearborn, whom they labeled a spy.

The Dominican radio and press continued to censure President Eisenhower

as being responsible for the present state of affairs, while maintaining

a reserve concerning President Kennedy, apparently adopting a "wait and see"

attitude, although it has previously expressed some reservations regarding

the President's choice of advisers on Latin America.

On 26 January the GODR ordered the expulsion of U. S. Vice Consul

James A. McNamara on the ground that he was making derogatory remarks

about the country; however, it is probable that this expulsion was in

retaliation and anger over

the belief that the U. S. had provided information

to Venezuela on Trujillo's efforts to overthrow or assassinate President

Batencourt.

It is thought by some informed observers that the outcome of the

sugar legislation which comes up for renewal in the U. S. Congress in

March 1961 will be all important to the future of U. S./Dominican relations.

Some say that the Trujillo government cannot last another six months if

they do not get their share of the Cuban windfall sugar; and rumors are

3. 1o the 4 they are

circulating in Ciudad Trujillo that if they are deprived of the windfall

the GODR plans to expropriate American properties and terminate U. S.

consular relations.

III Conclusions

(1) In many respects initial talks with FCR and VRD leaders

reveal that they over-estimate their own capabilities. Neither has an

immediate capability to introduce arms into the area or a firm plan of action.

(2)

elements but within the ranks of the Trujillo clique itself.

within the middle class express fears of eventual liquidation of that

class by the dictator and his son Pamfis, it 1s not likely that Trujillo

will move until he lears of the outcome in late March 1961 of congressional

action on the windfall sugar quota.

If such action is favorable to

Trujillo, it is probable that he will continue to rule uneasily for an

indafinite period unless material outside pressure is brought to bear

against him. If, however, his windfall is taken from him, it is the

firm opinion of this Division that a violent reaction on his part will

shortly thereafter be felt which will end either with the liquidation of

Trujillo and his cohorts or with a complete roll-up of the internal opposition.
