RESEARCH CONDUCTED AT FRANKLIN D.
ROOSEVELT LIBRARY, HYDE PARK, NY.
ON 3/10-12/75 5

Sry - On 3/10/74, Mr. DONALD B, SCHEWE, Assistant
"Librarian in the Reference Archives, Franklin D. Roosevelt
. ,Library, Hyde Park, NY, was advised of our interest in
- | locating any communications be@ring upon a conversation
- between former President FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT. and former
“Secretary of State CORDELL HULL in the latter part of
August, 1936. Mr. SCHEWE was advised that this conversation
“was concerned with the security of the US and that Mr. J.
EDGAR HOOVER of the FBI may have participated in this
_' (conversation. Mr. SCHEWE was also advised that Mr.’ ROOSEVELT
-. allegedly reduced the subject matter of above conversation
: ‘toa memorandum and that we were interested in locating -
this memorandum or some information bearing upon above 7
conversation. Arrangements were made to meet with Mr. SCHEWE
.&t the Franklin D, Roosevelt Library in Hyde Park, NY,” if
on 3/12/75. Mr. SCHEWE indicated that in the meantime :
he would conduct some research in this matter.

: . On 3/12/75, Mr. SCHEWE advised that he had
conducted some research relative to our telepnone call
on 3/10/75, and inquired if we could be more specific
with regard to the dates of the information desired.

SCHEWE was advised that to the best of our knowledge the
conversation we were interested in involving FRANKLIN D,

ROOSEVELT (FDR),HULL and Mr. HOOVER, occurred on : :
approximately 8/24-26/36 and that the conversation concerned

the internal security of the US. iauael Paaeeel

Poesenee Mr. SCHEWE, at-this point, furnished a Xerox
copy of a “buck slip" datee 8/24/36, (copy of whichis =.
attached) on White House stationery, classified "Confidential _
and addressed to the Secretary of State from FDR", - cece

_ Mr. SCHEWE stated that "buck slips" are nothing more
‘than e cover memorandum utilized to transmit communications

‘which are attached thereto. It is to be noted that this

_-"buck slip" indicates that attached to it was a memorandum

' for the Secretary of State, unsigned, undated and

_ recommending coordination of activities of all agents’

. of the Government in foreign countries. SCHEWE advised

a Docld:32989628 Page 10



that the synopsis of this memorandum which< cappears ¢ on-
¢ne "buck slip" was the usual practice at that time to
adentify the documents attached to it. SCHEWE added.
that this was the only document he was able to locate -
which may-have some bearing on the desired information.
SCHEWE stated that the possibility exists that the.

referred to memorandum may be located among the collection

of papers of CORDELL HULL which are now stored nia the
Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. Sean Ane

Mr. SCHEWE then exhibited to interviewing perseanes

the White House Ushers Appointment Book which was
hand-written and kept on a daily basis. This appointment
pook contained the following pertinent information:

Thursday, August 13, 1936, at 9:50 AM

-FDR departed the White House for a visit ©

., to the flood areas in Ny, Ohio and ieee
. | Wania.

Thursday, August ak, 11936, FDR returned:
to White House at aru 5 AM,
Pee O AM FDR met with Mr. HOOVER fron :
"+ 9220 AM to 10:12 AM. ; AT

(Note * - There is no entry in ‘this book
-1 ic for Aug. 24, 1936, indicating that Mr.
ayeaueeeuel . HULL was there. Mr. SCHEWE advised that
tee ., At.is interesting to note that. FDR met
- Mr. HOOVER in his residence in the White
House on 8/24/36, prior to leaving for
7 his office in the White House. SCHEWE
- °° also pointed out: that this meeting was
. significant since FDR. met with Mr. HOOVER
on 8/24/36, immediately after returning ~~
from an extended trip. This, according
. to SCHEWE was a departure from FDR's
usual practice.

: There was no record in the White House -
Usher's Appointment Book for 8/25/36, which would indicate
that FDR met with either Mr. HULL or Mr. HOOVER on that
date, This book indicates that FDR departed the White ~
House on Tuesday, 8/25/75, at 10:40 PM for a trip to the’
draught areas, in upper. Maine, South Dakota and North :

- further reflects thet FDR, during the period July 10,
1936, to Aug. 10, 1936, was away from the White House
campaigning. FDR returned to the White House on

. 8/10/35, and remained there until 8/13/36, when he
again departed on a trip and returned on 8/24/36.

personnel the appointment book of FDRis private secretary, |
_ GRACE TULLY for the pertinent period. This appointment book

. MR. CALLAHAN pare: (2/7/75, Say cine

Files & Com, —
Gon. Inv.

On 2/6/75 Mr. Kelley and I met with Senator Church
and Bill Miller, Staff Director of the Senate Select Committee,
Senator Church pointed out that he intended to run the Committee i
avery responsible manner, had no intention of destroying or impairing
the effectiveness of the intelligence community and, in fact, hoped that
the efforts of the Committee would help to reestablish public confidence
in the intelligence agencies.

Parameters have not been drawn but Senator Church feels that _ {
the Committee will confine its activities largely to inquiries into domestic * ;!
activities. The inquiries will be designed to determine whether agencies *

have acted outside the law and the type of remedial legislation necessary ee

to prevent such abuses in the future.

Study will be largely concerned with the activities of the Central
Intelligence Agency but will, of course, involve the FBI and other agencies
involved in domestic ‘intelligence.

The Committee hopes to have a nonpartisan staff of approximately
40 employees headed up by Mr. Miller and would appreciate having necessary
background investigations expedited to permit an early clearance, Miller
indicated he has already been in touch with Mr. Hotis and Mr. Bowers in
this regard. It was explained that the contemplated procedure involved the
FBI conducting the full-field investigation necessary with the results being
furnished to the Chairman, after which he would, upon being personally
satisfied as to their loyalty, furnish the results to CIA for final clearance.
Senator Church appeared satisfied with this arrangement. He stated that
he wanted to prevent leaks and be hopefully as successful as the Judiciary
Committee was on the impeachment inguiry. Our experience in this regard
was pointed out wher¢in Judiciary Committee in come with the 17
wiretaps had written ed dsgor uaa trae cee if.we wee paca oS a if

Memorandum for Mr. Callahan
Re: SENSTUDY 1975

information available they would afford it appropriate security restricted
to members only, excluding staff, and would not make the information
public. Subsequent to the hearings, the Committee published its report
which contained our classified documents right along with the Top Secret
classifications. Senator Church was not aware of this, appeared surprised
by it, and stated surely the information must have been declassified. I
advised him that not by us and it was our information.

Senator Church was asked whether in his opinion the formation
of the Select Committee would have any effect on the proliferation of
committees seeking to obtain testimony from the FBI and it was his opinion
that this would have a favorable effect. He said he had been in touch with
other members of the Senate who felt that it was a waste of time to have
repetitious testimony on the same subject matter before a variety of
committees and he had the feeling that the other committees would hold off
until after the Senate Select Committee completed its hearings. He indicated
that he could not vouch for what would happen in the House, however, he
intended to speak to the House leadership in order to try to effect some
coordinated approach there also, because he was well aware of the large
number of committees seeking to provide oversight or obtain information
from the intelligence agencies. :

A question arose as to the extent. of cooperation with the Committee
and Senator Church was assured that the FBI would be completely responsive
subject to certain limitations which would have to be delineated by the
President in order to protect sensitive sources and information. Senator
Church indicated that he was going to talk to the President in this regard in
order to secure his complete cooperation, and it was Senator Church's feeling
that the Committee should be entitled to answers to any questions they might
ask without restriction other than, of course, the identities of informants.

He felt the progress of the Committee would be severely impaired if it were
necessary to go to Court over such questions to obtain enforcement of their
right to have access to whatever information they need.

ACTION:

MEMORANDUM FOR: USIB Principals ~

SUBJECT: Community Aspects of Inputs to Congressional
Committees Investigating Intelligence

J

1. The Intelligence Community Staff, with John M. Clarke,

Associate Deputy/IC, as my representative in these matters, will

keep the Board and other appropriate officials advised as to

progress of the investigations conducted by the Senate and House
- Select Committees investigating intelligence activities. In particular, ©
it will ensure that we are kept informed as to materials which are
formally being provided to the Select Committees by all elements
of the Community. The USIB Ad Hoc Group will assist on this
matter and provide the mechanism for regular and constant communi-
cations. :

2. In response to this assignment, the Intelligence Community
Staff is establishing a registry for documentation relating to the
investigations. This registry will be a source of reference of all
responses, testimony, et cetera,’ provided by USIB agencies and
available to your designated representatives.

3. In order to make the registry useful to the Board, it is
” essential that it include:

a. File copies of documents or other materials which
each Intelligence Community element provides to one of the
Select Committees where the originating agency considers
the materials to involve aspects of Community activities,
and/or which may result in follow-on queries concer. ing:.- +
the functioning’ of the’ orhmunity. The availability °
documentation will he 6 importance if itis
expected theré will be sabscquent inquiries relating ‘to the |
materials provided and involving clements of the Community
other than the originating clement.

THE DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE

WASHINGTON, D. C. 20505

Intelligence Community Staff

Mr. L. Frank Schwartz

Federal Bureau of Investigation
Room 4637

J. Edgar Hoover Building
Washington, D. C.

Dear Frank:

Reference is your request for comments on the sample
abstracts prepared in the FBI as a report on materials being
provided to the Senate Select Committee.

As you know, we want to make the Community Registry as
complete a record as possible of what is provided to the
Committee, and_for_ this reason hope that the actual copy of
special reports and tant documents wilt be
pro e' Oo the Registry, Where this is no one, an abstract
or-summiary” Of each document or homogenous set of documents.

We have amended the abstract format slightly to include
an entry for "Document Classification." A copy of the
amended format is enclosed.

Your sample abstracts require a few alterations to make
them more "indexable."

a. Item 1, "TITLE/SUBJECT" refers to the subject
matter of the material which is being provided. The
abstract on the FBI Manual of Instructions should have
an entry here something like "Instructions covering FBI
Investigations in the Security Field," rather than the
title of the Senate Committee.

b. The date at the head of the page should be
the date of preparation of the abstract. The date of
submission to the Committee is listed at Item 9.

ce. The entry "ORIGINATING ORGANIZATION" identified
the organization with authority to release the document.

(ERCLOSURG



that

da. The "SUMMARY OF CONTENTS" section should
be brief, but also should clearly indicate what is
being provided to the Committee. I wonder, for
instance, whether your sample on the letterhead
memoranda was issued in widely separated time periods.
The summary as written gives no indication as to +
the particular subject of any of the memoranda and the
single sentence now used to describe all of them covers
the waterfront.

e. If the request for information comes officially
from the Committee, the Committee title should be entered
under "REQUESTOR," but if the requestor is an individual
member of the Staff, his name should be indicated.

f. The last entry in the format, "PROBLEM AREAS,"
has particular significance since it is important to
know if there are Third Agency, or sources and methods,
or other sensitivity problems involved, and this is
the place to identify them. We are beginning to use
the abstracts prepared in our office as an aid to
obtaining release clearance when we are dealing with
the document for which another agency must concur in
the release. The "PROBLEM AREAS" section gives such
other agency an idea as to whether we see any important
reason why they should be concerned about release of
the document. The entry in this final section of the
format is expected to prove useful for this purpose.

5. One copy of the document or its abstract is all
is needed by the registry.

6. The mailing address of the registry is:

SUBJECTMICROPHONE SURVEILLA ANCE

fhe recent decision of the Supreme Court entitled Irvine v.

Y police in a gentling case makes appropriate a reappraisal of

the use which ney be made in the future by the Federal Bureau of

gation of microphone surveillance in connection with matters -

is clear that in some instances the use of microphone

evidence for ‘proseow tions he FBT has an intelligence function in
connection with intemal si matters equally as important as
the cxty of developing evidence for presentation to the courts and
the national security requires that the FBI be able to use microphone
‘surveilla suid for the proper discharge of both of such functions.

The Department of Justice approves the use of microphone surveillance
_ by the PBF under these circumstences and for these purposes.

EF do not consider that the decision of the Supreme Court
in Irvine v. Califomia, supra, requires a different course. That
case is readily distinguishable on its facts. The language of the
Court, however, indicates certain uses of microphones which it would
be well to avoid, if possible, even in internal security investiga-
tions. It is quite clear that in the Irvine case the Justices of the
Supreme Court were outraged by what they regarded as the indecency of
installing 4 microphone in a bedroom. They denounced the utilization
of such methods of investigation in a gambling case as shocking. The 7
Court's action is a clear indication of the need for discretion and
intelligent restraint in the use of microphones by the FBI in all
peers including internal security matters. Obviously, the installa-
ion of a microohone in-a bedroom or in some comparably intimate
Location should be avoided waerever possible. It mey appear, however,
that important intelligence or evidence relating to mats connected
with the natione). security cen only be obtained by 4 “Wnstilation of

Previous interpretations which-have been furnished to you
as to what may constitute trespass in the instellation of microphones,

- Suggest that the views expressed have been tentative in nature and
have attempted to predict the course which courts would follow
rather than reflect the present state of the law. It is realized
that not infrequently the question of trespass arises in connection
with the installation of a microphone. The question of whether a
trespass is actually involved end the second question of the effect
of such a trespass upon the admissibility in court of the evidence thus
obtained, must necessarily be resolved according to the circumstances
of each case. The Devartment in resolving the problems which may arise
in connection with the use of microphone surveillence will review the
circumstances in each case in the light of the practical necessities
of investigation and of the natimal interest which must be protected.
It is my opinion that the Department should adopt that interpretation
which will permit microphone covdrage by the FBI in a manner most
conducive to our national interest. JF recognize that for the FBI
to fulfill its importent intelligence function, considerations of
internal security and the national safety are paramoumt and, there-
fore, may compel the tmrestricied use of tis techiigue in the netionel- :

ADDENDUM: Intelligence Division, WOC:aso, 4/4/75

The Intelligence Division has reviewed the attached figures
prepared by the Administrative Division. Under the criteria of the current
Classification Act it would be impossible to justify classification of these
figures; however, should they be made public or fall into the hands of a
hostile foreign intelligence service, it would reveal the current capability
the FBI employs in the field of counterintelligence against the total foreign
threat. In view of the above, the Intelligence Division strongly recommends
that the Legal Counsel Division discuss this with the staff of the Senate
Select Committee pointing out the vulnerability implicit in this attachment
in an effort to have the Committee withdraw its request identified as IIT C,

ADDENDUM: LEGAL COUNSEL DIVISION pyp:akily“4-14-75

Regarding the observations of the Intelligence Division
concerning the making available the amount of manpower dedicated to
counterintelligence and domestic intelligence work in the FBI, the
Legal Counsel Division has the following observations:

(1) Based on our analysis and conversations this
‘Division has had with Fred B. Griffith of the Inspection Division, it
(appears that the information contained in this memorandum may be
classified confidential under Executive order 11652.

(2) Before making any determination as to whether we
make such information available to the Senate Select Committee, it
would appear we should determine from CIA what their response to
such a request will be so that our position and that of CIA will be
consistent in this area. In this regard SA Paul V. Daly has contacted
Leon F. Schwartz, Liaison Section of Intelligence Division, and requested
he determine from CIA what their position in this regard is.

(3) It is not believed that we should take a hard and fast
position that this information not be made available to the Committee or
that we make an effort to have the Committee withdraw their request for
this information. We should rather develop some fallback position such
as that this information will be made available to the Chairman of the
Committee or will be made available during an oral briefing, etc.

On 4/11/75, from 10:00 am until 12:20 pm, piece
members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence
Activities were briefed by Assistant Director Wannall and
members of his staff in the Conference Room at INID, Briefe
from the Committee were Mr, William Miller, Staff Director;
Mr, Frederick A, 0, Schwarz III, Chief Counsel; and
Messrs, Mark Gitenstein, Marvin Epstein, Patrick Shea, Britt F
Snider and Loch Johnson, ail staff members,

The first hour of the briefing was occupied with Al
the showing of the INTD slide presentation and commentary
which provided highlights of the work of the INTD, both in
the counterintelligence and internal security field, Following
this presentation a question and answer period ensued for the
rest of the briefing, Mr, Miller and Mr, Schwarz posed most
of the questions,

In the dounterintelligence field the thrust of the
questioning was directed toward the continuing growth of the
hostile intelligence presence in the United States and its
short-term and long-term effect on the FBI's operations,

Mr, Wannall pointed out that the Director on previous occasions
had indicated his intention to "beef up" the counterintelligence
effort of the FBI by the addition of some 250 Special Agents,
and that INTD had also effected certain programs designed to
assign certain counterintelligence functions to non-Agent
personnel, thereby freeing additional Special Agents to function
as case officers, In response to a question’ as to whether the
additional investigative effort necessary to counter the
mounting hostile intelligence threat might not involve investi~ _,
gation of more and more American citizens, as Wannall ee

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannail
Re: Senstudy 75
Briefing for Staff Members
by Intelligence Division
April ll, 1975

hat this was inevitable, He stressed, however, the investi-
ative policies of the FBI which protected the constitutional
ights and right of privacy of such individuals,
On the domestic internal security side the thrust
of the questioning appeared to indicate an interest in the
predication, duration and administrative controls of investi-
gations of domestic organizations and individuals, Again,
Mr, Wannall stressed the precautions inherent in FBI policy
and instructions to the field in these matters, pointing out,
in effect, that these investigations are founded on statutory
authority and are closely supervised by experienced personnel
at Headquarters level, The Committee staff appeared to accept
these answers and no critical or hostile attitudes on their
part were evident,

The briefing was terminated at 12:20 pm, due to
commitments on the part of the staff, Mr, Miller and
Mr, Schwarz both expressed their appreciation for the briefing
and indicated it had been most instructive, They indicated
a desire to continue these discussions at some later date and
Mr, Wannall assured them that he would be happy to continue
the briefing at any future mutually agreeable time,

Perhaps most Significant of all questions posed was

the final question by Mr, Schwarz in which he inquired as to

what advantages and disadvantages to the FBI could be anticipated
| as a result of the Committee fulfilling its mandate, Mr, Wannall
replied that any statutory authority defining and affirming the
FBI's role in the intelligence collection field would certainly
be a poSitive achievement, He also stated that any result of
the Committee's investigation which would tend to limit the
investigative resources or the investigative effectiveness of
the FBI would surely be an unfortunate negative factor,

Director Sec'y

At 3:17 p.m., 4/22/75 former Special Agent Lish Whitson
who for many years was a supervisor in the Intelligence Division
telephoned me to advise that he had received a request to appear
for an interview by Michael Epstein, staff member of the Senate
Select Committee. The interview was scheduled for 4/23/75.

In response to a question by Mr. Whitson, he was advised
that to the writer's knowledge this was the first former Bureau
employee who had been requested to appear for an interview by any
member of the staff of the Select Committee, Whitson stated that
he was proceeding on the basis that he would respond to questions
propounded to him but he had some reservation in his mind concerning
answering questions which would involve material which he knew to be
classified at the time he retired. He commented he had noted in the
news media that staff members of the Committee were reportedly to be }
granted clearances through TOP SECRET - Q (Atomic Energy Matters).

Whitson was advised by the writer that while it was true

staff members were being granted clearances, the Bureau was endeavoring
to establish procedures through the Attorney General whereby highly
sensitive and classified material could he revealed on a restricted
basis in response to Committee inquiries; for example, in some
instances we would request that only the Majority and Minority leaders
on the Committee be furnished certain types of material and in other
instances only the Senators themselves as opposed to a eee a

Cs,

Mr. Whitson said in view of € 380 it a nis OC ehdox

as responsive and candid during the interview by Mr. Epstein as he

could be but if any questions arose in his mind with respect to

revelation as to what he, Whitson, considered to be sensitive material,

he anticipated he would express his concern to Mr. Epstein and advise

him he felt it would be appropriate to check with the Bvaiaddlesiene

revealing FBI information without the Attorney General'g Sppe dH. 7s

. i - You requested analysis of tl the legal authority for FBI
: criminal intelligence collection and its” ee to our statutory
ve jurisdiction in criminal matters. :
"The gathering of criminal ‘intelligence information"
describes activity not subject to precise definition, However, its
general objective is well understood by those engaged in law enforcement.
There exist individuals and groups whose daily occupations are directed
toward profit without regard to the restraints of the iaw. Yet, by the
very nature of their associations. little actual participation in criminal
acts may be cbserved & by the most astute law enforcement observer.
Their existence and contribution to the sum of criminal behavior, has
detected and to some degree measured by the collection of data concern
their personal ife-styles, property holdings, associates, influence, and
“access to capital. Such infor mation has been characterized as "criminal
intelligence."" . s

For years, the FBI has been aware of the need to identify
these resources of the criminal.element. Congress responded to this
need through the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970. The Congressionz
findings were that organized crime in the United States is a hig nly
sophisticated, div ersified, and widespread activity | that annually drains
billions of dollars from America's economy by unlawful conduct and by
the illegal use of force, fraud and corruption. Legitimate business and
labor wnions.are infiltrated and corrupted and our’ democratic processes
are subverted. The problem was declared to be .of of national concern
both as to our economy and the domestic security.

The Act attempted to attack organized crime by making
criminal the management of syndicated gambling and by prohibiting
rackctecring activity characteristic of organized crime including the
use of illecal proceeds for investment in legitimate business enterprises,

The long-established suspicions of law enforcement officers
did not eliminate the conduct described as evil therein, There remains

menace and developing prosecutable evidence of their guilt. ‘Criminal
intelligence" collection is one means by which this responsibility may

be fulfilled. It may be the only practical means in view of the scarcity

of witnesses willing to testify and of the high mortality potential of those
who do appear. A classic ome of such intimidation is reported in

interpreted as drawing a distinction between collection of intelligence
information where political or social factors are involved and First

il Amendment freedoms therefore may be directly inhibited and collection

of criminal intelligence information where the objective is the establishment
of criminal conduct and the identities of the offenders. While the Fourth
and Fifth Amendment may be enjoyed by the. guilty and innocent alike, it

is improbable that the First Amendment would be stretched so far as to
protect freedom of speech and assembly when such speech and assembly
‘constitute eléments of a criminal offense, On appeal, the Supreme Court
of New Jersey returned’the case for further development of the record

INTELLIGENCE MATTERS : : : .

And unlike the practice in criminal cases, our clectronic surveillances in
security matters are not submitted for prior court approval, For another,
the exclusionary rule which provides the usual method of judicial control
over investigative procedures, is not often available in security cases.
Since the goal.is largely preventive, these cases seldom come before the
courts, As a result, the public, the courts, and the Congress have very
little information about how we operate in domestic intelligence matters.
and what we do with the information acquired,

: In response to this situation, some members of the Congress have

pressured for tighter controls over the Bureau, perhaps in the form of a

_ watchdog committee to oversee our operations. Senator Ervin, who chairs
the Senate Subsommittee on Constitutional Rights has expressed particular
concern about the right of privacy and the authority of the Government io
gather information, In an exchange of correspondence with the Department
of Justice, the Senator has requested specific documentation of the
Department's guidelines for the gathering and retention of domestic
intelligence information. He has also suggested that legisiation mighi ve
enacted, requiring a showing of probable cause before an investigation can
be initiated by the Government. It is doubtful that any such measure would

a _ pass the Congress, -but the proposal does show the mood of the times.

_ Aparalicl trend may be developing in the courts. In several
recent cases, plaintiffs have made the-claim that Government information
gathering, which goes beyond the effort to apprehend criminal suspecis,
may have a "chilling cffect’’ on the exercise of First Amendment rights,

: 5 These challenges thus far have not been successful, Anderson v, Sills,
56 N.d. 210, 265 A2d 678 (1970); Donahoe v. Duling, 330 F. Supp. 308
(E.D. Va. 1971); American Civil Libertics Union v. Westmoreland, 323
F. Supp. 1153 W.DS TL 197i).

The courts have generally recognized that one of the principal
functions of the Bureau is to gather information law violators, agitators of
violence and possible subversives., Tatum _v, Laird, 444 Fad 947, 957

_ to First Amendment*rights. Thus, in Davis v, Ichord, 442 F2d 1207 (D.C.
. Cir, 1970) although appellants allegedly felt chilled by a Congressional
Committce's investigation of them, the Court of Appeals found there was
insufficient justiciability in their claims to create a viable case or
- controversy. This was because appellants had "failed to bring the fear of
investigation by the present Committee home to themselves," their foars
a were wholly speculative; there were ng criminal’proceedings contronting
them; nor was any action pending. Moreover, the Court in Davis found
7 that the power of a Congressional Committee began and ended with the
investigation; whenever a Committee of the Congress seeks punitive action,
the Judiciary must become involved, and thus every investigation has a
judicial check which operates to guarantee the protection of constitutional
rights, a

This latter aspect of the Davis decision was piven perspective by
the Court of Appeals in,Tatum, In contrasting the potential impact on First
Amendment rights cecasioned by investigations conducted by the military
with investigations conducted by a civilian investigative agency, such as the

-. Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Court observed:

FeSNaSERESETASEEGA + The compilation of data by a civilian investigative
{pessdesee tat festiscertaetics agency is thus not the threat to civil liberties or the

| i . of free speech that such action by the military is, because
: : a civil investigative agency has no inherent power always
being subject to the well-defined restrictions of law and -
the approval of the courts. * * *

There, the Court pdntedly examined the "source of the chill" as it had in

as a source which does not generate a reasonable basis for aa or
apprehensions, In this connection the Court stated,

RE: FBI AUTHORITY IN DOMESTIC

Referring to our holding in Davis that the
“sourge of the chill" is important in determining whether
there is any inhibiting effect on the exercise of First
Amendment rights, we think that there is a significant
difference between investigative actions taken by a
military agency in reference to civilians and similar
investigative actions taken by a regular investigative
agency of a civilian branch of the Government,

As’ to the surveillance of public meetings through the use of
‘Ynformants, it has been held that such surveillance is not per se actionable,
See Donahoe v. Duling, 330 F, Supp, 308 (E.D, Va, 1971) (police
surveillance of street demonstrations held not to offend First Amendment
rights),

The Supreme Court in Hoffa v. U.S,, 385 U.S, 293 (1966), held
that the use of secret informants is “not py unconstitutional", and does
not violate the Fifth Amendment privilege against self~inerimination, nor
the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches and
seizures. The Court upheld, as reasonable under the Fourth Amendment,
admission at trial of evidence obained by an undercover informant to whom
a defendant spoke without knowledge that he was in the employ of the police.

Moreover, the Supreme Court in U.S, v. White, 401 U.S, '745

(1971), recently held’that the use of secret informants does not violate

any constitutionally justifiable expectation of privacy under the Fourth

Amendment, even when an informant uses electronic equipment to transmit

his conversations with defendants to other agents,

if the use of undercover government informants without | a
warrant does not violate the Fourth Amendment and invade a defendant's
constitutionally justifiable expectations of privacy, Hoffa v. U.S., supra,
and such informants may write down their conversations with defendants
and testify concerning them, or simultaneously record and transmit such
conversations to otters, who may testify against them, On Lee v. U.S.,
848 U.S. 747 (1952); U. v. White, supra, then clearly : meré
Neurveillanco" of plai n plain view by informants at public meet

would not violate their constitutional rights, 7 REEee on

It would seem that those who elect to present their views actively
in the public arena deliberately expose themselves to the public. See
Associated Press v. Walker, 388 U.S. 130 (1967). Any. recording of their
activities by the defendants does not invade their privacy any more than

"+ does a newspaper, radio, or television story, and,- indeed, much less since

any information compiled is usable and effective only through court action,
Tatum v, Laird, 444 F2d 947, 957 (D.C. Cir. 1971).

More difficult questions are presented where the investigation
delves into the private affairs of the individuals or organizations. But
even here, the courts have generally sustained our procedures so long as

they comport with the restrictions of the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Amendments]

In summary, if is premature to say that the First Amendment
line of cases, dealing with the "chilling" concept offers any substantial

* impediment to our intelligence investigations. There is less reason for
optimism, however, with regard to congressional intervention. We

Espionage and Foreign Intelligence Investigations

The mission of the FBI in the foreign Antelligence

ficld is one of counter intelligence, The objectives and

priorities of counterintelligcnce have been variousiy stated

bVi65360_Docld:32989628 Page 92

and evaluated, Generally, these objectives may be listed in

declining priority as follows: (1) the detection and



‘Sdentitication of intelligence opérations and agents;

(2) the penetration of these operations for the purpose

of goptrol and the development of intelligence information;
(8) neutralization of hostile intelligence operations through

CLO; and, {4) prosecution. Whatever

disruption and disinform:

the assigned priority, the overall objective is to deny access

to information sought by whatever practical means are available,

Foroign intelligence investigations aré grounded in
the Espionage statute and related Lays ineluding the Registra-

tion and Atomic Energy Acts. Individual investigations are

initiated usually on the ¢t is of a known ox suspected connece

tion With x foreign intelligence

uvice, foreign country or

subversive organization with such connections. Since these

investigations emanate fr various cens itive sources and.

involve special considerations, extensive criteria and

imitations are defined

enumerated in current instructions
In general terns, the governing criteria are designed

to preclude initiation and ceontinunncs of investigations which

are not justified. The 1itations are designed to control
the scope of investigation in order to “insure security of our

interests through close supervisory serutiny.

Restwictions on Investigations

: PBI guidelines go beyond the rules for opening,
Feces rere and closing cases; they also impose restrictions-
to make certain that we do not violate the constitutional
rights of any individual and to preclude investigations from

bheconing "fishing expeditions."

In the security field these

are some of the restrictions:

“echiace applied:

a ci ‘ Security cases are evaluated.continually
: to determine if we are fulfilling our
responsibilities. Those cases not
warranting further eee are
closed promptly.

There are no investigations of mempers

. Fersons arrested during disruptive demonstra=
“+. tious are identified since circumstances of
an arrest, in some cases, may indicate a
propensity for violence. However, a mere
arrest in connection with a demonstration is 7
an insufficient basis in itself for security
investigation. The arrest must be coupled
with a demonstrated propensity for violence
or with subversive or revolutionary activity
on the part of the individ qual arrested.

Yhen it is determinedc: that a security subject
is a member of the armed services, the
investigation is discontinued immediately and
the military advised.

position and in August, 1972, a detailed report was furnished to him. The
following is a surmmery of that report.

Over a period of several inonths there were a number of public

A major thrust of Professur Bliff's paper concerned FBI authority
derived from levislative enactments ag opposed to that derived from Prosidential
directives, beginning with a directive issued by Prosident Roosevelt in
September, 1939, Professor Eliif is of the opinion thet the 1939 directive,
which was reiterated on three subsequent occasions, was megnified by the
FHI from its original purpose to & detinitive order to conduct intelligence-type
investigations.

Senator Sam J. Ervin, as you know, had been prebing inte the
native and extent of FM intellgenco-type investigations, Senator Ervin had
even announced that he intended to propcse islation to prohibit the sbi
from investigating any pe sut that individusi's convent, unicss the
paason to believe that person hss committed a crime or is

about to ecommit a crim: Other Congressmen indicated a similar inicrsst
_in FU investigative activities.

Our study revealed th:
long period of Lime that iia resps
ized under logislative
instructiong of the Atturnoy Genora !
the 1) directive dated September 6, 1935, and veiterated Sanne 8, 1943
duly 24, 1968; and December 15, 1953, and 2) Executive Order 10486 ¢

* April 27, 1953 (and amended but not yet implomented by Executive Ordor
11605 dated July 2, 1971).

‘Che Pres:

In carefully analyzing the language of the first directive, dated
September 6, 1939, considering that ihe subsequent dircetives cre all
hinged on that one, we believe that there is a misconcepiion as to the oxtent
of jurisdiction or authority conveyed to the Fi3l by these directives. ft
appears that while the 1939 directive fixed responsibility on the FUL to handle
espionage, sadotege, ond neutvality matters, it did not convey any authority
or jurisdiction which the Fl did not already have fror lerislative co
It ds difficult to read into this directive or in any of those which followed any
pathority to conduct inielligence-typo investi¢ations which would or could
not be conducted under an umbrella of legislative enactments.

ADDENDUM: Intelligence Division, WOC:aso, 4/4/75

The Intelligence Division has reviewed the attached figures

~ prepared by the Administrative Division. Under the criteria of the current
Classification Act it would be impossible to justify classification of these
figures; however, should they be made public or fall into the hands of a
hostile foreign intelligence service, it would reveal the current capability
the FBI employs in the field of counterintelligence against the total foreign
threat. In view of the above, the Intelligence Division strongly recommends
that the Legal Counsel Division discuss this with the staff of the Senate

In connection with our investigations of staff members for ot

| LaVoy whose sister-in-law questioned her loyalty and declared she "does not
love America,"' The sister-in-law said Mrs. LaVoy constantly criticized the
U. S. Government and its policy and underlying weaknesses of our society.
Another individual said she was highly critical of CIA activities. This information
was pointed out to Miller on 3-25-75 when the results of the investigation were i
delivered to him, and he also was advised that the CIA would be furnished the sam:
data in accordance with our agreement concerning these matters. 4g
On 3-24-75 and 3-28-75 results of the investigation concéening
Mrs. Betty Dale Ellison were delivered to Miller and he was advised that a pri
supervisor with eight years of training and experience in psychiatric care stat
he felt Mrs. Ellison needs psychological examination. He termed her a troubl
maker and said he would have fired her if he had the authority. He described
her definitely as a security risk due to her mental and emotional instability. I
also was pointed, out to Miller that other former supervisors described her as
unstable when working under pressure and unable to get along with fellow empldyees.
Miller was told that this information also would be furnished to CIA.

RE: SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE
ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

Miller also advised on 4-2-5 that their review of the Ellison
investigation showed justifiable concern for her being cleared for the staff, and
he asked for any guidance we might give him. It was pointed out that the only
real solution to the situation seemed to be that she not be added to the staff.
Miller said he would appreciate any comments from the CIA also in this regard.
This request was conveyed to CIA by Section Chief William Cregar of the .
Intelligence Division who subsequently advised that Charles Kane, Director of
Security, CIA, had reviewed the file on Ellison and agreed there was sufficient
cause to question her suitability for assignment to the Select Committee staff.
Kane stated CIA Director Colby concurred in this observation.

‘These views were conveyed to Miller on 4-9-75. Miller stated
at that time that they had resolved the situation by assigning Mrs. Ellison to
purely administrative tasks and that she would be fully isolated from any sensitive
or classified information in connection with her responsibilities.

——. me fee

At 11:00 a.m. on April 17, 1975, Inspector John B. Hotis
Special Agent Paul V. Daly and I met with Deputy Attorney General Tyler ;
and Associate Deputy Attorney General James Hutchinson at the request f i
of the Deputy Attorney General. Me

Deputy Attorney General Tyler advised that he had been requested
by Burke Marshall and F.A.O. Schwarz, Il, who are consultant and General
Counsel, respectively, for the Senate Select Committee, to meet with
him on Monday afternoon, April 21, 1975, to discuss matters relating
to the Committee's activities. The Deputy Attorney General said that he
has been personally acquainted with Mr. Marshall for a long time and also
is acquainted with Mr. Schwarz. He considered the possibility of having
a Bureau representative attend the meeting, but then decided it would be
best if he would meet with Marshall and Schwarz privately to determine
whether they desire to discuss details of the Committee's responsibilities
and if it became necessary, he would request the Bureau to senda

representative to the meeting. pec Aa G2 _l6 3 Gs~ 14

The DeputyEaitdthey General said that he would, of course,
advise us orally or in writing of the results of his-eonference-With Mr. Marshall
and Mr. Schwarz.

The Deputy Attorney General inquired as to the procedure
currently being employed in responding to the Céiimittee's requests
and Inspector Hotis explained the current procedures. I mentioned to the
Deputy Attorney General the existence of the Ad Hoc Commiitee of
Intelligence Agencies and suggested to him that he might desire to designate
a representative to attend those meetings in order to be on notice as to the
policies being developed by the White House and the intelligence community
in responding to Committee requests. I explained to him that James

Memorandum to Mr. Adams
Re: Senate Select Committee on Intelligence

Department's representative on the Committee, but he has now been
reassigned to responsibilities at the White House. I told him that
Assistant Attorney General Scalia had been scheduled to attend the last
meeting of the Committee, although he was unable to attend. The
Deputy Attorney General said that he would discuss with Mr. Scalia
the possibility of having Mr. Scalia attend as the Department's
representative.

Iasked the Deputy Attorney General whether he was undertaking
the principal responsibility in the Department for matters relating to the
Senate Select Committee and other committees that may be inquiring
into the FBI and he said that that was not clear as yet because the Attorney
General has taken a personal interest in these matters and it appeared that
the responsibilities are still fragmented within the Department. It was
his opinion that the responsibilities should be centralized and he appeared to be
willing to undertake that responsibility.

It was my impression that the Deputy Attorney General was
interested in being of assistance to the FBI in these matters and expressed
a willingness to cooperate by having the FEI participate as much as

possible with the Deputy Attorney General. 4

This memorandum records the formal es
a task force entitled Project Senstudy 75.

The concept behind the establishment of this Proje
is to develop a capability of implementing requests received
from Select Committees of the Congress in a comprehensive and
timely fashion but yet allow the Bureau to continue to conduct
its day-to-day business in as normal a manner as possible.

We believe that by creating this facility we will be able to
meet the requirements of these Select Committees with the

substantive Divisions.

Congress. They will receive all requests and deliver all
responses to these Committees. In addition, they will meet

with the staffs of the Committees to insure the reasonableness

ambiguities requiring recontact with Committee staffs; the
assignment of research responsibilities to substantive Divisions;
following such responsibilities to insure timely responses;

as well as representing the FBI on the Executive Committee

of the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group for Congressional Review of

the Intelligence Community. Assistant Director Jolin A. Mintz is
also a member of the Executive Committee. This latter responsi-
bility will provide Cregar and Mintz with direct liaison not
only with senior officials of the intelligence community but
also with the President's counsel.

Mr. Elmer W. Larson, Unit Chief, Training Unit, IS-3
Section, Intelligence Division will act as Cregar's Number One
Man; will administer the work of the Project; and act in the
absence of Cregar.

Seymor F. Phillips, Unit Chief, Civil Disorders
Reporting Unit, IS-1 Section, Intelligence Division will serve
as the Review Coordinator for the Project. His responsibilities
will be to review all research; coordinate all responses; be
available to consult with substantive Divisions as to proper
form of our responses; identify any conflicts in FBI positions
where several Divisions are responding to a particular question;
as well as to insure the quality, completeness and adequacy
of responses to Select Committees requests. Additionally,
Phillips will be responsible for the preparation of abstracts
to be furnished to the Interagency Registry maintained at CIA
Headquarters. This Registry established by the Executive Committee
of the Ad Hoc Group at the suggestion of and with the concurrence
of the White House will serve as the coordinating mechanism
for the entire intelligence community.

Mr. Leon F. Schwartz, Liaison Officer with CIA, CI-4
Section, Intelligence Division will function as the Liaison
Officer with the intelligence community responsible for coordi-
nating and,clearing all information under the third agency rule
where FBI responses are of interest to or are of a proprietary
interest to other agencies of the intelligence community. Schwartz
will serve as the Bureau's representative on the Ad Hoc Coordinating
Group for Congressional Review of the Intelligence Community.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: Senstudy 75

Because of the White House insistence that all requests
and responses be completely coordinated and available for review
by White House representatives, it is imperative that the Project
have a self-sustained records facility to insure immediate access
to requests received from and responses furnished to the Select
Committees. In addition, in those instances where certain FBI
documents furnished to the Select Committees must be sanitized
(excised), it is imperative this records facility not only retain
copies of the sanitized documents but also copies of the original
text. For these reasons a senior clerical employee has been
requested to function as a Records Manager for the Project.

In addition to the above, there will be stenographic
and clerical personnel assigned to the Project to support the
work of the Bureau Supervisors. We have not committed any more
personnel to the Project than are absolutely necessary at the
present time. Should the requests of the Select Committees
require additional personnel, appropriate memoranda will be
submitted with a complete justification for additional personnel
assigned to the Project.

Although the physical space for the Project is
limited, all personnel connected with Project Senstudy 75
will be located in Room 4063, J. Edgar Hoover Building. This
space is physically located within the Intelligence Division.

As a matter of interest, Mr. James Wilderotter,
Associate Counsel to the President, has requested that should
any member of the intelligence community get requests from other
Committees of the Congress which impact on the intelligence
community; could be of interest to the White House;or are of such
sensitivity that coordination is required, copies of both the
requests and an abstract of the responses should be made
available to the Interagency Registry.

ACTION:.

For information and record purposes.

APRIL 11, 1975 —

As you were previously advised, William Miller, Staff Director
of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities, requested that we
provide a briefing for certain staff members of the Committee on the functions
of the Intelligence Division. He asked that the briefing cover both internal
security and foreign counterintelligence operations and that it provide a broad
overview of our investigative responsibilities.

ih ahve The Intelligence Division is prepared to offer a two-hour briefing
* beginning at 10:00 a.m. on Friday, 4-11-75. It will include a slide show to
be followed by a general discussion and an opportunity to afford questions. and
answers. After a luncheon break, the staff members will be given a brief tour ~}

of the Files and Communications Division. iy

Since the briefing will cover classified materials, no staff
members will be invited unless they have appropriate security clearances. As
a consequence Professor John Elliff, who has been tentatively named Director
of the Committee's Task Force on Domestic Intelligence, will not attend. It
is hoped that we may provide him with a private velchad at ai later date. | 7

The Washington Post,*”? Thursday, 4-10-75, edition
on page A31 contains an article reporting an interview of Senator Frank
Church, Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities.
[Senator Church, according to this article, stated that the Committee is
reserving the right to make public eventually any documents it gets and is if
accepting nothing with “strings attached.” A }

Inasmuch as this Committee is also the Committee which the
FBI is furnishing information tok, it is believed a clarification of Senator Church's
statement must be obtained and in the interim we should furnish the Senate
Select Committee only those documents which do not have a caveat such as
classified documents or documents bearing the property stamp.

Section Chief William O. Cregar advised that he had contacted
Dr. John M. Clarke, Associate Deputy to the DCI for the Intelligence Committee
concerning Senator Church's reported statement. Clarke stated that CIA
Director William #. Colby was highly upset at Church's remark and that
this statement would be a topic of a discussion of the Executive Committee meeting
of the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group on Congressional Review the morning of
4-11-75, We will be represented at that conference by Section Chief William O.
Cregar and Assistant Director John A. Mintz. Clarke indicated the position _
that the CIA will apparently take regarding this problem is that the White House
should obtain the clarification although CIA Director Colby initially was prepared
to send a letter over his signature to Senate Church to wie such clarification. 2

fuse Inasmuch as the request by EXO omalltine was dbihenek throu;
i ‘he Department, Senator Church's statement was brought to the attention of
Douglas Marvin, Assistant to the Attorney General, who has been handling
all FBI responses to Senate Select Committee requests. Marvin indiertedsho= ="?

desire that he be advised of any Bureau Shadi to the Committee Ghcé# Find 1975

. a
Senate CIA Comimittee Says
White House Stalls on Data

‘By George Lardner Jr.,
‘Woshinston Post Staff Writor
The Senate Committee on|
Intelligence Operations dis-
closed yesterday that the|
White House is still stalling!
on,a month-old request for|
the directives involving covert}
activities by the Central In-
telligence Agency and other,
arms of the Government.

Sen, Frank Church (+
Qdaho), the committee chair-
man, told reporters after aj
closed, 2%-hour meeting that|
“he had been authorized to}
write another letter to Pres-|
‘dent Ford askmg him to ex-]
pedite the request,

The committee asked Mr.|
Ford on March. 12 for all the
executive orders and top-|
secret National Security Coun-|

‘ ¢il directives concerning the

CIA and the rest of the in-|
_telligence community, includ-
ing the command structure at
the White House.

The President was also)
asked to supply the committee
with a copy of CIA Director]
William E. Colby’s January
report to Mr. Ford on allega-
tions of illegal domestic spy-
ing by the agency.

But all the committee has!
gotten so far, Church said,
has been what the White
House evidently regards as
the least sensitive documents!

Church said,he did not
know “what the hang-up is”
since White House aides have
indicated they consider the|
committee’s entire request as}
“perfectly proper.”

Church did not spell out all}
of ‘the’ more sénsitive data”
that is still being withheld,
but he said it includes both
the Colby report and ‘the top-
secret White House and Na-
tional Security Council direc-
tives dealing with covert oper-'
ations, Roth foreign and do-
mestic.

‘The Idaho senator said the
committee is reserving the|
tight to make public eventu-|
ally any documents it gets and
is accepting nothing with|
“strings attached.” But he de
clined to speculate on whether
this might be the reason for,
the administration’s hesitance.

Church said all .of the rec-
ords were essential to the
committee’s mandate to inves-|
tigate the CIA and the rest of
the government’s intelligence
community. He said he still
had.no reason to think at this’
point that the White House|
would refuse to give them up,
‘but he emphasized that he saw
no reason for further delay.

Church.said the committee}
also authorized its staff of
about 35 lawyers and. investi-
gators to start gathering evi-
dence and interviewing wit-

-on the list.

has also ordered a similar in-
quiry but its committee,|
headed by Rep. Lucien Nedzi

The Senate committee’s
chief counsel, Fritz Schwarz,
said directors have now been|

This memorandum reports the results of a meeting bape

on Congressional Review, of vthe Intelligence Community (here- .

the morning of 4/4/75. ’ - os Ae
(ps

This meeting was chaired by Mr. Colby in his role as\'
the Director of Central Intelligence. In attendance were
Mr. Roderick Hills, Assistant Counsel to the President; Associate
Deputy AG Wilderotter; Mr. John Clarke; as well as senior officials
from Defense, Treasury, National Security Council, Office of a
Management and Budget, and the Energy Research and Development. if 7
Administration. an

The following items of interest were discussed:

Mr. Roderick Hills reported that he had a meeting
with the Counsel and Staff Director of the Senate Select Com-
mittee (SSC) to discuss having Legal Counsel present when members
of a particular agency were being interviewed by SSC staff person-
nel, The essence of this meeting resulted in the SSC being
receptive to such an arrangement but it would be incumbent upon
each agency, department or bureau to negotiate the specific
arrangements for such representation with the SSC. Hills also
discussed the problem of the unknown employee or former employee
who might request to be interviewed unbeknownst to the parent
agency. It was suggested to the Counsel and Staff Director by
Hills that such an employee be interviewed by only one staff
member, that the staff member attempt to termine. the je -of
this individual's testimony and then pel wach 2eesty wats a
the parent agency to insure the agency could provide_adyicg.
to the sensitivity of the unknown employee's, testimony. .No firm
decisions were made but it would appear the Counse dan tear ot
Director will agree to allow Counsel to be present -

RE: SENSTUDY 75

testimony of a secret employee and following such testimony
the employee will be allowed to meet with staff members of
the SSC in an Executive Session. It is anticipated more
definitive information on the final decisions regarding this
aspect will be forthcoming from the White House.

The question was raised by the Bureau representative
as to whether the Ad Hoc Group and/or the interagency registry
should be notified as to requests members of the Intelligence
Community receive from other Congressional committees. Mr.
Wilderotter advised that this would be a judgment question;
however, if a request from a Congressional committee other than
the Select Committees impacted on the Intelligence Community,
involve sensitive issues or would be of interest to the White
House, such requests should be provided to the interagency
registry along with an abstract of the response.

Attached is a list of those members of the SSC staff
who have been certified for access to compartmented information.
Also attached is a paper identifying 10 issues likely to grow
out of Select Committee deliberations. The pencil notation in
the right-hand column identifies those agencies of the Intelli-
gence Community responsible for preparing a paper which addresses
these issues. It is noted that issue identified as number eight
is entitled, "Intelligence Files and Privacy." Mr. Colby asked
that the FBI prepare this paper. Assistant Director Mintz advised
that the Bureau has a study underway on this very subject and
agreed that the Bureau would prepare this study. The deadline
for completion of the study is 4/25/75.

Also attached is a copy of the survey of the SSC facility,
Room G-308, Dirksen Building, covering all aspects of physical and
technical security. None of the participants of the EXCOM had any
objection to the facility and we presume the SSC will abide by
the procedures outlined in the attached survey report.

v
Attached also for information is a draft of an employee 4
motice and agreement concerning treatment of confidential material
being considered by the SSC. It is to be noted that to date neither
the Committeenor its staff has signed any such Secrecy Agreement.

"SURVEY REPORT

Senate Select Committee Facility
’ Dirksen Bldg. lst § C Street, N. E.
Washington, D. C.-

pares In: response to. a request’ from Mr.. Ben, Marshall, Security
Director, Senate Select Committee, (tele. 224-1700). Messrs. :
Nicholas R. Zubon and Robert E. Burgener conducted a comprehensive
security survey of the Senate. ‘Select Committee's Facility on.
24 March 1975.

2. Mr. Marshall provided both ‘a comprehensive ‘tour of the
facility. and a detailed explanation of the operation.

3. The ‘following are pertinent facts. concerning the ‘security.
procedures as related to thé Senate Select Committee Facility: —

A. Type of Facility :

The Committee is in the auditorium (Room G 308) of the Dirksen
: Building at. lst and C Streets, N. E., Washington, D. C. . Access to
the auditorium is gained easiest by entering the building from the
J ist and C Streets entrance. A 24-hour guard post is located just
‘inside ‘this entrance.. The Select Committee facility is 40' east :
of the building guard post.: It is nearly in direct line of sight,
“however, a foyer surrounded by a 6' high temporary partition pre-~
cludes the auditorium entrance door from being visible. The
entrance to the auditorium is protected by a 24-hour, guard post.

: The auditorium (Room G 308) is approximately’ 100". long x 45"

wide. The floor, ceiling and walls are made of 6" to 8" solid
"Masonry. The ceiling has.a false ceiling approximately 18" deep

in which the air handling equipment and sundry other service ~ 7
components are housed. . All major air handling equipment ‘is on

the roof above the auditorium. Access to the roof which is strictly
controlled by the Director of Security, is gained by a stairway.

in. the ‘southeast ‘corner of the auditorium. The. sidewalls: each have ©
.a 2' x 3" register approximately, 12'. above the floor through which

Docld:32989628 Page 144



air is passed ‘from the auditorium to the air handling equip-
ment on the roof. These registers are solidly bolted into -
the walls. Sa

The front of the auditorium (south wall) is covered by
a large movie screen. To the right and left of the movie
-screen are two rooms 6' wide and approximately.15' long used
by the.research ‘section clerical personnel. These rooms -
have ‘countertop openings approximately 3" above the floor
for access from within the auditorium. Countertop openings -
exist along both ‘sidewalls for approximately three quarters.
of the length of the wall. The sidewalls have intercorridors
on the opposite side of the countertops which have been con-
verted into. unpaftitioned office space.. The only reproduction
machine, a xerox model 3100, is located.in the west corridor.
The east corridor has been converted into a compartmented saeer
information storage room and a compartmented document reading -: |
room. The Security Director indicated that he may move his~
office to the head of the compartmented reading room to provide’ .
a larger measure of access ‘control -to this sensitive area. :

The auditorium has six wooden exterior doors: 7° high ‘and

. 3" thick. The eritrance door into the auditorium (west and

north wall) will have an.electrical push-button lock installed.
A similar door in the east end of the north wall will be barred
and bracketed’on the inside to. prevent unauthorized entry. . The’
west wall has 2 exterior doors leading into the Capitol Police
offices. The east wall has two exterior doors with ‘one leading ~
to the roof while the second door. exits into the Capitol Police
Garage. All exterior doors will be alarmed. The doors now ¢.
have “Yale. 197/:1/4 locks with the keys controlled by Mr..Marshall.
The fire safety factor concerning these ‘locked: LE was dis~
Banas with him. Sat

The auditorium has a small second floor area at the *porth *
end. - Access is gained by two stairways on the east and west
side of the auditorium. The second floor space consists of a
large projection room, currently filled with projection equip-
ment, and five ‘small. private ‘film viewing rooms. ::

‘The £ive small rooms will be converted into witness inter-
view rooms. The windows in each of these rooms will be covered
during the stay of the Select Committee in the auditorium.

NW.65360 Docld:32989628. Page 145_



” Be plas Controls

Access ‘to the Dirksen Building is gained by either the
main entrance on ist and C Streets, ground level, or the
Basement Tunnel Entrance at the rear of the ‘puiilding. Both °
entrances have a 24-hour guard post where persons entering
are checked for identification. | Brief cases and packages

. are processed through x-ray machines.’ Vendors entering the
main entrance ‘are checked for ID, however, all boxes. ‘are not
. checked. : . .

“Entry into the ‘auditorium is controlled by a guard at the ©
‘door. His instructions are that all persons entering must -
show an ID card. Visitors are permitted only by. appointment...”
They are ‘logged in. and escorted at all times while in the
auditorium. From 1800 houvs Friday through 0800 hours Saturday,
and from 1300 hours Saturday to 0700 hours Monday. everyone ‘must’:
Sign the log in and out and show an ID. In the event an access
problem arises at the guard post, regardless cof the hour, Mr.
Marshall.is alerted. . . . :

C. Guards
‘The Dirksen Building and the auditorium are protected by
members of the U. S. Capitol Police Department. The Building
has two 24-hour/7day-a-week guard posts at the entrances while ~
the Senate Select Committee has one 24- ~hour/7. ‘day-a-week guard:
post at the entrance and an after-hours roving patrol inside
the auditorium. All police officers are w trained, wear

the Capitol Police uniform and carry Smith ‘and Wesson 38 caliber "~

revolvers. . After-hour patrols check all doors, the entire’
auditorium for classified material that may not have been
secured, and the second floor hourly during the night. The

_ guards on duty at the time of the survey were alert and
responsive ‘to. their duties. ‘During off- duty hours, guard
supervisors make at least two unscheduled visits. to the guard
posts during each shift. In addition the guard at the °
stationary post has. four telephones, two of which have a pickup
and automatic ring feature with Capitol Police Headquarters.
There will be no rotation of police officers during the *
occupancy of the Committee. The same officers will be assigned
to these posts... ieee :



D. : Alarms -

All exterior doors to the auditorium will have contact
(microswitch) alarms. The Remington Rand safes, being i
obsolete, will be protected by a proximity alarm.. The :

. compartmented storage room and an adjacent reading area -
will be protected by a volumetric alarm. . For fire pro-
tection a smoke detector/rate of rise alarm will be. :
installed in the compartmented area. All alarms will -
enunciate at the guard desk at the entrance to the”
auditorium. The ADT Company will install and maintain |. -
the alarms. ’

E. | Safes : SESS SSEEE Pee
..The facility. has 22 safes. . Sixteen 4-drawer Remington

Director Sec'y

This memorandum reports the results of a meeting
of the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group on Congressional Review of
the Intelligence Community (hereafter referred to as the
Group), held at CIA Headquarters on the morning of 4/2/75,

The study prepared for the President's Foreign
Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB) entitled, "Human Intel-
ligence," has come to the attention of the Senate Select
Committee (SSC). The major contributors to this report were
the FBI and CIA. It is an extremely sensitive document and
for that reason any requests from any committees of the
Congress for copies of this report should be referred to the
White House. At the present time, the consensus of those
persons in the White House dealing with the subject of release
of information to the committees of Congress is that this
report will not be provided Congressional committees at this’
time. :

By SF,

The SSC does recognize a requirement to comply with
the Third Agency Rule which states in effect that classified |.
information or material originating in one department shall
not be disseminated outside any other department to which it
has been made available without the consent of the originating’
department, CIA's General Counsel has produced a paper entitled
"The Third Agency Rule," copy attached, which they have requested
be reviewed by the Legal Counsels of all agencies making up the
Intelligence Community. A copy of CIA's paper referred to above
has been made available to Assistant Director Mintz who has
indicated he will be in direct ree tR with Mr, Warner, CIA's

General Counsel, 62-t6bs pa ah

Memorandum for Mr. Wannall
RE: SENSTUDY 75

objections be furnished to the Security Committee of the

United States Intelligence Board (USIB) for consideration.

A copy of these guidelines has been furnished to the Freedom

of Information Unit of the Legal Counsel Division for review.
Their comments will be furnished to the Bureau's representative,
Mr. Frank Schwartz, on the USIB Committee in compliance with
the mandate from the Ad Hoc Group.

Also attached is a copy of the abstract which all
agencies of the Intelligence Community are being required to
use in abstracting information that agency has provided one
of the Select Committees. These abstracts will be retained
in an interagency registry to be available for review by any
members of the Intelligence Community as well as the White
House, The purpose of this interagency registry is to have
available in one location all information in abstract form
that members of the Intelligence Community have provided the
ssc.

Attached is a memorandum for. Mr. John Clarke, Chairman
of the Group, advising the names and titles of individuals on
Congressman Nedzi's staff or on the staff of the House Armed
Services Committee who have been approved for access to classi-
fied material, It is assumed that these persons will have
continuing close relations with Congressman Nedzi and may be
officially associated with the House Select Committee.

Also attached is a letter from Senator Church, Chairman
of the Select Committee, addressed to the President enclosing a
list of documents which the SSC is requesting from the White House.

l ; The Third Agency Rule

_ 1. As early as November 1953, the third agency rule was
included in Executive Order 10501, which has now been revoked.
Section 7(c) prohibited the dissemination of "classified defense
: information originating in another Department or agency" to an
agency "outside the receiving Department or agency without the :
consent of the originating Department or agency". The only excep~ | . |
tion to this rule is that dissemination may be made under the authority : 3
of Section 102 of the National Security Act. This section authérizes
the Director of Central Intelligence "to correlate and evaluate intelli- a
gence relating to the national security, and provide for the appropriate.
dissemination of such intelligence within the Government using, where
appropriate, existing agencies and facilities".

2. Historically, the responsibility of the DCI to disseminate
intelligence has referred to "finished intelligence". This product is
the end result of contributions from members of the Intelligence Commu-~
nity. Therefore, in this situation the finished product is ay’ homogenous
product and therefore the approval for further dissemination beyond the |
receiving agency must come from the Central Intelligence Agency.

3. Executive Order 10501 was superseded by Executive Order
11652 which became effective 1 June 1972. This Executive order did not
specifically cover the third agency rule. However, it does provide the
followirig controls: Sec..9. Special Departmental Arrangements. The
. originating Department or other appropriate authority may impose, in
conformity with the provision’ of this order, special requirements with
respect to access, distribution and protection of classified information
. and material, including those which presently relate to communications
* intelligence, intelligence sources and methods and cryptography.

5 4. In anticipation of the implementation of Executive Order
‘11652, a directive was issued on May 17, 1972 entitled "National Security
Council Directive Governing the Classification, Downgrading, Declassi-
fication and Safeguarding of National Security, Information". This

a “directive does not contain the term "third agefjcy rule" but does have
* | gency
SBE. four subsections which relate to procedures which are similar to what
Bs_ | historically had been called the third agency rule. These sections are: -
Be ~| y gency

? Ve obligations. The perees esti of that neéd, peaaauees
shall be made by officials having Ba eae for the’
viii Sree Ecoc or bce

D. Consent of Originating Department to Dissemination
by Recipient. Except as otherwise provided by Section
102 of the National Security Act of 1947, 61 Stat. 495, 50
U.S.C, 403, classified information or material originating
in one Department shall not be disseminated outside any
other Department to which it has been made available

. without the consent of the originating Department.

E. Dissemination of Sensitive Intélligence Information.
Information or material bearing the notation "WARNING =
NOTICE ~- SENSITIVE INTELLIGENCE SOURCES AND
METHODS INVOLVED" shall not be disseminated in any -
manner outside authorized channels without the permission
of the originating Department and an assessment by the

. senior intelligence official in the disseminating Department
“as to the potential risk to the national security and to the
intelligence sources and methods involved. .

F. Restraint on Special Access Requirements. The
establishment of special rules limiting access to, distri-
bution and protection of classified inférmation and material >
under Section 9 of the Order requires the specific prior .
approval of the head of a Department or his designee,

‘5. Examples of the pepearace of the Third Agency Rule are:

(a) In a national security estimate, contributions are
received from all members of the Intelligence Community a:
then disseminated to members of the community under the
authority of the DCI; Steep

(b) A CIA intelligence report disseminated to the State
7 iat - Department may not be sent by the State Department to
the Department of Commerce without the Ber mesics of the
CIA; :

a a (c) Information which the CIA furnishes the President's
r Commission may not be disseminated to other agencies or
to the Congress without the concurrences of CIA. Thus,”
a request from the Congress to the Commission for CIA
information should be referred to CIA for action so that’
the necessary protection of the information can be insured.

NV. 65360 Docld:32989628 Page 169



7 ia (d) If the Navy Department discusses ‘one of its operations
with CIA, CIA may not include information about that operation
in papers it disseminates to other agencies unless it has
received the permission of the Navy Department. The distinc~
tion here is that a Navy operation would not be considered part
of the finished intelligence mechanism and therefore would

not fall within the statutory authority of CIA to disseminate
intelligence. : :

MEMORANDUM FOR: USIB Ad Hoc Group

SUBJECT: Fl ‘Handling of Third Agency |Matters in Response
. : : to Congressional Select Committees

1. As you are aware, Senator Church already has submitted cieerane
to me a long list of materials which he requests be provided to his
Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with
Respect to Intelligence Activities. He has submitted other lists to :
the Federal Bureau of Investigation and to the White House. . It is
expected that other elements of the Intelligence comers will
be hearing from Senator Church,

2. “The scope of ‘the investigation necessarily is going to
involve Third Agency |relationships to a considerable degree.

3. In the implementation of Executive Order 11652,
"Classification and Declassification of National Security Information -
and Material," the President directed the followins:

“"D. Consent of Originating Department to Dissemination
by Recipient. Except as otherwise provided by Section 102
of the National Security Act of 1947, 61 Stat. 495,50 U.S.C.
403, classified information or material originating in one
Department shall not be disseminated outside any other’
Department to which it has been made available without the
consent of the originating department."

4. As inte Section 102 of the 1947 Act, the following

"(3) To the extent recommended by the National Security
Council and approved by the President, such intelligence
of the departments and agencies of the Government, except
as hereinafter provided, relating to the national security, —

anon ngs

shall be open to the inspection of the Director of Central
Intelligence, and such intelligence as relates to the
hational security and is possessed by such departments and
other agencies of the Government, except as hereinafter
provided, shall be made available to the Director of
Central Intelligence for correlation, evaluation and
dissemination: Provided, however, that upon the written
request of the Director of Central Intelligence, the Director
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation shall make available
to the Director of Central Intelligence such information -
for correlation, evaluation and dissemination as may be ~
essential to the national security." “ :

5. Iflam requested to provide certain materials and F
investigation indicates that the material asked for involves a document .
which originated within an organization other than the Intelligence - 7 ania
Community Staff or the Central Intelligence Agency, the requestor
will be asked to redirect his inquiry to the office of origin..

: 6. It already is apparent, however, that the documentation - :
being requested inevitably is going to include references to inter-
, relationships among various of the elements of the intelligence
. community, Clearing “each and every such réféicute with
agency mentioned could manifestly be extremely consuming of time
and manpower. - :

: 7. I propose the Ad Hoc Group agree on the following procedure,
Where it appears that truly sensitive matters are involved, the :
material will be sanitized by the agency concerned and a check will
be made with the appropriate’ Third Agency organizations before
release. Where the reference concerns a Third Agency indirectly
or is not considered sensitive and does not pose policy concerns, the
agency concerned may forward the material to the requesting Select
Committee without an item-by- item, mention-by-mention clearance
with Third Agencies. However, in all cases notification that such
material has been forwarded will be made to the central index and

NW 65360 Docld:32989628 Page 172!


all agencies alerted through that mechanism. Agencies will
designate on their submissions to the central index, the name and

telephone number of the releasing party.

8. Ad hoc members should be prepared to discuss and
come to some agreement on this matter at the next meeting.

By memorandum dated 3-20-75, you were advised of a ‘lid tm —
request received from the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities.
The Intelligence Division requested that an attempt be made to modify portions

of the Committee's request.

Regarding Part I titled Legal Authorities, the Intelligence Division
pointed out that this particular request was wide-ranging and required a considerable
file review as it requested any memorandum discussing the legal authority of
the FBI to (1) investigate internal security matters, (2) collect intelligence
information, and (3) engage in counter -intelligence activities; together with
copies of all constitutional and statutory provisions, executive orders, presidential
directives, Attorney General opinions and memoranda, and any other materials
asserted as sources of such authority.” With regard to Part II concerning the
FBI's administrative organization, they requested the identities by name of personnel
in the Intelligence Division, Unit Chief and above. This caused concern in the
Intelligence Division that there would be a needless proliferation of a list of
Bureau personnel working in this field which list, of course, would be of interest
to foreign intelligence sources. 4, ha

On 4-1-75 Inspector John B. Hotis and SA Paul V. Daly discussed i
these matters with William Miller, Staff Director of the Senate Select Committee;
John T. Elliff, who has been nominated to head the task force for the Committee
looking into FBI activities; F. A. O. Schwarz, Counsel to the Senate Select
Committee; and staff member Michael Epstein. They agreed to modify the request
in Part I to the extent that personnel in the Intelligence Division need not be.
identified by name below the level of Assistant Director in the organization chart |

to be furnished them pursuant to theiz, request of 3-19-75. They asked as an
alternative the Bureau prepare a li personnel in the Intelligence Division down

to the level of Unit Chief with names inked which they would have access to

review in Bureau space.

Legal Counsel to Adams Memo ;
RE: SENSTUDY 75

With regard to Part I relating to legal authorities, they stated
they were amenable to the Bureau furnishing them whatever documents they
have retrieved up to this time which have been recovered pursuant to their
request of 3-19-75 and that no additional detailed review need be conducted
until they review the aforementioned documents. At the end of their review
they will make any additional specific requests concerning this part of their
request. They also asked that in our response we furnish them copies of documents
listed on a three-page paper prepared by the staff of the Senate Select Committee,
a copy of which is attached.

Staff Director Miller requested that the Bureau expedite their
response to the Senate Select Committee's request as the first meeting of that
Committee is scheduled for Wednesday,,.429215.and he felt strongly that they
“ust have material that showed progress in their study of the FBI prior to that
time. Mr. Miller requested that, if necessary, the request be responded to in
a piecemeal basis and that the complete response does not necessarily have to
be made at one time.

It is suggested that we make available to this Committee as soon
as possible those documents which we have furnished the General Accounting
Office (GAO) which also fall within the 3-19-75 request of the Senate Select
Cornmittee. In this regard staff members have advised they are in contact with
GAO auditors concerning the FBI.

By way of observations it is obvious that the staff members of
the Committee are well versed in Bureau policy and procedures. To this point
they have been cooperative and we should insure that we give a timely response
to their various requests.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

(1) That the Intelligence Division advise whether modification
of the Senate Select Committee's request concerning legal authorities for
investigations and the modification of the table of organization of the Intelligence
Division are acceptable and, if so, expeditiously prepare the necessary abe i se
to the Senate Select Committee. ay

With the proliferation of committees in Congress looking into 8
FBI operations, it is essential that a standard procedure for the forwarding a
documents to the requesting committees be established. Inasmuch as requests
such as the request of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities
have been forwardedto this Bureau through the Department, it would appear ~y
logical that responses to such inquiries and all other inquiries of Congressional + r v
committees, whether they be directed to the Department and/or the Bureau, Phe a
(be. responded to through the Department. Such a procedure not only will as

In connection with our preparation of responses to requests ly 8 Se

PERIODS OF PREDOMINANT NILITARY A
INTERESTS, NOT INVOLVING MARTIAL LAW

ed
I. ‘In time of war certain areas will come into prominence as
potential theaters of operation. When an armed forces commander
of such a potential theater is designated, he definitely has :
interest in, though not control of, the civilian life within the
- area. In order that. the armed.forces commander, may prepare -hin-
self for the discharge of the possible respemsibility which may
affix to him, the following procedure is agreed upon:

- ‘2, Agents of the FBI; of ONI; I, Army3 and the OSI, Ic,
U.S. Air Forse will continue to function in accordance with the
provisions of Sections II, III, IV, and V. :

2. In addition thereto, the armed forces commander may take
_ Steps to analyze the facilities existing and to explore the
_IManner in which complete coverage will be obtained if martial law

is declared, Adequate liaison with the other subscribing agencies
will insure that the armed forces commander will have the henerit
of the experience, judgment and knowledge of the representatives
o£ the other ‘agencies, :

3. The armed forces commander is authorized to request and
receive such information from the other three agencies as he may
desire and they may be able to furnish,

XI. The analysis and exploration referred to above will show the
coverage furnished by each of the subscribimg agencies and any

. additional coverage each subscribing agency can undertake, When
the commander feels that more complete coverage is required, it
is recognized that he is autkerized to augment the coverage with
such elements of the subscribing agencies as are under his
jurisdiction. Prior to any invasion of the spheres normally
coming under the cognizance of the other subscribing agencies,
the armed forces commander should obtain the necessary authority
from the Secretary of Defense.

_ ITI. Irrespective of the fact that the preceding recommendations
have placed the initiative in the hands of the armed forces
commander, whenever any of the other services feel that such
a survey to determine adequacy of coverage should be undertaken,
it should be so recommended. :

Cooperation and Coordination Between

The Director of” Intelligence, U.S. Army, the Director
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Director of Naval
Intelligence and the Director. of the Office of Special -Investi-
gations, Inspecter General, U.S. Air Forte, with a view to
promoting the ciosest possiblé ceeperation and coordination
petween the Field Services of these agencies agree that the

rt (a) Special Agents in Charge of the Federal Bureau of |

‘Investigation Divisicnal Offices, Military Intelligence Officers
of the pertinent Armies, District Officers of the Office of
Special Investigations, Inspector Generali, U.S. Air Force, and
Naval District Intelligence Officers will maintain clese persenal
“liaison between those offices and their representatives, including
a meeting of representatives of the four agencies, preferably the
officers in charge, at least twice per month, for the purpose of
discussing pending and contémpiated investigative activities, and
any other subjest necsssary to insure that there is proper co-
ordination of their investigative work.

EEE (b) The clese personal liaison to be maintained -
between representatives of the four agencies at all times should
insure that there is not duplication of effort in any field, and

_ that a proper coverage of the whole investigative field is main-
tained, Particular attention should be paid to avoiding any
duplication in connection with the use of informers.

(c) A distinction should be recognized between the
investigative interest of individual agencies and the coverage
interest. It is believed that ail four agencies should study,
from time to time, the-coverage of the investigative field in
order to insure that ail channels of interest and avenues of
information are adequately covered by at least one of the partici-
pating agencies. : e : 7 :

(d) Where there is doubt as to whether or not one of the
other agencies is interested in information collected, it should
be transmitted to the other agency.

(e) Consideration should be given to the fact*that certain
classes of information are of general interest to the Military,
Naval, and Air Force Intelligence Services in connection with
’ background and knowledge ‘of espionage and sabotage organizations,
even though the Military, Navai, and Air Force Intelligence
Services may have no apparent direct investigative interest.

INVESTIGATIVE GUIDELINES
TITLE XI, ORGANIZED CRIME CONTROL ACT OF 1970.
REGULATION OF EXPLOSIVES

1. General

Title XI of the captioned law amends Title 18, United
States Code, by adding a new chapter 40 with section numbers 841
through 848 governing the importation, manufacture, distribution
and storage of explosive materials and creating certain Federal
offenses pertaining to the unlawful use of explosives. Administration
of explosives regulation is vested in the Secretary of the Treasury
as is investigative jurisdiction over the unlawful acts proscribed
in section 842. Under authority contained in section 846 the
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) have concurrent investigative jurisdic-
tion as to the remainder of chapter 40, i.e., the unlawful acts
proscribed in subsections (d), (e), (f), (a), (h) and (i) of section
844, Although not specified in chapter 40, the Postal Inspection
-Sovvics Shalt have jurisdicvion te tuvéstivate att. idvidenis
jnvolving explosive or incendiary devices sent through the mails
or directed against U.S. Postal Service property.

Title XI greatly broadens Federal. authority pertaining to
explosives-connected offenses. At the same time, Congress has
expressly disclaimed any intent to occupy the field to the exclusion
of state Taw on the sama subject matter. To effect both Congressional
purposes and to prevent unnecessary duplication of effort it is
essential that the limited Federal investigative resources be carefully
allocated, particularly in cases in which both the ATF and the FBI
have jurisdiction.

2. Federal Bureau of Investisation (F81) Jurisdiction in General

(a) Effect on prior jurisdiction - This agreement applies
only to those incidents as to which the FBT had no investigative
jurisdiction prior to the enactment of the captioned Taw and to
‘incidents previously subject to FBI investigation by reason of chapter
65, Title 18, United States Code (malicious mischief). Investigative
procedures in other types of incidents (e.g., train wrecking, damaging
aircraft and motor vehicles, racketeering) shall remain unchanged.

-2- ‘

(b) Primary jurisdiction - Subject to the provisions
hereof, the FBI will exercise primary jurisdiction over all alleged
violations of section 844 which are directed at foreign diplomatic
facilities or at activities, such as transportation and tourist
offices, operating under the aegis of a foreign government although
not in a diplomatic status, over all alleged violations of subsections
844(d) through (i) which are perpetrated by terrorist/revolutionary
groups or individuals and all other violations of subsections 844(e)
through (g) which are not directed at Treasury Department or Postal
Service buildings or functions.

(c) Type of Investigation to be Coriducted

(1) Offenses peroetrated by terrorist/revolutionary
groups or individuals ~ The F&I wiil immediately initiate a full
investigation of all alleged violations of section 844 which appear
at the outset to have been perpetrated by terrorist/revolutionary
yroups oF TGiViduals a5 defined ti advance by the Intcrnal Security
Division of the Department of Justice. If ATF or the Postal
Inspection Service has properly initiated investigations and infor-
mation is subsequently developed indicating apparent involvement of
terrorist/revolutionary groups or fitviduais, responsibility shall
be relinquished to the FBI unless a determination is made by the
Department of Justice that a transfer of responsibilities will
_” unduly impair further investigative efforts.

(2) Alleged offenses against Colleges and Universities -
The FBI will immediately initiate a full Investigation of any alveged
violation of section 844 which involves the use or attempted use of
explosive (as distinguished from incendiary) materials against the
facilities of a college or university. Investigation of alleged viola-
tions involving use or attempted use of incendiary materials will be
limited initially to the development of background information as
prescribed in paragraph 6 bélow,

(3) Alleged offenses directed against foreign
diplomatic facilities and related activities - The FSI will immediately
Ynitiate a full investigation of all alleged violations of section 844
which are directed at foreign diplomatic facilities and related
activities as described in paragraph 2(b) above.

: (4) AU other alleged violations of subsection
844(f) ~~ offenses involving use of exnlosives against United
States property or federally financed organizations, and (¢) ~
offenses involving possession of explosives in buildings owned,
leased, used, etc., by the United States ~ The FBI will immediately
Gnitiate a full investigation of all violations of subsection 844(q)
over which it has primary jurisdiction hereunder, and those violations
of 844(f) which are directed at federal property (e.g., & military
poli} or a federal function (¢.g., a Selective Service or ROTC
facility). In other violations of 844(f) the FBI will develop and
disseminate background information as indicated in paragraph 6 below.

3. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Division (ATF) Jurisdic~
tion in General

(a) Violations ancillary to firearms laws violations or
violation of section 842 - The Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Division
(ATF) Of the Department of the Treasury will exercise investigative
jurisdiction over violations of section 844 which are ancillary to its
primary jurisdiction over the Federal firearms laws or over section
842 cf Title XI.

(b) Violations of subsection S44(d) - interstate transporta-
tion of explosives with unlawful intent and subsection 844(7) =
offenses against property used in or affecting commerce - Subject to
paragraph 2b, above, the ATF will exercise primary investigative
jurisdiction over violations of subsection 844(d) and (i) and will
conduct a full investigation thereof unless notified by the Criminal
Division that pursuant to paragraph 2(c)(1), above, the Department of
Justice has requested FBI investigation in a particular matter.

(c) Violations directed at Treasury Department property or
functions - The ATF shall have primary jurisdiction to investigate all
violations of section 844 which are directed at Treasury Department
property or functions and will conduct a full investigation of such
violations. . - -

NW-65360 Docld:32989628 Page 221


-4-

4.. Postal Inspection Service Jurisdiction

The Postal Inspection Service shall have primary juris-
diction to investigate all violations of section 844 which are
directed at U.S. Postal Service property or functions.

5. Special Considerations

(a) Bomb Threats, false information (section 844(e)) -
The ATF and the Postal Inspection Service shall have jurisdiction
over violations of section 844(e) against Treasury Department or
Postal Service property or functions, respectively. The FBI shall
have jurisdiction over all other violations of section 844{e). Upon
receipt of information alleging or suggesting a violation of subsection
Ba(e), the investigative agency concerned will review available
information to determine whether the identity of the offender is
known or can be readily ascertained and, if not, whether the evidence
suggests a pattern or pian of such offenses by a pariicuiar uffeauer
or against a particular victim. If such a pattern appears or if the
offender is identified, all available information will be disseminated
as indicated in paragraph 6 below.

(b) Use/carrying explosive in commission of a felony
(section 844(h)) - Violations of 844(h) should be handfed as an
adjunct of the felony from which they arise and should be discussed
with the appropriate United States Attorney or Division of the
Department handling prosecution of the underlying felony offense.
The agency having jurisdiction over the underlying feiony will have
investigative jurisdiction over the 844{h) violation (e.g., bank
robbery is under FBI jurisdiction).

(c) Violations of 26 U.S.C. 5861 (destructive devices) -
In incidents involving alleged violations of 18 U.S.C. 844 (which
may also involve a violation of 26 U.S.C. 5861), ATF shall not
exercise its primary jurisdiction under 26 U.S.C. 5861 involving
destructive devices, but the incident shall be treated in accordance.
with the provisions of these guidelines. This is in no way a
relinguishment by ATF of its investigative jurisdiction under Title
If of the Gun Control Act of 1968.

NW 65360 Docld:32989628 Page 222



Sia

6. Development of Background Information

Some incidents such as those directed against Federal
property or functions (paragraph 2(b) above) require immediate full
federal investigation. Others require a more circumspect approach
and will result in full Federal investigation only after considera-
tion of factors pertinent to the exercise of Federal jurisdiction.
Accordingly, in these incidents which these guidelines do not prescribe
immediate full investigation, the investigative agency having juris-
diction will develop background information which includes (a) facts
bearing on motivation such as involvement of the suspected perpetrators
in terrorist/revolutionary activities, organizad crime, labor-management
disputes, or racial-religious hate activities; (b) the applicability
of state and local laws and likelihood of state or local investigative
and prosecutive actions; and (c) any other available facts indicating
whether or not the offense warrants Federal investigation and prosecu-
tion. Such background information will be submitted telephonically
(202-739-2745) or by teletype (710-822-6008) to the General Crimes
Section nf the Criminal Division and to the appropriate United States
Attorney, The Criminal Division will advise the investigative agency
concerned whether the matter warrants submission to any other
Division or Section of the Criminal Division, and when so warranted
the Criminal Division will transmis the information to such other
Division or Section.

7, Full Investigation

A full investigation will be initiated immediately in
those instances wherein such investigation is specified herein. In
other instances full investigation will be initiated only upon direc-
tion of the Department of Justice after consideration by the Division
having cognizance over the matter of the background information
developed under paragraph 6 above.

€

8. Reports ‘ i

Copies of case reports prepared in matters investigated under
these guidelines will be furnished directly to the Department of Justice
and the appropriate United States Attorney. All investigative agencies

NW 65360 Docld:32989628 Page 223


~6«

shal] submit initial reperts as soon as practicable to the Department
of Justice and shall submit progress reports once each 30 days or

as scon ‘thereafter as possible. The Criminal Division of the
Department of Justice will be informed as soon as possible in each
instance wherein an investigative acency initiates an investigation
under section 844, Such notification is of critical importance to
the avoidance of duplication of investigative activities. Also each
agency subscribing to these guidelines shall, upon instituting inves~-
tigation regarding possible violations of section 844, immediately
notify other subscribing agencies having a logical interest therein.
Also, a sufficient level of follow-up liaison and dissemination shall
be maintained to avoid duplication of investigative effort.

Additionally, each such agency will exchange information
on a timely basis and in a manner which will not interfere with
ongoing investigations relative to types, seurces, movement, and
storage of explosives which are the subject of its investigations.
Information regarding significant developments in investigations
being conducted under these guidelines and information of an intelli-

genes nature developed incidental te investigations

Vand ant
ich is-af logical
interest to the Department of Justice shall be furnished promptly to
“~ the Criminal Division of that Department which will be responsible
for any necessary further dissemination within that Department.

9. Review of Guidelines -

These guidelines shal] be reviewed on a continuing basis by

_ the parties hereto to determine whether problems exist in their admin-

istration which should be alleviated or whether modification of any of
the terms cf the agreement are needed in the interests of better law

"The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) originates, and receives from
other sources, large numbers of reports on individuals and organizations.
One purpose of this agreement is to define that portion of the information
on file with, or received or originated by, the FBI, which the United States

7 Secret Service (USSS) desires to receive in connection with its protective
responsibilities.

"The USSS has statutory authority to protect, or to engage in certain
activities to protect, the President and certain other persoris. (Certain
other persons, as used in this agreement, refers to those persons protected
by the Secret Service under Title 18, U. S. Code, Section 3056.) The
authority of the USSS to protect the President or certain other persons is
construed to authorize it to investigate organizations or individuals and to

interview individuals who might constitute a threat to the President or cer- i
tain other persons. The FBI has statutory authority to investigate assault, :
| killing or kidnaping and attempts or conspiracies to kill or kidnap the
. President and other designated individuals. i

"The FBI will make available to the USSS information G+ may reguest ot iufus-
matiou wick vy its nature reveals a definite or possible threat to the
_ safety of the President and certain other persons. i

: "A second purpose of this agreement is to iasure the most effective pro-
— tection for the President and certain other persons by establishing a clear
division of responsibility between the FBI and the USSS. Such division

will also avoid compromising investigations or sources and needless duplica~
tion of effort.

}

ca

"IIs General Responsibilities

"The USSS is charged by Title 18, U. S. Code, Section 3056, with the
responsibility of protecting the person of the President of the United
States, the members of his immediate family, the President-elect, the Vice
President or other officer in the order of succession to the office of
President, and the Vice President-elect; protecting the person of a former 7
’ President and his wife during his lifetime and the person of a widow of a Ee
former President until her death or remarriage, and minor children of a former :
President until they reach 16 years of age, unless such protection is declined; °
protecting persons who are determined from time to time by the Secretary
of the Treasury, after consuitation with the Advisory Committee, as being
major Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates who should receive such
‘ protection (unless the candidate has declined such protection); protecting
the person of siting head of a foreign state or foreign government
. and, at the direction of the President, other distinguished foreign visitors
to the United States and official representatives of the United States
/ performing nae missions abroad (unless such persons decline protection). :

U. Se agencies) from its files or which may come to its attention which by
its nature reveals a danger or possible danger to the President or certain

ther persons, or which can be construed as falling within the categories of

gol oR AL GIe April 7, 1975
co

Mr. Wannalyp Salud, 75

The statement in the attached of okt d Agency
rule is accurate and does not present legal problems. “~~ *

As an observati: aragraph number 7 of the
document titled "Handling ofThird Agency Matters in Response to
Congressional Seléct Committee!’ dated Ma 28; 1975, (attached)
appears to be subject to various interpretations. This paragraph and
in particular the second sentence of the paragraph appears to allow the
-agency receiving the Committee's request to respond in instances where -
a Third Agency is indirectly involved and thé material is sensitive with- es
out first contacting the Third Agency. Any notification of the Third
Agency in this instance of the furnishing of such information to the
Committee would be after the fact. The term indirectly is not defined.
Additionally, this paragraph allows the Agency receiving the Committee's
request to respond in instances where a Third Agency is directly involved
and the material is nonsensitive without checking with the Third Agency
involved, It would appear the language in paragraph number 7 should

be tightened up and the appropriate terms defined. : ly

The Third Agency Rule  ~

_ 1. As early as November 1953, the third agency rule was
included in Executive Order 10501, which has now been revoked,
Section 7(c) prohibited the dissemination of "clessified defense
information originating in another Department or agency" to an
agency "outside the receiving Department or agency without the
consent of the originating Department or agency". The only excep- |
tion to this rule is that dissemination may be made under the authority
of Section 102 of the National Security Act. This Section authdtizes ~
the Director of Central Intelligence "to correlate and evaluate intelli-
gence relating io the national security, and provide for the appropriate
dissemination of such intelligence within the Government nina where
appropriate, existing agencies and facilities".

2. Historically, the sesponsibility of the per to disseminate
intelligence has referred to "finished intelligence". This product is

-the end result of contributions from members of the Intelligence Commu-

nity. Therefore, in this situation the finished product is af homogenous
product and therefore the approval for further dissemination beyond the ©
receiving agency must come from the Central Intelligence Agency Ye

3. Executive ‘Order 10501 was superseded by Execu: itive Order
11652 which became effective 1 June 1972. This Executive order did not
specifically cover the third agency rule. However, it does provide the .
following controls: Sec..9. Special Departmental Arrengemenis. The
originating Department or other appropriate authority may impose, in
conformity with the provisions of this order, special requirements with
respect to access, distribution and protection of classified information
and material, including those which presently relate to communications

* intelligence, intelligence sources and methods and cryptography.

4, In anticipation of the implementation of Executive Order

‘11652, a directive was issued on May 17, 1972 entitled "National Security 7

Council Directive Governing the Classification, Downgrading, Declassi- ~
fication and Safeguarding of National Security Information". This

Udirective does not contain the term "third ageijcy rule" but does have

four subsections which relate to procedures which are similar to what
historically had been called the third agency rule. These sections are: °

A.(2) Determination of Need-to-Know. In addition +: 4
security clearance, a person must have a need for access
to the particular classified information or material sought
in connection with the performance of his official duties or,

EB. Dissemination of Sensitive Intelligence Information.

of the finished intelligence mechanism and therefore would

not fall within the statutory authority of CIA to disseminate
intelligence. : -- mos

This memorandum recommends thatthe attached Se
draft of a paper prepared by CIA entitled, Ambiguities and
the Law," be réViewed by the Legal Counsel Division for comment
and that a member of the Division be named to represent the FBI
in future meetings with legal representatives from other U. S.
Intelligence Board (USIB) agencies and departments. The purpose
of such a group is to develop recommendations for changes in
existing laws or the proposal of new legislation which Mr. Colby
as the Director of Central Intelligence can offer to the Senate
Select Committee for their consideration.

fou
At a meeting of the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group on ~¥ % fi
Congressional Review of the Intelligence Community 2/27/75, a‘ ~~
draft paper entitled, "Ambiguities and the Law," was distributed

to all members, This paper was drafted by Mr. Marvin Smith of

CIA. It is considered a starting point for the Intelligence
Community to identify areas in existing statutes that should be
changed, as well as to recommend new legislation deemed necessary
to clarify for the Congress and the American people the authori-
ties, the limitations and missions of various member agencies

or departments of the Intelligence Community,

x

be) In furnishing copies of this paper to members, the

" Chairman of the Ad Hoc Group, Mr. John Clarke, acknowledged the

paper presents a starting point and in no way should be considered

a final draft. He suggested that Legal Counsel representatives

of each agency or department of USIB review the document and

submit their comments directly to Mr. Marvin Smith, on Agency

& code 143, extension 4055. Following the receipt of such comments

a from the legal offices of member:' agencies and departments, it

was proposed that a meeting would be called in an effort to ~

begin drafting a paper representative of the Intelligence Community

which would reflect recommended changes in existing statutes or

proposals for new legislation. eo oe a] we

AMBIGUITIES AND THE LAW

CIA, NSA, DIA, FBI and, to some extent, several other’
Federal Agencies, collect information and produce intelligence, but
of different kinds and for different purposes. This is recognized in
practice but is not as clearly established in the law. Given some
lack of clarity in the law and some uncertainty regarding limits
placed on intelligence activities, misunderstanding and fear of abuse
of power easily thrive¥. In reality, however, in the implementation
of mission and charters and in direction and control, “there are not
as many unresolved ambiguities as the uninformed may suppose.

The experience following the National Security Act of 1947 is
such that it is now possible to eliminate some of the vagueness of
the language of the Act. The certainty and public confidence that
should result from clarifications in the law should far outweigh any ©
disadvantages, A number of possible amendments or additions to
current laws have already been mentioned, and proposed legislation

has already been submitted for some, These ideas and others are

suggested, below.

1) Clarify CIA's mission and charter by
amending the National Security Act of ‘1947 to’ ~

--that included in the proper functions

of the Agency are (a) collection of foreign
intelligence information; (») conduct of
activities to carry out CIA's counter-
intelligence responsibilities overseas;

and (c) conduct of covert action operations

overseas when authorized by the President;

--that CIA's responsibility to produce
intelligence relates only to foreign
intelligence;

--passage of information derived as a by-
product of foreign intelligence activities to
those agencies responsible for the matters

involved.

. A few changes in the procedures for reviewing intelligence
activities might add considerable’ understanding and confidence. Of
paramount importance is a form of congressional oversight that permits
the provision to Congress of the necessary information in a timely,
efficient and controlled manner. It is recognized that a number of
Committees in both the Senate and House must be informed of sub-

stantive intelligence, operational matters and fiscal details in varying

degrees. Just as in the executive branch, the test of access should be

 )

"need-to-know, '' To apply this test and to control and protect
sensitive information provided to Congress, a focal point within .,.
Congress would be extremely helpful. Whether a joint committee
or not, such a focal point would also be valuable in facilitating
changes in laws affecting intelligence activities. Congress might
find that a more uniform approach to budget presentation and review
would provide better insight and understanding.

The foregoing suggestions are by no means definitive. They

do, however, present areas that in the experience of the intelligence

community deserve careful attention. .

This memorandum recommends that the Legal Counsel ae
Division coordinate and assign responsibilities to appropriat
Divisions for the collection and preparation of certain material:

we anticipate the Senate Select Committee (SSC) will soon request
from the FBI.

..
Memorandum W. 0. Cregar to W. R. Wannall, dated Aj
3/5/75, reported the results of a meeting between Senator Church ;
and Mr. Colby wherein Senator Church advised he anticipated

asking all agencies and departments of the Intelligence Community
for (1) Organizational charts broken down to a branch level going
back to 1947, (2) Copies of all budgets since 1947 and (3) Docu-
ments reflecting all cash flows since 1947.

Attached is a copy of a short letter from Mr. John
Clarke, Chairman of the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group on Congres-
sional Review of the Intelligence Community to Mr. William G.
Miller, Staff Director, SSC. Also attached is a copy of a
memorandum from Mr. Clarke to all members of the Ad Hoc Coordina= |
ting Group on Congressional Review of the Intelligence Community. |
This memorandum sets out in more detail what information the
SSC will be seeking from all agencies making up the Intelligence
Community. It should be noted that on page two of Mr. Clarke's
memorandum he notes a formal request from Senator Church to all
agencies can be expected.

The Intelligence Division believes considerable time
and effort will be required from several Divisions to pull this
information together. It is believed we should peeaany Nhs osu
assemble the data in anticinayy ga" a request. at

Intelligence Committee. Clarke's memorandum was attached to ~~ 7)
W. O. Cregar to W. R. Wannall memorandum dated 3/6/75.

‘ The identified data to be collected outlined in Clarke's memorandum a |
was proposed-type data that the Senate Select Committee has if

- indicated an interest in.

’ aa In view of 3/19/75 letter subsequently received from
Senator Frank Church (Democrat, Idano), Chairman of the Senate
Select Committee, to tae Attorney General outlining a request for
specific FBI documents they are interested in receiving, the
Intelligence Division has begun accumulating this specific data.

In view of this request for specific data, the Intelligence Division
will not accumulate the data outlmed in the Clarke memorandum

the specific data to be collected ‘whichis extensive in nature.

RE BUTEL, MARCH 24 LAST.
LOS ANGELES DIVISION HAS CAREFULLY BROKEN DOWN BY PERCENTAGES
THOSE AGENTS WORKING INTERNAL SECURITY AND COUNTER- INTELLIGENCE
WORK USING THOSE CLASSIFICATIONS PROVIDED BY SUPERVISOR GROOVER.
DIVISION HAS A TOTAL OF 91 AGENTS PLUS ONE SAC, FOUR SUPERVISORS
ASSIGNED TO INTERNAL SECURITY AND ONE SUPERVISOR ASSIGNED TO
COUNTERINTELLIGENCE, ASSIGNED TO SUCH CLASSIFICATIONS, THIRTY
FIVE OF THESE WORK COUNTERINTELLIGENCE AND 56 WORK INTERNAL SECURITY.

ADMINISTRATIVE

LOS ANGELES IS SUBMITTING FOR BUREAU’S CONSIDERATION, IF
PERTINENT, THREE OF THE ABOVE 56 CLASSIFIED AS SECURITY AGENTS
WORK FULL TIME ON BOMBING MATTERS WHICH ARE ALMOST ALL MATTERS
WHEREIN WE HAVE NO JURISDICTION EXCEPT FOR DATA KEEPING FOR
NATIONAL BOMB DATA CENTER. TWELVE OF THE 56 SECURITY AGENTS

NW 65360 Docld:32989628 Page 337


PAGE TwO

ARE INVOLVED FULL TIME IN OUR FALSE IDENTITY PROGRAM. THIS 12
PROGRAM ORIGINATED WITH OUR WEATHFUG ACTIVITIES, HOWEVER, 7
THE FRAUDULENT USE OF DECEASED INFANT IDENTITY PAPERS HAS 23
EXPANDED TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT THE VAST MAJORITY INVOLVE

CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES OTHER THAN SECURITY WORK. SEVEN OF THE 56

AGENTS ON SECURITY ARE INVOLVED FULL TIME IN FUGITIVE

INVESTIGATIONS WHICH ORIGINATE WITH SOME DEMONSTRATION OR

ACT OF TERROR, ETC, BUT AT THE PRESENT THEY ARE CLEAR CUT

CRIMINAL FUGITIVE INVESTIGATIONS. ONE OF THE 56 IS INVOLVED

FULL TIME IN THE HANDLING OF FOREIGN POLICE COOPERATION

MATTERS WHICH IS TECHNICALLY AN APPLICANT-TYPE INVESTIGATION,

BUT THE 163 CLASSIFICATION WAS INCLUDED IN THE SECURITY

CLASSIFICATIONS. CSUMMARIZING THESE EXCEPTIONS WE HAVE A TOTAL

OF 23 AGENTS WHO ARE ASSIGNED TO SECURITY WORK BUT ARE, IN

FACT, NOT INVOLVED IN ANY INTERNAL SECURITY INVESTIGATIONS,

LEAVING ONLY 33 AGENTS DEVOTING THEIR FULL TIME EFFORTS TO

INTERNAL SECURITY MATTERS PLUS, THE ABOVE MENTIONED 35
COUNTERINTELLIGENCE AGENTS.

Memorandum captioned as above, “3/27/75, from Legal
Counsel to you, noted that you and Wannall were to meet with
Mr. Hills and Mr. Phillip Buchen, Counsel to the President,
on 3/28/75. Your addendum to the memorandum pointed out the
results of this meeting and the various matters discussed.

As a follow-up to this meeting, you, Legal Counsel
Mintz and Wannall met on 4/4/75 with Mr. James Wilderotter,
who is presently working under Mr. Buchen in coordinating
intelligence community matters relating to the inquiries
underway by the Senate Select Committee. Mr. Wilderotter was coe
given a briefing similar to that which had been afforded to afl

La

4 Buchen and Hills. In addition, the discussion covered matters
ak of a sensitive nature relating to Coa HID] and similar PLOgransy—
ae electronic surveillances, specialized handIing of informants,
afi and Bureau Source 4 (access to social security records). Many of
Be these matters discussed covered topics with which Mr, Wilderotter
Ba had become familiar when he was assigned to the Department as an
es Assistant to former Deputy Attorney General Silberman.
gBR F Wilderotter said it was the feeling at The White House
Boa that while raw FBI files should not be made available to the
A Committee, it might be necessary to permit the Committee to review
ais a few such files in order that the integrity of the FBI could be
tee! established with the Cemmittee. It was pointed out to him that

Memorandum to Mr. J. B, Adams
RE: SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE
ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES;

COUNSEL TO THE PRESIDENT

furnishing reports and letterhead memoranda which had been
prepared for dissemination would satisfy the Committee's
needs. He was advised by both you and Mr. Mintz that it was
our feeling that we should not furnish the raw material but
summaries could be prepared for the Committee's purposes and
if necessary, Bureau officials could be placed under oath
and attest to the correctness of the summaries, Wilderotter
said that this was a matter which he would afford further
consideration.

As during the conference with Buchen and Hills,
it was obvious as the result of our meeting with Wilderotter
that The White House was most anxious that it not be caught
by surprise by revelations of activities which in any way
might be considered questionable. The White House is making
every effort possible to become cognizant of any such situation
prior to the Committee hearings.

Classified “ap -Seeret! to protect highly sensitive
investigative techniquéS and matters relating to foreign
relations.

ACTION :

For information. Further contacts with Wilderotter
or other White House Staff Members will be duly reported.

On 3-18-75 Professor Jolin’T. Elliff advised Inspector J ohn B. NU
Hotis that he hadbeen contacted by fata Staff Director for the
‘ Senate Select Committee on Jotelligence Acti » and was asked to serve
“as Director of the Committee's Task Force on Domestic Intelligence. This
"is one of four Task Forces being formed by the Select Committee and it
will focus primarily on the activities of the FBI. The other Task Forces
are on Foreign Intelligence, Military and Technological eters and
Command and Control.

Elliff said he had not decided whether to accept the offer
and believed that others were also being considered for the position. He
said he was reluctant to do anything that would interfere with the excellent
working errergemaits he had developed with the Bureau. He feels that his
initial cbligation is to the Director, and the purpose of going to the Police
Foundation was to get formal support for a project that would be of primary
benefit to the Bureau and only secondarily to the Attorney General and Congress
He said he would be guided by our judgment in this matter and not want to |
break any Senin that he might have made with the Bureau. jf za

Tf he accepts the appointment Elliff said he would, of course,
suspend work on his research project until he had terminated his employment
with the Committee. He said he would also agree not to use any classified
material that he acquired in his capacity as Task Force Director. Elliff
has discussed this matter with John Heaphy, Assistant Director of the Police
Foundation. Heaphy said the Foundation had no ovjections whatsoever for
his accepting the position with the Senate Select Committee, and he would
be free bo, resume his project after the Committee wor! jas, Gone. ,

” Legal Counsel to Adams Memo
RE: JOHN T, ELLIFF

It should be noted that the Select Committee considered
offering the position to LarrjyBaskir, Counsel to the President's Clemency
_Board.. Mr. Baskir formerly Served as Chief Counsel to Senator Ervin's
Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights, and we had numerous contacts
(. with him in that capacity. Our purpose was to reach some common agreement
oy on privacy legislation that Senator Ervin planned to introduce in the 93rd
Session of Congress. There were numerous meetings with Baskir on the
same subject in the Deputy Attorney General's office. These efforts proved
unsuccessful and after several months we discontinued the discussions.
In our opinion, Mr. Baskir was unwilling to work out apy reasonable
compromise and seemed unsympathetic to the 16e%8{atich concerns of law
enforcement.

It is clear that this is a matter for Professor EMiff to
determine and the Bureau should not express an official opinion. Although
we have not always agreed with his views on intelligence matters, we
have had no occasion to question his objectivity or his integrity as a scholar.
Mr. Miller knows that Professor Elliff enjoys our confidence and it is
our understanding that he offered Elliff the position in order to avoid an
adversary relationship between the Bureau and the Committee.

Professor Elliff said he would make no commitments to
the Senate Committee until he hears from us.

RECOMMENDATION: {
That Pvofecsor Elliff be advised that it would be inappropriate

for us to express an opinion on whether he should accept the appointment
offered by the Senate Select Committee. \

This memorandum reports the results of a meeting
of the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group on Congressional Review of

the Intelligence Community (hereafter referred to as the jatea
Group), held at CIA Headquarters on the afternoon of 3/25/75.

This meeting was chaired by Mr. Colby in his role
as the Director of Central Intelligence, In attendance were
Mr. Philip Buchen, Counsel to the President; the then Deputy aA
AG Laurence Silberman, Associate Deputy AG James Wilderotter; //;
Mr. John Clarke, as well as officials from Defense, Treasury.
National Security Council, Office of Management and Budget, j
and the Energy Research and Development Administration.

The following items of interest were discussed:

Mr. William G. Miller, Staff Director of the Senate
Select Committee (SSC), and the Committee's Counsel, Mr. F.A.0.
Schwarz, III, visited CIA Headquarters to discuss SSC business.
Mr. Miller suggested that a tactic the SSC was considering is
the identification of several key issues that the Committee
could look into in-depth, For example, the SSC might propose
to identify two or three covert actions engaged in by CIA and
examine them in-depth rather than try to cover each and every
covert action CIA might identify. Colby advised that this
appeared to be an encouraging development and possibly each
agency of the Intelligence Community might be asked to provide
a series of key issues from which the Select Committee could »|

Ai

select one or two for an al) pth s GAv (ag HE 3457

The question 40) ssc oR Signing a Secrecy
Agreement is still not settled. The Staff Director raised
some constitutional questions regarding the Secrecy Agreement.
Mr. Schwarz admitted, however, that some type of arrangement=—<
would have to be made to insure that the Intelligence Community
had some protection against unauthorized disclos rdSh DR EIEL
members of the SSC.

Memorandum for Mr. Wannall
RE: SENSTUDY 75

Both Miller and Schwarz accepted the Third Agency
Rule and agreed to abide by it. For the record, the SSC's
interpretation of the Third Agency Rule (which is consistent
with the Intelligence Community) is as follows; Classified
information or material originating in one department shall
not be disseminated outside any other department to which it
has been made available without the consent of the originating
department.

The Security Committee of the United States Intelli-
gence Board (USIB) will meet to develop some ground rules and
standardization for sanitizing documents to be furnished to
the Select Committees,

The question of Intelligence Community personnel being
represented by counsel was discussed. The position of the White
House on this issue has been fully reported in a memorandum from
the Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams, dated 3/27/75, entitled "Senate
Select Committee on Intelligence Activities, Rodney Hills
Associate Counsel to the President."

It was also agreed at the meeting of 3/25/75 that the
President's Counsél would attempt to negotiate with the SSC to
insure that all interviews of Intelligence Community personnel
would be conducted on the premises of the bureau, agency or
department employing the persons to be interviewed.

Attached also for the record are the following:

A letter dated 3/20/75 from Staff Director William G.
Miller to Mr. John Clarke advising that Mr. Ben Marshall has been
designated as the Security Officer of the SSC;

A letter dated 3/17/75 from Mr, Miller to Mr. Clarke
listing employees of the SSC who have been cleared by the
Committee for certification by CIA for access to classified
information up to and including "Top Secret";

A letter from Mr. Miller to Mr. Clarke dated 3/20/75

advising that Mr. Ben Marshall was cleared for access to
classified information up to and including "Top Secret";
