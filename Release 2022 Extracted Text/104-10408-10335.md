1, The. fo, in ery tomusie L813 ton between Sub-
ject and Olga P ERRER is brought to your attention for pos-
sible discussion with the FBI.

2. Beginning in April of this year the FBI has submitted
investigati Tts on one Olga Prjevalinskiy FERRER,
sor of Russian at Louisiana State Universit
2 few Orleans, Mrs, FERRER, twice divorced, was born in France
°F > spent her oarly childhood in Russia, came to the United
States from France in 1949 and became a naturalized Aserican
citizen in 1955, The FBI's interest in Mrs. FERRER was appar-
ently generated by a phone call she made to the Sovict Embassy
in Washington sonetime prior to 29 January 1963, at which time
she requested information concerning the possibility of Aneri-
can students and teachers travelling in the Soviet Union at re-
duced rates, Considerable background information on Mrs.
FERRER has been made available by the FBI, covering her period
of residence in the United States,

3. Independéntly of the FBI investigations, Mexico City
station reported that one Olga P. FERRER rented an apartment in
that city in August of this year and had arrived there as of
2 September. On that day she was in telephone contact with
Nikolay Sergeyevich LEONOV, an Assistant Cultural Attache and
Third Secretary at the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City and a
long-time KGB officer. She made arrangements to meet with
LEONOV later tho same day. Prior to returning. to New Orleans
on 17 September, Mrs, FERRER was in attendance at sessions of
the Thirteenth International Philosophy Congress being held
at the time in Mexico City, and she was observed to be in con-
tact with several other Soviets.

4. No conclusions have been reached by the FBI as
to the nature or extent of Mrs, FERRER's involvement with
communism or the Soviet Union. From the information pros-
ently available, however, it appears to this Office that
she is at least a Soviet “sympathizer, if not a recruited
agent. On the hasis of several gaps and inconsistencies
in her pre-1949 background, we have been investigating the
possibility that she could even be a Sovict illegal, While
there is nothing specific by which Mrs, FERRER could be con-
nected with Subject's case, we feel that certain items of
information, obtained through the investigations of the F3I
and Mexico City Station, arc of interest in light of the
revelation in the newspapers of certain background infor-
nation on Subject. We note especially the following:

a) Mrs. FERRER's rosidonce in New Orleans.
Subject, evidently spent considerable tine there.)
tevidentiy spent

b) The fact that Mrs. FERRER's uncle, one
Boris S. DE MERING, who has had a mail address
in Shreveport, Louisiana, since the early 1940's
and who is associated with an oil company there,
actually resides in Houston, Texas,

c) Mrs. FERRER's trip to Mexico City. She .
returned from there on 17 Septembor and Subject
went there on 26 September.

d) Mrs. FERRER's occupation as a professor.
The “Fair Play for Cuba Committee", of which Sub-
ject was reportedly a member, was evidently made
up largely of students and "intellectual" types.

e) Nikolay Sergeyevich LEONOV's actual status
as a KGB officer. Subject also was in contact
with another KGB officer in Mexico City. Of
further interest in this regard is LEQNOV's back-
ground, flis personal calling card was found in
the possessicn of Fidel CASTRO at the time of the
latter's arrest in Mexico in 1956, LRONOV at that
time was an employee at the Soviet Embassy in... -
Mexico City. We departed shortly thereafter and,
with the exception of a trip to Cuba with MIKOYAN

. in 1960, presumably remained in the USSR until the

summer of 1961, whon he returned PCS to Mexico
City. In the spring of this year, at the time
of CASTRO's visit to the USSR, LEONCV went on
home leave. While there he was photographed
several tines in the coapany of CASTRO and
KHRUSIICHEV, and supposedly served as CASTRO'S
interpreter, LEONOV's principal task in
Mexico City has been the smuggling of arms to
insurgent groups in Latin America, especially
Guatemala.

£) The fact that Mrs. FERRER's 18-year old
daughter, Marisol, is working in a Trench
Quarter night club in New Orleans and was at one
time reportedly associated with a group of juven-
files who were using ‘dope. In this regard we note
the fact that Jack RUBY was the owner of at least
two night clubs in Dallas and apparently has had
connections with organized crime.
