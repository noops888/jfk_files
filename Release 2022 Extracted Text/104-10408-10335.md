Lowing very tenuous connection between sub-

201-734815

ject and Olga PIERRER is brought to your attention

for pos-

sible discussion with the FBI.

Beginning in April of this year the FBI has subuitted

several investigative reports on one Olga prjevalinstly FERRER,

La professor of russian and spanish at Louisiana State University

-In 1912,

In 19H2, spent her Carly chilahood In russia,

divorced, was born in France

came to the United

States from France in

1949 and became a naturalized Anerican

citizen in 1955.

The FBI's interest in MTS. FERRER was appar-

ently generated by a phone call she made to the Soviet Embassy

can students and teachers travelling in the Soviet Union at re-

duced rates.

Considerable background information on Mrs.

FERRER has been made available by the FBI, covering her period

of residence in the Unitod States.

Independently of the FBI investigations, Mexico City

station reported that

one Olga P. FERRER ronted

that city in August of this year and had arrived there as

2 September. On

that day sho was in telephone contact with

Nikolay Sergeyevich LEONOV

an Assistant Cultural Attache and

Third Secretary at the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City and a

long-time KGB officer.

tact with several other soviots.

No conclusions have been reached by the fol as

to the naturo or oxtent of les; FeRRER's involvement with

connunism or the Soviet Union.

Fron the information pros-

ently available, however, it appoars to this Office that

she is at least a Soviet sympathizer, if not a recruited

agent.

On the hasis of several gaps

and inconsistencies

even be a soviet illegal.

there is nothing spocific by which Mrs. FERRER could be con-

nected with Subject's case, we feel that certain items of

obtained through the investigations of the FBI

and Mexico City Station, aro of interest in light of the

revelation in

the newspapers of certain background infor-

nation on Subject.

He note especially the following:

a) MTS. FERRER's rosidonce in New Orleans.

Subject, evidently spent considerable time there

b) The fact that MTS. FERRER's uncle, one

BOIIS SO DE MERING,

who has had a mail address

in Shroveport, Louisiana,

since the early 1940's

and tho is associated with

company there,

actually resides in Houston, Texas.

c) Mrs. FERRER's trip to Mexico City..

She-

returnod from there on 17

Septembor and

Subject

went thero on 26 September.

d) MiTs. FERRER's occupation as a professor.

The "Fair Play for Cuba

Committee", of which Sub-

ject was reportedly a nember

was evidently made

up largely of students and "intellectual" types.

e) Nikolay Sergeyevich LEONOV's actual status

as a KGB officer.

Subject also was in contact

with another KCB officer in Mexico City.

further interest in this regard is LEONOV's back-

lis personal calling card was found in

the possession of Fidel CASTRO at the time of the

latter's arrest in Mexico in 1956.

LFONOV at that

time was an employee at the Soviet Embassy in

Mexico City.

sunner of 1961, whon he returned PCS to Mexico

City.

the spring

of this year,

at the time

of CASTRO's visit to the USSR, LEONOV

went on

home loave.

While there he was photographed

several times in the coapany of CASTRO and

KHRUSTICHEV, and supposedly served as CASTRO's

interpreter.

LEONOV's principal task in

Mexico City has been the smuggling of arns to

insurgent groups in Latin America, espocially

Guatemala.

f) The fact that Mrs. FERRER's 18-year old

daughter, Marisol,

is working in a french

quarter night club in New Orleans and

was

at one

time reportedly associated with a group

of juven-

iles who were using dope.

In this regard we note

the fact that Jack RUBY

was the owner

of at least

two night clubs in Dallas and apparently has had

connections with organized crime.
