SUBJECT: Corments on Book V of the Final Report of the U.S. Senate
Select Cormittee to Study Governmental Operations with
Respect to Intelligence Activities
1. Book V of the SSC Final Report, titled The Investigation

of the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy: Performance of the

Intelligence Agencies, presents a number of issues that address thenselves
to the conscience of the Agency. The criticisms of CIA are based on a
series of presentations of how various investigative leads were handled,
and on the non-reporting of various Agency operational activities that
the SSC Final Report judges to have been relevant to the Warren
Commission inquiry.

2.  Astated thesis of the SSC Final Report {s that the operations

of the intelligence agencies against Cuba exercised a negative influence i

‘on the quality of their support for the Warren Commission investigation.

The following statements appear in the Report: ,
“It (the SSC Report) places particular
emphasis on the effect their Cuban opera-
tions seemed to have on the investigation.”
Page 2.
“They (senior CIA officials) should have
realized that CIA operations against Cuba,
particularly operations invotving the
assassination of Castro, needed to be con-
sidered in the investigation. Yet, they
directed their subordinates to conduct
an investigation without telling them of

these vital facts.“ Page 7.



CONFIDENTIAL

The significance of these statements, to the authors of the SSC

Report, is highlighted as follows:
"Certainly, concem with public reputation, 1
problems of coordination between agencies, d
‘possible bureaucratic failure and embarrassment, i
and the extreme compartmentation of knowledge
of sensitive operations may have contributed to ce i
these shortcomings. But the possibility
exists that senior officials in both agencies
made conscious decisions not to disclose
potentially important information." Page 7.

A central feature of the rationale is the concept that if Castro

had learned of these activities it would have provoked him into

ee

retaliation against President Kennedy. The SSC Final Report makes

ft
e

it clear that it feels this theory should have been perceived and
accepted at the time by the intelligence agencies (not to mention
the Warren Commission) leading to a review of the various anti-Castro

programs to see what it might reveal.

The provocation theory, in the specific form postulated by the
SSC Final Report and the press, is of more recent vintage than the
perceptions that prevailed in 1964 when the Warren Commission was con-
ducting its investigation. There was a general concern in 1964 that
the USSR or Cuba might be behind the assassination of President

Kennedy. This was based on a more broadly recognized understanding
of the tensions that existed between the Kennedy administration and the
Soviet and Cuban regimes. The Bay of Pigs in 1961 and the Cuban
Missile Crisis in 1962 must have appeared remarkably provocative to
Fidel Castro, along with the array of American anti-Cuban programs.
The humiliation of the USSR in having to retreat in the Cuban Missile
Crisis cannot be dismissed completely as to how it might have been
perceived by a foreign power as a provocation. To note these events
serves only to remind the reader of the tensions well recognized at
the time. The SSC Final Report has elected to emphasize instead CIA
operational activity against Cuba as requiring specific attention.
This emphasis on CIA's Cuban operations as a possible source of
provocation of Castro represents. the result of an evolution in percep-
tions. In response to it we undertook an extensive review of the
various operational activities against Cuba and Castro.
Organization for the Review

As there are no persons now in CIA who were directly involved
at a senior level in the investigation of 1964, it was felt necessary
to organize a fresh approach to the matter. The persons who, in 1963
and 1964, knew the details of the various operational activities are
no longer available, for the most part, to provide the current and
detafled factual familiarity that existed at the time of the investi-
gations. Primary reliance had to be placed instead on the records for



“a

the period preceding President Kennedy's death and the period following
it.

It was determined that a special research effort would be mounted
to review those Agency files that might relate to this problem. The
organization for this research is summarized at Tab A of this paper.

It required not only the meticulous review of all Cuban operations,

it necessitated careful analysis of the content and nature of the oper-
ations with special attention to their security. Files relating to the
Warren Commission inquiry were reviewed as well as those relating to
plotting against Castro.

The results of the efforts of those assigned to the task are
contained in this covering report and in the separate annexes to it,
Tabs B through G.

CIA has now conducted such a review -- looking at "the other end"
of a possible chain of evidence, where things theoretically could have
started. This has produced no new evidence bearing on the assassination,
although it has produced the basis for new Jines of speculation. In
fact, the review sometimes seemed to become a futile exercise in trying
to fit facts to the provocation theory rather than being able to
identify evidence actually bearing on the assassination of President
Kennedy. The emphasis sometimes became one of asking if this activity

CONFIDENTIAL

(whichever was under review) could have provoked Castro to order the
assassination of President Kennedy, had he (Castro) learned of it.
The SSC, in its Final Report, fell into this very trap, trying to make
the AMLASH operation actually fit the theory for which the SSC's
presentation seemed to be tailored. (See Tab D.)

We have looked at other operational activities with the SSC's

theory in mind, but have been unable to provide tangible substance

in support of the theory. In the final analysis the reviewer is

compelled to fall back on the evidence. A wide variety of theories
can be--as they have been--advanced in strident and challenging tones.
Not all of them are susceptible to conclusive answers; the primary
possibility of finding such answers was lost with the death of Lee
Harvey Oswald. The fact is that the Warren Commission considered the
possibility of Cuban or Soviet involvement, but could not find evi-
dence of it. Were it known at the time of the Warren Commission, it
would have been reported and dealt with then; that it was not is a
simple reflection of the fact that it did not exist at that time in
the minds of Americans knowledseable on the subject. To hold dif-
ferently would be to accept uncritically a social paranoia often
prevalent today, which would hold that a significant number of
government employees could engace in such a well-disciplined con-

spiracy to suppress evidence.

Operations Against Castro

The AMTRUNK Operation, starting in 1963, sought to develop a
capability to join dissident elements among the Cuban leadership into
a group that could oust the Castro regime. It was conceived by Cuban
exiles and sold to the Kennedy Administration, which assigned it to
CIA. The program was very slow in developing substance and momentum,
with little concrete progress during President Kennedy's life. Ata
later date, in 1965, it was believed to be cocpromised and CIA withdrew
from its association; the key members were arrested later and tried in
Cuba. There are basic questions about the security of the activity
from its inception, due to the involvement of personalities who are
suspected of having pro-Cuban sympathies, including possibly having
been foreign agents. While the suspicions cannot be verified, the
reservations are sufficiently basic to consider the possibility that
Castro knew of the operation from its earliest days. Its long range
objectives--the overthrow of Castro and his regime--would have been an
irritant to Castro; its inability to develop any substance and momentum
until long after President Kennedy's death suggests that it {s unlikely
that it, of itself, would have moved him at that time to resort to
assassination in retaliation. This is discussed at Tab C.

Operation AMLASH centered on a high-level Cuban official, AMLASH/1,
who had expressed his opposition to Castro and to the Castro regime.
The SSC Final Report undertakes to demonstrate that the operation planned
Castro's assassination during the period preceding the murder of



g

TNE ere

President Kennedy; to the contrary, a full review of the operation \
shows that prior to the President's assassination not only had CIA

not agreed to give any support to AMLASH/1, but had rejected his
proposals to assassinate Castro. When evidence supporting this view
was offered the drafters of Book V of the SSC Final Report, it was
dismissed out of hand as false, despite confirming evidence. The SSC
Report, instead, having asserted that assassination was the character
of the operation at that time, then undertook to show that AMLASH/T

was at least indiscreet in his conduct, risking exposure of the plot.
Alternatively, it suggested that he may have been acting for Castro

as a provocateur, to lead the United States into a plot against
Castro's life which in, turn was then to provide Castro with the
justification to order President Kennedy's assassination. In either
event, had Castro learned about the relationship between AMLASH/1 and
CIA he would have known only that there was an ‘inconclusive association
that certainly had not progressed to the point that it constituted the
basis for the postulated provocation. This is discussed in some detail
at Tab D of this paper.

The SSC Final Report discounts (at page 68) the possibility that
actual plotting by CIA with the criminal syndicate served as a source
for provocation for Castro to have President Kennedy murdered. There
are new considerations that developed in the course of the present
review that throw more light on the role of the criminal syndicate,
but they do not provide a basis.for taking issue with the judgment of
the SSC Final Report, which dismissed the activity as having provided
Castro with the postulated provocation. This is discussed at Tab C.

Itums Selected by the SSC for Critical Cumnent

The SSC Final Report picked out a number of selected subjects for
treatment in support of its criticism of the thoroughness of the in-
vestigation by the intelligence agencies. One of these had to do with
the allegations in Mexico City by a man designated as "D". These al-
legations were demonstrated conclusively by the Warren Comission to.
have been false; why they are discussed at all in the SSC Final Report
is a question in itself. In another instance, reference is made to a

reported five-hour delay of a Cubana flignt from Mexico City, awaiting

Cuban-American who departed on another Cubana flight, the FBI investi-
Gated the man extensively, as is revealed by the information available
for use in the SSC Final Report; a single report that caused him to be
dramatized is so full of errors as to be highly suspect, essentially

being placed in doubt by cther evidence in the record. In another :
instance considerable emphasis was given by the SSC Final Report to a ;
cable*from the Mexico City Station, replying to a 23 November 19834in-
quiry from CIA headquarters asking for reports on contacts with certain
named Soviets. The true name of wun was given in the Mexico City
reply, but not as having had contact with the Soviets -- which was the
Purpose of the inquiry -- but as the subject of a meeting in December

1960 between a functionary of the Cuban embassy with a Soviet, concern-

and March 1961. AMLASH/1's name could have been omitted from the cable
altogether, so far as its having any relevance to the inquiry about.
persons having contact with Soviets is concerned. In any event, the
meeting in December 1960 was prior to President Kennedy's inauguration,
which removes it yet, further from any possible relevance to the subject
matter. It really is not difficult to understand why the reference to
AMLASH/1's name did not lead to detailed research about him. This is
discussed further at Tab D.

Conclusions

Basically, the research effort for the present paper produced two
general conclusions. First, the SSC Final Report contains numerous
factual errors, both in the extensive treatment of a selected opera-
tion (AMLASH) and in a number of separate incidents that it presents.
Second, while one can make the point in principle that the Warren
Commission could well have broadened its review to include the anti-
Cuban programs of the U.S. Government, in trying to make the case for
that concept Book V of the SSC Final Report went to such lengths in its
treatment as to detract from the point at hand. It is difficult to
characterize it more generously.

In a very real sense, the SSC Final Report has compounded the
problem of public perception. On a flawed presentation it has accused
the intelligence agencies of derelictions and worse. While it has
reinforced the public sense of unfinished business yet to be done, it
has so badly beclouded the issue as to have done a disservice to

| CONFIDENT

ef


CONFESS

future attempts at objective and dispassionate inquiry.

While one can understand today why the Warren Commission limited
{ts inquiry to normal avenues of investigation, it would have served
to reinforce the credibility of its effort had it taken a broader
view of the matter. CIA, too, could have considered in specific
terms what most saw then in general terms--the possibility of Soviet
or Cuban involvement in the assassination because of tensions of
the time. It is not enough to be able to point out erroneous
criticisms made today. The Agency should have taken broader
initiatives then, as well. That CIA employees at the time felt--as
they obviously did--that the activities about which they knew had
fio relevance to the Warren Commission inquiry does not take the place
of:a record of conscious review. The present research effort has
undertaken to conduct such a review; it is noted that the findings
are essentially negative. However, it must be recognized that CIA
cannot be as" conf ident of a cold trail in 1977 as it could have
been in 1964; this apparent fact will be noted by the critics of
the Agency, and by those who have found a career in the questions
already asked and yet to be asked about the assassination of
President Kennedy.

Organization for and Conduct of the Review

1. Many years have passed since the inquiry by the Warren Com-

mission. The persons who were most familiar with the activities
of the Agency during the period preceding the death of President H
Kennedy, and during the investigation of the Warren Commission, are i

no longer in place in the same work. Some of the employees have

retired or have been transferred to other work. Some have died.

2. To respond to the questions raised in Book V of the ssc
Final Report, it was necessary to review old files and to assign to

this undertaking personnel not really familiar with the activities
of the Agency during a period of a dozen or more years before. A

study group was established to consider the size of the problem and

to develop a plan for conducting the review. Chaired by a repre-
sentative from the Office of the Inspector General, the group also i.
consisted of members from CI Staff, LA Division, and the Office of |
Security. Terms of Reference for the review were agreed upon in |

"early August 1976. Points emphasized for the review, because of the

thrust of Book V of the SSC Final Report, were (1) to conduct @ full
review of information and operations on the Cuban target to identify
any activity that might relate to the assassination of President Kennedy,

and (2) to review the possibility that CIA activities against Cuba i

did, by thefr nature, cause Castro to order the assassination of ‘

President Kennedy. A copy of the Terms of Reference is attached.

3. The two main holdings of files for the period in question
were in LA Division and CI Staff, of the Directorate of Operations,
with less voluminous files being held in the Office of Security and
the Office of the Inspector General. The organization for the review
of those files is described below.

4. LA Division: LA Division was the repository of the files
for Agency operations conducted against Cuba. These files were known
to be extensive. Under the Terms of Reference those files for the
period 1 January 1961 to 1 January 1965 were selected for review,
covering a three-year period prior to the death of President Kennedy
and the following year. A research group was formed composed of :
five full-time researchers, a group leader and a task force supervisor.
An additional four researchers participated in different phases of
the research, which continued to mid-May 1977.

5. Reference to material for this research was obtained from
the LA Division registry, the Cuba Desk machine runs, and a special
comprehensive file listing prepared for this purpose by Information
Services Staff (ISS). On the basis of this it was originally believed
that material pertinent to the search would number approximately 900
operational folders, plus numerous related 201-files. It was later
determined, however, that a thorough review should include additional
operational and subject files which brought the total to well over
two thousand files. In view of the date of the material, much of it,

both operational and subject, had been retired to Archives at
Warrenton, Virginia. The remainder is held at Headquarters in the
files or archival material of Information Processing Group. This
material is easily retrievable through the use of specific job
numbers and file reference numbers recorded and retained in the
LA Division research group files (too numerous to cite herein).

6. Following is a breakdown of the types and numbers of files
reviewed, criteria employed in the research, the findings, and
organization of the material:

brought to its attention by the IG Staff, on an ad hoc basis,
and to additional questions raised in the course of the
study. A name trace was always run, and/or the 201-file was
reviewed, if available, on any individual allegedly involved
in an assassination plot against President Kennedy or Fidel
Castro. This task was made somewhat easier as the result of
a memorandum prepared by the Cuba Desk, in August 1975,
based on traces of the names in the so-called Black Book
that Fidel Castro passed to Senator McGovern, which dealt
with individuals the Cubans alleged were involved in assassi-
nation attempts against Castro.
c. Findings and Organization of the Findings

Each researcher submitted a draft paper noting the
sudject of the folder(s) reviewed, a brief description of the
activity, and a copy of those document(s) or findings which
contained information believed to be pertinent to the review.
Also included were job numbers, official file numbers,
inclusive dates of material researched, and the number of

. volumes reviewed. Beginning in January 1977, at the request

of the IG Staff, the researchers also began noting FBI and/or
other government agencies knowledge of information, to the
extent recorded in Agency files. Separate finished memoranda
were prepared, on the basis of these data, including the
heading Findings. This heading lists the specific document
number(s) and otter pertinent data, and a few lines providing

the gist of the document(s) for purpose of easy and quick

reference. These memoranda, with a copy of the document(s)

attached, are filed in alphabetical order, by project and
subject, in hard-back green folders as part of the official

LA Division research group files under the official classi-

fication number 019-604-001 (Volumes XI through XX). Also

included in the records are two folders (Volumes IX and X)

containing 1,439 draft memoranda with negative findings.

These records are restricted in LA Division.

7. The LA Division research effort proved to be far more
complex than originally estimated. - Research continued to.lead to new
files, and the requirements. for meticulous analysis and correlation
of material further extended the time required to complete the under-
taking. By completing this exhaustive review of files the Agency
can speak with considerable confidence as to what the records of
Cuban operations show, so far as they relate to the question of the
death of President Kennedy.

8. CI Staff: CI Staff assigned one senior officer to review
its files on Lee Harvey Oswald, working under the general Terms of
Reference referred to above, and also to generate papers on points
not covered by the guidelines but pertinent to the general subject.

9. Since December 1963, the CI Staff has served as the point.

Agency's role in the investigation conducted by the Warren Com-

mission. The so-called "Oswald File" now fills 57 volumes comprising

some 142 file folders and portfolios. In addition, the Staff has
accumulated some 50 supplemental files including the master copy
: of those documents released under provisions of the FOIA to the public
i in March 1976 (first sertes) and those documents (second series) ‘
H released in Septenber 1976 and March 1977.”
10. By necessity the documents in the file are held in chrono-
i logical order; however, the file has become much more than just a i
i chronological file on Lee Harvey Oswald. It has now become the
Agency's central repository for information and documentation that
it holds on:
a. The life of Harvey Oswald;
b. The Agency's role in the investigation conducted i
by the Warren Commission, 1963--1964; :
¢. The testimony by various Agency officers before
a the several commissions and comittees set up to review i
q the validity of previous investigations. (NB: It should :
be pointed out that this portion of this file is not .
complete); and :

11. In order to come to grips with the voluminous material in
the Oswald files, ft soon became obvious that, in order to be in
& position to respond effectively and expeditiously to the Terns of
Reference and to allegations and accusations in Book V of the SSC
Final Report, it would be necessary to copy much of the file and to
Place these copies in folders set up according to general and specific
subjects. In order to check charges that this Agency had withheld
information from the FBI and the warren Commission, and that there
was "no evidence that the FBI asked the Agency to conduct an investi-
gation or gather information," the following files were set up:
a. Correspondence from the Warren Commission;
b. Correspondence from the Agency to the Warren
Commission;
c. Agency disseminations to the Intelligence Community,
particularly the FBI;
d. Correspondence from the FBI to the Agency requesting
assistance and information;
e. Chronological summary of information on and actions
taken relating to Silvia Tirado de OURAN; and
f. Chronological summary of information on and actions
taken relating to Gilberto ALVARADO Ugarte. :
These files provided a basis for checking statements included in the
(=) SSC Final Report and to determine what the Agency actually did do
- in relation to the Warren Comuission inquiry.

12. The approach to the problem at hand was to assemble by i
chronological and statistical compilations the Agency's record on :
the matter, (a) its initiation of collection requirements for infor-

the Warren Commission. Certain parts of the record were summarized
to record what actually happened in those instances in which it

TERMS OF REFERENCE
FOR REVIEW OF
ISSUES RAISED IN
BOOK V, SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE

FINAL REPORT

1. The Schweiker Subcommittee nas two basic theses--
(1) the general idea that the intelligenée cormmunity~-primarily
CIA and FBI--did not undertake a full review of the possibility
of Cuban involvement in the assassination of President Kennedy,
and (2) the idea that CIA activities against Cuba were provocative
and may have led to the assassination of President Kerredy. The
former by itself is not too difficult a problem to address. Either
there was or there was not an extensive intelligence collection
program to ascertain all possible information on the subject.
Either there was or there was not an exhaustive review ofall
information in the Agency that might in some way relate to this
question. Either the Agency did or did not report what it had
to the Warren Commission for further inquiry and review.

2. The second portion of the Subcommittee's presentation
is somewhat more diffuse and complex. By way of general back-
ground it summarizes Agency and U.S. operations against Castro's
Cuba. There is an inference--almost subliminal--that these
general activities were provocative. More specific, however,
ig the detailed treatment of the AMLASH operation as an activity
that the report suggests could have provoked Castro into retaliatory
action against President Kennedy. The failure of CIA te report
this to the Warren Commission, in the context of the provocation
theory, is advanced as a failure to report relevant information.
Detailed treatment of the operation is given in the report in
support of the thesis.

3. The issue of operational activity that could have provoked
a retaliatory strike by Castro against President Kennedy cannot
be restricted to the AMLASH operation, In itself it may be one of
the poorer examples of something that might have proven so pro-
vocative as to stimulate a retaliatory strike by Castro against
President Kennedy. There were other operations with the un-
qualified objective of killing Castro, These contrast with the
AMLASH affair in which the agreed purpose was not so clear and
in which the sequence of events throws considerable doubt on the
Subcommittee's treatment of the activity in this respect.

a. The following questions are intended to serve as
a guide in a records review of the extent of the Agency's
investigation prior to the end of the Warren Commission.

(2) What collection requirements were issued to
the field with regard to Kennedy's assassination?

(2) What follow-up of these requirements was
there during 1964?

(3) What form did the follow-up take?

(4) Identify and describe the records with regard
to this activity.

(5) What reporting was there from the field in

response to Headquarters! requirements?
i °

(6) What dissemination and review was this
reporting given?

(7) Was dissemination made on this reporting to
the Cl Staff?

(8) Was this reporting given to the Warren Commission?

(9) What review of Headquarters! material was
ordered through 1964?



(10) What werethe parameters of these instructions?

(11) What responses were there and where are they?

i (12) What evidence is there that the "provocation"
theory was considered during the Warren Commission

enquiries, either in CIA or the Warren Commission? bs

(13) What action was taken with reference to this :
concept as a basis for reviewing relating Agency programs? :

(14) What records are there on this and where are they? i

Oswald/Cuban connection? : :

(16) What form did they take? '

(17) What exchanges were there with the FBI on this
subject?

(18) What action developed from these exchanges?

(19) What records are there on these exchanges and
where are they?

(20) To what extent were elements of the Agency
other than the CI Staff and LA Division involved im in-
vestigating the assassination during the Warren Commission
tenure?

(21) What is the total CIA information on the two
flights from Mexico City to Havana?

(22) What was done at the time to develop further i
information on this matter? !

assassination policies and programs up to November 22,

(33) Does the testimony before the SSC of CIA
employees contain anything on the above questioas?
If so, what?

b. On the subject of possible provocation for the
assassination plots against Castro, each of the known ‘activities
should be reviewed to the extent possible in order to determine
any additional relevant information on this plot.

(1) What is the total information on the plots involving
the criminal syndicates?

(2) Who was witting of the planning for the syndicate
operation? a

(3) Are there current considerations on the syndicate
operation not faced previously (e.g., a former Office
of Security ofiicer may have knowledge that was rot
surfaced in the interviews with him with the SSC or
Agency personnel. Additionally, a former LA Division
career agent may have some insights that could throw
light on one of the operatioas),

(4) There are a couple of cases based on agent
traffic (reported to the SSC during the study of alleged
assassination plots) indicating plans during the Bay of
Pigs period to shoot Castro, What is the total CLA
information on these? :

(5) What is the significance on the subject of
Provocation in the book given Senator McGovern by
Castro?

(6) While the AMLASH operation is subject to fairly
detailed reconstruction from a very complete record,
there are points that should be addressed particclarly,
because of their treatment in the SSC Subcommittee report.
For instance, is there significance in the fact that CIA
contacted AMLASH/1 in September 1963 after such a
long time? Or was it simply that this was the first time
the opportunity had presented itself since earlier meetings?

(7) Just what did the case officer tell AMLASH/1

when making plans for the 22 November meeting? af

(8) What was the security of the relationship with
AMLASH/I during the period preceding the assassination
of President Kennedy? ‘

(9) In what time frame was Fitzgerald's Executive
Officer speaking when he stated his judgment that the
AMLASH/1 operation was an assassination plot?



¢. What other action might CIA have taken in coanection
with the investigation? An effort should be made to list
these, including consultation with survi: ing officials to
determine not only what they considered the requirement
at the time, but what was omitted and why.

4. In conclusion, these "Terms of Reference" undertake
to address the entire question of possible Provocation of U.S,
policy and CIA programs in the period Preceding the assassination
of President Kennedy. An aspect of this is the SSC Subcommittee's
apparent view that CIA assassination plotting could have instigated
: a retaliatory strike by Castro against President Kennedy, which,
3 therefore, should have been reported to the Warren Commission,
Just as importantly, the final paper sMould reflect findinys in the
area of what the Agency did in response to Warren Commission
requirements (both stated by the Warren Commission and those
that could have been conceived by the Agency), and how it pursued
these lines of action and reported them to the Commission, This
will include consideration of specific new and unansw
raised in the Schweiker report

CIA PERFORMANCE ON THE INQUIRIES \



aePoueehaensse ue WORE SRY SL RRM. at nine nencermcnemee|

CONFIDENTIAL

CIA's Performance on the Inquiries

Book V of the SSC Final Report challenges the performance of the
intelligence agencies during the Warren Commission inquiry, empha-
sizing things that it feels should have been done but which it asserts

were not.
It is correct to say that CIA has not produced evidence or

analysis that addresses every theory that has been advanced over the
years. A record of the volume of CIA reporting to the FBI and the
Warren Commission is at Tab E. As a practical consideration, every
theoretical question that can be conceived cannot be answered con-
clusively; there simply may be no evidence at all, or if there is
evidence somewhere it may not be accessible. The issue is what the
intelligence agencies did -- in the present instance, what was the
performance of CIA -- with Book V of the SSC Final Report portraying
a patter of neglect or avoidance that is not supported by the record.
The SSC Final Report offers a number of separate subjects in

support of its case:
a. It refers to an allegation by a person identified as

“D" (pages 28-30, 41-42 and 102-103) that he overheard and

saw Oswald being handed money in Mexico City for the purpose
of assassinating President Kennedy; this was proven false, both
by polygraph and by determining that Oswald was in New Orleans
instead of Mexico City at the time the incident was supposed to
have occurred. This subject is treated fn a confusing and in-

conclusive manner in the SSC Final Report.

b. A considerable portion of the Report is given to the
AMLASH operation. The operation is described inaccurately.

The Report assigns it characteristics that it did not have during
the period preceding the assassination of President Kennedy, in
order to support the SSC view that it should have been reported
to the Warren Commission. This is treated in some detail at Tab D

of this report. See separate folder: -

c. Space is devoted to two aircraft flights from Mexico “Unidentified Air Pas
. ger" ;
City to Havana, on 22 November and 27 November (see pages 60- aie ‘
a ee
63). The first of these flights, as described in the SSC Report, 7 i
is based on an inaccurate report about a delay of the 22 November
flight to meet a mysterious private aircraft; the correct story
removes the basis for the inferences of the SSC version. The
second of these flights had to do with a man whose significance

arises from a patently erroneous report; the FBI investigated him

: thoroughly, as is apparent from the condensed summary in the SSC
3 ; Final Report. ,

These examples iNustrate the problem of commenting on the SSC Final i
Report, the question becoming that of how to deal with Congressional '
criticism presented on the basis of inaccurate factual perceptions. i‘
To treat the problem it was felt necessary to review the record in-depth
and to report the findings, whatever they are. i

g Recognizing the possibility of error or oversight in 1964--both

to courses of action CIA might have taken to throw some light on the

questions as understood at the time, as well as considering those
questions that have developed since then. What would be the areas of
inquiry? Oswald was an obvious subject of investigation.

Oswald was known to have been out of the country twice subsequent
to his return to private life from the Marine Corps in September 1959.
These overseas adventures were appropriate for CIA attention. The

first of these overseas trips was when he went to the Soviet Union in

October 1959 from which he returned in June 1962. The second of these

trips was when he went to Mexico City in late September 1963, from
which he returned in early October 1963.

In addition to these two areas of obvious specific inquiry for CIA,
there is the problem of general foreign intelligence collection that
might in some way produce information on the subject. The SSC Final
Report adds to these considerations overations being conducted by CIA
as part of a general U.S. program against the Castro regime. These
four general areas of inquiry are covered below.

1. Travel to and from the USSR 1959-1962

On 26 November 1963 a cable“was sent to Paris, Rome, Madrid,

Copenhagen, Oslo, Helsinki, Brussels, The Hague, London, and Ottawa
giving biographic information on Lee Harvey Oswald. It noted his
discharge from the Harine Corps in September 1959 and his travel to
the Soviet Union in October 1959, including sketchy details as to his
employment and marriage while in the USSR. The cable requested:

On 27 November the various addressee stations repliedt with
Helsinki and Leadon providing additional details on the travel of
Oswald to the USSR. Additionally, Londoit reported that a British
Journalist claimed that during his own imprisonment in Cuba in 1959
there was a U.S. gangster there by the name of Santos, who was living
in luxury in jail because he could not return to the U.S.; the source
stated that Santos was "visited frequently by another American
gangster named ‘Ruby'." (See pages 24-28, Tab C.)

Also on 27 November Cttaws reported the "delight" of the Cuban
Embassy staff over the assassination of President Kennedy although
the staff was instructed to “cease looking happy in public," in
conformance with instructions from Cuba to “govern their actions by
official attitude of Govt to which they accredited." Oslo, on the
same date, reported that the Soviets were shocked, blaming the
assassination on extreme right-wing elements. ‘Otherwise, the initial
responses produced no other information.

On 29 November The Hague and Frankfuré were queried about Oswald's
travel back from the USSR. This query was followed on 2 December by
a similar cable to Berlin, Frankfurt, Bonn and The Hague** Various
Teporting produced details about the travel of Oswald and his wife
from the USSR through Germany and the Netherlands enroute to the
United States in June 1962.

The other stations involved in these inquiries had no traces or

information on Oswald; liaison services were also queried without

detailed results although there were some technical operations that
produced peripheral information about the reactions of various groups
under intelligence surveillance. Considerable exchanges were held
with the Warren Commission on Oswald's Soviet record and its possible
significance. No evidence was found tying the Soviet Union to Oswald
assassination of President Kennedy. Bock V of the SSC Final Report,
in not criticising the Agency's performance in this aspect of the
investigation, seems to have accepted it as adequate, and it will
not be detailed here.
Il. Oswald Mexico Visit -- September-October_1963

The visit by Oswald to Mexico City, in his attempt to get
visas for travel to the Soviet Union and Cuba, has received extensive
attention. The details concerning the coverage of Oswald's visit to

Mexico is treated in another annex to this paper (Tab F). The concern
felt by all initially for the possible significance of Oswald's visit,

and his contacts with the Cuban and Soviet embassies, was obvious at
the time. The following statement is in a cable to Mexico City*on
28 November 1963:
"We have by no means excluded the possibility
that other as yet unknown persons may have \
been involved or even that other powers may :
have played a role. Please continue all your
coverage of Soviet and Cuban installations
and your liaison with Mexicans."

aa)

The allegations made by “D," about having seen Oswald taking money
from Cubans in the Cuban embassy in Mexico City, received intensive
attention from CIA and the F8I, working together closely on the matter,
and with the Mexican authorities. This was demonstrated conclusively
to have been a false allegation. Oswald was in New Orleans at the
time of the reported incident, and the person making the allegations
was demonstrated by polygraph to have been lying. After the allegations
by "D" had been demonstrated to be false, Headquarters made the following
statement to the Mexico City Station on tDacanbse 19637
“Pls continue to follow all leads and tips. *pre $6064, 30.21.6
The question of whether Oswald acted solely
on his own has gel not been finally resolved.”
Again, on rd December 1963" ‘the Mexico City Station was cabled as

On 17 December 1963 Headquarters’ "forwarded a dispatch to the Mexico

City Station stated as follows:

life, we have not overlooked the really out-

standing performance of Mexico City's major

assets and the speed, precision, and perception

with which the data was forwarded. Here it was

relayed within minutes to the White House,

[Department of State] and [the FBI].

“Your LIENYOY data, the statements of Silvia

DURAN, and your analyses were major factors in

the quick clarification of the case, blanking

out the really ominous spectre of foreign backing.”

Essentially, Oswald's visit to Mexico City was investigated as
thoroughly as possible, producing no evidence there of Soviet or
Cuban complicity in the assassination of President Kennedy. If anything,
events during Oswald's visit there are more subject to being seen as
counter to such a possibility, given his troubles with both Cubans
and Soviets. We do not offer this thought as the final word, but more
simply that if it bears on the subject at all it 1s inconsistent with
speculation that he had some special relationship with either natton.
It is noted that various allegations have been.made in the press

in connection with the House Select Committee on Assassinations

inquiry concerning CIA information regarding Oswald's Mexico visit;

these are commented on at Tab G.
III. General Collection Requirements
On 22 November 1963*a11 CIA stations abroad received a cable”

from Headquarters with the following statement:

“Tragic death of President Kennedy requires all

of us to look sharp for any unusual intelligence

developments. Although we have no reason to

expect anything of a particular military nature,

all hands should be on the quick alert at least

for the next few days while the new President

takes over the reins."

It is appropriate at this point to observe the general reaction

to be expected from such a communication. Without any leads, other
than those arising from Oswald's identification, the requirements to
field stations were necessarily general. General reporting can be
stimulated by general requests, if there is something to report, and
this 1s what was undertaken. In addition, in any event, intelligence
assets and liaison services overseas are quick to realize the signifi-
cance of impertant information and will report it on their own initiative.
It fs significant, in the light of these considerations, that there has
been the most limited reporting on the subject. Were there relevant
or significant information on the subject it would have been reported ~
either in responses to the expression of general interest, or i
Spontaneously, if such information was known to Agency sources. :

If one believes that there was a conspiracy, with Oswald involved,

one must accept the likelihood that his fellow conspirators would not

have shared their knowledge beyond the narrow circle of those directly

involved. Conversely, if there were no conspiracy, there obviously



would be nothing to report in the first place. The absence of concrete

erase 80

in) reporting seems to serve, regardless of which is the case, as the basis

for the apparent SSC view that no collection effort was undertaken.

As has been noted above, there were initial CIA coliection re-

produce must be related to whether there was any information to collect

at all, and if so whether it was accessible. The requirements were issued,

reporting. A reflection of the basic nature of the problem is found in

ecael
the Headquarters Gait ‘to Mexico City on 17 December 1963” (note above)

Oswald's life..." m
The SSC Final Report speaks in rather unqualified terms at page 10
about the resources of the intelligence agencies, including a description
of “an extensive intelligence network in Cuba," suggesting that ft was
only necessary to ask to get. It is correct to say that there were

sources in Cuba able to report on events, such as troop movements, but

there were no penetrations of Castro's inner circle, where any infor-
mation on the subject in question would exist. The distinction apparently
was missed -- or ignored -- by the authors of the SSC Final Report. As
stated by the Miami Chief of Station, quoted at page 58 of the SSC Report:
“Now if you are referring to our capability to conduct
an investigation in Cuba, I would have to say it was

ye limited.”

This does not mean that such assets as there were did not have reporting

~~

requirements tevied on them, in fact, there was considerable activity
in this respect. In the course of the present review a number of case
officers at the Station during that period have described the frenetic
activity in this respect. The characterization by the Chief of Station
as to passive collection by CIA inside the United States should not be
extended to apply to what was done with reporting assets outside the i
United States, as the SSC Final Report attempts to do at the bottom of :
page 58.

The SSC Final Report has undertaken to paint this in very different

terms than the record supports. The extensive reporting to the FBI

and the Warren Commission provides a truer reflection of the level of
activity by CIA (see Tab E), even if its sources did not bear on every an
question that has been conceived since then.

IV "Unpursued Leads"

At pages 60-67, in Sook V of the SSC Final Report, there is a section
that addresses leads that were felt to not have been followed by the

intelligence ayencies. This follows the section on CIA's Performance

on. the Inquiries. This section first addresses two Cubana fVights to
Havana from Mexico City on 22 Novembér (the date of President Kennedy's

murder) and 27 November 1963, raising questions about passengers reported

:

22 and 25 November to Havana were passenger flights, while the one

on 27 November appears to have been essentially a cargo flight, with

one passenger, the man referred to in the SSC discussion. All flights nies
to Havana apparently carried some freight.

CIA conducted regular surveillance of Cubana flights, filing cable ;
reports to Headcucetars. There was one unilateral CIA surveillance : i
team (\TFIRE) that observed errivais and departures of Cubana flights,
yeperting any unusral incidents and providing copies of flight manifests. i
The Mexican authorities also had a surveillance team of its own at the

i
i

airport, which provided photographs of passports and also provided copies”

of passenger ists] Adétttonatty, a telephone tap operation (LIENVOY)

against the Cuban embassy provided transcripts of conversations with

the Cubana office and the Mexican Airport Control | .

The 22 November 1963 Flight ‘ ;

At pages 30, 60, 61 and 103 of Book V of the SSC Final Report,

reference is made to a reported five-hour delay of a Cubana flight from

Mexico City to Havana the evening of President Kennedy's assassination,

22 November 1963. The SSC Report describes the delay as being from

6:00 P.M. EST to 11:00 P.M. EST. The especially intriguing aspect

|

|

of the report was that the reported delay was to await arrival at

10:30 P.M. EST of a private twin-engined aircraft, which deposited

an unidentified passenger who boarded the Cubana aircraft without customs
clearance and traveled to Havana in the pilot's cabin. The SSC Final
Report emphasized CIA's apparent failure to follow up by inquiring

further into the matter.

ar


Ee a

Book V of the SSC Final Report states that CIA could not explain,
at the time of the writing of the SSC Report, why there was no ,ecord
of a follow-up. In fact, the SSC was advised that the Mexican authori-
ties were asked about the reported flight delay, although there was no
recorded response. The current review revealed additional information
from the surveillance noted above, which bears directly on the subject.
In reviewing that information below, it is noted that the conversion
of Mexico City time to Eastern Standard Time (EST) in the SSC Final
Report tends to distort the time Perspective somewhat. Mexico City
times are used in the following discussion.

The LIENVOY transcripts record a series of discussions about the
Status of the 22 November flight--when it was to arrive and when it.
departed. These records show that the flight arrived at the platform
at the airport at 1620 hours: Mexico City time; presumably it landed
a few minutes earlier. At one point prior to arrival of the aircraft,
One person speaking on the telephone stated that the aircraft was due
at 1630 hours and “it will go" at 1730, suggesting a quick turnaround
that would have reduced unloading and loading time, as well as
servicing, to a relatively short period. However, the key report on
the departure of the aircraft was a statement at 2040 hours that the

aircraft had taken off five minutes earlier, i.e., 2035 hours.

The following facts stand out, in contrast to the presentation in
the SSC Final Report:

1. The Cubana flight was on the ground in Mexico City
for a total of four hours and about ten minutes. It was not



4
i

i

delayed five hours, as alleged.

2. The Cubana flight took off at 2035 hours Mexico City
time, 55 minutes ahead of the alleged arrival at 2130 ofa
private flight with a secret passenger. This also contrasts
further with the alleged departure time of the Cubana flight.
which the report stated to be 2200. Actual departure preceded
substantially the reported arrival of the aircraft for which it

allegedly was delayed. aq
In view of the surveillance coverage of the Cubana flight, it is

very doubtful that the alleged activity involving the private twin-
engined aircraft and passenger would have gone unnoticed or unreported
had it occurred. Personnel in Mexico City at the time were aware of
these sources and probably knew the above facts, feeling no need to
follow further.
The report in question was in error, and misled the SSC in its
sumary of the matter. ees ,
The Passenger_on the 27 November 1963 Flight
At pages 61-63 and 104, the SSC Final Report describes in con-
siderable detail information concerning a Cuban-American who came to
the attention of the CIA and the FBI in the period following the
assassination of President Kennedy. The introductory comments of the
SSC Final Report state that:
" . .. one source alleged that the Cuban-American

was ‘involved’ in the assassination.”

13

se res



The SSC Report states that the CIA reported the case to the FBI “almost
{mmediately," but that the Bureau did not conduct a follow-up investi-
gation “as part of (its) work for the Warren Commission." Further
down the same page the SSC Report states that “(t)he FBI did investi-
gate this individual after receiving the CIA report of his unusual
travel." At page 63 the SSC Report observes that "...the suspicious
travel of this individual coupled with the possibility that Oswald had
contacted the Tampa chapter (of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee--FPCC)
certainly should have prompted a far more thorough and timely investi-
gation than the FBI conducted..." We do not know just what the Bureau
did in this respect, nor have we tried to resolve the apparent incon-
sistencies in the SSC Report noted above, but the SSC Final Report
contains considerable detail about the man, presumably reflecting the
results of FBI inquiries.
While this section of the SSC Report is directed primarily at the
FBI, we reviewed the reporting because of CIA's initial role in reporting
about the man. There is also one implicit criticism of CIA, which will
be noted.
Book V of the SSC Final Report has the following summary statement
at page 104, in the chronology section:
"December 5 - Mexico Station cables that someone who
saw the Cuban-American board the aircraft to Havana
on November 27 reported that he ‘looked suspicfous’..."
At page 61 it states that there "is no indication that CIA followed-
up on this report (that the man was “involved in the assassination"),

except to ask a Cuban defector about his knowledge of the Cuban-
American's activities."

The presentation of this matter in the SSC Report contains some
inaccuracies. First, the Mexico City Station did not cable Washington
that the man “looked suspicious." There was a cables dated 5 Decenber
1963, but it reported that the man had "crossed at Laredo, Texas on
23 November," that he registered at a certain hotel in Nexico City at
a certain time on 25 November, that he chetked out of the hotel at a
certain time and departed for Havana “as only passenger on Cubana
flight on night 27 November," and that there was a good photograph of
him taken at the airport. This was followed bya dispatch” the same

date, repeating the basic information in the cable, enclosing the Photo-

graph, and containing the following cryptic statement:
: "Source states the timing and circumstances surrounding
Subject's travel through Mexico and departure for Havana

are suspicious." ¢
This comment is cryptic, at least, and--given that dramatic moment in
history--doubtless reflects a preliminary comment of a person who

was on the alert at that time for anything that might be construed as

Possibly unusual. The above quotation was the Station's actual report

"of the observation by the source, and is what was reported to the FBI;

it differs from the quotation in the SSC Report. There was an internal

nature of an informal reminder, which stated that the man was reported

to have “looked suspicious"; but this formulation never found its way
into the more careful statements that usually characterize official t

reporting. The point is that the observation was cryptic and impres-

sionistic, rather than constituting a tangible basis for dramatic
activity or final conclusions.

There is one piece of reporting that could confuse those reviewing {

the record, but which is essentially resolved when considered in the Cpscensansas

context of known facts. On 19 March 1968" Monterrey Base cabled ba MNTY-0829 (IN 43193)

19 March 1964

that a source of a local (Monterrey) “agent of the federal judicial
police" had information on a man; the description seems to have the
same Cuban-American in mind. The following should be noted about the i ceca Bit Him
report: it misspelled the man's name; it offered a bare statement
that he “was involved in Kennedy assassination"; it states that he

entered Mexico “on foot" from Laredo, Texas (according to the SSC Final

Report, the FBI concluded that he entered by automobile); it asserts

that he stayed at the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City (while the dates and oa “ y

times of his registration and check-out at a specific hotel -in-Mexico :
City, where he stayed, were known); it gave an incorrect number for his
passport; and, it stated that his Mexican tourist card was issued

in Nuevo Laredo (when it was known to have been issued in Tampa, i
Florida). The report, on its face, was factually incorrect on a number

of known points. The source patently was extensively misinformed, the

when queried about the report fn the course of the present review, could

not recall it,

There is one additional aspect of the matter, in which the
record is confused. If we are to comment negatively on the pre-

sentation by the SSC in its emphasis on report, we must point out

that the Mexico City Station's response to the Monterrey report : fete onan eae
i contributes to such confusion as may exist on the matter. When # MEXT-8740 (IN 43940)

Hy Mexico City received the Monterrey cable the Deputy Chief of : 20 March 1964

It did not jibe in most respects, other than the date and place of

entry into Mexico. The mistake of that cable cannot be explained

today, but wrong it obviously was. It does, however, serve to

highlight the basic unreliability of the report and indicate how
it should be considered responsibly.

Implicit criticism of CIA's not collecting more information
on the man is not well founded. It had no real sources with access

to information concerning him; when a defector from Cuba became
available with such information he was queried and the results

were provided the authorities. i

economic and political sanctions, paramilitary operations (which re-
ceived recurring publicity in tne press), as well as a variety of
covert operations that were not known publicly. On 18 November 1963
President Kennedy -- four days before his death -- delivered a major
policy address in Miami, accusing Castro of having betrayed the Cuban
revolution; at the time the press, reportedly on the basis of what
"White House sources" said about it, viewed it as a call for the Cuban
people to overthrow the Castro regime.

The United States provided a haven and base for Cuban exiles, who
conducted their independent operations against the Castro government.
Some of these exiles had the support of CIA, as well as from other
elements of the U.S. Government, and still others had support from
private sources. With or without official U.S. support these exiles
spoke in forceful Latin terms about what they hoped to do. The Cuban
intelligence services had agents in the exile community in America
and it is likely that what they reported back to Havana assigned to
CIA responsibility for many of the activities under consideration,
whether CIA was involved or not.

We do not know the extent to which the Warren Commission took
what might be characterized as “judicial notice" of the tensions
between the two governments and their leaders; it certainly was in

the public domain, That consideration was given the possibility of

Seuant
Cuban or Soviet involvement in the assassination is no secret, clearly
reflecting a recognition of the question at the time. That a request
was not made by the Warren Commission, nor volunteered by the intel-
Jigence agencies, for extensive review of all Cuban operations is being
faulted today. Yet, in the light of understandings at that time, it
could well have appeared to members of the Warren Commission and its
staff as not directly relevant, in fact, to the specific issue of the
murder of the President. In the absence ‘of evidence to the contrary
a case could still be made for that view, although the evolution of
public perceptions probably would not accept it without reservation.
The SSC Final Report has fixed on the Cuban operations of the
{intelligence agencies--primarily those of CIA--for special attention
in considering the question. Implicitly it accepts the theory that
there could well have been conspiracy in the murder of President
Kennedy, and that Castro could have been behind it, having been pro-

.

voked by depredations against Cuba or plotting against his own life.
However, in advancing its thesis, the SSC Report cautioned that it
had “seen no evidence that Fidel Castro or others in the Cuban govern- t
ment plotted President Kennedy's assassination in retaliation for U.S. ;
operations against Cuba."

In response to this perception, conveyed in Book V of the ssc

Final Report, we have conducted a major review of Agency files (the

organization of that effort is discussed at Tab A of this report). this
was for the express purpose of identifying any separate activities that
could have provoked Castro to order the assassination of President
Kennedy had he learned of then, and to evaluate their security.

Today, in 1977, it is difficult to reconstruct exactly everything
that did and did not occur in the course of the Warren Commission in-
quiries in 1964. Not all that happened is,a matter of record. For
instance, in CIA at that time there were many individuals assigned to
various aspects of Cuban operations. They were familiar in detail with :
those activities, with what they were and with their strengths and
weaknesses. They doubtless made numerous conscious but unrecorded
judgments about what seemed relevant or irrelevant to the considera-

tions of the Warren Commission. Had they been aware of any aspects of

those activities that may have related to the assassination of the

President it is safe to say it would have been surfaced in some way.

While CIA produced considerable material for the investigation (see

Tab £) that more was not ‘Teported is a meaningful indication of what

was known then by those actually involved, as distinguished from what. t
might be hypothesized at a later date. To contend to the contrary -- :
which has been suggested by some -- would require a unanimous con- i

spiracy of many American citizens, employees of CIA, many of whom

knew aspects of even the most closely guarded activities. }


SECRET

Today, the knowledge of the persons involved directly in the
various Cuban operations in the period preceding President Kennedy's
death cannot be recaptured in the form that it existed then. Those
persons are scattered, their memories are blurred by time, and sone
are dead. The SSC, for instance -- in its attempt to capture ele-
ments of the past -- seems to have led some employees into expressing
opinions on subject matter they did not know in 1964, apparently in
response to representations by SSC staff members as to the facts; this
illustrates at best the difficulties in resolving hypothetical issues,
today, on a responsible basis.

The SSC Final Report devotes considerable time to the so-called
AMLASH operation, which centered on a high Cuban official who was
dissatisfied with the Castro regime. The Agency had only a tentative
relationship with this man during President Kennedy's life, although
the SSC Final Report -- in trying to prove its thesis -- has attempted
to present it differently. Because the case fs discussed so exten-
sively in the SSC Final Report, it is treated in a separate annex in
this paper, at Tab D. The key point fs that prior to President
Kennedy's death the relationship with AMLASH/1 was amorphous and
without substance. Had Castro learned of it he could learn only that
there was a contact that had not developed to the point of an under-
taking. This will not be treated further in this section of this

discussion.

ave emenie



In the face of the hypotheses advanced by the SSC Final Report,
it has been felt necessary to review in depth all records of Cuban
operations conducted by CIA during the pertod in question, 1961-1964.
The organization of the review is described at Tab A. It was not
possible to predict the form that information turned up by this
inquiry might take, and special care had to be exercised {n the effort.
In doing this the “provocation concept" of the SSC Report was kept in
mind. In the months that it took to complete this extensive review,
it is significant to observe that three areas of specific operational
activity were found that either might meet some of the requirements
of the provocation theory, or throw some further light on issues
already considered. To report this conclusion is not to dismiss the
original questions that faced the Warren Commission as to whether
there might have been Cuban or Soviet connections with Oswald. That
such possibilities remain unresolved fn some minds is apparent, but
that the records of CIA, in such a review, do not add significantly
to evidence on the subject, is the conclusion of the present inquiry.

The areas of operational activity noted above can be described

briefly as follows:

1. Operations directed against the Cuban leadership (AMTRUNK).

2. Operations involving the criminal underworld.
3. Other reports of plans to assassinate Castro.

Operation ANTRINK® i

There is one other general activiz: that was considered in the
course of the present research, which is discussed below, This
activity, AMTRUNK, was to develop a capability for splitting the
leadership of the castro regime and eventually overthrowing it. It
never reached the point of implementation; however, because it suffered
possible security vulnerabilities, it 1s treated here evan though it
never materialized. In our professional judgment this activity,
because of its failure to ever develop substance, is not feally rele-
mat vant to the question. It is included simply because it might be viewed, i
by virtue of its security vulnerabilities, as fitting in part the
: hypothesis of the SSC Final Report; it seemed better to include it than
try and explain at some later date why it was omitted, although the
reasoning should be apparent. If its inclusion in this report is subject

to question because of its lack of substance, perhaps it serves some
Purpose in indicating how little turned up in the course of this

research to meet any of the rather loosely formulated provocation thesis

direction that events seemed to have taken in Cuba. Two of them, Nestor |
Antonio Moreno Lopez and Enrique Cayardo Robera, developed an oper-
ational concept to overthrow the Castro government, which came to be
known as the Leonardo Plan. Cayardo had been a public fiqure in Cuba,
who had no apparent role in the activity following original inception

of the plan. Moreno was the son of a Cuban senator and Minister of Public

Works; as a lawyer in Cuba he had been involved in only a minor way in

the anti-Batista movement. seat

Poreno defected ts the United States in April 1961, settling
in Miami where he associated with anti-Castro exiles. Among his
associates was Jorge Ajbuszy Votsky, a Cuban citizen of Polish origin.
Volsky had been in prison ia the USSR in the 1940's, and enlisted in
the Polish Air Force during NII under the British Air Command. ‘After
WHII he marricd a Cuban national, and for a period operated his own
business in Havana. Although avidly pro-Castro he reportedly was

imprisoned for a few weeks following the Bay of Pigs invasion. As

he held a valid U.S. » he left Cuba, arriving in Miami in May -1961.
Cayardo and Hcrena discussed the Leonardo Plan with Volsky. He,
in turn, discussed it with Tadeus (Tad) Witold Szulc, a reporter with

the flew York Times. Szulc had reported on Cuban activities for the

New York Times prior to the fall of Batista, during which time he had
developed a wide acquaintance among Cubans. fie was transferred to
the Times Washington Bureau in April 1961, where he claimed to have
an entree to the White House through his uncle, Ambassador John C.
Witey. He also claimed to have a standing invitation for direct con-
tact with President Kennedy, Attorney General Robert Kennedy, and
HcGeorge Bundy on matters concerning Cuba. While the actual nature of
this entree is not known to CIA, it is through his intercession that
the Leonardo Plan gained government-Tevel support and approval.

In early 1963 Szulc arranged an interviews in Washington with
Hr. Richard Goodwin, a White House advisor. Volsky and Szulc then met
with Robert Hurwitch, a senior official in the Departzent of State,
who presented the concept to the CIA with Department zpproval. CIA
assigned it to its Miami Station, where it became known as AMTRUNK.

— SEGRE

AMTRUNK was conceived as first identifying disaffected key per-
sonnel in the Cuban armed forces with the long range objective of
uniting them against the Castro regime. On 4 April 1963 CIA cabled
certain stations and bases orders to identify Cubans who might be
used in the activity. Ouring that period the CIA Chief of Station
in Miami questioned CIA control of the operation. Noting uncertain
security considerations, he felt it best to fund the operation gen-
erously in order for it to proceed independently.

On 17 April 1963 Szulc informed Hurwitch that the Miami Station
had given Volsky responsibility for the decision of whether or not
the operation was to proceed; this was not consistent with CIA
intentions.

In August 1963 things still had rot progressed very far. A
Headquarters cable on 5 August 1963 to certain stations and bases
complained about the absence of responses to the 4 April cable. It

emphasized that activity to penetrate the Cuba armed forces was a
high priority objective. In early September 1963 AMTRUNK had three
intelligence sources tn Cuba: Miguel A. Diaz Isalgue, Ramon Guin
Hector Robello, and Modesto Orozco Basulto. One of these sources,

Guin, was reportedly close to AMLASH/1, a man with whom CIA was

dealing separately through a Headquarters case officer -- but at

that time unsuccessfully -- in trying to develop an operational ap-
proach similar in some respects to AMTRUNK. The AMLASH operation is
discussed at Tab D.

It was decided at the end of October 1963 that Moreno should be
separated from the operational details of the AMTRUNK operation be-
cause of numerous indiscretions and poor security practice. Arrange-
ments were made to involve him in a radio program to be used in con-
nection with the Rebel Army that eventually it was hoped would arise
against Castro. Moreno threatened to appeal this decision through
Volsky and Szulc to the President.

In November 1963 the program was still trying to develop leads
into higher echelons of the military-and civilian leadership. The
operation moved slowly, with preliminary infiltrations designed to
set up infiltration/exfiltratior routes. Although it had success-
fully recruited some persons during 1963 in Cuba, it had made prac-
tically no progress in establishing an organization or any capability
for action. At a much later date as its numbers increased its secur-
ity became less certain. In 1965 its security was believed to have
been seriously compromised and the decision was taken to cut off re-
lations with it. Various figures were arrested, including Guin, Diaz
and AMLASH/1.

The reason for selecting this operation for discussion here is
just not its denouement in 1965, but possible security weaknesses
from the beginning. Szulc and Volsky are considered to be highly
suspect and they are discussed below, with another person who became
involved in the activity.
a. Tad Szulc. Szule has been suspect since 1948 when
the FBI recorded reports that he was a communist. Re~
portedly he was in frequent contact with communist party
leaders and functionaries throughout Latin America. Sus-
Picions about his motives or possible connections with
foreign intelligence services, have never been proven.
Niccle Szulc, daughter of Tad Szulc, is reportedly an avid
communist. Philip Agee’s Inside the Company: A CIA Diary i
credits Nicole Szulc with having “obtained vital research |
materfals in New York and Washington, D.C." She is be- ;
lfeved to be an agent of the Cuban DGI. Doubts about Tad :
Szulc are unconfirmed but remain alive. Of Polish origin ;

Cuba. ACI Study of Volsky, dated 24 August 1964, prepared
by a UMWAVE analyst, makes the following statement: "Volsky's
knowledge of clandestine methods of operation, together with
his Russian prison background and his ingenuity as a middleman
in U.S. Government/CIA activities, made him an excellent
candidate for a communist penetration agent and that the pos-
sibility existed that he might be a singleton, sleeper or
stringer for the RIS." There has been no confirmation of
these suspicions. Volsky became a naturalized U.S. citizen
on 10 April 1969.

c. Jose Ricardo RABEL Nunez. Born in Cuba, he was the
son of a native born American citizen. He was educated both
in Cuba and in the States and later (1940) enlisted in the
U.S. Army. After discharge he returned to Cuba but kept
moving back and forth between the U.S. and Cuba. Viewed in
retrospect, his career presents a pattervof changing alle-
giances. He sijoined the anti-Batista forces in March 1952
first with the Cuban exiles in the United States and later
from inside Cuba. He joined the Cuban Army under Batista
and was the Cuban liaison officer with the U.S. Army mis-
sion in Cuba from November 1954 until 1956. Ouring his

%

SecRET


entire period in the Cuban Army, he was involved with
dissident army elements. RABEL was arrested in April 1956 when

he participated in an attempted coup. After a short imprison-

ment he returned to the U.S. and Korked with ore cf his brothers.

In October 1957, he returned to Cuba and became involved with
the 26th of July Movement and later with the Cienfuegos Group.
Shortly after the Castro victory, Castro called upon RABEL to :
set up a Cuban Marine Corps, a job he held until 1960, at which
time he was appointed Chief of Viviendos Campesinas (Rural
Housing). Approached by CIA, he refused to work in place but
was willing to defect, which he did in Decerber 1962, being
recruited by UMWAVE Station where he was used -in AMTRUNK
activities. He returned to Cuba on his own in 1965, reportedly
to attempt the exfiltration of his family. Upon return to Cuba
he was arrested and sentenced to 30 years imprisonment but was
set free in July or August 1967. There were accusations that
RABEL was a Cuban agent as early as July 1963. The accusations
were never proven.
In view of the later roll-up of the AMTRUNK operation the
tentative opinion has been offered that the operation could have
been an ingenious plan by the Cubans from the beginning, using access

at high levels in the U.S. Government to learn the identities of

|


individuals in the Cuban hierarchy who were disloyal to the regime.
Whatever the later penetrations by Cuban intelligence, the role of
Szule and Volsky, in the early phase of the operation, could have
exposed both its members and eventual objectives to Cuban intelli-
gence.
Accepting the possibility of vital security flaws in the
operation, it must be observed that there was very little progress
and no concrete planning during the life of President Kennedy. The
eventual objective was to develop sufficient support and organization
to overthrow the Cuban regime. It never made much progress,
although it did lay down caches and conducted some infiltrations
and exfiltrations in 1964 and 1965.
An attempt to build support that might eventually have the
capability to attempt a soup against the Castro regime obviously i
would have been irritating to Castro. That it never really prog- ;
ressed very far during the life of President Kennedy is a relevant i
consideration to whether or not the tentative beginnings would have : i

provoked Castro to order the assassination of President Kennedy.

of one statement that it contained. One of a series of stories

printed 20-25 April 1975, it quoted Frank Sturgis as follows:
"The third (assassination) scheme involved
planting a bomb in Castro's office. 'I had
access to the Prime Minister's office,' Sturgis
said. ‘I knew Fidel's private secretary Juan
Orta. I recruited him to work with the embassy
(American Embassy in Havana). '*

Sturgis has been something of a soldier of fortune over the
years, having served in different branches of the U.S. military
and having been in the anti-Batista movement prior to Castro's

takeover. Sturgis stayed on in Cuba until mid-1959, during which

time he reportedly had some role in the Castro regime's control © : t
of the gambling interests. He came to the United States in 1959.

Sturgis gained notoriety when arrested on 17 June 1972 in the Water-
gate break-in. He has claimed on a number of occasions to have been

‘an employee of CIA, although there is no record of any such relation- i

ship. He was in contact with some of the CIA Cuban employees in the
Miami area, but had no direct relationships with the Agency.

The particular feature in the above excerpt from the newspaper

story is that it constitutes the first public reference to Juan ‘

i Orta in the role of an assassin in plans against Castro. Orta was,



5

} in fact, the first man who reportedly was to have been used in the

operation that CIA had, with the criminal syndicate, to kill Castro.

Orta was the director of the Office of the Prime Minister, which

gave him the access that would make it possible for him to poison
Castro. The plan failed because Orta lost his position, and with

it his access, in late January 1961. This was prior to delivery '

of the poison pills to him in late February or early March 1961. :
i Orta's role in this connection was over when he took refuge in the

Venezuelan Embassy in Havana in April 1961. He was allowed to leave
Cuba in October 1964 and settled in Miami in February 1965. As for
Sturgis’ assertion that he recruited Orta to work with the embassy,

CIA ‘files have no record that Orta was recruited for CIA by anyone H
during the period there was an embassy in Cuba. While Orta was : 7
reported in early 1961 as being used in the CIA-syndicate attenpt
against Castro, CIA had no direct relationships with him until he 1965"
left Cuba, at which time he was used as a source of information on i. i
‘the Cuban leadership.

se The fact remains that Orta did at one time have the role of i
intended assassin. Sturgis’ identificaticn of Orta in this capacity,
prior to its becoming known to external investigators in 1975, raised

the question of just what Sturgis had known, and whether he could

cy

pansosassteuaranerebiengereeenseens



have been a source of information on the subject whereby Castro
could have learned of CIA's earlier plan against his life.

Newspaper stories are not necessarily reliable sources of
information. However, because the statement by Sturgis in 1975
indicated a familiarity with Orta's availability to play the role
of assassin in 1960, additional attention was given the statement
in the press to see how it might fit in with other things that are
known. What follows is subject to reservations that must attach
to the reliability of newspaper stories.

The New York Daily News stories (20-25 April 1975), and another
story by the same author on 13 June 1976, refer to possible relation-
ships between Sturgis and Trafficante, also mentioning a Norman
Rothman as a gambling partner of Trafficante. The Office of Security
wrote a memorandum in 1975, in conjunction with the first set of New
York Daily News storfes, noting that there was a connection between
Sturgis and Rothman in 1960, citing FBI reports. It fs pertinent
to note here that in addition to the role Sturgis is reported to
have had with the Castro government in relation to the gambling
activities, Juan Orta's availability for the assassination assignment
was understood to be due to his having lost payoffs that he had once
received from the gambling interests. One can deduce that Sturgis

and Orta could have known one another because of their connections


with the gambling activities as well as having contacts with
the men heading the gambling organizations.

The New York Daily News story of 1976 also reports a claim by a
Marie Lorenz that she acted in 1960 in behalf of Sturgis, in an
attempt to assassinate Castro. She had also been mentioned in the
1975 stories, Ms. Lorenz reportedly was Castro's mistress at one
point, and her access, so the story indicates, was used as a means
for getting to him. The 1976 news story concludes that “soon after
her murder mission failed the CIA recruited Mafia mobsters . . . to
kill Castro. . .“ In the news story she claimed that the plan
involved the use of poison pills which she concealed in a jar of face
Cream; they dissolved and could not be used.

On page 79 of the SSC Interim Report on Alleged Assassination
Plots the following is extracted from an 18 October 1960 memorandua
from the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to the CIA
Deputy Director for Plans:

“During recent conversations with several
friends, (Sam) Giancana stated that Fide?
Castro was to be done away with very shortly.
When doubt was expressed regarding this state-
ment, Giancana reportedly assured those

that he had already met with the assassin-ta-be

on three occasions . . . Giancana claimed that
everything has been perfected for the killing

of Castro, and that the ‘assassin’ had arranged
with a girl, not further described, to drop a ‘pill’
in some drink or food of Castro." :

This seems to confirm some plot involving a woman to kill Castro
with poison. However, the dating of events does not fit the time
frame known to CIA, While consideration had been given to various
schemes, there were no CIA pills for delivery until February 1961.

It suggests that the syndicate may have been moving ahead on its own.

Following collapse of CIA's access to Castro through Orta,
Johnny Roselli, the man who had served as the Agency's original inter-
mediary with the syndicate, stated that he knew a Cuban exile leader
who might participate. This man, Tony Varona, headed the Democratic
Revolutionary Front, one of the exile groups that also received
Support from CIA as part of the larger Cuban operation. Varona was
dissatisfied with the nature and extent of that support; Miami Station
Suspected that he was not keeping his bargain with the Agency. In
fact, it is possible that Varona already was involved in independent
operations with the criminal syndicate when first approached prior to
the Bay of Pigs in March 1961 to carry out the Castro assassination.
The 1967 IG Report refers to two FBI reports that bear on this.

One of them, on 21 December 1960, indicates support by the criminal



underworld for some of the Cuban exiles. The other report, on
18 January 1961, suggests that Varona was one of those receiving
that support, although this was not confirmed. As a matter of
interest, as late as 10 dune 1964 there was a report that gangster
elements in the Miami area were offering $150,000 for anyone who
would kil? Castro (an amount mentioned to the syndicate repre-
sentatives by CIA case officers at an earlier date). These bits
of information, fitted together, could provide the basis for an .
: explanation of why Varona was so readily available when approached

by Roselli. It also may throw light on a question noted in the

1967 IG Report. The operation with the syndicate had been called
off following the Bay of Pigs in April 1961; yet, when it was
reactivated in April 1962.the case officer felt there was something |
already ongoing in spite of the fact that the operation had been : |
terminated a year earlier. It is possible that CIA simply found itself
involved in providing additional resources for independent operations

that the syndicate already had under way. The criminal syndicate

What do these various considerations suggest? It is obvious
that many lines of speculation can be develcped, not the least of
which is that the Agency did not know the full extent of syndicate
activities. Clearly, the Agency's case officers felt that they were
initiating a new activity that had the sole purpose of accomplishing
the elimination of Castro. The additional considerations cada be
listed as follows: i

1. The criminal syndicate may well have had some inde-
pendent activities of its own underway prior to CIA involve- "
ment in late 1960. These operations could well have con-
tinued after the CIA standdown following the Bay of Pigs,
being ongoing in some form when CIA reactivated the plan

i in April 1962. ;
Sl. The syndicate operations could have activities such
as those that are reported in the New York Daily News
stories in 1975 and 1976.

3. Frank Sturgis seems to have had contacts with the

criminal syndicate, although from outward appearances he
was not a member of it. He could well have been used by
the syndicate in its activities. !
4, Sturgis has not been a reliable source, so his f |
statements are treated with considerable reserve. He !

probably did know Juan Orta when both of them were in Cuba.
He was outside of Cuba, however, when Orta was given the : |

role of assassin. Whatever ne knew at that time--and
his knowledge may be of a much later date--could have heen :
in the form reported fifteen years later in the 1975
Newspaper storfes. If there was such an operation it
was not CIA's; it could have been an earlier operation
of the syndicate. While Sturgis could have known of
or have been involved in earlier activity by the syndicate,
whatever its form, he may also have had no part in any
of it; he may merely have fabricated a story from bits
and pieces learned by him from gossip in the Miami
i community after Orta settled there in 1965.

5. If the syndicate was conducting its own operations,
that would tend to reinforce the thought that the details

of its operations would have been characterized by discre~ a |

tion--or security--despite the FBI report in October 1960,

°

The authors of Book V of the SSC Final Report felt that the : |
operation seeking to employ the resources of the criminal syndicate

‘
{
would not have provided Castro the clear provocation that was hypothe- |
sized for the AMLASH operation. At page 68 the Report stated: {

{

"... it is unlikely that Castro could have ;



distinguished the CIA plots with the underworld

from those plots not backed by CIA. In fact,

the methods the CIA used in these attempts were

designed to prevent the Cuban government from

attributing them to the CIA.“
In a sense the SSC made a conscious judgment, in the context of its
provocation theory, that was made less consciously and in a different
context in 1964 by the few CIA employees who knew of the operations
with the syndicate -- that they bore no relation to the assassination
of President Kennedy.

Possible Ruby--Trafficante Contact
There are fragments of unevaluated reports that leave one aspect.

of the involvement of the criminal syndicate as a question. This can
only be noted here, as the means for resolving it one way or another
are not within, the Agency's’ capabilities.
” * e noted earlier (see Tab B.. page 4), a 27 November 1963
report records statements by a British journalist that during his own
imprisonment in Cuba in 1959 he knew of a gangster type named “Santos
who was in jail where he was visited by another American gangster type
named "Ruby." Current speculation has considered the possibility that
"santos" was Santos Trafficante who may have been in jail there in
1959. An FBI report of 14 August 1964 recorded a statement by a person

Jailed in Cuba that he shared a cell with Trafficante.



14-0000 7 i i

If the “Santos” in the British report was Trafficante, the
British and FBI reports tend to support one another on the narrow
point of his imprisonment in Cuba in 1959. This is a material
consideration, as there are reservations about both sources.

It may be that the FBI has more information on this point, but
there is no further known relevant information in the Agency
on the matter. :

The significance of this is that if Trafficante was in
Jail fn Cuba in 1959, he could have been available for a visit
by Jack Ruby if such visits were allowed. Ruby, in fact, did visit
Cuba in 1959. The long time gap between 1959 and November 1963
removes the two incidents from candidacy for consideration as

i evidence of conspiracy ageinst President Kennedy. However, if

Ruby was running an errand for someone in 1959, it would provide

an interesting lead for those inquiring into the possible signi-

ficance of past assocations or contacts. :
Both the British report and the confirmation of Ruby's |

1959 visit were known to the Warren Commission, and Ruby

reportedly spoke at length about his visit when questioned.



ea

However, Ruby is dead and Trafficante has declined to testify
atall. A later allegation of a visit by Ruby to Cuba in late
1962 or early 1963 is believed not to be true.
Otier Reported Assassination Proposals

There were other references to possible assassination plots
against Castro that seem not to have been addressed in the Interim
Report of the SSC on Alleged Assassination Plots Involving Foreign
Leaders. They are summarized briefly below:

In May 1975 a Cuban exile who came to be a contract employee
stated that i. February 1961 he was given a rifle and the mission
to enter Cuba to assassinate Castro. He claimed to have tried to
enter Cuba three times, but failed each time in gaining entry to
Cuba. Agency files have no further records on this matter.

“As a result of a colum by Jack Anderson in May 1977, a check

was made of Agency files referring to an Antonio Veciana, cited
by Anderson as a CIA employee. The man was never an employee of the
Agency, but he was connected with ALPHA-66, a Cuban exile movement.
On three separate occasions (December 1960, July 1962, April 1966)
he proposed to CIA employees the assassination of Fidel Castro.
He was rebuffed on each occasion. Again in 1970 there was a report
of his making a similar proposal while an AID employee at an overseas
post. The details of his actual role % “unknown to the Agency,
although the FBI may have more details on him. This is touched on in
Tab G, which comments on selected newspaper stories published in the

course of this research effort.

Agent Messages in 196] Mentioning Plans to Kill Castro

1. During the tnvestigations in 1975 five agent messages were
identified that made reference to plans to kill Castro, or proposing
such action. Three of these messages related to the same operation,
the other two relating to separate proposals; there is no indication
that any of these proposals was the result of CIA initiative. The
existcace of these messages was mentioned during Mr. Colby's testimory
before the Church Committee. In response to a request from the Deputy
Inspector General, LA Division prepared a summary of the messages
-and on 8 August 1975 forwarded it to the Review Staff, then charged
with serving as an interface with the congressional committees.
Records of the Review Staff do not show how this paper was handled.
The subject was not covered-in the Churcl{ Committee's interim report
on Alleged Assassination Plots Involving Foreign Leaders and is
summarized again below. .

I

2. Three of the messages involved the same group of agents,
and seem to relate to the same plan. The first message, dated
27 March 1961 (prior to the Bay of Pigs) was sent by an Agency
asset, AMBRONC/5. The message requested the Agency's opinion on
@ proposed sabotage of the electric company in Havana, stating that
this could be coordinated "with attempt against Fidel in public

i appearance (at) Sports Palace." The cable expressed the view that



eos al

an “attempt against Fidel (is) in accordance with seneral plan."
There is no record that this message was answered. Two days later,
on 29 March 1961, possibly because of the absence of a reply, the
same agent sent another message. This stated that the plan was
scheduled for 9 April. Castro was to speak at the Palace, and an
“assassination attempt at said place (will be) followed by a general

shutting off of main electric plants in Havana." General anti-regime
developments to follow this were then outlined, This message was
answered on 30 March agreeing that a "major effort should be launched * i
Havana on date you selected." It recommended contacting other named :
persons, looking to a more general uprising. The message addressed :
the general issue, making no comment on the proposal to kill Castro.
A third message, on 5 April 1961, presumably from the same agent, \
i reported that the persons he had been directed to contact had arms j
! for only 50 men. While stating that the sabotage of the electric |
company and “possibly attempt on Fidel" would be carried out 9 April, :
i he emphasized that to do so would make it impossible to maintain a
clandestine organization in Cuba; “your military aid is decisive. If it H
does not come that date we are lost." There is no indication that
this message was answered. No further reference to this plan has
been found.

3. We have reviewed the files of the persons identified in the

cables, and have interviewed a case officer who was responsible for
one of them, in an attempt to learn more about the matter. The

) four agents in question are cocmented on briefly below: i

a. AMBRONC/5 is the agent who sent the messiges out-

Vining the proposed sabotage effort and attempt against
Castro. i .
(1) 201 file opened 15 July 1960. A POA was
2 : not issued until 18 December 1961, and an OA on
31 January 1962. A debriefing of him in November
1960, prior to the Kennedy Administration, revealed
that he had been in touch with people who had !
plotted the assassination of Fidel Castro, and claimed
to have tried himself to make similar plans. He was
infiltrated on 9 December 1960, exfiltrating 15 February
: 1961. |
(2) AMBRONG/S was infiltrated again 3 March |
1961 and exfiltrated again 19 June 1961. This : i
covered the period of his messages and the Bay of !

Pigs. His sole mission was to organize resistance
groups.

(3) AMBRONC/S was infiltrated again on 19 December
1961, exfiltrating 29 March 1962, again with the same

mission.
(4) AMBRONC/S was infiltrated finally 2 May
1962, was arrested 29 May 1962, and was executed

30 August 1962. He has been reported as never admitting

that he was a CIA agent. His name is not one of those

in the book given Senator McGovern by Castro, listing

those claimed by Castro to have plotted attempts against

his life.

b. AMCOAX/1 was one of those-AMBRONC/5 was told to
contact for his general plan for April 1961.

(1) POA on 5 January 1961. His mission was to
organize paramilitary activities in Cuba. He in-
filtrated in February 1961 and exfiltrated in July
1961 following the Bay of Pigs. This period covered
the above messages.

(2) Re-infiltrated 29 July 1961, with the same
organizing mission, he was arrested on 17 August 1961,

and is serving a thirty year term. His name appears
| in the book given Senator McGovern.

c. ANPUG/1 was another of those ANBRONC/S ‘as told to
contact for his general plan in April 1961.

(1) Recruited in September 1960, he was in-
filtrated that month, receiving airdrops in December
1960. He returned to the U.S. 15 May 1961, following
the Bay of Pigs.

(2) Infiltrated again on 29 June 1961, with the
mission to organize resistance groups and conduct
sabotage operations Lhe vas arrested in July 1961, and
{4s serving a thirty year term.’ His name is among those

d. AMPANIC/7 was another of those that AMBRONC/S was

told to contact for his general plan in April 1961.

(1) This man was a "walk-in" 15 April 1960,
a POA being issued 30 January 1961 (although there was

a MOC since 12 July 1960). He was to organize resistance

groups in the Havana and Pinar del Rio areas.

(2) Infiltrated 3 March 1961, he was arrested
23 April 1961, and is serving @ thirty year term. His
name is among those in the book given Senator McGovern
by Castro.

(3) Records relating to this man mention his in-
filtration into Cuba in August 1960 and exfiltration
in November 1960 (prior to his being issued a POA).
His "mission" during that pertod is mentioned tersely
as being “to organize resistance groups . . . for
mounting sabotage operations . . . and assassination
of prominent Cuban Communist members in the Castro
entourage . . ." The records refer to "his own
personal objectives" during this perfod and criticizes
how he functioned during his stay in Cuba from August
to November 1960. The record then specifies how he is
to conduct himself and focus his efforts on his return,
which was to develop sabotage operations. We were able
to contact one of his two case officers, who has retired



(the other had died), to ascertain his recollections.

Stating that at the time the focus was on developing

organizations for operations, he stated that an

assassination mission, such as attributed to AMPANIC/7

on his earlfer time in Cuba, not only was not authorized,

but would have compromised the effort to organize.

Any such assassination missfon, the case officer states,

would have been at AMPANIC/7's dwn initiative.

4. It is clear that ANBRONC/5 envisioned a general uprising

in Cuba, to commence with sabotage of the electric plant in Havana

and an attempt on Castro's life. The third of his messages reflected

pessimism, and the fact is that the operation did not come off.
While the man had no express misston from the Agency to mount an
operation against Castro personally, it is clear that no specific
objection was recorded to his statement 6f intentions. The one
recorded reply addresses the concept of general action and makes
no reference to the proposal to make an attempt on Castro.

5. The fact is that the 9 April 1961 operation did not come
off, and AMBRONC/5 has not been identified as an Agency asset.
Nor was his name included in the book given Senator McGovern
by Castro. The other men, none of whom had a mission of assassi-
nation from the Agency, arefrow serving thirty year terms, That
their names were included in the list given Senator McGovern by
Castro may be an attempt on Castro’s part to enlarge on the facts

rather than to report what he trrly believes. They were not

executed, a consideration that mey support this view.

6. The records are incomplete on the events identified by

the three messages.

The time in question predates the Bay of Pigs.

The men mentioned above had more specific missions, other than

that of assassination.

They exfiltrated subsequent to the event

described in the messages, and were arrested during subsequent

infiltrations into Cuba. There is no record that any of them had

a mission from CIA to kill Castro. The person who proposed the
act in 1961 -- AMBRONC/5 -- never acknowledged that he was a CIA

had the mission of his assassination.

man who had identified himself as Moratori of the Italian Embassy,
who claimed to work for U.S. intelligence and to be in touch with

i for an invasion within 30 days, after the killing of Fidel." A

! reply, dated 6 June, stated that the information was untrue and

that Moratori was not known and should not be trusted. (Insofar

as CIA records show, there was an Italian diplomat of that name

in Cuba at that time. Little is known about him.) The originator

AMLASH OPERATION



1. AMLASH OPEFATICY

Comment on the AMLASH operation, in the context of its presenta- .
tion in Book ¥ of tne Final Report of the SSC, is complicated by the
treatment given it in the Report. Rather than being treated ina
unified way, reference and discussion is found throughout the Report.”

The actual nature and the significance of the AHLASH operation
differs materially from that presented in the SSC Revert. The Report
leaves the inference that A'ILASH/] was perhaps an agent of Castro, with
the mission of provoking a plot against Castro (pages 3, 74 and 79),
which in turn provided Castro with the justification for launching
Lee Harvey “swald against President Kennecy in retaliation. Alternatively,
the Report suggests that AMLASH/] was so insecure in the conduct of his
activities that the details of his plotting could have become known to
Castro, thereby providing the same basic motivation (pages 74 and 75).
Whichever of these alternatives, so the reasoning would be, the ANLASH
operation should have been reported to the Narren Commission. Ye believe
that neither thesis applies. The character of the relationship between
CIA and AMLASH/1, prior to Oswald's assassination of President Xennedy,

was so insubstantial and inconclusive that it provided no basis for

*See pages 2, 3, 5, 6, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 24, 25, 26, 27, 23

AMLASH/1 to fect that he had any tangible CIA support for plotting
against Castro. Whether one is inclined to see AMLASH/1 as either a
double agent or provocateur, or simply as a man who carelessly revealed
what he was doing, there was little for him to report or to leak.
ee

In preparing the current comment on the AMLASH operation, as
treated in the SSC Report, it was judged best to approach it in two
ways. A sequential summary of the AMLASH bperation is intended to
present the Agency's understanding of the true nature of the activity.
Following that, selected points made in the SSC Report are addressed.
It is hoped that this presentation will help establish a clearer per-
spective for judging the actual substance of the operation.

eee

As early as March 1959, AMLASH/1 was reported as expressing
directly to Castro his dissatisfaction with the situation in Cuba.

At that time he also was reported as expressing his disillusionment
and that if he "...did not get out of the country soon, he would kill
Castro himself."

Two years later, in March 1961, AMLASH/1 was met in Mexico City
by a CIA case officer stationed there. The occasion was AMLASH/T's
presence at the leftist-soonsored Latin America Conference on National
‘Soveretanty, Emancipation, and Peace. The meeting was arranged by
AMNHIP/1, a long-time friend of AMLASH/1. A dispatch in July 1961,
“giving a general round-up on operational activity against Cubans in

: Mexico City, described the meeting (along with others) as follows:

“\..the Station made - unsuccessful ‘aporoach’

to (AMLASH/1)...the ‘approach’ consisted of a

"friendly' talk between a case officer, a mutual

friend of (AMLASH/1) and (AMLASH/1) when he last
N- was visiting in Mexico. Hhile (AMLASH/1) did not

pick up the opportunity at that time, ne apparently

did not report the incident to his superiors and

the ground work may have been laid for a similar action

in the future." i
Later in March there was a report that AMLASH/1 and another Cuban wanted i
to defect and needed help in escaping. Consideration of their exfil-
tration ended with a report that the Cuban police were aware of AMLASH/1's
intention and plans.

Page 14 of the SSC Final Report cites the 7 September 1963
cable reporting the first 1963 meeting with ANLASH/1 as follows: H
"ANLASH was interested primarily in getting the :

United States to invade Cuba, or in attempting an

‘inside job’ against Castro, and that he was awaiting
a U.S, plan of action." (Empahsis added).

This suggests a plan of action targetted specifically against Castro
himself. That may have seemed implicit to’ the authors of the SSC
Report, but the actual language of the cable states it somewhat differently:
"AMLASH still feels there only two ways accomplish
change either inside job or invasion he realistic

AMWHIP, AMLASH still awaiting for US reveal plan of 3

The point is, as stated in the SSC Report, that it left
AMLASH/1 “awaiting a U.S. plan of action.” There was |
nothing substantive or conclusive. To the contrary, things
were left very much up in the air. \
Footnote 17 on page 14 of the SSC Report states that |
"characterization of this phase of the AMLASH operation i
4s disputed." (Emphasis added). The footnote observes f
that the SSC Interim Report on Alleged Assassination Plots
concluded that the AHLASH operation was an assassination i |

operation, which begs the question of what it was for "this

mui’

phase" of the matter. In fact, the SSC Interim Report on
Alleged Assassination Plots notes specifically that “From
. : the first contact with AMLASH until the latter part of 1963,
it was uncertain whether he would defect or remain in Cuba.”
(Page 86). The point is that the SSC Final Report, Book Vy 1

itself describes the very general nature of the approach
by AMLASH/1, and the absence of a U.S. response (supra).
Any dispute over how to characterize the operation at that

time arises from the presentation of it in Book V of the

SSC Report. Reference to the dispute may reflect views

expressed by CIA representatives on reviewing the draft of *22
SSC Final Report.

The next paragraph in the SSC Report, Book V, presents
in inferential sequence, an interview Castro held
with an AP reporter, Daniel Harker, in which Castro inveighed


i
‘|

against anti-Cuban terrorist plans of U.3. leaders.
The intended inference, as is known from discussions with
SSC staff members, was that AMLASH/1 may have reported (or
leaked) to Castro what the authors of the report elected
to see then as assassination plotting. This characteri-
zation is even more explicit at pages 3-4 of the Summary
and Findings of the SSC Report, presenting the inter-
pretation as categorically as though it were fact.
The fact remains that whatever views AMLASH/1 may have
expressed, he had no response from his CIA contacts of
any support for his proposals at that time. Whatever
may have been the cause for Castro's remarks at that time
they could not have stemmed from anything said to
AMLASH/1 by CIA officers as they proposed nothing and
undertook nothing. fee
AMLASH/1 flew to Paris on 14 September, ostensibly to attend a
meeting of the Alliance Francaise. The trip actually was for an :
extended vacation, which AMLASH/1 intended to report to Castro
after the fact. On 16 September he wrote AMWHIP/1 that he did not
“intend to see (be interviewed by) your friend again" referring to
the CIA case officer. On 3 October 1963 the case officer nevertheless
arrived in Paris to meet with AMLASH/1. Station officers were already
in contact with him, two of whom participated in meetings that followed.

was reported as wishing a meeting with a senior U.S. official, :
preferably Robert F. Kennedy, for assurance of “moral support" for
any action AMLASH/1 undertook in Cuba. The cable recommended that.

the request for a meeting:

"be given highest and profound consideration as

he determined attempt op against* [Castro] with or
without [U.S.] support."

A 21 October cable to Washington reported a 17 October meeting with
AMLASH/1--"Basically he wants assurance that [U.S.] will support him
if his enterprise is successful." (Emphasis added).
Desmond Fitzgerald, then Chief of the Special Affairs Staff,
was going to Paris on other business and undertook to meet with AMLASH/1.
The plan for the meeting, written in advance, was outlined as follows:
"Fitzgerald will represent self as personal
representative of Robert F. Kennedy who traveled
to Paris for specific purpose of meeting [AMLASH/1]
and giving him assurances of full U.S. support if
there is change of the present government in Cuba."
(Emphasis added).
On 29 October Fitzgerald met with AMLASH/1 in Paris, representing

i himself as a spokesman of Attorney General Kennedy. The third person

at the meeting was the case officer, who served as an interpreter.



a
SEgRET ;

On 13 November the case officer wrote a memorandum summarizing high- ; :

7 lights of the meeting. It reads in part as follows:
“Fitzgerald informed [AMLASH/1] that the United

States is prepared to render all necessary

assistance to any anti-communist Cuban group which

succeeds in neutralizing the present Cuban leader-

ship and assumes sufficient control to invite the
United States to render the assistance it is x
Prepared to give. It was emphasized that the

above support will be forthcomina only efter a

real couo has been effected and the group involved

is in a position to request U.S. (probably under
OAS auspices) recognition and support. (Emphasis -

added). It was made clear that the U.S. was not

prepared to commit itself to supporting an isolated

uprising, as such an uprising can be extinguished
in a matter of hours if the present government is

still in control in Havana. As for the post-coup

oo ee

- period, the U.S. does not desire that the political
clock be turned back but will support the necessary

aw

economic and political reforms which will benefit

al

the mass of the Cuban people."

At the time of the CIA Inspector General's report on the subject

in 1967, additional details were elicited from Fitzgerald, who re-

ye


foo

called that AMLASH/1 spoke repeatedly of the need for an assassination
weapon. He wanted a high-power rifle with telescopic sights, or some
other weapon that could be used to kill Castro from a distance. Fitzgerald

stated that he rejected this request. Fitzgerald's Executive Officer,
although not present at the mecting, was kept posted by Fitzgerald and i

had a recollection the same as the one noted above. The case officer

is reported as not recalling the exchange on the weapon. His memorandum cota |

stated that: be :
“Nothing of an operational nature was discussed at i
the Fitzgerald meeting. After the meeting [AMLASH/1] stated i
that he was satisfied with the policy discussion but now

{ desired to know what technical support we could provide him.”

on AMLASH/1's: ‘reaction to the 29 October meeting in Paris. The contact

cerned, but he was not at all hapoy with the fact

that he still was not given the technical assistance

At this point it is important to note that Agency
documents summarize what AMLASH/1 was to be told,
and what. he was told, which matches a later report
of what he understood. In essence he was told there
would be no U.S. support until after the fact, and then
only if he was successful. While that may not seem a

very realistic way in which to bring about the overthrow
of a government, it is directly relevant to the question
of what AMLASH/1 was told and what he understood. It is

“SEE

Interesting confirmation of AMLASH/1‘s understanding
is provided by a July 1964 FBI report (mentioned variously
at pages 35, 72 and 74 of Book V of the SSC Report). This
report was from an FBI informant who stated that AMLASH/1
was unhappy with the CIA response and that Attorney General
Kennedy had refused to support the plan. Given the substance
of this aspect of the report it is apparent that although the
date of the report is June 1964, this particular information
dates back to 29 October 1963 when AMLASH/1 was told by
Hiss Se Fitzgerald, representing himself as speaking for Robert F.
Kennedy, that ad ‘would not be given support in this opera-

a telephonic request, AMLASH/1 agreed to delay his departure “if it
is something interesting.” The case officer told him that “he could not
assure it interesting but that it was to be a meeting which AMLASH
had requested." The cable reporting this exchange noted that it was
a "rapid conversation" inhibited by the presence of a second person
in the room.
The SSC Final Report (page 19) attempts to expand this brief
and cryptic telephone conversation into the "First indication that he
might receive the specific support he requested.” More factually, and
quite significantly,. the Report acknowledges that no specific support
had been offered up to then. Beyond that it fs at best a piece of
highly speculative analysis, not supported by the evidence.
The case officer from Washington arrived in Paris the morning of
22 November and met with AMLASH/1 late that afternoon. As they left i
the meeting they learned of President Kennedy's assassination. They
probably were meeting when President Kennedy was shot. :
Whatever the relationship with AMLASH/1 following the death of
President Kennedy, there is every indication that during President
Kennedy's life AMLASH/1 had no basis for believing that he had CIA
support for much of anything. Were he a provocateur reporting to Castro,
or {f he was merely careless and leaked what he knew, he had no
factual basis for leaking or reporting any actual CIA plot directed

against Castro.

IL. SPECIFIC SECTIONS OF THE SSC_REPORT

Section 1, 8

This section of the SSC Final Report, the Summary, states that "it
places particular emphasis on the effect their (the intelligence agencies)
Cuban operations seemed to have on their investigation." It states
that the report “details these operations to illustrate why they were '
relevant to the investigation." It states that presentation of the |
AMLASH operation is to illustrate why that operation should have been
1 examined by the Warren Commission.

The view of the Subcommittee, as to why the AMLASH operation
warranted such review, is summarized at page 5 of the Report as
follows: :

"The AMLASH plot was more relevant to the Warren

Commission's work than the early CIA assassination
plots with the underworld. Unlike those earlier
plots the AMLASH operation was in progress at the
time of the assassination; unlike the earlier plots,
the AMLASH operation could clearly be traced to CIA;
and unlike the earlier plots, the CIA had endorsed
AMLASH's proposal for a coup, the first step to hin
being Castro's assassination, despite Castro's threat
of retaliation for such plotting.”
As stated in the preceeding discussion the AMLASH operation was
without substance prior to President Kennedy's death; it is particularly

v

Steet eddemimctiestat macy eet (44 | Peesetiqn an ee iqumninmmmnnimuec ee ee



unsuited to make the Subcommittee's intended point. It is literally
accurate to note a coincidence in tise, of the contacts with AMLASH/T

prior to the death of President Kenncd;, but that is all. It is incorrect
to say that “CIA had endorsed AMLASH's ;roposal." There was no agree-
ment with AMLASH/1T, or commitment to him, and even had Castro learned }
of the contacts with him there was notliing to learn beyond the fact i
_ of the contact. The relationship was most tenuous and without any

support promised to him for whatever fi. ;-tanned. Castro's "threat"

=-as noted: above--must be considered irrelevant to the substantive
nature of the AMLASH relationship at i! t time.

This viewpoint was conveyed to Subcommittee prior to publica-

: tion of the report. At the same time it was observed that theoretically
y there was greater possibility of leaks ‘rom the earlier operations
Anvolving the criminal underworld, although there was no known evidence

. of such leaks. While general rather than specific, this could have

i
|
1

provided more reasonable support for the Subconmittee's view that there
were CIA operations that should have been reported to the Warren Commission.
The SSC “Subcommittee saw otherwise, cuttining its position at page 68

as follows:

: *...it is unlikely that Castro could have

! distinguished the CIA plots with the underworld
i from those plots not backed ty CIA. In fact,

! the methods the CIA used in these attempts were

designed to prevent the Cuban government from

attributing them to the CIA."

i _ The result this has on the present coment on the SSC Final
Report may seem anomalous. It places CIA in the position of con- i

testing the interpretation given the AMLASH operation in the SSC

Final Report, and to that extent the thesis that the presentation
was supposed to support. At the same time, however, we are

inclined to acknowledge in principle the possibility--not seriously

: : considered as a likelihood during the Warren Commission inquiry--
that other operations could have suffered the defects attributed

to the AMLASH operation by the SSC Report. In protesting the

presentation in one instance, and the specific conclusions it seeks ‘
: i: to support, the effect is to disagree with a substantial portion

of the report as written. On the other hand we tend to not contest

a general thesis that more specific attention could have been given

“-At page 4 of the SSC Final Report Desmond Fitzgerald, ina
i > meeting with AMLASH/1, fs quoted as having: : j

"stated the United States would support a coup."

Again, at page 19, the report states that Fitzgerald:
“also gave general assurances that the United
States would help in bringing about the coup." aia

“The last version is attributed to the case officer who was present at
~ the meeting in 1963, in his testimony before the SSC fn 1975. This

the report of the meeting {n 1963, which was written by him at the time.

In considering the processes by which this version came into being, it

is noted that the following statement appears at page 87 of the SSC

Interim Report on Alleged Assassination Plots:
: “Fitzgerald met AMLASH/1 in late fall 1963 and

Promised him that the United States would support
H a coup against Castro,* ee
citing testimony by the case officer who was Present at the meeting.
An interesting footnote (#3) on that page reads as follows:
"3. The contact plan for the proposed meeting : H

stated: ‘Fitzgerald will represent self as personal i |
‘representative of Robert F. Kennedy who travelled to
(foreign city) for specific purpose meeting AMLASH/1

and giving him assurances of full support with

(Emphasis added).
The underscored portion--the word "with"--in fact read in the actual
document “if there is." This substitution of language in a purported
quotation may seem only a matter of nuance, but it treats with what
Fitzgerald planned to say, which takes on special significance when

. Matched with the expressly limited statements that he actually made

(as discussed at pages 11 and 12 of this annex) and what ANLASH/1

for the investigation at the time of the Warren Commission as stating
to the SSC that had they known about the AMLASH operation in 1963 it
would have affected the investigation. It is only noted that it is
likely that views elicited from CIA employees in 1975 probably were
responsive to representations by SSC staff members as to what the

operation involved, as distinguished from what it actually was.

At page 24 the SSC Final Report contains the following

statement:
"According to the 1967 Inspector General Report,

CIA Headquarters cabled the AMLASH case officer on
the morning of November 23, and ordered him to break
contact with AMLASH due to the President's assassi-
nation and to return to Headquarters."
This statement is at least a literary extension of the statement of
“the 1G report, which was in its entirety as follows:
- "(The case officer] states that he received an
OPIM cable from Fitzgerald that night or early
the next morning telling him that everything was
off."
The SSC was unable to get the case officer to support its expansion on
the reference in the 1967 IG report. His testimony is cited,
apparently despite suggestive prompting, that:

one person is involved--became a point of sufficient concern for CIA

co™N Some have speculated that AMLASH/1 was, in some way, Castro's
provocateur. Such a possibility is always a proper subject for
consideration. There are questions that feed the theory, but the

issue remains debatable. We do not offer an opinion here, although

we do note that he was rewarded strangely if he was. When finally
arrested he served ten years of a thirty-year term. His public trial !
did not mention his Agency associations for the period March 196] to :
November 1964.- An interesting consideration is that when Castro pro-
vided Senator McGovern with a list of persons the Cubans claimed had the

Different witnesses before the SSC would obviously view the AMLASH
affair in different lights, the basis for their understanding relating
to different levels of knowledge at different periods in time. What.
did they know in 1963, and what more did they learn under what circum-
stances at a later date? What they testified to in 1975--perhaps
on the basis of representations by SSC staff members as to what it
was--required quite a clear and precise treatment. The SSC Final
Report did not accord the subject that treatment.

kee eee ey *

At pages 78, 79 and 105 of the SSC Final Report reference is made
to a Cuban exile designated as “A," who informed the FBI and CIA in
mid-1965 of activities of AMLASH/1 in Cuba to eliminate Castro, and
of his involvement with CIA. A careful reading of the SSC Report made
it clear that “A” was unaware of AMLASH/1's 1963 associations with CIA.

This information, reported in the context of the badly blurred
time frame of the SSC Final Report, was given a significance that it
did not otherwise have. First, the information was a year and a half
after the death of President Kennedy. Further, the informant had no
knowledge of the earlier period of CIA-AMLASH/1 relationships. When
this is placed alongside the clear record of the inconclusive nature
of the relationships in the 1963 period, it becomes something of an
irrelevancy. It is noted that a footnote in the SSC Report, at this
point, records the fact that the book of material given to Senator
McGovern by Castro on persons who allegedly had plotted his

‘gecact
assassination also contained no reference to that period, although
AMLASH/1's later activities were cited.
ee

It fis useful to recap the sequence of events. The record shows
that initially there was uncertainty as to what AMLASH/1 represented
as a potential asset. There was early consideration of his defection,
which changed to his possible use for intelligence purposes. As his
self-discipline was assessed as being inadequate for this task it was
determined that it was best for him to go it ‘alone, developing his
own organization for whatever followed. The reservations that were
held concerning his qualities were reflected in the specifically
conditional arms-length position taken with him during the period
preceding President Kennedy's death. He had to succeed with his
‘own program before he could expect support from the U.S.

Eventually -- but not until after the death of President
Kennedy -- firmer indications of support were offered. Even then

< the volume of equipment promised was not large, especially to a

= man who claimed to have the "necessary people and equipment inside

- [Cuba] to accomplish (the) overthrow . . ." The nature of the

“ velationship never did firm up. As late as the fall of 1964
(page 77, Book V of the SSC Final Report) CIA was telling AMLASH/1

that it could not be associated with his concept of the first step
of a coup, which he viewed as requiring the death of Castro. While
one can reason that any association with AMLASH/1 included
association with all his plans, it nevertheless appears that those
directly involved structured their thinking differently.

Segael

a The Inspector General's report in 1967 treated the AMLASH
operation in its study of assassination, as did the SSC Interia
Report on Alleged Assassination Plots. At the time of the 1967 IG
report there was no issue of how to characterize the operation at
different times, and the question was not addressed. Facing that
question now, it is clear that however the operational relationship
developed after the death of President Kennedy, it was unformed and
without substance during his life. During that time it was not an
assassination plot. The treatment of this question in the SSC

Report is both imprecise and misleading,

DISSEMINATION OF REPORTS TO CI_STAFF

Since CI Staff held the Agency's official file on OSWALD,
all cable traffic (theoretically) including disseminations by
cable was sent to the Staff for filing in the official file. Ad-
ditionally, cables disseninations were released by CI/Liaison.
Copies were, therefore, available to the Staff.

Since CI Staff released 211 long-form CSCI's, coordinated
‘on short-form CSCI's, and maintained the CSCI log, the CI Staff
received copies of all CSCI's.

MEXICO CITY COVERAGE OF OSWALD VISIT



J

a acramnn UH Mens Hy

Intelligence Sources on Oswald's Visit
to Mexico City in 1963

J. Unilateral Coverage:

From the time the Mexico Station was opened in April
1947 until the arrival of Mr. Win Scott as Chief of Station in
1955, the Station had developed a support apparatus to exploit
leads from the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City. This umbrella
type project (LIPSTICK) consisted of multi-line phone taps, three
photographic sites, a mobile surveillance teem and a mail inter-
cept operation.

Telephone taps (LIFEAT) were placed by an employee of
the local telephone company who was handled by a Station case
officer. The number of lines tapped was limited only by the avail-
ability of a listening post nearby and the availability of language
(English, Spanish, Soviet, Polish, Czech, etc.) transcribers.
Generally, these were Mexican or Mexican-American recruited agents.

Three photographic sites were handled by a Station case
officer assisted by technicians on TDY from Headquarters who
advised the Station on the best types of cameras, films, and con-
cealment devices. These operations had sub-crypts under project
LIPSTICK (namely: LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA). LIMITED was a
fixed site directly opposite the Soviet Embassy (across the
street) which had both a vehicle and a pedestrian entrance. The



aaa

gate to the Soviet Embassy was on the northwest corner of the
Soviet compound and the LIMITED site was diagonally across a
double laned street on the southeast corner of that block (See
attached diagram). LIMITED was the first photo base and opera-
ted strictly on an experimental basis in the early stages. This
base, however, was closed when the Station received word that the
photograph of the “unidentified man" was being released by the
Warren Commission. LILYRIC was an alternate photographic base.

It was located in an upper story of an apartment building on the

i same side of the street as the LIMITED site but in the middle of

| the block south. It had a planted view of the front gate of the

: Soviet Embassy. LICALLA, the third photographic site, was located
i in one of a row of four houses on the south side of the Soviet

! Embassy compound. This site overlooked the back garden of the
Soviet Embassy compound. The purpose of this operation was to get
good identification photographs of Soviet personnel. The three
photographic sites were managed by a recruited agent who was a
Mexican citizen, the son of an Anerican mother and Mexican father
i (deceased). This agent collected the film from the LIMITED and

| LILYRIC sites three times a week. The film was then devleoped and
i printed into 8 x 10 contact print strips. LICALLA film was ori-
ginally processed in the Station but in early 1959, due to the
resignation of a technician, this film like that of LIMITED and
LILYRIC was processed on the outside by a recruited agent.

i
i
i


Siena

Mobile surveillance was conducted by two American
staff officers. These two officers organized a surveillance
team of six recruited agents which used late model cars and a
panel truck for surveillance. The team could be activated by
radio from the LIMITED site whenever someone of interest left
the gate of the Soviet Embassy. These agents were aware of
the LIMITED site since they had been issued LIMITED photographs
for identification purposes.

The Station also conducted a unilateral mail intercept.
operation, LIBIGHT, which was handled by an American case officer.
A recruited Mexican agent, who had a semi-official status, obtained
selected letters from a sub-agent employed by the Mexican postal
system.

2. Liaison Coverage:

Liaison coverage was unreliable and insecure as charac-
terized by the nature of the Mexican services at that time. The
Mexican Direction of Federal Security (DFS), with which we con-
ducted liaison, was a hip-pocket group run out of the Mexican
Ministry of Government. This Ministry was principally occupied
with political investigations and control of foreigners. Their
agents were cruel and corrupt. A Station officer trained a number
of them in name tracing and travel control. :

In 1958, at the instigation of a Mexican official, a
Joint telephone tap operation came into existence. The operation,

H
i
i
!
q

'
i
i


Sis jaacae

(Pte hata interes ee i

which became known as LIENVOY, was run by a Mexican officer.
The listening post had 30 lines connected at one time. The
transcription room was staffed by Mexican Army officers. In
1961, because of mismanagement by the Mexican principals,
the Station Chief, himself, became the project case officer.
A Station officer assisted him in the daily supervision of the
listening post and in picking up the transcripts and the tapes.
There was also an American technician inside the listening post.
3. Oswald Coverage:

In mid-1962, the Mexican officer in charge of LIENVOY
(the joint tap operation) asked the American officer at the
LIENVOY listening post for the telephone numbers of the Soviet,
Cuban and Satellite Embassies in anticipation of possible cover-
age. The Station immediately disconnected all of the unilateral
telephone taps on these Embassies so that they would not be dis-
covered when the Mexicans hooked up their taps. The Mexicans
soon thereafter connected five Cuban lines, five Soviet lines,
three Czech lines, two Polish lines, and one Yugoslav line. At
the listening post, a live monitor made short summaries of con-
versations of interest which were then included in a daily re-
sume for the Chief of Station. Later, when a reel was completely
recorded, full transcripts were typed and passed to the Station;
however, there was usually a time lag of a day or two. Reels
which contained Russian or a language other than Spanish or



on

FRCS ese. oeeuraraatfemneinen

English were taken to another jocation for translation and
typing. Mr. Boris Tarasoff did the Russian translations but
because of the volume of Russian conversations, the trans-
lations usually ran about a week behind the date of the con-
versation. All transcripts were made in either Spanish or
English since the Chief of Station could read only these two
languages and because he personally screened the transcripts
for operational leads.

As soon as the Station learned that an American iden-
tifying himself as Lee Oswald phoned the Soviet Embassy, Miss
Ann Goodpasture of the Station started screening al] photographs.
However, here again, there was a backlog because the photographs
were picked up three times a week, but those picked up were usually
for dates a few days before since the technician who was proces-
sing the film did so on a night-time basis. Further, photographs
were not made initially until a complete roll of film was used.
Later this was changed and the operator cleared the camera at the
end of each day regardless of amount of unused film remaining.
The instructions were to cover the entire work day (office hours)
and to photograph all Soviets, their families, all foreigners,
and cars with foreign license plates. Human error did occur but
generally the agents were conscientious. The Cuban Embassy cover-
age had more sophisticated equipment using a pulse camera which

frequently developed mechanical difficulties.

Oswald came to the attention of the listening post
operators from a tap of the Soviet line. It was picked up and
taken to Mr. Boris Tarasoff for translation because the caller
was trying to speak in Russian. There was some delay because
Station personnel waited to review the photographs coincidentally
with the typed transcript.

Titled "CIA Tied to False Oswald Story”

B. Identification of the Mr. X in the
Anderson Column

1. The attached colunn, citing the testimony of a Nr. X,
alleges thot a CIA agent tried to link Cswald to Cuban intelli-
gence officers in Mexico. There is, of course, no substance to
the colura's allegations. The colunn identifies the source as
Mr. X because of attempts on his life, but subsequently gives
enough information on Mr. X to establish his identity.

2. According to the Anderson column, Hr. X was First ret
by his CIA contact in Havana before relations with U.S./Cuba sere
severed. Mr. X had helped to organize bank accountants to ci-
bezzle Cuban governnent funds to finance anti-Castro causes.
Mr. X was reportedly recru ted by a Horris Bishop (CIA contact),
to ‘plan an atteapt on Castro's life. The plan nas to fire 2
bazooka from a nearby apartment building while Castro “as deliver-
ing one of his sarathoa speeches. According to the Anderso:
colunn, the plot discovered by Castro's police and Mr.
escaped to Miami. Ur. X alse reportesly tried to assassinate
Castro in Chile in 1971 in league ith the Venezuelan Luis feso-a
Carriles, who is now being detained in Caracas for the 6 Qc~oder
Cubana airline honbing. The Andersor colunn ends with the report
that Mr. X worked for CIA until 1973 for expenses, but “as paid
$253,000 in cash by Norris Bishop a he was terninated.

for visas for ten relatives of the four nen as med to kill Castro,
and also requested four MI rifles with adapters for grenades plus
eight grenades. The COS did not encourage VECIANA and subsequeatly
checked with an hassy officer who reported that VECIANA had made
similar "wild-eyed" proposals to hin. On 23 Novezber 1961 the

Miani News published a report of an unsucce ful attempt by Antonio
VECIANA to kill Castro. VECIANA reportedly had arranged to
assassinate Castro and Cuban President Osvaldo Dorticos on S October
in Havana, but the bazooka he was using failed to fire.

VECIA

4, There has been no Agency relationship with VECIANA. A
POA, which was granted for his use in para-military affairs in
January 1962, expired in November 1962. VECIANA was born on
4 October 1955 in Havana. He was a nenber of the People's Rex
lutionary Movement, an anti-Castro group in Cuba during 1960-61, and
was one of the founders of Alpha-66. A certified public acc:
by trade, VECIANA was with AJI.D. in La Paz in 198-72. VE 3
was registered in ISR to the U.S. Aray in November 1962 and he
was terminated without prejudice in July 1966. Ca 23 July 1962
VECIANA was interviewed, at his request, by Mr. tiarry Real from
the. DCD New York office. VECIANA asxed Real to arrange a meeting
with a senior CIA officer to discuss Alpha-06's plans to assassinate
Castro and to request CIA's assistance (U.S.$100,000; 10,000 Cuban
pesos; 48 hand grenades). There is no indication that this request
was ever acted upon by CIA.

*S. In April 1966 a LA Division officer, Johx R. Lucy, using
the alias John Livingston, met VECIANA in Xew orx City. The
meeting was arranged by a retired naval officer, Janes Cogswell?

who had informed Chief, Wil Division that he had iaformation of valuc
concerning Cubz When Lucy arrived in New York City for the meeting,
he was introduced by Cogswell to VECIANA. He imagdiately launched

a discussion of the Cuban political situation and noted his strong
fecling that the only solution was the assassination of Castro.

Lucy advised VECIANA that he was in no position to provide hin with
assistance or encuuri him in an assa ation attempt and was only
interested in gathering information ich he thought was the purpose
of the meeting. VECIANA subscquently said that his roommate Felix
ZABALA, a Cuban refugee, had excellent contacts ia Havana, It was
clear to Lucy, however, VECIANA was attenpting te use ZABALA poten-
tially to get Agency financial support for his erganization.

ivities off the preund. lucy indicated to ¥ ANA that he
would lock into the Z\RALA matter and would probably arrange for
ZABALA to be contacted in Puerto Rico,

6. There is no indication in the file that any Agency officer
in contact with ¥ECIANA ever used an alias Morris Bishop. There is
‘no Morris Bishcp listed in true nane in the D0 roils. There vas
never any contractual relationship with VECIANA and he was not
paid CIA funds.

7. On li January 1977 a sanitized copy of VECIANA's 201 file
was made available to staffers from the Senate Select Committee on

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Counterintelligence Staff

FROL : Russell 8. Holmes
CI Operations Croup

SUBJECT : Article by Norman Kempster Appearing in
the Los Angeles Times of 1 January 1977
and Entitled "CIA sithheld Data on Oswald"
(copy attached)

In light of the inaccurate and misleading statements
attributed by Kespster to Sprague, the following comments are
offered in rebuttal.

a. "The CIA withheld from the FBI for almost
two months in IS0> information taat Lee Rarvey Uswald
had talked with Cuban and Sovret oiticials about his”

Sire tO Visit tiose countries .- -

Comment: Oswald's name did not surface in Mexico City until
Tctober 1963 when a hitherto unicown male telerhoned the
Soviet Exbassy. During this telephone call, the caller identi-
fied himself as “Lee Oswald.” Cn 8 October 1963, the Mexico
City Station cabled to headquarters the highlights of the
transcript of the conversation.

(2) On 1 October 1963, an Anerican male who
spoke broken Russian and said his nane was Lee
Oswald (phonetic), stated he was at the Soviet
Exbassy on 28 Septerber sen he spoke with a consul
whon he believed to be Valeriy Viadinirovich
Kostikov. Oswald asked the Soviet guard Ivan
Qbyedkov, who answered, if there was anything new
regarding a telegran to Washington. Obyedkov upon
checking said nothing had been received yet, but
the request had been sent.

(2) Mexico Station said it had photographs of
a male who appeared to be an American entering the
Soviet Embassy at 1216 heurs, leaving at 1222 an
1 October. His apparent age was” athletic
build, about six feet, receding hairline, balding
top. Nore khakis and sport shirt.

les


ao

eetigtes

(3) No local dissemination was being made by
the Station. [MEXI 6453 (IN 36017), 8 October. ]

(Note: Cablese has been rendered here into readable English,
without substantive changes or omissions. Cryptonyms and
pseudonyms have been omitted or put into clear text.)

The above information was received in Headquarters on
9 October; the following day Headquarters incorporated this
information in an electrical dissemination to the Federal Bureau
of Investigation, the Departzent of State, the Department of
the Navy, and the Immigration and Naturalization Service.

(1) On 1 October 1963 a reliable and sensitive
source in Mexico reported that an American male
who identified himself as Lee Oswald, contacted the
Soviet Embassy in Mexico City inquiring whether the
Embassy had received any news concerning a telegram
which had been sent to Washington. The American
was described as approximately 35 years old, with an
athletic build, about six feet tall, with a “receding”
hairline. .

(2) It is believed that Oswald may be identical
to Leé Henry [sic] Oswald, born on 18 October 1939
in New Orleans, Louisiana, a former U.S. Marine who
defected to the Soviet Union in October 1959 and later
made arrangements through the United States Embassy
in Moscow to return to the United States with his
Russian-born wife, Marina Nikolaevna Pusakova [sic]
and their child.

(3) The informtion in paragraph (1) is being
disseminated to your representatives in Mexico City.
Any further information received on this subject
will be fumished you. This information is being
made available to the Immigration and Naturalization
Service. [DIRECTOR 74673, 10 October 1963.]

(Note: It should be pointed out that for some unknown reason ‘ ri
the Headauarters desk responsible for making the dissemination
neglected to include the infornation that Oswald had visited the
Soviet Enbassy on 28 September 1963.)

It was not until 22 Noverber 1963, when the Station initiated
a review of all transcripts of telephone calls to the Soviet Embassy



that the Station leamed that Oswald's call to the Soviet Embassy
on 1 October 1963 was in connection with his request for a visa
to the USSR. Because he wanted to travel to the USSR by way of
Cuba, Osvald had also visited the Cuban Embassy in an attempt to
obtain a visa allowing him to transit Cuba.

Inasmuch as Oswald was not an investigative responsibility
of the CLA and because the Agency had not received an official
Tequest from those agencies having investigative responsibility
Tequesting the Agency to obtain further information, the Station
did nothing other than ask Headquarters on 15 October 1963 for
a photograph of Oswald. [MEXI 6534 (IN 40357), 15 October 1963.)
On 25 October 1963, Headquarters sent a request to the Department
of the Navy for a photograph of Oswald. (DIRECTOR 77978,

24 October 1963.] It was not until 26 November 1963, however,
that the Navy Department apparently responded to this Tequest by
sending directly to the Mexico City Station a photograph of Oswald.

In response to a question from the Warren Comnission, the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, on 6 April 1963 stated that:

“The investigation of Oswald in 1963 prior to receipt
of the Central Intelligence Agency comumication .
dated 10 October 1963 was directed toward the primary
objective of ascertaining the nature of Oswald's
sympathies for, and connection with, the FPCC (Fair
Play for Cuba Committee) or subversive elements. The
Central Intelligence Agency coczumication which
reported that a man, tentatively identified as Oswald,
had inquired at the Soviet Embassy conceming a
telegram which had been sent to Nashington did not
specify the nature of the telegram. This contact
with the Soviet Embassy interjected a new aspect into
the investigation and raised the obvious questions of
why he was in Mexico and exactly what were his
relatims with the Soviets. However, the information
available was not such that any additional conclusions
could be drawn as to Oswald's sympathies, intentions
or activities at that time. Thus, one of the objectives
of the continuing investigation was to ascertain the
nature of his relations with the Soviets considering
: the possibility that he could have been recruited by
: the Soviet Intelligence Services. The Central
‘ Intelligence Agency corrmmication, dated 10 October 1963,
sine stated that any further information received concerning
Oswald would be furnished and that our liaison repre-
>) sentatives in Mexico City were being advised. On

Oe



B tied

ar a

18 October 1963, one of our FBI liaison repre-
sentatives in Mexico City was furnished this infor-
mation by Central Intelligence Agency and he arranged
follow-up with Central Intelligence Agency in Mexico
City for further information and started a check to
establish Oswald's entry into Mexico. Subsequent to
the assassination, Central Intelligence Agency also
advised us of Oswald's contact with the Cuban Embassy
in Mexico City at the time of his visit there."

[Comnission Exhibit No. 833 (FBI Letter to J. Lee Rankin,
dated 6 April 1964).]

b. "Chief Counsel Richard A, Sprague said that the
committee staff had learned that a Cl message des-
Gribing Oswald's activities in ‘exico to federal

agencies such as the Fal had been rewritten to elimi-
hate any mention of his request tor Cuban and Soviet

Visas.” The message was sent _in Uctober, more than a month
before the November 22,1963 assassination.
Comment: It is not CLA practice to disseminate raw information in
‘the form it is received from the field. Field Teports are received
in Headquarters where they are first reviewed by the action desk.
The informaticn is then written in a form suitable for dissemination
to the intelligence commmity, including additional information, -

df available, from the Agency's central counterintelligence files
to make the report more meaningful to the recipient (s).

Upon learning that on 1 October 1963 an American identifying
himself as Lee Oswald had telephoned the Soviet Embassy, the Mexico
City Station cabled to Headquarters on 8 October 1963 the highlights of
Oswald's conversation with the Embassy. Because the Station at that
time did not know that Oswald was Lee Harvey Oswald and that he had
come to Mexico to apply for visas to the Soviet Union and Cuba, the
Station reported only that information obtained through telephone
tap operation against the Soviet Enbassy.

On 10 October 1963, the day after it received the informition
relating to Lee Oswald and his contact with the Soviet Embassy,
Headquarters incorporated this information in an electrical dissemi-
nation to the commmity and included a brief summary of biographic
information obtained from central counterintelligence files on the
possible identity of Lee Oswald. Since Headquarters had no indi-
cation before 22 Novenber that Oswald had gone to Mexico to apply
for Cuban and Soviet visas, there was no question of eliminating any



pe

mention of Oswald's request for such visas.

Within its limitations and capabilities, Mexico Station had
complied with the Agency regulations pertaining to reporting on
Americans abroad. The Station had informed Headquarters which in
turn had alerted those agencies with an investigative or policy
interest in Oswald as an American in the United States. Headquarters
also instructed the field station to inform the local representatives
of those agencies.

As mentioned above, the action desk in Headquarters neglected,
for unknown reasons, to include the fact that Oswald had visited
the Soviet Embassy on 28 September 1963. Had this information been
included it would have indicated to recipients of the Teport that
Oswald had more than a fleeting reason to be in contact with the
Embassy; however, as already stated, the reason for the 28 September
contact and the subject of the telegram to Washington were, at that
time, unknown.

c. "The CIA's decision to withhold information
was reversed shortly after Kennedy was killed.

Conment: This statement is patently false and misleading. It is
totally incompatible with Sprague's remarks to Agency representatives
in Headquarters on 24 November 1976, i.e., "he will not Prejudge the
Agency for any sins of ‘omission or commission.”

-- 6 --

It was only after the news of the assassination had reached the
Station that the Station initiated a review of its heldings. As
a result of this review, the Station learned that Oswald had also
visited the Cuban Embassy and that Oswald's contacts with the two
embassies were in connection with his desire to travel to the
Soviet Union by way of Cuba.

As to what “other agencies" might have done had they had more
information, attention is drawn to the FBI's comment in response
to the Warren Conmission’s question. According to the FBI's
response, some investigation had been initiated on or about
18 October in Mexico. By the 25th of October, FBI headquarters had
informed its field office in New Orleans "that another Agency had
determined that Lee Oswald was in contact with the Soviet Embassy
in Mexico City in the early part of October 1963." The New Orleans
field office in tum informed the Dallas office which kad juris-
diction over Oswald's place of residence. (For further detail, see
IV H 447 and 459.) There was, however, no Tequest, oficial or
otherwise, from any of the responsible departments and agencies in
Washington for further details as to Oswald's presence in Mexico
and his reasons for contacting the Soviet Embassy.

£. "The committee said its staff investigators
had Tecently questioned a former CIA agent who had
personal knowledge" of Oswald's visits to the Scv

an an embassies in Nexico. As a result of aa:
Interview, the report said, staff members were sext to
Nexico, where they found and questioned additionat

witnesses.

t

Comment: Sprague's characterization "a former CIA agent” is probably
in reference to David Phillips. The latter's "revelaticns” to staff
investigators (and also to Ronald Kessler) were unfortunate to say
the least, in that they were inaccurate, so far as we mow. There

is no indication in the Oswald files that Oswald wanted to make a
deal with the Soviets in return for a free trip to the USSR. The
“additional witnesses" in Mexico, it is believed, are Zoris Tarasov
and his wife, both of whom had been under contract with the Agency

in 1963. We have not been informed, officially or otherwise, by
Sprague what Phillips and the Tarasovs told the staff investigators.

g- " 'These witnesses had never been sought cut
before by any investigative body, notwithstanding the
act that they had important information cenceming
Statezents by Lee Harvey Oswald in ‘exico within co

Teport said.

Comment: If "these witnesses" include people other than the Tarasovs
it would be impossible, at this time, to make an appropriate comment.
The fact remains, however, that if Sprague had obtained additional
details, he should hold such information and not make it public
until the Agency has had a chance to review it and comment. There
are many examples in the Oswald files of statements made by people
claiming to have knowledge of Lee Harvey Oswald which have been
proven to be fabrications. One such person was Gilberto Nolasco
Alvarado Ugarte who, on November 1963, came to the U.S.
Embassy in Mexico City. He clained he had been in the Cuban
Consulate in Mexico City on 18 September 1963 when a man he later
recognized to be Lee Harvey Oswald received $6,500 in cash to kill
an important person in the United States. After thorough investi-
gation by Mexican authorities, the Mexico City Station, and the FBI,
it was concluded that Alvarado had completely fabricated his story

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence
VIA + Deputy Director of Central Intelligence

FROM : John H. Waller
Inspector General

‘SUBJECT : President Kennedy Assassination - Mrs. Luce Story

1. Action Required: None; for information only.

2. Background: In 1975, Mrs. Clare Boothe Luce telephonically
informed Director Willian Colby of suprort she had rendered to certain
Cubans who were conducting their own jndependent operations against
the Castro Government in 1961 ‘and 1352. firs. Luce stated, that she and
Nr. William Pawley, an American financier 1029 associated with the
Dominican Republic, helped finance a rotorboat for three Cubans. The
three Cubans, concurrently, were members of.a CIA supported Cuban
exile organization. After the 1962 missile crisis, all resistance
groups against Castro were ordered to cease operations. At this time,
Hrs. Luce and Mr. Pawley 21so ceased their financial support. In
1963, very shortly after the assassinasion of President Kennedy, the
Cuban captain of the motordoat, which Hes. Luce helped to subsidize,
phoned Mrs. Luce to infora ker that "Sswald was a hired gun". She, in
turn, informed him to tell all to the FBI. At the behest of Director
Colby, Hrs. Luce passed the story on to Senator Richard Schweiker, .
chairman of the subcommittee investigating the Warren Cormission Report.

Aversion of the information was given to columist Betty
Beale and was published in the Hashington Star on 16 Kovenber 1875
(attached). A staff member of the Senate Select Comittee, on 10
December 1975, inquired es to what the Agency thought of the story.
The Agency oral response was that it had nothing to add to the news-
paper story and that since this query involved U.S. resident Cuban
refugees, the FBI would be the proper agency to contact.

fro



The transcripts were réceived by CIA's Inspector
on 22 December 1976 from Mr. Colby's secretary. At the sugces
of the Inspector General, the Office of Security sent copies of the
transcripts and a background note to the Federal Sureau of Investi-
gation in January 1977. ‘ve do not kncw whether the FBI passed this
information to the House Select Cormittee on Assassinations.

This story is summarized here for your backsround in the
event that it should be replayed by the press as a result of releases
which may be made by the House Assassination Subcommittee. While it is
not a new story, the actual CIA transcript of Mrs. Luce's conversation
with Mr. Colby could be considered newsworthy and could be presented
in a manner detrimental to CIA.

MEMORANDUM

SUBJECT: Transcripts of October 1975 Telephone Conversations
Between Director Colby, Mrs. Clare Boothe Luce and
Mr. Justin McCarthy

1. Attached herewith are transcripts of two telephone conversations
between Director William Colby and Mrs. Clare Boothe Luce, and one between
Director William Colby and Mr. Justin McCarthy. The conversations took
place in October 1975 and discuss Mrs. Luce's concern that certain infor-
mation, from a former boat captain, a Cuban refugee, regarding the Presi-
dent Kennedy assassination, reached the proper authorities. While the
information in these transcripts have been provided to investigating
authorities, they may be of some assistance to the House Select Committee
on Assassinations as it investigates various allegations.

2. The transcripts were received by the Agency Inspector General on
22 December 1976. The transcript of the 25 October 1975 conversation was
typed by Ms. Barbara Pindar on the same day. The other two transcripts
were typed by Ms. Pindar on 21 December 1976 from her stenographic records
while clearing out the remainder of Director Colby's files. Ms. Pincar
was Mr. Colby's secretary during his Directorship.

3. A version of the telephone conversation transcript was published
in the Washington Star on 16 November 1975 (attached). A staff member of
the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, on 10 December 1975, inquired
as to what the Agency thought of the story. The Agency oral response was
that it had nothing to add to the newspaper story and that since this
query involved U.S. resident Cuban refugees, the FBI would be the proper
agency to contact.



4. The attached transcripts indicate that the matter was brought to
5 the attention of Senator Schweiker and The Federal Bureau of Investigation.
i (Telephone conversation between Director Colby and Mrs. Clare Boothe Luce
: : on 25 October 1975, pages 2 and 3).
