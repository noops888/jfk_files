“Ryan said that he had just been informed by the DDP (Karamessines)

that Hunt was to bé assigned to Madrid as DCOS,.as a directed assign-
ment by Helms, A meémo was prepared and sent to the COS, Jim Noel
(now retired), There was nothing further for about a month when Ryan.
called Colemar in and showed him a RYBAT letter from Noel stating
that Ambassador Stanley J. Woodward would nct have Hunt.in the

Embassy.

The vouchgrs were ‘not large, although the dociimentation was poor,
Coleman raised the question with Ryan about his signing off, and
Ryan said he could talk to Karamessines if he wished, Because
Coleman had x close personal association with Karamessines he
did just that, He was told-by Karamessines that he didn't know much
about it cither--"'Helms said send him out." He ‘was instructed to go

ahead.

5. In early. July 1966 (4 July) Coleman went to Madrid: He" ~

6. Several months ago Noel was at a seminar at which
Ambassador Woodward was also present, -At the time he asked
about Hunt, Woodward said it might still be dragged into the press.
Tad Szulc had been after Woodward about the Hunt assignment to
Spain, Coleman observed that Szule did have a long article on Hunt
in the New York Times, and the Spain assignment was mentioned,

1...On the morning ‘of 14 February 1974 Messrs.

A. Rocca, Deputy Chief, Counter Intelligence Operations, .
The purpose of the interview was to follow up on infor-

“mation contained in Office of Security files which stated

the belief that individuals inthe Counter Intelligence

Operations office had knowledge of tha writing acrivitios

or Mr, E. Howard Hunt. This belief was a matter of record
in the files of the forner Security Research Staf£ and was
attributed to Mr. Paul Gaynor, now retired, and Mr. Edward

Sayle,

2. During this “interviaw Mr. Rocca was specifically
askad whether or not he had knowledge of tho existence of
any form of official Sponsorship or encouvagement to Mr.
E, Howard Hunt.to write novels to inprove the image of
this: Agency. Additionally, Mr. Rocca was asked waether
oF not any assistance’ was ever requested of the Counter
Tatellizgencs Operations offica‘to be provided to Mr. Hunt

or. whether or not that Staff had-ever had any relationship. . ;

with Mr.-Hunt. whatsoever. ‘In “tesponse to theso questions.
Mz. “Rocca responded’ "ion the. record" that he ‘has no knowledge -
of any such. arrangements nor at any time was he party to any
assistance or any raquests for assistance to Mr. Hunt, Mr.
‘Rocca stated that the particular. section which he had been

for handling a variaty of tasks categorized under the area

oF “sotting the record ‘straight." Ih this scase, the "image"
mission of ‘the offica was to counter misinformation . cur-

ly in the media or-othetwise believed to be part of an

assumption that Mr.‘ Hunt was engaged in any form of Agoncy
sponsored image activity would have. Probably load to the-
concluston that it was done under the Counter Intelligence
Cpezations. . However, Mr. Rocca enphatically stated that

this was not the case. ;

remain as written. Royalties from the fictional works, that he writes as
2 Profitable hobby will not be emoluments received tom Gr through his
