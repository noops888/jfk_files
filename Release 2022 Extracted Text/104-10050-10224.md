SU"JECT: Relay in sending the first cable about
OSWALD

1. Much has been written about the delay (by. the Mexico
Station) ins ending the first cable requesting traces on the
name Lee OSWALD. It was discussed in Dave Phillips book as a
case of laziness on the part of the Soviet case officer (which
in w view was unjust and unnecessary and indicates that Dave
didn't know what he was’ talking about).

daa eae ee

2. Normally, the Spanish transcript for the 1 Octo,
convers ation would have been picked up on the morning-#f he
2nd of October. ‘The Russian language portion wuld‘Rave:gone
to the Russ ian/English transcriber on the 3rd géroetoper. the
trans lation’ would have been returned the follawing day (4th)
at which time, the Soviet case officer woykd have’a ked for
the photographic coverage. ‘That coverage wuld 1 not have been
in the station before the 7th s ince the, oe was still in the
camera on the 3rd of October and it\'was ‘picked up probably on
the 4th, processed and passed sStation on the next work
da which would have been M Bectober.

>

3. Later the film wasQbwken out of the camera every day
but at that time, the filmstayed in the camera until a full -
rotl was completed which might take three or four das.

4. A name trace could have been requested on the bas is oa
of the name alone but that wasn't the wy Win Scott ran that
Station. He wanted the photographic coverage tied in with the
telephone coverage ..s ometimesthere_was..a U.S. .automobile
license number. It was also part of the "numbers game" of
jus tify ing a project ty the number of dis patches, cables or
reports produced.

Mexico Station Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Embassies (1953) |

1. Unilateral Coverage:
From the time the Mexico Station was opened in April 1947 until

the arrival of Mr. Win Scott as Chief of Station in 1955, the Station had

developed a support apparatus to exploit leads from the Soviet Embassy in
Mexico City. This umbrella type project cuursrigaeinsted of multitine

phone taps, three photographic sites, a sn pve lance. team and a |

mail intercept operation.
4 Telephone taps (| yagi laced by an employee of the local !
telephone company w! ef by a Station case officer. The number 1
of lines tapped en only by the availability of a listening post i

nearby and the availability of langauge (English, Spanish, Soviet, Polish,

Czech, etc.) transcribers. Generally, these were Mexican or Mexican-

- American recruited agents.

Three photographic sites were handled by a Station case officer.

+ assisted by technicians on TOY from Headquarters who advised the Station
on-the best types of cameras, films, and concealment devices. These
operations had sub-crypts under project LIPSTICK (namely: LIMITED, LILYRIC
and LICALLA). LIMITED was a fixed site directly opposite the Soviet Em-
bassy (across the street) which had both a vehicle and a pedestrian en-

trance. The gate to the Soviet Embassy was on the northwest corner of the

Soviet compound and the LIMITED site was diagonally across a double laned
street on the southeast corner of that block. (See attached diagram).
LIMITED was the first photo base and operated strictly on an experimental
basis in the early stages. This base, however, was closed when the Sta-
tion received word that the photograph of the “unidentified man" was
being released by the Warren Commission. LILYRIC was an alternate photo-
‘ graphic base. It was located in an upper story of an apartment building
‘on the same side of the street as the LIMITED site ve bei ye middle of
° the block south. It had a Planted view of tl c ne jate of the Soviet
Embassy. LICALLA, the third photogray AS re jas located in one of a

row of four houses on the af ‘the Soviet Embassy compound.

This site overlooked the, fen a the Soviet Embassy compound. The
‘ purpose of this “oe get good identification photographs of
Soviet personnel. The three photographic sites were managed by a re-
cruited agent who was a Mexican citizen, the son of an American mother
and Mexican father (deceased). This agent collected the film from the
LIMITED and LILYRIC sites three times a week: The film was then de~
veloped and printed into 8 x 10 contact print strips. LICALLA film was
originally processed in the Station but in early 1959, due to the resig-
nation of.a technician, this film like that of LIMITED and LILYRIC was

processed on the outside by a recruited agent.

Mobile surveillance was conducted by two American staff officers.
These two officers organized a surveillance team of six recruited agents
which used Tate model cars and a panel truck for surveillance. The team
could be activated by radio from the LIMITED site whenever someone of
interest left the gate of the Soviet Embassy. These agents were aware of
the LIMITED site since they had been issued LIMITED photographs for
identification purposes.

The Station also conducted a unilateral a= operation, i
LIBIGHT, which was handled by an American ca; er.
Mexican agent, who had a sor SS

LIENVOY, was run by a Mexican officer. The listening post had 30 lines |
connected at one time. The transcription room was staffed by Mexican

Army officers. In 1961, because of mismanagement by the Mexican prin-

cipals, the Station chief, himself, became the project case officer. A i
Station officer assisted him in the daily supervision of the listening j
post, and in picking up the transcripts and the tapes. There was also
an American technician inside the listening post. |

3. Oswald Coverage:
In mid-1962, the Mexican officer in charge of LIENVOY (the

Joint tap operation) asked the American officer at the engy listening
post for the telephone numbers of the Soviet, nee ane satellite En-
bassies in anticipation of possible coverage’ Se Se rion immediately

disconnected all of the unilateral

taps on these Embassies so
that they would not be disc; the Mexicans hooked up their
taps. The Mexicans << ‘ter connected five Cuban lines, five
Soviet lines, three Czeth lines, two Polish lines, and one Yugoslav
line. At the listening post, a live monitor. made short summaries of
conversations of interest which were then included in a daily resume
for the Chief of Station. Later, when a reel was completely recorded,
full transcripts were typed and passed to the Station; however, there

was usually a time lag of a day or two, Reels which contained Russian

for translation and typing. Mr. Boris Tarasoff did the Russian transla-

usually ran about a week behind the date of the conversation.

for a long term lease on the top floor of a new apartment blding to be built
on this site).  LILYRIC was planned es an alternate photo base to LIMITED.

It was in an upper storey (3rd floor -check) on the same side of the street

as LEAITED but in the middle of the block South. It had a slentéd view of

the front gate of the Soviet Ecbassy. The agents in LIMITED and LILYRIC (both

Vexican families) as far as we knew, were not acquainted with each other.

27 September 1963, Soviet Embassy Chancery 15-61-55

Item 295, page 3

At 1626 hours, A Soviet calls from the Soviet Embassy Chancery
to the Cuban Consulate and asks for Sylvia DURAN. He asks

DURAN if

the american has been there.

DURAN: Yes, he is still here.

Copy 2oF 7

According to the letters that he showed them from the (Soviet)
Consulate in Washington, he wants’ to go to the USSR to stay

a long time with his wife who is Russian, but also the

answer had not been received (by him) regarding his problem.
That accordingly these transactions take 4 or 5 months but
without prior approval from the USSR, they have to request
and even then, they could not issue the visa hene”(in Mexico
City) without asking Washington. Yet accordingly* this man
(the American), showed him a letter inwhichhe’(the
American) is a menber of an organization. in favor of Cuba

and said that the Cubans could not Pive*hint the visa without
the Russian visa and now the Sgyiet “goesn't know what to do
with him, because he has r’the answer from
Washington. 4g
..with them also, bs yroblem with him (the Anerican)

is that he doesn!«*furysaryone in Cuba and in that case it
is very ie ve him a visa, because he was

thinking of sing his visa, because he knew it was
going to take ‘along time waiting for the Russian visa in
Cuba, and then go on to the USSR.

..that the thing is that if his (the American) wife were

now in Washington (and) going to receive the visa right now
or the permission from the USSR to return to her country, (if)
she is going to receive her visa in Washington, then having
this visa, she can communicate to whatever place, this
permission, for example, here or in any other place (he) can
receive it, but right now they do not have them.

..certainly and neither can (the Cubans) give him a letter
because they do not know if the visa will be approved.

They can only give the visa according to instructions.

Then that is what she will put on his application.

Neither can I give him any letter of recommendation because

I don't know him and pardon me for bothering you.

It.was no bother, thank you very much.

Item 74, page 2

An unidentified man (speaking Spanish) calls the Soviet Embassy
Consulate at 1037 hours and asks for the Consul. He is told that
the Consul is not there. The unidentified man asked what is needed
to get visas to go to Odessa. He is told to call back at 1130 hours.

Item 137, page 2

At 1235 hours 4 man named ALATRISTE (not a Soviet) from inside the
Soviet Embassy Consulate calls out to number 45-37-72 (Colonial
Anerica, probably a pension or hotel but number not listed in the
telephone directory) and speaks with a man named SAN ROMAN.
ALATRISTE says that he is in the Russian Embassy and they need to
mow what day the boat "KALONIA" will arrive in Odessa, that the
Soviets will also need copies of the passenger manifest

(One concludes that ALATRISTE and SAN ROMAN are shipping-Yepresentatives
for the boat "KALONIA", and needed routine visa information.\’First

a call was made to the first listing for the Soviet Embassy in the
Mexican telephone directory (which turned out=to be the Military Attache).
They got the phone number for the Consulate andthe address. After
making a call to the Consulate and learning that it would not be open
until 1130 hours, ALATRISTE went. a@>thas address to get the needed
information.)

: SS.

Just after 1600 hours, ‘the Soviet Consulate received a call from the
Cuban Consulate (Sylvia DURAN) who said she had there a U.S. citizen
who had requested a transit visa to Cuba because he is going to the
USSR. DURAN wants to know with whom he spoke at the Soviet Embassy
because she sent him over to them telling him that if the Soviets
approved the visa then the Cubans would give him one without anything
more, advising the (Department of) Immigration in Cuba. She wants
to know with whom he spoke because he says that he doesn't know
either with what person and who told him that certainly there would
be no problem. The Soviet asks DURAN to wait a minute. After a
short wait DURAN explains the same thing to another Soviet. ‘This
Soviet tells her to leave her telephone (number) and her name and
someone will return the call. DURAN gives her name and telephone
number 11-28-47 then says as a personal thing, she has moved and

has not advised them of a change of address so will not receive their
Bulletin and can give it to them now. The Soviet asks her to call
KOU in order to change that address and asks for the name

of the (Cuban) Cultural Attache. DURAN says it is Teresa PROENZA
whose mmber is 14-13-26. The Soviet thanks her.

With regard to that, Nicareguan's, allegations thet the man was in the

Cuban Embassy on 18 September, I undérstand we do have information that
he applied for a tourist card about the 15th of September. ‘there is a
record showing entry into Mexico on September 26. On about the 15th he

applied in New Orleans for a tourist caf. We do know he was in -

As you know, he was in

He was last seen by the landlady Now we have immigration records showing him
entering Mexico on the 26th which very strongly suggests that he was not in Mexico
oa the 18th. what we are trying to find out is where he was every single day -

the 25th, 2ith, and all the way back. I think the Nicaraguan story is fabricated
