Mexico Station Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Embassies (1963)

:.:

1. Unilateral Coverage:

From the time the Mexico Station was opened in April 1947 until

the arrival of Mr. Win Scott as Chief of. Station in 1955, the Station had

developed a support apparatus to exploit leads from the Soviet Embassy in

Mexico City. This umbrella type project (LIPSTICK

tited only by the availability of a listening post

nearby and the availability of langauge (English, Spanish, Soviet, Polish,

Czech, etc.) transcribers. Generally, these were Mexican or Mexican-

• American recruited agents.

Three photographic sites were handled by a Station case officer

: assisted by technicians on TDY from Headquarters who advised the Station

on the best types of cameras, films, and concealment devices. These

operations had sub-crypts under project LIPSTICK (namely: LIMITED, LILYRIC

and LICALLA). LIMITED vas a fixed site directly opposite the Soviet Em-

bassy (across the street) which had both a vehicle and a pedestrian en-

trance. The gate"

to the Soviet Embassy was on the northwest corner of the

• Soviet compound and the LIMITED site was diagonally across a double laned

street on the southeast corner of that block. (See attached diagram).

LIMITED was the first photo base and operated strictly on an experimental

basis in the early stages. This base, however, was closed when the Sta-

tion received word that the photograph of the "unidentified man" was

being released by the Warren Commission. LILYRIC was an alternate photo-

graphic base. It was located in an upper story of an apartment building

on the same side of the street as the LIMITED site bu

the middle of

the block south. It had a planted view of the

Agate of the Soviet

Embassy. LICALLA, the third photograph

was located in one of a

row of four houses on the south

a the Soviet Embassy compound.

This site overlooked the

gorden of the Soviet Embassy compound. The

purpose of this operat

Tanawas to get good identification photographs of

Soviet personnel. The three photographic sites were managed by a re-

cruited agent who was a Mexican citizen, the son of an American mother

and Mexican father (deceased). This agent collected the film from the

LIMITED and LILYRIC sites three times a week. The film was then de-

veloped and printed into 8 x 10 contact print strips. LICALLA film was

originally processed in the Station but in early 1959, due to the resig-

nation of a technician, this film like that of LIMITED and LILYRIC was

processed

on the outside by a recruited agent.

Mobile surveillance was conducted by two American staff officers.

These two officers organized a surveillance team of six recruited agents

which used late model cars and a panel truck for surveillance. The team

could be activated by radio from the LIMITED site whenever someone of

interest left the gate of the Soviet Embassy. These agents were aware of

the LIMITED site since they had been issued LIMITED photographs for

identification purposes.

The Station also conducted a unilateral

2. Liaison Coverage:

Liaison coverià

was unreliable and insecure as characterized by

the nature of the Mexican

services at that time. The Mexican Direction

of Federal Security (DFS), with which we conducted liaison, was a hip-

pocket group run out of the Mexican Ministry of Government. This Ministry

was principally occupied with political investigations and control of

foreigners. Their agents were wist test, and corrupt.

A Station

officer trained a number of them in name tracing and travel control. In

1958, at the instigation of a Mexican official, a joint telephone tap

operation came into existence.

LIENVOY, was run by a Mexican officer. The listening post had 30 lines

connected at one time. The transcription room was staffed by Mexican

Army officers. In 1961, because of mismanagement by the Mexican prin-

cipals, the Station chief, himself, became the project case officer. A

Station officer assisted him in the daily supervision of the listening

post, and in picking up the

transcripts and the tapes.

There was also

an American technician inside the listening post.

joint tap operation) asked

taps. The Mexicans so

eafter connected five Cuban lines, five

Soviet lines, three Czech lines, two Polish lines, and one Yugoslav

line.

At the listening post, a live monitor made short summaries of

conversations of interest which were then included in a daily resume

for the Chief of Station. Later, when a reel was completely recorded,

full transcripts were typed and passed to the Station; however, there

was usually a time lag of a day or two. Reels which contained Russian

for translation and typing. Mr. Boris Tarasoff did the Russian transla-

tions but because of the volume of Russian conversations, the translations

usually ran about a week behind the date of the conversation.

As soon as the Station learned that an American identifying him-

self as Lee Oswald phoned the Soviet Embassy, Miss Ann Goodpasture of the

Station started screening all photographs. However, here agaig,

Background on Mexico Station Support Assets

(Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Enbassies)

1. Unilateral coverage. From the time the Mexico Station vas opened in

April 1947 (by Bill Doyle) until arrival of Win Scott as COS in 1956, Charles

Anderson III (still in LA/HQ) had developed a support apparatus to tales

exoloit leads fron the Soviet Embassy. This umbrella type project (LIFEAT)

consisted of milti line phone taps, three photo sites, a mobile surveillance

team and a mail intercept operation.

a.

Thone taps were placed by an employee of the telephone compan

stirad he tient tai

who vas handled by David WILSTED (pseudo). The nunber of lines

tapped was linked by availability of a listeniog post wearby.

(since the taps were not made in the main-centra

and English/

Spanish (Soviet, Polish, Czech, etc) transcribers. Generally

these agents (mostle

4g aNor Mexican American) were related

(which the

on as that time felt was good security in that

if they

tatked about shop, they would talk to each other.)

b. Three photo sites were handled by Anderson with the help

of Harry Kahoney (retired, living in Chicago) and TDY TSD

people checking the best type of carera, film, and concealment

devices, These had sub-cripts under LIFEAT (LIMITED, LILYRIG,

and LICALLA) • LIMITED was a fixed site bang opposite across

the street fron the front gate of the Soviet Enbassy which had

both a vehicle and foot entrance. The Soviet gate was on the

Northlest corner of their compound and LIITED was diagonally

across a double barrelled street on the Southaast

strictly on an

ex erinental basis in the early stages. I trink the llexi Station bought

one storey

this property (a/Spanish Colorial stone house) through LINOUSIE (check to

be sure. Later this house began to fall apart. This

base was closed when

the Station got word that the photo of "uniden nan"

was

being released

to the

public by

the Warren Connission. The photo operators

were moved to another apt

nearby. The property vas sold (under an operational agreement with LIMOUSINE

for a long term lease on the top floor of a new apartment blding to be built.

on this site). LILYRIC was planned as an alternate photo base to LIMITED.

It was in an upper storey (3rd floor-check) on the sare side of the street

as LIITED but in the middle of the block South. It had a slanted view of

the front gate of the Soviet Erbassy. The agents in LIMITED and LILYRIC (both

Vexican fazilies) as far as we knew, were not acquainted with each other.

LILYRIC as a rented apartment. LICALLA, the third photos

site,

was located

in one of a row of four houses on the South sidelor the Soviet Irbassy compound

which the Mexico Station purchased mana

about 195$ (check date), also using

LIOUS IT as the jurenage loreck)

"This site overlooked the back garden of

the Soviet Embassy cospound. The purpose of this operation was to get good

identification photographs of the Soviet personnel (uno at thet time were largely

unidentified in Mexico Station records). The three photo sites were handled by

Ramon Alvarez (Mexican citizen of U.S: mother who taught elerentary level at

the American School). Ramon collected the film eati

sim from LITTED

and LILYRIC three tines a week. His sister's husband, Carlos (¡lexican doctor)

developed and printed the film into 8x10 contact print strips. The master plan

tuit

was for LICALLA film to ie processed inside TSD man from 1957 to 1959 (Harper

Holt - resigned) could not handle the volume and as the unprocessed filn began

to accumulate, the inside Co. (l'ahoney) became disgusted and took the filn out

for Ramon's brother-in-law to process (probatly early 1959). Thus Ramon became

the handler for all three photo bases.

This team consisted of a half

dozen or so agents who used three to for late model cars ana a

The plan was to activate this group by radio (from LIMITED BASE)

stay with them

SASE cecause they had LL ITAD photos for identification purposes.

This worked fairly well until about the middle of 1958

was arrested by the ilexican transit polton and tured over to the

Mexican Secret Service.

2. LIaison coverage was unreliable and insecure as characterized by the nature

of the lexican services at that time. The Mexican DES (Direction of Federal

Security) with which ve dealt was a hip pocket group run out of the isnistry

Of Gov rnment. This linistry spent a major part of its time on control of

foreigners and political investigations. Their agents vere vicious, venal,

corrupt extortionists. Robert Melberg established

Mexican President elect, Adolfo Lopez lateos.

During this period, the J.S.

Ambassador Robert C. Hill (reflecting the policy of then Sec State J.F. Duiles)

was energetic in organizing groups to "fight cormunisn".

One of these seeds

grew into

a proposal Miguel Aleman (ir. son of forner lexi President), acting

for Losez lateos, made to Win Scott for a joint telephone tap operation. This

The Mexican in control (LIELEGANT) was inexperienced, old, and greedy. His

son (LIE:VOY-2) was a masterpiece of deceit and corruption. LIELEGANT also

manipulated control over the principal agent or LIBIGHT mail intercept. The

personal proölems associated with being outside the station so that the Mexicans

were virtually uncontrolla le, spendi € money as they pleased, squirrelling away

equipment at enormous costs, and neglecting their pert uf the bargain in the

production of transcripts or placing taps which

wanted. Spera was replaced

by Jack Brady who found himself in the same pincer movement of having Scott

approve a request by LIELEGANT that Brady had turned

down by the son, LIE:vOr-?.

Finally when the cost became exhorbitant and there was little to show for it,

the project was revamped. Smith and John returned to the U.S. and wera replaced

Brady was reassigned to other duties rendirg a transfer.

He designated Ann Goodpasture to meet dailing with Flick for routine supervision

of the listening post, picking up transcripts and teres.

Goodpasture had no

dealings with the isxicans except, when seott was ill or out of town. Generally,

all decisions were nade bytecolty This was about late 1961.-

3. Vy menory is a little vague about the origins of the Cuban Enbassy but I

think the staff first developed fron a pro-Castro group celebrating on New

Years eve 1959. As I recall, it was a rakeshift arrangement of volunteers

through most of 1960 and Cl with Tom Hazlitt producing voluminous reports on

their activities and recruitirg agents right and left anong Cuban nationals in

Mexico City.

4. Personnel assignments. Of interest to us now is who was in lexico during

the period prior to Oswald's visit and the subsequent investigation by the

Warren Connission. To determine wro was there and what they were doing I

have gro:ped persons together chronologically with areas of their assignment

as the

covcring from 1950 to 1969 so that iootines nanes gop up, one can tell what

2 Polish, and 1 lugoslav line. The baserouse listening

post had a live

nonitor who made short sunnaries of interesting conversations for a caily

resume which was received each day arourd 8 a.". (passed by Flick to Goodcasture

to get to Scott before 9.a.n.) Later (when the

reel was

completely recorded)

full transcripts were typed and passed to the station in the same way, however,

there was usually a time lag of a day or so. Those transcripts which had

Russian or another language besides Spanish or English went

out of the listening

post the day after the transcript (of other conversations.od the reel)was

typed. These reels were taken to another location where

they

were translated

and typed. In the case of the Russian translations;

Boris Tarasoff usually ran

ebout a week bahind the date a geration because of the volies of

Russian conversations ang

De-hembers of the Soviet Erbassy. During this

period (fall of 1963) the reels were probably being brought into the station

and carried to Boris by one of the people from the Soviet Section or they nay

have been carried to him by Flick but I think I brought the reel in and gave

it to Herbert Manell to take to Boris. Herbert lanell and his wife Barbara

handled all of the processi g of Soviet transcripts. ly job involved screening

the photographs as soon as we learned that the man calling hinself. Oswald was

probably an Avierican. However, here again there was a backlag because the

photos were picked up three tines a week but the ones ricked up were usually

for dates a few days previously because the doctor processed the film on a

night time basis. Fhotographs were made usually until one roll vas used but

later ve got it changed to one day coverage on each roll - in other words the

error did occur but generally the agents were conscientious.

The Cuban

embassy coverage had more sophisticated equipient (a pulse ca:era) but it

frequently develored rechanical difficulties. Bob Zambarnerdi and Spathar

(I think) handled this film - pick up and delivery. Lorne l'ackay screeted

the film inside the station.

I am certain that the Oswald call came to our attention fron the

Soviet line. It was picked u; and taken to Boris for a translation because

the caller was trying to speak Russian. Any delay was caused by waiting to

compare the photographs with the typed transcript. There were no copies of

transcripts every made in languages other than Spanish or

27 September 1903, Soviet Embassy Chancery 15-01-55

Item 295, page 3

At 1626 hours, A Soviet calls from the Soviet Embassy Chancery

to the Cuban Consulate and asks for Sylvia DURAN.

DURAN if the american has been there.

the letters that he showed them from the (Soviet)

in Washington, he wants to go to the USSR to stay

a long time with his wife who is Russian, but also the

answer had not been received (by him) regarding his problem.

that accordingly these transactions take 4 or 5 months bui

without prior approval from the USSR, they have to request

and even then, they could not issue the visa here. (in Mexico

City) without asking Washington.

Yet accordingly

(the American),

King howed hit a letter is whach he" (the man

American) is a member of an organization in favor of Cuba

and said that the Cubans could not give him the visa without

the Russian visa and now the Soviet doesn't know what to do

with him, because he has ta wam

Washington.

also, because

the problem with him (the American)

is that he doesn't

wanyone in Cuba and in that case it

is very diffia

to, give him a visa,

thinking of p?

cessing his visa, because he knew it was

going to take along time waiting for the Russian visa

SOVIET:

Cuba, and then go on to the USSR.

..that the thing is that if his (the American) wife were

now in Washington (and) going to receive the visa right now

or the permission from the USSR to return to her country, (If)

she is going to receive her visa in Washington, then having

this visa, she can communicate to whatever place, this

permission,

for example, here or in any other place (he) can

DURAN:

receive it,

but right now they do not have them.

and neither can (the Cubans) give him a letter

because they do not know if the visa will be approved.

SOVIET:

DURAN:

SOVIET:

They can only give the visa according to instzuctions.

Then that is what she will put on his application.

can I give him any letter of recommendation because

I don't know him and

for bothering you.

DURAN: It was no bother, thank you very much.

27 September 1963, Soviet Embassy Consulate 15-60-55

Item 74, page 2

An unidentified man (speaking Spanish) calls the Soviet Embassy

Consulate at 1037 hours and asks

for the Consul.

He is told that

the Consul is not there.

The unidentified man asked what is needed

to get visas to go to Odessa. He is told to call back at 1130 hours.

Item 137, page 2

At 1235 hours a man named ALATRISTE (not a Soviet) from inside the

Soviet Embassy Consulate

calls out to number 45-37-72 (Colonial

America, probably a pension or hotel but number not listed in the

telephone directory) and speaks with a man named SAN ROMAN.

ALATRISTE says that he is in the Russian Embassy and they need to

know what day the boat "KALONIA" will arrive in Odessa, that the

Soviets will also need copies of the passenger manifest.

(One concludes that ALATRISTE and SAN ROMAN are shipping representatives

for the boat "KALONIA", and needed routine visa information, First

a call was made to the first listing for the Soviet Embassy in the

Mexican telephone directory (which turned out to be the Military Attache) .

They got the phone number for the Consulate and the address.

making a call to the Consulate and learning that it would not be open

until 1130 hours, ALATRISTE went to theraddress to get the needed

information.)

• Item 395, pages 7 and 8

Just after 1600 hours,

the Soviet Consulate received a call from the

Cuban Consulate (Sylvia DURAN) who said she had

there a U.S. citizen

who had requested a transit visa to Cuba because he is going to the

USSR. DURAN wants to know with whom he spoke at the

Soviet Embassy

because she sent him over to them telling him that if the Soviets

approved the visa then the Cubans would

give him one without anything

more, advising the (Department of) Immigration in Cuba. She wants

to know with whom he spoke because he says that he doesn't know

either with what person and who told him

that certainly there would

be no problem.

The Soviet asks DURAN to wait a minute.

After a

short wait DURAN explains the same thing to another Soviet.

This

Soviet tells her to leave her telephone

(number) and her name and

someone will return the call.

DURAN

gives her nane and telephone

number 11-28-47 then says as a personal thing,

she has moved and

has not advised them of a change of address

so will not receive their

Bulletin and can give it to them now.

The Soviet asks her to call

KOUKHARENKO in order to change that address and asks for the name

of the (Cuban) Cultural Attache.

DURAN says it is Teresa PROENZA

whose number is 14-13-26.

The Soviet thanks her.

SILVIA DURAN, ONE IMPORTANT QUESTION STILL PUZZLES US:

WHEN LEE

OSWALD WAS IN MEXICO CITY IN LATE SEPTEMBER AN EARLY OCTOBER TO

GET A SOVIET VISA AND A CUBAM TRI

INSUL VISA, DID HE WANT TO TRAVEL

TO CUBA RIGHT AWAY, ALONE, OR HAVE HIS WIFE JOIN HIM THERE AND

THEN LEAVE FOR CUBA, OR DID HE PLAN TO RETURN TO THE STATES FIRST

AND THEN LEAVE LATER: ALTHOUGH IT APPEARS THAT HE WAS THEN THINKING

ONLY ABOUT A PEACEFUL CHANGE OF RESIDENCE TO THE SOVIET UNION,

IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT HE WAS GETTING DOCUMENTED TO MAKE A QUICK

ESCAPE AFTER ASSASSINATING THE PRESIDENT.

20 PLIASE RESTUDY YOUR LIENVOY MATERIAL AND. GIVE US YOUR OPINION,

AND ALSO HAVE MEXICANS QUESTION SILVIA DURAN VERY CAREFULLY ON

THIS POINT. ADVISE.

Action Required: Please advise re negatives

In view of recent reopening of the publicity regarding

Lee Harvey OSWALD and WOFACT evidence, Headquarters would

like to determine whether the Station

still has on hand

the negatives from which the prints available at Headquarters

were made of the unidentified "mystery man" coming out of

both the Soviet and Cuban Embassies.

If they are still

on file, it is requested that they remain so, and that they

be forwarded Headquarters for retention rather than

destroyed if the latter action is ever contemplated.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr I, Lee Rankin

SUBJECT:

Information in CIA's Possession

Regarding Lee Harvey OSWALD

Prior to November 22, 1963

167;

This refers to your letter of February 12, 1964

addressed to the Director of Central Intelligence which has

been passed to me for reply.

Paragraph three of your letter requested the Agency

to supply the Commission with a report on information in the

Agency's possession regarding Lee Harvey OSWALD prior to

November 22, 1963. The request was predicated upon the

footnote on page two of CIA's report to the Commission dated

31 January 1964, entitled: "Information Developed by CIA on

the Activity of Lee Harvey OSWALD in Mexico City, 28 Sep-

tember - 3 October 1963".

3.

There is attached an exact reproduction of the

Agency's official dossier on Lee Harvey OSWALD beginning

with the opening sheet dated 9 December 1960. The entire

dossier carries the security classification of Secret and

consists of thirty documents arranged in chronological order.

On the basis of clearances from the Federal Bureau of

Investigation, the Department of State, the Department of

Nary, and the Immigration and Naturalization Service, who

were queried by us after the receipt of your letter, we are

able to make available exact copies, of all materials in the

file up to early October 1963.

DEPARTMENT OF STATE

THE DIRECTOR OF INTELLIGENCE AND RESEARCH

WASHINGTON

SECRET

OCT 25 1960

Dear Dick:

Our efforts to answer recent informal inquiries, including some

from the White House

Staff, have revealed that,

though CIA and the

FET have detailed records concerning Americans who have been recruited

as Intelligence agents by Bloc

countries,

there does not appear to be

a complete listing of those Americans now living in Bloc countries

who might be called "defectors".

Using the definitions of DODD 4/2,

these persons might be described as those who have either been

capable of providing useful intelligence to the Bloc or those whose

desire to resettle in Bloc countries has been significantly exploited

for communist propaganda purposes.

This would mean that no attention

need be paid to Americans whose resettlement within the Bloc had no

counter-intelligence implications or had attracted no particular

attention; for instance, this definition would not cover individual

US citizens of East European or Chinese origin who returned to the

"homeland" because they had never been completely assimilated into

the American society.

There is attached a list of such persons, covering the last 18

months, and it would be appreciated if the Agency could verify and

possibly expand this list for the use of interested Bureaus of, the

Department.

Sincerely yours,

Hugh S. Cunning, Jr.

Vladimirovich KOSTIKOV, born in Moscow, 17 March 1933.

A photograpa of KOSTIKOV is attached. In his lettor of

matters. There is firm evidenco for the conciusion that KOSTIKOV

is = Soviet Stato Security (KG) cilicer, and the other fou Consular

aficers aro aloo known or strongly duspected to be Soviet Stat

Security personnel serving under official cover. The State Security

Service is the major ci the Sovia intelligence sorvices ard it is

cisarged with espiodage, counteristelligence and related matiera

instio the Soviet Union and overseas.

I must bo clearly stated that Soviet intelligence and

security officers placed abroad undcr official cover normally

are required to periorm the routine and legitimate business

demanded by the cover job in an embassy or consulato.

16. KOSIIKOV was fist spoïed as a ¡GB man because

di his travels around Mexico, his habitual association with known

KGB aficers, and because consuls, in Soviet practice, are

usually KGB mes.

17. KOSTIKOV is believed io work for Department Thirteen

of the First Chief Directorate of the KGS. It is the Department

responsible for executive action, including sabotage and assassi-

pation. These functions of the IGB are known within the Service

Talephone Coaversation oetween Mr. O'Neal and Mr. Papich at 0915, 27 November 1963

Mr. Papich:

On questions A, B, O, D- he u9s aôt questicaed on aay of those.

he have been told the police didny sad he flaally dot access to him

and alta the tame sloa lo up to ther le questioned way the assassination

one sue, disad, ent one were core overed,.

We weren't given

authority to nove an uatil eiday so saose questions vere not covered.

With regard to E - Mrs, Paine, etc., we are working on that.

I - we have some information for you on that indicating communication

between him and the Embassy up there.

The wife is being interrogated. I don't know it that took place yesteras

or is still going on. You are getting a teletype answer on that. I am

just giving you a preview.

"awes"

With regard to that, vicaraguan's; allegations that the man was in the

Cuban Embassy on 18 Septenber, I understand we do have information that

he applied for a tourist card about the 15th of Segtenker. There 1s a

record showing entry into Mexico on September 26. On about the 15th be

applied In New Orleans for a tourist cafd.

We do know he was in -

I may even have some later infor

nation

which came in during the nigat -

As you kaow, he was in them alean:

Zith when the family left.

; He was seen on the

2500

and the landlady said be skipped during the night.

He was last seen by the landlady

then.

Now we have immigration records showing bim

entering Mexico on the 26th which very strongly suggests that be was not in Mexico

on the l8th. What we are trying to find out is where he was every single day -

the 25th, 24th, and all the way bac's.

I think the Nicaraguan story is fabricated
