COMMISSION ON CIA ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE UNITED STATES

Woshington, DC 20500 ‘
April 15, 1975 ‘
MEMORANDUM .
TO : The File
FROM : David W. Belin .

SUBJECT : Interview with Secretary Robert McNamara

Belin: Secretary McNamara, we've had a brief interview

in your office on - late this afternoon - which
is April 15, 1975, and I have asked you a number of questions
and you have given me your best recollection for your answers,
and I'd like to get a summary of our discussion on this tape
and then send you a transcript for your editing, and then we
will either prepare an affidavit or perhaps we will still ask
you to come before the Commission, but I understand it is your
preference not to testify formally before the Commission,
because of the nature of your present job. Is that correct?

McNamara: That is correct. I wish to cooperate with the
Commission in every way. If necessary, of course,

I would testify before them, but I would much prefer to presen

whatever information I have in the form of an affidavit.

B: Fine. During the Administration of President
Kennedy, you were Secretary of Defense. Is that

correct?

M: That is correct.

B: __ And were you Secretary of Defense commencing at the

time of the inauguration of President Kennedy?

M: Yes. Starting January 20, 1961.

B: And you were Secretary of Defense throughout the
Kennedy Administration. Is that right?

M: I was.

B: --and into the Administration of Lyndon Johnson.

M: until approximately March 1, 1968.

Bs During that time you were personally close with both

the President and his brother, Robert Kennedy, is .
that correct?

M: I was. Zo)

B: And you also were close to McGeorge Bundy?

M: Yes.

As I understand it there was what I am going
to call a “camaderie" in the relationship among
some of the top people in the Kennedy: Administration.

M: Yes. That is correct.

B: At any time during the Kennedy Administration did

you hear any person ever discuss a plan known as
an “executive action plan" which in substance was defined
as a capability plan for possibly assassinating any foreign
leader?

ever
M: I have no recollection of/hearing anyone discuss
such a plan.
B: Did you ever hear anyone discuss any particular

plan concerning the possible assassination of
Castro in Cuba?

M: No. I have no recollection of such a discussion.
B: Did you ever serve in any group known as either
the MONGOOSE group or the Special Group Augmented?
Does that ring a bell with you?

M: No. You mentioned, if I may refer back to our f
previous conversation, that I was present atleast

one or more meetings of the Special Operations Group, I believ

you called it. I have no recollection of being present at
the meeting. I'm not suggesting I wasn't, but I have no

recollection of it. I do seem to recall that there was such

a group, I doubt very much if I was a’member of it.

B: You might have been a participant at one or more
of these meetings?

M: I might have been a participant.
B: At any such meetings, did you ever hear anyone

discuss as a possibility the question of possibly
assassinating Castro or any other foreign leader?

M: _No. I should interject here another point I made
earlier, as I have no notes -- ‘I did not take notes of
any meetings I attended with rare exceptions, and I have

years is very bad. I'm not saying this to in any way qualify
what I am saying except that it is a fact that my memory is
poor in relation to the period.

B: I asked you whether or not Robert Kennedy ever had
any such discussions with you and you indicated no,
is that correct?

i --indicated two things. First that I have no re-
collection whatsoever of him ever having discussed
assassination of anybody with Me~-or whatever you called it--
the executive --

B: executive action capability --

M: executive action Capability. Moreover, it is in-

conceivable to me that he would have discussed
such an action with me because I think he would have felt
that it endangered the Presidency and I believe he would
have had moral reasons for not supporting any such action
by the Government of the United States, end I base both of
those points on my appraisal of his evaluation of the Bay of
Pigs and the extent to which it weakened the presidency and
the ability of the President to govern and his behavior
during the Cuban missile crisis when he strongly opposed
action which he considered contrary to the moral traditions
of this society.

B: Do you have any other comments with regard to this
whole question of possibly assassinating foreign
leaders?

M: You told me that you understand a plan to assassinate

: one or more foreign leaders was in existence for
an extended period of time, during 1961-2-3. I said (a) I
have no recollection of any such plan, (b) I find it very
difficult to believe that if such a plan had existed its
existence wouldn't have been known to the'top officials of

the CIA, and certainly if I had known of it I am positive I
would have made my knowledge known to the President ,4Robert
Kennedy, neither of whom obviously can testify now, But to

Mac Bundy, to my deputy, Ros Gilpatric, and probably to

Dean Rusk, and I would strongly urge that you check those
three individuals. In addition, Max Taylor was very close

to Robert Kennedy at the time. He was brought in by President

Kennedy to examine the decision-making process of the Government

problem of Cuban relations. He played a major part in the
Cuban missile crisis discussions because of his association
with the Kennedys and his work with the Bay of Pigs follow-on.
So I would urge you to talk to him about this as well. And
if Mac didn't know about it, and Max doesn't know about it
and Dean Rusk doesn't and Ros ilpatrick doesn't and I have
no memory of it, I very much doubt that any such plan was
known to the top officials of the Kennedy Administration.

B: Well, assume for the moment that one of those people

did know about such a plan, and assume for the
moment that the CIA documents show that such a plan might
have been directed to be instituted by someone in the White
House, Who in the White House do you:think would have had
the authority to institute such a plan?

M: Well, I have said before that I felt the attacks

on the CIA -- CIA's covert operations, were unjustified
insofar as they assessed the primary responsibilities for
those operations against the senior officials in CIA and
absolve the rest of the senior officials in the Government
of responsibility. I said that because it was my experience
that all major CIA operations were approved by a group that
subsequently became known as the 303 Group. I don't know
what it was called during its early period, wirreh',included
representatives of the -- the highest level representatives --
of the Secretaries of State and Defense, as well as the
President's Security Adviser.

B: That was Mr. Bundy.

M: That was Mr. Bundy, during the period you are

talking about, se—that I am almost certain that
were an assassination contemplated, which seems to me, ps I sal
extremely unlikely, if it were contemplated or any action beeng’
taken to move in that direction, it would have had to have
received the approval of not just Mr. Bundy but other .
officials at that same level, including my Deputy, I think, and
Deputy never would! have approved anything like that without
discussing it with me.

B: What you are saying--at least if it came through
the White HOuse, certainly Mr. Bundy would have
known about it.

M: I think he would have both known about it, and I
don't believe that he would have approved it.by

himself. I think it would have been discussed with Dean

Rusk and me or my deputy and Dean Rusk's undersecretary.

M: That's a fair statement but I think that's extremely

to the CIA operation of this kind would be known to the

President and not Mr. Bundy. I never knew of any such thing.
