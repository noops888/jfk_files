FOR YOUR INFORMATION
REFERENCE: NMA 3798, dated 2S March 1967

i, When Wallace A, GSOVERY met with AMBIDDY/1 on 13 January
1967 to formally terminate the AMWORLD operation, AMBIDDY/1
discussed in detail reference dependents who had been ‘receiving

» financial assistance from ANMFCRLD funds and requested that
GROWERY explore the possibility of WOFACT financial aesistance
following termination of their AMWORLD monthly support payments.
An tavestigation was ‘conducted by both ‘JMWAVE and Headquarters to
determine if the agents named dy AMBIDDY/1 had been employed by
WOFACT.1n order to determine what, if any, obligation might
exist to provide financtal assistance to the dependents. The
results of the combined Headquarters investigation, keyed to
reference dependents, are summarized below for Station Managua

ififormation.

(IDEN-A). Subjoct was a SOFACT agent undor éGontract. His
MOC provided paysent. of his $400 monthly salary to.
his dependent pareats for two years following pos-
sible death while engaged on a WOFACT mission.
After Subject's execution in 1962 the parents received
his regular monthly salary until 28 June 1963. At
that time Headquarters decided to liquidate the
remaining balance of $6400-and Paid this amount in a
lump sum to the parents, Headquarters considers that
all legal and xerai obligations have been discharged
and is not ‘inclined to assume’ any further financial
obligations to the parents. AMBIDDY/1 is apparently
unaware that the parents have received approxinately

$10,000 from WoFACT.

the Subject was originally brought to ZABOTII's attention. If
AMBIDDY/1 was the nource of ZAROTH's Anformation 1t 1s noteworthy

and never: the amount of dependents was taking in considera=
tion. There is only ong case receiving a higher amount,
Mrs. Hilda R. Carballo (widow of Jesus Delgado), -who. receives
$250.00 becanna wa were specially instructed to pay thig a=

|| MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Wi/Cuba

SUBJECT : Recommendations Concerning Payments to

Dependents of. Brigade Members

- 1. A review of the existing files fails to-reveal at

any evidence of. a clear-cut policy concerning ‘the. duration
- Of payments to dependents of Brigade members killed,
captured or missing in action despite the many recommenda-
tions made at various times to resolve this problem. This
lack of policy is implicit in a memorandum from Mr. Helms

to the DDCI dated: 23 May 1962 in’ which ‘he referred to a
Presidential. oral directive that ‘payments to dependents

were to be continued until termination by Presidential H
order. A later meriorandum from Mr. Helms to the DDCI, dated
31 December 196%, contained. recommendations for terminating
..these rionthly payments with a lump-sum d .
be'made. to, dependents of those killéd.or missing: in action.
Both memoranda are.attached for-your ‘review...A memrandim
from Mr. Sterling Cottrell to the attorney General, dated
1. February 1963, concerning various agreements: reached
between Brigade. leaders, AUBUD and the Agency, also included
three possible alternatives for resolving the problem of.
dependency payments-as follow: :

, A, Follow regulations established..by.the Bureau:
of Employment Compensation, .i.é. $1,000 “lump ‘sum payment
for loss of life. cee 2 i ee

: B. Follow U.S, Army practice, i.e. monthly
Payments of $122 or more (depending on rank and length
of service) for as long as the widow survives and does
not re-marry. This, Mr. Cottrell pointed out, would be a
costly program to administer and would cost roughly $200,000
a year for an indefinite period. (This ‘has proven to be
true).

at. large after being deluged with roams of Cuban postmortems,

4. The review and recommendations forwarded by JMWAVE
are comprehensive. and appear to be more than generous in
the approach toward.a two-stage cut-off of payments. I.
do believe. the ‘recommendations to. immediately-cease any.

involved in such a step. This may -also.apply to any
attempt to remove existing funds from trustees who are con-

sidered to be unreliable or even dishonest in the administra-

tion of funds-under this control, These trustees were

specifically designated by Brigade members and the written
authorization to.support such trusteeships are in the .

custody of AMTIKI. It would seem that no one but the -

principal himself or his heirs has the legal right to .
revoke a. trustceship-cven in the mishandling of funds.
Based on a-review of pertinent documents and a discussion
with Mrs, Evie-Vidal,.who is probably more knowledgeable
of the facts and nuances of -this problem than anyono else,
Ihave listed. bolow:some _reechnendst sone for ‘your con=

A. In line with. recent: JMWAVE recommendations,

: payments to all principal dependents -(wives. who have not

remarried) be reduced by 30 July, or as. s00n as feasible,

to a flat $100 per month and all minor dependents reduced

to. $25 per month with notification. that all payments will
coayo 6 months from date of initial reductfon, All secundary
dependents,. such as dependent. parents who receive separate
checks of not more than $50 por month, should be continuod
at the present rate until ‘the final termination date for

all dependents.

— B. Such adjustments as recommended above should
bo uniform and across the board with no attenipt- to
evaluate each case on an Andividual ‘basis determined by -
such factors as outside income; need, etc. This would

not only tend to-create an undesirable socurity hazard but
would complicate the phasing out of an already complicated
situation. Furthermore, individuals who -have made. an
effort to raise their standard of living by augmentation
of their fneome would be justified in feeling they wore
penalized for having more ambition than some of the lazy
pensioner types. - Once we attempt. to play the role of.
Solomon as.to who is the most worthy or the. most needy,

we lose sight of the fact that all” dependents are equal

as widows whose husbands died for the same cause and we
could expect: no ‘end of recriminations.. ‘Neither should
there be any distinction as is recommended in some instances
by JMWAVE that payments: should cease because. dependents
happen to réside in Cuba. -They are ‘as entitled to the
sane benefits, as those fortunate enough to reside in this
country. The exception to. this may. be justified in those.
isolated cases.where it is evident that nothing has been”
heard- from such dependents and they have never received
any. benefits from the money paid for their support. In
these instances payments to trustees should probably be
terminated immediately if such action is legal.

Cc. In the case of the known prisoners, two
courses of action could be pursued. Either cut the present
dependency payments in line with that proposed for dependents



mend net saree acts

of deceased with. the understanding such payments will ‘con-
tinue until the status of each man is-resulved (either. by
rel¢ase or death while. fa. prison) -or leave'.tho present

amount ‘being paid unchanged with Andefinite continuation.
ved. a6 caecordi ng: £o ithe IMWAVE. 7

the ldves ofthe prisoners.
to

Furthermore. the: momordndum mM Cottrel the
Attorney Geheral referred to in paragraph.l. included ‘as
part of the general agreoment? reachéd with ‘Brigade leaders
aasurance that payments to dependents of Brigade members
remaining in prison would be continued. Ono caso that
falls.in this catogory is extremely interesting. It
concerns case: #13 who is. imprisoned under an alias and in
order to insure his safcty there seems to be a tacit agree-
ment to treat him-as dead. - It may be quite a-feat to

" avoid a. charge’ of discrimination. against his wife if her

payments are terminated. "as a widow" in ordor to iB iditatee
the - eaeeeneee cover to preserve his sazot.

D. . Prior to submitting reco ida fiona to the:
303 Committee for phasing out dependency ‘paymonts, a ruling
on all the logal and. possible. security aspects of any
Proposal should probably be obtained from the General Counsel.

8. I have not explored in depth the background of
the benefits presently boing .paid t6-"tho dependents, of
Heroes/Martyrs, the. majority. of which do not appear ‘to
have. boon Brigade’ members and do not come..uhdér: the same
criteria established for Brigadé members.~. In. the event
you aro contompl: ng, terminating. this: type of payments;
such action could no doubt, be, defended as not “bein,
plicable to the conditions governing dependents of Brigade
members, It has been my understanding that your proposal
to submit a memorandum to the 303 Committee in ‘the immediate
futuro concerns ‘only recommendations -for: resolving the
Brigadé dépendency payments.. If I am incorrect and such
memorandum is to also cover the continued ‘payments to
Meroes/Martyrs dependents, - ~please advise me as to what you
wish done. i
