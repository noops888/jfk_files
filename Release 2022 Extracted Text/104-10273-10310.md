circa 8 June 1976 a Guatemalan source, with the knowledge of.
Guatemalan President LAUGERUD, provided the Guatemala Station)

NOTE: The Gi
information the Ch

Ta Station) also included
"of Station) had received
from” _ on 8 Junc.* said that he

had pcen providing information on ZIMERI to the
Guatemalan government for the past six months or
so. He claimed that two Americans were involved
with ZIMERI, one of them who runs a guard service
in Miami. _. did not mention names but
described one of the Americans as about six feet
four inches and weighing about 230 pounds.

4, The Guatemalan report of the assassination plot ends
with five requests for information by President LAUGERUD:

a. Is ZIMERI still in the United States?

b. In the event ZIMERI is not in the United
States legally, deport him to Guatemala

Is ZINERI recruiting merceraries in the
United States for possible use in
Guatemala?

d. Does ZIMERI receive any kind of prefer
tial treatment by U. S. authorities which
permit him to carry firearms, as well as
to purchase arms and ammunition for
shipment to Guatemala?

e. Any information on Robert and Gerald
HENMI'NG?

5.. On 19 June 1976 E advised
that DDO is referring the entire matter to the FBI and State
Department.

6. Office of Security indices aré negative in pertinent
variations of the name of ZIMERI or Robert HENMING.

7. From the name, physical description, activity, and
alleged employment, it is apparent that Gerald Patrick HEMMING
is identical with the subject of Office of Security file
429 229, who has been described as. six-foot five, 250 pounds,
who is a notorious mercenary and soldier of fortune and who as
of May 1975 was ostensibly employed by a private investigation
any, TEPCOL Security (Office of Security--no record) in
Miami, Florida.



8, Gerald Patrick IIEMMING is well known to this Agency
the Office of Security Miami Field Office, and JMWAVE, On
Mine ives oecasious since at das the early 1960's, aA
had claimed Agency affiliation when in fact there has beea
none. The most recent incident wherein HENMING claimed s
affiliation was in May 1975 when he volunteered his servic
to the Drug Enforcement Administration, Gerald Patrick HUMMINC
is a long-time cohort of Frank Anthony STURGIS (SF#353 459),
ak: Frank FIORINI, of Watergate notoriety who also has a
long-time record of falscly claiming Agency affiliation. In
the late 1950's HENMING and STURGIS, both former U.S. Marines,
joined Fidel CASTRO in Cuba but returned shortly thereafter
Claiming disillusionment with the CASTRO cause. Soon th:
STURGIS organized a group of mercenaries for Caribbean and
Central American activities which he named the International
Anti-Conmunist Brigade. A reported sub-unit of this "Brigade"
(the backers of whom have never been fully established)

named the Intercontinental Penetration Force, headed by Gerald
Patrick HEMMING.

h

after,

9, For an appreciation of the possible ramifications of
a Guatemalan government expose of this assassination plot
involving HEHMING, you are referred to attachments to instant
memorandum, to wit: a memorandum by the writer dated 10 Jun»
1975 in the name of Frank STURGIS and Everett Howard HUNT, .J
and an extract from a book published in early 1976 written b:
Michael CANFIELD and Alan J. WEBERMAN. The book Coup d'e
in America--The CIA and the Assassination of John’ F, Ke
is a diatribe against the Agency and attempts to link the A y
with the assassination of President KENNEDY, One of the major
links attempted by the authors is through Everett Howard HUNT,
Jr. to Frank STURGIS to Gerald Patrick HEMMING to Loran Eugene
HALL. Loran Eugene HALL was a member of HEMMING's Interconti-
nental Penetration Force. Loran Eugene HALL received nationwide
publicity in 1967 when New Orleans District Attorney "Jim"
GARRISON alleged that HALL (and the Intercontinental Penetration
Force) was involved in the assassination of President KENNEDY
and that, members of this unit were connected with CIA, GARRISON
shortly thereafter dropped his interest in HALL, but it is
interesting that he did so after Gerald Patrick HEMMING and
another cohort, Robert K. BROWN, joined GARRISCN's investigation.
