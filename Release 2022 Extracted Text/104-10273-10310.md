The Guatemalan report of the assassination plot ends

with five requests for information by President LAUGERUD:

a. Is ZIMERI still in the United States?

b. In the event ZIMERI is not in the United

States legally, deport him to Guatemala.

c. Is ZINERI recruiting merceraries in the

United States for possible use in

Guatemala?

d.

Does ZIMERI receive any kind of preferen-

treatment by U. S. authorities which

permit him to carry

firearms,

jicasions sinc

claimed Agency affiliation when in fact there

ät last the carly lsóo bros been

The most recent incident wherein HEMMING claimed such

affiliation was in May 1975 when he volunteered his servies

to the Drug

Enforcement Administration.

Gerald Patrick MEMMINC

is a long-time cohort of Frank Anthony STURGIS (SF#353 459),

Frank FIORINI, of Watergate notoriety who also has ^

long-time record of

falsely claiming Agency affiliation.

the late 1950's HEMMING and STURGIS,

both former UoS. Maries,

joined Fidel CASTRO in Cuba but returned shortly thereafto:

claiming disillusionnent with the CASTRO cause.

Soon thercafter,

STURGIS organized a

group of mercenaries

for Caribbean and

Central American

activities which he named the International

Anti-Conmunist Brigade.

A reported sub-unit of this

"Brigade"

(the backers of whom have never been fully established) was

Intercontinental Penetration Force, headed by Gerald

Patrick HEMMING.

For an appreciation of the possible ramifications of

a Guatemalan

government expose of this assassination plot

involving HEMMING,

are referred to attachments to instant

memorandum, to wit:

a memorandum by the writer dated 10 Jun.

1975 in the

name of Frank

STURGIS and Everett Howard HUNT,

and an extract from a book

published in early 1976 writton by

Michael CANFIELD and Alan J. WEBERMAN.

The book Coup d'ciat

in America--The CIA and the Assassination of John F.

is a diatribe against the Agency and attempts to link the Mency

with the assassination of President KENNEDY.

One of the major

links attempted by the authors is through Everett Howard HUNT,

Jr. to Frank STURGIS to Gerald Patrick HEMMING to Loran Eugene

Loran Eugene HALL was a member of HEMMING's Interconti-

nental Penetration Force.

Loran Eugene HALL received nationwide

publicity in 1967 when New Orleans District Attorney "Jim"

GARRISON alleged that HALL (and the Intercontinental Penetration

Force) was involved in the assassination of President KENNEDY

and that members of this unit were connected with CIA.

GARRISON

shortly thereafter dropped his interest in HALL, but it is

interesting

so after Gerald Patrick

HEMMING and

another cohort, Robert K. BROWN, joined GARRISON's investigation.
