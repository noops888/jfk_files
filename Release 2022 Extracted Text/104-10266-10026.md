‘Retioa EQUiRED - REFERENCES

Action required: retire file, again.
References: A. UNDA 3502, 22 January 1968
B. UNDA 3650, 13 March 1968

1. During a meeting with LICOOKY/1 on 5 April 1968 agreement
was reached that the WOFIRM relationship with her would be terminated.
A memorandum of contact (NYM-2689) concerning the meeting is attached
herewith, and indicates the reasons for this termination. No admin-
istrative action is required of either the Base or Headquarters
En thie instance, 22 LIMO eas
was formally terminated once before (1966). Her file can be bid

. again, and this time presumably will be the last time.

2. Termination was very amicable, and LICOOKY/1 nolds no ill-
will for WOFIRM: she just does not wish to have any relationship
with WOFIRM anymore.

3. The writer fully expects to hear from LICOOKY/1 from time
to time by phone (in fact, she called later the same day of the
meeting to wish the writer a pleasant Easter, as she had forgotten
to do so during the meeting), but does not plan any further personal
contact.

SUBJECT: Meeting with LICOGKY/1, :
5 April 1968

1. A meeting with LICCOKY/1 was held at 2100 hours, Friday,
5 April 1968. We breaxZasted, and then heid eting at the
site. As is cetailed below, we reached a mutual
agreement that reiecionsnip was not worth pursuing; this was
thoroughly amicabie, and recontact methods are available on boch

sides.

2.0 Substantive matters first. LICOOKY/i said that John GeRAssl
Nad been “in come on 25 ior the Gay. He was inv .cea to lunch
at the CMUN that day, Sunday. Apparently, GERASSI, is back in te
good graces of the Cuban regime. He told LICOOXY/i that he woulé
be spending this Summer in Arizona.

3. LiCOOX¥/1 has been commissioned by %
xecent intellectua:/

6. I knew something was bothering LICOOXY/1 and made her ~ |
drag it out into the open. ; She stacted by remarking thac WOFIRN
ané. its computer apparently checked the welfare of its oid agents
. every £0 often, and that this was the nature of our relztionship.
oie 1 explained that this was not the case, that i had found ovt she /
<- was in Manhattan and suggested to Washington that LICCOXY/L "
might be of some velue to us. This surprised her, and she apolo= ; :
gized. She then took off on how when she was in Cuba3she had :
dealt with Fidel and Che and Celia, and@ when sie was invoived
with Guatemala she was dealing with AREVALO. She said that she ‘
didn't want to sound snobbish, but that she was accustomed to :
dealing with top politicos and intellectuals; she referrzd toa ~ :
statement that I had made previously that perhaps she could get
Tana de GAMEZ to invite her along to one of Yana's lunches with
Cuban Permanent Representative Ricardo ALARCON Quesada. She said
that she didn't want WOFIRM to think that she would seex out and
cultivate lower level people, chat she wasn't built that way. i
LICOOK/1 said that even though Tana was a friend and that she
daked ner, Tana was not ner ecuas, ana that vane wasn & ‘oA her t
“pedestal”. That ALARCON was certainiy not in LICOOKY/1's intellectual
category. LICOOKY/1 said that she considered herseli as very flexible,
7 but not that much. LICOOXY/1 is a “special person" and that
» * WOFIR% bureaucracy’-- with the exceptions of “Bill” (ner Mexico |
te case officer, a friend of the writer), C/wH/1 (with whom LICOOKY/1
4 is particularly taxen), and the writer (LICOOXY/1 repeatedly assured
me that she had < very sincere esteen for me) -- probably didn't ‘i
understand or acknowiedge this. LiCOCXY/1 said her feelings for
certain “OPIRMers were one thing, but her dislike of WOFIXM itself
+ was something else. WOFIRM is a massive card index that shows Miguel
Angel ASTURIAS as an old “Nicaraguan war-horse” -- ASTURIAS of
course is Guatemalax. LICOOKY/1 couidn‘'t stop liking Communists
regardless of WOFIxi desires. i : i
and i : |
7. LICOOK¥/1 went on and on in this/similar veins, very :
impassioned, but very straightforward and withouc personal rancor
+ for the writer. Summing up, the stated reasons as to why she coes
. Rot wish to continue regular collaboration with WOFIRM are as
follows:

A., fear of compromise -- LICCOXY/1 said ‘that were her
relationship with us to become known, it wo.ld ruin her
“1 standing in and Lehesauicepanaentteg wita the inteliectual H i .

lack of understanding -- VOFIRM, excepc Zor the three
officers cited apove, does “ot reat, uncerstana th E
real LICCOKY/i. : i
~ 1
Obviously, the unsaid reasons are the ones that zeai!
zion", in the writer's opinion:

stability -- LicCOk¥/1, as has been known for
writer, is not tne most stable of individuals;

enotional
years by ti

Foney -- LICOOKY/1 xeceives ro money from us anynore
(since her termination in Mexico), and the writer suspects
at LICOOKY/1 couic have more easily rationalized working
for the "Giant Indices in Washington” were sn* on saiary;

sex -- in this case, lack of same (LICCOKY/1 cones always |

her Case Officers cantot fulfill this need, thus 3:

ichout relying on the Case Officer, but now she is

discipline -- again, in this case, lack of same; iiccoxv/l
tell us what she does, we don't tell her what she should
do. ft

LICOOKY/1 exhibited some anguish over this whole affair.

She has been upset Zor the past month, over this as well as over

© one point.what aid and comfort could have been extended to
~ICOOKY/2 to alleviate her anguish, and the writer beat a hasty

che confused outlook for her in general. It was made very clear ;

Not eleborated above were the writer's answers <9 |

ACTION ReQ: Per paral & 7

1. During a meeting with LICOOKY/1 on 7 March 1968, the agent
Passed on the following inforzation which aay be of interest to the
appropriate Headquartars components. L/1 apologized for the lack
of details, but the agent was not in a, position to puzp for further
information beyond that which was voluntesred.

2. On 7 March Tana de GA'SZ, a naturalised U.S. citizen of
Spanish origin, said that she had been tzlephoned the night before by
the cam af haw halfictctan Horredan (Test name unknown to L/1), her
nephew Roy. The latter is a college stuijent somewhere in Connecticut
(possibly the University of Connecticut), and his home is somewhere
in Westchester County. Roy said that he was calling his Aunt Tana
because he knew that she had worked for ¢SS during wiII; Tana
rejoined that she had never had anything to iio with OSS, that she i
had worked for the Office of sar Information (GWi). At any rate, ‘
Roy said that he wanted to tell his Aunt Tana that he had been E
Trecruited” by the CIA, and that he was only going to work for the
CIA $0 as to evade th3 draft. ‘Spon being questicned on this, Roy
waintained that ha had been “recruited’ 5; the CIA cn campus.

3. The nephew's statements rather rattled Tana de GAYEZ, to
the point where she had to take her heart medicine for palpitations
(she has a heart history). Azong other things, Tana was upset by the
thought of a family sember beinz affiliated with the CIA, even though |;
the nephew is disliked by her as an individual.

4. Tana de GAYSZ was a nenber of the U.S. delegation to the _
Havana Cultural Congress in January 1968. She is a well-known figure |;
in the intellectual leftist set in New York, and is outspokenly pro- |:
Castro. She is a menber of the editorial board of Grove Press; is
a published author herself; ani is a close friend and associate of
John GBRASSI, formarly of Razparts Vazazine. H

this to be incompatible «ith being a vizorous "New Left" type. She |

Headquarters; if co, this dispatch should be cross-referenced to
that file. If not, the Base suggedts that de CA'ZZ bo indexed.

to him meant that he had been accepted for employzent.

Job for Fidel Castro with the idea of faailiarizing | the
American people with Castro's writing. June Cobb believes
Castro 4s coing a treaendous job in reconstructing the ;
economy of Cuba, However, she stated that in her opinion
it is unthinkable that Communism would ever be cabraced by
Castro or the people of Cuba. There seeas to be no particular
significance to this report as this infovaation was previously
known by the Agency.

captioned "June COBB - Internal Security - Cuba". Bernie
Brennan asked June Cobb to deliver some infurmation to
Juan-Orta who stated that Brennan was not neeced anymore.
Cobb thought Brennan might have been attempting to obtain
a position with the Cuban Tourist Commission. The Agency
has no further interest in Brennan. Therefore, there is,
no significance attached to the report.

4. Washington report dated 4/26/62 captioned "Lyle

she could call that office if contact were necessary vhile

she was in the United States. She asked if that would

still be the case and was told that it was but only to

attempt such contact for an important or urgent matter. ‘

Request for Termination of Project LICOOKY

:
The L'COOKY Project was last approved for the period |

$2,530

for FY 1965 and $2,610 tor FY 1966, 1! 18 requested that *
the LICOOKY Project be terminated effective 1 January 1966,
based on the foliowizg infornation geared to the outline

in CSI-F NO, 230-60.
(1) Project Name! LICOOZY

LSet oR

ae

Original Project Objectives: Identify and report
on plans. activities and asesciates of Cestral

American Communists resident in or visiting Mexico
seen

Reason for Terminat io: LICOORY-1 lost her acceas
to the hard core group of CA conmunists partly
because of her close association with LISLUCK who
publicly renounced fix break with the G.atemalan
CP in 196Z. The loss ct access was also partly
due to Le1's own apparent indiscretion .is-aevis.
Soze of her close friends in ¥exico City. This
can be attributed both to het cr. growing distaste
he grubby and blindly soning eenbers of
this group with wtoa she was asked to consort, and
her reaction in her social group which tcok the
form increasingly of arts-Consunist remarks, and.
to the concomitant ‘or possitiy resultant! rumors
reney. that she was in the pay

. Attempts were made to take advantage
of her connections with literary circles in
Mexico, but her inatility to budget her tane,
sufficiently to satisfy station requirenents led
to the decision to terminate ner, A contributiag
cause was also her inability to regularize her
status in Mexico se she could accept a paying
powition which would give her reason to remain
there, with the resultant strain of the thin
Jegend that her father was providing ker support.

(Attachment B) continued the atteck on ‘the Conference and its participests,
Claiming in effect that it is a cleer anti-Soviet move backed by ODACID. As of
a 28 Yey, according to the article, n-zerous signatures had been collecteé on a
‘Progressive ranifesto" protesting tie Conference, The list includes meny well
Mexican Communists and pro-Commmists. Attached also (Attachment C) isa i
copy of the "progressive manifesto", vidch was published in 21 Dfa on 13 May 1966, i Fi

end @ copy of a menifeszo (Attachzert D) published in El Heraijo, 22 April 1966,
by the Mexican Comittee for the DeZense of the Jews in the USSR, in which a i
muzber of demands are rade on the Scviet Governnent with respect to the Jews end |
their rights. :

3. Le Voz de Mextco,15 May 1946 (Attachment E) carried an article bitterly
attacking the Conference, which it charges is being organized and held by groups
aod persous in the service of ODACID. It specifically nemes LICOOKY-1, although
the latter's cee is ircorrectly spelled, as one of those responsible for the
Conference and says she is "well connected" with ODYOKE police. Sucesos,
21 May 1966, carried en article (Attechment F) attacking the Conference end ite 7

organizers ano cparging toat were wic biuidecs Sees Loltnt 4)
‘This article carries a picture of LICOOKY-1.

4. Sucesos, 4 June 1966, included an inserted sheet (not found in ell copics
of this edition) entitled “An Agent of the FAI and IVTERPOL in the Association of
Mexicen Writers,” which deals alos? exclusively with LICOCKY-1, her ezpalsion from ‘
Fi Cuba, work in Mexico, end contacts and activities in Mexico. It cherges thet in
ae Mexico she is working for Daniel Jezes, who is responsible to KUBARK (Actachment G).: al J

5. LICOOKY-1's nese eppeared in a notice (Attachment B) eppearing in EL
Excelsicr, 28 May 1960 by Vicente E-neverrfa del Prado, treasurer of the Mexican
ssociation of Writers (AEM - Asociacién de Escritores de México, A,C.), which
sizply stated that LICOOKY-1 is not authorized to accept dies or handle other
Dasiness of the AEM vithin the province of the treasurer's cuties end obligations.
Bovever, in view of tke adverse publicity previously, the announceent bed the :
effect or implied thet the AEMAC or renbers of that group believed the charges 2
that LICOOKY-1 had a pert in organizing the Conference and/or is an agext of j
KUBARK, The notice, es it appears, also implies that LICOCAY-1 was mishandling
AEMAC funds. Echeverrfa offered to rublish the clarification on the sceet on
which the AEMAC enrouncement appears; however, LICOOKY-1 asked him not to do so ent
+said she would take up the notice aad any clarification vith the AEMAC Justice end }
Bonor Commission. ;

}
J
}

6. On 9 June 1966 while conversing with SEW (Attachzent I), Leonov said
that LICOOKY-1 hed celled him to say that she hed had nothing to do wits the
Gonference, end does not want the Soviets to catalogue her as an enemy. Leonov
commented that LICOOKY-1 kad left Lia her phone’ number and had esked hia to help
ber (presumably refute the charges that she was involved with the Conference).
‘The LILINK case officer who currently handles LICOOKY-1 said on the morning of
2S June 1966 that LICOCKY!1 told him she had called the Soviet Press Attaché to
@eny that sbe hed had anything to do vith the Conference “because it is what she
would normally do," Ske did not, bovever, mention beforehand that she intended
to call the Soviet Rnbassy.



CONTINUATION-OF DISPATCH 3e

J. The Station believes that most or all articles ettacking the Conference,
end particularly those attacking LICOOKY-1, vere Soviet ingpired, and it is further
believed that SEND wrote nost 1f not el) articles attacking the Conference which
@ppeared in La Voz, Pciftica ard uceccs. The Soviets, who are probably ewere of
previous Cuken charges trat LICOCKY-1 1s an ODYOKE agent, probably felt that as |
an Americen closely essociated with the AEYAC LICOOKY-1 vould be vulnerable to
such en attack. i

8. As a result of the 3 article of 4 June 156 en official from the
Ministry of Governzent did visit LICOOKY-1 to check on Ler documentation. The
officiel said that he 4id not Lelieve the charges made in the Sucesos article,

le since her tourist visa had expired he edvised her to imediately leave the

country in order to renew it, end he provided her with a letter to show to
J] Mexicen border authorities peraitting her exit. She is currently in PEPRIME but
Hl a t nate th Mexico in a few days. :

9. As Headquarters is avare, LICOOKY-1 will be terminated effective

30 June 1966; the decision to terminate her was made some time ago, prior to the
occurrence of the Conference and the resulting adverse propeganda. While she
may be of enue occasional use should she return to end rezain in Mexico, it is
believed that the recent adverse propacenda has impaired ner future usefulness
in Mexico, although zeny Mexicans undoubtedly do not believe the charges and
others offered to "cone to her defense."

20, A dispatch vill be prepared and forwarded when the termination has been
completed, end any rey developments with respect to her alleged participation

the above Conference will t+ included in that dispatch. fee

@. LICOOKY-1] has continued to devote the bulk of her

time to the Mexican Writers' Association (ABM). She
continues to handle most of its administrative work.
She also organizes and does most of the work on the
majority of the projects or activities which the ;
AEM sponsors.

b, L-1 continued to report on efforts to establish the
Latin American Writers’ Community (CLE), including
the results of the Organizing Congress in Arica, Chile.

She reported on the steps taken by Mario Monteforte :
‘Toledo in beginning preparations for an early 1967 :
Congress in Hexico and on the AEM's probable role in
helping organize that Congress.

c. L-1 supplied information on resections among the Cen-

need doing at AEM to occupy her full-time and there-
fore the inmediate partial withdrawal from ARM work

activities, and therefore in determining the direc-

tion and scope of these activities, her sudden with-

Any major change in direction by AEM would probably
become predictable once the identity of the person

by L-1 become known. By having L-1 step aside now,

MEMORANDUM FOR: CI Staff

SUBJECT : Alleged Planned Travel to Cuba of Estel
Sakolowska

1. On 7 February LICOOKY-1 told the writer that Estel
Sakolowska, a long-time acquaintance, had told her that she
is planning a trip to Cuba. Sakolowska is now married to
Mario Madrigal, a Costa Rican medical doctor who is now in
Cuba. Sakolowska told LICOOKY-1 that she is now in the pro- |
cess of obtaining a (U.S.) passport for her child so that t
they can travel together to Cuba. This is her child's first 7
passport. Her explanation for requesting the passport is i :
for making a trip to Costa Rica. Sakolowska claims that is
the passport appiscaiivn is i te Ropartment : 7
"Security Section".

2. Sakolowska also told LICOOKY-1 that the "Prensa
Latina Bureau Chief" had proposed to her an apparent intel-
ligence mission to accomplish enroute to Cuba. She believes! =
this mission is to take place in Miami, LICOOKY-1 reported =
that on 7 February Sakolowska had a luncheon engagement
with "someone" at the United Nations and speculates it may

be to pick up a package to take to someone in Cuba. LICOOKY-1 1

further speculates that this may only be a gift to someone :

in Cuba. : 3 : ja
|

3. LICOOKY stated that she had no additional information. :
It should be noted, however, that this item was given in a ‘a
last minute rush just prior to her dcparture from the writer. a
LICOOKY-1 expects to be in New York until the end of February.

4, LICOOKY-1 states that Sakolowska has been a long-time
"left winger". LICOOKY-1 reported earlier on Sakolowska and-
her connections with revolutionaries in Central America and |
Havana in dispatch HMMA 27924 dated 21 September 1965 pages ;
4 and 6. This office is planning no further action on this |
matter and in line with the writer's telephone conversatio.
with Frank Hughes of the CI Staff today, we understand thane H
office will be coordinating the Subject with the FBI 1

SUBJECT 2 Alleges Planned Travol to Cuba of

Estelle Sckolowska
REFERENCE : Beso, Same Subject, Dated 8 February 1936

1. On 22 February LICOORY-1 told ne that the referenced
Pronsa Latina correspondent, according to Sokclovaka, had
Just advised ber she would receive $590 operational expenses
tor the alleged intelligence assigment in the Miami area and
This information was
Passed orally to your office 23 February.

2. On 28 February LICOOZY-1 told me that while visiting
with Sokolowska im New York on 23 February tro FDI agents
called at the Sokolowsia apartment and ‘ntervioved Sokolowska
about ker intended travel to Cuba. According to L-1 tbe
agenta warned Sokelowska that she would be in serious trouble
4f sho attempted such trip. The interview vent on about three

hours during which tize L-] remained im Sokolowska's apartment,

Semetives in the living room and sonetizes in the kitchen
where the interview reportedly was taking place. L-1 stated
that as a result of the warping by the FBI agents Sokolowska
later told L-1 she would not make the trip.

3. Presumably the FBI, if the above etory is accurate,
had reason for this reported action ever though from the
limited information available, from L-l, there would seem a
peoasibility of other more profitable courses of actioa.

4.  L-1 states that Sokolcwska bad heard that her
husband, now in Cuba, was living in Sokolowska's house asd
with a nurse to vhon he was (engaged). It was partially for
this reason Sokolevska wished to visit Cuba at this tine.

S. This office ia taking no further action on this
matter unless so requested and suggests that addressees
coordinate any planned adviee o2 this mtter to the Bureau.

Jack, »

I briefed for 30 minutes on LICOOKY
giving him the full background on her ‘io,
education, Cl frelationship---from recruit-
ment through current use in Mexico. My
Suggestion was that she be told to go to
NY and find a job which would give her a
means of liv2lihood as well as cover for any
future CIA income. After 6 months (or some
other specific period cf time) it would be
arranged that either we contact her or she
contact us to determine what her personal
situation was and whether she would then be
in a position to target against selected
persons of interest to CIA

SES Souls thee Le ell a appa waa
for herCIA work. wanted to
_ think about it bu oug! at this would

be the best approach. He will talk to you
before Friday.

His only question was whether we had any
indication whether she was under develop-
ment by the opposition---Soviet, Cuban, etc.
I told hin that as far as I knew there was
No such j=tiactien——tf J] am wrong (per
your and recent activity)
you better correct this.

-DearRtK Mise Pineicch :

‘ona
| Reference is made to Sh MPAHR of So SOP GER a states

Government, as represented by the Contracting Officer.

Arrangements have been recently completed allowing certain :
independent contractore of this organization to obtain social security
credits by covering such individuals under the eocial security tax
provisions applicable to employees. These arrangements also include ‘|
a provision for retroactive applicability to the beginning of the 5 -
1965 tax year. This can be done only for reasons of security since :
the procedure results in reducing the social security tax from the
self-employed rate to the employee rate. For example, in January
of 1965 the tax rates were 5.4 and 3-5/Bh rezpectively.

Ao a consequence thereoi, said contract is ainended by deieiing
all reference to social security and by adding the following paragraph:

- “Effective 1 December 1964, social security taxes will be covertly

deducted by this organization from your compensation in the same 1

manner and to the same extent as would be done if you were a Govern- H \

ment employee. Security reasons make this procedure necessary. Its: i

implementation does aot imply ir any manner the actual creation of an seeceetPeeces!

' employce-employer relationship. Your legal status under this agree- f
ment continues to be that of an independent coatractor. ©

If you receive or expect to receive full or partial social security
credits from overt sources you will so notify this organization and an H
sdjustmest will be made or covert deductions discontinued, depending i
upon the circumstances. Further, if you should subsequently receive :
overt social security credits, evidence thereof will be submitted to this
organisation. In such event your covert credits will be erased and dyour
covert deductions returned.

All other terme and conditions of said contract remain in full force

and effect. i

1, LICOOZY-1's efforts as described in retererce have
substantial ecrit and some potential pzrticularly if the Stat:cn can
find a way to tie them in with the LIK&AM effort in the intellectual
field,

2, LICOOKY-1 certainly is to be coumended for her effort in
getting aritirs Moth of eke stoke ana lege eneh ae Carlos PELLICER -
Cemara to join the AEM. Fron » KUBARK standpoint the nost interesting
contact is the one with PELLICER because he kas been the reported force
behind the COMES/CLE effort in Hexico.

3. Although her assigned tasks as reported in para 7 a, b and d
oy the LILIKK meso do not entail making her vitting of other Station
assets engaged in KHSPAXN Ops among the intellectuals, an amencment
te her OA is required, and one has been requested. If her efiorts
H progress to the poict where she sight be abie to influence leftist

write: heir efforts to establish the CLE in Kexico (para 7 ¢ of
LILINK nemo) Headquarters should be forwarded your ideas on why and how
LICOOKY-1 should be used as un active MHSPAWN agent, and another
armendment will be required for this role.

4, AXDRIETYE will discuss this operation with the Station during
his TDY.

. 3. In view if the restricted OA which confines KUDARK
association with LICOOKY-1, it is important that Ueacquarters remain
aware of any unusual activity in her personal life which might affect
her security or the granting of amendments to her OA for individual
operations. Therefore, ve would appreciate your kecping us informed
on @ more timely basis of any undertakings such as the recruitments
for membership in the AEM described in reference. i
