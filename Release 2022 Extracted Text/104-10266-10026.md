D ISOLOG/LICOOKY -- Termination of Contact with LICOOKY/1

Action required: retire file, again.

References:

UNDA 3502,

22 January 1968

B. UNDA 3650, 13 March 1968

1. During a meeting with LICOOKY/1 on 5 April 1968 agreement

was reached that the KOFIRM relationship with her would be terminated.

A memorandum of contact (NYM-2689) concerning the meeting is attached

herewith, and indicates the reasons for this termination.

No admin-

istrative action is required of either the Base or Headquarters

in this inctanes, so tImar/1 120 not being pale by do todd, tia

was formally terminated once before (1966).

Her file can be retired,

• again, and

this time presumably will be the last time.

Termination was very amicable, and LICOOKY/l nolds no ill-

will for WOFIRM:

she just does not wish

to have any relationship

with WOFIRM anymore.

The writer fully expects to hear from LICOOKY/1 from time

to time by phone (in fact, she called later the same day of the

meeting to wish the writer a pleasant Easter, as she had forgotten

to do so during the meeting), but does not plan any further personal

contact.

I knew sonething was bothering LICOoki/1 and made her

drag it out into the open. " She stated by remarking that kOfIRY

and its computer apparently checked the welfare of its oid agents

every to often, and that this was the nature of our relationship.

I explained that this was not the case.

that I had found out she

was in Manhattan

ard suggested to washington that LICCOXY/1

might be of some value to us.

This surprised her, and she apolo-i

gized.

she then took off on how whoa she was in Cubaisie had

dealt with Fidel and Che and Celia, ind when sie was invoived

with Guatemala she was dealing with ARaVALO. She said that she

didn't want to sound snobbisi, but that she was accustomea to

dealing with top politicos and intellectuais; she referica to a

statement that I had made previously that perhaps she couid get

Tana de GAMEZ to invite her aiong to one of Tana's lunches with

Cuban Permanent Representative Ricardo ALARCON Quesada.

She said

that she didn't wart NOFIPM to thir% that she would seei out and

cultivate lower level people, that she wasn't built that way.

LICOOK1/1 said that

even though Tana was a friera and that she

liked ner, Tana was not ner equad, ano that toña wash i on les l

pedestal".

That KiRCON was certainiy not in iicoony/l's intellectual

category.

LICOOKX/1 said that she considered harself as very flexible,

but not that nuch.

LICOOKI/l is a "special person" and that

WOFIR' bureaucracy -- with the exceptions of "Biil" ('er Mexico

case officer, a friend of the writer;, C/is/l (with wnom

i LICOOKX/1

is particularly taxen), aná the writez (LICOOKY/1 repeatealy assured

me that she had & very

sincere esteen for me) - probably didn't

understard or acknowiedge this.

LICOCKY/l said her feelings for

certain lOIRkers were one thing, but her dislike of HOrIl! itself

was something else.

WOFIRM is a massive card index that snows Miguel

Angel ASTURIAS as an old "Nicaraguan war-horse" -- ASTURIAS Of

course is Guatemalan. LICOOKX/1 couian't stop liking Communists

regaraless of WOFIni desires.

LICOOKY/l went on and on in this/similar veins, very

impassioned, but very straightforward and without personal rancor

Sunming up, the stated reasons as to why she does

. not wisi to continue regular collaboration with WOrIRY are as

foilows:

fear of compromise -- LICCOKY/1 said that were her

relationship with us to becone known, it wouid ruin her

standing in and associations with the inteliectual

community:

B.

distaste for KOFIRY - LICOONY/i ¿cuily believes that

WOFIRM is a large card file with uis the caras daving

errors on them;

8. Obviously, the unsaid reasons are the ones that eaily

prought about this

"confrontacion", in

the writer's opinion:

These

are as foliows:

A. emotional instability - LiCcliy/1, as has been inown for

years by the writer, is not the most stable of irdividuals;

3.

C.

LONEY - LICOOKY/1 receives to money from us anymore

(since her termination in lexicoi, and the writer suspects

that LICOOKY/l colid have more easily rationalized working

for the "Giant Indices in Washington" were sh: on saiary; .

sex -- in this case, lack of sane (LICCOKY/1 comes always!

cotain her physical/erotionai fulfillment in Cuba and

attention from men in the environment of a place such as

D. discipline -- again, in this case, lack of same: IICOOKX/1

LICOOKY/1 exhibited some anguish over this whole affair.

Sine has been upset for the past month, over this as well as over

ine confused outlook for her in general. It was made veiy ciear

-i one point. what aid and comfort could have been extended to

ICOOKY/l to alleviate her anguish, and the writer beat a hasty

cetreat to the kitchenette for a tactical drink of water.

Bald she will look for a job there, and 1a confident she

3. I-I 1s subletting the anartment she occupies' here. She

, has purchased the KUBARk-owned household effects which

reason, in addition to the fact that she has acquired

murder of demands are zade on the Soviet Government with respect to the jews and

their rights.

La Voz de N'excico, 15 May 1956 (Attachment E) carried an article bitterly

attacking the Confererce, which it charges is being organized end held by groups

and persons in the service of ODACID.

It specifically nemes LICOOKY-l, although

CONTINUATION-OF DISPAICH

To The Station belleves that most or all articles ettacking the Conference,

and particularly those attacking LICOOKY-1, vere soviet lIspired, and lt 1s further

belleved that SEtO urete Dost 1l not all articles attacilne the Conference which

appeared 1n La Voz, Política ard SuceLoE. The soviets, uso are probably evere of

previous tuben charges trat LICocKy-l 1s an OdYOKE syent, probably felt shat as

an American closely essociated with the AllAC LICOOKY-1 could be vulnerable to

such an attack.

8. As a result of the sucesos article of 4 June 1906 an official fron the

Ministry of Government did vialt LICOOKY-l to check on ter documentation.

officiel said that he did not belleve the cherges made 1n the Sucesos ariicle,

but since her tourist visa had expired he edvised her to imediately leave the

coustry in order to rerew it, and he provided her with a jetter to show to

Medcan border authorities peraitting her ext.

She 18 currently in PBPRUE but

9. As Headquarters 1s aware, LICOCKY-l will be terrinated effective

30 Jure 1906; the decision to terminate her vas made sose time ago, prior to the

occurrence of the Cozierence and the resulting adverse propeganda.

While she

may be oi snue occasional use should she return to end rezain in Mexico, 1t 18

believed that the recent adverse propagenda has impaired der future usefulness

in lieziso, altbough zeny lexicans undoubtedly do not belleve the charges and

others offered to

"cose to her defense."

10. A dispatch till be prepared and forwarded when the termination has been

completed, end any sey developnents with respect to her alleges pariicipatión 1a

need doing at AEl to occupy her full-time and there-

fore the lamediate partial althdrawal from AsM fork

1s a prerequisite to the accouplishment of these

c.

Because L-l has played such a key role in all All

tion and scope of these actirities, her sudden with-

Any major change in direction by AEl would probably

become predictable once the identity of the person

or persons who will nove in to fill the vacancy left

by Il become known. By having L-l step aside now,

rether than walting until she is ready to leave Mexico,

she may then be able to provide Siation with an ac-

curate account of any change resulting from her with;

drawal.

MEMORANDUM FOR: CI Staff

SUBJBCT

: Alleged Planned Travel to Cuba of Estel

Sakolowska

passport. Her explanation for requesting the passport is

for making a trip to Costa Rica.

Sakolowska claims that

the passport auvircaiive is son 1n the State Monartment

"Security Section"

2.

Sakolowska

also told LICOOKY-l that the "Prensa

Latina

Bureau Chief" had proposed to her an apparent intel-

ligence mission to accomplish enroute to Cuba.

She believes

this mission is to take place in Miami. LICOOKY-l reported

that on 7 February Sakolowska had a luncheon engagement

with "someone" at the United Nations and speculates it nay

be to pick up a package to take to someone in Cuba.

LICOOKY-1

further speculates that this may onlj be a gift to someone

in Cuba.

LICOOKY stated that she had no additional information.

It should be noted, however, that this item was given in a

last minute rush just prior

to her doparture from the writer.:

LICOOKY-1 expects to be in New York until the end of February.

4.

LICOOKY-1 states that Sakolowska has been a long-time

"left

winger'. LICOOKY-l reported earlier on Sakolowska and

her connections with revolutionaries in Central America and

Havana in dispatch HIDA 27924 dated 21 September 1965 pages

4 and 6.

This office is planning no further action on this

matter and in line with the writer's telephone conversation

with Frank Hughes of the CI Staff today, we understand your

office will be coordinating the Subject

with the FBI

State Department.

These arrangements also include

a provision for retroactive applicability to the beginning of the

sell-employed rate to the employee rate. For example, in January
