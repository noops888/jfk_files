istration was dealing with Cuban polic).. The list of people to attend

Ed Martin, McNamara, McCone, Helms or les Fitzgerald, Don Wilson, Bundy,

garding Cuba: " jay...that you expect to take every available means
to stop and turn back the spread of Communism in this hemisphere."

The meeting appears to be the first major briefing for the new Presi-

cluded a detailed description of CIA assets in Cuba, Proposed sabotage plans,
and attempts by the CIA to stimulate an internal coup which would
dislodge Castro. The CIA was aiding tw> exile groups in particular:

one led by Manuel Artime, the other by ‘tanolo Ray. _Bundy recommends

; Bundy recommends a Cabinet-level review of the whole principle of
covert sabotage against Cuba. He notes that Rusk and McNamara do not
support the program of sabotage, while ‘McCone and the CIA are for it,
and so are most of the middle-level officers dealings with the Castro
problem." Bundy concludes: "...in.your position, I would stop sabotage
attacks on the ground that they are ill agal, ineffective, and damaging
to our broader policy." :

18. Memo, Chase to Bundy, 21 April 1964.

Notes that Alexis Johnson is in charg: of contingency planning for a coup
in Cuba.

19. Memo, Chase to Bundy, 14 May 1964. .

This memo suggests that a primary goal of the Johnson Administration was
"to keep the lid on Cuba" until after the November Presidential elections.
Thus, the continued exile raids were view:d negatively since they increased
the noise level. The memo makes it clear that. the exile raids were becoming
completely beyond U.S. control despite CL\ financial support to the groups.

20. Memo, Chase to Bundy, 2 June 1964.

Chase notes that Castro has executed -hree anti-Castro Cubans and jailed _
two others as CIA agents. CIA admits hav.ng a connection with the executed -
Cubans "but that it is completely deniabl:."

21. Memo, Helms, DDP, to DCI, 10 June 1961. Subject: "Plans of Cuban
Exiles to Assassinate Selected Cuban Gove: nment Leaders"

The CIA was made aware of certain plas to kill Castro. The Agency told
the sources, according to Helms, that "th: United States Government would not,
under any circumstances, condone the plamied actions." Apparently on 2 March
1964 a wealthy Cuban exile was approached with a Cosa Nostra offer to assassinate
Castro for $150,000. The wealthy exile timed down the offer. Similar offers
were make to other Cuban exiles in early Iarch. A leading figure in the
negotiations was Byron Cameron, a shippin;:-businessmen from Ft. Lauderdale.
An agreement was finally made to pay the Cameron group $100,000 for killing
Castro, plus $2,500 for expenses. Julio ).obo Olavarria, a wealthy Cuban
exile in New York was to pay mich of the iioney, and did pay the $2,500 on
25 April, Though Came: ‘group Tremaine! anonymous, it was clear the Mafia
was involved. Cameron @led that his contact was a police officer in the

22. Memo, Chase to Bundy, 15 June 1964. ‘ubject: "Assassination:f Castro."

Referring to the above memo from DDP 1.0 DCI, Chase notes that John
Crimmins feels the matter should be discu: sed at a Special Group meeting.

"John's own inclination is that the U.S. ‘iovernment cannot knowingly permit
any criminal American involvement in this sort of thing, " notes Chase,
"and should go all out to stop the plot." In marginal notations, Bundy
agrees with John and with the need to forvard the matter to the Special

23. Memo, Chase to Bundy, 16 June 1964, w.th attachment (Des FitzGerald's
"A Reappraisal of Autonomous Operations")

FitzGerald makes a defense of the autonomous operations. Tom Mann and
Chase disapprove of the operations, thougi for different reasons.

24. Memo, Chase to Bundy, 18 June 1964.

Chase warns that further U.S. support of the autonomous groups is more
likely to lead to a U-2 shootdown and a Ciribbean crisis than the overthrow
of the Castro regime. Chase continues to be worried about noice levels
and the November election. This memo is ‘ery mich like his 14 May memo
{see Item 19).

25. Memo for the Record, Peter Jessup, 22 June 1964.

e In a reference to Helm's memo on assaisination (see Item 21), it was
pointed out in a 303 Committee meeting of 18 June that "these reports, in
effect, put the United States Government on notice that failure to take
preventive action could be construed as condonation. " The AG said Justice
would look into the matter.

26. Memo, McCone to Bundy, 19 August 1964.

McCone summarizes the FBI investigation of Cuban exile plots against
Castro as outlined in Helm's memo of 19 Jime (See Item 21). The Bureau
interviewed many people allegedly invo.ved, most of whom denied the existence
of such a plan. (The did not interv.ew Cameron, since he was out of
the coititry}. « The geresting findiig was that Lobo had in fact
discussed the matter : ee

directed covert program.

28. Memo, R.C. Bowman to Bundy, 12 Novembc-r 1964, with JCS attachment
dated 30 October 1964. Subject: SQUARE J/ANCE.

A contemptable proposal intiated by tle Army‘to usel gam vactarg) against
Cuban sugar and livestock. Bowman and Bundy agree that the White e should

“remain aloof from formal consideration of ‘Square Dance' at this stage."
I believe this plan for covert action {is «ven more shocking and unacceptable

29. Memo, Chase to Bundy, 12 November 1964, and attachment (apparently
a Bundy memo for a meeting with LBJ on 7 April 1964).

The Bundy memo suggests that LBJ approved various options “short of
war to get rid of thd, Castro regime," including the possible contamination
of sensitive Cuban imports (not food). The Chase memo indicates that a
Fitzgerald operation was underway in November 1964 to ship contaminating
elements into Cuba.

30. Memo, Chase to Bundy, 30 December 1964.

The Artime group is out of control, though State, Defense and CIA
(as well as Bundy) all agree that it would be unwise to try to interfere
with him at this stage.

31. Memo, Chase to Bundy, 5 January 1965.

Chase reports a plan told to Crimmiis and the CIA about an Artime plot
to stage a "palace coup" during which Castro and other top leaders would be
"neutralized." - D-Day was to be March 13. This matter was to be discussed
at an upcoming Special Group meeting on shether or not "to cut off Artime's
water." Chase notes: "CIA at this point is loath to make a hard evaluation -
of the Artime/Cubela plot."

32. Memo to 303 Committee, unsigned, 18 January 1965, presumably a CIA
document. .

Discusses the virtues of continuing Underwater Demolition Teams against
ships in Cuban harbors. If such activities are disallowed, the CIA should
be authorized to reduce ite commitment i1 the paramilitary field.

33. Memo, Chase to Bundy, 8 February 1955.

This memo indicates that not even Actime had his group in control. The

memo also discusses CIA covert activitie i Linas

35. Memo, Chase to Bundy, 2 March 1965

Discussion of who is for maintainin; a covert capability against Cuba =
(presently on the shelf) and who is opposed. Chase guessed that CIA would paca
be opposed ("fish or cut bait"); State would not. Rusk's general attitude

toward Cuba at this time was to keep the temperature low while sorting out

the Vietnam problem.

36. Memo, Chase to Bundy, 4 March 1965.

eo Chase recommend#phasing out support to Artimé. The CIA is consider-
ing diluting pesticides sent to Cuba; tlis is similar to the kinds of tactics a
mentioned in Items 28 and 29 above and :re a manifestation of the moral pis
bankruptcy of U.S. palicy. Also some t:1k here of backing a new exile i
group, RECE, though not much enthusiasm for the idea from anyone apparently.
Oddly, CIA wishes to drop its paramilit:ry capability, while DoD and State
want the capability maintained.

37. Memo, Grant Hilliker (State) to Burdy, 18 June 1965.

This is a summary of U.S. policy tcward Cuba. The ultimate objective ate:
is still to replace the Castro regime. The memo notes that "the paramilitary Fee
program involving CIA-controlled actions was set aside even before it really
started.”

38. Memo, Bundy to LBJ, 26 June 1965.

Adm. Raborn recommends reactivatior of a paramilitary effort against
Cuba. Bundy, Tommy Thompson, Rusk, McNemara, and Cy Vance are against this
chiefly because of the concomitant international noise level. "Most of us,"Bundy
writes, "do not recommend visible violent actions against Cuba." Raborn's
recommendations said nothing about assassination.

@ 39. Memo, Rostow to LBJ, 30 May 1966. :

Rostow notifies the President that a CIA exfiltration mission ran into
ambush and the agents were captured. Th2 President could expect "the noise
level of Castro's charges of ‘threatened Yankee aggression’ may go up."

40. Memo, Karamessines, DDP, to Rostow, 7 August 1967.

This memo is important because it lists the names of two or three Cubans
who worked on CIA’missions. If they are in the U.S., it may be worthwhile
talking to them about Laven activities.
