at

. and E& Mund Subj is on the harm done to our cause by
propaganda out by o1 e has maintained for some months, that in

i part CASTRO's march into the Communist camp was encouraged “oy gur generei propaganda
campaign. Her contention is thet the & already know there are ope

| and garbage in the back yard, and that our constant dunning of this fact
ears and eyes of the Cubans is simply =cbbing salt into wounds. It is cestructive
rather than constructive propayinda.

By way of illustration, she laid out side by side Revolucion, Bohemia, ani Bohemia
Libre, Even without staring the ecxtert of the articles, -he visual exersles
Were obvious. One of her points: that even iliiterates would get a messaze from
the human interest photography of aersiveion ani Bohemia, 2
used primarily "mg" shots. (Judging oy the exanpies she showed me, ene Tad @

arid Horacio 30DOY, Argentine law stuient at Yale, on one of several prozects he
is undertakirg in connecticn with the L.A.States. These include a proposted

tax reform plan for certain L.A.States. She will get further details fra. BARNES

like to work on one of his projects iz Washington, D.C. for GAS - she is teing
discouraged irom accepting this pasition. \

Subj was advised that since she had teen unable to return to Cuba, the cozditions
of her proposed contract vere invalid. She was informed, however, that we were
attempting to.arrive at a fair arrangenent for paying her - that in the interim .
we would pay al expenses involved in her travel and activities performed at our :

direction - in addition we give her occasional spot nts for information

received. A monthly retainer was discussed with (cl: mron§|.~ approxix:
$50.00 a month - since she has no constant source of income. “However, sixce she
will be on a salary with BARNES, it weuld appear advisable to hold this anount
against her future needs.
