4. Except for item 3-A the above points could be 'construed as having a

CI conotation 1.e.:

A.. Subject appears to be receiving funds from some outside source.

B.

Subjacts relatives in the Soviet Union could constitute an intelli-

gence control factor.

C. Subject has had one known meeting with a Soviet official with

intelligence connections.

_On the other hand a controled and recruited source reports that Subject

receives money from his father; that Subject who is probably a Jaw hingelf is

cognizant of anti-semitisn in the Soviet Union and that he has made disparaging

remarks about the Soviet regime. Further, the soviets are known to ca very

active in the American student colony in Copenhagen and as an isolated incident

in Itself we do not attach any necessarily sinister import to the fact that

an American student was socially introduced to a Sovist national.

5. He belleve that during the developmental phase, the case officer

should attempt to create an apening for Subject to voluntarily bring up his

meeting and/or relationship with ABARCHALIN. A voluntary statement would

appear to resolve to a considerable degree any negative questions concerning

this meeting. Should Subject fall to bring the meeting out then the matter

sould have to be resolved through the ICFLuTTER which would probably indispen

able to full exploitation of this case's potential.

6. If you concur with the foregoing on receipt of POA we shall advise

the field to attempt an appreach as stated above.
