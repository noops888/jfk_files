SUBJECT 3s Evaluation of Possible Derogatory Information
on Marvin Kantor.

1. FBI reports contain the following possible derogatory information on
Marvin Kantor:- | ate aeeniaincate Sreeaeaeeneeeeanecseaic

kh. Except for item 3-A the above points could be ‘construed as having a
CI conotation i.e.:

A. . Subject appears to be receiving funds from some outside source.
B. Subjects relatives in the Soviet Union could constitute an intelli-
gence control factor.

C. Subject has had one known meeting with a Soviet official with
intelligence connections. i

CIA
<——0n the other hand a controled and recruited/ source reports that. Subject
receives money from his father; that Subject who is probably a Jaw himself is
cognizant of anti-semitism in the Soviet Union and that he has made disparaging
remarks about the Soviet regime. Further, the Soviets are known to be very
active in the American student colony in Copenhagen and as an isolated incident
in itself we do not attach any necessarily sinister import to the fact that
an American student was socially introduced to a Soviet national.

5S. We believe that during the developmental phase, the case officer
should attempt to create an apening for Subject to voluntarily bring up his
meeting and/or relationship with ABARCHALIN. A voluntary statement would
appear to resolve to a considerable degree any negative questions concerning
this meeting. Should Subject fail to bring the meeting out then the, patter
would have to be resolved through the LCFLUTTER which would probabl; ispen-
able to full exploitation of this case's potential. i

6. I£ you concur with the foregoing on receipt of POA we shall advise
the field to attempt an appraach as stated above.
