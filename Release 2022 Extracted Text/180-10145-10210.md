Plans for the Establishment of the Cuban Provisional Governmeta.
Droller and Nepoli met with Varona on Feb 17. On same day they had a
neeting with both Varona and Rey. Droller presented list af 29 names
from which they were to chose 10 for provisional govt. Ray got mad.
Algo gave them a 7 point program as discussed with the Chief of the
Western Hemisphere Division.
Agreed that Varona, Ray, Artime, Carrillo, Chibas and Pazos would meetd’
in N¥ on 26 Feb. in order to examine list of 29 names and make decision
and Ray and Vgrona would retrun to Washington on or about 1 March with
their findings. Droller's C oment: ...."We believe that Varona will
play ball one way or another, but we are not convinced that Ray will
accept our list. We have the impression that he might want to substitute
his own list; of course, we mst see whate he comes up with. In any case it
is our view that we should not rush matters unduly if there is real State
Department interest in hving Mr. Ray and company play a role in the pro-
visional government. Should the decision be made to write Ray off, we believe t
the Assembly could be convolked without too mch ado, substituting Miro
Cardona for Ray. It should be noted that the above is only the gist of a
long eonversatien session which, by the way, was recorded and took place in
the Shoreham hotel...”
