MEMORANDUM FOR: Secretary, CSCS Board

SUBJECT 3 Recommendation for Promotion to GS-17 =
Mr. Tennant H. Bagley

1. It is recommended that Mr. Tennent H. Bagley be pro~
moted to GS-17. He has been in grade os GS-16 since June 1965
and has served as COS in Brussels since August 1967. His
‘previous assignment was as Deputy Chief, SO Division.

- 2. The reasons for this promotion are amply covered in ny
fitness report of this same date. I have just returned from an
extensive trip through the European area, during which I had a
* chance to see and talk with a vory large number of officers
] Pete Bagley is one
of two whom I am recommending for promotion as a result. De is
one of our very finest station chiefs, possessed of imagination,
intellect and ability personally to handle operations which very
few of his colleagues can match. He is one of those on whom
the:future of the Organization is going to depead, and I believe
+ that the promotion is more than justified.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. Robert W. Sheay
Secretary
Clandestine Services
Carcer Service Board

SUBJECT: Tennent H. Bagley.
Promotion to GS-16

1. Mr. Bagley is without question among the best~
qualified of the senior officers in SR Division and is
also one of the most competent counterespionage officers in
the Clandestine Services as a whole, Few have had his prep-
aration or his experience in the Soviet Bloc aspects of

this field. After entering on duty in 1950 he was assigned
to the Vienna Station

{ sbuseansssseesnsssssseonssseeteessssseeoaainsase

2. In 1962 he was appointed Chief of SR Division's
CE clement. Under his direction the CE effort of the
Division took on entirely new dimens - ‘Because of Mr,
Baglcy's marvelous, combination of CS experience, substantive
Knowledge and enthusiasm, the SR/CI Group has become one
of the most effective and highly motivated units ia the
Division. The Group has developed a high level of sub-
stantive specialization which it appli to CS coverage
of | throughout the world.
At the same time, a Targe percentage of the Group's best
officers have beén committed full time to a special opera-
tion of great value and significance, The ability of



i
i
H
H

SR/CI to absorb this workload stems not only from Mr.
Bagiey's capacity for professional guidance but his ef-
fectivencss in leading and inspiring those under him.

3. Mr, Bagley's record to date reveals a high degree
of specialization in counterespionage yet it would be mis-
leading indeed to conclude that his professional interests
and potential are confined to this field. His contribu-
tions to the broader problems of have
been invaluable particularly in
suggested new techniques for attacking t
abroad. an

4. I consider Mr. Bagley an outstanding officer to
whom the Clandestine Services will turn for the cxercise of
still greater responsibilities in the future. He is fully
qualified. for promotion to GS-16. I urge that he be promoted
now in recognition of the work he has donc so far and the
potential he possesses for a productive carcer at the top
level of Clandestine Services officers.

sSumed his duties as Chief of Station on:
: It-is ‘too early to assess the results of
his stewardship; he established in advance a timetable for
building up a structure and it is
not yet clear to what extent these assets are going to be
productive against major targets. However, there is no doubt
that Bagley has ‘tackled his job with originality, energy, and’
enthusiasm. A good indication of these qualities is that,
alone among our European Chiefs of Station, Bagley has himself

4 gMey t

two years.

2. Bagiey' 8 accomplishments must be mensured in light
of the fact that he has-had a weak Deputy Chief of Station,
and that several of the officers in his small Station have
been of quite modest calibre. The restaffing of the Station -
which is taking placg this. summer should result in a con-
siderable leap forward;

3.. On the personal side, Bagiéy has all the qualities
which we could ask for in a Chief .of Station. He is totally
dedicated, incisive and articulate, a pleasant companion and
a gracious host. I rate his overall performance as rong.

From the. beginning. of the reporting period until.
9 September 1965, Mr. Bagley. continued as fief, - —
Counterintelligence’ Group,.SR Division. Mr.. Bagley
was then appointed Deputy ‘Chief, SR Division and has
remained in'that position. He has served as Acting
Division Chief on several occasions including a period
of two. months, in 1965 when I made an’ extensive v: sit to
FE Division stations.

In fact, his appreciation of their strengths and weaknesses
enabled him to place the very best of his officers in key
positions in the CI Group where for the most part they re-
main today. Their performance is still characterized by
the high sense of discipline and professionalism imbued in
them by Mr. Bagley during his service as their chief. [I >
have also been struck by the spirit of loyalty perreating
this group even though Mr. Bagley's associates were often
driven at a pace which would have severcly tested the
‘supervisor/subordinate relationship in-most other wuits.+
At thé same time, he afforded the senior officers of the
CI Group every opportunity for the exercise of initiative
and imaginative leadership at their own levels. Oa the



other hand, he has little patience ieith the “time server’

He is a rapid, accurate and purposeful
worker with unusual powers of concentration, a good writer and articulate
speaker, Although reasonabiy versatile, he has becume a specialist in
tho GE ficla, for which he seoms particularly well suited by natural
talent and personality, Most of his work in his current position has
Pequired analysis, coordination and "desk" management of operations

By virtue of his intellectual capacity and intense interest in his work,
Subject's potential for further development must be rated high. However,
he: should attempt to bring more flexibility and. understanding into hie
relations with others, His views tend to be very positive and sometimes
are argued with more vigor than tact. These are minor weaknesses in

2. Subject's weaknesses, vhich because of his outstanding ability and
promise are rather magnified in thie assessment, lie mainly in his occasionally
faulty husan relations. Subject rejects much of the social life which is
customarily associated (although ‘not necessarily for the best) with Kubark
field posta, His ta, aside from his work, are primarily intellectual =|
and artistic. The: rests, coupled with his at best pro forma fulfilling
of the customary Kubark social protocols, definitely vena Ie Felationship
with the rest of the etaff.———--

+ 3. Subject comes from @ service environment and was himself a Marine t
officer when very young. This early environment and training has, probably =|

Subject"s being aware of it, caused him to expect-of others a devotion te duty
and self discipline whichis rarely to be found. These high standards have
caused Subject to diséouit to some degree the abilities of the clerical staff
and, to a lesser degree, other junior personnel.

lk. A second weakness ‘probably results from Subdject's consistently succesa- \
ful career, He has, without any effort on his om part, frequently if not

- Anvariably found himself closely associated with “nariageasnt" and regarded by

the “management” as being unusually talented. This has caused him to expect
his work to receive special attention which is not always warranted. When this

does not happen, he tends to pout.

5. There 4s no question in the writer's mind but what Subject would be
an outstanding addition to any office in the Agency. He has, as far as can be
seen vow, an unlimited growth potential. His minor faults will correct them-

selves with maturity and increasing experience,

1. Subject has ‘completed a two-year tour at VOB and after home leave

2. Subject’ has a notably orderly mind, unusual intelligence, and a re-
markable intercst in his work. He 15 able to handle a variety of tasks at
one time. Although Subject has had a variety of agent-handling experience,

experience and depth necessary to support his already good theoretical knowledge.

Subject 49 extremely well diceiplined porsonally. Unfortunately,and unrealis~
tically, he sometimes expects other persons to have aimilar sel(@disciplines
He also tends in other vays to disregard the human clenents ever présent in
intelligence operations. However, there 19 no question in my mind but @hat
additional experience will cure both of these very minor faults.
