Querido Amigo:
Paso a contestar tu atenta nota de fecha 2

del actual,- Rapidamente, trataré de darte un panorama de !o que

ocurre aqu{f y de algunas ideas para Ia FLAT.- Para mejor informa-

cidn tuya, te acompatio adem&s un informe sobre la situacion inter- 5

na de la CGT Argentina y algunos problemas que nos afectan muy agu-

damente a los trabajadores de esta parte de Latinoamerica.-

l= La huelga general de los obreros del puerto
lleva ya al dfa de la fecha - 53 dfas de duracidén.- A pesar de la
solidaridad que han recibido de muchos gremios y de todas las fuer~
zas populares, la situacidn de estos companeros es muy dura,- Los
motivos de la huelga los encontrards en el informe adjunto,-

La ITF ha “recomendado" el boycott interna-
cional en apoyo de los portuarios argentinos.- La medida es justa,
pero ha resultado bastante limitada ya que no todos los sindicatos
adheridos a la ITF lo han puesto en pr&ctica, ademas en-algunes lu-
gares se aplicé mal, pues se boycoteaba a los barcos argentinos, pero
no a los de otros banderas que venfan con mercaderfas de Argentina;
esto no es eficaz y se presta a maniobras turbias,- YO ESCRIBE A LA
CLASC y a la CISC pidiendo un apoyo decidido a los portuarios argen-
tinos, pero aun no hemos recibido aqu{ la documentacién sobre. las me-
didas que hayan adoptada nuestras centralas internacionales,=- aie

2.- Otro conflicto sumamente grave, es el que
enfréntamos en este momento los ferreviarios,- El gobierno ha sancio-
nado por Jey un nuevo reglamento de trabajo que nos retrotrpe@a 50
allos atraés en muchos aspectos; adem#s el plan oficial prevé Ja redu@
cidn de los 25 talleras eon 51 1f{neas de produccion que existen, a
solamente 19 tallerog con 31 1f{neas de produccion, Esto significa
RESOQUPACION y ademds, perjudica al sistema ferrevigrio y al pafs.-

. -
Es necesario prestonar a la Federacion In-
ternacional de Sindicatos Cristianos del Transporte de la CISC, y a,
las organizaciones de base de la FLAT, para que se prenuncien tambien
en este grave conflicto, crucial para eF movimiento obrero argentino,
YA QUE LA UNION FERROVTARIA ES EL. SINDICATO MAS PODEROSO DE LA AR=

GENTINA,—

3.- La CCT Argentina se ha lanzado ya a un en-) -
frentamiento abierto contra el gobierno militar de Onganfa, El proxi-
mo miorcoles 14 habra un paro general de 24 horas, como protesta con-
tra cl escandaloso aumento del costo de vida, contra el "arbitraja
obligatoria" v en apoyo do los gremios en conflicto.~

MiGROPIOMED

4y-

tengo dinero,-

A pesar de esta dificultad, he tratado de
hacer algunas tareas m{nimas: @nviar informacién a la CLASC y a
la CISC sobre log problemas del transporte que existen en Argentina,
y mantener un miyimo de cohesion y de organizacion del grupo de
Sindicalistas cristianes del transporte que actuafen mi pais.-

Lo que estoy necesitando, son las direcciones
T. En Panama no las tomé,
porqve se nos hab{a prometido una lista completa de nombres y
direcciones de todes los participantes del Congreso de CLASC; pero

de las organizaciones afiliaddas a la FLA

esto nunca llego.

5.- Estoy completament:

MENTE EL CURSO-CONGRESO DEL TRANSPORTE,-

Siempre a tus drdenes, te saluda fraternalmente,

En el aspecto interno de la FLAT, te dire”
que como secretario general, me he visto totalmente frenado por
la falta de recursos, ya que ni para imprimir papel menbretado

e ge acuerdo contigo, en la
necesidad de presionar al Bur& y al Comité Ejecutivo de CLASC, para |
que pongan en marcha las FEDERACIONES PROFESIONALES,- Tambien deberan
solucionar tu situacidh (es necesario que vengas a Latinoamerica),
proveer de algunos recursos m{nimos ala FLAT, y CONCRETAR DEFINITIVA-

“yiolent Speech on television i@ Santo Domingo he was cornered
by the Cuban (exile) delegation the members of which were in~
censed by his allegations concerning Cuban exiles and his
misinformation about the Castro regime. According to ANICE-31
their arguments prevailed and ONGARO in the end was quite
apologetic and admitted to them (AMICE-31 thought sincerely)
that he had been in error. As proof of the sincerity of
ONGARO’s change of mind on the Cuban question AMICE-31 pointed
to the fact that, on behalf of the Cuban delegation, ONGARO
approrched Juan Luis GALLO Estevez, the intransigent Uruguayan

2. ANICE-31 called ONGARO basically “un buen muchacho"
and non-Communist. He reported that ONGARO was a strong
peronista and a "good, practicing Catholic ‘added this
Yatter description with some wonderment because he had always
placed "good, practicing Catholics” automatically in the pro-
U,S., anti-Castro camp.

REF; LFGA-25587 dated 75 July 196d

Headquarters has cons:dered the invitations

received by AMICE-31 and nag veached the following
conclusions on his proposed travel:

AL

There seems no useful purpose to be served
by covering AMICE-31's personal expenses for
the trip described in paragraphs I end 2 of
the referenced dispatch 23 WOFACT has good
coverage from other sources,

Headquarters has no interest in AMICK-31's
attendance at the meeting described in
paragraph 3 but also no objections to his
accepting the invitation if Station JNWAVE
deems it advisable or considers this will be
of value in any of the Station's own
operations.

PLCO'S TRIP 59 MEDSLLIN
: After reading Pico's report and talking to hin twioo I reachod following

conclusiens

T acutzyeisyss «} Pico.

——+, Achieved with the cooperation of ager Maduro te soften the anti-Us
Line in the Declaration of Principles and elimination of US namo which

was xx replaced by “imperialisns",

2, EXCUMTEKADOLAHATHUKE Logether with the Venezuelan delegates drafted
the metion condeaning the Tricontinental Conferences and participated activly
in druming up the support for this notion,

3. Pushed thru the motion condenning Castro's regines

4, Bxcoretsed a strong cuti-cosmnist end enti-Castre Influences anong the
dologates,

“IT PICo's IVPSssstoNs OF THE MEDELLIN MEETING

1, Plco.cane back favorably impressed by strongly anti-coaminist stand of the
delegates, He saya that oven if Haspere would try to cooperate with the
comnios the rank and file will not let him to do so.

Pico noted only three rabid anti-US delegates * Miguel Canioso(Accion

Sindical Uruguayg, Diogenes Gutierrez( faderacion Istmena de Trabajadores _

Gristiancs -Panana) and Heliodore Agudelo Rivera(Accion Sindical Antioquenma) «
Ke!

2.

3 Pico informs that Henry Molina( Sec,Gen,of Confederacion Autonoma de Sindi.
Cristianos CASC-D.R.) oven 4f highly oritical of US intorventien in D.R, is
an outspoken fi¥amunist and he recomends hin as a material for recruttaente

4, Molina spoke very favorably of Conrado Rodriguos who during his stay in DR.
: : gs FORDC delegate made an-excellent-inpression and-became good friend of

CASC o

It 4s evident from tho briefing instructions received from AQ and cables
received from "our men in Medellin® that a strong opposition te CLASC 4d
atand (or Masporo's) to the now funding proposal by CISC and IST was expected.
Pico says that he could not discever auch epposition and that three national
undons vAich already applied for direct funding according th the instructions
received from CISC quickly withrew thetr application, Eico alse did not nete
any "betrayal" on the part of Foderacion Campesina.

5.

Thue I 500 two possibilities 1 a) the opposition to CLASC HQ stand that all
funding should go thru HQ was exaggerated b) Pico 49 considered as close {ucui

a “gspero and was ‘not trusted by the epposition,

i Aoconting te Pico the fooling was quite unaniaous the the funding eheuld go
ithe CLASC HQ and the CISC attezst of direut funding wao reseated a2 an effort,
jto undernine ClAIC Executive Cemitteo.

6, It looks that our friend who talked to Pico in Medellin and Bogota was
disgusted because Pico was satisfied with the results of the aeot: Picots
satisfdction stexned from the stronz anti-Yastra stand the Council adopted
and 4t ti obvious thet the fusing problem so important to us coulid not < upset

7» Pico reports that there is a good chance that Dagoberto Genzalez( Soc.Gen.of
Trabajadores Copeyanes) will be olected as CLASC president at the next CLASC
Congress, According to hin Jose Goldsack will becone Treasurer and present
treasurer Alfredo di Pacce will hoed(fiew CLASC office dedicated te raise funds
from the IA affiliates.

Pico cousiders Gonzales as a ataunch anti-conqunist and better disposed toward |
than ‘Raspero, Ke thinks that flanked by Gonzales and Gold sack, Maspero whl
not have so much to say and his power will be limited. Gonzalez is apparently &
much more forceful personality than Goldsack, who doesn't have onough gute to

oppose Maspero.

8. Pico believes that Haspero is less aggressive and anti-US as he used to be, He ~
thinks that the preSsure from CISC and ISI plus a strong anti-commnist posture
pf the affiliates accounts for this.

In the cables received from our Colombia office there is a strong criticism of
Pico as a sort of Maspere's stooge. After discussiong this topic several tines
with Pico I think that his opinion of Maspero ax#iKd is +
eduvcedad :
Maspero 4s a forceful, djmanic and well Eenean ! leader. Aaidh Argentine and
ex-peronista he has more drive and is a better organizer than the others in
CLASC, Basides he offers CLASC a promise of bringing CTG into an alliance with
them, a feat which only he can accomplish. For Pico's taste “aspere is too
domagogic and he doesn't like his anti-US and soft of comiles attitude, howevery
Pico clains that Maspero lately is much moro aware of comiie danger. As Maspero
is without douht the most powerful single individual in CLASC and as Pico positi
41s weak(his Fedsration 4s not created yot and ho has to ke confirmed as Secretar
General) he sees no use of bucking Maspere especially as no organized and strong
. Opposition exists. Pico,however, would see with sympathy “aspere power restricte
or it will not bother hin al all to see “aspero removed cozpletoly. “ut as long
as he exists Pico believes that for his personal good and in order to be able te
push strong anti-Vastre stand(in which he is mainly interested) he has te work
and live with Maspero,

This position impresses me as a sensible one.
IIT HISC, REMARKS 7

1. Thore is some Anconsistence in the cables we received, In eno of then Roaano
Tschumt, CLASC Executive Secretary for the Dutch Antilles and President of cepsy
As described as ® widely considered insignificant and unipresive element’. In
another cable this same Techunte is quoted as a source ( direct source not via
Pico as Pico said that he didn't know about campesinos sold out) and aa a new
CLASC Asst Secretary Gonoral(Pigg also claims that he deesa't know about it even
Af he was eritici89dbefore: pos an getting his info from such a lousy source

aa “schuate).

pee Jos FOU.
2. Pico reports that in Carsoas he mot Carl Norden from ISI Benn office in
CLASC office. Carlos Moris( vioe-directora of Instituto de Estudios Poclales di
Caribe}, Mariano Senitez(Centro Doqusentacion -Yaracas) Santiago Tortosa(Sec Gea
of CODRSA), Baequiol Borgoa(CI3) wore also present, Nerden reperted that the



US Eedassy in Donn informed them on Sunday Yen. t6th in the morning about.
ell isportant toipics discussed, resolutions ote adopted in Medeilin, waile
Amprossed by the fast work and correct reporting mg Nomen expressed his
curiosity as. to how it was possible that the esbassy in Bonn was so fast
Anforned ( BOTS : I an surprised yen more that # biubdber-nouth like Norden
was informed about such report!). “he general censonsus of tho present was that

: CIA sust have few mon infiltrated among the delogatesesse.

' : Je Accdrding to the new by-laws Pico's Transport Federation(in formation) will haw
a 3 votes during the next Congress, equal to other L,A, Federations and national
dolegations, Threfore it is inportant for us that we continue to work with Pico,

4, Pico should also.go to the CLASC meeting in Guatenala in March when the Central
American Confederation will be created. CLASC also wants to create Central
Anerican Transport Federation and there where Pico's presence is requested.

I asked Pico 4f his CLASC friends don't ‘resent the fact that he works for FORDC.
He said that this problea was solved once for ever. CLASC executives know that
only two principal chrrents exists aaong the Cuban exiled laber s the batistian
and the revolutionaries. the Batistianos are the Mujalistes of Cit aided by ORIT
and CLASC 1s against the Mujalistas. They are in favor of the revolutionaries an
they are in FORDC, which is the only really active exile labor organizationé,
GLASC leaders know-that FORDC is being supported by the US goverment , but they
accept it ag a necessity and understand that it is inevitable aa neither the
batistianos er the comunists will support 4t and CLASC has no funds to do so.

5.

SUING UP
aanay
By no means I consider that Pico 43 an ideal agent. He aiyht be influenced or awed
by Maspero, Ho also 4s sonetimes impulsive and puts his foot 4n the mouth. On the
other hand he 4s young, agressive, better educated than average Cuban labor load
He is accepted in CLASC, his erganization ORT is a fakk member and he will be the
head of the Latin American Transport Federation which will give him following
advantages $ a) voice and 3 votes at CLASC meetings b) can influences CLASC decisions
¢) will bring strong anti-Castro and antt-commnist influence d) will soften up
anti outbursts 9) will report to us, even if te have to take his reliability wit

a grain of salts

NOTE s I forget to call your attention to the curious Uttle item in Pico's repor

i ses that the-Copeyanes gained the control of the Sindicato Portuario 4n
Piste exbello wrestling it _ fron Correa after &t was found that 200,000
bolivares wers missing fron the treasury. Pico also reports that there aro
widespread rumors that Correa is Iiving it up at the expense of the boycott

and that he is blackmailing Spanish, Japanoso and British embassies setting hard

cash for not beyeotting the shipses

the mother of AMICE/31, a Station asset,

1 ODURGE office has stated that

1, Identity A, who is
has been twice denied permis:
refugee from Cuba. The loca

Identity. A has been placed on a denied admissions list because of
information supplied by ODACID.

2. According to AMICE/31, Identity A applied for admission to
the United States with her daughters, Identities B and C., Identi-
ties B and C received the necessary authorization on 24 February
1966 from the Swiss Embassy and arrived in the United States by air

on 28 February.

3, Identity A was the wife of Identity D, a member of the
Cuban Communist Party for some twenty years, at the time of her
first application to leave Cuba. Identity D died in October of
1668 and according to AMICE£/31 lost his Communist Party membership
card about a year prior to his death, According to AMICE/31,
Tdentity A has never joined or been a member of the Communist

Party aithough there is a possibility that her husband may have
placed her name on the membership lists. AHICE/31 also stated that
athelic and that she is very anti-
Communist. Sent as separate cover attachments are two statements
from the Bishop of Gienfuegas and the Assistant Bishop of Havana

derogatory information, is no longer a fact.
