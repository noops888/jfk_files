Propaganda. Suuject stated that the fish synbol appears

pubile tollots, bus arid train depots, park benches, etc. H1s

remark that.. "You vere always conscious of train despite the fact

that In most places they were taken down immodistoly," 1s quite

Indicative of the wido distilbution and use of the symbol. Most

of the symbols that ho saw were in chalk tather than the blue

Subject beliaves most people thourr.t the fish to be a

Christian s'mbol rather than a counter revolutionary one.

Subject had sean rany clandestine newspapers, leaflets, and

panphlets even up until the last moment of nis departuro.

Listed Avarco, Rossato, Prensa Libre, Bohemia Liore and la Marina

as periodicals he had seen.

He saw them in private homes (most

of the homes he visited were counter revolutionary). Most of tne

copies were guits "brat up," indicating. to him that they had been

passed from nand to hand.

In his opinion, people treasures the

copies that they had..

He cited the case of one virl who carried

coules in her handoag to snow to other girla in her office.

only criticism of the periodicals was that at times they becane a

little too flowery. In his words, "Inere were too many adjectives."

He thought that a more direct approach would bo inore effective.

He clains that everyoody listens to Radio Swan out nobody

ballevas it.

He mentioned one Swan broadesst which announced trat

bodies were ljing all over the Malecon and routing in the sur..

Listeners went to vlew this and found that inere were no bodly

there.

Voice of America is listened to and 13 quite highly regarded.

Susject cited two otrier oroadcasts that he congiders cour.ter

revolutionary and unich ere well thought of; one oririnites fron

New lork and one fron key lost.

He thinks that most people listen

to Miami when conditions are right.

I asked why people continug to

listen to Swan if it is so discrerited. He statod that, altrough

it is not bellered, it is still a contact with the outside vorld.

There is no gerally for listering and all people wall openly discuse

thinking?"

I asked about Americans 1n1 prison. Subject knew of only BINAIRIS

and himself.

He clained thit, althougn prison conditions were horrille

during lids slay there because of lnck of adequato food :ánd sari'lation

racilitles, the prisoners wore not phialcally abused.

Staybelung. Ratrer. than describing the net in detall, I am

attuching to this report a diagram of tne not as 1t exiitod when AMaRE)

departed. The names used are code names and are: n' record with liH/4/FI

5. Persoral sarunion of ANGel subjoct is obviously sascinated

with the intelligence usiness ard wishes to continue with us and

establish a caroer. He desires some formal training. I agreed that

he should get training and said that, whilo he 15 on vacation, we would;

try to set up some courses for him.

Subject would like to have. &

contract with us: he fears that his next assignent might ve for only

& short time and that ho will be cut loose when it is completod.

Altiousil we did not discuss it, ho quirently had in mind career

agent status.

I am not anare of Agoncy policy on assigning agents

to this status, but I bellove that we have a real asset in Mile

that consideration should be yiven to making him a career agent.

Subject's 201 shows an individual with a bactground voth of intelligence

and

experience that would indicate an assignnent in any Latin American

country. In addition, he has denonatrated a natural bent for the .

intelligence cusiness. Although his responsibility was not as great

as that of AIRYE, he nevertheless contrivuled very greatly in

establisment of the stajbehind not,

working long-hours under most

trying circunstances. His concept of tradecraft is remarkable for

a man who las only deen in this business for approximitoly nine

months.

When we

were going over the diagram.or the

staybehind net,

he was able to explain in a most lorical way the reasons for setting

1t up as 1t 15.

For axample, commurileations are erranged from

higher to lower echelons ard, only where recessary, are communications

set up both ways.

Subjoct has gainer in experience in a short

period of tire what 1t took most of us years to acquira.. It would

be a shame to let this experience to by the board.
