3. Piopadthaa Subject stated that the fish symbol appears
averywhere. de has seen. the ‘symbol in elevators, public buildings,
pudlic totlets, bus ard train depots, park benches, ete. His
remark that,."You were always conscious of tren despite the fact
that in most places they were taken down immediately," is quite
indicative of the wide distribution and use of the symbol. ‘Kost
of the symbols that fhe say were in chalk rather than the blue
stamp. Subject believes most people thouyt.t the fish to be a
Christian e-nbol rather tian a counter revolutionary one.

Subject had seen rany clandestine newspapers, leaflets, ard
panphiets even up until the last moment of hie departure, He : 3
Listed Avaree, Rescate, Prensa Libre, Bohemia Libre ond La-Marina 7
as periodicals he had. seen. le saw them in private homes (most

“of the honies he visited were counter revolutionary). Most of tne ~ te a
copies were quite "beat up," indicating’ to him that they had been . :
passed from rand to hand, In his opinion, people treasures the
copies that they had., He cited the case of one girl who carried
copies in her handoag to show to other girls in her office. fuoject's
only criticism of the periodicals was that at timas they decane a
Little too flowery. In his words, "Tnere were too many adjectives.”
He-thourht that a nore ‘Mrect approach would be more effective.

He claiuts that everyoody listens to Radio Swan out nobody

believes it, He mentioned one ‘Swan broadesst wich announced taat *

: dodies were lying all over the Malecon and rotting in the sun.
Listeners went to view this and found that tnere were no oodias
there. Voice of America is listened to and is quite highly regarded, i
Sudject cited two otcer oroadcasts that he considers courter
revolutionary und wnicn cre well thought of; one oriyinates from
New York and one from Key West, He tainks that most people listen _ |
to Miami when conditions are right. I asked way peonle continue to

individual programs.. Che militia man remarked; “Ie we. don't ‘ete

5. Rersoral. Sitvation-of- anina) | subject’ é is dbvigusiy fascinated,
with the intelligence vusiness and wishes to continue with us‘ and:
establish a-esreer. Ho desires sone formal. training. I agreed that
he should get training ard-said that, while he is on vacation, we would:
try to set up some courses for him, Subject would Tike to have.
contract with us; he. fears that his next assignnent might be for only ~
a@ short time and that he will be cut loose when it is completed.

Altiougit we did not discuss it, ne evicently had in’ mind career
agent status, I am not avare of Agency policy on assigning agents
to this status, but I'believe that we have a real asset in ANE
that consideration should be given to making him a career agent. "|
Subject's 201 shows an individual with a backgrourd voth of intelligence
and experience that would: indicate an assignnent in any Latin American .
country, In addition, he has demonstrated 4 natural bent for the
Antelligence cusiness.: Although his responsibility was not as yreat
as that of ARRYE, he nevertheless contrivuted very greatly in
stadlisnment of the staybehirid net, working long hours. under most’
trying circunstances, His*concept of tradecraft'is remarkable for
@ man who has only béen in this business for approximitely nine
months, When we were going over the diagram.of the staybehind net,

it up as it is, For example, communications are erranged from

higher to lover echelons ‘ard, only where necessary, are communications
set-up both ways. Subject has gained in experience in a short

period of tire what it took. most of us years to acnuira,. It would

be @ shame to let this experience go by the board,

6. Incidentals. Subject claims that, on the second trip that
