2022 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992

(This toMANDo BeltseD ERRaterial extracted

from CIA -controlled documents.)

When he first came into prominence as a Cuban exile

leader, Manuel Ray Rivero was described as "softspoken and

unassuming", a person of "highest intellect, sincerity and

1

conviction" - in other words, a natural leader.

In 1917,

the 23-year old Ray was granted a scholarship by the Cuban

Ministry of Public Works to study civil engineering at the

2

University of Utah.

Ray was in the United States for two

, years before returning to his native Cuba in 1949 and

obtaining various positions in the engineering field, one of

which was project manager for the construction of the

Havana Hilton Hotel. 3

Reacting to the excesses of the military iule oi

Fulgencio Batista, Ray organized the Civic Resistance Movement

in 1957 and began supervising sacotage and acts of terrorism

4

against the government.

His political posture and active

resistance to Batista was recognized by Fidel Castro who,

upon assuming control of the government of Cuba, appointed

5

Ray his Minister of Public Works

in February 1959. within a

Few months of his appointment, Ray confided to trio acti-Castro

Cubans that he had

recognized the symptoms of Conmunism- in

the Castro regime but was not prepared to conspire ainst

"El Lider Maximo."

6

Pay's

tenure in Castro's governent was short-laved.

according to one source, Ray did not leave Castro because of

ideological or policy discrepancies but rather because of a

personality clash with Castro's Minister of

Labor who almost

shot Ray after a stormy Cabinet meeting.? Another theory

about his leaving was that he opposed Castro's plan to declare

Hubert Matos a traitor and execute the Cuban revolutionary

hero with whom Ray had been associated.?

For whatever reason, Ray did continue to permit his name

to be associated with the Castro regime!" until May 1960

when he formed the Revolutionary Movement of the People (MRP)?

The MRP wassanti-Castro organization which believed that

the ideas and aims of the democratic left best suited the

needs and aspirations of the Cuban people.12 It did not wish

to reinstate the 1940 Cuban Constitution, rather it favored

continuation of the laws passed by Castro at the beginning of

his regime 3

and advocated the regulation of private investment

and nationalization of all utilities. 14 Associated with Ray

in this underground organization were Raul Chibas, Ramon

Barguin, Rogelio Cisneros, 15 Rufo Lopez Fresquet and Felipe

Pazos. 16

in each of Cuba's six provinces, the MRP was

and was supplied with explosives sent by launches from the

Florida Keys.

Having waited until May, 1960 to organize his resistance

group, Ray

was criticized as being suspiciously tardy to the

anti-Castro movement. 20 Chargés of "Fidelism without Fidel"

were made against him and the MRP because of their leftist

ideologies. 21

Perhaps for these reasons, Ray's background

Some protioreftA Cubatrolleshigesntalso expressed negative

opinions about Ray, among them DI. Jose Miro Cardona, president

of the FRD. Miro opposed Ray because he considered his

program too Marxist31 and declared that Ray was bitterly

anti-American as well as probably totalitarian in his think-

ing. 32

Manuel Artime, head of the Movimento Recuperacion

Revolucionaria (MRR), noted that Ray's group was opposed to

banning the Communist Party and in favor of "nationalizing

everything. "33 Although avare of his controversial political

philosophy, the ell continued to astively recruit day to join

the ERp?A because the White House and State Department pushed

for his inclusion. 35

Ray received full operational approval as a "political

asset" on February 7, 196136 but resisted joining the newly

formed Cuban Revolutionary Council (CRC) just as he had

resisted inclusion into

the FRD:

He said he felt the members

of the CRC were too restrained and he did not want to become

a part of a situation in which someone else was running the

show for the exiles. 37 However, Three weeks before the Bay of

Pigs invasion, ray was persuaded to join the CRC as a show of

unity 38

In recalling the events of this period, Ray told HSCA

investigators that he was avare of the fact that certain in-

fluential and wealthy Americans, among them former Ambassador

william Pawley, were opposed to him and that a lot of heavy

propaganda was hangestigrated aceusing him of being a

Conmunist. 39

Ray withdrew from the CRC shortly after the Bay of Pigs

invasion. In a Miami news conference on May 28, 1961, he said

the major reason for the MRP break with the CRC was that the

Council had failed to live up to the written promises given

it in March, outlining conditions Ray had insisted upon before

joining the organization. 40

The first condition had been that

the Council was to give first priority to the underground

fighters in Cuba during the Bay of Pigs invasion. Secondly,

Ray had insisted that anyone too closely associated with the

Batista regime would not be used in the invasion. Also, he

said, he was to have been allowed prior approval of any appoint-

ment of invasion military leaders.41 Ray told the assemblea

newsmen that his program to overthrow Castro was based on

maximum mobilization of the discontented people inside Cuba,

and that he thought the leadership of this underground should

come from Cubans who could prove they had access to such a

potential force.

42

Ray sought CIA support for the MRP independent of the

Council, 43 claiming that the group had an effective underground

organization but needed material and financial support.

44 Ray

felt the MRP had to be allowed to plan its own operations and

broaden its base of financial support to include sympathetic

Latin American governments. 15 He was totally opposed to another

CIA headquarters was immediate: Within 24 hours a Memo Fo

the record was circulated, objecting to the Miami stationis

recommendation and claiming that Ray did not ever produce any

substantial military actions against Castro.48 Ray was told

to submit a "prospectus" of his plans for the MRP and advised

& that no financial help would be forthcoming until such a plan.

was reviewed. 49

Ray went to Puerto Rico about July, 1961, where he

received sympathetic support for the MRP from the Governor

of that island, Luis' Munoz Marin, who personally liked Ray, 50

While Ray was in Puerto Rico, a member of the MRP underground

in Cuba reported to the MRP Exécutive Council that he had been

in contact vith the CIA and was told by the Ageney that no

material resources would be available for the group until

Manuel. Ray was dismissed as general coordinator 51 Charging

the CEA

with repeated interference in the affairs of the MRP,

Ray resigned so that there wouldn't be any obstacle to the

group's cohesion. 52

In October, 1961, the Puerto Rican Planning Board an-

nounced that Ray had accepted a $12,000-a-year position as

consultant to that Board. 53

Although there was no evidence

that the Puerto Rican goveinment was supporting the MRP, Ray

was looked upon with great favor by Puerto Rican officials 54

filtration plans were known throughout the Miami Cuban exile

community.

Soon the story spread to Cuba where Castro ordered

a full-scale military alert and rounded up scores of suspected

79

Ray supporters.

After several days of bad weather and dodging Cuban patrol

boats, Ray and his crew of seven,

including a reporter-

from LIFE magazine,

81 landed at the :

82

Anguilla Cays, 40 miles off the Cuban coast.

There Ray

intended to make a final equipment check and a final radio

transmission.

Because of their proximity to Cuba, the Anguilla Cays

were heavily patrolled by Castro forces and by the British who

84

owned them.

The British discovered Ray and his group and

their cache. of weapons

and explosives, arrested them for illegal

entry into the Bahamas and took them to Nassau.

85 The minimal

fine of $14 was levied on each member of the group and each

was admonished to never tresspass again.

Upon his release, Ray said that he was as determined as

ever to infiltrate Cuba: "Fidel knows me," he said, "and he

knows I'm comina" 8y
