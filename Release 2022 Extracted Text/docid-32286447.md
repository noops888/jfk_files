advised that the owner of this residence came and went fro
Cuernavaca at odd times and-at odd hours. She stated that
he had’a bank account at the Banco Nacional, Cuernavaca,
She noted that he received numerous phone calls. She de-
scribed the house as luxuriously furnished as if done b
an interior decorator to whom expense was no object.

On September 20, 1967, a representative of the
Mexican Immigration Department, advised that investigation
at Nubes Number 2 leads the Mexican Government to the
definite conclusion that it was GIANCANA who was residing
at Nubes Number 2 in Cuernavaca, and arrangements have bee:
made by the Mexican Government so that if h _ returns,
GIANCANA will be detained and déported. we

CG T-5 advised that he learned during. the latter
part of September, 1967, from a top leader of organized

CG T-6 advised that he has heard from leaders
of organized crime in Chicago that RICHARD CAIN: has pur-
chased a large home in Columbia or Peru, and intended to
move there shortly, This informant stated that he knows, that
CAIN iS very close to SAM GIANCANA and he therefore suspects
that if CAIN purchased a large home, that home is probably
GIANCANA's, This informant.stated that CAIN is a very vicious ;
man who allegedly has killed four or five people,) |

CG T-7 advised in early November, 1967, that he
has received information from a close relative of GIANCANA
that as of that time, GIANCANA continues to reside outside
of the United States. The informant gained the impression
that this location was-in Mexico. The informant stated that
the relative of GIANCANA indicated that the reason for
GIANCANA's continued’ absence’ from the United States is his
belief that he will again be subpoenaed before the Federal
Grand Jury and offered immunity. |) - ce
