1. AMHIDDY-I was debriefod on his rolationa tita P'RIO, As soon

as our notes havo bean procensed, tho text of his remator on the subjoct will

Do forwarded. Suffice it to uay that A-1 has no underatanding with and no

rospoct for PRIO. He would, however, accept PRIO'& monoy, with no atringo

astached, on the theory that it lo Cuban proporty returnod to its sightdul

custodian, 1.d.. AMbIDDY-l.

2. Ao HQS sees it, PRIO's main role le ono of crealing a pulsanco

and of rendering A-l'a political probloma in Nicaragus alightly moro com-

plicated. Il WAVE can den a cocuro means of putting a spoke la PRIO's

wheels, In efforte along those lines would is appreciated, it would fiaspably

suffice to drop somo hintu to tho alfect that responsiblo sad compotent

observora vior PRIO as a hau-been and raílin lo tako his leadership

aspirations serloualy.

For Moxico Station:

May we request that you air the above

thome in a widely read column, making the following pointa:

Allude to reports that PRIO and BRACERB-I and

ERACORN -I have Inached an undorstanding whereby IRis sill

be secomiced as loador of the rosintarco against Cura.

b. Hay BRACERB-l and ERACORN-1 the loli-hsaded

compliment thai thoy are unlikely to hitch their wagon to the

vaniahlag star of PIuo.

c. Suggeat that PIlO could render one vital contribution,

viz, cough up anme of the milliuno ho stole from the Cuban peoplo

while president.

As for tho rest, he should lapse into silence

and lot respectabie people do the job.
