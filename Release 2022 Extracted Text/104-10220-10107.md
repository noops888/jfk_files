1, AMBIDDY-1 was debriefed on his relations with PRIO, As soon
‘as our notes have been processed, the text of his remalkif on the subject will
be forwarded. Suffice it to say that A-1 has no understanding with and no
respect for PRIO. He would, however, accept PRIO's money, with no strings
attached, on the theory that it 4s Cuban property returned to its rightful

custodian, i.e., AMBIDDY-1.

2, Av HOS sees it, PRIO's main role fe one of creating a nuisance
and of rendering A-1's political problema in Nicaragua alightly more com-
plicated. If WAVE can cee a secure means of putting a spoke in PRIO's
wheels, ite efforts along those lines would bo appreciated, It would patpably
suffice to drop some hints to the effect thet responsible and competent
observers viow PRIO as 8 hau-been and refuse to take his leadership

a
aspirations aeriously.

3. Fox Mexico Station: May we request that you air the above
theme in a widely read column, making the following pointa:

a. Allude to reports that PRIO aad BBACERB-I and ©
ERACORN-I have reached an undorstanding whereby RIG vill
be eecognized au leader of the resistance against Cuba.

b. Pay BRACEKB-I and ERACORN-I the left-handed
compliment that they are unlikely to hitch thelr wagon to the
vanishing stax of PRIG.

c. Suggest that PRIO could render one vital contribution,
viz. cough up aame of the milllung ho stole from the Cuban people
while president, As for tho rest, he should lapae inte stlence
and lst respectable peaple do the job.

d. Stato that some of PRiO's henchmen have been dropping
hinte to the effect that he has ODEARL bucking. Express the view
that, without being privy to ODEARL views, it would be sur-
prising ludeed wore PRIO considered by anyone in leading ODYOKE
position anything but a painful reminder that abuves of public trust
had something to do with the success of Castro's revolution.

e. Ploase forward clippings to Managus, WAVE and HOS
for replay. :
