MEMORANDUM.

_ PROM 3 Davia W. Belin
SUBJECT : Conference with McGeorge Bundy, April 8, 1975.

Mr, Belin: This is a memorandum of a conference with McGeorge
Bundy on April 8, 1975. Mr. Bundy has refreshed

his recollection following, his testimony before the Commission on’

April 7 and wishes to make some additions to the record.

Mr. Bundy: You asked me yesterday whether I had any recollection
of whether the word "poison" or something to that
effect--whether I had any recollection of that kind of activity
or proposal in relation to the Castro regime and I think I said
I did not, and I did not as of yesterday. But overnight I have
had a vague recollection which I cannot pinpoint in time that
there was discussion that I knew about at some time of a proposal
or scheme or project that did involve poison, and, as I recall
it, the characteristic that sticks in my memory is the--that
it involved a rather large-scale use of poison and, as I recollect
it, it was never approved. In the first instance on that practic
ground and I think the second question whether it would have been 2
approved, if it had been less hairbrained, was never reached.
And this is; I think, the way in which proposals of this sort,
which did come from time to time, not just with respect to
assassinations but other proposals under the MONGOOSE scheme,
they were reviewed in the first instance for practicability
and I don't--and only then after that for wisdom or political
xightness, and I recall NO proposal for liquidation that ever
got past the first stage to the second.

Mr. Belin: I also talked to you, Mr. Bundy, about‘whether or

not there might have been any discussion in early 1961
or any other time! with regard to a request from the White
House to the CIA for the CIA to develop what was called an
executive action capability, which was defined as a general
stand-by capability to carry out assassinations when required.
Do you ever remember any discussions along those lines?

Mr. Bundy: Well, I recall the words “executive action

capability" more clearly today than I did yesterday,
and I think I said yesterday that they rang some sort of bell.
But I do NOT have any recollection as to when I knew about that
or who requested it or how much was done under it. I don't
recall having any continuing interest in or information about
that particular activity.

Mr. Belin: Do you recall that executive action capability was

in substance discussed as a general stand-by.
capability to carry out assassinations at that time--I'm not
saying there was direction to undertake a plan but at least
the development of the stand-by capability?

Mr. Bundy: I think it was just that--an authorization to have
some kind of stand-by capability for action against

individuals.

Mr, Belin: Now, I'm going to turn to the Summer of 1962. Before

we started this transcribing of your remarks you

indicated that you don't remember any specific plan pertaining to

attempted poisoning of any Cuban leader during 1961, but that you

do remember some discussions that may have-developed into this
area sometime in 1962, Is that accurate?

i Mr. Bundy: Well, I think it is perhaps a slightly more precise
way of saying it is that you have described to me

a broad outline of plans as you understand them that existed in
January or February 196] and I simply have no recollection of
plans that meet that description. You don't have one mind to
believe--and I believe my memory tells me in a more general way
that my knowledge of a scheme or idea of using poison relates to
the year 1962. .

Mr. Belin: Do you remember any discussions at any meeting of the

MONGOOSE group where this might have been discussed?
Either the general plan of possible liquidation or the particular
plan of poison?

Mr. Bundy: I don't have any recollection of where. or how I heard

about the poisoning--a poisoning plan. I know that--
at least I know that I never knew of any approval of such a plan.
My recollection is the opposite-+that it was a hairbrain scheme
that did not receive approval even on the ground of practicability
as distinct from the ground of what you would make a final de-
cision to go ahead. Now, as to meetings where such a thing might
have been discussed, the only one I have any recollection of--and
it is a refreshed recollection--I would not have known about it ‘
a month ago--is the one which’ we discussed yesterday on August 10,
1962 and I do NOT have any recollection of what specifically was
said in that meeting. : .

NW 64578 Docld:32105632 Page 3


Mr. Belin: Do you have any recollection that there was any
direction NOT to undertake any such plans?

Mr. Bundy: I think there was--there was--a general attitude
toward this matter in which the Agency was permitted
to produce proposals and, although I recall nobody encouraging
them to do so, that may have happened, and as I said yesterday,
I draw a distinction between considering contingencies of this
sort and actually giving them approval. That I think is the way
in which the Kennedy Administration approached the matter. I
do not think there was a flat, general ban on considering such
possibilities.

Mr. Belin: Earlier, before we started taping, you said that if
there had been any spedific discussion of that, that
you were not a party to it and that it might have--

Mr. Bundy: A discussion of what?

of a direction to carry out a plan, that ‘you certainl:
were not a party to such a discussion. Is that what
you said?

Mr. Belin:

Mr. Bundy: I am absolutely certain that I never knew of or

believed that there was any authorization to go
ahead with an effort to liquidate Castro, or any other Cuban
leader.

Mr. Belin: And I think that you also said that if there would

have been any such discussion and you said you knew
of none, it would have been directly between the President and
the Director of Central Intelligence~-

Mr. Bundy: THAT's an inference. I don't know where else--who
else--would have sought the authority of the Agency
or who else could have given it from the White House.

Mr. Belin: Is there anything else that you want to add so far
as clarifying or correcting your testimony of
April 7 before the Commission? .

Mr. Bundy: You asked me yesterday whether I had met Mr. William
Harvey--I think ‘that's his name-~

Mr. Belin: Yes.
Mr, Bundy: --and I said I recollected the name and that I
thought I had seen him in large meetings. I can check
my appointment calendar which is the only document I have of
record from my Washington days and see whether I met him in
smaller meetings or alone if that would be helpful to you.

Mr. Belin: It would. I'd like to have you do it, please.

Mr. Bundy: Fine.

Mr. Belin: OK. Well, thank you very much.
