RE: Foreign Government Liaison

Dear John:

This morning, Jack Tunheim, Phil Golrick, and I met with Kenneth Duncan and several

State Department representatives regarding how best to implement the JFK Act as to

information obtained from foreign governments through liaison channels. We had a

very constructive discussion of the affirmative role the State Department could play in

encouraging foreign governments, through appropriate diplomatic channels, to agree to

the release of such information pursuant to the JFK Act. The Review Board believes

that Section 10(b)(2) of the JFK Act contemplates that the State Department play

precisely such a role.

As for now, we will hold in abeyance requests for evidence on foreign liaison

postponements to which the FBI has not yet responded. This will give us the

opportunity in the near future to work with the State Department and the FBI to

establish orderly procedures to persuade the foreign governments in question that it is

in our countries'

mutual interests to release liaison information in assassination records.

Until such procedures are in place, we request that the FBI not make further contact

with foreign law-enforcement or other government officials regarding the release of

liaison information in assassination records.

Memo re Mexican Liaison (S)

CL BY 2224130:

CL REASON 1.5 (d)

DECL ON X1

DRV FM LIA 3-82

The following is a draft memo for Jeff. Bob Caudle is looking at it now so there may be more changes. Please let me know if there is

anything incorrect here. I have a feeling Jeff will want a meeting with me rather than just the memo. Also, knowing him, he may want

to deal with Tunheim on this directly since he was involved in this. I will let you know.

1. Action: That you advise as per paragraph 7.

2.

Background: You will recall that you spoke with

Chairman Tunheim of the JFK Board about the attached cable and

the importance of protecting the phrase "with Mexicans" because

it gives away liaison involvement in a tel-tap operation.

At

its 16 April meeting, at which I was present, the Board

reconsidered its initial decision, but determined that the phrase

could be released.

3. It had just come to HRG's attention that this same

cable was released in full by the Board, with no objection by

CIA, In September 1995. CIA probably did not contest this

release because an excerpt from this cable, containing the phrase

at issue, had been inadvertently released

is therefore, longer possible a c

•It

protection of this phrase in the current cable or

o appeal this rerease to the White House• Ito The National Archives In !Tue 9.

4.

CIA is now in somewhat of an embarrassing position

because it has strenuously argued that the release of this phrase

would cause "clear and convincing damage" to the national

security only to find that this phrase has been released with CIA

acquiescence for at least seven months, with no ostensible damage.

Conceivably, the Board could see this incident as a justification

of their second-guessing our damage assessments, and could give

us a much more difficult time in the future.

5.

On the other hand, CIA could use this situation as a

way to highlight the problems HRG has had with the JFK review

process - that documents are being reviewed and released to the

National Archives in such quantity and speed that it is difficult

for CIA to focus on any one document and, more importantly, how

seemingly innocuous information in one document can actually be

quite significant in relation to prior or subsequent releases.

Since September, when this cable was originally

released, the

issue of protecting Mexican liaison has become increasingly

important because of other releases on this subject and because

of your appearance before the Board in February.

6.

Furthermore, this prior release should not impair our

ability to continue to protect the fact of Mexican involvement in

this tel-tap operation.

AT though we have taed is ine Board aluster

should be

was the very fact that the cable did NOT directly state that the

Mexican/sawere.involvedwin the tel-tap.

We should be able to use

their arguments to continue to protect

the liaison relationship.

7.

Our only recourse is to acknowledge to the Board that

CIA has no basis to bring an appeal to the President since this

cable has already been released in full.

We should, however,

maintain our position that we believe this information is

damaging especially in light of releases to National Archives

since september, and that we never would have acquiesced to the

release in September if we knew then what would be released on

we know chen what woe

this subject in the ensuing months.

Although this message does

not necessarily need to be conveyed by you to Tunheim and could

be handled by John Pereira and David Marwell, given your past

dealings with the Board on this issue, you may prefer to do this.

In order to avoid problems like this in the future, HRG

is immediately dedicating several personnel to the task. of

that there is only

searches about our releases on specific subjects. Although HRG

personnel

are extremely knowledgeable on what has been released,

with over

220,000. CIA documents currently in the collection, it

is suprising that mistakes like this have not happened

President to agree to the unilateral declassification of foreign

government information, CIA proposes that the release of the

documents be either postponed for a short time or that

a substitution be made.

3. (U) Legal Authorities: The procedures governing the

declassification and dissemination of foreign government

information are set out in Executive Order 12958, as well as

Director of Central Intelligence Directives (DCIDs). Executive

Order 12958 defines foreign government information as including

(1) intormation provided by a loreign government, or any element

thereof, with the expectation, expressed or implied, that the

information and/or the source of the information, are to be held

in confidence; or (2) information produced by the United States

pursuant to or as a result of a joint arrangements with a foreign

government, or any element thereof, requiring that the

information, the arrangements, or both, are to be held in

confidence. Id.,

at §1.1(d)

Foreign government information is subject to a

classification determination under E.O. 12958, section 1.5(c).

When so classified, U.S. government agencies

• are obligated to

protect that information from unauthorized disclosure.

The E.O.

requires that foreign government information shall either retain

its original classification or be assigned a U.S. classification

that shall ensure a degree of protection at least equivalent to

that

required by the entity that furnished the information. Id.,

at 1.7(e). Furthermore, agencies are required to safeguard

foreign government information under standards that provide a

degree of protection at least equivalent to that required by the

originating government. Id., at 4.2(g) .

5. (U) Pursuant to his authority as head of the

intelligence community to protect all classified information from

unauthorized disclosure, the Director of Central Intelligence has

Issued Directives (that 1s, DCIDs) setting out the procedures for

he declassification and dissemination of foreign government

information.

Intelligence obtained from another government or

from a combined effort with another government, may not be

released or authorized for release without its

consent. DCID 5/6

Furthermore,

the release of intelligence that

the U.S. and the foreign government whose interests are involved.

DCID 1/10-1.

7. (U) National Security Considerations: The importance of

such coordination with foreign governments prior to the release

of their information cannot be overemphasized.

Should CIA, or

for that matter any (USG) agency fail to coordinate where

required, not only would it be a violation of the aforementioned

E.0. and

directives, but it would chill relationships it has

developed with foreign services over the years.

If such lack of

coordination became known, foreign services would hesitate to

share crucial intelligence information with CIA if they believed

it would be released, in spite of any agreements or U.S. laws to

the contrary, without their consent. Furthermore, the U.s. could

not expect foreign services to safeguard U.S. government

information that it shares with its liaison partners in order to

pursue authorized intelligence and foreign policy objectives.

8. 18) According to its legal obligations described herein,

CIA coordinates the dissemination and/or release of foreign

government information.

Its obligation to do so is similar to

its obligation to coordinate declassification efforts with

another USG agency should the CIA possess any of that agency's

documents.

For example, CIA could not declassify and release to

the public FBI information located in CIA files without

coordinating with that

information in its files.

Re:

Request to CIA to contact liaison channels regarding LIENVOY intercepts of

Oswald telephone calls in Mexico City

1. During vou

recent visit here we discussed with you the feasibility of your making such contacts. I

am writing in response to your request that we memorialize our request and provide

some background information.

The Review Board believes that all reasonable steps should be taken to account for all

telephonic intercepts of Oswald during his visit to Mexico City in September-October

1963. T'here is evidence that ClA intercepted some telephone calls through an operation

named LIENVOY conducted jointly with components of the Mexican government. We

believe thatit would be appropriate for CIA to contact directly _

to inquire as to whether the Mexican authorities retained copies of LIENVOY

telephonic take, specifically the actual recordings of Oswald's telephone calls to the

Soviet Embassy during the period of September 27 through October 3, 1963.

The Review Board previously has sought information from the Mexican Government

through appropriate diplomatic channels. For reasons that are obvious to those

familiar with Mexico City issues, the Review Board could not raise with Mexican

officials nor with the U.S. State Department the possible existence of additional tape

recordings that might be in the hands of certain officials. Thus, at the behest of the

Review Board, the Department of State requested that the Mexican federal government

and local government agencies conduct general searches of their files for records

related to the assassination of President Kennedy. The Mexican government responded

by sending copies of the same documentation and correspondence that the GOM had

made available to the Warren Commission in 1964.

The basis for our interest in your contacting appropriate Mexican officials is found in

CIA document 104-10004-10199, which was reviewed by the Board on September 19,

1995. On page 5 of this document (not including the cover sheet) information that the

Board agreed to protect, due to the sensitivity of sources and methods involved,

suggests that the Mexican security forces may have had their own copy of the October 1

intercept on Lee Harvey Oswald. It is unclear whether this statement refers to the

transcript or to an actual tape containing the phone call. Nevertheless, it provides

enough evidence to warrant additional inquiries on this matter.

For your reference we are enclosing copies of the reference documents as well as copies

of the correspondence between the DOS and the Mexican government.

We would appreciate your contacting appropriate officials to determine what

reasonably can be known about this and related matters, and ask that you provide a

response to this request by November 14, 1997. We are fully aware of the sensitivity of

this type of request and do not wish to take any action that would compromise existing

intelligence operations. If necessary, we would be pleased to discuss with you ways in

which we might further elaborate on this request, including person-to-person

discussions with appropriate officials either here or in Mexico.

Thank you for your continued assistance and cooperation.

Sincerely yours,

uple for

ARRB 22 January Meeting -- Agenda

OFFICE:

SUBJECT:

REFERENCE:

1. The following items are on the ARRB meeting agenda for 22 January 1998:

A. Reconsideration of the

_ The ARRB staff has advised that briefings by senior CIA anc

dare

not required. However, the Agency_

are welcome to make a presentation if it will add to the information being presented in the

"evidence memorandum". The evidence memorandum must be at ARRB no later than Tuesday 20 January. Mr. Gunn has suggested

we may want to have individuals standing by for questions. The current plan is for Lee Strickland and me to be available at 600 E. St.

NW. to answer any questions.

(AIUO) B. Office of Personnel Files in the Sequestered Collection (Microfilm). The ARRB staff will recommend to the Board that

personnel files be declared NBR (Not Believed Relevant) and their release postponed until 2017. The Agency position is that the privacy

of each individual clearly outweighs the public interest, most of the information in these files has no relevance to the assassination story,

and any related information exist elsewhere in the collection. At ARRB staff request HRP is preparing five OP files for review by Board

members. The ARRB staff will prepare a memorandum for public release describing the files; their memo will be coordinated with the

Agency prior to release.

(AIOU) C. Non-related files/documents in the Sequestered Collection (Microfilm). The ARRB staff will recommend that the files

and documents (approximately 35,000 pages) designated non-related by CIA during the 1994 review of the microfilm be declared NBR

and released in 2017. If the recommendation is accepted by the Board, the ARRB staff will prepare an unclassified description of the

records for public release. This too will be coordinated with the Agency prior to release.

D. Other possible items:

(AIUO)

i. ARRB Request # CIA 1 ... The ARRB staff may request that the DO documents at issue in this request be

declared Assassination Records to be released in full or sanitized form.

(S)

ii. Crypt LINLUCK - ARRB staff did not find our evidence memo on this crypt persuasive. They are expected to

recommend that the Board reaffirm its decision to release.

iii. 1967 IG report on "Castro Assassination Plots" - ARRB has requested that an updated version be released to NARA by

the end of January. Any disagreements between the Agency and ARRB staff may be added to the

agenda. HRP and

DO reviewers are currently re-reviewing the report.
