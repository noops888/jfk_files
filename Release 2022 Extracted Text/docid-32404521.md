RE: Foreign Government Liaison
Dear John:

This morning, Jack Tunkeim, Phil Golrick; and I met with Kenneth Duncan and several
State Department representatives regarding how best to.implement the JFK Act:as to
information obtained from foreign governments through liaison channels. We had a
very constructive discussion of the affirmative role the State Department could play in
encouraging foreign governments, through appropriate diplomatic channels, to agree to
the release of such information pursuant to the JFK Act. The Review Board, believes
that Section 10(b)(2) of the JEK “Act contemplates that the Stat Department play ..
precisely such.a’fole. i es EI i

As-for now, wé will hold in abeyancé requests for evidence on foreign liaison
postponements to which: the FBI has not yet responded: ‘This‘will give us the
opportunity in the near future to work with the State Department and the FBI to, :
establish orderly procedures to persuade the foreign governments in question that it is
in our countries’ mutual interests to releasé liaison information in assassination records.
Until such procedures are’in place;:we request that the FBI not make further contact
with foreign law-enforcement or other government officials regarding the release of
liaison information in assassination records.

DRV ‘FM LIA 3-82

The following is a draft memo for Jeff. -Bob Caudle is looking at it now so there may be more changes. Please let me know if there is
anything incorrect here, I have a feeling Jeff will want a meeting with me rather than just the memo. Also, knowing him, he may want
to deal with Tunheim on this directly since he was involved in this. { will let you know.

ace Action: That you advise as per paragraph 7.

2. Background: You will recall that you spoke with
Chairman Tunheim of the JFK Board about the attached cable and
the importance of protecting the phrase s!with Mexicans" because
it gives away ‘liaison involvement in a tel-tap operation. At
its 16 April meeting, at which I was present, the Board
reconsidered its initial decision, but determined that the phrase
could be released.

3. It had just come to HRG's attention that this same
cable was released in full by the Board, with no objection by
CIA, in September 1995. CIA probably did not contest this
release because an excerpt from this cable, containing the phrase
at issue, had been inadvertently released ven-priortethat. It
is,. therefore, no longer possible for CIA to argue before the
Board for the protection of this phrase in(the current cable or

to appeal this release to the White House. to “Phe Nehonal Arches in Aug 3

4. CIA is now in somewhat of an embarrassing position
because it has strenuously argued that the release of this phrase
would cause "clear and convincing damage" to the national
security only to find that this phrase has been released with CIA
acquiescence for at least seven months , wt i .
Conceivably, the Board could see this incident as a justification
of their second-guessing our damage assessments, and could give
us a much more difficult time in the future.

NW 65360 Docld:32404521 Page 7


oct i : SCR

5. On the other hand, CIA could use this situation as a
way to highlight the problems HRG has had with the JFK review
process - that documents are being reviewed and released to the
National Archives in such quantity and speed that it is difficult
for CIA to focus on any one document and, more importantly, how
seemingly innocuous information in one document can actually be
quite significant in relation to prior or subsequent releases.
Since September, when this cable was originally released, the
issue of protecting :Mexican liaisén has become increasingly
important because of other releases on this subject and because
of your appearance before the Board in February.

6. Furthermore, this prior release should not impair our
ability to continue to protect the fact of Méxican involvement’.in

a, the Board's insistence that this phrase should be released
“thats. the cable did NOT directly state that the

we ‘ thestel+tap:. We should be able to use

their arguments to continue to protect the liaison relationship.

7. Our only recourse is to acknowledge to the Board that
CIA has no basis to bring an appeal to the President since this
cable has already been released in full.. We should, however,
maintain our position that we believe this - information. vis
damaging especially in light of releases to National Archives

and that we never would have acquiesced to the

release in September if we knew then what would be released on
this subject in the ensuing months. Although this message does
not necessarily need to be conveyed by you to Tunheim and could
be handled by John’ Pereira and David Marwell, given your past
dealings with the Board on this issue, you may prefer to do this.

8. In order to avoid problems like this in the future, HRG
is immediately dedicating several personnel to the task of

personnel are extremely knowledgeable on what has been released,

" SUBJECT: Foreign Government Information

President to agre the unilateral declassification of foreign
i tation, CIA. proposes that the release of the
lfocuments be either postponed for a short time or that
a substitution be made.

3. (U) Legal Authorities: The procedures governing the
declassification and dissemination of foreign government
information are set out in Executive Order 12958, as well as
Director of Central Intelligence Directives (DCIDs). Executive
Order 12958 defines foreign government information as including
(1) information provided by a foreign government, or any element
thereof, with the expectation, expressed or implied, that the
information and/or the source of the information, are to be held
in confidence; or (2) information produced by the United States
pursuant to or as a result of a joint arrangements with a foreign
government, or any element thereof, requiring that the
information, the arrangements, or both, are to be held in
confidence. Id., at §1.1(d) 7

4. (U) Foreign government information is subject to a
classification determination under E.O. 12958, section 1.5(c).
When so classified, U.S. government agencies are obligated to
protect that information from unauthorized disclosure. The E.O.
requires that foreign government information shall either retain
its original classification or be assigned a U.S. classification
that shall ensure a degree of protection at least equivalent to
that required by the entity that furnished the information. Id.,
at 1.7(e). Furthermore, agencies are required to safeguard
foreign government information under standards that provide a
degree of protection at least equivalent to that required by the
originating government. Id., at 4.2(g).

5. (U) Pursuant to his authority as head of the
intelligence community to protect all classified information from
unauthorized disclosure, the Director of Central Intelligence has
issued Directives (that is, DCIDs) setting out the procedures for
the declassification and dissemination of foreign government
information. Intelligence obtained from another government or
from a combined effort with another government, may not be
released or authorized for release without its consent. DCID 5/6

attachment § C.3. Furthermore, the release of intelligence that
would be contrary to agreements between the U.S. and foreign
countries is expressly prohibited. Id., at uoe

6. (U) Finally, the very fact of intelligence cooperation
between the U.S. and specifically named foreign countries and
government components is classified SECRET unless a different
classification is mutually agreed upon. DCID 1/10-1. Such
information may be declassified only with the mutual consent of
the U.S. and the foreign government whose interests are involved.

the U.S. and the foreign government whose interests are involved.

DCID 1/10~1.
7. (U) National Security Considerations: The importance of

such coordination with foreign governments prior to the release
of their information cannot be overemphasized. Should CIA, or
for that matter any (USG) agency fail to coordinate where
required, not only would it be a violation of the aforementioned
E.O. and directives, but it would chill relationships it has
developed with foreign services over the years. If such lack of
coordination became known, foreign services would hesitate to
share crucial intelligence information with CIA if they believed
it would be released, in spite of any agreements or U.S. laws to
the contrary, without their consent. Furthermore, the U.S. could
not expect foreign services to safeguard U.S. government
information that it shares with its liaison partners in order to
pursue authorized intelligence and foreign policy objectives.

8. eas According to its legal obligations described herein,
CIA coordinates the dissemination and/or release of foreign
government information. Its obligation to do so is similar to
its obligation to coordinate declassification efforts with
another USG agency should the CIA possess any of that agency's
documents. For example, CIA could not declassify and release to
the public FBI information located in CIA files without
coordinating with that agency. Similarly, CIA has no authority
to unilaterally declassify foreign government documents or
information in its files.

15. (S) ‘Proposal for Future Coordination: With regards to

any other foreign government information that may exist in the

would be appropriate to do so. Although recent events with
Australia make it impossible for CIA to approach them at this
time, this may not be so with other services. In cases were CIA
believes, because of the nature of the relationship, that it
would not be possible to request the consent of the service, CIA
proposes that the documents either be postponed from release or
that CIA and Board's staff coordinate a summary.

Dear David:

This is to acknowledge your letter of 3 January 1997 to the
Director of Central Intelligence concerning the Assassination

Records Review Board’s recent formal determinations with respect
to CIA Records.

The appropriate Agency components have again reviewed the
documents that the Board has decided to release either totally or
with some information postponed. While the Agency does not plan
to appeal to the President for additional postponements at this
time, we ask that the Board reconsider its decisions with respect
to six documents. These documents contain information relating to
foreign government provided data, foreign liaison relationships
and intelligence sources--information that we believe merits
protection under current standards set by the Board. A list of
these six documents, together with Agency, comments concerning
them, is enclosed.

We plan no further action on these documents pending
discussion with your staff and review by the Board.

Re: Request to CIA to contact liaison chgfnels regarding LIENVOY intercepts of

juested informally that CIA contact its liaison

recent visit here we discussed With you the feasibility of your making such contacts. I
am writing in response to your request that we memorialize our request and provide
some background information.

Some time ago the Review Board r
channels in Mexico City for info:

The Review Board befieves that all reasonable steps should be taken to account for all
telephonic intercepts of Oswald during his visit to Mexico City)in September-October
1963. There is evidence that CIA intercepted some telephone calls through an operation

The Review Board previously has sought information from the Mexican Government
through appropriate diplomatic channels. For reasons that are obvious to those
familiar with Mexico City issues, the Review Board could not raise with Mexican
officials nor with the U.S. State Department the possible existence of additional tape
recordings. that might be in the hands of certain officials. Thus, at the behest of the
Review Board, the Department of State requested that the Mexican federal government
and local government agencies conduct general searches of their files for records
related to the assassination of President Kennedy. The Mexican government responded

by sending copies of the same documentation and correspondence that the GOM had
made available to the Warren Commission in 1964.

The basis for our interest in your contacting appropriate Mexican officials is found in
CIA document 104-10004-10199, which was reviewed by the Board on September 19,
1995. On page 5 of this document (not including the cover sheet) information that the
Board agreed to protect, due to the sensitivity of sources and methods involved,
suggests that the Mexican security forces may have had their own copy of the October 1
intercept on Lee Harvey Oswald. It is unclear whether this statement refers to the
transcript or to an actual tape containing the phone call. Nevertheless, it provides
enough evidence to warrant additional inquiries on this matter.

For your reference we are enclosing copies of the reference documents as well as copies
of the correspondence between the DOS and the Mexican government.

We would appreciate your contacting appropriate officials to determine what — | >-~
reasonably can be known about this and related matters, and ask that you provide a

“This type of request and do not wish to take any action that would compromise existing
intelligence operations. If necessary, we would be pleased to discuss with you ways in
which we might further elaborate on this request, including person-to-person
discussions with appropriate officials either here or in Mexico.
