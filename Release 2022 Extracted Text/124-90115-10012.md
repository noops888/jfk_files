Gibson advised that during ‘the course of a normal

sub-leased SCI space. They stay during the course of an.
entire day without leaving the space. and do not seem to
conduct business in a normal manner.» An unidentified
friend of Gibson's overheard individuals in the space,
allegedly leased by DEA, discussing "tapes." Based on the
%. above information and based on Gibson's experience with
~. Wiretapping while employed with the Cobb: County, Georgia,

Sheriff's Office, Gibson believes a wiretapping operation
was being conducted in the space allegedly sub-leased- by

DEA from SCI. u
