The informant recalled that SPINELLI was a non-drinker.whohad
been. born and raised in Italy and still had 2 wife and two
children. living there. He described SPINELLI as about 614"
in-height-and. said that. he was known in the area as a professional !

SPINELLI was. crossed. up. in some manner by the VOLPE brothers in
connection with some stills he owned personally, he became so
enraged. that he vowed: he would kill all three. The informant
stated that he was with SPINELLI when SPINELLI. obtained the
weapon with which he killed the VOLPEs and left a. moonshine
joint without saying where: he was going. He said.he later.
heard:.the.details of the shooting from by~standers whe told
him that:.SPINELLI. had encountered the three VOLPE brothers’.
eating breakfast at Bazzanno's Restaurant on Wylie Avente »
Pittsburgh, at which time he gunned them to death. :

The informant “recalled that SPINELLI gathered his few personal
belongings together and immediately fled to New York where he
encountered the brother of the BAZZANNO who can the Pittsburgh
restaurant. He stated that SPINELLI killed this individual

and: that the newspapers related that BAZZANN® was discovered
with more than'150 ice pick holes.in him and various sections

of’ his body cut off. He recalled. that i fled to
Ttaly.and had nerve enough to settle with his family in the same
tewn in which the elder VOLPE was an official. He recalled that
the elder VOLPE was then responsible for having SPINELLI sentenced
to 25 years in prison in Italy because he could not be extradited
to the United States.

The. informant advised that following the ogee: of his biacnces:
LOUIS: VOLPE -was incarcerated by the Pittsburgh Police Department
who thought he had something to do with the SPINELLI-VOLPE feud.
He! recalled: laughingly that when LOUIS, now.a close associate of

SEBASTIAN JOHN LA ROCCA,.was released from jail, there. were a
“great. many newspapermen on hand and when a flash bulb went. off

unexpectedly, LOUIS fainted, believing he was shot; He recalled
that during’ the early 1920's, numbers operations in.the Pittsburgh
vicinity were incidental to moonshine operations.and that most.”
moonshiners carried numbers cards in their back pockets. He
suggested-that..the Pittsburgh Police Department. became interested
in numbers_only when moonshine. became no longer profitable for
them. “He- advised that he.still sees both LOUIS and.JOSEPH.VOLPE.:
on-occasion and has seen both of them with MIKE GENOVESE and

JOHN LA ROCCA.

petition. : E ae

to have the petition dismissed “on merit" and with prejudice
so..that..LA ROCGA will: be. unable. to re-petition within a. five-year
period, HEIMOVITZ advised that he feels sure that he could. go
into United’ States Federal District Court at any time and obtain
the denial of the petition on the grounds that LA R@CGA has failed
to prosecute it. He suggested, however, that when LA ROCCA
returns he will be expected to give a satisfactory account of his
whereabouts ‘during the period he was not in the.Pittsburgh. vicinity
and to. show ..why -he: didnot. comply.with: two. subboenas.sent to’ his
vesidence:... -. . : :
