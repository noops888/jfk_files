children living there. He described SPINELEI as about 614"

In height and said that he was known in the area as a professional.

killer who hired out on out-of-town Jobs. He stated that when

SPINELLI was crossed up in some manner by the VOLPE brothers in

connection with some stills he owned personally, he became so

enraged that he vowed he would kill ald three.

The informant

stated that he was with SPINELLI when SPINELL Obtained the

weapon with which he killed the VOLPEs and left & moonshine

joint without saying where he was going.

He said he later

by-standers who told

him that SPINELLI had encountered the three VOLFE brothers

eating breakfast at Bazzanno's Restaurant on wylie Avenue,"

Pittsburgh, at which time he gunned them to death.

The informant recalled that SPINELLI gathered

his few personal

belongings together and immediately fled to New Yorks where he

encountered the brother of the BAZZANNO who ran the Pittsburgh

restaurant.

He stated that SPINELLI killed this individual

and that the newspapers related, that BAZZANNO was discovered

with more than 150 ice pick holes in hin and various sections

of his body cut off.

He recalled that SPINEE then fled to

Italy and had nerve enough to settle with his tamily in the same

town in which the elder VOLPE was an offilal. He recalled that

the elder VOLPE was then responsible for having SPINELLI sentenced

to 25 years in prison in Italy because he could not be extradited

The informant advised that following the murder of his brothers,

LOUIS VOLPE was incarcerated by the Pittsburgh Police Department

who thought he had something to do with the SPINELL-VOLPE feud.

unexpectedly, LOUIS fainted, believing he was shot.

vicinity were incidental to moonshine operations and that most

moonshiners carried numbers cards in their back pockets.

in numbers only when moonshine became no longer profitable for

them. He advised that he still sees both LOUIS and JOSEPH. VOLPE:

on occasion and has seen both of them with MIKE GENOVESE and

JOHN LA ROCCA.
