Mazurov Report on Centrai Comm .tee

Minsk Domestic Service in Belorusaian 0545 GMP 26 September 1951--L
(OFFICIAL USE ONLY)

(Report by First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Belorussian
Communist Party Mazutov on the work of the Central Committee of the
Belorussian Communist Party, at the 25th Congress of the Belorussian
Communis* Party)

(Zext) Comrades: In an atmosphere of unprecedented labor and political
enthusiasm, the Soviet people are marching toward the 22d Congress of
the CPSU. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, and carrying
out the decisions of the 20th end 2lst congresses of the CPSU, the
working people of our country are achieving ever new success in the
pbuilding of communism. The seven-year plan is hetne eaveied out
successfully.

We must not forget even for a minute that a fierce ideological

struggle is in progress in the world, a struggle which knows no

respite. Bourgeois ideologists have not abandoned their hopes of
weakening the ideological unity and cohesion of the Soviet people and
their solidarity in support of the Communist Party. In their subversive
work they are striving to find support among people who are morally
debased and burdened with the ideology of private ownership. Drunkerds,
thieves and profiteers, idlers and: spongers are immediate targets

of the bourgeois agents' attention, The struggle against these
elements requires the participation of the whole commnity.

At one time, party and administrative organs carried out mich work
attracting the public to the campaign against crime and the

violation of public order, and against immoral phenomena. I have in
mind the end of 1959 and the beginning of 1960. Tye wide network of
voluntary people's squads and comrades' squads was then set up in the
republic; these bodies began to render active assistance in the work
of upbringing. But many gorkoms and raykoms of the party have treated
the struggle against the antisocial phenomena as a short term campaign.
In @ number of places the people's squads and the comrades' squads
began to work less and less, and here and there exist only on paper,
showing no signs of actual life.

The campaign against crime has been relaxed by the public prosecutor's
department and the republic's public prosecutor, Comrade Bondar, the
supreme court and Chairman Comrade ghardyka, the Belorussian SSR
Ministry for Internal Affairs and Minister Comrade Aksenov, @!

local organs. Si sm and forebearance
regarding criminal elements. Party organs should reinforce the
campaign against crime and violation of laws, and guide in an active
manner the work of administrative organs and the forces of civic
organizations toward complete eradication of crime and the violation
of the rules of socialist life of the commnity.

An active fight against the manifestations of bourgeois morality and the
uprbringing of the Soviet people in the spirit of commmism constitutes:
a most important task of party propaganda and a sacred duty of all

the workers of the ideological front--all communists.

BELORUSSIAN INTERNAL AFFAIRS ORGANS DISCUSS LAW, ORDER
Moscow PRAVDA 29 May 71 L

[Text] Minsk, 28 May (TASS)--Today in the Belorussian Communist Party Central
Committee a conference was held of leading workers of internal affairs organs, and
of representatives of party, trade union and Komsomol] organizations, and of
Belorussian ministries and departments. [The conference was devoted to questions of
further strengthening law and order and socialist legality in light of the 24th
CPSU Congress decisions.

Belorussian Internal Affairs Minister A.A. .Klimovskoy gave a report. He spoke about
the great work of the organs of the militia, the procuratorate, and the pedple's
courts in propagandizing juridical and legal knowledge among the young, and workers
and empolyees of enterprises and institutions, and about the broad participation of
the working people of the Republic's cities and villages in the struggle with
violations of public order,

CPSU Central Committee Politburo candidate member and Belorussian Communist Party
Central Committee First Secretary P.M. Masherov, as well as USSR Internal Affairs
Minister N.A. Shchelokov gave speeches at the conference,

Shchelokov Speech

(Editorial Report--L] Minsk SOVETSKAYA BELORUSSIYA 30 May ‘publishes on page two a
3,000-word BELTA-attributed report on a conference of the leading workers of the
republic's administrative organs on 28 May, devoted to the discussion of the problems
of consolidating law and order. SOVETSKAYA BELORUSSIYA reports the speech delivered
by USSR Internal Affairs Minister N.A. Shchelokov as follows:

USSR Internal Affairs Minister N.A. Shchelokov made a. speech. He noted the great
successes of the working people of Belorussia in communist building. At every stop
in the republic, which until the October Revolution was an unfortunate district,

and was devastated in the yeavs of the Great Patriotic War, one now sees the fruits
of tremendous progress, the ebullient labor life, which is full of enthusiasm, and
the remarkable economic achievements.

Speaking of the tasks of the administrative organs stemming from the decisions of the
24th CPSU Congress, N.A. Shchelokov stressed that the consolidation of lawand order
and socialist legality is an integral part of the improvement of social-relations in
the period of building communism. The movement toward communism proceeds not through
a decrease, but through an intensification in the individual's responsibility to
society. And this is completely law-governed., Society is becoming ever more highly
organized. No antisocial manifestations, self-will. or anarchism, lack of discipline
or crimes can have a place in society, From this also stems théessence of the CPSU
measures for consolidating law and order and legality. This essence can be reduced
to the introduction of legal norms in accordance with the level of social relations
and social awareness which has been achieved and with higher moral criteria for
people's behavior.

The consolidation of law and order is also linked with the further process of the
democratization. of our society, Socialist democracy is incompatible with neglect
of one's duty as a citizen and with any actions which are detrimental to the
state's interests.

II. 4 Jun 71 i 37 "USSR DOMESTIC AFFAIRS

However, the vestiges of the past do not disappear by themselves, just as crime
does not disappear by itself, Communist morality and world outlook are confirmed
in the constant and uncompromising struggle against these vestiges. The growth
in awareness and culture creates real preconditions for the successful struggle
against crime. But to implement these preconditions the tremendous, plan-governed
and purposeful organizational and educational work of the party, state organs and
the whole public is needed.

‘The instructions of the 24th CPSU Congress for the consolidation of law and order
and legality are a program of just such a plan-governed and purposeful work, N.A.
Shehelokov stressed.

In the last 5-year period there has been an all-round increase in the role of the
internal affairs organs in the organization of preventive work, and in insuring
the Leninist principle of the inevitability of punishment. Radical measures have
been taken for consolidating legality and for decisively increasing the standard
in the work of the militia, and for unearthing cases of lawlessness and tyranny.
The ties of the internal affairs organs with the public have been expanded and
consolidated and their authority has been increased. Special attention has been
and is being paid to the questions of the scientific organization of labor and
management. Much has been done for a qualitative improvement in the cadres
composition.

The USSR internal affairs minister illustrated the results of the work which has been
done with examples from Belorussia. He spoke of the fact that the republic's

party organization and the Belorussian Government are raising and developing by all
possible means the activeness of the soviets of working people's deputies, of the
public, the economic organs and the labor collectives in the struggle for exemplary
law and order and for the consolidation of legality. And this is bringing good
fruit; law violations and erime are being reduced.

In implementing the decisions of the 24th CPSU Congress, N.A. Shchelokov said, we
must do everything so that the activity of the internal affairs organs, the

court and the prosecutor's office assists to the maximum degree the implementation
of the plans for communist building outlined for the ninth 5-year plan. And the
general line in all this work ‘should be preventive measures, the necessity for which
is dictated by the entire system of our life, by our morality, and by our aspira-
tion to wage the struggle for the fate of every person, not allowing him to enter
into serious conflict with the law and society.

The collectives of the enterprises, institutions, construction sites, kolkhozes

and sovkhozes are called on to play a great role in preventive work. The question
of the interaction of the internal affairs organs with the trade union organizations
and the Komsomol 1s a very important one. ‘The spearhead of preventive work should
be aimed at preventing law violations and crime among Juveniles. It is essential
to do everything for the rising generation to be educated in a spirit of the high’
moral principles of comminism, and to be the worthy continuer of their:fathers! © 2
heroic affairs.

Further the speaker mentioned the importance of increasing efficiency in the whole
activity of the Internal affairs Ministry organs. It is essential to constantly
improve the management system, and work in selecting, placing, training and :
educating cadres, and to consolidate official discipline by all possible means, The
USSR Internal Affairs Ministry must pay special attention to these questions.

MILITARY COURT SENTENCES HITLERITE COLLABORATOR TO DEATH
Minsk SOVETSKAYA BELORUSSIYA in Russian’ 17 Jun 72 p 3 L
[V, Mikhaylov article: "Not Destined To Oblivion")

'
(vext] ‘the military tribunal of the Red Banner Belorussian Military District has
concluded. the open trial of the trattors to the motherland and underlings of the
Hitlerite fascists during the Great Patriotic War, P.A. Korotkevich and N.S. Shkradyuk,
‘The court examination, under the chairmanship of the Lt Col of Justice Ye, N.
Porokhovnichenko, lasted for more than 2 weeks, The teStimonies of many witnesses
were heard and a large number of documents collected in connection with the case

were read, including ¢aptured documents, All this helped the eourt to reconstruct
fully the picture of the grave erimes perpetrated by the betrayers of the Russian
people.

A serviceman in the Soviet Army and finding himself on Belorussian territory temporarily
occupied by Hitlerite troops in the fall of 1941, Korotkevich turned traitor to the
motherland and voluntarily joined the German punitive organs--the secret field police
arp-718. For particular zeal-he was promoted to the rank of private first elass and
assigned to a Special operational group commanded by the fascist executioner (Ribernik)
and was the police battalion's interrogator. Shkrddyuk crossed over to serve the
occupationists in April 1942, ‘The Hitierite hirelings carried out active punitive
activities against Soviet people and helped the fascists to annihilate peaceful in-
habitants, The record of these villains shows their personal participation in many
crimes,

In the fall of 1942 Korotkeviech and Shkradyuk together with other members of the
punitive organs participated in the execution of two groups of arrested. Soviet
eitizens who were in Bobruysk Prison, Among them were women and children, The
members of the punitive organs made the severely beaten and tortured people lie face
dvi in previously dug pits and then cold-bloodedly fired into them point-blank, At
the end of August and beginning of September of the same year Korotkevich participated
in a punitive operation conducted on the territory of the Kirovskiy and Klichevskiy
rayons in Mogilev Oblast,’ During the course of this operation the members of the
punitive organs organized roundups and pogroms, seized peaceful inhabitants, tortured
‘them during interrogations, and then executéd them in a nursery garden on the out-
skirts of Lyubonichi village in Ktrovskiy Rayon, Together with other members of the
punitive organs, Korotkevieh tortured the inhabitants of the villages StoyAlovo,
Dubrov, and Kostrichi, In February 1943 in the village of Iskra’ in-Svetiogorskiy
Rayon he arrested the Soviet patriot A.I, Verzhbitskiy, whose subsequent fate is
unknown, In the spring of the same year in Parichi he tortured Nikolay Grinenko,

an inhabitant of Selishche village, and Ivan Lopukhin, from Stepa vi}lage in the
Zhlobinskiy Rayon, and in Bobruysk he tortured two Soviet citizens who had tried to
Join the partisans, a

Ih May and June 1944 the punitive members of the GFP eommand, while retreating
together with the fascists, arrested a group of patriots in Albertin village in the
SYonimskiy Rayon: Leontiy Skarupich, Aleksandr Zmitrovich, Mikhayil Lavu, Varfolomey
Salitu, Anton Rudman, Pavel Myshko, and Vladimir Strupovets, after being tortured
and tormented they were all shot. 7

In court Korotkevich tired to extricate himself. However, the witnesses!
testimonies and the documents collected in the investigation completely unmasked
this inveterate murderer.

During the course of the trial it was established that the Hitlerite hirelings
distinguished themselves by particular barbarity. Together with similar cutthroats,
Korotkevich once beat a prisoner to death in the courtyard of Bobruysk Prison. He
and other members of the punitive organs forced the inhabitants of Markovshchina
village in Klichevskiy Rayon to walk along the Klichev-Stoyalovo road so as to

clear the mines on it. During this, one of the village's inhabitants, Mikhail
Miroshnichenko, was blown up by.a mine. There was a case of the executioners making
@ man condemned to death sing and dance before execution. In fipril 1943 Shkradhyuk
was on short term leave in Podlipye village in Bobruysk Rayon, On learning that an
inhabitant of this village, M.T. KovalRov, had been arrested, he hurried to the
Police base and began beating Kovalkov with an iron rod and then struck his head
against a brick wall. Shkradyuk also cruelly tortured the partisan, I. Ya. Melnikov,
an inhabitant of Progress village, who was there after being captured by the fascists.

With their masters, the traitors escaped to the West. After the war they returned
to the Soviet Union but kept silent about their participation in punitive actions,
Shkradyuk lived in Tselinograd Oblast, and Korotkevich, having changed his suyname,
first name, patronymic, and nationality, settled in Baranovichi, thinking that he
would scarcely be sought so near the places of the crimes. This monster, who has
had three wives since the war, sank to the lowest level of moral degradation,

The Belorussian state security organs have had to carry. out much painstaking work

to find and unmask the traitors. Despite the fact that more than quarter of a

century has passed sonce the war, just retribution has caught up with the criminals.
‘The military tribunal has sentenced F.A. Korotkevich to the supreme form of punishment--
execution--and N.S. Shkradyuk to 12 years imprisonment in a strict regime corrective-
labor colony.

There are no periods of prescription or mercy for those who perpetrated crimes during
the war. Scocrer of later the well-deserved punishment will overtake: them all.

Axek in March 1918, when the Seventh Party Congress was discussing the resolution

“on War nnd. Peace," Vladimir Tlioh said: “,,.Wo find ouraelvea tn conditions under
which military secrets are becoming very important major tenves for the Runaian Republic"
(Volume 36 page 41), These instructions from Lenin are Just 5 relevant today, uhen
enemy intelligence services are attempting to conduct total espionage in the socialist
countries, resorting to diverse insidious subterfuges from ayents penetrating to our :
secrets to obtaining the information they need by deduction from talks with Soviet
people, Particular attention is devoted to the extraction of scfentific and technicai
information from our scientists during various international congresses, symposiums,

and exhibitions and also during private meetings with Soviet specialists. Acting on
instructions from their intelligence services, certain Western scientists strive to
obtain secret information from Soviet scientists under the pretext of “a common interest
in sctence,*

Soviet people are standing vigilantly on guard over state secrets. But it 1s impossible
to avoid noting that we sometimes encounter instances of indifference or even careless-
ness, Individual citizens, forgetting the enemy's desire for intelligence and wishing
to display their own knowledge, blurt our, important state secrets, inflicting definite
harm on our motherland's interests. The great Russian writer 8altykov-Shohedrin o
wrote the following about this category of peopl ‘There are people incapable of
Keeping to themselves any single thought that comes into their head or any piece of

news heard from somebody else, They cannot rest until they have blurted everything

out, that is, until they have told at least five separate people what they know.” This
‘carelessness must be resolutely combated. Bvery Soviet person, and particularly those
with access to secrets, should constantly remember that so long as imperialist staten
and their intelligence agencies exist, it 1s necessary in all places and at all times

to strictly -preserve state and party secrecy so that any lacunae which enemy intelligence
services could exploit are firmly sealed. The essence of the apt folk expression "a
blabbermouth is a real find for a spy" should be firmly grasped by all our citizens.

The imperialist states! ruling circles assign.a considerable role in the implementation
of their subversive plans to ideological subversion as one of the sharpest weapons in
the class struggle against the socialist countries. This 1s expressed in practical
terms in agitprop or intelligence organization actions, undertakings, and operations
aimed at undermining soctaliam from within and @iscrediting the socialist system and
the ideas of Marxism-Leninism in the eyes of peoples throughout the world.

Snamy propaganda levels particular attacks against the CPSU--the most authoriative
and influential force in the communist movement. The enemies of communiem rabidly
attack our party for refusing to budge from positions of principle and confidently
leading the Soviet people along the path of building a communist society,

The imperialists stubbornly attempt to attack the Soviet people's moral principles and
most sacred feelings--their love for the homeland and their native communist party
and its Leninist Central Committee. They want to shake our faith in the nature and
correctness of the great cause for which we are fighting, prevant Soviet people being
reared in the spirit of patriotism and ideological-political and moral stanchness,

and thereby brake the Soviet people's victorious movement toward communism, The
practical recommendations of Alard Von (Shakk), a West German "specialist" in
psychological operations, are not without interest here. [paragraph continues)

Let .us cite these: “Utilizing ell: modern propaganda media and skillful means of
psychological struggle, our morality and ideology must he implanted in the social
avurehers ef the coyntrits in the communist comp: Exploiting national differences,
religdous prejudiced, and human woalmesses--female vanity, envy, the desire for
luxuries--it is necessary to develop indifference toward the communist leadership's
objectives. Economic, moral, and other flaws must be mercilessly exposed in order
to arouse the population to passive resistance and sahotage."

Thesa "recommendations" confirm once again Lenin's tenet to the effect that "when
the bourgeoisie's ideological influence on the workers declines or is undermined

or weakened, the bourgeoisie has always and everywhere reaorted to the most denporate
Jies and slander and will continua to do so" (Volume 25, page 352).

Impertalist propaganda is attempting by every means to dixcredit the CPSU's national
policy and awaken nationalist prejudteas in the Soviet people's minds. As Comrade
L.T. Brezhnev stressed in the report to the 2Uth CPSU Congress, it 15 precisely on
nationalist trends, particularly those which take the form of anti-Sovietism, that
bourpeots Ideologists are now gambling most: enthusiastically in the struggle against
socialism and the communist movement. The enemy utilizes « broad arsenal of
propaganda and technical means to conduct ideological subversion. The press, radio
and, television--everything is mobilized to deceive people and slander socialism,

the communist party, and its policy. For this purpose the imperialist states!
secret services and ideological centers make active use of scientific, technical,
and enitural ties with the Soviet Union.

our ccuntry hospttably opens its doors wide to foretim citizens wishing to aequatut
themselves with the life of Soviet people and to see the architectural treasures and
ntsand modern cultural monuments of the peoples of the USSR. If 1s precisoly

e purposes that the overwhelming majority of foreigners come to our country.
oquainting themselves with the achievements of the land.of the soviets and

our reality they become convinced with their own eyes of the falsity of

eois propaganda and, as a rule, react rapturously to all they see. Many of
speak about this in conversations with Soviet people and bear testinony
to vb in written comments.

Mere, for exomple, 1s a comment by Englishmen David Hayes: "Personally, T fing tha
Nussia ic the most beautiful of all the countrics J have visited. The people with
whom I have met and spoken havo been very pleasant, amiable, and affectionated

X new have a better understanding of what socialism is, and it has impressed mo
peeatly."

ortunately, not all Soviet citizens oome to us with govd intentions Sheer are

Z 8 where some of them try, om the instructions of the enemy's special secyvices
and ideological centers, to bring anti-Soviet Tfteratura into the Soviet Union, to
exert a harmful influence on individual citizens, and tn secure secret: Infomation of
interest to an enemy. Soviet citizens temporarily traveling to: capitalist countries
become objects of special attention for. the enemy. There, as a rule, they aro
subjected to intensive anti-Soviet indoctrination, and various provocations against
them with the aim of inducing them not to return to the motherland and enlisting
individual gullible people to perform spy missions are not excluded,

In order to blunt the Soviet people's political vigilance our class encmies frequently
camouflage their ideological sabotage with a veil of "benevolence" and "concern" to
improve the state of affairs in socialist society and with the desire to help with
“good advice." (paragraph continues]

(Las a one delves more deeply into the essence of this “advice” and “ocrsern," it
‘ec “ot hard to notice that it 4s all used by the enemy's desire to morally corrupt
the Soviet people and contaminate them with indifference to polities and with
Philistine peevishness.

‘ut however much the enemy may strive to undermine Soviot society from within and
jowever it may endeavor to hinder the victorious dissemination of Marxist-Leninist
ideas in the world, all its attempts are doomed to failure because these aspirations
are opposed by the communist ideological conviction of the Soviet people and active
vuiiders of communism and by the vital capacity of communist ideology.

A’ a result of liquidating the exploiter classes and building a developed socialist
ungiety here, the nooial base for the existence and dovelopment of bourgeois savology
hin completely vanished. The Marxist-Leninist world outlook has become firmly
established and rules undivided in our society. The Soviet pecple are united by
international friendship and their common high aims of building communism. At the

@ time, it would be wrong to overlook the hostile activities of imperialist states
dq think that the tremendous bourgeois machine of lies.and slandér in. idling. . Tho
facts testify that individual politically and morally unstable Soviet citizens--
particularly those whose consciousness still preserves survivals from the past--

{all for the bait of ideological saboteurs and commit antisocial deeds.

Hence the need for a most resolute and uncompromising struggle against bourgeois
ideology and its hostile influence on the working masses. The question 4s only

as follows: bourgeois or socialist ideology," V.I. Lenin wrete. “There: is no middle
rath. ...therefore, any belittling of soofalist ideology, any divergence from it thereby
eans the stréngthening of bourgeois ideology." "...We must tirelessly struggle against
y bourgeois ideology, in whatever fasionable and brilliant dress it may clothe

f" (vol 6, pp 39-40, 269).

Pollowing the great leader's behests, the Communist Party, proceeding from the theses
of Marxist-Leninism, wages a persistent and consistent struggle against bourgeois
Ideology and boldly and decisively exposes all the intrigues of imperialism and its
apologists. The party actively educates CPSU members and all working people in a
spirit of high Soviet patriotism, indefatigable political vigilance, and an
implacable attitude toward a11 kinds of bourgeois and revisionist views.

jar motherland is now marching with confident steps toward communism, The building
of the new society is successfully being implemented in the other countries of the
socialist community, The,communist, workers, and national liberation movement is
growing throughout the world. The preservation and strengthening of peace is the
chief problem of our time exercising the minds of mankind. Guided by the principle
formulated by V.I. Lenin of peaceful coexistence between states with different socio-
political systems, the Communist Party and the Soviet Government are steadily and
consistently pursuing a foreign policy. aimed at preventing wars, effecting complote
and general disarmament, and insuring peace and friendship between the peoples, Our
party's April plenum, which considered the question of the CPSU Central Committee's
international activities in implementing the 24th Party Congress decisions, {1 new
confirmation of this,

The practioal implementation of the peace program elaboratad by the 24th CPSU Congress
is yielding tremendously fruitful results,

‘The visite by Comrade L,I, Brezhnev, general secretary of the CPSU O:ntral Committee,
to thé FRO and the United States and also his meetings with G. Pompidou, president of
France, concentrated 1n themselves, as at a focal point, a radteal improvement in tne
international atmosphere, A‘et111 greater thaw has arrived tn relatsons between
East ‘and West,

All this, however, must not serve us as grounds for complacency and indifference, It
would be wrong’ to believe that, in connection with the certain relaxation of international
tension and the prospects for improved cooperation between the socialist and capitalist
states, our ideological opponents will cease or at least reduce theJr subversive
activities, On the contrary, knowing the nature of imperialism, ‘we must: expect...

its special services and ldeological centers to continue to try still more actively to
use various. forms of international communteation for purposes hostile to socialism

and communism,

In bis report at the joint ceremonial session of the CPS Central Committee, the USSR
Supreme Soviet, and the RSFSR Supreme Soviet in Moscow on 21 December 1972 Leonid Tich
Brezhnev said: "The CPSU proceeded and now proceeds from the premine that the clans
wtruggle of the two systems~-capitalist and socialist-tn the sphere of economies,
politics, and, of course, ideology will continue. It cannot be otherwise for the world
outlook and class aims of socialism and capitalism are opposed and “irreconcilable.”

This is why the further raising of thé: Soviet people's political vigilance and the
strengthening of concern to safeguard the security of the land of the soviets remain
one of the most important tasks to modern times.

Political vigilance. is a powerful weapon in the struggle against our adversaries' hostile
intrigues, It is expressed, above all, in the ability to opportunely expose the enemies
of the socialist motherland, however skillfully they may disguise themselves and to
whatever perfidious means and methods’ they may resort.

Revolutionary vigilance must not be considered in fsoJation, It 1s indissolubly linked
with and manift itself in organte unity with the other moral and political qualities
of the Soviet person--his vivifying Soviet patriotism and proletarian internationalism,
profound devotion to nis motherland and the Communist Party, high consciousness and
ideological conviction, organization and discipline, and burning hatred for the enemies
of communism, At the same time, the displaying of vigilance means implacability toward
all kinds of shortcomings and struggle against the slightest digression from conscientious
execution of the Soviet laws,

At the same time, political vigilance has nothing in common with suspiciousness and
mistrust or with the fanning of spymania, as is widely practiced in capitalist states.

Of course, high moral and political qualities do not come of their own accord. They are
inculcated in the members of our society in the process of daily educational work. This
determines the need to strengthen the working people's ideological and political
education in the spirit of the CPSU program and-the 24th Party Congress decisions and
in the spirit of tne great, all-conquering teaching of Marxism-Leniniam and of
indefatigable revolutionary vigilance,

And’ the more conseientious every Soviet person 1s and the higher his political vigilance,
the more reliably the security of our glorious socialist motherland will be insured.

iad wanted Anatoliy to marry the daughter of another mem-
ber of the Belorussian CC, Aleksey Alekseyevich SMIRNOV,
and this has caused much conflict between father and son,
in addition to that already generated by the son's heavy
