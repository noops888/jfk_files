Mazurov Report on Centrai Comm_ tee

Minsk Domestic Service in Belorussian 0545 GMT 28 September 1951--1

(OFFICIAL USE ONLY)

(Report by First Secretary of the Central Cormittee of the Belorussian

Communist Party Mazurov on the work of the Central Committee of the

Belorussian Communist Party, at the 25th Congress of the Belorussian

Communist Party)

(Text)

Comrades: In an atmosphere of unprecedented labor and political

enthusiasm, the Soviet people are marching toward the 22d Congress of

the CPSU.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party, and carrying

out the decisions of the 20th and 2ist congresses of the CPSU, the

working people of our country are achieving ever new success in the

building of cormunism. The seven-yeas plan is heine raried out

successfully.

We must not forget even for a minute that a fierce ideological

their solidarity in support of the Communist Party. In their subversive

work they are striving to find support among people who are morally

debased and burdened with the ideology of private ownership. Drunkards,

thieves and profiteers,

idlers and spongers are immediate targets

of the bourgeois agents' attention. The struggle against these

elements requires the participation of the whole community.

At one time, party and administrative organs carried out much work

attracting the public to the campaign against crime and the

violation of public order, and against immoral phenomena. I have in

mind the end of 1959 and the beginning of 1960. The wide network of

voluntary people's squads and comrades' squads was then set up in the

republic; these bodies began to render active assistance in the work

of upbringing. But many gorkons and raykons of the party have treated

the struggle against the antisocial phenomena as a short term campaiga.

In a number of places the people's squads and the comrades' squads

none or me acted de bee an there exiet only on paper,

The campaign against crime has been relaxed by the public prosecutor's

department and the republic's public prosecutor, Comrade Bondar, the

suprene court and Chairman Comrade Shardyka, the Belorussian SSR

Ministry for Internal Affairs and Minister Comrade Aksenov, and their

local organs. Sometimes they display Iiberalism and forebearance

regarding criminal elements. Party organs should reinforce the

campaign against crime and violation of laws, and guide in an active

manner the work of administrative organs and the forces of civic

organizations toward complete eradication of crime and the violation

of the rules of socialist life of the community.

An active fight against the manifestations of bourgeois morality and the

upbringing of the Soviet people in the spirit of communism constitutes...

a most important task of party propaganda and a sacred duty of all

the workers of the ideological front--all communists.

BELORUSSIAN INTERNAL AFFAIRS ORGANS DISCUSS LAW, ORDER

MOSCOW PRAVDA 29 May 71 L

[Text] Minsk, 28 May (TASS)--Today in the Belorussian Communist Party Central

Committee a conference was held of leading workers of internal affairs organs, and

of representatives of party, trade union and Komsomol organizations, and of

Belorussian ministries and departments. The conference was devoted to questions of

further strengthening law and order and socialist legality in light of the 24th

CPSU Congress decisions.

Belorussian Internal Affairs Minister A.A. Klimovskoy gave a report.. He spoke about

the great work of the organs of the militia, the procuratorate, and the people's

courts in propagandizing juridical and legal knowledge among the young, and workers

and empolyees of enterprises and institutions, and about the broad participation of

the working people of the Republic's cities and villages in the struggle with

violations of public order.

CPSU Central Committee Politburo candidate member and Belorussian Communist Party

Central Committee First Secretary P.M. Masherov, as well as USSR Internal Affairs

Minister N.A. Shchelokov gave speeches at the conference.

Shchelokov Speech

[Editorial Report--I] Minsk SOVETSKAYA BELORUSSIYA 30 May publishes on page two a

3,000-word BELTA-attributed report on a conference of the leading workers of the

republic's administrative organs on 28 May, devoted to the discussion of the problems

of consolidating law and order.

SOVETSKAYA BELORUSSIYA reports the speech delivered

by USSR

Internal Affairs Minister NoA. Shchelokov as follows:

USSR Internal Affairs Minister N.A. Shchelokov made a speech. He noted

the great

successes of the working people of

Belorussia in communist building. At every stop

in the republic, which until the October Revolution was an unfortunate district,

and was devastated in the years of the Great Patriotic War, one now sees the fruits

of tremendous progress, the ebullient labor life, which is full of enthusiasm, and

the remarkable economic achievements.

speaking of the tasks of the administrative organs stemming from the decisions of the

24th CPSU Congress, N.A. Shchelokov stressed that the consolidation of law and order

and socialist legality is an integral part of the improvement of social relations in

the period of building communism.

The movement toward communism proceeds not through

a decrease, but through an intensification in the Individual's responsibility to

society.

And this is completely law-governed. Society is becoming ever more highly

organized. No antisocial manifestations, self-w1ll or anarchism, lack of discipline

or crimes can have a place in society.

From this also stems the essence of the CPSU

measures for consolidating law and order and legality. This essence can be reduced

to the Introduction of legal norms in accordance with the level of social relations

and social awareness which has been achieved and with higher moral criteria for

people's behavior.

The consolidation of law and order is also linked with the further process of the

democratization. of our sooiety. Socialist democracy is incompatible with neglect

of one's duty as a citizen and with any actions which are detrimental to the

state's interests.

'USSR DOMESTIC AFFAIRS

However,

the vestiges of the past do not disappear by themselves, just as crime

does not disappear by itsell.

Communist morality and world outlook are confirmed

In the constant and uncompromising struggle against these vestiges. The growth

In awareness and culture creates real preconditions for the successful struggle

against crime. But to implement these preconditions the tremendous, plan-governed

and purposeful organizational and educational work of the party, state organs and

the whole public is needed.

The instructions

of the 24th CPSU

Congress for the consolidation of law and order

and legality are a program of just such a plan-governed and purposeful work, N.A.

Shchelokov stressed.

In the last 5-year period there has been an all-round increase in the role of the

internal affairs organs in the organization of preventive work, and in insuring

the Leninist principle of the inevitability of punishment. Radical measures have

been taken for consolidating legality and for decisively increasing the standard

In the work of the militia, and for unearthing cases of lawlessness and tyranny.

The ties of the internal affairs organs with the public have been expanded and

consolidated and their authority has been increased. Special attention has been

and is being paid to the questions of the scientific organization of labor and

Much has been done for a qualitative improvement in the cadres

composition.

The USSR internal affairs minister illustrated the

results of the work which has been

done with examples from Belorussia.

He spoke of the fact that the republic's

party organization and the Belorussian Government are raising and developing by all

possible means the activeness of the soviets of working people's deputies, of the

pablie, the economic organs and the labor collectives in the struggle for exemplary

law and order and for the consolidation of legality. And this is bringing good

fruit; law violations and crime are being reduced.

In implementing the decisions of the 24th CPSU Congress, N.A. Shchelokov said, we

must do everything so that the activity of the internal affairs organs, the

court and the prosecutor's office assists to the maximum degree the implementation

of the plans for communist building outlined for the ninth 5-year plan.

general line in all this work should be preventive measures, the necessity for which

1s dictated by the entire system of our life, by our morality, and by our aspira-

tion to wage the struggle for the fate of every person, not allowing him to enter

into serious conflict with the law and society.

The collectives of the enterprises, institutions, construction sites, kolkhozes

and sovkhozes are called on to play a great role in preventive work.

The question

of the interaction of the internal affairs organs with the trade union organizations

and the Komsomol is a very important one. The spearhead of preventive work should

be aimed at preventing law violations and crime among juveniles..

to do everything for the rising generation to be educated in a spirit of the high i

moral principles of communism, and to be the worthy continuer of their fathers! ?::

heroic affairs.

Further the speaker mentioned

the importance of Increasing efficiency in the whole

activity of the internal Affairs Ministry organs.

It is essential to constantly

Improve the management system, and work in selecting, placing, training and

educating cadres, and to consolidate official discipline by all possible means, The

USSR Internal Affairs Ministry must pay special attention to these questions.

MILITARY COURT SENTENCES HITLERITE COLLABORATOR TO DEATH

Minsk SOVETSKAYA BELORUSSIYA in Russian 17 Jun 72 p 3 L

[V. Mikhaylov artiole: "Not Destined To Oblivion*)

[Text]

The military tribunal of the Red Banner Belorussian Military Distriot has

concluded. the open trial of the traitors to the motherland and underlings of the

Hitlerite fascists during the Great Patriotic War, F.A. Korotkevich and N.S. Shkradyuk.

The court

examination, under the chairmanship of the Lt Col of Justice Ye. N.

Porokhownichenko, lasted for more than 2 weeks.

The testimonies of many witnesses

were heard

and a

large number of documents collected in connection with the case

were read; including captured documents.

All this helped the court to reconstruct

fully the ploture of the grave crimes perpetrated by the betrayers of the Russian

people.

A serviceman

in the Soviet Army

and finding himself on Belprussian territory temporarily

occupied by Hitlerite troops in the fall of 1941, Korotkevich turned traltor to the

motherland and voluntarily joined the German punitive organs--the secret field poliee

aFP-718.

For particular zeal he was promoted to the rank of private first elass and

assigned to a special operational group commanded by the fascist executioner (Ribernik)

and was the police battalion's interrogator.

Shkradyuk crossed over to serve the

occupationists in April 1942.

The Hitlerite hirelings carried out active punitive

activities against Soviet people and helped the fascists to annihilate peaceful in-

habitants. The record

of these villains shows their personal participation in many

crimes:

In the fall of 1942 Korotkevich and Shkradyuk together with other members of the

punitive organs participated in the execution of two groups of arrested Soviet

citizens who were in Bobruysk Prison. Among them were women and children.

The

members of the punitive organs made the severely beaten and tortured people lie face

down in previously dug pits and then cold-bloodedly fired into them point-blank.

At

the end of August and beginning of September of the same year Korotkevich participated

in a punitive operation conducted on the territory of the Kirovskly and Klichevskiy

rayons in Mogilev Oblast, During the course of this operation the members of the

punitive organs organized roundups and pogroms, seized peaceful inhabitants, tortured

them during interrogations, and then executed them in a nursery garden on the out-

skirts of Lyubonichi village in Ktrövskly Rayon, Together with other members of the

punitive organs, Korotkevich tortured the inhabitants of the villages Stoyalovo,

Dubrov, and Kostrichi.

In February 1943 in the village of Iskra in Svetlogorskiy

Rayon he arrested the Soviet patriot A.I. Verzhbitskly, whose subsequent fate 1s

unknown.

In the spring of the same year in Parichi he tortured Nikolay Grinenko,

an inhabitant of Selishche village, and Ivan Lopukhin, from Stepa village in the

Zhlobinskiy Rayon, and In Bobruysk he tortured two Soviet citizens who had tried to

Join the partisans.

In May and June 1944 the punitive members of the GPP command, while retreating

together with the fascists, arrested a group of patriots in Albertin village in the

Slonimskly Rayon: Leontiy Skarupich, Aleksandr Zmitrovich, Mikhayil Lavu, Varfolomey

Salltu, Anton Rudman, Pavel Myshko, and Vladimir Strupovets. Alter being tortured

and tormented they were all shot.

USSR MILITARY AFFAIRS

In court Korotkevich tired to extricate himself.

However, the witnesses'

testimonies and the documents collected in the investigation completely unmasked

this Inveterate murderer.

During the course of the trial it was established that the Hitlerite hirelings

distinguished themselves by particular barbarity. Together with similar cutthroats,.

Korotkevich once beat a prisoner to death in the courtyard of Bobruysk Prison. He

and other members of the punitive organs forced the inhabitants bf Markovshchina

village in Klichevskiy Rayon to walk along the Klichev-stoyalovo road so as to

clear the mines on it.

During this, one of the village's inhabitants, Mikhail

Miroshnichenko, was blown up by a mine. There was a case of the executioners making

a man condemned to death sing and dance before execution. In April 1943 Shkradhyuk

was on short term leave in Podlipye village In Bobruysk Rayon. On learning that an

inhabitant of this village, M.T. Kovalkov, had been arrested, he hurried to the

police base and began beating Kovalkov with an iron rod and then struck his head

against a brick wall. Shkradyuk also

cruelly tortured the partisan, I: Ya. Melnikov,

an inhabitant of Progress village, who was there after being captured by the fascists.

With their masters, the traitors escaped to the West.

After the war they returned

to the Soviet Union but kept silent about their participation in punitive actions.

Shkradyuk lived In Iselinograd Oblast, and Korotkevich, having changed his supname,

first name, patronymic, and nationality, settled in Baranovichl, thinking that he

would scarcely be sought so near the places of the crimes. This monster, who has

had three wives since the war, sank to the lowest level of moral degradation.

The Belorussian state security organs have had to carry. out much painstaking work

to find and unmask the traitors. Despite the fact that more than quarter of a

century has passed sonce the war, just retribution has caught up with the criminals.

The military tribunal has sentenced F.A. Korotkevich to the supreme form of punishment-..

execution--ard N.S. Shkradyuk to 12 years imprisonment in a strict regime corrective-

labor colony.

There are no periods of prescription or mercy

for those who perpetrated crimes during

the war. Sochier of later the well-deserved punishment will overtake: them all.

BRIEFS

SOVIET FORCE IN GERMAN AKTIV--Group of Soviet Forces in Germany--the communists and all

fighting men of the group of forces unanimously support the party's Leninist foreign

policy course.

This was clearly expressed in the work and decisions of the party aktir

meeting which

discussed the results of the work of the CPSU Central Committee May (1972)

plerum. The meeting was addressed by Col Gen S, Kurkotkin, group of forces commander.

Expressing the opinion of all communists of the group of sorces the party aktiv meeting

assured the CPSU Central Committee that the personnel of the units and subunits

will make every effort to implement suocessfully the historic decisions of the 24th

party congress and subsequent CPSU Central Committee plenums and will honorably fulflll

their duty of insuring the security of our great motherland and the countries of

the socialist community.

(Volume 36 page 41).

These instructions from Lenin are Just as relevant today, when

enemy intelligence services are attempting to conduct total esplonage in the socinlist

countries, resorting to diverse insidious subterfuges from agents penetrating to our

secrets

to obtaining the information they need by deduotion from talks with Soviet

people.

Particular attention is devoted to the extraction of scientific and technicai

information from our scientists during various international congresses, symposiums,

and exhibitions and also during private meetings with Soviet speclalists. Acting on

Instructions from their Intelligence services, certain Western scientists strive to

This

• carelessness must be resolutely combated. Every Soviet person, and particularly those

with access to secrets, should constantly remember that so long as imperialist states

and their intelligence agencies exist, It 1s necessary in all places and at all times

to strictly preserve state and party secrecy so that any lacunae which enemy intelligence

services could exploit are firmly sealed.

The essence of the apt folk expression "a

The visits by Comrade L.I. Brezhnev, general seoretary of the OPSU Ortral Commlttee,

to the FRO and the United

States and also his meetings with G. Pompldou, president of

France, concentrated in themselves, as at a focal point, a radical improvement in the

international

atmosphere. A still greater thaw has arrived In relations betwoon

East and West.

All this, however, must not serve us as grounds for complacency and indifference.

It

would be

to

believe that, in connection with the certain relaxation of international

tension and the prospects for improved cooperation between the soclalist and capitalist

states, our ideologioal ouponents will cease of at least reduce thily subversive

On the contrary, knowing the nature of Impertalian, we must expect. ...

1ts spectal services and ideological centers to continue to try st111 more actively to

use various. forms of international communication for purposes hostile to soclalism

and

It cannot be otherwide for the

This Is why the further ralsing of the sovlet people's political vigilance and the

strengthening of concern to safeguard the securlty of the land of the sovlets remain

one of the most important tasks to modern times.

Political vigilance. is a powerful weapon in the struggle against our adversaries' hostile

Intrigues.

It Is expressed, above all, In the abllity to opportunely expose the enemies

At the
