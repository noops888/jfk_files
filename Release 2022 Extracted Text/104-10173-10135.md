MEMORANDUM FOR. THE RECORD

“SUBJECT: Cocktail Party with Official
ae : Bloc Representatives

of the Soviet Embassy. He —~*
‘also met for the first time-Jan Jakowiec of the Polish Embassy ©
vho was introduced to undersigned by LOGINOV.

2. As usual LOGINOV spent most of the time conversing
with undersigned provocating him on'a number of issues. The
undersigned answered, making.a few similar comments about the
| Chinese Civil War. _When LOGINOV mentioned Vietnam, undersigned.

felt it would be nice if ‘the- Soviet ‘helped the U. S. to
bring péace to-that ‘area so they could concent¥ate.more-on
the Chinese Communist danger. At one point in the conversation
undersigned jokingly-asked LOGINOV if. there were Soviét
nationals in North Vietnam. The latter said, "sure, we have:
“ ctiany advisors there." The undersidnged said, "no, wtat he
pa 7 “°° .gleant Was behind guns or.'in the seats of airplanes." -LOGINOV
tice : ~said absolutely not. It also seems that LOGINOV has been
i keeping track of the people he sees undersigned talking with
i at cocktail parties, For example, LOGINOV was curious to
" Know if undersigned has seen “his Haitian ‘friendg." Undersigned
asked whighione - the black’ one or the white one. LOGINOV
said.the!ubste one, referring to the Haitian Vice Consul whom
. undersigned ‘occasionally talks to. Undersigned said he had
seen the Haitian atthe Haitian, National Day about a month
3 = go but noted that thé only Soviet present at that party was
~~. . ANDREYEV, not LOGINOV.* The latter, incidentally, corners
‘the Haitians: anytimé he. has “a chance to, although he officially
* .poo- s“the Haitian regime. “LOGINOV once more asked under-
‘Signed. when-he would come play tennis with him (this is about
the “fourth or fifth time). Undersigned told him he would do
‘so after he ‘gets invited. by LOGINOV as the latter has often
7 promised todo. One of the topics that LOGINOV méntioned
. was the Protection Section of the Embassy. . "Protection against
whom,"" he asked, ,, The ‘undersigned gave him the usual lowdown:
a “on the number of \tourists to Mexico and their problems.
LOGINOV must-have been interested in the- section as he mentioned
that a U. S. Vice-Consul working in that section whom he had
met recently will be transferring to another post.

_.3. JAKOWIEC appears to be a man’ who likes to-talk, His
Spafiish is quasi bi-lingual and JAKOWIEC says, by the way,
that he learned it in Brazil. (His wife is a plump, very

‘Polish-looking woman, Her +a¥tdei.conversation was to laugh

at some: of the xXchanges . between LOGINOV and the undersigned;
Both Mr. and } YARONIEC appear to. speak fluent Russian.

deferred thé. disciission this point for another meeting.

“AS many. of the Consular Corp; members know that undersigned

served tiany years in Vietnam, the latter felt that he should
not. hide this. fact to the official bloc representatives as
they would find out about it anyway, This.came out for the --
first time on the occasion ofthis cocktail party whea .
JAKOWIEC sonehow mentioned Vietnam and the efforts of. the

sh members ofthe. Armistice Commission there,. The
undersigned, | who-has known a number of these people. quite well,
told JAKOWIEC that they speak French better than Polish as
they were sons of Polish émigrants to’.France who returned to
Poland after Gomulka to power.” When JAKOWIEC started to
imply that this indicated how wonderful things were in Poland,

undersigned pointed out that the parents of the returnees, .

many of whom worked under very difficult conditions in France
in. the coal mines, preferred thei hard work to the chance of

will probably be held at-the Soviet Embassy. The President.

large attendance of official bloc representatives can therefore
Be expected at the next Ket-together..

remarks about the. extent of Ameriean influence in Mexico. Subject :
said that after about ten minutes, LOGINOV's purpose became aia : 1
blatantly obvious; that: he (subject) stopped the conversation

and told LOGINOV that before they went any farther, he “thought ” : L
LoGInov should know that he was talking to somone who was

| "100%, capitalist,” completely pro-Anericany and had absolutely
“no Sympathy with Communism. (While this sounds awfully blunt:

‘in wy. eyes, the fact of the matter is that Subject does tend to :
'Fye ave a bit blunt at times, and_ knowing his’ ideological ‘Leanings,

‘said that Loat nov tried to backtrack a dit after this, but the

1. As reported in Feferonce A, LIREALM-1 joined the
PDRUMEY Section of this Station on, 20 October 1967, It was
decided that LIREALS-1 should drop furthér efforts against
tho: Soviet, U.A,R.y and Indonesian targets. The decision
te discontinue efforts to develop contacts among Mexicans,
Yeo made at that timo, was later amended and LIREALN-1 wae
Shteusted with the handling of LIRELIC-1 along the lines of
the recommendation made in reference B. Thus, by’ November
1967 LIRFAL-1 had two main responsibilities: a). tho “French
target, against which he already had devoted considorable ~
fine and effort, and b) the handling of LIRELIC-1.

analysis of personality and other data provided by LEREALM-1,
the Station selected an access agent to the official French
community who.was. later, successfully contacted and was offered

eriphasized that LIREALN=1 was in no way connected with the
Approach made-to the French access agent. The second item

. on.which LIREALN-1 has made progress has beon tho developrient
ofa Noxican cmployee—of-the French Embassy who is used as a

_ Seneralscourier inside the’ Embassy. “This. development, for

security reasons, has-been slo LIREALN-1's "line" has been
that. a person with "the ability". of the courier can-and

should expect a better, paying. job than the one -he currently
holds. Thé courier onded up. taking that line as his own to
"protect" him .(as ho probably would have some trouble if the
{Embassy discovered ‘he was looking for another job). LIREALN-1
started -mecting the Mexican coutier outside the Fronch Embassy.
This: gave. LIREALN-1 the opportunity to talk to his prospect-

at some length without attracting “the attontion--of -the. members
of the Embassy. This.is as far as the Station will allow
LIREALN-1 to go in. this éase, which is currently: boing reviewed.
to decide who will continue the development of the -Embassy
courier and how.’ LIREALMN-1 will not, in any case, have any
connection with the. person selected for this task. He will
continue to maintain contact with ‘the courier but will start

“. to.seo him less often and will admit, in the end, that finding

a job for him turned out to be more difficult than expected.

35-.LIREALM-1 néanwhiie is continuing to cultivate ao
number, of selected members of the French Embassy and reports
‘on their activities aS a matter of routine. He has also
maintained contact for some months with a wealthy Mexican
businessman who is a good friend of DEVOSJOLY, ‘the ex-French
‘intelligence officer who provided the materi ‘al for Leon URIS'
best seller Topaz. LIREALM-1, in fact, had established ~.
DEVOSJOLY's identity: as coauthor of the book long before this
became known publicly .” He was Shown by DEVOSJOLY's friend -a
afe'at the latter's house in México City full of documents
probably bélonging to DEVOSJOLY. This information was reported ©
to. Headquarters via “special” channels.

. targets. By far the more important one is LIOGLE. The goal
here is hopefully to turn LIRELIC-1 into a penetration of
LIOGLE using. Several good contacts he has in this organization
as a Stepping stone, Some steps have been taken in this
direction.” LIRELIC-1 has addressed personal requests for
eassistance to current key LIOGLE personalities. “He has also
submitted his curriculum vitae in the hope of landing a job
in LIOGLE, . This has so far failed to produce any concrete
LIOGLE job offer. LIRELIC-1 realizes, of course, that he is
of no value to LNHARP unless -he obtains a, job giving him access
to hard information on LIOGLE plans and activities. The
promise of a regular salary, as a matter of fact, is completely
dependent on LIRELIC-l's ability to penetrate LIOGLE. In an
effort to maintain interim contact, however, and help LIRELIC-1
liquidate some personal debts, the Station, via LIREALM-1,
made-him a loan of 3,000 pesos, Further details on the LIOGLE

of using a contact which|LIRELIC-1 had with a PRRUMEN citizen

“appears to be an extended visit to try to solve complicated

6. References D and_E reviewed an incident which occurred
on 16 January and-had a. direct bearing on LIREALN-1's security.
It is the opinion of this Station that the person who saw
LIREALN-1 talk with Rayniond'a. FRADYER and Wallace B. ROWTON
did not positively identify .either of them, References stated
that this person could not’ have “been Valentin Sergeyevich
LOGINOV, who claimed to have’ observed the meeting. Reference E
pointed out, that before joining the PBRUMEN Section in October
1967 ‘LIREALN-1 had for some timo interested hinself in the
activities of tne “Soviets at Station request. Ne first made
contact with LOGINOV, for example, in April- 1967 and met with
him on the averago of once a week until October 1967.

Reference E also pointed out that’ LIREALN-1 only had four-
nectings with tho Soviet from October 1967 vo January 1968...
The Station. wants to emphasize once more that these were all

at LOGINOV's initiative, LIREALN+1 had discontinued his efforts
to maintain contact with the Soviet at Station's directive.

As pointed out above, one of the iain targets now handled by
~LIREALM-1 is the French, One of the best places to meet
Frenchnén is the French Club. Station would be very reluctant.
to have LIREALM-1, a long-time member of that club; terminate
his'membership. Neither does the Station want him to be too-
obvious in giving the cold shoulder to the Soviet. The Station
. does not believe, knowing what it knows of LOGINOY, that
serious and permanent damage has been done “to LIREALN-1's .
security and believes that he can continue to provide valuable

services to this Station.

6. With regard to the frequericy of LIREALN-1's meetings
with LOGINOV, mentioned in paragraph 4 of reference B,
LIREALN-1's contact reports list only four meetings during
the sane period, all.of which occurred at the French Club, and
one of which, on 2 November 1967, was a casual encounter at .
Yhich very few words were exchanged. It is significant to note,
however, that at the 12 November 1967 mecting,- while LIREALM1 :
and LOGINOV were chatting in the showers after the match, the
latter "joked that (LIREALN-1) should bring some of his friends

from the Embassy” to join them in playing tennis. LOGINOV
added, also apparently with a slight grin, "all of them are
WOFIRI." FRADYER, to whom ‘this remark was promptly reported,
did not consider it to’ have any special meaning since he knew
from personal and direct experience that LOGINOV is a born
provocateur who cannot resist needling people (Mexicans and
foreigners) with whom.he comes into contact. . WOFIRM often
comes up in LOGINOV conversations, not only with FRADYER, but
with persons of other nationalities. It was decided, however, «
to again warn LIREALN-1 at his next meeting with ROWTON

unwise moves-. He wishes’ to emphasize that this was the only, -
p-meeting at'thé ‘time that ‘he-had held with LIREALM-1 outside’

of a safehouse. All meetings between the undersigned and
LIREALM-1 have since been held under‘ the most secure con-
ditions on the edge ofthe Federal District and, in one éase,
beyond. While this does not ‘make this decision’ any wiser, he
also wants “to emphasize the fact that'it was made on the spur.
ofthe moment, ‘to quote tha old cliche, because the undersigned
"felt sorry" for’ LIREALN-1 because of the latter's financial
‘difficulties’ with the Station over his last accounting. The
undersigned: unwisely put LIREALN-1's morale for a brief moment
over basic security considerations. He is not in the habit °
of doing this as a matter of course. The day before his next
scheduled tennis meeting with LIREALM-1 the following Wednesday,
LOGINOV called LIREALN-1 and asked to be excused as his leg :
had worsoned. ‘The week after that LOGINOV showed up for his
regular tennis game with LIREALN-1 but made no mention of

his previous conversation with him two weeks before. The
undersigned waited to complete a review of this case until

he met LOGINOV face to face at one of the Consular Association
functions. Because of the visits of Soviet athletes and
artists which kept LOGINOV busy, however, this meeting did not
materialize until 28 March. Although the undersigned and
LOGINOV talked to each other off and on for more than two hours
on this occasion during a visit to the local Home Fair, LOGINOV
never mentioned anything about the Sanborns meeting. He has
never brought LIREALM-1's name to the attention of the
undersigned. #

had asked her to introduce hin to "one o7 her ‘progressive friends".
or. "soneone ia LAPURS."

8. The above represented a-capsule accocet of Subject's
relationship with her case officer, Keith 8. LUVENDERIS. CvIGNS
played innocént until ne got the viiolo story, but finally adaitted
that we had talked to tho girl. COIGNE told Lictuy=5 that Subject
had no idea that he was’ in contact with us and had in fact worried
that her activities in our behalf might create trouble for bin,
Asked. by COIGHE what advice be bad given Subject, LICUSY=5 said
that he bad told her to be truthfvl with the LEPURS officer and
to be carerul with LOGIROV.

&. On 2 August, during a very friondly “tarevell” lunch,
LEVENDERIS asked Sub; ect both about her most recent contacts vith

callers. (delivery men, students, persons on visa business) have
rung the foot gate buzzer, and in each instahce the guard has
routinely let them in without, going to thé gate to question them
or observe them more closely. Oh..one occasion, as many as four

. “young Mexican males who appeared'to be university students .rang
- the buzzer while LIROCKET-1 was inside the gatehouse, and the guard
let them in in the routine manner.

7 6. Once inside the gate, the pedestrian caller is. expected
to present himself at the gatehouse door, which is usually left
open, and state. his business. The guard then either socs next
door to summon an Embassy official from one of the two offices oft
the Reception Room, or, as in Subject's case, uses the interphone
fo.call someone inside the main building. (In LIROCKET=1's case,
che guard calls one of his Soviet students.) If instructed to have
the caller wait, the guard shows him into the Reception Room,
LIROCKET-} himself has been asked to wait in the Recention Room
about 5S times. On approximately 15 occasions, he has been invited
into the gatehouse by the guard on duty to chat. On the latter
occasions, he has either remained ‘in the acc ec until one of his
Soviet students has appeared to escort him into the main building
or Aas left the gatehouse after a few minutes and gone to the
Receptign toon to continue waiting for one of his students to
‘arrive. On approximately 60 of LIROCKET~i's visits to the kmbassy,

official Soviet’ visa hours’are. only on Tucsdays and Fridays

(from 1100#1300),, LIROCKET=1::saw Sovicts in both offices with about
‘equal frequency’ on Monday aac: Friday’ mornings. From what LIROCIT-1
could sec, the Sovicts' rarely Seened to be ‘busy with desk work,

but confined ‘themselves to looking Over newspapers, dpening mail,
chatting with each other, etc. Frequently Soviets went into one

6. Subject was thoroughly dobriefed upon his return fron the
USSR in early November 1966, st-which time he continued to exhibit
the samo friendliness and cooperativeness noted in paragraph: five.
Be reported that -he.was aware of no effort to assess, cultivate, or
comprosiiso bis in the USSR. He-provided information both on the
fornal ‘proceedings of the conference and on individual Soviet ‘end
foreign patticipante, wc cell as on a Spanish businesssian he met in
Hoscow. This’ information resulted in three Field Information Reports
_ GH=10;870, 39 November 1966, HMH-10,872, 30, November 1966, HOt
10,875, 30 November 1966), oné’.dispatch to Madrid (HLMA=30725, .
¥ December 1966), and a second to Santisgo’ (HMMA~30749, 2 December
1966).. Since furnishing Anformation on bis: trip to the USSR, :
“Subject has provided 1nformation on the travel of the Bolshoi
Ballet in Mexico, on 4 Méxican traveler to the USSR, and ona -
‘Soviet: student. group which .was slated to visit Mexico, but which
for unknown ‘reasons failed to’arrive at the last minut: i

_. ‘TiThe only Soviet Subject his recently beon in contact with
48 LOGINOV, whom he occdsionally sees on visa matte: According to.”
Subject, their relationship during. the past -yoar-has“been “strictly of

a buginess nature.and LOGINOV Has shown no interest in extending it
beyond this. Subject consequently xppears to have little to offer

in the way of, an access. agent to the Soviets in the foreseeable ©
future.. However, as the manager of one of five Moxican travel
agencies represonting Intourist and because of his apparently al
excellent contacts with Key personnel of the other four travel  agencie:

he. promises to be a-useful referent on persons who book travel in.
Mexico to the Soviet Union and other Communist countries. ee

8. Despite the regularization of our relationship with Subject

_ and-his increased ccoperativendss, wa do not feel wé-are currently.
ina position to ask-bim to undergo an SGSWIRL interview. “The :
relationship between the case officer and Subject at this time 18
essentially one of equals in which ‘Subject is voluntarily assisting
LNFORT out of idedlogical motivation.. It is true that his strong
business interest in maintaining friendly relations with LNFORT.
_and LNPURE provides us with a degree of control, but we.feol that at
present: it is better left as a form of tacit control than brandished
éven gubtlyj, It, 1s our opinion that Subject would regard an SGSWIRL
Literview a8 an effort both to-ircrease our control over bim and to
draw him:deoper into the intelligence business. Such a reaction
would in all probability undo much of our recent progress with
Subject: . Consequently, we would prefér-to postpone an SGSHIRL
interview until ofther we further solidify our relationship with ~
Subject or we wish to use hii in more ‘sensitive work.

8. One further matter for the record; BESABER was first

“tntreduced to LOGINOV. by BEWKEP. They again were together at

the Polish Embassy on'4 October 1966. Although BESABER has,
not told BEWEEP of his meet with LOGINOV on 13 January it is

~ only, because BESABER has not seen BEWEEP sitce before Christmas.

BESABER bag -been“instructed to be'perfectly open with BEWEEP
about having seen LOGINOV and in fact it may turn out that
LOGINOV and BEWEEP will ‘visit BESABER together. (LOGINOV
referred to the possibility in his 13 January meet with BESARER).
