Our Nr. 482° point 3. Everything points to the continuation of the internal
struggle [B val based] on the political interpretation of KENNEDY's assassi-
nation. Immediately after the attempt, the initial commentaries linked it
with the racist movement, which assumed the offensive by rallying themselves
around the efforts of the Texas police in order’ to saddle OSWALD, a reputed pro
CASTRO activist who two years ago wanted to rémain in the USSR, with the
responsibility for the attempt. The arrest’of Cubans was begun in Dallas.
GOLDWATER, who yesterday refused to commerlt on the assassination, joined the
campaign. Radio end television suspenddd 2ll their programs and -- with minor
exceptions which included ABC directed’ among others by the former EISENHOWER
press agent HAGHERTY -- taking advantage of this background to bring about anti-
communist hysteria. The fact that’Saturdey through Monday are days free of
work facilitates reaching the corimunity.

Today's declaration by JOHNSON and the Department of State denying the
existence of reputed facts.df a conspiracy against KENNEDY's life involving
the USSR and Cuba has as,its aim the restraint of the campaign of extreme
racists, which can create difficulty in overcoming the internal situation and
could paralyze the foreign policy of Washington.

Probably in reply to these declarations circulated among the American
press (among otkérs in the UN) is the theme that the KENNEDY murder could have
been inspired ‘by those centers in the USSR which do not want a detente. This
theme is algo being linked with the attempt to arrest BARGHOORN', the downing
of the Iranian aircraft, and Berlin access roadso

It i8, anticipated that immediately after the funeral personal intrigue will
begin. Speculation of RUSK's resignation are being repeated (possible succes-
sors, FULBRIGHT Or HARRIMAN if JOHNSON is determined to continue the present
relations with the USSR and BUNDY or perhaps someone comparable but thus far
an unknown politician if he decides to lead the Democratic party to the
elections on a wave of hardfast foreign policy).
