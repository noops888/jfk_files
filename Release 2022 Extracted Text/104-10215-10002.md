(a) Penetration of communist vosen's front.

(e) Information emanating froa university and intellectual

(f) Parallel penetration of ecesmunist party.
(g) Additional sources of information on political movements.

6. The current method (a) of Z between HUMANOID
nd HUMANOID-I1I is not clear to Headquarters. TKEA-108, indicated that
HUMANOID planned to close his Photo shop thus elininating the letter drop and
safe house that had been used Previously for contacts betveen these agentes
TRSA-1215 pointed out that "contact between cut-out (HUMANOID) and egent
(HMANOID-ITI) 18 the veakest security link in the project at this tiee.®

It is expected that the field security survey vill describe present contacts
and communications in sufficient detail to clarify these points and iniicete

of the Post Office is witting of the operation. His permission to intercept
Commnist mail was obtained by HUMMIGID vho indicated to the Director that
"the Asericans" vere interested in comunist literature abd correspondence,
The Direotor himself originally selected the two clerks (HMAHOID-I and
HUMANOID-II) who vere assigned to the task of intercepting mail. Since im

of interest rather than merely comunist correspondence. The station presumes
that this expanded coverage hay, done without the knowledge of the Director.

The alacrity (apparently) vith vhich the Director acceded to BIMABOID's
request, and the assumption that the Director is not avare of the expanded
coverage, suggests possible security hasards which should be considered by the
field station. Of importance is the possibility that the nail intercept 1s a
shared operation. It 4s publicly knom that postal authorities intercept and
Bometines confiscate commnist corresrondence. Costa Rican officials, par~
thoularly the Director of the Fost Office, might willingly provide HUMANOID
Vith corresponience in order to detect the nature of our intelligence interests,

It 18 recasmended that the ebove information be evaluated by the
f1eld station vhen the independent field survey of froject HUMANOID is
undertaken. Portinent oaments should be made regarding the significance
of this information from a security viewpoint.

1. In eumery, it is recamenied that HUMANOID exercise extrens caution
in all of his intelligence activities. Although there is no clearly defined
security problem involved, paragraphs 9 and 10, above, suggest areas of
possible danger.

HUMANOID operation. Coments on the diagram as well as the text of the
