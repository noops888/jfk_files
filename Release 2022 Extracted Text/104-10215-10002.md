(I) Parallal penstration of communist party.

(g) Additional sources of Infarnation on political novemento.

The current nethod (a) of sentaet and simmunications betueen HIMANUID

and HUMANUID Ill 18 not clear to headquarters.

TiSA-1084 1n11cated that

FURANOID planned to close his photo shop thus eliminating the letter drop and

safe house that had been used previously for contacts betreen those agento.

IRSA-1215 pointed out that "contact between cut-out (HUMIDID) and agent

(HUMANOID-III) 18 the veakest security link 1n tho project at this tlza."

It is expooted that the fleld security survey vill describo present contaoto

and conmunications in sufficient dstall to clarify those points and indiesto

18 the security risk involved has been recoved or reasonably mininisod.

To Contact and communisation betueen HUANOID and the postal intercept

agente appears to be reasonabiy secure, doutver, it 18 noted that the Dirootor

.af the Post Office 1s witting of the operation.

His permission to Intercopt

communist nail vas obtained by HIMliÜlD ho indicatod to the Director that

"tbo Anerloans" vere interestod in commundat literature and correspondence.

The Direotor himself ariginally selectod the tuo clerks (auMANOID I and

HUNOID-II) who vere assigned to the task of intercepting mall. Since 1n

seption of the operation coverego has gradually increased to cover asy na1l

of isterest rather than merely communist correspondence, The station presuses

that this expanded coverage has dens vithout the knouledge os the Director.

The alacrity (apparently) with uhich the Director acceded to HUNABOID's

request, and the assumption that the Director 18 not avaro of the expandod

coverage, suggests possible security hasards which should be considered by the

Meld station.

Of Importance 1s the possibility that the inll Intercopt 1e a

shared operation.

It is publicly known that postel authoritles intercept and

Bonetimes confiscato communist correspondence. Costa Rican officlals, par-

toularly the Director of the Post Office, night willingly provide HUMANOID

of additional agents and the creation of additional nets. It EUMsilD's

out out functions vere to be extonded to such additional sets, thare is tha

possibility that compraise of this ose toy Individual vould jeopardize

virtually all our operations in the area.

It Is ricolmended that this natter be considered by the station 1f

and uben any additional sets are crested. Consideration should be riven to

the rectultment of additional cutouts in order to avoid over dependence on

a single agent.

9. In March 1951 a tocanical survelllande vas condueted on an Individual
