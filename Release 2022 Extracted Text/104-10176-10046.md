S. It is believed that the trial of Masferrer or
any of his colleagues could damage Agency interests in
one or all of the following sectors:

@. Unfavorable publicity concerning

. Agency operations against the Cuban target, #
motably maritime infiltration operations “~~ “~‘-**°""7 ot *
based in southern Florida.

b. The exposure of current Agency” ~ a)
Q@rinarily JMWAVE) agents, operational
facilities, covers and operations, idotably ~~~
those in the maritime infiltration field.

c. The creation of a climate which
“fm the long run could lead to comtinuing

Gamage to Agency interests and rhich would |
Fender the execution of operations against ©
Cuba and certain sther targe especially
tho Caribbean countries, more difficult and
more costly (by virtue of the necessity of
creating new or more complex cover nechanians).

G6. The appearance of certain individuals st the trial

Significant amount of information concerning sensitive
carrent activities. While to the knovledeable person,
Within the Agency or within the federal Community in Miams,
Cabeza‘s information is likely to be unimpressive, there
weens to de little doubt that he could--as he has done on
mumber of occasions during the past two years-—preseat
@ picture of JNWAVE activity which might intrigue the
@emeral public. It is impossible to predict whether Cabeza
would present the Agency im a unfavorable light or whether

be would choose to concentrate his criticien against other
federal agencies. o

Concerning various Agency activitios, including JMHAYE

It 1s impcesible to state how mch accurate information

predict the alaat which might be taken by then ta preseating
their stories, {5 the opinion of JHVAVE, on the-basis of
the taformaticn available to the Station, none of these
individuals possesses a significant amount of censitive
iaformation concerning current or important past activities,

Tro of those individuals are curreatly employed by JMWAVE,
Bhould certain of the cther individuals be summoned to teetity,
they could present a certain azvunt of information coacerning
past prectices, personnel and facilitice «ced by JMWAVE.

9. Probably the greatest danesr to tho Agency lies in
the poesidiiity that tae circle Of tostiecay might be expanded
by the dotense through the aubpoonsing of persons who are not

that tee dauger to JKUAVE activities, aotably but sot

SMWAVE/JMOCZAN, In summary it is'sost unlikely thet aay
future good would result from a tricl of Masferrey aad/or -
any of his associates, and it is highly probable that there
would be created a climate which would make JuWAVE
operations—-of all types--aore difficult to carry.out ip

& secure and economical manner, This is not to say that
WEAVE would have to go out of business, This was not the
ease in the "Zenith" flap, nor is it likely to be the case
with Masferrer. Howover, there appears to be little doubt
that the threshold ./ sensitivity:to Agency activities on
the part of the general public and of those persoas who,
from whatever motives, question the advisability of the
Agency “operating” withia the 0.8, would be raised.

11, The question of using Cosar Diosdado as a
prosecution witness presents additional probless. Diosdado
has been r ned as the Customs officer at Koy Vest at
the request of the .,;sncy, Tho Agency reimburses Cuctoss
for Dicsdado's salasy, Because of bis encyclopedic knowledge
of Cuba aad the Florida Keys ares and becausy of his long
fevolvenent in “operational activities” by the Agency, and
by ACSI.on occasion, Uicadado 1g considered by many exties-
end sone officizia--an being “a Company (Agency) man.” If
Questioned under oath Uivedade presumab:y would bave to
Yeveal details of his neeociation with the Agency, actions
taken on benalf of the Agency, and conceivably cetaila of
SMUAYE operatioas, In certain instances, notably regarding
ocurreéat operations and ceveral highly sensitive past
operations, the revoiation of detailed information, especially
concerning agont 1 tities end. operational techaiques, crulé
be quite damaging, Vucaibly Diosdado could be carefully
briefed concerning the nature of his teatisoay so a8 to avoid.
perjury while not uiving sengitive Gata, Huwever, his nature
fis euch that a reasonably clever defense counsel could provoxe
bin into oither indiscretions or contradictions whica would

resent hin, the U.4, Customs and the Agency in sa uafavorable
ight. The fact that Diosdado his been repeatedly commended
by Custous and exiled for his efficient and huzase handling
of refugees and s#anyees would count for little in a court-

room where the emotions of the Masferrer fisaco would be
punaing high. z

12, A further problea could arise from the fact that
Dlosdado played # leading role in the investigation of the
Mastorrer affair, invluding previous abortive attempts by
the Masferrer and Haitian exiles to launch operations from
Floris, and the feat that iosdado yersonally (acting is
his official capacity as Customs Agent resident at Key heat)

Srfeetes ond tne «res confiscated. The defense might well
accuse Diosdado of having acted not only for the 0.3,
Customs but also on behalf of the Agency.

13. Im addition to the foregoing points it should be
moted that historically the siailarity of this operation
aad the "Bay of Pigs” could reopen the whole question and
offer a new discussion of the prisoser exchaace question.
‘The racial iseve also might arise because many of the persons
Amvolved with Masferror and potential defencasts are of the
Megro race. If Masferrer is brougst te trial, the public
@yupathy, which will probably be reflected in the jury's
verdict would undoubtedly rest with the defencoat aot. the
prosecution. 4 large percentage of the people esdoubtedly
view Masferrer’s activities as efforts to rid the testera

imteation of using Haitian territory as 8 base te remove
another dictator neither ef whom ars friendly to the U.S,
