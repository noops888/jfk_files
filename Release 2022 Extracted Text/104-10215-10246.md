I oa
rom t chier Mr Station, tanenad :

GENERAL « Operational - W1U2s

of Headquarters the merits of granting Vaivada stcif status either
concurrently with the :romotion or as soon thereafter as may prove fezsible.

Hl REFSs (a) HKiiw:1607, 30 March 1956 af
! (b) HKH-W-1505, 28 December 1955 i
eo Regarding reference (a) the Station concurs fully with the proposed promotion
t of Arthur G. Vaivada and desires also at this time to bring to the attention
1

2. The agent himself has expressed a keen interest in acquiring such status,
for a mmber of obvious reasons. As a contract agent, Veivada has not been
entitled ‘to the standard step increases that accrue to regular GS enployees .
Moreover he has not had the benefit of recent legislative increases in basic
salary rates, such tia his salary, originally set 16 August 1954 ot the then
GS-9 level, is still $5060.CO per anmum, Perhaps of more importance than
the foregoing considerations is the fact thet this egent has been and is =
losing out in terms of the retirement, health insurance, and other more lonz-
term advantaces availetle to steff personnel. The agent has several times
expressed to the case officer his concern, as a family man, over the fact that”
_... he ds not receiving retirement credits with his years of service. 'Vaivada's |
expressed career interests lie in contimed employment by KUBARK, nore
especially in the area of| assignments in the field, and in
view of his qualities of character and nigh level of performance for KUBARK
the Station has no hesitetion in recommending to Headquarters that he be
awarded the desired caenge in status.

Be In view of the agent's present salary level it is recommended‘that the
Pronotion from his sresent grade be to the equivalent of a GS-10 at a per
————anmun._salary_of_¥5,915.00._.If_Headcuarters_concurs_in_the-recommendation-
that the agent be granted staff officer stews, | “the age

Dear Nr. Wilzus,

As a student of economics with speci!
wrote you in the letter dated 17 ™
through your orranization for cont mins #
of Habena in Cuba, I should line to begi

tion ebout obtaining 2 scholer
wvides in economics et the Unive
work there for. the schovl yoar 1954-1955.

hs to my ruelifications, I have attended the School. of Economics Sciences at the
University of Costa Rica from 1949 thr: In all uy previous courses I
have done above eversge, as can be ottested by the schosls’ concerned,

My present desire is to continue zy study of economics at the University

of Habana for one year, or as lon~ as it may be deened necessary to obtain a
Bachelor of Science derree in economies, I am elso interested in the possibility
of having the scholarship renewed at the end of the period, so thet I may be

able to begin yraduate work in economics. Because I am a ‘marricd :zon with two
small children, I would like to inow whether the scholarship granted would be
svfficient to cover the eost of good and housine in addition to tuition, books, and
the normal ucademte expenses, which I estinate to be about $3000.60 annually.

4s to my personal history, I am a United States citizen and shall be 32 years
old in June, I have served in the United States Army!and Air Force between 1940

and 1949, with the exception of an eiht month period!in 1945 and 1946. The areas in
which I Served are India end Burma in World ler II, and’ Panama after 1946, Because
of my long residence in Panama and Costa Rica I ‘speak Spanish fluently, as does my

. wife who is ,of Costa Rican nationality. As mentioned before, I have two young

_ children born in 1949 and 1951 respectively.

_____I_realize_the.above_information_may_be-insufficient- in-order. to-determine whether.

Tuctor’s Comments:

“" VAIVADA appears ‘to be a hard, conscientious worker. He 1s quick and
: alert of mind and possesses maturity of judgment. Subject stadied the
: training material with enthusiasm and expressed the desire to improve
himself, VAIVADA displayed an excellent understanding of tradecraft
techniques as portrayed in his written work. He has the ability to apply
theory to practice, His goal was to improve himself to the best of his
ability, as his past experience in th ad been on a trial and
error basis, His experience might account for his
s*, unhurried thinking and action, but it will undoubtedly assiat him in his
future operations as he simply refuses to become ruffled or panicky, It
- is the belief of this instructor that VAIVADA is well qualified for his
““~“proposed field assignment. :

VEXORANDUM FOR: Record

SUBJECT : Project HUMANOID

1, 4 total of €5934.00 was originally requested for this project
for the period 1 March 52 to 28 February 53. Tre amount actually
approved vas $£000,00 (Form No. 51-91, project folder).

2. $5100.00 of tne approved amount was to provide for the compen- i
sation of four agents who were to be reimbursed as follows:

H : HUMANOID 1600.00 (colones) 4;

 eseeeete HUVANOID-2 150.00( "  ) 7

j HUMANOID-2 250,.00( " ) és
HURANOID-3 gc0.00( "_ )

: 3. The funding requirements for agent salaries were calcubted
! (by the Headquarters case officer, Jat a rate 8 to 1 (e.g.,
"* HUMANOID was to receive [1600.00 or §200.00 per ronth).

4, However, the ‘rate of exchange has fluctuated since the original
funding estimates were made. The present rate is 6.63 to 1. Accordingly,
“the monthly pay scale for HUMANOID in U. S. currency would be approxi-
mately $241.00 (or| 1600.00). The pay scales of the other agents are
sinilarly effedted.—

5. This situation was explained to the Budget office __—| |
extension 2017) and the Plans office I stated that
dollar expenditures would be in excess of the amounts provided in the
project if we were to coritinue payments to the agents at ti

rates previously established. informed me that we could

“ nonetheless continue the present ||pay scale. He further advised
that budgetary adjustments could be made at a later date when it became
evident that the project allotment would definitely be exceeded dus to
currency fluctuations. A project amendment is not then require

this time. The station may be advised to continue payments | ]
in the amounts shown in-paragraph 2, above.
