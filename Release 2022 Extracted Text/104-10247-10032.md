2, In response to a request from (Paris) ANWHIP-)
was given a security briefing for his trips to Europe,
We paid particular attention to the need for security .
consciousnes¢"Whi le telephoning his KUBARK contacts at
the varicu: gebassies in Europe. iWe stressed France in
Particular it had been this Stationwhich reported a
certain laxity in AMWHIP-1's security practices in
Paris. AMWHIP-1 appreciated the advice and guidance

him in more secure Places than his hotel room, where
apparently the Majority of the AMWHIP-1/Roberto meetings
take place. We stated we would take this up with Roberto
in Paris prior to ASWHIP-1's Projected trip during the
week of 21 March,

3. It was also su ested to AMWHIP-1 that due to
the sensitivity of tHE GNSNAFU-to CA operation he was

about to undertake, he forego meeting any KUBARK staffers
in Europe during his forthcoming trip. He was told he

should contact only Roberto in Paris since this had been
specifically requested by Roberto and his meetings with
Roberto should be kept to a minimum, Any information he

4, ASWHIP-1 was asked if he knew Garcia Bango (GB)
whom-we described as a lawyer, 33 years old, who had just
arrived in Madfid and claimed that he had a message
obviously coming from. AMLASH-1 or members of his group.
AMWHIP=! replied that he ‘knew GB who had been a friend -
of AMLASH-1"s_ for, the t twenty years, ANWHIP-1 stated

2]

GB corresponded pretty well with that forwarded in (ADR) 3486
<CIN 24295). . AMWHIP-1 stated it was possible, but not

probabié, that GB had been sent by the ANLASH.group to (5-e
convey the message as indicated in the forementicned (MADR)

- cable, ANWHEP-I-further stated he felt GB would be

Gee

personally loyal to AMLASH-1 in spite of any DSE suggestion
to the contrary. (This again is a feeling which AMWHIP-1
had and is not to be taken as gospel.) He also mentioned
the brother of GB, Jorge, on whom there are a number of
traces at Headquarters.

5, AMWHIP-1 also discussed the contents of a letter
received fram AMLASH-2. The essential part of this letter
plus a telephone Gall from ANLASH-3 from Madrid was that
AMLASH-3 was somewhat upset by the fact that he was having
difficulty in getting a visa for the U., S. and/or the
Dominican Republic. ASIWHIP-1 then spent considerable
time discussing the treatment of AMLASH-2 and AMLASH-3 in
Qadri by KUBARK, He said he felt that AMLASH-2 and
'AMLASH-3 should be contacted by KUBARK and treated and
handled well, If this were done, they would both serve a

“very useful purpose for KUBARK ends both in Europe and in

Cuba. The undersigned told AMWHIP-1 that we essentially
agreed with his position and would take up the matter with
our superiors when we returned tq Washington. On the
matter of the visa for AMLASH-3, we pointed out that we
could ‘not intercede for “AMLASH-3 in either case because it
would be compromising to him. To illustrate the point we
explained that both governments knew that AMLASH-3 was a
Captain in-the Rebel Army and had up until recently been
working actively for a ministry of the Cuban Government

and therefore considered a Cuban official working in behalf
of the Castro Government. As such AMLASH-3, or anyone in
that position, would not be entitled to enter either country
under normal circumstances, We pointed out that theCuban
Government in all probability knew of this; and, if AMLASH-3


.. that the marriage:

succecded easily in entering cither country, this would
be a rather obvious indication to the Cuban DSE that
-AMLASH-3 must be cooperating with one oF the other govern-
ment, AMWHIP-1 accepted the explanation and felt it
would be readily understandable and a good excuse to give

‘to AMLASH-3.

6, AMWHIP-1 also talked at length on the subject of

AMBIDDY-1 and AMLASH-1. He repeated his previous position
£ AMBIDDY-1 and ANLASH-1 would rood

no good, that ‘annecessary number of people now know of
AMLASH-1's plans, and that AMLASH-1 himself was ‘very_

skeptical of the arrangement with ANBIDDY-1, Furthermore,
as a result of this, he is somewhat unsure of his position

vis-a-vis ODYOKE.

7. AMWHIP-1 said he would advise us of his exact
departure date in the.event we had any further instructions
for him, The meeting terminated at 1520 hours. There were
no incidences of a security nature to report. .
