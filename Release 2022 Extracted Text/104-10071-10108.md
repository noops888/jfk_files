22 August 1962.

His wife, described as Christine DAVIRON in your

still a French citizen, having abandoned her

residence in the USA in 1966.

She was born as Marie

Christine Madeleine Therese DAVIRON (apob: 23 October

1937,

Villefranche-sur-fer, France), daughter of Raoul

Michel Alfred DAVIRON (born at Agneux (Manche), France) .

In the event that information should come to notice

tending to link her or her husband to Soviets or to leftist
