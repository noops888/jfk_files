Robert J. and Christine KORENGOLD

a

Dear John,

1. Reference is made to our No. 4138, dated 4 Hay 1971
and memorandum attached thereto.

2. Additional research reflects that:

a. The American journalist "Bud" KORENGOLD is Robert
James KORENGOLD (dpob: 4 September 1929, Minneapolis,
Minn.). The marriage did take place in Moscow, but on
22 August 1962.

b. His wife, described as Christine DAVIRON in your
JT/7183, dated 17 February 1971 (Subject: Maurice
DEJEAN), has been documented as Marie Christine KORENGOLD;
she is still a French citizen, having abandoned her
residence in the. USA in 1966. She was born as Marie
Christine Madeleine Therese DAVIRON (dpob: 23 October
1937, Villefranche-sur-Mer, France), daughter of Raoul
Michel Alfred DAVIRON (born at Agneux (Manche), France).

3. In the event that information should come to notice
tending to link her or her husband to Soviets or to leftist
or so-called "peace" groups, we should appreciate being advised.

Yours,

vinond G. Rocou
