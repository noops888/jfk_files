1. HELS 2067 (no copy fcr GARATI's file) reported that one
"7edor Alekseyevich SHCHERBAKOV" visited Helsinkd on TDY.

2, There were no hdq traccs on this name, but because the first
name and patronymic were the same as GARANIN's, and because the
physicdl description of SHCHERBAKOV resembled GARANIN slightly, traces

on GARANIN were sent to Helsinki.
2. SHOHERBAKOV has since been identified as Fedor Alekseyevich

SHCHERBAK, subject of 20}-161,163.
