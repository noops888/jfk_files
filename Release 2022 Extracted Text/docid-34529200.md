REPORT OF FINDINGS

(LISTED CHARACTER REFERENCE) On 24 October 1968, Ramona Rodriguez,
Housewife, Apartment 4E, 905 East 167th Street, Bronx, New York, was
interviewed in her residence concerning Manuel MARTI. Source who has known
SUBJECT since 1951 stated substantially as follows:

Source met SUBJECT and HIS parents as neighbors in 1951 when
Source moved into the apartment across from SUBJECT at 905 East 167th Street,
Bronx, New York. Source became a close friend of SUBJECT'S mother and saw
SUBJECT daily until HIS family moved from the building in 1965. Source
continued to visit SUBJECT'S mother after 1965 and until her death in early
1967. Source had not seen SUBJECT since the funeral of HIS mother in 1967.

Source had no knowledge of SUBJECT's birthplace since HE was
approximately six years of age when they first.met. Source knew SUBJECT'S
parents as Manuel and Reyes Marti. HE has an older brother, Ivan, and a
younger sister, Blanca. SUBJECT was brought up in a very respectable home,
and HIS parents exercised very strict control over the children. SUBJECT
graduated from high school in Bronx, New York, shortly before HE and HIS
parents moved from the neighborhood, further details unknown. Source had
no knowledge of SUBJECT'S employment.

SUBJECT is a quiet, friendly, serious-minded young man of excellent
character and personal behavior. HE was never known to be adversely
involved with law enforcement agencies. HIS parents were very strict and
watchful over the upbringing of SUBJECT and HIS brother and they were not
allowed to roam the streets or participate in any neighborhood gang activi-
ties. Most of SUBJECT'S free time from school was spent at home with HIS
studies, and with HIS hobbies of stamp collection, and HIS pet birds and
fishes. Source believed that SUBJECT'S father worked in a-factory, further
details unknown, and was never known to operate HIS own business. HIS
parents were never heard to speak badly about the United States and its
democratic institutions, and Source was of the opinion that SUBJECT was
brought up as a loyal United States citizen. SUBJECT is a mature, emotionally
stabi@ young man, and because of HIS home training Source was of the opinion
that HE would be financially responsible. SUBJECT was not known to have any?
organizational affiliations, nor to have traveled outside of the United
States. HE is honest, trustworthy and dependable, and has manifested no
undesirable social habits. Source suggested luisa Perez, 905 East 167th
Street, Bronx, New York, as a friend of SUBJECT's family. She was unable
to suggest other persons in the neighborhood who would have knowledge of
SUBJECT since most of the people presently residing in the apartment building
moved there since SUBJECT moved away in 196
