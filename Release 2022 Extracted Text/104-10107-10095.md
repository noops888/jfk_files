raised relative to the relationship between (Roberts and Itkin.

when did LEGLOBE become aware that Itkin and the

meetings with Roberts) that he had been developing some potential

on company date est the united State a ter

no later

than 27 October 1966. We cannot say that we then knew the

individual names of those involved. It was not uncommon for

3 Roberts to have discussions with a number of potential clients;

when it became apparent' that no real business was forthcoming

from this group, our interest ceased.

January meeting, we were also asked certair

questions about Roberts financial involvement with the law fir

he and Itkin has been with prior to Robert's association with

the Agency.

per week for that period.
