Dearest Chris,

Funny you should have written me asking if I had ever heard

about Manuel Rey -- he has been

of interest to me

in my work

for nearly a year --

so here is all you ever wanted to know

but were afraid to ask.

Manuel Ray Rivero was born in Cuba in 1924.

He has

been described

as

softspoken, unassuming, almost humble --

a natural leader of the highest

intellect, deepest sincerity

2

and conviction.

In 1947, because of his outstanding performance

as a civil engianer, he was granted a scholarship by the Cuban

Ministry of Public Works to pursue graduate studies in engineering

at the University of Utah. Ray was in the United States for

*AnsHout a snot complete his work for a Masters pegree!

When he returned to Cuba, he held various positions in the

engineering field, one of which was Project Mánager for the

construction of the Havana Hilton 'Hotel.'

In May 1957 he organized the Civic Resistance Movement,

which

supervised sabotage and acts of terrorism against the

1(45CA 009005 Outtie)

Batista regime.

Fidel Castro appointed him Minister of

Public works in february 1959 ta paybroke with castro-be-

-cause of his fonmunist comrections.dulin November 1959, Ray

was

sed and relieved of his official position. He then

founded the anti-Castro Movimento Revolucionari

del Pueblo

and served as its Chief. Other individuals completing the

leadership of the MRP were: Raul

Chibas, Special Assistant

to Ray; Juan Esteves Ramires, Secretary; Ramon Barguin,

Military Intelligence Matters;

and Rogelio Cisneros, Chief

of MRP in Cuba.

):

In the Summer of 1960, while still in Cuba, Ray

was

actively recruited by the CIA to become a member of the

FRD.

His background was questioned by the State Department

and the Miami CIA office. Despite their objections, Ray

was granted Provisional Operational Approval by the CIA on

October 25, 1960 and, with the aid of the CIA, he was brought

clandestinely into the United States on November 10, 1960.

Ray's personnel papers at the CIA contain the following

assessment: "Subject has definite political action potential,

is a pro-democratic official

of

government who

is not in

sympathy with

aims of international Communism and

is interested

in strengthening

ties between Cuba and U.s."

Not everyone in the CIA who knew Ray) were in agreement

with this assessment. In a Memo for Record, dated 11/21/60,

it was reported that, "... Ray did not politically represent

anything to cheer about." Another CIA officer who met privately

with him in November 1960 stated that his political posture

was doubtful as far as U.S. Government acceptance was concerned.

CIA official

Still another/assessment of Ray stated that his action all

seemed directed toward making him the future power in Cuba

rather than overthrowing Castro.. It was believed that Ray

was so far "left" in his thinking that he would be as dangerous

(or more so in the long run) to U.S. interests as Castro, if

he ever got to be a power in Cuba.

Ray made his political position very clear during a

private meeting

with a CIA officer on November 15, 1960 - five

days after his

arrival in the U.S.

said that the MRP did

and

not wish to reinstate the 1940 Cuban/ Constitution/that the

Castro laws passed

at the beginning of his regime would be

continued.

Ray further stated that he believed the State

should regulate private investments andutilities should

be nationalized. Charges of

"Fidelismo without Fidel" were

made against Ray's group, the MRP,

because of these "leftist"

ideologies.

Negative information about Ray was also voiced by

→ the Cuban exile community and came to the attention of the

CIA.

He was described by one exile as highly dangerous

because of his ambition to play a prominent role in the Cuban

government afterCastro's overthrow

Miro Cardona was opposed

to him on the grounds that his program

was too Marxist and

further stated that Ray was bitterly anti-American as well

as probably totalitarian in his thinking. Manuel Artime

said the MRP was opposed to banning the Communist Party and

in favor of "nationalizing everything."

Although aware of his controversial political

→ philosophy, the CIA actively recruited Ray to join the ERD.

Painers"?

L The White House and State Department pushed for his inclusion.

Ray received full/operational approval as a "political

asset" on February 7, 1961 and accepted

appointment to the

CRC in March. He himself had resisted joining the CRC be-

cause he felt the members

were too restrained and he did not

want to become a part of a situation in which someone else

was running the show

for the exiles. Within

a week after

agreeing to join, Ray met with a CIA officer and complained

that Miro was backing away from his commitments and was not

willing to give Ray any voice in the Council. He recalled

the events of this period to HSCA investigators in 1978,

stating that certain influential and wealthy Americans,

among them William Pawley, opposed him and a lot of heavy

propaganda was circulated at this time accusing him of being

a Communist.
