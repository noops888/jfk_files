October 24, 1978

Dearest Chris,

Punny you should have written me asking if I had ever heard
about Manuel Rey -- he has been of interest to me in my work
for nearly a year -- so here is all you ever wanted to know
but were afraid to ask.
4d
Manuel Ray Rivero was born in Cuba in 1924. He has

- been described as softspoken, unassuming, almost humble --
a natural leader of the highest intellect, deepest sincerity
and conviction: In 1947, because of his outstanding performance
as a civil engigser, he was granted a scholarship by the Cuban
Ministry of Public Works to pursue graduate studies in engineering
at the University of Utaf. Ray was in the United States for

gf
tw years but did not complete his work for a Masters Degree.

When he returned to Cuba, he held various positions in the

engineering field, one of which was Project dnager for the
construction of the Havana Hilton Hotel * "
In May 1957 he organized the Civic Resistance Movement |
which supervised sabotage and acts of terrorism against the
CHSC 009 00-

Batista regime. Fidel Castro appointed him Minister of

of MRP in Cuba.



In the Summer of 1960, while still in Cuba, Ray

was actively recruited by the CIA to become a member of the

_ be?

FRD. His background was questioned by the St

BTATe Leny
and the Miami CIA office. Despite their objections, Ray

te Department

was granted Provisional Operational Approval by the CIA on
October 25, 1960 and, with the aid of the CIA, he was brought
clandestinely into the United States on November 10, 1960.

Ray's personnel papers at the CIA contain the following
assessment: "Subject has definite political action potential,
is a pro-democratic official of government who is not in
sympathy with aims of international Communism and is interested
in strengthening ties between Cuba and U.S."

Not everyone in the CIA fwho knew Ray)were in agreement
with this assessment. In a Memo for Record, dated 11/21/60,
it was reported that, "... Ray did not politically represent
anything to cheer about." Another CIA officer who met privately
with him in November 1960 stated that his political posture
was doubtful as far as U.S. Government acceptance was concerned.

CIA official

Still another/assessment of Ray stated that his action all
seemed directed toward making him the future power in Cuba
rather than overthrowing Castro. It was believed that Ray
‘was so far "left" in his thinking that he would be as dangerous
(or more so in the long run) to U.S. interests as Castro, if
he ever got to be a power in Cuba.

Ray made his political position very clear during a
private meeting with a CIA officer on Névember 15, 1960 - five
days after his arrival in the U.S. Hf said that the MRP did

and
not wish to reinstate the 1940 Cuban/onstitution/that the


Castro laws passed at the. bdginning of his regime would be

continued. Ray further statéd that he believed the State

should regulate private investments andjutilities should

/

be nationalized. Charges of/"Fidglismo without Fidel" were

made against Ray's group, fhe MRP, Necause of these “leftist”
ideologies.

Negative information about Ray was also voiced by

“the Cuban exile community and came to the attention of the

CIA. (Be was described by one exilé as highly dangerous

because of his ambition to play a prominent. role inthe, Cuban\/
Whe Ae”

“government afterCastro's overthrow. Miro Cardona was opposed

to him on the grounds that his program was too Marxist and
further stated that Ray was bitterly anti-American as well

as probably totalitarian in his thinking. Manuel artime o “
said the MRP was opposed to banning the Communist Party and
in favor of "nationalizing everything."

Although aware of his controversial political

y philosophy, the CIA actively recruited Ray to join the FRD.

yest
\,The White House and State Department pushed for his inclusion.

CIA
Ray received full/operational approval. as a "political

asset" on February 7, 1961 and accepted appointment to the
CRC in March. He himself had resisted joining the CRC be-
cause he felt the members were too restrained and he did not
want to become a part of a situation in which someone else
was running the show for the exiles. Within a week after
agreeing to join, Ray met with a CIA officer and complained
DAA tae litanae te)

that Miro was backing away from his commitments and was not

willing to give Ray any voice in the Council. He recalled



the events of this period to HSCA investigators in 1978,
stating that certain influential and wealthy americans,

among them William Pawley, opposed him and a lot of heavy
Propaganda was circulated at this time accusing him of being

a Communist,
