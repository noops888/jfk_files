2022 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992

VUNCIULITINE

â€¢MEMORANDOM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT:

HUNT, Everett Howard, JI.

#23500

18 Apr11 1963

1. On 16. April Mr. Winters discussed the case of the Subject

with the writer, in particular a Memorandun for the Record prepered

by Hunt and a Routing Sly from Mr. Hamerman to Mr. Winters dated

15 April suggesting a letter to the Assistant Deputy. Director of

Plans. Hunt's Memorandum for the Record clearty reflerted his wife

had procured some material prepared by the Spanish 'Ambassador, had

turned this intelligence over to her husband who had, in turn, brought

It to W. Iloyd George, Chief, FI Staff; George took the material to

DDP for consideration.

2. The situation referred to above could clearly lead to serious

embarrassment to the Agency as lt 1s apparent Mrs. Hurt is engaging in

intelligence collection in the United States - without any official

sanction for such activity.

The writer suggested to Mr.. Winters that this entire situa-

1on was one ve had anticipated when ve wrote a letter for Col, Edwards'

signature denying permission to lunt for his wife's employment by the

4 Spanish Ambassador. Mr. Winters readily recalled his own memorandun

relative to.a call fron Funt seeking advice on whether or not his

wife should register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act due

to her "translation work in her home for the Spanish Embassy'.

(Memorandum Of DD/PPS, 8 February 1963.)

4. Both Mr.. Winters and the writer were concerned that trang-

mission of the letter through Tracy Barnes to Tom Karamessines might

really "stir up" all sorts of problems, it was not apparent how the

Security Officer of DODS, J. R. Murphy, had obtained & copy of Hurt's

Memorandum for the Record on & matter that had been handled on ex-

tremely high levels In the DDP complex. It was decided that, before

a letter be prepared in accord with Mr. Bannerman's instructions,

It might be well to touch base with lloyd George for a "reading"

on whether or not it was intended Mrs. Hunt be used operationally

in her present employment position.

5. On 17 April the writer secured an appolutment with Mr.

George.at 4:15 PM. At the outset the writer Informed the C/FI

In November 1902 Col. Edwards had.

Hunt had Indicated to Gene Winters his. wife would take - or had

taken - the employment concerned.

Mr. George was further Informed

of the element of embarrassment we saw in this situstion and which

led us to disapprove Hunt's request In the f1rst place and was also

Informed that, should It be desired.Mrs. Hunt be used operatiomally,

coordination In this regard would probably have to be effected with

the FBI.

6. In commenting on the above Mr. George stated he had not

been made aware previously that the Office of security had dis-

approved any request from Hunt concerning his wife's employment

and that he considered all of the points put forward by the writer

on behalf of the Office.of Security to be valid and well taken.

He asked that Mr. Bannerman be inforned that he sould now take up

a meeting on the matter to include a representative of the Office

of Security In order that allfacets of the situation be fully

explored. He requested that he be given 48 hours - and then said

by the end of the week - within which to arrange matters with the

DDP and requested further that Security not send through 1ts letter

on this matter until the proposed meeting could be had. He left

the writer with the definite impression that M's. Hunt might well

be of operational value to the Agency in that she has progressed

the point where she is writing speeches for

many things this Agency might desire be emnciated.

The writer

agreed to pass this information and request to Mr. Bannerman.

T. Mr. Winters was briefed on the situstion and stated he would

inform the Deputy Director of Security of Mr. George's requests and

of the expected turn of events in this case.

8. (The writer did not inform Mr. George of how the Office of

Security receiyed 1ts Information concerning the activities of Mrs.

Hurt-referred to in the Memorandum for the Record prepared by the

subject.. After MI. George indicated he was unaware of what Mi. Helm

aad done with the paper following their discussion of Mrs. Hunt'

activities and, further, that he had heard from Hunt that DODS officials

seemed to be fully aware of the situation, the writer did tell Mr.

George we had learned of a memorandum for the record prepared by Mr. Hunt

and that this memorandum and 1ts content was the basis for the writer's
