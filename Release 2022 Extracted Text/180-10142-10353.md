of the letter, Mr. Piccolo indicated that he fully understood the letter's .

meaning. Mr. Berk then explained to Mr. Piccolo the mandate and: purposes

of the Select Committee.

Mr. Piccolo stated that at the time of President Kennedy's assassination

he was a support assistance analyst in the DDO. His responsibilities
included maintenance of records, running of traces, and Spanish language
analysis for purposes of operational support. Subsequent to this position
Mr. Piccolo undertook training during the spring of 1964 to become an
operations officer. Mr. Piccolo further stated that his professional
areas of interest were mainly concerned with Latin America. He also in-
dicated that he served in th CIA's Mexico City Station from Decenber
1957 to January 1960 and from August 1965 to January 1968.) It was further

Cuban counterpart for external security and counter-intelligence operations.

Mr. Piccolo stated that he did not participate in the initial handling
and debriefing of A/1 but became involved in this case during the summer of
1964 when he first met A/1. At that time, Mr. Piccolo was assigned to
"handhold" A/1; i.e., to ensure that A/1 was properly accomodated and
escorted and to provide companionship for A/1.

Mr. Piccolo recalled that A/1 had been debriefed[in Canada fafter his
defection. He stated that the objectives’ of the initial debriefings would
have been to gain biographic data on persons associated with the Cuban
Intelligence Service and information on persons who might collaborate
with the CIA. He indicated that he ceased contact with A/1 prior to 1966
and the last information he had was that A/1 was residing infitiani, J
Florida and was adjusting well to life in this country.

As for the filing of the debriefing reports, Mr. Piccolo said the
filing procedure would habe been dictated by the manner in which the case
was handled; i.e., by subject or cryptonym or personality. He did state
that debriefing reports would hal initially been held in the office
handling the case. ‘These repos would half been "held tight" to allow
time for operations to be developed while security risks BEE at a minimum.
However, ho
"WA Mr. Piccolo said he did know where such debriefing reports would now
be located.

Me. Piccolo later became responsible for debriefing A/l. Mr. Piccolo
was not able to recall the exact time period during which he debriefed
NL Bhi ds contin ea ee to six month period. Mr. Piccolo stated that

Piccolo Interview, Page 3.

CIA component responsible for the A/l case. He indicated that this component,
whose chief wag Harold swenson worked against the CUIS. He further indi-
cated that WH/SAS/CI, to carry out its function, probably ran double agent
operations.

Mr. Piccolo was next queried whether he recalled a CIA component
referred to as the "domestic exploitation section". Mr. Piccolo stated
that this terminology was not familiar to him but that domestic exploitation
would most likely have been located in a positive intelligence section of
the Agency such as the Domestic Contacts Division. He did state, however, -
that recruitment or contact of persons in this country for utilization in
foreign operations would have been the responsibility of every operations
officer. He doubted that the Western Hemisphere Division would have run
such an office but that operational recruitment would hale been handled
as part of a specific project or program.

Mr. Piccolo was queried whether A/1 providied any information to the
CIA on Lee‘'Harvey Oswald and his possible contacts with the DGI. He
responded that he recalls no A/1 debriefing reports providing such infor-
mation nor did A/1 provide such information to him. Mr. Piccolo further
declared wna nssrs. Swenson, Hidalgo, and Flores) never indicated to him
that A/1 had ever provided any information on Lee Harvey Oswald.

Mr. Piccolo was next queried as to the meaning of the term "Special
Intelligence." He indicated that the term usually applies to the inter-
ception of communications, e.g., signal intelligence which would include
radio waves and radar but would not have included electronic surveillance.
Mr. Piccolo further stated that special intelligence would haife been

handled by "Division o special unit segregated from other agency
