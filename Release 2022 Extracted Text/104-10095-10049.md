OUR ENEMIES, REDUCE UTILITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF ONGOING
OPERATIONS AND EXPOSE NEW LOPEZ PORTILLO ADMINISTRATION To
BARRAGE OF QUESTIONING ABQUT COOPERATION-WITH Cm, WHE THER
SUCH COOPERATION STILL CONTINUING AND So FORTH.

4, IN OUR JUDGMENT ANY SUCH OFFICIAL REVELATION OF
GUINT OPERATIONS WITH CTATSOM MAY EFFECTIVELY TERMINATE
amachceR AND SIMILAR ACTIVITIES, IN THIS CONNECTION SEE
MEXICO CITY a ee WHICH REFERS #0 PROBLEM
WE MAY ALREADY BE FACING WITH NEW MINISTER OF GOVERNMENT,
(1T SHOULD GE REMEMBERED THAT TELEPHONE TAPS IN MEXICO ARE
UNCONSTITUTIONAL,) AS MINIMUM, OFFICIAL STATEMEN® ABOUT
SUINT OPERATIONS” WOULD CONFIRM THE WRITINGS OF PHIL AGEE
AND JOSEPH SMITH,

5, IT ALSO SEEMS TO US THAT SUCH STATEMENT WOULD BE
IN VIOLATION OF QUR OBLIGATION TO PROTECT SOURCES AND METHODS,
IF AGENCY CAN RELEASE INFO ON SENSITIVE SOURCES AND METHODS,
AND PUBLICIZE PAST OPERATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH SPECIFIC
INDIVIDUALS, IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE ON WHAT GROUNDS WE COULD
GRITIZE THOSE WHD MAKE SIMELAR PUBLICATIONS FOR ¥HEIR OWN-
PURPOSES, WHICH TO THEM, MAY SEEM EQUALLY LEGITIMATE,

6. IN SUM, WE BELIEVE THAT ANY PUBLIC DISCLOSURE
ALONG THE LINES DF PARA FOUR OF REF WILL GET US INTO EVEN
MORE TROUBLE THAN WE ARE IN AT PRESENT. WE VOLUNTEER JUDGMENT
THAT WE ARE IN THE TROUBLE WE ARE IN BECAUSE AT TIMES IN PAST
WE SEEM TO HAVE FORGOTTEN THAT WE ARE AND SHOULD BE AN
INTELLIGENCE AGENCY. PROPOSED REVELATION oF CYAYSON—
RELATIONSHIP, OOINT OPS AND AGENT TRUE NAMES WOULD CAUSE
WIDE*SPREAD SKEPTICISM THAT WE ARE IN FACT INTELLIGENCE

AGENCY. Er2y IMPDET.
