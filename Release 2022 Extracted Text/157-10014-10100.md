TOP SECRET

A "special" NSC meeting was held on this’ day:
The only record of this meeting in the NSC
minutes states: "On instructions from the
Executive Secretary no memorandum was written."
(NSC Minutes)

Special Group approves evaluation of agents
for Cuban sugar mill sabotage. GRAY "discussed
this matter with his associate" (Eisenhower)
and reported two tactical objections.

(SG Minutes)

GRAY tells Special Group that any covert-action
like sugar mill sabotage should be undertaken
only after overall consideration of "whether
and how the U.S. wishes to move against CASTRO."
(SG Minutes)

At an NSC meeting, Allen DULLES "reported that

a plan to affect the situation in Cuba was being
worked on. Admiral BURKE suggested that any

plan for the removal of Cuban leaders should be

a package deal, since many of the leaders around
CASTRO were even worse than CASTRO (NSC Minutes)

At a Special Group meeting, after a paper
titled "General Covert Action Plan for Cuba"
was read, there was "a general discussion as
to what would be the effect on the Cuban

scene if FIDEL and RAUL CASTRO: and CHE GUEVARA
should disappear simultaneously. (SG Minutes)

"GRAY asked the [Special] Group's views on what
happens after TRUJILLO, specifically how CASTRO
can be kept out of the Dominican Republic."
Acting DCI CABELL recommends U.S. military inter-
vention after TRUJILLO departs. (SG Minutes)

Issues_and Questions

Why were no minutes written?

Does context. show that phrase “his
associate" refers to President
EISENHOWER?

Did such consideration involve
assassination plotting?

Was this "package deal" the simultaneous
triple assassination plot. that was
mentioned on November 3, 1960?

Does this simultaneous disappearance
plan. refer to assassination planning?

Is there a connection between this
Special Group discussion and the NSC
discussion on March 14, 1960, re a plan
to remove Cuban leaders?

Did U.S, support TRUJILLO'S opponents out
of a desire to keep CASTRO out of the
Dominican Republic?

development for us." (NSC Minutes)

What did NIXON mean by "getting TRUJILLO"? .*

July 21

Allen DULLES reported to the NSC that the
Venezuelan government wants, the United States
to lead the way in breaking relations with
TRUJILLO. DULLES stated: The Venezuelan
government was engaged in an all-out effort,
through the OAS and otherwise, to isolate,
condemn and cause the downfall of TRUJILLO. .
[Because] they have convincing evidence that
TRUJILLO was responsible for the assassination
attempt on BETANCOURT [President of Venezuela]
.. . BETANCOURT believes another attempt will
pe made momentarily and therefore it [his
government ] wants a showdown without delay.

(NSC Minutes)

"

"Mr. DULLES stated that he believes, and the
intelligence community agrees, that the
problem of TRUJILLO must be settled before the
problem of CASTRO can be dealt with, even
though CASTRO is the greater threat."

(NSC Minutes)

The NSC Minutes further state that BETANCOURT
was told that the U.S. cannot act without
ascertaining TRUJILLO'S successor. The U.S.
will work with BETANCOURT and FIGUERES of
Costa Rica on suggestions for a successor to
TRUJILLO. President EISENHOWER suggested that
a government in exile should be ready to go
into the Dominican Republic in the event of
TRUJILLO'S downfall. (NSC Minutes)

GRAY said “his associates" would favor the
development of sabotage operations in CUBA.
(SG Minutes)

Issues and Questions

The U.S..was under pressure to move
against TRUJILLO.

Did TRUJILLO'S attempt against BETANCOURT
make him "fair game" for assassination in
the eyes of OAS nations including the U.S.

Did the U.S. determine a successor?
Did the U.S. “act?

"Associate" is the euphemism for Eisen-

hower.
Does sabotage imply the further steps

of assassination?

President EISENHOWER stated at an NSC meeting:
"Until TRUJILLO is eliminated, we cannot get
our Latin American friends to reach a proper
level of indignation in dealing with CASTRO."
In this regard, "the President said if we
attempted to take any action with respect to
Cuba before settling the TRUJILLO situation,
we would be the loser." (NSC Minutes)

BISSELL outlines 13.3 million dollar budget
for Cuban operations which was to be laid

before "higher authorities" for decision.
(SG Minutes)

Dr. Edward GUNN (CIA Office of Medical
Services) receives box of Cuban cigars to

be treated with lethal poison for use against
CASTRO. (IG REPORT p. 21)

After the Special Group approved anti-LUMUMBA
operations in the Congo, "GRAY commented,
however, that his associates had expressed
extremely strong feelings on the necessity for
very straightforward action in this situation,
and he wondered whether the plans as outlined
would be sufficient to accomplish this ... . It
was finally agreed that planning for the Congo
would not necessarily rule out ‘consideration!
of any particular kind of activity which
might contribute to getting rid of LUMUMBA."
SG Minutes; emphasis added

At the NSC meeting, Mr. STANS suggested that
the U.S. might "throw out LUMUMBA by peaceful
means." (NSC Minutes)

BISSELL asks EDWARDS to find underworld contacts
with Cuba to aid in an assassination operation

Issues and Questions

Does "elimination" mean "assassination"?

Were EISENHOWER , GRAY, or DCI DULLES
aware of this?

Is this circumlocutious order for
assassination from the President? An
indication that at the least, assassina—
tion was within the range of acceptable
means for "getting rid of LUMUMBA"?

During brief discussion of CONGO developments,
"GRAY said that he hoped that Agency people in

At an NSC meeting, Allen DULLES reported
that "five Congolese soldiers had attempted
to assassinate MOBUTO on the 15th of
October. The U.S. had prior information
of this attempt and had warned MOBUTO . . .
(NSC Minutes)

At a Special Group meeting, Mr. MERCHANT
“asked whether any real planning has been done
in taking direct positive action against FIDEL,
RAUL and CHE GUEVARA. He said that without
these three the Cuban government would be
leaderless and probably brainless. He conceded
that it would be necessary to act against all
three simultaneously.

The minutes further state: "General CABELL
pointed out that action of this kind is
uncertain of results and highly dangerous
in_conception and execution, because the
instruments must_be Cuban. He felt that,
particularly because of the necessity of
simultaneous action, it would have to be
concluded that Mr. MERCHANT'S suggestion is
beyond our capabilities." (SG Minutes)

Issues _and Questions

Against LUMUMBA personally?

Did the NSC contemplate "disposing of”
LUMUMBA by assassination?

Did. this information prompt the U.S.
to plot the assassination of LUMUMBA
in retaliation or to protect MOBUTO?

Was MERCHANT referring to an assassina—
tion of Cuban leaders?

Shortly before this, CIA had made the
assassination contract with the Mafia.
Was General CABELL unaware of this CIA
contract? Was General CABELL expressing
a traditional CIA objection to assassina-
tion proposals? If so, on what other
occasion did Mr. GRAY hear the CIA
objection?

the broad outlines of a two-pronged plan

proposed actions would not of themselves
bring about the desired result in the near
future, lacking some decisive stroke against

GORDON GRAY: Short Summary

Gordon Gray was Special Assistant to the President for National Security

Affairs from 1958-1961. During this period Gray represented President —
EISENHOWER at Special Group meetings at which the following subjects

were discussed: "any particular kind of activity which might contribute

to getting rid of LUMUMBA"; provision of small arms to opponents to

TRUJILLO in the Dominican Republic; and detailed planning for "how the

U. S. wishes to move against CASTRO".

Gray's testimony should involve the following questions (see attached
list of exhibits):

CASTRO

1. What was Admiral Burke referring to at the March 14, 1960, NSC meet-
ing when he spoke of "a plan for the removal of Cuban leaders should
be a package deal"? (Exhibit at Tab E)

2. Is there a connection between the plan referred to by Admiral Burke
at the March 14 NSC meeting and the discussion at the March 14
Special Group meeting on the "effect on the Cuban scene if Fidel and —
Raoul Castro and Che Guevara should disappear simultaneously"?
(Exhibit at Tab F)

3. Were President Eisenhower or Mr. Gray aware that on August 16, 1960,
the CIA Office of Medical Services received a box of Cuban cigars to
be treated with poison for use against Castro? (Exhibit at Tab 0)

4, Were President Eisenhower or Mr. Gray aware that in August 1960
Bissell asked Edwards to find underworld contacts with Cuba for an ae
assassination mission? (Exhibit at Tab R)

5. At the November 3, 1960, Special Group meeting, was Mr. Merchant
referring to planning for assassination when he asked whether plan~
ning had been done "in taking direct positive action against Fidel,
Raoul, and Che Guevara"? How does General Cabell's response (that
Merchant's suggestion "is beyond our capabilities") square with the
fact that shortly before November 1960 the CIA had made contact with
the Mafia for a Castro assassination effort? (Exhibit at Tab V)

TRUJILLO
1. Was Vice President Nixon referring to assassination.at the April 14,

1960, NSC meeting when he said "getting rid of Trujillo would be a
favorable development"? (Exhibit at Tab H)

HW 50955 Docld:32493488 Page.15 _


-2-

Was the Special Group, Mr. Gray, or President Eisenhower aware that
Assistant Secretary of State Rubottom was reported, on July 1, 1960,
by the CIA Western Hemisphere Division Chief to have approved delivery
of high-powered rifles with telescopic sights to Trujillo opponents?
(Exhibit at Tab YZ)

When President Eisenhower was reported at the July 28, 1960, NSC meet-
ing to have said that "until Trujillo is eliminated . . .", was he
referring to an assassination? (Exhibit at Tab M)

On January 12, 1961, the Special Group approved making available
"small arms" to dissidents in the Dominican Republic. Were these
assassination-type weapons such as the rifles with telescopic sights

‘referred to in Exhibit at Tab YZ? (Exhibit at Tab X re January 12

meeting)

Did the attempts by Trujillo to assassinate President Betancourt of
Venezuela prompt the Special Group to favor supplying arms to Dominican
dissidents who might try to assassinate Trujillo? (Exhibit at Tab K)_

LUMUMBA

When Mr. Gray commented at the August 25, 1960, Special Group meeting
that “his associates had expréssed extremely strong feelings on the
necessity for very straight-forward action", was he referring to
assassination? Do Mr. Dulles' reservations indicate that he was
objecting to a suggested assassination? (Exhibit at Tab P)

When Mr. Gray said at the Special Group meeting on September 8, 1960,
that “he hoped that agency people in the field are fully aware of the
top level feeling in Washington that vigorous action would not be
amiss", was he referring to assassination of Lumumba? (Exhibit at
Tab S) :

Mr. Gray inquired once more as to the status of planning for
problems which would arise post-Castro. Mr., Merchant said he
would check into the progress of the State Department group which
has been charged with developing recommendations on this matter.

From this the Group launched into a far-ranging discussion of
the entire concept of U.S. efforts against Castro. Mr. Douglas, 1 Hl
supported by Mr. Gray and Mr. Merchant, expounded the idea that i :

perhaps things have now progressed toa point where covert activities

of the type originally envisaged for CLA to undertake will not be effective.
Mr. Douglas referred to the extensive program of the m litia, Mr. Gray
cited the matter of arms from the Soviet bloc, and Mr. Merchant dwelt
on the increasing effectiveness of Castro's measures to control the
populatioa in ways which the Communists have developed so weil. The —
latter said that he and others in the State Department had originally

thought that a popular rebellion would develop within Cuba and that

this could be augmented by the comparatively small-scale efforts of

exiles under GIA control. Now the same people are beginning to feel

more and more that despite the numerous defections and the economic

deprivations being experienced by the middle and upper classes, time

is actually working on Castro's side. Mr. Merchant said that he

foresaw that there would occur a point in time beyond which covert

jmtervention would not do the job. CO Bag

Mr. Gray expressed the opinion that we will never be able to
“clean up" the situation without the use of overt U.S. military force.
He suggested the possibility of using the ClA-backed exiles to-mount a
simulated attack on Guantanamo in order to offer an excuse for overt

intervention. This led to an involved discussion, the 8eneral conclusion
of which was that Such action on our Part would not be desirable, but
that should Castro be foolish enough actually to attack Guantanamo
this would almost certainly mean war. Mr, Gray said that he had had
the subject of Cuba inscribed on the NSC agenda for next Monday in
order to be able to arrive at a top-level decision on this very point,

7 He thought it essential that the policy of the U.S. should be completely
understood by responsible officials, so that any overt Cuban act would
be met with a previously-agreed-on Tesponse,

Mr. Merchant stated that, apart from any attack on Guantanamo,
he thought that some of the previous argumentation in today's meeting
was faulty, in that we could not have it both Ways. By this he meant

and yet that it is feasible for the U.S. to go in overtly and "clean up

‘Turning to the immediate problem before the Group, Gen. Cabell
outlined the general Proposal to establish bases in the U.S., with the
reasons for coming to this conclusion. He cited Specifically the
Possibility of ULN, investigation in Guatemala and the increased scope
of the program, which has been brought about by the increased Strength
of the Castro regime, All members of the Group expressed serious
doubts as to whether such activity could be kept at all secure, Mr.
Merchant said at one point, that although this does not representa
final conclusion on his part, he is inclined to think that the proposal
embodies the worst aspect of both worlds; that is, the choice should
rest between continuing our operations entirely on foreign soil or

associates at the same time Tibet is discussed. Mr, Merchant agreed
that this is where it should end up, but asserted that he is not prepared
to move in that direction until a Survey has been made of the possibilities
of keeping operations in the U.S, unrevealed,

Mr. Douglas said that in any case he would be prepared to have
the Department of Defense investigate the availability of specific
locations that would be suitable.

Finally, Mr. Merchant asked whether any real planning has been
done for taking direct positive action against Fidel, Raul and Che Guevara. /” }
“He said that without these three the Cuban Government would be Ve fr

ow +4, Supply Drops > Cuba

Gen. Cabell explained that the Pinar de Rio supply mission had
not taken place because of the absence of specified communication
from the DZ, and the Escambray operation had been canceled because
of weather. He said that these missions are still planned, and assumed ——
_that the Group had no objections. The members so signified,

Gen. Cabell said that the photographic coverage on the first
flight had been only about 50%, because of cloud cover. He continued
that we are analyzing the exact results on a priority basis and that
some time after the middle of next week we should be in a position to
make recommendations for the missions required to extend the coverage.

Mr. Gray commented somewhat wryly that this was all right with
him since he "would certainly not-be available to discuss anything of
this kind before the middle of next week." The other members appeared
to have the same reaction. :

. Policy Consideration Re Cuban Exiles

Mr. Gray said that Assistant Attorney General Yeagley had spoken
to him after his meeting with Col. King and Messrs, Esterline and
Holman. He had said that the information given to him by the CIA
representatives, and the arrangements for future coordination if
necessary, were entirely satisfactory to him. He had stated, however,
that a problem remains with respect to action the FBI should take;
that is, the FBl needs guidance in its handling of Cuban exile groups
other than those under the direction of CLA.

The Group agreed that the best way to attack this problem would
be to have Mr. Yeagley attend next week's Special Group meeting and
discuss the matter at firsthand. Mr. Parrott was asked to make
arrangements for this, ‘

f
2. Budget for Guban Operations: Mr, Bissell summarized the

budget which bad been prepared ay a basis for seeking a release trom the
Reserve to finance Cuban operations for the balance of the fiscal year.
The budget for the year totals approximately thirteen and a quarter rnillion
dollars, not including provision for the replacement of material with an
estimated value of 1,6 million dollars to be withdrawn from Agency
inventory. Since 2,5 million dollars of budgeted and Reserve funds. have
been made available for this program by an earlier action, the balance
required is about ten and three-quarters million dolars. Mr, Dulles
stated that a release of ten million would be requested at this time since
there is inevitably a wide margin of uncertainty as to what the actual costs
will-turn out to be. Mr. Bissell stated the amounts required by major
sub-headings as follows:

Political Action PSS 960,000.00
Propaganda 2,152, 120,00
Paramilitary 8, 055,753.00

It was agreed that the operations in question must go forward and that

the amount did not seem unreasonable for activities of this scope and

scale but it was understood that Messrs. Merchant and Gray could not

\ state that they had reviewed in any detail the manner im which the
estimates had been arrived at. Following further discussion, it was
agreed that this matter should be laid before the appropriate higher
authorities and a presentation would be arranged hopefully within the
next ten days. This was believed to be wise, not because any actions
involving major political risks were to be taken in the near future, but
because the Agency would soon become committed to various substantial
expenditures which should not be undertaken without reasonable assurance
that the operation was to go forward,

Mr. Bissell notified the Group of plans for five supply drops in

the next three days,

5. Dominican Republic
Mr. Bissell gave the broad outlines of a two-pronged plan for
proceeding with certain limited covert activities directed against the
Trujillo regime. He emphasized that although support would be given
to the Figueres group, there is no intention of establishing a para-
military force as such, since this would be impractical in view of
requirements for Cuba. He also emphasized that the proposed actions
would not of themselves bring about the desired result in the near future,
lacking some decisive stroke against Trujillo himself,

The Group agreed with the proposal as outlined and felt that it
should be mentioned at the Tuesday meeting. It was noted that
Mr. Pawley feels that overt intervention in the Dominican Republic
should be mounted simultaneously with the Cuban operation. The
consensus of the Group was that this would not be entirely consistent.
However, it was agreed that the plan is worth beginning at this time
no matter what the eventual decision on overt intervention may be.

4. Cuba

Mr. Merchant reported a bricf conversation he had had with

Mr. Gray's associates this morning. The latter had made two points:
(a) it would be desirable to obtain the cooperation and support of
individual Latin American governments, (b) it would be desirable, if
possible, for the U.S. to break relations with Cuba, in concert with
other countries, some time before January 20th. :

Mr. Merchant explained the feeling of the Department of State
that limited supplics of small arms and other materiel should be made
available for dissidents inside the Dominican Republic. Mr. Parrott
said that we believe this can be managed securely by GIA, and that
the plan would call for final transportation into the country being

Mr. Dulles and Mr. Parrott outlined generally the results of the

uprising was out of the question then an open invasion by the U.S. would
be met by a hostile population and we would be plunged into a situation
like Algeria.

Turning to the immediate problem before the Group, Gen. Cabell
outlined the general proposal to establish bases in the U.S., with the
reasons for coming to this conclusion. He cited specifically the
possibility of U.N. investigation in Guetemala and the increased scope
of the program, which has been brought about by the increased strength
of the Castro regime. ll members of the Group expressed serious

latter had just come up and that we are now in the process of assessing
the bona fides and capabilities of the individual. :

The Group agreed that the action contemplated is very much
in order. Mr. Gray commented, however, that his associates had
expressed extremely strong feelings on the necessity for very
straightforward action in this situation, and he wondered whether
the plans as outlined were sufficient to accomplish this. Mr. Dulles
replied that he had taken the comments referred to seriously and had
every intention of proceeding as vigorously as the situation permits
or requires, but added that he must necessarily put himself ina
position of interpreting instructions of this kind within the bounds of
necessity and capability. It was finally agreed that, planning for the
Congo would not necessarily rule out "consideration" of any particular
kind of activity which might contribute to getting rid of Lumumba.

Mr. Irwin commented that certain individuals in Defense have
given thought to the possibility of using high officials of the Catholic
Church in Africa to promote the general objectives of the West. - In
this connection, he cited a preliminary assessment which had been
made of the Negro Cardinal recently appointed by the Pope - the
assessment being that the individual in question is a man of not

had been levied on one of these groups as a test of its capabilities :
(after this action had been cleared with the Special Group).

” He also said that we hope to have a paramilitary force of
approximately 500 people ready to operate by Novernber. In answer
to Mr. Irwin's question, he outlined two possible ways of initiating
the tactical combat phase.

® Mr. Gray then told the Group of a talk he had had with the
Director of the Bureau of the Budget. The latter had told Mr. Gray
that he had discussed the Cuban project with Mr. Macy and that as
a result of this discussion he, Mr. Stans, had two reservations that
he would like Gray to look into. .

<! One of these had to.do with the statement by Macy that in his
discussion with CIA representatives in connection with the latest
withdrawal from the Reserve, hé had received "no evidence" that any
effective resistance had been identified within Cuba. (Mr. Gray had
answered that in the formal presentation last week, Mr. Dulles and
Mr. Bissell had mentioned a number of such groups. )

The second point had to do with a feeling that we might not

a) THE WHITE HOUSE

RW 50955 - DocId:32423488 Page 40


know enough about the political attitudes of the members of the Frente,
particularly as to basic freedoms, their attitude toward restoration

of seized American property, etc. (In answer to this, Mr. Gray had
pointed out that the Frente is composed of people who have broken
with Castro, at least on the basic philosophies. )

In an attempt to clarify the situation with respect to the first

~ point, Mr. Parrott told the Group about last Monday's meeting with
Mr. Macy, at which Mr. Barnes had covered in considerable detail
all aspects of the Cuban project. He said that he was ata loss to
understand how Macy could have received the impression that CIA
is not aware of dissident groups. He went on to say that in answer
to Mr. Macy's question as to the outlook, Mr. Barnes had stated -
and had developed at considerable. length - the thesis that our view
was one of limited optimism, and that he had explained in detail just
why this is so; this explanation had included specific comments on the
steps that have been, and are being, taken to identify such groups and
to assess their apparent leaders. Mr. Parrott said further that the
point had been made forcibly to Macy that it would be out of the question
for CIA to attempt to mount an invasion of Cuba by itself, without the
participation of large numbers of disaffected individuals within the
country.

On the second point, Mr. Dulles said that we do know a good
deal about the basic political sympathies of Frente members, and
cited as an example the position that had been taken as to the inclusion
of certain ultra-conservative groups. He said that the Frente had
issued a statement of its aims, which he summarized very broadly
as being to preserve the principles of the revolution. He said that as
to specific stands on restoration of U.S. property rights, etc., this
was thought to be unwise because it would give the Frente the appearance
of being a tool of the Americans. He agreed, however, that Mr. Stans!
point was a valid one to bear in mind and said we would certainly do
80. He added that he expects to lunch with Mr. Stans in the near future
and would take that opportunity to discuss these matters further, as
appropriate. :

Mr. Parrott said that there was no disagreement that the political
ideas ofthese individuals must be constantly assessed and must be
clearly established before the operation actually comes off. He
added, however, that it should be borne in mind that once these
politically-screened individuals had issued their general statement
of objectives, our primary operational task has been to hold the FRD
together, and that at this particular stage it would not be practical

to insist on a more precise spelling out of individual or group
views.

Mr. Parrott also said that Mr. Macy had raised a related
point which Mr. Barres and he had agreed had validity, and that
Mr. Barnes had undertaken to assure Macy that it would be given aaa
adequate attention by the interagency planning group. This was a
concern expressed as to planning for the support - fiscal and otherwise -
of a new Cuban government immediately after a successful overturn
of the present one. Mr. Merchant said that he agreed fully with the
necessity for making contingency plans of this sort, and had in fact
directed three weeks ago that State officials begin to draw them up.

While agreeing that the Government could not take an official
stand, Mr. Merchant expressed his personal opinion that if the
companies should suspend operations, this would give the Soviets a
great opportunity, given the fact that the Cuban economy is so dependent
on oil. He pointed out that no alternative leader to Castro has yet
emerged, and that the United States would be held liable for any
economic crisis that might be precipitated in this way...

Mr. Gray related the consideration of this sort of action to the |
sugar project discussed three weeks ago by the Group. He emphasized
that in his opinion these are isolated actions and that any moves of
this kind should be made only after an over-all consideration of
whether and how the United States wishes to move against Castro, |
Mr. Irwin took some exception to this, indicating that he thought it —_
was possible and perhaps desirable to take such actions as those
contemplated in the sugar proposal, apart from any. concerted across-~
the-board program, Mr. Dulles emphasized that in any case we will
have to decide before long whether covert action should be taken in
Cuba.

It was then agreed that a special meeting of the Group should be
held on Monday, March l4th, to consider what might and should be
done in Cuba. It was agreed that in addition to the regular members,
Mr. Rubottom, Admiral Burke, Mr. Bissell, Mr. King and perhaps
Colonel Lansdale should attend.

There was then a brief discussion of Admiral Burke's letter to
Mr. Merchant. It developed that the attachment to‘this letter has now
been given the status of a JCS document but that it has*not been forwarded ..
to the NSC as the JCS had desired. (Mr. Irwin said that he had held
up this action because of the informal nature of the letter.) Mr, Merchant
said the Department is preparing comments and that he hoped the JCS
paper would not be considered apart from State's comments.

Mr. Dulles said that we would require a policy decision on
whether a black radio could be established on U.S. territory, probably
in the Florida Keys. It was agreed that this proposal should be staffed
through the Scott office.

i Mr. Gray asked the Acting DCI whether he had anything to add
on the situation in the Dominican Republic to what had been covered
by himself and the Secretary of State that morning at the NSC meeting.
General Cabell replied that he would only like to add the comment
that it appears evident that Trujillo will not consider making any
arrangements for an orderly succession to himself, but that he will
either hang on to the bitter end or flee the country on short notice,
A la Batista.

Mr. Gray asked the Group's views on what happens after Trujillo,
specifically how Castro can be kept out of the Dominican Republic.
General Cabell commented that so far no worthwhile opposition to the
Benefactor has been identified, and that in his opinion it might well
become necessary to dispatch U.S. forces, openly identified as such,
to the country in the immediate aftermath of the demise or flight of
Trujillo, Mr. Merchant said that his preliminary thoughts were that
there would probably be a good chance to get OAS support for a move
of this kind to forestall Castro} on the other hand, we might expect
some internal revulsion at the arrival of U.S. forces because of the
memory of the Marine occupation.

Mr. Merchant added that Mr. Rubottom was thinking seriously
of a plan to seal off the land approaches to the Dominican Republic
via Haiti, thereby requiring any sizeable Castro, effort to be an
amphibious one. He said that this plan has not yet been formally

Mr. Joseph Scott of the Department of State sat in as an
observer.

\ v8 Cuba

: Mr. Gray said that he had discussed with his associates the
organizational entities within the U.S. Government which have been
established to deal with the Cuban situation. He noted that a number
of different groups and committees, with varying interests and
objectives, are concerning themseives with inis situation and that
there seemed to him to be no "chief of staff!’ to whorn all could look
as a central point,

He said that the opinion had been expressed to him that Mr.
Dillon should assume this function, but that in Dillon's absence, -
Mr. Hare should take on the responsibility and should inform himself pn
of the general outlines of what has been going on in the Government.

Mr. Gray said that it had been felt essential to have such an official
available over the coming weekend, because of the expected May Day
troubles, and that since this official:should be of such a stature as
to permit access to the highest levels, Mr. Hare had been decided

upon, pending Mr. Dillon's availability.

In this connection it was agreed that Mr. Dillon should be brought
up to date at an appropriate time on the status of covert operations
with respect to Cuba. cour :

Inter alia, Mr. Gray expressed concern and some surprise at
statements and actions by UAR officials with regard to Cuba.. Mr.
Hare explained at some length his conviction that Deputy Foreign
Minister Sabri (older brother of Ali Sabri) is largely responsible for ees
this kind of thing, and that it does not represent the feelings of
Nasser or Ali Sabri. He traced the brother's background and described

him as a "twisted personality." PROFE

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Minutes of Special Group Meeting, 19 November 1960
PRESENT: Messrs. Merchant and Mann; Douglas and Gen. Lansdale;
Gray; Dulles and Bissell

/ 2, Cuba

Mr. Merchant began by stating that in his opinion we are putting
more burden on the Guatemalan government with our training base than
that government can support for very long. He noted that Mr. Mann
believes the solution is to move our training activities to the U.S.,
but Mr. Merchant does not think we can get away with this, particularly
if an increase in numbers is contemplated: Therefore, the only solution
would seem to be to move to another base or bases in other countries;
this would involve the same burden on the other countries as now exists
with respect to Guatemala. Although he has not discussed this point
with Secretary Herter, Mr. Merchant believes that it is time to take
another look at Cuba and if the U.S. attitude toward Castro remains
unchanged then we should consider shifting our entire posture, This
would involve a break in diplomatic relations, the support of a govern-
ment in exile, and other activities mostly overt, including some
training in the U.S.

pRoPRTY
HE WHITE HOU!

HW 50955 -DocId:32423488 Page 46


Mr. Mann commented that he thinks we cannot maintain training
anywhere in Latin America indefinitely, although he does think we
could maintain small airstrips without too much danger. He said that
he believes everyone in Guatemala knows by now the true nature of
our activities there, and that if they are going to be publicized before
the world he would rather have them exposed in the U.S. rather than
in Latin America. He recognized that this would be highly embar-
rassing for this country, but that for most Latin American governments
it could be fatal. He spoke of the impending OAS investigation of
Guatemala, and conceded that OAS support would be required to carry
out training successfully in the U.S. To this, Mr. Merchant replied
that he did not think exposure of such activities on American soil would .
be acceptable, particularly in the U.N.

Mr. Bissell then said that he has agreed for some time with
Mr. Mann's point as to the strain on Guatemala, He said that we have
developed an evacuation plan to be used in the event of outside investi-
gation, but that this is nota satisfactory answer to the problem. -He
said that within about four weeks an alternate site could be established
in Nicaragua but that this would be very expensive, would tie us into
the Somoza brothers, and would call attention to Nicaragua in the same

way as Guatemala. ~~

Mr. Bissell said that he foresaw several possibilities for
constructive change in the training operation, some for the immediate
future and some over a period of longer range, They include:

a. A sort of refugee camp in the U.S. ostensibly
designed for temporary care of Cuban exiles. This story

could be defended but it is difficult to say for how long nai

or how. effectively.

b. A guarded military facility in the U.S. This
could be handled more securely, but the existence of
an area where peculiar things are going on could not
be kept secret indefinitely. An alternative would be
private property sork as the King Ranch, but this would
take longer to arrange than a Military base.

c, Vieques Island, off Puerto Rico. This is fairly
remote, but the government of Puerto Rico is already
trying to get the U.S. Marines cut,

PROPERTY OF
THE WHITE HOUSE OF

HW 50955 DocId:32423488 Page 47


d. The CIA site on Saipan. This would be very secure
but would require a large amount of airlift.

e. Fort Randolph, in the Panama Canal Zone. At this
location the trainees could be kept secure but would almost
certainly know where they were,

Mr. Douglas said that a military base could be made available,
such as Laughlin Air Force Base near Del Rio, Texas. He said that
the use of such real estate might be tied into some sort of cooperation
with Tracy Voorhees! Committee on Cuban Refugees. He felt also
that the U.S. capability for intervention in Cuba will probably not be
effective enough unless there is more overt participation than has sseeieseniee
been contemplated to date. Gen, Lansdale said that he and Gen. Bonesteel
were of the same opinion.

Mr. Gray supported this general position, stating that when the
current Cuban plan was approved, the situation in that country was
different than it is now. Since then, the Cubans have received sizeable
amounts of bloc arms and have organized a militia, and Mr. Gray
wondered how effective a few hundred exiles could be.. Mr. Dulles —
acknowledged that it would be necessary to have internal support if Pe
the Castro government were to be successfully overthrown; he felt :
that there is reason to believe such support might develop, perhaps
within the militia itself.

Mr. Mann expressed the opinion’ that the way to proceed is to
seal Cuba off from the rest of Latin America and to settle down for a
one or two year wait, presumably to see whether the tide might not turn
in our favor. He said that in the meantime we could infiltrate small
groups of trained Cubans as a token, but that we should postpone a
decision ona striking force for four or five months, In this general
connection, Mr. Bissell said that even if it is finally decided that overt
U.S. forces should be used, there still should be a nucleus of trained
Cubans available. Therefore, our present activities should be continued
in any case. .

Summing up, the Group decided that the possibility of splitting
the present body of trainees into three or four groups should be examined
urgently (particularly in view of Mr. Mann's estimate that the OAS
investigation might take place in two or three weeks). Alternate sites
to be examined would include Vieques, Laughlin AFB and Fort Randolph.

PROPERTY af
THE WHITE ious

HW 50955 DocId:32423488 Page 48


The latter location should absorb no more than 200. Mr. Douglas

cautioned that the use of DOD facilities should at the present time

be considered as a holding operation rather than a continuation or

stepping up of present training. The possibilities of establishing a
kind of CCC under the Voorhees auspices should be examined,

43, Advice to Assistant Attorney General

Mr. Parrott tabled the draft of suggested edvice to Mr. Yeagley
in connection with Cuban exiles. Mr, Douglas felt that it was not
desirable to give Mr. Yeagley any piece of paper. He suggested that
Yeagley should simply be advised that the Group feels the best method
of procedure might be to prosecute one test case, e.g. Masferrer,
but not to institute wholesale prosecutions. In answer toa question,
Mr. Parrott stated that he did not know whether this procedure would
satisfy Mr. Yeagley, but that-he would discuss it with Mr. Gray, who

- had by that time left the meeting. (Later, Mr. Gray talked to Yeagley,

wha annaared satisfied with the oral onidance.)

/ 5, U-2 for Cuba

Mr. Bissell summarized the results of the first U-2 flight over
Cuba and asked for the Group's permission for two additional sorties
to fill in the remaining 50% coverage. The Group agreed, subject to
Mr. Gray's concurrence, (This was obtained later.)

“2, Cuba

Mr. Bissell reported that further consideration following the
meeting of last Saturday had led to a tentative conclusion that Saipan
would be the best place to which to move the bulk of the Cuban trainees,
He emphasized the security advantages of the location, and said that :
it is believed the move can be accomplished with our own transportation
plus two roundtrips by C-124s, These we would request the Department
of Defense to provide. We would probably move some small
commando-type units - about 50 men - to Fort Randolph. Mr. Bissell
also stressed the fact that additional construction costs would be
significantly less at Saipan than anywhere else.

The DCI agreed in general with this preliminary thinking. He
urged, however, that the matter of morale of the trainees bé borne
constantly in mind, and that the move not be accomplished all at once.
Gen, Lansdale agreed. Mr. Dulles also asked that President Ydigoras
be informed.

a Mr. Bissell concluded that plans would not be firmed up until
receipt of Defense's report on facilities available in the U.S.

Mr. Bissell then spoke of the report of a possible attempt by
Cuban dissidents to take over the Isle of Pines. He explained that we
have nothing to do with the plan and would in fact be unable to give much
support to it. He said that itis highly questionable whether this attempt
will take —piare.om the reporied time schedule, or indeed at all, but
emphasized that this illustrates how initiative might be taken by others,
80 that we could be presented with drastic requests for assistance on
very short notice. Mr, Bissell also mentioned the report of possible
major sabotage to be carried out in the very near future. In addition,
he said that we now have six B-26s, plus eleven crews, available for
combat, with other aircraft for supply. He noted that Nicaragua might
be used for refueling in the event of actual operations, but that the
immediate objective would be to obtain strips on the Isle of Pines.

Mr. Dulles remarked that this would of course require an active revolt.

Mr. Dulles also mentioned the proposal by Peter Grace to encourage
Father Peyton (described as a sort of Catholic Billy Graham) to carry
out activities in Cuba, i

Mr. Gray solicited the Group's assistance in arriving ata aie
consensus of views as to what exactly had been decided as a result :
of the high-level meeting of the day before. The following points were
agreed: : :

a. Mr. Gray's associates stand ready to deny U.S.
activity based in Guatemala, even though it may become
blown (Mr. Douglas urged that every effort be made to
make it possible to deny plausibly).

b. Ifthe program is enlarged, additional facilities
may be obtained, but at this stage not in the U.S. No
training of Cubans-will be conducted in the U.S. under
present circumstances. (Mr. Bissell told the Group of
the possibility of an additional finca in Guatemala.)

c. Evacuation plans should be kept in readiness.
(Mr. Mann said that he thought he could arrange a week's

notice before any OAS committee actually visited
Guatemala and that it might be possible even then to
avoid actual investigation on the spot. Mr. Bissell
said that if we do have a week, evacuation could be
carried out by Agency aircraft; if more speed is
required DOD assistance might be necessary.

Mr. Douglas, with Mr. Dulles and Mr. Bissell
concurring, felt that the possibility of emergency
evacuation to Florida under the guise of ordinary
refugees should be kept in mind.)

Mr. Dulles suggested that questions on Cuba might be asked at
the next Presidential press conference and that we should be prepared
with a statement along the lines that we do not entirely discourage
revolutionary activity. Mr. Merchant said he would arrange to have
a draft prepared along these lines. In this connection, Mr. Parrott
reported the request from Assistant Attorney General Yeagley for
guidance as to possible action against an alleged collaborator of
General Pedraza. (Note: Mr. Yeagley was later told that we have no
operational interest and no objection to the Department of Justice's
pursuing the case. Mr. Yeagley said that they would proceed with
investigation, but that it is by no. means certain the case will ever
come to trial.) as

Mr. Gray then outlined his understanding of his friends! desires
with respect to organization of the anti-Castro effort. He said that the
principal need foreseen was for an individual to serve as a focal point
for diverse interests in this situation, and to be available to meet with
Mr. Gray's friends at any time. In addition, someone should be
available to deal with the FRD and to.talk to other Latin American

governments,

After a considerable amount of discussion, the consensus of the
Group was as follows: Probably two men will be required, one to handle
the overt and the other the covert aspects. They would work together
on a daily basis and both would have the entire picture in mind, but
responsibility for the execution of covert operations would have to rest
with CLA. The overt.man should ideally be a government official,
preferably someone senior in the Foreiga Service or the Department
of State. There should be a sort of "board of directors! to oversee
all aspects of the operation. This should be the Special Group plus
Secretary Anderson when matters of major policy are considered.

(Mr. Gray was not entirely sure that his friends would accept the two-'
man concept but Mr. Dulles and Mr. Merchant emphasized that whether

ent

BW 50955 Docld:32423488. Page 52


there were one man or two, CIA would have to maintain its own
organizational integrity. )

There then ensued a lengthy examination of qualifications and
availability of a number of individuals. It was finally decided that, pinsaitege
taking all things into consideration, including the aspect of quick
availability, Ambassador Willauer would probably be the best choice.
On the CIA side, Mr. Dulles nominated Mr. Barnes. It was recog-
nized that these nominees would have to be checked with Mr. Gray's
associates. :

Mr. Mann suggested that Mr. Willauer might also do the FRD
job, but the DCI pointed out that this requires a covert approach and
must be done by the Agency.

As to Mr. Pawley, it was decided that it would be unwise to have
him embark on a grand tour’ or to endow him with official government
status. Mr. Merchant said he would not object, however, to Mr. Pawley's
talking to President Frondizi. N

Mr. Gray then mentioned the report which had reached his
friends about a representative of the FRD who had apparently just
returned from a trip around Latin America. It was noted that the
individual referred to was probably Sardinius, and Mr. Dulles said
he would obtain a written report of the trip, for passage to Mr. Gray's
associates.

Mr. Bissell reminded Mr. Douglas of the outstanding request

to the DOD for thirty-eight NCOs and officers for service outside the

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE
CONCLUDING REMARKS

You will, I hope, permit me some personal, but I think
not unimportant observations. I hope that you will complete your
work as expeditiously as possible as I feel very strongly the need
for a viable Central Intelligence Agency operating, of course, within
its charter. I believe that the present furor about C.I.A. is
impeding it in the performance of its mission and the sooner it is
able to go about its business, not in a fish bowl, the better our
country will be served. I believe that we will continue to need
effective, intelligent collection and analysis for our policy makers
and I think there will be occasions when covert activities should be
undertaken in the interests of cae National security.

Finally, one thing that bothers me, Mr. Chairman, is that
there is tremendous concern now -- and I don't suggest that it is
improper -- with the activities of the Central Intelligence Agency,
while at the same time péople seem not to be equally concerned
about what the Soviet Union is up to in this country, especially
through its. very many KGB agents here. I would hope that a
Congressional Committee would be interested enough to investigate

this most serious matter.

Stated: "The Venezuelan government was engaged in an all-out effort, through

Betancourt wants a meeting of the OAS nations to deal with the Trujillo problem.

SUBJLCT: SUMMARY OF INTERVIEW WITH GORDON GRAY

CENERAL_BACKGROUND.

1. Staff Responsibilities Under Eisenhower:

Gray said that the structural chain of command ran directly from the -
DCI to the President during the Eisenhower adininistration. Allen Dulles

was able to approach Eisenhower directly, rather than through Gray.

Andrew Goodpaster staffed President Eisenhower on many of the same
subjects that Gray worked on. Gray was responsible for long-range planning;
Goodpaster was responsible for spot. work. Gray said that Goodpaster and he
kept cach other "intimately informed". However, Gray said that any covert
action program would go through him and not Goodpaster. "Although I would
tell Goodpaster about anything I discussed with the President." Some covert
action programs were extremely tightly held, for example, on the U-2 incident
only the following people were knowledgeable: Eisenhower, Goodpaster, and John

Eisenhower.

"JT didn't live with Eisenhower 24 hours a day. I don't know everything
that he did. But I do think I knew every major decision, approval, or action

of Eisenhower's,"

cial Group Function
At the 54/12 committee, Gray said, "I represented the President's interest,

that was my role."

HW 50955 DocId:32423488 Page 65


Gray said that shortly after the BERLIN TUNNEL,

whower said,

"ZT want the 54/12 comnittee to consider any action that impinges
: asa

the sovereignty of another country."

Gray said that in almost every case, a proposed covert action would
have been discussed with the State Department and would have been staffed
out before Special Group meeting. "Most of the rest of us did not have a chance

to reflect before the meeting."

Gray said that during his tenure, there was no chairman of the $4/12

(Special Group). But perhaps Merchant conducted the meetings.

Gray said that during the transition to the Kennedy administration, he
asked McGeorge Bundy to promise him that the Special Group would not be
washed out. Gray explained that the Special Group was necessary for the
protection of the President. The Special Group discussions allow the President
the chance to know in advance about actions which are potentially embarrassing
to him. The President's representative to the Group (Gray, then Bundy) has the
right to object to an action and take it up with the President. The President
has a chance to know about everything that goes on in the Special Group, and
through his Special Assistant for National Security Affairs, the President would
have a chance to say "no"' to a proposed action. Gray said that the presence
of the Special Group would protect a President from operations such as assass-

inations.

3. “His Associate'!:

Initially, Gray did not recognize the phrase used by Parrott in the
Special Group minutes 'Mr. Gray's associate" or “His associates". Gray's
first reaction was that “his associates" would probably refer to members

of his NSC staff.

HW 50955 DocId:32423488 Page 66


-3- : ,

But after seeing the minutes of the Special Group mecting of
February 17, 1960, Gray said that it was clear that in those minutes

/
“his associate" referred to President Eisenhower.

Gray said that he never used the phrase "associate", that was
Parrott's phrase. Gray was not aware the phrase was used at the time
in those minutes and couldn't, without reconstructing cach minute, be
sure it referred to the President in cach case, He said that when he

attended the meetings,he would refer to "the President" directly.

(Note: Since the phrase "the President’ is never used in Parrott's
minutes, it is fair to assume that at least some of the references to

"Mr. Gray's associate" are euphemisms for President Eisenhower.)

C_ DOCUMENTS

Gray recalls that. the President called him, and perhaps Allen Dulles,
into his office shortly after Gray's appointment and said that "no
minutes, notes, or memos of Special Group meetings are to be kept, except
by the DCI and they are to be kept in the DCI's files."" Gray said that
Dulles was not present at this ineeting. He knows that he would have told

Dulles shortly afterwards.

Gray did not keep personal notes of the Special Group meetings.
Although he did defy the Presidential directive in one specific instance,

by deciding to make a memorandum of every meeting with the President relating

to the subject of Cuba. These memoranda are on file at the, Presidential
Library in Abilene, Kansas. -
Gray said that he never reviewed Thomas Parrott's minutes of ‘the

Special Group. But. the NSC minutes were passed to the principals at the

AW 50955 DocId:32423488 Page 67


NW 50955

ae

meeting for their review. Gray prepared the "records of action'' for

the NSC, along with Jimmy Lay, Gray's assistant.

LUYUMBA

Gray said that he did not remember the August 25, 1960 meeting at
which it was reported that Gray commented that "his associates had expressed ;
extremely strong feelings on the necessity for very straight-forward action"
in relation to LUMUMBA. Gray said at first that he did not remember
LUMUMBA's position in the Congo. Gray said that he did not remember talking
with Eisenhower about LUMUMBA.

However, Gray does remember that "we were anti-LUMUMBA and wanted to

see him removed from his position of responsibility."

In reference to the August 25 meeting, after he had seen the minutes
of the meeting, Gray said that "when I said ‘straightforward action', certainly
assassination would be one possibility." Gray continued to say that Allen
DULLES. was consistently in opposition to assassination and "he was probably

saying to me that assassination was one of the things we shouldn't do."

With reference to testimony received by the Select Comnittee from Robert
JOHNSON, a State Department official who was a member of the Policy Planning
Council, he said that he had no recollection of a meeting in the summer of
1960, at which President EISENHONER ordered the assassination of LUMUMBA or

said words to that effect.

Gray said that he knows Bronson TWEEDY, but he never discussed LUMUMBA

with TWEEDY.

Docld:32423488 Page 68


‘TRUJILLO
"T am sure there was no discussion with EISENIOWER about the

_ assassination of TRUJILLO."

"J don't see how the DCI and the Department of State could have
approved arms shipments without going up to the Special Group. The
DCI should have taken a suggested course of action to the Special Group

after checking with State."

Gray said: "A high-powered weapon with a telescopic site would

connote to me that it would be used for the purpose of assassinating an

individual."

CUBA
Gray said that President EISENHOWER would frequently remark at
meetings on Cuba that an operation should be planned so that it would be

carried through successfully, otherwise it should not be planned at all.

Referring to the minutes of the Special Group meeting of February 17,
1960, Gray’ said. that at some point during that period.of time, Allen
DULLES brought his sugar mill sabotage plan to President EISENHOWER, who
listened attentively. Afterward, the President said, "I don't think
sabotage of sugar mills will do something significant. Bring me a complete
plan." Subsequently, DULLES brought the President a four-point program:
propaganda; economic sanction; sabotage; and the training of Cuban exiles.
GRAY said the President approved this memo, (Note that Gray also said that he

made a memo of this meeting and subscquent meetings on Cuba.)

HW 50955 Docld:32423488 Page 69


After the BAY OF PIGS, Gray called President EISENHOWER and
offered to show him all of the memos that Gray had prepared on Presidential
meetings on Cuba, Gray said that JONN EISENHOWER obtained the memos and
brought them to Gettysburg. Gray and President EISENHOWER reviewed the
memos, Gray said that the President objected to the word "planning" in
reference to a Cuban invasion, on the basis that there was no actual military

planning. EISENHOWER suggested that the page should be retyped to change

the word "planning". Gray said they did retype the page.

Gray said that although in his mind, and LEISENHOWER's, there was no
military "planning", definitely EISENHOWER knew that Cuban exiles were being

trained for an amphibious landing in Cuba,

President EISENHOWER went so far in contingency planning, said Gray, as to
advocate to Allen DULLES the formation of a government in exile among the
Cuban community, But, Gray said, the Cubans could never settle among them-

selves who would constitute the leadership of such a government.

Referring to the minutes of Special Group meeting of August 12, 1960,
Gray remembers the presentation by Richard BISSELL of a budget for Cuban
operations over. 13 million dollars, with a heavy emphasis on paramilitary
operations. Gray said that the reference at the end of the memo to laying
this budget before "higher authorities" for approval clearly referred to

President EISENHOWER.

Referring to the minutes of the Special Group meeting of November 3, 1960,
at which MERCHANT asked a question about whether there had been planning "for

taking direct positive action against FIDEL, RAUL, and (HE GUEVARA," Gray said

HW 50955 Docld:32423488 Page 70


-7-

that he did not remember the meeting. Gray acknowledged, howéver, that
the phrase "direct positive action" in this context "could have included
assassination." Gray said that the reaction by General CABELL that such

action would be beyond CIA capabilities, was the "usual DCI reaction".

Referring to the Special Group minutes of December 28, 1960, Gray said
that "the special meeting" mentioned therein is clearly a meeting with the President.
Gray though that this must have been the last meeting on Cuba with the
President, the purpose of which would have been to clean up the Cuba project
for the new administration. Gray said that there must have been dozens of

meetings on Cuba (all of which will be reflected in the Gray memos in Abilene).

CASTRO/GAMBLING SYNDICATE, OPERATION, PHASE T

Gray said that he was completely unaware of any conversation between
Richard BISSELL and Sheffield EDWARDS about establishing underworld contacts
for the purpose of an assassination attempt on CASTRO, Gray also said that
he was unaware of any development, within the Technical Services Division of
the CIA, of assassination devices to be used against CASTRO such as lethal cigars.
Likewise, he was unaware of the development of any devices designed for the

disorientation or embarrassment of CASTRO.
Gray said that he knew BISSELL well, ‘but not EDWARDS,

Gray said that, if such operations were in progress, the DCI should have

known about them. Gray said that if the DCI knew about such operations, "he

would have raised it at the Special Group or with me, He didn't, I think I

would have known if Allen DULLES had discussed such subjects with the President."

Gray said that it was possible that BISSELL was acting unilaterally on this



HW 50955

-8-

matter. Gray said that he'd talked to Andrew GOODPASTER about the recent
news stories which indicate that there was assassination planning against
CASTRO during this period of time, and GOODPASTER said that he'd never

heard about such things.
EXECUTIVE ACTION

"I never heard of EXECUTIVE ACTION until David BELIN mentioned it to

me,"
ASSASSINATIONS GENERALLY

_ Gray said that he remembered two mentions of assassination: (1) When
NASSAR was riding high, someone at the planning board said "we ought to bump
him off", But Gray said this was not a serious discussion. . Assassination was
not an option that went to the President. (2) At the PFIAB meetings, one
member consistently would ask the CIA "about bumping off the leadership in
Hanoi", Gray did not think this was a serious suggestion. Gray said the
member who suggested this is "well-known" and he was reluctant to provide the

name to US.

"I followed closely any covert operations I was interested in." Gray said
that "if I had known of any assassination attempt, I probably would have called"
the responsible official to stay abreast. He said he didn't know of any such

attempts.

Biographical Background

1951-62 National Security Council staff member

1962-67 State Department, member of Policy Planning Council

Chronology of Events

Summer, 1960 Johnson attended a meeting of the NSC to discuss

developments in the CONGO. "At some time during that
discussion, President EISENHOWER said something --
I can no longer remember his-words -~ that came

across to me as an order for the assassination
of LUMUMBA...There was no discussion; the meeting
simply moved on."
--Johnson said he might have omitted the statement
from his de-briefing memo due to its sensitivity.
-- J. said probably Allen DULLES and Gordon GRAY
were present at the meeting (in the Cabinet Roo).
--The formal record of decision by the NSC is
unlikely to contain infommation on this subject,
he said.
--The memos which Johnson did on the meetings would
be with President Eisenhower's papers. (10)

"I was surprised £...that I would ever hear a President

say anything like this in my presence or the presence
of a group of people. I was startled."
