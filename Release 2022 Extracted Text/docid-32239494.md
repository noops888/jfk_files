Dear Miss Mordana:

Thank you for your letter of October 19, 1976.
Although my schedule is kind of filled at the moment,
I. would be able to see you on Monday, November 1, in
my office in Philadelphia at 4:30 P.M. I am sorry to
make it so late in the day, but I have to be in
Washington, Pa. earlier that day; and I am in
Washington, D.C. the rest of this week.

Would you be good enough to let my secretary
know whether you will be able to come in for this
appointment.. Her name is Miss Shenk.

Sincerely yours,

Richard A. Sprague, Esq.
1622 Locust Street
Phil., Pa. 19103

Dear Mr. Sprague:

I was so intrigued by your selection as Chief Counsel
and Staff Director of the Select Committee on Assassinations
that I had to write to you. I am an extremely bright and
capable graduate of Columbia Law School (May 1976) who hap-
pens to be one of your cousin Ziporah Mordana's daughters,
and one of Debora Horowitz's granddaughters,

I hope you will forgive me for thus invoking kinship,
but I am so eager to work with you that I am tempted to use
any and all reasonable means to help achieve that objective.
"Uncle" Louis heartily agreed that I should acquaint you with
my existence, and gave me your address,

My educational background includes being a Stone Scholar
and "VG" student at Columbia Law School, and a Phi Beta Kappa
at Barnard College (undergraduate division of Columbia Univer-
sity). While in law school, I persuaded the Columbia Graduate
School of Journalism to admit me to some of its professional
workshops. (in reporting, writing, editing, etc.), and completed
half the Master's Program in Journalism.

My professional legal experience has involved a great deal
of litigation practice, from doing research and discovery, to
writing complaints, interrogatories, pre-trial memoranda and
appellate briefs, in areas ranging from anti-trust to customs
seizures.

My most challenging employment has been with the American
Civil Liberties Union, where I have been working since the
Summer of 1975, In my capacity as law clerk to the Legal Direc-
tor, I was given the responsibility for handling the pre-trial

| Docld:32239494 Page 16



litigation (with occasional assistance) of a bipartite class
suit involving domestic intelligence activities—so far suc-
cessfully—and was assigned to work on a case with Ramsey
Clark (writing the successful brief in his challenge to a
district court gag order).

Given my interests and abilities, it would be an in-
exredible opportunity for me to assist in any way with your
investigation, Should you have any use for a very sharp
thinker and tenacious researcher, I hope you will consider ne.
me. And if there is any further information you would like
to have, I would be happy to send it, and delighted to bring
it to you.

Very truly yours,

P.S. In case you have no idea who your cousin Ziporah is,
you might ask your mother if she remembers "Zipsy"
Horowitz from Vienna.

Dear Mr. Sprague:

Sari Mordana has told me of her interest in
| working on the legal staff you are assembling as Chief
Counsel to the Select Committee on Assassinations. I
am writing this letter to recommend Miss Mordana for
such a position.

Miss Mordana has worked as my law clerk for
over a year, and I am highly impressed with her ability.
She is extremely bright and capable, and her superior
work has made a significant contribution to the cases
on which she has assisted. She has a great deal of in-
itiative in taking on responsibility, and has handled
the legal research and writing in several phases of com-
plex litigation with a minimum of supervision, and a high
degree of professionalism.

In addition to her practical legal ability, she
is articulate in the law, and her writing is of an ex-
tremely high caliber. As to her personal qualities, she
is’an unusually alert and hard-working individual, who
delights in tackling a difficult project, and pursuing
it to a successful resolution.

Dear Mr. Sprague:

I understand that Sari Mordana is applying for a
position on the legal staff which you are gathering as
Special Counsel to the select congressional committee which
will be investigating the assassinations of Martin Luther
King, Jr. and John F. Kennedy. This letter is being written
to recommend Miss Mordana for such a position.

I am a member of the adjunct faculty at Columbia
Law School. Each spring I teach a seminar on trial practice
and, this year, Miss Mordana was one of the 18 students in
my class. The seminar requires substantial participation by
each student in simulated courtroom events and in the critiques
which follow. As a result, I believe I am able to make an
informed judgment respecting Miss Mordana's ability and person-
ality. I found her extremely bright and hard-working. But
just as important I found that she had an intangible quality
which unfortunately few law students possess -- a spark which
ignites when she is working on a project she enjoys. This
facet of her personality made her a very effective advocate.
She could marshal facts and present them in a manner which
attracted attention and was convincing.

Having recently been part of a congressional inquiry
myself, as an associate of John Doar, I recognize the diffi-
culties involved in the task you are undertaking and the

would be an asset to your staff.

I wish you well.
