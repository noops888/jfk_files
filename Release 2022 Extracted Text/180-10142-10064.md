Mr. Rocca, as the day to day CIA working level

rounding photograph now referred to as that

of the "Mexico City Mystery Man"

Each of these concerns will be examined a

herein.

The CIA's concern for revealing the existence of

sensitive technical operations, as outlined above, was

evident from the

aception of the warren Commission.

Mr. Scelso commented that "we were not authorized at first

to reveal all our technical operations." (Scelso dep.

p.158) Scelso further testified:

We were going to give them intelligence re-

ports which derived from all our sources, in-

cluding technical sources, including the

tele-

phone intercept and the information gotten

from the interrogation of Silvia Duran, for

example, which corresponded almost exactly

with the information from the telephone inter-

cepts. (Ext to Scelso quote, all of p.5)

Mr. Scelso's characterization is supported by

examination of the background to the first major CIA

report furnished the warren Conmission regarding Lee Harvey

'31 Janmemo

Oswald's trip to Mexico City. (Cite.) Much of the informa-

tion provided to the Warren Commission in this report was

based upon sensitive sources and methods, identification

of which had been deleted completely from the report.

The LA

policy +

limiting Warren Commission know-

ledge of CIA sources and methods was articulated as early

as December 20, 1963, at which time a cable was sent from

CIA headquarters to the Mexico City Station which stated:

Our present plan in passing information to the

Warren Commission is to eliminate mention of tele-

Will rely instead on statements

of Silvia Duran and on contents of Soviet

Consular file which Soviets gave ODACID

(CIA cable DIR 97829 FOlA 498-204, 29Jan1964)

The basic policy articulated in the December 20,

1963 cable is also set forth in a CIA memorandum of

December 17, 1963. In that memorandum, Birch O'Neal

/Special Investigations Group-

of the CIA counterintelligence/staff wrote that he had

been advised by Sam Papich, FBI liaison men to the CIA,

that the FBI was anticipating a request from the Warren

Commission for copies of the FBI's materials which sup-

ported or complimented the FBI's five volume report of

Decmeber 9, 1963 submitted to the Warren Commission.

Papich provided O'Neal with this report which indicated

that some United States Agency was tapping telephones

in Mexico. Papich queried O'Neal whether the FBI could

Whie

supply the Warren Commission with source of the telephone

taps. (The FBI had knowledge of CIA's telephone surveil-

lance operations in Mexico City, see CIA S@CI-3/779/5101

O'Neal's memorandum

shows

• that he discussed this matter

with Scelso who in turn, after a discussion with Helms,

was directed by Helms to prepare CIA material to be passed

.to the Warren Commission. O'Neal wrote:

He (Scelso) was quite sure it was not the

Agency's desire to make available to the Com-

mission at least in this manner--via the FBI-

IV. Telephone Taps and Photo Surveillance

Mr. Helms offered testimony regarding the CIA's

reticence to

inform the Warren Commission, at least during

oftte@ommiss.con'suissitk,

the initial stage of the CIA's telephonic and photo sur-

veillance operations in Mexico City,

Helms testified:

The reason for the sensitivity of these tele-

phone taps and surveillance was not only be-

cause it was sensitive from the Agency's

standpoint, but the telephone taps were run-

ning in conjunction with the Mexican authori-

ties and therefore, if this had become public

knowledge, it would

have caused very bad feel-

ings between Mexico and the United States,

and that was the reason. (Helms Exec Session

hearing, pp.51-52,

the FBI regarding the Mexico City surveillance operations

As noted previously, on January 31, 1964, the CIA

On February li 1964 Helms appeared before the

Commission (see above) and likely discussed the memoran-

dum of January l , 1964. On Feburary 10, 1964, J. Lee

Rankin wrote Helms in regard to the CIA memorandum of

January 31. A review of Rankin's letter indicates that

as ot

his writers.

*, the Warren Commission

had no substantive knowledge of the telephone surveillance

operation or the production i.e., the tapes and trans-

cripts, from that operation. Rankin inquired in the Feb-

ruary 10, 1964 letter whether Oswald's direct communica-

tion with employees of the Soviet Embassy (as stated in

of the January 31 memorandum) had been facilitated

by telephone or interview. Manifestly, if the Warren Com-

mission had been informed of the telephone surveillance

operation and its success in tapping Oswald this inquiry

by Rankin would not have been made.

Raymond Rocca's testimony tends to support this

conclusion. It was Rocca's recollection that between

the time period of January 1964 - April 1964, Warren Com-

mission's representatives had visited the CIA's headguar-

ters in Langley, Virginia and had been shown various trans-

cripts resulting from the CIA's telephond surveillance

operations in Mexico City. (Rocca dep. p.89) However,

Mr. Rocca did not personally make this material available

to Commission representatives and was not able to state

under oath precisely the point in time at which the Warren

Commission learned of these operations.

---

## Page 10

- 25 -

On February 19, 1964 the CIA responded to Rankin's

inquiry of February 10.

The Agency response did indi-

cate that Oswald had phoned the Soviet Consulate and was

also interviewed at the Consulate. However, the Agency did

not reveal the source of this information in its response

to the commissionor indicalo that it would be revealed

by other means (e.g. by oral briefing).

v.

During the period of March - April 1964, David

Slawson drafted a

series of memoranda which among other

issues concerned Warren Commission knowledge of and access

to the production material derived from the CIA telephonde

surveillance operations in Mexico City. A review of

these memoranda tend to support the Committee's belief

that the Warren Commission, through Mssrs. Slawson, Coleman,

and Willens did not obtain access to CIA telephone surveil-

lance materials until April 9, 1964. At that time, Coleman,

Salwson and willens met with win Scott, the CIA's Chief

Scott

of Station in Mexico City ne provided them with various

transcripts and translations derived from CIA telephone

taps of the Cuban and Soviet Embassy/Consulates. (Slawson

1964, the record indicates that the Warren Commission

had at least become aware that the CIA did maintain

telephonde surveillance of

the Cuban Embassy/Consulate.

(Slawson memorandum, March 12, 1964, Subj: meeting with

CIA representatives). Slawson's memoranaum reveals

the Warren Commission had learned that CIA lad In tos

Police (cite?).

Helms responded to the Com-

mission's request for access,

is that he would

attempt to arrange for the Warren Commission representatives'

to review

this material. (Slawson memo, March 12, 1964)

It shouldbe noted that the records reviewed do not

reveal the manner in which the Commission learned of the

Dorticos-Armas intercepts.". As detailed above, both the FBI

and White House (through McGeorge Bundy) were aware of the

CIA's telephonic surveillance activities in Mexico City.

(Cite)

One or the other could well have provided the war-

ren Commission with this information. Nevertheless, Ray-

mond Rocas' testimony as cited herein (Rocca dep.

lends some support to the position that the Commission had

been informed of the Dorticos-Armas conversations through

the CIA's initiative.

Another Slawson memorandum, dated March 25, 1964

concerned Oswald's trip to Mexico. Slawson therein stated

that the tentative conclusions concera

to Oswald's

Mexico trip,

that he had reached

were derived from CIA

memorandad of January 31, 1964 and February 19, 1964,

and in addition a Mexican federal police summary diatof

interrogations conducted shortly after the assassination

with certain Cuban Embassy employees. Slawson wrote:

A large part of it (the summary report) is

simply a summation of what the Mexican police

in Mexico City, and is therefore only as accu-.

rate as Mrs. Duran's testimony to the police.

These comments indicate that salwson placed limited

reliance upon the Mexican police summary. Moreover, there

is no indication that Salwson had been provided the Duran

telephond intercept transcripts. In fact, by virtue of

Slawson's comments conerning the Mejican police report,

it would appear that the Warren Commission as of March 25,

had been provided little substantive information pertaining

to Sylvia Duran.

insert p28

The Committee's belief that Slawson had not been

given access

to the Duran transcripts is further supported

by reference to his memorandum of March 27, 1964 (Cite)

wherein he states his conclusion that Oswald had visited

the Cuban Embassy on three occasions. This conclusion

vihe Commission had been

over three months in not exposing the surveillance opera-

tions to the review of the concerned Warren Commission

staff members. As was stated in the CIA cable of Decem-

ber 20, 1964 to its Mexico City Station:

Our present plan in passing information to

the Warren Commission is to eliminate mention

of telephone taps, in order to protect your

Logically, access to the

telephonic surveillance production would have clarified some

ambiguities. For example, on September 27, at 4:05 p.m.

Silvia Duran telephoned the Soviet Embassy and stated

that an American was presently at the Cuban Embassy, re-

questing an in-transit visit to Cuba. This American was

determined by CIA analysts to be Oswald. Again on Septem-

ber 28, at 11:51 a.m. Duran telephoned the Soviet Consulate

stating that an American, identified by CIA analysts as

Oswald

at the Cuban Embassy. Thus, o

the cit had twice

definitively established that Oswald had

visited the Cuban Embassy on at least two occasions.

Moreover, the specific datesand exact timesof his presence

established as the result of the

telephonic surveillance.

Had this information been made

available to Slawson, his calcuations of Oswald's activities

in Mexico City would have been more firmly established

than they were as of March 27, 1964. These transcripts

---

## Page 15

could have been made available to the Warren Commission

at its

nception but as. the record indicates they were

not then made available.

The record supports the Committee's finding that

as of April 2, 1964 the Warren Commission

• had still not

been given access to the above-referenced

series of tele-

phone intercepts. In a memorandum of that date by Coleman

and Slawson, they articulatedone question to the CIA and

two requests for information from the Agency (Ambassador

The second request, fitem number three of the above

listing reveals that the intercept of the Dorticos-Arman

conversation of November 22, 1964, in which the passing

to the Commission. The Commission had specifically requested

the Dorticos-Armas transcripts. Ot the March 12, 1964

meeting between Commission representatives and Agency re-

presentatives. (Cite.)

On April 3, 1964, Coleman and Slawson articulated

their concern for receiving complete access. to all materials

relevant to Oswald's Mexico City trip. They wrote:

The most probable final result of the entire

investigation of Oswald's activities in Mexico is

a conclusion that he went there for the purpose

of trying to reach Cuba and that no bribes, con-

spiracies, etc. took place.

## Page 17

Upon the group's' arrival in Mexico City, they were met

by U.S. Ambassador Freeman, Claire Boonstra of the State

Department, Clarke Anderson of the FBI, and Winston Scott of

the CIA.

That same day during a meeting between the Commission

representatives and Win Scott, Scott made available to the

group actual transcripts of the telephond surveillance

operations and English translations of the same. In addition,

he provided the group with reels of photographs for the

time period covered by Oswald's visit that had resulted from

photosurveillance of the Cuban and Soviet Embassy entrances

David Slawson wrote:

"...Mr. Scott stated at the beginning of his narrative

that he intended to make a complete disclosure of all

facts, including the sources of his information, and

that he understood that all three of us had been cleared

for TOP SECRET and that we would not disclose beyond

the confines of the Commission and its immediate staff

the information we obtained through him without first

clearing it with his superiors in Washington.

We

agreed to this." (Slawson memo, April 22, 1964, p. 22)

Mr. Scott described to the Commission representatives

the CIA's course of action immediately following the assassination..

Scott indicated that his staff a

CIA material forwarded to the Secret Service since November 23,

1964. Rocca then stated:

"Unless you feel otherwise, Jim would prefer

to wait out the Commission on the matter covered by

letter). If they come back on this point he feels

that you, or someone from here, should be prepared to

VIII.

Luisa Calderon

Approximately five hours after President Kennedy's

assassination, a Cuban government employee in Mexico City named

"Luisa" received a telephone call from an unidentified man

speaking Spanish. (MEXI 7105, 27 Nov. 63, FOIA 173-615, attach-

ment) This call had been intercepted and recorded by the CIA's

Mexico City Station as the result of its LIENVOY (tel. tap)

operation. (op cit) The Mexico City Station identified the

Luisa of the conversation as Luisa Calderon, who was then

employed in the Commercial Attache's office at the Cuban

Consulate.

During the course of the conversation, the unidentified

caller asked Luisa if she had heard the latest news. Luisa

replied in a joking tone:

"Yes, of course, I knew almost before Kennedy."

The callerwent on to tell Luisa that the person

apprehended for Kennedy's slaying was the "President of one of

the Committees of the Fair Play for Cuba." Luisa replied that

she knew this also. Luisa inquired whether the person being

held for the killing was a gringo. The unidentified caller

replied, "yes." Luisa told her caller that she had learned

nothing else about the assassination that she had learned

about the assassination only a little while ago. The

unidentified caller commented:

segregationists or against intergration

who

had killed Kennedy, then there was,

let's say, the possibility that a sort

of civil war would arise in the United

States; that contradictions would be

sharpened.. who knows

Luisa responded:

Imagine, one, two, three and now, that makes

• three. (She laughs.)

Raymond Rocca, fo

fol

steer, in response to

a 1975 Rockefeller Commission request for information on

a possible Cuban conspiracy to assassinate President

Kennedy wrote regarding Calderon's comments:

Latin hyperbole? Boastful ex post facto

suggestion of foreknowledge. This is the

only item in the intercept coverage of the

Cubans and Soviets after the assassination

that contains the suggestion of foreknow-

23 May 1975, p. 15)

Standing by itself, Luisa Calderon's cryptic com-

ments do not merit serious attention. Her words may in-

deed indicate foreknowledge. of the assassination but may

also-

Y be interpreted without such

a sinister impli-

cation. Nevertheless, as will be discussed herein, the

Committee has determined that Luisa Calderon's case did

merit serious attention in the months following the assas-

sination.

However, Calderon's comments were not reported

to the Warren Commission, apparently an agency oversight.

Calderon's 201 file reveals that she arrived in

Mexico City from Havana on January 16, 1964, carrying

Cuban Passport E/63/7. Her date of birth was believed

to be 1940 (Dispatch, HMMA21612) Calderon's presence in

Mexico City was first reported by the CIA on July 15,

1963 in a dispatch from the CIA's Miami field office to

the CIA's

Mexico City Station and to the Chief of the CIA's

Special Affairs Staff (for Cuban operations). That dis-

patch had attached to it a report containg biographic data

on personnel then assigned to the Cuban Embassy in Mexico

City. At page three of the attached report Luisa Calderon

was listed as Secretary of the Cuban Embassy's Commercial

Office. The notation indicated that a report was pending

on Calderon. The Agency has attempted, without success,

to locate the report.

knowledge of Calderon as

follows:

I thought that Luisa Calderon might have

had contact with Oswald because

I learned about

17 March 1964, shortly before I made

a trip to

Mexico, that she had been involved with an

American in Mexico.

The information to which

I refer was told to me by a DGI case officer...

I had commented to (him) that it seemed strange

that Luisa Calderon was receiving a salary from

the DGI althought she apparently did not do any

work for the Service. (The case officer) told

me that hers was a peculiar case and that he

himself believed that she had been recruited in

Mexico by the Central Intelligence Agency al-

though Manuel Pineiro,

the Head of the DGI, did

not agree.

As I recall, (the case officer) had

investigated Luisa Calderon. This was because,

during the time she was in Mexico, the DGI had

intercepted a

letter to her by an American who

signed his name OWER (phonetic) or something

similar.

As you know,

the pronunciation of

Anglo-Saxon names is difficult in Spanish so

I am not sure of how the name mentioned by Hernan-

dez should be spelled. It could have been "Howard"

or something different.

As I understand the matter,

the letter from the American was a love letter

but indicated that there was a clandestine-

professional relationship between the writer and

Luisa Calderon.

I also understand from (the

case officer) that after the interception of

the letter she had been followed and seen in the

company of an American.

I do not know if this

could have been Oswäld...

An earlier CIA dispatch from the CIA Chief of

Station in Mexico City to the Chief of the CIA's Western

Hemisphere Division records that:

Wilfredo of the Cuban Consulate, Tampico,

reported that Luisa Calderon has

a sister

residing in Reynosa, Texas... Luisa may go

up to the border to visit her sister soon--

or her mother may make the trip--details

not clear. (HMMA 21849, July 31, 1965)

At the very least, the above dispatches evidenced

an interest in Calderon's activities and those of her

family. Whether this interest took the form of a clan-

destine-agent relationship is

not revealed by Calderon's

201 file.

The Committee has queried the author of the above-

cited dispatch requesting that Calderon's sister be con-

tacted by the CIA's "domestic exploitation section."

David Ronis, the dispateir's author, was a member

of the CIA's Special Affairs staff at the time he wrote

the dispatch. He worked principally at CIA headquarters

and was 40n responsible for recruitment and handling

of...

of agents for collection/intelligence data. Mr. Ronis,

when interviewed by this Committee, stated that part of

his responsibility was to

scour the Western Hemisphere

division for operational leads related to the work of

the Special Affairs staff. Ronis recalled that he normally

response to these requests.

It was Ronis' recollection

that the above-cited domestic exploitation section was

a task force within the Special Affairs Staff.

He also

stated that in 1963 the CIA's Domestic Contacts Division

might have been requested to locate Luisa Calderon's sis-

ter.

Ronis told the Commitee that he had no recollection

of recruiting any person associated with the Cuban Intel-

ligence Service.

He did recall that he had recruited

women to perform tasks for the Agency. However, he did

not recall ever recruiting any employees of the Cuban

Embassy/Consulate in Mexico City. Finally, Mr. Ronis

stated that he had no recollection that Luisa Calderon

was associated with the CIA. (HSCA Staff Interview August

31, 1978)

Various present and former CIA representatives

were queried whether Luisa Calderon had ever been asso-

ciated with the CIA. The uniform answer was that no one

recalled such an association. (Cites: Helms, Hearing, August

As cited with regard to Luisa Calderon, a defec-

tor from the Cuban Intelligence Services provided the

CIA with significant information about Lee Harvey Oswald's

contacts with the DGI in Mexico City. This defector

was assigned the CIA cryptonym AMMUG-1 (A-1 hereinafter).*

CIA files reveal that A-l defected from the DGI

on April 21, 1964 in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. When

he defected, A-1 possessed a number of DGI documents which

were subsequently turned over to the CIA. (OTTA IN 68894,

24 April 64) Following his defection, a CIA officer,

Joseph H. Langosch, went to Canada to meet A-1, debrief

him, and arrange for A-l's travel into the United States.

OSC

(See supra cite.) On May 1, 1964, 22 reels of Langresh's

debriefing of A-l were forwarded to the Chief of the CIA's

Special Affairs Staff from the Chief of Station in Ottawa,

Canada. Effective on May 1, A-l was under contract with

the CIA for operational purposes. (Contract Approving Of-

ficer memo, 6 May 64) By June 23, 1964, Langosch was

convinced that A-I would be of great value to the Agency.

He stated:

There is no question in my mind that, AMMUG-1

*It is now known that A-l aid provide significant leads to

the CIA regarding Luisa Calderon.

It is further apparent

that little of this information was made available by the

CIA to the Warren Commission.

Therefore, the possibility

exists that A-l had provided other information to the CIA

that was relevant to the warren Commission's work but that which

was not properly reported to the Conmission.

A-1 knew who were the Cuban Intelligence officers

assigned to Mexico City. In this regard he untially

identified MEredo Mirabal, Manuel dega ant Rogelia Ródriguez

and the Comercial attache as DGI officers posted at the

Cuban Embaesy in Mexico City. (supra) Langosch described

A-l's knowledge of DGI operations in Mexico as follows:

In Mexico City, he knows who the intelligence

people are.

One is _the Cuban Consul Alfredo

Mirabal. He is called the Chief of the Centre.

That

is his title but he is actually the

intelligence chief, or at least he was until

another one is Rogelio.

Each of these concerns will be examined the

herein.

The CIA's concern for revealing the existence of

sensitive technical operations, as outlined above, was

evident from the

ception of the Warren Commission.

Mr. Scelso commented that "we were not authorized at first

to reveal all our technical operations." (Scelso dep.

p.158) Scelso further testified:

We were going to give them intelligence re-

ports which derived from all our sources, in-

cluding technical sources, including the tele-

phone intercept and the information gotten

from the interrogation of Silvia Duran, for

example, which corresponded almost exactly

with the information from the telephone inter-

cepts. (Ext to Scelso quote, all of p.5)

Mr. Scelso's characterization is supported by

examination of the background to the first major CIA

report furnished the warren commanmen regarding Lee Harvey

Oswald's trip to Mexico City. {Cite.) Much of the informa-

tion provided to the Warren Commission in this report was

based upon sensitive sources and methods, identification

of which had. been deleted completely from the report.

The

policy

limiting Warren Commission know-

ledge of CIA sources and methods was articulated as early

as December 20, 1963, at which time a cable was sent from

CIA headquarters to the Mexico City Station which stated:

The basic policy articulated in the December 20,

1963 cable is also set forth in a CIA memorandum of

December 17, 1963. In that memorandum, Birch O'Neal

/especial Investigations Group-

IV. Telephone Taps and Photo Surveillance

Mr. Helms offered testimony regarding the CIA's

reticence to inform the Warren Commission, at least during

the initial stage of the CIA's telephonic and photo sur-

veillance operations in Mexico City! Ma

Helms testified:

unle

The reason for the sensitivity of these tele-

phone taps and surveillance was not only be-

cause it was sensitive from the Agency's

standpoint, but the telephone taps were run-

ning in conjunction with the Mexican authori-LT

ties and therefore, if this had become public

knowledge, it would have caused very bad feel-

ings between Mexico and the United States,

and that was the reason. (Helms Exec Session

On February 1, 1964, Helms appeared before the

Commission (see above) and likely discussed the memoran-

dum of January Si , 1964. On Feburary 10, 1964, J. Lee

Rankin wrote Helms in regard to the CIA memorandum of

January 31. A review of Rankin's letter indicates that

want as of his writirs..

*, the Warren Commission

had no substantive knowledge of the telephond surveillance

operation or the production i.e., the tapes and trans-

cripts, from that operation. Rankin inquired in the Feb-

ruary 10, 1964 letter whether Oswald's direct communica-

tion with employees of the Soviet Embassy (as stated in

of the January 31 memorandum) had been facilitated

by telephone or interview. Manifestly, if the Warren Com-

mission had been informed of the telephong surveillance

operation and its success in tapping Oswald this inquiry

by Rankin would not have been made. Good paiut.

Raymond Rocca's testimony tends to support this

conclusion. It was Rocca's recollection that between

the time period of January 1964 - April 1964, Warren Com-

•.—.

mission's representatives had visited the CIA's headquar-

ters in Langley; Virginia and had been shown various trans-

cripts resulting from the CIA's telephond surveillance

operations in Mexico City. (Rocca dep. p.89) However,

Mr. Rocca did not personally make this material available

to Commission representatives and was not able to state

CIA's telephonic surveillance activities in Mexico City.

Another Slawson memorandum, dated March 25, 1964

concerned Oswald's trip to Mexico. Slawson therein stated

that the tentative conclusions Cancerous Oswald's

Mexico trip,

that he had reached

were derived from CIA

memorandad of January 31, 1964 and February 19, 1964,

and in addition a Mexican federal police summary sarof

interrogations conducted shortly after the assassination

with certain Cuban Embassy employees. Slawson wrote:

A large part of it (the summary report) is

simply a summation of what the Mexican police

learned when they interrogated Mrs. Silvia

Duran, (sic) an employee of the Cuban Consulate

in Mexico City, and is therefore only as accu-

rate as Mrs. Duran's testimony to the police.

These comments indicate that salwson placed limited

reliance upon the Mexican police summary. Moreover, there

is no indication that Salwson had been provided the Duran

telephonk intercept transcripts. In fact, by virtue of

Slawson's comments conerning the Meircan police report,

it would appear that the warren Commission as of March 25g

had been provided little substantive information pertaining

to Sylvia Duran.

Insert pz8

The Committee's belief that Slawson had not been

given access to the Duran transcripts is further supported

by reference to his memorandum of March 27, 1964 (Cite)

wherein he states his conclusion that Oswald had visited

the Cuban Embassy on three occasions. This conclusion

he ste we based upon an analysis of sylvia Duran's testi-

mony before the Mexican police.

Upon the group's arrival in Mexico City, they were met

by U.S. Ambassador Freeman, Claire Boonstra of the State

representatives and Win Scott, Scott made

"Scott's narrative plus the material we were shown dis-

closed immediately how incorrect our previous

information had been in Oswald's contacts with the

Soviet and Mexican Embassies.

Apparently the

distortions and omissions to which our information had

been subjected had entered some place in Washington,

because the CIA information that we were shown by Scott

was unambiguous on almost all the crucial points. We

had previously planned to show Scott, Slawson's

reconstruction of Oswald's probable activities at the

embassies to get Scott's opinion, but once we saw how

badly distorted our information was we realized that

this would be useless.

Therefore, instead, we decided

to take as close note as possible from the original

source materials at some later time during our visit."

Slawson's memorandum of April 21, 1964 records the results

of the notetaking from original source materials that he did

following Scott's disclosures. These notes dealtexclusively

with the telephonic interceptspertaining orrespectively the

Duran and Oswald conversations Sorfle period Sept a 7-Out 1, 1963.

It meant that as

Luisa Calderon

Approximately five hours after President Kennedy's.

assassination, a Cuban government employee in Mexico City named

"Luisa" received a telephone call from an unidentified man

speaking Spanish. (MEXI 7105, 27 Nov. 63, FOIA 173-615, attach-

ment) This call had been intercepted and recorded by the CIA's

Mexico City Station as the result of its LIENVOY (tel. tap)

operation. (op cit) The Mexico City Station identified the

Luisa of the conversation as Luisa Calderon, who was then

employed in the Commercial Attache's office at the Cuban

Consulate.

During the course of the conversation, the unidentified

caller asked Luisa if she had heard the latest news. Luisa

replied in a joking tone:

"Yes, of course, I knew almost before Kennedy."

The callerwent on to tell Luisa that the person

apprehended for Kennedy's slaying was the "President of one of

the Committees of the Fair Play for Cuba." Luisa replied that

she knew this also. Luisa inquired whether the person being

held for the killing was a gringo. The unidentified caller

replied, "yes." Luisa told her caller that she had learned

nothing else about the assassination; that she had learned

about the assassination only a little while ago.

The

unidentified caller commented:

---

We think that if it had been or had

one of the

segregationists or against intergration

who had killed Kennedy, then there was,

let's say, the possibility that a sort

of civil war would arise in the United

States; that contradictions would be

sharpened...who knows

Luisa responded:

Imagine, one,

two, three and now, that makes

three. (She laughs.)

Raymond Rocca, fo

fos

in response to

a 1975

Rockefeller Commission request for information on

a possible Cuban conspiracy to assassinate President

Kennedy wrote regarding Calderon's comments:

Latin hyperbole? Boastful ex post facto

suggestion of foreknowledge. This is the

only item in the intercept coverage of the

Cubans and

Soviets after the assassination

that contains the suggestion of foreknow-

ledge or expectation. (Rocca memo for DC/OPS,

23 May 1975, p. 15)

Standing by itself, Luisa Calderon's cryptic com-

ments do not merit serious attention. Her words may in-

deed indicate foreknowledge of the assassination but may

also-

y be interpreted without such

a sinister impli-

cation.

Nevertheless, as will be discussed herein, the

Committee has determined that Luisa Calderon's case did

merit serious attention in the months following the assas-

sination. However, Calderon's

comments were not reported

to the Warren Commission, apparently an agency oversight.

## Page 55

Calderon's 201 file reveals that she arrived in

Mexico City from Havana on January 16, 1964, carrying

Cuban Passport E/63/7. Her date of birth was believed

to be 1940 (Dispatch, HMMA21612) Calderon's presence in

Mexico City was first reported by the CIA on July 15,

1963 in a dispatch from the CIA's Miami field office to

the CIA's Mexico City Seêtion and to the Chief of the CIA's

Special Affairs Staff (for Cuban operations). That dis-

patch had attached to it a report containg biographic data

on personnel then assigned to the Cuban Embassy in Mexico

City. At page three of the attached report Luisa Calderon

was listed as Secretary of the Cuban Embassy's commercial

office. The notation indicated that a report was pending

on Calderon. The Agency has attempted, without success,

to locate the report.

On September 1, 1963, a dispatch was sent from

the Chief of the Special Affairs Staff to the Chief of

indent

tke Station in Mexico City (Dispatch HMMW 11935) •

Luisa Calderon's association with the Cuban DGI

was first reported by the CIA on May 5, 1964. At that

time, Harold Swenson, Chief of Counterintelligence for the

Special Affairs Staff, recorded the results of his de-

briefing of the Cuban defector, AMMUG-1. The memorandum

states that AMMuG had no direct knowledge of lee Harvey

Oswald or his activities but was able to provide items

of interest based upon the comments of certain Cuban In-

# This dispatch reported that:

telligence Service officers. Specifically, AMMUG-1 had

been

asked if Oswald was known to the Cuban

intelligence

services before November 23, 1963. AMMUG-1 told Swenson,

as recorded in the May 5 memorandum that "Prior to October

1963, Oswald visited the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City on

two or three occasions. Before, during and after these

visits, Oswald was in contact with the Direccion General

De Intelligencia (DGI), specifically with Luisa Calderon,

Manuel Vega Perez, and Rogelio Rodriguez Lopez.

Swenson thereafter wrote that Calderon's precise

relationship to the DGI was not clear. As a comment to

this statement he set forth the CIA cable and dispatch

traffic which recorded her arrival in Mexico and departure, during.

Deafrike 1164

for Cuba.

On May 7, 1964, Swenson recorded additional informa-

tion he had elicited from AMMUG-1 regarding Oswald's

possible contact with the DGI. Paragraph 3 of this memoran-

dum stated in part:

"a. Luisa Calderon, since she returned to

Cuba, has been paid a regular salary

by the DGI even

though she has not per-

formed any services.

Her home is in

the Vedado section where the rents are

high.

b. Source (AMMUG) has known Calderon for

several years. Before going to Mexico,

she worked in the Ministry of Exterior

Commerce in the department which was

known as the "Empress Transimport."

Her title was Secretary General of the

Communist Youth in the department named

in the previous sentence.

???'

---

## Page 57

- 49 -

On May 8 Swenson further disclosed AMMUG's know-

ledge of the Oswald case. Swenson paraphrased AMMUG'S

knowledge of Calderon as follows:

I thought that Luisa Calderon might have

had contact with Oswald because I learned about

17 March 1964, shortly before I made

a trip to

Mexico, that she had been involved with an

American in Mexico. The information to which

I refer was told to me by a DGI case officer...

I had commented to (him)

that it seemed strange

that Luisa Calderon was receiving a salary from

the DGI althought she apparently did not do any

work for the Service.

(The case officer) told

me that hers was a peculiar case and that he

himself believed that she had been recruited in

Mexico by the Central Intelligence Agency al-

though Manuel Pineiro,

the Head of the DGI, did

not agree.

As I recall, (the case officer) had

investigated Luisa Calderon.

This was because,

during the time she was in Mexico, the DGI had

intercepted a letter to her by an

American who

signed his name OWER (phonetic) or something

similar.

As you know,

the pronunciation of

Anglo-Saxon names is difficult in Spanish so

I am not sure of how

the name mentioned by Hernan-

dez should be spelled.

It could have been "Howard"

or something different.

As I understand the matter,

the letter from the American was a love letter

but indicated that there was a clandestine-

professional relationship between the writer and

I also understand

from (the

case officer) that after the interception of

the letter she had been followed and seen in the

company of an American.

On May 15, 1964, Helms wrote Rankin regarding

AMMUG's information about the DGI, indicating its sensi-

tivity and operational significance. Attached to Helms'

communication was a paraphrased accounting of Swenson's

May 5 memorandum. (Helm's memo, May 15, 1964, FOIA 697-294) .

In that attachment the intelligence associations of

Manuel Vega Perez and Rogelio Rodriguez Lopez Sue set

forth. However, that attachment hakes no reference what-

soever to Luisa Calderon.

Howard Willens of the Warren Commission, requested

as a follow-up to

the May 15 memorandum, to look at the

questions used in Swenson's interrogation of AMMUG. (Dooley

memo to Rocca, 19. June

1964 FOIA 739-310). On June 18,

1964 Arthur Dooley of Rocca's counterintelligence research

and analysis group took the questions and AMMUG's responses

to the Warren Commission's officers for Willen's review.

Willens saw Swenson's May 5. memorandum. The only mention

of folderon was as follows: "The precise relationship of

Luisa Calderon to the DGI is not clear. She spent about

six months in Mexico from

which she returned to Cuba early

in 1964.

However, Willens was not shown the Swenson memoran-

dum of May 7 and May 8, 1964 which contained much more

detailed information on Luisa Calderon, including her possible

Each of these concerns will be examined

herein.

The CIA's concern for revealing the existence of

sensitive technical operations,

as outlined above, was

evident from the s

"ception of the Warren Commission.

Mr. Scelso commented that "we were not authorized at first

to reveal all our technical operations." (seato ep.

But

p.158)

did

Scelso further testifiga that :

We were going to give them intelligence re-

ports which derived from all our sources, in-

cluding technical sources, including the tele-

phone intercept and the information gotten

from the interrogation of Silvia Duran, for

example, which corresponded almost exactly

with the information from the telephone inter-

cepts. (Ext to seelsa quote, all of pr5)

Ibit

Mr. Scelso's characterization is supported by

examination of the background to the first major CIA

report furnished the Warren Commission regarding Lee Harvey

swald's trip to Mexico City.

tion provided to the Warren Commission in this report was

based upon sensitive sources and methods, identification

of which had been deleted completely from the report.

GIA

The

policy

limiting Warren Commission know-

ledge of CIA sources and methods was articulated as early

as December 20, 1963, at which time a cable was sent from

CIA headquarters to the Mexico City Station which stated:

Our present plan in passing information to the

Warren Commission is to eliminate mention of tele-

IV. Telephone Taps and Pheto Surveillance

Mr. Helms offered testimony regarding the CIA's

reticence to inform the Warren Commission, at least during

the initial stage of the CIA's telephonic and photo sur-

veillance operations in Mexico City!

Helms-testified:

The reason for the sensitivity of these tele-

phone taps and surveillance was not only be-

cause it was sensitive from the Agency's

standpoint, but the telephone taps were run-

ning in conjunction with the Mexican authoritY

tiesland therefore, if this had become public

On Feburary 10, 1964, J. Lee

Rankin wrote Helms in regard to

the CIA memorandum of

January 31.

A review of Rankin's letter indicates that.

at tarad as of e

his wastirse, the Warren Commission

had no substantive knowledge of the telephone surveillance

operation or the production i.e., the tapes and trans-

cripts, from that operation. Rankin inquired in the Feb-

ruary 10, 1964 letter whether Oswald's direct communica-

tion with employees of the Soviet Embassy (as stated in

Pottagraph of the January 31 memorandun) had been facilitated

by telephone or interview. Manifestly, if the Warren Com-

mission had been informed of the telephond surveillance

operation and its success in tapping Oswald this inguiry

by Rankin would not have been made. Syst

Raymond Rocca's testimony tends to support this

conclusion. It was Rocca's recollection that between

the time period of January 1964 - April 1964, Warren Com-

mission's representatives had visited the CIA's headquar-

ters in Langley; Virginia and had been shown various trans-

cripts resulting from the CIA's telephond surveillance

Another Slawson memorandum, dated March 25, 1964

concerned Oswald's trip to Mexico. Slawson therein stated

that the tentative conclusions? Concernu"t Oswald's

that he had reached

were derived from CIA

memorandas of January 31, 1964 and February 19, 1964, Slandândum

a in addition a Mexican federal police summary a of paa64,

interrogations conducted shortly after the assassination

with certain Cuban Embassy employees. Slawson wrote:

A large part of it (the summary report) is

simply a summation of what the Mexican police

learned when they interrogated Mrs. Silvia

Duran, (sic an employee of the Cuban Consulate

in Mexico City, and

is therefore only as accu-

rate as Mrs. Duran's testimony to the police. LIbial

These comments indicate that Salson placed limited

reliance upon the Mexican police summary. Moreover, there

is no indication that Salwson had been provided the Duran

telephonk intercept transcripts. In fact, by virtue of

Slawson's comments conerning the Mejican police report,

it would appear that the Warren Commission, as of March 25,

had been provided little substantive information pertaining

to Sylvia Duran.

The Committee's belief that Slawson had not been

"We did not initially disclose to the Warren

In other

words, we did not initially disclose to them that we

had photosurveillance because the November photo we had

(of MMM) was not of Oswald. Therefore it did not mean

anything, you see?"

...So the Agency was making a unilateral

decision that this was not relevant to the Warren

CIA material forwarded to the Secret Service since November 23,

1964.

Rocca then stated:

• On May 8 Swenson further disclosed AMMUG's know-

ledge of the Oswald case. Strenson paraphrased AMMUG'S

knowledge of Calderon as follows:

I thought that Luisa Calderon might have

had contact with Oswald because I learned about

17 March 1964, shortly before I made

a trip to

Mexico, that she had been involved with an

American in Mexico.

The information to which

I refer was told to me by a DGI case officer...

I had commented to (him) that it seemed strange

that Luisa Calderon was receiving a salary from

the DGI althought she apparently did not do any

work for the Service. (The case officer) told

me that hers was a peculiar case and that he

himself believed that she had been recruited

in

Mexico by the Central Intelligence Agency al-

though Manuel Pineiro,

the Head of the DGI, did

not agree.

As I recall, (the case officer) had

investigated Luisa Calderon.

This was because,

during the time she was in Mexico, the DGI had

intercepted a letter to her by an American who

signed his name OWER (phonetic) or something

As you know, the pronunciation of

Anglo-Saxon names is difficult in Spanish so

I am not sure of how the name mentioned by Hernan-

dez should be spelled.

It could have been "Howard"

or something different.

As I understand the matter,

the letter from the American was a love letter

but indicated that there was a clandestine-

professional relationship between the writer and

Luisa Calderon.

I also understand from (the

case officer) that after the interception of

the letter she had been followed and seen in the

company of an American.

I do not know if this

could have been Oswald...( Ibid)

On May 11, Raymond Rocca wrote a memorandum

to Director Richard Helms regarding the information Swenson
