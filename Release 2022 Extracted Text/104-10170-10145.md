MEMORANDUM

SUBJECT: Ramparts:. John Garrett UNDERHILL Jrt,
Samuel George CUMMINGS, and

INTERARMCO

1. Ramparts of June 1967, Vol..5, No, 12, pp. 28-29, contains
the following passages about Subjects: :

“phe day after the assassination, Gary Underhill left
Washington in a hurry. Late in the evening he showed up
at the home of friends in New Jersey. He was very agitated.
‘A small clique within the CIA was responsible for the as~
sassination, he confided, and he was afraid for his life and
probably would have to leave the country. Less than six
months later Underhill was found shot to death in his
Washington apartment. The coroner ruled it suicide.

"J. Garrett Underhill had been an intelligence agent
during World War Ht and was a recognized authority on limi~
ted warfare and small arms. A researcher and writer on
military affairs, he was ona first-name basis with many of
the top brass in the Pentagon. He was also on intimate terms
with a number of high-ranking CLA officials--he was one of
the Agency's ‘un-people! who perform special assignments.
At one time he had been a friend of ‘Samuel Cummings of
Interarmco, the arms broker that numbers among its cus
tomers the CIA and, ironically, Klein's Sporting Goods of
Chicago, from whence /sic/ the mail-order Carcano alleg~
edly was purchased by Oswald.

“The friends whom Underhill visited say he was sober
but badly shook. They say he attributed the Kennedy
murder to a CIA clique which was carrying on a lucrative
racket in gun-running, narcotics and other contraband,
and manipulating political intrigue to serve its own ends.
Kennedy supposedly got wind that sonicthing was going oa
and.was:killed before he could ‘blow the whistle on it’.

* Although the friends had always known Underhill to be
perfectly rational and objective, they at first didn't take
his account seriously. 'I think the main reason was.'
explains the husband, ‘that we couldn't believe that the
GIA could contain a corrupt clement every bit as ruth-
lese--and more efficient--as the mafia."

“phe verdict of suicide in Underhill's death is by no
means convincing. His body was found by a writing
collaborator, Asher Brynes of the’'New Republic. He
had been shot behind the left ear, and an automatic pi
was under his left side. Odd, says Brynes, because
Underhill was right-handed. Brynes thinks the pistol
was fitted with a‘silencer, and occupants of the apartment
building couid not recall hearing a shot. Underhill obvi-
ously had been dead several days.

"Garry Underhill's chilling story is hardly implausible.
‘Aa a spy apparatus the CIA is honeycomibed with ‘self-
contained cliques operating without any real central control. +
