MEMORANDUM

This reconstruction of Agency involvement in plans to

assassinate Fidel Castro is at best an imperfect history. Because
of the extreme sensitivity of the operations being discussed or
attempted, as a matter of principle no official records were kept
“of planning, of approvals, or of implementation. The few written
records that do exist are either largely tangential to the main
events or were put on paper from memory years afterward.” William
Harvey has retained skeletal notes of his activities during the
years in question, and they are our best source of dates. Dr.

C Edward Gunn, of the Office of Medical Services, has a record of
whom he met and when and cryptic references to the subjects discussed.
Ray Treichler, of TSD, has a record of two or three dates that are
pertinent. Gunn and Treichler were involved in only the technical
aspects of operational planning, and their participations were short-
lived. Although fragmentary, their records are a help in establishing
critical time frames. Operational files are useful in some instances,
because they give dates of meetings, the substances of which may be
inferred from collateral information.

“-For the most part, though, we have had to rely on information

given to us orally by people whose memories are fogged by time.

Their recollections of dates are particularly hazy, and some of them

fare no longer able to keep the details of one plan separate from. those
of another. We interviewed everyone whom we could identify as likely
to be knowledgeable, with the exceptions of Mr. Dulles and General
Cabell. A complete list is attached at Tab A. We did not go on
fishing expeditions among the mere possibles. To have done so would
shave risked making witting a number of employees who were previously
‘mwitting and, in our estimate, would have added little to the details
available from those directly involved. There are inconsistencles
among the various accounts, but most of them can be resolved by.
collating the information furnished by all of the identifiable
participants. in a particular plan and by then checking it against

Gc specific dates that can be fixed with fair certainty. We believe
that this reconstruction of what happened.and of the thinking
associated with it is reasonably Moana If there are significant
inaccuracies in the report, they are most likely to occur in faulty
ordering of the sequence of events. People still remember much of
what happened, but they can no longer recall precisely when.

It became clear very early in our investigation that the vigor 7
with which Penna were pursued within the Agency to eliminate Castro
personally varied with the intensity of the U.S. Government's efforts
to overthrow the Castro regime. We can identify five separate phases

in Agency assassination planning, although ‘the transitions from one

.NW 64937 Doctd:32273908 Page 11


OLUHEI-LiLO UnLY

to another are not always sharply defined. Each phase is a reflection
of the then prevailing Government attitude toward the Cuban regime.

a. Prior to August 1960: All of the identifiable schemes
prior to about August 1960, with one possible exception, were
aimed only at discrediting Castro personally by influencing
his behaviour or by altering his appearance.

b. August 1960 to April 1961: The plots that were hatched
in late 1960 and early 1961 were aggressively pursued and were
viewed by at least some of the participants as being merely one
aspect of the over-all active effort to overthrow the regime
that culminated in the Bay of Pigs.

©) c. April 1961 to late 1961: A major scheme that was
begun in August 1960 was called off after the Bay of Pigs and
remained dormant for several.months, as did most other Agency
operational activity related to Cuba.

ad. Late 1961 to late 1962: That particular scheme was
reactivated in early 1962 and was again pushed vigorously in the
era of Project MONGOOSE and in the climate of intense admini-
stration pressure on CIA to do something about Castro and his

Cuba.
e. Late 1962 until well into 1963: After the Cuban missile

crisis of October 1962 and the collapse of Project MONGOOSE, the

iar ane

aggressive scheme that was begun in August 1960 and revived in

April 1962 was finally terminated in early 1963. Two other

plots were originated in 1963, but both were impracticable

and nothing ever came of them.
We cannot overemphasize the extent to which responsible Agency

Kenned:

-officers felt themselves subject to the/administration's severe
pressures to do something about Castro and his regime. The fruitless
and, in retrospect, often unrealistic plotting should be viewed in
that light.

Many of those we interviewed stressed two points that are so
obvious that recording them here may be superfluous. We believe,

(@ though, that they are pertinent to the story. Elimination of the

dominant figure ina government, even when loyalties are held to him
personally rather than to the government as a body, will not
necessarily cause the downfall of the government. ‘This point was
stressed with respect to Castro and Cuba in an internal CIA draft
paper of October 1961, which was initiated in response to General
Maxwell Taylor's desire for a contingency plan. The paper took the
position that the demise of Fidel Castro, from whatever cause, would
offer little opportunity for the liberation of Cuba from Communist
and Soviet Bloc control. The second point, which is more specifically
relevant to our investigation, is that bringing about the downfall of

a govermment necessarily requires the removal of its leaders from

positions of power, and there is always the risk that the partici-
pants will resort to assassination. Such-remoyals—frem—pewer-ee-the

There is a third point, which was not directly made by any of

those we interviewed, but which emerges clearly from the interviews

and from review of files. The point is that of frequent resort to
synecdoche--the mention of a part when the whole is to be understood,
or vice versa. Thus, we encounter repeated references to phrases such
as "disposing of Castro," which may be read in the narrow, literal
sense of assassinating him, when it is intended that it be read in
‘the broader, figurative sense of dislodging the Castro regime.
Reversing the coin, we find people speaking vaguely of "doing some-
thing about Castro" when it is clear that what they have specifically
in mind is killing him. Ina situation wherein those speaking may
not have actually meant what they seemed to say or may not have said
what they actually meant, they should not be surprised if their oral
shorthand is interpreted differently than was intended.

The suggestion was made to us that operations aimed at the
assassination of Castro may have been generated in an atmosphere of

stress in intelligence publications on the possibility of Castro's

NW 64937 Doctld:32273908 Page 14


SECREI-EVES ORLY

demise and on the reordering of the political structure that would
follow. We reviewed intelligence publications from 1960 through

1966, including National Intelligence Estimates, Special National
Intelligence Estimates, Intelligence Memorandums, and Memorandums

for the Director. The NIE's on "The Situation and Prospects in Cuba”

‘for 1960, 1963, and 1964 have brief paragraphs on likely successor

governments if Castro were to depart the scene. We also find similar
short references in a SNIE of March 1960 and in an Intelligence
Memorandum of May 1965. In each case the treatment is no more nor
less than one would expect to find in comprehensive round-ups such
as these. We conclude that there is no reason to believe that the
operators were unduly influenced by the content of intelligence
publications.

Drew Pearson's colum of 7 March 1967 refers to'’a reported CIA
plan in 1963 to assassinate Cuba's Fidel Castro. Pearson also has
information, as yet unpublished, to the effect that there was a
meeting at the State Department at which assassination of Castro
was discussed and that a team actually landed in Cuba with pills to
be used in an assassination attempt. There is basis in fact for each
of those three reports.

a. A CIA officer passed an assassination weapon to an

Agency Cuban asset at a meeting in Paris on 22 November 1963.

The weapon was a ballpoint pen rigged as a hypodermic syringe.

SECRET—EVES GiLY

NW 64937 Doctd:32273908 Page 15

os


ocbncl—ErkS ONLY

5 The CIA officer suggested that the Cuban asset load the syringe
with Black Leaf 40. The evidence indicates that the meeting
was under way at the very moment President Kennedy was shot.
b. There was a meeting of the Special Group (Augmented)
in Secretary Rusk's conference room on 10 August 1962 at which
Secretary McNamara broached the subject of liquidation of
Cuban leaders. The discussion resulted in a Project MONGOOSE
action memorandum prepared by Edward Lansdale. At another
Special Group meeting on 31 July 1964 there was discussion of
a recently-disseminated Clandestine Services information report
on a Cuban exile plot to assassinate Castro. CIA had refused
© the exile's request for funds and had no involvement in the plot.
ec. CIA twice (first in early 1961 and again in early 1962)
supplied lethal pills to U.S. gambling syndicate members working
in behalf of CIA on a plot to assassinate Fidel Castro. The 1961
plot aborted and the pills were recovered. Those furnished in
April 1962 were passed by the gambling syndicate representative
to a Cuban exile leader in Florida, who in turn had them sent to
cuba about May 1962. In June 1962 the exile leader reported that
a team of three men had been dispatched to Cuba to recruit for the
operation. If the opportunity presented itself, the team would

make an attempt on Castro's life--perhaps using the pills.

Miscellaneous Schemes Prior to August 1960

March to August 1960

We find evidence of at least three, and perhaps four, schemes
that were under consideration well before the Bay of Pigs, but we
, can fix the time frame only speculatively. Those who have some
Imowledge of the episodes guessed at dates ranging from 1959 through
1961. ‘The March-to-August span we have fixed may be too narrow, but
it best fits the limited evidence we have.

a. None of those we interviewed who was first assigned to
the Cuba task force after the Bay of Pigs knows of any of these
schemes.

b. J.D. (Jake) Esterline, who was head of the Cuba task
force in pre-Bay of Pigs days, is probably the most reliable
witness on general timing. He may not have been privy to the
precise details of any of the plans, but he seems at least to
have known of all of them. He is no longer able to keep the
details of one plan separate from those of another, but each of the
facets he recalls fits somewhere into one of ‘the schemes. Hence,
“we conclude that all of these schemes were under consideration
while Esterline had direct responsibility for Cuba operations.

ce. Esterline himself furnishes the best clue as to the

OLOKEITLILD ULE

possible time span. He thinks it unlikely that any planning
of this sort would have progressed to the point of consideration
of means until after U.S. policy concerning Cuba was decided
upon about March 1960. By about the end of the third quarter
of 1960, the total energies of the task force were concentrated
on the main-thrust effort, and there would have been no interest
in nor time for pursuing such wills-o'-the-wisp as these.
We are unable to establish even a tentative sequence among the schemes;
they may, in fact, have been under consideration simultaneously. We
find no evidence that any of these schemes was approved at any
level higher than division, if that. We think it most likely that
¢ no higher-level approvals were sought, because none of the schemes
progressed to the point where approval to launch would have been

needed.
Aerosol Attack on Radio Station

Ray Treichler, of TSD, remembers discussion of a scheme to
contaminate the air of the radio studio where Castro broadcast his
speeches with an aerosol spray of a chemical that produces reactions
similar to those of lysergic acid (LSD). Nothing came of the idea.
Treichler said he had discouraged the scheme, because the chemical

could not be relied upon to be effective. Henry Bortner, also of TSD,

SECRET—EViS ONLY

NW 64937 Doctd:32273908 Page 20


OEUKEI—LiLd ULE

recalls experimentation with psychic energizers but cannot relate it
to Castro as a target. We found no one else who remembered anything
of this plot, with the possible exception of Jake Esterline who

may have it confused with other schemes.
Contaminated Cigars

Jake Esterline claims to have had in his possession in pre-Bay
of Pigs days a box of cigars that had been treated with some sort
of chemical. In our first interview with him, his recollection was
that the chemical was intended to produce temporary personality
disorientation. The thought was to somehow contrive to have Castro
smoke one before making a speech and then to make a public spectacle
of himself. Esterline distinctly recalls having had the cigars in
his personal safe until he left wH/4 and that they definitely were
intended for Castro. He does not remember how they came into his
possession, but he thinks they must have been prepared by Ray Treichler.
In a second interview with Esterline, we mentioned that we had learned
since first speaking with him of a scheme to cause Castro's beard to
fall out. He then said that his cigars might have been associated
with-that plan. Esterline finally said that, although it was
evident that he no longer remembered the intended effect of the
cigars, he was positive they were not lethal. The cigars were never

used, according to Esterline, because WH/% could not figure out how
to deliver them without danger of blowback on the Agency. He says
he destroyed them before leaving WH/4 in June 1961.

Sidney Gottlieb, of TSD, claims to remember distinctly a plot
involving cigars. To emphasize the clarity of his memory, he named
“the officer, then assigned to wWH/CA, who approached him with the
scheme. Although there may well have been such a plot, the officer
Gottlieb named was then assigned in India and has never worked in
WH Division nor had anything to do with Cuba operations. Gottlieb
remembers the scheme as being one that was talked about frequently
O but not widely and as being concerned with killing, not merely with
influencing behaviour. As far as Gottlieb knows, this idea never
got beyond the talking stage. TSD may have gone ahead and prepared
the cigars just in case, but Gottlieb is certain that he did not get
the DD/P's (Richard Bissell) personal approval to release them, as would
have been done if the operation had gone that far. We are unable to
discover whether Esterline and Gottlieb are speaking of a single
cigar episode or of two unrelated schemes. We found no one else with
firm recollections of lethal cigars being considered prior to August

1960.

OLLKEI— LILO UNLT

Depilatory

Ray Treichler recalls a scheme involving thallium salts, a
1 chemical used by women as a depilatory--the thought being to destroy
Castro's image as "The Beard" by causing the beard to fall out.
The chemical may be administered either orally or by absorption
through the skin. The right dosage causes depilation; too much
| produces paralysis. Treichler believes that the idea originated in
connection with a trip Castro was to have made outside of Cuba. The
idea was to dust thallium powder into Castro's shoes when they were
| put out at night to be shined. The scheme progressed as far as
C procuring the chemical and testing it on animals. Treichler's
recollection is that Castro did not make the intended trip, and
the scheme fell through. Henry Bortner remembers consideration
being given to use of thallium salts (perhaps against Castro) and
something having to do with boots or shoes. Treichler does not
remember with whom he dealt on this plot. We found no one else

“with firm knowledge of it.

Gambling Syndicate

The first seriously-pursued CIA plan to assassinate Castro had
its inception in August 1960. It involved the use of members of

the criminal underworld with contacts inside Cuba. The operation

“had two phases: the first ran from August 1960 until late April

or early May 1961, when it was called off following the Bay of Pigs;
the second ran from April 1962 until February 1963 and was merely

a revival of the first phase which had been inactive since about

May 1961.
Gambling Syndicate - Phase 1
August 1960 yl

Richard Bissell, Deputy Director for Plans, asked Sheffield
Edwards, Director of Security, if Edwards could establish contact
with the U.S. gambling syndicate that was active in Cuba. The
objective clearly was the assassination of Castro although Edwards
Claims that there was a studied avoidance of the term in his
conversation with Bissell. Bissell recalls that the idea originated
with J. C. King, then Chief of WH Division, although King now
recalls having had only limited knowledge of such a plan and ata

much later date--about mid-1962.

Edwards consulted Robert A. Maheu, a private investigator who

had done sensitive work for the Agency, to see if Maheu had any

re

underworld contacts. Maheu was once a special agent of the FBI.

He opened a private office in Washington in 1956. The late Robert
Cunningham, of the Office of Security (and also a former Special
“Agent with the FBI), kmew Maheu and kmew that his business was having
@ shaky start financially. Cunningham arranged to subsidize Maheu

to the extent of $500 per month. Within six months Maheu was doing

so well financially that he suggested that the retainer be discontinued.
Over the years he has been intimately involved in providing support
for some of the Agency's more sensitive operations. He has since
moved his personal headquarters to Los Angeles but retains a
Washington office. A more detailed account of Maheu's background
appears in a separate section of this report.

(Comment : Although we see nothing sinister in it, we are
struck by the fact that so many of the persons whose names appear
in this account once worked for the FBI. We have already named
Cunningham and Maheu. Later to appear are William Harvey, James

O'Connell, and Edward Morgan. )

Maheu acknowledged that he had a contact who might furnish
access to the criminal underworld, but Maheu was most reluctant to

allow himself to be involved in such an assignment. He agreed to

3: te 2

SECRET—EVES ONLY

NW 64937 Doctd:32273908 Page 26


SECRET—EYES ONLY

participate only after being pressed by Edwards to do so. Maheu
identified his contact as one Johnny Roselli, who lived in Los
Angeles and had the concession for the ice-making machines on "the
strip” in Las Vegas and whom Maheu understood to be a member of the
syndicate. Maheu was known to Roselli as a man who had a number of
‘large business organizations as clients. Edwards and Maheu agreed
that Maheu would approach Roselli as the representative of business-
men with interests in Cuba who saw the elimination of Castro as the
essential first step to the recovery of their investments. Maheu
was authorized to tell Roselli that his "clients" were willing to

pay $150,000 for Castro's removal.

September 1960

Shef Edwards named as his case officer for the operation

James P. O'Connell (a former Special Agent of the FBI), then Chief,
Operational Support Division, Office of Security. O'Connell and
Maheu met Roselli in New York City on 14 September 1960 where Maheu
made the pitch. Roselli initially was also reluctant to become
involved, but finally agreed to introduce Maheu to "Sam Gold" who
either had or could arrange contacts with syndicate elements in Cuba
who might handle the job. Roselli said he had no interest in being

paid for his participation and believed that "Gold" would feel the

-16-

NW 64937 Doctd:32273908 Page 27



SECRET—EYES ONLY

same way. A memorandum for the record prepared by Sheffield Fdwards
on 14 May 1962 states: "No monies were ever paid to Roselli and
Giancana. Maheu was paid part of his expense money during the periods
that he was in Miami." (Giancana is "Gold.")

O'Connell was introduced (in true name ) to Roselli as an employee

‘of Maheu, the explanation being that O'Connell would handle the

case for Maheu, because Maheu was too busy to work on it full time
himself. No one else in the Office of Security was made witting of
the operation at this time. Edwards himself did not meet Roselli
wntil the summer of 1962.
At this point, about the second half of September, Shef Edwards

told Bissell that he had a friend, a private investigator, who had
a contact who in turn had other contacts through whom syndicate
elements in Cuba could be reached. These syndicate elements in
Cuba would be willing to take on such an operation. As of the latter
part of September 1960, Edwards, O'Connell, and Bissell were the only
ones in the Agency who knew of a plan against Castro involving U.S.
gangster elements. Edwards states that Richard Helms was not informed
of the plan, because Cuba was being handled by Bissell at that time.

; With Bissell present, Edwards briefed the Director (Allen Dulles)
and the DDCI (General Cabell) on the existence of a plan involving
members of the syndicate. The discussion was circumspect; Edwards

-1 =

QEUNED LILO UNLT

deliberately avoided the use of any "bad words.” The descriptive term
used was "an intelligence operation." Edwards is quite sure that the id
DCI and the DDCI clearly understood the nature of the operation he
was discussing. He recalls describing the channel as being "from A to
B toc." As he then envisioned it, "A" was Maheu, "B" was Roselli,
a "Cc" was the principal in Cuba. Edwards recalls that Mr. Dulles
merely nodded, presumably in understanding and approval. Certainly,
there was no opposition. Edwards states that, while there was no
formal approval as such, he felt that he clearly had tacit approval
to use his own judgment. Bissell committed $150,000 for the support
G of the operation.
(Conment: In the light of this description of the briefing,
it 1s appropriate to conjecture as to just what the Director did
approve. It is safe to conclude, given the men participating
and the general subject of the meeting, that there was little
likelihood of misunderstanding--even though the details were
deliberately blurred and the specific intended result was never
stated in unmistakable language. It is also reasonable to
conclude that the pointed avoidance of "bad words" emphasized

to the participants the extreme sensitivity of the operation.)

During the week of 25 September 1960, O'Connell and Maheu went to

Miami where Roselli introduced only Maheu to "Sam Gold" at a meeting

a iassstasraat : ae ana eae ‘

in the Fontainbleau Hotel. "Gold" said he had a man, whom he
identified only as "Joe," who would serve as courier to Cuba and

make arrangements there. Maheu pointed out "Gold" to O'Connell

from a distance, but O'Connell never met either "Gold" or "Joe."

He did, however, learn their true identities. An Office of Security
‘memorandum to the DDCI of 2k June 1966 places the time as "several
weeks later." O'Connell is now uncertain as to whether it was on this
first visit to Miami or on a subsequent one that he and Maheu learned
the true identities of the two men. Maheu and O'Connell were staying
at separate hotels. Maheu phoned O'Connell one Sunday morning and

called his attention to the Parade supplement in one of that morning's

Cc Miami newspapers. It carried an article on the Cosa Nostra, with

pictures of prominent members. The man Maheu and O'Connell knew as
"Sam Gold" appeared as Mom Salvatore (Sam) Giancana, a Chicago-based
gangster. "Joe, the courier” (who was never identified to either
Maheu or O'Connell in any other way) turned out to be Santos Trafficante,
the Cosa Nostra chieftain in Cuba.

At that time the gambling casinos were still operating in Cuba,
and Trafficante was making regular trips between Miami and Havana on
syndicate business. (The casinos were closed and gambling was banned
effective 7 January 1959. On 13 January 1959, Castro announced that

the casinos would be permitted to reopen for tourists and foreigners

but that Cubans would be barred. The cabinet on 17 February 1959

authorized reopening the casinos for the tourist trade. Time magazine i

for 2 March 1959 announced that the casinos had been reopened the
previous week. The New York Times issue of 30 September 1961
announced that the last of the casinos still running had been closed.)
“nrafticante was to make the arrangements with one of his contacts

inside Cuba on one of his trips to Havana.

Fall and Early Winter 1960

Very early in the operation, well before the first contact with
O Roselli, the machinery for readying the means of assassination was
set in motion. The sequence of events is not clear, but it is
apparent that a number of methods were considered. Preparation of
some materials went ahead without express approval.

(Comment: It should be noted that TSD maintains a stock
of equipment and materials for operational use. When queries are
made of TSD technicians about materials or devices that are not
stock items, it is not unusual for the technicians to go
ahead with the preparation of the materials or devices against

” the event that there is a formal request for them. Because of
this, undue significance should not be attached to advance

preparations for this operation. It should also be noted that

NW 64937 Doctd:32273908 Page 31

OLUNEI- ETC Gadd

it was not unusual at the time in question for the Chief of TSD
to be by-passed in operations involving his people. While
Cornelius Roosevelt, then Chief of TSD, has the clear impression
that all requests were levied through him, instances were cited
in the course of this inquiry where such was not the case. The
practices and procedures in existence at the time may account,

at least in part, for the differing recollections of what did and
what did not happen and for the differing degrees of significance

given developments in the minds of the participants.)

Dr. Edward Gunn, Chief, Operations Division, Office of Medical
Services, has a notation that on 16 August 1960 he received a box of
Cuban cigars to be treated with a lethal material. He understood them
to be Fidel's favorite brand, and he thinks they were given to him by
Shef Edwards. Edwards does not recall the incident. Gunn has a
notation that he contacted Ray Treichler, of TSD, on 6 September 1960.
Treichler remembers experimenting with some cigars and then treating
a full box. He cannot now recall whether he was initially given two
boxes, experimenting with one and then treating the other; or whether
he bought a box for experimentation, after which he treated the box
supplied him by Gunn. He does not, in fact, remember Gunn as the
supplier of any cigars. He is positive, though, that he did contaminate

a@ full box of fifty cigars with botulinum toxin, a virulent poison that

-21-

OLUKEI—EILO UALT

produces a fatal illness some hours after it is ingested. Treichler

distinctly remembers the flaps-and-seals job he had to do on the box

and on each of the wrapped cigars, both to get at the cigars and to
erase evidence of tampering. He kept one of the experimental cigars
and still has it. He retested it during our inquiry and found that
“the toxin still retained 94% of its original effectiveness. The
cigars were so heavily contaminated that merely putting one in the
mouth would do the job; the! intendea victim would not actually have
to smoke it.

Gunn's notes show that he reported the cigars as being ready
for delivery on 7 october 1960. Treichler's notes do not show actual

CF y
o” delivery until 13 February 1961. They do not indicate to whom

oY delivery was made. Gunn states ‘that he took the cigars, at some

LK x unspecified time, and kept them in his personal safe. He remembers
fd destroying them within a month of Shef Edwards retirement in June 1963.
Sal ; (Comment: Others recall the cigar scheme, but only as an
Ae y idea that was considered and then discarded. Roosevelt, Chief

of TSD at the time, and O'Connell, the case officer, recall the
cigar scheme, but feel that it was never considered seriously.
To Gunn and Treichler, who gave it a good deal of time but did
not participate in the broader operational discussions, the cigars

loom as important.)

Edwards recalls approaching Roosevelt after Bissell had already
spoken to Roosevelt on the subject; Roosevelt recalls speaking to
| Edwards after Bissell discussed it with Edwards. Bissell does not
recall specific conversations with either of them on the technical
} aspects of the problem, but he believes that he must have "closed the
‘loop" by talks with both Edwards and Roosevelt. Roosevelt recalls
his first meeting with Edwards as being in Edwards' office. Edwards
remembers asking to be introduced to a chemist. He is sure that he
did not name the target to Roosevelt, but Roosevelt says he knew it
was Castro. Roosevelt believes that he would have put Edwards in
C touch with Henry Bortner, then chief of TSD's Chemical Division, but
Bortner has no recollection of such work at that time. Bortner
recalls other operations at other times, but not this one. Roosevelt
did say that, if he turned it over to Bortner, Bortner could have
assigned it to Ray Treichler.
Roosevelt remembers that four possible approaches were considered:
(1) something highly toxic, such as shellfish poison to be administered
with a pin (which Roosevelt said was what was supplied to Gary Powers);
(2) bacterial material in liquid form; (3) bacterial treatment of a
cigarette or cigar; and (4) a handkerchief treated with bacteria.
The decision, to the best of his recollection, was that bacteria in

liquid form was the best means. Bissell recalls the same decision,

em seenereetecreet eee Serer cee pistes

SECRET—EYES OiLY

ee

NW 64937 Doctd:32273908 Page 34



SECRET—EYES OLY

tying it to a recollection that Castro frequently drank tea, coffee,
or bouillon, for which a liquid poison would be particularly well

suited.

January - February 1961

Despite the decision that a poison in liquid form would be most
desirable, what was actually prepared and delivered was a solid in
the form of small pills about the size of saccharine tablets. Treichler
remembers meeting with Edwards and O'Connell in Edwards' office to
discuss the requirement. ‘The specifications were that the poison be
stable, soluble, safe to handle, undetectable, not immediately acting,
‘and with a firmly predictable end result. Botulin comes nearest to
meeting all of those requirements, and it may be put up in either
liquia or solid form. Treichler states that.the pill form was
chosen because of ease and safety of handling.

(Comment: The gangsters may have had some influence on the
choice of a means of assassination. O'Connell says that in his
very early discussions with the gangsters (or, more precisely,
Maheu's discussions with them) consideration was given to possible
ways of accomplishing the mission. Apparently the Agency had first
_ thought in terms of a typical, gangland-style killing in which

Castro would be gunned down. Giancana was flatly opposed to the

OEUKEL—EIES Ui

use of firearms. He said that no one could be recruited to do
the job, because the chance of survival and escape would be
negligible. Giancana stated a preference for a lethal pill

that could be put into Castro's food or drink. Trafficante
("Joe, the courier") was in touch with a disaffected Cuban
official with access to Castro and presumably of a sort that
would enable him to surreptitiously poison Castro. The gangsters
named their man inside as Juan Orta who was then Office Chief
and Director General of the Office of the Prime Minister (Castro).
The gangsters said that Orta had once been in a position to
receive kickbacks from the gambling interests, had since lost

that source of income, and needed the money.)

When Edwards received the pills he dropped one into a glass of
water to test it for solubility and found that it did not even
disintegrate, let alone dissolve. Treichler took them back and made
up 4 new batch that met the requirement for solubility. Edwards
at that point wanted assurance that the pills were truly lethal. He
called on Dr. Gunn to make an independent test of them. Edwards gave
Gunn money to buy guinea pigs as test animals. Gunn has a record of a
conversation with Treichler on 6 February 1961. It may have related to
the tests, but we cannot be sure. What appears to have happened is that

Gunn tested the pills on the guinea pigs and found them ineffective.

SECRET—EYES ONLY

Treichler states that tests of botulin on guinea pigs are not valid,
because guinea pigs have a high resistance to this particular toxin.
Treichler himself tested the pills on monkeys and found they did the
job expected of them.

We cannot reconstruct with certainty the sequence of events

“between readying the pills and putting them into the hands of Roselli.

Edwards has the impression that he had a favorable report from Dr.
Gunn on the guinea pig test. Gunn probably reported only that the
pills were effective, and Edwards assumed the report was based on the
results of tests on guinea pigs. Dr. Gunn has a clear recollection,
without a date, of being present at a meeting in which Roosevelt
demonstrated a pencil designed as a concealment device for delivering
the pills. Roosevelt also recalls such a meeting, also without a
date. Gunns’ notes record that his last action on the operation came
on 10 February 1961 when he put Gottlieb in touch with Edwards.
Gottlieb has no recollection of being involved, an impression that is
supported by Bissell who states that Gottlieb's assignments were of a
different nature. O'Connell, who eventually received the pills,
recalls that he dealt with Treichler. Treichler has no record of
delivering pills at this time, but he does not ordinarily keep detailed

records of such things.

O

In any event, O'Connell did receive the pills, and he believes
| there were six of them. He recalls giving three to Roselli. Presumably
the other three were used in testing for solubility and effectiveness.
The dates on which O'Connell received the pills and subsequently
_Passed them to Roselli cannot be established. It would have been
“sometime after Gunn's notation of 10 February 1961.
Gunn also has a record of being approached about the undertaking
by William K. Harvey (former special agent of the FBI) in February
in connection with a sensitive project Harvey was working on for
Bissell. According to Gunn's notes, he briefed Harvey on the operation,
C and Harvey instructed him to discuss techniques, but not targets,
with Gottlieb. Gunn's notation on this point is not in accord with
the recollectiors of any of the others involved. We are umable to
clarify it; the note may have been in another context. O'Connell
' i states that J. C. King was also briefed at this time, although King

denies learning of the operation until much later.

Late February - March 1961

Roselli passed the pills to Trafficante. Roselli reported to
O'Connell that the pills had been delivered to Orta in Cuba. Orta
is understood to have kept the pills for a couple of weeks before

returning them. According to the gangsters, Orta got cold feet.

SECRET—EVES GNLY

(Comment: Orta lost his position in the Prime Minister's
Office on 26 January 1961, while planning for the operation was
still going on in Miami and in Washington. He took refuge in
the Venezuelan Embassy on 11 April 1961 and became the responsi-
bility of the Mexican Embassy when Venezuela broke relations
with Cuba in November 1961. Castro refused to give him a safe
conduct pass until October 1964 when he was allowed to leave for
Mexico City. He arrived in Miami in early February 1965.

(It appears that Edwards and O'Connell did not know at the
time of Orta's fall from favor. They have made no reference
to it--ascribing Orta's failure to cold feet. It would seem,
though, that the gangsters did know that Orta had already lost his
access to Castro. They described him as a man who had once had
a@ position that allowed him a rake-off on gambling profits, a
position that he had since lost. The only job with which we can
associate Orta that might have allowed him a rake-off was the
one he held in the Prime Minister's Office, which he lost on
26 January 1961.. It seems likely that, while the Agency thought

the gangsters had a man in Cuba with easy access to Castro, what

_they actually had was a man disgruntled at having lost access.)

The previously-mentioned 24 June 1966 summary of the operation

prepared by the Office of Security states that when Orta asked out

- B-

of the assignment he suggested another candidate who made several
attempts without success. Neither Edwards nor O'Connell know the
identity of Orta's replacement nor any additional details of the

reported further attempts.

“March - April 1962

Following the collapse of the Orta channel, Roselli told
O'Connell that Trafficante knew of a man high up in the Cuban exile
movement who might do the job. He identified him as Tony Varona
(Dr. Manuel Antonio de VARONA y Loredo). Varona was the head of the
Democratic Revolutionary Front, a group supported by the Agency as
part of the larger Cuban operation. O'Connell understood that Varona
was dissatisfied with the nature and the extent of this support and
that JMWAVE suspected that Varona was not keeping his bargain with the
Agency.

(Comment : Reports from the FBI suggest how Trafficante may
have known of Varona. On 21 December 1960 the Bureau forwarded
to the Agency a memorandum reporting that efforts were being

: made by U.S. racketeers to finance anti-Castro activities in
“hopes of securing the gambling, prostitution, and dope monopolies
in Cuba in the event Castro was overthrown. A later report of

18 January 1961 associates Varona with those schemes. Varona

- 29 -

SECRET—EYES ONLY

had hired Edward K. Moss, a Washington public relations
counselor, as a fund raiser and public relations advisor.
The Bureau report alleged that Moss' mistress was one Julia
Cellini, whose brothers represented two of the largest gambling
casinos in Cuba. The Cellini brothers were believed to be in
touch with Varona through Moss and were reported to have offered
Varona large sums of money for his operations against Castro,
with the understanding that they would receive privileged
treatment "in the Cuba of the future.” Attempts to verify these
reports were unsuccessful.

(There is a record of CIA interest in MOss, but there is
no indication that the Agency had any involvement with him
in connection with Cuba. He was granted Covert Security
Clearances in March 1959 for use by NE Division in his (then)
role as consultant to the Indian Embassy and again in November
1962 for use by CA Staff under Project ZRMAJOR, a program for
the exploitation of political consultants. In early 1965 Moss
became of interest to the House Foreign Affairs Committee because
of his record of having represented various foreign governments.
A memorandum prepared by CA Staff in March 1965 states that the
records do not show any use made of Moss by either NE Division
or by CA Staff. The CSA of 7 November 1962 specifies that the

“230 +

approval became invalid if Moss were not used within six

months of the date of the approval.)

Trafficante approached Varona and told him that he had clients
who wanted to do away with Castro and that they would pay big money
_for the job. Varona is reported to have been very receptive, since
“4+ would mean that he would be able to buy his own ships, arms, and
communications equipment.
(Comment: By this time Roselli had become certain that
O'Connell was an Agency employee, not a subordinate of Maheu.
He told O'Connell that he was sure that O'Connell was "a
CO government man - CIA" but that O'Connell should not confirm
this to him. Roselli said that as a loyal American he would

do whatever he could and would never divulge the operation.)

Roselli was to deliver money to Varona for expenses. O'Connell
now recalls the amount as $50,000. Edwards, who was away at the time,
recalls it as $25,000. Since Edwards was absent, O'Connell had to
get approval from Edwards’ deputy, Robert Bannerman, who until then

had been unwitting of the operation. O'Connell told Bannerman that

the operation was known to and approved by Edwards. Bannerman authorized
passing the money and now recalls the amount as being on the order of

$20,000 to $25,000. An Office of Security memorandum to the DDCI,

-31-

SECRET—EVES ONLY

NW 64937 Doctd:32273908 Page 42


ocbhel—trte UALY

dated 24 June 1966, sets the amount as $10,000 in cash and $1,000
worth of communications equipment. Jake Esterline, who signed the
vouchers for the funds, recalls the amounts as being those stated
in the Office of Security memorandum.

(Comment: As a sidelight, Esterline says that, when he
learned of the intended use of Varona, steps were taken to
cancel the plan. Varona was one of the five key figures in the
Revolutionary Front and was heavily involved in support of the
approaching Bay of Pigs operation. If steps were in fact taken
to end Varona's participation in the syndicate plan, they were

| C ineffective. It is clear that he continued as an integral part

of the syndicate scheme.)

When the money was ready, O'Connell took the pills from his safe
and delivered them and the money to Roselli. Roselli gave the pilis
and the money to Varona, whom Roselli dealt with under pseudonym.
Little is known of the delivery channels beyond Varona. Varona was
believed to have an asset inside Cuba in a position to slip a pill
to Castro. Edwards recalls something about a contact who worked in
a restaurant frequented by Castro and who was to receive the pills and
put them into Castro's food or drink. Edwards believes that the

scheme failed because Castro ceased to visit that particular restaurant.

April - May 1961

Soon after the Bay of Pigs, Edwards sent word to Roselli
through O'Connell that the operation was off--even if something
happened there would be no payoff. Edwards is sure there was a
“complete standdown after that; the operation was dead and remained so
until April 1962. He clearly relates the origins of the operation to
the upcoming Bay of Pigs invasion, and its termination to the Bay
of Pigs failure. O'Connell agrees that the operation was called off
after the Bay of Pigs but that the termination was not firm and final.
He believes that there was something going on between April 1961 and
O . April 1962, but he cannot now recall what. He agrees with Bill
Harvey that when the operation was revived in April 1962, Harvey took
over a "going operation.” :

(Comment: As distinguished from Edwards and O'Connell,
both Bissell and Esterline place the termination date of the
assassination operation as being about six months before the
Bay of Pigs. Esterline gives as his reason for so pelieving the
fact that the decision had been made to go ahead with a massive,

‘ major operation instead of an individually-targeted one such as
this. Whatever the intention in this respect, if the decision to

terminate was actually made, the decision was not communicated

effectively. It is clear that this plan to assassinate Castro

continued in train until sometime after the Bay of Pigs.)

O'Connell believes that he must have recovered the pills, but

he bas no specific recollection of having done so. He thinks that

- instead of returning them to TSD he probably would have destroyed

them, most likely by flushing them down a toilet. Treichler has no

record of the pills having been returned to him, but he says he is
quite sure that they were.

In a memorandum of 14 May 1962 Sheffield Edwards stated that

Gambling Syndicate - Phase 2

William Harvey, Chief of FI/D, was briefed in February 1961
(by authority of Richard Bissell) on phase one of the gambling

syndicate operation. That briefing was in connection with a sensitive

‘operation that Bissell had assigned to Harvey. Harvey describes it

thus: Early in the Kennedy administration, Bissell called him in to

discuss what Harvey refers to as an Executive Action Capability; i.e.,
@ general stand-by capability to carry out assassinations when required.
Harvey's notes quote Bissell as saying, "The White House has twice
urged me to create such a capability.” Bissell recalls discussing
the question of developing a general capability with Harvey. He
mentioned the Edwards/gambling syndicate operation against Castro
in that context, but he now thinks that the operation was over by
then and that reference to it was in terms of a past operation as a
case in point. It was on this basis that Harvey arranged to be
briefed by Edwards. Harvey's fixing of the date as February was only
after review of events both preceding the briefing and following it.
He says now that it might have eee as late January or as late
as March 1961.

After some discussion of the problems involved in developing an
Executive Action Capability, Bissell placed Harvey in charge of the

effort. Harvey says that Bissell had already discussed certain aspects

SECRET—EVES OHLY ;

NW 64937 Doctd:32273908 Page 49


SECRET—EVES ONLY

of the problem with Arnold Silver and with Sidney Gottlieb. Since
Silver was already cut in, Harvey used him in developing the

Executive Action Capability, although never with respect to Castro.

We did not question Gottlieb on his knowledge of the program for
creating an Executive Action Capability, but Harvey's mention of him
“in this connection may explain a notation by Dr. Gunn that Harvey
instructed Gunn to discuss techniques with Gottlieb without associating
the discussion with the Castro operation.

Harvey states that after the decision was made to go ahead with
the creating of an Executive Action Capability, and while he was

C still discussing its development with Bissell, he briefed Mr. Helms
fully on the general concept but without mention of the then ongoing
plan to assassinate Castro.

The Executive Action program came to be known as ZRRIFLE. Its
principal asset was an agent, QJWIN, who had been recruited earlier
by Arnold Silver for use in a special operation in the Congo ~(attes»
r@ovacsination=of-PatriceLummbe} to be run by Justin O'Donnell.
(O'Donnell made a survey of the scene, decided he wanted no part in
an assassination attempt, and asked to be released--which Bissell
granted.) The project name, ZRRIFIE, first appears in the files in
May 1961, although the first recorded approval is dated 19 February

1962. The new DD/P (Helms) on that date authorized Harvey, by

- 3-

OCLALI— LILO Gilt

memorandm, to handle the project on a special basis. Accounting for
expenditures was to be by general category and on Harvey's certifi-
cation. The initial approval was for $14,700, consisting of $7,200
for QJWIN's annual salary and $7,500 for operational expenses.

Project ZRRIFLE was covered as an FI/D operation (ostensibly

‘to develop a capability for entering safes and for kidnapping couriers).

It continued on a course separate from the Edwards/gambling syndicate
operation against Castro until 15 November 1961. Harvey has a note
that on that date he discussed with Bissell the application of the
ZRRIFIE program to Cuba. Harvey says that Bissell instructed him to
take over Edwards' contact with the criminal syndicate and thereafter
t run the operation against Castro. Harvey adds that, as a completely
unrelated development, shortly after this discussion with Bissell he
was told by Helms that he was to be placed in charge of the Agency's

Cuba task force.

Iate 1961 - Early 1962

Harvey recalls that he was very busy with a number of things in
the period that followed the discussion with Bissell that led to his
taking over Edwards' Castro operation. He was turning over his
responsibilities in ‘FI/D. He was working with NSA on the Martin/

Mitchell defection case. He was reading in on Cuba operations and

-39-

was engaged in daily meetings concerning them. He attended a station

chiefs' conference in Panama in late January and early February.

February - March 1962

Harvey recalls a first meeting with Edwards in February 1962
a on the subject of the Castro operation. He also recalls working
out the details of the takeover during March.
(Comment: After Harvey took over the Castro operation he
ran it as one aspect of ZRRIFLE; however, he personally handled
the Castro operation and did not use any of the assets being

developed in ZRRIFLE. He says that he soon came to think of the

C Castro operation and ZRRIFLE as being synonymous. The over-all

Executive Action program came to be treated in his mind as being
synonymous with QJWIN, the agent working on the over-all program.
He says that when he wrote of ZRRIFLE/QJWIN the reference was to
Executive Action Capability; when he used the cryptonym ZRRIFLE
alone, he was referring to Castro. He said that his correspondence
would disclose this distinction. We reviewed the correspondence
+ and found it for the most part unrevealing.
(After Harvey left Task Force W and was winding up his

headquarters responsibilities in preparation for assignment to

Rome, he wrote a memorandum to the Chief, FI Staff, dated 27 June

1963, stating that the original justification for employing
QJWIN no longer existed and raising the question of QJWIN's
termination. The records (OLLA-1974, 24 April 1964) show that
QIWIN was terminated by the Luxembourg Station on 21 April
1964. There is no indication in the file that the Executive

Action Capability of ZRRIFLE/QJWIN was ever used.)

April 1962

Edwards recalls Harvey contacting him in April and asking to be
put in touch with Roselli. Edwards says that he verified Helms'

C approval and then made the arrangements. Harvey states that he briefed
Helms before his first meeting with Roselli, explaining its purpose,
and that he also reported to Helms the results of his meeting with
Roselli. Harvey states that thereafter he regularly briefed Helms
on the status of the Castro operation.

(Comment: Edwards statement that he "verified Helms‘
approval" is the earliest indication we have that Mr. Helms had
been made witting of the gambling syndicate operation against
Castro. Harvey added that, when he briefed Helms on Roselli,

“he obtained Helms' approval not to brief the Director.)

Edwards, Harvey, and O'Connell have differing recollections. of

the specifics of the turnover from Edwards/O'Connell to Harvey. Not

all of the differences can be resolved--not even by follow-up
interviews in which the information furnished by each was checked
with each of the other two. There is no disagreement on the fact
of the turnover nor on when it took place. The recollections vary
decidedly, though, on the status of the operation at the time of its
vtransfer to Harvey and on just how clean the break was between phase
one under Edwards and phase two under Harvey.

a. Edwards believes that the operation was called off
completely after the Bay of Pigs and that there was no further
operational activity in connection with it until Harvey met

Cc : Roselli and reactivated the operation in April 1962. O'Connell
introduced Harvey to Roselli » €nd Edwards had nothing further to
do with the operation--with the exception of a meeting with
Attorney General Robert Kennedy in connection with the Phyllis
McGuire wiretapping incident. (The wiretapping incident is
described in a separate section of this report.) Edwards'
records show that on 1k May 1962 Harvey called Edwards “and
indicated that he was dropping any plans for the use of
Roselli for the future."

b. Harvey's recollection of the turnover tends to support
Edwards! summary, but he claims that he took over "a going

operation.” Some Support for this claim is found in his description

-~4o.

he

of just how it was planned to get the poison into Castro's food
by employing someone with access to a restaurant frequented by
Castro. The mechanics were identical with those described by
Edwards and as reported in our earlier account of phase one of
the operation.
e. O'Connell's account of his own role in the operation
in the early weeks following Harvey's supposed takeover makes it
evident that there was not a clean break between the Office of
Security's responsibility and that of Harvey. Further, O'Connell
now believes that there must have been "something going on"
between April 1961 (after the Bay of Pigs) and April 1962, but
he claims to be unable to remember any of the particulars.
There are other disagreements among the three on facts. They are
reviewed here, not because they alter the essential fact of the
turnover or of Harvey's sole responsibility for the operation after
a certain point in time, but because they suggest that persons who
were supposedly unwitting of events after the turnover were in fact
witting, because they were not effectively cut off at the instant of
turnover.

Harvey's notes show that he and O'Connell went to New York City
to meet Roselli on the 8th and 9th of April 1962. O'Connell recalls

it as being early in April and that the introduction was made on a

~ 43 -

Sunday, which would make it the 8th. Harvey says that only he and
O'Connell met with Roselli; O'Connell says that Maheu was also
present at the meeting. Both are positive of the accuracy of their
recollections, and each gives reasons for his confidence in his
.Clarity of recall. ‘The significance, for purposes of this inquiry,
‘ts whether Maheu did or did not know that the operation continued
under Harvey.

a. Harvey is certain that he would have remembered it if
Maheu were present. He and Maheu were in the same FBI training
class at Quantico in 1940. He does not remember having seen

(O; Maheu since he, Harvey, came with the Agency in 1947, although he
acknowledges that he may have seen him once or twice socially.
He is sure he has not seen Maheu since 1952 when Harvey was
assigned to Berlin.

b. O'Connell who set up the meeting, is just as positive
that Maheu was there. He describes a series of events that
reassure him of the accuracy of his memory. The four of them
traveled separately to New York. They net at the Savoy Plaza

; Hotel (Savoy Hilton?) where all four stayed. After discussions,
“Maheu suggested dinner at the Elk Room, a fashionable restaurant
in @ nearby hotel. O'Connell says that Maheu picked up the tab.

They finished dinner about 9:30 or 10:00 p.m. Roselli wanted to

buy the group a nightcap, but since it was Sunday night nearly
all of the bars were closed. They walked around the neighbor-
hood looking for an open bar and finally wound up at the
Copacabana. They were refused admittance to the bar because of
a rule restricting admission to couples, so they sat at a table
where they could watch the floor show. Roselli found himself
facing a table at “ringside” at which Phyllis McGuire was sitting
with Dorothy Kilgallen and Liberace for the opening night of
singer Rosemary Clooney. To avoid Phyllis McGuire's seeing him,
Roselli got his companions to change their seating arrangement
@) so that his back was turned to Miss McGuire. Maheu was an
integral part of all this. (Roselli's reason for not wanting
Phyllis McGuire to see him with his companions will became
evident from her role in the wiretapping incident, which is
described in a separate section of this report.)
The two differing recollections cannot be reconciled. As a point of
interest, Edwards stated that when he briefed Harvey on the operation
he deliberately omitted reference to Maheu in order to screen Maheu
off from Harvey's takeover of the operation.
“the next significant point of difference has to do with what
happened after the New York meeting. O'Connell told us that he and

Roselli left New York for Miami the next day (presumably 10 April)

and remained there until Harvey arrived. Harvey, on the other hand,
recalls a meeting with O'Connell and Roselli in Washington on 1) April.
O'Connell, at first, did not recall the Washington meeting, but,
when given Harvey's chronology, he said he did recall returning to
_Washington to meet Harvey for some purpose but that the details are
‘vague in his mind. Harvey at first thought that the 14 April meeting
in Washington was O'Connell's last contact with Roselli during this
second phase of the gambling syndicate operation. O'Connell told us
that Roselli was apprehensive over the new arrangement (and of Harvey
personally) and asked O'Connell to remain on for a time, which O'Connell
C agreed to do. When told that O'Connell was sure that he had continued
on in the operation for some two or three weeks after Harvey's take-
over, Harvey agreed that this was correct. O'Connell's carryover was
for purposes of continuity. We cannot be sure of the date O'Connell
was finally eliminated from the operation. He was in Miami with
Roselli and Harvey perhaps as late as 27 April. His role in the
operation had definitely ended by June 1962 when he was assigned PCS
to Okinawa.
Harvey recalls leaving Washington for Miami by automobile on
19 April. He thought that he took delivery of the pills from Dr. Gunn
before leaving. Gunn has no record of any such deliveryat that time;

his last record concerning pills is dated February 1961. Ray Treichler

does have a notation of delivering four pills (one capsule and three
tablets) to "J.0." on 18 April 1962. Treichler reads this as being
Jim O'Connell. When told of this, Harvey agreed that it was probably

correct. O'Connell also feels that he must have been in Washington

for the pill delivery.

Harvey says that he arrived in Miami on 21 April 1962 and found
Roselli already in touch with Tony Varona, the Cuban exile leader who
had participated in phase one. It is at this point that the final
difference in recollections occurs. Harvey described the manner in
which the lethal material was to be introduced into Castro's food,
involving an asset of Varona's who had access to someone in a
restaurant frequented by Castro. We told Harvey that Edwards had
described precisely the same plan. When we asked Harvey how Edwards
could have known of the mechanics if there had been no activity in the
operation for a year, and if Harvey was starting again from scratch,

Harvey replied that he took over a going operation--one that was

. already "in train." Edwards denies that this is so. O'Connell says

that Harvey is the one who is right. The operation was going on when
Harvey took it over, although O'Connell does not remember when Varona
was reactivated or what had been done with him in the meantime.
Along with the change in Agency leadership of the operation,
which saw Harvey replacing Edwards/O'Connell, there also were changes

-4h7 -

SECRET-EVES ONLY

NW 64937 Doctld:32273908 Page 59


SECRET—EVES ONLY

in the original cast of hoodlum players. Harvey specified that
Giancana was not to be brought in on the reactivation of the operation,
and he believes that Roselli honored the request. Roselli once
reported to Harvey that Giancana had asked if anything was going on,
and when Roselli said that nothing was happening, Giancana said,

“oo bad." Additionally, Santos Trafficante ("Joe, the courier" from
the earlier phase) was no longer involved. With the closing of the
last casino in Havana in September 1961, Trafficante presumably no
longer had access. Roselli now had a man known to Harvey as Maceo,
who also used the names Garcia-Gomez and Godoy.

(o) (Comment : Harvey is unable further to identify Maceo; he
describes him as “a Cuban who spoke Italian.” One of Varona's
associates in the Cuban exile community was named Antonio MACEO :
Mackle, but it seems unlikely that he was the Maceo of this
operation. He was prominent enough in the exile community to
have been known to Harvey. Further, it seems clear that Maceo
was "Roselli's man." This second phase appears to lack the
overwhelming, high-level gangster flavor that characterized the
first phase. Roselli remained as a prominent figure in the

: operation, but working directly with the Cuban exile community
and directly on behalf of CIA. Roselli was essential to the

second phase as a contact with Varona, who presumably still

SECRET—EVES ONLY

believed he was being supported by U.S. businesenen with

financial stakes in Cuba. Roselli needed Giancana and Trafficante
in the first phase as a means of establishing contacts inside Cuba.
He did not need them in the second phase, because he had Varona.
However, it would be naive to assume that Roselli did not take

the precaution of informing higher-ups in the syndicate that he
was working in a territory considered to be the private domain

of someone else in the syndicate.)

When the pills were given to Varona through Roselli, Varona

requested arms and equipment needed for the support of his end of the
6) operation. Roselli passed the request to Harvey. Harvey, with the

help of Ted Shackley, the chief of the JMWAVE Station, procured
explosives, detonators, twenty .30 caliber rifles, twenty .45 caliber
hand guns, two radios, and one boat radar. Harvey says that the
“shopping list" included some items that could be obtained only from
the U.S. Government. Harvey omitted those items, because Roselli,
posing as a representative of private business interests, would not
have had access to such equipment. The cost of the arms and equipment,
about $5,000, was T/A'd to headquarters.

Harvey and Shackley rented a U-Haul truck under an assumed name,
loaded it with the arms and equipment, and parked it in the parking lot

of a drive-in restaurant. The keys were then given to Roselli for
ae 4g -

delivery elther to Macéo, to Varona, or to Varona's son-in-law.
Evidently Harvey and Roselli had not yet come to trust each other.
Perhaps fearing a double-cross, each set about independently to
assure himself that the equipment reached the proper hands. After
parking the truck, Harvey and Shackley kept the parking lot under
‘surveillance until the pass was completed. Roselli, accompanied by
O'Connell, did the same. Neither pair kmew that the other was
watching. Eventually the truck was picked up and driven away. It
was returned later, empty, and with the keys under the seat as
prearranged. Harvey returned it to the rental agency. Harvey says
that Shackley never knew to whom delivery was made nor for what
purpose. Shackley was merely called upon to furnish support for a

headquarters operation from which he was otherwise excluded.

May 1962

Harvey and Roselli arranged a system of telephone communication
‘by which Harvey was kept posted on any developments. Harvey, using a
pay phone, could call Roselli at the Friars Club in Los Angeles at 1600
hours, Los Angeles time. Roselli could phone Harvey at Harvey's home
in the evening. Roselli reported that the pills were in Cuba and at

the restaurant reportedly used regularly by Castro.

June_1962

Roselli reported to Harvey on 21 June that Varona had dispatched
a@ team of three men to Cuba. Just what they were supposed to do is

pretty vague. Harvey said that they appeared to have no specific

-plan for killing Castro. They were to recruit others who might be

used in such a scheme. If an opportunity to kill Castro presented

itself, they or the persons they recruited were to make the attempt--

perhaps using the pills. Harvey never learned their names or anything
else about them. From the sequence of the reports, it would seem that
the pills were sent in ahead of the three-man team, but this is not now

ascertainable.

September 1962

Harvey saw Roselli in Miami on 7 and on 11 September. Varona
was reported as then ready to send in another team of three men. They
were supposedly militia men whose assignment was to penetrate Castro's
body guard. During this period the "medicine" was reported as still

in place and the three men of the first team safe.

September 1962 - January 1963

they did not actually leave. First, “conditions inside" were given
as the reason for delay; then the October missile crisis threw plans
awry. Harvey was in Miami between 22 December and 6 January. He saw
both Roselli and Maceo several times during that period. He made a
payment of $2,700 to Roselli for passing to Varona for the expenses of
“the three militia men. Harvey and Roselli had telephone discussions
of the operation between 11 and 16 January. Harvey says that Roselli
wasn't kidding himself. He agreed with Harvey that nothing was
happening and that there was not much chance that anything would
happen in the future. As far as Harvey knows, the three militia

men never did leave for Cuba. He knows nothing of what may have

happened to the three reported to have been sent to Cuba.

February 1963

Harvey was in Miami 11-14 February. He had no contacts with any
of the principals, but he left word for Maceo that there was nothing
new and that it now looked as if it were all over. (Just how Harvey
left this word for Maceo is not clear.)

Harvey left Miami on 15 February to meet with Roselli in Los
Angeles. They agreed at the Los Angeles meeting that the operation
would be closed off, but that it would be unwise to attempt a precipitate

break between Roselli and Varona. Roselli agreed that he would continue

to see Varona, gradually reducing the frequency of contact until there

was none.

April - May 1963

Harvey says that he received two telephone calls from Roselli
‘during this period. Harvey decided that it would be best to have one
last meeting with Roselli before he left for his assignment in Rome.
He states that he reported this decision to Mr. Helms who gave his

approval.
June 1963

Roselli came to Washington to meet with Harvey sometime about the
middle of June. Harvey met him at Dulles airport. Harvey remembers
having suggested to Roselli that he bring only carry-on luggage so
there would be no delay at the airport awaiting baggage. Harvey had by
then closed his own home in preparation for leaving the country and
was living in the house of a neighbor who was out of town. Roselli
stayed with Harvey as a houseguest in the neighbor's home. That
evening Roselli, Harvey, and Mrs. Harvey went out for dinner. While
dining, Harvey received a phone call from Sam Papich who wanted to know

if Harvey knew the identity of his dinner guest. Harvey said that he did.

Giancana was supposedly cut out of the second phase, but we cannot

suspiciously like this second phase of the operation. If that is so,
then it is likely that the operation has leaked--perhaps through

these channels:

Roselli to Maheu : '
Maheu to Edward P. Morgan, Maheu's Washington lawyer

Morgan to Drew Pearson

Pearson to Chief Justice Warren and to the President
Warren to Rowley, chief of the Secret Service
Rowley to Pat Coyne and to the FBI

The FBI to Attorney General Clark

We have a more detailed treatment in a separate section of this report

of the channels through which the story may have passed.

SEGRET—EVES GLY

The Wiretapping Incident

late 1961 - Early 1962

Well after the Pre-Bay of Pigs phase of the gambling syndicate

opération to assassinate Castro, and only indirectly related to it,

‘a development in the private life of Sam Giancana led to an incident

that made the FBI aware of the Agency's relationship with the syndicate
and required the briefing of the Attorney General on the details
of the assassination plan.

Phyllis McGuire, of the singing McGuire sisters, was and is
openly known to be Giancana's mistress. Giancana suspected her of
having an affair with Dan Rowan, of the Rowan and Martin comedy team.
Both Rowan and Miss McGuire were then entertaining in Las Vegas, and
Giancana asked Maheu to put a bug in Rowan's room. Maheu did not want
to do the job and declined on the grounds that he wasn't equipped for
that sort of work. Giancana made a claim for a return favor: he
had worked on the Castro assassination operation for Maheu, and
Maheu was indebted to him. Giancana said that if Maheu wouldn't
take on the job, ‘he, ‘Glancana, would go to Las Vegas and do it
himself. Maheu agreed to arrange to have the room bugged.

(Comment: The exact date of this is uncertain. An August

1963 item on Giancana in the Chicago Sun-Times refers to the

incident, without mention of wiretapping, and sets the year as

1961. ‘There is nothing in Agency files that pinpoints the date,
and the memories of those we interviewed who know of the incident
are hazy. Edwards and O'Connell did not learn of the incident
until after it had happened. Edwards can place it only as being
after the Bay of Pigs. O'Connell at first thought that it was
in early 1962. When shown the newspaper account, O'Connell said
that if the news story was correct, it would have had to have been
very late in 1961. An Office of Security memorandum to the DDCI,
of 24 June 1966, states that it was "at the height of the project
negotiations." This is confusing, rather than clarifying, because
c the operation was supposedly at dead standstill in late 1961
and very early 1962. Clearly the incident occurred before 7
February 1962, because it was on that date that the Director of
Security told the FBI that CIA would object to prosecution.

Presumably the FBI's case was already complete by then.)

Maheu arranged to have Giancana's request handled by Edward L.
Du Bois, a private investigator in Miami. Du Bois assigned two men
to the job: Arthur J. Balletti and J. W. Harrison.
(Comment: The September 1966 classified telephone directory
for the Greater Miami Area lists Edward L. Du Bois under
“Detective Agencies." There is an advertisement on the page

evidence. )
O'Connell recalis that, instead of Planting a microphone in Rowan's
room, the investigator tapped the telephone, which would not have
revealed the sort of intimacies that Giancana expected to discover.
When Rowan left the room to do a show, Balletti also left his room
to see the act, leaving his equipment out in full sight and running.
It was found by a maid, and the local sheriff's office was called.
Balletti was arrested. Harrison was not Picked up. Agency personnel
have no further information about Harrison. The FBI identified him
only as being "supplied by Maheu."

Balletti first tried to telephone Du Bois for help but could
not reach him. He then called Maheu, in the presence of the sheriff's
officers. O'Connell Says that Maheu was able to fix the matter with
local Las Vegas authorities, perhaps with help from Roselli. However,
Balletti's call to Maheu caused the case to reach the FaI. The
Bureau decided to Press for prosecution under the wiretapping statute.
When Maheu was approached by the FBI, he referred then to the CIA
Director of Security, Sheffiela Edwards.

(Comment: Edwards states that he had tola Maheu, who had
to work closely with the thugs, that if he got into a bind with

the FBI, he could tell the Bureau that he was working on an

intelligence operation being handled by Edwards. Maheu,

according to Edwards, told the Bureau that he had not personally
done the wiretapping, but that it grew out of an operation he was
working on with Edwards. Maheu presumably did not mention the
ultimate objective of the “intelligence operation” involving the
gambling syndicate. The Bureau, in a memorandum from J. Edgar
Hoover to the DCI, dated 23 March 1962, stated that: "Maheu claimed
that he ordered coverage of Rowan in behalf of CIA's efforts to
obtain intelligence information in Cuba through the hoodlum
element, including Sam Giancana, which had interests there. Maheu
said he was put in contact with Giancana in connection with these
intelligence activities through John Roselli, a Los Angeles
hoodlum. Maheu authorized wiring of Rowan's room and discussed

this matter with John Roselli.")
March 1962

The 23 March memorandum from the Bureau takes the form of a
letter of confirmation of a 7 February meeting between an unnamed
representative of the FBI and Shef Edwards. The memorandum quotes
Edwards as having made the following points: Maheu was involved in a
sensitive operation with the Agency; the Agency would object to any

prosecution that would necessitate use of CIA personnel or information;

and introduction of evidence concerning CIA operations tone embarrass
the Government. This is also essentially as stated to us by Edwards
in reviewing the incident during the course of this investigation.

The 23 March memorandum stated that the Criminal Division of the
Department of Justice requested that CIA advise specifically if it
‘objectea to initiation of criminal prosecution against Balletti,
Maheu, and Harrison. On 28 or 29 March, Edwards met with the Bureau
liaison officer, Sam Papich, and told him that any prosecution would
endanger sensitive sources and methods used in a duly authorized
project and would not be in the national interest. Papich accepted
Edwards' oral statement as the reply requested and said that he would
report to proper authorities in the Bureau. Edwards made a record
of the meeting in a memorandum of 4 April 1962.

Edwards informed us during our inquiry that at the time of the
bugging incident and the flap that ensued those (Dulles and Bissell)
who had given the initial approval of the plan to assassinate Castro
through the gambling syndicate were gone. As no one else in authority
(including Mr. Helms) had been cut in on the operation, Edwards dealt

with Papich without reference to anyone else in the Agency.

April 1962

In early April Papich informed Edwards that Herbert J. Miller,

~ 61 -

SECRET-EVES OLY

NW 64937 Doctd:32273908 Page 74


SECRET—EE=3 GLY

Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Criminal Division of the
Department of Justice, wanted to discuss the case. Edwards then
brought in Lawrence Houston, General Coumsel, and asked Houston to
call on Miller and tell him that the bugging incident in Las Vegas

was related to an intelligence operation and that the Agency did not

‘think it wise at that time to surface its connection with Roselli.

Houston met with Miller on 16 April and told him of the Agency's
involvement, without revealing any details of the assassination
operation. Houston's memorandum of the meeting, dated 26 April, quotes
Miller as saying that he foresaw no major difficulty in stopping
prosecution, but that he might mention the problem to the Attorney
General. Houston's cmoreaan notes that Miller raised a question
about the possibility of our involvement in this particular case,
the Las Vegas wiretap, standing in the way of prosecution of other
actions, particularly against Giancana.

Houston's 26 April memorandum states that on 20 April there was a
second meeting with Justice--with Miller's first assistant, Mr. Foley.
At that meeting Houston told Foley that the Agency's request not to
prosecute was limitea to this specific bugging incident, was based on
security grounds, and that security considerations would not be a bar
to prosecution on other matters. As it was possible that the Attorney

General might be told about this and might then call the DCI, Houston

NW 64937 Docld:32273908 Page 75


SECRET—EVES GLY

briefed the DDCI, General Carter, who said he understood the situation
and in due time might brief the Director, Mr. McCone. It is not known
whether General Carter did or did not brief Mr. McCone. There is no

indication that General Carter was further briefed on the full details

of the assassination plot against Castro.

May 1962

The Attorney General obviously was told of CIA's operational
involvement with gangster elements » because he requested a briefing
on the details. On 7 May 1962 Sheffield Edwards and Lawrence Houston
met with Attorney General Robert Kennedy and, as Edwards puts it,
"briefed him all the wey.” Houston says that after the briefing
Kennedy "thought about the problem quite seriously." . The Attorney
General said that he could see the problem and that he could not proceed
against those involved in the wiretapping case. He spoke quite
firmly, saying in effect, "I trust that if you ever try to do business
with organized crime again--with gangsters--you will let the Attorney
General know before you do it.” Houston quotes Edwards as replying that
this was a reasonable request. Edwards Says that among the points
covered was that of Roselli's motivation. The Attorney General had
thought that Roselli was doing the job (the attempt at assassination

of Castro) for money. Edwards corrected that impression; he was not.

Houston recalls that during the meeting with the Attorney
General the latter asked for a memorandum record of the meeting.
Edwards believes that the request was made later and by telephone.

A memorandum was prepared and was signed by Edwards. Both Edwards and

_Houston recall having had a hand in writing it. A transmittal buck-

‘slip from Houston to Kennedy notes that the request was made on
11 May, which suggests that Edwards is correct in his belief that the
request was made by telephone after the 7 May briefing of the Attorney
General. The memorandum is dated 14 May 1962. It was typed in two
eopies only, with the original being sent to Attorney General Kennedy
and the other copy being retained by the Director of Security. It was
typed by Edwards' secretary, Sarah Hall. It does not state the
purpose of the operation on which Kennedy was briefed, but it does
make it clear that the operation was against Castro and its true
purpose may be inferred from the memorandum.

Edwards states that the briefing of the Attorney General and
the forwarding of a memorandum of record was carried out without
briefing the Director (John McCone), the DDCI (General Carter), or the
DD/P (Richard Helms). He felt that, since they had not been privy to
the operation when it was under way, they should be protected from
involvement in it after the fact. As noted Previously, Houston had

briefed the DDCI on the fact that there was a matter involving the
- 63 -

Department of Justice, but Houston had not given the DDCI the specifics.
He feels it would have been normal for him to have briefed the DCI

in view of the Attorney General's interest, but he also feels quite
sure that, na have remembered doing it and he does not. He

suggested that Edwards' deliberate avoidance of such briefings may

‘have led him also to avoid making any briefings. He recalls no
disagreements with Edwards on this point and concludes that he must
have accepted Edwards' decision not to brief.

Houston and Edwards briefed Robert Kennedy on a CIA operation
embracing gangster elements, which presumably was terminated following
the Bay of Pigs fiasco. Kennedy stated his view, reportedly quite
strongly, that the Attorney General should be told in advance of any
future CIA intentions to work with or through U.S. gangster elements.
From reports of the briefing, it is reasonable to assume that Kennedy
believed he had such a commitment from Agency representatives.

In fact, however, at the time of the 7 May 1962 briefing of the
Attorney General on "Gambling Syndicate - Phase One," Phase Two under
William Harvey was already well under way. Harvey had been introduced
to Roselli on 8 April and Varona or his men had received the lethal
pills, the arms, and related support equipment in late April. The
Attorney General was not told that the gambling syndicate operation

had already been reactivated, nor, as far as we know, was he ever told

- Oe

NW 64937 Doctd:32273908 Page 78


SECRET—E¥ES G:iLY

that CIA had a continuing involvement with U.S. gangster elements.

When the Attorney General was briefed on 7 May, Edwards knew
that Harvey had been introduced to Roselli. He must also have known
that his subordinate, James O'Connell, was in Miami and roughly for
what purpose (although Edwards does not now recall this). The
gambling syndicate operation had been taken from him, and, in
retrospect, he probably acted properly in briefing the Attorney General
on only that aspect of the operation for which he had been responsible
and of which he had direct, personal knowledge.

Harvey states that on 14 May he briefed Mr. Helms on the meeting

C with the Attorney General, as told to him by Edwards. Harvey, too,

advised against briefing Mr. McCone and General Carter and states
that Helms concurred in this. On that same date, 1h May, Edwards
prepared a memorandum for the record stating that on that day Harvey
had told him that any plans for future use of Roselli were dropped.
Edwards' memorandum states that he "cautioned him (Harvey) that I
(Edwards ) felt that any future projects. of this nature should have the
tacit approval of the Director of Central Intelligence." Edwards
informed us that he has no specific recollection of having told
Harvey of Kennedy's warning that the Attorney General should be told

in advance of any future CIA use of gangsters.

Although the Attorney General on 7 May 1962 was given a full and
frank account of the Agency's relations with Maheu, Roselli, and
Giancana in the Castro operation, including the wiretapping flap,
it appears that the FBI was not given anything like the same detail.
The Bureau quite properly was not told about the assassination
‘operation, and it seems that it also was not told how the private
life of Giancana came to involve the Agency in the Las Vegas wire-
tapping incident. Edwards states that to have briefed the Bureau on
the assassination operation would have put it in an impossible bind,
since both Roselli and Giancana were high on the Bureau's "list."

The briefing of Attorney General Kennedy was absolutely restricted
to him, and we can only speculate that the confidence was observed.

(Comment: Senator Robert Kennedy's secretary, who was

also his secretary when he was Attorney General, phoned the

Director's office on 4 March 1967 and asked for a copy of the

Edwards' memorandum on the 7 May 1962 meeting with Kennedy when

he was Attorney General, at which time he was briefed on the

Castro assassination operation. Kennedy knew of the Drew Pearson

article of 7 March 1967 and wanted to check his recollection of

: what he had been told by Edwards and Houston on 7 May 1962. The

Attorney General's copy of the memorandum for the record of that

briefing is in the archives of the Attorney General's office.

Mr. Helms subsequently had lunch with Senator Kennedy. He took a

e665 (2

copy of the memorandum with him and allowed Kennedy to read it.
He did not leave a copy with Kennedy.)
If the information given the Bureau is as limited as the records

and our information indicate, then the Bureau has not been informed,

as the Attorney General was, that the Agency was first unwitting and

‘then a reluctant accessory after the fact. It would be surprising,

though, if the Bureau does not now know the whole story of the Las
Vegas bugging incident. Whether the Bureau may now think that CIA was
less than candid about the bugging incident (as distinguished from the

sensitive assassination operation) is a question for speculation.

August 1963

What is available to the press is undoubtedly available to the
Bureau. In fact, some indication of the extent of the Bureau's
knowledge is found in a feature story in the Chicago Sun-Times of
16 August 1963, with a Washington date line, under the banner lead;

"CIA SOUGHT GIANCANA HELP FOR CUBA SPYING"

The article cites "Justice Department sources’as expressing the belief
that Giancana never did any spying at all for the CIA. He merely
pretended to go along with the CIA:

"in the hope that the Justice Department's drive to put him

behind bars might be slowed - or at least affected - by his

ruse of co-operation with another government agency."
The story places the period of the relationship from 1959 to:

- 67 -

SECRET-UVES OLY

~ SEGRET-EVES GiLY

"some time in 1960, long before the abortive rebel
invasion at the Bay of Pigs in April, 1961."

The newspaper then gives the following version of the bugging incident:

"An equally bizarre episode months later. gave the
Justice Department its first clue to Giancana's
negotiations with the CIA.

"The figures in this incident were a male night-
club entertainer and Giancana's girl friend,
Phyllis McGuire, one of the singing McGuire
sisters.

"At the time, in Giancana's opinion, the entertainer
was overly attentive to Miss McGuire.

"At Las Vegas, Nev., in 1961, sheriff's police
seized a prowler in the entertainer's hotel suite.
For hours, the intruder refused to identify himself
or say he was rifling the entertainer's rooms.

"Persistent questioning by sheriff's deputies,
according to federal authorities, led to an
admission by the prowler that he was on the
payroll of a private detective agency in Florida.

"Florida authorities sought an explanation of the
incident from the operator of the detective agency.
At first, the operator refused to discuss the
matter. Finally, however, he told investigators
to get in touch with the CIA.

"The inquiry then shifted from Florida to Washington
and revealed Giancana's negotiations with CIA,
it was disclosed.

"Government sources reported Thursday that the
private investigator's mission in the Las Vegas
suite of the entertainer was another riddle of the
Giancana caper with the CIA. Neither CIA nor the
Florida detective Agency ever has offered an
explanation of what the investigator was doing in
the Hotel suite, the sources said."

Four days later, on 20 August 1963, the Chicago Daily News

reported further on the subject under the following headline:
"THE TRUTH ABOUT COSA NOSTRA CHIEF AND THE CIA"
The story cited an incident in which Giancana literally bumped into
on FBI agent who was tailing him. Giancana was reported to have said,
"“Why don't you fellows leave me alone? I'm one of you!" Giancana
is represented in the newspaper account as having been approached by--
but not as having made any arrangements with--CIA. The story also
mentions the Las Vegas incident, but in terms of someone, possibly
CIA, ransacking a room occupied by one of Giancana's henchmen who
Cc had just returned from Cuba.

On 16 August 1963 the DD/P (Helms) sent a memorandum to the
DCI (McCone) forwarding a copy of the 14 May 1962 memorandum for the
record sent to Attorney General Kennedy following the 7 May 1962
briefing of Kennedy on the gambling syndicate operation - phase one.
The coincidence of dates strongly suggests that the Director's
“interest resulted from the Chicago newspaper story of 16 August.
In his transmittal memorandum to the DCI, Mr. Helms wrote that:

" . . . Iwas vaguely aware of the existence of such

a memorandun [the memorandum for the record of the 7 May 1962
briefing of Robert Kennedy] since I was informed that it had
been written as a result of a briefing given by Colonel
Edwards and Lawrence Houston to the Attorney General in

May of last year. .... . I assume you are aware of the

This is the earliest date on which we have evidence of Mr. McCone's
being aware of any aspect of the scheme to assassinate Castro using
members of the gambling syndicate.

Drew Pearson has access to these newspaper stories, and they
are available to any number of sources who might wish to collect
‘such information. The rumors of CIA's alliance with gangsters are
not new; what is new is that the rumors now connect CIA and the
gangsters in a plot to assassinate Castro. It may be assumed that
the Attorney General (Clark) knows that the rumors of the relation-
ship, as such, are true because of the records of the FBI on the Las
Vegas wiretapping incident. As of this writing, he does not
necessarily know more--subject to what he may have learned as a
result of the FBI interview of Edward P. Morgan, Maheu's Washington
attorney. A clue as to how much the Attorney General may know is
found in his statement that Maheu is the closest thing to a link

between CIA and Giancana. .

May - July 1966
The Long Committee

The Agency's previous interventions on Maheu's behalf are

-Yeviewed here, because of the increasingly important role of Maheu

‘in the scenario. The last of these interventions occurred during
the period May - June 1966. At that time a Senate Committee headed
by Senator Long of Missouri was investigating invasions of privacy
and planned to call Maheu to testify. We learned indirectly of the
Committee's intention to call him. A man who was employed by Maheu
in 1954-55 was informed that he would be called to testify about his
activities during that period. He was an employee of AID in 1966.
The Internal Security Division of the Department of Justice learned
that he was to be called as a witness and informed CIA's General
Counsel. i

In the 1954-55 time period Maheu was hired by the Greek shipping
magnate, Niarchos, to help in a financial tussle Niarchos was having
with another Greek shipping figure, Onassis, who had managed to
negotiate a pact with King Saud under which Onassis would control
90% of all Saudi Arabian oil shipments. British, American, and German
shipping interests opposed Onassis' near monopoly, and the US and UK

governments supported Niarchos in his fight to have the agreement

cancelled. Maheu is believed to have worked at top levels in both
the British and American governments, reportedly meeting at least once
with Vice President Nixon. Maheu's operations were financed by

Niarchos, but CIA became involved in supporting them by request of

the Department of State. Agency communications and pouch facilities

‘were made available to Maheu, and he was given help in developing
a black propaganda campaign against Onassis. WNiarchos, with Maheu's
help, won his scrap with Onassis.

A variety of litigation arose fram the contest. In one law suit
for libel before the New York Supreme Court in early 1956 (Onassis vs.

Catapodis), Niarchos was examined by attorneys for Catapodis. When

ood

questions were asked about certain affidavits in issue (which had been
passed through the CIA pouch system), Niarchos, as a witness, was
advised by his attorneys not to testify on the grounds of Government
privilege. CIA inevitably became involved. The General Counsel
prepared a statement for the U.S. District Attorney in New York
(to be retained by the 00/C office there) stating the Agency's interest.
As a consequence, CIA was identified as being a party to the Niarchos/
Onassis squabble. Although that was in 1956, the Agency's inter-
vention is presumably still a matter of record.

The Long Committee planned to resurrect the old Onassis/Niarchos

fight, because it had involved an invasion of privacy. Apparently

Gere tte ‘ ‘

SECRET-EVES GuiLY

NW 64937 Doctd:32273908 Page 86


one of the things Maheu did was to hire someone to run a technical
surveillance on Onassis' offices, and this became known. Maheu's
more recent involvement in the Las Vegas wiretapping incident also
seemed certain to receive extensive attention by the Long Committee.

The Long Committee presumably would have been interested only in
Maheu's connection with the wiretappings that grew out of the Onassis/
Niarchos affair and the gambling syndicate operation against Castro.
The Agency decided that it would not be in its interest to allow
Maheu to testify on the bugging incidents because of the risk that
his testimony could not be confined just to wiretapping. Further,

C Maheu has been used over the years in a number of sensitive CIA
operations. There was a risk that a general inquiry might open up
other sensitive issues. “A number of meetings were held with
Edward P. Morgan, Maheu's Washington attorney, and with a close legal
associate of Senator Long, a St. Louis attorney named Morris Shenker.
Finally, in direct meetings with Senator Long, our General Counsel
was able to have Maheu excused from testifying before the Long
Committee.

While negotiations were under way to have Maheu excused from
testifying, Maheu became quite alarmed over the risk of adverse publicity,
which might jeopardize his business with very important clients. He was

especially worried over his Howard Hughes account. He applied pressure

on the Agency in a variety of ways--suggesting that publicity might
expose his past sensitive work for CIA. Maheu's background and past
associations with CIA are the subject of another section of this
report.

James O'Connell states that at one point in the negotiations with

“the Long Committee Maheu indicated that he might brief his attorney,

Edward P. Morgan, fully about his past activities so that Morgan would

be able to decide how best to represent him. Whether he did or not,

and, if so, what he told him, is not known. We have a discussion of
the possible implications of this in a later section of this report.
a. Maheu may very well have told Morgan the details of
the plan to assassinate Castro using members of the gambling
syndicate, and
b. Maheu has now, on three separate occasions, seen CIA
intervene in official proceedings--once for Niarchos and twice

for Maheu.

Schemes in Early 1963

Skin Diving Suit : a

At about the time of the Donovan-Castro negotiations for the

release of the Bay of Pigs prisoners a plan was devised to have

Donovan present a contaminated skin diving suit to Castro asa gift.

‘Castro was known to be a skin diving enthusiast. We cannot put a

precise date on this scheme. Desmond FitzGerald told us of it as if
it had originated after he took over the Cuba task force in January
1963. Samuel Halpern said that it began under William Harvey and
that he, Halpern, briefed FitzGerald on it. Harvey states positively
that he never heard of it.

According to Sidney Gottlieb, this scheme progressed to the
point of actually buying a diving suit and readying it for delivery.
The technique involved dusting the inside of the suit with a fungus
that would produce a disabling and chronic skin disease (Madura foot)
and contaminating the breathing apparatus with tubercle bacilli.
Gottlieb does not remember what came of the scheme or what happened
to the scuba suit. Sam Halpern, who was in on the scheme, at first
said the plan was dropped because it was obviously impracticable.

He later recalled that the plan was abandoned because it was overtaken
by events: Donovan had already given Castro a skin diving suit on his
own initiative. The scheme may have been mentioned to Mike Miskovsky,
who worked with Donovm, but FitzGerald has no recollection that it was.

Booby-trapped Sea Shell

Some time in 1963, date uncertain but probably early in the

year, Desmond FitzGerald, then Chief, SAS, originated a scheme for
doing away with Castro by means of an explosives-rigged sea shell.
_The idea was to take an unusually spectacular sea shell that would
“be certain to catch Castro's eye, load it with an explosive triggered
to blow when the shell was lifted, and submerge it in an area where
Castro often went skin diving.

Des bought two books on Caribbean Mollusca. The scheme was soon

found to be impracticable. None of the shells that might conceivably
C be found in the Caribbean area was both spectacular enough to be sure

of attracting attention and large enough to hold the needed volume

of explosive. The midget submarine that would have had to be used

in emplacement of the shell has too short an operating range for such

an operation.

FitzGerald states that he, Sam Halpern, and Bruce Cheever had
several sessions at which they explored this possibility, but that no
one else was ever brought in on the talks. Halpern believes that he
had conversations with TSD on feasibility and using a hypothetical
case. He does not remember with whom he may have spoken. We are
unable to identify any others who knew of the scheme at the time it

was being considered.

and Nestor Sanchez from his post in Caracas. Otherwise, our interviews
were confined to officers assigned to the headquarters installation.
We opened each interview by referring to the Drew Pearson column of
7 March 1967, citing that as the reason for our interest in learning
of plots to assassinate Castro. We told those interviewed that we
were on a fact-finding mission on behalf of the Director, and that
this was not the usual sort of Inspector General investigation. We
asked each to name any others who were likely to have knowledge of
such plots. We cautioned each not to discuss the subject of the
interview with anyone else--even others whom we might interview.

Project AMLASH - Rolando Cubela

9 March 1961

Jack Stewart, an officer then assigned to the Mexico City
Station, met in Mexico City with Rolando Cubela to sound out Cubela
‘on his views on the Cuban situation. Cubela had been attending the
leftist-sponsored Latin American Conference on National Sovereignty,
Emancipation and Peace held in Mexico City from 5 to 8 March.

Cubela was noncommittal. The meeting was arranged by Carlos
Tepedino (AMWHIP-1), a long-time friend of Cubela. Cubela knew
Stewart casually from Havana where Stewart was once assigned and where
Ge a similar meeting had once been set up but had fallen through.
(Comment: Rolando CUBELA Secades was the second-ranking
leader of the Directorio Revolucionario (DR) 13 de Marso, which

was an elite group of leftist student activists founded in 1956

to organize violence to overthrow the Batista regime. Cubela

was believed to have been one of the participants in the
assassination in 1956 of Lt. Col. Antonio BLANCO Rico, then

the head of Batista's military intelligence service. The DR

members considered themselves quite apart from the Fidelista

26th of July Movement, despite the fact that they had reluctantly

signed a unity pact. In the final days of the revolution the DR
took the Presidential Palace, which they refused to surrender

to Che Guevara but eventually (and reluctantly) turned over to
Fidel Castro. Cubela was a major in the Cuban army, the highest
Cuban military rank.

(A CS Information Report with a date of information of
March 1959 reported that: "Prior to his appointment to the
post of Cuban Military Attache to Spain and his subsequent
departure for Madrid on 27 March 1959, Rolando Cubela frankly
expressed to Prime Minister Fidel Castro his dissatisfaction
over the present situation in Cuba. Cubela . . . privately
told intimates that he was so disgusted with Castro that if he,
Cubela, did not get out of the country soon, he would kill
Castro himself.”

(Although the March 1961 meeting between Stewart and Cubela
in Mexico City was inconslusive, it led to other meetings out of
which grey Project AMLASH. Cubela (AMLASH-1) repeatedly insisted
that the essential first step im overthrowing the regime was the

elimination of Castro himself, which Cubela claimed he was

: prepared to accomplish. He repeatedly requested that we furnish

him the special equipment or material needed to do the job. Those
immediately concerned with the running of the operation now
recall it as one in which the Agency was interested primarily in

keeping Cubela active in the MHAPRON program directed against

Cuban military leaders, while resisting his pleas for technical
assistance in an assassination attempt. The voluminous project
files and the information furnished us by Nestor Sanchez,
Cubela's case officer, do not wholly support those recollections.
The Agency offered both direct and indirect support for Cubela's

plottings.)
28 March 1961

An asset of the Miami Station reported that Rolando Cubela and

Juan Orta wanted to defect and needed help in escaping. (Juan Orta

c was the gangsters' "man inside Cuba" with access to Castro in the

lethal pill operation we have called Gambling Syndicate - Phase One.)
Headquarters expressed interest in exfiltrating Orta and Cubela.
The exfiltration attempt was called offas a result of a report that
the Cuban police were aware of Cubela's desire to defect and of his
departure plans.
(Comment: This is one of three name-links we found in the
AMLASH file between Rolando Cubela and persons involved in the
gambling syndicate episodes. The other two links are even more
nebulous than this. If Cubela was in fact one of the gangsters'
assets inside Cuba, that fact was unlmown to either the CIA

officers running the gangster episodes or to those handling Cubela.)

Carlos Tepedino reported that Rolando Cubela was planning
to attend the French National Student Union Cultural Festival
later in the month. Cubela sent a message to Tepedino saying that
-he wanted to talk with a "friend of Stewart's” in Paris if possible.
‘The message presumably was passed through Cubela's girl friend,
an airline stewardess. The Paris Station was given approval to
approach Cubela, but there is no indication in the file that he

Youth Festival. Lucia's mother and father had arrived in Miami
on 9 June and had been seen off at the ajport by Cubela when they
left Cuba. Lucia's mother told Lucia that Cubela wanted to defect
and to enter the U.S. Cubela said that on his return from Helsinki
he would pass through Paris where he hoped to meet his old friend,

The FBI forwarded to CIA a report of a meeting with an FBI
informant in Miami on 11 June. The informant reported that Cubela
was attending the Youth Festival in Helsinki in July-August 1962
-and wanted to defect. In a detailed transmittal memorandum, the
Far identified its informant as Carlos Tepedino, whom the FBI knew to
be a long-time contact of CIA. Tepedino offered his services to the
FBI to assist in the defection of Cubela. He told the Bureau of
Stewart's meeting with Cubela in Mexico City in March 1961. The
Bureau stated in its memorandum to us that it had told Tepedino

C that his offer would be forwarded to the proper U.S. agency. The
Bureau also stated that it was informing its Paris representative
to refer Tepedino to CIA if Tepedino should contact the Paris Legal

Attache.

arranged by AMCONCERT-1. Tepedino identified the original source

from whom the JMWAVE Station had received its report. Tepedino said

way CIA had handled Cubela's “planned defection" in Paris in August
1961. Tepedino agreed to meet with a CIA officer and contact

arrangements were made.

13 and 14 July 1962

William Wainwright, from headquarters, met with Tepedino in
New York City on 13 and 14 July 1962. Tepedino agreed to meet
Wainwright in Helsinki, and to travel anywhere else necessary, to aid
in an attempt to defect Cubela. Tepedino, who is a successful
Cuban exile jeweller in New York City, refused an offer to pay his
Cc full expenses. He did accept reimbursement for airline tickets and

hotel expenses. He was not offered a salary or bonus.

30 July - 6 August 1962

Tepedino arrived in Helsinki on 30 July. Wainwright was already
there. Cubela was found, and the first of a series of meetings with
him was held on 1 August. The original objective of defecting Cubela
was quickly changed to one of recruiting him in place. ‘These are
excerpts from Wainwright's contact report of the first meeting with
Cubela :

He said he was considering not going back to Cuba, but after

talking to Tepedino, he felt that if he could do something

really significant for the creation of a new Cuba, he—wee
he was interested in returning to carry on the fight there.

He said he was not interested in risking his life for any small

undertaking, but that if he could be given a really large part

to play, he would use himself and several others in Cuba whom A

he could rely upon.

He said he had plans to blow up an oil refinery, as he felt that

the continuing existence of a semblance of normal functioning in

Cuba depended upon a continuing supply of petroleum, supplies of

which, as we know, are at a critical stage today.

He also wanted to plan the execution of Carlos Rodriguez (a top-

ranking Castro subordinate) and the Soviet Ambassador, and also

to eliminate Fidel, by execution if necessary.

While we were making no committments or plans, we pointed out to

Cubela that schemes like he envisioned certainly had their place,

but that a lot of coordination, planning, information-collection,

etc., were necessary prerequisites to ensure the value and

success of such plans.

Cubela stated many times during the course of this and subsequent
CG meetings that he was only interested in involving himself in a

plan of significant action, and which was truly designed to
achieve rapidly his desire to help Cuba.

L- 9 August 1962

Because of the security hazard in too frequent meetings in
Helsinki,where Cubela was surrounded by his associates in the Cuban
delegation, it was agreed that further meetings would be held in
Stockholm and in Copenhagen. Cubela agreed to meet with a Spanish-
speaking case officer in Paris later in the month. Nothing significant
came out of the meetings in Stockholm, 7 - 9 August, except Cubela's
revelation that he had told four of his Cuban associates of his meetings

in Helsinki with Tepedino.

meetings. Wainwright wrote in his contact report:
". . «at one time when we /Wainwright always wrote of himself
as 'we'7 were discussing the various aspects of Cubela's future
role in Cuba, we used the term ‘assassinate.’ The use of this
term, we later learned from Tepedino and from Cubela himself,
was most objectionable to the latter, and he was visibly upset.
It was not the act he objected to, but rather merely the choice
of the word used to describe it. ‘Eliminate was acceptable.'"

(Comment: It is worth noting here that Tepedino, a Cuban

Jeweller in New York, was present at a series of meetings at
which the assassination of Castro was discussed between Cubela
and Wainwright, whom Tepedino knew to be a CIA officer.)

Cubela, Tepedino, and Wainwright met in Paris and were Joined

by Earle Williamson, a Spanish-speaking case officer from Madrid.
Cubela was given S/W training and was issued appropriate S/W supplies.
He was taken to the south of France on 20 August for a demolition
demonstration. Williamson planned to polygraph Cubela and asked
fora polygraph operator to be sent to Paris. Cubela indignantly
refused to be polygraphed. Williamson cabled on 17 August:

Cubela attended the Collegiate Games in Porto Alegre, Brazil,
as a representative of the Cuban government. He was met there by

Wainwright and Tepedino. Also participating was Nestor Sanchez, a

“Spanish-speaking case officer from headquarters, who thereafter acted

as case officer for Cubela.

Cubela claimed that he had written two S/W messages. (Only one
had been received.) He said he was reluctant to use S/W because
he feared the efficiency of the Cuban postal censorship.

‘Cubela discussed a group of Cuban military officers known to
him, ‘and possible ways of approaching them. The problem was, he
explained, that although many of them were anti-Communist, they were
either loyal to Fidel or were so afraid of him that they were
reluctant to discuss any conspiracies for fear they might be
provocations. Cubela said that he thought highly of Ramon GUIN Diaz
(AMTRUNK-10) who was hiding Miguel DIAZ Isalgue (AMICE-14). Diaz
had been sent to Cuba by CIA to recruit Guin in place, and had done so.
Cubela said he planned to use Guin but was concerned about Guin's
"nervous condition" and the fact that he drank heavily. Cubela was
told to assist Guin in Guin's intelligence assignments, but not to

help Guin leave Cuba--as Cubela proposed.

Cc Nestor Sanchez arrived in Paris for meetings with Cubela. (The

stated wish not to see him. The letter may have been written during

contact with Cubela when Sanchez arrived.) Also participating in the
meetings were John (Red) Stent and Richard Long. At the time of these
meetings it was discovered that the French were unilaterally keeping
Cubela under surveillance. CIA informed the French that our contacts
with Cubela were for the purpose of defecting him.

and profound consideration be given as feeling drawn by all who in
contact Cubela is that he determined attempt op against Castro with

or without U.S. support.”

he sought. The contact plan for the meeting, a copy of which is in the
AMLASH file, has this to say on cover:

FitzGerald will represent self as personal representative of
Robert F. Kennedy who traveled Paris for specific purpose
meeting Cubela and giving him assurances of full U.S. support
iff there is change of the present government in Cuba.

‘According to FitzGerald, he discussed the planned meeting with the

DD/P (Helms) who decided it was not necessary to seek approval from
Robert Kennedy for FitzGerald to speak in his name.

The meeting was held in Red Stent's house in Paris on 29
October 1963. FitzGerald used the alias James Clark. Nestor
Sanchez acted as interpreter. Red Stent was not present during the
meeting. Sanchez on 13 November 1963 wrote a memorandum for the
record of the meeting. It reads, in part:

FitzGerald informed Cubela that the United States is
prepared to render all necessary assistance to any anti-communist
Cuban group which succeeds in neutralizing the present Cuban
leadership and assumes sufficient control to invite the United
States to render the assistance it is prepared to give. It was
emphasized that the above support will be forthcoming only after
@ real coup has been effected and the group involved is in a position
to request U.S. (probably under OAS auspices) recognition and
support. It was made clear that the U.S. was not prepared to
commit itself to supporting an isolated uprising, as such an
uprising can be extinguished in a matter of hours if the present
government is still in control in Havana. As for the post-coup
period, the U.S. does not desire that the political clock be
turned back but will support the necessary economic and
political reforms which will benefit the mass of the Cuban
people.

(Comment: ‘Those involved now recall the purpose of the

meeting as being something quite different from that appearing

in written records prepared at about the time of the meeting.
FitzGerald recalls that Cubela spoke repeatedly of the need for an
assassination weapon. In particular, he wanted a high-powered
rifle with telescopic sights or some other weapon that could

be used to kill Castro from a distance. FitzGerald wanted no
part of such a scheme and told Sandez to tell Cubela that the

U.S. simply does not do such things. When he was told this,
Cubela said he wanted confirmation from a senior U.S. official,

not a member of CIA. FitzGerald says that when he met with

XD

Cubela in Paris he told Cubela that the U.S. Government would

have no part of an attempt on Castro's life. Sam Halpern, who
was not present at FitzGerald's meeting with Cubela but who was
thoroughly familiar with all that was going on, has a recollection
identical with that of FitzGerald.)

Be that as it may, the written record tells a somewhat different

story. In Sandez' memorandum of the meeting with Cubela he wrote

that:

i Nothing of an operational nature was discussed at the

FitzGerald meeting. After the meeting Cubela stated that

he was satisfied with the policy discussion but now desired
to know what technical support we could provide him.

14 November 1963

Wainwright met with Tepedino in New York City on 14 November.
Wainwright's contact report reveals Cubela's reaction (as told to
Tepedino) to his meeting with FitzGerald.

The visit with FitzGerald, who acted in the capacity of a
representative of high levels of the Government concerned with
the Cuban problem satisfied Cubela as far as policy was
concerned, but he was not at all happy with the fact that he still
was not given the technical assistance for the operational plan
as he saw it. Tepedino said that Cubela dwelt constantly on
this point. He could not understand why he was denied certain
small pieces of equipment which promised a final solution to
the problem, while, on the other hand, the U.S. Government.
gave much equipment and.money to exile groups for their
ineffective excursions against Cuban coastal targets.

According to Tepedino, Cubela feels strongly on this point,
C and if he does not get advice and materials from a U.S.

Government technician, he will probably become fed-up

again, and we will lose whatever progress we have made to date.

-91-

wholly on documents found in the project file. Beginning here is an
account of an episode in the Cubela operation on which there is no
documentary evidence. Dr. Gunn has a record of nine contacts and
their dates; otherwise, this summary is drawn from the recollections
of those involved.

Sanchez says that, while Cubela was anxious to do away with
“Castro, Cubela was not willing to sacrifice his own life in exchange
for Castro's. What Cubela really wanted was a high-powered, silenced
rifle with an effective range of hundreds or thousands of yards.

Cubela finally said that, as a doctor of medicine (which he was), he
was quite sure that we could devise some technical means of doing the

C Job that would not automatically cause him to lose his own life in
the try.

Samuel Halpern and Nestor Sanchez approached Dr. Gunn for
assistance. Although none of the participants specifically so stated,
it may be inferred that they were seeking a means of assassination
of a sort that Cubela might reasonably have been expected to have
devised himself. What they settled upon was Black Leaf 40, a common,
easily-obtainable insecticide containing about hee sulphate.
Nicotine is a deadly poison that may be administered orally, by injection,
or by absorption through the skin. It is likely that there also were
discussions of means of administering the poison, because Gunn was ready
to move when asked.

The plan reached the action stage when Halpern and Sanchez contacted

Gunn again on the morning of 20 November 1963 and told him that the
device for administering the poison (a ballpoint pen rigged as a
hypodermic syringe) had to be ready in time for Sanchez to catch a

plane at noon the next day. Gunn says that he went immediately to

the FI/D workshop and spent the rest of the day and most of that

‘night fabricating the device. Those in FI/D who worked with him

knew what he was trying to make but not for whom it was intended.
Eventually, after seven or eight failures, he succeeded in converting
a@ Paper-Mate pen into a hypodermic syringe that worked. He said that
the needle was so fine that the victim would hardly feel it when it
was inserted--he compared it with the scratch from a shirt with

too much starch. He delivered the workable device to Sanchez the
following morning and retained two of the later prototypes. He states
that they are still in his safe. “He does not know what happened to
the device he gave Sanchez; he does not remember its having been
returned to him. He believes he was told that Cubela refused to
accept the device. He says he would not now be able to differentiate

the final pen from the earlier prototypes that are in his safe.
22 November 1963

Nestor Sanchez arrived in Paris on the morning of 22 November

and met with Cubela late that afternoon. Sanchez states that he

~93-

SECRET-EVES CULY

showed the pen/syringe to Cubela and explained how it worked. He is not
sure, but he believes that Cubela accepted the device but said that he
would not take it to Cuba with him. Sanchez distinctly recalls that
Cubela didn't think much of the device. Cubela said that, as a doctor,
he knew all about Black Leaf 40 and that we surely could come up
with something more sophisticated than that. It should be noted that
Gunn and Sanchez agree that the syringe was not loaded. Cubela was
expected to supply his own poison; we merely suggested Black leaf 40
as an effective poison for use in the syringe.

Sanchez wrote a contact report of the meeting. It makes no

mention of a pen or of poison. The following is a summary of the

contact report. Cubela said that he was returning to Cuba fully
determined to pursue his plans to initiate a coup against Castro.
Sanchez reiterated the assurances given Cubela by FitzGerald of full
U.S. support if a real coup against the Castro regime were successful.
Cubela asked for the following items to be included in a cache inside
Cuba: 20 hand grenades, two high-powered rifles with telescopic
sights, and approximately 20 pounds of C-4 explosive and related
equipment. Cubela suggested the best place for the cache was on

the finca (farm) managed by his friend, Guin (AMTRUNK/10). Since he
was returning to Cuba by way of Prague, he did not want to carry s/w

or any other incriminating materials with him. As they were coming

- 93a-

out of the meeting, Sanchez and Cubela were informed that President
Kennedy had been assassinated. Cubela was visibly moved over the
news. He asked, "Why do such things happen to good people?” The

contact report does not state the time nor the duration of the

Sanchez-Cubela meeting, but it is likely that at the very moment

‘President Kennedy was shot a CIA officer was meeting with a Cuban

agent in Paris and giving him an assassination device for use against

Castro. Sanchez states that he received an OPIM cable from FitzGerald
that night or early the next morning telling him that everything was
off. We do not find such a cable in the AMLASH file. There is
@ record in the file that Sanchez was due to arrive back in
Washington at 1810 hours, 23 November.

The AMLASH project was probably about as widely known within
the Clandestine Services as any other project of a similar nature.
However, we can identify only four people who know of the just-
described episode involving a hypodermic syringe and Black Leaf ho.
Sanchez knew all of the story, Halpern knew most of it, and Gunn knew
much of it. FitzGerald did not mention this aspect of the Cubela
operation when he first briefed us on it. When we went back to
hin later with specific questions, he said he remembered something
about Black Leaf ho, but nothing whatever about a device for

administering it. Gunn said he had the impression that MtzGerald

his solution to the Cuban problem was the only one feasible and that
he had to continue trying. Cubela was told that the U.S. Government
could not and would not in any way become involved or provide

assistance in the task he had planned for himself. Cubela appeared
“to understand our position and said that if he needed help he would

look elsewhere.
10 December 1964

Memorandum prepared by Sanchez and left with Robert Owen, of the
G Paris Station, as background on the then current status of the AMLASH
operation--excerpts:

“Artime does not know and we do not plan to tell him that we
are in direct contact with Cubela, nor does Cubela know and we
do not desire he know that we are in direct contact with Artime.

“Cubela was told and fully understands that U.S. Government
cannot become involved to any degree in the 'first step' of his
plan. If he needs support, he realizes that he will have to
get it elsewhere. FYI: This is where Artime could fit in
micely in giving any support Cubela would request."

(Comment: Sanchez explained to us that what had happened
was that SAS contrived to put Artime and Cubela together in such

~a way that neither knew that the contact had been engineered
by CIA. The thought was that Artime needed a man inside and

Cubela wanted a silenced weapon, which CIA was unwilling to furnish

and take over the government. It quickly became clear that he was
referring to Cubela. Garcia-Bango said that he had always been

(Note: There is a discrepancy in dates. The memorandum prepared at
the time lists dates of 2, 3, and 4 May. From other evidence in the
file, it is apparent that the month was June--not May.) One Victor
ESPINOSA Hernandez, a former FM trainee who was terminated as a
malcontent on 20 March 1961, contacted an I&NS agent on 2 June 1965
with a story that Espinosa thought affected U.S. security. I&NS
heard him out and then sent him to the FBI. The FBI listened to the
story on 3 June and then sent him to CIA. A CIA officer interviewed
him on 4 June. Espinosa said that in May he had received a letter
from a friend in Paris urging him to meet in Paris with a friend of
cubela. Espinosa went to Paris and met with Alberto Blanco, one

of Cubela's closest associates in the supposed plan to assassinate

Castro. Blanco claimed to have a message from Cubela, which Cubela

wanted Espinosa to deliver to CIA. The message was that Cubela and the

others with him were in a position to kill Castro and others in the
regime, but they needed some help and to know whether the CIA and the
U.S. Government were with them and willing to support them. If the
answer vere affirmative, Cubela would send out details on what he
needed. From his story it was obvious that Espinosa knew the full
details of the Cubela operation.

The accused Jose Luis Gonzales Gallarreta, who worked as a
diplomatic attache in the Cuban Emgassy in Spain, betrayed his
country for 100,000 dollars given him by CIA agents whom he
contacted only a month after his arrival in Spain. (He) met
with an official of the aforementioned organization of
international subversion named James Noel who covered his
activities by appearing as an official of the U.S. Embassy in
Spain. Noel demanded that biographic information and
information about the Cuban diplomatic mission be furnished him
under this arrangement.

Cubela during his stay in Europe makes three trips to Spain,
on 26 December 1964, and on 6 and 20 February 1965. The
revolutionary ringleader Artime goes to Madrid at the beginning
of February 1965. A meeting is held between Cubela and Artime
in which they agree on the final plan.

This plan would begin with a personal attack aimed at
Maj. Fidel Castro Ruz. This criminal act would be followed
by an armed invasion of the country 48 hours later by U.S.
troops. The attack against Comrade Fidel Castro would be made
using a 7.62 mm. FAL rifle that Cubela owned. This weapon
would be fitted with a powerful 4x40 teflescopic sight and a

* silencer.

Artime sent Gallego to the United States to get the
telescopic sight and the silencer. Once obtained, this
equipment was delivered to Blanco Romariz. He in turn delivered
it to Gonzalez Gallarreta who then delivered it to Cubela the
day before he left Madrid.

In order to insure the successpf his plans, Cubela meets
with defendant Guin. Guin had been recruited since September
1963 as a spy for the Yankee CIA. This recruiting was done by
CIA agent Miguel Diaz who infiltrated Cuba in order to recruit
him, and did so.

Seized in Cubela's residence was a Tasco brand telescopic
sight with accessories, the FAL rifle, large quantities of weapons
and ammunition for them, fragmentation and incendiary grenades,
and other military equipment and materiel.

The punishment to which the defendants are subject and which

Cubela Secades, Rmon Guin Diaz, Jose Luis Gonzalez Gallarreta,
and Alberto Blanco Romariz--the death penalty by firing squad.
For Juan Alsina Navarro, Guillermo Cunill Alvarez, and Angel

i (Comment: It is worth noting that none of Cubela's dealings
with CIA from March 1961 until November 1964 were mentioned in the
trial proceedings. The first association of Cubela with CIA
was in connection with his trip to Europe in late 1964 and
early 1965 during which he had his meetings with Artime. The
trial evidence was confined to Cubela's counterrevolutionary
activities growing out of those meetings with Artime in
December 1964 and February 1965. None of his many direct
contacts with CIA officers, some of whom he knew by true name,
were mentioned. There is not even a hint of the ballpoint pen/
CO hypodermic/Black Leaf 40 episode. ‘The Cuban authorities may
have gotten that information from him and decided not to
“introduce 1t in evidence, but we can think of no convincing
reason why they would have withheld it. The closest we can come
to a decent reason, and it is pure conjecture, is this: Castro
may have thought it politically imprudent to allow the execution
of someone so close to his inner circle, who had merely plotted
without acting. If the full details of Cubela's involvement
with CIA had come out in court, Castro might have had little

” excuse for asking for leniency.)

Discussion of Assassination at High-Level Govermment Meetings

Drew Pearson claims to have a report that there was a high-level
meeting at the Department of State at which plans for the assassina-
tion of Castro were discussed. We find record of two high-level,
Anteragency meetings at which assassination of Castro was raised. The
‘first (and probably the one to which Pearson refers) was at the
Department of State on 10 August 1962. It wasa meeting of the
Special Group (Augmented). ‘The second meeting we have identified
was held on 30 July 1964. It was a meeting of the 303 Committee
and probably was held in the White House Situation Room. The two

Cc i meetings are described separately below.

10 August 1962

The Special Group (Augmented) met at the Department of State,
either in Secretary Rusk's office or in his conference room. The
following are recorded as being present:

CIA John McCone, William Harvey

Secretary Thomas Parrott

Tom Parrott's minutes of the meeting make no mention of the
“subject of assassination. Both McCone and Harvey recall that
McNamara raised the subject. Harvey's notes taken at the meeting
show that it was also mentioned by Murrow, but the nature of the
comments was not recorded. Mr. McCone states, in a memorandum of
14 April 1967, that he recalls meetings on 8 or 9 August in the

JCS Operations Room in the Pentagon and on 10 August 1962 in

Secretary Rusk's conference room. At one of these meetings (and
McCone now recalls it as being at the JCS) the suggestion was made
that top people in the Cuban regime, including Castro, be liquidated.
(Comment: As it will later be seen, Mr. McCone's recollection
is probably faulty. It is quite clear that assassination came
up for discussion at the 10 August meeting at State.)
Mr. McCone says that he took immediate exception to the discussion
and promptly after the meeting called on Secretary McNamara personally
to emphasize his position. According to McCone, McNamara "heartily
agreed." McCone states in his memorandum that at no time did the

suggestion receive serious consideration by the Special Group (Augmented )

or by any individual responsible for policy. McCone adds that through
the years the Cuban problem was discussed in tems such as "dispose
of Castro," “remove Castro,” and "knock off Castro," etc., but that
these phrases were always construed to mean the overthrowing of the

communist government in Cuba. Harvey recalls that, when McCone

-told him of the McCone-McNamara conversation, McCone said that if he,

McCone, were to be involved in such a thing he would be excommunicated.

Following the 10 August meeting, and without reference to the
reported exchange between McCone and McNamara, Lansdale addressed
@ memorandwn on 13 August to William Harvey (CIA), Robert Hurwitch
(State), General Harris (Defense), and Don Wilson (USIA). The
memorandum assigned responsibility for drafting papers on various
subjects related to the Cuban operation. Harvey's assignment
included: "Intelligence, Political (splitting the regime, [portion
excised fron the CIA file copy/).

On 14 August, Harvey submitted a memorandum to the DD/P (Helms)
reporting the Lansdale communication and what Harvey had done about
it. Harvey's memorandum to the mp/P states that the excised portion
had consisted of the phrase: "including elimination of leaders".
Harvey wrote that he had phoned Lansdale's office and had spoken with
Frank Hand in Lansdale's absence. Harvey said he had protested the

use of the phrase and had proposed that steps be taken to have it

excised from all copies. This was agreed to. Harvey deleted the
phrase from his own copy and assumes that instructions were given
to other recipients to do the same. Harvey told us that Lansdale
repeatedly tried to raise the matter of assassination of Castro

with Harvey over the next several weeks. Harvey says that he always

‘avoided such discussions. Harvey estimates that five persons ‘in

Lansdale's office were generally aware of the sensitive details of
Project MONGOOSE and of Lansdale's interest in assassination as an

aspect of it.

30 July 1964

The 303 Committee met in regular session, probably in the Situation

"It was agreed that Mr. FitzGerald would contact Mr. Sam

Papich of the FBI in regard to the earlier report of an

alleged plot with Mafia overtones to assassinate Castro and

which the Attorney General agreed to handle as a matter of

law enforcement."

The reference is clearly to a 10 June 1964 memorandum information
-report from the DD/P to the Director. The following additional
"elite" dissemination was made of it:

Special Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs

Assistant Secretary, Inter-American Affairs, Department of State

Director of Intelligence and Research, Department of State

Director, Defense Intelligence Agency

The Attorney General

Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation

Deputy Director of Central Intelligence
C 7 Deputy Director for Intelligence

The report related a proposal for the assassination of Castro
that was made to prominent Cuban exiles. The Mafia appeared to be
involved in the scheme. The asking price for doing the job was
$150,000, with a guarantee of $10,000 for expenses. A wealthy Cuban
exile, Jose Mario "Pepin" Bosch, President of Bacardi Rum International,
was reported ready to contribute $50,000. Bosch approached the Chief
of Station, JMWAVE, and suggested that the U.S. Government also
contribute funds. The suggestion was rejected out of hand. The record
indicates that CIA's only involvement in the plot was to report

information of its existence. The last record we find of the incident

. 4s a memorandum from the DCI (McCone) to Bundy, dated 19 August 1964,
reporting the results of FBI interviews with the alleged participants.
Obviously, nothing came of the plot.

(Comment: It may be only coincidence, but we are struck
by the point that this group of plotters, allegedly including
gangster elements, offered to assassinate Castro for $150,000,
which is precisely the sum that CIA offered to pay in an
earlier plot that very definitely involved gangster elements.
It could be the same group of gangsters, or it could be that

the criminal underworld knows the "going price.")

C As we have said earlier, if Drew Pearson has firm information on
a high-level meeting at which assassination of Castro was discussed,
it is likely that the reference would be to the 10 August 1962 meeting
of the Special Group (Augmented). The 30 July 1964 303 Committee
Meeting is described only because its reference to assassination of
Castro might be distorted to assume some of the characteristics of

the Pearson story.

The Possible Ramifications of the Gambling Syndicate Operation

The earlier sections of this report describe all of the CIA
schemes aimed at the assassination of Castro that we have been able
to discover. The accounts of the two phases of the gambling
‘syndicate operation are factual to the extent that they are based
on what those interviewed recall or believe the facts to have been.

-It is evident that some of those facts have leaked, are being talked
about, or are being peddled. On the opposite page is a list of the
main details of the story Drew Pearson has, as they are known to us,
together with a brief comment on the apparent accuracy of each.

Gr There is support in fact for most of the details in Pearson's story.
He has a garbled account of the role played by Robert Kennedy, and
he errs in telling the story as if all of the details are part of
a single story, which they are not. For the most part, though,
his facts are straight and he has the truly important aspects of
the gambling syndicate operation.

Until James O'Connell returned on 2 May from his meetings in
Las Vegas, we were faced with the difficulty of being unable to
estimate the dimensions of the problem facing the Agency unless we

could discover what has been leaked, by whom, to whom, and for what

purpose. None of those things could be deduced with confidence from

the information then available to us. O'Connell, who has already
reported to you orally and will be submitting his written report
directly to you, is able to shed some light on the likely sources
of Pearson's information. He has also briefed us on his conversations
(with Maheu. These are the key points:
a. Maheu did brief his attorney, Edward P. Morgan, on
Maheu's participation in Phase One.
%. Maheu knew nothing of Phase Two while it was under way
and has never heard of it from Roselli.
c. Morgan and Roselli were acquainted, independently of
e " Maheu, well before Maheu became involved with Roselli in the
gambling syndicate operation. Roselli was steered to Morgan by
H. M. Greenspun, editor and publisher of the Las Vegas Sun.
dad. Maheu suspects that Roselli is a client of Morgan's.
e. Roselli is drinking heavily. Morgan has been in las
Vegas once or twice recently, was drinking too much, and was
“indiscreet.”
f. Jin Garrison, Edward Morgan, and Roselli were all in
Las Vegas at the same time this past March. Garrison was in~
“touch with Roselli; so was Morgan. It is our impression that
Greenspun was also involved in the conversations. We do not know

the date, but it might be noted that one of Pearson's columns

*It is quite possible that the fact of Robert Kennedy's having been

appeared on 7 March. -
g- According to Maheu, Morgan and Jack Anderson, Drew
Pearson's associate, are very close.
This seems clearly to point the finger at Roselli as the ultimate

source of the information on the gambling syndicate plot and to

-confirm Morgan as Pearson's source.

We can test the accuracy of this assumption against analysis we

had done earlier in an effort to identify the likely source of

Pearson's story. On the opposite page is a listing of persons
definitely known to be witting of certain key facts now in Pearson's
possession. The list includes CIA officers who knew more than one
of the key facts, plus all known outsiders. These were our
conclusions:

a. If Drew Pearson has a single source, and if Pearson's
immediate source is the ultimate source of the leak, and if
compartmentation was not violated, then Bill Harvey emerges
as the likely candidate. He was the only person we found in
the course of this inquiry who knew all four of the key facts
at the time the Pearson columns appeared. We preferred not to
think that Bill Harvey was the culprit. We could find no
persuasive reason why he would wish to leak the story

| deliberately, and we doubted that he would be so indiscreet as

to leak it accidentally. Further, if he were the donecad we
could expect Pearson's story to be completely accurate, because
Harvey knew the truth.

b. If we ruled out Harvey as the source, then it appeared
that there must be at least two ultimate sources of leaks. ‘The
State Department meeting was not known to any of the other
participants in the operation--assuming that Harvey did not
mention it to any of them. Therefore, it is quite possible
that the leak on the State Department meeting has come from
someone who has no direct knowledge of the gambling syndicate
operation but does know of the meeting.

c. From the standpoint of who-knew-what, the next most

“likely source of the original leak is John Roselli. He is, in
fact, the only person with direct and continuous participation
throughout both phases of the gambling syndicate operation. He
introduced Maheu to Sam Giancana as the first step in getting
the operation under way, and he was the one who made the final
break with Varona when the operation was abandoned. He knows
everything that went on with the gangsters, with Orta, and with

“Varona between those dates. He and Robert Maheu are the only
non-CIA participants with immediate knowledge of the Robert

Kennedy aspect. Shef Edwards had lunch with Roselli and Maheu

in Los Angeles in the summer of 1962. Edwards says that Roselli
Amew Edwards' true name and his position in the Agency. Edwards
said he took the occasion to express his personal appreciation
to Roselli, and told Roselli that he, Edwards, had personally
told Attorney General Kennedy of what Roselli had tried to do
in the national interest. We know that Kennedy was merely
briefed on the operation--and only on Phase One at that--but
Roselli may have inferred that Kennedy had an active role in
the operation.

dad. We did not know what Robert Maheu knew of the

operation firsthand, because we had conflicting information on

C precisely when he was cut off from direct participation. He

has direct knowledge of the first phase, but probably little
if any of the second phase (from which Pearson's story seems
to come). If Maheu knows of the second phase, he could have
learned of it only from Roselli.

e. Maceo, about whom we know very little, was "Roselli's
man" in the second phase. He presumably knows of the pills
and of the three-man team, but the other details he could have
-known only from Roselli.

limited to the pills and the team, but they should know considerably

more of the specifics; such as, who received the pills, the

composition of the team, and the eventual fate of the team.
@- Giancana and Trafficante were presumably cut out of

Phase Two. They could have learned of it only from Roselli.

About all that emerged from this review of "who had direct knowledge

-of what” was support for the hypothesis that Drew Pearson's story

probably is drawn from more than one informant: one on the State

Department meeting and another (or others) on the gambling syndicate

operation. We also postulated that Roselli is the most likely
ultimate source of Pearson's story. This line of reasoning and the
information O'Connell got from Maheu are consistent.

Our supposition until now was that the immediate and the
ultimate sources, if different people, were leaking or peddling the
story with ulterior motives in mind. What those ulterior motives
might be were difficult to fathom--for these reasons:

a. If protection was what the source was seeking, he
could be better assured of getting it by a direct approach

to CIA for help.

>. Maheu was the only known link associating Morgan with
"the syndicate plot, and Maheu stands only to lose by having his
role become common knowledge.

¢. Those who know Morgan, Maheu, and Roselli thought it

quite out of character for any of the three to be spreading

the story deliberately for a private purpose.

In learning of the Rose1li-Morgan link, we are relieved of the
need for speculation as to how the story has gotten out. It is
-quite likely that Roselli is the source, Morgan the channel, and
‘Anderson and Pearson the recipients. We may also be relieved of
the need for speculation as to why the story is being told. The
inference to be drawn from O'Connell's discoveries in Las Vegas is
that Roselli is drinking too much and talking and that Morgan is also
drinking and talking to a newspaperman friend.

O Put in its best light--that there is no ulterior motive in
spreading the story--it is questionable whether we are any better off
now than we were before; our position may be even worse than we had
suspected.

a.We may now assume that Pearson's story is not patched
together from bits and pieces picked up here and there. His
ultimate source, Roselli, knows more about certain details of
the gambling syndicate operation than we do, and he evidently
_ has talked. ‘Trying now to hush up further leaks might do more
hara than good; the story is already out and probably in

considerable detail.

Db. The Roselli-Garrison contact in Las Vegas in March
is particularly disturbing. It lends substance to reports that
Castro had something to do with the Kennedy assassination in
retaliation for U.S. attempts on Castro's life. We do not know
that Castro actually tried to retaliate, but we do know that
there were such plots against Castro. Unhappily, it now appears

that Garrison may also know this.

The publicity on this subject has probably not yet mm its
course.
a. Drew Pearson has not yet, as far as we know, used two
@ of his best goodies: the story of the pills and the fact of

the State Department meeting.

b. Garrison has not yet revealed his full case. When he
does, we should expect to find CIA prominently displayed.

¢. The Philippine National Bureau of Investigation has a
Puerto Rican in custody who claims he participated in a Castro-
inspired. assassination plot in Dallas. He also claims that
Castro made a speech in July 1962 threatening to try to
assassinate Kennedy in retaliation for two Kennedy attempts

on Castro's life. (We have found no record nor recollection of

; Castro having made such a speech.) The Puerto Rican is in the

We may expect the FBI to take him over and wring him dry. :
We face the likelihood that things will get worse before they begin
to get better. In the following paragraphs we explore some of the

ramifications and discuss what might be done about them.

Should we try to silence those who are talking or might later talk?

It appears to us that this tactic offers little chance of
success. For one thing, the story is already out and probably in
about as full detail as it ever will be. The only participant on
whom we have any real leverage is Maheu, and he has already done all
of the talking he is likely to do (to his lawyer, Morgan). We have no
hold on any of the others who might furnish confirmation for Roselli's
story.

a. Varona is almost certainly not a friend of the Agency.
Varona

As the Bay of Pigs operation developed, /was one of the most

eritical of the lack of Cuban control of the operation and of

the people involved in it. He was bitter over termination of

Agency support of his exile group (and the consequent loss of

: his own income). The last we know of him he was in New York

living a hand-to-mouth existence as a part-time auto salesman.

b. Roselli, Giancana, and Trafficante have fallen on
"evil" days. Giancana is reported (in a Chicago newspaper of
recent date) to have been deposed as the Mafia head in Chicago
and was rumored to be hiding in Mexico. Maheu reports that
Trafficante is in jail in Tampa. Roselli is persona non grata
in las Vegas, being required to register with the police any
time he is in town. None of them would have compunctions about
dragging in his CIA connection when he was being pushed by law
enforecement authorities. Giancana has already done it when the
FBI was crowding him in 1963. Roselli appears to be doing it in

Cc his conversations with Morgan and Garrison.

(Comment: The cover story used with Roselli, Giancana,
Trafficante, Varona, and presumably with Orta was that the
sponsors were U.S. businessmen with interests in Cuba. Roselli
soon concluded that CIA was the true sponsor and so told
O'Connell. In Roselli's subsequent dealings with Harvey and
Edwards he came to know this for sure. Giancana named CIA
in 1963. We must assume that the others, with the possible

exception of Orta and perhaps Varona, are equally sure that CIA

was the true sponsor.)

c¢. Morgan may always retire behind the screen of an attorney-
client relationship, as he reportedly did when the FBI approached

him on the Pearson story.

d. Pearson, Anderson, and Greenspun (in Las Vegas) are
newspapermen with a newsworthy story. Pearson has already
published much of it.

e. Maheu does have good reason for not wanting the story
aired further. Unfavorable publicity might cause him to lose
his lucrative client, Howard Hughes. There might be some value
to be gained from endorsing his suggestion that he approach

Morgan and perhaps Roselli and urge discretion.

What do other components of Government know about this operation?

Former Attorney General Robert Kennedy was fully briefed by

Houston and Edwards on 7 May 1962. A memorandum confirming the

oral briefing was forwarded to Kennedy on 14 May 1962. The memorandum

does not use the word “assassinate,” but there is little room for

misinterpretation of what was meant. Presumably the original of that
Nw memorandum is still in the files of the Justice Department. It should

be noted that the briefing of Kennedy was restricted to Phase One

of the operation, which had ended about a year earlier. Phase Two

was already under way at the time of the briefing, but Kennedy was

not told of it.

As far as we know, the FBI has not been told the sensitive

operational details, but it would be naive to assume that they have
not by now put two and two together and come out with the right
answer. They know of CIA's involvement with Roselli and Giancana

as a result of the Las Vegas wiretapping incident. From the Chicago

newspaper stories of August 1963, and from Giancana's own statement,

‘it appears that they know this related to Cuba. When Roselli's

story reached them (Roselli to Morgan to Pearson to Warren to Rowley
to the FBI), all of the pieces should have fallen into place. They
should by now have concluded that CIA plotted the assassination of
Castro and used U.S. gangster elements in the operation.

There is some support for this thesis in the conversation I had
with Sam Papich on 3 May 1967 when I told him of the expected meeting
between Roselli and Harvey. ‘Sam commented that Roselli and Giancana
have CIA "over a barrel" because of "that operation.” He said that
he doubted that the FBI would be able to.do anything about either
Roselli or Giancana because of "their previous activities with your
people."

Can we plausibly deny that we plotted with gangster elements to
assassinate Castro?

No, we cannot. We are reasonably confident that there is nothing

in writing outside of the Government that would confirm Pearson's

non-gangster witnesses who could lend confirmation.

dad. If an independent investigation were to be ordered,
_ the investigators could learn everything that we have learned.
Such an investigation probably would uncover details unknown to

us, because it would have access to the non-CIA participants.

Can CIA state or imply that it was merely an instrument of policy?

Not in this case. While it is true that Phase Two was carried
out in an atmosphere of intense Kennedy administration pressure to
do something about Castro, such is not true of the earlier phase.
Phase One was initiated in August 1960 under the Eisenhower
administration. Phase Two is associated in Harvey's mind with the
Executive Action Capability, which reportedly was developed in
Tresponse to White House urgings. Again, Phase One had been started

and abandoned months before the Executive Action Capability appeared

on the scene.

When Robert Kennedy was briefed on Phase One in May 1962, he
strongly admonished Houston and Edwards to check with the Attorney
General in advance of any future intended use of U.S. criminal
elements. This was not done with respect to Phase Two, which was
‘already well under way at the time Kennedy was briefed. The
Pearson story, which is now causing us so much distress, includes

one detail that is found only in Phase Two: the three-man team.

What measures might be taken to lessen the damage?

We see little to be gained from personal approaches now to
Maheu, Morgan, or Roselli. Maheu has much to lose and might be able
to prevail upon Morgan and Roselli not to spread the story further.
It is questionable whether any such urging would be effective with
Roselli, because Roselli stands only to gain from having the story
of his CIA connection known and accepted. We cannot now suppress
the story, because it is already out and may boil up afresh from the
Garrison case. If we were to approach any of the participants and
urge discretion upon him, and if this became known, it would merely

lend credence to a tale that now sounds somewhat improbable.

CIA Invelvement in Cuban Counter-
revolutionary /.ctivities--Arrest of
Rolando CUBSLA Secades and

SUBJECT

"1, With reference to the Habana Prengza Latina news release
of 5 March 1966, alleging CIA involvement with Rolando CUBELA
, Secades and Rarnon Tornas GUIN Diaz in counterrevolutionary
GC activities, the following outlines the Agency's contact with these two
persons, _

2. GUIN was recruited by a CIA agent in August 1953 inside
Cuba as a Principal Agent to recrvit high-level military leaders.
He has had no contact with CIA stafi personzel.

3, CUBELA, the more important of the two men, has been
in contact with this Agency during the period 1961-1965. The lest
Agency contact with CUBELA was in February 1965. He has had
direct contact with several Agency officials and, in addition, is

, known to have been in contact with Cuban exiles, including Manuel
ARTIME. CIA's contact and relationshios with both CUBELA and GUIN
was for the express purpose of using them to collect intelligence on
military activities and objectives in Cuba, The Agency was not
involved with cither of these two men in a plot to 2gsassinate Fidel
Castro, as claimed in the Prensa Latins news release, nor did it
ever encourage either of these two perscns to attempt such an act.

4. Mr. James Noel, mentioned in the press release, is a
CIA cfficial stationed in the U.S, Embassy in Madrid, Spain, and was
in contact with both Odon Alvarez de la CAMPA and Jose Luis

of these individuals.

5. The Agency has also had limited direct and indirect
contact with Jorge ROBRINDO, Alberto BLANCO Ramirez, and
