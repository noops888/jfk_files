MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr.  MeGeorge Bundy Ee

SUBJECT 3 Intention of Cuban Exile Student oa
(DRE) to Send Letter to President Kennedy

1. Confirming the advice given you®on 8 December, it
has been reported to us by a reliable penetration source’ --
within the organization that the Cuban exile student organi-
zation, DRE (Directorio Revolucionario Estudiantil) , with
headquarters’in Miami, has drafted a letter for President
Kennedy. The gist of this letter is that the DRE, while -
recognizing the U. S.°Government's ‘problems and difficulties
with respect to the Cuban situation, still expects President
Kennedy to "fullfil his promises to liberate Cuba."

2. The DRE leaders plan to give the letter to their
regular CIA contact officer on°12 December for transmittal
to the President. Subsequently, if steps are not taken by
the United States Government to carry out this pledge, the
DRE ''will act." The report does-not state specifically what
action is contemplated: by the DRE, but we assume that it
would involve a resumption of commando raids and harrassment
tactics against Cuba.

3. On 13 December the DRE plans to ce this letter
to the press and on the same date will attempt to stimulate
maximum propaganda support in Latin America. for the DRE position.
Preparatory to this attempt, the DRE will send special
emissaries to Costa Rica, Mexico, and other Latin American
countries, If the campaign results in substantial support
for the DRE position, the organization would prepare to ~
initiate “action against Cuba" subsequent to 17 December.

In addition to the foregoing, the DRE is considering broading
its base and developing into’a political movement, provided
it can obtain appropriate Support | in Latin America.

- 4 We have instructed the source of this Pobre! who
is a confidant of the DRE leaders and, in fact, has been asked
“to attempt
to dissuade the DRE from taking this precipitous action -which
could harm the cause of Cuban liberation. We have not as yet

been er of the results of our source’ s ae in this
regard.

5. ‘If the DRE leadership goes through with its plan to:
present this letter to its CIA contact officer on 12 December,
the officer will make every effort to dissuade the DRE :

leadership from thus attempting to. pressure the United States.
Government.

6. We will keep you 1 apprised of any important developmesits
in this matter. i
