‘available to SR/CI/Research on that particular sub-
ject. Some of these studies were sterilized sub- -
sequently for passage to a-wider list of recipients

than the sensitivity of the original production

permitted. Some studies were translated and given
to foreign liaison services.* Many of these studies
were the result of suggestions for research topics fae
from other SR Division offices, CIA-wide components,
and organizations outside the CIA. i
Throughout the period of this history, SR/-
Reports, in coordination with Chief,SR/CI, had re-
sponsibility for the dissemination of timely general i
CI reports on the RIS. The area division concerned

disseminated CI reports on the RIS which were clearly, |

of only local significance.

J. Warren Commission Studies

The President's Commission on the Assassina-
tion of President Kennedy, also known as the Warren
Commission, through its General Counsel, Mr. J. Lee

Rankin, frequently called upon the CIA for information

in 1964. SR/CI/Research Branch responded to many
of these requests for information working through
CI Staff which assumed managerial control for CIA
communications with the commission. The branch
furnished information to the commission on a wide»
variety of topics concerning the RIS, Lee Harvey
Oswald, and Oswald's associates in the USSR.*

In a meeting between CIA representatives and
Messrs. Allen Dulles and Rankin of the Warren Com-
mission on 14 January 1964, Rankin asked that CIA
draft questions to be included in a letter to the
Soviet Government concerning the Oswald case. The
questions were to be "not too technical," should
be sent soon, and were to be phrased in generalities
in order to allow the Soviets more flexibility than
would a. longer, more pointed letter based on con-
crete US Government findings. These questions con-
stituted the first direct involvement of Wigren and
his Research Branch in the commission's work.

The commission wished to account in detail

States. Bagley, Chief, SR/CI, subsequently di-
rected Wigren to begin a chronological tabulation
of Oswald's activities in thé USSR as collated —
from various sources. The commission made avail-
able to Wigren documents and reports already ac- :
quired from other US Government investigative
agencies, The commission agreed in principle to
honor CIA sensitivity classifications to documents
originated in the Agency for use of the commission.
The Agency's role was limited to written communica-
tions to the ee

By 21 January 1964 Wigren and his colleages
had prepared and transmitted the questions to the
commission for relay to the Soviet Government.
Soviet defector Petr Deryabin had contributed to
this endeavor. The questionnaire had four basic
parts. The first series of questions sought to

make an assessment of Oswald's mental and physical —

- condition. The Soviets were requested to furnish

information on his medical treatment in the USSR
while in the hospital following his suicide at-
tempt in 1959. as well as any psychological evalua-

tions of him. The second series of questions

sought to assess Oswald's. use of and dependence on
weapons. He had owned a shotgun in the USSR and
had joined a hunting organization there. The
third series of questions sought to complete Warren
Commission documentation of Oswald's background and
career in the USSR. Those items particularly
sought were his correspondence with the Soviet Gov-
ernment, Soviet Government documents issued to him
concerning his request for asylum and permission
to reside in the USSR, documents and registrations
of his residence and employment in the USSR, and
documents concerning his departure from the USSR.
The final question asked whether Oswald had a police
record in the USSR and requested information and
documents if so

A comprehensive SR/CI/Research paper on the
Oswald case went to the commission on 25 January
1964. This was a detailed chronology of Oswald's
sojourn in the USSR together with an alphabetical
listing of persons in the USSR whom the Oswalds
knew or mentioned. Identifying information was in-
cluded whenever available. This chronology was in

preliminary formbut the commission urgently required

collated material to support the taking of direct
testimony. The source material for the chronology
included personal documents , interviews, and official
and private correspondence. Traces were based on
CIA files and the Moscow and Minsk telephone direc-
tories. These preliminary name traces were also :
sent to the commission on the same day as the chron-__
ology.” The final version of the name traces based
on a review of the Oswald papers came to over 150
names; the results were furnished to .the commission
in late March 1964.

SR/CI/Research prepared for the commission at
its request a paper survey of known data on Soviet
use of assassination. This study was intended only
for background information of commission members
with the caveat that CIA as an organization did not
believe that the Kennedy assassination was a Soviet-
sponsored operation. Much of the material in the
assassination study had been published previously
within the oe

March 1964, Brasko was seeking photographs of
buildings in Minsk, USSR, where Oswald was resettled
by the Soviet Government after 1959, Brasko found
a copy of a color transparency. which showed in a

casual setting a young man who bore a remarkable

facial resemblance to Oswald and was wearing a
shirt identical in pattern and color to a shirt

- Oswald was wearing in photographs found in his ef-

fects following the Kennedy assassination. (Figure 1,
F page 77). The photograph was taken by an American
tourist in Minsk's Central Square in August 1961 at
the Palace of Culture. Copies of the photograph y
were also furnished to the FBI. The Bureau inter-
viewed the photographer and her companions who could
contribute little to their original statements when
first interviewed by Agency representatives following
their Soviet tour in 1961 (not about Oswald, however,

ments. This required explicit permission from the
DDP, and the rewriting or declassification of some
material previously submitted to the commission.

In August 1964 Warren Commission Assistant Counsel
W. David Slawson requested permission to publish
in the commission report some memorandums submitted
to the commission by SR/CI/Research via CI Staff.
Since some of the material submitted to the commis-
sion earlier was intended for background use only
or contained operational information, the reports
in question were resubmitted to the commission. in
sanitized versions modeled on the originals. The
revisions were identified as coming from CIA and
appeared primarily in textual and footnote material
