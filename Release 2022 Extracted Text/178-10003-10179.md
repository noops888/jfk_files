Dear Bill:

Forwarded herewith are comments on the draft report of
the Senate Select Committee's subcommittee on the question of
support by the intelligence agencies for the Warren Commission
inquiry. These comments have been prepared under a tight
deadline, which has limited the ability to research all the questions
raised in the draft report.

The attachments to this letter are in two sections.. The first
is a summary of considerations relating to the relationship between
CIA and AMLASH/1 prior to the assassination of President Kennedy
on 22 November 1963. The point is that the record of what was said
to AMLASH/1, and specific reporting of what he understood, makes
it clear that there were no grounds for him to believe, and he did
not believe, that he had CIA support for an assassination plot against
Castro in the period preceding President Kennedy's death, The
second attachment is an item-by~item series of comments, ranging
frorn minor editorial notations and comments, to factual. corrections

and security points.

As there is a basic Ufference between the interpretation of
facts in the draft report, and the facts as we know them, if would be
appreciated if there could be-an opportunity to address the question
with the members of the Subcommittee. It is my opinion that it would
be a disservice to the public to issue the report as now written,

Sincerely,

AMLASH Operation

The objective of the AMLASH operation throughout its
existence was the formation of a nucleus within Cuba to organize
an internal coup to replace the Castro regime. . AMLASH/J held
a position high inthe Cuban government. He was disillusioned
with the Castro regime and was considered as a possible political
action asset. The Agency had a series of meetings with him ~
during the 1961-62 period, the last of which was in August 1962
prior to his departure for Havana, He was never a fully recyuited

agent.

In September 1963 AMLASH/1 was met in Brazil, the first
time since the August 1962 meetings. During the September 1963
meeting with AMLASH/1, he said that there were two ways to
effect a coup; through an outside invasion (which he recognized
was out of the question at that time) or through an inside job!!
(i. e.- internal coup via military overthrow), He indicated that
he was waiting for a plan of action from the United States
Government. By this he meant high-level assurances of support
for a successful coup. The same cable which reported the results
of the meeting also indicated that AMLASH/1I "will always be a

control problem."

AMLASH/1 then went to Paris, France, where be was met
again. Meetings with AMLASH/1 in October 1963 consisted of
exploration as to what he might do, and xequests by him for
U.S. support. In response to his seeking high-level assurances
of U.S. support, Desmond FitzGerald met with him on
29 October 1963. The plan for that meeting is described in
writing in the file as follows:

AUVdGIT quod "Y AIwago FHL WOUs AdODOLOHA

: E "FitzGerald will represent self as personal
representative of Robert F. Kennedy who
traveled Paris for specific purpose meeting
(AMLASH/1) and giving him assurances of
full U.S. support if there is change of the if

, present government in Cuba." (Emphasis added),

A memorandum for the record of that meeting, dated
13 November 1963, contained the following summary:

"FitzGerald informed (AMILASH/4 that the
United States is prepared to render all
necessary assistance to any anti-communist
Cuban group which succeeds in neutralizing
the present Cuban leadership’ and assumes
sufficient control to invite the United States

to render the assistance it is prepared to

give. It was emphasized that the above
support will be forthcoming only after a

xeal coup has been effected and the group
involved is in a position to request U.S.
(probably under OAS auspices) recognition

and support. It was made clear that the U.S,
was not prepared to comrnit itself to support-
ing an isolated uprising, as such an uprising
can be extinguished ina matter of hours if

the present government is still. in control in
Havana. As for the post-coup period, the
U.S. does not desire that the political clock be
turned back but will support the necessary economic
and political reforms which will benefit the mass of
the Cuban people.'' (Emphasis added).

In 1967 the Inspector General of CIA conducted an investi-
gation of the AMLASH operation, and interviewed Mr. FitzGerald
and his exécutive officer (who had beea kept thoroughly familiar
with developments). FitzGerald recalied that AMLASH/1 époke of
the need for an assassination weapon, particularly a high powered
rifle with telescopic sights or some other weapon which could
be used to kill Castro froma distance, FitzGerald rebuffed
this request and instructed the case officer who served as an
interpreter to tell AMLASH/I that the U.S. simply did not do
such things. FitzGerald's executive officer, though not pre-
sent, had the same recollection. Mr. FitzGerald assured
AMLASH/I of full U.S. support "if there is a change of the
present leadership."'

The 13 November memorandum also stated that:

"Nothing of an operational nature was discussed
at the FitzGerald meeting. After the meeting
(AMLASH/1) stated that he was satisfied with
the policy discussion but now desired to know
what technical support we could provide him. ''

On 14 November 1963 a Cuban exile in New York (the source
of the original introduction to AMLASH/1) stated to a CIA case
at AMLASH/1, while: "...satisfied...2s far as policy

Government gave much equipment and money to exile groups for .

also stated: ''...if he does not get advice and material from a
U.S. Government technician, he will probably become fed-up
again and we will lose whatever progress we have made to date,"

On 19 November 1963 a CIA memorandum records FitzGerald's
ache for AMLASH/1 inside Cuba, with high-powered
During the period following 19 November,

and prior to a meeting in Paris on 22 November, 2 ballpoint pen
was rigged as a hypodermic syringe with which AMLASH/J could
administer a poison. The case officer arrived in Paris on

22 November 1963 and met with AMLASH/1 on that date. AMLASH/L
was shown the ballpoint pen device but did not accept it. He also
was told of the arms cache he would be provided.

The record is quite clear that AMLASH/1 had no grounds,
priox to 22 November 1963, to believe that he had any support
from the United States for operations involving the assassin-~
ation of Fidel Castro. In fact, he had no advance support for
a coup, however “he |might attempt it. This is emphasized by
his recorded complaints on the subject, clearly reflecting his
understanding that such was the case. Bis complaint on 14
November 1963, as reported through an intermediary, may have
led to the decision on 19 Novernber 1963 to provide him with

approval of a c

token support that he could interpret as the support he had
been requesting unsuccessfully. That decision was taken

19 November 1963 inside CIA Headquarters by FitzGerald and
formalized by a mernorandum written the same date.

Prior to 22 November 1963 CIA had refused to give
AMLASH/1 any support prior to a successful coup in Cuba.
That he recognized that this specifically included a refusal to
participate in the assassination of Castro is reflected in the
description of a July 1964 report by the FBI, quoted in the SSC
Subcommittee draft, in which AMLASH/1 stated that Robert F.
Kennedy had refused support for the assassination of Castro.
As the 29 October meeting with FitzGerald is the one at which
he understood he was meeting with a representative of Robert F.
Kennedy, it confirms the description in the 1967 IG Report.

Whatever the relationship with AMLASH/1 after 22 November,
the evidence is unequivocal that AMLASH/1 had no grounds prior
to that for believing that he had CIA support for his vaguely defined
course of action. He knew nothing that, had it leaked, would have
served to motivate a Cuban retaliatory strike against President

Kennedy.

Finally, it is significant that the transcripts of AMLASH/I's
1966 trial contain no reference to his activities prior to 1964; i.e.,
before. President Kennedy's assassination. The transcripts suggest
that, to the Cubans’ knowledge, AMLASH/1 was not in touch with CIA,
before November 1964. Nor did the book which Castro provided to
Senator McGovern in 1975, which purported to be an inventory of all
known plots against Castro's life, contain any allegation of AMILASH/1.
anti-Castro activity prior to late 1964, The book mentions travel by
AMLASH/1 to Madrid "where he was recruited by CIA agents.'' This
travel occurred in November 1964, The above two instances strongly
suggest that Castro was not aware that AMI.ASH/1 had any contact
with CIA prior to November 1964; i.e., one year after President
Kennedy's death.

The reported AMLASH/1 notoriety in the Miami Cuban exile
community did not occur prior to President Kennedy's death, This
developed after the 1966 trial and to some degree after AMLASH/1
met with Cuban exile leaders in Madrid in late 1964 and early 1965.
This was after AMLASH/1 was informed in 1964 that the U.S,
Government had severed its relationship with him.

The most recent information available indicates that AMILLASH/1
is still in jail, where he is serving a thirty yeas sentence.

employees, but it is not a term ordinarily applied
‘to CIA staff employees.

Page 7. 2nd complete paragraph, 2d line. The phrase
"backed by CIA, '' in describing the Bay of Pigs
operation, is imprecise. CIA was the government
instrument for conducting the operation, but there
was considerable other participation in what was
an operation "backed" by the U.S. government,

Page 8. The statement that the FBI knew about these plots
by at least May 1962 needs some elaboration. |

These plots (assassination) did not involve AMLASH/1
at that time, and what the FBI knew may have been
about aspects of contacts,the nature of which it did
not know. (Need this be reconciled with the state-
ment at page 12 giving the date of FBI's learning

says", . . within weeks of this meeting CIA escalated
the level of its covert operations, telling AMLASH
the United States supported his plan."

This misrepresents what AMLASH/1 was told
at the 2g October 1963 meeting, which was that
he would receive no support unless he was

_ successful in a coup of his own. There is no
planning relationship between the inconclusive
status of the understanding with AMLASH/1 and
what was going on under MONGOOSE.

"Oswald contacted a known KGB agent" with the Soviet
Embassy in Mexico. While it is known that Oswald
contacted the Vice Consul at the Soviet Embassy in
Mexico City, it is believed that it was for the purpose

of obtaining a visa for the Soviet Union. The fact that
the Vice Consul happened to be a KGB officer complicates
the matter but there is no evidence that Oswald knew *
this Soviet was KGB. Therefore, recozmend this
sentence be modified accordingly.

“Hoover and other senior officials first learned of
plots to assassinate Castro in July 1964," Did they?

‘Moreover, there is evidence that CIA's investigators
made requests for files which should have given
knowledge of the AMLASH operation, but for some
reason they did not acquire that knowledge. '"'

A quick review of CI Staff files, in the time |
available for this review, disclose no requests
that, of themselves, would produce information ,
on the AMLASH operation. :

The draft report raises the question of what was
furnished investigators, which raises the question of
what was requested, by whom? (See comsnent on item

on page 14).

Of course, the reference to especial relevance
of the AMLASH operation in this context jg
questioned,

Draft report states that President Kennedy did "admit
that the Bay of Pigs invasion was in fact an operation
sponsored by the CIA," Our impression was that he
accepted this responsibility as. his, for a government
Program. How and in what forum was the stated

Speaking of renewal of contact with AMLASH/1 the
draft says", .°. the exact purpose the CIA had for
renewing, contact is not known, but there is no evidence
that CLA intended at this time to use AMLASH in an
assassination operation,

When AMLASH care out of Cuba in September
1963, it was the first chance since August 1962
to see him. Recontact needed no mysterious
"exact purpose." It is correct to state that
there was"no evidence’ of intent to use him as an
assassination operation; rather, the circum.
stances that followed Suggest just the opposite,

Footnote: The case officer did not Say, as atated

in the draft, that the basis for meeting with AMLASH
was the belief of AMLASH that the first step of any
Coup was assassination. While AMLASH's views were
known, as shown by the evidence his views were
rejected at least during the critical period,

The opinion expressed in the draft report, in relation
to the Harker interview, about "AMLASH not being

a terrorist, ''is correct. Should it be reconciled
with statements on Page 8?

The report also says, here, "none of this othe
activity would seem to warrant. Castro's associating
that activity with U.S. leaders to the extent that he
would threaten the safety of American leaders aiding
the plans." We note without exception,

Footnote *, The Cuban Coordinating Committee was

a group for coordinating implementation of established
programs. By memorandum of 22 May 1963, McGeorge
Bundy, Special Assistant to President Kennedy for
National Security Affairs, designated the State Depart-
ment Coordinator of Cuban Affairs as Chairman of the
Interdepartmental Committee on Cuba with the specific
responsibility for the coordination of day~to-day actions
regarding Cuba, Membership of the Committee con-
sisted of representatives from State, USIA, DeD, CIA,
Justice, Treasury and ad hoc representatives as
necessary.

Footnote **, This seems to indicate that the PBI

(a new date?) and that this led to termination of the
AMLASH operation. Of course, that happened much
later. .

"Special Affairs Staff" should read "Special Activities
Staff."

SASICI should read SAS/CI,

Testimony of Karamessines is quoted, in which he is
asked a hypothetical question about use of AMLASH,

and that he answered hypothetically, but the presentation,

seems to treat it as fact.

Reference to CIA "technical" collection capability in
Mexico City should be deleted. Simply delete the
word "'technical.'' This small point is a sources-
and-methods question.

The draft report states that an overseas Station
raised a question of AMLASH security. This is

taken out of context. Consideration had been given

to the possibility of using AMLASH/I in the recruit
ment of a prospective agent in another European
country. This prospective agent frequently traveled
to Soviet Bloc countries and recently had returned.
The cable noted that the prospective agent appeared
less recruitable since his return and the Station felt
that the use of AMLASH to recruit the agent might
pose a serious threat to AMLASH's personal. security.
It did not, in any manner, reflect on the security of the
AMLASH operation. ‘

The 8 December 1963 cable from JMWAVEE wae in
reply to two cables sent from Headquarters on

7 December 1963 which clarified the reason fox the
delay in laying down the cache. AMLASH had been
assured that he would be given time to re-establish
his normal pattern and assess the atmosphere and
feelings among his contacts. He was also told that
there would be no activity until January 1964, Further,
the Standing Group was to meet on 10 December 1963
to discuss US policy toward Cuba and Latin America,
If the Standing Group decided to recommend a change
in then current policy toward Cuba the conduct of
operations that might be counter to any recommended
change in US policy objectives should not be under way.

Did the FBI learn the "details" of the AMLASH operation
in July 1964? They learned of AMLASH's unhappiness
with his failure to get what he asked, but what else did
they learn beyond the fact of the relationship?

It seems interesting that this fabrication, which
proved to be an untrue report, receives so much.
attention in the report, It really becamie a non~-
story, although time was required to “check it out.

The FBI was not denied access to "D'". As the basis
for the statement is not known, it is not known in what
context the understanding developed. The Mexicans
did make "D" available for interrogation, at which the

FBI was present.

The draft report states that Cl Staff was not "affiliated
with CIA's Cuban affairs staff,'! although later in the
piece it refers to SAS' CI people coordinating with

CI Staff. These appear contradictory statements.

Re the case of a man crossing the Mexican border
on 23 November then flying to Cuba, This case was
investigated and pertained to Gilbert Lopez, a U.S.
citizen who had secured a fifteen day Mexican tourist
card at Tampa, Florida, on 20 November 1963. He
entered Mexico on this document at Neuvo Laredo on
23 November 1963. He checked into the Roosevelt
Hotel on 25 November 1963. On 27 November he
checked out of the hotel and departed for Havana
aboard a regularly scheduled Cubana Flight #465.
He had a courtesy visa to visit Cuba. This was a
scheduled international flight and he happened to

be, according to the manifest, the only passenger.

It is requested that CIA support for DRE, JURE
and the 30th November Movement groups he altered
to a generic description of anti-Castro groups.
Persons identified with them in some circles could
suffer from official confirmation of the connection.
This is still considered as classified. It is noted
that CIA did not have an operational interest in
SNFE or Alpha 66.

The Agency effort to obtain FPCC stationery
through a penetration for use in a deception

operation is still classified since it involves
sources and methods.

That the SAS Executive Officer views the AMLASH
operation as having been an assassination plot is
not very helpful, unless the time sequence and
evolution of the relationship with AMLASH/I is
made a part of that view. His account in 1967
supported FitzGerald's story of what happened
in the 29 October 1963 meeting.

That SAS/CI speaks broadly may not be all. that
helpful either, if the extent of his knowledge,
and when he knew what he says he knew, is
fixed in time. That he wrote a memorandusn. in
1965 on the security of the operation, does not
, qualify him to address where things stood in.
1963. In fact, he is quoted at page 139 as saying
that he could not recall the time frame.

The draft report states that in October 1963 the
FBI knew of the "assassination aspect of the
AMLASH" operation. As is noted earlier,
there was no such characterization that applied
to it then, so how it could have known is subject
to question.

References to IN and OUT numbers, or DIR numbers, and to
