Subject: W.L.OLTMANS (10 June 1925)

On 29 December 1971 OLTMANG invited the Cultural Attache of the
Russian Imbassy KUZNETSOV for an evening in his house. The invit-
ation was also for some other members of the Russian Representation.
At .the same time OLTMANS was to invite some six important journalists: |
KUZNETSOV should ask OPALEV and IZWEKOV to come along with him.

The date agreed’on originally was 11 January 1972.°It then was
changed twice. When 14 January also wasn't suitable, it was agreed

on 7 January to make the date for 18 January 1972 at 20.00 hrs.

From the invitation it could only be intered that ULIMANS wanted

to offer his guests an opportunity for an informal discussion.

About the background of the present good relations of OLTMANS with
the Soviet Representation in The Netherlands, section. Bis able to
report the following:

ods, (This information comes from vulnerable source - OPPERBAAS. )

1. In September 1970 OLTMANS says with some surprise that ‘he sudden-
ly received an invitation to a party:at the Russian Embassy.
He thinks it crazy; he doesn't belong to that club at all. But
his thinking is along the lines of those people.

2. In.October 1970 OLTMANS appears to be interested in an interview
with KOSYGIN's son-in-law GVISHIANI who allegedly was connected
with American-Russian discussions about forming a mutual "think-
ing factory".

Presumably this had some connection with the so called Club of

Rome in which GVISHIANI plays a role.

Remark: GVISHIANI is chairman of the state committee for science
and technology and is suspected to be a highly placed
Intelligence Officer.

3. Begining March 1970 OLTMANS contacted the Press Attache OPALEV
from the Russian Embassy; OLTMANS would still like to have an
interview with GVISHIANI,

It would be a filmed interview in which OLTMANS would cooperate
with the NOS. (TV). }

In this period OPALEV's cooperation does not .yet seem very
extensive.

4, Thanks to the cooperation of Aurelio PECCEI, chairman of the
Club of Rome, OLTMANS at the end of April 1971 succeeded in get-
ting in contact with GVISHIANI in Paris. .
Also present at this discussion was the former member of the Russi
Embassy FEDEROVSKY, now chief of protocol of the state committee
for science dnd technology.

2.

At this’ opportunity GVISHIANI immediately anvited OLTMANS for a
visit to Moscow.

FEDEROVSKY was instructed to inform the Russian Enbassy in The
Yague about it:

GVISHIANI who ‘at the same time is chairman of the ‘commission for
environment administration in the Soviet Union, asked OLTMANS to
make a film at. the same time about the environment administration
in the Soviet Union to support the international environment
conference to be held this year, 7 F

Begining May it becomes: clear that since OLTMANS!;,discussion with
GVISHIANI,. OPALEV's attitude towards OLTMANS has greatly -changed.
OPALEV is now all- willingness.

in May OLTMANS makes his film with GVISHIANI “and | recéives an inv-
atation: to’ come to the Soviet Union for the second half of August
and the whole of September, where he covld ce) ten pane es
institutes.

GVISHIANI.told OLTMANS that he had complete trust in him.

In June 1971 OLTMANS again contacted CVISHTIANI, this: time in
Vienna, where there was a meeting of the Club of. Rome.

j '
Begining. October 1971 OLTMANS again saw GVISHIANI in Paris, where,
among other things he spoke to. him about his visit to The Netherlan
in the second week of October. °
OLTNANS did his begt to oblige GVISHIANI while visiting The Neth-
erlands by trying to establish business relations for him (for
instance with Philips). B

receweel : :
In November 1971 OLTMANS, from the Russian state television an
offer for a- five year contract to make exclusive films in the
Soviet Union.
This offer was: made. to. OLTMANS during his visit to the Soviet
Union. It is concretization of the earlier offer by GVISHIANI to
film a number,of scientific institutes in the Soviet. Union.
On. 17 November OLTNANS aliegediy discussed this business further
with GVISHIANI in Geneva.

On 23 January 1972 OLTMANS will'make another visit to Moscow to
discuss making the above mentioned films without the participation
of the NOS. At this opportunity OLTMANS will leave behind a memo
about: LUNS in connection with OLTMANS' present agitation against
the Secretary-General of NATO.

OLTMANS wants to prevent LUNS getting any future opportunity to
visit Moscow.

Referring to the meeting in OLTMANS' house on 18 January 1972 it
can be reported that on 17 January 1972 OLTMANS stated that he
is again seeking reaction from the Russians who will visit him on
18 January; their reaction in connection with OLTMANS' request

to the general prosecutor of the High connec to bring action
against LUNS.

it,

3.

In the morning on: 18 January OLTMANS also stated that KUZNETSOV
-said that: OLTMANS! action against: LUNS will not succeed because

the "bosses". stand. behind LUNS.
It is not*clear. when KUZNETSOV said this “to: OLTMANS, but it is

“known that. OLTNANS recently attended.a meeting where a number

of Russians'were.present. 5
(Possibly the meeting of the Association Nederland-USsR# with
the delegation “from "USSR-Nederland? on 14 January 1972. )

On“19 January 1972 it was reported that HOFLAND: (one of the guest:
invited’ to ‘the: evening in OLTMANS' house) calléd’ before his
arrival.and-asked whether he could bring a’ friend.

Afterwards this friend appeared.to be Peter ZONNEVELD from De

Telegraaf.'
OLTMANS. ‘said ‘that at the press conferenée which. he (OLTMANS )
will.give-on 20 January 1972 several guests, Nilo.ANSTADT, Rob \.>

= KOPULT and Jaap JANSEN will defend OLTMANS against el) attack on

him in”. "De ) Retepraat™ of this morning.
