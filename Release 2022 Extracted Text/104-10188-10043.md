i 2 urficers am che aciual coitacis with AMSTRUT-2 plus the progress
ofthe AMSTRUT operation, The value of LIFEAT providing an unilateral check
on the activities of AMSIRUT-2 and her relazives during critical periods of the
AMSTRUT operatio’ cannot be over emphasized, Copies of the daily take from
the two lines covered-sy LIFEAT for the AMSTRUT operation are forwarded

1) The installation of new municipal lighting for many areas in Mexico

City noted in referénce continued during January 1963, but at a reduced scale,
Some areas covered by LIFEAT basehouses are now free of the installation
crews, -

ti) Due to the circumstaaces under witch most of the LIFEAT basehouse
keepers were originaily recruited or shifted from other projects to emp!o,ment
in LIFEAT (in mosticases at least tea years ago) they are either aware or have
reason to suspect that they are now, or at one time were, employed sy KUBARK
working out of the local ODACID installation, LIFEAT outside principal agent,
De vid M, WILSTED, (at Siation direction) is making a major ard continuing effort
to orient the LIFEAT personnel toward the idea that there is 10 presen: contact
with the ODACID insiallation, that WELSTED and Ws m2 C, DRABAND (under alias)
are solely responsible for :he operation and that they report directly to “Head-
quartecs” in PBPRIME, When and if necessary for the Station Case Officer in
charge of LIFEAT to meet any of the local agents under LIFEAT, it is uader alias,
If protracted meecings of this type Deco;n2 xecessary a cover story will be devel-
oped for the Case Officer's continued presence in Mexico, ,,such as “tourist”
status or commercial employment with an uanamed PBPRIME firm doing b:

, COVERAGE

noith of January 1993 LIFEAT provided unilateral coverage on a total

During che
lines. Coverage by target was as follows:

of 13 targes

1, Aleksandr G, SIDOROV
2. and 3, Polish Embassy
4. 5. and 6, Yugoslav Embassy
?, and 8. AMSCRUT Operailon 7
9, Juan Jose AREVAi.O Bermejo
10, Sergio BELTRAN Lepez
11, . Home of a Czech Intelligence Officer
12, Francisco WALTZ Olivera
13, Albert MALTZ

_ G, PERSONNEL

David M, WILSTED eturned from home leave oa 1 February 1963 and assumed full
Fesponsibilities as LIFEAT outside Case Officer, Wayne C, DRABAND and
LIEMERACE-S who Subszituted for WILSTED in the LIFEAT operational and techni-
cal phases respectively during WILSTED's absence are to be commended for theit
maintaining LIFEAT at the high level of effictency and security normally enjoyed
by the operation, DRABAND's performance was the subject of separate correspon-
dence (see HMMT-3469),

As presently projected, Wayne C, DRABAND will be leaving Mexico on or about 1
November 1963, The responsible Station Case Officer and WILSTED are attempting
to resolve the problem of a replacement for DRABAND a: the local level, primarily
from the pool of agents already employed under the project, This would have the
advantage of not further disseminating the fact that LIFEAT does exist, but would
have the serious drawback of giving knowledge of the whole operation (t,e, all
basehouses) to another Mexican national, (Note: At present LIFEUD-2 and
LIFEUD-3, the two linemen who now coaneci the tap lines to :he basehouses, are
the only Mexican nat tonals who know of the location of all LIFEAT basehouses, )

The Station does not desire another staff employee <o fill this position, but would
prefer a 'J,S. citizen, technically competent, with sone working knowledge of Span-
ish or ability to acquire a working knowledge of Spanish, Since working papers are
extremely difficult to obtain at present, for-cover purposes anyone coming into
Mexico to fill the LIFEAT position would probably have to come as a retired person
with a guaranteed income, It is hough: that perhaps an individual reciring from une
of the Armed Forces in a technical rating might have the best possibilities of filling
all the requirements noted,

Although the Station will continue to explore all possible solutions to the problem,
it is reque: that Headquarters’ views and, if possible. assistance be givea the
Scation in :his matter,

2, During the reporting period a number of memoranda were prepared by
the Station for passing to local ODACID and ODENVY based in whole or in pari on
LUFEAT provided material, The-following HMMs were provided as a by-product
of the LIFEAT Operation:

HMM-6993 HMM - 709.
HMM-7OLE ohn HMM-70 48"
