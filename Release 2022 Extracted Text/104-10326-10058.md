THE CUBAN



oS SECRET
i E INTEL
SS, JIC CURRENT (CORRI CIVICA CUBANA -
ccc), WAS HUMAN RIGHTS~AND—DISS£DENT———~———__,
MOVEMENTS HAD ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF CUBAN SECURITY, PRIMARILY
THE MINISTRY OF INTERIOR (MININT), AND THEY BELIEVED THAT MININT
WAS TRYING TO PENETRATE DISSIDENT ORGANIZATIONS. CCC MEMBERS
CONCERNED OVER THE GROUP’S SECURITY TAGGED FOUR INDIVIDUALS WHO
EXHIBITED BEHAVIOR OR ACTIVITIES IN THE HUMAN RIGHTS OR DISSIDENT
ORGANIZATIONS THAT SUGGESTED THAT THEY WERE ASSOCIATED WITH

HININT. THE INDIVIDUALS WERE JORGE ((GONZALES)), VLADIMIRO
{ (ROCA)} ATUNEZ, GUILLERMO ((FERNANDEZ)) DONATES, AND RAFAEL
( (ALCIDES) }

2. THE CCC LEADERSHIP WAS VIRTUALLY CERTAIN THAT JORGE
GONZALEZ, OF THE CHRISTIAN LIBERATION MOVEMENT (MOVIMIENTO
RISTIANO LIBERACION), HEADED BY OSVALDO ((PAYA)) SARDINAS, WAS A
(fUBAN SECURITY PENETRATION. DIRECTORS OF THE CCC NOTED THAT HIS
QUESTIONS WERE USUALLY SO PENETRATING AS TO SUGGEST INSIDE
KNOWLEDGE. A TRUSTED MEMBER OF THE CCC WAS DIRECTED AGAINST
GONZALEZ, PROVIDING HIM WITH MOSTLY BOGUS INFORMATION KNOWN ONLY
TO THE CCC MEMBER AND THE CCC LEADERSHIP. RECORDS OF THE DATE THE
[INFORMATION WAS PASSED WERE KEPT BY THE CCC. THE INFORMATION
ATER SURFACED THROUGH MININT DURING THE COURSE OF MININT
INTERVIEWS OF DETAINED CCC LEADERS. THE CCC LEADERSHIP BELIEVED
THAT GONZALEZ MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN VENEZUELA AS OF MID AUGUST 1995.

3.  VLADIMIRO ROCA OF THE CUBAN DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST
GURRENT (CORRIENTE SOCIALISTA DEMOCRATICA CUBANA), WHO IS ONE OF
tHE CLOSEST ASSOCIATES OF ELIZARDO ((SANCHEZ)) SANTACRUZ OF THE
GUBAN COMMISSION FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND NATIONAL RECONCILIATION
ICOMISION CUBANA DE DERECHOS HUMANOS Y RECONCILIACION NACIONAL),
GAME UNDER CCC SUSPICION AFTER AN INCIDENT IN 1992. IN THAT YEAR,
SHORTLY AFTER THE LETTER BY CUBAN PROFESSIONALS TO THE IBERIAN
BMERICAN SUMMIT WAS PRESENTED, CCC CHIEF ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
VLADIMIR ((MARTINEZ-AMORES)) ALVAREZ WAS VISITED AT HIS HOME BY
GWO MININT OFFICERS. THE TWO OFFICERS WERE NAMED "MARCIAL" AND
DANIEL." THE SENIOR OF THE TWO, DANIEL, REMARKED THAT BLIZARDO
SANCHEZ WAS A U.S. INTELLIGENCE AGENT IN DUE COURSE THIS
TNFORMATION WAS PASSED BY MARTINEZ-AMORES TO SANCHEZ IN THE if
PRESENCE OF VLADIMIRO ROCA AROUND DECEMBER 1992, DURING AN
| INTERVIEW" BY MININT OF A CCC MEMBER, MARCIAL MADE A STATEMENT
(THAT INDICATED THAT HE KNEW THAT HIS INITIAL REMARKS TO
MARTINEZ-AMORES ABOUT SANCHEZ HAD BEEN PASSED TO SANCHEZ. WHEN IT
WAS REPORTED TO SANCHEZ THAT MININT HAD MADE THIS STATEMENT, HE
ATTRIBUTED IT TO TECHNICAL COVERAGE IN HIS HOME ASSOCIATED WITH AN
LP OPPOSITE HIS HOME. THE CCC WAS NOT CONVINCED BY THIS
EXPLANATION AND THEREAFTER KEPT ROCA AT A DISTANCE, AS THEY
ASSUMED THAT IT WAS ROCA WHO HAD PASSED THE INFORMATION TO THE
MININT. (SOURCE COMMENT: ONLY ROCA, SANCHEZ AND MARTINEZ-AMORES H
XNEW THAT SANCHEZ HAD BEEN TOLD, AND BOTH SANCHEZ AND
MARTINEZ-AMORES WERE TRUSTED MEMBERS OF THE CCC.)

HT_OF THE FOLLOWING INCIDENTS:

A VISA TO THE U.S.
GROUNDS—FOR-DENTAL-WERE-THAT-DIAZ-HAD1 NOT-SUBMITTED-SUFFI
EVIDENCE TO JUSTIFY THE VISA. ROCA WAS HEARD TO TELL DIAZ THAT
HIS REQUEST HAD BEEN UNDERMINED BY FELIX ((BONNE)) CARCASSES, THE
‘eee LEADER. BONNE DENIED THIS ACTION, SAYING THAT HE WOULD HAVE
HAD NO INTEREST IN UNDERMINING DIAZ.

B. IN EARLY 1993, JORGE GONZALEZ, A CLOSE FRIEND OF
ROCA, INFORMED THE CCC LEADERSHIP THAT AN AUTHORESS, IDENTIFIED AS
MARIANA ((BADELL)) (PHONETIC), WAS PREPARING A BIOGRAPHY OF CUBAN
PRESIDENT FIDEL ((CASTRO)) AND WANTED TO MEET BONNE. THE REASON
FOR SUCH A MEETING IN CONNECTION WITH A BIOGRAPHY OF CASTRO WAS
NOT CLEAR, BUT THE MEETING TOOK PLACE IN GONZALEZ’ HOME, AND
INCLUDED BADELL, BONNE, AND MARTINEZ-AMORES. THE CCC LEADERS
NOTED THAT BADELL APPEARED TO BE UNCOMFORTABLE DURING THE COURSE
OF THE MEETING. SHE STATED THAT SHE HAD HAD LUNCH WITH AN \
OFFICIAL OF THE SPANISH EMBASSY IN HAVANA, WHO WAS ASSISTING HER
WITH THE BIOGRAPHY OF CASTRO BY PUTTING HER IN TOUCH WITH ONE
CARLOS ALBERTO ((MONTANER)) IN MADRID, WHO WOULD EDIT THE BOOK.
SHE DECLINED TO IDENTIFY THE SPANISH OFFICAL, BUT DESCRIBED HIM IN
SUCH DETAIL THAT BOTH BONNE AND MARTINEZ-AMORES RECOGNIZED HIM AS
JORGE ((DE ORUETA)}, A LONG-TIME CONTACT OF THE CCC. WHEN THE
CONVERSATION WAS RELAYED TO DE ORUETA BY THE CCC, HE RECALLED
BADELL HAD BEEN INTRODUCED TO HIM BY VLADIMIRO ROCA’S WIFE. HE
FURTHER RECALLED THE LUNCH AND MENTION OF THE BOOK, BUT DECLARED
THE MONTANER INFORMATION TO BE SPURIOUS. THIS SEQUENCE OF EVENTS
SUGGESTED TO CCC SECURITY PERSONNEL THAT THERE WAS COORDINATION
AMONG INDIVIDUALS SUSPECTED OF BEING DIRECTED BY CUBAN SECURITY

Cc. IN 1993 A GROUP OF DISSIDENTS, INCLUDING BONNE, WAS
ZNVITED TO THE HOME OF PIOTR ((MIKISKA)) (PHONETIC), FIRST
SECRETARY AT THE CZECH EMBASSY, TO ATTEND A VISIT FROM THE CZECH
| VICE CHANCELLOR. (SOURCE COMMENT: THIS KIND OF CONTACT WAS
ANATHEMA TO THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT.) THE CZECH INVITATION TO BONNE
WAS SENT THREE DAYS IN ADVANCE BY WORD OF MOUTH VIA ROCA. BY
t GOINCIDENCE, ANOTHER CCC REPRESENTATIVE VISITING MIKISKA WITHIN A
Hl DAY OR TWO OF WHEN THE INVITATION WAS RELAYED TO ROCA WAS ASKED
ABOUT THE INVITATION TO BONNE, AS BONNE HAD NOT RESPONDED TO THE
l GZECH EMBASSY. THE CCC REPRESENTATIVE INCLUDED THE QUERY
{ REGARDING THE INVITATION IN HIS REPORT OF THE MEETING TO THE ccc,
) GIVING BONNE HIS FIRST NOTIFICATION THAT THERE HAD EVEN BEEN AN
; 4NVITATION. ROCA FINALLY PASSED THE MESSAGE TO THE HOME OF
GEORGINA DE LAS MERCEDES ((GONZALEZ)) CORBO, ONE OF BONNE’S CHIBF
ASSISTANTS, TWO HOURS PRIOR TO THE BEGINNING OF THE FUNCTION.

D. IN MID 1995, REINALDO ((ROQUE)) MALHERBE OF CCC
REPORTED THAT VLADIMIRO ROCA’S WIFE WAS UNDERMINING ELIZARDO
SANCHEZ BY PASSING AROUND STORIES THAT HE HAD BEEN WITHHOLDING
ORGANIZATIONAL FUNDS, INTENDED FOR THE SOCIALIST CURRENT, FOR HIS
PERSONAL USE. (SOURCE COMMENT: THIS RUMOR CAMPAIGN MAY HAVE
*CONTRIBUTED TO SANCHEZ’ REPORTED RESIGNATION FROM THE<EXECUTIVE
COMMITTEE OF THE SOCIALIST CURRENT.)

5 ILLERMO FERNANDEZ DONATES IS A CIVIL ENGINEER WHO WAS
1O-GUSTAVO~ (MARCOS) )~ BERGNES~ OF ~THE~CUBAN-COMMLETTEE-FOR————_,
HUMAN RIGHTS (COMITE CUBANO PRO DERECHOS HUMANOS). HE WAS
SUSPECTED OF BEING A MININT SOURCE AND A PROVOCATEUR BY THE ccc
LEADERSHIP, HE JOINED THE CCC ON THE RECOMMENDATION OF ARCOS
BHCAUSE FERNANDEZ WAS A MEMBER OF THE PROFESSIONAL CLASS. (SOURCE
COMMENT: MANY MEMBERS OP THE CCC ARE PROFESSIONALS.) THE CCC
INITIALLY BECAME SUSPICIOUS OF FERNANDEZ BECAUSE HE HAD A HISTORY
OF ARRESTS IN WHICH HE WOULD BE PLACED WITH VARIOUS GROUPS OF
POLITICAL PRISONERS. IN PRISON HE WOULD EVENTUALLY HAVE A FIGHT
WITH A GUARD OR COMMIT AN INFRACTION OF REGULATIONS AND BE REMOVED
BY|THE AUTHORITIES FOR DISCIPLINARY ACTION. EACH TIME HE EMERGED
FROM PRISON HE SEEMED TO BE IN EXCELLENT HEALTH AND WELL FED.

6. ADDITIONALLY, SEVERAL OTHER ANOMALIES HAVE CAUSED THE
CCC) LEADERSHIP TO BE SUSPICIOUS OF FERNANDEZ:

A. ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, FERNANDEZ HAS BEEN ASKED BY
THE} CCC TO COMMUNICATE ITEMS OF MUTUAL INTEREST TO ARCOS.
SUBSEQUENT ELICITATION OF ARCOS BY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE CCC LED
THEM TO BELIEVE THAT INFORMATION PROVIDED BY FERNANDEZ TO ARCOS
was| OFTEN GROSSLY INACCURATE. WHEN APPRISED OF THIS SITUATION,
ARGOS DISMISSED CCC COMMENTS AS BEING SIMPLE MISUNDERSTANDINGS..

B. IT HAS BEEN NOTED BY THE CCC LEADERSHIP THAT
PERNANDEZ WAS FRIENDLY WITH JORGE GONZALEZ AND WITH VLADIMIRO
ROCA. FERNANDEZ WAS PRIVY TO THE ACTIVITIES PLANNED BY SOCTALIST
CWRRENT, THE GROUP TO WHICH ROCA BELONGED, BY HIS ASSOCIATION WITH
ROCA. REINALDO ROQUE, A MEMBER OF THE CCC, WHO WORKED WITH
SOCIALIST CURRENT, NOTED THAT WHEN THE GROUP WAS SCHEDULED TO
MEET, IT WAS CHALLENGED BY CUBAN AUTHORITIES SO OFTEN THAT THE
AUTHORITIES MUST HAVE BEEN APPRISED OF ITS SCHEDULE. EITHER
FERNANDEZ OR ROCA (OR BOTH) COULD HAVE BEEN PASSING SUCH
INFORMATION TO THE AUTHORITIES.

C. ON ONE OCCASION, TO THE SURPRISE OF THE CCC,
GERNANDEZ, A KARATE PRACTITIONER, INVITED THE ENTIRE CCC
MEMBERSHIP TO GO TO THE CIUDAD DEPORTIVA (SPORTS CITY) TO AN
EXERCISE FIELD TO WORK OUT. CCC SECURITY PERSONNEL NOTED THAT
THIS WOULD HAVE ASSEMBLED ALL OR MOST OF THE CCC MEMBERSHIP IN
HAVANA IN AN OPEN AREA WHERE IT COULD BE OBSERVED AND
PHOTOGRAPHED. THE INVITATION, COMING AS IT DID AS A ONE-TIME
OPPORTUNITY WITH NO PRECEDENT, FUELED SUSPICIONS WITHIN THE ccc
Ane THE INVITATION WAS DECLINED.

¢ CUBAN POET AND FIRST HUSBAND OF TERESA -|_MARDONES_(a.

EMBER-OF“THE CCC), WAS SIGNIFICANT TO THE CCC BECAUSE IT CALLED
{NTO QUESTION WHERE ALCIDES’ LOYALTIES LAY. ALCIDES AND FERNANDEZ
HAD ONE CHILD, A SON, TOGETHER BEFORE THEY WERE DIVORCED AROUND
ATE 1993. FERNANDEZ HAD REMARRIED AND WAS LIVING WITH RONALDO
{(ROQUE)} (COUSIN OF REINALDO ROQUE), AND ALCIDES WAS SPENDING
CONSIDERABLE TIME AT THE ROQUE RESIDENCE, PRESUMABLY TO BE WITH
HIS SON. THE CCC BECAME CONCERNED WITH THE SECURITY OF THE

MARTINEZ-AMORES WAS DISPATCHED BY THE CCC TO FEEL OUT ALCIDES, AND
REPORTED THAT HE SPOKE COHERENTLY AND LOGICALLY AGAINST THE
(URRENT REGIME. MARTINEZ-AMORES APPEARED TO BE REASSURED.
SUBSEQUENTLY HOWEVER, IN CONVERSATION WITH ALCIDES, REINALDO ROQUE
LEARNED THAT ALCIDES WAS PART OF A DELEGATION OF THE CUBAN
NATIONAL UNION OF WRITERS AND ARTISTS (UNION NACIONAL DE
SSCRITORES Y ARTISTAS DE CUBA - UNEAC) THAT VISITED MADRID
SOMETIME AROUND 1994. WHILE THERE, ALCIDES SAID THAT HE WAS
INVITED WITH A NUMBER OF OTHER UNEAC DELEGATES TO LUNCH WITH
CARLOS ALBERTO MONTANER. (SOURCE COMMENT: THE LUNCHEON WITH
MONTANER MUST CERTAINLY HAVE RECEIVED CUBAN GOVERNMENT APPROVAL,
AND THE GROUP MUST HAVE INCLUDED CUBAN SECURITY PERSONNEL. )
|ALCIDES TOLD ROQUE THAT ON HIS RETURN TO CUBA, HE ATTENDED THE
FUNERAL FOR A SISTER (NFI) OF FIDEL CASTRO AND DELIVERED THE
FUNERAL ORATION. FOLLOWING THE FUNERAL, HE WAS OBSERVED TO BE
