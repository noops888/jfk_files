SECTION M-A

ANALYSIS ABOUT THE POLITICAL. INFORMATION WORK:

BACKGROUND:

The M-A task presents some deficiencies. undoubtedly a

product of the minimum exploitation

of its

informative resources

and to the lack of orientation

with regard to the information

that is needed.

An analysis of each follows.

a) MEXICO

The lack of information about MEXICO and events taking

place there is really alarminformation about the internal

Concretely we can point out

that we do not receive any

political situation of Mexico.

This deficioncy can be casily overcome if attention is

of the country, at the necessary

level, it appears, to obtain this type of information.

With regard to the relations with Mexico or the official

policy of the country, "e can point out that although the 1n-

formation received 1s larger in volume, this work 1s not ex-

plusting the incormation racilities.

Besides, in the first as will as the second case, the

sources available to the Center are not known in the Informa-

We can dedio the intormation capabilities by

analyzing circles or individuals from whom the

obtained.

However, we dun't know what the relations are be-

tween the Center and these informants,

therefore we cannot

zuide the information collection effort.

b) CENTRAL AMERICA

The information with regard to this region is still

worse than in respect to MEXICO. As far as political in-

formation is concerned, we note

the absence of sources

of information and of concrete information about current

matters.

Information about the pulitical life of these countries

1s almost nil, especially with regard to current matters.

In-

formation about political matters

is frequently received from

this region, but almost always they refer to reports from a

specifie

source about his

own party or about disagreements,

very bencralived, with other leftist forces.

lately, for the last three or four months (actually

since early September), a decrease in the total volume of in-

formation received has been observed, especially with regard

to Intolligence information about the national liberation

movement in Central America.

With regard to other matters

(political life, relations

with Cuba, solidarity, etc.) the

fact is that we have received information, although very

limited.

C) THE CARIBBEAN

With respect to Santo Domingo and Haiti, we can say

that the job in these two countrios

is nil, as far as the

collection of intormation is concerned.

We have only received from Haiti, since the month of

May, two or three information reports of limited value and

they were received through M-N.

With regard to Santo Domingo the situation is very

similar.

Althougn some information reports have been re-

ceived,

they come fron public (overt) sources (newspapers

from progressive organizations, manifests, newspaper clip-

pings, ete.) and occasionally

political reports about

current events and the way of struggle in the country,

drafted

by it member

of a progressive organization.

NEEDS:

a) MEXICO

Given the importance uf the situation in Mexico, for

Cuba,

basteally because it is an important way of contact with

Latin America, it Is NECESSARY to reinforce our job as far as

1t5 RELATIONS NITH CUBA 15 cóncerned.

This means that we are

Interested and need to intensify our work with the official

organizations. from Mexico (Presidency, MINREX, Congress, etc.)

having somothing to du with Cuban relations, so as to have

the elements of judgment and information about the future of

these relations and above all of the North American plans and

pressures on

MEXICO with regard to their relations with Cuba

and the Mexican position tu that respect.

especially. with regard to leftist forces and their role and

importance individually.

And lastly, lt is necessary, in our opinion, to develop

an organized

methodical task,

according to the guidelines

and objectives of the plan, with the avnilable sources of in

formation from the Section or the Contor in Mexico so as to

use them more rationally.

IT SHOULD BE POINTED OUT TILAT IN

THIS SECTION, AS WELL AS IN M-S, A TENDENCY TO OBTAIN INFORMA-

TION FROM SOURCES IN CUBA IS NOTED.

b) CENTRAL ANERICA

ing

against cuba.

On the other hand, work should be strengthened with

regard to the situation

and plans of the national liberation

movement in the legion and in

each country.

An effort should

be made to get to know, completely, what the role and the

position

of

every leftist force is, since there are countries,

like Nicaragua,

where it is not known, due to lack of informa

tion,

what

rule each force

is playing and which are their

relations with us.

We consider

that we must establish con-

tacts

to work constantly and periodically with each of the

leftist forces in these

countries. Only this way we will bo

able to overcome the deticiency.

c) The situation in these countries is very serious, from

the standpoint of the infornation work.

As we have said, we

have no information about them.

We consider that the first

matter to solve

is to know the sources from which we can

obtain information and at the same time establish contact

with all the friendly forces in order to outain information.

ANALYSIS ABOUT INFORNATION ON ENEY ACTIVITIES WORK:

BACKGROUND:

About the information work with countries in the M-A

Section with regard to triumation about counter-revolutionary-

type andagression plans we can point out, in gencral, its

principal successes .ard deficiencies.

Through prevlous experience and the analysis of informa-

tion received from the countries of this Section concerning

counter-revolutionary actlvities, It was confirmed once more

that this 1y the zune preferred by

Imperialism for locating

training camps for countor-revolutionary elements, getting

to the point where this

assumes, scrious charactoristics in

certain places or specific zones. such as the case of the

Peten zone in Guatemala and Puerto Cabezas and the Maiz Is-

lands in Nicaragua.

From informaiion about this type of activity we can

point out that some was incomplete and fragmentary, observing

absolute lack of exploitation of a source;

this fact meant from the standpoint of our work serious

ficulties, since this limited considerably our possibilities

of indirect confirmation,

that is, through other different

well as a sories of derivative difficulties such

as the lack of continuity in the information, lack of con-

Ilimation, lack of contact and guidance as to the source

objectives. etc.

Analyzing all those previous phenomena

we can point

definite guideline with regard to our work for this

section during the forthcomins year, this guideline would

over the followiny aspects that will be basic fron the

standpoint of aggression plans.

Location of training camps for Cuban mercenaries,

conclusion

to the type of training they get and their

nunder, as

well as their resources.

2. Dotection of enemy aggression plans through the .

Armed Forces

of Contral American

countries

and through the so-much mentionea collective action,

or something similar.

3.

Location of operations bases for pirate launches and

counter-revolutionary groups that will operate from nearby

countries.

This is directly related with the plans for

penetrating the enemy.

Penetrate and have full information about enemy's anti-

guerrilla plans and its development.

These would be the tasks

to be developed during the year, accordingly, and following

the general guidelines and objectives of the current work.
