"P-7" on the bottoms; one has the numbers 23 and 0 opposite each

In one end of the box is a round hole sealed on the in-

A compartment is formed by a thin piece of celluloid, 1/8" from

the end with the hole.

This partition is perforated

with several

holes and covered on

one side with a layer of aluminum foil. The

lid 15 perforated with several noles and sealed on the inside

Because of the high oxygen content in each of the three

mixtures they obviously

are used as first fire mixes. i.e.,

casily

Ignitable substances which in turn ean ignite other harder-to-length

anterials fuse.

this case it appears that an ignition device (a

of safety

or incendisry

time pencil) is insersed in the hole

into the snaller compartment.

The pale red sixture, tecause of its

relatively high oxygen content,

is probably used es

mix in this compartment.

it not for the

boost given by the contents of bottle number

"2" .

As the material in the smaller compartment igaites it burns

through the perforations in the partition igniting the contents of

the main compartment.

The heat from this combustiva nelts the tape

covering the perforations

in the lid thus allowing osygen in the air

to aid and accelerate

the burning.

it appears to utilize well known principles of incendiary attack

using substances that are readily available and proven as depend-

able in;redients. Great care rould have to be exercised in rater-

proofing an assembled device if it was planned to leave it exposed

for a long period of time; several hours in a hot, damp clinate

would be an example of such an exposure.

When the plywood box was opened it was observed that the

contents were packed in sawdust.

There was no indication of
