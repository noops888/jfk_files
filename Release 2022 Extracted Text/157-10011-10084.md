frantically by the caughter of vife of fir. Martines requesting

immediate assistance in gotting Mr. Martinez' car out of the

airpori parkiny garage since it contained decoly compromising

material wich had to ba renoved before the Fsi got to it. Mr.

relayed the

inforation to CIA Headquarters and the Miani lield Office.

A decision was made by CIA licadquarters to pass this informa-.

tion to

the FBI ac the Hcadquarters level.

At it. Esterline's

request dr.

the car which in

fact did contain a number of old documents

rclating to maritine operations in the early 1960's and a note-

book, copies of which were nade avilable to the Miani Station

by the FBI.

In further coordination with the FBI lir. Esterline

confined

that Mir. Martinez, who was

well known

to the FBI to have been

a CIA enployee, was no longer an active enpioyee but was

maintaincd as an informant.

Ms. Estorline advised the FBI.

that there might be one or

two telephone nunbers in Air.

Martinez' notebook relating to the Miani Station inasmuch as

HI. Martinez had been provided a means of effecting emergency

contact with the Station. The FBI said it would bo alert

to this possibility and accepted dir. Esterline's statement

that the Station hed been totally unaware of dir. Martinez'

secret relations with dr. Hunt.

The flI pronised to avoid

disclosure of the fact that CIA had been instrumental in

helping then locate tir. Martinez' car because of the probisms

It could create for the source who had reported the matter to

CIA.
