1.

On 9 June 1969 "Dan" of the DDO Guatemala Desk (x9041)

contacted Staff and Operations Branch/Operational Evaluation

Section for information concerning Gerald Patrick HEMMING.

"Dan"'

was reterred to the writer, who is holding the hellinG

file.

When "Dan" contacted the

writer, "Dan" advised that he

is the action officer for a cable from the Guatemala Station

reporting an assassination plot on the life of President

LAUGERUD of Guatemala.

"Dan" was unfamiliar with the case of

Gerald Patrick HEMMING and had not as yet reviewed the 201 file

on HEMMING.

"Dan" was requested to alert CI Staff and JMWAVE

to the below-mentioned cable and to provide the writer with a

copy of the report coming in from the (Guatemala Station.

2.

"Dan" provided the writer with a copy of the cable

(IN 941357, Cite Guatemala City) 19530, dated 8 June 1976),

which is attached.

In substance, the

cable reflects that

circa 8 June 1976 a Guatemalan source, with the knowledge of

Guatemalan President LAUGERUD, provided the Guatemala Station 3

a written report, and a detailed briefing, concerning a plot

to assassinate President LAUGERUD.

According to the informa-

tion the plot

was to have been carried out on 15 September

of an attack upon his, ZIMERI's, life. ZIMERI has been living

in Miami since August 1975.

3.. According to the report,

the National Liberation

Movement was involved with ZIMERI in the assassination plot

and ZIMERI in turn was involved with two Americans, brothers,

Robert and Gerald Patrick HEMMING. The HEMMING brothers

assisted ZIMERI in acquiring arms, among other things, which

were flown to Guatemala in a small

aircraft.

The report also

claims that ZIMERI has close relations with police officials

in Miami and New Orleans.

Guatemalan government for the past six months or

sO.

with ZIMERI

one of them who runs a guard service

in Miami.

ESDEW-I did not mention names but

described one of the Americans as about six feet

four inches and weighing about 230 pounds.

4. The Guatemalan report of the assassination plot ends

with five requests

for information by President LAUGERUD:

a. Is ZIMERI still in the United States?

b.

In the event ZIMERI is not in the United

States legally, deport him to Guatemala.

C .

Is

LIMERI recruiting merceraries in the

United States for possible use in

Guatemala?

d. Does ZIMERI receive any kind of preferen-.

tial

treatment by U. S. authorities which

permit him to carry firearms, as well as

to purchase arms and ammunition for

shipment to Guatemala?

e.

Any information on Robert and Gerald

HEMMING?

5.

On 19 June

1976 "Dan" of the Guatemala Desk advised

that DDO is

referring the entire matter to the FBI and State

Department.

6. Office of Security indices are negative in pertinent

variations of the name of ZIMERI or Robert HEMMING.

Gerald Patrick HEMMING is well known to this Agency,

the Office of Security Miani Field Office, and JMVAVE.

none.

The most recent incident wherein HEMMING claimed such

affiliation was in May 1975 when he volunteered his services

to the Drug Enforcement Administration.

Gerald Patrick HEMNING

is a long-time cohort of Frank Anthony STURGIS (SF#353 459),

aka: Frank FIORINI, of Watergate notoriety who also has a

long-time record of

falsely

claiming Agency affiliation.

In

the late 1950's HEMMING and

STURGIS, both former U.S. Marines,

joined Fidel CASTRO in Cuba but returned shortly thereaftei

claiming disillusionment with the CASTRO cause.

Soon thereafter;

STURGIS organized a group of mercenaries for Caribbean and

Central American activities which he named the International

Anti-Communist Brigade. A reported sub-unit of this "Brigade"

(the backers of whom have never been fully established) was

named the Intercontinental Penetration Force, headed by Gerald

a Guatemalan government expose of this assassination plot

memorandum, to wit:

a memorandum by the writer dated 10 June

1975 in the name of Frank STURGIS and Everett Howard HUNT, Jr.;

and an extract from

a book published in early 1976 written by

Michael CANFIELD and Alan J. WEBERMAN.

The book Coup d'etat

in America--The CIA and the Assassination of JohnT.

Kennody

is a diatribe against the Agency and attempts to link the Agency

with the assassination of President KENNEDY.

One of the major

links attempted by the authors is

through Everett Howard HUNT,

JI. to Frank STURGIS to Gerald

Patrick HEMMING to Loran Eugene

HALL. Loran Eugene HALL was a member of HEMMING's Interconti-

publicity in 1967 when New Orleans District Attorney "Jim"

Loran Eugene HALL received nationwide

GARRISON alleged that HALL (and the Intercontinental Penetration

Force) was involved in the assassination of President KENNEDY

and that members of this unit were connected with CIA.

GARRISON

shortly thereafter dropped his interest in HALL, but it is

interesting that he did so after Gerald Patrick HEMMING and

another cohort, Robert K. BROWN, joined GARRISON's investigation.
