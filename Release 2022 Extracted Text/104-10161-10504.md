1. WALTER C, BADENDICK MET FOR OVER TWO HOURS WITH SON

OF WUCLASSIC/86 IN LOCAL RESTAURANT ON 9 OCT 78, MEETING WAS
EXTREMELY WARM AND FRIENDLY, WITH BOTH RECALLING VIGNETTES

AIRPORT TO FLY TO EAST COAST TO FINALIZE PURCHASE OF FARM
NEAR CHICO, CA,, BUT WAS PLEASED TO TAKE TIME TO MEET BADENDICK

TALENTED AND AT ONE TIME YOUNGEST MAJOR IN U,S, ARMY, HAD
MARRIED SECOND WIFE UNACCEPTABLE TO ARMY AND GAVE UP HIS CAREER
BECAUSE OF HIS RESPONSIBILITIES TO HER AND HIS CHILDREN (SON
WAS ONLY OFFSPRING FROM FIRST MARRIAGE). THIS LED TO LENGTHY
PERIOD WHICH SON DESCRIBED AS "PURE HELL" FOR C/88, DURING
WHICH HE WAS POOR, IN ILL HEALTH AND UNABLE TO UTILIZE HIS CON]
SIDERABLE TALENTS AS INTELLIGENCE OFFICER, DURING LAST EIGHTEEN
MONTHS OF ASSOCIATION WITH RTACTION, C/88 WAS ONCE AGAIN IN HIS
ELEMENT, WAS DOING PURPOSEFUL AND IMPORTANT WORK AND WAS FULFILLED
AT END OF HIS LIFE. SON IS VERY COGNIZANT OF THIS AND HAS VERY
GOOD FEELINGS TOWARD RTACTION BECAUSE OF IT, SON WAS INTIMATE
CONFIDANT OF C/88, WHO TOLD HIM HE HAD RTACTION MISSION IN

BUT DID NOT REVEAL TARGETS EVEN IN GENERAL, SAID NOTHING

OPERANDI,AND DID NOT IDENTIFY BADENDICK BEYOND BEING
UNNAMED RTACTION OFFICER POSING AS NEPHEW (THIS LAST IN CASE C/88
SHOULD DIE, SO SON WOULD BE PREPARED TO BACKSTOP BADENDICK AS
RELATIVE), .

2. REGARDING C/88'S PLAN TO ASSASSINATE CASTRO, SON SAID
IT WAS WRITTEN MANY YEARS AGO IN FLORIDA AT TIME WHEN SON IS
ABSOLUTELY SURE C/88 HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH RTACTION, IN FACT,
SAID SON, HE DOES NOT THINK PLAN WAS DRAWN UP AT ANYONE'S BEHEST,

SURE IT REMAINS HIS PRIVATE PROPERTY; HE IS AWARE OF UNDESERVED
HARM IT COULD DO TO INNOCENT RTACTION,

3. SON SAID THAT APARTMENT MANAGER HAD CONTACTED HIM TO SAY
THAT THE LOST RANDALL KNIFE HAD BEEN FOUND IN WEEDS OUTSIDE
APARTMENT AND WOULD BE RETURNED TO SON, HE IS SURE THAT MANAGER

SATISFIED NOW THAT HE HAD KNIFE BACK AND IS PREPARED TO FORGET
THE OTHER MISSING ITEMS,
