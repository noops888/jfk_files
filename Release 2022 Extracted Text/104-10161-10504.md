1.

WALTER C. BADENDICK MET FOR OVER TWO HOURS WITH SON

OF NUCLASSIC/B8 IN LOCAL RESTAURANT ON 9 OCT 7B.

MEETING WAS

EXTREMELY WARM AND FRIENDLY, WITH BOTH RECALLING VIGNETTES

AND ANECDOTES ABOUT WUCLASSIC/88 (C/88). SON WAS ENROUTE TO

AIRPORT TO FLY TO EAST COAST TO FINALIZE PURCHASE OF FARM

NEAR CHICO, CA., BUT WAS PLEASED TO TAKE TIME TO MEET BADENDICK

AND TALK ABOUT C/88.

SON RELATED THAT C/88, ALTHOUGH ENORMOUSLY

TALENTED AND AT ONE TIME YOUNGEST MAJOR IN U.S. ARMY, HAD

MARRIED SECOND WIFE UNACCEPTABLE TO ARMY AND GAVE UP HIS CAREER

BECAUSE OF HIS RESPONSIBILITIES TO HER AND HIS CHILDREN (SON

WAS ONLY OFFSPRING FROM FIRST MARRIAGES. THIS LED TO LENGTHY

PERIOD WHICH SON DESCRIBED AS "PURE HELL" FOR C/88, DURING

WHICH HE WAS POOR, IN ILL HEALTH AND UNABLE TO UTILIZE HIS CON-

SIDERABLE TALENTS

AS INTELLIGENCE OFFICER.

DURING LAST EIGHTEEN

MONTHS OF ASSOCIATION WITH RTACTION, C/88 WAS ONCE AGAIN IN HIS

ELEMENT, WAS DOING PURPOSEFUL AND IMPORTANT WORK AND WAS FULFILLED

AT END OF HIS LIFE.

SON IS VERY COGNIZANT OF THIS AND HAS VERY

GOOD FEELINGS TOWARD RTACTION BECAUSE OF IT.

SON WAS INTIMATE

CONFIDANT OF C/B8, WHO TOLD HIM HE HAD RTACTION MISSION IN

BUT DID NOT REVEAL TARGETS EVEN IN GENERAL, SAID NOTHING

UF MODUS OPERANDI, AND DID NOT IDENTIFY BADENDICK BEYOND BEING

UNNAMED RTACTION OFFICER POSING AS NEPHEW THIS LAST IN CASE C/88

SHOULD DIE, SO SON WOULD BE PREPARED TO BACKSTOP BADENDICK AS

RELATIVE).

2.

REGARDING C/B8'S PLAN TO ASSASSINATE CASTRO, SON SAID

IT WAS WRITTEN MANY YEARS AGO IN FLORIDA AT TIME WHEN SON IS

ABSOLUTELY SURE C/88 HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH RACTION.

IN FACT,

SAID SON, HE DOES NOT THINK PLAN WAS DRAWN UP AT ANYONE'S BEHEST,

HE MOVED C/88 TO MONTEREY IN MAY 78, BUT IT WAS NOT AMONG PERSONAL

NOR KNOWLEDGE OF PLAN, IT COULD BE SUBJECT TO MISINTERPRETATION

SURE IT REMAINS HIS PRIVATE PROPERTY; HE IS AWARE OF UNDESERVED

HARM IT COULD DO TO INNOCENT RTACTION.

SON SAID THAT APARTMENT MANAGER HAD CONTACTED HIM TO SAY

THAT THE LOST RANDALL KNIFE HAD BEEN FOUND IN WEEDS OUTSIDE

APARTMENT AND WOULD BE RETURNED TO SON. HE IS SURE THAT MANAGER

SATISFIED NOW THAT HE HAD KNIFE BACK AND IS PREPARED

TO FORGET

THE OTHER MISSING ITEMS.
