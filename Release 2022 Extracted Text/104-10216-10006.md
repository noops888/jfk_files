” MEMORANDUM:

SUBJECT: Proposal to Exploit AMLASH-1 and~ :
Jose Rebellon in AMSNEAK Operation j

1. It is proposed that at the next meeting with }
UNSNAFU-25 we pass a message as follows: us

“A big.comandante or capitan who used
to be a leader of the university students a
opened a numbered (secret) account in
. Switzerland through,Colombian Suarez (my
successor), He was traveling in Europe at
that time, roughly December 1964-January 1965. ‘
The deposit was in the amount of $10,000." i

The message is purposely so phrased that it could apply to '
both AMLASH-1 and Jose Rebellon. Both are past presidents
of the FEU (Federation of University Students), one is a

i comandante and the other a captain, and both were traveling.
in Europe in December 1964-January 1965.

ia 2. Subject proposal has taken the following information
into consideration.

AMLASH-1

. a. The record: The file shows that since 1
i HOLE 1959 and repeatedly since then AMLASH-1 j
has threatened to eliminate AMTHUG-1, but has
not done so. He also was reportedly on the
verge several times of defecting but never did.

| There are numerous reports of varying credibility
that he has been and is a Castro agent. His
character is such that he has been described

in a report as "a probable thief, a possible
user of narcotics, a homosexual or a friend of
homosexuals," but also "an exceedingly brave i
man." Various reports indicate that he is a
‘heavy drinker and a party lover. Thus a person
with such traits could resonably be believed

to be involved in irregular financial transactions.

b. Favorable factors (from AMSNEAK
standpoint): 1n the summer of 1962 AXLASH-1
gave AMWHIP-1 $500 in Helsinki to be deposited
for AMLASH-1 in a European bank "for a rainy
day." In March 1961 ANLASH-1 showed great
sensitivity on the subject of bank accounts
in Europe by Cuban officials, indicating that
he might shoot any official so involved.

¢. Conclusion: While it cannot be
discounted that AMLASH-1 may be a Castro
agent, it may be that he has been sincere
in his dealings with KUBARK. Resolution of
doubts through an LCFLUTTER interview has
been impossible since AMLASH-1 hit the
ceiling when the matter was first mentioned.

Presumably KUBARK's interest in
AMLASH-1 is to see him carry out his mission
to eliminate AMTHUG-1. The above proposal
may actually stimulate the desired action.
If AMLASH-1 is questioned by the regime in
connection with this charge, and should the
investigation involve a certain amount of
harassment and unpleasantness, he might well
reach the conclusion that the time to take
matters into his own hands (which he has
threatened to do for several years) has at
last arrived.

If AMLASH-1 is a Castro agent and
Castro should be aware of AMLASH-1's relation-
ship with KUBARK, Castro might conclude that
AMLASH-1 received the money from KUBARK,
banked it without reporting it, and was in
fact working with KUBARK against Castro.
(At the recent meetings in Paris AMLASH-1
asked us for $10,000. We did not give him
this sum, though AMWHIP-1 gave him $7,000.)

If for any reason the regime should
do away with ANLASH-1, his alleged sympathizers
in the Armed Forces might feel they must react
at once to save their own skins. Given the
tense political situation in Cuba today, this
is not out of the question and certainly this
“proposal could split the regime more.

Jose Rebellon

i .Rebellon is a non-controversial good
target for inclusion in this AMSNEAK play for

_ the following reasons:

a. He is close to Castro, as well as to
AMLASH-1, and has a Communist background.

b. He is familiar with the $80,000
account opened in a Swiss bank by Ambassador
Carrillo in the fall of 1964, Rebellon has
been authorized by Castro to draw on that
fund for purchases related to Castro's pet
projects. Castro might think that Rebellon
had raided Castro's own official fund.

As with AMLASH-1, any action by the

- regime against Rebellon might widen splits in

Cuba and bring about further political uneasiness
and tensions in interpersonal relationships that
we desire,
