MEMORANDUM FOR THE. RECORD

1. Elsie L SCALETTI recalls that Raymond A. FRADYER, Chief of

the Cuban Section, tried to get Agee to discuss the development of contacts

with access to the Cuban target in the Olympics. In these djscussions it may
well be that Agee was told about LIARM-1,(
who was a contact(of the ‘Station Jand we were trying to get invited to Cuba, 9%

(LIARM-1 is no longer a contact (of the ‘$tation)even though he is still with[

- 2. SCALETTI recalls the Cuban Section feeling very frustrated that
: Agee could provide no leads or assistance io this section in its effort to target
+: against the Cuban teams. She recalls no memoranda prepared by Agee for the
° Section, no leads given the Section, and he came to discuss the olympics with
C/Cuba not more than half a dozen times. S

$. As SCALETTI recalls, it is unlikely that Agee knew any thing about
the operations being run against the Cuban target jhan that which he might have
picked up at Headquarters or known about (fhe StationJoperations in general --
such as audio, surveillance, photo surveillance, etc.

4, SCALETTI had Agee over to her home once for dinner; there were
no other guests. Agee had SCALETTI, her husband, and Laura J. UTSTINE _o+
(on TDY) to his apartment once for dinner. The conversation was alway: poe Pega ry
light. The only significant thing about Agee's plans which arose was his
discussion about buying used drycleaning equipment in the United States,
bringing it to Mexico and setting up a drycleaning plant. This was brought
up as something for the future and just t. igea Phil was toying with.

5. SCALETTI ran into Agee by chance on the side street by the Embassy
one day after the arrival ohn A. PROBERT. Agee said he understood
PROBERT had arrived as ‘0$) and he wouid like to say hello. I suggested
he call PROBERT. I immediately informed PROBERT of my chance encounter
with Agee, and informed PROBERT that Agee had resigned under somewhat
of a cloud and suggested he get briefed himself on Agee's assignment in Mexico,
