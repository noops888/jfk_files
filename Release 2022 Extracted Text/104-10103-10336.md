Visit of Cuban Exile Victor Espinosa.

In accordance with our conversation yesterday-I have set

A little earlier this year Espinosa received a request

from one of his reliable Cuban contacts in Surope, asking that

he come there quickly. Espinosa went

to Miami, obtained. false

Cuban papers, and went to Paris.

in Spain (which Espinosa entered illegally), Espinosa was in-

formed that there is a plan to overthrow the Castro regime

and to kill Castro and some of his main leaders.. The plot is

led by Cubelap and some of the Merch 13 Movement, plus (I be-

hours), killing Castro and his most effective men (thus

ruining the Castro novement forever), and then trying to hold

out for as long as feasible. It is essentiel that they know

what, if anything, the Americans might do to help, now and/or

later, when the coup is attempted. Also, they wished to alert

the United States Goverrment to what was being planned.

Espinosa hurriedly returned -to New York City. He called

running out.

Espinosa's friends in Paris keep calling him,

ceutiously asking whether there has been some "response"

but Espinosa has had to keep putting them off.

Meanwhile,

the Cuban who was waiting in Spain for the answer has had to

return..

Espinosa keeps waiting to hear whether the Americans

will play ball with the Cubelas group.

The plot has lasted

for over l8 months, and the plotters plan to go ahead very

soon no matter whether the Americans "play ball" or not. One

reason is that they almost have to go ahead now, for the plot

will soon be discovered and then it will be entirely hopeless.

Espinosa also referred to a jeweler by the name of

Teppellino (spellingt), located at 47th Street, In New York

City. Teppelino works for CIA and has frequent contact with

the Cuban Ambassador, in Paris:

The Ambassador regularly dis-

poses of jewelry and other valuebles made available from cuba.

He does this through Teppeltino. However, the latter fools

to sell for $80,000.

CIA think the Cuban Ambassador does not know he is working for

CIA, but the Ambassador does know.

Espinosa is determined to bring the very dangerous

situation of the Cuban plot to the attention of some top level

official in the United States Government unless he receives

at least some reply from CIA.

Conment:

Espinosa was not overly tense and did not indulge in his-

trionics, but I felt he was quite determined to push this

matter further if he did not get some response within the very

ability on the basis of this one conversation.

However, If I

had to guess at this point I would be inclined to accept most

of what he said about actual events. 'But of course there are

all sorts of obvious possibilities, including provocation.

this was not the sort of thing we got into. However, I addad

that I would see to it that someone called him. I further

said that, unofficlally, I had enjoyed talking with him.

Espinosa seemed somewhat mollified and tamporarily reassured

by this. However, I doubt very much that he will wait longer

than two or three days more before making another attempt to

bring this situation to a head..?
