in Spain-(which:Eepinosa entered illegally), Espinosa was in-
formed that. there is a plan to-overthrow the Castro regime
and to kill Castro and some.of-his main leaders. The plot is
led by: Cubele# -an@ some of the March 13:Movement,. plus (I be-
lieve) some:militaury officera,. They must move very quickly
because: more and ‘more people are.learning of the plot and ~
there.is growing risk cf .exposure,'They are anxious to have
some coordination, :or at least coneultation, with responsible
Americans, ~!They are: not :confident: that ‘they could win an all-
out fight against.:the Cestro forces, and are ‘thinking more in
terms of taking control for a short time (perhaps only a few
hours), -killing Castro and his most effective men (thus _
ruining -the Castro wovement ‘forever), end then trying to ‘hold
out..for as long as feasible.‘ It+is essential that ‘they know”
what,if anything,.the Americans might-de to help, now and/or
later, when. the-coup. is. attempted. Also, they wished to alert
the United States Government-to what was: being planned.’

pThe. Cubans-might have’ turned to(Earl Wilifamson)' (the CIA
men. in Madrid): “However, they: belies (Williamson)is completely
unreliable,::A Cuban girl-was sent té-Badrid sotie- time ago by
the Castro: people?.(Wi11liemson was fooled by her and, being

_very fond of women, set her up in an apartment in Madrid, He

also arranged for her.to work with the International Rescue
Committee, -When- the proper moment’ came;*'four months ego, she
flew back to Havana with:some very-useful files, ‘In these |
circumstanceg:the:Cuban“plotters have no confidence whatever
in(Williamson)p3 They urgently asked Espinosa to be their go-
between with reliable American officials. The “top security"
man-returned to Havana, while one representative of the
plotters waited in Spain for an answer, .

~~ Espinosa ‘hurriedly ‘returned ‘to ‘New York City. He called :
O'Brien of the New York FBI to ask that ‘the latter arrange for
hie to telk with some serious and reliable man from CIA,
O'Brien did so,- Espinosa then:told the foregoing story, and
more, -to a CIA. men named "Hal", Hal impressed Espinosa as
being intelligent and reliable, Espinose understands that Hal
or someone elée went. to Spain to check on kis story, At all
events, Espinosa was assured CIA understood the urgency of the
matter and that he would be called within a few days. ‘A week

running out. Espinosa's friends in Paris keep calling him,
ceutiously asking whether there has been some "response",

but Espinosa has had to keep putting them off, Meanwhile,
the Cuban who was waiting in Spain for the answer has had to
return.” Espinosa keeps waiting to hear ‘whether the Americans
will play ball with the’ Cubeld, “group. . The plot has lasted
for over 18 months, and the plotters plan to go ahead very -
soon rio matter whether the Americans ‘play ball" or not, One
reason is that they almost hav to go ehead now, for the plot

will soon be discovered and then it will be entirely hopeless.

\Espinoga also referred to a jeweler by the name of
TeppelZino spelling?), located at 47th Street, in New York
City. TeppéMino works for CIA and has frequent contact with
the Cuban Ambassador, in Paris, . The Ambassador regularly dis-
poses of jewelry and other valuables made available from Cuba.
He does this through Tepp: no. However, the latter fools
CIA, , For example, the Ambassador agrees to sell for $80,000.
Teppeitino informs CIA the price is §110,000, and quietly
pockets the difference. On the other hand, Teppéjiino and
CIA think the Cuban Ambassador does not know he is working for
CIA, but the Ambassador does know.

Espinosa is determined to bring the very dangerous
situation o& the Cuban plot to the attention of some top level
official in the United States Government unless he receives :
at least some reply from CIA.

Comment:

Espinosa was not overly tense and did not indulge in his-
trionics, but I felt he was quite. determined to push this :
matter further if he did not get some response within the very
near future, I cannot, and do not have to, judge his reli-
ebility on the basis of this one conversation. However, if I
had to guess at this point IT would be inclined to accept most
of what he said about actual events, But of course there are
all sorts of obvious possibilities, including provocetion,

In accordance with whet we agreed on, while Espinosa was
