Hospital, Dallas, Texas and requested permission to be with William

Clarence WOOD, Jf. during the time he would be under the anesthetic 1n

the operating room on 13 July 1953. Mr. HIlT was very cooperative and

03 (WAKEY IDED) a160 received permission from Subject'& doctor, Dr. Albert

D'ERRICO and Dr. Earl WEIR, Head Anesthetist at Baylor Hospital who

agreed to cooperate. Two nurses, anesthetists, a Mrs. Sally MOORE

and & Helen GORMAN were briefed and promised to cooperate: Dr. D'ERRICO

asked Agent (WAKErIMD) 1f he should Introduce him to Subject and the

Agent answered "no" f3 The first words of Subject when he saw his doctor

In the operating room were:

"Hes Washington contacted you, or 1e there

a CIA agent or an FBI agent here in the hospital to be with me during

the operation?"

...DI. D'ERRICO answered "no" to this question. Subject

was put under sodiun pentothol so a spinal tap and x-rays could be made.. No

brain operation vas required.

Agent WAKEFIALD, using the pseudo, Dr. SHAUGHNESSY, was In Subject'e

room when he recovered from the effects of the anesthetic. Subject's

father was also there. (Subject's father, William Clarence WOOD, Br.

1s a well-to-do banker; the Lubbock National Bank of Lubbock, lexas.

Subject looked around the room and Inquired of his father: "Daddy, has

any man besides the medical staff entered this room while you have been

here?" The father replied, "No, son, no one has entered the room except

the doctor here (referring to Dr. SILAUCHNESSY) and the nurse."

After

Subject was convinced no goverament agent was there, he stated he "had

served overseas with the CIA and had seen many people killed. The CIA

are a bunch of dirty cut-throats and I wouldn't be a bit surprised 11

they sent one of their men to cut mine. They think they are smart but

one of these days in the near future I will show them who 18 the

smartest.

They have about 100 GS-14's walking around with their heads

shaped 11ke eggs. Daddy, I have been such a failure but after I get well

I am going to go back to school and get my degree and fight the CIA with

everything that I can."

Bubject never became aware of Dr. SHAUGHNESSY's Identity. Bubject's

doctor told Agent WAKEFIELD that Subject'a trouble was probably caused

by the excessive use of alcohols that 11 he would talk under the tifluence

of an anesthetic, he would most Ilkely talk when he was under the Influence

of alcohol.
