in which he told the office how he had been recruited OSS while
attending infantry school at Fort Benning in October 1944; that his
‘,-; Services were to be used in originating and conducting radio programs in
‘ . ‘the CBI theaters that when he did not hear from 03S, he made certain

+ was not in a position to avail themselves of his services but he was to
ny keep in touch. Tag interviewing officer in Honolulu forwarded a report
‘of the visit to the Security Officer at OSS Headquarters with a comment to

, Base.) Subject suffered a nervous breakdown in, March 1952 and was returned
to ters, Washington for medical observation. Examination by the

recommended that he should not attempt any extreme covert work but should

: only accept either light semi-covert or overt duties for a probationary

. period of one year, these duties to be performed within the continental
"Limits of the United States. Subject was assigned to OTR as an instructor

in the operating room were: “Hes Washington contacted you, ‘or is there
4 CIA agent or an FBI agent here in the hospital to be with me during

‘any man besides the medical staff entered this room while you hava been
"here?" The father replied, "No, son, no one hes entered the room except
