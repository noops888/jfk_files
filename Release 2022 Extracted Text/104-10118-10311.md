/s/ Winston 1. Scott

Although this employee is a fine intelligence officer end has worked

very hard for the Chief of Station, Mexico City, I consider the reting

of Outstanding in all specific duties and for over-all performence to be

excessively high. Reporting on the ectivities she supervises has been

as good as that from other Mexico City operations but is still not up

to DDP standerds. While most of the projects she is concemned with are

handled with proper cost consciousness, at least one of them,

Project, 1s not.

The agents are paid too much and their ectivities are

not adequately reported. This has been called to the station's ettention.

Miss Goodpasture has been

medical retirement in October 1973.

She is a charter member of the Agency,

having entered on duty from OSS and its successor organizations.

career is highly distinguished by virtue of consistently strong to out-

standing performance, all of which is fully documented.

In addition to several staff and desk assignments, Miss Goodpasture

served in support of the successful coup against the communist government

in Guatemala in 1954 and completed tours of duty in Bombay, Monterrey and

Mexico City.

Undoubtedly, the high point of her career occurred during

her service

in Mexico City from 1957 through 1970, where she served as a

"trouble-shooting"

case officer for the incomparable Winfield Scott

(deceased), who was

then the Chief of Station.

Mr. Scott, a stern task-

master, described Miss Goodpasture over these years as

"intelligent, hard-

working, conscientious, versatile, valuable and unquestionably one of the

most competent CI/CE officers he ever had the privilege of working with."

Miss Goodpasture's fitness reports were totally consistent with this

appraisal, and were characterized by outstanding ratings.

In her final

assignment prior to acute medical

problems, she worked for the CI Staff

(October 1970-Oetober 1971),

earning the

following remarks from her

supervisor:

...I

venture

to rate her overall performance, thirty

years

of it,

as Outstanding.

Ann is one of the tough warp-threads on which

this organization

is woven,

and when she retires the fabric of this organi-

zation will be weakened.

The reviewing official agreed with the above

and recorded his hope that Miss Goodpasture get the official Agency recogni
