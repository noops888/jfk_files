6. Samvel WISE, "Counsel in the American Embassy in Moscow" who
is referred to above, may well be Samuel Griffin WISE Jr., #74574,
SD & SSD, who apparently was once a contract employee on AEACTIVE.
[Be State Department reviewed WISE's file on 2 June 195k; and as of
September 1962 a Samuel G. WISE was Second Secretary of the American
Fubassy in Moscow. At that time WISE advised in a cable to the State
Department _ eee

cae ‘DAVIS' case is very similar to that of
OSWALD; and he, like OSWALD, lived in the Soviet Union for two years
after his defection-and prior to making application for return to the
United States.7

7. WISE was an applicant for CIA employment in early 1953 and
was security approved subject to polygraph on 11 August 1953. He did

WISE was granted a CSA.to permit his use as a contract employee on
AEACTIVE in New York City. His CSA was cancelled on 24 March 1958.

during an investigation of the latter for possible CIA employment in 1952.
WISE, according to MUNSEGL's landlady and social acquaintance in Washington,
D.C. during the period of about a year which ended in April 1952, was the
only person she kmew by name with whom MUNSELL was friendly. Accordin;
to the informant, WISE was a student at Columbia University whose address
was 423 Furnald Hall. MUNSELL was Security disapproved for CIA exployment
in June 1952 because of his close association on a professional and social
pasis, while attending Denver University from 1946 to 1951, with persons
of questionable loyality. In November 1954, MUNSELL was of interest to
project FIALIVE with reference to assignment to

Security advised of the derogatory information regarding him.

New York, which was attacked by a Citizen's Group, which alleged Commnist
influence in the school system. He had several questionable associates in
