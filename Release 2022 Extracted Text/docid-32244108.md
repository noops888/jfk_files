Number of releases of previously postponed information: 7

Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors

absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United
States or to any individual.

Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could

MEMORANDUM

TO: TOM LAMBETH

FROM: KENNETH D. KLEIN

DATE: JUNE 16, 1977

RE: BILL TRIPLETT

It is my recommendation that Bill Triplett
be hired as a staff counsel. I interviewed

him approximately 5 months ago and he is far
superior to almost all of the applicants I have
interviewed. His legal background is excellent
for our purposes. He has experience as a pro-
secutor, a defense lawyer and as an investigator.
He impressed me as being intelligent, well spoken

and as having an easy going manner.

He desires to leave his present position with LEAA

due to the lack of challenge. I am certain that

this Committee would be gaining a productive member

by hiring Mr. Triplett.
