"RAMPARTS" MAGAZINE

"Ramparts" in a letter to subscribers dated

May 1, °1968, announced that beginning June 1,
1968, it would be published biweekly ata

yearly subscription price of $15. In this
letter "Ramparts" described itself as follows:
"..,the first national publication to consis—
tently reveal the ribbon of lies supporting
America's involvement in Vietnam; we stripped
the curtain from America's ‘invisible government!
by exposing CIA's unlicensed intrusion into our
domestic lives; we dared to write about the
applications of the Catholic Church's political
power; we warned, years before the Kerner
report, that white racism was the base of
America's racial problems; we blasted away at

the corroded institutions of Cold War liberalism.
'Ramparts' is now the largest left-of-center
commercial magazine in the history of the United
States..."

ROBERT SCHEER

The PFP is an anti-Vietnam war political party
which obtained sufficient signatures to be

placed on the ballot in California for the general
election held in November, 1968.

The "Evening Star," a Washington, D. C. daily
newspaper, contained an article in its. July 13, 1970,
edition captioned "Cleaver and Ten Others Flying to North
Korea". The article, datelined Moscow (UPI), states
Eldridge Cleaver and Robert Scheer, a California candidate
for the United States Senate, led an eleven person delegation
to North Korea today try to make the American military
presence in South Korea a new target of the anti-war movement.
"We're going to begin a process of developing a movement in
America,that extends our struggle against the war in Vietnam
toa geteral struggle against United States imperialism,
especially in Korea," Scheer said. He also said financing
for the trip was arranged individually and not by the North
Koreans.

Eldridge Cleaver is a former Black Panther
Party (PLP) Minister of Information who is
now a Federal fugitive in Algeria.

A characterization of the BPP is contained
in the appendix.

On August 18, 1970, a source furnished the following
information issued »by the Pyong Yang KCMA International
Service in English, Pyong Yang, North Korea. At a farewell
banquet held August, 11, 1970, at Pyong Yang for the "U. S.
Peoples Anti- Imperialist Delegation" of which Eldridge Cleaver
is head Cleaver was quoted as saying, "We can say that we.
have spent one very happy and rewarding month inside the
University of Revolution...We know we are better qualified to
wage our struggle against “fascism and imperialists...sc it
is with revolutionary anticipation and enthusiasm that we
return to our battlefront, knowing full well in advance that
we will deliver death blows to U. S. fascism and imperialism".

The "Herald and News", a daily paper published in
Livermore, California, in its August 16, 1970, edition issued
an article captioned "Cleaver's Party Arrives in Hanoi". The
article was datelined Tokyo (UPI) and quoted the official
Vietnam News Agency (VNA) as stating a delegation of eleven
Americans headed by Black Panther leader Eldridge Cleaver had
arrived in North Vietnam. The group, which includes California
politician and author Robert Scheer, went to Hanoi after a stay

of about one month in North Korea. Wyigdeseribed this group as
3 230.

ROBERT SCHEER

an anti-imperialist group and stated they arrived August 14,
1970, and were welcomed by Dang Thai Mai, Vice President
of the 'Committee for Solidarity with the American People".
Besides Cleaver and Scheer, VNA listed the members of the
party as:

"Elaine Brown, Deputy Minister of Information of the BPP

| “Janet Austin, Editor of 'Ramparts' magazine

"Ann Froines, BPP Defense Committee, New Haven, Connecticut
"Alex Hing, Red Guards, San Francisco, California

“Andy Truskier, student, anti-war movement, Berkeley, California
“Janet Kranzberg, New York Newsreed

“Regina Blumenfeld, Women's Liberation, Berkeley, California
"Randy Rappaport, Women's Liberation, Cambridge, Massachusetts

“Hideko Patricia Sumi, Movement for a Democratic Military
Oceanside, California"

A second source advised on July 24, 1970, that
Robert Scheer financed a film on Eldridge Celaver produced in
France early in 1970.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation has no information
that would indicate there is any connection between the
financing of the Cleaver film and Scheer's visit to Moscow in
July, 1970. It is also believed this was Scheer's first visit
to Moscow and there is no indication he has had prior contact
with the Soviets. There is no known mnnection between the
BPP activities and the Moscow trip in 1970 with the-exception
that Eldridge Cleaver is believed to have traveled through
Moscow in early September, 1969, as he journeyed to North Korea.

For information, this division is unaware of the
Soviet's attitude toward new left publications such as "Ramparts"
magazine.
