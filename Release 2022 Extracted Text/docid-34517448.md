"RAMPARTS" MAGAZINE

"Ramparts" in a letter to subscribers dated

May 1, 1968,

announced that beginning June 1,

1968, it would be published biweekly at a

yearly subscription price of $15.

In this

letter "Ramparts" described itself as follows:

•..the first national publication to consis-

tently reveal the ribbon of lies supporting

America's involvement in Vietnam; we stripped

the curtain from America's 'invisible government'

by exposing CIA's unlicensed intrusion into our

domestic lives; we dared to write about the

applications of the Catholic Church's political

power; we warned, years before the Kerner

report,

that white racism was the base of

America's racial problems; we blasted away at

the corroded institutions of Cold War liberalism.

"' 'Ramparts' is now the largest left-of-center

commercial magazine in the history of the United

States..

ROBERT SCHEER

The PFP is

an anti-Vietnam war political party

which obtained sufficient signatures to be

placed on the ballot in California for the general

election held in November, 1968.

The "Evening Star," a Washington, D. C. daily

newspaper, contained an article in Its. July 13, 1970,

edition captioned "Cleaver and Ten Others Flying to North

Korea".

The article, datelined Moscow (UPI), states

Eldridge Cleaver and

Robert Scheer, a California candidate

for the United States Senate, led an eleven person delegation

to North Korea today o try to make the American military

presence in South Korea a new target of the anti-war movement.

"We're going to begin a process of developing a movement in

especially in Korea," Scheer said

especially in korea one into a to save handinam

for the trip was arranged individually and not by the North

Koreans.

Eldridge Cleaver is a former Black Panther

Party (PLP) Minister of Information who is

now a Federal fugitive in Algeria.

A characterization of the BPP is contained

in the appendix.

On August 18, 1970, a source furnished the following

information issued by

the

Pyong Yang KCMA International

Service in English, Pyong Yang, North Korea. At a farewell

at Pyong Yang for the "u.S.

Peoples Anti-Imperialist Delegation" of which Eldridge Cleaver

is head Cleaver was quoted as saying, "We can say that we.

have spent one very happy and rewarding month inside the

University of Revolution.. We know we are better qualified to

wage our struggle against fascism and imperialists...sc it

is with revolutionary anticipation and enthusiasm that we

return to our battlefront, knowing full well in advance that

we will deliver death blows to U. S. fascism and imperialism"

The "Herald and News"

, a daily paper published in

vermore, California, in its August 16, 1970, edition issued

an article captioned

"Cleaver's Party Arrives

in Hanoi".

The

article was datelined Tokyo (UPI) and quoted the official

Vietnam News Agency (VNA) as stating a delegation of eleven

Americans headed by Black Panther leader Eldridge Cleaver had

arrived in North Vietnam. The group, which includes California

politician and author Robert Scheer, went to Hanoi after a stay

of about one month in North korea. ISüzdescribed this group as

ROBERT SCHEER

an anti-imperialist group and stated they arrived August 14,

1970, and were welcomed by Dang Thai Mai, Vice President

of the 'Committee for solidarity with the

American People"

Besides Cleaver and Scheer, VNA listed the members of the

party as:

"Elaine Brown, Deputy Minister of Information of the BPP

"Janet Austin, Editor of 'Ramparts' magazine

"Ann Froines, BPP Defense Committee, New Haven, Connecticut

"Alex Hing, Red Guards, San Francisco, California

"Andy Iruskier, student, anti-war movement, Berkeley, California

"Janet Kranzberg, New York Newsreed

"Regina Blumenfeld, Women's Liberation, Berkeley, California

"Randy. Rappaport, Women's Liberation, Cambridge, Massachusetts

"Hideko Patricia Sumi

, Movement for a Democratic Military

Oceanside, California"

A second source advised on July 24, 1970, that

Robert Scheer

financed

a film on Eldridge Celaver produced in

France early in 1970.192

The Federal Bureau of Investigation has no information

that would indicate there is any connection between the

financing of the Cleaver film and Scheer's visit to Moscow in

July, 1970. It is also believed this was Scheer's first visit

to Moscow and there is no indication he has had prior contact

with the soviets.

There is no known

connection between the

BPP activities and the

Moscow trip in 1970 with the exception

that Eldridge Cleaver is believed to have traveled through

Moscow in early September, 1969, as he journeyed to North Korea.

For information, this division is unaware of the

Soviet's attitude toward new left publications such as "Ramparts"

magazine.
