Question #3 - Did McCone or Raborn have any information on this:

What?

Answer:

Office of Security records contain only limited information

in regard to this question. The SE Division (then SR) was the

responsible office for the

confinement of Nosenko until late

October 1967 when total responsibility was transferred to the

Office of Security by the DCI. It is presumed that the DCI was

at least generally aware of the confinement of Nosenko and the

one continement,

conditions of confinement, but any definite statement must be

based on SE records:

Question #4 - Where is Nosenko working now?

Answer:

Nosenko is currently employed at his personally owned

residence in North Carolina.

He is engaged in research and

analytical work based on his previous knowledge of the KGB

and other Soviet matters. He is in the Washington, D. C. area

for several days approximately every six weeks for direct

interviews by the FBI and Office of Security personnel.

Question #5 - Is he working for CIA?

Answer:

Nosenko has been employed by the Agency on a full-time

contractual basis since 1 March 1969. The original contract

has been periodically amended to reflect additional remuneration,

primarily to compensate for cost of living increases. In late

197, Nosenko was compensated by mutual agreement for salary

not received during the 1 April 1964 to 1 March 1969. In addition,

on 12 July 1973 Nosenko signed an acknowledgement and release

of the United States Government and the Central Intelligence

Agency from any claims prior to that date.

Question #6 - What is his legal status?

Answer:

Nosenko was naturalized as a United States citizen in

April 1974.
