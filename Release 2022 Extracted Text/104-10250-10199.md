iffairs taff from the Inmigration and Naturalization Service

and reference to your re nest of 15 June 1951 to ascertain the

jetails of the Subject's status with this frency and prepare a

, 24l56, regarding the Inmigration request. The

Eclowing information was obteined durire this interview.

2. The Subject is still a cover employee of unis agercy,

1s now In the United states New York City, or home leave, and

is scheduled to report to dashington, D.C., to commence four

weeks of covert trainingor 6 July 1951.

The Subject is presently under consideration by Staff

C/JCB for an assignment with a highly sensitive project under

the supervision of Staff C/ICB.

Under this proposed assign-

ment any publicity or notoriety that the subject would receive

from testifying publicly on questions of commnist associations

of which he may have trowledge would ultimately preclude his

future use with the steff & croceet and would probably jeopar-

dize his future as a covert encloyee c this ligency.

c .

If the Staff fascismart ince unt mtonialize, the

itated will retorr to

metely 15 Aumist 195u as a case officer, and this position

would also be jeopardized by unave publicity.

The Subject's use in the proposed

Pass e project is

still i:: ühe plarning stage,

but the assigment that the sub-

ject is being considered for is a highly sensitive one and

any firther rublicity which the Subject may receive would

ultimately

disqualify him for consideration on this project.

Any approral for INs contact of the subject would

have to be determined after carefully considerine the impor-

tance of the INS case for which the subject's testimony may

be recuired.

??ERe indicated that the Subiect could still

be considered as ar employee of a Division regardless of ine-

ther or not the proposed staff C/TOR assigment meterializes

and any action in the request receivea from IS should be

closely coordineted with both Staif C and iN.
