Dr. Roscoa Beryl WHITE
Interview 25 October 1965

1. Subject arrived in Moscow during the early part
of November 1963 on a ten month exchange fellowship
arranged between the National Academy of Sciences and
the Soviet Academy of Sciences. Subject was assignod to
the Lebodev Pnysics Institute in Moscow and the aajor
portion of his life while in Moscow revolved around his
work at the Institute or various individuals met through
the Institute, Subject ate lunch in the Institute lunch
room or cafeteria anc usually at about the sama time each
day, sonetine between 1:00 and 1:30. Approximately two
weeks after he had arrived at the Institute, Supject and
his colleague, Dr. George RENNINGER, who was at the
Institute on a similar ten month exchange fallowship,
were approached by Vlaljimir Anatolovich SOKOLOVUKIY
while waiting in the cafetoria line. SOKOLOVSKIY, who
identified himself as an American, said that he oad heard
that thoy were in the Institute and wanted to meet them,
During tiis first coaversation Subject claims that
SOKOLOVSXIY told thea that he was in fact William daailton
MARTIN and went on to explain sota of the superficial de-
tails surrounding his defection to the Soviet Union in
1960. MARTIN told them that if thay did not consider him
too tainted ha would welcowo the opportunity of talking
to some Avericans, llc felt that there were many facets
of his experiences-while in’ the Soviet Union which he would
like to talk about but which he could not discuss with nis
Soviet friends. Either on this occasion or later, MARTIN
mentioned that Bernon KITCHELL, who had defected with MARTIN,
was living in Leningrad.

2. Approximately a week later, Subject met MARTIN again

in the lunch room, MARTIN reported that following his first

encounter with Subject and Renninger he had beea called into
the Party office at the Institute, They apologized to hin
for not having warned him in advance that Subject and
Renninger ware being assigned to the Institute, since they
were certain that Subject would. rave wanted to avoid then.
They told MARTIN that it was perfectly permissible for hin

to talk to them, but that he should definitely not reveal his



wield

true identity to than nor should ne give thom his address in
Moscow wince there was the possibility teat taey nad Loca
sent to the Soviet Union to assassinate hin. Quite natural-
ly they also wanted to know what Martin had discussed with
Subject and Ranainger. As a gonoral rule, Subjact saw
MARTIN in the luach roots every week or two for tue entire
period that he was in Aoscow. On certain occasions it
appeared that AARTIN would avoli talking to Suvjact. Based
on SARTIN's actions, Sudject aszwsed tnis usually depended
on wao was present in the lunch roma, Subject added at tnis
point taat their discussions with MARTIN were always in
English.

3. HARTIS nade it Gofinitely clear to Sudject taat
he was intarested in gutting out of the Soviet Unlon. Le
descrived life in the USSR as a constant qanu with the
Boviet officials, HARTIU felt that he hac only been abla
to kesp his head above water while thore because of nis
knowledge of Soviet lay. He axplained to Subject that ne
haé Goveted a great dual of tine atucyin: Soviet law and
had used his knowledga to protect hlaself. tue Soviets
were froquently at a loss when confronted with quotations
from their own laws in total conflict witn actions which
they wero trying to duposa on MARTIN. Subject was onca
asked to write a latter to NARTIN's parents asking thea to
put prassure on the Soviets and the Press to help in ob~
taining his release.

6. MARTIN also described in great detail to Subject
life in general withia the Soviet Union aad what the aver=
age Soviet citizen must face every day. It vas cbylous ta
Subject that MARTIN bac been greatly disillusioned follow-
ing nis arrival in tho USSK when a2 found a society totally
different from what ha had anticipated prior to his departure
froa the United States, The Soviets had exerted consider-
able pressura on Subject to participate in various anti-U.s.
radio programs or to write anti-U.S. articles. After aucr
Giscussion back and forth, MARTIN ayread to write sonething
if taney would proaise to publish it without editing. de
wrote what ha considered a very o2jective cezgarison of life

in the USSR and that in the U.S. After having submitted
this article he was never approached again on thia topic.

5. Regular contacts between Sudject; RENNINGER and
MARTIN continued in the luncn room with general conversations
such as tnose@ noted above until December or early January
1964, At this point, MARTIN asked Subject if ne or RENNINGER
would go to the U.S. Embassy to ask them if there were any
way in wnich they could assist him in leaving the Soviet
Union legally or otherwise. Subdject noted that RENNINGER
had already contacted the U.S. Kmbassy following the first
meeting with MARTIN to report on their conversations with
him and the fact that ne was in Moscow.

6. Also at about tho same time, probably early January,
Subject was standing in the lunch room lino (Subject always
referred to it as the lunch room rathez than a cafeteria)
when ho saw MARTIN togothor with an attractive young girl
about 20 or 21 years of age. Thoy stopped to chat for a
moment and MARTIN introduced Alla Aleksandrovna KOZLOVA.
Subject ouphasited that this was ontirely casual and that
their conversation at this meeting lasted for only a few
minutes. A few daye or possibly a week later, MARTIN saw
Subject in the lunch room and mentioned that "Alla‘ had
found him quite a handsome individual. “MARTIN ientioned
this only in passing and in no way, as far as Subject was
concerned, attempted to force “Alla“ on Subject. Subject
was equally impressed with "Alla" and during the following
few days made’ several inquiries anong his Sovict colleaques
in the Institute. lio one had. anything particular to gay
about her other than that she was rather active socially and
had many frienda in the Institute. At this point.Subject
aid not know where she worked at the Institute,

7. Sonctime during the latter part of January 1964
Subject had his first date with "Alla.* Subject could not
recall exactly how this was arranged, but he believes that
he met her in the lunch room and asked her.to go on a troika
ride with him. This was followed by five or six other dates
with her over the next seven or eight weeks. They went to a
film once, the Bolshoi once, the opera once, and: restaurants
on two or three occasions.

8.
interested in his Soviet friends and other contacts in the

After a while Sudject noticed that she was particularly



s

Soviet Union. For example, on the evening tuey attended
the Bolshoi, Subject noticed his friond William (3411)
PARRIS, an American cxcnange student at the Moscow State
University. Subject had known hin at Princaton University.
Sudject said, "On, there i3 Hill.“ She inrediately said,
°What did you.sa; about SOKOLOVSZIY?° In otner words, she
know perfectly well that SOXOLOVSKIY and dilliam MARTIN
were one and the sane. She was ooviously easarrassed and
tried without success to cover up her blunder. MARTIN
later told Subject that "Alla" had called Aim that evening
to tell nim of ner blunder, Sha also once asked Subject
if he wera really going to return to the United States.
This could, of course, be interpreted as a defaction pitcn.
Subject feels that it was more of a casual personal remark.

LC

9. According to Subject, "Alla“* seemad to him to ba
much too friendly, wnile at the same tima not sincerely
friendly. In Fepruary, Subject's suspicions had wounted
to a point where he dacided to ask his Soviet colleague in
the Institute, Ilya ROYZIN (phonetic), Lf he could check
with some of his contacts to determine if “Alla” was in
fact being used against him for sone purpose. Subject
claimed that he already know at thia point through conversa-
tions with nies Soviet colleagues that ROYZIN could check
without bringing it to anyone's attantion. Shortly after-
wards, ROYZIN returned to Subject with the advice to stop
seeing bor. He cautioned Subject that he should not mention
to anyone that he nad talked to him and certainly not to say
anything. Subject clains that he stopped dating her after
this point, but did occasionally sea her in the lunch rooa.
After Subject stopped seeing her she called hin at ais
hotel every two or three days. At no point did MARTIN
really push Subject on continuing the relationship.

10. Subjoct described their relationship as perfectly
natural for two young people interested in each other.
They seldon discussed anything of importance and never
discussed his work at the Institute. Subject went heme

“with her to her apartment on two separate occasions. Once

she asked him to spend the night with her, but he indicated
that he should gat back to his notel. Subjact deseribed her
as possibly a bit more forward sexually than otners tnat he
had get, but that their relationship was perfectly normal
and certainly nothing that could be used against him since

Sotritge. |

he was a single man. The apartsent was actually her mother's,
a one room apartment with an alcove for the bed and a small
kitchen. Subject never met her motner and is not sure if

hor father lived {n the apartaent with the mother, Subject
does recall that her sothor had had two husbands although as
did not know if the first one had uied or if they nad been
eivoreed. Subject heard from someone that her father worked
for the KGB. Subject could provide absolutely no further
information on this point. °Alla" never seenod to be push-
ing tne relationship even though she did seem curious adout
soze of Eudject's friends. Once she mentioned to Subject
that they snould not be sean together in the lunch room since
this might be a risk for her.

ll, Subject last saw “Alla* alone just before ha left
the Soviet Union. He was downtown one day and met her by
chance. They. stopped. for coffea and chatted a while. The
only thing of any significance noted was that sho had been
dismissed trom the Labecev Institute and vas tien working
for the Ministry of Poreign Affairs. During the swumer, i
Subject and PANNINGER again visited Moscow tor a woek (15 -
20 July 1965). Thay drove froa Trieste to Prague and then
on into Moscow via train. Arrangements were made through
Inturist. They visited the Lebedev Institute for a day,
as well aa friunds. in Moscow, Nothing occurred on this visit.
of any particular: note. Since his return, Sudject has
received a brief letter froa “Alla” in elementary German,
stating simply that she had heard that he aad been in Moscow
end that she was sorry that they had not seen each other.

The return address.indicated that she had moved:

Boskwa 4-36
Profsojusnaja Ul. 15
Korpus 1 Kwartira 10
