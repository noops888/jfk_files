| He is well known to
[the forrer naving known hir
socially for a nuuber of years and the latter having dealt with Aim on
transportation problems since his appointaent, fifteen months ago, to the
position he now occupies

2. Subject is also a long-time friend of UMMCTED, who brought hin
to-our attention-as a potential recruit and who has provided us.with the
biographical information echtained in the attached personal record fora :

Now 51-676.

ve teen able to-gather from UNYOVED, as réll as
fron subject appears to-be the type of individual which
night be ideally sulted to fulfill certain valuable eperetionel assign nts
) such as "spotter" for other high+level potential azents, highe
ievexcontasts, cut-out, ‘ete. All who know him agree that subject io capable
of "doing anything ahd getting to-know anyone if hé so chooses, “Apparently: :

subject, despite the "tress which ‘surrounds his >eréeptitle personality, 13 :
a serious-ninded, intelligent. and patriotic individual who nas bad auch ex- :
perience along, linés wiich could te of usé to this organization, as well as *
an uncanny knack of being able ‘to! introduce and. ingratiate hizself into prac-
tically any cilleu of interest to his work or. wishes. -A partial Mist of | ery

present expense account budget, Dué to budgetary'restrictions this has
not been possible and subject {s at present seeking aricther. more remuner=
‘ative position, since he claims that his present incove of arproxinately
including expense account) is “insufficient to permit: him

to liv and maintain the contacts and activity required by his
* Job, According to UNC . S 2

froa his good frien the

sales agency | Mearmhile, however, subject is

not contemplating resigning his pesition| until he has a firm and

more remnerative position, UN.CVED states that subject plans to remain
at least until the end of the year, by which time he may have

secured something bet ject has also had talks with
(on his recent trip oe concerning the possibility of handling the

‘agency here. ng has cone cf this possibility to date, but
“gubject Appears to be hopeful,

7. UNWOYED 1s of the opinion that subject would be nost receptive
to a proposition of doing intelligenée work and furthermore believes that
if subject could supplement his present income: by an additional £200 or
$300 per month, he would be willing to renain with TWA, which he likes
and is only consideri*g leaving due to his present low total income, such
of whien Sa spent in connection with activities required by his position.

8, UISOVED has,-of course, mver even hinted to subject anything
about his ona undercover activities and is sure gubject does not ‘suspect
that the former is doing anything tut his cover work in France. UNVOVED,
when questioned as to his opinion concerning subject's poteatial value
a3 a covert. agen’, -as well as ‘his rec-uttability, has pointed ‘out very
strongly that subject, due to the very nature of his personality, mst
be given a good deal of opérational guidance and be closely controlled.
Questioned as to whether sone other individual ‘showl¢ endeavor to reciuit,
subject, UNZOVED was of -tho opiniion-tnat, should the organization desire
to do on, he would be best fitted to exploit subject's potential, since



-3-

he has known hin far a good any years and as a close friend, knows nis
strong and weak points ard could, iu getecal, hataile subjecs to better
advantage than ansther individual who might have only occas‘tonal contact

with hin,

9. Fe request that consideration ve given to the advisability of
-.endeavoring to recruit subject and, in the event of a favorable decision,
that provisional operational clearance be given in order that sub,
be approached on the subject of engaging in intelligence work,
regard to whoa should actually recruit subject, ve suggest that E
safely zake the first approach and, if subject accepts and final security
4s obtained, be night eventually be'turved over to UsiCVED for expteita-
tion.

ae

fe would appreciate your reactions to the desirability of
recruiting suuject, aa well as your thougnts as to how best exploit his:
obvious potential.

_ # Ue Ef subject's recruitability is approved in principle ai ani he
is given provisional security clearance, this Station would then prepare
a field project outline, to be subaitted to you for approvals
