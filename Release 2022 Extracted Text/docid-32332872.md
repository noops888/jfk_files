Out Of Jail." In a lengthy coverage of VALENTI's appearances
before the New York State Commission this article quoted
VALENTI as saying he had not only met GABRIEL MANNARINO

at the meeting but had also met MICHAEL JAMES GENOVESE

of Gibsonia, Pa. He stated there were 30 or 4o persons

at Apalachin, according to his estimate, but that there
could have been 50. He said he only knew 4 or 5 of them
and said that he did not inquire how it was that such a
large gathering was held in BARBARA's home in the middle

of the day during the middle of the week, The article
quoted him as saying that he was at the BARBARA home for
about six'hours eating and drinking brandy. It also quoted
him as saying that he was undismayed when it was made known
that State Police were on the premises and that even if

Js EDGAR HOOVER, FBI chief, was there he would not have been
bothered. as :

An article appearing in the "Pittsburgh Press" dated

March 26, 1959, and entitled "VALENTIS Fail In Freedom

Bid" stated that the New York State Supreme Court had
refused on that date to set free FRANK VALENTI, ex=
Pittsburgh racketeer, and his brother, COSTENZE, who

had been in jail since August, 1958. It quoted Justice
EDGAR J. NATION as saying "The court is not required

to shut its eyes to reality and accept answers which are
replies in form only but, which in substance, are as
useless as complete refusals to answer." .’ :

a croupier at the MANNARINO gambling establishment in
New Kensington, Pa. He said that he has been present
at that establishment with RINALDO and that RINALDO
mentioned to him approximately 5 or 6 days prior to

the time the MANNARINOs and LA ROCCA were to appear ~
before the Federal Grand Jury at Pittsburgh, that

no one was to call his home under any circumstances
because he would have a couple from out of town staying
there and that they did not want to be bothered. He
described them only as a man and girl and the informant
advised he never saw them because they never left ,

the house but had "CHIPS" bring in food for the girl

to cook. He believes they exchanged cars also and that
RINALDO drove this car to New Kensington nightly while
the couple stayed at his house. The informant stated |
that he had an idea the couple had something to do with
the Federal Grand Jury and wondered whether there was
anyone who did not answer a subpoena and could not be
located. He further advised that RINALDO has a roomiin a
house almost directly across the street from the Pepsi-
Cola bottling plant near the 5700 block of Center Avenue
and answers telephone number EMerson 2=2298,

A review of the Crisscross Telephone Directory for the
City of Pittsburgh reflects that.one ALFRED RONALLO
of aut Fifth Avenue, subscribed to telephone EMerson
22-2298. -

PG T=2 advised that on March 10, 1959, a collect telephone
call was made to the aforementioned number from GALE

RUSH, Room 411, Mayfair Hotel, Baltimore, Md., and that
on March 15, 1959, a call was made from the aforementioned
number to LE 9-76h0. The party was identified as

GALE RUSH, Room 411, Mayfair Hotel, Baltimore.

PG T-5 advised that when JOHN LA ROCCA returned to Pittsburgh,
from the location at which he was hiding since shortly

after the Apalachin meeting in November, 1957, his youngest
brother JOHN, who is known ‘in racket circles as "Young
JOHNNIE" left his racket setup in Johnstown, Pa., and

spent almost 3 weeks in Pittsburgh, presumably for
conferences with his brother. .-He. said that-."Young JOHNNIE"
telephoned FRANCES PRIAM, Pittsburgh prostitute and

formér’ paramour of the subject, for dates on 3 occasions

while in Pittsburgh and was desirous of having that
individual come to Johnstown with him for a short stay.
He said that when "Young JOHNNIE" comes to Pittsburgh
he always stays with his brother TONY, a barber whose
children are grown. -He explained that TONY is ostensibly
not connected with the rackets in any manner and is
more lenient about late hours and carousing than is
the subject.
- u
PG T-4 advised that the term "Mafia was never used when
he was closely associated with LA ROCCA, FRANK AMATO,
and the MANNARINO brothers. He said that everyone knew
these individuals during the late 1930's and early 4o's
as "blackhanders" and that this term was bandied about
without fear at the offices of the Coin Machine Distributing
Company on Baum Boulevard in Pittsburgh where LA ROCCA held
sway. He said that the aforementioned individuals hired
, groups of “toughs" to do their work for them and that these
* hoodlums of low intelligence and poor Italian background
carried no knives or guns. He said that he recalls that
they were armed with cue sticks which they had ostensibly
stolen from poolrooms throughout the Pittsburgh area and
which had been sawed off to 12-15" lengths. He explained
that the heavy end of the cue stick was used as the business
end and that a hole was bored into the bottom and lead used
as a further weight. He said that after the lead was
inserted into the hole, the hole was corked or filled in
some other manner to make a flat surface. é

The informant recalled that he was given one of the
aforementioned cue sticks as'a present by MIKE GENOVESE, who
fashioned it for his own use, and that he was told by

GENOVESE to use.it “for protection." He said he would still

have the stick if he had not left it in a glove compartment

of a car he sold and does not recall just when these sticks

went out of fashion. He recalled that in. those days the

Italian element in Pittsburgh had a great fear and respect of

LA ROCCA who was, to all intents and purposes, the leader of

the "blackhanders." He said that LA ROCCA was overshadowed

on many occasions, however, by FRANK AMATO, a more mature and
calm racketeer who gave many orders himself and was far more
respected than was LA ROCCA because of his restraint and thought-
fulness in dealing with men working for him. He said that working
in the same office AMATO was a direct contrast to LA ROCCA

and tempered LA ROCCA's orders and blusteryness somewhat.

will have to be handled, however, within the next five or
six weeks, and that at the end of that time LA ROCCA will
probably be called before him to answer some questions
concerning his whereabouts during his disappearance

and for further instructions regarding his petition for
naturalization. HEIMOVITZ advised that he will immediately
contact the Pittsburgh Office of the FBI should any new
recommendations concerning the petition filed by LA ROCCA
come to his attention and that he will advise SA VOEGE

as to the date he will request -LA ROCCA to appear.
