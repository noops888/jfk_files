Mr. McCone. What did you say, sir?
The Chairman. Where did the actual Bese see of the pur-
chased equipment take place?

War it in London?

Mr. McCone. I am not sure whether it was in London or

it was in some European port of embarkation, Rotterdam or Ham-
burg or something. |

Mr. Schwarz. Was there in that connection also an j

wre

‘Saesr om-

activity to sabotage the shipment of VickesBaispaeape

H CEES to Cuba? :
i

Mr. McCone. It seems to me I recall some such thing,

whether it was GEEEs) Spare Parts or others, there was

i Cavers to Cuba. |

Mr. Schwarz. Were there any efforts undertaken to blow

some operation in connection with material fr:

up ships?
|

Mr. McCone. ‘There was a great deal of talk about it.
There were some rather exotic plans. But I don't think there was
ever any explosive planted in a ship.
Now, I may be wrong on that, but I do not recall it. :

1
Mr. Schwarz. Whether or not anything ever come off, did the
|
committee approve the blowing up of certain ships?

Mr. McCone. I would have to go to the record to answer i

that question.

Mr. Schwarz. Do you recall whether the plans included

blowing up the ships in transit between Cuba and other countries?
