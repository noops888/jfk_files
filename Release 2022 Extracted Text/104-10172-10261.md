if 1, As of 1966, the KGB was attempting to locate former Soviet
intelligence officers who had defected, in order. to carry out
liquidation operations against them. Defectors so ta ted were
Yuriy Ivanovich NOSEXKO, Anatoliy Mikhaylovich GOLITS Nikolay
Yevgenyevich KHOKHLOV, and Petr Sergeyevich DERYABIN. In August
1966 the KGB Resideacy in Washington, D.C. acquired the addresses
of two Soviet defecters. _ According to source, the KGB was able ‘to
locate certain of ‘these individuals by checking city telephone
directories after cbtaining their assumed names from Congressional
records, where they eppeared in connection with the defectors' /
acquisition of United States citizenship.

2. The KGB considered GOLITSYN an average officer. They
believed that he probably ‘did not provide American intelligence‘with
much information, as he was working in the Information Department
before his defection and therefore did not have access to operational
matters and also was assigned to the léth (Counterintelligence)
Department for only a short study of operations. In this regard,
they considered NOSEXXO's defection much more damaging to the X33.
Although GOLITSYN knew more about First Chief Directorate matters,
NOSENKO was in a position to provide information on Second Chief
Directorate operations, as well as on the KGB as a whole.
