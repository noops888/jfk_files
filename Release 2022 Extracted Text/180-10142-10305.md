his own list; of course, we must see whate he comes up with. In any case it

is our view that we should not rush matters unduly if there is real State

Department interest in hving Mr. Ray and company play a role in the pro-

visional government. Should the decision be made to write Ray off, we believe t

the Assembly could be convolked without too mich ado,

substituting Miro

Cardona for Ray. It should be noted that the above is only the gist of a
