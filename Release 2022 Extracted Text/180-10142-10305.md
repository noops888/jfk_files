26. Memorandum for the Record dated 28 February 1961 by Droller, Suj:
Plans for the Establishment of the Cuban Provisional Govermnetn.
Droller,and Napoli met with Varona on Feb 17. On same day they had a
meeting with both Varona and Ray. Droller presented list af 29 names
from which they were to chose 10 for provisional govt. Ray got mad.
Algo gave them a 7 point program as discussed with the Chief of the
Western Hemisphere Division.
Agreed that Varona, Ray, Artime, Carrillo, Chibas and Pazos would meetd’
in NY on 26 Feb. in order to examine list of 29 names and make decision
and Ray and Varona would retrun to Washington on or about 1 March with
their findings. Droller's C onment: -"We believe that Varona will
play ball one way or another, but we are not convinced that Ray will
accept our list. We have the impression that he might want to substitute
his om list; of course, we must see whate he comes up with. In any case it
is our view that we should not rush matters unduly if there is real State
Department interest in hving Mr. Ray ani company play a role in the pro-
visional government. Should the decision be made to write Ray off, we believe t
the Assembly could be convolked without too mch ado, substituting Miro
Cardona for Ray. It should be noted that the above is only the gist of a
long conversation session which, by the way, was recorded and took place in
the Shoreham hotel...."

week of 17 April and upon the request of V and AMJAG he had called a meeting
of AMBUD, at which AMDIP1 had requested in an insolent manner and a loud
voice that I be replaced in the work I have been doing. The reason given

by AMDIP] and upheld completely by AMJAG was that I had not told AMBUD}

the day, hour, and place of landing of the army of Liberation, and therefore
AMBUD should withdraw its confidence in me. AMBUD-1 explained to me that
at this time of confusion, and thinking of what was best for Cuba, he thought
